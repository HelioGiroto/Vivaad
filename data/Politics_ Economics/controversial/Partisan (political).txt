Partisan (political) In politics, a partisan is a committed member of a
political party. In multi-party systems, the term is widely understood to carry
a negative connotation - referring to those who wholly support their party's
policies and are perhaps even reluctant to acknowledge correctness on the part
of their political opponents in almost any situation. Partisanship can be
affected by many factors including current events, figureheads (presidents),
decisions, and even location. For example, in Commonwealth realms, the monarch
is seen as being distinctly non-partisan and thus is vested with certain powers
to form or dissolve governments when there is a democratic impasse. This is in
contrast to professional politicians who are expected to push for their party's
interests. In the United States, the meaning of the term has changed
dramatically over the last 50 years. Before the American National Election
Study (described in Angus Campbell, et al., in The American Voter) began in
1952, an individual's partisan tendencies were typically determined from their
voting behavior. Since then, "partisan" has come to refer to an individual with
a psychological identification with one or the other of the major parties.
