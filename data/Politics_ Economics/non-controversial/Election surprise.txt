Election surprise An election surprise (also a pre-election surprise, or, in
the U.S., October surprise, where elections are held on the first Tuesday after
the first Monday of November) is an event which occurs preceding an election
which has enough shock value that it may be able to sway voters in close
elections. When planned, an election surprise may be an act of propaganda.
Election surprises typically fall into categories such as terrorism, political
scandals, etc. Rumours of potential election surprises may also abound
preceding an election. "The term "election surprise" may also be used to denote
an election with a surprising outcome."
