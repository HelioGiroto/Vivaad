Turner Controversy The Turner Controversy is a name given to a dispute within
the Socialist Party of Great Britain regarding the nature of socialism
instigated by Tony Turner. The dispute ultimately led to an exodus of members
who went on to form the short-lived Movement for Social Integration. When
membership and activity was at a peak in the period after the Second World War,
Turner began giving lectures for the Party on what socialism would be like. The
content of these lectures led him to develop a position that caused enormous
controversy in the Party by the early to mid-1950s and which was elaborated by
Turner and his supporters in articles in the Party’s internal discussion
journal of the time, "Forum". This view was in direct contradiction to the
Party's Declaration of Principles, which identifies socialism as being the
product of the class struggle and which states that the socialist movement will
organise for the capture of political power, including power over the state’s
coercive machinery, should it need to be used against a recalcitrant anti-
socialist minority. A series of acrimonious disputes between the
‘Turnerites’ and the majority of the Party culminated in a Party referendum
and then a resolution being carried at the 1955 Party Conference to the effect
that all members not in agreement with the Declaration of Principles be asked
to resign. Turner, having survived a previous attempt to expel him, promptly
did so, along with a number of other members including Joan Lestor (later to
become a Labour minister) and the psychologist John Rowan. Some of these ex-
members formed a short-lived Movement for Social Integration, though,
ironically enough, the impact the dispute had on the Party as a whole was
almost entirely disruptive and negative. Indeed, it didn’t recover its
vitality for some years, until the wave of radicalisation that grew up in the
1960s.
