Inge Scholl Inge Scholl (August 11, 1917, Crailsheim – September 4, 1998) was
the daughter of Robert Scholl, the mayor of Forchtenberg, and was the sister of
Hans and Sophie Scholl, who studied at the University of Munich in 1942, and
were core members of the White Rose student resistance movement in Nazi
Germany. The White Rose was a student group that printed and distributed
leaflets highly critical of Nazi war crimes, particularly against the Jews on
the eastern front. They said the war could not be won (they were mostly active
after the Wehrmacht's disastrous reverse at The Battle of Stalingrad and the
collapse of Operation Barbarossa). They warned that the German people might
become "...forever the nation hated and rejected by all mankind". Sophie and
Hans were caught distributing the leaflets, tried for treason and executed by
guillotine, along with another White Rose member, Christoph Probst. Inge and
other Scholl family members were arrested and interrogated, but later released.
Inge, her husband Otl Aicher, and Max Bill (former student at the Bauhaus)
founded in 1953 the Ulm School of Design (German: "Hochschule für Gestaltung
(HfG Ulm)" in Ulm, Germany. She was heavily involved in the peace movement in
the later half of the 20th century. She wrote a number of books about the White
Rose organization. She died of cancer on 4 September 1998.
