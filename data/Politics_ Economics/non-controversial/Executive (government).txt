Executive (government) The executive arm/tier is the part of government that
has sole authority and responsibility for the daily administration of the
state. The executive branch executes the law. The division of power into
separate branches of government is central to the idea of the separation of
powers. In many countries, the term "government" connotes only the executive
branch. However, this usage fails to differentiate between despotic and
democratic forms of government. In authoritarian systems, such as a
dictatorship or absolute monarchy, where the different powers of government are
assumed by one person or small oligarchy, the executive branch ceases to exist
since there is no other branch with which to share separate but equal
governmental powers. The separation of powers system is designed to distribute
authority away from the executive branchâ€”an attempt to preserve individual
liberty in response to tyrannical leadership throughout history. The executive
officer is not supposed to make laws (the role of the legislature) or interpret
them (the role of the judiciary). The role of the executive is to enforce the
law as written by the legislature and interpreted by the judicial system.
Responsibility. In a presidential system the leader of the executive branch is
at once the "head of state and head of government". In a parliamentary system,
a cabinet minister responsible to the legislature is the head of government,
while the head of state is a largely ceremonial monarch or president.
