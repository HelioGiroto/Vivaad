Radical Youth (Aotearoa New Zealand) Radical Youth was an autonomous group of
young people who formed in early 2005 to tackle issues that affect the youth of
their country of New Zealand/Aotearoa. The group defines itself as anti-
authoritarian and anti-capitalist, and since its inception has worked on issues
including; internet censorship in schools, the G8, child poverty, climate
change and ending youth pay rates. They have organised a Carnival Against
Capitalism in solidarity with the mass protests in Gleneagles against the G8 in
July 2005. Later in August, Radical Youth launched their campaign against youth
rates with a rally at Aotea Square and a picket outside the central McDonald's.
Since then Radical Youth have supported the Supersizemypay.com campaign for
secure hours, an end to youth wages and raising the minimum wage to $12/h. In
March 2006 the group came to national prominence with a high school walkout to
call for the abolition youth rates. The event, which attracted up to 1000
school students, was labelled as riotous and gathered much media attention, due
in part to the young age of the organisers. On May Day, Radical Youth organised
a rally and march to continue young workers' struggle for equal pay. Radical
Youth recently organised a critical mass in Auckland's CBD on International Day
of Direct Action against Climate Change and the G8. They dropped banners in
support of the Save Happy Valley Campaign to stop Solid Energy's coal mine.
