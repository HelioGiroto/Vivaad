Beirut–Damascus Declaration The Beirut–Damascus Declaration was a statement
signed by between 274 and 500 Lebanese and Syrian activists and intellectuals
which called on the Syrian regime to correct its relationship with Lebanon and
to respect Lebanon's independence and sovereignty starting with demarcating a
common border and establishing diplomatic relations. It also called for an end
to political killings in Lebanon. Since its publication on May 12, 2006, many
of the Syrians signatories have since been fired from their jobs and have been
subject to persecution. The BBC reports that seven opposition figures were
jailed for signing it. Michel Kilo's served three years in prison after signing
it and another signatory — human rights lawyer Anwar al-Bunni — remains in
jail after being sentenced to five years.
