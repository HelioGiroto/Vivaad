May Conspiracy May Conspiracy (in Czech "Májové spiknutí") was an
unsuccessful attempt of radical democrats in the Czech lands to overthrow the
government of Austrian Empire in 1849. In 1844 group of Czech Radical Democrats
(which included both Czechs and Czech Germans) formed a secret political club
"Repeal" (named after mass Irish movement to repeal the Act of Union from
1800). Among the leaders were Josef Václav Frič, Karel Sabina, Karel
Sladkovský, Emanuel Arnold and Vilém Gauč. The club attracted radical
students and local intelligentsia and remained active after revolutions of 1848
were suppressed. Mikhail Bakunin, a Russian Pan Slavic revolutionary, visited
Prague in March 1849 and suggested to organize armed uprising in Prague and
several German speaking cities as a response to post-1848 political reaction.
Date of the uprising was set on May 12, 1849 but due to amateurish organization
police took the organizers into custody on the night of May 9/10. Prague and
few towns were put under state of emergency (also called "the siege", "stav
obležení"), press was put under censorship by military and a military
commission was established up to investigate the conspiracy. The emergency was
lifted only on September 1, 1853. 79 young radicals were sentenced to prison,
most of them being released as in general amnesty on May 8, 1857.
