Environmental finance Environmental Finance is the use of various financial
instruments (most notably land trusts and Emissions trading) to protect the
environment. The field is part of both environmental economics and the
conservation movement. The field of Environmental Finance was first defined by
Richard L. Sandor, American economist and entrepreneur, when he taught the
first ever Environmental Finance course at Columbia University in the fall of
1992. Dr. Gretchen Daily, of Stanford University has written a book, "The New
Economy of Nature" that addresses the issue of financing ecosystem services.
Dr. JÃ¼rg P. Blum, defined the term environmental finance (Dissertation:
Corporate Environmental Responsibility and Corporate Economic Performance...
1994 at USIU)as a fairly new field, "concerned mainly with finance and
investment regarding the ecological environment. The term environment, although
frequently used in areas, such as strategic management (Ansoff, 1968), has been
popularized throughout literature synonymously with the term ecological
environment."
