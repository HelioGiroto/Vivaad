Timeline of women's suffrage Women's suffrage has been achieved at various
times in various countries throughout the world. In many countries women's
suffrage was granted before universal suffrage, so women (and men) from certain
classes or races were still unable to vote, while some granted it to both sexes
at the same time. The timeline below lists years when women's suffrage was
enacted in various places. In many cases the first voting took place in a
subsequent year. New Zealand in 1893 is often said to be the first country in
the world to give women the right to vote. A contestant for being the first
independent nation to grant women the right to vote would be Sweden, where
conditional woman suffrage was granted during the age of liberty between 1718
and 1771, when taxpaying women listed in their guilds as professionals were
allowed to vote "Disclaimer: This timeline reflects a vast amount of
information from the women's suffrage movement throughout the globe. In many
cases, countries passed various laws which progressively gave women the right
to vote. Many countries may appear on the list more than once because
restrictions on suffrage were only lifted slowly. This list only states the
right to vote; for other rights, see Timeline of women's rights (other than
voting)."
