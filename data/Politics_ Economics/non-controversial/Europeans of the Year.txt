Europeans of the Year The "Europeans of the Year" award was established in 2001
by European Voice to honor influential European citizens who have mostly
affected the European legislative and policy agenda. The annual award is
officially supported by Belgian Prime Minister Guy Verhofstadt. Every year,
senior editors of European Voice and a panel of advisors from the European
community select 50 people who have had most influence on the European
legislative and policy agenda in the past year. The list includes European
Commissioners, MEPs, Heads of State, Politicians, EU Functionnaires, NGOs,
Campaigners and European citizens. Following a public poll, the results of
which are announced at a gala dinner, the winners in different categories
receive the "Europeans of the Year" awards.
