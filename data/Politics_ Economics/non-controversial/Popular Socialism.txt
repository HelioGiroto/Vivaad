Popular Socialism Popular Socialism (Danish: "Folkesocialisme") is a distinct
Scandinavian socialist current. Around the world there are many parties called
Popular Socialist Party or likewise, which does not really imply any specific
ideological direction. For example, the Popular Socialist Party of Mexico is a
rather hardline communist party, whereas the Spanish PSP was a left-social
democrat formation. But in the Scandinavian context the term can be said to
represent a distinct ideological tendency, originating from Aksel Larsen's
split from the Communist Party of Denmark in 1956. Larsen founded Socialistisk
Folkeparti (Socialist People's Party) which placed itself between communism and
social democracy. In Norway a similar party, SF, was formed through an anti-
NATO/anti-European Economic Community-split from the social democrats. SF later
became the back-bone of Sosialistisk Venstreparti (Socialist Left Party).
Today, both the Danish SF and the Norwegian SV identify their ideological base
as 'Popular Socialism'. In Sweden the term has sometimes been used in the Left,
and there were at one point discussions within the rightist section of the
Communist Party on forming a political project with the Danish SF as model. But
that split was avoided, although the Nordic contacts and Eurocommunism became
important influences in the Swedish party.
