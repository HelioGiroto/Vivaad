Generation Engage 1. Young Americans do not suffer not from a lack of interest,
but from a lack of access. 2. Our democracy should be a dialogue not a
monologue. 3. The best investment we can make in the civic health of our nation
is in traditionally-marginalized young people at the local level. Strategy.
GenerationEngage combines grass-roots outreach with new technologies to
increase civic participation rates among young Americans who lack college
experience. GenGage employs full-time staff in local communities, who, thanks
to strategic corporate partnerships with Apple and Google, connect
GenerationEngage members in schools, churches, pool halls, and community
centers around the country via videoconference for interactive conversations
with prominent national and international civic leaders on critical social
issues. Past Speakers. Video of GenerationEngage iChat conversations with
prominent civic leaders, like President Bill Clinton, Former Speaker of the
House Newt Gingrich, Associate Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, Coretta
Scott King, Spike Lee, Vice President Al Gore, major 2008 presidential

aid organizations, can viewed at GenerationEngage's YouTube Channel.
