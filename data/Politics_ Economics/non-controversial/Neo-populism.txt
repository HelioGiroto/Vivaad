Neo-populism Neo-populism or Neopopulism, also known as media populism or new
populism, is a cultural and political movement emergent in the early 21st
century, especially in Latin American countries. Neo-populism is an economic
and social system based on worker initiative and democratic ideals. It is
distinct from 20th century populism, a political philosophy supporting the
rights and power of the people in their struggle against the privileged elite,
in that it radically combines, or perhaps redefines, classically opposed left-
right political attitudes and incorporates various new electronic media as a
means of popular dissemination. In Latin America, this shift has been evidenced
by various cross-pollinations of authoritarian or centralized government,
populist rhetorical strategies and free market economics. Neo-populism versus
classical Populism. A fledgling realm of political thought, Neo-populism
distinguishes itself from classical Populism in shifting focus from community
rights to those of the individual. With a likewise contrasting emphasis on
efficient non-bureaucratic government, differing opinions within the paradigm
argue the appropriate scales of state responsibility in terms of public goods,
of which, government transparency is largely assumed.
