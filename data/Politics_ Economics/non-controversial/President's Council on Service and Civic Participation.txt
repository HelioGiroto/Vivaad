President's Council on Service and Civic Participation The President's Council
on Service and Civic Participation was created by President George W. Bush in
January 2003 by executive order. Its mission is to encourage volunteerism and
to recognize the contributions Americans make through service and civic
participation. In January 2002, President George W. Bush called upon all
Americans to give two years or 4,000 hours of their lives to service. The
Council was created to further this goal, encouraging Americans of all ages and
backgrounds to become more engaged in civic activities. Council members provide
leadership, serving as "Ambassadors of Service" for the President's vision of
fostering a culture of citizenship and volunteer service in the United States.
The Council is administered by the Corporation For National and Community
Service, with members from business, entertainment, sports, education,
government, nonprofits, and the media. The chair of the Council is Jean Case,
CEO of the Case Foundation, and the vice chair is musician Michael W. Smith.
The Council created the President's Volunteer Service Award to recognize
outstanding volunteers. Since 2003, more than 700,000 people have won the
award. President Bush amended the executive order in January 2007 to extend the
Council through November 2008.
