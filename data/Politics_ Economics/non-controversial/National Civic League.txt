National Civic League The National Civic League is an American non-profit
organization that advocates for transparency, effectiveness, and openness in
local government. It was founded as the National Municipal League in 1894 at a
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania convention of politicians, policy-makers,
journalists, and educators (including Theodore Roosevelt, Louis Brandeis,
Marshall Field, and Frederick Law Olmsted) to discuss the future of American
cities. It also promotes professional management of local government through
publication of "model charters" for both city and county governments. It is
best known for its All-America City Award, given to ten communities annually.
It also has a Community Services Program, New Politics Program, and Federal-
Community Partnership Program. In the last 25 years, NCL has worked intensively
with communities through its Community Services program to address current
challenges including developing green and sustainable solutions, addressing
racial inequity, and strengthening immigrant integration strategies.
