Billboarding Billboarding is one form of ecotage in the form of
monkeywrenching. It is the act of cutting down, burning, and/or defacing
highway billboards. The American novelist Edward Abbey seems to have greatly
advanced (if not out-right advocated) the art of billboarding starting around
the year 1950 in and around the New Mexico city of Albuquerque. Billboarders
consider billboarding an art form as well as an ethical, moral, and justified
act. Billboarding takes a minor role in the Abbey novel "The Monkey Wrench
Gang."
