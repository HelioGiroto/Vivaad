Capital asset The term capital asset has three unrelated technical definitions,
and is also used in a variety of non-technical ways. Non-technical and
ambiguous usage. A well-known financial accounting textbook advises that the
term be avoided except in tax accounting because it is used in so many
different senses, not all of them well-defined. For example it is often used as
a synonym for fixed assets or for investments in securities. A common non-
technical usage occurs when people ask that employees or the environment or
something else be treated as a capital asset. In this context it means
something managers have a responsibility to maintain, and to report changes in
value as gains or losses. Capital assets should not be confused with the
capital a financial institution is required to hold. This capital is computed
from the right-hand side of the balance sheet while assets are found on the
left-hand side.
