Goodhart's law Goodhart's law, although it can be expressed in many ways,
states that once a social or economic indicator or other "surrogate" measure is
made a target for the purpose of conducting social or economic policy, then it
will lose the information content that would qualify it to play that role. The
law was named for its developer, Charles Goodhart, a former advisor to the Bank
of England and Emeritus Professor at the London School of Economics. The law
was first stated in a 1975 paper by Goodhart and gained popularity in the
context of the attempt by the United Kingdom government of Margaret Thatcher to
conduct monetary policy on the basis of targets for broad and narrow money, but
the idea is considerably older. Closely related ideas are known under different
names, e.g. Campbell's Law (1976), and the Lucas critique (1976). The law is
implicit in the economic idea of rational expectations. While it originated in
the context of market responses the Law has profound implications for the
selection of high-level targets in organisations. It has been asserted that the
stability of the economic recovery that took place in the United Kingdom under
John Major's government from late 1992 onwards was a result of "Reverse
Goodhart's Law": that, if a government's economic credibility is sufficiently
damaged, then its targets are seen as irrelevant and the economic indicators
regain their reliability as a guide to policy.
