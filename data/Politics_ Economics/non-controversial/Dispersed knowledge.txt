Dispersed knowledge In economics, dispersed knowledge, also known as partial
knowledge, is information that is dispersed throughout the marketplace, and is
not in the hands of any single agent. All agents in the market have imperfect
knowledge; however, they all have a good indicator of everyone else's knowledge
and intentions, and that is the price. The price indicates information that the
player does not know; by deciding to buy, sell or abstain at that price it also
gives the player a chance to bring their knowledge to bear and reflect itself
in the price. Most of the knowledge, however, is tacit knowledge: people
usually are not fully aware of the knowledge that they are sharing via price
signals, nor do they fully perceive the knowledge that they use when they make
a price decision. When a buyer goes to market, the prices he or she finds
therein for products and services have been set by the complex calculus that is
the sum total of the tacit knowledge residing within the market. Price signals
are one possible solution to the economic calculation problem. This viewpoint
was expressed by John Stuart Mill... ...and is especially popular among
Austrian School economists such as Friedrich Hayek... ...and among Chicago
School economists such as Frank Knight... Example. Wikipedia itself provides an
example of the dispersed knowledge concept.
