Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays Egalitarianism as a
Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays represents some of libertarian anarchist
Murray Rothbard's most advanced and radical theorizing on topics impacting on
human liberty. Appearing first in 1974, this volume looks beyond conventional
left-right thinking and hence contributes to the groundwork for the current
intellectual challenge against centralized social and economic management. The
book's title comes from the lead essay, which argues that egalitarian theory
always results in a politics of statist control because it is founded on revolt
against the ontological structure of reality itself. According to Rothbard in
this lead essay, statist intellectuals attempt to replace what exists with a
Romantic image of an idealized primitive state of nature, an ideal which cannot
and should not be achieved, according to Rothbard. The implications of this
point are worked out on topics such as market economics, child rights,
environmentalism, feminism, foreign policy, redistribution and others. For
until Rothbard's work is carefully studied by every advocate of liberty, the
value of his contributions to the libertarian system cannot be fully
appreciated and, moreover, the unity and true historical context of
libertarianism will not even be fully grasped.
