Oligopsony An oligopsony (from Ancient Greek ὀλίγοι (oligoi) "few" +
ὀψωνία (opsōnia) "purchase") is a market form in which the number of
buyers is small while the number of sellers in theory could be large. This
typically happens in a market for inputs where numerous suppliers are competing
to sell their product to a small number of (often large and powerful) buyers.
It contrasts with an oligopoly, where there are many buyers but few sellers. An
oligopsony is a form of imperfect competition. The terms monopoly (one seller),
monopsony (one buyer), and bilateral monopoly have a similar relationship. One
example of an oligopsony in the world economy is cocoa, where three firms
(Cargill, Archer Daniels Midland, and Callebaut) buy the vast majority of world
cocoa bean production, mostly from small farmers in third-world countries.
Likewise, American tobacco growers face an oligopsony of cigarette makers,
where three companies (Altria, Brown & Williamson, and Lorillard Tobacco
Company) buy almost 90% of all tobacco grown in the US. In each of these cases,
the buyers have a major advantage over the sellers. They can play off one
supplier against another, thus lowering their costs. They can also dictate
exact specifications to suppliers, for delivery schedules, quality, and (in the
case of agricultural products) crop varieties. They also pass off much of the
risks of overproduction, natural losses, and variations in cyclical demand to
the suppliers.
