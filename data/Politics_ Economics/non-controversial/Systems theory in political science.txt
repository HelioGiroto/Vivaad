Systems theory in political science Systems theory in political science is a
highly abstract, partly holistic view of politics, influenced by cybernetics.
The adaptation of system theory to political science was first conceived by
David Easton in 1953. Overview. If the system functions as described, then we
have a "stable political system". If the system breaks down, then we have a
"dysfunctional political system". Political analysis. Easton aspired to make
politics a science, that is, working with highly abstract models that described
the regularities of patterns and processes in political life in general. In his
view, the highest level of abstraction could make scientific generalizations
about politics possible. In sum, politics should be seen as a whole, not as a
collection of different problems to be solved. His main model was driven by an
organic view of politics, as if it were a living object. His theory is a
statement of what makes political systems adapt and survive. He describes
politics in a constant flux, thereby rejecting the idea of "equilibrium", so
prevalent in some other political theories (see institutionalism). Moreover, he
rejects the idea that politics could be examined by looking at different levels
of analysis. His abstractions could account for any group and demand at any
given time. That is, interest group theory and elite theory can be subsumed in
political systems analysis. His theory was and is highly influential in the
pluralist tradition in political science. (see Harold Lasswell and Robert Dahl)
