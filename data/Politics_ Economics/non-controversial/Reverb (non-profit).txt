Reverb (non-profit) Reverb is a non-profit environmental organization that
educates and engages musicians and their fans to promote environmental
sustainability. It was founded by environmentalist Lauren Sullivan and her
musician husband, Guster guitarist/vocalist Adam Gardner. Reverb's greening
services include carbon neutral concerts and venues; biodiesel for vehicles and
generators; waste reduction; biodegradable catering products; recycling; green
bus supplies and cleaners; energy efficiency; green contract rider; eco-
friendly merchandise; green sponsorship; and on site and on-line fan outreach.
Reverb's "Eco-Village" provides fans with a "hands on" learning experience that
engages them with local non-profit groups, and gives them the opportunity to
volunteer with tree, and environment-focused groups within their community.
Fans can also donate money for the cause and receive a souvenir sticker. Reverb
has worked with such artists as Alanis Morissette, Avril Lavigne, Barenaked
Ladies, Beastie Boys, Blue Man Group, Bonnie Raitt, Brandi Carlile, Dave
Matthews Band, Fall Out Boy and the Honda Civic Tour, Jack Johnson, John Mayer,
Norah Jones, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Sheryl Crow, The String Cheese Incident,
The Fray, Phish, Jason Mraz, and others.
