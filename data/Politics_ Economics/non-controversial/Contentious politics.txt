Contentious politics Contentious politics has existed forever, but its form
varies over time and space. For example, historical sociologist Charles Tilly
argues that the nature of contentious politics changed fairly dramatically with
the birth of social movements in 18th century Europe. The concept of
contentious politics was developed throughout the 1990s and into the 21st
century by its most prominent scholars in the United States: Sidney Tarrow,
Charles Tilly, and Doug McAdam. Until its development, the study of contentious
politics was divided among a number of traditions each of which were concerned
with the description and explanation of different contentious political
phenomena, especially the social movement, the strike, and revolution. One of
the primary goals of these three authors was to advance the explanation of
these phenomena and other contentious politics under a single research agenda.
There remains a significant plurality of agendas in addition to the one these
three propose.
