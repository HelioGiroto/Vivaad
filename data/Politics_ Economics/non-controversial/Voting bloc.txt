Voting bloc A voting bloc is a group of voters that are strongly motivated by a
specific common concern or group of concerns to the point that such specific
concerns tend to dominate their voting patterns, causing them vote together in
elections. For example, Beliefnet identifies 12 main religious blocs in
American politics, including e.g. the "Religious Right", whose concerns are
dominated by religious and sociocultural issues and "White Bread Protestants",
who, while also conservative, tend to care more about economic issues. The
result is that each of these groups votes en bloc in elections. The divisions
between voting blocs are known as cleavage. A voting bloc can be longstanding
and institutionalized, such as support for business or labor, or it can be
created from scratch as the result of the saliency of a new public issue, such
as a war or the potential resumption of a military draft. Ethnic groups are
sometimes considered to be voting blocs, but it is unwise to simply assume that
a majority of a given ethnic group will vote in one particular way, as economic
status and religious beliefs also play an important role. Voting blocs grow and
wane according to the development of issues and personalities. These blocs can
often disappear and reappear with time and are not necessarily motivated by one
single issue.
