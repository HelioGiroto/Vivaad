Market anomaly A market anomaly (or market inefficiency) is a price and/or
return distortion on a financial market that seems to contradict the efficient
market hypothesis. There are anomalies in relation to the economic fundamentals
of the equity, technical trading rules, and economic calendar events. Anomalies
could be fundamental, technical, or calendar related. Fundamental anomalies
include value effect, small-cap effect (low P/E stocks and small cap companies
do better than index on an average) and the Low volatility anomaly. Calendar
anomalies involve patterns in stock returns from year to year or month to
month, while technical anomalies include momentum effect.
