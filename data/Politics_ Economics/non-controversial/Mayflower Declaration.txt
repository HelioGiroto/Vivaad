Mayflower Declaration The Mayflower Declaration is a statement of political
philosophy designed to be compatible with mainstream Christian beliefs and
values. It was adopted by the Council of the Christian Peoples Alliance in
September 2001. It is relatively succinct, running to thirteen A5 pages. After
a brief recapitulation of Christian beliefs and values, and their relevance to
British politics, the Mayflower Declaration describes "six guiding principles
which highlight some basic themes of Christian Democracy". These are Justice,
Respect for Life, Reconciliation, Active Compassion, Wise Stewardship, and
Empowerment. The document also contains a list of goals for the Christian
Peoples Alliance in the policy areas of Education, Health, Welfare, Employment,
Housing, International Policy, Economics, Defence, Business, the Environment,
Crime, Transport, Regeneration, Discrimination, Culture and Sport, and
Agriculture. Finally, it requires that each policy area is "to be considered in
relation to both other policy areas and the following areas of focus, to ensure
that all policies are considered for their impact in a range of contexts".
These "following areas of focus" are: the person, the family, the community,
the region, the nation, and the globe. Title. The declaration was named after
the Mayflower Family Centre in London's Canning Town. At the time Alan Craig
was Director of the Mayflower Family Centre.
