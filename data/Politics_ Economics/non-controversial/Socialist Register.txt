Socialist Register "Socialist Register" is an annual journal. It was founded in
1964 by Ralph Miliband and John Saville. They had criticisms of the New Left
Review after Perry Anderson assumed leadership of the NLR. Miliband and Saville
sought to bring about a journal in the orientation of "The New Reasoner."
