Green lending Green lending refers to a lending dependent on environmental
criteria for the planned use of funds. Recently major banks such as Wells Fargo
(July 2005, $1bn over 5 years) and Bank of America (March 2007, $20 bn) have
dedicated financing toward green entrepreneurship. This usually means financing
the building of environmentally sustainable or friendly buildings or
enterprises. Banks appear to have taken the helm in instituting this social/
financial change as opposed to borrowers.
