Student fee A student fee is a fee charged to students at a school, above and
beyond the normal tuition and matriculation fees. These may be charged for
general student activities, for supporting student media and other student
organizations, for intercollegiate or intramural sports or academics, or as a
means of making-up for a shortfall in state funding at a public college (often
called a technology fee). Other fees may be charged to students, such as for
insurance and health (such as a school nurse), and optional fees such as for
parking. Constitutionality of activity fees in the United States. In the United
States, the constitutionality of mandatory student activity fees has been
adjudicated several times by the Supreme Court of the United States. Most
recently, the court has ruled that public universities may subsidize campus
speech by means of a mandatory student activity fee so long as fees are
allocated to groups with viewpoint neutrality. See "Board of Regents of the
University of Wisconsin System v. Southworth" .
