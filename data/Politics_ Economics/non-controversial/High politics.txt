High politics Within the subfield of international relations, and political
science as a whole, the concept high politics covers all matters that are vital
to the very survival of the state: namely national and international security
concerns. It is often used in opposition to "low politics". Although the idea
of high politics has been present in all cultures and epochs, Hobbes was the
first to enunciate that (of trade, the laws, societal order, etc.) hinges upon
a finite number of ingredients. For him, these ingredients were embodied and
provided by the State. However, interpreting Hobbes, these ingredients are what
we call "high politics." The term "high politics" in itself was probably coined
during the Cold War, given the stakes of an atomic war. The advent of the
atomic bomb made it clear what was ultimately worth fighting for and what was
not. Hence, made clear what "high politics" meant. In that sense, the United
States and the former USSR would have gone to war for a direct atomic (see
Cuban Missile Crisis), but would have never gone to war over "low politics",
say, a boycott of the Olympic games (see 1980 Summer Olympics). Trade, for all
its importance, is considered by most political scientists as "low politics",
as it depends on specific security conditions to come into effect.
