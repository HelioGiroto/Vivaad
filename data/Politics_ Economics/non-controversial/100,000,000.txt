100000000 (number) One hundred million (100,000,000) is the natural number
following 99999999 and preceding 100000001. In scientific notation, it is
written as 108. East Asian languages treat 100,000,000 as a counting unit,
significant as the square of a myriad, also a counting unit. In Chinese,
Japanese, and Korean respectively it is "y√¨" (ÂÑÑ) (or "w√ nw√ n" [Ëê¨Ëê¨] in
ancient texts), "oku" (ÂÑÑ), and "eok" (Ïñµ/ÂÑÑ). These languages do not have
single words for a thousand to the second, third, fifth power, etc.)
