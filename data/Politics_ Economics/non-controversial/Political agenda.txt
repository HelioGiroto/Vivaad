Political agenda A political agenda is a set of issues and policies laid out by
an executive or cabinet in government that tries to influence current and near-
future political news and debate. The political agenda while shaped by
government can be influenced by grass-roots support from party activists at
events such as a party conference and can even be shaped by non governmental
activist groups which have a political aim. Governmental organizations such as
Make Poverty History and environmental groups such as Greenpeace have been able
to shape the political agenda at international conferences. Increasingly the
mass media can have an effect in shaping the political agenda through its news
coverage of news stories. Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver was able to shape the
political agenda by running a series of programs which criticized the quality
of school dinners in the United Kingdom. This led to government action by
education secretary Ruth Kelly to improve the quality of meals which would not
have occurred if not for such prominent and vocal criticism. A political party
can be described as "shaping the political agenda" or "setting the political
agenda" if its promotion of certain issues gains prominent news coverage, for
example at election time a political party wants to promote its polices and
gain prominent news coverage in order to increase its support.
