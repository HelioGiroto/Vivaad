Buddhist socialism Buddhist socialism is a political ideology which advocates
socialism based on the principles of Buddhism. Buddhist socialists have called
for state provision of the Buddhist requisites of food, shelter, clothing and
medicine, for the abolition or amelioration of class distinctions, for
campaigns for morality based on Buddhist traditions, and for workers and
peasants to overcome the love of property. People who have been described as
Buddhist socialists include Buddhadasa Bhikkhu, S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, Han
Yong-un, U Nu and Norodom Sihanouk. Bhikkhu Buddhadasa coined the phrase
"Dhammic socialism". He believed that Socialism is a natural state meaning all
things exist together in one system. Han Yong-un felt that equality was one of
the main principles of Buddhism. In an interview published in 1931, Yong-un
spoke of his desire to explore Buddhist Socialism.
