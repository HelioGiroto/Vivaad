Digital era governance In the public administration debate about New Public
Management (NPM), the concept of digital era governance (or DEG) is claimed by
Patrick Dunleavy, Helen Margetts and their co-authors as replacing NPM since
around 2000-05. DEG has three key elements: reintegration (bringing issues back
into government control, like US airport security after 9/11); needs-based
holism (reorganizing government around distinct client groups); and
digitization (fully exploiting the potential of digital storage and Internet
communications to transform governance). References. Patrick Dunleavy, Helen
Margetts et al., Digital Era Governance: IT Corporations, the State and E-
Government (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006).
