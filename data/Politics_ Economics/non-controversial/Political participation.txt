Participation (decision making) Participation in social science refers to
different mechanisms for the public to express opinions - and ideally exert
influence - regarding political, economic, management or other social
decisions. Participatory decision making can take place along any realm of
human social activity, including economic (i.e. participatory economics),
political (i.e. participatory democracy or parpolity), management (i.e.
participatory management), cultural (i.e. polyculturalism) or familial (i.e.
feminism). For well-informed participation to occur, it is argued that some
version of transparency, e.g. radical transparency, is necessary, but not
sufficient. It has also been argued that those most affected by a decision
should have the most say while those that are least affected should have the
least say in a topic. Objectives of participation. Participation activities may
be motivated from an administrative perspective or a citizen perspective on a
governmental, corporate or social level. From the administrative viewpoint,
participation can build public support for activities. It can educate the
public about an agency's activities. It can also facilitate useful information
exchange regarding local conditions. Furthermore, participation is often
legally mandated. From the citizen viewpoint, participation enables individuals
and groups to influence agency decisions in a representational manner. Jules N.
Pretty and E.M. Rocha.
