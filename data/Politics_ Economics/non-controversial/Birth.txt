Birth Birth (calving in livestock and some other animals, whelping in
carnivorous mammals) is the act or process of bearing or bringing forth
offspring. The offspring is brought forth from the mother. The time of human
birth is defined as the time at which the fetus comes out of the mother's womb
into the world. Different forms of birth are oviparity, vivipary and
ovovivipary.
