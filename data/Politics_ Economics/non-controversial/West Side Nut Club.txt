West Side Nut Club The West Side Nut Club is an organization that aims to
promote civic welfare in the city of Evansville, Indiana. The slogan of the
organization is “From small acorns large oaks grow.” The club began early
in the 20th century as a noontime gathering of west side businessmen who
lunched at West Franklin Street to discuss the topics of the day. The original
name of the informal association was "West Side Epicures." In March 1914,
feeling that the name "did not express anything to the layman," the men changed
the name to "The Nut Club." In the same month, they proposed to the West Side
Business Association that a fall festival be held in October. As a result of
this proposal, the West Side's "First Annual Fall Festival" was staged on West
Franklin Street. However, it was until 1921, when the Nut Club was formally
organized with a much larger membership, that the festival began its tradition
as a truly annual event. This festival is one of the larger festivals in the
Midwestern United States. Membership in the club is limited to 300 members.
While the organization still acts as a civic organization, it also supports
scholarships and sponsors local festivals, including the annual West Side Nut
Club Fall Festival.
