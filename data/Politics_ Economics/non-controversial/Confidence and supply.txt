Confidence and supply In a parliamentary democracy, confidence and supply are
required for a government to hold power. A confidence and supply agreement is
an agreement that a minor party or independent member of parliament will
support the government in motions of confidence and appropriation (supply)
votes by voting in favour or abstaining. Confidence. In most parliamentary
democracies, members of a parliament can propose a Motion of Confidence or
Motion of No Confidence in the government or executive. The results of such
motions show how much support the government currently has in parliament.
Should a motion of confidence fail, or a motion of no confidence pass, the
government will usually either resign and allow other politicians to form a new
government, or call an election. Supply. Most democracies require an
appropriation bill or something similar to be passed by parliament in order for
a government to receive money to enact its policies. If an appropriation bill
fails, the government loses control of the money supply, and is therefore
virtually powerless. The failure of a supply bill thus has the same effect as
the failure of a confidence motion. In early modern England, the withholding of
funds was one of parliament's few ways of controlling the monarch.
