Party-line vote A party-line vote in a deliberative assembly (such as a
constituent assembly, parliament, or legislature) is a vote in which every
member of a political party votes the same way (usually in opposition to the
other political party(ies) whose members vote the opposite way). The term
implies that the decision is irrelevant to the merits of the issue at hand or
the political beliefs of individual members, but instead is dictated by party
policy. The United States. In the United States Congress it is the function of
the party whip of each party in each house to ensure that members adhere to
party policies and in particular that members vote for or against bills,
amendments, and (in the case of the United States Senate) for or against
treaties and Administration appointments as determined by senior party
leadership. The leverage available to the party whip may be in rewards (such as
the negotiation of side deals for pork barrel spending), or in punishments
(such as withholding appointments to powerful committees). The ultimate threat
is to support another candidate in the primary election which is a threat made
possible by gerrymandering that ensures the success of a particular party's
candidate. The party whip will operate under the direction of the particular
party's leader (called respectively the majority leader or the minority
leader).
