Institute for Global Communications The Institute for Global Communications or
IGC Internet is an institution that provides Internet presence for groups
deemed "progressive" for example, the Andrea Dworkin archive. IGC Internet is a
project of the Tides Center. In 1987, the Institute for Global Communications
was formed to manage PeaceNet and the newly acquired EcoNet. At its peak in
1998, IGC had over 35 full-time staff members. Since then ConflictNet went out
of existence and LaborNet left the IGC Networks. Internet dial-up and mailing
list services are now provided through partnerships with EarthLink and
Topica.com. IGC still offers web hosting services to nonprofit groups,
individuals, and small companies. eGrants now provides transaction services to
nonprofits. Over 250 nonprofit organizations host their websites through IGC.
In 1988 the IGC formed an international link when it started hosting GreenNet
in the United Kingdom. In 1990, in partnership with six international
organizations, IGC co-founded the Association for Progressive Communications
(APC).
