Energy economics Some institutions of higher education (universities) recognise
energy economics as a viable career opportunity, offering this as a curriculum.
The University of Cambridge, Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the
Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam are the top three research universities, and
Resources for the Future the top research institute. There are numerous other
research departments, companies and professionals offering energy economics
studies and consultations. History. Energy related issues have been actively
present in economic literature since the 1973 oil crisis, but have their roots
much further back in the history. As early as 1865, W.S. Jevons expressed his
concern about the eventual depletion of coal resources in his book "The Coal

exhaustible resources (incl. fossil fuel) was made by H. Hotelling, who derived
a price path for non-renewable resources, known as Hotelling's rule. Sources,
links and portals. There is also a handbook in three volumes. Much progress in
energy economics has been made through the conferences of the International
Association for Energy Economics, the model comparison exercises of the
(Stanford) Energy Modeling Forum and the meetings of the International Energy
Workshop. IDEAS/RePEc has a list of energy economists, a ranking of the same,
and a collection of recent working papers.
