Fisher separation theorem In economics, the Fisher separation theorem asserts
that the objective of a corporation will be the maximization of its present
value, regardless of the preferences of its shareholders. The theorem therefore
separates management's "productive opportunities" from the entrepreneur's
"market opportunities". It was proposed by — and is named after — the
economist Irving Fisher. The theorem has its "clearest and most famous
exposition" in the "Theory of Interest" (1930); particularly in the "second
approximation to the theory of interest" ([http://www.econlib.org/library/
YPDBooks/Fisher/fshToI6.html#firstpage-bar II:VI).
