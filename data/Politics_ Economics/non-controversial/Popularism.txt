Popolarismo Popolarismo ("Popularism") is a political doctrine conceived by Don
Luigi Sturzo, which was the ideological basis for the Italian People's Party
and later Christian Democracy. Within Christian democracy the use of the name
"People's Party" is widespread, so that European Christian democrats decided to
name European People's Party their party in 1976. "Popular" or "people's" in
this context consists of two meanings. The first is the idea that the
Christian-democratic parties should try to work towards a policy that is for
the good of all the members of society, as opposed to parties that promote the
good of a specific group (i.e. class). The second refers to a society where the
people live in a kind of harmony, and where people and groups are interested in
and care about each other.
