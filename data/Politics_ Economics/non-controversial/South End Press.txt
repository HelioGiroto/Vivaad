South End Press South End Press is a non-profit book publisher run on a model
of participatory economics. It was founded in 1977 by Michael Albert, Lydia
Sargent, John Schall, Pat Walker, Juliet Schor, Mary Lea, Joe Bowring, and Dave
Millikan, among others, in Boston's South End. It publishes books written by
political activists, notably Arundhati Roy, Noam Chomsky, bell hooks, Winona
LaDuke, Manning Marable, Ward Churchill, Cherr√≠e Moraga, Andrea Smith, and
Howard Zinn. South End Press is organized as an egalitarian collective with
decision-making ability equally shared. The founders of South End Press have
also been involved with two ongoing political media projects, 'Speak Out' and
'Z Magazine'. They have worked with a number of media and research institutions
including Alternative Radio, Political Research Associates, the Committee on
Women, Population and the Environment, and INCITE! Women of Color Against
Violence. In 2009, South End Press moved to a new office in Brooklyn, New York,
partnering with Medgar Evers College of the City University of New York.
