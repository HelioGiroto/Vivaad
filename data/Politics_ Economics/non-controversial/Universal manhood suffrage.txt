Universal manhood suffrage Universal manhood suffrage is a form of voting
rights in which all adult males within a political system are allowed to vote,
regardless of income, property, religion, race, or any other qualification. It
is sometimes summarized by the slogan, "one man, one vote". In the United
States, the rise of Jacksonian democracy in the 1820s led to a close
approximation of universal manhood suffrage among whites being adopted in most
states (notably excepting Rhode Island until the aftermath of the Dorr
Rebellion), and poorer, frontier citizens felt better represented. Most
African-American males still remained excluded; though the Fifteenth Amendment
to the United States Constitution, ratified in 1868, upholds their voting
rights, they were still denied the right to vote in many places for another
century. As women began to win the right to vote in the late 19th century and
early 20th century, the goal of universal manhood suffrage was replaced by
universal suffrage.
