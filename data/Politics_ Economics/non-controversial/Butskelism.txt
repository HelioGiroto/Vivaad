Butskellism 'Butskellism' is the (moderately satirical) term used in British
politics to refer to the political consensus formed in the 1950s and associated
with the exercise of office as Chancellor of the Exchequer by Rab Butler of the
Conservative Party and Hugh Gaitskell of the Labour Party. The term was
inspired by a leading article in "The Economist" which dramatised the claimed
convergence by referring to a fictitious Mr Butskell. World War II left the
United Kingdom with an appetite for a broader distribution of wealth and a
strengthening of social security, while more conservative instincts held fast
to a belief in individual initiative and private property. The practical
resolution of this tension in politics by the two Chancellors was a Keynesian
mixed economy with moderate state intervention to promote social goals,
particularly in education and health. The consensus dominated British politics
until the economic crises of the 1970s which led to the end of the Golden Age
of Capitalism and the rise of monetarist economics. The Conservative
administration of Margaret Thatcher institutionalised a greater emphasis on a
free market approach to government. However, the idea of Butskellism has been
challenged as a myth, with claims that there was in fact a sustained argument
over the use of physical controls, monetary policy and direct taxation. A
similar term 'Blatcherism' was coined to describe the supposed convergence of
policies of the administrations of Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair.
