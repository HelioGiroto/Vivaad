Writ of election A writ of election is a writ issued by the government ordering
the holding of a special election for a political office. In the United Kingdom
and in Canada, this is the "only" way of holding an election for the House of
Commons. When the government wants to or is required to dissolve Parliament, a
writ of election is issued for each constituency by the Clerk of the Crown in
Chancery (in the UK) or electoral district by the Chief Electoral Officer (in
Canada). In the United States, this writ is issued mainly by state governors
for filling vacancies in the United States House of Representatives, the United
States Senate, or the states' own legislatures. In Australia, the writs are
issued by the Governor-General for the House of Representatives and by the
respective state Governors for the Senate. State governors also issue the writs
for elections in the state and territorial legislatures. The writs are issued
to the relevant Electoral Officer or Returning Officer, as the case may be, who
must return them after the election has been held within a fixed period
