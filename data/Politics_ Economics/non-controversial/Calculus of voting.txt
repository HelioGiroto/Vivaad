Calculus of voting Calculus of voting refers to any mathematical model which
predicts voting behaviour by an electorate, including such features as
participation rate. A calculus of voting represents an hypothesized decision-
making process. These models are used in political science in an attempt to
capture the relative importance of various factors influencing an elector to
vote (or not vote) in a particular way. Example. One such model was proposed by
Anthony Downs (1957) and is adapted by William H. Riker and Peter Ordeshook, in
“A Theory of the Calculus of Voting” (Riker and Ordeshook 1968) where A
political science model based on rational choice used to explain why citizens
do or do not vote.
