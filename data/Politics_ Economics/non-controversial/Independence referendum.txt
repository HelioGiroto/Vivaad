Independence referendum An independence referendum is a type of referendum in
which the citizens of a territory decide whether the territory should become an
independent country. The independence referendum is considered successful if
the citizens vote in favor of independence or unsuccessful if they do not. A
successful independence referendum may or may not result in independence,
depending on whether relevant political factors outside of the territory
recognize the results.
