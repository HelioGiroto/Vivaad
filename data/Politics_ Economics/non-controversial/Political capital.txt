Political capital Political capital is the sentiment that a politician has a
legitimate political mandate to enact policy in the eyes of the voting public.
Dynamics. A politician gains political capital by winning elections, pursuing
policies that have public support, achieving success with initiatives, and
performing favors for other politicians. Political capital must be spent to be
useful, and will generally expire by the end of a politician's term in office.
In addition, it can be wasted, typically by failed attempts to promote
unpopular policies that are not central to a politician's agenda. American
President George W. Bush claimed to have earned "political capital" after the
2004 elections. Political capital is highest in the "honeymoon period" of a
presidency as in the United States, where the president is newly elected and
the people still support the person they voted for. Along with the president's
popularity are those who ride on the "coattails", congressional representatives
of the president's party that are elected alongside the president. This support
in congress enables the president to better use his honeymoon period and
political capital to pass his ideal legislation.
