Anti-authoritarianism Anti-authoritarianism is opposition to authoritarianism,
which is defined as a "a form of social organisation characterised by
submission to authority". Anti-authoritarians usually believe in full equality
before the law and strong civil liberties. Sometimes the term is used
interchangeably with anarchism, an ideology which rejects the state and other
compulsory forms of hierarchical authority altogether. After World War II there
was a strong sense of anti-authoritarianism based on anti-fascism in Europe.
This was attributed to the active resistance from occupation and to fears
arising from the development of superpowers.
