Expansionism In general, expansionism consists of expansionist policies of
governments and states. While some have linked the term to promoting economic
growth (in contrast to no growth / sustainable policies), more commonly
expansionism refers to the doctrine of a state expanding its territorial base
(or economic influence) usually, though not necessarily, by means of military
aggression. Compare empire-building, colonialism, and "Lebensraum".
Irredentism, revanchism, "reunification" or pan-nationalism are sometimes used
to justify and legitimize expansionism, but only when the explicit goal is to
reconquer territories that have been lost, or to take over ancestral lands. A
simple territorial dispute, such as a border dispute, is not usually referred
to as expansionism.
