Linestanding Linestanding or seatholding is a service provided in Washington,
D.C. to lobbyists, corporate legislative offices, non-profit organizations,
lawyers, and other people having an interest in matters being debated or bills
being marked up by the United States House of Representatives or United States
Senate. The linestanding company will send someone to Capitol Hill to stand in
line well in advance of the hearing or mark-up to help the client gain entry
into the hearing room with a good seat in the visitors gallery. On October 18,
2007, freshman Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri proposed that
linestanding for registered lobbyists be made illegal. Her feeling was that
lobbyists should have to stand in line with everyone else.
