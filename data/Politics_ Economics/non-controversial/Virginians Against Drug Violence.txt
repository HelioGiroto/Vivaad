Virginians Against Drug Violence Virginians Against Drug Violence, or VADV, is
an organization devoted to ending the (drugs)|drug war in the Commonwealth of .
It reviews the Virginia General Assembly's bills every year, sending out emails
to a network of citizens and urging them to contact their legislators on
relevant issues. VADV activists persuaded the legislature to carve out an
exemption in the marijuana cultivation law so that individuals growing cannabis
for their own use would be prosecuted only for simple possession. Virginia thus
has more lenient laws on cultivation than even California. In addition, VADV
activists successfully lobbied the General Assembly to keep medical marijuana
legal for cancer and glaucoma and put marijuana in a class by itself, as
opposed to being a scheduled controlled substance. See also. =References=
