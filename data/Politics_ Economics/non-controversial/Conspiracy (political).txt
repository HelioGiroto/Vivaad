List of conspiracies (political) In a political sense, conspiracy refers to a
group of persons united in the goal of usurping or overthrowing an established
political power. Typically, the final goal is to gain power through a
revolutionary coup d'Ã©tat or through assassination. A conspiracy is to be
contrasted with a cabal. The two are similar but have quite different
connotations; in contrast to a cabal, a conspiracy usually looks to overthrow a
fixed power instead of usurping it from within.
