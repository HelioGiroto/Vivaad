The Triple Revolution "The Triple Revolution" was an open memorandum sent to
U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson and other government figures on March 22,
1964. It was signed by an array of social activists, professors, and
technologists who identified themselves as the Ad Hoc Committee on the Triple
Revolution. Overview. The statement identified three revolutions underway in
the world: the "cybernation revolution" of increasing automation; the "weaponry
revolution" of mutually assured destruction; and the "human rights revolution".
It discussed primarily the cybernation revolution. The committee claimed that
machines would continue to reduce the number of manual laborers needed, while
increasing the skill needed to work, thereby producing greater unemployment. It
proposed that the government should ease this transformation through large-
scale public works, low-cost housing, public transit, electrical power
development, income redistribution, union representation for the unemployed,
and government restraint on technology deployment. In Harlan Ellison's 1967
anthology "Dangerous Visions", Philip Jos√© Farmer's story "Riders of the
Purple Wage" examines the Triple Revolution document as it may someday apply to
future society.
