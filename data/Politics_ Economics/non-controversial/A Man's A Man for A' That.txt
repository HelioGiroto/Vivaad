Is There for Honest Poverty "Is There for Honest Poverty", commonly known as "A
Man's a Man for A' That", is a 1795 Scots song by Robert Burns, famous for its
expression of egalitarian ideas of society, which may be seen as expressing the
ideas of liberalism that arose in the 18th century, and anticipating those of
socialism which arose in the 19th century. Renowned Scottish folksinger Sheena
Wellington sang the song at the opening of the Scottish Parliament in May,
1999. The song was also sung at the funeral of Donald Dewar, the inaugural
First Minister of Scotland. It is also known in translations into other
European languages, for example the German "Trotz alledem und alledem" by
Ferdinand Freiligrath right after the Revolution of 1848 (sung by Hannes Wader
as "Trotz alledem"). The words "pride o' worth" appear on the crest of the
Scottish Qualifications Authority. The Old Blind Dogs covered this song on
their 2001 album "Fit?" and the Mudmen covered it on their 2012 album "Donegal
Danny".
