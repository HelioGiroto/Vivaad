Nuclear-Free Future Award Since 1998 the Nuclear-Free Future Award (NFFA) is an
award given to anti-nuclear activists, organizations and communities. The award
has honored and helped facilitate the on-going work of individuals and
initiatives struggling to undo this juncture of time for the sake of the coming
generations. The central message is: leave the uranium in the earth ! The award
is intended to promote the opposition to uranium mining, nuclear weapons and
nuclear power. The NFFA is a project of the Franz Moll Foundation for the
Coming Generations and gives out awards in three categories: Resistance
($10,000 prize), Education ($10,000 prize) and Solutions ($10,000 prize).
Additional optional categories are Lifetime Achievement and Special Recognition
(contemporary work of art). The award ceremonies take place all around the
world. The NFFA is financed by donations, charity events, and benefit auctions.
