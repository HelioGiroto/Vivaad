Delegate model of representation The delegate model of representation is a
model of a representative democracy. In this model, constituents elect their
representatives as delegates for their constituency. These delegates act only
as a mouthpiece for the wishes of their constituency, and have no from the
constituency. This model does not provide representatives the luxury of acting
in their own conscience. Essentially, the representative acts as the voice of
those who are (literally) not present. This model was formulated by Edmund
Burke (1729-1797), a British philosopher, who also created the trustee model of
representation.
