Pre-Marx socialists While Marxism had a significant impact on socialist
thought, pre-Marxist thinkers (before Karl Marx wrote on the subject) have
advocated socialism in forms both similar and in stark contrast to Marx and
Engels' conception of socialism, advocating some form of collective ownership
over large-scale production, worker-management within the workplace, or in some
cases, a form of planned economy.
