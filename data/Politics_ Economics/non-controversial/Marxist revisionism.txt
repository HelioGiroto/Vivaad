Revisionism (Marxism) Within the Marxist movement, the word revisionism is used
to refer to various ideas, principles and theories that are based on a
significant "revision" of fundamental Marxist premises. The term is most often
used by those Marxists who believe that such revisions are unwarranted and
represent a "watering down" or abandonment of Marxism. As such, "revisionism"
often carries pejorative connotations. Those identified as "revisionists" have
criticized "orthodox" Marxism and particularly its founder Karl Kautsky, for
having disregarded Marx's view of the necessity of evolution of capitalism to
achieve socialism by replacing it with an "either/or" dynamic between
capitalism and socialism; for disregarding Marx's emphasis on the role of
parliamentary democracy in achieving socialism; as well as criticizing Kautsky
for his idealism of state socialism.
