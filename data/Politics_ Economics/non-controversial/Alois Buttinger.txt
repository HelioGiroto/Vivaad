Alois Buttinger In February 1934, Alois (Louis) Buttinger, an Austrian
socialist, was director of the "Sonnenhof Lind" children's centre in Villach-
Lind, part of Villach in Austria. In the aftermath of the February Uprising of
1934, which led to the subsequent prohibition of the Social Democratic Party
and the Dollfuß constitution of 1 May 1934, Buttinger emigrated to England in
May 1934. Later, he returned illegally to Villach, but had to flee again, with
his wife, on the night of 11–12 March 1938 when the Nazis entered Austria. In
English exile again, Buttinger worked for the refugee assistance programme
organized by the Austrian socialists. In 1941, he and his family sailed to the
United States—immigrant visas had been organized by his brother Joseph
Buttinger who, with his American-born wife, Muriel Gardiner, had made his way
to the US in Autumn 1939; one of the endorsements for the visa application was
provided by Albert Einstein. In 1950, now using the firstname Louis, Buttinger
and his wife Friedl founded Camp Hillcroft in Dutchess County, New York which
was still being managed by his son and grandson more in the first decade of the
next century.
