Party platform A party platform or platform is a list of the actions which a
political party, individual candidate, or other organization supports to appeal
to the general public for the purpose of having said peoples' candidates voted
into political office or the professed opinion(s) proposed as part of law(s) or
otherwise made into social policies. This often takes the form of a list of
support for, or opposition to, socially relevant, urgent, controversial, or
complicated topics or issues. Individual topics, and a party's, person's, or
organization's opinion on them are often called the "planks" of their platform
in reference to a basic stage made out of boards or planks of wood, similar to
what can be assembled for public speaking or debates to be held on. A party
platform is sometimes referred to as a manifesto or a political platform.
Origins. The first known use of the word platform was in 1535. The word
platform comes from Middle French "plate-forme", literally meaning "flat form".
The political meaning of the word to reflect "statement of party politics" is
from 1803, probably originally an image of a literal platform on which
politicians gather, stand, and make their appeals.
