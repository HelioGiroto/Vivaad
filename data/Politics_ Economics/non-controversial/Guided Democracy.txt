Guided democracy Guided democracy, also called managed democracy, is a term for
a democratic government with increased autocracy. Governments are legitimated
by elections that are while and fair but used by the government to continue
their same policies and goals. In other words, the government has learned to
control elections so that the people can exercise all their rights without
truly changing public policy. While they follow basic democratic principles,
there can be minor deviations towards authoritarianism. Under managed
democracy, the electorate is prevented from having a significant impact on
policies adopted by the state's continuous use of public relations techniques.
The term was first for Indonesia, but it is now also widely employed in Russia,
where it was introduced into common practice by the Kremlin theorists, in
particular Gleb Pavlovsky.Other examples include Italy under Silvio Berlusconi
and Hungary under Viktor Orban.
