Positive political theory Positive political theory or explanatory political
theory is the study of politics using formal methods such as social choice
theory, game theory, and statistical analysis. In particular, social choice
theoretic methods are often used to describe and (axiomatically) analyze the
performance of rules or institutions. The outcomes of the rules or institutions
described are then analyzed by game theory, where the individuals/parties/
nations involved in a given interaction are modeled as "rational" agents
playing a game, guided by self-interest. Based on this assumption, the outcome
of the interactions can be predicted as an equilibrium of the game. The founder
of the field was William H. Riker. In his book "The Theory of Political
Coalitions" (1962), he applied the principles of game theory to the study of
politics.
