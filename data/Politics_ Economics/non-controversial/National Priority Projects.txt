National Priority Projects The National Priority Projects of the Russian
Federation is a program of the Russian government set out by Russian President
Vladimir Putin in his speech on September 5, 2005. The program is aimed to
develop social welfare in Russia by additional funding by the state of four
selected projects focusing on public health, education, housing and
agriculture. The program has been supervised by the Council for Implementation
of the Priority National Projects attached to the President of the Russian
Federation, created according to a presidential decree on October 21, 2005. The
council has been headed by the President himself, First Deputy Prime Minister
Dmitry Medvedev has been appointed First Deputy Chairman of the Council and
Chairman of its Presidium, Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Zhukov and Igor
Shuvalov, aide to the President, have become deputy chairmen of the Council.
The most high-profile change within the national priority project frameworks
has probably been the 2006 across-the-board increase in wages in healthcare and
education, as well as the decision to modernise equipment in both sectors in
2006 and 2007.
