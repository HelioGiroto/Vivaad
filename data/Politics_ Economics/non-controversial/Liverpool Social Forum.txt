Liverpool Social Forum The Liverpool Social Forum (LSF) is a fortnightly
meeting held in Liverpool, England. It is influenced by the alter-globalisation
principles of the European Social Forum (ESF), and a number of Liverpudlians
attended the 2004 ESF in London. In 2005, one focus of activity was
preparations for the G8 summit in Scotland. Since 2006, activists have been
working towards establishing a social centre in Liverpool city centre, which
officially opened on 15 September 2007[http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/regions/
liverpool/2007/09/381223.html]. The LSF works collectively and non-
hierarchically - no one person or group is in charge. Broadly, participants
share a desire to create and live out a fair, peaceful world, free of
oppression, where people are more important than profit. At meetings,
Merseyside activists share ideas, skills and resources, while organising events
and actions. The agenda is compiled at the start of each meeting, and is open
to all.
