Aviation ministry An aviation ministry is a cabinet level department of a
government which is concerned with matters of aviation within a particular
country's airspace. An aviation ministry may also be involved with a nation's
air force, either to a limited degree or in direct command. One of the more
well known aviation ministries was the aviation ministry of Nazi Germany which
formed the Luftwaffe under Hermann GÃ¶ring. Other nations, for instance the
United States, do not have a cabinet or state level department for aviation,
but rather civilian or federally sponsored civilian agencies, one of the better
known being the Federal Aviation Administration.
