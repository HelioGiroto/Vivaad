Regional hegemony __NOTOC__ Regional hegemony is a concept in international
relations which refers to the influence exercised over neighboring countries by
an independently powerful nation, the regional hegemon. The relationship
between regional hegemons and the other states within their spheres of
influence is analogous to the relationship between a global hegemon and the
other states in the international system. The prominent international relations
scholar John Mearsheimer writes extensively about the pursuit of regional
hegemony in his book, "The Tragedy of Great Power Politics". According to his
theory, known as offensive realism, the anarchic nature of the international
system, the desire for survival, and the inability to be sure of other states'
intentions ultimately lead states to pursue regional hegemony. According to
Mearsheimer, global hegemony is an unattainable goal; instead, a state which
has achieved the level of regional hegemon will then work to prevent the
development of peer competitors in other regions. Contemporary examples.
Contemporary examples are often politically sensitive or arguable. Often
analysis of regional hegemons are based on a specific context or perspective
which renders their identification subjective.
