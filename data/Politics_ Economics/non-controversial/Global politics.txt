Global politics Global politics is the discipline that studies the political
and economical patterns of the world. It studies the relationships between
cities, nation-states, shell-states, multinational corporations, non-
governmental organizations and international organizations. It has been argued
that global politics should be distinguished from the field of international
politics, which seeks to understand political relations between nation-states,
and thus has a narrower scope. Similarly, international relations, which seeks
to understand general economic and political relations between nation-states,
is a narrower field than global politics. Current areas of discussion include
national and ethnic conflict regulation, democracy and the politics of national
self-determination, globalization and its relationship to democracy, conflict
and peace studies, comparative politics, political economy, and the
international political economy of the environment. Definition. Beginning in
the late 1800s, several groups have extended the definition of the political
community beyond nation-states to include much, if not all, of humanity. These
"internationalists" include Marxists, human rights advocates,
environmentalists, peace activists, feminists, and dalits.
