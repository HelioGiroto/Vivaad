Lusophilia Lusophilia () is the love of, or friendship or sympathy toward,
Portugal and/or Portuguese things. The word derives from "Luso-" (representing
Lusitania, an ancient Roman province corresponding to some areas of modern
Portugal and western Spain) plus "-philia" (Greek "φιλíα", "affection").
The opposite sentiment is lusophobia. "Lusofonia". The "Lusofonia" or
Portuguese-speaking community is an obvious source of lusophilia. This includes
Portugal's former colonies and Portuguese expatriates worldwide. Both past and
current cultural trends or fashions born in Portugal are often followed in such
territories around the world by a considerable number of native residents. This
includes an extensive demand for European made music, sports (particularly
football), television and other media, websites and consumer products from
Portugal. Good diplomatic relations and high influxes of immigrants from these
former colonies to Portugal, and of Portuguese tourists and foreign direct
investment in the opposite direction, helped to preserve or even revigorate
lusophilia.
