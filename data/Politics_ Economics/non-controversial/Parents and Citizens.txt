Parents and Citizens Some Australian State Schools, both primary and high, are
supported by Parents and Citizens Associations. These groups provide volunteer
support, raise funds for infrastructure and other expenses and assist in the
administration of their school. A large part of many P&C activities is the
provision of subsidies to school excursions and other supplemental and
extracurricular activities. P&Cs encourage the general public and local
businesses to become involved with their local schools. Recent years have seen
a number of changes to the environment in which P&Cs operate.
