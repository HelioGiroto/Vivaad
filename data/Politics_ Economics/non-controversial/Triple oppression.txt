Triple oppression __NOTOC__ Triple oppression is a theory developed by black
socialists in the United States, such as Claudia Jones. The theory states that
a connection exists between various types of oppression, specifically classism,
racism, and sexism. It hypothesizes that you must strike concurrently at all
three types of oppression to overcome the oppression. For an example of triple
oppression in practice, consider a factory that contains both men and women of
various ethnic backgrounds. If the workers hold racist and sexist beliefs,
triple oppression says they will fail to unite to obtain better working
conditions, because they are hamstrung by these beliefs.
