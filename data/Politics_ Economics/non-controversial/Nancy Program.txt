Nancy Program The Nancy Program was the party platform for the Nationalist
Socialist Party in France in 1889. It was written by Maurice Barr√®s, an
elected deputy from the town of Nancy (in Lorraine), and is valuable as a
representative statement of the outlook of the new Right in France at the turn
of the 20th century.
