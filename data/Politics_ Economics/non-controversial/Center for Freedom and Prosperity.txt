Center for Freedom and Prosperity The Center for Freedom and Prosperity (or
CF&P) is a lobbying organization advocating flat tax and territorial taxation
systems. The organization and its subsidiary Center for Freedom and Prosperity
Foundation (a tax-exempt organization) claims to publish studies and conduct
seminars analysing the benefits of jurisdictional tax competition, financial
privacy and fiscal sovereignty. Background. The organisation's views are
rejected by many European nations and many of the intranational organisations
which it so often criticises, who see it as a lobbying mouthpiece for the
Offshore Financial Centres. However, the organisation tends to be much more
effective in the U.S.A. which also believes in promoting tax competition, both
internally (between the 50 states) and internationally. See also. Daniel J.
