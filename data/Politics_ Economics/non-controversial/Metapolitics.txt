Metapolitics Metapolitics (sometimes written meta-politics) is metalinguistic
talk about the analytic, synthetic, and normative language of political inquiry
and politics itself. Put simply, it is dialogue about the way we talk about
politics. If one studies, analyzes, and describes a language, the language used
for studying, analyzing, and describing the object language is a
"metalanguage". In current usage and praxis, the term "metapolitics" is often
used in relation to postmodern theories of the Subject and their relation to
political theory. In its broadest definition, "metapolitics" is a discipline
that studies the relationship between the State and the Individual.
