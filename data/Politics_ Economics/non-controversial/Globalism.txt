Globalism Globalism can have at least two different and opposing meanings. One
meaning is the attitude or policy of placing the interests of the entire world
above those of individual nations. Another is viewing the entire world as a
proper sphere for one nation to project political influence. American political
scientist Joseph Nye, co-founder of the international relations theory of
neoliberalism, argues that globalism refers to any description and explanation
of a world which is characterized by networks of connections that span multi-
continental distances; while globalization refers to the increase or decline in
the degree of globalism. In his 2005 book "The Collapse of Globalism and the
Reinvention of the World", Canadian philosopher John Ralston Saul argued that,
far from being an inevitable force, globalization is already breaking up into
contradictory pieces and that citizens are reasserting their national interests
in both positive and destructive ways.
