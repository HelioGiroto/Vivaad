Demzilla DataMart and Demzilla were databases that were rolled out by the
Democratic Party from 2002. By 2004 Datamart contained information on 166
million registered voters, and with input from public voter informartion and
consumer data from data mining companies a single entry might have 200 to 400
items of information. Demzilla was a smaller database used for fundraising and
organization volumteers. The goal was to aggregate and analyze voter and public
information data in order to target Democratic voters as part of their national
GOTV effort as well as fund raising campaigns. This data was also available to
Senatorial and Congressional candidates as well as other party members. The
Republican Party had a similar project, the Voter Vault, started in the 1990s.
