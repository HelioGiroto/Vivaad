Commercial Club of Chicago The Commercial Club of Chicago is an anti-labor club
resulted from the 1907 merger of two predecessor Chicago clubs: the Merchants
Club (organized in 1896) and the Commercial Club (organized in 1877). Its most
active members included George Pullman, Marshall Field, Cyrus McCormick, George
Armour, Frederic Delano, Sewell Avery, Rufus C. Dawes, and Julius Rosenwald.
The club has promoted Chicago's economic development for generations and
championed member Daniel Burnham's Plan of Chicago (1909), also known as
Burnham's plan. The plan gave the blueprint for the future growth and
development of the entire Chicago region. The Commercial Club addressed many
other progressive reform issues: supported street cleaning and paving projects,
smoke abatement and sanitation schemes, and the development of city parks and
playgrounds. They also maintained a consciousness of social reform issues like
juvenile delinquency, race relations, and old-age pensions. The club remains in
existence today tracing its origins back to the 17 founding members of the
Commercial Club in 1877. The current Chairman is Lester Crown and the current
President is Tyrone Fahner.
