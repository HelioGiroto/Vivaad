Repugnancy costs Repugnancy costs are costs borne by an individual or entity as
a result of a stimulus that goes against that individual or entity's cultural
mores. The cost could be emotional, physical, mental or figurative. The
stimulus could be anything from food to people to an idea. These costs are
perspective-dependent and individual. These costs may be different for
different groups of people; countries, states, ethnicities, etc. The term
allows for a clear and understandable way of representing the concept of
contextual stigma in a literal and applicable sense. Origin. Repugnancy costs
were first mentioned in a debate between Alvin Roth and Julio Elias on whether
there should be an official market for kidneys. The act of buying and selling
organs may be against one's cultural mores; it may be repugnant. Hence, this is
an additional costs one must bear if such a market was deemed repugnant in the
context of one's culture.
