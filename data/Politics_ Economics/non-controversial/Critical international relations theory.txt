Critical international relations theory Critical international relations theory
is a diverse set of schools of thought in International Relations (IR) that
have criticized the theoretical, meta-theoretical and/or political status quo,
both in IR theory and in international politics more broadly â€” from
positivist as well as postpositivist positions. Positivist critiques include
Marxist and Neo-Marxist approaches and certain ("conventional") strands of
social constructivism. Postpositivist critiques include poststructuralist,
postcolonial, "critical" constructivist, Critical Theory (in the strict sense
used by the Frankfurt School), neo-Gramscian, most feminist and some English
School approaches, which differ from both realism and liberalism in their
epistemological and ontological premises. Such theories are now widely
recognized and taught and researched in many universities, but are as yet less
common in the United States. They are taught at both undergraduate and
postgraduate levels in many major universities outside the US, where a major
concern is that "a myopic discipline of IR might contribute to the continued
development of a civil society in the U.S. that thinks, reflects and analyzes
complex international events through a very narrow set of theoretical lenses"
