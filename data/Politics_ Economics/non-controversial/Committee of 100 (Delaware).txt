Committee of 100 (Delaware) The Committee of 100 is a Wilmington, Delaware
based lobbying group that deals with issues relating to economic development,
local finance, and land use policy in the state of Delaware, particularly the
northern part of New Castle County. It was founded in 1967. The committee's
membership consists of a wide range of businesses, including banks, law firms,
engineering and construction companies, architecture firms, advertisers and
marketers, accounting firms, insurance companies, utilities, manufacturers, and
medical institutions. It holds monthly meetings, usually at the University and
Whist Club in Wilmington, at which key government officials and business
leaders are guest speakers. The Committee keeps track of proposed legislation
and participates in various government-sponsored task forces and committees.
The Committee of 100 was, for example, involved in the negotiations that led to
the American Automobile Association's decision to move its headquarters to
Delaware. The Committee of 100 provides an Academic Scholarship of $3,000 each
year. Any graduating high school senior who is a resident of New Castle County
and intends to major in a business or economics related field may apply.
Members of the Committee and various other organizations contribute to the
scholarship fund.
