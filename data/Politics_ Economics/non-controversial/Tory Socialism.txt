Tory socialism Tory socialism was a term devised by historians, particularly of
the early Fabian Society, to describe the governing philosophy of the British
prime minister Benjamin Disraeli. Such philosophy is generally defined as the
belief in reformist-minded activist government, at once appealing to political
sentiments commonly associated with both conservatism and socialism. The
domestic policies of Richard Nixon were also considered by many intellectuals
to be Tory socialist, and had much in common with the philosophy of "big
government conservatism" espoused by many neo-conservatives. It was in keeping
with this that David Gelernter wrote a long essay in "The Weekly Standard"
extolling Disraeli as the founder of modern neo-conservatism. The phrase has
also been used by Vernon Bogdanor to describe the thinking of Ferdinand Mount.
