Townsite A townsite is a legal subdivision of land for the development of a
town or community. In the historical development of the United States, Canada,
and other former British colonial nations, the filing of a townsite plat
(United States) or plan (Canada) was often the first legal act in the
establishment of a new town or community. Townsites in British Columbia.
Although most of these townsites were incorporated into newly created cities
and municipalities of Metro Vancouver, official survey plans still continue to
designate lots as being part of these townsites. For example, a 2008 strata
plan in Vancouver's Gastown is indicated as being in the Granville Townsite.
Townsite planning was either done by government authorities or by private
developers. In the case of North Vancouver townsite in 1907 most of the land
was owned by the North Vancouver Land and Improvement Company. By owning large
amount of land they were able to plan on a grand scale. New Westminster was
surveyed by the Royal Engineers under government direction. As existing towns
grow, they develop Official Community Plans (OCPs) that expand upon the already
existing townsites. However, periodically new communities are still created. In
1975, the Whistler townsite was created and eventually incorporated as a
municipality. The new municipality was given of Crown land to develop the
townsite.
