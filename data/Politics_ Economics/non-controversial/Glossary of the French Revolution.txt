Glossary of the French Revolution This is a glossary of the French Revolution.
It generally does not explicate names of individual people or their political
associations; those can be found in List of people associated with the French
Revolution. The terminology routinely used in discussing the French Revolution
can be confusing, even daunting. The same political faction may be referred to
by different historians (or by the same historian in different contexts) by
different names. During much of the revolutionary period, the French used a
newly invented calendar that fell into complete disuse after the revolutionary
era. Different legislative bodies had rather similar names, not always
translated uniformly into English. This article is intended as a central place
to clarify these issues. The three estates. "See also:" Fourth Estate, a term
with two relevant meanings: on the one hand, the generally unrepresented poor,
nominally part of the Third Estate; on the other, the press, as a fourth
powerful entity in addition to the three estates of the realm. Months of the
French Revolutionary Calendar. Under this calendar, the Year I or "Year 1"
began 22 September, 1792 (the date of the official abolition of the monarchy
and the nobility). Symbols. Cockades. Cockades ("cocardes") were rosettes or
ribbons worn as a badge, typically on a hat. Other countries and armies at this
time typically had their own cockades.
