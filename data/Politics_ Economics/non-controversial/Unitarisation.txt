Unitarisation In politics, unitarisation is a process of uniting a political
entity which consists of smaller regions, either by cancelling the regions
completely or by transferring their power to the central government. Politics
which favors this process is called unitarism. Opposite process is called
regionalisation. A unitary state usually has a unicameral legislature.
Furthermore, the smaller regions within a unitary state do not have a contract
(constitution) with the larger, more centralized government. Thus, the smaller
regions government and powers are not "protected" by being entrenched in the
constitution. Regionalisation and unitarisation are often confused with,
respectively, decentralization and centralization.
