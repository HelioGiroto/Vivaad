Dichotomy Such a partition is also frequently called a bipartition. The two
parts thus formed are complements. In logic, the partitions are opposites if
there exists a proposition such that it holds over one and not the other.
Etymology. The term comes from the Greek "dichotomia" (Greek:
"διχοτομία") (divided): "dich-" (form of "dícha", in two, asunder);
"tomia-" a combining form meaning cutting, incision, excision of an object.
