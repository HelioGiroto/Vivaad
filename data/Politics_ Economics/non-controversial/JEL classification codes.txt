JEL classification codes Articles in economics journals are usually classified
according to the JEL classification codes, a system originated by the "Journal
of Economic Literature". The "JEL" is published quarterly by the American
Economic Association (AEA) and contains survey articles and information on
recently published books and dissertations. The AEA maintains EconLit, a
searchable data base of citations for articles, books, reviews, dissertations,
and working papers classified by JEL codes for the years from 1969. A recent
addition to EconLit is indexing of economics-journal articles from 1886 to 1968
parallel to the print series "Index of Economic Articles". JEL code
(sub)categories, including periodic updates, are referenced at Journal of
Economic Literature (JEL) Classification System. Definitions of (sub)categories
are at JEL Classification Codes Guide with corresponding examples of article
