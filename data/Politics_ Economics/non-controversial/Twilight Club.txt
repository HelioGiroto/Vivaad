Twilight Club The Twilight Club is an organization which was founded by Charles
Wingate in the late 19th century with the intention of countering the moral
decline of society by bolstering spiritual and ethical awareness. The Twilight
Club was inspired by the British philosopher Herbert Spencer. Although granted
honorary membership, in a letter to the Twilight Club, Spencer denied credit
for the group. The name of the club refers not only to the fact that their
meetings were held at the twilight of the day, but also to the evening twilight
of the 19th century and the dawn of the 20th century. Their stated purpose was
that of ethical and cultural renewal of their world.
