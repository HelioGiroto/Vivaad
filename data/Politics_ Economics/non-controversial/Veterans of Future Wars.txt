Veterans of Future Wars The manifesto spread nationwide as wire services
quickly picked up the group's press releases. Representative Claude Fuller of
Arkansas unwittingly increased the group's visibility by denouncing them on the
floor of the House. Soon local chapters began popping up at campuses throughout
the nation. Enthusiastic new members from as far away as North Dakota paid dues
to the main chapter in Princeton and adopted the organization's salute: arm
held out towards Washington with "hand outstretched, palm up and expectant" â€“
a mockery both of the World War I veterans, whom the founding Princetonians
viewed as freeloaders, and of the fascist salute then gaining currency in
Europe. The message of the organization had a rare appeal to both conservatives
and liberals. Conservatives saw them as kindred spirits in the effort to keep
Roosevelt from spending the country into bankruptcy. Pacifist liberals on the
other hand, saw the movement as an opportunity to satirize war itself. Real
veterans hated the movement. By June 1936, the Veterans of Future Wars reached
its peak membership of 50,000 paid members at 584 college campuses. By the next
school year, national attention focused on the Presidential campaign. The group
ceased operations in April 1937. Tragicomically, except for one student who was
hurt in an automobile accident, every one of the Princetonians who founded the
Veterans of Future Wars served in the armed forces of the United States in
World War II.
