Dirty subsidy A dirty subsidy is a payment or incentive by a government to a
private corporation (or another level of government) that encourages waste of
raw materials, natural resources, or energy, or results in pollution or other
human health hazards. Green economics often focuses on the impact of
eliminating such subsidies, and implementing what is sometimes called full cost
accounting although the notion of a "cost" is so political as to render this
phrase almost meaningless. Green politics focuses on actually eliminating the
subsidies by seeking change to agricultural policy and industrial policy, as
well as tax, tariff and trade rules that favor imports from jurisdictions that
offer such subsidies.
