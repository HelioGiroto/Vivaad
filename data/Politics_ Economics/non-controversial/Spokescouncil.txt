Spokescouncil A spokescouncil is a collection of affinity groups and clusters
(a collection of affinity groups), who meet together for a common purpose,
often civil disobedience. "Spokes" is short for "spokesperson", selected by
each affinity group of cluster to represent them in the spokescouncil. The
council usually makes decisions via a consensus decision making process.
Employment of spokescouncils within the United States occurred in Seattle,
during the WTO Ministerial Conference of 1999 protests and in San Francisco Bay
Area, leading up to "Day X" - the day-after the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003.
These took place under the network known as Direct Action to Stop the War
(DASW).
