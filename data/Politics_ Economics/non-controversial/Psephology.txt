Psephology Psephology (from Greek "psephos" ψῆφος, 'pebble', which the
Greeks used as ballots) is a branch of political science which deals with the
study and scientific analysis of elections. Psephology uses historical precinct
voting data, public opinion polls, campaign finance information and similar
statistical data. The term was coined in the United Kingdom in 1952 by
historian R. B. McCallum to describe the scientific analysis of past elections.
Applications. Psephology also has various applications specifically in
analysing the results of election returns for current indicators, as opposed to
predictive purposes. For instance, the Gallagher Index measures the
disproportionality of an election. Notable psephologists. Notable psephologists
include Australians Antony Green and Malcolm Mackerras (who devised the
Mackerras Pendulum); and Americans Michael Barone, who has published "The
Almanac of American Politics" biennially since 1972, Nate Silver whose website
FiveThirtyEight tracks US voting trends, and David Butler and Robert McKenzie,
who co-developed the swingometer. And notably, Charlie Cook, publisher of "The
Cook Political Report", which is an independent, non-partisan online newsletter
that analyzes elections and campaigns for the United States House of
Representatives, the United States Senate, Governor's offices and the American
Presidency.
