Bellum omnium contra omnes , a Latin phrase meaning "the war of all against
all", is the description that Thomas Hobbes gives to human existence in the
state of nature thought experiment that he conducts in "De Cive" (1642) and
"Leviathan" (1651). The common modern English usage is a war of "each against
all" where war is not commonly present. Hobbes' use. The thought experiment
places people in a pre-social condition, and theorizes what would happen in
such a condition. According to Hobbes, the outcome is that people choose to
enter a social contract, giving up some of their liberties in order to enjoy
peace. This thought experiment is a test for the legitimation of a state in
fulfilling its role as "sovereign" to guarantee social order, and for comparing
different types of states on that basis. Hobbes distinguishes between war and
battle: war does not only consist of actual battle; it points to the situation
in which one knows there is a 'will to contend by battle'. Later uses.
Sometimes the phrase is used by Marx and Engels.
