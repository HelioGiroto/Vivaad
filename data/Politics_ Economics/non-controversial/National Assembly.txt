National Assembly National Assembly is either a legislature, or the lower house
of a bicameral legislature in some countries. The best known National Assembly,
and the first legislature to be known by this title, was that established
during the French Revolution in 1789, known as the "Assemblée nationale".
Consequently, the name is particularly common in Francophone countries, but is
also found in some Commonwealth countries. In Germany, a Nationalversammlung
was elected following the revolutions of 1848–1849 and 1918–1919, to be
replaced by a permanent parliament (Reichstag) later. The legislature of the
Estado Novo regime in Portugal was dubbed National Assembly, while the Chamber
of Corporations was a purely advisory chamber. It was also the name of the
legislature during France's First Republic and the Consulate, and since 1946
has been the lower house of the French parliament, first under the Fourth
Republic, and from 1958, the Fifth Republic. The national assembly was also
defined in the Republic of China constitution. This is different from the
Legislative Yuan by the ROC constitution. In 2005, Taiwan revised the
constituion and national assembly becomes history.
