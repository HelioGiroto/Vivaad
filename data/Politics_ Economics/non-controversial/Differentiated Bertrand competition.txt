Differentiated Bertrand competition As a solution to the Bertrand paradox in
economics, it has been suggested that each firm produces a somewhat
differentiated product, and consequently faces a demand curve that is downward-
sloping for all levels of the firm's price. An increase in a competitor's price
is represented as an increase (for example, an upward shift) of the firm's
demand curve. As a result, when a competitor raises price, generally a firm can
also raise its own price and increase its profits. Calculating the
differentiated Bertrand model. The above figure presents the best response
functions of the firms, which are complements to each other. Uses. Merger
simulation models ordinarily assume differentiated Bertrand competition within
a market that includes the merging firms.
