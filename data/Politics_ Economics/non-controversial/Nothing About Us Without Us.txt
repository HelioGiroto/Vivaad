Nothing About Us Without Us "Nothing About Us Without Us!" (Latin: "Nihil de
nobis, sine nobis") is a slogan used to communicate the idea that no policy
should be decided by any representative without the full and direct
participation of members the group(s) affected by that policy. This involves
national, ethnic, disability-based, or other groups that are often thought to
be marginalized from political, social, and economic opportunities. The saying
in its Latin form has its origins in Central European foreign relations, and is
cited as a long standing principle of Hungarian law and foreign policy, and a
cornerstone of the foreign policy of interwar Poland. The term in its English
form came into use in disability activism during the 1990s. James Charlton
relates that he first heard the term used in talks by South African disability
activists Michael Masutha and William Rowland, who had in turn heard the phrase
used by an unnamed East European activist at an earlier international
disability rights conference. In 1998, Charlton used the saying as title for a
book on disability rights. The saying has since moved from the disability
rights movement to other interest group, identity politics, and populist
movements.
