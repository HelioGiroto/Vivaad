Jura Federation The Jura Federation was the federalist and anarchist section of
the International Workingmen's Association (also known as the First
International), based largely among watch-makers in the Jura mountain range in
Switzerland. The Jura federation was founded on October 9, 1870 at a meeting in
Saint-Imier of local sections of the IWA. It, along with other anarchist
sections, were expelled from the IWA after the Hague Congress (1872).
Anarchists in the Jura federation, like James Guillaume, would play a key role
in Peter Kropotkin's conversion to anarchism. In "Memoirs of a Revolutionist",
Kropotkin writes that "the egalitarian relations which I found in the Jura
Mountains, the independence of thought and expression which I saw developing in
the workers, and their unlimited devotion to the cause appealed far more
strongly to my feelings; and when I came away from the mountains, after a
week's stay with the watchmakers, my views upon socialism were settled. I was
an anarchist."
