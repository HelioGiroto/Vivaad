Bureaucrat A bureaucrat is a member of a bureaucracy and can comprise the
administration of any organization of any size, though the term usually
connotes someone within an institution of government. Bureaucrat jobs were
often "desk jobs" (the French for "desk" being "bureau", though bureau can also
be translated as "office"), though the modern bureaucrat may be found "in the
field" as well as in an office. History. Bureaucrats of the EU are frequently
termed "eurocrats" in the English language in Europe â€“ a portmanteau of the
European Union (or Europe), and bureaucrat. In Imperial China, bureaucrats
largely composed the social elite. Known in Europe as Mandarins, after the
Portuguese word for 'councillor', this variety of bureaucrats passed a set of
complicated examinations and were posted throughout the empire.
