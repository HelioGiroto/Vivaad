Social philosophy Social philosophy is the philosophical study of questions
about social behavior (typically, of humans). Social philosophy addresses a
wide range of subjects, from individual meanings to legitimacy of laws, from
the social contract to criteria for revolution, from the functions of everyday
actions to the effects of science on culture, from changes in human
demographics Subdisciplines. There is often a considerable overlap between the
questions addressed by social philosophy and ethics or value theory. Other
forms of social philosophy include political philosophy and jurisprudence,
which are largely concerned with the societies of state and government and
their functioning. Social philosophy, ethics, and political philosophy all
share intimate connections with other disciplines in the social sciences. In
turn, the social sciences themselves are of focal interest to the philosophy of
social science. The philosophy of language and social epistemology are
subfields which overlap in significant ways with social philosophy.
