Scottish Politician of the Year Scottish Politician of the Year is an annual
award established in 1999. It is held by "The Herald" newspaper in
Prestonfield, Edinburgh, Scotland. Although the awards ceremony has been held
once at the Royal Museum, Prestonfield House Hotel is considered to be the home
of the event. At the 2004 ceremony - held at the Prestonfield - former Labour
MSP and life peer Mike Watson, set fire to a curtain, and was subsequently
convicted of wilful fire raising. Not all of the subsidiary awards are handed
out every year.
