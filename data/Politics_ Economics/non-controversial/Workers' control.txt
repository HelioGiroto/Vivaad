Workers' control __NOTOC__ Workers' control is a term meaning participation in
the management of factories and other commercial enterprises by the people who
work there. It has been variously advocated by anarchists, socialists,
Communists, Social Democrats and Christian Democrats, and has been combined
with various socialist and mixed economy systems. Workers' councils are a form
of workers' control. Council communism, such as in the early Soviet Union
advocates workers' control through workers councils and factory committees.
Syndicalism advocates workers' control through trade unions. Guild socialism
advocates workers' control through a revival of the guild system. Participatory
economics represents a recent variation on the idea of workers' control.
Workers' control can be contrasted to control of the economy via the state,
such as nationalisation and central planning (see state socialism) and private
control of the means of production as found in capitalism.
