Susan Bernecker Susan S. Bernecker (born March 26, 1955) is a former Republican
candidate for the Jefferson Parish City Council in suburban New Orleans. She
was defeated 33% to 58% by Nick Giambelluca, nephew of the Jefferson Parish
election supervisor, Tony Giambelluca. After her loss and under the protection
of state law to inspect the voting machines, Bernecker went to the warehouse
where the Sequoia Pacific computers had been taken. There a producer videotaped
Bernecker as she pressed the button next to her name on the ballot which
registered the name of her opponent on a LED screen. Bernecker checked twelve
machines and her name appeared displayed only a third of the time. Bernecker
was a participant in the Hursti Hack held in Tallahassee, Florida, and featured
in Hacking Democracy, an HBO documentary on the errors of the Diebold Election
Systems Accu-Vote OS 1.94w (optical scan) voting machine.
