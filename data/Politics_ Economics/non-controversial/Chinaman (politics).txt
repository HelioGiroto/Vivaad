Chinaman (politics) Chinaman was an epithet for political mentors and backers
in the politics of Chicago, Illinois, U.S., in the 1900s. Although politically
incorrect, the term is still in use today. An example of the use of the term
appeared in the January 27, 2004 "Chicago Sun-Times": "Before the age of
political correctness, Munoz would have been called Torres' chinaman, and in
City Hall, that's still what they'd call him, but if you prefer, you can stick
with mentor or patron."
