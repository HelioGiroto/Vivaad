Economic graph The social science of economics makes extensive use graphs to
better illustrate the economic principles and trends it is attempting to
explain. Those graphs have specific qualities that are not often found (or are
not often found in such combinations) in other sciences. A common and specific
example is the Supply and Demand graph shown at right. This graph shows supply
and demand as opposing curves, and the intersection between those curves
determines the price point. An alteration of either supply or demand is shown
by displacing the curve towards or away the zero-line of the graph's X or Y
coordinates, and once this is done, the illustrated price points (P) and
matching quantity (Q) are altered (in the shown example, from P1 to P2 and from
Q1 to Q2). Economic graphs frequently present only in the first quadrant of the
Cartesian plane. Even though the axes refer to numeric variables, specific
values are seldom introduced. The economic analysis under discussion deals with
forces peculiar to the field of economics, and generally stops short of use of
hyperbolic coordinates. More generally, there is usually some underlying
mathematical model which underlies any given economic graph. For instance, the
commonly found supply and demand graph has its underpinnings in general price
theory - a highly mathematical discipline.
