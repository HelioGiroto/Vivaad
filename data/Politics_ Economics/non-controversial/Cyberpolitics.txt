Cyberpolitics Cyberpolitics is a term widely employed across the world, largely
by academics interesting in analyzing its breadth and scope, of the use of the
Internet for political activity. It embraces all forms of social software. It
includes journalism, fundraising, blogging, volunteer recruitment, and
organization building. The campaign of Howard Dean, in which a previously
unknown former Democratic governor of a small state emerged for a while as the
front runner for the 2004 Democratic Presidential nomination on the strength of
his campaign's skill in cyberpolitics, was a wake-up call to the American
political establishments of political parties around the United States as to
the importance of cyberpolitics as both a concept and as a series of
organizational and communications strategies. External Links for American
