Concord Principles Ralph Nader's Concord Principles were offered in 1992 as an
invitation to the Presidential candidates to improve civic dialogue and the
democratic institutions of the United States. They are written as 10 pleas
intended to avert a trend of corporatism in government, plutocratic influence,
banal sloganistic elections, power singularities and a popular sense of
political futility in political dialogue.
