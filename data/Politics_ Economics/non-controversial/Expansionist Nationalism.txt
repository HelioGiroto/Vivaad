Expansionist nationalism Expansionist nationalism is an aggressive and radical
form of nationalism that incorporates autonomous, patriotic sentiments with a
belief in expansionism. The term was coined during the late nineteenth century
as European powers indulged in the 'Scramble for Africa' in the name of
national glory, but has been most associated with militarist governments during
the 20th century including Nazi Germany and the Japanese empire. The American
notion of Manifest Destiny is also oft-cited as an example. Ideology. What
distinguishes expansionist nationalism from liberal nationalism is its
acceptance of chauvinism, a belief in superiority or dominance. Nations are
thus not thought to be equal to their right to self-determination; rather some
nations are believed to possess characteristics or qualities that make them
superior to others. Expansionist nationalism therefore asserts the state's
right to increase its borders at the expense of its neighbours.
