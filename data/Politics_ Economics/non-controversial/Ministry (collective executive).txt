Ministry (collective executive) A ministry (usually preceded by the definite
article, i.e., the ministry) refers to a collective body of government
ministers headed by a prime minister or premier. It is described by the Oxford
Dictionary as "a period of government under one prime minister”. Although the
term "cabinet" can in some circumstances be a synonym, a ministry can be a
broader concept which might include office-holders that do not participate in
cabinet meetings. Other titles can include “administration” (in the United
States) or “government” (in common usage among most parliamentary systems)
to describe similar collectives. The term is primarily used to describe the
successive governments of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia and New
Zealand, which share a common parliamentary political heritage. In these
countries (except Canada and New Zealand), a new ministry begins after each
election, regardless of whether the Prime Minister remains the same. For
example, after winning the 1979 general election, Margaret Thatcher, as Prime
Minister of the United Kingdom, began the First Thatcher Ministry. After wining
the 1983 general election, she began the Second Thatcher Ministry, and so on.
As head of the collective ministry, from 1911 to 1933, the official title of
the prime minister of Portugal was that of President of the Ministry
(Portuguese "Presidente do Ministério'’).
