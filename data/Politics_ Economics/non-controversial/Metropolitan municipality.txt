Metropolitan municipality A metropolitan municipality is a type of municipality
established in some countries to serve a metropolitan area. Canada. In generic
terms, and in practical application within Canada, a metropolitan municipality
is an urban local government; or at least a suburban government flanked by
urban and/or other suburban counties. Conversely, a rural area (or a suburban
area flanked mostly by rural areas) in which county and municipal functions are
consolidated in one government is not a metropolitan municipality but a
regional municipality. The most typical distinction, in historical terms, is
that a metropolitan municipality is usually a consolidation of one urban city
and the county in which it is located. A "regional" municipality, by contrast,
is usually a consolidation of two or more suburban and/or rural cities, towns
or villages - each of which remains a geographically distinct area, usually
because of greenspace between them - and the county in which they are located.
