Consumer sovereignty Consumer sovereignty is a term used in economics. It
refers to consumers determining the production of goods. The term can prescribe
what consumers should be permitted, or describe what consumers are permitted.
The term was coined by William Hutt in his 1936 book "Economists and the
Public". In unrestricted markets, those with income or wealth are able to use
their purchasing power to motivate producers. Customers do not necessarily have
to buy and, if dissatisfied, can take their business elsewhere, while the
profit-seeking sellers find that they can make the greatest profit by providing
the best possible products for the price (or the lowest possible price for a
given product). To most neoclassical economists, complete consumer sovereignty
is an ideal rather than a reality because of market failure. Some economists of
the Chicago school and the Austrian school see consumer sovereignty as a
reality in a free market economy without interference from government or other
non-market institutions, or anti-market institutions such as monopolies or
cartels. That is, alleged market failures are seen as the result of non-market
forces.
