Red Falcons Red Falcons was the name of various socialist youth organizations,
popular in Europe and the United States, especially between the first and
second world wars, but of which many are still active today. The first such
group was founded in the early 20th century by Anton Tesarek, a socialist
educator from Austria, under the name "Rote Falken." The origin of the name is
unclear; one possible explanation is that the Falcon is a bird of prey with no
imperial links (the eagle was the symbol of the German empire, adopted later by
the Nazis.) It is red to symbolise socialism. They were structured in a manner
analogous to that of Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts, and had their own distinct
uniforms. The American Red Falcons had two divisions, the "Young Falcons"
(sometimes called "Red Sparks"), ages 8–11; and the "Red Falcons" proper,
ages 11–15. They were led by older mentors recruited from the ranks of the
Young People's Socialist League (YPSL). Right-wing observers accused some of
these groups of acting as "private armies" taking orders from Moscow, but this
may have been either paranoia or fear-mongering. International Falcon Movement.
The various national Red Falcon organizations are generally members of the
International Falcon Movement - Socialist Education International. The Red
Falcons of America joined IFM-SEI in 1936 but have since folded.
