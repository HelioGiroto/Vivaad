Democratic empire A democratic empire is a political state which conducts its
"internal" affairs democratically (i.e. with respect for its citizens and their
collective will) but "externally" its policies have a striking resemblance to
imperial rule. Democratic imperialism as such may in fact be a contradiction in
terms as empires express themselves with aggression abroad and repression at
home. The concept of a democratic empire can likewise be an instrument of
social control as with ideology and ideological conditioning generally. Example
of empires that have been described in this way are the British Empire and the
United States of America based on some of its foreign affairs history (see
American Empire).
