Media activism Media activism is activism that uses media and communication
technologies for social movement, and/or tries to change policies relating to
media and communication (media policy activism). It includes publishing news on
web sites, creating video and audio investigations, spreading information about
protests, and organizing campaigns relating to media and communications policy.
Attempts by grassroots activists and anarchists to use alternative media to
spread information not available by mainstream news are also called media
activism, as are certain forms of politically motivated hacking and net-based
campaigns. Culture Jamming is another form of media activism. It's seen as a
strategy of rhetorical protest. Speciﬁcally, “pranksters” deploy the
tools of the mass media and marketing in order to take advantage of the
resources and venues they afford. Through the concept of “pranking,” it's
suggested that the most promising forms of media activism may resist less
through negation and opposition than by playfully appropriating commercial
rhetoric both by folding it over on itself and exaggerating its tropes.
