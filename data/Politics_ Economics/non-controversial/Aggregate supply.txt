Aggregate supply In economics, aggregate supply is the total supply of goods
and services that firms in a national economy plan on selling during a specific
time period. It is the total amount of goods and services that firms are
willing to sell at a given price level in an economy. Analysis. AS is targeted
by government "supply side policies" which are meant to increase productivity
efficiency and national output. For example, education and training and
research and development. Different scopes. In a standard aggregate supply
demand model, the output (Y) is the x axis and price (P) is the y axis. An
increase in aggregate demand shifts the AD curve rightward, bringing the
equilibrium point horizontally along the SRAS until it reaches the new AD. This
point is the short run equilibrium. References. Krugman book, essentials of
economics
