Marginal seat A marginal seat or swing seat is a constituency held with a small
majority in a legislative election, generally one conducted under a single-
winner voting system. In Canada, they may be known as target ridings. The
opposite is a safe seat. These seats only require a small swing to change hands
and therefore are typically the focus of most campaign resources. The
concentration of money and manpower in areas where they will make the most
difference is known as targeting. Strategies for securing swing seats. The
creation of policy that will benefit a particular seat, at the expense of other
taxpayers, is known as pork barreling. Political parties often face tension
between the holders of marginal seats and safe seats. Safe seats tend to be
allocated far less discretionary resources—governmental as well as
political—from their political party than do marginal seats. A similar
phenomenon happens in United States presidential elections, where the Electoral
College system means that candidates must win states rather than votes. Again,
resources are concentrated towards the swing states with the smallest
majorities.
