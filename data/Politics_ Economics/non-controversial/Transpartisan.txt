Transpartisan Transpartisanship represents an emerging field in political
thought distinct from bipartisanship, which aims to negotiate between
“right” and “left,” resulting in a dualistic perspective, and
nonpartisanship, which tends to avoid political affiliation altogether. Rather,
transpartisanship acknowledges the validity of truths across a range of
political perspectives and seeks to synthesize them into an inclusive,
pragmatic container beyond typical political dualities. In practice,
transpartisan solutions emerge out of a new kind of public conversation that
moves beyond polarization by applying proven methods of facilitated dialogue,
deliberation and conflict resolution. In this way it is possible to achieve the
ideal of a democratic republic by integrating the values of a
democracy—freedom, equality, and a regard for the common good, with the
values of a republic—order, responsibility and security. Current examples of
transpartisan initiatives include WinWinRevolution.org, Reuniting
America,Transpartisan Alliance, Liberty Coalition. A close relative of
transpartisanship is Integral politics. A transpartisan approach to policy
would necessarily include individual and collective, as well as subjective and
objective, perspective. Furthermore, similar to Integral theory,
transpartisanship places politics in a developmental context, viewing democracy
and prosperity not as static attainments, but rather emergent properties along
a continuum of developmental stages.
