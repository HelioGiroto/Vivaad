Cleavage (politics) Cleavage in political science is a concept used in voting
analysis and is the division of voters into voting blocs. The preliminary
assumption is that voters donâ€™t come in predefined groups of pros and cons
for or against a certain subject. Ballot analysis assumes that voters opt for a
certain party, or decide for the solution or option that comes closest to their
own position. Cleavage separates the voters into advocates and adversaries on a
certain issue, or voting for a certain party. If you imagine parties on a
horizontal line for a certain issue, cleavage is the vertical line that divides
the parties into supporters and opponents of the issue. Examples. There are
probably as many cleavages in society as diverse members, but Seymour Martin
Lipset and Stein Rokkan (1967) defined four basic clevages for western
civilization after the Industrial Revolution. According to Lipset and Rokkan,
these cleavages determined the emergence and the content of all European
parties. Contemporary ballot analysis speaks of the emergence of new cleavages.
The traditional opposition between Owner and Worker (Capital and Work) is being
differentiated further among those who have work/ are employable and those who
are not. Further, sex becomes another cleavage, especially in regard to getting
and maintaining a paid labour position.
