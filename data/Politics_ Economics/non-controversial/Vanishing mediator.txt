Vanishing mediator A vanishing mediator is a concept that exists to mediate
between two opposing ideas, as a transition occurs between them. At the point
where one idea has been replaced by the other, and the concept is no longer
required, the mediator vanishes. In terms of Hegelian dialectics the conflict
between the theoretical abstraction and its empirical negation (through trial
and error) is resolved by a concretion of the two ideas, representing a
theoretical abstraction taking into account the previous contradiction,
whereupon the mediator vanishes. In terms of psychoanalytic theory, when
someone is caught in a dilemma they experience Hysteria. A conceptual deadlock
exists until the resulting Hysteric breakdown precipitates some kind of
resolution, therefore the Hysteria is a vanishing mediator in this case. In
terms of political history, it refers to social movements, which operate in a
particular way to influence politics, until they either are forgotten or change
their purpose. It is a concept that was originally described by Fredric
Jameson:- In The Ideologies of Theory, a two volume compilation of his essays,
Jameson first defines the instance of "textual unconscious" outlined by Jacques
Lacan, before the general idea of "a vanishing mediator". Since, this concept
has been adopted by Žižek in "For They Know Not What They Do: Enjoyment as a
Political factor", where he uses it in a political sense, similar to Marx's
Analysis of Revolution.
