Sultanism Sultanism, another name for "Despotism", is a form of authoritarian
government characterized by the extreme personal presence of the ruler in all
elements of governance. The ruler may or may not be present in economic or
social life, and thus there may be pluralism in these areas, but this is never
true of political power. The term "Sultanism" is derived from the word
"Sultan", which is a title used in Muslim societies for a sovereign or absolute
monarch. The Sultan was traditionally a secular office, unlike the Caliphate,
and thus the term "Sultanism" should not be deemed anti-Islamic. Some Sultans
were constitutional monarchs. According to Juan Linz & Alfred Stepan: In
Sultanism, the sultan may or may not adopt a ruling ideology but is never bound
by any rules or given ideology, even his own. The sultan may also use whatever
forces he can to exercise his personal will, such as para-militaries or gangs.
The clearest examples of Sultanism are "Haiti under the Duvaliers, the
Dominican Republic under Trujillo, the Central African Republic under Bokassa,
the Philippines under Marcos, Romania under Ceau≈üescu, and North Korea under
Kim Il Sung." (Linz & Stepan, "Modern Nondemocratic Regimes").
