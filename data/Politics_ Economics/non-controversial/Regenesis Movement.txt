Regenesis (non-profit organization) Regenesis is an environmental and social
justice activist group founded in Toronto, Ontario, Canada in 2007 by a group
of student activists, including Claudia Rodriguez and Mike Kenny. The group has
chapters at university campuses across Canada. The group had members stand as
candidates for the 2008 Canadian Youth Parliamentary Elections from their
various campus clubs at universities across Canada. In 2008, they organized an
'all cause rally' in Toronto, inspired by the Free Speech Movement at the
University of California, Berkeley in the 1960s. Regenesis held a launch party
that took place on June 5, 2008 that was hosted by Frank De Jong, leader of the
Green Party of Ontario. Anti-Fluoridation. Regenesis is the only national non-
profit advocating for the removal of fluoride, which they view as an important
environmental health issue, under the campaign name Vote OUT Fluoride. In 2009,
their anti-fluoridation campaign in Thunder Bay helped convince Thunder Bay
City Council to vote against fluoridating Thunder Bay's water supply. They have
been lobbying Toronto City Council, along with other member organizations of
the Toronto Coalition Against Fluoridation, to halt the practice of adding
Hexafluorosilicic acid to Toronto's drinking water.
