Rosenberg Fund for Children The Rosenberg Fund for Children (RFC) is a public
foundation started in 1990 by Robert Meeropol and named in honor of his parents
Ethel and Julius Rosenberg, the only two United States civilians executed for
conspiracy to commit espionage during the Cold War. Orphaned at age 6, Robert
was adopted by Anne and Abel Meeropol. At a fundraiser on the 50th anniversary
of his parents' execution, Robert described the fund, which he runs, as his
"constructive revenge." The fund "makes grants to aid children in the U.S.
whose parents are targeted, progressive activists" and to "assist youth who
themselves have been targeted as a result of their progressive activities."
They do not pay for legal expenses. , the organization has given over $3.4
million in grants to more than 400 children since 1990.
