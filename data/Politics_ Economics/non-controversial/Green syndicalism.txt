Green syndicalism Green syndicalism or eco-syndicalism has been used as a name
for the philosophy of the green guild or sustainable trades movement.
Background. It is related to anarcho-syndicalism and eco-anarchism
methodologically, but lacks specifically anarchism and Marxism as ideologies.
(However, the term has also been used by those embracing both anarchism and
syndicalism, such as authors Graham Purchase and Jeff Shantz). Its methods are
a fusion of the trade union, more robust methods from formal syndicalism, and
the direct action and workplace democracy movements (the most prominent
proponent of green syndicalism is the IWW). It may work closely with green
movement and fair trade groups. However, it does not usually adopt the larger
political goals of these movements. It is more likely to be an outgrowth of
craft and heritage worker movements, e.g. to preserve wooden ship building, or
traditional organic ranching methods. The links to eco-anarchism and that
movement's Walden-esque philosophy has led to a belief that green syndicalists
are closely related to the back-to-the-land, survivalist, or hippie movements,
or to ethical traditions that resemble those movements such as Mennonites and
the Amish, especially for their focus on appropriate technology. Green
syndicalists are, however, often willing to adopt new technologies, and to work
with other, similar groups worldwide.
