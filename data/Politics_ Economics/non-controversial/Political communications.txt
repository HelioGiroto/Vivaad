Political communications Political communication is a subfield of communication
and political science that is concerned with how information spreads and
influences politics. Since the advent of the World Wide Web, the amount of data
to analyze has exploded, and researchers are shifting to computational methods
to study the dynamics of political communication. In recent years, machine
learning, natural language processing, and network analysis have become key
tools in the subfield.
