Mandate (politics) In politics, a mandate is the authority granted by a
constituency to act as its representative. The concept of a government having a
legitimate mandate to govern via the fair winning of a democratic election is a
central idea of democracy. New governments who attempt to introduce policies
that they did not make public during an election campaign are said to not have
a legitimate "mandate" to implement such policies. Elections, especially ones
with a large margin of victory, are often said to give the newly elected
government or elected official a mandate to put into effect certain policies.
Also, the period during which a government serves between elections is often
referred to as a mandate and when the government seeks re-election it is said
to be seeking a "new mandate". In some languages, a 'mandate' can mean a
parliamentary seat won in an election.
