Socialist Worker (Aotearoa) Socialist Worker (SW) was a socialist organisation
based in Aotearoa/New Zealand. SW evolved out of the group known as the
Socialist Workers Organization, the successor organisation of the Communist
Party of New Zealand. It had two main branches in Auckland and Wellington, but
activists in most other cities in NZ. Recently, it began to grow modestly
through work done in workers' organisations such as the Solidarity Union, Unite
Union, the Climate Change Coalition Climaction, the anti-war movement and the
Venezuela Aotearoa Solidarity Team. Many of its key activists were involved in
the Residents Action Movement, which polled over 87,000 votes in the 2004
Auckland Regional Council elections. It published a quarterly themed journal
called "UNITY", and its activists contributed to the monthly "Workers' Charter"
paper. It also had a regularly updated blog called "UnityAotearoa". SW's
national conference in February 2007 adopted a new ten point "Where We Stand"
programme. SW was part of the International Socialist Tendency (IST). On May 1
2007, it presented a May Day Statement to the IST, calling for a positive
engagement with the Venezuelan Revolution. A number of SW members split from
the organisation in 2008 to form Socialist Aotearoa. SW voted to dissolve
itself at its conference in January 2012. Its ex-members went on to participate
in the EcoSocialist Network.
