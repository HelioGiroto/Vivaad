Black Front The Black Front (formally known as the "Kampfgemeinschaft
Revolutionärer Nationalsozialisten", "Combat League Of Revolutionary National
Socialists" or KGRNS) was a group formed by Otto Strasser after his expulsion
from the Nazi Party (NSDAP) in 1930. Strasser believed the original anti-
capitalist nature of the NSDAP had been betrayed by Adolf Hitler. The Black
Front was composed of former radical members of the NSDAP, who intended to
cause a split in the main party. Strasser's organisation published a newspaper,
'The German Revolution' and adopted the crossed hammer and sword symbol which
is still used by several Strasserite groupings today. The organisation was
unable to oppose the NSDAP effectively, and Hitler’s rise to power proved to
be the final straw. Strasser spent the years of the Third Reich in exile, first
in Czechoslovakia and later in Canada. The left-wing of the party itself was
eradicated in 1934 during 'The Night of the Long Knives', in which Gregor
Strasser, Otto’s elder brother, was killed.
