10 agorot controversy The ten agorot controversy was a conspiracy theory in
1988 in which Palestine Liberation Organization chairman Yasser Arafat claimed
that the obverse design of an Israeli coin worth ten agorot showed a map of
"Greater Israel" that represented Zionist expansionist goals. The Bank of
Israel maintains that the 10 agorot design was selected for its historical
value, and "was closely patterned after a coin issued in 37â€“40 BC by
Mattathias Antigonus II, the last Hasmonean King". The design, by Nathan Karp,
first appeared on the 100 shekel coin issued by the Bank of Israel on May 2,
1984. When the old shekel currency was replaced by the new shekel in September
1985, the design was copied to the new 10 agorot coin, which was equal in value
to the old 100 shekel. This design was also adopted as the symbol of the Bank
of Israel.
