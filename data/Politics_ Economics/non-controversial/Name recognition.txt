Name recognition Name recognition is a concept used in politics to describe the
number of people who are aware of a politician. It is considered an important
factor in elections, as candidates with low name recognition are unlikely to
receive votes from people who only casually follow politics. Name recognition
is also considered a major obstacle for challengers hoping to defeat
incumbents. Incumbents are politicians who have already been elected to a
particular office, and are now running for re-election to that same office. By
definition, the fact that incumbents are already in office gives them name
recognition. This proves to be a huge advantage over most challengers. There
are multiple ways candidates can increase their name recognition during the
campaign. Radio and television advertisements are very effective. Additionally,
yard signs can increase name recognition.
