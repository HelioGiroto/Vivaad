Revolution from above A revolution from above refers to major political and
social changes that are imposed by an elite on the population it dominates. By
contrast, the plain term revolution suggests that pressure from below is a
major driving force in events, even if other social groups cooperate with —
or ultimately capture —the movement. The phrase was coined by the Spanish
writer Joaquín Costa in the 19th century. In contrast, a "revolution from
below" refers to a grassroots campaign against elites. See also. " Revolution

Peru", a 1978 book written by Ellen Kay Trimberger, published by Transaction
