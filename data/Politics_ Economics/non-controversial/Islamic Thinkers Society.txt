Islamic Thinkers Society The Islamic Thinkers Society is a Muslim group based
in New York City that seeks the goal of restoring the Islamic Caliphate to
create what they call "an ideal Islamic society." They are located mainly in
Jackson Heights, Queens, New York City, United States. Islamic Thinkers Society
is an offshoot of Al-Muhajiroun, a pro Al-Qaeda British Islamist extremist
group. Platform. The group states they wish to see a reversal of the Balfour
Declaration, Sykes-Picot Agreement and San Remo conference. They allege these
agreements are part of 'Colonialist Designs' on the Islamic world, and they
urge Muslims to consider them illegal, null and void. The group calls for an
end to what it says are "Colonialist-Imposed Borders," "Colonialist-Imposed
States," and "Colonialist-Imposed Rulers." They also show dislike for Jews,
Christians, homosexuals and Shi'ites. ITS calls on Muslims to oppose the United
States, Christianity and Western society and culture, especially homosexuality,
which they see as Western. ITS is also notable for its hostility to Shi'ites
whom they view as not true Muslims. Controversy. ITS is suspected of being an
American offshoot of the London-based Al-Muhajiroun, a group that celebrated
the 9/11 attacks, referring to the hijackers as "the Magnificent 19," and
posted a burning picture of the United States Capitol on its website. The
Islamic Thinkers Society also used to fly the Al-Muhajiroun flag and
distributed Al-Muhajiroun tracts. The Anti-Defamation League called ITS "a
pseudonym or an offshoot of the British-based Al Muhajiroun, a now-disbanded
radical Islamic group that supported terrorism and the imposition of Islamic
hegemony worldwide." In the CNN program "ParkerSpitzer", the ex-leader of Al-
Muhajiroun, Anjem Choudary, was interviewed with the title "heinous terrorist"
and linked to militant groups like Al-Qaeda. Choudary however, denounced these
allegations in a press release on his personal website. The ITS organization
have also published a press release in response to the CNN interview supporting
Al-Muhajiroun's former leader Anjem Choudary, but denouncing links to violence
in a similar fashion, stating "as the struggle ITS is always intellectual and
political." When they still called themselves Al-Muhajiroun, they held an event
at Queensborough Community College, during which a Al-Muhajiroun speaker said,
"We reject the U.N., reject America, reject all law and order. Don't lobby
Congress or protest because we don't recognize Congress! The only relationship
you should have with America is to topple it!" Observers such as the
Intelligence Summit have called the Islamic Thinkers Society a Fundamentalist
Islamic group. Before he founded Revolution Muslim, Yousef al Khattab was the
chief ideologue of the Islamic Thinkers Society. Bryant Neal Vinas, a Hispanic
Catholic convert to Islam from Long Island who was convicted of participating
in and supporting Al-Qaeda plots in Afghanistan and the U.S., moved in Islamic
Thinkers Society circles in New York before he left the U.S. CNN reported that
followers of the Islamic Thinkers Society helped radicalize Vinas and helped
him connect with Islamist militants in Pakistan. Activities. The group is based
in the largely immigrant community of the Jackson Heights neighborhood in
Queens, New York City but operates in the wider New York area. It is composed
mainly of second-generation young Arab, Indian, Bangladeshi and Pakistani
Muslim immigrants with a few converts. Press Release. Press Release 10.31.2010:
