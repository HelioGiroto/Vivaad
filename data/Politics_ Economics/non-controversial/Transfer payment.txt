Transfer payment In economics, a transfer payment (or government transfer or
simply transfer) is a redistribution of income in the market system. These
payments are considered to be exhaustive because they do not directly absorb
resources or create output. In other words, the transfer is made without any
exchange of goods or services. Examples of certain transfer payments include
welfare (financial aid), social security, and government making subsidies for
certain businesses (firms). Use for administrative transfer. In some federal
systems the term can be also used to refer to payments from one order of to a
government to another; for example in Canada, transfer payments usually refer
to a system of payments from the federal government to the provinces. Major
Canadian transfer payments include equalization payments, the Canada Health
Transfer and the Canada Social Transfer (formerly the Canada Health and Social
Transfer) and Territorial Formula Financing. Transfer payments are not a part
of the national income so they are cut from national income to get n.n.p in
order to arrive national income such payments are bad debts incurred by banks,
payments of pensions, charity, scholarships etc. In the UK they have several
transfer payments such as EMA and a job seeker's allowance.
