Regional state In political geography, a regional state is a state more
centralized than a federation, but less centralized than a unitary state.
Regional states include federations in which power has become more centralized,
and unitary states in which some power has been devolved to regional
governments. This term has yet to become widely used. Subnational regions are
intermediate level between local and national government.
