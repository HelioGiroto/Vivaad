Unitary state A unitary state is a state governed as one single unit in which
the central government is supreme and any administrative divisions (subnational
units) exercise only powers that their central government chooses to delegate.
The great majority of states in the world have a unitary system of government.
Devolution (like federation) may be symmetrical, with all subnational units
having the same powers and status, or asymmetric, with regions varying in their
powers and status.
