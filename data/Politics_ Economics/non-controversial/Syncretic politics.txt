Syncretic politics Syncretic politics or spectral-syncretic is used to refer to
politics outside of the conventional left-right political spectrum, the term is
used by some scholars to describe the political nature of fascism. The Falange
of Spain presented itself as syncretic. Falangism has attacked both the left
and the right as its "enemies", declaring itself to be neither left nor right,
but a third position.
