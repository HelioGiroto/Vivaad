Liberalism in Colombia This article gives an overview of liberalism in
Colombia. It is limited to liberal parties with substantial support, mainly
proved by having had a representation in parliament. The sign â‡’ means a
reference to another party in that scheme. For inclusion in this scheme it is
not necessary for the parties to have labeled themselves as a liberal party.
Introduction. Liberalism in Colombia is organized as the opposition to
conservatism. The Colombian Liberal Party, founded in 1849, still exists as a
dominant party, usually achieving the largest voter turnouts and electoral
victories in congress and regional elections. It has also been a strong
contender in recent presidential elections. It joined the Socialist
International, despite historically being considered a party relatively left of
center and somewhat prone to populism, according to some critics. Its
traditional position can be considered to be somewhere in the middle between
liberalism and social democracy. Several current leaders of the party in the
late 20th and early 21st centuries claim to be seeking to move the party closer
to the social democratic left.
