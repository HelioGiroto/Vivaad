Alan Placa Monsignor Alan Placa is a priest in good standing employed by
Giuliani Partners, a management consulting and security consulting business
founded by high school friend Rudy Giuliani, former New York City Mayor. Placa
was temporarily placed on an administrative leave of absence by the Catholic
church following an accusation of misconduct. Subsequently, a grand jury
published a report accusing him of misconduct in sexually molesting numerous
children and for covering up molestation by other priests. No charges were
subsequently filed. He was subsequently cleared of all charges by a U.S. Church
tribunal and that action was upheld by the Vatican. Giuliani and Placa
reportedly have been close friends since childhood. Placa was best man at
Giuliani's wedding to second-cousin Regina Peruggi and then assisted Giuliani
in getting that marriage annulled over the objections of his wife so that he
could marry girlfriend Donna Hannover.
