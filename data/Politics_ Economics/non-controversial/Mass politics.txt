Mass politics Mass politics is a political order resting on the emergence of
mass political parties. The emergence of mass politics generally associated
with the rise of mass society coinciding with the Industrial Revolution in the
West around the time of President Andrew Jackson. However, because of the
extent of popular participation in the Protestant Reformation, it has been
called the first mass political movement, which "other ideologies, ultimately
more secular in tone" superseded. Mass politics was essentially the inclusion
of the masses in the political process. There was a major rise in this from
1880 to 1914. This was when the vote in Europe was expanded to all men and in
some countries even some women were allowed to vote.
