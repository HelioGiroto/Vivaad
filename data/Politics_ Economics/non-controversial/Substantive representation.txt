Substantive representation Substantive representation (in contrast to
descriptive representation) is a concept in the legislative branches of
representative republics describing the tendency of representatives to advocate
for certain groups. Often, their area of advocacy is in contrast to their
background, such as late U.S. Senator Edward Kennedy's advocacy for the poor;
Kennedy was a scion of one of the richest families in Massachusetts.
Constituents vote for representatives by looking at policy stances and past
efforts as a representative.
