Social finance Social finance is an approach to managing money that delivers a
social dividend and an economic return. Social finance includes community
investing, microlending, social impact bonds, and sustainable business and
social enterprise lending. Outcome-based philanthropic grantmaking and program-
related investments - sometimes referred to as venture philanthropy- also fall
under the umbrella of social finance. These approaches to investment and
funding share the twin focus of stimulating positive social and environmental
returns for investors and the larger world. Some social investors even try to
affect an environmental return, which is referred to as a regard for a
‘triple bottom line’.
