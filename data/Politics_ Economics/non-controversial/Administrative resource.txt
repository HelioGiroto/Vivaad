Administrative resource Administrative resource is the ability of political
candidates (and parties) to use their official positions or connections to
government institutions to influence the outcome of elections. The term is
widely used in Russia and other former USSR countries, because the practice is
widespread, is well known and is openly discussed by public and media. In these
countries, the administrative resource is one of the major factors in most
elections. Similar practices are used to a varying degree all over the world,
including countries that are usually considered democratic. The administrative
resource is only one part that determines the election outcome. Two other major
factors are the ideology (candidate's agenda) and the use of political
technologies (PR, campaign organisation, etc.).
