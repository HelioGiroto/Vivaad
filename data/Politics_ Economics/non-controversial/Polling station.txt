Polling place A polling place or polling station is where voters cast their
ballots in elections. Since elections generally take place over a one- or two-
day span on a periodic basis, often annual or longer, polling places are often
located in facilities used for other purposes, such as schools, churches,
sports halls, local government offices, or even private homes, and will each
serve a similar number of people. The area may be known as a ward, precinct,
polling district or constituency. The polling place is staffed with officials
(who may be called election judges, returning officers or other titles) who
monitor the voting procedures and assist voters with the election process.
Scrutineers (or poll-watchers) are independent or partisan observers who attend
the poll to ensure the impartiality of the process. The facility will be open
between specified hours depending upon the type of election, and political
activity by or on behalf of those standing in the ballot is usually prohibited
within the venue and immediately surrounding area. Inside the polling place
will be an area (usually a voting booth) where the voter may select the
candidate or party of their choice in secret, and if a ballot paper is used
this will be placed into a ballot box in front of witnesses but who cannot see
the actual selection made. Voting machines may be employed instead. Some
polling places are temporary structures. A portable cabin may be specially
sited for an election and removed afterwards.
