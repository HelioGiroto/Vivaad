Street protester "Street protesting" is a form of individual public
demonstration, more prevalent in larger cities. Characteristically, street
protesters work alone, gravitating towards areas of high foot traffic, and
employing handmade such as sandwich boards or picket signs in order to maximize
exposure and interaction with the public. Courthouses and other government
offices are favorite locations, used as a dramatic backdrop to highlight the
particular issues or injustices (often of a highly personal nature) with which
the demonstrator is concerned. Whether by choice or circumstance, street
protesters are often homeless. They are often described as a "fixture" of the
landscape or local flavor, due to the visibility afforded by their unusual
degree of dedication.
