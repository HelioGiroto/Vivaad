Preference The term preferences is used in a variety of related, but not
identical, ways in the scientific literature. This makes it necessary to make
explicit the sense in which the term is used in different social sciences. In
psychology, preferences could be conceived of as an individual’s attitude
towards a set of objects, typically reflected in an explicit decision-making
process (Lichtenstein & Slovic, 2006). Alternatively, one could interpret the
term “preference” to mean evaluative judgment in the sense of liking or
disliking an object (e.g., Scherer, 2005) which is the most typical definition
employed in psychology. However, it does not mean that a preference is
necessarily stable over time. Preference can be notably modified by decision-
making processes, such as choices (Brehm, 1956; Sharot, De Martino, & Dolan,
2009), even in an unconscious way (see Coppin, Delplanque, Cayeux, Porcherot, &
Sander, 2010). "Preference" may also refer to non-choices, such as genetic and
biological explanations for one's preference. Sexual orientation, for example,
is no longer considered a sexual preference by most individuals, but is
debatable based on philosophical and/or scientific ideas.
