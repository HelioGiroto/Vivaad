Party political broadcast A party political broadcast (also known as a party
election broadcast or party conference broadcast depending on the date of
broadcast) is a short television or radio broadcast made by a political party.
In the United Kingdom, political advertising on television or radio is illegal,
but parties are instead allocated broadcast slots across the traditional
terrestrial TV channels. On a given day, a given party will be allowed to
broadcast a piece about five minutes long. A similar format exists in the
Republic of Ireland, though due to more smaller parties being represented in
the Dáil Éireann time given to those smaller parties may be as little as one
or two minutes.
