Rhythms of resistance The RoR-bands are often referred to as the 'samba-bands',
although many bands incorporate instruments and rhythms from outside of the
samba genre. RoR has similarities to the Afro Bloc parading drum bands that
emerged in the mid 1970s in Salvador da Bahia in Brazil . Bands such as Ilê
Aiyê and Olodum formed as a political expression of black awareness, resisting
economic exclusion. Coming out of some impoverished urban communities, Afro
blocs became a mobilising focus on picket lines and marches. Rhythms of
Resistance formed as part of the UK Earth First action against the
International Monetary Fund/World Bank Meeting in Prague in September 2000. A
Pink and Silver carnival bloc, focused around a 55 piece band, detached itself
from a march of 67.000 and outmanoeuvered police resources defending the IMF
annual summit. The protests also included a black bloc and a group from the
Italian Ya Basta movement, and led to the shutting down of the summit.
Following this event, similar groups formed elsewhere making use of the same
tactics. The Amsterdam band formed in for the Rising Tide Actions against the
Cop6 Climate Conference in November 2000 and joined together with 10 drummers
from Rhythms of Resistance to form a 65 piece band. Rhythms of Resistance
groups can now be found across Europe and in North America.
