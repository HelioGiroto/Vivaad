Political socialization Political socialization is a concept concerning the
“study of the developmental processes by which children and adolescents
acquire political cognition, attitudes, and behaviors”. It refers to a
learning process by which norms and behavior acceptable to a well running
political system are transmitted from one generation to another. It is through
the performance of this function in which individuals are inducted into the
political culture and their orientations towards political objects are formed.
Agents of Socialization. These Agents of Socialization all influence in one
degree or another an individual's political opinions: Family, Media, Peers,
Education, Religion, Race, Gender, Age and Geography. These factors and many
others that people are introduced to as they are growing up will affect their
political views throughout the rest of their lives. Political beliefs are often
formed during childhood, as parents pass down their ideologies to their
children.
