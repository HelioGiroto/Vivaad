Stateless nation The term stateless nation is used of ethnic groups which are
not the majority population in any nation stateÂ and for whom it is implied
that they "should have" such a state. As such, the term expresses irredentism.
Stateless nations are either dispersed across a number of states (for example,
the Kurdish people are found in Iraq, Turkey, Iran, Armenia and Syria), or they
form the native population of a province within a larger state (such as the
Uyghur people in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region within the People's
Republic of China). The Romani peopleÂ may be a special case, being distributed
among numerous countriesÂ with no clear homeland; as a traditionally "nomadic"
people, the Romani/Roma are a classical "stateless nation" without aspiration
to sovereign territory. As not all states are nation states, there are a number
of ethnic groups who live in a multinational state without necessarily being
considered as "stateless nations". As there are several thousand individual
languages and less than 200 independent states, it follows that the vast
majority of ethnic groups is "stateless" in the sense that they do not have
their own nation state.
