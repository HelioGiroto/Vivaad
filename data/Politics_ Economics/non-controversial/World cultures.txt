World Cultures World Cultures is an electronic and paper peer-reviewed academic
journal of cross-cultural studies. It was founded in 1985 by Douglas R. White,
who was the editor in chief until 1990, when Greg Truex took over, followed by
J. Patrick Gray and Peter N. Peregrine (1991-1995). Gray remains the current
editor. The current publisher is William Divale. The journal publishes cross-
cultural research articles and has published computerized codebooks and
datasets on the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, Western North American Indians,
an Atlas of Archaeology, and numerous other topics. Numerous software programs
for cross-cultural analysis have also been published. Part of the purpose of
the journal is to provide codebooks and data that are in the public domain for
scientific use, at minimal cost of distribution, both to support scientific
work and instructional use. New as well as legacy issues of the journal are at
the free on-line site of the California Digital Library. The largest of the
databases supported by the journal to date are the contributed multiauthored
coded data for the Standard Cross-Cultural Sample, now numbering 2,002 coded
variables on 186 societies by over 90 different contributing authors.
