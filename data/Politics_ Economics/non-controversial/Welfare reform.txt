Welfare reform Welfare reform refers to improving how a nation helps poor
people. In the United States, the term was used to get Congress to enact the
Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which further reduced aid to
the poor, to reduce government deficit spending without coining money. Regional
examples. United Kingdom. The recent actions taken towards reforming the
welfare system in Britain begin with 1997's New Deal Program. The Labour Party
focused on increasing employment through requiring that recipients of aid
actively consider seeking employment. This movement is similar in ideal to a
workfare system. The Labour Party also introduced a system of tax credits for
low-income workers. The most recent act on welfare reform in Great Britain is
the Welfare Act of 2007. The act provides for "an employment and support
allowance, a contributory allowance, an income-based allowance." France.
Beginning in the mid-1970s, a deficit in the program began to appear. The
deficit saw peaks at 27.75% of the social insurance budget in 1992. This led to
a major push by the government to cut back spending in the welfare program. By
the end of the 1990s the deficit had been almost completely eradicated. The
often large deficits that the program has endured has led to a tremendous
amount of opposition to the program as it stands.
