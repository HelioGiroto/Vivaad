Coordination failure (political science) Coordination failure is the electoral
problem resulting from competition between two or more candidates or political
parties from the same or approximate location in the political ideological
spectrum or space against an opposing candidate or political party from the
other side of the political ideological spectrum or space. The resulting
fragmentation of political support may result in electoral defeat. Coordination
failures, and thus political calculations attempting to avoid them, appear most
frequently in elections involving executives and representatives from single
member districts. "Coordination Failure" in a game-theoretic context is a state
of affairs in which agents' inability to coordinate their behavior (choices)
leads to an outcome (equilibrium) that leaves all agents worse off than in an
alternative situation that is also an equilibrium. This can occur due to lack
of information, inefficiencies, or differing expectations.
