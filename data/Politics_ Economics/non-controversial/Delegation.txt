Delegation Delegation (or deputation) is the assignment of authority and
responsibility to another person (normally from a manager to a subordinate) to
carry out specific activities. It is one of the core concepts of management and
leadership. However the person who delegated the work remains accountable for
the outcome of the delegated work. Delegation empowers a subordinate to make
decisions, i.e. it is a shift of decision-making authority from one
organizational level to a lower one. Delegation, if properly done, is not
abdication. The opposite of effective delegation is micromanagement, where a
manager provides too much input, direction, and review of delegated work. In
general, delegation is good and can save money and time, help in building
skills, and motivate people. Poor delegation, on the other hand, might cause
frustration, and confusion to all the involved parties. Delegation in IT
network is also an evolving field. Also see Context aware delegation.
