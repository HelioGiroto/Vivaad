Bureau-shaping model Bureau-shaping is a rational choice model of bureaucracy
and a response to budget-maximization model. It argues that rational officials
will not want to maximize their budgets, but instead to shape their agency so
as to maximize their personal utilities from their work. For instance,
bureaucrats would prefer to work in small, elite agencies close to political
power centres and doing interesting work, rather than to run large-budget
agencies with many staff but also many risks and problems. For the same
reasons, and to avoid risks, the bureau-shaping model also predicts that senior
government bureaucrats will often favour either 'agencification' to other
public sector bodies (as in the UK 'Next Steps' programme) or off-loading
functions to contractors and privatization. In the health and social work
fields officials will favour 'deinstitutionalization' and 'care in the
community'. (The model was developed by Patrick Dunleavy from the London School
of Economics in "Democracy, Bureaucracy and Public Choice" (London: Pearson
Education, 1991, reissued 2001).
