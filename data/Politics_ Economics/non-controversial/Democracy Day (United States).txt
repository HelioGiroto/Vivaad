Democracy Day (United States) Democracy Day is the tentative name of a possible
federal holiday in the United States, proposed by Democratic Representative
John Conyers of Michigan. Conyers' proposed the holiday in Resolution (H.R.) 63
- Democracy Day Act of 2005. The bill called for the Tuesday after the first
Monday in November of every even-numbered year, Election Day, to be a legal
public holiday. The purpose of the holiday was to increase voter turnout by
giving citizens more time to vote, as well as to allow for the opening of more
polling places with more workers while raising awareness of the importance of
voting and civic participation. The bill was referred to the House Committee on
Oversight and Government Reform in January 2005 and ultimately had 110 co-
sponsors. The bill has since lapsed and would need to be reintroduced before
the proposal could be reconsidered. A companion resolution was introduced in
the Senate on May 26, 2005 by Democratic Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan.
It was co-sponsored by Democratic Senators Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Carl
Levin of Michigan. The companion resolution did not leave the Senate Committee
on the Judiciary and has now also lapsed.
