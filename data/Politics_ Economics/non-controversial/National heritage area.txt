National heritage area National heritage area is a region defined by a
government as notable for cultural, historic, natural or recreation reasons.
Compared to a national park, a national heritage area is not subject to the
same level of zoning and regulations on land use. They are typically managed at
a local level. See also. In the Republic of Ireland the acronym NHA denotes
Natural Heritage Areas.
