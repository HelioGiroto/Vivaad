Voter fatigue In politics, voter fatigue is the apathy that the electorate can
experience under certain circumstances, one of which could be (in exceptional
circumstances) that they are required to vote too often. Voter fatigue and
voter apathy should be distinguished from what arises when voters are not
allowed or unable to vote, or when Disenfranchisement occurs. Voter fatigue can
be used as a criticism of the direct democracy system, in those specific
situations in which voters are constantly asked to decide on policy via
referenda (though it should be borne in mind that such situations may be
practically rare). However, proponents often counter that voter fatigue may be
lessened by direct democracy as voters will feel their vote has more effect.
