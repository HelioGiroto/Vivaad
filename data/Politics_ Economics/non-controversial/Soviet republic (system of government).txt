Soviet republic (system of government) A Soviet Republic is a system of
government in which the whole state power belongs to the Soviets (workers'
councils). Although the term is usually associated with communist states, it
was not initially intended to represent only one political force, but merely a
form of democracy and representation. In the classic Soviet Republic all power
belongs to the hierarchy of Councils ("Soviets"), with the Supreme Council on
the top. This means the Supreme Council has the authority to alter the
constitution, resolve trials, sentence people, change the government,
confiscate property, reform language and appoint any official by simple
majority. Decisions of the councils are not required to be ratified or
undersigned by any other body or person. In practice the councils do not
normally execute all these powers, but rather institute bodies to perform their
work. Each council is headed by a Presidium, which serves as a collective head
of the entity. The chairman of the Supreme Council performs the ceremonial
duties of the Head of State. State awards are usually awarded by a decree of
the Presidium of the Supreme Council or a lower level council. Each Council has
a number of committees, including the Executive Committee, which serves
executive functions of the Council and even as a local administration.
