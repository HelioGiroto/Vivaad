Ecotage Ecotage is a portmanteau of the "eco-" prefix and "sabotage". Ecotage
is often used as a descriptive term for the direct actions of environmental
groups such as Earth First! and similar groups throughout the Western world.
The term is only applied for actions of sabotage committed within the context
of the environmentalist movement. Often, because of a lack of clear definitions
between the three and because of the subjective nature of those ineffective
definitions, ecotage is often seen as indistinguishable from acts of civil
disobedience or even eco-terrorism. In fiction. Ecotage was popularized in 1975
by Edward Abbey's book "The Monkey Wrench Gang". It has also been treated in
novels by T. Coraghessan Boyle ("A Friend of the Earth"), Carl Hiaasen
("Tourist Season", "Sick Puppy", "Hoot"), Neal Stephenson ("Zodiac: The Eco-
Thriller"), and Richard Melo ("Jokerman 8"), and movies such as "Choke Canyon"
(1986) and "On Deadly Ground" (1994). "Ecotage!" is also the title of a 1972
humor book by Sam Love, which is the likely origin of the word. Ecotage is
mentioned in Mars trilogy of science fiction novels by Kim Stanley Robinson as
a means of protest shown by the Red political party. Typically the "Reds" would
destroy terraforming ventures in an effort to slow the terraforming of Mars.
The Concrete mini series "Think Like a Mountain" is centred about ecotage aimed
to protect first growth forests in the Pacific North-West.
