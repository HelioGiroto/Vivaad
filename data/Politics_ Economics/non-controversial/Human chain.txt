Human chain A human chain is a form of demonstration in which people link their
arms as a show of political solidarity. The number of demonstrators involved in
a human chain is often disputed; the organizers of the human chain often report
higher numbers than governmental authorities. A 'human chain' may also refer to
people holding on to each other in series to reach precarious spots. A young
girl was rescued from a cliff in California via this method. It may also refer
to people walking shoulder-to-shoulder in the event of searching for missing
persons in water or on land.
