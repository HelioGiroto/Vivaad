Red inverted triangle The Red inverted triangle was the badge that political
prisoners in Nazi concentration camps had to wear. The Nazis chose red because
the first people to have to wear it were Communists. Besides Communists,
liberals, anarchists, Social Democrats, Freemasons, and other opposition party
members also wore a red triangle. Many red triangle wearers were interned at
Dachau concentration camp.
