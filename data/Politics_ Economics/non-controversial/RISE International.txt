RISE International "This article is about the U.S. charity operating in Angola,
for the UK non-profit organization see RISE International C.I.C." RISE
International partners with local churches in Angola to build schools that
serve to educate the children of their communities. The buildings also provide
a setting for adult education and community meetings. RISE also sponsors
volunteer teams who travel to village school sites in Africa to conduct
workshops, training programs and classes. History. Rise was founded by Dr.
Andrew Cole (born in Angola 1953 - 2004) May 2000, Dr. Cole led a short-term
relief mission team to the Osire Refugee camp in Namibia. This inspired the
formation of a not-for-profit organization in May 2001, called the African
Refugee Committee (ARC). With the arrival of peace in Angola, ARC changed its
name to RISE International and has now begun to operate primarily within
Angola.
