Lake Ontario Waterkeeper Lake Ontario Waterkeeper is a Toronto-based
environmental justice advocacy group founded in 2001, with Lake Ontario, the
Great Lakes Basin, and allied waterways at heart. It is a licensed member of
the New York-based Waterkeeper Alliance, Actions and initiatives. In Summer of
2001 LOW triggered a $250 Million Federal Government remediation plan at Port
Granby near Port Hope, Ontario. The dump, was established by Eldorado Mining
and Refining Limited (and now managed by Cameco Corp.). In 2005 LOW campaigned
the City of Kingston, Ontario to disclose timely data about repeated sewage
discharges into Lake Ontario. In 2006 LOW produced "Heart of A Lake" concert
tour to several cities in Ontario, Canada "blending activism with art".
Starting in 2006 LOW started a campaign opposing the burning of tires by
Lafarge operations in Bath, Ontario. In 2007 LOW compelled the City of Toronto
to disclose specific reasons why beaches are closed, and used the legal system
to force the City to take responsibility. Citing a "little-known provincial
environmental guideline called F-5 that says municipalities must ensure that
beaches are clean enough for swimming 95 per cent of the time." This builds on
a 2006 LOW report "Investigating Municipal Beaches: Lessons from Bluffer's
Park" which cited some beaches beaches were closed to swimming 42 per cent of
the time. In 2009, the organization launched Swim Drink Fish Music, an online
music club which features rare and exclusive tracks by Canadian musicians.
