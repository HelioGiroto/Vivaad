Political dissent Political dissent refers to any expression designed to convey
dissatisfaction with or opposition to the policies of a governing body. Such
expression may take forms from vocal disagreement to civil disobedience to the
use of violence. Historically, repressive governments have sought to punish
political dissent. The protection of freedoms that facilitate peaceful dissent
has become a hallmark of free and open societies.
