Non-human electoral candidates Non-human electoral candidates have been found
in a number of countries. Often, the candidacies are a means of casting a
protest vote or satirizing the political system. Other times, it is simply done
for the entertainment value. Electoral regulations may explicitly require
candidates to be human (or equivalent wording), or may require candidates to do
things which animals cannot reasonably do (such as sign their name legibly on a
legal form). On some occasions, however, animals have been accepted as
candidates, and have even won office. Examples. Several animals in the US have
been elected mayors of small towns such as Rabbit Hash, Kentucky, whose mayor
is a black lab named Junior Cochran, and Lajitas, Texas, whose mayor is a beer-
drinking goat named Clay Henry III. Both Rabbit Hash and Lajitas are
unincorporated towns where the mayoralty is purely a ceremonial position, not
an actual leader of government. Folklore and pop culture. The notion of animals
being elected to office have often been the subject of parody and folklore. In
1972, American singer Tom T. Hall had a hit with a recording entitled "The
Monkey That Became President" which considered a scenario in which said animal
was elected to office. Thomas Love Peacock's 1817 novel "Melincourt" featured
an orangutan as a parliamentary candidate.
