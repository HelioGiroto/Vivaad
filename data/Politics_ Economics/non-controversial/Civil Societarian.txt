Civil societarianism Civil societarianism is the belief that intermediary
organizations and associations between the individual and the society have
greater moral importance than the state. This differs from communitarianism in
that it does not value such intermediary associations more than the individual.
The term was coined by Arnold Kling, a George Mason University economics
professor, to clear some ground between Randian libertarians and those
libertarians that do not base their philosophy on selfishness. In his article,
Kling writes: He also offers the concept as an alternative to ideas that
Liberals should withdraw, or try to escape, from state-dominated societies.
Jean-Jacques Rousseau's theory of the General Will serves as a good contrast to
the civil societarian view, one in which all social groups should be ended
apart from the state, so that they do not cause division and disunity. (See
Robert Nisbet and his "Quest For Community".)
