Power broker (term) A power broker is a person who can influence people to vote
towards a particular client (i.e. elected official or referendum) in exchange
for political or financial benefits. Power brokers can also negotiate deals
with other power brokers to meet their aims. Area of greatest influence. Power
brokers can demand more benefits in closely contested areas and policies. They
can play both sides and influence voters for the highest bidder. These brokers
wield great influence over voters who may be dedicated to one issue that draws
them into the electoral process but undecided on others. Hence, the brokers
maintain their influence by denying loyalty to a political party or other
political label.
