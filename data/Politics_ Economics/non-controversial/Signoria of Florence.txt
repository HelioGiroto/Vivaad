Signoria of Florence The Signoria was the government of medieval and
renaissance Florence. Its nine members, the "Priori", were chosen from the
ranks of the guilds of the city: six of them from the major guilds, and two
from the minor guilds. The ninth became the Gonfaloniere of Justice. Selection
of members. The names of all guild members over thirty years old were put in
eight leather bags called "borse". Every two months these bags were taken from
the church of Santa Croce, where they were ordinarily kept, and in a short
ceremony drawn out at random. Only men who were not in debt, had not served a
recent term, and had no relation to the names of men already drawn, would be
considered eligible for office. Service in the Signoria. Immediately after they
were elected, the nine were expected to move into the Palazzo della Signoria,
where they would remain for the two months of their office. There they were
paid a modest sum to cover their expenses and were provided with green-liveried
servants. The "Priori" had a uniform of crimson coats, lined with ermine and
with ermine collars and cuffs. In undertaking their governmental duties, the
Signoria was required to consult two other elected councils collectively known
as "Collegi". The first was the "Dodici Buonomini", with twelve members, while
the second, the "Sedici Gonfaloniere", consisted of sixteen people. Other
councils, such as the Ten of War, the Eight of Security and the Six of
Commerce, were elected as the need arose.
