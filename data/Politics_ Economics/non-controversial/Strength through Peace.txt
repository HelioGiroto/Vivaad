Strength Through Peace “Strength Through Peace” is a political theory
designed as the counter to the Cold War era doctrine of "Peace through
strength", which is the doctrine that military strength is a primary or
necessary component of peace. Strength through Peace advocates support
diplomacy and a return to statesmanship as the path to strong international
leadership.
