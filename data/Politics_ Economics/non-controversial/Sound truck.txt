Sound truck A sound truck is a vehicle equipped with loudspeakers, typically
used to play loud political or commercial messages, but are also used in
evacuations. The use of sound trucks for advertising is illegal in many
jurisdictions. It is legal in Portugal and usually used during election
campaigns by political parties. It is also legal in Japan. For the legal
situation in the United States see Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77 (1949). In
Bag√©, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, the level of the sound cannot exceed 65
decibels.
