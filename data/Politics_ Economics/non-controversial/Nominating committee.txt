Nominating committee A nominating committee (or nominations committee) is a
group formed usually from inside the membership of an organization for the
purpose of nominating candidates for office within the organization. It works
similarly to an electoral college, the main difference being that the available
candidates, either nominated or "written in" outside of the committee's
choices, are then voted into office by all of the members. The system is a part
of governance methods often employed by corporate bodies, business entities,
and social and sporting groups - especially clubs. The intention is that they
be made up of qualified and knowledgeable people representing the best
interests of the membership. In the case of business entities, their directors
will often be brought in from outside, and receive a benefit for their
expertise. Some observers believe that nominating committees are vulnerable to
manipulation by the controlling leaders of the group and that this is the main
reason for their formation. Candidates running for office outside of the
nominating committee's choices stand little chance of election. A nominating
committee can also be formed for the purpose of nominating persons or things
held up for judgment by others as to their comparative quality or value,
especially for the purpose of bestowing awards in the arts, or in application
to industry's products and services. The objective being to update, set, and
maintain high and possibly new standards.
