Divided regions Divided regions are transnational regions, islands, etc., (i.e.
areas that are known under a common name) that may have at one time been a
united sovereign state but are or have been subsequently politically divided by
national borders, into separate sovereign and/or administrative divisions. The
later qualification includes many reorganized regions within nation states
blurring the pure "transnational" distinction, but retaining the sense of a
historic region once governed together which is significant both historically
and culturally. Typically the divided parts still retain the common
geographical placename, or a variation thereof, and may or may not be subject
to irrendentist claims and territorial disputes. They are by their very nature
situated in border areas. Divided regions frequently have close cultural,
economic and transportation ties and not infrequently authorities or
commissions which smooth the process of co-operative efforts across their
common borders.
