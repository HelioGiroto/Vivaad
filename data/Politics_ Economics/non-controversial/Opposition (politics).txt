Opposition (politics) In politics, the opposition comprises one or more
political parties or other organized groups that are opposed to the government
(or, in American English, the administration), party or group in political
control of a city, region, state or country. The degree of opposition varies
according to political conditions - for example, across authoritarian and
liberal systems where opposition may be repressed or welcomed.
