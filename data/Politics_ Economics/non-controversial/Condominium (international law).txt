Condominium (international law) In international law, a condominium (plural
either "condominia", as in Latin, or condominiums) is a political territory
(state or border area) in or over which two or more sovereign powers formally
agree to share equally "dominium" (in the sense of sovereignty) and exercise
their rights jointly, without dividing it up into 'national' zones. Although a
condominium has always been recognized as a theoretical possibility,
condominiums have been rare in practice. A major problem, and the reason why so
few have existed in practice, is the difficulty of ensuring co-operation
between the sovereign powers; once the understanding fails, the status is
likely to become untenable. The word is recorded in English since c.1714, from
Modern Latin, apparently coined in Germany c.1700 from Latin "com-" "together"
+ "dominium" "right of ownership" (compare domain). Co-principality. Under
French law, Andorra was once considered to be a Frenchâ€“Spanish condominium,
although it is more commonly classed as a co-principality, since it is itself a
sovereign state, not a possession of one or more foreign powers, even though
the quality of Head of State is shared "ex officio" by two foreigners.
