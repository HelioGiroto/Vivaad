Malicious compliance Malicious compliance is the behavior of a person who
intentionally inflicts harm by strictly following the orders of management or
following legal compulsions, knowing that compliance with the orders will cause
a loss of some form resulting in damage to the manager's business or
reputation, or a loss to an employee or subordinate. In effect, it is a form of
sabotage used to harm leadership or used by leadership to harm subordinates. A
specific form of industrial action that utilizes this is work to rule.
