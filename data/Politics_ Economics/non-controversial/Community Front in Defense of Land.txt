Community Front in Defense of Land The Community Front in Defense of Land (in
Spanish: "Frente del Pueblo en Defensa de La Tierra", FPDT) was formed in 2002,
by residents of San Salvador Atenco, to resist their forced displacement by the
government of Mexico. The government planned to displace them to make way for a
new Mexico City Airport. The people of San Salvador Atenco have risen up
against the government from time to time for various reasons, the most common
being disputes for land.
