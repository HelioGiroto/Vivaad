Positive science In the humanities and social sciences, the term positive
(occasionally "positivist") is used in at least two ways. The most common usage
refers to analysis or theories which only attempt to describe how things 'are',
as opposed to how they 'should' be. Positive means also 'value free'. In this
sense, the opposite of positive is normative. An example would be positive, as
opposed to normative, economic analysis. Positive statements are also often
referred to as descriptive statements.
