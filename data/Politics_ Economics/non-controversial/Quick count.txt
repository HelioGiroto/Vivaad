Quick count Quick Count is a method for verification of election results by
projecting them from a sample of the polling stations. Different than the exit
poll, voters are not asked who they voted for, projection of results is based
on official results of the polling station. Parallel vote tabulation is similar
to quick count, but uses whole data instead of samples.
