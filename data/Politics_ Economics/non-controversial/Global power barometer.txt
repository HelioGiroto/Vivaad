Global power barometer The Global Power Barometer (GPB) is a tool that measures
which nations, ideologies or movements are most powerful based on how
successfully they influence global opinion and events. About. Located on
PostGlobal, washingtonpost.com and Newsweek.com’s panel blog on international
issues, the Global Power Barometer (GPB) is a visual monitor updated each
weekday by the research firm Denver Research Group, Inc. (DRGI) using a
weighted sample of sources from the media, academia, governments, and NGOs from
around the world. The GPB offers an indication of the most powerful nations and
ideologies on any given day. PostGlobal is hosted by journalists Fareed Zakaria
and David Ignatius. Transparency in Reporting. Clicking on “Decoding
Today’s Chart” takes you to a bulleted explanation of the observations and
drivers for the current chart, as well as archived paragraphs from earlier days
and weeks. Clicking on an individual country or group on the chart displays a
representative sample of sources used in determining the power shift for that
day. Looking at What’s Next. As it tracks and analyzes information from
across the world, the GPB often comes across issues that the PostGlobal branch
of DRGI thinks will impact global politics. These are the issues that likely
will move the icons in coming weeks. The “What’s Next” button lets a
reader access “Emerging Issues,” which is a listing of issues, players,
events, political intrigues or other items that the PostGlobal team believes
may become important in coming days or weeks. Tracking Movements. The reader
can click on the time bar at the top of the chart to watch movement of the
icons over the current week. Clicking on any of the dates stops the chart at
that specific date. The movement in previous weeks can also be viewed by
clicking “Other Weeks.”
