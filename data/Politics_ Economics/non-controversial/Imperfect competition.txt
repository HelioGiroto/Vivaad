Imperfect competition In economic theory, imperfect competition is the
competitive situation in any market where the conditions necessary for perfect
competition are not satisfied. It is a market structure that does not meet the
conditions of perfect competition. There may also be imperfect competition due
to a time lag in a market. An example is the “jobless recovery”. There are
many growth opportunities available after a recession, but it takes time for
employers to react, leading to high unemployment. High unemployment decreases
wages, which makes hiring more attractive, but it takes time for new jobs to be
created.
