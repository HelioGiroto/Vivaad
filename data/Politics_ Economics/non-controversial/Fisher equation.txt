Fisher equation The Fisher equation in financial mathematics and economics
estimates the relationship between nominal and real interest rates under
inflation. It is named after Irving Fisher, who was famous for his works on the
theory of interest. In finance, the Fisher equation is primarily used in YTM
calculations of bonds or IRR calculations of investments. In economics, this
equation is used to predict nominal and real interest rate behavior. Economists
generally use the Greek letter formula_1 as the inflation rate, not the
constant 3.14159... formula_5 formula_6 formula_7 formula_9 formula_10
Derivation. Although time subscripts are sometimes omitted, the intuition
behind the Fisher equation is the relationship between nominal and real
interest rates, through inflation, and the percentage change in the price level
between two time periods. So assume someone buys a $1 bond in period t while
the interest rate is formula_11. If redeemed in period, t+1, the buyer will
receive formula_12 dollars. But if the price level has changed between period t
and t+1, then the real value of the proceeds from the bond is therefore
formula_13 From here the nominal interest rate can be solved for. formula_14
(1) formula_15 formula_16 Assuming that both real interest rates and the
inflation rate are fairly small, formula_17 is much larger than formula_18 and
hence formula_23 Example. 1.02 × 1.01775 = (1 + 0.02) × (1 + 0.01775) =
1.0381 This article implies that you can ignore the least significant term in
the expansion (0.02 × 0.01775 = 0.00035 or 0.035%) and just call the nominal
rate of return 3.775%, on the grounds that that is almost the same as 3.81%. At
a nominal rate of return of 3.81% pa, the value of the bond is £107.84 per
£100 nominal. At a rate of return of 3.775% pa, the value is £108.50 per
£100 nominal, or 66p more. The average size of actual transactions in this
bond in the market in the final quarter of 2005 was £10 million. So a
difference in price of 66p per £100 translates into a difference of £66,000
per deal. Applications. The Fisher equation has important implications in the
trading of inflation-indexed bonds, where changes in coupon payments are a
result of changes in break-even inflation, real interest rates and nominal
interest rates.
