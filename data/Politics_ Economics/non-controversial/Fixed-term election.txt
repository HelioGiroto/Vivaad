Fixed-term election A fixed-term election is an election that occurs on a set
date, and cannot be changed by the incumbent politician. Fixed-term elections
are common for most mayors and for directly elected governors and presidents,
but less common for prime ministers and parliaments in a parliamentary system
of government.
