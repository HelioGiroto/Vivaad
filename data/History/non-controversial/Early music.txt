Early music Early music is generally understood as comprising all music from
the earliest times up to the Baroque. However, today this term has come to
include "any music for which a historically appropriate style of performance
must be reconstructed on the basis of surviving scores, treatises, instruments
and other contemporary evidence." Performance practice. According to Margaret
Bent, "Renaissance notation is under-prescriptive by our standards; when
translated into modern form it acquires a prescriptive weight that
overspecifies and distorts its original openness. Accidentals â€¦ may or may
not have been notated, but what modern notation requires would then have been
perfectly apparent without notation to a singer versed in counterpoint".
