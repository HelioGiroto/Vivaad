Timeline of United States diplomatic history The diplomatic history of the
United States oscillated among three positions: isolation from diplomatic
entanglements of other (typically European) nations (but with economic
connections to the world); alliances with European and other military partners;
and unilateralism, or operating on its own sovereign policy decisions. This is
in direct contrast to the European Union, whose member States have given up
their national sovereignty in exchange for cooperative mediation and group
policy-making, especially in the economic arena. Timeline of United States
