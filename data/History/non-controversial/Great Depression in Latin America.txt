Great Depression in Latin America The Great Depression which followed the US
stock market crash of 1929 badly affected the countries of Latin America.
Before the global Great Depression of the 1930s, links between the United
States economy and Latin American economies had been established through US
investment in Latin America and Latin American exports to the US. As a result,
Latin Americans felt heavy reverberations when the US market crashed in 1929.
Chile, Peru, and Bolivia were, according to a League of Nations report, the
countries worst-hit by the Great Depression. The rise of fascism also became
apparent in Latin American countries in the 1930s due to the Great Depression.
In particular, Get√∫lio Vargas of Brazil was a staunch supporter of the fascist
movement and imitated the Italian government. Fascist governments were the
result of a desire for nationalism, which rulers like Vargas played on through
propaganda. In Brazil and in other Latin American countries such as Mexico,
responses to the Great Depression also led to a strengthening of the
industrialization process (begun in the nineteenth century). Brazil needed an
economic alternative to the highly devalued coffee, its main commodity at the
time. The Vargas government started to purchase and burn coffee from the
farmers, in order to avoid their complete bankruptcy.
