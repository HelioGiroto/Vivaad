Cultural history of the United States The cultural history of the United States
covers the cultural history of the United States since its founding in the late
18th century. Various immigrant groups have been at play in the formation of
the nation's culture. While different ethnic groups may display their own
insular cultural aspects, throughout time a broad American culture has
developed that encompasses the entire country. Developments in the culture of
the United States in modern history have often been followed by similar changes
in the rest of the world (American cultural imperialism). This includes
knowledge, customs, and arts of Americans; and events in the social, cultural,
and political milieu. Justice system. Prior to the early 19th century, people
were infrequently jailed. Jails were considered too expensive and could not
competently secure a criminal for a lengthy period. Those convicted were either
flogged, placed in stocks for a time, or hung. In 1829, an attempt was made to
reform (induce repentance) convicts by incarcerating them in a penitentiary.
Strict silence was enforced. This model was widely copied and persisted for
nearly a century. Authorities conceded failure when those incarcerated often
went insane through lack of social contact.
