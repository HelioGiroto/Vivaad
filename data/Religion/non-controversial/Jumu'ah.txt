Jumu'ah The "jumuʿah" prayer is half the "ẓuhr" (dhuhr) prayer, for
convenience, preceded by a "khuṭbah" (a sermon as a technical replacement of
the two reduced "rakaʿāt" of the ordinary "ẓuhr" (dhuhr) prayer), and
followed by a congregational prayer, led by the imam. In most cases the
khaṭīb also serves as the imam. Attendance is strictly incumbent upon all
adult males who are legal residents of the locality. The muezzin "
(muʾadhdhin)" makes the call to prayer, called the adhan, usually 15-20
minutes prior to the start of Jum'ah. When the khaṭīb takes his place on the
minbar, a second adhan is made. The khaṭīb is supposed to deliver two
sermons, stopping and sitting briefly between them. In practice, the first
sermon is longer and contains most of the content. The second sermon is very
brief and concludes with a dua, after which the muezzin calls the iqama. This
signals the start of the main two rak'at prayer of Jumu'ah. The communal
prayers have higher compliance of worshippers, as compared to the non-communal
ritual prayers. In Turkey for example, the ritual prayers are performed
regularly by 44%, whereas Friday prayers were regularly attended by 56% (25%
responded that they sometimes attended and 19% that they never did). Muslim ibn
al-Hajjaj an-Naysaburi relates that the Islamic prophet Muhammad used to read
Surah 87 (Al-Ala) and Surah 88, (Al-Ghashiya), in Eid Prayers and also in
Friday prayers. If one of the festivals fell on a Friday, the Prophet would
have made sure to read these two Surahs in the prayers. A person who goes to
Friday prayer and remains quiet during the sermon is said to have his sins
between that Friday and last forgiven.
