Baal teshuva Baal teshuva or ba'al teshuvah (; for a woman, בעלת
תשובה, "baalat teshuva"; plural, בעלי תשובה, "baalei teshuva"),
sometimes abbreviated to BT, is a term that often refers to a Jew who turns to
embrace Orthodox Judaism. "Baal teshuvah" literally means, "master of
repentance" or "master of return" i.e., one who has repented or "returned" to
God. It is often contrasted with "FFB" (Frum from birth), which refers to Jews
who are born into families that are already religiously observant, and who have
been conceived, born, and raised Jewishly. Historically, the term referred to a
Jew who transgressed the halakhah (Jewish law) and completed a process of
introspection to "return" to the straight path. In contemporary times, the
phrase is primarily used to refer to a Jew from a secular background who
becomes religiously observant (normally in an Orthodox fashion) later in life.
(The alternative term, "chozer biteshuvah" (חוזר בתשובה) is more
commonly used in Israel). The Babylonian Talmud expresses high regard for
"baalei teshuva" with the statement, "In the place where "baalei teshuva"
stand, even the perfectly righteous cannot stand" (Berakhot 34b)." Baal teshuva
movement. There is an increasing large baal teshuva movement, and a number of
organizations seeking to aid the cause.
