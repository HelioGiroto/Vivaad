Sacramental character According to Roman Catholic Church teaching, a
sacramental character is an indelible spiritual "mark" (the meaning of the word
"character" in Latin) imprinted by three of the seven sacraments: Baptism,
Confirmation, and Holy Orders. The characters these three sacraments imprint
are held to differ from each other, with each character remaining indelible, so
that nobody can receive the sacrament in question more than once. The doctrine
of the sacramental character is thus a particular expression of the long-
established teaching that baptism, confirmation, and holy orders may not be
repeated, e.g. no one may be baptized more than once. One who receives a lower
grade of holy orders may receive a higher. Thus, though one who has been
ordained a deacon may not again be ordained a deacon, he may be ordained a
priest. Similarly, while a priest may not again be ordained a priest, he may be
ordained a bishop. There is no higher grade to which a bishop may be ordained.
Each higher grade is considered to confer a deepening or intensification of the
character of holy orders. If it is doubtful whether a person has received one
of the three sacraments in question, the sacrament may be administered
conditionally, but not, properly speaking, repeated. The doctrine of the
sacramental character was dogmatically defined at the 16th century Council of
Trent, but was held for more than 1000 years before, and was written about by
Augustine of Hippo.
