Oath Against Modernism The Oath against Modernism was issued by the Roman
Catholic Pope, Saint Pius X, on September 1, 1910, and mandated that "all
clergy, pastors, confessors, preachers, religious superiors, and professors in
philosophical-theological seminaries" should swear to it. The oath continued to
be taken until July 1967 when the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith
rescinded it. It is, however, still taken voluntarily before priestly
ordination by some clergy such as the Priestly Fraternity of St Peter and by
certain members of any confraternity: no one is prohibited from taking the
oath, nor is compelled to. Previously Pius X had defined Modernism as a heresy
in his encyclicals "Pascendi Dominici gregis" of 1907, and "Lamentabili Sane".
When John Paul II issued the apostolic letter Ad Tuendam Fidem on
ecclesiastical discipline, it provoked dissenters into claiming that the letter
was a "second oath" against modernist thought. The Oath Against Modernism was
promulgated by Pius X in the "Motu Proprio" "Sacrorum antistitum". The swearing
of the oath was compulsory for all Catholic bishops, priests and teachers,
until its abolition by Pope Paul VI in 1967. Excerpts from the text. To be
sworn to by all clergy, pastors, confessors, preachers, religious superiors,
and professors in philosophical-theological seminaries.
