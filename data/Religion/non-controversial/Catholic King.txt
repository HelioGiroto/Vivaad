Rex Catholicismus The Latin title Catholicissimus, rendered as Most Catholic
Monarch prior to Charles V and Most Catholic Majesty afterwards, is awarded by
the Pope as head of the Catholic Church to monarchs who in the eyes of the
papacy embody Catholic principles in their personal lives and state policies.
The title remains attached to monarchs descended from the original bearer in
perpetuity, unless withdrawn by a Pope. Bearers. Among the reigning monarchs of
Europe, the title is currently carried by the sovereigns of Belgium,
Luxembourg, and Spain. The present king chose not to relinquish the ancient
titles of the Spanish crown, but he does not use them. The current King of
Lesotho, the Prince of Monaco and the Prince of Liechtenstein have not been
awarded the title despite being Roman Catholics; the monarchs of Denmark, the
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Tonga, and the United Kingdom are Protestant; and
the remaining world monarchs are of other religions. One of the rights of a
"Most Catholic" queen either regnant or consort is the "privilège du blanc",
meaning that she may wear white when meeting the Pope rather than the normal
black used by other consorts and heads of state. The best-known example of this
title is the Catholic Monarchs ("Los Reyes Católicos"), used solely in
reference to Isabella I of Castile and Ferdinand II of Aragon.
