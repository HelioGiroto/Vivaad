Arathi The Arathi, a term meaning "prophets", are a Christian religious
movement founded in 1926 in Kenya. Along with the African Orthodox Church,
Arathi was founded by the Agikuyu in the wake of Kenya's civil unrest during
the 1920. Joseph Ng'ang'a and Musa Thuo are among the sect's most notable
prophets. Arathi was outlawed in 1934, when colonial officials prohibited
Arathi meetings. Baptism has remained a central part of the Arathi tradition
since its founding, and is still practiced today. It is viewed as a symbol of
the beginning of a new life, and followers receive a new name after their
baptism.
