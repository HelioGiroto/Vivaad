Irreligion Irreligion (adjective form: "nonreligious" or "irreligious") is the
absence of religion, an indifference towards religion, a rejection of religion,
or hostility towards religion. When characterized as the rejection of religious
belief, it includes atheism and secular humanism. When characterized as
hostility towards religion, it includes antitheism, anticlericalism and
antireligion. When characterized as indifference to religion, it includes
apatheism. When characterized as the absence of religious belief, it may also
include agnosticism, ignosticism, nontheism, religious skepticism, and
freethought. Irreligion may even include forms of theism depending on the
religious context it is defined against, as in 18th century Europe where the
epitome of irreligion was deism. It has been estimated that 16% of the world
population (1.1 billion people) are "non-religious" including agnostic,
atheist, secular humanist, and people who answer "none" or "no religious
preference" when asked an open-ended question about what is their religious
preference. According to one source, it has been estimated that 40â€“50% of
non-religious people hold belief in one or more deities, or in some higher
power. Some evidence suggests that the fastest-growing religious status in the
United States is "no religion", comprising nearly 20% of the adult public as of
2012. Those who lack a religious affiliation are sometimes referred to as
"nones".
