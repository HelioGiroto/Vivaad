Living creatures (Bible) The living creatures or living beings (Hebrew
חַיּוֹת "khayyot") are a class of heavenly being described in Ezekiel's
vision of the heavenly chariot in the first chapter of the Book of Ezekiel.
References to the creatures reoccur in texts of Second Temple Judaism, in
rabbinical "merkabah" ("chariot") literature, and in the Book of Revelation 4:
6. In later sources the creatures are equated as angels. In Christianity the
four creatures, sometimes combined into a tetramorph following Ezekiel, were
taken to represent the Four Evangelists. Ezekiel. Ezekiel describes the "living
beings" as having the shape of a man, with four faces (man, lion, bull and
eagle) and four wings; "They glowed like burning coals, had calf's feet that
sparkled like brass, and traveled like lightning." (Geneva Bible). The
"wheels", Hebrew ophanim, are also translated as angelic beings in later
literature. Revelation. Revelation 4:6 shows a vision of "four living beings"
(Greek τέσσαρα ζῷα) based on Ezekiel's vision. In Rabbinical
commentary. In Judaism, the living beings are considered angels of fire, who
hold up the throne of God and the earth itself. They are ranked first in
Maimonides' Jewish angelic hierarchy.
