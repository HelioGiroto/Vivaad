List of monasteries dissolved by Henry VIII of England These monasteries were
dissolved by King Henry VIII of England in the Dissolution of the Monasteries.
The list is by no means exhaustive, since over 800 religious houses existed
before the Reformation, and virtually every town, of any size, had at least one
abbey, priory, convent or friary in it. (Often many small houses of monks,
nuns, canons or friars.)
