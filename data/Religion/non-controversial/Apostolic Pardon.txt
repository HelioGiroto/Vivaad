Apostolic Pardon In the Catholic Church, the Apostolic Pardon is an indulgence
given for the remission of temporal punishment due to sin. The Apostolic Pardon
is given by a priest, usually along with Viaticum (i.e. reception of Communion
by a dying person, see Pastoral Care of the Sick, USA numbers 184, 187, 195,
201). It is not usually given as part of the sacrament of Anointing of the
Sick. However if the Anointing of the Sick is given with Viaticum, in
exceptional circumstances or an emergency, it may be given then. (See Pastoral
Care of the Sick, USA numbers 243, 265) Prior to the Second Vatican Council,
the Apostolic Pardon was called the Apostolic Blessing. According to the
church, a person who is properly disposed by being in the state of grace- i.e.,
the person has committed no known and unconfessed mortal sins- who receives the
Apostolic Pardon gains the complete pardon of all temporal punishment due to
sin that has already been forgiven by the reception of absolution and the doing
of penance, i.e., a plenary indulgence. The Apostolic Pardon does not forgive
sins by the act of absolution; it deals only with the punishment (purgation)
due for those sins that have already been sacramentally forgiven. However, the
Sacrament of Penance, or Reconciliation, which does forgive sins, is usually
administered along with the Apostolic Pardon as a part of the Last Rites. Form.
