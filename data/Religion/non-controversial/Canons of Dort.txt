Canons of Dort The Canons of Dort, or Canons of Dordrecht, formally titled "The
Decision of the Synod of Dort on the Five Main Points of Doctrine in Dispute in
the Netherlands", is the judgment of the National Synod held in the Dutch city
of Dordrecht in 1618–19. At the time, Dordrecht was often referred to in
English as "Dort". Today, the Canons of Dort form part of the Three Forms of
Unity, one of the confessional standards of many of the Reformed churches
around the world, including the Netherlands, South Africa, Australia, and North
America. Their continued use as a standard still forms an unbridgable problem
preventing close cooperation between the followers of Jacob Arminius, the
Remonstrants, and Dutch Reformed Churches. These canons are in actuality a
judicial decision on the doctrinal points in dispute from the Arminian
controversy of that day. Following the death of Arminius (1560–1609), his
followers set forth a Remonstrance (published in 1610) in five articles
formulating their points of departure from the stricter Calvinism of the Belgic
Confession. The Canons are the judgment of the Synod against this Remonstrance.
Regardless, Arminian theology later received official acceptance by the State
and has since continued in various forms within Protestantism. The Canons were
not intended to be a comprehensive explanation of Reformed doctrine, but only
an exposition on the five points of doctrine in dispute. These Canons set forth
what is often referred to as the Five Points of Calvinism.
