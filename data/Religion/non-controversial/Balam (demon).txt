Balam (demon) In demonology, Balam (also Balaam, Balan) is a great and powerful
king (to some authors a duke or a prince) of Hell who commands over forty
legions of demons. He gives perfect answers on things past, present, and to
come, and can also make men invisible and witty. Balam is depicted as being
three-headed. One head is the head of a bull, the second of a man, and the
third of a ram. He has flaming eyes and the tail of a serpent. He carries a
hawk on his fist and rides a strong bear. At other times he is represented as a
naked man riding a bear. His name seems to have been taken from Balaam, the
Biblical magician.
