Phronema Phronema is a transliteration of the Greek word φρόνημα, which
has the meanings of "mind", "spirit", "thought", "purpose", "will", and can
have either a positive meaning ("high spirit", "resolution", "pride") or a bad
sense ("presumption", "arrogance"). In the New Testament, the word is used four
times in the Saint Paul's Letter to the Romans: twice with "τῆς
σαρκός" (of the flesh) and twice with "τοῦ πνεύματος" (of
the spirit): "for the "mind" of the flesh death, and the "mind" of the Spirit
– life and peace; because the "mind" of the flesh [is enmity to God ...and He
who is searching the hearts hath known what the "mind" of the Spirit" (Romans
8:6-7,27). Eastern Orthodox theology. The term "phronema" is used in Eastern
Orthodox theology to one particular "mindset" or "outlook' – the "Orthodox
mind". Use by John Henry Newman. The term was used in by John Henry Newman in
an article published in 1859 under the title "On Consulting the Faithful in
Matters of Doctrine". He said that the "consensus" of the faithful is to be
regarded as "a sort of instinct, or "phronēma", deep in the bosom of the
mystical body of Christ".
