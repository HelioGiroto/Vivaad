Old English Bible translations A number of Old English Bible translations (pre-
1066) were prepared in medieval England, rendering parts of the Bible into the
Old English language. Many of these translations were in fact glosses, prepared
and circulated in connection with the Latin Bible — the Vulgate — that was
standard in Western Christianity at the time, for the purpose of assisting
clerics whose grasp of Latin was imperfect. Old English literature is
remarkable for containing a number of incomplete Bible translations that were
"not" glosses and that were meant to be circulated independently. Known
translations. In 1066, the Norman Conquest of England marked the beginning of
the end of the Old English language and initiated profound changes in its
vocabulary. The project of translating the Bible into Old English gradually
ended after that process began. A period of change from Old English to Middle
English began (though evidence is very scanty), and eventually there were
attempts to provide Bible translations in that language.
