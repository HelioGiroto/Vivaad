Tract (liturgy) The tract (Latin: tractus) is part of the proper of the
liturgical celebration of the Eucharist for many Christian denominations, which
is used instead of the Alleluia during Lenten or pre-Lenten seasons, in a
Requiem Mass, and on a few other penitential occasions, when the joyousness of
an Alleluia is deemed inappropriate. Tracts are not, however, necessarily
sorrowful. The name apparently derives from either the drawn-out style of
singing or the continuous structure without a refrain. There is evidence,
however, that the earliest performances were sung responsorially, and it is
probable that these were dropped at an early age. In their final form, tracts
are a series of psalm verses; rarely a complete psalm, but all of the verses
from the same psalm. They are restricted to only two modes, the second and the
eighth. The melodies follow centonization patterns more strongly than anywhere
else in the repertoire; a typical tract is almost exclusively a succession of
such formulas. The cadences are nearly always elaborate melismas. Tracts with
multiple verses are some of the longest chants in the Liber Usualis.
