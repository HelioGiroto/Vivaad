Ambarvalia Ambarvalia was a Roman agricultural fertility rite held at the end
of May in honor of Ceres. At these festivals they sacrificed a bull, a sow, and
a sheep, which, before the sacrifice, were led in procession thrice around the
fields; whence the feast is supposed to have taken its name, "ambio", I go
round, and "arvum", field. This sacrifice was called a "suovetaurilia" in
Latin. These feasts were of two kinds, "public" and "private". The "private"
were solemnized by the masters of families, accompanied by their children and
servants, in the villages and farms out of Rome. The "public" were celebrated
in the boundaries of the city, and in which twelve "fratres arvales" walked at
the head of a procession of the citizens, who had lands and vineyards at Rome.
During the procession, prayers would be made to the goddess. The "ambervale
carmen" was a prayer preferred on this occasion. The name "Ambarvalia" appears
to be predominantly an urban designation. More rustic calendars describe this
only as "segetes lustrantur" ("crops are purified"). Scaliger, in his notes on
Festus, maintains the ambarvalia to be the same as amburbia. Numerous other
communities of the Italian peninsula enacted similar rites with different
names.
