Eucharistic theologies summarised Moravian Church. Most Moravians hold an
understanding of Holy Communion that is similar to Lutherans; however, because
the exact meaning of the Eucharist is not defined in Scripture, all
understandings of the ceremony are accepted. Each individual believer must
arrive at their own understanding of the Eucharistic experience. As a result,
during the Moravian service of Holy Communion, only the scriptural words of
institution are used, and thematic hymns are sung during the serving of the
sacrament. Believers may understand the ceremony to be Transubstantiation,
Consubstantiation, or that Christ is spiritually present. The Moravian Church
practices open communion. All baptized Christians who have confirmed their
faith may join in Holy Communion.
