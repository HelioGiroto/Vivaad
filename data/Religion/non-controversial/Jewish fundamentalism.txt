Jewish fundamentalism The term Jewish fundamentalism may refer to militant
religious Zionism or Ashkenazi or Sephardi Haredi Judaism. The term
"fundamentalism" was originally used in reference to certain Christian groups
but today commonly refers to the anti-modernist movements of any religion based
on literal interpretation of religious scriptures.
