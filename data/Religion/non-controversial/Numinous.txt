Numinous Numinous () is an English adjective, taken from the Latin Numen, and
used to describe the power or presence of a divinity. The word was popularised
in the early twentieth century by the German theologian Rudolf Otto in his
influential book "Das Heilige" (1917; translated into English as "The Idea of
the Holy", 1923). According to Otto, the numinous experience has in addition to
the "tremendum", which is the tendency to invoke fear and trembling, a quality
of "fascinans", the tendency to attract, fascinate and compel. The numinous
experience also has a personal quality, in that the person feels to be in
communion with a "wholly other". The numinous experience can lead in different
cases to belief in deities, the supernatural, the sacred, the holy and/or the
transcendent. Etymology. The word "numinous" is derivative from the Classical
Latin word "numen". Rudolf Otto. Otto's use of the term as referring to a
characteristic of religious experience was influential among intellectuals of
the subsequent generation. For example, numinous as understood by Otto was a
frequently quoted concept in the writings of Carl Jung and C. S. Lewis. The
notion of the numinous and the "wholly other" were also central to the
religious studies of Mircea Eliade.  Non-religious usage. The idea is not
necessarily a religious one: noted atheists Carl Sagan, Christopher Hitchens,
Daniel Dennett, Richard Dawkins and Sam Harris have discussed the importance of
separating the numinous from the religious.
