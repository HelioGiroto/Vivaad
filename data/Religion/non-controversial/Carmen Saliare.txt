Carmen Saliare The Carmen Saliare is a fragment of archaic Latin, which played
a part in the rituals performed by the Salii (Salian priests, aka "leaping
priests") of Ancient Rome. The rituals revolved around Mars and Quirinus, and
were performed in March and October. These involved processions in which they
donned archaic armour and weapons, performed their sacred dance, and sang the
"Carmen Saliare". As a body they existed before the founding of the Roman
republic, tracing their origin back to the reign of King Numa Pompilius. The
Salian priests were chosen from the sons of patrician families whose parents
were still living. They were appointed for life, though they were allowed to
resign from the Salian priesthood if they achieved a more prestigious
priesthood or a major magistracy. or Linguists have been unable to translate
most of the text; the Latin words that are recognizable in it appear to mention
thunder, Janus, and Ceres. Even in the 1st century BC, Cicero was unable to
interpret much of the chant. However, Julius Pomponius Laetus proposed "osculo
dolori ero" ("I shall be as a kiss to grief") as a possible conversion of the
mysterious "cozeulodorieso" into Classical Latin.
