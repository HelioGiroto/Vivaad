Minority religion A minority religion is a religion held by a minority of the
population of a country, state, or region. Minority religions may be subject to
stigma or discrimination. An example of a stigma is using the term cult with
its extremely negative connotations for certain new religious movements. People
who belong to a minority religion may be subject to discrimination and
prejudice, especially when the religious differences correlate with ethnic
differences.. Laws are made in some countries to protect the rights of
religious minorities, such as protecting the minorities' culture and to promote
harmony with the majority.
