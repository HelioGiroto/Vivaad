Earth religion Earth religion is a New Age term used mostly in the context of
Neopaganism. It is an umbrella phrase that is used to cover any religion that
worships the Earth, Nature, or fertility gods and goddesses, such as the
various forms of goddess worship or matriarchal religion. Also most Indian
religions can be included in Earth religion. Some find a connection between
Earth-worship and the Gaia hypothesis. Earth religions are also formulated to
allow one to utilize the knowledge of preserving the Earth.
