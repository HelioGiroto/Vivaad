List of founders of religious traditions This article lists historical figures
credited with founding religions or religious philosophies or people who first
codified older known religious traditions. It also lists those who have founded
a specific major denomination within a larger religion. In many cases, one can
regard a religion as a continuous tradition extending to prehistoric times
without a specific founder (Vedic Religion precursor of Hinduism, folk
religion, animism), or with legendary founding-figures whose historicity cannot
be established (such as Abraham, Lord Rishabha). This notwithstanding, the
various historical denominations of such religions will still have founders,
such as St. Peter and St. Paul (who formed what is now known as Pauline
Christianity), Nestorius (who codified Nestorianism), or Martin Luther (who
taught Lutheranism) â€“ all exemplifying denominations of Christianity.
Religion often develops by means of schism and reform (motivated by theological
speculation), and it becomes a matter of subjective judgement at what point
such a schism or reform assumes the quality of a "foundation" of a new
religion.
