Lists of cathedrals This is a list of cathedrals by country, including both
actual cathedrals (seats of bishops in episcopal denominations, such as
Catholicism, Anglicanism, and Orthodoxy) and a few prominent churches from non-
episcopal denominations commonly referred to as "cathedral", usually having
formerly acquired that status. As of 2011, the Catholic Church had 3,068
churches of cathedral and co-cathedral status around the world, predominantly
in countries with a significant Roman Catholic population: Italy (357), Brazil
(280), United States (207), India (156), France (103), Mexico (98), Spain (87),
Philippines (87), Colombia (83), Canada (74) and Argentina (72).
