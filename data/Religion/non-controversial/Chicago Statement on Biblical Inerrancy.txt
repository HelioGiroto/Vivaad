Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy The Chicago Statement on Biblical
Inerrancy was formulated in October 1978 by more than 200 evangelical leaders
at a conference sponsored by the International Council on Biblical Inerrancy
(ICBI), held in Chicago. The statement was designed to defend the position of
Biblical inerrancy against a perceived trend toward liberal conceptions of
Scripture. The undersigners came from a variety of evangelical Christian
denominations, and include James Montgomery Boice, Carl F. H. Henry, Kenneth
Kantzer, J. I. Packer, Francis Schaeffer, and R. C. Sproul. Leading
inerrantists regard the Chicago Statement as a very thorough statement of what
they mean by "inerrancy". The statement elaborates on various details in
Articles formed as couplets of "WE AFFIRM ..." and "WE DENY ...". Under the
statement inerrancy applies only to the "original manuscripts" (which no longer
exist, but can be inferred on the basis of extant copies), not to the copies or
translations themselves. In the statement, inerrancy does "not" refer to a
blind literal interpretation, but allows for figurative, poetic and
phenomenological language, so long as it was the "author's intent" to present a
passage as literal or symbolic. The Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy has
been compared to the Vatican Council Decree "Dei Verbum", which expounds
similar teachings for Roman Catholics.
