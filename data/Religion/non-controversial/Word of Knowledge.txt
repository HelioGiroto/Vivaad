Word of Knowledge In Christianity, the word of knowledge is a spiritual gift
listed in 1 Corinthians 12:8. It is closely related to the word of wisdom.
Description. Throughout church history, this gift has often been viewed as a
teaching gift and connected with being able to understand scriptural truth.
"The Catholic Encyclopedia" defines it as "the grace of propounding the Faith
effectively, of bringing home to the minds and hearts of the listener with
Divine persuasiveness, the hidden mysteries and the moral precepts of
Christianity". Among Pentecostal and charismatic Christians, the word of
knowledge is often defined as the ability of one person to know what God is
currently doing or intends to do in the life of another person. It can also be
defined as knowing the secrets of another person's heart. Through this
revelation, it is believed that God encourages the faith of the believer to
receive the healing or comfort that God offers. For example, in a public
gathering a person may describe a medical problem and ask anyone suffering from
the described problem to identify themselves and receive prayer for healing.
According to this definition, the word of knowledge is a form of revelation
similar to prophecy or a type of discernment.
