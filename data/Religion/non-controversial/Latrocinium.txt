Latrocinium Latrocinium (from Latin "latro", ultimately from Greek "latron",
"pay" hire) which meant primarily a mercenary, or hired soldier, had the same
meaning as "miles". "Latrocinium" applied to a war that was not preceded by a
declaration of war under the Roman laws; it was also applied to the guerrilla
warfare used by the enemies of Rome. In the Middle Ages, "latrocinium" was a
war without just cause, or piracy. Plato and Aristotle considered that
latrocinium was a way of life like fishing or hunting. Latrocinium in
ecclesiastical Latin means 'rebel or hostile council'. It literally means
'robber council' and was used as a term of abuse to suggest such a council was
not canonical. The third Council of Sirmium in 357, second Council of Ephesus
in 449, Council of Hieria in 754 and Synod of Pistoia in 1786 were each
described by their opponents as a "latrocinium". Some also regarded the fourth
Council of Constantinople, meeting in 879-880, in the same way. Richard I of
England exempted the Knights Templar from being charged with "latrocinium" and
the secret killing known as murdrum, amongst other privileges. Certain
Catholics regard the Vatican II as a "Latrocinium", given its role in a
fundamental revision of Roman Catholic rituals and belief.
