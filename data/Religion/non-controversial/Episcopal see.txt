Episcopal see An episcopal see (Latin: "episcopalis sedes") is, in the original
sense, the official "seat" of a bishop. This seat, which is also referred to as
the bishop's cathedra, is placed in the bishop's principal church, which is
therefore called the bishop's cathedral. The seat is also called the bishop's
"throne", especially in the Eastern Orthodox Church. The term is also used of
the town or place where the cathedral is located, giving rise to expressions
such as "the Episcopal See of Gibraltar". The bishop's seat is the earliest
symbol of bishop's authority, and the word "see" is thus often applied to the
area over which the bishop exercises authority. This usually corresponds to a
diocese, as in the expression "within the see of Ebbsfleet" and "built within
the see of the bishop of Worcester". But it is sometimes given a wider
significance, referring for instance to an area under patriarchal authority. In
common English usage, the term "Holy See" most often refers to the episcopal
see of the Bishop of Rome.
