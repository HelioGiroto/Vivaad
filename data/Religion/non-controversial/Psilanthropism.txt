Psilanthropism Psilanthropism is an approach to Christology which understands
Jesus to be a "mere human", and the literal son of human parents. The term
derives from the combination of the Greek ψιλός (psilós), "plain," "mere"
or "bare," and ἄνθρωπος (ánthrōpos) "human." Psilanthropists
generally deny both the virgin birth of Jesus, and his divinity. Historical
figures such as Nestorius were technically not psilanthropists because they
still maintained a divine component in their Christology. Samuel Taylor
Coleridge was, however, an example of a psilanthropist. Early psilanthropism.
The term is sometimes used to describe Ebionitism, which was rejected by the
ecumenical councils, especially in the First Council of Nicaea, which was
convened to deal directly with the nature of Christ's divinity. Modern
psilanthropism. An example of a modern psilanthropist is Uta Ranke-Heinemann
who contends that the virgin birth of Jesus was meant—and should be
understood—as an allegory of a special initiative of God, comparable to God's
creation of Adam, and in line with legends and allegories of antiquity. Modern
psilanthropists also include some members of the Unification Church. The
church's textbook, the "Divine Principle" does not include the teaching that
Zacharias was the father of Jesus, however according to Ruth Tucker some
members of the church hold that belief based on the work of Leslie Weatherhead.
