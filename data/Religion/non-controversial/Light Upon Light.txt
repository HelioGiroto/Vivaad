Ayat an-Nur The Ayat an-Nur (Arabic: "the Sign of Light" or the Verse of Light)
is the 35th line of the 24th sura of the Qur'an, Sura an-Nur. The verse is
renowned for its remarkable beauty and imagery, and perhaps more than any other
verse lends itself to mystical or esoteric readings of the Qur'an. The verse
was very commonly used in the decoration of mosque lamps. Verse. by Ali Quli
Qara'i Comments. Perhaps more than any other, this single ayat suggests only
mystical interpretations, as the metaphor is completely coherent, but it does
not surrender an obvious meaning. Hence it was and remains a key Qur'anic
passage to many Sufis and Muslim Philosophers into the present day, who argue
for esoteric readings of the Qur'an. Most noteworthy amongst the intellectual
and spiritual genius who have puzzled over Ayat an-Nur is al-Ghazali (d. 1111),
whose reflections on this verse, as well as the nature of divine Light is
collected in his masterpiece Mishkat al-Anwar (the "Niche of Lights"). Often
employed by Sufis and Muslim Philosophers, the Light Verse testifies of God as
the "Light of the heavens and the earth". The short metaphor which follows, is
both visual enough to be grasped by anyone, and yet suggests realms of meaning
beyond any literal reading of the Book. This verse is also the primary source
of one of the 99 Names of God: an-Nur,(النور) "The Light".
