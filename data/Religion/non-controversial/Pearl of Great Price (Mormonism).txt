Pearl of Great Price (Mormonism) The Pearl of Great Price is part of the
standard works of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church;
see also Mormonism) and some other Latter Day Saint denominations. Contents.
The original contents of the book were slightly different, reproducing material
found in the Doctrine and Covenants and a poem entitled "Oh Say What is Truth?"
(which is now found in the LDS Church hymnal). In 1878 some material from the
Book of Moses was added. The Pearl of Great Price was canonized in 1880. In
1902 the material reproduced in the Doctrine and Covenants was removed. Two
other documents, now found as Doctrine and Covenants 137 and 138, were added to
the Pearl of Great Price in 1976 and moved to their current location in 1979.
