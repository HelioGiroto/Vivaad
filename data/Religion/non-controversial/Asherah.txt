Asherah Asherah (; Ugaritic: 𐎀𐎘𐎗𐎚 : 'ṯrt; ), in Semitic
mythology, is a Semitic mother goddess, who appears in a number of ancient
sources including Akkadian writings by the name of Ashratum/Ashratu and in
Hittite as Asherdu(s) or Ashertu(s) or Aserdu(s) or Asertu(s). Asherah is
generally considered identical with the Ugaritic goddess Athirat (more
accurately transcribed as ). She is identified as the wife or consort of the
Sumerian Anu or Ugaritic El, the oldest deities of their pantheons. This role
gave her a similarly high rank in the Ugaritic pantheon. The name Allat (Elat,
Ilat) in the Sanchuniathon is clearly associated with Asherah, because the same
common epithet of "the goddess par excellence," is used to describe her. The
Book of Jeremiah written circa 628 BC possibly refers to Asherah when it uses
the title "Queen of Heaven" () in Jer 7:18 and Jer 44:17–19, 25. (For a
discussion of "queen of heaven" in the Hebrew Bible, see Queen of heaven.) In
Ugarit. In the Ugaritic texts (before 1200 BCE) Athirat is almost always given
her full title "rbt ym", "rabat yammi", 'Lady Athirat of the Sea' or as more
fully translated 'She who treads on the sea', (Ugaritic : 𐎗𐎁𐎚
𐎀𐎘𐎗𐎚 𐎊𐎎 ) This occurs 12 times in the Ba'al Epic alone. The
name understood by various translators and commentators to be from the Ugaritic
root ' 'stride' cognate with the Hebrew root ' of the same meaning. Her other
main divine epithet was "qaniyatu ʾilhm" (Ugaritic : 𐎖𐎐𐎊𐎚
𐎛𐎍𐎎 : qnyt ʾlm) which may be translated as "the creatrix of the gods
(Elohim)". In those texts, Athirat is the consort of the god El; there is one
reference to the 70 sons of Athirat, presumably the same as the 70 sons of El.
She is clearly distinguished from Ashtart (better known in English as Astarte
or Ashtoreth in the Bible) in the Ugaritic documents although in non-Ugaritic
sources from later periods the distinction between the two goddesses can be
blurred; either as a result of scribal error or through possible syncretism. In
any case, the two names begin with different consonants in the Semitic
languages; Athirat/Asherah (Ugaritic : 𐎀𐎘𐎗𐎚 : aṯrt) with an
"aleph" or glottal stop consonant א and `Ashtart/`Ashtoreth (Ugaritic :
𐎓𐎘𐎚𐎗𐎚 : ʿṯtrt) with an "`ayin" or voiced pharyngeal consonant
ע), indicating the lack of any plausible etymological connection between the
names. She is also called Elat (Ugaritic : 𐎛𐎍𐎚 : ilt) ("Goddess", the
feminine form of El; compare Allat) and Qodesh 'Holiness' (Ugaritic :
𐎖𐎄𐎌 : qdš). Athirat in Akkadian texts appears as Ashratum (Antu), the
wife of Anu, the god of heaven. In contrast, Ashtart is believed to be linked
to the Mesopotamian Goddess Ishtar who is sometimes portrayed as the daughter
of Anu while in Ugaritic myth, Ashtart is one of the daughters of El, the West
Semitic counterpart of Anu. Among the Hittites this goddess appears as Asherdu
(s) or Asertu(s), the consort of Elkunirsa (from the Ugaritic title, El-qan-
arsha : "El the Creator of Earth") and mother of either 77 or 88 sons. Among
the Amarna letters a king of the Amorites is named Abdi-Ashirta, "Servant of
Asherah". In Egypt. In Egypt, beginning in the 18th dynasty, a Semitic goddess
named Qudshu ('Holiness') begins to appear prominently, equated with the native
Egyptian goddess Hathor. Some think this is Athirat/Ashratu under her Ugaritic
name Qodesh. This Qudshu seems not to be either or as both those goddesses
appear under their own names and with quite different iconography and appear in
at least one pictorial representation along with Qudshu. But in the Persian,
Hellenistic, and Roman periods in Egypt there was a strong tendency towards
syncretism of goddesses and Athirat/Ashrtum then seems to have disappeared, at
least as a prominent goddess under a recognizable name. In Israel and Judah.
Some speculate that between the 10th century BC and the beginning of their
exile in 586 polytheism was normal throughout Israel; it was only after the
exile that worship of Yahweh alone became established, and possibly only as
late as the time of the Maccabees (2nd century BC) that monotheism became
universal among Jews. The majority of biblical scholars accept that Asherah at
one time was worshiped as the consort of Yahweh, the national god of Israel.
The evidence includes, for example, an 8th century combination of iconography
and inscriptions discovered at Kuntillet Ajrud in the northern Sinai desert
where a storage jar shows three anthropomorphic figures and an inscription that
refers to "Yahweh … and his Asherah". Further evidence includes the many
female figurines unearthed in ancient Israel, supporting the view that Asherah
functioned as a goddess and consort of Yahweh and was worshiped as the Queen of
Heaven. Ashira in Arabia. A stele, now at the Louvre, discovered by Charles
Huber in 1883 in the ancient oasis of Tema (modern Tayma – ), northwestern
Arabia, and believed to date to the time of Nabonidus's retirement there in 549
BC, bears an inscription in Aramaic which mentions of and Shingala and Ashira
as the gods of Tema. This Ashira might be Athirat/Asherah. Since Aramaic has no
way to indicate Arabic "th", corresponding to the Ugaritic "th" (phonetically
written as ""), if this is the same deity, it is not clear whether the name
would be an Arabian reflex of the Ugaritic "Athirat" or a later borrowing of
the Hebrew/Canaanite "Asherah". The Arabic root "" is similar in meaning to the
Hebrew indicating "to tread" used as a basis to explain the name of Ashira as
"Lady of the sea", specially that the Arabic root "ymm" also means "sea".
