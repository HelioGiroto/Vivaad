Black Madonna A Black Madonna or Black Virgin is a statue or painting of Mary
in which she is depicted with dark skin, especially those created in Europe in
the medieval period or earlier. In this specialized sense "Black Madonna" does
not refer to images of the Virgin Mary portrayed as specifically ethnically
black, which are popular in Africa and areas with large black populations, such
as Brazil and the United States, but rather refers to all portrayals of the
Virgin Mary with dark skin that were created during this time period. The Black
Madonnas are generally found in Catholic areas. The statues are mostly wooden
but occasionally stone, often painted and up to 75Â cm tall, generally dating
from between the 11th and 15th centuries. They fall into two main groups: free-
standing upright figures and seated figures on a throne. The pictures are
usually icons which are Byzantine in style, often made in 13th or 14th century
Italy. There are about 450â€“500 Black Madonnas in Europe, depending on how
they are classified. There are at least 180 "Vierges Noires" in France, and
there are hundreds of non-medieval copies as well. Some are in museums, but
most are in churches or shrines and are venerated by devotees. A few are
associated with miracles and attract substantial numbers of pilgrims.
