{{shortcut|WP:LCI|WP:CONT}}

This is a list of previously '''controversial issues among Wikipedia editors'''. 
A [[controversy|controversial]] issue is one where its related articles are constantly being re-edited in a circular manner, or is otherwise the focus of [[Wikipedia:Edit war|edit war]]ring. 
This page is conceived as a location for articles that regularly become biased and need to be fixed, or articles that were once the subject of an NPOV dispute and are likely to suffer future disputes. Other articles not yet classified as &quot;controversial&quot; have some [[edit conflict]] issues. The divisive nature of disputed subjects have triggered arguments, since opinions on a given issue differ as they are debated. 
These subjects are responsible for a great deal of tension among Wikipedia editors, reflecting the debates of society as a whole.  Perspectives on these subjects are particularly subject to time, place, and culture of the editor. 
* Articles listed here may need more work to approach a [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|neutral point of view]] than is usual. For articles that are ''currently'' unbalanced, see [[wikipedia:NPOV dispute|NPOV dispute]] instead.
* Articles on this list should be checked from time to time to monitor developments in the presentation of the issues. Use the &quot;related changes&quot; link to quickly review changes to these articles. 
* Discussions about those controversies should be limited to the relevant Talk pages. For more information, see [[Wikipedia:Controversial articles]].

==Major themes==
Some of the biggest editing disputes at Wikipedia naturally mirror the intensity of the controversy in the outside world. The clash between what people in the U.S. call a &quot;[[culture war]]&quot; of sociopolitical mores characterized as either &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;conservative&quot;, and globally on the moralistic nature of &quot;right&quot; and &quot;wrong&quot; or even [[sin]] or [[taboo]] for civil discussion and comedy, affects many of these disputes.

== Categories of past controversial issues ==
Many of these articles could be classified into multiple categories.
