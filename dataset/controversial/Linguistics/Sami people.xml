The '''Sami people''', also spelled '''Sámi''' or '''Saami''', are the [[indigenous people]] inhabiting the [[Arctic]] area of  [[Sápmi (area)|Sápmi]], which today encompasses parts of far northern [[Sweden]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], the [[Kola Peninsula]] of [[Russia]], and the border area between south and middle Sweden and Norway.  The Sámi are the only indigenous people of  [[Scandinavia]] recognized under the international conventions of Indigenous peoples, and hence the northernmost indigenous people of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Heritage and the Arctic |last=F. Norokorpi |first=Yrjö |authorlink= |coauthors= Case study: Struve Geodetic Arc |year=2007 |publisher=UNESCO |url=http://whc.unesco.org/archive/websites/arctic2008/finland.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sami ancestral lands span an area of approximately 388,350&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (150,000 sq. mi.), which is approximately the size of Sweden, in the [[Nordic countries]]. Their traditional languages are the [[Sami languages]] and are classified as a branch of the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language family.

Traditionally, the Sami have pursued a variety of livelihoods, including coastal fishing, [[fur trapping]] and [[Shepherd|sheep herding]]. Their best-known means of livelihood is semi-nomadic [[reindeer]] herding, with which about 10% of the Sami are connected and 2,800 actively involved on a full-time basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;galdu.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.galdu.org/govat/doc/eng_reindeer.pdf Galdu.org]&lt;/ref&gt; For traditional, environmental, cultural and political reasons, reindeer herding is legally reserved only for Sami people in certain regions of the Nordic countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3760/is_200001/ai_n8885279 Findarticles.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sámi are often known in other languages by the [[exonym]]s ''Lap'', ''Lapp'', or ''Laplanders'', but many Sami regard these as pejorative terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethnologue |last=F.

The word ''Lapp'' is defined in the ''[[Lexicon Lapponicum]]'' as &quot;Fenn&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Lexicon Lapponicum|last= Lindahl |first= Erik |year=1780 |publisher=Typis Joh. Georg. Lane|page=201 | url=http://www.archive.org/details/lexiconlapponic00ihregoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first known historical mention of ''Fenni'' was by [[Tacitus]], about 98&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= Tacitus. Germania. Translated with introduction and commentary by J.B. Rives |last= Rives |first= Archibald Black |year=1999 |publisher=Oxford University Press|location= Oxford |page=96 |pages=322, 326, 327| url=http://books.google.com/?id=9xLVEPR-ax8C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Germania:+by+Cornelius+Tacitus+rives#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn= 978-0-19-815050-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact meaning of this old term, and the reasons it came into common usage, are unknown; in [[North Germanic languages|Scandinavian languages]], ''lapp'' means &quot;a patch of cloth for mending&quot;, which may be a description{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} of the clothing, called a [[gakti]], that the Sámi wear. Another possible source is the Finnish word ''lape'', which in this case means &quot;periphery&quot;. Originally, it meant any person living in the wilderness, not only the Sámi people. It is unknown how the word ''Lapp'' came into the [[Old Norse|Norse language]], but it may have been introduced by the Danish historian [[Saxo Grammaticus]] to distinguish between Fish-Fennians (coastal tribes) and Lap-Fennians (forest tribes), supporting the second etymology. It was popularized and became the standard terminology by the work of [[Johannes Schefferus]], ''[[Lapponia (book)|Acta Lapponica]]'' (1673), but was also used earlier by [[Olaus Magnus]] in his ''Description of the Northern peoples'' (1555). There is another suggestion that it originally meant &quot;wilds&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} An alternative interpretation, made by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese philosopher]] [[Damião de Góis]] in 1540, derives ''Lapland'' from &quot;the dumb and lazy land&quot;, because a land where no vegetables grow is lazy and does not speak.

Across the Nordic areas ''Lapp'' is common in place names, such as in Norway, e.g., ''Lappetjørna'' ([[Hordaland]]); in Finland, e.g., ''Lappi'' ([[Länsi-Suomen lääni]]) and ''Lapinlahti'' ([[Itä-Suomen lääni]]); and in Sweden, e.g., ''Lapp'' ([[Stockholm County]]), ''Lappe'' ([[Södermanland]]) and ''Lappabo'' ([[Småland]]). The noun ''Lapp'' is an indication that the Sami people and Nordic history are related to a larger ancient history of [[Europe]].

In the [[Northern Sami language|North Sámi language]], ''láhppon olmmoš'' means a person who is lost (from the verb láhppot, to get lost).

[[File:LocationSapmi.png|thumb|Homeland of the Sámi people]]

The term ''Finn'' is occasionally used locally for the Sámi people in Norway,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= In Northern Mists: Arctic Exploration in Early Times|last= Nansen |first= Fridtjof |year=1911 |publisher=Frederick A. Strokes company|location= |page=204 |page=149| url=http://www.archive.org/details/innorthernmists01nansgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas local Finnish speakers are called [[kvæn]]. ''Finn'' seems to have been in much wider use in ancient times, judging from the names ''[[Fenni]]'' and ''[[Phinnoi]]'' in classical [[Latin literature|Roman]] and [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek works]].

Sámi refer to themselves as ''Sámit'' (the Sámis) or ''Sápmelaš'' (of Sámi kin), the word ''Sámi'' being [[grammatical inflection|inflected]] into various grammatical forms. It has been proposed that Sámi (presumably [[Loanword|borrowed]] from the Proto-Finnic word), ''Häme'' (Finnish for [[Tavastia (historical province)|Tavastia]]) (&lt; [[Finnic languages|Proto-Finnic]] *''šämä'', the second ''ä'' still being found in the archaic derivation ''Häm'''ä'''läinen''), and perhaps ''Suomi'' (Finnish for Finland) (&lt; *''sōme-''/''sōma-'', compare ''suom'''a'''lainen'', supposedly borrowed from a [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] source *''sōma-'' from [[Baltic languages|Proto-Baltic]] *''sāma-'', in turn borrowed from Proto-Finnic *''šämä'') are of the same origin and ultimately borrowed from the [[Baltic languages|Baltic]] word ''*žēmē'', meaning &quot;land&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgr.fi/ct/ct51.html Article on the subject by the Finno-Ugrian Society.]&lt;/ref&gt; The Baltic word is [[cognate]] with [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] ''земля (zemlja)'', which also means &quot;land&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Derksen|first=Rick|title=Etymological Dictionary of the Slavic Inherited Lexicon|year=2007|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|page=542}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Sámi institutions — notably the parliaments, radio and TV stations, theatres, etc. — all use the term ''Sámi'', including when addressing outsiders in Norwegian, Swedish, Finnish, or English. In Norwegian, the Sámi are today referred to by the Norwegianized form ''same'', whereas the word ''lapp'' would be considered archaic and pejorative.

Terminological issues in Finnish are somewhat different. Finns living in [[Finnish Lapland]] generally call themselves ''lapp'''i'''lainen'', whereas the similar word for the Sámi people is ''lapp'''a'''lainen''. This can be confusing for foreign visitors because of the similar lives Finns and Sámi people live today in Lapland. Lappalainen is also a common family name in Finland. As in the Scandinavian languages, ''lappalainen'' is often considered archaic or pejorative, and ''saamelainen'' is used instead, at least in official contexts.

Petroglyphs and archeological findings such as settlements dating from about 10,000&amp;nbsp;B.C. can be found in the traditional lands of the Sami.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} The now-obsolete term for the archaeological culture of these hunters and gatherers of the late Paleolithic and early Mesolithic is [[Komsa]]. A cultural continuity between these stone-age people and the Sami can be assumed due to evidence such as the similarities in the decoration patterns of archeological bone objects and Sami decoration patterns, and there is no archeological evidence of this population being replaced by another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The ski-going people - Early history |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= galdu.org Resource Centre for the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and Harry Johansen|year= |publisher=Galdu:Resource Centre for the Rights of Indigenous Peoples  |url=http://www.galdu.org/web/index.php?artihkkal=320&amp;giella1=eng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent archaeological discoveries in Finnish Lapland were originally seen as the continental version of the Komsa culture about the same age as the earliest finds on the coast of Norway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Earliest Postglacial Inland Settlement of Lapland |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors=Tuija Rankama &amp; Jarmo Kankaanpää |year=2007 |publisher=Kamennyi Vek Evropeiskogo Severa |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Survey and excavation at Lake Vetsijärvi, Lapland in: People, material culture and environment in the North |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors=Tuija Rankama &amp; Jarmo Kankaanpää |year=2004 |publisher=Proceedings of the 22nd Nordic Archaeological Conference, University of Oulu|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is hypothesized that the Komsa followed receding glaciers inland from the Arctic coast at the end of the last ice age (between 11,000 and 8000 years B.C.) as new land opened up for settlement (e.g., modern Finnmark area in the northeast, to the coast of the Kola Peninsula).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Подобная точка зрения была всё ещё распространена в 1980-е годы: The Paleohistory of Circumpolar Arctic Colonization  |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors=JANUSZ KOZLOWSKI and H.-G.

===Southern limits of Sami settlement in the past===
How far south the Sami extended in the past has been debated among historians and archeologists for many years. The Norwegian historian [[Yngvar Nielsen]], commissioned by the Norwegian government in 1889 to determine this question in order to settle contemporary questions of Sami land rights, concluded that the Sami had lived no farther south than [[Lierne]] in [[Nord-Trøndelag]] county until around 1500, when they started moving south, reaching the area around Lake [[Femunden]] in the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Yngvar Nielsen|authorlink= Yngvar Nielsen|year=1891 |title= Lappernes fremrykning mot syd i Trondhjems stift og Hedemarkens amt |trans_title=The incursion of Lapps southwards in the see of Trondhjem and county of Hedemarken |journal=Det norske geografiske selskabs årbog |volume=1 |issue=1889-1890 |pages=18–52 |location=Kristiania |language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis is still accepted among many historians, but has been the subject of scholarly debate in the 21st century. In recent years, several archaeological finds indicate a Sami presence in Southern Norway in the Middle Ages, and Southern Sweden,&lt;ref name=&quot;Broadbent&quot;/&gt; including finds in [[Lesja]], in [[Vang, Oppland|Vang]] in [[Valdres]] and in [[Hol]] and [[Ål]] in [[Hallingdal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gjerde&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author= Hege Skalleberg Gjerde|year=2009 |title=Samiske tufter i Hallingdal? |trans_title=Sami foundations in Hallingdal? |journal=Viking |volume=72 |issue=2009 |pages=197–210 |publisher= Norwegian Archaeological Society |location=Oslo |language=Norwegian }}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the Sami interpretations of these finds assume a mixed population of Norse and Sami people in the mountainous areas of Southern Norway in the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gjerde&quot;&gt;{{rp|208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins of the Norwegian Sea Sami===
====The bubonic plague====
Until the arrival of the [[bubonic plague]] of 1349 in northern Norway, the Sami and the Norwegians occupied very separate economic [[Ecological niche|niches]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lavvu.com/geno/SamiArtical.html ''Pursuing Sami Genealogy'', Christopher Pesklo, Retrieved November 8, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Sami hunted reindeer and fished for their own livelihood.  The Norwegians, concentrated on the outer islands and outer sections of the [[fjords]], were connected to the greater European trade routes; did marginal farming in the [[Nordland]], [[Troms]], and [[Finnmark]] counties; and fished for trade products from the south.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Przemyslaw Urbanczyk, Medieval Arctic Norway, Institute of the History of Material Culture, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, 1992, 255 ISBN 83-900213-0-7&lt;/ref&gt; The two groups co-existed using two different food resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; According to old Nordic texts, the Sea Sami and the Mountain Sami are two classes of the same people and not two different ethnic groups as had been erroneously believed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title= In Northern Mists: Dagligt Liv i Norden i det sekstende Aarhundrede|last= Troels-Lund |first= Fredrik|year=1914 |publisher=Gyldendalske Boghandel, Nordisk Forlag|location=København, Kristiania |page=130 |page=129| url=http://runeberg.org/dagligt/1/0182.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This social economic balance greatly changed with the introduction of the bubonic plague in northern Norway in December 1349.  The Norwegians were closely connected to the greater European trade routes, along which the plague traveled; consequently, they were infected and died at a far higher rate than Sami in the interior.

Because of the huge economic profits that could be had from these fisheries, the local authorities offered incentives to the Sami &amp;ndash; faced with their own population pressures &amp;ndash; to settle on the newly vacant farms.&lt;ref&gt;Przemyslaw Urbanczyk, Medieval Arctic Norway, Institute of the History of Material Culture, Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, 1992, 255-256 ISBN 83-900213-0-7&lt;/ref&gt;  This started the economic division between the Sea Sami (''sjøsamene''), who fished extensively off the coast, and the Mountain Sami (''fjellsamene, innlandssamene''), who continued to hunt (among other, small-game animals), and later herd, reindeer.  Even as late as the early 18th century, there were many Sami who were still settling on these farms left abandoned from the 1350s.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkebøker, Kvæfjord Parish, Godfjord Botten, 1758.

In contemporary times, there are also ongoing consultations between the Government of Norway and the Sami Parliament regarding the right of the coastal Sami to fish in the seas on the basis of historical use and international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|title=Report of UNPFII - Ninth Session of the United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues  |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors=  |year=2010 |publisher=UNESCO |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=| url=http://www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/en/session_ninth.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; State regulation of sea fisheries underwent drastic change in the late 1980s. The regulation linked quotas to vessels and not to fishers. These newly calculated quotas were distributed free of cost to larger vessels on the basis of the amount of the catch in previous years, resulting in small vessels in Sami districts falling outside the new quota system to a large degree.&lt;ref name=&quot;un.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johansen 2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite document|title=Kasta på land (Forced Ashore) |last=Johansen |first=Harry |authorlink= |coauthors=Torill Olsen |year=2010 |publisher=SIL International |location=Norway |isbn= |page= |pages=| url=|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

====Mountain Sami====
As the Sea Sami settled along Norway's [[fjord]]s and inland waterways pursuing a combination of farming, cattle raising, trapping and fishing, the smaller minority of the Mountain Sami continued to hunt wild [[reindeer]]. Around 1500, they started to tame these animals into herding groups, becoming the well-known reindeer nomads, often portrayed by outsiders as following the archetypal Sami lifestyle.  The Mountain Sami faced the fact that they had to pay taxes to three nation-states, [[Kalmar Union|Norway]], [[Early Vasa era|Sweden]] and [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Russia]], as they crossed the borders of each of the respective countries following the annual reindeer migrations, which caused much resentment over the years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuiper 1990s&quot;&gt;{{Cite article|title= Christianity and the Emerging Nation States|last= Kuiper |first= Andrea (Elle)|year=1990s? |publisher=University of Texas|location=Texas |page= |page=| url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/sami/diehtu/siida/christian/nationstate.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Sweden made the Sami work in a slavemine at Nasafjäll, causing many Samis to flee from the area, so a large part of the provinces previously used by Pite and Lule Samis is depopulated.

====Post-1800s====
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2011}}
For long periods of time, the Sami lifestyle thrived because of its adaptation to the [[Arctic]] environment. Indeed, throughout the 18th century, as Norwegians of Northern Norway suffered from low fish prices and consequent depopulation, the Sami cultural element was strengthened, since the Sami were mostly independent of supplies from Southern Norway.
[[File:Pitesamisk beiarn 2005.jpg|thumb|A [[Pite Sami]] from [[Beiarn]]]]

However, during the 19th century, Norwegian authorities put the Sami culture under pressure in order to make the Norwegian language and [[Culture of Norway|culture]] universal. A strong economic development of the north also took place, giving Norwegian culture and language status. On the Swedish and Finnish side, the authorities were much less militant in their efforts, though Sami language was forbidden in schools; strong economic development in the north led to a weakening of status and economy for the Sami. In 1913-1920, the Swedish race-segregation politic created a race biological institute that collected research material from living people, graves, and sterilized Sami women. Throughout history, settlers were encouraged to move to the northern regions through incentives such as land and water rights,  tax allowances, and military exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article|title= The Sami vs. Outsiders|last= Woodard |first= Káre (Kimmi)|year=1990s? |publisher=University of Texas|location=Texas |page= |page=| url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/sami/dieda/hist/sami-west.htm#immigration}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The strongest pressure took place from around 1900 to 1940, when Norway invested considerable money and effort to wipe out Sami culture. Notably, anyone who wanted to buy or lease state lands for agriculture in [[Finnmark]] had to prove knowledge of the Norwegian language and had to register with a Norwegian name. This and similar actions in Scandinavian countries, e.g., the sterilization of Sami women by Swedish authorities, are debated to be an act of ethnic cleansing, and perhaps a genocide. This also ultimately caused the [[dislocation of Sami people]] in the 1920s, which increased the gap between local Sami groups (something still present today) and sometimes bears the character of an internal Sami ethnic conflict. In 1913, the Norwegian parliament passed a bill on &quot;native act land&quot; to allocate the best and most useful lands to the Norwegian settlers. Another factor was the [[scorched earth]] policy conducted by the German army, resulting in heavy [[Lapland War|war destruction]] in northern Finland and northern Norway in 1944&amp;ndash;45, destroying all existing houses, or kota, and visible traces of Sami culture. After [[World War II]], the pressure was relaxed somewhat, though the legacy was evident into recent times, such as the 1970s law limiting the size of any house that Sami people were allowed to build. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The [[Alta controversy|controversy]] around the construction of the hydro-electric power station in [[Alta, Norway|Alta]] in 1979 brought Sami rights onto the political agenda. In August 1986, the national anthem (&quot;[[Sámi soga lávlla]]&quot;) and flag ([[Sami flag]]) of the Sami people were created. In 1989, the first Sami parliament in Norway was elected. In 2005, the [[Finnmark Act]] was passed in the [[Storting|Norwegian parliament]]. This law gives the Sami parliament and the Finnmark Provincial council a joint responsibility of administering the land areas previously considered state property. These areas (96% of the provincial area), which have always been used primarily by the Sami, now belong officially to the people of the province, whether Sami or Norwegian, and not to the Norwegian state.

====Contemporary====
The indigenous Sami population is a mostly urbanised demographic, but a substantial number live in villages in the high arctic. The Sami still have cultural consequences of language and culture loss related to Sami generations taken to missionary and/or state-run boarding schools and the legacy of laws that were created to deny the Sami rights (e.g., to their beliefs, language, land and to the practice of traditional livelihoods). The Sami are experiencing cultural and environmental threats,&lt;ref name=&quot;Korpijaakko-Mikkel March 22, 2009&quot;/&gt;  including oil exploration, mining, dam building, logging, climate change, military bombing ranges, tourism and commercial development.

; Natural-resource prospecting

Sapmi, which is rich in precious metals, oil, and natural gas, is also threatened by mining operations. Mining prospects in Arctic Sapmi are also causing controversy when they are in grazing and calving areas. Mining projects are rejected by the Sami Parliament in the Finnmark area. The Sami Parliament demands that resources and mineral exploration should benefit mainly the local Sami communities and population, as the proposed mines are in Sami lands and will affect their ability to maintain a traditional livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mining prospects in arctic Norway also causing controversy |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010  |publisher=NRK |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=| url=http://www.newsinenglish.no/2010/04/23/prospects-bright-for-arctic-mining/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mining locations even include ancient Sami spaces that are designated as ecologically protected areas, such as Vindelfjällen nature reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blackstone to Mine Reindeer Pastures, Sweden |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010  |publisher=EALAT |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=| url=http://icr.arcticportal.org/index.php?option=com_hwdvideoshare&amp;task=viewvideo&amp;Itemid=34&amp;video_id=73&amp;lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia's Kola Peninsula, vast areas have already been destroyed by mining and smelting activities, and further development is imminent. This includes oil and natural gas exploration in the Barents Sea. There is a gas pipeline across the Kola Peninsula. Oil spills affect fishing and the construction of roads. Power lines may cut off access to reindeer calving grounds and sacred sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Shtokman Gas Project, Russia |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=| url=http://www.hydrocarbons-technology.com/projects/shtokman_gas_project/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Logging

In northern Finland, there has been a longstanding dispute over the destruction of forests, which prevents reindeer from migrating between seasonal feeding grounds and destroys supplies of lichen that grow on the upper branches of older trees. This lichen is their only source of sustenance during winter months, when snow is deep. The logging has been under the control of the state-run forest system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Last Yoik of Saami Forests? |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=| url=http://www.der.org/films/last-yoik.html|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Industrial logging has now been pushed back from the most important forest areas either permanently or for the next 20 years, though there are still threats, such as mining and construction plans of holiday resorts on the protected shorelines of Lake Inari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Campaign for Northern Forests by Indigenous Sami Ended Successfully in Finland |last=Ove Varsi |first=Magne |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010  |publisher=Gáldu: Resource Centre for the Rights of Indigenous Peoples |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=| url=http://www.galdu.org/web/index.php?odas=4995&amp;giella1=eng}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Military activities

Government authorities and NATO have bombing-practice ranges in Sami areas in northern Norway and Sweden. These regions have served as reindeer calving and summer grounds for thousands of years, and contain many ancient Sami sacred sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New bombing ranges and their impact on Saami traditions |last=Nellemann |first=Christian |authorlink= |coauthors=Ingunn Vistnes |year=October 2003  |publisher=The Environment Times/Polar Times |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=| url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=Aigi (Time) |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008  |publisher=Riho Västrik/Vesilind Studios, Uldis Cekulis/Vides

[[File:Suorvajaure in stora sjofallet park.jpg|thumb|left|[[Suorvajaure]] near [[Piteå]]]]

; Land rights

The Swedish government has allowed the world's largest onshore wind farm to be built in Piteå, in the Arctic region where the Eastern Kikkejaure village has its winter reindeer pastures. The wind farm will consist of more than 1,000 wind turbines, one 80 mil and an extensive road infrastructure, which means that the feasibility of using the area for winter grazing in practice is impossible. Sweden has received strong international criticism, including by the UN Racial Discrimination Committee and the Human Rights Committee, that Sweden violates Sami ''landrättigheter'' (land rights), including for not regulating industry.
; Water rights

State regulation of sea fisheries underwent drastic change in the late 1980s. The regulation linked quotas to vessels and not to fishers. These newly calculated quotas were distributed free of cost to larger vessels on the basis of the amount of the catch in previous years, resulting in small vessels in Sami districts falling outside the new quota system to a large degree.

The Sami recently stopped a water-prospecting venture that threatened to turn an ancient sacred site and natural spring called Suttesaja into a large-scale water-bottling plant for the world market—without notification or consultation with the local Sami people, who make up 70 percent of the population. The Finnish National Board of Antiquities has registered the area as a heritage site of cultural and historical significance, and the stream itself is part of the Deatnu/Tana watershed, which is home to Europe's largest salmon river, an important source of Sami livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Suttesaja: from a sacred Sami site and natural spring to a water bottling plant?

; Climate change and environment

Reindeer have major cultural and economic significance for indigenous peoples of the North. The human-ecological systems in the North, like reindeer pastoralism, are sensitive to change, perhaps more than in virtually any other region of the globe, due in part to the variability of the Arctic climate and ecosystem and the characteristic ways of life of indigenous Arctic peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Reindeer Herders Vulnerability Network Study  |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors=EALÁT |year=2010  |publisher=EALÁT |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=| url=http://icr.arcticportal.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=245&amp;Itemid=86&amp;lang=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1986 [[Chernobyl nuclear disaster]] caused nuclear fallout in the sensitive Arctic ecosystems and poisoned fish, meat and berries. Lichens and mosses are two of the main forms of vegetation in the Arctic and are highly susceptible to airborne pollutants and heavy metals. Since many do not have roots, they can absorb nutrients, and toxic compounds, through their leaves. The lichens accumulated airborne radiation, and 73,000 reindeer had to be destroyed as &quot;unfit&quot; for human consumption in Sweden alone. The government promised Sami indemnification, which was not acted upon by government.

Radioactive wastes and spent nuclear fuel have been stored in the waters off the Kola Peninsula, including locations that are only &quot;two kilometers&quot; from places where Sami live. There are a minimum of five &quot;dumps&quot; where spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste are being deposited in the Kola Peninsula, often with little concern for the surrounding environment or population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Мы живем на ядерной помойке: Почему вымирают коренные народы Севера |last=Rykov |first=Sergey |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010  |publisher= |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=| url=http://www.stoletie.ru/obschestvo/my_zhivem_na_jadernoj_pomojke_2010-04-21.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; Tourism

The tourism industry in Finland has been criticized for turning Sami culture into a marketing tool by promoting opportunities to experience &quot;authentic&quot; Sami ceremonies and lifestyle. At many tourist locales, non-Samis dress in inaccurate replicas of Sami traditional clothing, and gift shops sell coarse reproductions of Sami handicraft. One popular &quot;ceremony&quot;, crossing the Arctic Circle, actually has no significance in Sami spirituality. To the Sami, this is an insulting display of cultural exploitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article|title=Protests against the exploitation of Sami culture|last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors=|year=  |publisher=Suoma Sami Nuorat |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=| url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
To make up for past suppression, the authorities of Norway, Sweden and Finland now make an effort to build up Sami cultural institutions and promote Sami culture and language.

===Duodji (craft)===
{{Main|Duodji}}
[[File:Sami knives - Arctic Museum.jpg|thumb|Sami knives]]
[[File:Sami belt and needle cases.JPG|thumb|Beaded belt, knife, and antler needlecase]]
[[File:Sami woman with white reindeer.jpg|thumb|left|Sami woman from [[Sweden]]]]
Duodji, the Sami handicraft, originates from the time when the Samis were self-supporting nomads, believing therefore that an object should first and foremost serve a purpose rather than being primarily decorative. Men mostly use wood, bone, and antlers to make items such as antler-handled scrimshawed [[sami knife|sami knives]], [[sami drum|drums]], and [[guksi]] (burl cups). Women used leather and roots to make items such as [[gákti]] (clothing), and birch- and spruce-root woven baskets.

===Clothing===
{{Main|Gákti}}

Gakti are the traditional clothing worn by the Sámi people. The gákti is worn both in ceremonial contexts and while working, particularly when herding reindeer.

Traditionally, the gákti was made from reindeer leather and sinews, but nowadays, it is more common to use wool, cotton, or silk. Women's gákti typically consist of a dress, a fringed shawl that is fastened with 1-3 silver brooches, and boots/shoes made of reindeer fur or leather. Boots can have pointed or curled toes and often have band-woven ankle wraps. Eastern Sami boots have a rounded toe on reindeer-fur boots, lined with felt and with beaded details. There are different gákti for women and men; men's gákti have a shorter &quot;jacket-skirt&quot; than a women's long dress. Traditional gákti are most commonly in variations of red, blue, green, white, medium-brown tanned leather, or reindeer fur. In winter, there is the addition of a reindeer fur coat and leggings, and sometimes a poncho and rope/lasso.

The colours, patterns and the jewellery of the gákti indicate where a person is from, if a person is single or married, and sometimes can even be specific to their family. The collar, sleeves and hem usually have appliqués in the form of geometric shapes. Some regions have ribbonwork, others have tin embroidery, and some Eastern Sami have beading on clothing or collar. Hats vary by gender, season, and region. They can be wool, leather, or fur. They can be embroidered, or in the East, they are more like a beaded cloth crown with a shawl. Some traditional shamanic headgear had animal hides, plaits, and feathers, particularly in East Sapmi.

The gákti can be worn with a belt; these are sometimes band-woven belts, woven, or beaded. Leather belts can have scrimshawed antler buttons, silver concho-like buttons, tassles, or brass/copper details such as rings. Belts can also have beaded leather pouches, antler needle cases, accessories for a fire, copper rings, amulets, and often a carved and/or scrimshawed antler handled knife. Some Eastern Sami also have a hooded jumper (малиц) from reindeer skins with wool inside and above the knee boots.

* There are short daily news bulletins in Northern Sámi on national TV in [[Norway]], [[Sweden]] and [[Finland]]. [[Children's television]] shows in Sami are also frequently made. There is also a radio station for Northern Sámi, which has some news programs in the other [[Sámi languages]].
* A single daily newspaper is published in Northern Sami, ''[[Ávvir]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://lotta.yle.fi/srwebanar.nsf/sivut/samimediat?opendocument&amp;pageid=Content65D79-5 |title= Aviissat ja bládit | trans_title = Newspapers |author= |date= |work= |publisher= YLE Sámi Radio |accessdate=April 9, 2010 | language = Northern Sámi}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with a few magazines.
* There is a Sámi theatre, [[Beaivváš Sámi Theatre|Beaivvaš]], in Kautokeino on the Norwegian side, as well as in Kiruna on the Swedish side. Both tour the entire Sámi area with drama written by Sámi authors or international translations.
* A number of novels and poetry collections are published every year in Northern Sámi, and sometimes in the other Sámi languages as well. The largest Sami Publishing house is Davvi Girji.

===Music===
{{Main|Sami music}}
A characteristic feature of Sami musical tradition is the singing of ''yoik''/''[[joik]]''. Yoiks are song-chants and are traditionally sung ''[[a cappella]]'', usually sung slowly and deep in the throat with apparent emotional content of sorrow or anger. Yoiks can be dedicated to animals and birds in nature, special people or special occasions, and they can be joyous, sad or melancholic. They often are based on syllablic improvisation. In recent years, musical instruments frequently accompany yoiks. The only traditional Sami instruments that were sometimes used to accompany yoik are the &quot;fadno&quot; flute (made from reed-like Angelica archangelica stems) and hand drums (frame drums and bowl drums).

===Education===
* Education with Sami as the first language is available in all four countries, and also outside the Sami area.
* [[Sami University College]] is located in Kautokeino. Sami language is studied in several universities in all countries, most notably the [[University of Tromsø]], which considers Sami a mother tongue, not a foreign language.

===Festivals and markets===
* Numerous Sami festivals throughout the Sápmi area celebrate different aspects of the Sami culture. The best-known on the Norwegian side is [[Riddu Riđđu]], though there are others, such as [[Ijahis Idja]] in [[Inari, Finland|Inari]]. Among the most festive are the Easter festivals taking place in [[Kautokeino]] and [[Karasjok]] prior to the springtime reindeer migration to the coast. These festivals combine traditional culture with modern phenomena such as snowmobile races.

===Reindeer husbandry===
{{Main|Reindeer#Reindeer husbandry}}
[[File:Reindeer herding.jpg|thumb|Reindeer [[herding]]]]
Reindeer husbandry has been, and is, an important aspect of Sami culture. During the years of [[forced assimilation]], the areas in which reindeer herding was an important livelihood were among the few where the Sami culture and language survived.

Today, in Norway and Sweden, reindeer husbandry is legally protected as an exclusive Sami livelihood, such that only persons of Sami descent with a linkage to a reindeer herding family can own, and hence make a living off, reindeer. Presently, about 2,800 people are engaged in reindeer herding in Norway.&lt;ref name=&quot;galdu.org&quot;/&gt; In Finland, reindeer husbandry is not exclusive and is practiced to a limited degree also by ethnic Finns. Legally, it is restricted to [[EU]]/[[European Economic Area|EEA]] nationals resident in the area. In the north (Lapland), it plays a major role in the local economy, while its economic impact is lesser in the southern parts of the area ([[Province of Oulu]]).

Among the reindeer herders in the Saami villages, the women usually have a higher level of formal education in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://umu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:416689/FULLTEXT01 | format = PDF | title = Mental health problems among the Swedish reindeer-herding Sami population | author = Niclas Kaiser | journal = Umeå University Medical Dissertations, New Series | volume = 1430 | year = 2011 | accessdate = 2012-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sami policy==
===Norway===
[[File:Samediggi03.jpg|thumb|[[Sami Parliament of Norway]]]]
The Sami have been recognized as an [[indigenous people]] in Norway (1990 according to [[Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, 1989|ILO convention 169]] as described below), and hence, according to international law, the Sami people in Norway are entitled special protection and rights. The legal foundation of the Sami policy is:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galdu.org/govat/doc/eng_foundation.pdf Galdu.org]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Article 110a of the [[Norwegian Constitution]].
* The Sami Act (act of 12 June 1987 No. 56 concerning the Sami Parliament (the Sámediggi) and other legal matters pertaining to the Samis).

The constitutional amendment states: &quot;It is the responsibility of the authorities of the State to create conditions enabling the Sami people to preserve and develop its language, culture and way of life.&quot; This provides a legal and political protection of the Sami language, culture and society. In addition the &quot;amendment implies a legal, political and moral obligation for Norwegian authorities to create an environment conducive to the Samis themselves influencing on the development of the Sami community&quot; (ibid.).

The Sami Act provides special rights for the Sami people (ibid.):

In addition, the Sami have special rights to reindeer husbandry.

The Norwegian Sami Parliament also elects 50% of the members to the board of the [[Finnmark Estate]], which controls 95% of the land in the county of [[Finnmark]].

Norway has also accepted international conventions, declarations and agreements applicable to the Sami as a minority and indigenous people including:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galdu.org/govat/doc/eng_norways.pdf Galdu.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 27 protects minorities, and indigenous peoples, against discrimination: &quot;In those states in which ethnic, religious or linguistic minorities exist, persons belonging to such minorities, shall not be denied the right, in community with the other members of their group, to enjoy their own culture, to profess and practice their own religion, or use their own language.&quot;
* ILO Convention No. 169 concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples in Independent Countries (1989). The convention states that rights for the indigenous peoples to land and natural resources are recognized as central for their material and cultural survival. In addition, indigenous peoples should be entitled to exercise control over, and manage, their own institutions, ways of life and economic development in order to maintain and develop their identities, languages and religions, within the framework of the states in which they live.

===Sweden===
[[File:Sametinget - Sami Parliament of Sweden.JPG|thumb|[[Sami Parliament]] in Sweden]]
The Sametingslag was established as the Swedish Sami Parliament as of 1 January 1993. Sweden recognised the existence of the &quot;Sami nation&quot; in 1989, but the ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention, C169 has not been adopted. All indigenous rights are currently banned.

The Compulsory School Ordinance states that Sami pupils are entitled to be taught in their native language; however, a municipality is only obliged to arrange mother-tongue teaching in Sami if a suitable teacher is available and the pupil has a basic knowledge of Sami.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In 2010, after 14 years of negotiation, Laponiatjuottjudus, an association with Sami majority control, will govern the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] [[Laponian area|Laponia]]. The reindeer-herding law will apply in the area as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Swedish Sami National Association (SSR)|url=http://www.nsd.se//nyheter/artikel.aspx?ArticleID=5408663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Sweden formally apologized for the wrongs committed against the Sami.

===Finland===
[[File:Yllastunturi Finland.jpg|left|thumb|Land near [[Ylläs]]]]
The act establishing the Finnish Sami Parliament (Finnish: Saamelaiskäräjät) was passed on November 9, 1973.
Finland recognized the Sami as a &quot;people&quot; in 1995, but they have yet to ratify ILO Convention 169 Concerning Indigenous and Tribal Peoples.
[[File:Map of Lapland, Finland-fi.svg|thumb|[[Lapland (Finland)|Finnish Lapland]]. The three northernmost municipalities Utsjoki, Inari and Enontekiö and part of Sodankylä is officially considered the Sami area.]]

Finland ratified the 1966 U.N. Covenant on Civil and Political Rights though several cases brought before the U.N. Human Rights Committee. Of those, 36 cases involved a determination of the rights of individual Sami in Finland and Sweden. The committee decisions clarify that Sami are members of a minority within the meaning of Article 27 and that deprivation or erosion of their rights to practice traditional activities that are an essential element of their culture do come within the scope of Article 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jouni E.

Sami have had some access to Sami language instruction (in some schools) since 1970s, and language rights were established in 1992. There are three Sami languages spoken in Finland: North Sami, Skolt Sami and Inari Sami. Of these languages, Inari Sami, which is spoken by about 350 speakers, is the only one that is used entirely within borders of Finland, mainly in the municipality of Inari.

Finland has denied any aboriginal rights or land rights to the Sami people;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite article|title= Multiculturalism Policies in Contemporary Democracies, Indigenous Peoples, Finland|coauthors=Keith Banting (School of Policy Studies) and Will Kymlicka (Department of Philosophy)|year= |publisher=Queen's University|location=Canada |page= |page=| url=http://www.queensu.ca/mcp/indigenouspeople/evidence-1/Finland.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2011|any rights?}} in Finland, non-Sami can herd reindeer as well.

In April 1999, the Russian Duma passed a law that guarantees socio-economic and cultural development to all indigenous minorities, protecting traditional living places and acknowledging some form of limited ownership of territories that have traditionally been used for hunting, herding, fishing, and gathering activities. The law, however, does not anticipate the transfer of title in fee simply to indigenous minorities. The law does not recognize development rights, some proprietary rights including compensation for damage to the property, and limited exclusionary rights. It is not clear, however, whether protection of nature in the traditional places of inhabitation implies a right to exclude conflicting uses that are destructive to nature or whether they have the right to veto development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osherenko&quot;/&gt;

The Russian Federation's Land Code reinforces the rights of numerically small peoples (&quot;indigenous minorities&quot;) to use places they inhabit and to continue traditional economic activities without being charged rent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osherenko&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Northern peoples of Russia on the path to the new millennium |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors=PV.

Furthermore, indigenous minorities and ethnic groups are allowed to use environmentally protected lands and lands set aside as nature preserves to engage in their traditional modes of land use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osherenko&quot;/&gt;

Regional law, Code of the [[Murmansk Oblast]], calls on the organs of state power of the oblast to facilitate the native peoples of the Kola North, specifically naming the Sami, &quot;in realization of their rights for preservation and development of their native language, national culture, traditions and customs.&quot; The third section of Article 21 states: &quot;In historically established areas of habitation, Sami enjoy the rights for traditional use of nature and [traditional] activities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Osherenko&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Мурманская гавань.jpg|left|thumb|Kola Bay]]

Throughout the Russian North, indigenous and local people are being denied rights to fish, hunt, use pastureland, or exercise control over resources upon which they and their ancestors have depended for centuries. The failure to protect indigenous ways, however, stems not from inadequacy of the written law, but rather from the failure to implement existing laws. Unfortunately, violations of the rights of indigenous peoples continue, and oil, gas, and mineral development and other activities (mining, timber cutting, commercial fishing, and tourism) that bring foreign currency into the Russian economy prevail over the rule of law.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osherenko&quot;/&gt;

The life ways and economy of indigenous peoples of the Russian North are based upon reindeer herding, fishing, terrestrial and sea mammal hunting, and trapping. Many groups in the Russian Arctic are semi-nomadic, moving seasonally to different hunting and fishing camps. These groups depend upon different types of environment at differing times of the year, rather than upon exploiting a single commodity to exhaustion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osherenko&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aboriginal peoples and the law: Indian, Metis and Inuit rights in Canada |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1985  |publisher=Bradford W.

In the Sami homeland on the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia, regional authorities closed a fifty-mile (eighty-kilometer) stretch of the Ponoi River (and other rivers) to local fishing and granted exclusive fishing rights to a commercial company offering catch-and-release fishing to sport fishers largely from abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Ponoi River Report: Sport Fishing in the Kola Peninsula |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1985  |publisher= Circumpolar Conservation Union |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=| url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/-arctic/articles/ ponoi-eng.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deprived the local Sami (see Article 21 of the Code of the Murmansk Oblast) of food for their families and community and of their traditional economic livelihood. Thus, closing the fishery to locals may have violated the test articulated by the U.N. Human Rights Committee and disregarded the Land Code, other legislative acts, and the 1992 Presidential decree. Sami are not only forbidden to fish in the eighty-kilometer stretch leased to the Ponoi River Company but are also required by regional laws to pay for licenses to catch a limited number of fish outside the lease area. Residents of remote communities have neither the power nor the resources to demand enforcement of their rights. Here and elsewhere in the circumpolar north, the failure to apply laws for the protection of indigenous peoples leads to &quot;criminalization&quot; of local indigenous populations who cannot survive without &quot;poaching&quot; resources that should be accessible to them legally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osherenko&quot;/&gt;

Although indigenous leaders in Russia have occasionally asserted indigenous rights to land and resources, to date there has been no serious or sustained discussion of indigenous group rights to ownership of land.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osherenko&quot;/&gt;

On 16 November 2005 in [[Helsinki]], a group of experts, led by former Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Norway Professor Carsten Smith, submitted a proposal for a Nordic Sami Convention to the annual joint meeting of the ministers responsible for Sami affairs in Finland, Norway and Sweden and the presidents of the three Sami Parliaments from the respective countries. This convention recognizes the Sami as one indigenous people residing across national borders in all three countries.  A set of minimum standards is proposed for the rights of developing the Sami language and culture and rights to land and water, livelihoods and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|title=Report on indigenous fishing rights in the seas with case studies from Australia and Norway |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=19–30 April 2010 |publisher=United Nations, Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues |location=New York |isbn= |page=19 |pages=| url=www.un.org/esa/socdev/unpfii/documents/E.C.19.2010.2EN.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention has not yet been ratified in the Nordic countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galdu.org/govat/doc/eng_nordic_sami_conv.pdf Galdu.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sápmi==
{{Main|Sápmi (area)}}

Sápmi is the name of the cultural region traditionally inhabited by the Sami people.  Non-Sami and many regional maps have often called this same region ''Lapland'' as there is considerable regional overlap between the two terms.  ''Lapland'' can be either misleading, offensive, or both, depending on the context and where this word is used, to the Sami.  Among the Sami people, ''Sápmi'' is strictly used and acceptable.

Sápmi is located in Northern Europe, includes the northern parts of [[Fennoscandia]] and spans four countries: Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia.

===Area===
[[File:Sapmi Lappland.jpg|thumb|[[Laponian area]] in [[Sápmi]], [[UNESCO World Heritage Site]]]]

There is no official geographic definition for the boundaries of Sápmi. However, the following counties and provinces are usually included:
* [[Dalarna County|Dalarnas Län]] county in Sweden
* [[Finnmark]] county in Norway
* [[Jämtland County|Jämtlands Län]] county in Sweden
* [[Lapland (Finland)|Lapland Region]] in Finland
* [[Murmansk Oblast|Murmansk]] oblast in Russia
* [[Nord-Trøndelag]] county in Norway
* [[Nordland]] county in Norway
* [[Norrbotten County|Norrbottens Län]] county in Sweden
* [[Troms]] county in Norway
* [[Västerbotten County|Västerbottens Län]] county in Sweden

The municipalities of [[Gällivare]], [[Jokkmokk]] and [[Arjeplog]] in Swedish Lappland were designated a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 1996 as a &quot;Laponian Area&quot;.

The [[Sami Domicile Area]] in Finland consists of the municipalities of [[Enontekiö]], [[Utsjoki]] and [[Inari, Finland|Inari]] as well as a part of the municipality of [[Sodankylä]].

==Demographics==
 [[File:Sami child.jpg|thumb|Sami child, 1923]]
 [[File:Sami family-easter.jpg|thumb|Sami family at spring celebration]]

In the geographical area of Sápmi, the Sami are a small population. According to some, the estimated total Sami population is about 70,000.&lt;ref&gt;According to the Swedish Sami parliament&lt;/ref&gt; One problem when attempting to count the population of the Sámi is that there are few common criteria of what &quot;being a Sámi&quot; constitutes. In addition, there are several Sámi languages and additional dialects, and there are several areas in [[Sápmi (area)|Sapmi]] where few of the Sami speak their [[Sami languages|native language]] due to the forced cultural assimilation, but still consider themselves Sami. Other identity markers are [[kinship]] (which can be said to, at some level or other, be of high importance for all Sámi), the geographical region of Sápmi where their family came from, and/or protecting or preserving certain aspects of [[Sami culture]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uoc.es/euromosaic/web/document/sami/an/i2/i2.html Institut de Sociolingüística Catalana], Retrieved January 4, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the Nordic Sámi Parliaments have included as the &quot;core&quot; criterion for registering as a Sámi the [[Cultural identity|identity]] in itself &amp;ndash; one must declare that one truly consider oneself a Sámi. Objective criteria vary, but are generally related to kinship and/or language.

Still, due to the [[cultural assimilation]] of the Sami people that had occurred in the four countries over the centuries, population estimates are difficult to measure precisely.&lt;ref&gt;[http://virtual.finland.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=25786 Virtual Finland], Retrieved January 4, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The population has been estimated to be between 80,000 and 135,000&lt;ref name=&quot;cia.gov&quot;&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/no.html CIA.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;norway.org.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.norway.org.uk/facts/sami/sami/sami.htm Norway.org.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; across the whole Nordic region, including urban areas such as [[Oslo]], Norway, traditionally considered outside Sápmi. The Norwegian state recognizes any Norwegian as Sámi if he or she has one great-grandparent whose home language was Sámi, but there is not, and has never been, any registration of the home language spoken by Norwegian people.

Roughly half of all Sámi live in Norway, but many live in Sweden, with smaller groups living in the far north of Finland and the [[Kola Peninsula]] of Russia. The Sámi in Russia were forced by the Soviet authorities to relocate to a collective called [[Lovozero (rural locality)|Lovozero]]/Lujávri, in the central part of the Kola Peninsula.

===Division by geography===

Sápmi is traditionally divided into:
* Eastern Sapmi (Kola peninsula, eastern Norway and Finland Sami regions)
* Northern Sápmi (most of northern parts of Norway, Sweden and Finland)
* Luleå Sápmi (Luleå River valley area)
* Southern Sápmi (southern Sweden and Norway Sami area)

It should also be noted that many Sami now live outside Sápmi, in large cities such as [[Oslo]] in Norway.

There are also two extinct Sami languages: [[Kemi Sami]] and [[Akkala Sami]].

Note that many Sami do not speak any of the Sami languages any more due to historical assimilation policies, so the number of Sami living in each area is much higher.

As with many indigenous languages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enduring Voices Project |last=F. Anderson |first=Gregory |authorlink= |coauthors= Dr. K. David Harrison and Chris Rainier|year=2008 |publisher=National Geographic |url=http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/enduring-voices/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt; all Sami languages are at some degree of endangerment, ranging from what [[Unesco|UNESCO]] defines as &quot;definitely endangered&quot; to &quot;critically endangered&quot; (and even &quot;extinct&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;F. Moseley 2009&quot;/&gt;

===Division by occupation===

A division often used in Northern Sami is based on occupation and the area of living. This division is also used in many historical texts:
* Non-reindeer Sami not living by the sea (in Northern Sami dalon). Non-nomadic Sami. Is now probably the largest group of Sami.
* Reindeer Sami (in Northern Sami boazosapmelash or badjeolmmosh). Previously nomadic Sami living as reindeer herders. Now most have a permanent residence in the Sami core areas. Some 10% of Sami practice reindeer herding, which is seen as a fundamental part of a Sami culture and, in some parts of the Nordic countries, can only be practiced by Samis.
* Sea Sami (in Northern Sami mearasapmelash). These lived traditionally by combining fishing and small-scale farming. Today, often used for all Sami from the coast regardless of their occupation.

Historical texts often divide the Sami into: Forest Sami, Mountain Sami, River Sami, and Eastern Sami.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galdu.org/web/index.php?sladja=25&amp;vuolitsladja=11&amp;giella1=eng Veli-Pekka Lehtola. &quot;The Multi-Faceted Land of the Sámi&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Division by country===

According to the Swedish Sami Parliament, the Sami population of Norway is 40,000. If all people who speak Sami or have a parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent who speaks or spoke Sami are included, the number reaches 70,000. As of 2005, 12,538 people were registered to vote in the election for the Sami Parliament in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samediggi.no/Artikkel.asp?AId=236&amp;back=1&amp;MId1=3&amp;MId2=104&amp;MId3=249 Norwegian Sami parliament web page on registered voters]&lt;/ref&gt; The bulk of the Sami live in Finnmark and Northern [[Troms]], but there are also Sami populations in Southern Troms, [[Nordland]] and [[Trøndelag]]. Due to recent migration, it has also been claimed that [[Oslo]] is the municipality with the largest Sami population. The Sami are in a majority only in the municipalities of [[Kautokeino|Guovdageaidnu-Kautokeino]], [[Karasjok|Karasjohka-Karasjok]], [[Porsanger]], [[Tana|Deatnu-Tana]] and [[Nesseby|Unjargga-Nesseby]] in Finnmark, and [[Gáivuotna]] (Kåfjord) in Northern Troms. This area is also known as the Sami core area. Sami and Norwegian are equal as administrative languages in this area.

According to the Swedish Sami Parliament, the Sami population of Sweden is about 20,000.

According to the Finnish Population Registry Center and the Finnish Sami Parliament, the Sami population living in Finland was 7,371 in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.samediggi.fi/vanha/suomi/toimieli/vaali/lukumaara_vuoden_2003_vaaleissa.pdf Regional division of Sami people in Finland by age] in 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 31 December 2006, only 1776 of them had registered to speak one of the Sami languages as the mother tongue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tilastokeskus.fi/til/vaerak/2006/vaerak_2006_2007-03-23_tie_001.html Finnish Population Registry Center 31.12.2006].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2002 census, the Sami population of Russia was 1,991.

Since 1926, the number of identified Sami in Russia has gradually increased:

*''Census 1926'': 1,720 (this number refers to the entire Soviet Union)
*''Census 1939'': 1,829
*''Census 1959'': 1,760
*''Census 1970'': 1,836
*''Census 1979'': 1,775
*''Census 1989'': 1,835
*''Census 2002'': 1,991

===Sami immigration outside of Sapmi===
[[File:RoundupNunivak1964FWS.jpg|left|thumb|Reindeer in [[Alaska]]]]

There are an estimated 30,000 people living in North America who are either Sami, or descendants of Sami.&lt;ref&gt;Baiki: The International Sami Journal http://www.baiki.org/content/about.htm Retrieved February 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Most have settled in areas that are known to have Norwegian, Swedish and Finnish immigrants. Some of these concentrated areas are [[Minnesota]], [[Iowa]], [[Wisconsin]], the [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan]], [[Illinois]], [[California]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Utah]] and Alaska; and throughout Canada, including the Canadian territories of the [[Northwest Territories]], [[Yukon]], and the territory now known as [[Nunavut]].

Descendants of these Sami immigrants typically know little of their heritage, because their ancestors purposely hid their indigenous culture to avoid discrimination from the dominating Scandinavian or Nordic culture. Though some of these Sami are diaspora that moved to North America in order to escape assimilation policies in their home countries, many continued to downplay their Sami culture in an internalization of colonial viewpoints about indigenous peoples and in order for them to try to blend into their respective Nordic cultures.  There were also several Sami families that were brought to North America with herds of reindeer by the U.S. and Canadian governments as part of the &quot;Reindeer Project&quot; designed teach the Inuit about reindeer herding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Following the Reindeer: an Inuit-Sami Chronology in Alaska |last=Fjeld |first=Faith |authorlink= |coauthors= Nathan Muus|year= |publisher=Baiki: The International Sami Journal |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=| url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of these Sami immigrants and descendants of immigrants are members of the [[Sami Siida of North America]].

There are the Sa'ami folks know about, and then there are the ones not known.  Back in the 1600s Sweden began the settlement of its New Sweden Colony (now Delaware) with families of Sa'ami rounded up in winter time.  This continued for a number of years with hundreds of trips between Sweden and America.{{cn|date=October 2012}}  

For a variety of reasons the Sa'ami relocated to the Chesapeake Bay area and to roughly what is now Lancaster county PA.  Later, with the arrival of the Quakers, they relocated to York county PA ~ just one of the reasons the county has the same township names as Lancaster.{{cn|date=October 2012}}

Over time that community expanded and moved West leaving behind a series of towns, townships, villages and small cities typified by having been named &quot;Deer ~ something&quot; or &quot;Union - something&quot;.  Some places have Christmas theme names ~ Santa Claus, Indiana, etc.{{cn|date=October 2012}}

==Organization==
Sápmi demonstrates a distinct semi-national identity that transcends the borders between Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. There is no movement for complete autonomy.{{cn|date=October 2012}}

===Sami Parliaments===
{{Main|Sami Parliaments}}
[[File:3NorwSamiPresidents.jpg|thumb|[[Sven-Roald Nystø]], [[Aili Keskitalo]] and [[Ole Henrik Magga]], the three first presidents of the [[Sami Parliament of Norway]].]]
The Sami Parliaments (''Sámediggi'' in [[Northern Sami]], ''Sämitigge'' in [[Inari Sami language|Inari Sami]], ''{{unicode|Sää´mte´ǧǧ}}'' in [[Skolt Sami]]) founded in Finland (1973), Norway (1989) and Sweden (1993) are the representative bodies for peoples of Sami heritage. Russia has not recognized the Sami as a minority and, as a result, recognizes no Sami parliament.  There is no single, unified Sami parliament that spans across the Nordic countries. Rather, each of the aforementioned three countries has set up their own separate legislatures for Sami people, even though the three Sami Parliaments often work together on cross-border issues.  In all three countries, they act as an institution of cultural autonomy for the indigenous Sami people. The parliaments have very weak political influence, far from autonomy. They are formally public authorities, ruled by the Scandinavian governments, but have democratically elected parliamentarians, whose mission is to work for the Sami people and culture. Candidates' election promises often get into conflict with the institutions' submission under their governments, but as authorities, they have some influence over the government.

===Norwegian organizations===
The main organisations for Sami representation in Norway are the ''siidas''. They cover northern and central Norway.

===Swedish organizations===
The main organisations for Sami representation in Sweden are the ''siidas''. They cover northern and central Sweden.

===Finnish organizations===
In contrast to Norway and Sweden, in Finland, a ''siida'' (''paliskunta'' in Finnish) is a reindeer-herding corporation that is not restricted by ethnicity. There are indeed some ethnic Finns who practice reindeer herding, and in principle, all residents of the reindeer herding area (most of Finnish Lapland and parts of Oulu province) who are citizens of [[European Economic Area|EEA]] countries,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finlex.fi/fi/laki/ajantasa/1990/19900848 Finlex.fi] {{fi icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; i.e., the [[European Union]] and Norway, [[Iceland]] and [[Liechtenstein]], are allowed.

===Russian organizations===
In 2010, the Sami Council supported the establishment of a cultural center in Russia for Arctic peoples. The Center for Northern Folk aims to promote artistic and cultural cooperation between the Arctic peoples of Russia and the  Nordic countries, with particular focus on indigenous peoples and minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senterfornordligefolk.no/frontpage.146031.en.html|title=Frontpage - Senter for Nordlige Folk AS|publisher = senterfornordligefolk.no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Border conflicts===
[[File:Glen1 Sweden.jpg|thumb|Land rights for grazing [[reindeer]]]]
Sápmi, the Sami traditional lands, cross four national borders. Traditional summer and winter pastures sometimes lie on different sides of the borders of the nation-states. In addition to that, there is a border drawn for modern-day [[Sápmi]]. Some state that the rights (for reindeer herding and, in some parts, even for fishing and hunting) include not only modern Sápmi but areas that are beyond today's Sápmi that reflect older territories. Today's &quot;borders&quot; originate from the 14th to 16th centuries when land-owning conflicts occurred. The establishment of more stable dwelling places and larger towns originates from the 16th century and was performed for strategic defence and economic reasons, both by peoples from Sami groups themselves and more southern immigrants.

Owning land within the borders or being a member of a ''[[siida]]'' (Sami corporation) gives rights. A different law enacted in Sweden in the mid-1990s gave the right to anyone to fish and hunt in the region, something that was met with large skepticism and anger amongst the ''siidas''.

Court proceedings have been common throughout history, and the aim from the Sami viewpoint is to reclaim territories used earlier in history. Due to a major defeat in 1996, one ''[[siida]]'' has introduced a sponsorship &quot;Reindeer Godfather&quot; concept to raise funds for further battles in courts. These &quot;internal conflicts&quot; are usually conflicts between non-Sami land owners and reindeer owners. Cases question the Sami ancient rights to reindeer pastures. In 2010, Sweden was criticized for its relations with the Sami in the Universal Periodic Review conducted by the Working Group of the Human Rights Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;lib.ohchr.org&quot;&gt;{{Cite report|title=Draft report of the Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors=  |year=3–14 May 2010, submitted 14 May 2010 |publisher=UN Human Rights Council Working Group on the Universal Periodic Review, Eighth Session, Geneva|location= |isbn= |page= |pages=| url=http://lib.ohchr.org/HRBodies/UPR/Documents/Session8/SE/A_HRC_WG.6_8_L.10_Sweden.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question whether the [[fjeld]]'s territory is owned by the governments (crown land) or by the Sami population is not answered.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

From an indigenous perspective, people &quot;belong to the land&quot;, the land does not belong to people, but this does not mean that hunters, herders, and fishing people do not know where the borders of their territories are located as well as those of their neighbors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osherenko&quot;/&gt;

==National symbols==
Although the Sami have considered themselves to be one people throughout history, the idea of Sápmi, a Sami [[nation]], first gained acceptance among the Sami in the 1970s, and even later among the majority population. During the 1980s and 1990s, a flag was created, a national song was written, and the date of a national day was settled.

===Flag===
{{Main|Sami flag}}[[File:Sami flag.svg|thumb|Sami flag]]

The Sami flag was inaugurated during the Sami Conference in [[Åre]], Sweden, on 15 August 1986. It was the result of a competition for which many suggestions were entered. The winning design was submitted by the artist [[Astrid Båhl]] from [[Skibotn]], Norway.

The motif (shown right) was derived from the shaman's drum and the poem &quot;Paiven parneh&quot; (&quot;Sons of the Sun&quot;) by the South Sami [[Anders Fjellner]] describing the Sami as sons and daughters of the sun. The flag has the Sami colours, red, green, yellow and blue, and the circle represents the sun (red) and the moon (blue).

===The Sami People's Day===
{{Main|Sami National Day}}

The Sami National Day falls on February 6 as this date was when the first Sami congress was held in 1917 in [[Trondheim]], Norway. This congress was the first time that Norwegian and Swedish Sami came together across their national borders to work together to find solutions for common problems. The resolution for celebrating on 6 February was passed in 1992 at the 15th Sami congress in Helsinki. Since 1993, Norway, Sweden and Finland have recognized February 6 as Sami National Day.

===&quot;Song of the Sami People&quot;===
{{Main|Sámi soga lávlla}}

&quot;Sámi soga lávlla&quot; (&quot;Song of the Sami People&quot;, lit. &quot;Song of the Sami Family&quot;) was originally a poem written by [[Isak Saba]] that was published in the newspaper ''[[Sagai Muittalægje]]'' for the first time on 1 April 1906. In August 1986, it became the [[national anthem]] of the Sami. Arne Sørli set the poem to music, which was then approved at the 15th Sami Conference in [[Helsinki]] in 1992. &quot;Sámi soga lávlla&quot; has been translated into all of the [[Sami languages]].

==Religion==
{{Main|Sami religion}}
[[File:Shaman.jpg|thumb|Copper etching (1767) by O.H. von Lode showing a [[noaidi]] with his meavrresgárri [[drum]]]]

Widespread [[Shamanism]] persisted among the Sami up until the 18th century. Most Sami today belong to the state-run  [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] churches of Norway, Sweden and Finland. Some Sami in Russia belong to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], and similarly, some Skolt Sami resettled in Finland are also part of an [[Eastern Orthodox]] congregation, with an additional small population in Norway.

===Traditional Sami religion===
Traditional Sami religion, like virtually all indigenous religions around the world, was a type of [[polytheism|polytheistic]] [[paganism]]. (See [[Sami shamanism#Deities|Sami deities]].) There was some diversity due to the wide area that is [[Sápmi]], allowing for the evolution of variations in beliefs and practices between tribes. The old beliefs are closely connected to the land, [[animism]], and the [[supernatural]]. Sami spirituality is often characterized by [[pantheism]], a strong emphasis on the importance of personal spirituality and its interconnectivity with one's own daily life, and a deep connection between the natural and spiritual &quot;worlds&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to Shamanism  |last=DuBois |first=Thomas |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=June 2009, |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location= |isbn=978-0-521-69536-7 |page= |pages=| url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other roles, the Sami Shaman, or [[noaidi]], enabled ritual communication with the supernatural&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sami Shamanism from a diachronic point of view |last=Kasten |first=Erich |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1989, |publisher=Fullerton |location=Los Angeles |isbn= |page= |pages=| url=http:// www.siberian-studies.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the use of tools such as drums, chants, and sacred objects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gusto&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Sámi Drums – Then and Now |last=Gusto |first=Ken Emerson Jr. |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=, |publisher= University of Texas |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=| url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/sami/diehtu/giella/music/noaidi.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some practices within the Old Sami religion included natural sacred sites such as mountains, springs, land formations, as well as man-made ones such as [[petroglyph]]s and [[labyrinth]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sami potatoes: living with reindeer and perestroika |last=Robinson |first=Michael |authorlink= |coauthors= Karim-Aly S. Kassam|year=1998, |publisher=Bayeux Arts |location= |isbn= |page=73 |pages=| url=9781896209210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sami religion shared some elements with [[Norse mythology]], possibly from early contacts with trading Vikings (or vice versa). Through a mainly French initiative from [[Joseph Paul Gaimard]] as part of his [[La Recherche Expedition (1838–1840)|La Recherche Expedition]], [[Lars Levi Læstadius]] began research on Sami mythology. His work resulted in [[Fragments of Lappish Mythology]], since by his own admission, they contained only a small percentage of what had existed. The fragments were termed ''Theory of Gods'', ''Theory of Sacrifice'', ''Theory of Prophecy, or short reports about rumorous Sami magic'' and ''Sami sagas''. Generally, he claims to have filtered out the Norse influence and derived common elements between the South, North, and Eastern Sami groups. The mythology has common elements with other traditional indigenous religions as well — such as those in [[Siberia]] and North America.

===Missionary efforts===
The term ''Sami religion'' usually refers to the traditional religion, practiced by most Sámi until approximately the 18th century. [[Christianity]] was introduced by [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] missionaries as early as the 13th century. Increased pressure came after the [[Protestant Reformation]], and [[rune drum]]s were burned or sent to museums abroad. In this period, many Sami practiced their traditional religion at home, while going to church on Sunday. Since the Sami were considered to possess &quot;witchcraft&quot; powers, they were often accused of sorcery during the 17th century and were the subjects of witchcraft trials and burnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Witches of the high north: The Finnmark witchcraft trials in the seventeenth century |last=Willumsen |first=L.H. |authorlink= |coauthors=|year=1997, |publisher=Scandinavian journal of history |location= |isbn=0346-8755   |page= |pages=| url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway, a major effort to convert the Sami was made around 1720, when [[Thomas von Westen]], the &quot;Apostle of the Sami&quot;, burned drums and converted people. Out of the estimated thousands of drums prior to this period, only about 70 are known to remain today, scattered in museums around Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gusto&quot;/&gt; Sacred sites were destroyed, such as sieidi (stones in natural or human-built formations), álda and sáivu (sacred hills), springs, caves and other natural formations where offerings were made.

In the far east of the Sami area, the Russian monk Trifon converted the Sami in the 16th century. Today, St. George's chapel in [[Neiden, Finnmark|Neiden]], Norway (1565), testifies to this effort.

===Laestadius===
{{Main|Laestadianism}}
[[File:Rune drum Sápmi MEK.jpg|thumb|[[Noaidi]] drum]]
The Swedish Sami vicar [[Lars Levi Læstadius]] initiated a puritan Lutheran movement among the Sami around 1840. This movement is still very dominant in Sami-speaking areas.

===Neo-shamanism and traditional healing===
Today there are a number of Sami who seek to return to the traditional [[Paganism|Pagan]] values of their ancestors. There are also some Sami that claim to be ''noaidi'' and offer their services through newspaper advertisements, in [[New Age]] arrangements, or for tourist groups. While they practice a polytheistic Pagan religion as did their ancestors, widespread anti-pagan [[discrimination against Neopagans|prejudice]] has caused these shamans to be generally not viewed as part of an unbroken Sami religious tradition. They are often compared with [[neo-paganism]], as a number of neopagan religions likewise combine elements of ancient pagan religions with more recent revisions or innovations. 

A very different religious idea is represented by the numerous &quot;wise men&quot; and &quot;wise women&quot; found throughout the Sami area. They often attempt to heal the sick through rituals and traditional medicines and may also combine traditional Pagan elements, such as teachings, with newer monotheistic inventions that the oppressive Christian missionaries forced upon their Pagan ancestors, such as readings from the Bible.

==Language==
{{Main|Sami languages}}
[[File:E.W. Borg alphabet 1859.jpg|left|thumb|E.W. Borg alphabet book, published in 1859 in Finnish-[[Inari Sami language|Inari Sami]]]]
There is no single Sami language, but a group of ten distinct [[Sami languages]]. Six of these languages have their own written standards. The Sami languages are relatively closely related, but not mutually intelligible; for instance, speakers of Southern Sami cannot understand Northern Sami. Especially earlier, these distinct languages were referred to as &quot;dialects&quot;, but today, this is considered misleading due to the deep differences between the varieties. Most Sami languages are spoken in several countries, because linguistic borders do not correspond to national borders.

All Sami languages are endangered. This is due in part to historic laws prohibiting the use of Sami languages in schools and at home in Sweden and Norway. Sami languages, and Sami song-chants, called yoiks, were illegal in Norway from 1773 until 1958. Then, access to Sami instruction as part of schooling was not available until 1988. Special residential schools that would assimilate the Sami into the dominant culture were established. These were originally run by missionaries, but later, the control of the schools came under the control of the governments. For example, in Russia, Sami children were taken away when aged 1–2 and returned when aged 15–17 with no knowledge of their language and traditional communities. Not all Sami viewed the schools negatively, and not all of the schools were brutal. However, being taken from home and prohibited from speaking Sami has resulted in cultural alienation, loss of language, and lowered self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Survivance&quot; in Sami and First Nations Boarding School Narratives |last=Kuokkanen |first=Rauna |authorlink= |coauthors=  |year=(Summer/Fall) 2003 |publisher=American Indian Quarterly 27 |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=697–726| url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sami languages belong to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] language family, linguistically related to Finnish, [[Estonian language|Estonian]], and Hungarian. Due to prolonged contact and import of items foreign to Sami culture from neighboring Scandinavians, there are a number of [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] loanwords in Sami, particularly for &quot;urban&quot; objects. The majority of the Sami now speak the majority languages of the countries they live in, i.e., Swedish, Russian, Finnish and Norwegian. Efforts are being made to further the use of Sami languages among Sami and persons of Sami origin. Despite these changes, the legacy of cultural repression still exists.  Many older Sami still refuse to speak Sami.  In addition, Sami parents still feel alienated from schools and hence do not participate as much as they could in shaping school curricula and policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Norway’s Sami Language Act’: Emancipatory Implications for the World’s Aboriginal Peoples. |last=Corson |first=David |authorlink= |coauthors=  |year=1995|publisher=Language in Society 24 |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=493–513 | url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Norway, the name of the language and the people is often spelled ''Saami''; in Finland, the name of the language is spelled ''Saame'' and the name of the people ''Saamelainen''.

==Genetic studies==
{{Main|Population genetics of the Sami}}
[[File:Lapland Mother NGM-v31-p556.jpg|thumb|Sami mother with her children]]

[[Anthropologist]]s have been studying the Sami people for hundreds of years for their assumed physical and cultural differences from the rest of the Europeans. Recent [[genetics|genetic studies]] have indicated that the two most frequent [[Mitochondrial DNA|maternal lineage]]s of the Sámi people are the haplogroups [[haplogroup V (mtDNA)|V]] and [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)|U5b]], ancient in Europe.  &quot;The Y-chromosomal variety in the Saami is also consistent with their European ancestry. It suggests that the large genetic separation of the Saami from other Europeans is best explained by assuming that the Saami are descendants of a narrow, distinctive subset of Europeans.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1181943/?tool=pubmed Kristiina Tambets, Siiri Rootsi, Toomas Kivisild, Hela Help, Piia Serk et al.,  The Western and Eastern Roots of the Saami—the Story of Genetic “Outliers” Told by Mitochondrial DNA and Y Chromosomes,'' American Journal of Human Genetics'', vol. 74 (2004), pp. 661–682]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/AJHG/journal/issues/v74n4/40783/40783.web.pdf Kristiina Tambets, Siiri Rootsi, Toomas Kivisild, Hela Help, Piia Serk et al.,  The Western and Eastern Roots of the Saami—the Story of Genetic “Outliers” Told by Mitochondrial DNA and Y Chromosomes,'' American Journal of Human Genetics'', vol. 74 (2004), pp. 661–682]&lt;/ref&gt; Other haplogroups suggest additional input from other populations at various times. This tallies with archeological evidence suggesting that several different cultural groups made their way to the core area of Sami from 8000 to 6000&amp;nbsp;BC,&lt;ref&gt;Esihistorian vuosiluvut, ajoitukset ja kronologia, Carpelan, in &quot;Ennen, muinoin&quot;, SKS, Helsinki 2002&lt;/ref&gt; presumably including some of the ancestors of present-day Sami.

===History of scientific research carried out on the Sami===
The genetic makeup of Sami people has been extensively studied for as long as such research has been in existence, although until recent times, the purpose of this research has mostly been at best [[ethnocentric]], at worst racist and defamatory.
