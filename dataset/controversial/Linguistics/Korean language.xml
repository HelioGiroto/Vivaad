{{Contains Korean text}}

'''Korean''' ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:한국어|한국어]]/[[wikt:조선말|조선말]]}}, see [[#Names|below]]) is the official [[language]] of [[South Korea]] and [[North Korea]] as well as one of the two official languages in [[China]]'s [[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture]]. Approximately 78 million people speak Korean worldwide. For over a millennium, Korean was written with adapted [[Chinese characters]] called [[hanja]], complemented by phonetic systems like ''[[hyangchal]], [[gugyeol]],'' and ''[[Idu script|idu]]''. In the 15th century, a national writing system called [[hangul]] was commissioned by [[Sejong the Great]], but it only came into widespread use in the 20th century, because of the ''[[yangban]]'' aristocracy's preference for hanja.

Most historical linguists classify Korean as a [[language isolate]]&lt;ref&gt;Song, Jae Jung (2005) [http://books.google.com/books?id=rIk52cJ1vDEC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Korean+%22Language+isolate%22&amp;ei=_JVSS8LtGI6szASz-r36Cw&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Korean%20%22Language%20isolate%22&amp;f=false &quot;The Korean language: structure, use and context&quot;] Routledge, p. 15&lt;br&gt;Lyle Campbell &amp; Mauricio Mixco. 2007.

In; Sanchez-Mazas, Blench, Ross, Lin &amp; Pejros eds. Human migrations in continental East Asia and Taiwan: genetic, linguistic and archaeological evidence. 2008. Taylor &amp; Francis&lt;/ref&gt; The Korean language is [[Agglutinative language|agglutinative]] in its morphology and [[subject–object–verb|SOV]] in its [[syntax]].

==Names==
The Korean names for the language are based on the [[Names of Korea|names for Korea]] used in North and South Korea.

In South Korea, the language is most often called ''Hangungmal'' ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:한국말|한국말]]}}; {{lang|ko|韓國말}}), or more formally, ''Hangugeo'' ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:한국어|한국어]]}}; {{lang|ko|韓國語}}) or ''Gugeo'' ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:국어|국어]]}}; {{lang|ko|國語}}; literally &quot;national language&quot;).

In [[North Korea]] and [[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture]] in [[China]], the language is most often called ''Chosŏnmal'' ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:조선말|조선말]]}}; {{lang|ko|朝鮮말}}), or more formally, ''Chosŏnŏ'' ({{lang|ko|[[wikt:조선어|조선어]]}}; {{lang|ko|朝鮮語}}).

On the other hand, Korean people in the [[Post-Soviet states|former USSR]], who refer to themselves as [[Koryo-saram]] (고려사람; also ''Goryeoin'' [{{lang|ko|고려인}}; {{lang|ko|高麗人}}; literally, &quot;[[Names of Korea#Goryeo|Goryeo]] person(s)&quot;]) call the language ''[[Koryo-mar|Goryeomal]]'' ({{lang|ko|고려말}}; {{lang|ko|高麗말}}).

In [[mainland China]], following the establishment of diplomatic relations with South Korea in 1992, the term ''Cháoxiǎnyǔ'' ({{lang|zh|朝鲜语}} or the short form: ''Cháoyǔ'' ({{lang|zh|朝语}})) has normally been used to refer to the standard language of North Korea and Yanbian, while ''Hánguóyǔ'' ({{lang|zh|韩国语}} or the short form: ''Hányǔ'' ({{lang|zh|韩语}})) is used to refer to the standard language of South Korea.

Some older English sources also used the name &quot;Korean&quot; to refer to the language, country, and people. The word &quot;Korean&quot; is derived from [[Goryeo]], which is thought to be the first dynasty known to western countries.

==Classification==
While the majority of linguists consider Korean to be a language isolate,&lt;ref&gt;Song, Jae Jung (2005) [http://books.google.com/books?id=rIk52cJ1vDEC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=Korean+%22Language+isolate%22&amp;ei=_JVSS8LtGI6szASz-r36Cw&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Korean%20%22Language%20isolate%22&amp;f=false &quot;The Korean language: structure, use and context&quot;] Routledge, p. 15&lt;br&gt;Lyle Campbell &amp; Mauricio Mixco. 2007. ''A Glossary of Historical Linguistics''. University of Utah Press. (&quot;Korean, A language isolate&quot;, pg. 90; &quot;Korean is often said to belong with the Altaic hypothesis, often also with Japanese, though this is not widely supported&quot;, pp. 90-91; &quot;...most specialists...no longer believe that the...Altaic groups...are related&quot;, pg. 7)&lt;br&gt;David Dalby. 1999/2000. ''The Linguasphere Register of the World's Languages and Speech Communities''. Linguasphere Press.&lt;br&gt;Nam-Kil Kim. 1992. &quot;Korean&quot;, ''International Encyclopedia of Linguistics''. Volume 2, pp. 282-286. (&quot;...scholars have tried to establish genetic relationships between Korean and other languages and major language families, but with little success&quot;, pg. 282)&lt;br&gt;András Róna-Tas. 1998. &quot;The Reconstruction of Proto-Turkic and the Genetic Question&quot;, ''The Turkic Languages''. Routledge. Pp. 67-80. (&quot;[Ramstedt's comparisons of Korean and Altaic] have been heavily criticised in more recent studies, though the idea of a genetic relationship has not been totally abandoned&quot;, pg. 77.)&lt;br&gt;Claus Schönig. 2003. &quot;Turko-Mongolic Relations&quot;, ''The Mongolic Languages''. Routledge. Pp. 403-419. (&quot;...the 'Altaic' languages do not seem to share a common basic vocabulary of the type normally present in cases of genetic relationship&quot;, pg. 403)&lt;/ref&gt; there have been attempts to link it with other languages in the region.

Since the publication of the article of [[Gustaf John Ramstedt|Ramstedt]] in 1928, some linguists&lt;ref&gt;eg Miller 1971, 1996, Starostin et al. 2003&lt;/ref&gt; support the hypothesis that Korean can be classified as an [[Altaic languages|Altaic]] language or as a relative of proto-Altaic. Korean is similar to the Altaic languages in that they both lack certain grammatical elements, including [[Article (grammar)|articles]], fusional morphology and [[relative pronoun]]s. However, linguists agree today on the fact that typological resemblances cannot be used to prove genetic relatedness of languages&lt;ref&gt;eg Vovin 2008: 1&lt;/ref&gt; as these features are typologically connected and [[areal feature|easily borrowed]].&lt;ref&gt;Trask 1996: 147-151&lt;/ref&gt; Such factors of typological divergence as Middle Mongolian's exhibition of gender agreement&lt;ref&gt;Rybatzki 2003: 57&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to argue that a genetic relationship is unlikely.&lt;ref&gt;Vovin 2008: 5&lt;/ref&gt;

The hypothesis that Korean might be related to [[Japanese language|Japanese]] has had some supporters due to some apparent overlap in vocabulary and similar grammatical features that have been elaborated upon by such researchers as [[Samuel Martin (linguist)|Samuel E. Martin]]&lt;ref&gt;eg Martin 1966, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roy Andrew Miller]].&lt;ref&gt;eg Miller 1971, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sergei Starostin]] (1991) found about 25% of potential [[cognate]]s in the Japanese–Korean 100-word [[Swadesh list]], which—if valid—would place these two languages closer together than other possible members of the Altaic family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Altaiskaya problema i proishozhdeniye yaponskogo yazika (The Altaic Problem and the Origins of the Japanese Language)|url=http://www.alib.ru/findp.php4?author=%D1%F2%E0%F0%EE%F1%F2%E8%ED&amp;title=%C0%EB%F2%E0%E9%F1%EA%E0%FF+%EF%F0%EE%E1%EB%E5%EC%E0+%E8+%EF%F0%EE%E8%F1%F5%EE%E6%E4%E5%ED%E8%E5+%FF%EF%EE%ED%F1%EA%EE%E3%EE+%FF%E7%FB%EA%E0+|author=Sergei Starostin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Korea, [[Korean ethnic nationalism]] and [[Anti-Japanese sentiment in Korea|anti-Japanese sentiment]] has led to widespread dismissal of the idea of Japanese-Korean linguistic connection. A popular myth among Koreans that they are descended from &quot;horse-riding peoples of Central Asia such as the Mongols&quot; has led Korean scholars to continue propagating the Altaic hypothesis that has since been discredited in the West.&lt;ref name=Lee&amp;Ramsey/&gt;{{rp|5}}

Other linguists, most notably [[Alexander Vovin]], argue that the similarities are not due to any genetic relationship, but rather to a ''[[sprachbund]]'' effect and heavy borrowing especially from ancient Korean into Western Old Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;Vovin 2008&lt;/ref&gt; A good example might be Middle Korean ''sàm'' and Japanese ''asa'' ‘hemp’.&lt;ref&gt;Whitman 1985: 232, also found in Martin 1966: 233&lt;/ref&gt; This word seems to be cognate, but while it is well-attested in Western Old Japanese and Northern Ryūkyū, in Eastern Old Japanese it only occurs in compounds, and it is only present in three subdialects of the South-Ryūkyūan dialect group. Then, the doublet ''wo'' ‘hemp’ is attested in Western Old Japanese and Southern Ryūkyū. It is thus plausible to assume a borrowed term.&lt;ref&gt;Vovin 2008: 211-212&lt;/ref&gt; See [[East Asian languages#Morphology|East Asian languages]] for morphological features shared among languages of the East Asian ''sprachbund'', and [[Classification of Japonic]] for further details on the discussion of a possible relationship.

Among ancient languages, various closer relatives of Korean have been proposed, constituting a possible small [[Koreanic languages|Koreanic]] language family.

==History==
{{Main|History of the Korean language}}

Korean is descended from [[Proto-Korean]], [[Old Korean]], [[Middle Korean]] and [[Modern Korean]]. Since the [[Korean War]], contemporary [[Korean language North-South differences|North–South differences]] have developed in standard Korean, including variance in pronunciation, verb inflection, and vocabulary.

==Geographic distribution==
{{see also|Korean diaspora}}

Korean is spoken by the [[Koreans|Korean people]] in [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]] and by the [[Korean diaspora]] in many countries including the [[China|People's Republic of China]], [[Japan]], and the [[United States]]. Korean-speaking minorities exist in these states, but because of [[cultural assimilation]] into host countries, not all ethnic Koreans may speak it with native fluency.

===Official status===

Korean is the official language of [[South Korea]] and [[North Korea]]. It is also one of the two official languages of the [[Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture]] in China.

In South Korea, the regulatory body for Korean is the [[Seoul]]-based [[The National Institute of the Korean Language|National Institute of the Korean Language]] ({{lang|ko|국립국어원}}; 國立國語院), which was created by presidential decree on January 23, 1991. In North Korea, the regulatory body is the Language Institute of the Academy of Social Sciences ({{lang|ko|사회과학원 어학연구소}}; 社會科學院語學研究所, ''Sahoe Kwahagwon Ŏhak Yŏnguso'').

==Dialects==
{{Main|Korean dialects}}
[[Image:Koreandialects.png|thumb|300px|Dialects of Korean]]
Korean has numerous small local [[dialect]]s (called ''mal'' ({{lang|ko|말}}) [literally &quot;speech&quot;], ''saturi'' ({{lang|ko|사투리}}), or ''bangeon'' ({{lang|ko|방언}}) in Korean). The [[standard language]] (''pyojuneo'' or ''pyojunmal'') of both South Korea and North Korea is based on the dialect of the area around [[Seoul]], though the northern standard has been influenced by the dialect of [[Pyongyang|P'yŏngyang]]. All dialects of Korean are similar to each other and at least partially [[mutually intelligible]], though the [[Jeju dialect|dialect of Jeju Island]] is divergent enough to be sometimes classified as a separate language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/new_interactive_atlas_adds_two_more_endangered_languages/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Lightfoot, 1999. ''The development of language: acquisition, change, and evolution''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Juha Janhunen|Janhunen, Juha]], 1996. ''Manchuria: an ethnic history''&lt;/ref&gt; One of the more salient differences between dialects is the use of tone: speakers of [[Seoul dialect]] make use of vowel length, whereas speakers of the [[Gyeongsang dialect]] maintain the [[pitch accent]] of Middle Korean. Some dialects are conservative, maintaining Middle Korean sounds (such as ''z, β, ə'') which have been lost from the standard language, whereas others are highly innovative. 

There is substantial evidence for a history of extensive [[dialect levelling]], or even [[convergent evolution]] or intermixture of two or more originally distinct linguistic stocks, within the Korean language and its dialects. Many Korean dialects have basic vocabulary that is etymologically distinct from vocabulary of identical meaning in Standard Korean or other dialects, such as South Jeolla dialect /kur/ vs. Standard Korean [[wikt:입|입]] {{IPA|/ip/}} &quot;mouth&quot; or Gyeongsang dialect {{IPA|/t͡ɕʌŋ.ɡu.d͡ʑi/}} vs. Standard Korean {{IPA|/puːt͡ɕʰu/}} &quot;[[garlic chives]]&quot;. This suggests that the Korean Peninsula may have at one time been much more linguistically diverse than it is at present. See also the [[Buyeo languages]] [[hypothesis]].

There are few clear boundaries between Korean dialects, and they are typically partially grouped according to the [[regions of Korea]].

Its official use in the [[Extensions to the IPA]] is for [[Fortis and lenis|'strong']] articulation, but is used in the literature for [[faucalized voice]]. The Korean consonants also have elements of [[stiff voice]], but it is not yet known how typical this is of faucalized consonants. They are produced with a partially constricted [[glottis]] and additional subglottal pressure in addition to tense vocal tract walls, laryngeal lowering, or other expansion of the larynx.

{{note|ㅏ|*}} ㅏ is closer to a [[Near-open central vowel]] ({{IPA|[ɐ]}}), though ⟨a⟩ is still used for tradition.

===Allophones===
{{IPA|/s/}} becomes an [[alveolo-palatal consonant|alveolo-palatal]] {{IPA|[ɕ]}} before {{IPA|[j]}} or {{IPA|[i]}} for most speakers (but see [[North–South differences in the Korean language]]). This occurs with the tense fricative and all the affricates as well. At the end of a syllable, /s/ changes to /t/ (Example: beoseot (버섯) 'mushroom').&lt;!-- it's actually much more complicated than this, isn't it?--&gt;

{{IPA|/h/}} may become a [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]] {{IPA|[ɸ]}} before {{IPA|[o]}} or {{IPA|[u]}}, a [[palatal consonant|palatal]] {{IPA|[ç]}} before {{IPA|[j]}} or {{IPA|[i]}}, a [[velar consonant|velar]] {{IPA|[x]}} before {{IPA|[ɯ]}}, a voiced {{IPA|[ɦ]}} between voiced sounds, and a {{IPA|[h]}} elsewhere.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

{{IPA|/p, t, t͡ɕ, k/}} become voiced {{IPA|[b, d, d͡ʑ, ɡ]}} between voiced sounds.

{{IPA|/l/}} becomes alveolar flap {{IPA|[ɾ]}} between vowels, and {{IPA|[l]}} or {{IPA|[ɭ]}} at the end of a syllable or next to another {{IPA|/l/}}. Note that a written syllable-final 'ㄹ', when followed by a vowel or a glide (''i.e.'', when the next character starts with 'ㅇ'), migrates to the next syllable and thus becomes {{IPA|[ɾ]}}.

Traditionally, {{IPA|/l/}} was disallowed at the beginning of a word. It disappeared before {{IPA|[j]}}, and otherwise became {{IPA|/n/}}. However, the inflow of western [[Konglish|loanword]]s changed the trend, and now word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} (mostly from English loanwords) are pronounced as a free variation of either {{IPA|[ɾ]}} or {{IPA|[l]}}. The traditional prohibition of word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} became a morphological rule called &quot;initial law&quot; (두음법칙) in South Korea, which pertains to Sino-Korean vocabulary. Such words retain their word-initial {{IPA|/l/}} in North Korea.

All [[obstruent]]s (plosives, affricates, fricatives) have [[no audible release]], {{IPA|[p̚, t̚, k̚]}}, at the end of a word. 

Plosive stops {{IPA|/p, t, k/}} become nasal stops {{IPA|[m, n, ŋ]}} before nasal stops. 

[[Hangul]] spelling does not reflect these assimilatory pronunciation rules, but rather maintains the underlying, partly historical [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]]. Given this, it is sometimes hard to tell which actual phonemes are present in a certain word.

One difference between the pronunciation standards of North and South Korea is the treatment of initial {{IPA|[r]}}, and initial {{IPA|[n]}}. For example,
* &quot;labor&quot; – north: '''''r'''odong'' (로동), south: '''''n'''odong'' (노동)
* &quot;history&quot; – north: '''''ry'''ŏksa'' (력사), south: '''''y'''eoksa'' (역사)
* &quot;female&quot; – north: '''''ny'''ŏja'' (녀자), south: '''''y'''eoja'' (여자)

===Morphophonemics===
{{Main|Morphophonology}}
Grammatical morphemes may change shape depending on the preceding sounds. Examples include ''-eun/-neun'' (-은/-는) and ''-i/-ga'' (-이/-가). Sometimes sounds may be inserted instead. Examples include ''-eul/-reul'' (-을/-를), ''-euro/-ro'' (-으로/-로), ''-eseo/-seo'' (-에서/-서), ''-ideunji/-deunji'' (-이든지/-든지) and ''-iya/-ya'' (-이야/-야). However, ''-euro/-ro'' is somewhat irregular, since it will behave differently after a rieul consonant.

Some verbs may also change shape morphophonemically.

==Grammar==
{{Main|Korean grammar}}

Korean is an [[agglutinative language]]. The Korean language is traditionally considered to have nine parts of speech. For details, see [[Korean parts of speech]]. Modifiers generally precede the modified words, and in the case of verb modifiers, can be serially appended. The basic form of a Korean sentence is [[subject–object–verb]], but the verb is the only required and immovable element. 

{|
|'''A''':||&amp;nbsp;||가게에|| &amp;nbsp; ||갔어요?
|-
| || ||''gage-e''|| ||''ga-ss-eo-yo''
|-
| || ||store + [location marker (에)]|| ||[go (verb root) (가)]+[past (ㅆ)]+[conjunctive (어)]+ [polite marker (요)]
|}
:&quot;Did [you] go to the store?&quot; (&quot;you&quot; implied in conversation)

{|
|'''B''': ||&amp;nbsp;||예. (or 네.)
|-
| || ||''ye'' (or ''ne'')
|-
| || ||yes
|}
:&quot;Yes.&quot;

==Speech levels and honorifics==
{{Main|Korean honorifics}}

The relationship between a speaker or writer and his or her subject and audience is paramount in Korean, and the grammar reflects this. The relationship between speaker/writer and subject referent is reflected in ''[[honorific]]s'', while that between speaker/writer and audience is reflected in ''speech level''.

===Honorifics===
When talking about someone superior in status, a speaker or writer usually uses special nouns or verb endings to indicate the subject's superiority. Generally, someone is superior in status if he/she is an older relative, a stranger of roughly equal or greater age, or an employer, teacher, customer, or the like. Someone is equal or inferior in status if he/she is a younger stranger, student, employee or the like. Nowadays, there are special endings which can be used on declarative, interrogative, and imperative sentences; and both honorific or normal sentences. They are made for easier and faster use of Korean.

Honorifics in traditional Korea were strictly hierarchical. The caste and estate systems possessed patterns and usages much more complex and stratified than those we have now. The intricate structure of the Korean honorific system flourished in traditional culture and society. Honorifics in contemporary Korea are now used for people who are psychologically distant. Honorifics are also used for people who are superior in status. For example, older relatives, people who are older, teachers, and employers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sohn 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Sohn | first = Ho-Min | title = Korean Language in Culture and Society | publisher = Twayne Publishers | location = Boston | year = 2006 | isbn = 978-0-8248-2694-9 |ref = harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speech levels===
There are seven verb [[paradigm]]s or ''speech levels'' in Korean, and each level has its own unique set of verb endings which are used to indicate the level of formality of a situation.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} Unlike [[honorifics]]—which are used to show respect towards the referent (whom you are talking about) —''speech levels'' are used to show respect towards a speaker's or writer's audience (whom you are talking to). The names of the seven levels are derived from the non-honorific [[Imperative mood|imperative]] form of the verb [[wikt:하다|하다]] (''hada'', &quot;do&quot;) in each level, plus the suffix 체 (&quot;che&quot;, [[hanja]]: &lt;span lang=&quot;KO&quot;&gt;體&lt;/span&gt;), which means &quot;style&quot;.

The highest six levels are generally grouped together as ''jondaenmal'' (존댓말), while the lowest level (''haeche'', 해체) is called ''banmal'' (반말) in Korean.

Nowadays, younger-generation speakers no longer feel obligated to lower their usual regard toward the referent. It is common to see younger people talk to their older relatives with banmal (반말). This is not out of disrespect, but instead it shows the intimacy and the closeness of the relationship between the two speakers. Transformations in social structures and attitudes in today's rapidly changing society have brought about change in the way people speak.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sohn 2006&quot; /&gt;

===Gender and Korean language===
In traditional society, Korean women often place themselves in a position of powerlessness, and this in turn is observed in their everyday speech patterns. Some examples of this can be seen in: (1) a woman’s use of softer tone in order to minimize conflict or aggression; (2) a married woman introducing herself as someone’s mother or wife, not with her own name; (3) the presence of gender differences in titles and occupational terms (for example, a ''sajang'' is a company president and ''yŏsajang'' is a female company president.); (4) and females sometimes using more tag questions and rising tones in statements, much like the way that young children talk.&lt;ref&gt;Cho, Young A. “ Gender Differences in Korean Speech.” Korean Language in Culture and Society. Ed. Ho-min Sohn. University of Hawaii Press, 2006. Pages 189&amp;ndash;198.&lt;/ref&gt;

In western societies, individuals will avoid expressions of power asymmetry, mutually addressing each other by their first names for the sake of solidarity. Between two people of asymmetrical status in a Korean society, people tend to emphasize differences in status for the sake of solidarity. Koreans prefer to use kinship terms rather than any other terms of reference.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Minju. “Cross Adoption of language between different genders: The case of the Korean kinship terms hyeng and enni.” Proceedings of the Fifth Berkley Woman and Language Conference. Berkeley: Berkeley Women and Language Group. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In traditional Korean society, women have long been in disadvantaged positions. Korean social structure traditionally consisted of a royal monarch, a patriarchically dominated family system that emphasizes the maintenance of family lines. This structure has tended to separate roles of women from those of men.&lt;ref&gt;Palley, Marian Lief. “Women’s Status in South Korea: Tradition and Change.” Asian Survey, Vol 30 No. 12. December 1990. Pages 1136&amp;ndash;1153.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==
The core of the Korean vocabulary is made up of native Korean words. A significant proportion of the vocabulary, especially words that denote abstract ideas, are [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean words]],&lt;ref name=Sohn&gt;Sohn, Ho-Min. ''The Korean Language'' (Section 1.5.3 &quot;Korean vocabulary&quot;, p.12–13), Cambridge University Press, 2001. ISBN 0-521-36943-6.&lt;/ref&gt; either
* directly borrowed from [[written Chinese]], or
* coined in Korea or Japan using [[Chinese characters]],
in a similar way European languages borrow from Latin and Greek.

The exact proportion of Sino-Korean vocabulary is a matter of debate. Sohn (2001) stated 50&amp;ndash;60%.&lt;ref name=Sohn /&gt; Later, the same author (2006, p.&amp;nbsp;5) gives an even higher estimate of 65%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sohn 2006&quot; /&gt; Jeong Jae-do, one of the compilers of the dictionary ''Urimal Keun Sajeon'', asserts that the proportion is not so high. He points out that Korean dictionaries compiled during the [[Korea under Japanese rule|colonial period]] include many unused Sino-Korean words. In his estimation, the proportion of native Korean vocabulary in the Korean language might be as high as 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|periodical=The Hankyoreh|url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/culture/religion/376204.html|date=2009-09-11|accessdate=2009-09-11|title=우리말 70%가 한자말? 일제가 왜곡한 거라네/Our language is 70% hanja? Japanese Empire distortion|last=Kim|first=Jin-su|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}. The dictionary mentioned is {{Cite journal|publisher=Hangeul Hakhoe|oclc=27072560|title=우리말　큰 사전|year=1992|publication-place=Seoul|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Korean has two [[Korean numerals|numeral systems]]: one native, and one borrowed from Sino-Korean.

To a much lesser extent, some words have also been borrowed from [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and other languages. Conversely, the Korean language itself has also contributed some loanwords to other languages, most notably the [[Japanese dialects#Tsushima-ben|Tsushima dialect]] of Japanese.

The vast majority of loanwords other than Sino-Korean come from modern times, 90% of which are from [[English language|English]].&lt;ref name=Sohn /&gt; Many words have also been borrowed from [[European languages|Western languages]] such as [[German language|German]] via [[Japanese language|Japanese]] (''[[wikt:アルバイト|areubaiteu]]'' &quot;part-time job&quot;, ''allereugi'' &quot;allergy&quot;, ''gibseu'' or ''gibuseu'' &quot;plaster cast used for broken bones&quot;). Some Western words were borrowed indirectly via Japanese, taking a Japanese sound pattern, for example &quot;dozen&quot;&amp;nbsp;&gt; {{lang|ja-Kana|ダース}} ''dāsu''&amp;nbsp;&gt; {{lang|ko-Hang|다스}} ''daseu''. Most indirect Western borrowings are now written according to current hangulization rules for the respective Western language, as if borrowed directly. There are a few more complicated borrowings such as &quot;German(y)&quot; (see [[Names of Germany#Korean|names of Germany]]), the first part of whose [[Exonym and endonym|endonym]] {{IPA|[ˈd̥ɔɪ̯t͡ʃʷ.la̠ntʰ]}} the Japanese approximated using the [[kanji]] {{lang|ja-Hant|獨逸}} &lt;!-- kyūjitai, no 独 please --&gt; ''doitsu'' that were then accepted into the Korean language by their Sino-Korean pronunciation: {{lang|ko-Hant|[[wikt:獨|獨]]}}&amp;nbsp;''dok'' + {{lang|ja-Hant|[[wikt:逸|逸]]}}&amp;nbsp;''il'' = ''[[wikt:독일|Dogil]]''. In South Korean official use, a number of other Sino-Korean country names have been replaced with phonetically oriented hangulizations of the countries' endonyms of English names.

Because of such a prevalence of English in modern Korean culture and society, [[lexical borrowing]] is inevitable. English-derived Korean, or '[[Konglish]]' (콩글리쉬), is increasingly used. The vocabulary of the Korean language is roughly 5% loanwords (excluding Sino-Korean vocabulary).&lt;ref name=&quot;Sohn 2006&quot; /&gt;

As in Japanese, Korean uses words adapted from English in ways that may seem strange to native English speakers. For example, in soccer ''heading'' ({{lang|ko|헤딩}}) is used as a noun meaning a 'header', while ''fighting'' ({{lang|ko|화이팅}}) is a term of encouragement like 'come on'/'go (on)' in English. Something that is 'service' ({{lang|ko|서비스}}) is free or 'on the house'. A building referred to as an 'apart' ({{lang|ko|아파트}}) is an 'apartment' and a type of pencil that is called 'sharp' ({{lang|ko|샤프}}) is a mechanical pencil.

North Korean vocabulary shows a tendency to prefer native Korean over Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings, especially with recent political objectives aimed at eliminating foreign influences on the Korean language in the North. In the early years, the North Korean government tried to eliminate Sino-Korean words. Consequently, South Korean may have several Sino-Korean or foreign borrowings which are not in North Korean.

==Writing system==
{{Korean writing}}
{{Main|Hangul|Korean Braille}}
{{See also|Hangul consonant and vowel tables}}
Formerly, the languages of the Korean peninsula were written using hanja, called ''[[hyangchal]]'' or ''[[idu script|idu]]'': the use of Chinese characters either as [[rebus]]es to stand for Korean words, or as synonyms for those words. Writing was confined to the ruling elite, who most often wrote only in Classical Chinese.

[[Sejong the Great]] promulgated the Korean alphabet in 1446. Korean is now written almost exclusively in hangul. While South Korean schools still teach 1,800 hanja, North Korea abolished hanja decades ago.

Modern Korean is written with spaces between [[word]]s, a feature not found in Chinese or Japanese. Korean [[punctuation]] marks are almost identical to Western ones. Traditionally, Korean was written in columns, from top to bottom, right to left, but is now usually written in rows, from left to right, top to bottom.

==Differences between North Korean and South Korean==
{{Main|North–South differences in the Korean language}}
The Korean language used in the North and the South exhibits differences in pronunciation, spelling, grammar and vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;Kanno, Hiroomi (ed.) / Society for Korean Linguistics in Japan (1987). ''Chōsengo o manabō'' (『朝鮮語を学ぼう』), Sanshūsha, Tokyo. ISBN 4-384-01506-2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pronunciation===
In North Korea, [[palatalization]] of {{IPA|/si/}} is optional, and {{IPA|/t͡ɕ/}} can be pronounced {{IPA|[z]}} between vowels.

Words that are written the same way may be pronounced differently, such as the examples below. The pronunciations below are given in [[Revised Romanization of Korean|Revised Romanization]], [[McCune–Reischauer]] and hangul, the last of which represents what the hangul would be if one were to write the word as pronounced.

| 동무 was originally a non-ideological word for &quot;friend&quot; used all over the Korean peninsula, but North Koreans later adopted it as the equivalent of the Communist term of address &quot;[[comrade]]&quot;. As a result, to South Koreans today the word has a heavy political tinge, and so they have shifted to using other words for friend like &quot;친구&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/30/world/asia/30iht-dialect.2644361.html|first=Sang-hun|last=Choe|authorlink=Choe Sang-hun|title=Koreas: Divided by a common language|date=2006-08-30|accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://koreajoongangdaily.joinsmsn.com/news/article/article.aspx?aid=2881801|title=Beliefs that bind|work=Korea JoongAng Daily|date=2007-10-23|accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study by non-native learners==
The [[United States]]' [[Defense Language Institute]] places Korean in Category IV, which also includes [[Arabic]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. This means that 63 weeks of instruction (as compared to just 25 weeks for [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], and [[Italian language|Italian]]) are required to bring an English-speaking student to a limited working level of proficiency in which he or she has &quot;sufficient capability to meet routine social demands and limited job requirements&quot; and &quot;can deal with concrete topics in past, present, and future tense.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Applied Language Learning|volume=16|issue=2|url=http://www.dliflc.edu/academics/academic_materials/all/ALLissues/all16two.pdf|last=Raugh|first=Harold E.|title=The Origins of the Transformation of the Defense Language Program|pages=1–12|accessdate=2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study of the Korean language in the United States is dominated by [[Korean American]] [[heritage language learning|heritage language students]]; they are estimated to form over 80% of all students of the language at non-military universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Issues of Validity of SAT Subject Test Korea with Listening|last=Lee|first=Saekyun H.|coauthors=HyunJoo Han|pages=33–56|journal=Applied Language Learning|volume=17|issue=1|url=http://www.dliflc.edu/academics/academic_materials/all/ALLissues/ALL17.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080625112846/http://www.dliflc.edu/academics/academic_materials/all/ALLissues/ALL17.pdf|archivedate=2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Sejong Institute]]s in the United States have noted a sharp rise in the number of people of other ethnic backgrounds studying Korean between 2009 and 2011; they attribute this to [[Korean wave|rising popularity of South Korean music and television shows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://view.koreaherald.com/kh/view.php?ud=20120722000212|title=Global popularity of Korean language surges|work=Korea Herald|date=2012-07-22|accessdate=2012-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Korean is considerably easier for speakers of certain other languages, such as Japanese&lt;!--, Mongolian, and Turkic languages are not mentioned in the source, find sources if you want to add this! --&gt;; in Japan, it is more widely studied by non-heritage learners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Language Education Policy in Japan|last=Fujita-Round|first=Sachiyo|coauthors=John C.
