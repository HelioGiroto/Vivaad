'''Ebonics''' (a [[blend]] of the words ''[[ebony]]'' and ''phonics'') is a term that was originally intended to refer to the language of all people descended from enslaved [[Black people|Black]] [[African people|Africans]], particularly in [[West Africa]], the [[Caribbean]], and [[North America]]. Since the 1996 [[Oakland Ebonics controversy|controversy over its use by the Oakland School Board]], the term ''Ebonics'' has primarily been used to refer to [[African American Vernacular English]] (AAVE), a dialect distinctively different from Standard [[American English]].

==Original usage==
The word ''Ebonics''  was originally coined in 1973 by African American social psychologist [[Robert Williams (psychologist)|Robert Williams]]&lt;ref&gt;For Williams's background as a writer on issues related to [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]], see {{Harvcoltxt|Baugh|2000|p=16}}. {{Harvcoltxt|Baugh|2000}} also flatly states (p, 18) that &quot;Williams is not a linguist.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; in a discussion with linguist Ernie Smith (as well as other language scholars and researchers) that took place in a conference on &quot;Cognitive and Language Development of the Black Child&quot;, held in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Williams|1997}}; quoted in {{Harvcoltxt|Baugh|2000|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For conference details, see {{Harvcoltxt|Baugh|2000|p=15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  His intention was to give a name to the language of African Americans that acknowledged the linguistic consequence of the slave trade and avoided the negative connotations of other terms like &quot;Nonstandard Negro English&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation
|last=Rickford|first=John R.|title=What is Ebonics (African American Vernacular English)?|publisher=Linguistic Society of America.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;We need to define what we speak. We need to give a clear definition to our language...We know that ebony means black and that phonics refers to speech sounds or the science of sounds. Thus, we are really talking about the science of black speech sounds or language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Williams|1997|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1975, the term appeared in ''[[Ebonics: The True Language of Black Folks]], '' a book edited and cowritten by Williams:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A two-year-old term created by a group of black scholars, Ebonics may be defined as &quot;the linguistic and paralinguistic features which on a concentric continuum represent the communicative competence of the West African, Caribbean, and United States slave descendant of African origin. It includes the various idioms, patois, argots, idiolects, and social dialects of black people&quot; especially those who have adapted to colonial circumstances. Ebonics derives its form from ebony (black) and phonics (sound, the study of sound) and refers to the study of the language of black people in all its cultural uniqueness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Williams|1975|p=vi}}, quoted in {{Harvcoltxt|Green|2002|p=7}}, and {{Harvcoltxt|Baugh|2000|p=15}}. Unfortunately there is something amiss with each reproduction of what Williams writes, and also possible incompatibility between the two. Green has a couple of what appear to be minor typing errors (whether Williams's or her own, and anyway corrected above following Baugh) but otherwise presents the text as above: an unexplained quotation (&quot;the linguistic and paralinguistic features...black people&quot;) within the larger quotation. Baugh does not present the material outside this inner quotation but instead presents the latter (not demarcated by quotation marks) within a different context. He describes this as part of a statement to the US Senate made at some unspecified time after 1993, yet also attributes it (or has Williams attribute part of it) to p.vi of Williams's book.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other writers have since emphasized how the term represents a view of the language of Black people as African rather than European.&lt;ref&gt;For example, {{Harvcoltxt|Smith|1998|pp=55–7}}; quoted in {{Harvcoltxt|Green|2002|pp=7–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was not obviously popular even among those who agreed with the reason for coining it. Even within Williams's book, the term ''Black English'' is far more commonly used than the term ''Ebonics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Baugh|2000|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Baugh has stated&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Baugh|2000|pp=74–5}}; he puts the four in a different order.&lt;/ref&gt; that the term ''Ebonics'' is used in four ways by its [[Afrocentrism|Afrocentric]] proponents. It may:
:1. be &quot;an international construct, including the linguistic consequences of the African slave trade&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Williams|1975}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Williams|1997}}, as summarized in Baugh's words.&lt;/ref&gt;
:2. refer to the languages of the [[African diaspora]] as a whole;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Blackshire-Belay|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
or it may refer to what is normally regarded as a variety of [[English language|English]]: either
:3. it &quot;is the equivalent of black English and is considered to be a dialect of English&quot; (and thus merely an alternative term for [[African American Vernacular English|AAVE]]), or
:4. it &quot;is the antonym of black English and is considered to be a language other than English&quot; (and thus a rejection of the notion of &quot;African American Vernacular ''English''&quot; but nevertheless a term for what others term AAVE, viewed as an independent language and not a mere [[ethnolect]]).&lt;ref&gt;The equivalent, {{Harvcoltxt|Tolliver-Weddington|1979}}; the antonym, {{Harvcoltxt|Smith|1992}} and {{Harvcoltxt|Smith|1998}}; both as summarized in Baugh's words.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common usage and controversy==
{{See|African American Vernacular English|Oakland Ebonics controversy}}
&lt;!-- Please do not add material that either duplicates or can usefully be added to what is in either (i) the article on &quot;African American Vernacular English&quot; (the main article on the distinctive Black dialect of U.S. English.) or (ii) that on &quot;Oakland Ebonics controversy&quot; (that on the row over &quot;Ebonics&quot; at school). --&gt;
''Ebonics'' remained a little-known term until 1996. It does not appear in the 1989 second edition of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]],'' nor was it adopted by [[Linguistics|linguists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Baugh|2000|p=12}}, citing {{Harvcoltxt|O'Neil|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term became widely known in the U.S. due to a controversy over a decision by the [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] [[Board of education|School Board]] to denote and recognize the primary language (or [[sociolect]] or [[ethnolect]]) of [[African American]] children attending school, and to thereby facilitate the teaching of [[standard English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Green|2002|p=222}}.  The use of the pedagogic approach called [[phonics]], particularly in the context of reading, may have helped mislead people into thinking that the ''phonics'' from which the term ''Ebonics'' is partially derived has this meaning.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ronkin|Karn|1999}} argue that the board's objective was to build on the language skills that African-American students bring to the classroom without devaluing students and their diversity.&lt;/ref&gt; Thereafter, the term ''Ebonics'' became popularized, though as little more than a synonym for [[African American Vernacular English]], perhaps differing in the emphasis on its claimed African roots and independence from English. The term is linked with the [[Oakland Ebonics controversy|nationally discussed controversy]] over the decision by the Oakland School Board, which adopted a resolution to teach children &quot;standard American English&quot; through a specific program of respect for students' home language and tutoring in the &quot;code switching&quot; required to use both standard English and Ebonics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perry |first=T. |year=1998 |title=The Real Ebonics Debate |location=New York |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn=0-8070-3145-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the term is avoided by most linguists,&lt;ref&gt;For linguists' reasons for this avoidance, see for example {{Harvcoltxt|Green|2000|pp=7–8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; it is used elsewhere (such as on Internet message boards), often for ridiculing [[African American Vernacular English|AAVE]], particularly when this is inaccurately parodied as differing more from Standard American English than it really does.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Ronkin|Karn|1999|p=361}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black American linguist John McWhorter argues that the use of the term does more to hinder black academic achievement than to help it, in that considering AAVE to be a completely different language from English serves only to widen the perceived divide between whites and blacks in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|McWhorter|2000|p=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full|date=June 2011}}
