The '''hippie''' [[subculture]] was originally a [[youth movement]] that arose in the [[United States]] during the mid-1960s and spread to other countries around the world. The [[Hippie (etymology)|etymology of the term 'hippie']] is from ''[[hipster (1940s subculture)|hipster]]'', and was initially used to describe [[beatnik]]s who had moved into San Francisco's [[Haight-Ashbury]] district. Both the words &quot;hip&quot; and &quot;hep&quot; came from [[African American culture]] and denote &quot;awareness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;To say &quot;I'm hip to the situation&quot; means &quot;I am aware of the situation. See: {{Citation| last = Sheidlower| first = Jesse | author-link = Jesse Sheidlower| date = 2004-12-08| title = Crying Wolof: Does the word hip really hail from a West African language?| publisher = ''[[Slate Magazine]]''| url = http://www.slate.com/id/2110811/ | accessdate = 2007-05-07}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The early hippies inherited the [[counterculture of the 1960s|countercultural values]] of the [[Beat Generation]], created their own communities, listened to [[psychedelic rock]], embraced the [[sexual revolution]], and some used drugs such as [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], and [[Psilocybin mushroom|magic mushrooms]] to explore [[Altered state of consciousness|altered states of consciousness]].

In January 1967, the [[Human Be-In]] in [[Golden Gate Park]] in San Francisco popularized hippie culture, leading to the legendary [[Summer of Love]] on the [[West Coast of the United States]], and the 1969 [[Woodstock Festival]] on the East Coast. Hippies in Mexico, known as ''jipitecas'', formed ''[[La Onda]]'' and gathered at [[Festival Rock y Ruedas de Avándaro|Avándaro]], while in New Zealand, nomadic [[housetrucker]]s practiced alternative lifestyles and promoted sustainable energy at [[Nambassa]]. In the United Kingdom, mobile &quot;peace convoys&quot; of [[New age travellers]] made summer [[pilgrimage]]s to free music festivals at [[Stonehenge]]. In Australia hippies gathered at [[Nimbin, New South Wales|Nimbin]] for the 1973 [[Aquarius Festival]] and the annual Cannabis Law Reform Rally or [[MardiGrass]]. &quot;[[Piedra Roja|''Piedra Roja'' Festival]]&quot;, a major hippie event in Chile, was held in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Purcell|first=Fernando|title=Ampliando miradas: Chile y su historia en un tiempo global|year=2009|publisher=RIL Editores|isbn=956-284-701-2|coauthors=Alfredo Riquelme|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hippie fashions and values had a major effect on culture, influencing [[popular music]], television, film, literature, and the arts. Since the 1960s, many aspects of hippie culture have been assimilated by mainstream society. The religious and [[cultural diversity]] espoused by the hippies has gained widespread acceptance, and [[Eastern philosophy]] and spiritual concepts have reached a larger audience. The hippie legacy can be observed in contemporary culture in myriad forms, including [[health food]], [[music festival]]s, [[sexual revolution|contemporary sexual mores]], and even the [[cyberspace]] revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brand_Time&quot;/&gt;

==Etymology==
{{main|Hippie (etymology)}}

[[Lexicography|Lexicographer]] [[Jesse Sheidlower]], the principal American editor of the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', argues that the terms ''hipster'' and ''hippie'' derive from the word ''[[hip (slang)|hip]]'', whose origins are unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Although the word ''hippies'' made isolated appearances during the late 1950s and early 1960s, the first clearly contemporary use of the term appeared in print on September 5, 1965, in the article, &quot;A New Haven for [[Beatniks]]&quot;, by San Francisco journalist Michael Fallon. In that article, Fallon wrote about the Blue Unicorn [[coffeehouse]], using the term ''hippie'' to refer to the new generation of beatniks who had moved from [[North Beach, San Francisco|North Beach]] into the [[Haight-Ashbury, San Francisco, California|Haight-Ashbury]] district.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Talk:Hippie#Herb_Caen]] for discussion - Use of the term &quot;hippie&quot; did not become widespread in the [[mass media]] until early 1967, after ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' [[columnist]] [[Herb Caen]] began to use the term; See &quot;Take a Hippie to Lunch Today&quot;, S.F. Chronicle, 20 Jan 1967, p. 37. San Francisco Chronicle, 18 Jan 1967 column, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New York Times]]'' editor and usage writer [[Theodore M. Bernstein]] said the paper changed the spelling from ''hippy'' to ''hippie'' to avoid the ambiguous description of clothing as ''hippy fashions''.{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}

==History==
{{main|History of the hippie movement}}

===Origins===
A July 1967 ''[[Time Magazine]]'' study on hippie philosophy credited the foundation of the hippie movement with historical precedent as far back as the counterculture of the [[Greece|Ancient Greeks]], espoused by philosophers like [[Diogenes of Sinope]] and the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]]s also as early forms of hippie culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time_1968&quot;&gt;{{Citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It also named as notable influences the religious and spiritual teachings of [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Hillel the Elder]], [[Jesus]], [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], [[St. Francis of Assisi]], [[Gandhi]], and [[J.R.R. Tolkien]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Time_1968&quot; /&gt;

The first signs of modern &quot;proto-hippies&quot; emerged in [[fin de siècle]] [[Europe]]. Between 1896 and 1908, a German youth movement arose as a countercultural reaction to the organized social and cultural clubs that centered around German folk music. Known as ''[[Wandervogel|Der Wandervogel]]'' (&quot;migratory bird&quot;), the movement opposed the formality of traditional German clubs, instead emphasizing amateur music and singing, creative dress, and communal outings involving hiking and camping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Inspired by the works of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Goethe]], [[Hermann Hesse]], and Eduard Baltzer, Wandervogel attracted thousands of young Germans who rejected the rapid trend toward urbanization and yearned for the [[Germanic Neopaganism|pagan]], back-to-nature spiritual life of their ancestors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kennedy_Ryan&quot;&gt;{{Citation

}}. See also: {{harvnb|Kennedy|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the first several decades of the 20th century, Germans settled around the United States, bringing the values of the Wandervogel with them. Some opened the first [[health food store]]s, and many moved to [[Southern California]] where they could practice an alternative lifestyle in a warm climate. Over time, young Americans adopted the beliefs and practices of the new immigrants. One group, called the &quot;Nature Boys&quot;, took to the California desert and raised organic food, espousing a back-to-nature lifestyle like the Wandervogel.&lt;ref name=LAT081004&gt;Elaine Woo, [http://articles.latimes.com/2004/aug/10/local/me-boots10 Gypsy Boots, 89; Colorful Promoter of Healthy Food and Lifestyles], ''Los Angeles Times'', August 10, 2004, Accessed December 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Songwriter [[eden ahbez|Eden Ahbez]] wrote a hit song called ''[[Nature Boy (song)|Nature Boy]]'' inspired by Robert Bootzin ([[Gypsy Boots]]), who helped popularize health-consciousness, [[yoga]], and [[organic food]] in the United States.

Like Wandervogel, the hippie movement in the United States began as a youth movement. Composed mostly of white teenagers and young adults between 15 and 25 years old,&lt;ref&gt;[[Benjamin Zablocki|Zablocki, Benjamin]]. &quot;Hippies.&quot; ''World Book Online Reference Center''. 2006. Retrieved on 2006-10-12. &quot;Hippies were members of a youth movement...from white middle-class families and ranged in age from 15 to 25 years old.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dudley_2000_193194&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dudley|2000|pp=193–194}}.&lt;/ref&gt; hippies inherited a tradition of cultural dissent from [[Bohemianism|bohemian]]s and [[beatniks]] of the [[Beat Generation]] in the late 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dudley_2000_193194&quot;/&gt; Beats like [[Allen Ginsberg]] crossed over from the beat movement and became fixtures of the burgeoning hippie and anti-war movements. By 1965, hippies had become an established [[Group (sociology)|social group]] in the U.S., and the movement eventually expanded to other countries,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hirsch_1993_419&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hirsch|1993|p=419}}. Hirsch describes hippies as: &quot;Members of a cultural protest that began in the U.S. in the 1960s and affected Europe before fading in the 1970s...fundamentally a cultural rather than a political protest.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendergast_2005&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pendergast|Pendergast|2005}}. Pendergast writes: &quot;The Hippies made up the...nonpolitical subgroup of a larger group known as the counterculture...the counterculture included several distinct groups...One group, called the New Left...Another broad group called...the Civil Rights Movement...did not become a recognizable social group until after 1965...according to John C. McWilliams, author of ''The 1960s Cultural Revolution''.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; extending as far as the United Kingdom and Europe, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Japan, [[La Onda|Mexico]], and Brazil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone_1994&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stone|1994|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/havens.htm Hippy Havens]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The hippie ethos influenced [[The Beatles]] and others in the United Kingdom and other parts of Europe, and they in turn influenced their American counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;August 28 - Bob Dylan turns The Beatles on to cannabis for the second time.

Along with the [[New Left]] and the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]], the hippie movement was one of three dissenting groups of the 1960s counterculture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendergast_2005&quot; /&gt; Hippies rejected established institutions, criticized [[middle class]] values, opposed [[nuclear weapons]] and the [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|Vietnam War]], embraced aspects of [[Eastern philosophy]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Oldmeadow_2004_260269&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Oldmeadow|2004|pp=260, 264}}.&lt;/ref&gt; championed [[sexual liberation]], were often [[vegetarian]] and [[environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]], promoted the use of [[psychedelic drug]]s which they believed expanded one's consciousness, and created [[Intentional community|intentional communities]] or communes. They used alternative arts, [[street theatre]], [[folk music]], and [[psychedelic rock]] as a part of their lifestyle and as a way of expressing their feelings, their protests and their vision of the world and life. Hippies opposed political and social orthodoxy, choosing a gentle and nondoctrinaire ideology that favored peace, love and personal freedom,&lt;ref name=&quot;Time-Life Books_1998_137&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stolley|1998|pp=137}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Yippie]] [[Abbie Hoffman]] envisioned a different society: &quot;...where people share things, and we don't need money; where you have the machines for the people.

See also [[Wes Nisker]]'s ''The Big Bang, The Buddha, and the Baby Boom'': &quot;At its core, however, hippie was a spiritual phenomenon, a big, unfocused, revival meeting.&quot; Nisker cites the ''San Francisco Oracle'', which described the Human Be-In as a &quot;spiritual revolution&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1960s, novelist [[Ken Kesey]] and The [[Merry Pranksters]] lived communally in California. Members included Beat Generation hero [[Neal Cassady]], [[Ken Babbs]], [[Carolyn Garcia|Carolyn Adams (aka Mountain Girl and Carolyn Garcia)]], [[Stewart Brand]], [[Del Close]], [[Paul Foster (cartoonist)|Paul Foster]], [[Merry Pranksters|George Walker]], Sandy Lehmann-Haupt and others. Their early escapades were documented in [[Tom Wolfe]]'s book ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]''. With Cassady at the wheel of a school bus named [[Further (bus)|Further]], the Merry Pranksters traveled across the United States to celebrate the publication of Kesey's novel ''[[Sometimes a Great Notion (novel)|Sometimes a Great Notion]]'' and to visit the 1964 [[World's Fair]] in New York City. The Merry Pranksters were known for using [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]], [[amphetamines]], and [[LSD]], and during their journey they &quot;turned on&quot; many people to these [[Psychoactive drug|drug]]s. The Merry Pranksters filmed and audiotaped their bus trips, creating an immersive multimedia experience that would later be presented to the public in the form of festivals and concerts. The [[Grateful Dead]] wrote a song about the Merry Pranksters' bus trips called &quot;That's It for the Other One&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodd 1998&quot;/&gt;

During this period [[Greenwich Village]] in New York City and [[Berkeley, California]] anchored the American folk music circuit. Berkeley's two coffee houses, the Cabale Creamery and the Jabberwock, sponsored performances by folk music artists in a beat setting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

This ceremony combined a [[psychedelic experience]] with traditional Native American spiritual values; these people went on to sponsor a unique genre of musical expression and performance at the Red Dog Saloon in the isolated, old-time mining town of [[Virginia City, Nevada]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Works&quot; /&gt;

During the summer of 1965, Laughlin recruited much of the original talent that led to a unique amalgam of traditional folk music and the developing psychedelic rock scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Works&quot;&gt;{{Citation

There was no clear delineation between &quot;performers&quot; and &quot;audience&quot; in &quot;The Red Dog Experience&quot;, during which music, psychedelic experimentation, a unique sense of personal style and Bill Ham's first primitive light shows combined to create a new sense of community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ham&quot;&gt;{{Citation

When they returned to San Francisco, Red Dog participants Luria Castell, Ellen Harman and Alton Kelley created a collective called &quot;The Family Dog.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Works&quot;/&gt; Modeled on their Red Dog experiences, on October 16, 1965, the Family Dog hosted &quot;[[Doctor Strange|A Tribute to Dr. Strange]]&quot; at Longshoreman's Hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grunenberg_2005_325&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Grunenberg|Harris|2005|p=325}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Attended by approximately 1,000 of the Bay Area's original &quot;hippies&quot;, this was San Francisco's first [[psychedelic rock]] performance, costumed dance and light show, featuring [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[The Great Society (band)|The Great Society]] and The Marbles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/05/20/MNG2NPUD1C1.DTL&amp;ao=all | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Joel | last=Selvin | title=Summer of Love: 40 Years Later / 1967: The stuff that myths are made of | date=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other events followed before year's end, one at California Hall and one at the Matrix.&lt;ref name=&quot;Works&quot; /&gt; After the first three Family Dog events, a much larger psychedelic event occurred at San Francisco's Longshoreman's Hall.

By February 1966, the Family Dog became Family Dog Productions under organizer [[Chet Helms]], promoting happenings at the [[Avalon Ballroom]] and the [[The Fillmore|Fillmore Auditorium]] in initial cooperation with [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]]. The Avalon Ballroom, the Fillmore Auditorium and other venues provided settings where participants could partake of the full psychedelic music experience. Bill Ham, who had pioneered the original Red Dog light shows, perfected his art of [[Liquid light show|liquid light projection]], which combined light shows and film projection and became [[Wiktionary:synonymous#Pronunciation|synonymous]] with the San Francisco ballroom experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Works&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Grunenberg_2005_156&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Grunenberg|Harris|2005|p=156}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The sense of style and costume that began at the Red Dog Saloon flourished when San Francisco's Fox Theater went out of business and hippies bought up its costume stock, reveling in the freedom to dress up for weekly musical performances at their favorite ballrooms. As ''San Francisco Chronicle'' music columnist [[Ralph J. Gleason]] put it, &quot;They danced all night long, orgiastic, spontaneous and completely free form.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Works&quot; /&gt;

Some of the earliest San Francisco hippies were former students at [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]]&lt;ref&gt;The college was later renamed San Francisco State University.&lt;/ref&gt; who became intrigued by the developing psychedelic hippie music scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Works&quot; /&gt; These students joined the bands they loved, living communally in the large, inexpensive [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] apartments in the [[Haight-Ashbury]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry_2005_57&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|2005|pp=5–7}}. Perry writes that SFSC students rented cheap, Edwardian-Victorians in the Haight.&lt;/ref&gt; Young Americans around the country began moving to San Francisco, and by June 1966, around 15,000 hippies had moved into the Haight.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tompkins_2001b&quot; /&gt; [[The Charlatans (U.S. band)|The Charlatans]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]], and the [[Grateful Dead]] all moved to San Francisco's Haight-Ashbury neighborhood during this period.

By late 1966, [[Diggers (theater)|the Diggers]] opened [[free stores]] which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lytle_2006_213215&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lytle|2006|pp=213, 215}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grateful Dead played, and some sources claim that LSD was consumed at the rally. According to Cohen, those who took LSD &quot;were not guilty of using illegal substances...We were celebrating transcendental consciousness, the beauty of the universe, the beauty of being.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee_Shlain_1992_149&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|Shlain|1992|p=149}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Be-In poster.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Poster for the [[Human Be-In]] by Michael Bowen]]
On January 14, 1967, the outdoor [[Human Be-In]] organized by [[Michael Bowen (artist)|Michael Bowen]]&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Chronology of San Francisco Rock 1965-1969&lt;/ref&gt; helped to popularize hippie culture across the United States, with 20,000 hippies gathering in San Francisco's Golden Gate Park. On March 26, [[Lou Reed]], [[Edie Sedgwick]] and 10,000 hippies came together in [[Manhattan]] for the [[Central Park Be-In]] on [[Easter Sunday]].&lt;ref&gt;DeCurtis, Anthony.

The lyrics, &quot;If you're going to San Francisco, be sure to wear some flowers in your hair&quot;, inspired thousands of young people from all over the world to travel to San Francisco, sometimes wearing flowers in their hair and distributing flowers to passersby, earning them the name, &quot;[[flower child|Flower Children]]&quot;. Bands like the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Big Brother and the Holding Company]] (with [[Janis Joplin]]), and [[Jefferson Airplane]] lived in the Haight.

In June 1967, [[Herb Caen]] was approached by &quot;a distinguished magazine&quot;&lt;ref name=Caen/&gt; to write about why hippies were attracted to San Francisco. He declined the assignment but interviewed hippies in the Haight for his own newspaper column in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''. Caen determined that, &quot;Except in their music, they couldn't care less about the approval of the straight world.&quot;&lt;ref name=Caen/&gt; Caen himself felt that the city of San Francisco was so straight that it provided a visible contrast with hippie culture.&lt;ref name=Caen&gt;SFGate.com.

The media was right behind them, casting a spotlight on the Haight-Ashbury district and popularizing the &quot;hippie&quot; label. With this increased attention, hippies found support for their ideals of love and peace but were also criticized for their anti-work, pro-drug, and permissive ethos.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

At this point, [[The Beatles]] had released their groundbreaking album ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' which was quickly embraced by the hippie movement with its colorful psychedelic sonic imagery.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Revolution (1967&amp;ndash;1969)===
By 1968, hippie-influenced fashions were beginning to take off in the mainstream, especially for youths and younger adults of the populous &quot;[[Baby Boomer]]&quot; generation, many of whom may have aspired to emulate the hardcore movements now living in tribalistic communes, but had no overt connections to them. This was noticed not only in terms of clothes and also longer hair for men, but also in music, film, art, and literature, and not just in the US, but around the world. [[Eugene McCarthy]]'s brief presidential campaign successfully persuaded a significant minority of young adults to &quot;get clean for Gene&quot; by shaving their beards or wearing longer skirts; however the &quot;Clean Genes&quot; had little impact on the popular image in the media spotlight, of the hirsute hippy adorned in beads, feathers, flowers and bells.

[[File:Psych out.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Poster for the [[hippie exploitation films|hippie exploitation film]] ''[[Psych-Out]]'']] A sign of this was the visibility that the hippie subculture gained in various mainstream and underground media. [[Hippie exploitation films]] are 1960s [[exploitation films]] about the hippie counterculture&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesocietyofthespectacle.com/2009/04/mondo-mod-worlds-of-hippie-revolt-and-other-weirdness/ MONDO MOD WORLDS OF HIPPIE REVOLT (AND OTHER WEIRDNESS]&lt;/ref&gt; with stereotypical situations associated with the movement such as [[marihuana]] and [[LSD]] use, sex and wild psychedelic parties. &quot;From almost the beginning, Hollywood also got in on the action and produced a number of extremely lurid hippie exploitation films masquerading as cautionary public service announcements, but which were in fact aimed directly at feeding a morbid public appetite while pretending to take a moral stance. Often depicting drug-crazed hippies living and freaking out in “Manson family” style communes, such films as The ''[[Hallucination Generation]]'' (1967) and ''[[Riot on Sunset Strip]]'' (1967) depicted “hippie” youths running wild in an orgy of group sex, drugs, crime and even murder.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.steamshovelpress.com/fromeditor48.html &quot;The Summer of Love Breeds a Season of Hate: The Effects of the Manson Murders on Public Perceptions of the Hippie Lifestyle&quot; by Curt Rowlett]&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples include ''[[The Love-ins]]'', ''[[Psych-Out]]'', ''[[The Trip (1967 film)|The Trip]]'', and ''[[Wild in the Streets]]''. Other more serious and more critically acclaimed films about the hippie counterculture also appeared such as ''[[Easy Rider]]'' and ''[[Alice's Restaurant]]'' (for more information on hippie related films see [[List of films related to the hippie subculture]]). Documentaries and television programs have also been produced until today as well as [[List of books and publications related to the hippie subculture|fiction and nonfiction books]]. Also the popular broadway musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' was presented in 1967.

The [[Yippies]], who were seen as an offshoot of the hippie movements parodying as a political party, came to national attention during their celebration of the 1968 spring equinox, when some 3,000 of them took over [[Grand Central Terminal]] in New York &amp;mdash; eventually resulting in 61 arrests. The Yippies, especially their leaders [[Abbie Hoffman]] and [[Jerry Rubin]], became notorious for their theatrics, such as trying to levitate the Pentagon at the October 1967 war protest, and such slogans as &quot;Rise up and abandon the creeping meatball!&quot; Their stated intention to protest the [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in Chicago in August, including nominating their own candidate, &quot;[[Pigasus (politics)|Lyndon Pigasus Pig]]&quot; (an actual pig), was also widely publicized in the media at this time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900067,00.html &quot;The Politics of Yip&quot;, ''TIME Magazine'', Apr. 5, 1968]&lt;/ref&gt; In Cambridge, hippies congregated each Sunday for a large &quot;be-in&quot; at Cambridge Park with swarms of drummers and those beginning the Women's Movement.

In April 1969, the building of [[People's Park]] in Berkeley, California received international attention. The [[University of California, Berkeley]] had demolished all the buildings on a {{convert|2.8|acre|m2|sing=on}} parcel near campus, intending to use the land to build playing fields and a parking lot. After a long delay, during which the site became a dangerous eyesore, thousands of ordinary Berkeley citizens, merchants, students, and hippies took matters into their own hands, planting trees, shrubs, flowers and grass to convert the land into a park. A major confrontation ensued on May 15, 1969, when Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] ordered the park destroyed, which led to a two-week occupation of the city of Berkeley by the [[California National Guard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wollenberg&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Wollenberg|first=Charles |title=Berkeley, A City in History|publisher=University of California Press|year=2008|isbn=0-520-25307-8|url=http://www.berkeleypubliclibrary.org/system/Chapter9.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hayward_2001&gt;{{Citation|last=Hayward|first=Steven F.|title=The Age of Reagan, 1964-1980: The Fall of the Old Liberal Order|year=2001|publisher=Prima Publishing|location=Roseville, California|isbn=978-0-7615-1337-7|oclc=47667257|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0BafgsBIlrwC&amp;pg=PA325|accessdate=31 January 2011|page=325}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flower power]] came into its own during this occupation as hippies engaged in acts of [[civil disobedience]] to plant flowers in empty lots all over Berkeley under the slogan &quot;Let a Thousand Parks Bloom&quot;.

In August 1969, the [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock Music and Art Fair]] took place in [[Bethel, New York]], which for many, exemplified the best of hippie counterculture. Over 500,000 people arrived&lt;ref name=&quot;Dean&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Dean|first=Maury|authorlink=Maury Dean |title=Rock 'N' Roll Gold Rush|publisher=Algora Publishing|year=2003|pages=243|isbn=0-87586-207-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; to hear some of the most notable musicians and bands of the era, among them [[Canned Heat]], [[Richie Havens]], [[Joan Baez]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[The Grateful Dead]], [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], [[Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young]], [[Carlos Santana]], [[The Who]], [[Jefferson Airplane]], and [[Jimi Hendrix]]. [[Wavy Gravy|Wavy Gravy's]] [[Hog Farm]] provided security and attended to practical needs, and the hippie ideals of love and human fellowship seemed to have gained real-world expression. Similar rock festivals occurred in other parts of the country, which played a significant role in spreading hippie ideals throughout America.&lt;ref&gt;Mankin, Bill.

In December 1969, a rock festival took place in [[Altamont, California]], about 30 miles (45&amp;nbsp;km) east of San Francisco. Initially billed as &quot;Woodstock West&quot;, its official name was [[Altamont Music Festival|The Altamont Free Concert]]. About 300,000 people gathered to hear [[The Rolling Stones]]; [[Crosby, Stills, Nash, &amp; Young|Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]]; [[Jefferson Airplane]] and other bands. The [[Hells Angels]] provided security that proved far less benevolent than the security provided at the Woodstock event: 18-year-old [[Meredith Hunter]] was stabbed and killed during The Rolling Stones' performance after he brandished a gun and waved it toward the stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/05/26/ALTAMONT.TMP|title=Altamont 'cold case' is being closed|last=Lee|first=Henry K.|date=2005-05-26|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another shock came in the form of the [[Sharon Tate]] and [[Leno and Rosemary LaBianca]] murders committed in August 1969 by [[Charles Manson]] and his &quot;family&quot; of followers. Nevertheless, the turbulent political atmosphere that featured the bombing of [[Cambodia]] and shootings by [[National Guard of the United States|National Guardsmen]] at [[Jackson State University]] and [[Kent State University]] still brought people together. These shootings inspired the May 1970 song by [[Quicksilver Messenger Service]] &quot;What About Me?&quot;, where they sang, &quot;You keep adding to my numbers as you shoot my people down&quot;, as well as [[Neil Young]]'s &quot;[[Ohio (CSNY song)|Ohio]]&quot;, recorded by [[Crosby, Stills &amp; Nash (and Young)|Crosby, Stills, Nash and Young]].

The anti-war movement reached its peak in May 1971 as 40,000 protesters were arrested in Washington DC. President Nixon himself actually ventured out of the White House and chatted with a group of the 'hippie' protesters. The draft was ended soon thereafter, in 1973. In the mid-1970s, with the end of the draft and the [[Vietnam War]], a renewal of [[patriotism|patriotic]] sentiment associated with the approach of the [[United States Bicentennial]] and the emergence of [[punk movement|punk]] in London, Manchester, New York and Los Angeles, the mainstream media lost interest in the hippie counterculture. At the same time there was [[Mod revival|a revival of the Mod subculture]], skinheads, [[Teddy Boy|teddy boys]] and the emergence of new youth cultures, like the [[goth subculture|goths]] (an arty offshoot of punk) and [[football casuals]].

Hippie ideals had a marked influence on [[anarcho-punk]] and some [[post-punk]] youth subcultures, especially during the [[Second Summer of Love]].

Hippie communes, where members tried to live the ideals of the hippie movement continued to flourish. On the west coast, Oregon had quite a few.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cavejunction.com/cavejunction/locsites2.shtml &quot;In Cave Junction alone there were a number of communes listed&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Some faded away. Some are still around. 

While many hippies made a long-term commitment to the lifestyle, some people argue that hippies &quot;sold out&quot; during the 1980s and became part of the materialist, consumer culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lattin_2004&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lattin|2004|pp=74}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heath_Potter_2004&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Heath|Potter|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although not as visible as it once was, hippie culture has never died out completely: hippies and neo-hippies can still be found on college campuses, on communes, and at gatherings and festivals. Many embrace the hippie values of peace, love, and community, and hippies may still be found in [[Bohemianism|bohemian]] enclaves around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stone_1994&quot; /&gt;

Towards the end of the 20th century, a trend of &quot;cyber hippies&quot; emerged, that embraced some of the qualities of the 1960s psychedelic counterculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/lifestyle/technohippies08.shtml &quot;High-tech cyber hippies seek a higher consciousness through massive dance fests in the wild&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethos and characteristics==
Hippies sought to free themselves from societal restrictions, choose their own way, and find new [[meaning of life|meaning in life]]. One expression of hippie independence from societal norms was found in their standard of dress and grooming, which made hippies instantly recognizable to one another, and served as a visual symbol of their respect for individual rights. Through their appearance, hippies declared their willingness to question authority, and distanced themselves from the &quot;straight&quot; and &quot;[[square (slang)|square]]&quot; (i.e., conformist) segments of society.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yablonsky_1968_243357&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Yablonsky|1968|pp=103 et al.}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Personality traits]] and values that hippies tend to be associated with are &quot;[[altruism]] and [[mysticism]], [[honesty]], [[Happiness|joy]] and [[nonviolence]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899555-1,00.html &quot;The Hippies&quot; in Time magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, many thoughtful hippies distanced themselves from the very idea that the way a person dresses could be a reliable signal of who he was &amp;mdash; especially after outright criminals such as [[Charles Manson]] began to adopt superficial hippie characteristics, and also after plainclothes policemen started to &quot;dress like hippies&quot; to [[divide and rule|divide and conquer]] legitimate members of the counter-culture. [[Frank Zappa]] admonished his audience that &quot;we all wear a uniform&quot;; the San Francisco clown/hippie [[Wavy Gravy]] said in 1987 that he could still see fellow-feeling in the eyes of [[Market Street (San Francisco)|Market Street]] businessmen who had dressed conventionally to survive.

Leading proponents of the 1960s Psychedelic Art movement were San Francisco poster artists such as:  [[Rick Griffin]], [[Victor Moscoso]], [[Bonnie MacLean]], [[Stanley Mouse]] &amp; [[Alton Kelley]], and [[Wes Wilson]].  Their Psychedelic Rock concert posters were inspired by [[Art Nouveau]], Victoriana, [[Dada]], and [[Pop Art]]. The &quot;Fillmore Posters&quot; were among the most notable of the time.  Richly saturated colors in glaring contrast, elaborately ornate lettering, strongly symmetrical composition, collage elements, rubber-like distortions, and bizarre iconography are all hallmarks of the San Francisco psychedelic poster art style.  The style flourished from roughly the years 1966 to 1972.  Their work was immediately influential to album cover art, and indeed all of the aforementioned artists also created album covers. Psychedelic light-shows were a new art-form developed for rock concerts. Using oil and dye in an emulsion that was set between large convex lenses upon overhead projectors, the lightshow artists created bubbling liquid visuals that pulsed in rhythm to the music.  This was mixed with slideshows and film loops to create an improvisational motion picture art form, and to give visual representation to the improvisational jams of the rock bands and create a completely &quot;trippy&quot; atmosphere for the audience.  The [[Brotherhood of Light]] were responsible for many of the light-shows in San Francisco psychedelic rock concerts.
[[Image:Freak Brother No 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|No. 1 of the cult underground comic strip ''[[The Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]]'' which dealt with the adventures and lifestyles of three fictional hippies]]
Out of the psychedelic counterculture there also arose a new genre of comic books: [[underground comix]].  &quot;Zap Comix&quot; was among the original underground comics, and featured the work of [[Robert Crumb]], [[S. Clay Wilson]], [[Victor Moscoso]], [[Rick Griffin]], and [[Robert Williams (artist)|Robert Williams]] among others.  Underground Comix were ribald, intensely satirical, and seemed to pursue weirdness for the sake of weirdness.   [[Gilbert Shelton]] created perhaps the most enduring of underground cartoon characters, &quot;The [[Fabulous Furry Freak Brothers]]&quot;, whose drugged-out exploits held a hilarious mirror up to the hippy lifestyle of the 1960s.

As in the beat movement preceding them, and the [[punk movement]] that followed soon after, hippie symbols and iconography were purposely borrowed from either &quot;low&quot; or &quot;primitive&quot; cultures, with hippie fashion reflecting a disorderly, often [[Vagrancy (people)|vagrant]] style.&lt;ref name=&quot;Katz_1988_120&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Katz|1988|pp=120}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As with other adolescent, white middle-class movements, [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]] of the hippies involved challenging the prevailing [[gender differences]] of their time: both men and women in the hippie movement wore jeans and maintained long hair,&lt;ref name=&quot;Katz_1988_125&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Katz|1988|pp=125}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and both genders wore sandals or went [[barefoot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tompkins_2001b&quot; /&gt; Men often wore beards,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendergast_2004&quot;&gt;{{Citation

=== Love and sex ===
{{See also|Free love}}
[[Image:Oz Mag Number 28.png|thumb|left|200px|''[[Oz (magazine)|Oz]]'' number 28, also known as the &quot;[[Schoolkids OZ|Schoolkids issue of OZ]]&quot;, which was the main cause of a 1971 high-profile obscenity case in the United Kingdom. ''Oz'' was a UK underground publication with a general hippie / counter-cultural point of view.]] The common stereotype on the issues of love and sex had it that the hippies were &quot;[[promiscuous]], having wild sex [[orgies]], seducing innocent teenagers and every manner of sexual perversion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;StonesexII&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stone|1994|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm &quot;Sex, Love and Hippies&quot;]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The hippie movement appeared concurrently in the midst of a rising [[Sexual Revolution]], in which many views of the ''status quo'' on this subject were being challenged. 

The clinical study ''[[Human Sexual Response (book)|Human Sexual Response]]'' was published by [[Masters and Johnson]] in 1966, and the topic suddenly became more commonplace in America. The 1969 book ''[[Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex (But Were Afraid to Ask)]]'' by Dr. [[David Reuben (sex author)|David Reuben]] was a more popular attempt at answering the public's curiosity regarding such matters. Then in 1972 appeared ''[[The Joy of Sex]]'' by [[Alex Comfort]], reflecting an even more candid perception of love-making. By this time, the recreational or 'fun' aspects of sexual behavior were being discussed more openly than ever before, and this more 'enlightened' outlook resulted not just from the publication of such new books as these, but from a more pervasive Sexual Revolution that had already been well underway for some time.&lt;ref name=&quot;StonesexII&quot;/&gt; 

The hippies inherited various countercultural views and practices regarding sex and love from the [[Beat Generation]]; &quot;their writings influenced the hippies to open up when it came to sex, and to experiment without guilt or [[jealousy]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;StonesexIII&quot;&gt;&quot;Again the Beat generation must be credited with living and writing about sexual freedom. Allen Ginsberg, Jack Kerouac, William Burroughs and others lived unusually free, sexually expressive lives.&quot;{{harvnb|Stone|1994|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm &quot;Sex, Love and Hippies&quot;]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One popular hippie slogan that appeared was &quot;If it feels good, do it!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stonesex&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stone|1994|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm &quot;Sex, Love and Hippies&quot;]}}&lt;/ref&gt; which for many &quot;meant you were free to love whomever you pleased, whenever you pleased, however you pleased. This encouraged spontaneous sexual activity and experimentation. [[Group sex]], [[public sex]]...[[homosexuality]], all the taboos went out the window. This doesn't mean that straight sex...or [[monogamy]] were unknown, quite the contrary. Nevertheless, the [[open relationship]] became an accepted part of the hippy lifestyle. This meant that you might have a primary relationship with one person, but if another attracted you, you could explore that relationship without rancor or jealousy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;StonesexII&quot;/&gt;

Hippies embraced the old slogan of [[free love]] of the radical social reformers of other eras; it was accordingly observed that &quot;Free love made the whole love, marriage, sex, baby package obsolete. Love was no longer limited to one person, you could love anyone you chose. In fact love was something you shared with everyone, not just your sex partners. Love exists to be shared freely. We also discovered the more you share, the more you get!  So why reserve your love for a select few?  This profound truth was one of the great hippie revelations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;StonesexII&quot;/&gt; Sexual experimentation alongside psychedelics also occurred, due to the perception of their being uninhibitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;StonesexIV&quot;&gt;&quot;But the biggest release of inhibitions came about through the use of drugs, particularly marijuana and the psychedelics. Marijuana is one of the best aphrodisiacs known to man. It enhances the senses, unlike alcohol, which dulls them. As any hippie can tell you, sex is a great high, but sex on pot is fuckin' far out![...] More importantly, the use of psychedelic drugs, especially LSD was directly responsible for liberating hippies from their sexual hang-ups. The LSD trip is an intimate soul wrenching experience that shatters the ego's defenses, leaving the tripper in a very poignant and sensitive state. At this point, a sexual encounter is quite possible if conditions are right. After an LSD trip, one is much more likely to explore one's own sexual nature without inhibitions.&quot; {{harvnb|Stone|1994|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm &quot;Sex, Love and Hippies&quot;]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others explored the spiritual aspects of sex.&lt;ref name=&quot;StonesexV&quot;&gt;&quot;Many hippies on the spiritual path found enlightenment through sex. The ''[[Kama Sutra]]'', the [[Tantric sex]]ual manual from ancient India is a way to cosmic union through sex. Some gurus like Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh ([[Osho]]) formed cults that focused on liberation through the release of sexual inhibitions&quot;{{harvnb|Stone|1994|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm &quot;Sex, Love and Hippies&quot;]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travel===
{{Refimprove section|date=May 2009}}
[[Image:Gypsy Van Front.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Hand-crafted Hippie Truck, 1968]]
Hippies tended to travel light, and could pick up and go wherever the action was at any time. Whether at a &quot;love-in&quot; on [[Mount Tamalpais]] near San Francisco, a demonstration against the Vietnam War in Berkeley, or one of [[Ken Kesey]]'s &quot;Acid Tests&quot;, if the &quot;vibe&quot; wasn't right and a change of scene was desired, hippies were mobile at a moment's notice. Planning was eschewed, as hippies were happy to put a few clothes in a backpack, stick out their thumbs and hitchhike anywhere. Hippies seldom worried whether they had money, hotel reservations or any of the other standard accoutrements of travel. Hippie households welcomed overnight guests on an ''impromptu'' basis, and the reciprocal nature of the lifestyle permitted greater freedom of movement. People generally cooperated to meet each other's needs in ways that became less common after the early 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yablonsky_1968_106107&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Yablonsky|1968|p=201}}&lt;/ref&gt; This way of life is still seen among [[Rainbow Family]] groups, [[new age travellers]] and New Zealand's [[housetrucker]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

[[Image:Gypsy Van Interior.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hippie Truck interior]]
A derivative of this free-flow style of travel were the hippie trucks and buses, hand-crafted mobile houses built on a truck or bus chassis to facilitate a nomadic lifestyle, as documented in the 1974 book ''Roll Your Own''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mrsharkey.com/busbarn/rollown/rollown.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these mobile gypsy houses were quite elaborate, with beds, toilets, showers and cooking facilities.

On the West Coast, a unique lifestyle developed around the [[Renaissance Faire]]s that Phyllis and Ron Patterson first organized in 1963. During the summer and fall months, entire families traveled together in their trucks and buses, parked at Renaissance Pleasure Faire sites in Southern and Northern California, worked their crafts during the week, and donned Elizabethan costume for weekend performances, and to attend booths where handmade goods were sold to the public. The sheer number of young people living at the time made for unprecedented travel opportunities to special happenings. The peak experience of this type was the [[Woodstock Festival]] near [[Bethel, New York]], from August 15 to 18, 1969, which drew over 500,000 people.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==== Hippie trail ====
{{Main|Hippie trail}}
One travel experience, undertaken by hundreds of thousands of hippies between 1969 and 1971, was the [[Hippie trail]] overland route to [[India]]. Carrying little or no luggage, and with small amounts of cash, almost all followed the same route, hitch-hiking across Europe to [[Athens]] and on to [[Istanbul]], then by train through central [[Turkey]] via [[Erzurum]], continuing by bus into [[Iran]], via [[Tabriz]] and [[Tehran]] to [[Mashhad]], across the Afghan border into [[Herat]], through southern [[Afghanistan]] via [[Kandahar]] to [[Kabul]], over the [[Khyber Pass]] into [[Pakistan]], via [[Rawalpindi]] and [[Lahore]] to the Indian frontier. Once in India, hippies went to many different destinations, but gathered in large numbers on the beaches of [[Goa]] and [[Kovalam]] in [[Trivandrum]] ([[Kerala]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Sherwood&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2006/04/09/travel/09goa.html|title=A New Generation of Pilgrims Hits India's Hippie Trail |last=Sherwood|first=Seth|publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=2008-09-11 | date=2006-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; or crossed the border into [[Nepal]] to spend months in [[Kathmandu]]. In Kathmandu, most of the hippies hung out in the tranquil surroundings of a place called Freak Street,&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ioltravel.co.za/article/view/3549557|title=Have a high time on hippy trail in Katmandu|date=2001-01-30|publisher=Independent Online|accessdate=2008-09-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071011064213/http://www.ioltravel.co.za/article/view/3549557 |archivedate = October 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Nepal Bhasa]]: Jhoo Chhen) which still exists near Kathmandu Durbar Square.

===Spirituality and religion===
Many hippies rejected mainstream organized religion in favor of a more personal spiritual experience, often drawing on indigenous and folk beliefs. If they adhered to mainstream faiths, hippies were likely to embrace [[Buddhism]], [[Unitarian Universalism]], [[Hinduism]] and the [[restorationist]] Christianity of the [[Jesus Movement]]. Some hippies embraced [[neo-paganism]], especially [[Wicca]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online.php?id=552&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1991 book, &quot;Hippies and American Values&quot;, Timothy Miller described the hippie ethos as essentially a &quot;religious movement&quot; whose goal was to transcend the limitations of mainstream religious institutions. &quot;Like many dissenting religions, the hippies were enormously hostile to the religious institutions of the dominant culture, and they tried to find new and adequate ways to do the tasks the dominant religions failed to perform.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=e7F31yYxOMAC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;dq=hippie+as+a+religious+movements&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HBMRWRs-zN&amp;sig=0rEsZECxVWDhme6MO1Ui8-AFZ3k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=89oAT4uoIdTYiQKC0-SDDw&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=hippie%20as%20a%20religious%20movements&amp;f=false Timothy Miller. ''Hippies and American Values''. Univ Tennessee Press; 1st edition]&lt;/ref&gt; In his seminal, contemporaneous work, &quot;The Hippie Trip&quot;, author Lewis Yablonsky notes that those who were most respected in hippie settings were the spiritual leaders, the so-called &quot;high priests&quot; who emerged during that era.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hippie Trip'', Lewis Yablonsky, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt;

One such hippie &quot;high priest&quot; was San Francisco State University Professor [[Stephen Gaskin]].  Beginning in 1966, Gaskin's &quot;Monday Night Class&quot; eventually outgrew the lecture hall, and attracted 1,500 hippie followers in an open discussion of spiritual values, drawing from Christian, Buddhist, and Hindu teachings.  In 1970 Gaskin founded a Tennessee community called [[The Farm (Tennessee)|The Farm]], and he still lists his religion as &quot;Hippie.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thefarm.org/lifestyle/miller.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tokeofthetown.com/2010/12/new_book_tells_inside_story_of_biggest_hippie_comm.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Monday-Night-Class-Stephen-Gaskin/dp/1570671818/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325485159&amp;sr=1-1&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flower Power demonstrator.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Iconic photo of a female demonstrator offering a flower to a Military Police officer during an anti-war protest, 10/21/1967.]] &quot;The hippies were heirs to a long line of bohemians that includes [[William Blake]], [[Walt Whitman]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Henry David Thoreau]], [[Herman Hesse]], [[Arthur Rimbaud]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Aldous Huxley]], utopian movements like the [[Rosicrucians]] and the [[Theosophists]], and most directly the [[Beatniks]]. Hippies emerged from a society that had produced birth-control pills, a counterproductive war in Vietnam, the liberation and idealism of the [[civil rights movement]], feminism, gay rights, FM radio, mass-produced LSD, a strong economy, and a huge number of baby-boom teenagers. These elements allowed the hippies to have a mainstream impact that dwarfed that of the Beats and earlier [[avant-garde]] cultures.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dissentmagazine.org/online.php?id=552 &quot;In Defense of Hippies&quot; by Danny Goldberg in ''[[Dissent]]'' magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; For the historian of the [[anarchist]] movement Ronald Creagh, the hippie movement could be considered as the last spectacular resurgence of [[utopian socialism]]&lt;ref name=&quot;wikiwix.com&quot;&gt;[http://wikiwix.com/cache/?url=http://endehors.net/news/communes-communautes-milieux-libres&amp;title=pr%C3%A9sentation%20en%20ligne Ronald Creagh. ''Laboratoires de l’utopie. Les communautés libertaires aux États-Unis''. Paris. Payot. 1983. pg. 11]&lt;/ref&gt; For Creagh, a characteristic of this is the desire for the transformation of society not through political revolution, or through reformist action pushed forward by the state, but through the creation of a counter-society of a [[Libertarian socialism|socialist]] character in the midst of the current system, which will be made up of ideal communities of a more or less [[anarchist|libertarian]] social form.&lt;ref name=&quot;wikiwix.com&quot;/&gt;

The [[Peace symbols|peace symbol]] was developed in the UK as a logo for the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and was embraced by U.S. anti-war protesters during the 1960s.
Hippies were often [[pacifism|pacifists]], and participated in non-violent political demonstrations, such as [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights marches]], the [[protest|marches on Washington D.C.]], and [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|anti–Vietnam War]] demonstrations, including [[draft-card burning]]s and the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|1968 Democratic National Convention protests]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tribune&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/topic/politics/elections/1968-democratic-convention-EVHST000046.topic|title=1968 Democratic Convention|publisher=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The degree of political involvement varied widely among hippies, from those who were active in peace demonstrations, to the more anti-authority street theater and demonstrations of the [[Youth International Party|Yippies]], the most politically active hippie sub-group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Regarding the political activity of hippies, Rubin said, &quot;They mostly prefer to be stoned, but most of them want peace, and they want an end to this stuff.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Seale_1991_350&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Seale|1991|p=350}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to non-violent political demonstrations, hippie opposition to the Vietnam War included organizing political action groups to oppose the war, refusal to serve in the military and conducting &quot;[[teach-in]]s&quot; on college campuses that covered Vietnamese history and the larger political context of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Junker&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Junker|first=Detlef |coauthors= Gassert,Philipp|title=The United States and Germany in the Era of the Cold War, 1945-1990|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2004|pages=424|isbn=0-521-83420-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scott McKenzie's 1967 rendition of John Phillips' song &quot;[[San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)]]&quot;, which helped to inspire the hippie Summer of Love, became a homecoming song for all Vietnam veterans arriving in San Francisco from 1967 onward. McKenzie has dedicated every American performance of &quot;San Francisco&quot; to Vietnam veterans, and he sang in 2002 at the 20th anniversary of the dedication of the [[Vietnam Veterans Memorial]]. Hippie political expression often took the form of &quot;dropping out&quot; of society to implement the changes they sought.

Politically motivated movements aided by hippies include the [[back to the land movement]] of the 1960s, [[cooperative|cooperative business enterprises]], [[alternative energy]], the [[Freedom of the press|free press]] movement, and [[organic farming]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Morford&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner_2006_3239&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Turner|2006|pp=32–39}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The San Francisco group known as [[Diggers (theater)|the Diggers]] articulated an influential radical criticism of contemporary mass consumer society, and so they opened [[free stores]] which simply gave away their stock, provided free food, distributed free drugs, gave away money, organized free music concerts, and performed works of political art.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lytle_2006_213215&quot;/&gt; The Diggers took their name from the original [[Diggers|English Diggers]] (1649–50) led by [[Gerrard Winstanley]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Digger Archives&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.diggers.org/overview.htm |title= Overview: who were (are) the Diggers? |accessdate=2007-06-17 | work=The Digger Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they sought to create a mini-society free of money and [[capitalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;American Experience doc&quot;&gt;{{cite video

&lt;/ref&gt;

Such activism was ideally carried through [[anti-authoritarian]] and [[non-violent]] means; thus it was observed that &quot;The way of the hippie is antithetical to all repressive hierarchical power structures since they are adverse to the hippie goals of peace, love and freedom... Hippies don't impose their beliefs on others. Instead, hippies seek to change the world through reason and by living what they believe.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Stonepolitics&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stone|1994|loc=[http://www.hipplanet.com/books/atoz/sex.htm &quot;The Way of the Hippy&quot;]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The political ideals of hippies influenced other movements, such as [[anarcho-punk]], [[rave culture]], [[green politics]], [[stoner culture]] and the [[new age]] movement. [[Penny Rimbaud]] of the English anarcho-punk band [[Crass]] said in interviews, and in an essay called ''The Last Of The Hippies'', that Crass was formed in memory of his friend, [[Wally Hope]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Last Of The Hippies - An Hysterical Romance |last=Rimbaud |first=Penny |authorlink=Penny Rimbaud |year=1982 |publisher=Crass |url=http://www.spunk.org/texts/places/britain/sp001297.txt}} {{dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rimbaud also said that Crass were heavily involved with the hippie movement throughout the 1960s and 1970s, with [[Dial House, Essex|Dial House]] being established in 1967. Many [[punk subculture|punks]] were often critical of Crass for their involvement in the hippie movement. Like Crass, [[Jello Biafra]] was influenced by the hippie movement, and cited the yippies as a key influence on his political activism and thinking, though he also wrote songs critical of hippies.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Following in the footsteps of the Beats, many hippies used [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] (marijuana), considering it pleasurable and benign. They enlarged their spiritual pharmacopeia to include [[Psychedelics, dissociatives and deliriants|hallucinogen]]s such as LSD, [[psilocybin]], and [[mescaline]], while often renouncing the use of alcohol. On the [[East Coast of the United States]], [[Harvard University]] professors [[Timothy Leary]], [[Ralph Metzner]] and [[Ram Dass|Richard Alpert]] (Ram Dass) advocated psychotropic drugs for [[psychotherapy]], self-exploration, [[Religion and drugs|religious]] and [[Entheogen|spiritual]] use. Regarding LSD, Leary said, &quot;Expand your consciousness and find ecstasy and revelation within.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time-Life Books_1998_139&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stolley|1998|pp=139}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the [[West Coast of the United States]], [[Ken Kesey]] was an important figure in promoting the recreational use of psychotropic drugs, especially LSD, also known as &quot;acid.&quot; By holding what he called &quot;[[Acid Tests]]&quot;, and touring the country with his band of [[Merry Pranksters]], Kesey became a magnet for media attention that drew many young people to the fledgling movement. The [[Grateful Dead]] (originally billed as &quot;The Warlocks&quot;) played some of their first shows at the Acid Tests, often as high on LSD as their audiences. Kesey and the Pranksters had a &quot;vision of turning on the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time-Life Books_1998_139&quot; /&gt; Harder drugs, such as [[amphetamines]] and heroin, were also sometimes used in hippie settings; however, these drugs were often disdained, even among those who used them, because they were recognized as harmful and addictive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yablonsky_1968_243357&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Yablonsky|1968|pp=243, 257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since that time, a wide range of personal appearance options and clothing styles, including nudity, have become more widely acceptable, all of which was uncommon before the hippie era.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pendergast&quot;&gt;Pendergast, Sara.

Additionally, hippie fashion itself has been commonplace in the years since the 1960s in clothing and accessories, particularly the [[peace symbol]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/life/article/Peace-sign-makes-a-statement-in-the-fashion-world-1773516.php Sewing, Joy; [[Houston Chronicle]]; publ. 24 Jan 2008; &quot;Peace sign makes a statement in the fashion world&quot;]. Retrieved 10 Jun 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Astrology]], including everything from serious study to whimsical amusement regarding personal traits, was integral to hippie culture.&lt;ref&gt;The musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' and a multitude of well known contemporary song lyrics such as ''The Age of Aquarius''&lt;/ref&gt;

The hippie legacy in literature includes the lasting popularity of books reflecting the hippie experience, such as ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In music, the [[folk rock]] and [[psychedelic rock]] popular among hippies evolved into genres such as [[acid rock]], [[World music|world beat]] and [[heavy metal music]]. [[Psychedelic trance]] (also known as psytrance) is a type of [[electronic music]] music influenced by 1960s psychedelic rock. The tradition of hippie music festivals began in the United States in 1965 with Ken Kesey's [[Acid Tests]], where the [[Grateful Dead]] played tripping on [[LSD]] and initiated psychedelic jamming. For the next several decades, many hippies and neo-hippies became part of the [[Deadhead]] community, attending music and art festivals held around the country. The [[Grateful Dead]] toured continuously, with few interruptions between 1965 and 1995. [[Phish]] and their fans (called ''Phish Heads'') operated in the same manner, with the band touring continuously between 1983 and 2004. Many contemporary bands performing at hippie festivals and their derivatives are called [[jam band]]s, since they play songs that contain long instrumentals similar to the original hippie bands of the 1960s.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

With the demise of Grateful Dead and Phish, nomadic touring hippies attend a growing series of summer festivals, the largest of which is called the [[Bonnaroo Music Festival|Bonnaroo Music &amp; Arts Festival]], which premiered in 2002. The [[Oregon Country Fair]] is a three-day festival featuring handmade crafts, educational displays and costumed entertainment. The annual [[Starwood Festival]], founded in 1981, is a seven-day event indicative of the spiritual quest of hippies through an exploration of non-mainstream religions and world-views, and has offered performances and classes by a variety of hippie and counter-culture icons.

The [[Burning Man]] festival began in 1986 at a San Francisco beach party and is now held in the [[Black Rock Desert]] northeast of [[Reno, Nevada]]. Although few participants would accept the ''hippie'' label, Burning Man is a contemporary expression of alternative community in the same spirit as early hippie events. The gathering becomes a temporary city (36,500 occupants in 2005, 50,000+ in 2011), with elaborate encampments, displays, and many [[art cars]]. Other events that enjoy a large attendance include the [[Rainbow Family Gatherings]], The Gathering of the Vibes, Community Peace Festivals, and the [[Woodstock Festival]]s.

In the UK, there are many [[new age travellers]] who are known as hippies to outsiders, but prefer to call themselves the [[Peace Convoy]]. They started the [[Stonehenge Free Festival]] in 1974, but [[English Heritage]] later banned the festival, resulting in the [[Battle of the Beanfield]] in 1985. With Stonehenge banned as a festival site, new age travellers gather at the annual [[Glastonbury Festival]].

In [[New Zealand]] between 1976 and 1981 tens of thousands of hippies gathered from around the world on large farms around [[Waihi]] and [[Waikino]] for music and alternatives festivals. Named ''[[Nambassa]]'', the festivals focused on peace, love, and a balanced lifestyle. The events featured practical [[workshops]] and displays advocating [[alternative lifestyles]], [[self sufficiency]], clean and [[sustainable energy]] and [[sustainable living]].&lt;ref&gt;Nambassa: A New Direction, edited by Colin Broadley and Judith Jones, A. H. &amp; A. W. Reed, 1979.ISBN 0-589-01216-9&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:1981 People Pix.jpg|thumb|left|225px|left|Hippies at the [[Nambassa]] 1981 Festival in [[New Zealand]] ]]
In the UK and Europe, the years 1987 to 1989 were marked by a large-scale revival of many characteristics of the hippie movement. This later movement, composed mostly of people aged 18 to 25, adopted much of the original hippie philosophy of love, peace and freedom. The summer of 1988 became known as the [[Second Summer of Love]]. Although the music favored by this movement was modern [[electronic music]], especially [[house music]] and [[acid house]], one could often hear songs from the original hippie era in the ''chill out rooms'' at [[rave]]s. In the UK, many of the well-known figures of this movement first lived communally in [[Stroud Green, London|Stroud Green]], an area of north London located in Finsbury Park.

Popular films depicting the hippie ethos and lifestyle include ''[[Woodstock (film)|Woodstock]]'', ''[[Easy Rider]]'', ''[[Hair (film)|Hair]]'', ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', ''[[Across the Universe (film)|Across the Universe]]'', ''[[Taking Woodstock]]'', and ''[[Crumb (film)|Crumb]]''.

In 2002, photojournalist John Bassett McCleary published a 650-page, 6,000-entry unabridged [[slang dictionary]] devoted to the language of the hippies titled ''The Hippie Dictionary: A Cultural Encyclopedia of the 1960s and 1970s''.

[[Dudeism]], as it is known, holds many connections to the hippie ethos, from its “take it easy” attitude and rebel shrug, to its come-as-you-are sense of individual freedom and expression.
