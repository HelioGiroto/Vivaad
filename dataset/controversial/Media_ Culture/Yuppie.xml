==Characteristics==
Yuppies are mocked for their conspicuous personal consumption and hunger for [[social status]] among their peers. [[Cornell University]] economist [[Robert H. Frank]], author of ''Luxury Fever'', has remarked, &quot;When people were denouncing yuppies, they had considerably lower incomes than yuppies, so the things yuppies spent their money on [[Social perception|seemed]] frivolous and unnecessary from their vantage point.&quot;&lt;ref name=details/&gt; Pro-[[skateboarder]] and businessman [[Tony Hawk]] has said that yuppies give &quot;us visions of bright [[Sweater|V-neck sweaters]] with collars underneath, and all that was vile in the eighties&quot;, and he has also remarked that a &quot;bitchin’ tattoo cannot hide your inner desire to be [[Donald Trump]].&quot;&lt;ref name=Hawk&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.details.com/culture-trends/critical-eye/200611/tony-hawk-takes-on-yuppies#ixzz0whupwMIo|publisher=''[[Details magazine|Details]]''|title=Tony Hawk Takes On Yuppies|first=Gillian|last=Telling|accessdate=August 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and [[political commentator]] [[Victor Davis Hanson]] has written:
{{quote|Yuppism... is not definable entirely by income or [[Social Class|class]]. Rather, it is a late-20th-century cultural phenomenon of [[Narcissism|self-absorbed]] young professionals, earning good pay, enjoying the cultural attractions of sophisticated urban life and thought, and generally out of touch with, indeed antithetical to, most of the challenges and concerns of a far less well-off and more parochial Middle America. For the yuppie male a well-paying job in law, finance, academia, or consulting in a cultural hub, hip fashion, cool appearance, studied poise, elite education, proper recreation and fitness, and general proximity to liberal-thinking elites, especially of the more rarefied sort in the arts, are the mark of a real man.&lt;ref name=VDH&gt;{{Cite news|author=[[Victor Davis Hanson]]|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/243667/obama-fighting-yuppie-factor-victor-davis-hanson|title=Obama: Fighting the Yuppie Factor|accessdate=August 16, 2010|publisher=''National Review''|date=August 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History==
Although the term ''yuppies'' had not appeared until the early 1980s, there was discussion about young urban professionals as early as 1968.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Critics believe that the demand for &quot;instant executives&quot; has led some young climbers to confuse change with growth. One New York consultant comments, &quot;Many executives in their 20s and 30s have been so busy job-hopping that they've never developed their skills. They're apt to suffer a sudden loss of career impetus and go into a power stall.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kessler&gt;{{Cite journal| issn = 0025-1895| volume = 57| issue = 3| pages = 25| last = Kessler| first = Felix| title = Executive Promotion Path: Fast Track for Young Managers| journal = Management Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Joseph Epstein (writer)|Joseph Epstein]] was credited for coining the term in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Movers And Shakers: A Chronology of Words That Shaped Our Age | year = 2006 | publisher = Oxford University Press | last = Ayto | first = John | isbn = 0-19-861452-7 | pages = 128}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is contested and it is claimed that the first printed appearance of the word was in a May 1980 ''[[Chicago]]'' magazine article by Dan Rottenberg.&lt;ref name=ChicagoMagazine&gt;{{Cite news|title= About that urban renaissance.... there'll be a slight delay |author=Dan Rottenberg|publisher=[[Chicago Magazine]]|date=May 1980|page = 154ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term gained currency in the [[United States]] in 1983 when syndicated newspaper columnist [[Bob Greene]] published a story about a business networking group founded in 1982 by the former radical leader [[Jerry Rubin]], formerly of the [[Youth International Party]] (whose members were called ''[[yippie]]s''); Greene said he had heard people at the networking group (which met at [[Studio 54]] to soft [[classical music]]) joke that Rubin had &quot;gone from being a yippie to being a yuppie&quot;. The headline of Greene's story was ''From Yippie to Yuppie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Global Finance and Urban Living: A Study of Metropolitan Change| first = Leslie| last = Budd| coauthors = Whimster, Sam| year = 1992| publisher = Routledge| isbn = 0-415-07097-X| pages = 316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hadden-Guest, Anthony ''The Last Party: Studio 54, Disco, and the Culture of the Night'' New York:1997--William Morrow Page 116&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[East Bay Express]]'' humorist [[Alice Kahn]] claimed to have coined the word in a 1983 column. This claim is disputed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-28/features/8601230082_1_diaper-chronicle-ferdinand]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://yuppie-living.blogspot.com/2006_06_01_archive.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The proliferation of the word was effected by the publication of ''[[The Yuppie Handbook]]'' in January 1983 (a [[tongue-in-cheek]] take on ''[[The Official Preppy Handbook]]''&lt;ref name=Time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,952325,00.html ''Living: Here Come the Yuppies!'', Time, January 9, 1984]&lt;/ref&gt;), followed by Senator [[Gary Hart]]'s 1984 candidacy as a &quot;yuppie candidate&quot; for [[President of the United States]].&lt;ref name=Burnett/&gt; The term was then used to describe a political demographic group of [[social liberalism|socially liberal]] but [[fiscal conservatism|fiscally conservative]] voters favoring his candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Campaign for President: The Managers Look at '84| first = Jonathan| last = Moore| publisher = Praeger/Greenwood| year = 1986| isbn = 0-86569-132-0| pages = 123}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine declared 1984 &quot;The Year of the Yuppie&quot;, characterizing the salary range, occupations, and politics of yuppies as &quot;demographically hazy&quot;.&lt;ref name=Burnett/&gt;

In a 1985 issue of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Theressa Kersten at [[SRI International]] described a &quot;yuppie backlash&quot; by people who fit the demographic profile yet express resentment of the label: &quot;You're talking about a class of people who put off having families so they can make payments on the SAABs ... To be a Yuppie is to be a loathsome undesirable creature&quot;. Leo Shapiro, a [[market research]]er in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]], responded, &quot;[[stereotype|Stereotyping]] always winds up being derogatory. It doesn't matter whether you are trying to advertise to farmers, [[Hispanic]]s or Yuppies, no one likes to be neatly lumped into some group&quot;.&lt;ref name=Burnett/&gt;

Later, the word lost most of its political connotations and, particularly after the [[Black Monday (1987)|1987 stock market crash]], gained the negative socio-economic connotations that it sports today. On April 8, 1991, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine proclaimed the death of the yuppie in a mock [[obituary]].&lt;ref name=Shapiro&gt;{{Cite news| title = The Birth and -- Maybe -- Death of Yuppiedom | first = Walter | last = Shapiro | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,972695-1,00.html | accessdate = 2007-04-28 | work=Time | date=1991-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s, most yuppies made a transition to the middle class but they maintain an upper-middle level lifestyle, as they age well to their 30's and 40's the &quot;yuppie&quot; generation often got married and settled down to have children. The economic boom at the time have transformed some yuppies or higher-income couples into ''[[Bobos in Paradise|Bobos]] or'' the &quot;[[bohemian]] [[bourgeois]]&quot;. {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The term has experienced a resurgence in usage during the 2000s and 2010s. In October 2000, [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] remarked in a ''[[Weekly Standard]]'' article that [[Benjamin Franklin]]- due to his extreme wealth, cosmopolitanism, and adventurous social life- is &quot;Our Founding Yuppie&quot;.&lt;ref name=founding&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Protected/Articles/000/000/011/743hxgre.asp|author=David Brooks|title=Our Founding Yuppie|date=October 23, 2000|accessdate=August 21, 2010|publisher=''The Weekly Standard''|authorlink=David Brooks (journalist)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent article in ''Details'' proclaimed &quot;The Return of the Yuppie&quot;, stating that &quot;the yuppie of 1986 and the yuppie of 2006 are so similar as to be indistinguishable&quot; and &quot;[h]e’s a shape-shifter... he finds ways to reenter the American psyche.&quot;&lt;ref name=details&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.details.com/culture-trends/critical-eye/200611/the-return-of-the-yuppie?currentPage=1|publisher=''Details''|title=The Return of the Yuppie|first=Jeff|last=Gordinier|accessdate=August 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Victor Davis Hanson]] also recently wrote in ''National Review'' very critically of yuppies.&lt;ref name=VDH/&gt;

==Usage outside of the United States==
A September 2010 article in ''[[The Standard]]'' described the items on a typical [[Hong Kong]] resident's &quot;yuppie wish list&quot; based on a survey of 28 to 35 year olds. About 58% wanted to own their own home, 40% wanted to [[Investing|professionally invest]], and 28% wanted to become a boss.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=''[[The Standard]]''|date=September 8, 2010|url=http://www.thestandard.com.hk/news_detail.asp?pp_cat=11&amp;art_id=102699&amp;sid=29504212&amp;con_type=1|title=Homes, cash top fairy tales on yuppie wish list|first=Natalie|last=Wong}}&lt;/ref&gt; A September 2010 article in the ''New York Times'' defined as a hallmark of [[Russia]]n yuppie life adoption of [[yoga]] and other elements of [[Culture of India|Indian culture]] such as their [[Clothing in India|clothes]], [[Indian cuisine|food]], and furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/world/europe/15iht-moscow.html|title=Russians Embrace Yoga, if They Have the Money|date=September 14, 2010|title=''New York Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mexico]], the term &quot;yupi&quot; is a [[neologism]] for residents of metropolitan [[Mexico City]] known for having a modern white-collar economy. ''Yuppification'' has occurred in economic booming nations of [[China]], [[India]], [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Middle East]] and [[South Africa]] in the late 1990s and 2000s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

They also, contrary to yuppies, do not fashionize intellectuality, and can or can not be [[socially liberal]] (social divisions between liberals and conservatives, specially in the upper classes, makes much less sense in Brazil than in the Anglosphere). In the 2000s, some lower middle and middle middle class Brazilians from [[Greater São Paulo]] formed a new urban subculture also called ''playboy'' which is little to not related to the former. Non-urban young professionals in Brazil are called by the slang ''agroboy''.
