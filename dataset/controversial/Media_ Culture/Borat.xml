'''''Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan''''', often referred to simply as '''''Borat''''', and stylized '''''BORДT!''''' on the poster, is a 2006 [[mockumentary]] comedy film directed by [[Larry Charles]] and distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. The movie was written and produced by English comedian [[Sacha Baron Cohen]]. He also plays the title character, [[Borat Sagdiyev]], a fictitious [[Kazakhs|Kazakh]] journalist traveling through the United States recording real-life interactions with Americans. Much of the movie features unscripted vignettes of Borat interviewing and interacting with Americans, who believe he is a foreigner with little or no understanding of American customs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon&quot;&gt;Marchese, David and Paskin, Willa.

Retrieved on 2007-03-07.&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second of three films built around Baron Cohen's characters from ''[[Da Ali G Show]]'' (2002–2004). ''[[Ali G Indahouse]]'' (2002) featured a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] by Borat, and the third film, ''[[Brüno (film)|Brüno]]'', was released in 2009.

Despite a limited initial release in the United States, the film was a critical and commercial success. Baron Cohen won the [[64th Golden Globe Awards|2007 Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor: Musical or Comedy]], as Borat, while the film was nominated for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture - Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture]] in the same category.&lt;ref name=&quot;Globe&quot;&gt;[http://www.hfpa.org/nominations/index.html &quot;Nominations &amp; winners&quot;], ''[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]]'', 2006. Retrieved on 2007-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Borat'' was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Writing Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]] at the [[79th Academy Awards]].

Controversy surrounded the film even two years before its release. It was denounced for its protagonist's [[sexism]] and [[homophobia]] and, after the film's release, some cast members spoke against, and even sued, its creators. It was banned in all [[Arab world|Arab countries]] except [[Lebanon]],&lt;ref name=Guardian-01Dec06&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=The Guardian|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1961870,00.html |work=Guardian Unlimited Film|date=2006-12-01|title= Arab countries ban Borat|accessdate=2007-03-17 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Government of Russia|Russian government]] discouraged Russian cinemas from showing it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russiaban&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work= International Herald Tribune|publisher = New York Times|date=2006-11-09|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/11/09/news/borat.php|title=Moscow gives 'Borat' a thumb's down: Satirical film fails to get certification|accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on DVD March 5, 2007 (a day later in [[DVD region code|Region 1]] countries).

==Plot==
Kazakh television personality Borat Sagdiyev leaves [[Kazakhstan]] for the &quot;Greatest Country in the World,&quot; the &quot;[[United States|US and A]]&quot; to make a [[documentary]] at the behest of the Kazakh Ministry of Information. He leaves behind his wife Oksana and other inhabitants of his village including &quot;the town rapist&quot;, &quot;the town mechanic and abortionist&quot;, bringing along his producer Azamat Bagatov and a pet chicken.

In [[New York City|New York]], Borat sees an episode of ''[[Baywatch]]'' on television and [[Love at first sight|immediately falls in love with]]  [[Pamela Anderson]]. While interviewing and mocking a panel of [[feminist]]s, he learns her name and her residence in [[California]]. Borat is then informed by telegram that his wife has been killed by a bear. Delighted, he secretly resolves to make Anderson his new wife in California; Azamat is told they are going to California because &quot;[[Pearl Harbor]] is there. So is [[Texas]].&quot; Azamat is afraid of flying because of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], which he believes were [[9/11 conspiracy theories#Israel|the work of Jews]]. Borat, therefore, takes driving lessons and buys a dilapidated ice-cream truck for the journey.

During the trip, Borat acquires a ''Baywatch'' booklet at a [[yard sale]] and continues gathering footage for his documentary. He meets [[gay pride parade]] participants, politicians [[Alan Keyes]] and [[Bob Barr]], and [[African American]] youths. Borat is also interviewed on [[WAPT|live television]] and disrupts the weather report. Visiting a rodeo, Borat excites the crowd with [[jingoistic]] American remarks, but then sings a fictional [[Kazakhstani national anthem]] to the tune of &quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]&quot;, receiving a strong negative reaction. Staying at a [[bed-and-breakfast]], Borat and his producer are stunned to learn their hosts are Jewish. Fearful at the hands of their hosts, the two escape after throwing money toward cockroaches, believing they are their Jewish hosts transformed. While Azamat advises a return to New York, Borat attempts to buy a handgun to defend himself against Jews. When told he cannot buy a gun because he is not an American citizen, Borat purchases a bear for protection.

Borat seeks advice from an etiquette coach who suggests that Borat attends a private dinner at an eating club in the [[Southern United States|South]], at which he (unintentionally) insults or otherwise offends the other guests, and gets kicked out after he lets Luenell, an African-American prostitute, into the house and shows her to the table. Borat befriends Luenell, and she invites him into a relationship with her, but he kindly tells her that he is in love with someone else. Borat then visits an antique shop with a display of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] heritage items, breaking glass and [[Dishware|crockery]].

The journey is interrupted when Borat, just out of the bathtub, exits the bathroom of his hotel room and sees Azamat [[masturbation|masturbating]] over a picture of Pamela Anderson in the ''Baywatch'' book. Borat becomes enraged and reveals his real motive for traveling to California. Azamat becomes livid at Borat's deception, and the situation escalates into a fully nude brawl with homoerotic undertones,&lt;ref&gt;Rabin, Nathan. [http://www.avclub.com/content/node/54822 Borat: Cultural Learnings Of America For Make Benefit Glorious Nation Of Kazakhstan.] A.V. Club, 2006-11-2. Retrieved on 2007-04-09.&lt;/ref&gt; which spills out into the hallway, a crowded elevator, and ultimately into a packed convention ballroom. The two are finally separated by security guards.

As a result, Azamat abandons Borat, taking his passport, all of their [[money]], and their bear, whose head is later seen inside Azamat's motel refrigerator. Borat begins to [[hitchhiking|hitchhike]] to California, but is soon picked up by drunken [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] brothers from the [[University of South Carolina]]. On learning the reason for his trip, they show him the ''Pam and Tommy'' sex video, revealing that she is not the virgin he thought she was. After leaving the three students, Borat becomes despondent, burning the ''Baywatch'' booklet and, by mistake, his return [[ticket (admission)|ticket]] to Kazakhstan. He regains his faith after attending a [[United Pentecostal Church|United Pentecostal]] camp meeting, at which [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Chip Pickering]] and [[Supreme Court of Mississippi|Mississippi Supreme Court]] Chief Justice [[James W. Smith, Jr.]] are present. Borat learns to forgive Azamat and Pamela. He accompanies church members on a bus to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and disembarks to find Azamat dressed as [[Oliver Hardy]] (though Borat thinks that he is dressed as [[Adolf Hitler]]). The two reconcile and Azamat tells Borat where to find Pamela Anderson.

Borat finally comes face-to-face with Anderson at a book signing at a [[Virgin Megastores|Virgin Megastore]]. After showing Anderson his &quot;[[Bride kidnapping|traditional marriage sack]],&quot; Borat pursues her throughout the store in an attempt to abduct her until he is tackled and handcuffed by security guards. Afterwards, Borat marries Luenell, and returns to Kazakhstan with her. The final scene shows the changes that Borat's observations in America have brought to his village, including the apparent conversion of the people to [[Christianity]] (the Kazakh version of which includes [[crucifixion]] of Jews) and the introduction of computer-based technology, such as [[iPod]]s, laptop computers and a high-definition, [[LCD]] television.

The film plays out with a recapitulation of a mock 'Kazakhstan' national anthem glorifying the country's potassium resources and its prostitutes as being the &quot;cleanest in the region&quot;. The visual melange of Soviet-era photos are mixed with the real flag of Kazakhstan and, incongruously, the final frames show the portrait of [[Ilham Aliyev]], real life president of [[Azerbaijan]], a country that had not been otherwise referenced in the movie.

==Cast==
[[File:Borat in Cologne.jpg|right|thumb|Baron Cohen, in character as Borat, at the [[Cologne]] premiere of the film.]]
* [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] as [[Borat Sagdiyev]]: Borat is a fictional journalist from [[Kazakhstan]], distinguished by exaggeratedly strong [[misogyny]], [[anti-Semitism]] and [[antiziganism]], which is depicted as apparently the norm in his homeland. Borat was originally created as a character for ''[[Da Ali G Show]]'' and appeared in every episode of the show.
* [[Ken Davitian]] as Azamat Bagatov: The producer of Borat's documentary. Azamat was a new character created for the film. Davitian, as &quot;The fat guy from Borat&quot;, was included at number two on a list of &quot;The 100 Unsexiest Men&quot; by the ''[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|Boston Phoenix]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thephoenix.com/article_ektid37418.aspx The 100 unsexiest men 2007: 10–1.] The Boston Phoenix, 2007-04-14. Retrieved on 2007-05-02.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Luenell Campbell]] as Luenell the prostitute: Luenell is first seen when Borat calls her to come to the Southern dinner, the climax of his effective destruction of the event.
* [[Pamela Anderson]] as Herself: Pamela Anderson plays a central role in the film as the reason for the journalist's cross country journey. She also appears in person at the end of the film, in a botched abduction attempt by Borat for cultural &quot;marriage&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;postpam&quot;/&gt;

===Deleted scenes===
The DVD included several [[deleted scene]]s from the film, including Borat being questioned by police at a traffic stop, visiting an animal shelter to get a bear to protect him from Jews, getting a massage at a hotel, and visiting an American doctor. There is also a montage of scenes cut from the film, including Borat taking a job at [[Krystal (restaurant)|Krystal]] and taking part in a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[American Civil War reenactment|reenactment]]. The deleted scenes menu also includes an intentionally tedious supermarket sequence with an unusually patient supermarket owner (Borat repeatedly asks about each product in the cheese section of the store and the owner responds the same way: &quot;That's cheese&quot;), an actual local TV news report about Borat's rodeo singing, and a final &quot;happy ending&quot; scene about Borat appearing in a Kazakh show entitled &quot;''Sexydrownwatch''&quot;, a ''[[Baywatch]]'' clone that also starred Azamat, Luenell, and [[Alexandra Paul]].

A scene in which Borat was apparently imprisoned was also filmed but was removed under the threat of legal action by prison officials when they learned the &quot;documentary&quot; was a satire.&lt;ref name=&quot;prison&quot;&gt;Perry, Tony.

One of the film's writers, [[Dan Mazer]], confirmed, in an interview, that there was a scene filmed but cut, in which Borat observed the shooting of actual pornography with actress [[Brooke Banner]]. Mazer claimed the scene was deleted so as not to compete with the naked hotel-fight but hinted it might be included in future DVD releases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mazer&quot;&gt;[http://www.fantasymoguls.com/Video.aspx?bcpid=326858045&amp;bclid=323642767&amp;bctid=353579070 &quot;Porn Scene Cut from Borat&quot;], FantasyMoguls.com.

===Scaled-back U.S. release===
In late October 2006, less than two weeks before the film's debut, [[20th Century Fox]] scaled back its American release from about 2,000 to 800 cinemas after marketing-survey data showed unexpectedly poor levels of audience awareness, surprising industry professionals, who could not recall such a move being made so close to a film's release.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-412814/American-cinemas-close-doors-new-Borat-movie.html |work=[[Daily Mail]]|date=2006-10-26|title=American cinemas close doors on new Borat movie|accessdate=2011-07-17 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this move, the film opened at number one in the box office, maintaining first place for two weeks straight. The film earned more in the second week ($28,269,900) than in the first ($26,455,463), due to an expansion onto 2,566 screens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0443453/business |work=[[IMDB]]|title=Box Office and Business for Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan|accessdate=2007-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatrical release===
''Borat'' had its public release on November 1, 2006, in [[Belgium]], and by November 3, 2006, it had opened in the United States and Canada as well as 14 European countries. Upon its release it was a massive hit, taking in US$26.4 million in its opening weekend, the highest ever in the United States and Canada for a film released in fewer than 1,000 cinemas&lt;ref name=numberone/&gt; until ''[[Hannah Montana &amp; Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert]]'' in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;hannah&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=hannahmontanaconcert.htm|title=Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert Tour (2008)&amp;nbsp;– Weekend Box Office Results|date=2008-02-03|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, its opening day (approximately $9.2 million)&lt;ref name=&quot;boratday&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=daily&amp;id=borat.htm|title=Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan (2006)&amp;nbsp;– Daily Box Office Results|date=2006-11-04|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; was larger than that of the ''Hannah Montana'' concert (approximately $8.6 million),&lt;ref name=&quot;hannahday&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=daily&amp;id=hannahmontanaconcert.htm|title=Hannah Montana/Miley Cyrus: Best of Both Worlds Concert Tour (2008)&amp;nbsp;– Daily Box Office Results|date=2008-02-02|accessdate=2009-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving ''Borat'' with the record of the highest opening day gross for a film released in fewer than 1,000 cinemas.

==Reception==
===Critical===
''Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan'' was well received by critics. In an article about the changing face of comedy, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' said that it &quot;may be the funniest film in a decade&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last = Hirschorn | first = Michael | title = Thank You, YouTube: DIY video is making merely professional television seem stodgy, slow, and hopelessly last century | journal = [[The Atlantic Monthly]] |month= November | year= 2006 | page = 147}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Medved]] gave it 3.5 out of 4 stars, calling it &quot;...simultaneously hilarious and cringe-inducing, full of ingenious bits that you'll want to describe to your friends and then laugh all over again when you do.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://images.michaelmedved.com/images/pdf/borat.doc Borat].

By posting scenes from the film on YouTube, Borat was also exposed to viral communication.

Before being considered for appearance in the film, all potential participants were required to sign long [[Legal release|release]] forms agreeing not to take legal action for any [[Defamation|defamation of character]] or [[fraud]] carried out during the film's production.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} The usual disclaimer included at the end of the film's credits, stating that all characters in the film were fictitious, also noted that &quot;No real person depicted or appearing in the film has sponsored or otherwise endorsed its contents.&quot;

After the film's release, Dharma Arthur, a news producer for [[WAPT-TV]] in [[Jackson, Mississippi]], wrote a letter to ''Newsweek'' saying that Borat's appearance on the station had led to her losing her job: &quot;Because of him, my boss lost faith in my abilities and second-guessed everything I did thereafter … How upsetting that a man who leaves so much harm in his path is lauded as a comedic genius.&quot; Although Arthur has said she was fired from the show, she told the AP that she left the station.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, Erin (November 13, 2006), [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/13/AR2006111300329.html 'Borat' Victims Upset at Being Duped], ''washingtonpost.com''&lt;/ref&gt; She claims to have checked a public relations website that Borat's producers gave her before booking him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,226960,00.html | title=Dharma and … Borat?

Another lawsuit was filed by a South Carolina resident who claimed to have been accosted by Baron Cohen (as Borat) in the bathroom at a restaurant in downtown [[Columbia, South Carolina|Columbia]], with the actor allegedly making comments regarding the individual's genitals, without signing any legal waiver. The lawsuit also sought to have the footage excluded from any DVD releases and removed from Internet video sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= S.C. man sues after deleted ''Borat'' bathroom scene appears on cable, Internet|url= http://www.jacksonville.com/apnews/stories/121206/D8LVEVMG1.shtml|work= Florida Times-Union|agency= Associated Press|date= 2006-12-12|accessdate=2007-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonian]] [[Romani people|Romani]] singer [[Esma Redžepova]] sued the film's producers, seeking €800,000 because the film used her song &quot;Chaje Šukarije&quot; without her permission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/macedonian/news/story/2006/12/061207_borat.shtml Можна нова тужба за Борат].

Retrieved on 2007-3-19.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Redžepova won a €26,000 compensation, since it turned out that Cohen got permission from her production house to use the song, which she was not notified about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.makfax.com.mk/en-Us/Details.aspx?itemID=7503 |title=Esma wins lawsuit against Sacha Kohen|publisher=makfax.com.mk|date=2009-07-29| unused_data= Retrieved on 2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lawsuit was launched by Felix Cedeno, who wanted $2.25 million from [[20th Century Fox]], claiming they invaded his privacy and needed permission to use his image. The 31-year-old was riding the subway home to the South Bronx when Sacha Baron Cohen let a live hen out of his suitcase, causing chaos in the subway car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2007/07/11/5519/writs_go_crackers |title=Writs go crackers: Borat sued yet again|publisher=Chortle.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baltimore resident Michael Psenicska sought more than $100,000 in damages from Baron Cohen, 20th Century Fox and other parties. Psenicska, a high school mathematics teacher who also owns a driving school, was reportedly paid $500 in cash to give Baron Cohen's bogus Kazakh journalist a driving lesson. In his action, filed in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan, the driving instructor said he had been told the film was a &quot;documentary about the integration of foreign people into the American way of life&quot; and had he known the film's true nature, he said, he would have never participated. Psenicska said he was entitled to damages because the defendants used images of him to advertise the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7128409.stm | title = Borat's driving instructor sues | publisher = BBC NEWS | date = 2007-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dismissed on September 9, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080910/ap_en_mo/borat_lawsuit_1 | title = Glorious NYC lawsuit ruling for 'Borat' filmmakers | publisher = Yahoo!

Jeffrey Lemerond, who was shown running and yelling, &quot;Go away&quot; as Borat attempted to hug strangers on a New York street, filed a legal case claiming his image was used in the film illegally, and that he suffered &quot;public ridicule, degradation and humiliation&quot; as a result. The case was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7327892.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; Judge dismisses Borat legal case |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-04-03 |accessdate=2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron Cohen reacted to these suits by noting, &quot;Some of the letters I get are quite unusual, like the one where the lawyer informed me I'm about to be sued for $100,000 and at the end says, 'P.S. Loved the movie. Can you sign a poster for my son Jeremy?'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kill&quot;/&gt;

===Criticism by Kazakhstan===
''Borat'' has had a history of controversy with the [[government of Kazakhstan]]. In 2005, following Borat's appearance at the [[MTV Movie Awards]], the country's Foreign Ministry threatened to sue Sacha Baron Cohen, and Borat's &quot;[[.kz|Kazakh-based]]&quot; website, www.borat.kz, was taken down.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, Buck.

Retrieved on 2007-03-08.&lt;/ref&gt; Kazakhstan also launched a multi-million dollar &quot;Heart of Eurasia&quot; campaign to counter the Borat effect; Baron Cohen replied by denouncing the campaign at an in-character press conference in front of the [[White House]] as the propaganda of the &quot;evil nitwits&quot; of [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Harper's]]|date=2007-10-04|url=http://www.harpers.org/sb-boratology-1159910621.html|title=A Recap From the World's Leading Boratologist|accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Uzbekistan is, throughout the film, referred to by Borat as his nation's leading problem—leaving aside the Jews.

The Central Asian distributor of 20th Century Fox, Gemini Films, complied with a Kazakh government request to not release the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russiaban&quot;/&gt;

The Kazakh tabloid ''Karavan'' declared ''Borat'' to be the best film of the year, having had a reviewer see the film at a screening in [[Vienna]]. The paper claimed that it was &quot;...certainly not an anti-Kazakh, anti-Romanian or anti-Semitic&quot; film but rather &quot;cruelly anti-American ... amazingly funny and sad at the same time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1952548,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=16 Birds get the best of Bond.] The Guardian, 2006-11-20. Retrieved on 2007-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Another favorable word came from Kazakh novelist [[Sapabek Asip-uly]], who suggested Baron Cohen be nominated for the annual award bestowed by the Kazakh Club of Art Patrons. In a letter published by the newspaper ''[[Vremya]]'', Asip-uly wrote, &quot;(Borat) has managed to spark an immense interest of the whole world in Kazakhstan—something our authorities could not do during the years of independence. If state officials completely lack a sense of humor, their country becomes a laughing stock.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Internet Movie Database|url=http://www.imdb.com/news/wenn/2006-11-27/#3|title=Cohen Nominated for Kazakh Award|accessdate=2006-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amazon.com|Amazon UK]] has also reported significant numbers of orders of ''Borat'' on DVD from Kazakhstan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/film/story/2007/03/12/borat-dvd-kazakhstan.html Borat DVD a top seller in Kazakhstan.] CBC Arts, 2007-03-12.

In March 2012, the parody national anthem from the film, which acclaims Kazakhstan for its high-quality potassium exports and having the second cleanest prostitutes in the region, was mistakenly played at the H.H. The Amir of Kuwait International Shooting Grand Prix in Kuwait. The Gold Winning medalist, Maria Dmitrienko, stood on the dais while the entire parody was played. The team complained, and the award ceremony was restaged. The incident apparently resulted from the wrong song being downloaded from the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/world-of-sport/borat-anthem-played-mistake-medals-ceremony-112050453.html|title=borat anthem played by mistake at medals ceremony}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-17491344 | work=BBC News | title=Borat anthem stuns Kazakh gold medallist in Kuwait | date=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations of racism===
The [[European Center for Antiziganism Research]], which works against negative attitudes toward [[Roma (Romani subgroup)|Roma]] people, filed a complaint&lt;ref name=&quot;Roma antiracism complaint&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title=Presse Erkl€ärung|publisher=[[European Center for Antiziganism Research]]|date=2006-10-17 |url=http://www.ezaf.org/Borat.pdf|format=PDF|language=German|accessdate=2007-03-08|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with German prosecutors on October 18, 2006, based on Borat's references to [[Romani people|Gypsies]] in his film.

Before the release of the film, the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) released a statement expressing concern over Borat's characteristic [[anti-Semitism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/Mise_00/4898_00.htm Statement On The Comedy Of Sacha Baron Cohen, A.K.A.

==Soundtrack==
{{Main|Stereophonic Musical Listenings That Have Been Origin in Moving Film &quot;Borat: Cultural Learnings of America for Make Benefit Glorious Nation of Kazakhstan&quot;}}
The soundtrack for ''Borat'' was released on October 24, 2006, on [[iTunes Store]], and October 31, 2006 in shops. The album included music from the film, five tracks entitled &quot;Dialoguing excerpt from moviefilm&quot;, as well as the controversial anti-Semitic song &quot;[[In My Country There Is Problem]]&quot; from ''Da Ali G Show''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spin.com/features/news/2006/10/061012_borat/ Don't Throw 'Borat' Soundtrack Down the Well.] SPIN.com, 2006-10-12. Retrieved on 2007-03-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[folk music]] included in the soundtrack has no connection to the authentic [[music of Kazakhstan]]. The album features songs by [[Roma music|Gypsy]] and Balkan artists (mostly [[Emir Kusturica]] and [[Goran Bregovic]]) and includes music by [[Erran Baron Cohen]], founding member of [[ZOHAR Sound System]] and brother of ''Borat'' star Sacha Baron Cohen, as well as songs sung by Sacha Baron Cohen himself in character as Borat.

The [[DVD region code|Region 2 DVD]] was released March 5, 2007, with the [[DVD region code|Region 1]] release the following day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.movieweb.com/dvd/news/59/16859.php Borat DVD to Be Released As Is on March 6.] Movieweb.com, 2007-01-09.

Retrieved on 2007-03-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Special features include [[deleted scenes]], faux advertisements for the soundtrack album, and a complete [[Russian language]] translation audio track using a professional dubbing cast, along with the English, French, and Spanish language tracks common on Region 1 . There is also a choice of Hebrew as well, but this is merely a joke. Choosing the Hebrew language option results in a warning screen reading &quot;You have been trapped, Jew!&quot; which warns the viewer not to change his shape and keep his claws where they can be seen, again playing on the anti-Semitism supposedly prevalent in Borat's version of Kazakhstan. It also includes footage of Borat's publicity tour for the film, with Baron Cohen in character as Borat on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'', ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', the [[Toronto International Film Festival]], and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Also, there is a section of [[WSLS-TV|a news story from Virginia]], about Borat and the rodeo he visited with the Rodeo owner (Bobby Rowe) being interviewed.

As a play on the [[copyright infringement]] common in the former [[Soviet Union]], the packaging of the Region 1 (United States/Canada), 2 (Europe/Japan/South Africa/Middle East) and 4 (Latin America/Oceania) editions mimics a foreign [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] DVD. The slipcover is in English but the case itself has all-Cyrillic text (a majority of which is in legitimate Russian, not faux Cyrillic) and is made to look poorly photocopied. The disc itself is made to look like a &quot;Demorez&quot; [[DVD-R]] (a parody of [[Memorex]], with the similar slogan &quot;Is life? No. Demorez.&quot;) with the word &quot;BOЯAT&quot; appearing to be crudely written in marker and the &quot;R&quot; [[Ya (Cyrillic)|written backwards]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dvd&quot;&gt;Couture, John. [http://videoeta.com/news/2236 'Borat' DVD gets pirated… NOT!] VideoETA.com, 2007-03-02. Retrieved on 2007-03-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Universal Media Disc|UMD]] version is similar to the DVD, even being labelled a &quot;UMD-R&quot; (which do not exist). Even the [[20th Century Fox|Fox]] in-cover advertising is written in broken English that appears poorly printed, indicating that there are &quot;More movie discs available from US&amp;A&quot; and &quot;Also legal to own in Kazakhstan&quot;.

There are further jokes within the DVD itself. The menus are styled as a worn, static-laden film on an erratically functioning projector, with more Cyrillic writing accompanied by translations in broken English. The DVD is described as a &quot;prerecorded moviedisc for purpose domestic viewing of moviefilm&quot; and the viewer is warned that &quot;selling piratings of this moviedisc will result in punishment by [[crushing (execution)|crushing]].&quot; The DVD's collection of [[trailer (film)|trailers]] promises these films are &quot;coming Kazakhstan in 2028.&quot;

By April 2007, the DVD had sold over 3.5 million copies, totalling more than $55 million in sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2006/BORAT-DVD.php Sales of Borat movie DVD]&lt;/ref&gt;

While a [[Blu-ray Disc]] release date for the U.S. has yet to be announced, it has been released on Blu-ray in Germany, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, Brazil, Holland, Finland, Denmark, and Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blu-ray.com/search/?quicksearch=1&amp;quicksearch_country=US&amp;quicksearch_keyword=Borat&amp;section=bluraymovies ''Borat'' on Blu-ray] Blu-ray.com.
