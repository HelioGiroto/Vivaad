'''Twitter''' is an online [[social networking service]] and [[microblogging]] service that enables its users to send and read text-based messages of up to 140 [[character (computing)|character]]s, known as &quot;'''tweets'''&quot;.

It was created in March 2006 by [[Jack Dorsey]] and launched that July. The service rapidly gained worldwide popularity, with over [[List of virtual communities with more than 100 million users|500 million active]] users as of 2012, generating over 340 million tweets daily and handling over 1.6 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] [[Web search query|search queries]] per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Twitter_500&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineering.twitter.com/2011/05/engineering-behind-twitters-new-search.html |author=Twitter Search Team|title=The Engineering Behind Twitter’s New Search Experience |date=May 31, 2011 |accessdate=June 10, 2011 |work=Twitter Engineering Blog |publisher=Twitter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.news.yahoo.com/s/mashable/20110716/tc_mashable/reaching_200_million_accounts_twitters_explosive_growth_infographic ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its launch, Twitter has become one of the top 10 most visited websites on the Internet, and has been described as &quot;the [[SMS]] of the [[Internet]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;alexa&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/swine-flu%5Cs-tweet-tweet-causes-online-flutter/356604/ |title=Swine Flu's Tweet Tweet Causes Online Flutter |date=April 29, 2009 |first=Leslie |last=D'Monte |work=[[Business Standard]] |quote=Also known as the 'SMS of the internet', Twitter is a free social networking and micro-blogging service |accessdate=February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unregistered users can read tweets, while registered users can post tweets through the website interface, SMS, or a range of [[Application software|apps]] for mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.twitter.com/groups/34-apps-sms-and-mobile/topics/153-twitter-via-sms/articles/14014-twitter-via-sms-faq# Twitter via SMS FAQ] Retrieved April 13, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Creation and initial reaction===
[[File:Twttr sketch-Dorsey-2006.jpg|upright|thumb|A blueprint sketch, c. 2006, by [[Jack Dorsey]], envisioning an [[SMS]]-based [[social network]].]]
Twitter's origins lie in a &quot;daylong brainstorming session&quot; held by board members of the [[podcast]]ing company [[Odeo]]. Dorsey, then an undergraduate student at [[New York University]], introduced the idea of an individual using an SMS service to communicate with a small group.&lt;ref&gt;{{registration required|date=February 2011}} {{cite news|author=Miller, Claire Cain|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/31/technology/31ev.html|title=Why Twitter's C.E.O.

The developers initially considered &quot;10958&quot; as a short code, but later changed it to &quot;40404&quot; for &quot;ease of use and memorability.&quot;&lt;ref name=HowTwitterWasBorn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.140characters.com/2009/01/30/how-twitter-was-born/|title=How Twitter Was Born|work=140 Characters – A Style Guide for the Short Form|publisher=140 Characters|date=January 30, 2009|first=Dom|last=Sagolla|accessdate=February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Work on the project started on March 21, 2006, when Dorsey published the first Twitter message at 9:50 PM [[Pacific Standard Time]] (PST): &quot;just setting up my twttr&quot;.&lt;ref name=Dorsey2006&gt;{{cite web|title=just setting up my twttr |url=http://twitter.com/jack/status/20 |date=March 21, 2006 |author=Dorsey, Jack |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=February 4, 2011 |authorlink=Jack Dorsey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;...we came across the word 'twitter', and it was just perfect. The definition was 'a short burst of inconsequential information,' and 'chirps from birds'. And that's exactly what the product was.&quot; – [[Jack Dorsey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/technology/2009/02/twitter-creator.html |title=Twitter Creator Jack Dorsey Illuminates the Site's Founding Document|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 18, 2009|first=David|last=Sano|accessdate=June 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first Twitter prototype was used as an internal service for Odeo employees and the full version was introduced publicly on July 15, 2006.&lt;ref name=launch&gt;{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Arrington |url=http://techcrunch.com/2006/07/15/is-twttr-interesting/ |title=Odeo Releases Twttr |work=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=July 15, 2006 |accessdate=September 18, 2010 |authorlink=Michael Arrington}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2006, [[Biz Stone]], [[Evan Williams (entrepreneur)|Evan Williams]], Dorsey, and other members of Odeo formed Obvious Corporation and acquired Odeo and all of its assets &amp;ndash; including Odeo.com and Twitter.com &amp;ndash; from the investors and shareholders.&lt;ref name='Odeo RIP'&gt;{{Cite news| first=Om | last=Malik | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Odeo RIP, Hello Obvious Corp | date=October 25, 2006 |url=http://gigaom.com/2006/10/25/odeo-rip-hello-obvious-corp/ |work=[[GigaOM]] |accessdate=June 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams fired Glass who was silent about his part in Twitter's startup until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Madrigal, Alexis|title=Twitter's Fifth Beatle Tells His Side of the Story|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2011/04/twitters-fifth-beatle-tells-his-side-of-the-story/237326/|date=April 14, 2011|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter spun off into its own company in April 2007.&lt;ref name='Dorsey Interview'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyanchor.com/2009/02/12/a-conversation-with-twitter-co-founder-jack-dorsey/ |title=A Conversation with Twitter Co-Founder Jack Dorsey |accessdate=February 12, 2009 |last=Lennon |first=Andrew |work=[[The Daily Anchor]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[tipping point (sociology)|tipping point]] for Twitter's popularity was the 2007 [[South by Southwest Interactive]] (SXSWi) conference. During the event, [[Twitter usage]] increased from 20,000&amp;nbsp;tweets per day to 60,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/tech/next-big-thing/twitter-blows-up-at-sxsw-conference-243634.php |title=Twitter Blows Up at SXSW Conference |last=Douglas |first=Nick |date=March 12, 2007 |work=[[Gawker]] |accessdate=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Twitter people cleverly placed two 60-inch plasma screens in the conference hallways, exclusively streaming Twitter messages,&quot; remarked ''[[Newsweek]]'''s [[Steven Levy]]. &quot;Hundreds of conference-goers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters. Panelists and speakers mentioned the service, and the bloggers in attendance touted it.&quot;&lt;ref name='Newsweek Tipping Point'&gt;{{Cite news|author=Levy, Steven|title=Twitter: Is Brevity The Next Big Thing? |date=April 30, 2007 |url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/35289 |work=[[Newsweek]] |accessdate=February 4, 2011 |authorlink=Steven Levy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reaction at the conference was highly positive. Blogger Scott Beale said that Twitter &quot;absolutely rul''[ed]''&quot; SXSWi. Social software researcher [[danah boyd]] said Twitter &quot;own''[ed]''&quot; the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17939_109-9696264-2.html |title=To Twitter or Dodgeball at SXSW? |accessdate=February 4, 2011 |first=Daniel |last=Terdiman |authorlink=Daniel Terdiman |date=March 10, 2007 |work=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter staff received the festival's Web Award prize with the remark &quot;we'd like to thank you in 140&amp;nbsp;characters or less.

The first unassisted off-Earth Twitter message was posted from the [[International Space Station]] by [[NASA]] [[astronaut]] [[Timothy Creamer|T. J.

Retrieved February 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; By late November 2010, an average of a dozen updates per day were posted on the astronauts' communal account, @NASA_Astronauts. NASA has also hosted over 25 [[NASA Tweetup|&quot;tweetups&quot;]], events that provide guests with VIP access to NASA facilities and speakers with the goal of leveraging participants' social networks to further the outreach goals of NASA.

In August 2010, the company appointed Adam Bain as President of Revenue from [[News Corp.]]'s [[News Corp.

===Growth===
The company experienced rapid growth. It had 400,000 tweets posted per quarter in 2007. This grew to 100 million tweets posted per quarter in 2008. In February 2010, Twitter users were sending 50 million tweets per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/7297541/Twitter-users-send-50-million-tweets-per-day.html | work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | title=Twitter Users Send 50 Million Tweets Per Day – Almost 600 Tweets Are Sent Every Second Through the Microblogging Site, According to Its Own Metrics | first=Claudine | last=Beaumont | date=February 23, 2010|accessdate=February 7, 2011 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; By March 2010, the company recorded over 70,000 registered applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=[[Staff writer]]|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/digital/2010/03/twitter-registered-created|work=[[New Statesman]]|title=Twitter Registers 1,500 Per Cent Growth in Users|date=March 4, 2010|accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2010, about 65 million tweets were posted each day, equaling about 750 tweets sent each second, according to Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Garrett, Sean|title=Big Goals, Big Game, Big Records|url=http://blog.twitter.com/2010/06/big-goals-big-game-big-records.html|publisher=''Twitter Blog'' ([[blog]] of Twitter)|accessdate=February 7, 2011|date=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of March 2011, that was about 140 million tweets posted daily.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.twitter.com/2011/03/numbers.html |title=Twitter Blog: #numbers |publisher=Blog.twitter.com |date=2011-03-14 |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As noted on [[Compete.com]], Twitter moved up to the third-highest-ranking [[social networking]] site in January 2009 from its previous rank of twenty-second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kazeniac, Andy| url=http://blog.compete.com/2009/02/09/facebook-myspace-twitter-social-network/ |title=Social Networks: Facebook Takes Over Top Spot, Twitter Climbs |publisher=''Compete Pulse'' ([[blog]] of [[compete.com]]) |date=February 9, 2009 |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twitter's usage spikes during prominent events. For example, a record was set during the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] when fans wrote 2,940 tweets per second in the thirty-second period after Japan scored against [[Cameroon]] on June 14, 2010. The record was broken again when 3,085 tweets per second were posted after the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]' victory in the [[2010 NBA Finals]] on June 17, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Miller|first=Claire Cain|title=Sports Fans Break Records on Twitter|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/06/18/sports-fans-break-records-on-twitter/|publisher=''Bits'' ([[blog]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'')|accessdate=February 7, 2011|date=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again at the close of Japan's victory over Denmark in the World Cup when users published 3,283 tweets per second.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Van Grove, Jennifer|url=http://mashable.com/2010/06/25/tps-record/|title=Twitter Sets New Record: 3,283 Tweets Per Second|work=[[Mashable]]|accessdate=February 7, 2011|date=June 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current record was set during the [[2011 FIFA Women's World Cup Final]] between Japan and the United States, when 7,196 tweets per second were published.&lt;ref name=&quot;FIFA Women's World Cup Final record&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/6779582/women-world-cup-final-breaks-twitter-record |title=Women's World Cup Final breaks Twitter record |publisher=''[[ESPN (United States)|ESPN]]'' |date=2011-07-18 |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; When American singer [[Michael Jackson]] died on June 25, 2009, Twitter servers crashed after users were updating their status to include the words &quot;Michael Jackson&quot; at a rate of 100,000 tweets per hour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shiels |first=Maggie |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8120324.stm |title=Web Slows After Jackson's Death |work=[[BBC News]] |date=June 26, 2009 |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twitter acquired application developer Atebits on April 11, 2010. Atebits had developed the [[Apple Design Award]]-winning Twitter client [[Tweetie]] for the [[Macintosh|Mac]] and [[iPhone]]. The application, now called &quot;Twitter&quot; and distributed free of charge, is the official Twitter client for the iPhone, [[iPad]] and Mac.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Miller, Claire Cain|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/09/twitter-acquires-atebits-maker-of-tweetie/|title=Twitter Acquires Atebits, Maker of Tweetie |date= April 11, 2010|accessdate=February 7, 2011 | publisher=''Bits'' ([[blog]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'')}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From September through October 2010, the company began rolling out &quot;New Twitter&quot;, an entirely revamped edition of twitter.com. Changes included the ability to see pictures and videos without leaving Twitter itself by clicking on individual tweets which contain links to images and clips from a variety of supported websites including [[YouTube]] and [[Flickr]], and a complete overhaul of the interface, which shifted links such as '@mentions' and 'Retweets' above the Twitter stream, while 'Messages' and 'Log Out' became accessible via a black bar at the very top of twitter.com. As of November 1, 2010, the company confirmed that the &quot;New Twitter experience&quot; had been rolled out to all users.

On April 5, 2011, Twitter tested a new homepage and phased out the &quot;Old Twitter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/04/05/new-twitter-homepage_n_845110.html |title=Twitter Users Report Twitter.com Has A New Homepage (SCREENSHOTS) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=2011-05-04 |accessdate=2011-05-22 |first=Dean |last=Praetorius}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a glitch came about after the page was launched, so the previous &quot;retro&quot; homepage was still in use until the issues were resolved; the new homepage was reintroduced on April 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunn |first=John E |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/224410/twitter_delays_homepage_revamp_after_service_glitch.html |title=Twitter Delays Homepage Revamp After Service Glitch |publisher=PCWorld |date=2011-04-06 |accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webpronews.com/new-twitter-homepage-2011-04|title=New Twitter Homepage Launched|first=Chris|last=Crum|date=April 20, 2011|accessdate=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 8, 2011, Twitter overhauled its website once more to feature the &quot;Fly&quot; design, which the service says is easier for new users to follow and promotes advertising. In addition to the ''Home'' tab, the ''Connect'' and ''Discover'' tabs were introduced along with a redesigned profile and timeline of Tweets. The site's layout has been compared to that of [[Facebook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fly.twitter.com/ |title=Twitter: Yours to discover |publisher=Fly.twitter.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Twitter / YouTube |url=http://www.foxnews.com/scitech/2011/12/09/what-need-to-know-about-new-twitter/?test=faces |title=Twitter 2.0: Everything You Need To Know About The New Changes |publisher=Fox News |date=2010-04-07 |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 21, 2012, it was announced that Twitter and Yandex agreed to a partnership. Yandex, a Russian search engine, finds value within the partnership due to Twitter’s real time news feeds. Twitter’s director of business development explained that it is important to have Twitter content where Twitter users go.&lt;ref&gt;Prodhan Georgina February 21, 2012. “Twitter partners with Yandex for real-time search.” http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/02/21/twitter-yandex-idUSL5E8DK89H20120221&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 21, 2012, Twitter celebrated its sixth birthday while also announcing that it has 140 million users and sees 340 million tweets per day. The number of users is up 40% from their September 2011 number, which was said to have been at 100 million at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, Todd.

In April 2012, Twitter announced that it was opening an office in [[Detroit]], with the aim of working with automotive brands and advertising agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/04/twitter-detroit-idUSL2E8F47G020120404 |title=Twitter heads to Motown to be closer to automakers |publisher=Reuters |date=2012-04-04 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter also expanded its office in [[Dublin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/business/technology/twitter-to-create-12-jobs-as-it-scales-up-irish-operations-3070098.html|title=Twitter to create 12 jobs as it scales up Irish operations |publisher=Irish Independent |date=2012-04-04 |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 2012, Twitter announced the purchase of Washington, D.C. based web design agency Nclud. Upon the purchase, Nclud's co-founder and director of brand experience, Martin Ringlein, was named Twitter's new design manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techcrunch.com/2012/06/04/twitter-buys-design-agency-nclud-appoints-co-founder-twitters-new-design-manager/ |title=Updated: Twitter Buys IP From Design Agency Nclud, Appoints Co-Founder Its New Design Manager |first=Ingrid |last=Lunden |work=[[TechCrunch]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=June 4, 2012 |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 5, a modified logo was unveiled through the company blog, removing the text to showcase the slightly redesigned bird as the sole symbol of Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodriguez |first=Salvador |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/technology/la-fi-tn-twitter-new-bird-20120606,0,2138652.story |title=Twitter adopts new bird logo |publisher=latimes.com |date=2012-06-06 |accessdate=2012-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leadership==
As [[chief executive officer]], Dorsey saw the startup through two rounds of capital funding  by the [[venture capital]]ists who backed the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Miller, Claire Cain; Goel, Vindu|title=Twitter Sidelines One Founder and Promotes Another|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/10/16/ttwitter-sidelines-one-founder-and-promotes-another/#more-1642|date=October 16, 2008|publisher=''Bits'' ([[blog]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'')|accessdate=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 4, 2010, Williams announced that he was stepping down as CEO. [[Dick Costolo]], formerly Twitter's [[chief operating officer]], became CEO.

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', &quot;Mr. Dorsey and Mr. Costolo forged a close relationship&quot; when Williams was away.&lt;ref name=NYT20110328&gt;{{cite news|author=Miller, Claire Cain|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/28/twitter-founders-trade-places/|title=Two Twitter Founders Trade Places|date=March 28, 2011|work=The New York Times|accessdate=March 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[PC Magazine]]'', Williams was &quot;no longer involved in the day-to-day goings on at the company&quot;. He is focused on developing a new startup, but he became a member of Twitter's board of directors, and promised to &quot;help in any way I can&quot;.

Dorsey rejoined Twitter in March 2011, as executive chairman focusing on product development. His time is split with [[Square (payment service)|Square]] (where he is CEO), whose offices are within walking distance of Twitter's in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT20110328&quot;/&gt;

In September 2011, board members and investors [[Fred Wilson (financier)|Fred Wilson]] and Bijan Sabet resigned from Twitter's Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingsd.com/20110916/twitter-shakes-things-up-again-fred-wilson-bijan-sabet-leaving-board/ |title=Twitter Shakes Things Up Again: Fred Wilson, Bijan Sabet Leaving Board - Peter Kafka - Social |publisher=AllThingsD |date=2011-09-16 |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2012, Twitter announced it had hired Google executive Matt Derella, to become their new Director of Business Agency Development. &lt;ref&gt;[http://techcrunch.com/2012/10/22/twitter-poaches-former-google-exec-matt-derella-as-new-director-of-agency-business-development/ Olanoff, Drew. &quot;Twitter Poaches Former Google Exec Matt Derella As New Director Of Agency Business Development.&quot;] October 23, 2012.

==Logo==
Twitter has become internationally identifiable by its signature bird logo. The original logo was in use from its launch in March 2006 until September 2010. A slightly modified version succeeded the first style when the website underwent its first redesign.

On February 27, 2012, a tweet from an employee that works on the company's platform and API discussed the evolution of the &quot;Larry the Bird&quot; logo with Twitter's creative director and it was revealed that it was named after [[Larry Bird]] of the NBA's [[Boston Celtics]] fame. This detail had previously been confirmed when the Boston Celtics' director of interactive media asked Twitter co-founder Biz Stone about it in August 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nba-ball-dont-lie/twitter-logo-named-larry-bird-005145351.html |title=Twitter's Logo Is Named After Larry Bird=[[Yahoo!Sports]] |first=Eric |last=Freeman |date=August 2011 |accessdate=March 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 5, 2012, Twitter unveiled its third logo redesign, replacing Larry the Bird with an updated icon simply named as the &quot;Twitter Bird.&quot; As of this logo revision, the word &quot;Twitter&quot; and the lowercase letter &quot;t&quot; are no longer used, with the bird becoming the sole symbol for the company's branding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/06/06/tech/social-media/twitter-bird-logo/|title=Twitter's bird logo gets a makeover |first=Brandon |last=Griggs |publisher=CNN|date=June 7, 2012 |accessdate=June 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Douglas Bowman, designer of Twitter, the new logo resembles a [[Mountain Bluebird]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.quora.com/Birds/What-is-the-new-Twitter-bird-logos-species|title=|first=Douglas |last=Bowman |publisher=Quora|date=June 6, 2012 |accessdate=August 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tweets are publicly visible by default; however, senders can restrict message delivery to just their followers. Users can tweet via the Twitter website, compatible external applications (such as for [[smartphone]]s), or by [[SMS|Short Message Service]] (SMS) available in certain countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.twitter.com/entries/14226-how-to-find-your-twitter-short-long-code |title=Using Twitter with Your Phone |quote=We currently support 2-way (sending and receiving) Twitter SMS via short codes and 1-way (sending only) via long codes. |publisher=Twitter Support|accessdate=June 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the service is free, accessing it through SMS may incur [[Telecommunications service provider|phone service provider]] fees.{{fact|date=July 2012}}

Users may subscribe to other users' tweets&amp;nbsp;– this is known as ''following'' and subscribers are known as ''followers''&lt;ref name=&quot;lists1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Stone, Biz|url=http://blog.twitter.com/2009/10/theres-list-for-that.html |title=There's a List for That |publisher=blog.twitter.com |date=October 30, 2009 |accessdate=February 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''tweeps'' (Twitter + peeps).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Brown, Amanda|title=The tricky business of business tweeting|date=March 2, 2011|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/features/2011/0302/1224291133449.html|work=The Irish Times|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The users can also check the people who are un-subscribing them on Twitter better known as unfollowing via various services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://en.shawntimes.com/314/who-unfollowed-me/profile/ |title=Who Unfollowed Me : ShawnTimes Profile &amp;#124; The Free Social Media Directory |publisher=En.shawntimes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twitter has been compared to a web-based [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC) client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stutzman |first=Fred |title=The 12-Minute Definitive Guide to Twitter |url=http://dev.aol.com/article/2007/04/definitive-guide-to-twitter |date=April 11, 2007 |publisher=AOL Developer Network |accessdate=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' [[essay]], technology author [[Steven Berlin Johnson|Steven Johnson]] described the basic mechanics of Twitter as &quot;remarkably simple&quot;:&lt;ref name='twitterchangesthewaywelive'&gt;{{Cite news|author= Johnson, Steven | title=How Twitter Will Change the Way We Live | date=June 5, 2009 | url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,1902604,00.html | work =[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | accessdate = February 13, 2011 | authorlink= Steven Berlin Johnson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|As a social network, Twitter revolves around the principle of followers.

[[San Antonio]]-based market-research firm [[Pear Analytics]] analyzed 2,000 tweets (originating from the US and in English) over a two-week period in August 2009 from 11:00 AM to 5:00 PM (CST) and separated them into six categories:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| contribution=Twitter Study – August 2009| title=Twitter Study Reveals Interesting Results About Usage| editor=Ryan Kelly|  publisher=Pear Analytics| place=San Antonio, Texas|  date=August 12, 2009| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110715062407/www.pearanalytics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Twitter-Study-August-2009.pdf | url=http://www.pearanalytics.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/05/Twitter-Study-August-2009.pdf| format=PDF| archivedate=2011-07-15| postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social networking researcher [[danah boyd]] responded to the Pear Analytics survey by arguing that what the Pear researchers labelled &quot;pointless babble&quot; is better characterized as &quot;[[social grooming]]&quot; and/or &quot;peripheral awareness&quot; (which she explains as persons &quot;want[ing] to know what the people around them are thinking and doing and feeling, even when co-presence isn’t viable&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;boyd-social-grooming&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Danah Boyd |authorlink=Danah Boyd |title=Twitter: &quot;pointless babble&quot; or peripheral awareness + social grooming? |date=August 16, 2009 |url=http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2009/08/16/twitter_pointle.html| accessdate=September 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Messages====
Users can group posts together by topic or type by use of [[hashtag]]s – words or phrases prefixed with a &lt;code&gt;&quot;#&quot;&lt;/code&gt; sign. Similarly, the &lt;code&gt;&quot;@&quot;&lt;/code&gt; sign followed by a [[username]] is used for mentioning or replying to other users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/4698589/Twitter-how-to-set-up-your-account.html |title=Twitter: How To Set Up Your Account |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |first=Donald |last=Strachan |date=February 19, 2009 |accessdate=February 13, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2009, the &quot;Twitter Lists&quot; feature was added, making it possible for users to follow (as well as mention and reply to) ad-hoc lists of authors instead of individual authors.&lt;ref name=&quot;lists1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lists2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Staff writer]]|url=http://help.twitter.com/forums/10711/entries/76460 |title=Twitter Lists! |publisher=Support forum at help.twitter.com |date=undated |accessdate=February 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through SMS, users can communicate with Twitter through five [[gateway (telecommunications)|gateway]] numbers: [[short code]]s for the United States, Canada, India, New Zealand, and an [[Isle of Man]]-based number for international use.

The messages were initially set to a 140-character limit for compatibility with SMS messaging, introducing the shorthand notation and [[internet slang|slang commonly used in SMS]] messages. The 140-character limit has also increased the usage of [[URL shortening]] services such as [[bit.ly]], goo.gl, and tr.im, and content-hosting services, such as [[Twitpic]], memozu.com and [[NotePub]] to accommodate [[multimedia]] content and text longer than 140 characters. Twitter uses its own t.co domain for automatic shortening of all URLs posted on its website.&lt;ref name=twitterhelpshort&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Staff writer]]|date=undated|url=http://support.twitter.com/entries/109623 |title=About Twitter's Link Service &lt;http://t.co&gt; |publisher=Twitter Help Center (module of Twitter)| accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trending topics====
A word, phrase or topic that is tagged at a greater rate than other tags is said to be a ''trending topic''. Trending topics become popular either through a concerted effort by users or because of an event that prompts people to talk about one specific topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Bloggers back media against youth league| accessdate = 2010-04-03| url = http://www.journalism.co.za/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=3103&amp;Itemid=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; These topics help Twitter and their users to understand what is happening in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Top Twitter Trends of 2009| accessdate = 2010-04-03| url = http://blog.twitter.com/2009/12/top-twitter-trends-of-2009.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trending topics are sometimes the result of concerted efforts by fans of certain celebrities or cultural phenomena, particularly [[Lady Gaga]] (known as Monsters), [[Justin Bieber]] (Beliebers) and fans of the [[Twilight saga|Twilight]] (Twihards) and [[Harry Potter]] (Potterheads) novels. Twitter have altered the trend algorithm in the past to prevent manipulation of this type.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By:&amp;nbsp; Vicky Woollaston |url=http://www.webuser.co.uk/news/top-stories/492646/justin-bieber-fans-beat-twitter-block |title=Justin Bieber fans beat Twitter 'block' &amp;#124; Web User magazine |publisher=Webuser.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twitter's March 30, 2010 blog post announced that the hottest Twitter trending topics will scroll across the Twitter homepage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Tweaking the Twitter homepage| accessdate = 2010-04-03| url = http://blog.twitter.com/2010/03/tweaking-twitter-homepage.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users will also be able to find out how a specific topic became a trending topic.{{fact|date=July 2012}}

There have been controversies surrounding Twitter trending topics: Twitter has censored [[hashtags]] that other users found offensive. Twitter censored the #Thatsafrican&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = #Thatsafrican -- When Twitter Went Racist?| accessdate = 2010-04-03| url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/david-weiner/thatsafrican----when-twit_b_218673.html | work=Huffington Post| first=David| last=Weiner| date=June 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the  #thingsdarkiessay&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Thingsdarkiessay causes a Twitter storm | accessdate = 2012-01-11| url = http://www.iol.co.za/scitech/technology/news/thingsdarkiessay-causes-a-twitter-storm-1.909053 |publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|Independent Online]] |location=South Africa |date=2009-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; hashtags after users complained that they found the hashtags offensive.{{fact|date=July 2012}}

===Adding and following content===
There are numerous tools for adding content, monitoring content and conversations including Twitvid (video sharing),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-20113426-93/twitter-video-sharing-service-nabs-$6.5-million/ |title=Twitter video-sharing service nabs $6.5 million |first=Laura |last=Locke |work=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=September 29, 2011 |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TweetDeck]], [[Salesforce.com]], [[HootSuite]], and Twitterfeed. Fewer than half of tweets are posted using the web user interface with most users using third-party applications (based on analysis of 500 million tweets by Sysomos).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.sysomos.com/insidetwitter/clients| title= Inside Twitter Clients &amp;ndash; An Analysis of 500 Million Tweets | publisher=[[Sysomos]] | date=November 2009 | accessdate=August 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Verified accounts===
In June 2008, Twitter launched a verification program, allowing [[Celebrity|celebrities]] to get their accounts verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Twitter launches verification service to protect celebrities|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/twitter/5475445/Twitter-launches-verification-service-to-protect-celebrities.html|work=The Telegraph | location=London|first=Emma|last=Barnett|date=June 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally intended to help users verify which celebrity accounts were created by the celebrities themselves (and therefore are not fake), they have since been used to verify accounts of businesses and accounts for public figures who may not actually tweet but still wish to maintain control over the account that bears their name - for example, the [[Dalai Lama]].

===Authentication===
As of August 31, 2010, third-party Twitter applications are required to use [[OAuth]], an authentication method that does not require users to enter their password into the authenticating application. Previously, the OAuth authentication method was optional, it is now compulsory and the user-name/password authentication method has been made redundant and is no longer functional. Twitter stated that the move to OAuth will mean &quot;increased security and a better experience&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://blog.twitter.com/2010/08/twitter-applications-and-oauth.html| title= Twitter Applications and OAuth | publisher=Twitter | date=August 30, 2010 | accessdate=September 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twitter is mainly used by older adults who might not have used other social sites before Twitter, said [[Jeremiah Owyang]], an industry analyst studying social media. &quot;Adults are just catching up to what teens have been doing for years,&quot; he said.&lt;ref name='teensdonttweet'&gt;{{Cite news| first=Claire Cain | last=Miller | title=Who's Driving Twitter's Popularity?

According to a study by [[Sysomos]] in June 2009, women make up a slightly larger Twitter demographic than men — fifty-three percent over forty-seven percent. It also stated that five percent of users accounted for seventy-five percent of all activity, and that New York has the most Twitter users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cheng, Alex|coauthors=Evans, Mark| title=Inside Twitter&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; An In-Depth Look Inside the Twitter World| date=June 2009| url=http://www.sysomos.com/insidetwitter/|publisher=[[Sysomos]]| accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revenue sources===
In July 2009, some of Twitter's revenue and user growth documents were published on ''[[TechCrunch]]'' after being illegally obtained by [[Hacker Croll]]. The documents projected 2009 revenues of US$400,000 in the third quarter and US$4&amp;nbsp;million in the fourth quarter along with 25&amp;nbsp;million users by the end of the year.

On April 13, 2010, Twitter announced plans to offer paid [[advertising]] for companies that would be able to purchase &quot;promoted tweets&quot; to appear in selective search results on the Twitter website, similar to [[Adwords|Google Adwords']] advertising model. As of April 13, Twitter announced it had already signed up a number of companies wishing to advertise including [[Sony Pictures]], [[Red Bull]], [[Best Buy]], and [[Starbucks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/apr/13/twitter-advertising-google |work=[[The Guardian]] |title=Twitter Unveils 'Promoted Tweets' Ad Plan&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Twitter To Let Advertisers Pay for Tweets To Appear in Search Results |first=Charles |last=Arthur |date=April 13, 2010 | accessdate=February 23, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sara |last=Kimberley |url=http://www.mediaweek.co.uk/news/996226/Twitter-debuts-Promoted-Tweets-ad-platform/ |title=Twitter Debuts 'Promoted Tweets' Ad Platform |publisher=''[[MediaWeek]]'' (U.K. edition) |date=April 13, 2010 |accessdate=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To continue their advertising campaign, Twitter announced on March 20, 2012, that it would be bringing its promoted tweets to mobile devices. Twitter generated US$139.5 million in advertising sales during 2011 and expects this number to grow 86.3% to US$259.9 million in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/2012/03/20/twitter-promoted-tweets-mobile/ mashable.com]; Wasserman, Todd.

As of April 6, 2011, Twitter engineers confirmed they had switched away from their Ruby on Rails search-stack, to a [[Java (programming language)|Java]] server they call Blender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://engineering.twitter.com/2011/04/twitter-search-is-now-3x-faster_1656.html |title=Twitter Search Is Now 3x Faster|work=[[Blogger (service)|Blogger]] |first=Lee |last=Gomes |date=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From spring 2007 to 2008 the messages were handled by a Ruby [[persistent data structure|persistent]] queue server called [[Starling (software)|Starling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=January 11, 2009 |url=http://dev.twitter.com/2008/01/announcing-starling.html |title=Announcing Starling |publisher=Twitter |date=January 16, 2008 |last=Payne |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080120141113/http://dev.twitter.com/2008/01/announcing-starling.html|archivedate=January 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but since 2009 implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/twitter_on_scala.html |title=Twitter on Scala |date=April 3, 2009 |first=Bill |last=Venners |publisher=Artima Developer |accessdate=June 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service's [[application programming interface]] (API) allows other [[web service]]s and applications to integrate with Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 8, 2008 |url=http://groups.google.com/group/twitter-development-talk/web/api-documentation |title=API Documentation |publisher=[[Google Groups]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apiwiki.twitter.com/ |title=Twitter API Wiki / FrontPage |publisher=Apiwiki.twitter.com |date= |accessdate=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Individual tweets are registered under unique IDs using software called [[snowflake (software)|snowflake]] and geolocation data is added using 'Rockdove'. The URL shortner ''t.co'' then checks for a spam link and shortens the URL. The tweets are stored in a [[MySQL]] database using [[Gizzard (software)|Gizzard]] and acknowledged to users as having been sent. They are then sent to search engines via the [[Firehose (software)|Firehose]] API. The process itself is managed by [[FlockDB]] and takes an average of {{nowrap|350 ms}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;zdnet vaughannichols 2012&quot; /&gt;

===Interface===
On April 30, 2009, Twitter adjusted its web interface, adding a search bar and a sidebar of &quot;[[trending topic]]s&quot; — the most common phrases appearing in messages. [[Biz Stone]] explains that all messages are instantly [[Index (search engine)|indexed]] and that &quot;with this newly launched feature, Twitter has become something unexpectedly important – a discovery engine for finding out what is happening right now.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=May 7, 2008 |url=http://blog.twitter.com/2009/04/twitter-search-for-everyone.html |title= Twitter Search for Everyone!  |publisher=Twitter |date=April 30, 2009|last=Stone|first=Biz|authorlink=Biz Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2012, Twitter became available in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Farsi]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Urdu]], the first right-to-left language versions of the site. About 13,000 volunteers helped with translating the menu options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Twitter Arabic, Farsi, Hebrew and Urdu version launch| date=7 March 2012|accessdate=7 March 2012| publisher=BBC News | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-17286684 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, beta support for [[Basque language|Basque]], [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Greek language|Greek]] was added, making the site available in 33 different languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =Twitter Now Available in Basque, Czech, Greek| date=6 August 2012|accessdate=7 August 2012| publisher=Pcmag.com | url =http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2408123,00.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy and security===
Twitter messages are public but users can also send private messages.&lt;ref name=Rushe /&gt; Twitter collects [[personally identifiable information]] about its users and shares it with third parties. The service reserves the right to sell this information as an asset if the company changes hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter Privacy Policy |url=http://twitter.com/privacy/ |date=May 14, 2007 |publisher=Twitter |accessdate=March 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Twitter displays no advertising, advertisers can [[behavioral targeting|target]] users based on their history of tweets and may quote tweets in ads&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hansell |first=Saul |title=Advertisers Are Watching Your Every Tweet |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/07/16/advertisers-are-watching-your-every-tweet/ |date=July 16, 2009 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=July 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed specifically to the user.

A security vulnerability was reported on April 7, 2007, by Nitesh Dhanjani and Rujith. Since Twitter used the [[Telephone number|phone number]] of the sender of an [[SMS]] message as authentication, malicious users could update someone else's status page by using [[SMS spoofing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmonkey.com/2007/04/twitter_vulnerability_spoof_caller_id_to_take_over_any_account/ |title=Twitter Vulnerability: Spoof Caller ID To Take Over Any Account |first=Scott |last=Gilbertson |publisher=[[Webmonkey]] |date=June 11, 2007 |accessdate=February 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vulnerability could be used if the spoofer knew the phone number registered to their victim's account. Within a few weeks of this discovery Twitter introduced an optional [[personal identification number]] (PIN) that its users could use to authenticate their SMS-originating messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/03/06/twitter_sms_spoofing_risk/|title=Twitter SMS Spoofing Still Undead |first=John |last=Leyden |work=[[The Register]] |date=March 6, 2009| accessdate=June 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 5, 2009, 33&amp;nbsp;high-profile Twitter accounts were compromised after a Twitter administrator's password was guessed by a [[dictionary attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Stone | first=Biz |authorlink=Biz Stone | title=Monday Morning Madness | date=January 5, 2009 | url=http://blog.twitter.com/2009/01/monday-morning-madness.html | accessdate=June 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falsified tweets — including sexually explicit and drug-related messages — were sent from these accounts.&lt;ref name=&quot;washtimes20090105&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Obama's Twitter Site Hacked? | date=January 5, 2009 | url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jan/05/obamas-twitter-site-hacked/ | work = [[The Washington Times]] | accessdate = January 5, 2009 | first=Christina|last=Bellantoni|coauthors=Stephen Dinan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twitter launched the [[Beta version#Beta|beta version]] of their &quot;Verified Accounts&quot; service on June 11, 2009, allowing famous or notable people to announce their Twitter account name. The home pages of these accounts display a badge indicating their status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-10263759-36.html |title=Twitter Power Players Get Shiny 'Verified' Badges |first=Caroline |last=McCarthy |work=[[CNET]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, a bug was discovered by [[İnci Sözlük]], involving users that allowed Twitter users to force others to follow them without the other users' consent or knowledge. For example, comedian [[Conan O'Brien]]'s account, which had been set to follow only one person, was changed to receive nearly 200 malicious subscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2010/05/10/twitter-follow-bug/ |title=Twitter Bug Lets You Control Who Follows You |first=Adam |last=Ostrow |work=[[Mashable]] |date=May 10, 2010 |accessdate=May 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Twitter's security breaches, the [[Federal Trade Commission]] brought charges against the service which were settled on June 24, 2010. This was the first time the FTC had taken action against a social network for security lapses. The settlement requires Twitter to take a number of steps to secure users' private information, including maintenance of a &quot;comprehensive information security program&quot; to be independently audited biannually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gonsalves |first=Antone |date=June 25, 2010|url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/security/privacy/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=225701450&amp;subSection=Privacy |title=Twitter, Feds Settle Security Charges&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Twitter Must Establish and Maintain a 'Comprehensive Information Security Program' and Allow Third-Party Review of the Program Biannually for the 10 Years |work=[[InformationWeek]]|accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 14, 2010, the [[United States Department of Justice]] issued a [[Twitter subpoena|subpoena directing Twitter]] to provide information for accounts registered to or associated with [[WikiLeaks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2011/01/07/twitter/subpoena.pdf |title=Twitter Subpoena |work=[[Salon.com]]|format=PDF; requires [[Adobe Acrobat|Adobe Reader]] |accessdate=January 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter decided to notify its users and said in a statement, &quot;...it's our policy to notify users about law enforcement and governmental requests for their information, unless we are prevented by law from doing so&quot;.&lt;ref name=Rushe&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jan/08/us-twitter-hand-icelandic-wikileaks-messages |title=Icelandic MP Fights US Demand for Her Twitter Account Details |work=[[The Guardian]] |author=Rushe, Dominic |date=January 8, 2011 |accessdate=January 10, 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A &quot;MouseOver&quot; exploit occurred on September 21, 2010, when an [[XSS Worm]] became active on Twitter. When an account [[User (computing)|user]] held the [[mouseover|mouse cursor over]] blacked out parts of a tweet, the worm within the script would automatically open links and re-post itself on the reader's account.&lt;ref name=BBCscram/&gt; The exploit was then re-used to post [[pop-up ads]] and links to pornographic sites. The origin is unclear but Pearce H. Delphin (known on Twitter as @zzap) and a Scandinavian developer, Magnus Holm, both claim to have modified the exploit of a user, possibly Masato Kinugawa, who was using it to create coloured Tweets.&lt;ref name=Mashable&gt;{{cite web

The agreement will go into effect later 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engadget.com/2012/04/17/twitter-introduces-innovators-patent-agreement/ |title=Twitter introduces Innovators Patent Agreement, vows to not abuse patent system |first=Terrence |last=O’Brien |work=[[Engadget]] |publisher=[[AOL]] |date=April 17, 2012 |accessdate=August 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twitter has been used for a variety of purposes in many industries and scenarios. For example, it has been used to organize protests, sometimes referred to as &quot;Twitter Revolutions&quot;, which include the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]], [[2010–2011 Tunisian protests]], [[2009–2010 Iranian election protests]], and [[2009 Moldova civil unrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=January 15, 2011|url=http://andrewsullivan.theatlantic.com/the_daily_dish/2011/01/could-tunisia-be-the-next-twitter-revolution.html |title=Could Tunisia Be the Next Twitter Revolution? |work=[[The Atlantic]] |date=January 13, 2011 |author= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The governments of Iran and Egypt blocked the service in retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=

The service is also used as a form of [[civil disobedience]]: in 2010, users expressed outrage over the [[Twitter Joke Trial]] by making obvious jokes about terrorism;&lt;ref name=&quot;twitterjoke-spartacus-hashtag-guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/nov/12/iamspartacus-campaign-twitter-airport|title=#IAmSpartacus campaign explodes on Twitter in support of airport joker|date=2010-11-12|accessdate=12 November 2010|location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Haroon|last=Siddique}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[2011 British privacy injunctions controversy|British privacy injunction debate]] in the same country a year later, where several celebrities who had taken out anonymised injunctions, most notably the [[Manchester United]] player [[Ryan Giggs]], were identified by thousands of users in protest to traditional journalism being censored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/may/22/scottish-newspaper-identifies-injuction-footballer |title=Scottish newspaper identifies injunction footballer |last1=Gabbatt |first1=Adam |last2=Taylor |first2=Matthew |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=UK |date=22 May 2011 |accessdate=22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another, more [[Real time (media)|real time]] and practical use for Twitter exists as an effective ''de facto'' [[Emergency Communication System|emergency communication system]] for [[breaking news]]. It was neither intended nor designed for high performance communication, but the idea that it could be used for emergency communication certainly was not lost on the originators, who knew that the service could have wide-reaching effects early on when the San Francisco, California company used it to communicate during earthquakes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mills|first=Alexander|coauthors=Chen, Lee, Rao|title=WEB 2.0 EMERGENCY APPLICATIONS: HOW USEFUL CAN TWITTER BE  FOR EMERGENCY RESPONSE?|journal=Twitter for Emergency Management and Mitigation|year=2009|page=3|url=http://denman-mills.net/web_documents/jips_mills.etal._2009.07.22_finalsubmission.pdf|accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twitter has been adopted as a communication and learning tool in educational settings mostly in colleges and universities. &lt;ref&gt;Rankin, M. (2010).

Twitter is also increasingly used for making TV more interactive and social.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/03/31/shows-viewers-tweeting-operators/ |title=What Shows Are Viewers Tweeting About and What Does this Mean for Operators? |publisher=Tvgenius.net |date=2011-03-31 |accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This effect is sometimes referred to as the &quot;virtual watercooler&quot; or [[social television]] — the practice has been called &quot;chatterboxing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sky.com/home/technology/article/16189017 Social Web Makes TV Viewers 'Chatterboxers'], Sky News, 15 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter has been successfully used to encourage people to watch live TV events, such as the [[Oscars]], the [[Super Bowl]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.twitter.com/2010/02/super-data.html |title=Twitter Blog: Super Data |publisher=Blog.twitter.com |date=2010-02-10 |accessdate=2011-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[MTV Video Music Award]]s; however this strategy has proven less effective with regularly scheduled TV shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvgenius.net/blog/2011/05/25/twitter-drive-tv-live-ratings/ |title=Does Twitter Drive TV Ratings? |publisher=Tvgenius.net |date= |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such direct cross-promotions have been banned from French television due to regulations against secret advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110606-business-technology-france-regulators-ban-facebook-twitter-promotion-on-tv# |title=France bans Facebook and Twitter promotion on TV |publisher=FRANCE 24 |date=2011-06-06 |accessdate=2011-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2008, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote that [[social networking service]]s such as Twitter &quot;elicit mixed feelings in the technology-savvy people who have been their [[Diffusion (business)|early adopters]]. Fans say they are a good way to keep in touch with busy friends. But some users are starting to feel 'too' connected, as they grapple with check-in messages at odd hours, higher [[cellphone]] bills and the need to tell acquaintances to stop announcing what they're having for dinner.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=February 22, 2011 |url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB117373145818634482-ZwdoPQ0PqPrcFMDHDZLz_P6osnI_20080315.html |title=Friends Swap Twitters, and Frustration&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; New Real-Time Messaging Services Overwhelm Some Users with Mundane Updates from Friends |work=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |date=March 16, 2007 |last=Lavallee |first=Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tech writer [[Bruce Sterling]] opined in 2007 that using Twitter for &quot;literate communication&quot; is &quot;about as likely as firing up a [[CB radio]] and hearing some guy recite the ''[[Iliad]]''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Registration required|date=February 2011}} {{Cite news| author=Pontin, Jason| title=From Many Tweets, One Loud Voice on the Internet | date=April 22, 2007 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/business/yourmoney/22stream.html | work =[[The New York Times]] | accessdate = June 21, 2009 | authorlink= Jason Pontin }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008, the journalist [[Clive Thompson (journalist)|Clive Thompson]] mused in a ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' editorial that the service had expanded narcissism into &quot;a new, supermetabolic extreme—the ultimate expression of a generation of celebrity-addled youths who believe their every utterance is fascinating and ought to be shared with the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Registration required|date=February 2011}} {{Cite news| first=Clive | last=Thompson| title=I'm So Totally, Digitally Close to You | date=September 5, 2009 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/07/magazine/07awareness-t.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all | work =[[The New York Times Magazine]] | accessdate = August 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, ''[[Vancouver Sun]]'' columnist [[Steve Dotto]] opined that part of Twitter's appeal is the challenge of trying to publish such messages in tight constraints,&lt;ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=February 2011|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/Entertainment/Tweet+this+year+Twitter/1470046/story.html}} {{cite web|accessdate=April 13, 2009 |url=http://www.vancouversun.com/Entertainment/Tweet+this+year+Twitter/1470046/story.html |title=Tweet This: It's the Year of the Twitter|work=[[The Vancouver Sun]] |date=April 16, 2009 |last=Lewis|first=Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jonathan Zittrain]], professor of Internet law at [[Harvard Law School]], said that &quot;the qualities that make Twitter seem inane and half-baked are what makes it so powerful&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{registration required|date=February 2011}} {{Cite news| first=Noam | last=Cohen | title=Twitter on the Barricades: Six Lessons Learned | date=June 20, 2009 | work=[[The New York Times]] | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/21/weekinreview/21cohenweb.html?_r=1&amp;hp | accessdate = June 21, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
