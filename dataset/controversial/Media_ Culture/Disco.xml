'''Disco''' is a [[genre]] of [[dance music]]. Disco acts charted high during the mid-1970s, and the genre's popularity peaked during the late 1970s. Its initial audiences were club-goers from the [[African-American culture|African American]], [[Hispanic and Latino Americans#Culture|Latino]], [[LGBT culture|gay]], and [[Psychedelia|psychedelic]] communities in [[New York City]] and [[Philadelphia]] during the late 1960s and early 1970s. Disco also was a reaction against both the domination of [[rock music]] and the stigmatization of dance music by the [[counterculture]] during this period. Women embraced disco as well, and the music eventually expanded to several other popular groups of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;alternative to rock'n'roll&quot;&gt;(2007) ''The 1970s'', ISBN 978-0-313-33919-6, p.203–204: &quot;During the late 1960s various male counterculture groups, most notably gay, but also heterosexual black and Latino, created an alternative to rock'n'roll, which was dominated by white—and presumably heterosexual—men. This alternative was disco&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Scaruffi/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Partylikeits1975&quot;&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2001-07-10/news/disco-double-take/2 Disco Double Take: New York Parties Like It’s 1975].

In what is considered a forerunner to disco style clubs, New York City DJ [[David Mancuso]] opened [[The Loft]], a members-only private dance club set in his own home, in February 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empsfm.org/exhibitions/index.asp?articleID=128 Disco: A Decade of Saturday Nights], empsfm.org Past Exhibitions&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=r2&gt;[http://www.discomusic.com/101-more/7124_0_7_0_C/ Disco Roots | Disco Timeline], discomusic.com&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allmusic]] claims some have argued that [[Isaac Hayes]] and [[Barry White]] were playing what would be called disco music as early as 1971. According to the music guide, there is disagreement as to what the first disco song was. Claims have been made for [[Manu Dibango]]'s &quot;[[Soul Makossa]]&quot; (1972), [[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]]'s &quot;One Night Affair&quot; (1972), the [[Hues Corporation]]'s &quot;[[Rock the Boat (Hues Corporation song)|Rock the Boat]]&quot; (1973), [[George McCrae]]'s &quot;[[Rock Your Baby]]&quot; (1974),&lt;ref name=&quot;origins&quot;&gt;[http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Disco_-_Origins/id/1328269 Disco: Encyclopedia II – Disco – Origins].

Musical influences include [[funk]], [[Latin music|Latin]] and [[soul music]]. The disco sound has soaring, often reverberated vocals over a steady [[four-on-the-floor (music)|&quot;four-on-the-floor&quot;]] beat, an [[eighth note]] (quaver) or 16th note (semi-quaver) [[hi-hat]] pattern with an open hi-hat on the off-beat, and a prominent, [[syncopated]] [[bass guitar|electric bass]] line sometimes consisting of octaves. The [[Fender Jazz Bass]] is often associated with disco bass lines, because the instrument itself has a very prominent &quot;voice&quot; in the musical mix. In most disco tracks, strings, horns, electric pianos, and electric guitars create a lush background sound. Orchestral instruments such as the flute are often used for solo melodies, and [[lead guitar]] is less frequently in disco than in rock. Many disco songs employ the use of electronic instruments such as [[synthesizer]]s.

Well-known late 1970s disco performers included [[Donna Summer]], The [[Bee Gees]], [[KC and the Sunshine Band]], [[The Trammps]], [[Van McCoy]], [[Gloria Gaynor]], [[The Village People]], [[Chic (band)|Chic]], and [[The Jackson 5|The Jacksons]]—the latter which first dipped its toes into disco as The Jackson 5. Summer would become the first well-known and most popular disco artist—eventually having the title &quot;The Queen of Disco&quot; bestowed upon her by various critics—and would also play a part in pioneering the [[Electronic music|electronic sound]] that later became a prominent element of disco. While performers and singers garnered the lion's share of public attention, producers working behind the scenes played an equal, if not more important role in disco, since they often wrote the songs and created the innovative sounds and production techniques that were part of the &quot;disco sound.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/d16 Disco], allmusic&lt;/ref&gt;

Many non-disco artists recorded disco songs at the height of disco's popularity, and films such as ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' and ''[[Thank God It's Friday]]'' contributed to disco's rise in mainstream popularity. According to music writer [[Piero Scaruffi]], the disco phenomenon spread quickly because the &quot;collective ecstasy&quot; of disco was cathartic and regenerative and led to freedom of expression.&lt;ref name=Scaruffi/&gt; Disco was the last mass popular music movement that was driven by the [[baby boom generation]].&lt;ref name=ComiskyThriller/&gt; Disco music was a worldwide phenomenon, but its popularity declined in the [[United States]] in the late 1970s. On July 12, 1979, an anti-disco protest in [[Chicago]] called &quot;[[Disco Demolition Night]]&quot; had shown that an angry [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] against disco and its culture had emerged in the United States. In the subsequent months and years, many musical acts associated with disco struggled to get airplay on the radio. A few artists still managed to score disco hits in the early 1980s, but the term &quot;disco&quot; became unfashionable in the new decade and was eventually replaced by &quot;dance music&quot;, &quot;dance pop&quot;, and other identifiers.  Although the production techniques have changed, many successful acts since the 1970s have retained the basic disco beat and mentality, and dance clubs have remained popular.&lt;ref name=allmusicdisco/&gt;

==History==
===Proto-disco and early history===
The term &quot;[[night club|discothèque]]&quot; was coined in Europe to describe clubs where there was no live music played (a.k.a. disk-only events). In Occupied France, jazz and bebop music plus the jitterbug were banned by the Nazis as decadent American influences, so members of the [[French Resistance|Resistance]] met at hidden underground dance clubs called discotheques (fr. record collection) where they danced to American swing music, which a DJ played on a single turntable when a jukebox was not available.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} These &quot;discotheques&quot; were also patronized by anti-Vichy youth called 'zazou' who much like the kids in the USA during the 1940s were wearing zoot suits.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} There were also underground discotheques in Nazi Germany patronized by anti-Nazi youth called the swing kids.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

The [[sexual revolution]] occurred in the United States during the 1960s but homosexuals were left out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joy of Disco&quot;&gt;&quot;Joy of Disco&quot; BBC 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Homosexual sex acts were illegal in several states and gay bars were frequently raided by police.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joy of Disco&quot;/&gt; When police raided one such bar, the [[Stonewall Inn]] in the [[Greenwich Village]] section of [[New York City]] in June 1969, patrons fought back, leading to the [[Stonewall Riots]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Joy of Disco&quot;/&gt; For homosexuals the riot led to a feeling that the time had come when they could be themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joy of Disco&quot;/&gt; Due to the sexual revolution and [[feminism]], female sexual desire, which previously was not discussed or understood, became a topic for discussion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joy of Disco&quot;/&gt;

This was the atmosphere in which New York City musicians and audiences from the female, homosexual, black, and Latino communities adopted several traits from the [[hippies]] and [[psychedelia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Joy of Disco&quot;/&gt; They included overwhelming sound, free-form dancing, &quot;trippy&quot; lighting, colorful costumes, and [[hallucinogens]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Scaruffi&quot;&gt;[http://www.scaruffi.com/history/cpt34.html The History of Rock and Dance Music by Piero Scaruffi]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Partylikeits1975&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cambridge/&gt;&lt;ref name=Traces/&gt; [[Psychedelic soul]] groups like the [[Chambers Brothers]] and especially [[Sly and The Family Stone]] influenced proto-disco acts such as [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Willie Hutch]] and the [[Philadelphia soul|Philadelphia Sound]].&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=essay/|pure_url=yes}} Psychedelic Soul Allmusic]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the positivity, lack of irony, and earnestness of the [[hippies]] informed proto-disco music like [[M.F.S.B.]]'s &quot;Mothers&quot;[[Love Is the Message (album)|Love Is the Message]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Partylikeits1975/&gt; To the mainstream public M.F.S.B. stood for &quot;Mother Father Sister Brother&quot;; to the tough black areas where they came from it was understood to stand for &quot;Mother F***in Son of a Bitch&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joy of Disco&quot;/&gt;

Philly and New York soul were evolutions of the [[Motown sound]]. The Philly Sound is typified by lavish [[percussion instrument|percussion]] and lush strings, which became a prominent part of mid-1970s disco songs. Early songs with disco elements include &quot;[[You Keep Me Hangin' On]]&quot; ([[The Supremes]], 1966), &quot;[[Only the Strong Survive (Jerry Butler song)|Only the Strong Survive]]&quot; ([[Jerry Butler (singer)|Jerry Butler]], 1968), &quot;Message to Love&quot; ([[Jimi Hendrix]]'s [[Band of Gypsys]], 1970),&lt;ref&gt;[http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/H/Hendrix_Jimi/AlbumReviews/2000/10/18/771075.html CANOE – JAM! Music – Artists – Album Review: THE JIMI HENDRIX EXPERIENCE]. Canoe.ca: JAM! Music – Artists – Album Review: THE JIMI HENDRIX EXPERIENCE. ''Retrieved on August 4, 2009''.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Soul Makossa]]&quot; ([[Manu Dibango]], 1972), [[Eddie Kendricks]]' [[Keep on Truckin' (song)|Keep on Truckin']] (1973) and &quot;[[The Love I Lost]]&quot; by [[Harold Melvin &amp; The Blue Notes]] (1973).

The early disco sound was largely an urban American phenomenon with producers and labels such as SalSoul Records (Ken, Joe and Stanley Cayre), West End Records (Mel Cheren), Casablanca (Neil Bogart), and Prelude (Marvin Schlachter) to name a few.

The disco sound was also shaped by [[Tom Moulton]], who wanted to extend the enjoyment of the music—thus creating the extended mix or &quot;[[remix]]&quot;. This has influenced many other latter genres such as [[techno]] and [[pop music|pop]]. DJs and remixers would often remix (that is, re-edit) existing songs using reel-to-reel tape machines. Their remixed versions would add in percussion breaks, new sections, and new sounds. Other influential DJs and remixers who helped to establish what became known as the &quot;disco sound&quot; included [[David Mancuso]], [[Nicky Siano]], [[Shep Pettibone]], [[Larry Levan]], [[Walter Gibbons]], and Chicago-based &quot;Godfather of House&quot; [[Frankie Knuckles]].

Disco hit the television airwaves with [[Soul Train]] in 1971 hosted by [[Don Cornelius]], then [[Marty Angelo]]'s ''[[Disco Step-by-Step Television Show]]'' in 1975, Steve Marcus' ''Disco Magic/Disco 77'', Eddie Rivera's ''Soap Factory'' and [[Merv Griffin]]'s ''[[Dance Fever]]'', hosted by [[Deney Terrio]], who is credited with teaching actor [[John Travolta]] to dance for his upcoming role in the hit movie ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]''.

From 1974 through 1977, disco music continued to increase in popularity as many disco songs topped the charts. The [[Hues Corporation]]'s 1974 &quot;[[Rock the Boat (Hues Corporation song)|Rock the Boat]]&quot;, a U.S. #1 [[single (music)|single]] and million-seller, was one of the early disco songs to hit #1. The same year saw the release of &quot;[[Kung Fu Fighting]]&quot;, performed by [[Carl Douglas]] and produced by [[Biddu]], which reached #1 in both the U.K. and U.S., and became the best-selling single of the year&lt;ref name=&quot;The Book of Golden Discs&quot;&gt;{{cite book| first= Joseph| last= Murrells| year= 1978| title= The Book of Golden Discs| edition= 2nd| publisher= Barrie and Jenkins Ltd | location= London| page= 344| isbn= 0-214-20512-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the [[List of best-selling singles worldwide|best-selling singles of all time]] with eleven million records sold worldwide,&lt;ref name=&quot;metro_biddu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Biddu|author=James Ellis|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/showbiz/interviews/412-biddu|accessdate=2011-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;times_2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=August 20, 2004|title=It's a big step from disco to Sanskrit chants, but Biddu has made it|author=Malika Browne|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article471655.ece|accessdate=2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; helping to popularize disco music to a great extent.&lt;ref name=&quot;metro_biddu&quot;/&gt; Other chart-topping disco hits that year included &quot;[[Walking in Rhythm]]&quot; by [[The Blackbyrds]], &quot;[[Rock Your Baby]]&quot; by [[George McCrae]], and &quot;[[Love's Theme]]&quot; by [[Barry White]]'s [[Love Unlimited Orchestra]].

In the northwestern sections of the United Kingdom the [[Northern Soul]] explosion, which started in late 1960s and peaked in 1974, made the region receptive to Disco which the region's Disk Jockeys were bringing back from New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joy of Disco&quot;/&gt; [[George McCrae]]'s ''[[Rock Your Baby]]'' became the United Kingdom's first number one disco single.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joy of Disco&quot;/&gt;

Also in 1974, [[Gloria Gaynor]] released the first side-long [[disco mix]] [[gramophone record|vinyl]] [[album]], which included a remake of [[The Jackson 5]]'s &quot;[[Never Can Say Goodbye]]&quot; and two other songs, &quot;[[Honey Bee]]&quot; and &quot;[[Reach Out (I'll Be There)]]&quot;. [[MFSB]]  released &quot;[[TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)]]&quot;, a 1974 hit recording featuring vocals by [[The Three Degrees]], which became the first disco song to reach number one, after &quot;Love's Theme&quot;, on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]; it was written as the theme song for ''[[Soul Train]]''.

Formed by [[Harry Wayne Casey]] (&quot;KC&quot;) and Richard Finch, Miami's [[KC and the Sunshine Band]] had a string of disco-definitive top-five hits between 1975 and 1977, including &quot;[[Get Down Tonight]]&quot;, &quot;[[That's the Way (I Like It)]]&quot;, &quot;[[(Shake, Shake, Shake) Shake Your Booty]]&quot;, &quot;[[I'm Your Boogie Man]]&quot; and &quot;[[Keep It Comin' Love]]&quot;.

[[Electric Light Orchestra]]'s 1975 hit [[Evil Woman (Electric Light Orchestra song)|Evil Woman]], although described as Orchestral [[Rock Music|Rock]], featured a violin sound that became a staple of disco.

In 1975 [[Donna Summer]] recorded a song which she brought to her producer [[Giorgio Moroder]] entitled &quot;[[Love to Love You Baby]]&quot; which contained a series of simulated [[orgasm]]s The song was never intended for release but when Moroder played it in the clubs it caused a sensation. Moroder released it and it went to number 1. It has been described as the arrival of the expression of raw female sexual desire in pop music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Joy of Disco&quot;/&gt; A 17 minute [[12 inch single]] was released.

The [[Bee Gees]] used [[Barry Gibb]]'s [[falsetto]] to garner hits such as &quot;[[You Should Be Dancing]]&quot;, &quot;[[Stayin' Alive]]&quot;, &quot;[[Night Fever]]&quot;, &quot;[[More Than a Woman (Bee Gees song)|More Than A Woman]]&quot; and &quot;[[Love You Inside Out]]&quot;.

In 1975, hits such as [[Van McCoy]]'s &quot;[[The Hustle (song)|The Hustle]]&quot; and &quot;[[Could It Be Magic]]&quot; brought disco further into the mainstream. Other notable early disco hits include [[The Jackson 5]]’s &quot;[[Dancing Machine]]&quot; (1974), [[Barry White]]’s &quot;[[You're the First, the Last, My Everything]]&quot; (1974), [[Labelle|LaBelle]]’s &quot;[[Lady Marmalade]]&quot; (1975) and [[Silver Convention]]’s &quot;[[Fly Robin Fly]]&quot; (1975).

In December 1977, the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' was released. The film was marketed specifically to broaden disco's popularity beyond its primarily black and Latin audiences. It was a huge success and its [[soundtrack]] became one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums]] of all time.&lt;ref name=Scaruffi/&gt;

[[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s was formed by [[Nile Rodgers]] a self described &quot;street hippie&quot; from late 1960s New York and Martin Dow DJ at from Key West, Florida who pioneered the NYC sound across that state. &quot;[[Le Freak]]&quot; was a popular 1978 single that is regarded as an iconic song of the genre. Other hits by Chic include the often-sampled &quot;[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]&quot; (1979) and &quot;[[Everybody Dance (Chic song)|Everybody Dance]]&quot;. The group regarded themselves as the disco movement's rock band that made good on the [[hippie]] movements ideals of peace, love, and freedom.

[[The Jackson 5|The Jacksons]] (previously The Jackson 5) did many disco songs from 1975 to 1980, including &quot;[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]&quot; (1978), &quot;[[Blame it on the Boogie]]&quot; (1978), and &quot;[[Can You Feel It]]&quot; (1980)—all sung by [[Michael Jackson]], whose 1979 solo album, ''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]'', included several disco hits, including [[Off the Wall (song)|the album's title song]], &quot;[[Rock with You (Michael Jackson song)|Rock with You]]&quot;, &quot;[[Workin' Day and Night]]&quot;, and his second chart-topping solo hit in the disco genre, &quot;[[Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough]]&quot;.

}}

Disco's popularity led many non-disco artists to record disco songs at the height of its popularity. Many of their songs were not &quot;pure&quot; disco, but were instead rock or pop songs with (sometimes inescapable) disco influence or overtones. Notable examples include [[Mike Oldfield]]'s &quot;[[Guilty (Mike Oldfield instrumental)|Guilty]]&quot; (1979) [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]]'s &quot;[[Heart of Glass (song)|Heart of Glass]]&quot; (1978), [[Cher]]'s &quot;[[Hell on Wheels]]&quot; and &quot;[[Take Me Home (Cher song)|Take Me Home]]&quot; (both 1979), [[Barry Manilow]]’s &quot;[[Copacabana (song)|Copacabana]]&quot; (1978), [[David Bowie]]'s &quot;John I'm Only Dancing (Again)&quot; (1975), [[Rod Stewart]]'s &quot;[[Da Ya Think I'm Sexy?]]&quot; (1979), [[Electric Light Orchestra]]’s &quot;[[Shine a Little Love]]&quot;, &quot;[[Don't Bring Me Down]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Last Train to London]]&quot; (all 1979), [[George Benson]]'s &quot;[[Give Me the Night (George Benson song)|Give Me the Night]]&quot; (1980), [[Elton John]] and [[Kiki Dee]]'s &quot;[[Don't Go Breaking My Heart]]&quot; (1976), and [[Diana Ross]]' &quot;[[Upside Down (Diana Ross song)|Upside Down]]&quot; (1980).

Even hard-core [[mainstream rock]]ers mixed elements of disco with their typical [[rock 'n roll]] style in songs. [[Progressive rock]] group [[Pink Floyd]], when creating their [[rock opera]] ''[[The Wall]]'', used disco-style components in their song, &quot;[[Another Brick in the Wall|Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2]]&quot; (1979)&lt;ref name=&quot;choir and disco&quot;&gt;It was producer [[Bob Ezrin]]'s idea to incorporate a disco riff, as well as a second-verse children's choir, into &quot;Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2&quot;. {{cite journal| title = &quot;Good Bye Blue Sky&quot;, (Pink Floyd: 30th Anniversary, The Wall Revisited.) | journal=[[Guitar World]] | volume = 30 |issue= 10| pages = 79–80| url = http://www.guitarworld.com/article/pink_floyd_goodbye_blue_sky?page=0%2C3 | editor = Simmons, Sylvie | publisher=Future | year = 2009 | month = October}}&lt;/ref&gt;—which became the group's only #1 hit single (in both the US and UK). [[The Eagles]] gave nods to disco with &quot;[[One of These Nights]]&quot; (1975)&lt;ref&gt;[[Don Henley]] commented on &quot;One of These Nights&quot;'s disco connection in the liner notes of [[The Very Best of Eagles]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;[[The Long Run (album)|Disco Strangler]]&quot; (1979), [[Paul McCartney &amp; Wings]] did &quot;[[Goodnight Tonight]]&quot; (1979), [[Queen (band)|Queen]] did &quot;[[Another One Bites the Dust]]&quot; (1980), [[The Rolling Stones]] did &quot;[[Miss You (The Rolling Stones song)|Miss You]]&quot; (1978), [[Chicago (band)|Chicago]] did &quot;[[Chicago 13|Street Player]]&quot; (1979), [[The Beach Boys]] did &quot;[[Here Comes the Night (The Beach Boys song)|Here Comes the Night]]&quot; (1979), [[The Kinks]] did &quot;[[Low Budget (album)|(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman]]&quot; (1979), and the [[J. Geils Band]] did &quot;[[Love Stinks|Come Back]]&quot; (1980). Even [[heavy metal music]] group [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] jumped in with &quot;[[I Was Made For Lovin' You]]&quot; (1979).&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Stanley]], a guitarist for the rock group Kiss became friends with [[Desmond Child]] and, as Child remembered in Billboard, &quot;Paul and I talked about how dance music at that time didn’t have any rock elements.&quot; To counteract the synthesized disco music dominating the airwaves, Stanley and Child wrote, &quot;I Was Made For Loving You.&quot; So, &quot;we made history,&quot; Child further remembered in Billboard, &quot;because we created the first rock-disco song.&quot;{{Issue|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The disco fad was also picked up even by &quot;non-pop&quot; artists. [[Easy listening]] artist [[Barbra Streisand]] teamed up with [[Donna Summer]] to do &quot;[[No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)]]&quot; in 1979, then with [[Barry Gibb]] to do &quot;[[Guilty (Barbra Streisand and Barry Gibb song)|Guilty]]&quot; the following year. Of [[country music]] artists, [[Connie Smith]] covered Andy Gibb's &quot;[[I Just Want to Be Your Everything]]&quot; in 1977, [[Bill Anderson (singer)|Bill Anderson]] did &quot;Double S&quot; in 1978, and [[Ronnie Milsap]] covered [[Tommy Tucker (singer)|Tommy Tucker]]' s &quot;[[High Heel Sneakers]]&quot; in 1979.

====Disco revisions of songs====
Pre-existing non-disco songs and standards would frequently be &quot;disco-ized&quot; in the 1970s. The rich orchestral accompaniment that became identified with the disco era conjured up the memories of the [[big band]] era—which brought out several artists that recorded and disco-ized some big band arrangements including [[Perry Como]], who re-recorded his 1929 and 1939 hit, &quot;Temptation&quot;, in 1975, as well as [[Ethel Merman]], who released an album of disco songs entitled ''[[The Ethel Merman Disco Album]]'' in 1979.

[[Myron Floren]], second-in-command on ''[[The Lawrence Welk Show]]'', released a recording of the [[Clarinet Polka]] entitled &quot;Disco Accordion&quot;. Easy listening icon [[Percy Faith]], in one of his last recordings, recorded a disco version of his famous &quot;[[Theme from A Summer Place]]&quot; in 1976. [[Classical music]] was even adapted for disco, notably [[Walter Murphy]]'s &quot;[[A Fifth of Beethoven]]&quot; (1976, based on the first movement of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 5 (Beethoven)|5th Symphony]]) and &quot;Flight 76&quot; (1976, based on [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]]'s &quot;[[Flight of the Bumblebee]]&quot;), and [[Louis Clark]]'s ''[[Hooked On Classics]]'' series of albums and singles.

Notable disco hits based on movie and television themes included a medley from ''[[Star Wars]]'', &quot;[[Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band]]&quot; (1977) by [[Meco]], and &quot;Twilight Zone/Twilight Tone&quot; (1979) by [[The Manhattan Transfer]]. Even the ''[[I Love Lucy]]'' theme wasn't spared from being disco-ized. Many original [[television]] [[theme songs]] of the era also showed a strong disco influence, such as &quot;Keep Your Eye On The Sparrow&quot; (theme from ''[[Baretta]]'', performed by [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]] and later a hit single for [[Rhythm Heritage]]), [[Theme from &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;]] (from ''[[S.W.A.T. (TV series)|S.W.A.T]]'', original and single versions by Rhythm Heritage), and [[Mike Post]]'s theme from ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]''.

====Parodies====
Several parodies of the disco style were created. [[Rick Dees]], at the time a radio DJ in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], recorded &quot;[[Disco Duck]]&quot; (1976) and &quot;Dis-Gorilla&quot; (1977); [[Frank Zappa]] parodied the lifestyles of disco dancers in &quot;Dancin' Fool&quot; on his 1979 ''[[Sheik Yerbouti]]'' album, and &quot;[[Disco Boy]]&quot; on his 1976 ''[[Zoot Allures]]'' album; and [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic]]'s 1981 [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic (album)|eponymous debut album]] includes a disco song called &quot;Gotta Boogie&quot;, an extended pun on the similarity of the disco subgenre name &quot;[[Boogie (genre)|boogie]]&quot; to the American slang word &quot;[[Dried nasal mucus|booger]]&quot; and its British counterpart &quot;bogey&quot;.

===Backlash and decline===
[[File:Rich-in-70s.jpg|thumb|Man wearing ''Disco Sucks'' T-shirt.]]
By the late 1970s, a strong anti-disco sentiment developed among rock fans and musicians, particularly in the United States.&lt;ref name=allmusicdisco/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Contemporary American Culture'', ISBN 978-0-415-16161-9, ISBN 978-0-415-16161-9 (2001) p. 217: &quot;In fact, by 1977, before punk spread, there was a 'disco sucks' movement sponsored by radio stations that attracted some suburban white youth, who thought that disco was escapist, synthetic, and overproduced.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The slogans &quot;disco sucks&quot; and &quot;death to disco&quot;&lt;ref name=allmusicdisco/&gt; became common, Rock artists such as [[Rod Stewart]] and [[David Bowie]] who added disco elements to their music were accused of being [[sell out]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christgau&quot;&gt;[http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/pnj/pj78.php Robert Christgau: Pazz &amp; Jop 1978: New Wave Hegemony and the Bebop Question] [[Robert Christgau]] for the [[Village Voice]] Pop &amp; Jop Poll 1978  January 22, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=espn/&gt;

The [[punk subculture]] in the United States and United Kingdom was often hostile towards disco.&lt;ref name=allmusicdisco&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/subgenre/disco-ma0000002552 Disco], [[Allmusic]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jello Biafra]] of [[The Dead Kennedys]], in the song &quot;Saturday Night Holocaust&quot;, likened disco to the [[cabaret]] culture of [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]]-era [[Germany]] for its apathy towards government policies and its escapism. [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] of [[Devo]] said that disco was &quot;like a beautiful woman with a great body and no brains&quot;, and a product of political apathy of that era.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juicemagazine.com/devo.html DEVO and the evolution of The Wipeouters interview with MARK MOTHERSBAUGH Juice Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt; New Jersey rock critic Jim Testa wrote &quot;Put a Bullet Through the Jukebox&quot;, a vitriolic screed attacking disco that was considered a punk call to arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Testa&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mark Andersen|author2=Mark Jenkins|title=Dance of days: two decades of punk in the nation's capital|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CU1jKq0TlvQC&amp;pg=PA17|accessdate=21 March 2011|date=1 August 2003|publisher=Akashic Books|isbn=978-1-888451-44-3|pages=17–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainstream rock pushed back as well: [[Bob Seger]]'s &quot;[[Old Time Rock and Roll]]&quot; (1978) contained a slight against disco in
Anti-disco sentiment was expressed in some television shows and films. A recurring theme on the show ''[[WKRP in Cincinnati]]'' was a hostile attitude towards disco music. In one scene of the comedy film ''[[Airplane!]]'', a city skyline features a radio tower with a [[neon]]-lighted station callsign. A [[disc jockey]] voiceover says: &quot;WZAZ in Chicago, where disco lives forever!&quot; Then a wayward airplane slices the radio tower with its wing, the voiceover goes silent, and the lighted callsign goes dark.

July 12, 1979 became known as &quot;the day disco died&quot; because of ''[[Disco Demolition Night]]'', an anti-disco demonstration at [[Comiskey Park]] in Chicago.&lt;ref name=Campion&gt;Campion (2009), pp. 82–84.&lt;/ref&gt; Rock station DJs Steve Dahl and [[Garry Meier]], along with Michael Veeck, son of [[Chicago White Sox]] owner [[Bill Veeck]], staged the promotional event for disgruntled rock fans between the games of a White Sox doubleheader. The event, which involved exploding disco records, ended with a riot, during which the raucous crowd tore out seats and pieces of turf, and caused other damage. The [[Chicago Police Department]] made numerous arrests, and the extensive damage to the field forced the White Sox to forfeit the second game to the [[Detroit Tigers]], who had won the first game.

On July 21, 1979, six days after the riot, the top six records on the U.S. music charts were disco songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ComiskyThriller&quot;&gt;[http://www.wnyc.org/shows/soundcheck/2009/jul/14/disco-demolition-night/] From Comiskey Park to Thriller: The Effect of “Disco Sucks” on Pop] by [[Steve Greenberg (record producer)|Steve Greenberg]] founder and CEO of [[S-Curve Records]] July 10, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
By September 22 there were no disco songs in the US Top 10 chart &lt;ref name=&quot;ComiskyThriller&quot;/&gt;
(although a few disco songs within the next year would later enter the chart {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}). Some in the media, in celebratory tones, declared disco dead and rock revived.&lt;ref name=&quot;ComiskyThriller&quot;/&gt;

====Impact on music industry====
The anti-disco backlash, combined with other societal and radio industry factors, changed the face of pop radio in the years following Disco Demolition Night. [[Top 40]] radio stations did a turn-around and avoided playing music by black and Latin artists in general to avoid being labeled with the dreaded &quot;disco&quot; tag, regardless of what music style those artists performed.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} Starting in the 1980s, [[country music]] began a slow rise in the main pop charts. Emblematic of country music's rise to mainstream popularity was the commercially successful 1980 movie ''[[Urban Cowboy]]''. Somewhat ironically, the star of the film was [[John Travolta]], who only three years before had starred in ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', a film that featured disco culture.

During this period of decline in disco's popularity, several record companies folded, were reorganized, or were sold. In 1979, [[MCA Records]] purchased [[ABC Records]], absorbed some of its artists, and then shut the label down. [[RSO Records]] founder [[Robert Stigwood]] left the label in 1981 and [[TK Records]] closed in the same year. [[Salsoul Records]] folded in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disco-disco.com/labels/salsoul.shtml Salsoul Records profile at disco-disco.com] Retrieved on 2011-03-21.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Casablanca Records]] had been releasing fewer records in the 1980s, and was shut down in 1986 by parent company [[PolyGram]].

Many groups that were popular during the disco period subsequently struggled to maintain their success—even those that tried to adapt to evolving musical tastes. The [[Bee Gees]], for instance, only had one major hit in the [[United States]] after the 1970s—even though later songs they wrote and had ''others'' perform were successful. Of the handful of groups ''not'' taken down by disco's fall from favor, [[The Jacksons]]—and [[Michael Jackson]] in particular—stand out: In spite of having helped define the disco sound early on,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jackson 5: The Ultimate Collection]]'' (1996), liner notes.&lt;/ref&gt; they continued to make popular and danceable, if more refined, songs for yet another generation of music fans in the 1980s and beyond.

====Factors contributing to disco's decline====
Factors that have been cited as leading to the decline of disco in the United States include economic and political changes at the end of the 1970s as well as [[burnout (psychology)|burnout]] from the [[hedonism|hedonistic]] lifestyles led by participants.&lt;ref name=&quot;BeeGees&quot;&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3652|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic BeeGees bio]&lt;/ref&gt; In the years since Disco Demolition Night, some social critics have described the backlash as implicitly macho and bigoted, and an attack on non-white and non-heterosexual cultures.&lt;ref name=allmusicdisco/&gt;&lt;ref name=espn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Campion/&gt;

In January 1979, rock critic [[Robert Christgau]] argued that [[homophobia]], and most likely [[racism]], were reasons behind the backlash,&lt;ref name=Christgau/&gt; a conclusion seconded by [[John Rockwell]]. Craig Werner wrote: &quot;The Anti-disco movement represented an unholy alliance of funkateers and feminists, progressives and puritans, rockers and reactionaries. Nonetheless, the attacks on disco gave respectable voice to the ugliest kinds of unacknowledged racism, sexism and homophobia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Easlea, Daryl, [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/disco-inferno-680390.html Disco Inferno], ''[[The Independent]]'', December 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; [[Legs McNeil]], founder of the [[fanzine]] [[Punk (magazine)|''Punk'']], was quoted in an interview as saying, &quot;the hippies always wanted to be black. We were going, 'fuck the blues, fuck the black experience'.&quot; He also said that disco was the result of an unholy union between homosexuals and blacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reynolds154&quot;&gt;Rip it Up and Start Again POSTPUNK 1978–1984 by [[Simon Reynolds]] p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Steve Dahl]], who had spearheaded Disco Demolition Night, denied any racist or homophobic undertones to the promotion, saying, &quot;It's really easy to look at it historically, from this perspective, and attach all those things to it. But we weren't thinking like that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;espn&quot;&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page3/story?page=behrens/040809 Disco demolition: Bell bottoms be gone! ESPN August 11, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been noted that British [[punk rock]] critics of disco were very supportive of the pro-black/anti-racist [[reggae]] genre.&lt;ref name=allmusicdisco/&gt; [[Robert Christgau]] and Jim Testa have said that there were legitimate artistic reasons for being critical of disco.&lt;ref name=Christgau/&gt;&lt;ref name=Testa/&gt;

Others blamed pushback from the rock industry: Harold Childs, senior vice president at [[A&amp;M Records]], told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that &quot;radio is really desperate for rock product&quot; and &quot;they're all looking for some white rock-n-roll&quot;.&lt;ref name=Campion/&gt; [[Gloria Gaynor]] argued that the music industry supported the destruction of disco because rock music producers were losing money and rock musicians were losing the spotlight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emplive.org/exhibits/index.asp?articleID=622 empsfm.org – EXHIBITIONS – Featured Exhibitions]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revivals===
In the late 1980s and increasingly through the 1990s, a revival of the original disco style began to emerge.

By the mid to late 2000s, many disco-influenced songs were hits. Disco tributes continue to be popular draws. The [[World's Largest Disco]], an annual celebration held over [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] weekend in [[Buffalo, New York]], draws thousands of disco fans in 1970s-era attire. In addition to playing disco hits of the era, artists from the 1970s perform live.

|title = Donna Summer - &quot;I Feel Love&quot; (1977)
|description = [[Donna Summer]]'s &quot;[[I Feel Love]]&quot; (1977), produced by [[Giorgio Moroder]], was a seminal Euro disco song.
}}

Euro disco was not as funky, more pop oriented, and less [[soul music|soul]] influenced than American styled disco. European acts [[Silver Convention]], [[Love and Kisses]], Munich Machine, and American acts [[Donna Summer]] and the [[Village People]], were acts that defined the late 1970s Eurodisco sound. Producers [[Giorgio Moroder]], whom [[Allmusic]] described as &quot;one of the principal architects of the disco sound&quot; with the Donna Summer hit &quot;[[I Feel Love]]&quot; (1977),&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p23915|pure_url=yes}} Giorgio Moroder] Allmusic.com&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean-Marc Cerrone]] were involved with Eurodisco. The German group [[Kraftwerk]] also had an influence on Euro disco.

By far the most successful Euro disco act was [[ABBA]].  This Swedish quartet—with such hits as &quot;[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]&quot; (1974), &quot;[[Fernando (song)|Fernando]]&quot; (1976), &quot;[[Take a Chance on Me]]&quot; (1978), and their signature smash &quot;[[Dancing Queen]]&quot; (1976)—ranks as the [[List of best-selling music artists|eighth best-selling act of all time]]. Other prominent European [[Pop music|pop]] and disco groups were [[Luv']] from the Netherlands and [[Boney M]], a group of four West Indian singers and dancers masterminded by West German record producer [[Frank Farian]]. [[Boney M]] charted worldwide hits with such songs as &quot;[[Daddy Cool (Boney M. song)|Daddy Cool]]&quot;, &quot;[[Ma Baker]]&quot; and &quot;[[Rivers of Babylon]]&quot;.

In France, [[Claude François]] who re-invented himself as the king of French disco, released &quot;La plus belle chose du monde&quot;, a French version of the [[Bee Gees]] hit record, &quot;[[Massachusetts (Bee Gees song)|Massachusetts]]&quot;, which became a big hit in [[Canada]] and [[Europe]] and &quot;Alexandrie Alexandra&quot; was posthumously released on the day of his burial and became a worldwide hit. [[Dalida]] released &quot;[[J'attendrai]]&quot;, which became a big hit in Canada and [[Japan]], and [[Cerrone]]'s early hit songs, &quot;Love in C Minor&quot;, &quot;[[Give Me Love]]&quot; and &quot;[[Supernature (Cerrone song)|Supernature]]&quot; became major hits in the U.S. and Europe.

==Role of Motown==
[[Diana Ross]] was one of the first [[Motown]] artists to embrace the disco sound with her hugely successful 1976 outing &quot;[[Love Hangover]]&quot; from her self-entitled album. Ross would continue to score disco hits for the rest of the disco era, including the 1980 dance classics &quot;[[Upside Down]]&quot; and &quot;[[I'm Coming Out]]&quot; (the latter immediately becoming a favorite in the gay community).  [[The Supremes]], The group that made Ross famous, scored a handful of hits in the disco clubs without Ross, most notably 1976's &quot;[[I'm Gonna Let My Heart Do the Walking]]&quot; and, their last charted single before disbanding, 1977's &quot;You're My Driving Wheel&quot;.

Also noteworthy are [[Cheryl Lynn]]'s &quot;[[Got to Be Real]]&quot; (1978), [[Evelyn King (singer)|Evelyn &quot;Champagne&quot; King]]'s &quot;[[Shame (Evelyn King song)|Shame]]&quot; (1978), [[Cher]]'s &quot;[[Take Me Home (Cher song)|Take Me Home]]&quot; (1979), [[Sister Sledge]]'s &quot;[[We Are Family (song)|We Are Family]]&quot; (1979), [[Geraldine Hunt]]'s &quot;[[Can't Fake the Feeling]]&quot; (1980), and [[Walter Murphy]]'s various attempts to bring [[classical music]] to the mainstream, most notably his hit &quot;[[A Fifth of Beethoven]]&quot; (1976).

The music tended to layer soaring, often-reverberated vocals, which are often doubled by horns, over a background &quot;pad&quot; of electric pianos and wah-pedaled &quot;chicken-scratch&quot; guitars. Other backing keyboard instruments include the [[piano]], organ (during early years), string synth, and electroacoustic keyboards such as the Fender Rhodes piano, Wurlitzer electric piano, and Hohner Clavinet. Synthesizers are also fairly common in disco, especially in the late 1970s.

The rhythm is laid down by prominent, syncopated basslines (with heavy use of octaves) played on the [[bass guitar]] and by drummers using a [[drum kit]], African/[[Latin percussion]], and [[electronic drum]]s such as Simmons and [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] [[sound module|drum modules]]). The sound is enriched with solo lines and harmony parts played by a variety of orchestral instruments, such as [[harp]], [[violin]], [[viola]], [[cello]], [[trumpet]], [[saxophone]], [[trombone]], [[clarinet]], [[flugelhorn]], [[French horn]], [[tuba]], [[English horn]], [[oboe]], [[flute]] (sometimes especially the [[alto flute]] and occasionally [[bass flute]]), [[piccolo]], [[timpani]] and [[synthesizer|synth strings]] or a full-blown [[string orchestra]].

Most disco songs have a steady [[four-on-the-floor (music)|four-on-the-floor]] beat, a [[quaver]] or semi-quaver [[hi-hat]] pattern with an open hi-hat on the off-beat, and a heavy, syncopated bass line. This basic beat would appear to be related to the Dominican [[Merengue music|merengue]] rhythm. Other Latin rhythms such as the rhumba, the samba and the cha-cha-cha are also found in disco recordings, and Latin [[polyrhythm]]s, such as a rhumba beat layered over a merengue, are commonplace. The quaver pattern is often supported by other instruments such as the rhythm guitar and may be implied rather than explicitly present.

It often involves [[syncopation]], rarely occurring on the beat unless a [[synthesizer]] is used to replace the bass guitar. In general, the difference between a disco, or any dance song, and a rock or popular song is that in dance music the bass hits ''four to the floor'', at least once a beat (which in 4/4 time is 4 beats per measure), whereas in rock the bass hits on one and three and lets the snare take the lead on two and four. Disco is further characterized by a 16th note division of the quarter notes established by the bass as shown in the second drum pattern below, after a typical rock drum pattern.

The orchestral sound usually known as &quot;disco sound&quot; relies heavily on strings and horns playing linear phrases, in unison with the soaring, often reverberated vocals or playing instrumental fills, while electric pianos and chicken-scratch guitars create the background &quot;pad&quot; sound defining the harmony progression. Typically, a rich &quot;[[wall of sound]]&quot; results. There are, however, more minimalistic flavors of disco with reduced, transparent instrumentation, pioneered by [[Chic (band)]].

In 1977, [[Giorgio Moroder]] again became responsible for a development in disco. Alongside [[Donna Summer]] and [[Pete Bellotte]] he wrote the song &quot;[[I Feel Love]]&quot; for Summer to perform. It became the first well-known disco hit to have a completely synthesised backing track. The song is still considered to have been well ahead of its time. Other disco producers, most famously [[Tom Moulton]], grabbed ideas and techniques from dub music (which came with the increased [[Jamaican]] migration to New York City in the seventies) to provide alternatives to the four on the floor style that dominated. [[Larry Levan]] utilized style keys from [[Dub music|dub]] and [[jazz]] and more as one of the most successful remixers of all time to create early versions of [[house music]] that sparked the genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Production===
The &quot;disco sound&quot; was much more costly to produce than many of the other popular music genres from the 1970s. Unlike the simpler, four-piece band sound of the funk, soul of the late 1960s, or the small [[jazz]] [[organ trio]]s, disco music often included a large pop band, with several chordal instruments (guitar, keyboards, synthesizer), several drum or percussion instruments (drumkit, Latin percussion, electronic drums), a [[horn section]], a [[string orchestra]], and a variety of &quot;classical&quot; solo instruments (for example, flute, piccolo, and so on).

Disco songs were [[arrangement|arranged]] and composed by experienced arrangers and [[orchestration|orchestrators]], and producers added their creative touches to the overall sound. Recording complex arrangements with such a large number of instruments and sections required a team that included a [[Conductor (music)|conductor]], [[copyist]]s, [[record producer]]s, and [[audio engineering|mixing engineers]]. Mixing engineers had an important role in the disco production process, because disco songs used as many as 64 [[sound recording|tracks]] of vocals and instruments. Mixing engineers compiled these tracks into a fluid composition of verses, bridges, and refrains, complete with [[orchestral build]]s and [[break (music)|breaks]]. Mixing engineers helped to develop the &quot;disco sound&quot; by creating a distinctive-sounding [[disco mix]].

Early records were the &quot;standard&quot; 3&amp;nbsp;minute version until [[Tom Moulton]] came up with a way to make songs longer, wanting to take a crowd to another level that was impossible with 45-RPM vinyl discs of the time (which could usually hold no more than 5&amp;nbsp;minutes of good-quality music). With the help of José Rodriguez, his remasterer, he pressed a single on a 10&quot; disc instead of 7&quot;. They cut the next single on a 12&quot; disc, the same format as a standard album. This method fast became the standard format for all DJs of the genre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.disco-disco.com/disco/history.shtml The Disco History page !], Disco-Disco.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Because record sales were often dependent on floor play in clubs, [[disc jockey|DJs]] were also important to the development and popularization of disco music. Notable DJs include Rex Potts (Loft Lounge, Sarasota, Florida), Karen Cook, [[Jim Burgess (producer)|Jim Burgess]], [[Walter Gibbons]], [[John &quot;Jellybean&quot; Benitez]], Richie Kaczar of [[Studio 54]], Rick Gianatos, [[Francis Grasso]] of Sanctuary, [[Larry Levan]], [[Ian Levine]], Neil &quot;Raz&quot; Rasmussen &amp; Mike Pace of L'amour Disco in Brooklyn, Preston Powell of Magique, Jennie Costa of Lemontrees, Tee Scott, Tony Smith of [[Xenon]], John Luongo, Robert Ouimet of [[The Limelight]], and [[David Mancuso]].

==Disco clubs and culture==
[[File:Blue disco quad roller skates.jpg|thumb|250px|Blue disco quad [[roller skates]].]]
By the late 1970s most major U.S. cities had thriving disco club scenes, but the largest scenes were in [[San Francisco]], [[Miami]], and most notably [[New York City]]. The scene was centered on [[discotheque]]s, nightclubs, and private loft parties where [[DJ]]s would play disco hits through powerful [[PA system]]s for the patrons who came to dance. The DJs played &quot;...a smooth mix of long single records to keep people 'dancing all night long'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/courier/2000_07/uk/doss13.htm The Body and soul of club culture]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most prestigious clubs had elaborate lighting systems that throbbed to the beat of the music.

At the height of the disco era, McFaddin Ventures were operating many successful and profitable nightclubs. In an effort to maximize profit, McFaddin Ventures in Houston, Texas commissioned a study on the stimulation of males and females during the playing of music. They accordingly custom tuned their speakers to make their numerous clubs more exciting.

In October 1975 notable discos included &quot;Studio One&quot; in Los Angeles, &quot;Leviticus&quot; in New York and &quot;The Library&quot; in Atlanta.&lt;ref name=Disco197510/&gt;  The library Disco chain had locations in New City, Syracuse N.Y., Pittsburgh Pa., a short lived version in Denver, Co. as well as Atlanta Ga.

In the late 1970s, [[Studio 54]] was arguably the most well known nightclub in the world. This club played a major formative role in the growth of disco music and [[nightclub]] culture in general.

=== Disco dancing ===
In the early years dancers in discos danced in a &quot;hang loose&quot; style. Popular dances included &quot;Bump&quot;, &quot;Penguin&quot;, &quot;Boogaloo&quot;, &quot;Watergate&quot; and the &quot;Robot&quot;. By October 1975 [[Hustle (dance)|The Hustle]] reigned. It was highly stylized, sophisticated and overtly sexual. Variations included the [[Brooklyn Hustle]], [[New York Hustle]] and [[Latin Hustle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Disco197510&quot;&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gQQ1AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Fk8KAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=840,3518488&amp;dq=disco+music&amp;hl=en Everybody's Doing The hustle], Associated Press, October 16, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;

During the disco era, many nightclubs would commonly host disco dance competitions or offer free instructional lessons. Some cities had disco dance instructors or dance schools, which taught people how to do popular disco dances such as ''&quot;[[touch dancing]],'' ''&quot;the hustle,'' and ''[[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|the cha cha]].'' The pioneer of disco dance instruction was Karen Lustgarten in San Francisco in 1973. Her book The Complete Guide to Disco Dancing (Warner Books, 1978) was the first to name, break down and codify popular disco dances as a dance form and distinguish between disco freestyle, partner and line dances. The book hit the New York Times Best Seller List for 13 weeks and was translated into Chinese, German and French.

Some notable professional dance troupes of the 1970s included [[Pan's People]] and [[Hot Gossip]]. For many dancers, the primary influence of the 1970s disco age is still predominantly the film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'' (1977). This developed into the music and dance style of such films as ''[[Fame (1980 film)|Fame]]'' (1980), ''[[Disco Dancer]]'' (1982), ''[[Flashdance]]'' (1983), and ''[[The Last Days of Disco]]'' (1998). It also helped spawn dance competition TV shows such as [[Dance Fever]] (1979).

=== Disco fashion ===
Disco fashions were very trendy in the late 1970s. Discothèque-goers often wore expensive and extravagant fashions for nights out at their local disco, such as sheer, flowing [[Halston]] dresses for women and shiny polyester [[Qiana]] shirts for men with pointy collars, preferably open at the chest, often worn with [[Double knitting|double-knit]] polyester shirt jackets with matching trousers known as the leisure suit. [[Necklace]]s and [[medal]]lions were a common [[fashion accessory]].

=== Drug subculture and sexual promiscuity ===
In addition to the dance and fashion aspects of the disco club scene, there was also a thriving drug [[subculture]], particularly for drugs that would enhance the experience of dancing to the loud music and the flashing lights, such as [[cocaine]]&lt;ref&gt;Gootenberg, Paul 1954–
– Between Coca and Cocaine: A Century or More of U.S.-Peruvian Drug Paradoxes, 1860–1980
– Hispanic American Historical Review – 83:1, February 2003, pp. 119–150. &quot;The relationship of cocaine to 1970s disco culture cannot be stressed enough ...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; (nicknamed &quot;blow&quot;), amyl nitrite &quot;[[poppers]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Amyl, butyl and isobutyl nitrite (collectively known as alkyl nitrites) are clear, yellow liquids inhaled for their intoxicating effects. Nitrites originally came as small glass capsules that were popped open. This led to nitrites being given the name 'poppers' but this form of the drug is rarely found in the UK. The drug became popular in the UK first on the disco/club scene of the 1970s and then at dance and rave venues in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;/ref&gt; and the &quot;...other quintessential 1970s club drug [[Quaalude]], which suspended [[motor coordination]] and gave the sensation that one’s arms and legs had turned to [[Jell-O]].&quot;&lt;ref name=r1&gt;Peter Braunstein [http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1999/7/1999_7_43.shtml DISCO], American Heritage Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Peter Braunstein]], the &quot;massive quantities of drugs ingested in discotheques produced the next [[cultural phenomenon]] of the disco era: rampant [[promiscuity]] and [[public sex]]. While the dance floor was the central arena of [[seduction]], actual sex usually took place in the nether regions of the disco: bathroom stalls, exit [[stairwell]]s, and so on. In other cases the disco became a kind of 'main course' in a hedonist's menu for a night out.&quot;&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

Famous disco bars included the very important [[Paradise Garage]] and [[Crisco Disco]] as well as &quot;...cocaine-filled [[celebrity|celeb]] hangouts such as [[Manhattan]]'s [[Studio 54]],&quot; which was operated by [[Steve Rubell]] and [[Ian Schrager]]. Studio 54 was notorious for the [[hedonism]] that went on within; the balconies were known for [[sexual encounters]], and drug use was rampant. Its dance floor was decorated with an image of the &quot;[[Man in the Moon]]&quot; that included an animated [[cocaine spoon]].

==Influence on other music==
===1982–1990: Post-disco and dance {{Anchor|1982–1990: Post disco and dance}}===
{{Main|Post-disco|Electronic dance music}}

The transition from the late-1970s disco styles to the early-1980s dance styles was marked primarily by the change from complex arrangements performed by [[big band|large ensembles]] of studio session musicians (including a [[horn section]] and an orchestral [[string section]]), to a leaner sound, in which one or two singers would perform to the accompaniment of [[synthesizer]] [[Keyboard instrument|keyboards]] and [[drum machine]]s.

In addition, [[dance music]] during the 1981–83 period borrowed elements from [[blues]] and [[jazz]], creating a style different from the disco of the 1970s. This emerging music was still known as disco for a short time, as the word had become associated with any kind of dance music played in [[discothèque]]s. Examples of early 1980s dance sound performers include [[D. Train]], [[Kashif (musician)|Kashif]], and [[Patrice Rushen]]. These changes were influenced by some of the notable R&amp;B and jazz musicians of the 1970s, such as Stevie Wonder, Kashif and [[Herbie Hancock]], who had pioneered &quot;[[Multi-instrumentalist|one-man-band]]&quot;-type keyboard techniques. Some of these influences had already begun to emerge during the mid-1970s, at the height of disco’s popularity.

During the first years of the 1980s, the disco sound began to be phased out, and faster tempos and synthesized effects, accompanied by guitar and simplified backgrounds, moved dance music toward the funk and pop genres. This trend can be seen in singer [[Billy Ocean]]'s recordings between 1979 and 1981. Whereas Ocean's 1979 song ''American Hearts'' was backed with an orchestral arrangement played by the [[Los Angeles Symphony Orchestra]], his 1981 song ''&quot;One of Those Nights (Feel Like Gettin' Down)&quot;'' had a more bare, stripped-down sound, with no orchestration or [[symphonic]] arrangements. This drift from the original disco sound is called [[post-disco]]. In this music scene there are rooted sub-genres, such as [[italo-disco]], [[techno]], [[house music|house]], [[dance-pop]], [[boogie (genre)|boogie]], and early [[alternative dance]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d13417|pure_url=yes}}|title=Explore music…Genre: Post-disco|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=2009-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 1980s, dance music dropped the complicated melodic structure and orchestration that typified the disco sound.

===TV themes===
During the 1970s, many TV theme songs were produced (or older themes updated) with disco influenced music. Examples include ''[[S.W.A.T. (TV Series)|S.W.A.T.]]'' (1975), ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (1976), ''NBC Saturday Night At The Movies'' (1976), ''[[The Love Boat]]'' (1977), ''[[The Donahue Show]]'' (1977), ''[[CHiPs]]'' (1977), ''[[The Professionals (TV series)|The Professionals]]'' (1977), ''[[Dallas (TV series)|Dallas]]'' (1978), ''[[Kojak]]'' (1978), ''[[The Hollywood Squares]]'' (1979). The British Science Fiction program ''[[Space: 1999]]'' (1975) also featured a soundtrack strongly influenced by disco. This was especially evident in the show's second season.

===DJ culture===
The rising popularity of disco came in tandem with developments in [[turntablism]] and the use of records to create a continuous mix of songs. The resulting [[DJ mix]] differed from previous forms of dance music, which were oriented towards live performances by musicians. This in turn affected the arrangement of dance music, with songs since the disco era typically containing beginnings and endings marked by a simple beat or riff that can be easily slipped into the mix.

===Rave culture===
{{main|Rave|Rave music}}

As the Disco era came to a close in the late 1970s, [[rave]] culture began to see significant growth. Rave culture incorporated disco culture's same love of dance music, drug exploration, sexual promiscuity, and [[hedonism]]. Although disco culture had thrived in the mainstream, the rave culture would make an effort to stay underground to avoid the animosity that was still surrounding disco and dance music.

===Hip hop and electro===
{{main|Hip hop music|Electro (music)}}

The disco sound had a strong influence on early [[hip hop music|hip hop]]. Most of the early rap/hip-hop songs were created by isolating existing disco bass-guitar lines and dubbing over them with MC rhymes. [[The Sugarhill Gang]] used [[Chic (band)|Chic]]'s &quot;[[Good Times (Chic song)|Good Times]]&quot; as the foundation for their 1979 hit &quot;[[Rapper's Delight]]&quot;, generally considered to be the song that first popularized rap music in the United States and around the world. In 1982, [[Afrika Bambataa]] released the single &quot;[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]&quot;, which incorporated [[electronica]] elements from [[Kraftwerk]]'s &quot;[[Trans-Europe Express (album)|Trans-Europe Express]]&quot; and &quot;Numbers&quot; as well as [[Yellow Magic Orchestra|YMO]]'s &quot;Riot in Lagos&quot;.

The Planet Rock sound also spawned a [[hip-hop]] [[Electronic dance music|electronic dance]] trend, [[electro music]], which included songs such as [[Planet Patrol]]'s &quot;Play at Your Own Risk&quot; (1982), C Bank's &quot;One More Shot&quot; (1982), [[Cerrone]]'s &quot;Club Underworld&quot; (1984), [[Shannon (singer)|Shannon]]'s &quot;[[Let the Music Play (song)|Let the Music Play]]&quot; (1983), [[Freeez]]'s &quot;I.O.U.&quot; (1983), [[Midnight Star]]'s &quot;Freak-a-Zoid&quot; (1983), [[Chaka Khan]]'s &quot;[[I Feel For You]]&quot; (1984).

===Post-punk {{Anchor|Post punk}}===
{{Main|Post-punk}}
The [[post-punk]] movement that originated in the late 1970s both supported [[punk rock]]'s rule breaking while rejecting its back to raw [[rock music]] element.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; Post-punk's mantra of constantly moving forward lent itself to both openness to and experimentation with elements of disco and other styles.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; [[Public Image Limited]] is considered the first post-punk group.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; The group's second album ''[[Metal Box]]'' fully embraced the studio as instrument methodology of disco.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; The group's founder [[John Lydon]] told the press that disco was the only music he cared for at the time. [[No Wave]] was a sub genre of post-punk centered in New York City.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt;

For shock value, [[James Chance]] who was a notable member of the No Wave scene penned an article in the [[East Village Eye]] urging his readers to move uptown and get &quot;trancin' with some superadioactive disco voodoo funk&quot;. His band [[James White and the Blacks]] wrote a disco album ''[[Off White]]''.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; Their performances resembled those of disco performers (horn section, dancers and so on).&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; In 1981 [[ZE Records]] led the transition from No Wave into the more subtle [[mutant disco]] ([[Post-disco#Dance-rock|post-disco/punk]]) genre.&lt;ref name=Reynolds/&gt; Mutant disco acts such as [[Kid Creole and the Coconuts]], [[Was Not Was]], [[ESG (band)|ESG]] and [[Liquid Liquid]] influenced several British post-punk acts such as [[New Order]], [[Orange Juice (band)|Orange Juice]] and [[A Certain Ratio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Reynolds&quot;&gt;Rip It Up and Start Again POSTPUNK 1978–1984 by [[Simon Reynolds]]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dance-punk====
{{main|Dance-punk}}
In the early 2000s the dance-punk ([[new rave]] in the United Kingdom) emerged as a part of a broader [[post punk revival]]. It fused elements of punk related rock with different forms of dance music including disco. [[Klaxons]], [[LCD Soundsystem]], [[Death From Above 1979]], [[The Rapture (band)|The Rapture]] and [[Shitdisco]] were among acts associated with the genre.&lt;ref&gt;M.
