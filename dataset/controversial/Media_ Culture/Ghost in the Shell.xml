==Plot==

===Setting===
{{main|List of Ghost in the Shell characters|World of Ghost in the Shell}}

''Ghost in the Shell'' is a futuristic [[police]] [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] dealing with the exploits of the cyborg [[Motoko Kusanagi]], a member of a covert operations division of the [[National Public Safety Commission (Japan)|Japanese National Public Safety Commission]] known as [[Public Security Section 9|Section 9]]. The unit specializes in fighting technology-related crimes. Although supposedly equal to all other members, Kusanagi fills the leadership role in the team, and is usually referred to as &quot;the Major&quot; due to her past rank in the [[Japanese Self-Defense Forces]]. She is capable of superhuman feats, and bionically specialized for her job — her body is almost completely mechanized; only her [[Human brain|brain]] and a segment of her spinal cord remain organic.

The setting of ''Ghost in the Shell'' is [[cyberpunk]] or [[postcyberpunk]]. Kusanagi and her colleagues face external threats and also suffer internal conflict over their own natures.

===Story===
''Ghost in the Shell'' revolves around Major [[Motoko Kusanagi]]'s hunt for a cyber-criminal known as &quot;The Puppeteer&quot; (known as [[Project 2501|The Puppet Master]] in the film), whose real identity is unknown. The Puppeteer commits a large number of crimes by the act of breaking into and taking control of human minds known as &quot;[[ghost hacking]]&quot;. As the agents of [[Public Security Section 9]] start to investigate, they discover The Puppeteer is a unique autonomous artificial intelligence project known as [[Project 2501]] created by another government agency, the Treaty Bureau of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] (MFA), also known as [[List of organizations in Ghost in the Shell#Other fictional organizations|Section 6]]. The Puppeteer escapes Section 6's control in pursuit of its evolution through merging with Kusanagi. Kusanagi, although initially skeptical, finally agrees to allow the Puppeteer to merge with her own consciousness, sharing her body, in what is no doubt intended to raise even more questions about the nature of human identity in a world where human consciousness is no longer individual.

''Ghost in the Shell 1.5: Human-Error Processor'' follows Section 9 and their covert ops investigations. In the chapter ''Fat Cat'' begins with a young woman who calls Section 9 to investigate her father's recent strange actions, and he turns out to be operated (through his electronic brain) by remote control. In the chapter, ''Drive Slave'', Chroma (a.k.a. [[Motoko Kusanagi|the Major]]) returns when her bounty hunt collides with Section 9's witness protection case. In the chapter, ''Mines of Mind'', a cyber-date gets interrupted by an arms dealer's murder, which leads to a cyborg shoot-out at the marina and the reappearance of an agent's old friend. In the chapter, ''Lost Past'', the investigation into a kidnapping gone wrong leads to a covert operation by another government department into Okinawa terrorism.
