'''Ali G''' (born '''Alistair Leslie Graham''') is a [[satire|satirical]] [[fictional character]] created and performed by English [[comedian]] [[Sacha Baron Cohen]]. Originally appearing on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[The 11 O'Clock Show]]'', as the [[title character]] of Channel 4's ''[[Da Ali G Show]]'' in 2000 and on [[HBO]] in 2003–2004, he is also the title character of the film ''[[Ali G Indahouse]]''. In December 2007, in an interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', Baron Cohen announced that Ali G, along with [[Borat Sagdiyev|Borat]], had been retired.&lt;ref name=&quot;shed&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.actressarchives.com/news/baron-cohen-borat-and-ali-g-are-dead-to-me|title=Borat and Ali G are dead for Sacha Baron Cohen|work=actressarchives.com|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=21 December 2007|accessdate=15 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also retired [[Brüno (character)|Brüno]].&lt;ref name=&quot;shed&quot;&gt;[http://digitaljournal.com/article/247826 Entertainment Sacha Baron Cohen to shed Borat persona for good] digitaljournal.com, 15 July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Ali G is a [[stereotype]] of a white suburban male from [[Staines]] (now [[Staines-upon-Thames]]) who imitates rap culture as well as urban British and Jamaican culture, particularly through [[hip hop]], [[reggae]], [[drum and bass]] and [[jungle music]]. Ali G was part of a group called Berkshire Massif, and he ran and grew up in an area of Slough called [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley]] (both actual locations in the UK). He also lived part of his life in [[Staines]]. Baron Cohen has stated that [[BBC Radio 1]] DJ [[Tim Westwood]] was an influence on the development of his character &amp;ndash; Westwood hosts Radio 1's Rap Show and speaks in a faux [[Multicultural London English]] and [[Hip-Hop]] dialect. Ali G's middle class credentials mirror Westwood's: the latter was brought up in [[Lowestoft]], [[Suffolk]] as a bishop's son.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone&quot;&gt;[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/sacha_baron_cohen_the_real_borat_finally_speaks/page/5 Sacha Baron Cohen - The Real Borat - finally speaks], ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]'', 14 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Prior to his character's appearance on ''[[The 11 O'Clock Show]]'', Baron Cohen had portrayed a similar character named MC Jocelyn Cheadle-Hume on a show he presented called [[F2F (TV series)|F2F]], which ran on a satellite channel called Talk TV (owned by [[Granada Television]]). While chatting to a group of skateboarders, in character, Baron Cohen realised that people could be led to believe his character was real, and filmed a number of segments which were ordered off air by [[London Weekend Television]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone&quot; /&gt;

==History and appearances==

Ali G, a boorish, uneducated, faux-streetwise [[poseur]] with a deeply stereotypical view of the world, first came to prominence on [[Channel 4]]'s ''[[The Eleven O'Clock Show]]'' as the &quot;voice of da yoof&quot; in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,1883923,00.html &quot;'He becomes the character, certainly with Ali G and Borat. He has a mix of Sellers's acting and Rod Hull's bottle'&quot;] by Kirsty Scott, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 29 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He interviewed various public figures in the United Kingdom, always either embarrassing his interviewee by displaying a mixture of uninformed [[political incorrectness]], or getting the interview 'victim' to agree to some breathtaking inaccuracy or insult.  His key saying is &quot;booyakasha&quot;.

Other examples of his bold interviewing style include getting [[Lindsay Urwin]], the [[Bishop of Horsham]], to admit that God created the Universe, and then asked him, &quot;And since then, [God]'s just chilled?&quot; Ali G asked the Bishop about God's appearance, to which the Bishop replied, &quot;Well, he's sort of Jesus-shaped.&quot;  During an interview with [[James Ferman]] (former director of the [[British Board of Film Classification]]), Ali G asks whether his made-up vulgarities would restrict a film to an over-18 audience, and suggests that [[film censorship]] be performed by younger persons who understand contemporary [[slang]]. In an interview with the Chairman of the [[Arts Council of England]] [[Gerry Robinson]] Ali G's first question was: ''&quot;Why is it that everything you fund is so crap?&quot;'' 

Ali G was in a series of ads for the [[2005–06 NBA season]], in which he used his brand of off-kilter journalism to interview various NBA stars. The spots were directed by [[Spike Lee]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Ali G was also featured in the music video &quot;[[Music (Madonna song)|Music]]&quot; by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] as her limo driver.{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Background==
Ali G is a [[fictional]] gang member of the &quot;West Staines Massif&quot;, who currently lives with his grandmother in a semi-detached house at 36 Cherry Blossom Close, in the heart of the &quot;Staines Ghetto&quot;. He was educated at what he calls &quot;da Matthew Arnold Skool&quot;; the [[Matthew Arnold School, Staines-upon-Thames|Matthew Arnold School]] is a real secondary school.  He also has a short stint at [[Vanguard College Preparatory School]].

[[Staines]], a working-class commuter town to the west of London, is far different from the [[inner city]] [[ghetto]] that Ali G claims. In the same comic vein, he also makes reference to other similar working-class towns in the area, such as [[Egham]], [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley]] and [[Englefield Green]]. Despite the incongruous nature of his home town, he purports to exemplify [[inner city]] culture. Ali's &quot;real&quot; name is later revealed to be '''Alistair Leslie Graham''' (revealed in the [[Ali G Indahouse|eponymous film]]).

Ali G speaks a comical patois in keeping with his delusions of being black of [[Jamaican]] ancestry and peppered with such catchphrases as &quot;Aight&quot; (alright), &quot;Booyakashan&quot;, &quot;Big up Yaself&quot;, &quot;Wagwaan&quot;, &quot;West Side&quot;, &quot;Batty Boy&quot; &quot;Respek&quot; (respect), &quot;For Real&quot;, &quot;Poonani&quot;, &quot;Check It&quot; and &quot;Keep It Real&quot;. His trademark hand gesture closely resembles the &quot;dip snap&quot;.

==Family==
Ali was born on a [[Council Estate]] to mother Tina. He has an older sister and an older brother. He has a younger sister and other younger siblings. When Ali was fifteen he went to live with his grandmother when his mother had another baby and there was no room for him and his older brother and sister, who went to live with their father. Ali's baby brothers are called Rory, Jamie and Guy.

==Criticisms of the character==
Although Baron Cohen has repeatedly stated that the Ali G character is a parody of suburban, privileged youth 'acting black', numerous commentators have opined that the force of the humour is derived from stereotypes of blacks, not poser whites.  According to this view of the character, the suburban background written into Ali G's character serves as a false alibi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article1117675.ece|title=Affronted feminist Naomi Wolf takes a bite out of 'racist' Ali G|date=9 March 2003|work=The Sunday Times | location=London | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4378509,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Race protest at Ali G's film premiere | first=Paul | last=Kelso | date=21 March 2002 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/ali-g-keepin-it-real-for-real-750201.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Ali G: Keepin' it real, for real | first=John | last=Walsh | date=16 March 2002 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The comedian Felix Dexter has said that he appreciated the humour of an innocent confronting an expert with neither understanding the other, but that 'I feel that a lot of the humour is laughing at black street culture and it is being celebrated because it allows the liberal middle classes to laugh at that culture in a safe context where they can retain their sense of [[political correctness]].'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2000/jan/11/race.janinegibson | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Comics find Ali G is an alibi for racism | first=Janine | last=Gibson | date=11 January 2000 | accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
