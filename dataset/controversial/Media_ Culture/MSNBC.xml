'''MSNBC''' (stylized as '''msnbc''') is a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] cable news and information channel based in the [[United States]] available in the US, [[Europe]], [[South Africa]], the Middle East and [[Canada]]. Its name was derived from the most common abbreviations for [[Microsoft|'''M'''icro'''s'''oft]] and [[NBC|the '''N'''ational '''B'''roadcasting '''C'''ompany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acronymfinder.com/MSNBC.html |title=MSNBC |publisher=Acronym Finder |date= |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MSNBC and msnbc.com were founded in 1996 as partnerships of [[Microsoft]] and [[General Electric]]'s NBC unit, which is now [[NBCUniversal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/07/business/media/07msnbc.html | work=The New York Times | first=Brian | last=Stelter | title=MSNBC on the Web May Change Its Name | date=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The online partnership of msnbc.com ended on July 16, 2012 and the site was rebranded as [[NBCNews.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brian Stelter |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/16/business/media/msnbccom-renamed-nbcnewscom-as-microsoft-and-nbc-divorce.html |title=Microsoft and NBC Complete Web Divorce |publisher=The New York Times |date=15 July 2012 |accessdate=9 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSNBC shares the [[NBC logos|NBC logo]] of a rainbow peacock with its sister channels NBC, [[CNBC]], [[NBC Sports Network]], and [[ShopNBC]].

Beginning in the mid-2000s, MSNBC assumed an increasingly [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] stance in its opinion programming. In October 2010, it publicly acknowledged this with a marketing campaign it called &quot;Lean Forward&quot;.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/06/business/media/06msnb.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;oref=slogin Cable Channel Nods to Ratings and Leans Left].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSNBC and Microsoft would share the cost of a $200 million newsroom in [[Secaucus, New Jersey]], for [[msnbc.com]]. NBC supplied the space with an 18-month-old ''[[America's Talking]]'' network.

=== Early history ===
{{Main|History of MSNBC: 1996–2007}}

MSNBC was launched on July 15, 1996. The first show, which was anchored by [[Jodi Applegate]], broadcast a lineup of news, interviews, and opinions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.ease.lsoft.com/scripts/wa.exe?A2=ind0404a&amp;L=wnn&amp;T=0&amp;P=1941 |title=Jodi Jodi Applegate WNYW biography |publisher=Home.ease.lsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the day, rolling news coverage continued with ''The Contributors'', a show that featured [[Ann Coulter]] and [[Laura Ingraham]], as well as interactive programming coordinated by Applegate, [[John Gibson (media host)|John Gibson]], and [[John Seigenthaler Jr.|John Seigenthaler]]. Stories were generally longer and more detailed than the stories running on [[CNN]] at the time. NBC also highlighted their broadcast connections by airing stories direct from the NBC network affiliates, along with breaking news coverage from the same sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=Scott|title=Crazy Like A Fox: The Inside Story of How Fox News Beat CNN|isbn=1-59184-029-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually MSNBC began to put more emphasis on politics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moss|first=Linda|title=MSNBC Shifts Shows|publisher=Cable World|date=July 2, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Project for Excellence in Journalism]] found in 2007 after a seven year survey of cable channels that &quot;MSNBC is moving to make politics a brand, with a large dose of opinion and personality.&quot;&lt;ref name=project&gt;[http://www.stateofthenewsmedia.org/2007/narrative_cabletv_publicattitudes.asp?cat=7&amp;media=6 The State of the News Media 2007: Public Attitudes]. [[Project for Excellence in Journalism]].&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2001, [[Mike Barnicle]] got a show on MSNBC, but it was canceled in June 2001 due to high production costs.&lt;ref&gt;E! Online, [http://groups.google.com/group/alt.gossip.celebrities/msg/2bc13270b0611cb3 Bits and Pieces], June 26, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; In June, in a sign of continuing trouble at MSNBC, Microsoft CEO [[Steve Ballmer]] said that he would not have started MSNBC if he knew then what he knows now.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.com.com/2100-1023-268073.html Ballmer: Would not launch MSNBC again]. CNET News.Com, June 7, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]], MSNBC served as an outlet for NBC News to provide up-to-the-minute coverage, in contrast to broadcast NBC's longer stories. CNBC and CNBC Europe, with little financial news to report, ran MSNBC for many hours of the day following the attacks. The year also boosted the profile of [[Ashleigh Banfield]], who had escaped injury while covering the World Trade Center on September 11. Her ''Region In Conflict'' program capitalized on her newfound celebrity and showcased exclusive interviews from [[Afghanistan]].

On December 23, 2005, it was announced that NBC Universal would acquire an additional 32% share of the television channel from Microsoft, solidifying its control over television operations and allowing NBC to further consolidate MSNBC's backroom operations with NBC News and its other cable properties. Msnbc.com (the website was a separate corporate entity from the television channel) would continue to be 50% owned by both NBC and Microsoft, and its operations would be largely unaffected. NBC would have the option, which it exercised, to buy the remaining 18% share of the television from Microsoft after two years. MSNBC, which along with other US news networks had been criticized of having a distorted and biased [[Media coverage of the Iraq War]] began from 2005 onwards to attract liberal and progressive viewers when host [[Keith Olbermann]] began critiquing and satirizing [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] media commentators in his program ''Countdown With Keith Olbermann''. Olbermann especially focused his attention to [[Fox News Channel]] and its main primetime commentator, [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]].

In June 2006, Don Kaplan of the tabloid [[New York Post]] (owned by [[News Corporation]], which also owns Fox News) wrote a column titled &quot;Do We Need MSNBC?&quot; Addressing MSNBC'S low ratings, Kaplan quoted [[CNN]] co-founder Reese Schonfeld, who said that &quot;[e]verybody compares MSNBC to [[Fox News Channel|Fox]] and [[CNN]]&amp;nbsp;— when its real competition is [[Headline News]]&quot;. Schonfeld pointed out that the ratings for MSNBC and Headline News are roughly the same, about 300,000 viewers on average and that &quot;by comparison, [[Fox News Channel|Fox]] and [[CNN]] regularly average three or four times as many viewers.&quot; In the column Kaplan remarked that &quot;the running joke in TV news is [[Fox News Channel|Fox]] and [[CNN]] are news channels with [[website]]s, but MSNBC is a website with a cable channel&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsbusters.org/node/5891], New York Post Columnist Asks 'Do We Need MSNBC?'&lt;/ref&gt; On June 7, 2006, Rick Kaplan resigned as president of MSNBC, after holding the post for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/msnbc/rick_kaplan_exits_effective_immediately_president_of_msnbc_steps_down_38122.asp|title=Rick Kaplan Exits: Effective Immediately, President Of MSNBC Steps Down|year=2006|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the announcement, it was announced on June 12, 2006, that [[Dan Abrams]], a nine-year veteran of MSNBC and NBC News, had been named General Manager of the NBC News [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour]] [[United States cable news|cable news]] television channel, effective immediately. NBC News Senior Vice President Phil Griffin would oversee MSNBC. Griffin would also continue to oversee NBC News’ ''Today'', and Abrams would report to Griffin.

On June 29, 2006, Abrams announced a revamp to MSNBC's early-primetime and primetime schedule. On July 10, ''[[Tucker (television program)|Tucker]]'' (formerly ''The Situation with Tucker Carlson'') started airing at 4 p.m. and 6 p.m. ET (taking over Abrams' old timeslot), while Rita Cosby's ''[[Rita Cosby: Live &amp; Direct|Live &amp; Direct]]'' was taken off the schedule. Cosby was instead given the role of primary anchor for ''MSNBC Investigates'' at 10 and 11 p.m. ET, a new program that took over Cosby and Carlson's timeslots. According to the press release, ''MSNBC Investigates'' promised to &quot;...complement MSNBC's existing programming by building on [the channel's] library of award winning documentaries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcumv.com/release_detail.nbc/msnbc-20060629000000-msnbcannouncesprim.html|title=MSNBC Announcement|date=2006-06-29|accessdate=2008-01-23}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move to taped programming during 10 and 11 p.m. was likely a result of the success that MSNBC saw with their Friday &quot;experiment&quot; of replacing all primetime programming with taped specials. On September 24, 2007, Abrams announced that he would leave the position of General Manager to focus on his 9:00 p.m. ET talk show, &quot;Live With Dan Abrams&quot;. Oversight of MSNBC is now provided by Phil Griffin, a senior vice president at [[NBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kurtz|first=Howard|title=MSNBC's Abrams Quits His Day Job|publisher=The Washington Post|date=September 25, 2007|page=C03|authorlink=Howard Kurtz}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:111907l.jpg|thumb|right|MSNBC's current studio in NYC]]
[[Image:111907g.jpg|thumb|right|The current MSNBC studio]]

MSNBC and NBC News launched broadcasts from their new studios at NBC's &quot;[[GE Building|30 Rock]]&quot; complex in New York City on October 22, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/nbc/nbc_news_to_begin_broadcasting_from_new_world_headquarters_oct_22_68821.asp|title=NBC News to Begin Broadcasting from New World Headquarters|date=2007-10-22|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; After extensive renovations of the associated studios, NBC essentially merged its entire news operation into one building, and all MSNBC broadcasts, as well as the ''[[NBC Nightly News]] program'', originate in the new studios. More than 12.5 hours of live television across the NBC News family originate from the New York studios daily. MSNBC is also expected to expand West Coast operations, as the channel recently{{When|date=February 2011}} announced new studios near the Universal Studios lot, which will assemble all NBC West Coast news operations in one building. MSNBC's Master Control did not make the move to 30 Rock. It remained in the old Secaucus headquarters until it completed its move to the NBC Universal Network Origination Center located inside the CNBC Global Headquarters building in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey, on December 21, 2007. Shortly thereafter, [[Major League Baseball]] firmed up a long-term lease of the former MSNBC building to become the home studios of [[MLB Network]], which launched from the facility on January 1, 2009.

=== Changes since 2008 ===
{{Main|History of MSNBC: 2008–present}}

From mid-2007 to mid-2008, MSNBC received a large increase in its [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]].&lt;ref name=Kurtz&gt;{{cite news |last=Kurtz |first=Howard |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/05/27/AR2008052703047_pf.html |title=MSNBC, Leaning Left And Getting Flak From Both Sides |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2008-05-28 |accessdate=2008-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Primetime viewings increased by 61% over that time.&lt;ref name=Kurtz/&gt; In May 2008, NBC News President [[Steve Capus]] said that &quot;It used to be people didn't have to worry about MSNBC because it was an also-ran cable channel.... That's not the case anymore.&quot;&lt;ref name=Kurtz/&gt; [[Tim Russert]]'s sudden death in June 2008 removed what ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' called the &quot;[[rudder]] for the network&quot; and led to a period of transition.&lt;ref name=live&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB121989105850778775.html?mod=blog MSNBC Anchors' Fights Go Live]. ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''. Published August 28, 2008. Retrieved August 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential election]], MSNBC's coverage was anchored by [[Keith Olbermann]], [[Chris Matthews]], and [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]]. The three were widely viewed as the face of the channel's political coverage.&lt;ref name=live/&gt; During the first three months of the presidential campaign, MSNBC's ratings grew by 158 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbsnews.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Font size Print E-mail Share 13 Comments |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/11/24/business/marketwatch/main4628803.shtml |title=At MSNBC, The 'M' Is For (Rachel) Maddow |publisher=CBS News |date=2008-11-24 |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during the election coverage, anchors Keith Olbermann and [[Chris Matthews]] were criticized for expressing left-leaning viewpoints on the channel, and both of them were later removed from the position of anchor.&lt;ref name=&quot;ko cm removed&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/08/business/media/08msnbc.html|title=MSNBC Takes Incendiary Hosts From Anchor Seat|last=Stelter|first=Brian|date=September 7, 2008|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=March 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audience viewership during the 2008 Presidential election more than doubled from the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential election]], and the channel topped [[CNN]] in ratings for the first time during the last three months of the campaign in the key 25-54 age demographic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/arts/television/15netw.html | work=The New York Times | title=Election's Over, So What's Next for the Cable News Channels? | first=Bill | last=Carter | date=November 15, 2008 | accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/08/business/media/08msnbc.html?pagewanted=1&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink | work=The New York Times | title=MSNBC Takes Incendiary Hosts From Anchor Seat | first=Brian | last=Stelter | date=September 8, 2008 | accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, the channel hired [[political analyst]] and [[Air America Radio]] personality [[Rachel Maddow]] to host a new political opinion program called ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]''. The move to create a new program for the channel was widely seen as a smart ratings move, where beforehand, MSNBC lagged behind in coveted primetime ratings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/11/24/business/marketwatch/main4628803.shtml At MSNBC, The 'M' Is For (Rachel) Maddow MarketWatch Columnist Jon Friedman Says Network's New Star Is Opinionated, But Restrained] ''CBS News'.'

During this time, MSNBC also became the number-one cable news network in primetime among both African American and Hispanic viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

On 11 October 2010, MSNBC unveiled a new televised advertising campaign and slogan called &quot;Lean Forward&quot;. &quot;We've taken on CNN and we beat them,&quot; MSNBC President Phil Griffin told employees at a series of celebratory &quot;town hall&quot; meetings. &quot;Now it's time to take on Fox.&quot; Concerning the campaign, Griffin said, &quot;It is active, it is positive, it is about making tomorrow better than today, a discussion about politics and the actions and passions of our time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mediabistro.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/lean-forward-campaign-phil-griffi_b33894 Phil Griffin: 'Lean Forward' Campaign 'Is Going to Define Us As MSNBC'] ''Media Bistro'' Retrieved 2010-10-13&lt;/ref&gt; The new campaign embraces the network's politically progressive identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc.msn.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/39507182/ns/business-media_biz/ Msnbc to ‘lean forward’ in two-year brand campaign] ''MSNBC'' Retrieved 2010-10-13&lt;/ref&gt; The two-year advertising campaign will cost $2 million and will consist of Internet, television, and print advertising.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediabistro.com&quot;/&gt; The new positioning has created brand image issues for msnbc.com, the umbrella website for the television network.

== Carriage issues ==
[[Image:MSNBC NJ HQ Studio 1.jpg|thumb|MSNBC's former New Jersey headquarters studio, now the home of [[MLB Network]]]]
Prior to 2010, MSNBC was not available to [[Verizon FiOS]] and [[AT&amp;T U-verse]] TV subscribers in portions of [[New York]], northern [[New Jersey]], and [[Connecticut]] that overlapped [[Cablevision]]'s territory. One of several reasons for this lack of availability was an exclusive carriage agreement between MSNBC and Cablevision which prohibited competing wired providers from carrying MSNBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidecable.blogsome.com/2007/02/22/cablevision-has-exclusive-fios-deal-with-msnbc-in-nyc// |title=Inside Cable News :: Cablevision has exclusive carriage deal with MSNBC... :: February :: 2007 |publisher=Insidecable.blogsome.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms of the agreement were not publicly known.

In 2009, Verizon petitioned the FCC with a formal &quot;program-access complaint&quot; to terminate the deal. Connecticut attorney general Richard Blumenthal also argued that the arrangement could be illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/314875-Cablevision_Hit_On_Exclusives_.php |title=Cablevision Hit On 'Exclusives’ - 2009-07-11 06:00:00 &amp;#124; Multichannel News |publisher=Multichannel.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reaching a new contract, FiOS added the channel in New York City and in New Jersey on February 2, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/article/446360-FiOS_TV_Finally_Gets_MSNBC_In_NY_DMA.php  FiOS TV Finally Gets MSNBC In NY DMA - Cablevision Loses Exclusive Terrestrial Distribution Rights To News Channel] ''Multichannel News'' January 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== High Definition ==
'''MSNBC HD''' is a [[1080i]] [[HDTV|high definition]] simulcast of MSNBC that launched on June 29, 2009. All studio shows and select long form programs air in HD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/307006-MSNBC_s_Hi_Def_Retrofit.php MSNBC's Hi-Def Retrofit - 30 Rock control room, Washington D.C. studio get major HD overhaul] ''Broadcasting &amp; Cable'' June 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Comcast]] has also added MSNBC HD in several markets, {{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} though this seems to be on a market-to-market addition in which they add the channel one market at a time instead of adding the channel to all markets in one move, leaving some customers (e.g. in Virginia) still without access.

[[Charter Communications]] has launched MSNBC HD in numerous markets.

In Canada, [[Bell TV]] and Bell FibeTV are currently offering MSNBC HD.

==Graphics==
Prior to 2009, MSNBC used a graphic scheme which contained highly angular shapes. 

Beginning on June 29, 2009, MSNBC officially launched a new graphic scheme co-created by Adam Gault Studios and Carlo Vega, whereby a newly redesigned MSNBC logo, current series title, time, stocks number and (when necessary) &quot;live&quot; bug were moved to the top of the screen, leaving the [[lower thirds]] to be used by the news ticker, story title and short summary, the last of which is replaced frequently by the name of the guest or correspondent currently being shown. For a short time in 2009 from the debut, MSNBC HD daytime included a widget on the right side of the screen which served as a secondary news ticker displaying the weather and news headlines as well as a blue bar which showed more stocks and business news graphics, but both features were eventually dropped in favor of full video encompassing both sides of the screen; the widget reflected a similar widget which appears on [[CNBC]] HD for the display of a stocks graph chart (and which has been retained to the present day). The news ticker only appears during news bulletins and rolling-news broadcasts, and is removed from the screen during talk shows and documentaries.

== International broadcasts ==
[[Image:111907f.jpg|thumb|left|The monitors of the MSNBC newsroom are tuned in to various global channels.]]
MSNBC is shown only in the United States, Canada, South Africa,Kenya, parts of Latin America, and parts of Northern Africa (see below).

=== MSNBC Canada ===
In 2001, a Canadian version with some local content, [[MSNBC Canada]], was developed; however, it was soon discontinued in 2004, and the American version began airing in Canada. The channel was operated by [[Rogers Communications]] and co-owned by Rogers, [[Shaw Communications|Shaw]] and MSNBC, with each party owned a 33.33% voting interest in the service. The channel launched on September 7, 2001.

Programming included MSNBC programs as well as repeats of shows from the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]] and [[Cable Public Affairs Channel]], as its way to fulfil its [[Canadian content]] requirements. They also ran infomercials, which the American service never shows.

=== MSNBC Africa ===
In Southern Africa, MSNBC is distributed free-to-air on satellite on Free2View TV as MSNBC Africa, a joint venture between Great Media Limited and MSNBC. Free2View airs MSNBC's programming from 4 p.m. to midnight ET in a block that repeats twice (live for the first airing), with local Weather Channel forecasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidecable.blogsome.com/2007/11/17/southern-africa-to-get-msnbc/|title=Southern Africa to Get MSNBC|date=2007-11-17|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Botswana's national television broadcaster, BTV, also provides an un-edited broadcast of MSNBC (including advertisements) after their scheduled programming each evening. BTV is available within Botswana, as well as to Southern Africa viewers on [[DStv]]. [[TopTV]], a satellite TV service in South Africa, also provides an un-edited broadcast of MSNBC (including advertisements), which runs throughout the day (24/7). It is also available in Kenya through the cable service Zuku.

=== Europe and Asia ===
In Asia and Europe, MSNBC is not shown on a channel of its own. When MSNBC started in 1996 they announced plans to start broadcasting in Europe during 1997. This never happened; however, MSNBC is shown for a few hours a day on the 24 hour news network [[OSN News]] in Europe and the Middle East. OSN News is a network of three 24 hour satellite and cable channels offering exclusively [[United States|American]] news programming from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[NBC]], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], and MSNBC to U.S. expats and other viewers abroad, primarily geared towards an audience in the Arab countries.

[[NBC Nightly News]] is shown on [[CNBC Europe]] at 00:30 CET.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnbc.com/id/15838587/ NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams - CNBC] ''CNBC'.' Retrieved 2010-4-27.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[breaking news]] events, [[CNBC-e]], MSNBC is also shown occasionally on affiliate channel CNBC Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/15910671|title=About CNBC Europe|year=2008|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NTV-MSNBC ===
In Turkey, NTV-MSNBC is the news channel of the Turkish broadcaster [[NTV Turkey]]. The channel is a joint partnership between the two, although very little Turkish content makes its way onto English MSNBC. English content on MSNBC is translated to Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntvmsnbc.com|title=NTVMSNBC.com|year=2008|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NBCNews.com is the online news outlet for the [[NBC News]] family, including network shows such as ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'', ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'', and ''[[Dateline NBC]]'', as well as MSNBC TV. In addition to NBC News content and material produced by the site's own staff, NBCNews.com also hosts articles and features from several partners, including ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine.  

According to [[Nielsen Online]], NBCNews.com has risen above [[Yahoo! News]] and [[CNN]] for the position of top news site from June 2008 through May 2009, measured by unique visitors in the U.S.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003985743 |title=Top 30 news sites for May— Editor &amp; Publisher |publisher=Editorandpublisher.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, after [[NBCUniversal]] acquired [[Microsoft]]'s fifty percent share in msnbc, it took full ownership of the msnbc name and  rebranded msnbc.com as NBCNews.com.  NBC will relaunch msnbc.com and give the cable channel its own website in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NBC News Takes Back MSNBC.com From Microsoft|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/487235-NBC_News_Takes_Back_MSNBC_com_From_Microsoft.php|publisher=Broadcasting &amp; Cable|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The channel launched on [[XM Satellite Radio]] channel 120 and [[Sirius Satellite Radio]] channel 90 on April 12, 2010.&lt;ref name=radio&gt;[http://www.multichannel.com/article/451180-MSNBC_Signs_On_With_Sirius_XM_Radio.php MSNBC Signs On With Sirius XM Radio - News Channel To Debut On Satellite Service April 12] ''Multichannel News'' April 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  This is the second time MSNBC has been on satellite radio; the channel has been on XM before, but was subsequently dropped from the service on September 4, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orbitcast.com/archives/xm-and-msnbc-part-ways.html XM and MSNBC part ways] ''Orbitcast'' April 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism and controversy ==
{{Main| MSNBC Controversies}} 
=== Assertions of liberal bias ===
Commentators have described MSNBC as having a bias towards left-leaning politics and the Democratic Party. In November 2007, a ''[[New York Times]]'' article stated that MSNBC's [[primetime|prime-time lineup]] is tilting more to the left.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;/&gt; ''[[Washington Post]]'' media analyst [[Howard Kurtz]] has stated that the channel's evening lineup &quot;has clearly gravitated to the left in recent years and often seems to regard itself as the antithesis of [[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]&quot;&lt;ref name=Kurtz/&gt; (in reference to a number of [[journalist]]s and [[political pundit]]s considering Fox News to have a ''conservative'' bias in some programs). In 2011, ''[[Salon.com]]'' noted that &quot;MSNBC’s prime-time lineup is now awash in [[Contemporary progressivism|progressive]] politics.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kornacki, Steve (2011-01-21) [http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/01/21/countdown_rip/index.html Is Olbermann the victim of his own success?], ''[[Salon.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, ''[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]'' referred to MSNBC as &quot;left-leaning.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barr, Andy (2011-04-05) [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0411/52608.html MSNBC host coaxes Ron Paul to run], ''[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In reference to changes in the channel's evening programming, senior vice president of [[NBC News]] [[Phil Griffin (presenter)|Phil Griffin]] has said that &quot;it happened naturally. There isn't a dogma we're putting through. There is a 'Go for it.'&quot;&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

In the February 2008 issue of ''Men's Journal'' [[magazine]], a MSNBC interviewee quoted a senior executive who said that liberal commentator [[Keith Olbermann]] &quot;runs MSNBC&quot; and that &quot;because of his success, he's in charge&quot; of the channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/msnbc/olbermann_talks_office_politics_other_politics_74648.asp|publisher=mediabistro.com:|title=Olbermann Talks Office Politics, Other Politics|date=January 10, 2008|accessdate=2009-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 ''[[The New York Times]]'' called Olbermann MSNBC's &quot;most recognizable face&quot;.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt; In September 2008, MSNBC stated that they were removing both [[Keith Olbermann]] and [[Chris Matthews]] as live political event anchors, and replacing them with [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]], due to growing criticism that they were &quot;too opinionated to be seen as neutral in the heat of the presidential campaign.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt; Olbermann continued to broadcast ''Countdown'' both before and after the presidential and vice-presidential debates, and both Matthews and Olbermann joined Gregory on the channel's election night coverage. 

On November 13, 2009, in the days leading up to the release of [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008]] Republican vice-presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]]'s book ''[[Going Rogue: An American Life|Going Rogue]]'', MSNBC's [[Dylan Ratigan]] used [[photoshopping|photoshopped]] pictures of Palin on the channel's ''[[Morning Meeting]]'' program. Ratigan apologized a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=1:40 pm November 16, 2009, by Jay |url=http://blogs.ajc.com/jay-bookman-blog/2009/11/16/msnbc-apologizes-for-showing-fake-palin-photos/?cxntfid=blogs_jay_bookman_blog |title=MSNBC apologizes for showing fake Palin photos &amp;#124; Jay Bookman |publisher=Blogs.ajc.com |date=2009-11-16 |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, MSNBC began using the tagline &quot;lean forward&quot;, which was described by some media outlets, including [[msnbc.com]], as the network embracing its politically progressive identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc.msn.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =| first =| title =MSNBC's new slogan: What does it even mean? | publisher =''[[The Week]]''| date =2010-10-06| url =http://theweek.com/article/index/207856/msnbcs-new-slogan-what-does-it-even-mean| accessdate =2010-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =Stelter| first =Brian| title =With Tagline, MSNBC Embraces a Political Identity| publisher =''[[The New York Times]]''| date =2010-10-04| url =http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/05/business/media/05adco.html| accessdate =2010-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Miller| first =Emily| title =NBC Flees from Lefty MSNBC Cable Network | publisher =''[[Human Events]]''| date =2010-10-08| url =http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=39332| accessdate =2010-10-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In January 2012, MSNBC used Rachel Maddow, Chris Matthews and other network commentators during coverage of the [[Iowa Republican caucuses, 2012|2012 Iowa Republican caucuses]], a move seen by Nando Di Fino of the Mediaite website  as &quot;giving up on the straight news coverage, and instead [appearing] to be aiming to create some controversy.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Di Fino|first=Nando|title=MSNBC Hosting Lineup For Iowa Caucus Exchanges Neutral Journalism For Partisanship… And Fun|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/msnbc-hosting-lineup-for-iowa-caucus-exchanges-neutral-journalism-for-partisanship-and-fun/|publisher=Mediaite|accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pro-Obama bias ===
Some Democratic Party supporters, most notably former Democratic Governor of [[Pennsylvania]], [[Ed Rendell]] and [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] advisor [[Lanny Davis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sheppard/2008/05/09/clinton-confidant-chris-matthews-shamelessly-biased-doesnt-care |title=Clinton Confidant: MSNBC, Chris Matthews 'Shamelessly Biased' |publisher=NewsBusters.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; criticized MSNBC during and after the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic Primaries]], as covering [[Barack Obama]] more favorably than [[Hillary Clinton]]. Rendell said, &quot;MSNBC was the official network of the Obama campaign,&quot; and called their coverage &quot;absolutely embarrassing.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rendell&gt;[http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0808/Rendell_Obama_coverage_was_embarrassing.html Rendell: Obama coverage was embarrassing]. [[Politico.com]]. Published August 24, 2008.

''[[The New Republic]]'' Published May 27, 2008. Retrieved August 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study done by the [[Project for Excellence in Journalism]] showed that MSNBC had less negative coverage of Obama (14% of stories vs. 29% in the press overall) and more negative stories about Republican presidential candidate [[John McCain]] (73% of its coverage vs. 57% in the press overall).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=October 29, 2008 |url=http://www.journalism.org/node/13436 |title=The Color of News &amp;#124; Project for Excellence in Journalism (PEJ) |publisher=Journalism.org |date=2008-10-29 |accessdate=2010-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSNBC's on-air slogan during the week of the 2008 presidential election, &quot;The Power of Change&quot;, was criticized as being overtly similar to Obama's campaign slogan of &quot;Hope and Change.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/10/business/media/10msnbc.html |title=MSNBC's Tag for Now: 'The Power of Change' |last=Stelter |first= Brian |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2008-11-10 |accessdate=2008-11-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]], conservative talk-show host, [[John Ziegler (talk show host)|John Ziegler]] worked on a documentary called ''Media Malpractice.... How Obama Got Elected'', which was very critical of the media, especially MSNBC's role, in the [[2008 Presidential Election]]. While promoting the documentary, he engaged in an on-air dispute with MSNBC news anchor [[Contessa Brewer]], on how the media, especially MSNBC, had portrayed [[Sarah Palin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://popwatch.ew.com/popwatch/2009/06/contessa-brewer-vs-john-ziegler-cut-the-mic.html |title=Contessa Brewer vs. John Ziegler re: Sarah Palin -- 'Cut the mic, please' |author=Annie Barrett |date=June 10, 2009 |work=PopWatch Blog |publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |accessdate=November 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During MSNBC's coverage of the Potomac primary, MSNBC's Chris Matthews said, &quot;I have to tell you, you know, it's part of reporting this case, this election, the feeling most people get when they hear Barack Obama's speech. My, I felt this thrill going up my leg. I mean, I don't have that too often. ” This led many on the right to assert that both he and MSNBC were biased toward Obama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,483568,00.html |title=Bernie Goldberg on 'Love Affair' Between Obama and Media&amp;nbsp;— Hannity |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=2009-01-27 |accessdate=2010-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Phil Donahue Iraq War dismissal ===
{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=[Donahue presents a] difficult public face for [[NBC]] in a time of war...He seems to delight in presenting guests who are [[anti-war]], anti-Bush and skeptical of the administration's motives.|source= —NBC internal study&lt;ref name=AllYourTV&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allyourtv.com/0203season/news/02252003donahue.html |title=Commentary: The Surrender Of MSNBC |publisher=AllYourTV.com |date=February 25, 2003 |first=Rick |last=Ellis}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} 
{{see also|Media coverage of the Iraq War}}

[[Phil Donahue]]'s 2002 program ''[[Donahue (MSNBC program)|Donahue]]'' was canceled in late February 2003 during the buildup to the [[Iraq War]]. Despite earlier claims of cancellation because of low ratings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/02/25/entertainment/main542005.shtml |title=Phil Donahue Gets The Ax, MSNBC Cancels Donahue's Talk Show Due To Low Ratings |publisher=CBS News |date=February 25, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Donahue'' was MSNBC's highest rated show that month.&lt;ref name=AllYourTV&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

A leaked NBC internal study revealed that the studio was concerned that Donahue would act as &quot;a home for the liberal antiwar agenda at the same time that our competitors are waving the flag at every opportunity.&quot;&lt;ref name=AllYourTV&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Michael Savage dismissal ===
During the spring and early summer of 2003, MSNBC featured a weekend talk show hosted by conservative radio host [[Michael Savage (commentator)|Michael Savage]]. In July of that year, Savage responded to a prank caller on his show by calling him a &quot;pig&quot; and a &quot;sodomite&quot;, and telling him he &quot;should get [[AIDS]] and die.&quot; Savage's show was canceled and Savage was fired from the channel shortly afterward (with some reports placing the termination immediately after the episode in question went off air).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowry|first= Brian|title=Savage gets the boot after on-air anti-gay  outburst|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=July 8, 2003|page=E1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Don Imus controversy ===
In early April 2007, [[Don Imus]], whose radio show ''[[Imus in the Morning]]'' was simulcast on MSNBC, described members of the [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights#Women's basketball|Rutgers University women's basketball team]], as &quot;some nappy-headed hoes.&quot; The comments sparked outrage, as many considered them to be racist and sexist. After sponsors began to withdraw advertisements from the show, MSNBC canceled the simulcast. Imus, as well as NBC News, apologized to the Rutgers Basketball team for the remarks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17999196/ MSNBC drops simulcast of Don Imus show]. msnbc.com. 11 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Don Imus now has a feature show on the Fox Business Network.

=== &quot;Rise of the New Right&quot; documentary ===
In June 2010, a documentary airing on MSNBC and hosted by Chris Matthews called ''Rise of the New Right'' drew significant criticism from conservatives and the [[Tea Party movement]]. The documentary features interviews with [[Dick Armey]], the former House Majority Leader, [[Orly Taitz]], a leading figure in the &quot;[[birther]]&quot; movement, and radio host [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]]. The documentary also showed the [[Michigan Militia]]’s survival training camp and hit the campaign trail with Kentucky Senatorial candidate [[Rand Paul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Weigel| first =David| title =MSNBC documentary on the 'New Right' profiles birthers, militias, Alex Jones| publisher =The Washington Post| date =2010-06-07| url =http://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-now/2010/06/upcoming_msnbc_documentary_on.html| accessdate =2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the documentary aired, [[FreedomWorks]], which is chaired by one of the stars of the documentary, [[Dick Armey]], issued a letter calling for a boycott of [[Dawn (brand)|Dawn]] and [[Procter &amp; Gamble]], which advertises during ''Hardball with Chris Matthews''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Weigel| first =David| title =Tea partyers push back against 'The Rise of the New Right' with boycott| publisher =The Washington Post| date =2010-06-17| url =http://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-now/2010/06/tea_partyers_push_back_against.html| accessdate =2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Montopoli| first =Brian| title =Tea Party Groups Lash Out at MSNBC Over Special| publisher =CBS News| date =2010-06-17| url =http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20008106-503544.html| accessdate =2010-06-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The boycott was ineffective. [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] continued to advertise with the show.

=== Suspensions of hosts: Olbermann's separation ===
On November 5, 2010, MSNBC President Phil Griffin suspended Olbermann indefinitely without pay for contributing $2,400 (the maximum personal donation limit) to each of three Democratic candidates during the 2010 midterm election cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Aujla, Simmi.  &quot;Keith Olbermann suspended after donating to Democrats.&quot; Politico.com.  5 Nov 2010 &lt;http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1110/44734.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  Contributions to political campaigns, under NBC News policy, are not allowed without prior permission. On November 7, 2010, Olbermann posted a thank you message to supporters via Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By KEVIN DOLAK and RUSSELL GOLDMAN (@GoldmanRussell) |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/keith-olbermann-breaks-silence-twitter-feed/story?id=12082531 |title=Keith Olbermann Can Return to 'Countdown,' MSNBC Boss Says&amp;nbsp;— ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2010-11-07 |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same day, MSNBC announced that he would be back on the air starting Tuesday, November 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcuniversal.presscentre.com/Content/Detail.aspx?ReleaseID=2458&amp;NewsAreaID=2&amp;ClientID=7 |title=NBC Media Centre&amp;nbsp;— STATEMENT REGARDING KEITH OLBERMANN&amp;nbsp;— SUNDAY, NOV. 7 |publisher=Nbcuniversal.presscentre.com |date=2010-11-07 |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two weeks later, Griffin announced the suspension of Joe Scarborough for the same offense, as the ''Morning Joe'' host had donated $4,000 to Republican candidates in Florida. Like Olbermann's suspension, Scarborough's suspension was brief, and he returned to the airwaves on November 24.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/11/19/msnbc-suspends-morning-joe-host-scarborough-for-political-donations/ &quot;MSNBC Suspends ‘Morning Joe’ Host Scarborough for Political Donations&quot;] ''Wall Street Journal'' November 19, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 21, 2011 MSNBC announced that Olbermann would host his final show that same night.
