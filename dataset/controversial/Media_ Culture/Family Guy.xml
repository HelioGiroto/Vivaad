'''''Family Guy''''' is an American [[animated sitcom]] created by [[Seth MacFarlane]] for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. The series centers on the [[Griffin family|Griffins]], a [[dysfunctional family]] consisting of parents [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Lois Griffin|Lois]]; their children [[Meg Griffin|Meg]], [[Chris Griffin|Chris]], and [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]]; and their [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] pet dog [[Brian Griffin|Brian]]. The show is set in the fictional city of [[Quahog, RI|Quahog]], [[Rhode Island]], and exhibits much of its humor in the form of [[cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaway gags]] that often lampoon [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].

The family was conceived by MacFarlane after developing two animated films, ''[[The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve|The Life of Larry]]'' and ''[[The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve|Larry &amp; Steve]]''. MacFarlane redesigned the films' protagonist, Larry, and his dog, Steve, and renamed them Peter and Brian, respectively. MacFarlane pitched a seven-minute pilot to Fox on May 15, 1998. The show was given the green light and started production. Shortly after the third season of ''Family Guy'' aired in 2001, Fox canceled the series and went to a hiatus. However, favorable DVD sales and high [[Nielsen ratings|rating]]s for syndicated reruns on [[Adult Swim]] convinced the network to renew the show in 2004.

''Family Guy'' has been nominated for 12 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s and 11 [[Annie Award]]s, and has won three of each. In 2009, it was nominated for an Emmy for [[61st Primetime Emmy Awards|Outstanding Comedy Series]], the first time an animated series was nominated for the award since ''[[The Flintstones]]'' in 1961. ''Family Guy'' has also received criticism, including unfavorable comparisons for its similarities to ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

Many [[tie-in]] media have been released, including ''[[Stewie Griffin: The Untold Story]]'', a [[Direct-to-video|straight-to-DVD]] special released in 2005; ''[[Family Guy: Live in Vegas]]'', a soundtrack-DVD combo released in 2005, featuring music from the show as well as original music created by MacFarlane and [[Walter Murphy]]; a [[Family Guy Video Game!|video game]] and [[Family Guy (pinball)|pinball machine]], released in 2006 and 2007, respectively; since 2005, six books published by [[HarperCollins|Harper Adult]] based on the ''Family Guy'' universe; and ''[[Laugh It Up, Fuzzball: The Family Guy Trilogy]]'' (2010), a series of parodies of the [[Star Wars original trilogy|original ''Star Wars'' trilogy]]. In 2008, MacFarlane confirmed that the cast was interested in producing a feature film and that he was working on a story for a film adaptation. A spin-off series, ''[[The Cleveland Show]]'', premiered on September 27, 2009, as a part of the &quot;[[Animation Domination]]&quot; lineup on Fox. The eighth season of ''Family Guy'' premiered the same night. ''Family Guy'' holds a [[TV-PG]] and [[TV-14]] rating, with the latter being used more often.

==Origins==
{{Main|The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve}}
MacFarlane initially conceived ''Family Guy'' in 1995 while studying animation at the [[Rhode Island School of Design]] (RISD).&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenburg&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lenburg|first=Jeff|title=Who's Who in Animated Cartoons: An International Guide to Film &amp; Television's Award-Winning and Legendary Animators|publisher=Applause Theatre &amp; Cinema Books|location=New York|year=2006|edition=Illustrated|page=221|isbn=978-1-55783-671-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; During college, he created his thesis film entitled ''[[The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve#The Life of Larry|The Life of Larry]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenburg&quot;/&gt; which was submitted by his professor at RISD to [[Hanna-Barbera]]. MacFarlane was hired by the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;harvard&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Lenburg|first=Jeff|title= &quot;Family Guy&quot; Seth MacFarlane to speak at Class Day: Creator and executive producer of 'Family Guy' will headline undergraduate celebration|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2006/05.11/03-classday.html|work=[[Harvard Gazette]]|accessdate=December 21, 2007|date=May 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 MacFarlane created a sequel to ''The Life of Larry'' entitled ''[[Larry shorts|Larry and Steve]]'', which featured a middle-aged character named Larry and an intellectual dog, Steve; the short was broadcast in 1997 as one of [[Cartoon Network (United States)|Cartoon Network]]'s ''[[What-A-Cartoon!|World Premiere Toons]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenburg&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Larry &amp; Steve titlecard.png|200px|thumb|left|alt=An elder white-haired cartoon man with a white shirt and blue jeans next to a brown furred cartoon dog holding a book with a red background|Larry (left) and Steve (right) as they appeared in ''[[The Life of Larry and Larry &amp; Steve#Larry &amp; Steve (1997)|Larry &amp; Steve]]'' (1997), an animated short directed by Seth MacFarlane. Larry and Steve would form the basis for the ''Family Guy'' characters of [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Brian Griffin|Brian]], respectively.]]

Executives at [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] saw the ''Larry'' shorts and contracted MacFarlane to create a series, entitled ''Family Guy'', based on the characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartlett&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://greatreporter.com/mambo/content/view/1383/11/|title = Seth MacFarlane&amp;nbsp;– he’s the &quot;Family Guy&quot;|accessdate =December 31, 2007|last = Bartlett|first = James|date = March 12, 2007|work = The Great Reporter|publisher = Presswire Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox proposed MacFarlane complete a 15-minute short, and gave him a budget of $50,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;megadeal&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Nellie|last=Andreeva|title=&quot;Family Guy&quot; creator seals megadeal|date=May 5, 2008|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSN0435504220080505|accessdate=May 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several aspects of ''Family Guy'' were inspired by the ''Larry shorts''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Callaghan, p. 16&quot;&gt;[[#Callaghan|Callaghan]], p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; While working on the series, the characters of Larry and his dog Steve slowly evolved into Peter and Brian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartlett&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AWN&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.awn.com/news/events/cartoon-network-pilots-screened-asifa-east-nycs-school-visual-arts|title=Cartoon Network Pilots Screened by ASIFA East at NYC's School of Visual Arts|author=Strike, Joe|publisher=[[Animation World Network]]|accessdate=November 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacFarlane stated that the difference between ''The Life of Larry'' and ''Family Guy'' was that &quot;''Life of Larry'' was shown primarily in my dorm room and ''Family Guy'' was shown after the [[Super Bowl XXXIII|Super Bowl]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Callaghan, p. 16&quot;/&gt; After the pilot aired, the series was given the green light. MacFarlane drew inspiration from several sitcoms such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[All in the Family]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Road to&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.ign.com/articles/429/429628p10.html|title=Interview with Seth MacFarlane|work=[[IGN]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]] |accessdate=December 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Premises were drawn from several 1980s [[Saturday morning cartoons]] he watched as a child, such as ''[[The Fonz and the Happy Days Gang]]'' and ''[[Rubik, the Amazing Cube]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;MacFarlaneTIME&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1844711,00.html|title=Family Guy's Seth MacFarlane|author=Cruz, Gilbert|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|publisher=[[Time Warner]]|accessdate=August 28, 2009 | date=September 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Griffin family first appeared on the demo that MacFarlane pitched to Fox on May 15, 1998.&lt;ref name= piloty&gt;{{cite video|title=Original Pitch By Seth MacFarlane. Family Guy: Volume 2|medium=DVD|people=[[Seth MacFarlane|MacFarlane, Seth]]|publisher=20th Century Fox|accessdate=August 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Family Guy'' was originally planned to start out as short movies for the sketch show ''[[MADtv]]'', but the plan changed because MADtv's budget was not large enough to support animation production. MacFarlane noted that he then wanted to pitch it to Fox, as he thought that that was the place to create a prime-time animation show.&lt;ref name=&quot;Road to&quot;/&gt; ''Family Guy'' was originally pitched to Fox in the same year as ''[[King of the Hill]]'', but the show was not bought until years later, when ''King of the Hill'' became successful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Road to&quot;/&gt; Fox ordered 13 episodes of ''Family Guy'' to air in midseason after MacFarlane impressed executives with a seven-minute demo.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1049746,00.html|title=A Brief History of the ''Family Guy''|author=Tim Stack|date=April 18, 2005|publisher=Time Warner |work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=January 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
===Executive producers===

===Writing===
The first team of writers assembled for the show consisted of [[Chris Sheridan (writer)|Chris Sheridan]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Dead Man Film&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.yahoo.com/episode/1544/castcrew|title=Family Guy&amp;nbsp;— I Never Met the Dead Man Cast and Crew|work=[[Yahoo!|Yahoo! TV]]|publisher=Yahoo! Inc.|accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Danny Smith, [[Gary Janetti]], [[Ricky Blitt]], [[Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan|Neil Goldman]], [[Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan|Garrett Donovan]], [[Matt Weitzman]], and [[Mike Barker (producer)|Mike Barker]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Death Bang Film&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film.com/tv/family-guy/season-1-1998/episode-3-chitty-chitty-death-bang/14647430|publisher=RealNetworks|work=Film.com|title=Family Guy: Chitty Chitty Death Bang|accessdate=December 10, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writing process of ''Family Guy'' generally starts with 14 writers that take turns writing the scripts; when a script is finished it is given to the rest of the writers to read. These scripts generally include cutaway gags. If there are not enough cutaway sequences, writers are asked to create them. Various gags are pitched to MacFarlane and the rest of the staff, and those deemed funniest are included in the episode. MacFarlane has explained that normally it takes 10 months to produce an episode because the show uses hand-drawn animation. The show rarely comments on current events for this reason.&lt;ref name=&quot;AOL&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://television.aol.com/tv-celebrity-interviews/seth-macfarlane |title='American Dad' and 'Family Guy' Creator Seth MacFarlane Is Animated About Work and Play |work=The TV Tattler|publisher=[[AOL|AOL Inc.]] |accessdate=August 8, 2010 |date=August 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's initial writers had never written for an animated show; and most came from live-action sitcoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Road to&quot;/&gt;

Both would later create ''[[American Dad!]]'' with Seth MacFarlane.]]

MacFarlane explains that he is a fan of 1930s and 1940s radio programs, particularly the radio thriller anthology &quot;[[Suspense (radio drama)|Suspense]]&quot;, which led him to give early episodes ominous titles like &quot;[[Death Has a Shadow]]&quot; and &quot;[[Mind Over Murder]]&quot;. MacFarlane explained that the team dropped the naming convention after individual episodes became hard to identify, and the novelty wore off.&lt;ref name=TVIGNFest&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/696/696615p1.html|title=William S. Paley TV Fest: Family Guy |work=IGN|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the first few months of production, the writers shared one office, lent to them by the ''King of the Hill'' production crew.&lt;ref name=TVIGNFest/&gt;

Credited with 14 episodes, Steve Callaghan is the most prolific writer on ''Family Guy'' staff. Many of the writers that have left the show have gone on to create or produce other successful series. [[Neil Goldman and Garrett Donovan]] co-wrote 13 episodes for the NBC sitcom ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' during their eight-year run on the show, while also serving as co-producers and working their way up to executive producers.&lt;ref name=&quot;InAndOut&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/guide.aspx?id=in_and_out |title=the futon's guide to who's in and who's out |publisher=The Futon Critic |accessdate=September 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Barker (producer)|Mike Barker]] and [[Matt Weitzman]] would later create ''[[American Dad]]'', along with MacFarlane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Alexandria | last=Stanley | title=Dad Is a C.I.A.

During the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]], official production of the show halted for most of December 2007 and for various periods afterward. Fox continued producing episodes without MacFarlane's final approval, which he termed &quot;a colossal dick move&quot; in an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''. Though MacFarlane refused to work on the show, his contract under Fox required him to contribute to any episodes it would subsequently produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117975944.html?categoryid=2821 |title=Fox to air new ''Guy'' Sunday; MacFarlane hopes network changes plans |last=Adalian |first=Josef |work=Variety |publisher=[[Reed Business Information]] |accessdate=November 13, 2007 | date=November 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production officially resumed after the end of the strike, with regularly airing episodes recommencing on February&amp;nbsp;17, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/listings.aspx?id=20080424fox18 |title=Stewie Is On The Lam On &quot;Family Guy&quot; Sunday, May 18, On Fox |work=The Futon Critic|accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history and cancellation===
''Family Guy'' officially premiered after Fox's broadcast of [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] on January 31, 1999, with &quot;[[Death Has a Shadow]]&quot;. The show debuted to 22 million viewers, and immediately generated controversy regarding its adult content.&lt;ref name=&quot;Family Guy may return&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-11-18-family-guy_x.htm |title=''Family Guy'' may return |publisher= [[Gannett Company]]|work=[[USAToday]]|date=November 18, 2003|accessdate=December 6, 2009| first1=Gary | last1=Levin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show returned on April 11, 1999, with &quot;[[I Never Met the Dead Man]]&quot;. ''Family Guy'' garnered decent ratings in Fox's 8:30&amp;nbsp;pm slot on Sunday, scheduled between ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[The X-Files]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; At the end of its first season, the show was No. 33 in the [[Nielsen ratings]], with 12.8 million households tuning in.&lt;ref name=&quot;Geocities&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.geocities.com/Hollywood/4616/ew0604.html|work=[[GeoCities]]|date=March 24, 2004|title=1998–99 Ratings|accessdate=September 16, 2010|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091029011819/http://geocities.com/Hollywood/4616/ew0604.html|archivedate=October 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show launched its second season in a new time slot, Thursday at 9&amp;nbsp;pm, on September 23, 1999.

In March&amp;nbsp;2007 comedian [[Carol Burnett]] filed a $6-million lawsuit against 20th Century-Fox, claiming that her [[Charlady|charwoman]] character had been portrayed on the show without her permission.

On October&amp;nbsp;3, 2007, [[Bourne Co.

Bourne Co., the sole United States copyright owner of the song, alleged the parody pairs a &quot;thinly veiled&quot; copy of its music with [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] lyrics. Named in the suit were [[20th Century Fox Film Corporation|20th Century Fox Film Corp.]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Broadcasting Co.]], [[Cartoon Network]], [[Seth MacFarlane|MacFarlane]] and [[Walter Murphy|Murphy]]; the suit sought to stop the program's distribution and asked for unspecified damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court|litigants=Bourne Co., vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation, Fox Broadcasting Company, Twentieth Century Fox Television, Inc., Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment, Inc., Fuzzy Door Productions, Inc., The Cartoon Network, Inc., Seth MacFarlane, Walter Murphy |court=[[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|United States District Court, Southern District of New York]] |date=October 3, 2007|accessdate=September 5, 2010|url=http://www.schwimmerlegal.com/family%20guy%20complaint.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bourne argued that &quot;I Need a Jew&quot; uses the copyrighted melody of &quot;When You Wish Upon a Star&quot; without commenting on that song, and that it was therefore not a First Amendment-protected parody per the ruling in ''[[Campbell v.

==Characters==
{{Main|List of Family Guy characters}}

The primary setting of ''Family Guy'' is Quahog ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|k|oʊ|h|ɒ|ɡ}}), a [[List of fictional towns in animation|fictional Rhode Island town]]. MacFarlane resided in Providence during his time as a student at [[Rhode Island School of Design]], and the show contains distinct Rhode Island landmarks similar to real-world locations.&lt;ref name=&quot;interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Daniel Robert |last=Epstein |url=http://www.ugo.com/channels/filmTv/features/familyguy/sethmacfarlane.asp |title=Interview with Seth MacFarlane, creator of The Family Guy |work=[[UGO Networks]] |accessdate=April 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=James |last=Bartlett |url=http://greatreporter.com/mambo/content/view/1383/11/ |title=Seth MacFarlane&amp;nbsp;– he's the &quot;Family Guy&quot; |work=Greatreporter.com |accessdate=June 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacFarlane often borrows the names of Rhode Island locations and icons such as [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island|Pawtucket]] and [[Buddy Cianci]] for use in the show. MacFarlane, in an interview with local [[WNAC-TV|WNAC]] Fox 64 News, stated that the town is modeled after [[Cranston, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Family Guy writer at Bryant |journal=[[The Providence Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hallmarks==
===&quot;Road to&quot; episodes===
{{further2|[[Road to... (Family Guy)]]}}
The &quot;Road to&quot; episodes are a series of hallmark travel episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tuftsdaily.com/relying-on-stereotypes-family-guy-sticks-to-its-formula-cleveland-shows-a-softer-side-1.2001650#4 |title=Relying on stereotypes, ‘Family Guy’ sticks to its formula, ‘Cleveland’ shows a softer side |last=Phelps |first=Ben |work=[[Tufts Daily]]|quote=The show kicked off its eighth season with another entry in the now-classic “Road to ...” series, which allows for many different sight gags and opportunities for a wide range of humor. |publisher=[[Tufts University]] |accessdate=August 6, 2010 |date=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tvsquadroadto&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/01/29/family-guy-road-to-rupert/ |title=Family Guy: Road to Rupert |publisher=[[America On Line]]|quote=The FG team went back to familiar territory this week, bringing us another &quot;Road to...&quot; episode. |work=[[TV Squad]] |last=Love |first=Brett |date=January 29, 2007 |accessdate=August 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/105/1057773p2.html |title=Family Guy: Stewie and Brian's Greatest Adventures |publisher=News Corporation|work=IGN |last=Haque |first=Ahsan |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are a parody of the seven ''[[Road to...]]'' comedy films starring [[Bing Crosby]], [[Bob Hope]], and [[Dorothy Lamour]], which were released between 1940 and 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvsquadroadto&quot;/&gt; These episodes usually involve Stewie and Brian in some foreign, supernatural, or science fiction location not related to the show's normal location in Quahog. The first, entitled &quot;[[Road to Rhode Island]]&quot;, aired on May 30, 2000, during the [[Family Guy (season 2)|second season]]. The episodes are known for featuring elaborate [[number (music)|musical numbers]], similar to the ''Road'' films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stars.ign.com/articles/890/890465p5.html |title=The Cleveland Show Casting Couch |publisher=News Corporation|work=IGN |last=Iverson |first=Dan |coauthors=Lowe, Scott |accessdate=August 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episodes contain several trademarks, including a special version of the opening sequence, custom [[musical cue]]s and musical numbers, and parodies of science fiction and fantasy films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/759/759248p1.html |title=Family Guy: &quot;Road to Rupert&quot; Review |publisher=News Corporation|work=IGN |last=Iverson |first=Dan |date=January 29, 2007|accessdate=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original idea for the &quot;Road to&quot; episodes came from MacFarlane, as he is a fan of the films of Crosby, Hope, and Lamour. The first episode was directed by [[Dan Povenmire]], who would direct the rest of the &quot;Road to&quot; episodes until the episode &quot;[[Road to Rupert]]&quot;, at which point he had left the show to create ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;QA&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i0bc78baf8235f8b4159fd786ff9f8736|title= Q&amp;A: Dan Povenmire|archiveurl= http://74.125.93.132/search?q=cache:h-TlYnF0OCMJ:www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i0bc78baf8235f8b4159fd786ff9f8736+Emmy+nominee+Dan+Povenmire&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a|archivedate=November 24, 2009|author= Bond, Paul.|date= June 7, 2009|publisher=e5 Global Media|work=The Hollywood Reporter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film.com/tv/family-guy/season-3-2001/episode-20-road-to-europe/14647450|publisher=[[RealNetworks]]|work=Film.com|title=Family Guy: Road to Europe|accessdate=October 21, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series regular [[Greg Colton]] then took over Povenmire's role as director of the &quot;Road to&quot; episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film.com/tv/family-guy/season-8-2008/episode-3-road-to-germany/23570232|publisher=RealNetworks|work=Film.com|title=Family Guy: Road to Germany|accessdate=August 24, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humor===
''Family Guy'' uses the filmmaking technique of [[Cutaway (filmmaking)|cutaways]], which occur in the majority of ''Family Guy'' episodes.&lt;ref name=fhm&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fhm.com/reviews/tv/seth-macfarlane--exclusive-interview-with-the-family-guy-guy-20090624 |title=''Family Guy''{{'}}s Seth MacFarlane interviewed! |work=[[FHM]] |date=June 24, 2009 |accessdate=September 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emphasis is often placed on gags which make reference to current events and/or modern cultural icons.

Early episodes based much of their comedy on Stewie's &quot;super villain&quot; antics, such as his constant plans for total world domination, his evil experiments, plans and inventions to get rid of things he dislikes, and his constant attempts at [[matricide]]. As the series progressed, the writers and MacFarlane agreed that his personality and the jokes were starting to feel dated, so they began writing him with a different personality.&lt;ref name=matee/&gt; ''Family Guy'' often includes [[Meta-reference|self-referential]] humor. The most common form is jokes about Fox Broadcasting, and occasions where the characters [[Fourth wall|break the fourth wall]] by addressing the audience. For example, in &quot;[[North by North Quahog]]&quot;, the first episode that aired after the show's revival, included Peter telling the family that they had been cancelled because Fox had to make room in their schedule for shows like ''[[Dark Angel (TV series)|Dark Angel]]'', ''[[Titus (TV series)|Titus]]'', ''[[Undeclared]]'', ''[[Action (TV series)|Action]]'', ''[[That '80s Show]]'', ''[[Wonderfalls]]'', ''[[Fastlane (TV series)|Fastlane]]'', ''[[Andy Richter Controls the Universe]]'', ''[[Skin (TV series)|Skin]]'', ''[[Girls Club (TV series)|Girls Club]]'', ''[[Cracking Up]]'', ''[[The Pitts]]'', ''[[Firefly (TV series)|Firefly]]'', ''[[Get Real (U.S. TV series)|Get Real]]'', ''[[Freakylinks]]'', ''[[Wanda at Large]]'', ''Costello'', ''[[The Lone Gunmen (TV series)|The Lone Gunmen]]'', ''[[A Minute with Stan Hooper]]'', ''[[Normal, Ohio]]'', ''[[Pasadena (TV series)|Pasadena]]'', ''[[Harsh Realm]]'', ''[[Keen Eddie]]'', ''[[The $treet]]'', ''[[The American Embassy]]'', ''[[Cedric the Entertainer Presents]]'', ''[[The Tick (2001 TV series)|The Tick]]'', ''[[Luis (TV series)|Luis]]'', and ''[[Greg the Bunny]]''. Lois asks whether there is any hope, to which Peter replies that if all these shows are canceled they might have a chance; the shows were indeed canceled during ''Family Guy''{{'}}s hiatus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2005/04/28/2005-04-28__dad__joins_macfarlane_s__fa.html|title='Dad' Joins MacFarlane's 'Family'|work=New York Daily News|author=Bianculli, David|date=April 28, 2005|accessdate=September 19, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Back in the Fold|work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=April 28, 2005|page=W37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=An amazing comeback cartoon&amp;nbsp;— Why Fox resurrected Family Guy|work=[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]|location=Bergen County, New Jersey|date=May 1, 2005|author=Rohan, Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show uses [[catchphrase]]s, and most of the primary and secondary characters have them. Notable expressions include Quagmire's &quot;Giggity giggity goo&quot;, Peter's &quot;Freakin' sweet&quot;, and Joe's &quot;Bring it on!&quot;&lt;ref name=matee&gt;{{cite web|publisher=New Corporation|work=IGN|author=Haque, Ahsan|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/987/987014p8.html|title= Top 25 Family Guy Characters|accessdate=May 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of many of these catchphrases declined in later seasons. The episode &quot;[[Big Man on Hippocampus]]&quot; mocks catchphrase-based humor: when Peter, who has forgotten everything about his life, is introduced to Meg, he exclaims &quot;[[D'oh!]]&quot;, to which Lois replies, &quot;No, Peter, that's not your catchphrase.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20318518,00.html |title=Tiffani Thiessen Is Expecting a Baby |publisher=Time Inc.|work=[[People (magazine)|People Magazine]] |author=Jordan, Julie |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
===Success===
''Family Guy'' has received many positive reviews from critics. Catherine Seipp of the [[National Review|National Review Online]] described it as a &quot;nasty but extremely funny&quot; cartoon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/seipp/seipp200502040749.asp |title=Return of the Family Guy|work=[[National Review]]|accessdate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Caryn James of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it a show with an &quot;outrageously satirical family&quot; that &quot;includes plenty of comic possibilities and parodies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/13/arts/the-new-season-television-critic-s-choice-a-little-dysfunctional-family-fun.html|title=The New Season/Television: Critic's Choice; A Little Dysfunctional Family Fun|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=October 3, 2009| first=Caryn | last=James | date=September 13, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' named ''Family Guy'' the &quot;Show of the Week&quot; on April 21, 2009, hailing it a &quot;pop culture-heavy masterpiece&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/tv--radio/tv-reviews/show-of-the-week-family-guy/2009/04/20/1240079595389.html|title=Show Of The Week: Family Guy|title=Show of the Week: Family Guy|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=[[Fairfax Media]]|accessdate=October 3, 2009| date=April 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frazier Moore from ''[[The Seattle Times]]'' called it an &quot;endless craving for humor about bodily emissions&quot;.

===Criticism and controversy===
{{See also|Criticism of Family Guy}}

''Family Guy'' has received a negative treatment from some critics. One of the initial critics to give the show negative reviews was Ken Tucker from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''; he called it &quot;''The Simpsons'' as conceived by a singularly sophomoric mind that lacks any reference point beyond other TV shows&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273010,00.html|title=Family Guy|last=Tucker|first=Ken|date=June 9, 1999|publisher=Time Warner |work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,273010,00.html|title=Family Guy|last=Tucker|first=Ken|date=September 4, 1999|publisher=Time Warner |work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Parents Television Council]] (PTC), a conservative, non-profit [[Watchdog journalism|watchdog]], has attacked the series since its premiere and has branded various episodes as &quot;Worst TV Show of the Week&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/bw/2005/0123worst.asp| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070806125717/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/bw/2005/0123worst.asp| archivedate = August 6, 2007| title = Worst TV Show of the Week-Family Guy| work = [[Parents Television Council]]|last=Bowling|first=Aubree| accessdate =July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/bw/2005/1229worst.asp| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080123075851/http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/bw/2005/1229worst.asp| archivedate = January 23, 2008| title = Family Guy| work = Parents Television Council|last=Schulenburg|first=Caroline| accessdate =June 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/bw/2007/0406worst.asp| title = Family Guy on Fox| work = Parents Television Council|last=Shirlen|first=Josh| accessdate =July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2000 the PTC launched a letter-writing campaign to the Fox network in an effort to persuade the network to cancel the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://web.archive.org/web/20010702021728/www.parentstv.org/publications/cyberbites/ecyb20000505.html| title = E-Alerts| work = Parents Television Council| accessdate =July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PTC has placed the show on their annual lists of &quot;Worst Prime-Time Shows for Family Viewing&quot; in 2000, 2005, and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2000top/main.asp| title = PTC's Annual Top 10 Best &amp; Worst Family Shows on Network Television 1999–2000 TV Season| work = Parents Television Council| accessdate =July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2005/main.asp| title = Top Ten Best and Worst Shows for family viewing on prime time broadcast television| work = Parents Television Council|date=October 19, 2005|accessdate =July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/publications/reports/top10bestandworst/2006/main.asp| title = Rating the Top 20 Most Popular Prime Time Broadcast TV Shows Watched by Children Ages 2–17| work = Parents Television Council| accessdate =June 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Federal Communications Commission]] has received multiple petitions requesting that the show be blocked from broadcasting on [[Communications Decency Act|indecency]] grounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Content2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Content examples from NCIS, Family Guy, and The Vibe Awards.|work=Parents Television Council|url=http://www.parentstv.org/ptc/action/sweeps/content.htm|accessdate=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tucker and the PTC have both accused the show portraying religion negatively, and of being racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,272168,00.html| title = The Worst/TV: 1999

Various episodes of the show have generated controversy. In &quot;[[The Son Also Draws]]&quot; ([[Family Guy (season 1)|season one]], 1999) Peter jokes that &quot;Canada sucks&quot;; this caused controversy with Canadian viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=MacFarlane, Seth|date=2003|title=Commentary for the episode &quot;The Son Also Draws&quot;.

===Live performances===
As promotion for the show, and, as Newman described, &quot;[to] expand interest in the show beyond its diehard fans&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;VarietyLive!&quot;/&gt; Fox organized four ''Family Guy Live!'' performances, which featured cast members reading old episodes aloud. The cast also performed musical numbers from the ''[[Family Guy: Live in Vegas]]'' comedy album.&lt;ref name=&quot;VarietyLive!&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Family Guy Center Stage|work=Variety|date=March 10, 2005|author=Adalian, Josef|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stage shows were an extension of a performance by the cast during the 2004 [[Montreal Comedy Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;VarietyLive!&quot;/&gt; The ''Family Guy Live!'' performances, which took place in Los Angeles and New York, sold out and were attended by around 1,200 people each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,155143,00.html|title='Family Guy' Returns to FOX|publisher=Fox News|date=April 30, 2005|accessdate=July 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, at the [[59th Annual Primetime Emmy Awards]], MacFarlane performed (as the digitally inserted Stewie and Brian) the ceremony's opening number. He performed a song insulting modern television to the tune of the song performed in the episode ''[[PTV (Family Guy)|PTV]]''. The song insulted TV shows such as ''[[Two and a Half Men]]'', ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'', and ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'', as well as the [[Made in America (The Sopranos)|final scene]] of ''[[The Sopranos]]''.

In 2009 a special televised performance show aired entitled ''Family Guy Presents Seth &amp; Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show'', in which voice actors [[Alex Borstein]] and MacFarlane performed songs from the show, as well as a parody of [[Lady Gaga]]'s song &quot;[[Poker Face (Lady Gaga song)|Poker Face]]&quot; in the voice of [[Marlee Matlin]], who appeared on stage as a guest during the performance. Some new animated gags also appeared in the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tucker |first=Ken |url=http://watching-tv.ew.com/2009/11/08/seth-macfarlane-comedy-show |title=Family Guy Presents Seth &amp; Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show': Almost pretty funny |work=Entertainment Weekly  |date=January 24, 2011 |accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
