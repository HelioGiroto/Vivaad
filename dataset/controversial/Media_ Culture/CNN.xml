'''Cable News Network''' ('''CNN''') is a [[United States cable news|U.S. cable news]] channel founded in 1980 by American [[media mogul]] and [[philanthropist]] [[Ted Turner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://meandted.com/author.htm Reese Schonfeld Bio.] (January 29, 2001) ''MeAndTed.com''.

''CNN.com''. Retrieved 2007-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its launch, CNN was the first channel to provide [[24-hour news cycle|24-hour]] [[television news]] coverage,&lt;ref name=CNNtaipei&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/editorials/archives/2005/05/31/2003257358|title=CNN changed news – for better and worse|date=May 31, 2005|publisher=Taipei Times|accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first all-news television channel in the United States.&lt;ref name=CNN20&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2000/05/28/loc_kiesewetter.html|title=In 20 years, CNN has changed the way we view the news|date=May 28, 2000|publisher=Cincinnati Enquirer|last=Kiesewetter|first=John|accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the news channel has numerous [[affiliate]]s, CNN primarily broadcasts from its headquarters at the [[CNN Center]] in [[Atlanta]], the [[Time Warner Center]] in New York City, and studios in [[Washington, D.C.]], and Los Angeles. CNN is owned by parent company [[Time Warner]], and the U.S. news channel is a division of the [[Turner Broadcasting System]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timewarner.com/corp/businesses/detail/turner_broadcasting/index.html Time Warner: Turner Broadcasting]&lt;/ref&gt;

CNN is sometimes referred to as '''CNN/U.S.''' to distinguish the American channel from its international counterpart, [[CNN International]].

==History==

===Early history===
{{Main|History of CNN (1980–2003)}}
[[Image:CNN Launch June 1, 1980.jpg|thumb|left|CNN's first broadcast with [[David Walker (journalist)|David Walker]] and [[Lois Hart]] on June 1, 1980.]]

The Cable News Network was launched at 5:00 p.m. EST on Sunday June 1, 1980. After an introduction by Ted Turner, the husband and wife team of [[David Walker (journalist)|David Walker]] and [[Lois Hart]] anchored the first newscast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Television News: The Media Marketplace and the Public Interest|first=Steve Michael|last=Barkin|first2=M.E. |last2=Sharpe|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Burt Reinhardt]], the then executive vice president of CNN, hired most of CNN's first 200 employees, including the network's first [[news anchor]], [[Bernard Shaw (journalist)|Bernard Shaw]].&lt;ref name=wp&gt;{{cite news |first=Lauren|last=Wiseman|title=Burt Reinhardt dies at 91: Newsman helped launch CNN |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/burt-reinhardt-dies-at-91-newsman-helped-launch-cnn/2011/04/14/AFMd9mkG_story.html |work=[[Washington Post]] |publisher=|date=2011-05-10 |accessdate=2011-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its debut, CNN has expanded its reach to a number of cable and satellite television companies, several websites, and specialized closed-circuit channels (such as [[CNN Airport Network]]). The company has 36 bureaus (10 domestic, 26 international), more than 900 affiliated local stations, and several regional and foreign-language networks around the world. The channel's success made a bona-fide mogul of founder Ted Turner and set the stage for the Time Warner conglomerate's eventual acquisition of [[Turner Broadcasting]].

A companion channel, [[HLN (TV channel)|CNN2]], was launched on January 1, 1982 and featured a continuous 24-hour cycle of 30-minute news broadcasts. The channel, which later became known as &quot;CNN Headline News&quot; and then simply &quot;HLN&quot;, eventually focused on live news coverage supplemented by personality-based programs during the evening and primetime hours.

===Major events===
[[Image:CNN Center newsroom1.jpg|thumb|right|Replica of the newsroom at CNN Center.]]

====Challenger disaster====
On January 28, 1986, CNN carried the only live television coverage of the launch and [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|subsequent explosion of Space Shuttle Challenger]], which killed the seven crew members.

====Baby Jessica rescue====
On October 14, 1987, an 18-month-old toddler named [[Jessica McClure]] fell down a well in [[Midland, Texas]]. CNN was quickly on the spot, and the event helped make their name. The ''[[New York Times]]'' ran a retrospective article in 1995 on the impact of live video news. &quot;If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a moving picture is worth many times that, and a live moving picture makes an emotional connection that goes deeper than logic and lasts well beyond the actual event. This was before correspondents reported live from the enemy capital while American bombs were falling. Before Saddam Hussein held a surreal press conference with a few of the hundreds of Americans he was holding hostage. Before the nation watched, riveted but powerless, as Los Angeles was looted and burned. Before O. J. Simpson took a slow ride in a white Bronco, and before everyone close to his case had an agent and a book contract. This was uncharted territory just a short time ago.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE3D81F31F930A15754C0A963958260&amp;sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=4 &quot;Death on the CNN curve&quot; By Lisa Belkin. ''New York Times'' Magazine, Sunday, July 23, 1995.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gulf War====
The first Persian [[Gulf War]] in 1991 was a watershed event for CNN that catapulted the channel past the &quot;big three&quot; American networks for the first time in its history, largely due to an unprecedented, historical scoop: CNN was the only news outlet with the ability to communicate from inside [[Iraq]] during the initial hours of the Coalition bombing campaign, with live reports from the [[al-Rashid Hotel]] in [[Baghdad]] by reporters [[Bernard Shaw (journalist)|Bernard Shaw]], [[John Holliman]], and [[Peter Arnett]].
[[Image:CNN Gulf War nightscope January 1991.jpg|thumb|right|[[Operation Desert Storm]] as captured live on a CNN [[night vision]] camera with reporters narrating.]] 
The moment when bombing began was announced on CNN by Bernard Shaw on January 16, 1991 as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/ynhti/curriculum/units/1996/2/96.02.08.x.html The Gulf War and its Consequences]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|This is Bernie Shaw. Something is happening outside...Peter Arnett, join me here. Let's describe to our viewers what we're seeing...The skies over Baghdad have been illuminated...We're seeing bright flashes going off all over the sky.}}

CNN's coverage of the initial hours of the Gulf War was carried by TV stations and networks around the world, resulting in CNN being watched by over a billion viewers worldwide—a feat that led to the subsequent creation of CNN International.

The Gulf War experience brought CNN some much sought-after legitimacy and made household names of previously obscure reporters. Many of these reporters now comprise CNN's &quot;old guard.&quot; Bernard Shaw became CNN's chief anchor until his retirement in 2001. Others include then-Pentagon correspondent [[Wolf Blitzer]] (now host of ''[[The Situation Room]]'') and international correspondent [[Christiane Amanpour]]. Amanpour's presence in Iraq was caricatured by actress Nora Dunn as the ruthless reporter &quot;Adriana Cruz&quot; in the film ''[[Three Kings (1999 film)|Three Kings]]'' (1999). Time Warner later produced a [[television movie]], ''[[Live from Baghdad]]'', about the channel's coverage of the first Gulf War, which aired on [[Home Box Office|HBO]].

=====CNN effect=====
Coverage of the first Gulf War and other crises of the early 1990s (particularly the infamous [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]]) led officials at the Pentagon to coin the term &quot;the [[CNN effect]]&quot; to describe the perceived impact of [[Real-time computing|real time]], 24-hour news coverage on the decision-making processes of the [[Federal government of the United States|American government]].

====September 11 attacks====
[[Image:CNN Breaking News 911.jpg|thumb|CNN breaking the news about the [[September 11 attacks]].]]
CNN was the first cable news channel to break the news of the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/20080720/ENTERTAINMENT/917997689?Title=No-nonsense-news-returns-to-CNN |title=No-nonsense news returns to CNN |publisher=PressDemocrat.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[News presenter|Anchor]] [[Carol Lin]] was on the air to deliver the first public report of the event. She broke into a commercial at 8:49 a.m. ET and said:

{{cquote| This just in. You are looking at obviously a very disturbing live shot there. That is the [[World Trade Center]], and we have unconfirmed reports this morning that a plane has crashed into one of the towers of the World Trade Center. [[CNN Center]] right now is just beginning to work on this story, obviously calling our sources and trying to figure out exactly what happened, but clearly something relatively devastating happening this morning there on the south end of the island of Manhattan. That is once again, a picture of one of the towers of the World Trade Center.}}

Sean Murtagh, CNN vice-president of finance and administration, was the first network employee on the air. He called into CNN Center from his office at CNN New York bureau and said that a commercial jet hit the Trade Center.&lt;ref&gt;CNN.com (September 11, 2001) Available at [http://web.archive.org/web/20010911200318/http://www.cnn.com/ archive.org]. Retrieved 2007-06-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Daryn Kagan]] and [[Leon Harris]] were live on the air just after 9 a.m. ET as the second plane hit the World Trade Center and through an interview with CNN correspondent [[David Ensor (journalist)|David Ensor]], reported the news that U.S. officials determined &quot;that this is a terrorist act.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0109/11/bn.01.html CNN BREAKING NEWS Transcript – Terrorist Attack on United States]&lt;/ref&gt; Later, [[Aaron Brown]] anchored through the day and night as the attacks unfolded. Brown had just come to CNN from [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] to be the breaking news anchor.

[[Paula Zahn]] assisted in the September 11, 2001, coverage on her first day as a CNN reporter, a fact that she mentioned as a guest clue presenter on a 2005 episode of ''[[Jeopardy!]]''

CNN has made archival files of much of the day's broadcast available in [http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/us/2011/09/07/natpkg-911-aircheck-timeline.cnn?iref=allsearch five segments plus an overview].

====2008 U.S. election====
[[Image:CNN-YouTube Republican Debate.jpg|thumb|right|The stage for the second 2008 [[CNN-YouTube presidential debates|CNN-YouTube presidential debate]].]]

Leading up to the [[2008 U.S. presidential election]], CNN devoted large amounts of coverage to politics, including hosting candidate debates during the Democratic and Republican primary seasons. On June 3 and June 5, CNN teamed up with [[Saint Anselm College]] to sponsor the New Hampshire Republican and Democratic Debates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~action/2008/primdeb08/nh060307.html |title=CNN/WMUR-TV/New Hampshire Union Leader Democratic Debate |publisher=Gwu.edu |date=2007-06-03 |accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 2007, the channel hosted the first [[CNN-YouTube presidential debates]], a non-traditional format where viewers were invited to pre-submit questions over the internet via the [[YouTube]] video-sharing service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/07/22/news/youtube23.php YouTube and CNN invite ordinary Americans into presidential debates]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, CNN partnered with ''[[The Los Angeles Times]]'' to host two primary debates leading up to its coverage of [[Super Tuesday]].&lt;ref name=supertuesday&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/politics/la-et-politics4feb04,0,6879163.story Super Tuesday gets presidential treatment]&lt;/ref&gt; CNN's debate and election night coverage led to its highest ratings of the year, with January 2008 viewership averaging 1.1 million viewers, a 41% increase over the previous year.&lt;ref name=supertuesday/&gt;

===On-air presentation===
In December 2008, CNN introduced its new graphics package, a comprehensive redesign replacing the existing style that had been used since 2004.&lt;ref name=CNNnewlook&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/160701-CNN_Gets_New_Graphic_Look.php|title=CNN Gets New Graphic Look|date=December 15, 2008|publisher=''Broadcasting &amp; Cable''|last=Dickson |first=Glen|accessdate=January 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The design replaced the scrolling ticker that had been in use since 2001. Also, since March 1, 2009, the redundant CNN HD logo has been missing from the bottom left corner of the screen. CNN's new graphic design is similar to its sister channel, [[CNN International]]. The CNN logo itself has remained relatively unchanged since the channel's launch, except that it was originally displayed in yellow.

On January 10, 2011, CNN introduced its most recent graphics package, in conjunction with the network-wide switch to a [[16:9]] [[letterbox]] format from [[4:3]]. Both of CNN's standard-definition and high-definition feeds now carry the same 16:9 format; however, video footage broadcast in standard-definition on either feed is not pillarboxed, resulting in black bars on the top and bottom of the screen as well as the left and right. ''World Business Today'' and ''[[World One]]'', which both began to be simulcast from [[CNN International]] on January 17, 2011, are however both broadcast in the 4:3 picture format on the CNN SD feed.

[[Image:CNN HD-American Morning 1080.png|right|thumb|''American Morning'' on CNN HD with the 2004–2008 graphics package.]]

'''CNN HD''' is a [[1080i]] [[high definition television|high definition]] simulcast of CNN that launched in September 2007.&lt;ref name=hdlaunch&gt;[http://www.tvweek.com/news/2007/09/cnn_hd_debuts.php TV Week September 6, 2007 CNN HD Debuts]&lt;/ref&gt; All studio shows are aired in HD, as well as special events. 

Starting late 2010, the domestic version CNN/U.S., is available in high definition to viewers in Japan under the name CNN HD. If this is a one-off case or the beginning of an international roll-out of CNN HD with more countries to come is unclear.

Formerly during ''American Morning'', CNN HD viewers saw weather forecasts in graphic form on the sides of the screen (American cities on the right, and cities outside of the U.S. on the left). This feature was removed in November 2009.

The documentary ''[[Planet in Peril]]'' was CNN's first documentary program produced in HD, followed by ''[[Black in America]]'' (Its sequel ''Black in America 2'' also aired in HD). Its spinoff ''Latino in America'' was also in HD. CNN HD also used to display a CNN HD logo (the normal CNN logo with the letters HD in a different, gray colored font next to it) on the bottom left corner of the screen. It was last used on February 28, 2009.

===Special events===
All special events are aired in full HD. During primary and caucus nights, America Votes 2008 was produced in complete HD with Wolf Blitzer anchoring from CNN's main New York studio which was renamed the CNN Election Center. During this time, CNN HD viewers got additional information on the side of their TV screens such as poll numbers, charts and graphs. This also happened for the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]], the [[2008 Republican National Convention]], the [[United States presidential election debates, 2008|2008 United States Presidential Debates]], the [[United States vice-presidential debate, 2008|2008 United States Vice Presidential Debate]] and the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Election Day]] coverage on November 4, all of which were also shot in HD. Other special events such as Presidential speeches and press conferences are aired in HD.

[[Image:CNN Election Express.jpg|thumb|right|The CNN Election Express bus, used for HD broadcasts.]]
CNN's political coverage in HD was given mobility by the introduction of the CNN Election Express bus in October 2007. The Election Express vehicle, capable of five simultaneous HD feeds, was used for the channel's CNN-YouTube presidential debates and for presidential candidate interviews.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvtechnology.com/article/17920 CNN Rolls Out Election Express]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coverage===
Initial carriage of CNN HD on cable and satellite systems was limited. [[DirecTV]] was the first provider to carry it, adding it mid-September 2007.&lt;ref name=hdlaunch/&gt; By June 2008, [[Comcast]], [[Time Warner Cable]], [[Cox Communications]], [[AT&amp;T U-verse]], [[Rogers Cable]], [[Midcontinent Communications]], [[Bright House Networks]], and [[Dish Network]] launched carriage of CNN HD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/111118-CNN_HD_Gains_Carriage_with_Cablevision_Systems.php |title=CNN HD Gains Carriage with Cablevision Systems – 2007-11-08 11:55:00 &amp;#124; Broadcasting &amp; Cable |publisher=Broadcastingcable.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/98348-Cox_Adds_TBS_CNN_HD_Channels.php |title=Cox Adds TBS, CNN HD Channels – 2007-10-04 11:58:00 &amp;#124; Broadcasting &amp; Cable |publisher=Broadcastingcable.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Verizon]] is currently in the process of adding CNN HD to its [[Verizon FiOS|FiOS]] service on a market by market basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satellitetv-news.com/verizon-fios-adds-22-new-channels-in-fort-wayne/ |title=Verizon FiOS Adds 22 New Channels In Fort Wayne &amp;#124; Satellite Television News |publisher=Satellitetv-news.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/entertainment/1497861/verizon_fios_tv_delivers_100_highdefinition_channels_to_new_yorkers/ |title=Verizon FiOS TV Delivers 100 High-Definition Channels to New Yorkers – on the Network Built for HD – Entertainment News |publisher=redOrbit |date=2008-07-28 |accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CNN is also rebroadcast during the [[CBC TV 8 (Barbados)|Caribbean Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) mid-day and evening news in [[Barbados]].

[[File:CNN Website April 2011.png|thumb|left|International version in April 2011]]

CNN debuted its news website [http://www.cnn.com/ CNN.com] (initially an experiment known as ''CNN Interactive'') on August 30, 1995. The site attracted growing interest over its first decade and is now one of the most popular news websites in the world. The widespread growth of [[blogs]], [[social media]] and [[user-generated content]] have influenced the site, and blogs in particular have focused CNN's previously scattershot online offerings, most noticeably in the development and launch of [[CNN Pipeline]] in late 2005.

In April 2009, CNN.com ranked third place among online global news sites in unique users in the U.S. according to Nielsen/NetRatings; with an increase of 11% over the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003975048 Top 30 global news sites for April – Editor &amp; Publisher]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CNN Pipeline]] was the name of a paid subscription service, its corresponding website, and a content delivery client that provided streams of live video from up to four sources (or &quot;pipes&quot;), on-demand access to CNN stories and reports, and optional pop-up &quot;news alerts&quot; to computer users. The installable client was available to users of PCs running [[Microsoft Windows]]. There was also a browser-based &quot;web client&quot; that did not require installation. In July 2007 the service was discontinued and replaced with a free streaming service.

The now-defunct topical news-program ''[[Judy Woodruff's Inside Politics]]'' was the first CNN program to feature a round-up of blogs in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/columnist/mediamix/2005-03-20-media-mix_x.htm |title=It's prime time for blogs on CNN's 'Inside Politics'|date=2005-03-20 |publisher=USA Today |last=Johnson |first=Peter |accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blog coverage was expanded when ''[[Inside Politics]]'' was folded into ''[[The Situation Room]]''. In 2006 CNN launched [[CNN Exchange]] and [[CNN iReport]], initiatives designed to further introduce and centralize the impact of everything from [[blogging]] to [[citizen journalism]] within the CNN brand. [[CNN iReport]] which features user-submitted photos and video, has achieved considerable traction, with increasingly professional-looking reports filed by amateur journalists, many still in high school or college. The iReport gained more prominence when observers of the Virginia Tech Shootings sent-in first hand photos of what was going during the shootings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/reginaleaderpost/news/story.html?id=250570b8-2555-4ac0-8fb7-a0431a321e0d&amp;k=80562|title='Citizen journalist' often there first to snap photos |date=April 12, 2008 |publisher=''Regina Leader-Post''|last=Cobb |first=Chris |accessdate=2009-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of early 2008, CNN maintains a free live broadcast.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNNlivestreaming&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/video/live/live.html|title=CNN live streaming website}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNN International is broadcast live, as part of the [[RealNetworks]] SuperPass subscription outside US. CNN also offers several [[RSS|RSS feeds]] and [[podcast]]s.

On April 18, 2008 CNN.com was targeted by Chinese hackers in retaliation for the channel's coverage on the [[2008 Tibetan unrest]]. CNN reported that they took preventative measures after news broke of the impending attack.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/TECH/04/18/cnn.websites/ CNN website targeted]&quot;, April 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Claburn, Thomas: &quot;[http://www.informationweek.com/news/security/cybercrime/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=207400699 CNN Faces Cyberattack Over Tibet Coverage]&quot; [[InformationWeek]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company was honored at the 2008 [[Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Award]]s for development and implementation of an integrated and portable IP-based live, edit and store-and-forward digital news gathering (DNG) system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://insidecable.blogsome.com/2008/01/08/cnn-awarded-technical-emmy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first use of what would later win CNN this award was in April 2001 when CNN correspondent Lisa Rose Weaver&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uiowa.edu/jmc/faculty/weaver.html |title=Lisa Rose Weaver}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
covered, and were detained,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-04-12/world/cnn.crew.detained_1_cnn-crew-flight-crew-chinese-police |work=CNN |title=CNN crew detained by Chinese police |date=April 11, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the release of the U.S. Navy crew of a damaged electronic surveillance plane after the [[Hainan Island incident]]. The technology consisted of a videophone produced by 7E Communications Ltd of London, UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.privateline.com/war/videophone.html |title=Videophone Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; This DNG workflow is used today by the network to receive material world wide using an Apple MacBook Pro, various [[prosumer]] and professional digital cameras, software from Streambox Inc., and [[BGAN]] terminals from [[Hughes Network Systems]].

On October 24, 2009 CNN launched a new version of their CNN.com website, revamping it adding a new &quot;sign up&quot; option where users may create their own user name, a new &quot;CNN Pulse&quot; (beta) feature along with a new red color theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/interactive/relaunch/ |title=Welcome to the New CNN.com – Interactive tour |publisher=Cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the news archived on the website has been deleted.

CNN also has a channel in the popular video-sharing site [[YouTube]], but its videos can only be viewed in the United States, a source of criticism among YouTube users worldwide.

In April 2010, CNN announced via [[Twitter]] its upcoming food [[blog]] called &quot;Eatocracy,&quot; in which it will &quot;cover all news related to food – from recalls to health issues to culture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Brion, Raphael |title=Eatocracy: CNN Gets in the Food Blog Business |url=http://eater.com/archives/2010/04/13/eatocracy-cnn-gets-in-the-food-blog-business.php |work=Eater.com |date=April 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNN had an [[internet relay chat]] (IRC) network at chat.cnn.com. CNN placed a live chat with [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] on the network in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.cnn.com/community/netanyahu/Net1getready.html How to join the chat and view the Webcast].&quot; CNN. 1998. Retrieved on February 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films===
CNN reported in October 2012 that the network formed '''CNN Films''' to distribute and produce made-for-TV and feature documentaries. Its first acquisition was a documentary entitled ''Girl Rising'', a [[Meryl Streep]]-narrated documentary on the struggles of girls' education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deadline.com/2012/10/cnn-documentary-films/ &quot;CNN Creates Unit To Acquire Documentary Films For Theaters And TV.&quot;] ''CNN press release via [[Deadline.com]]'' (October 8, 2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
{{Main|CNN controversies}}
In a joint study by the Joan Shorenstein Center on Press, Politics and Public Policy at [[Harvard University]] and the Project for Excellence in Journalism, the authors found disparate treatment by the three major cable channels of Republican and Democratic candidates during the earliest five months of presidential primaries in 2007: &quot;The CNN programming studied tended to cast a negative light on Republican candidates—by a margin of three-to-one. Four-in-ten stories (41%) were clearly negative while just 14% were positive and 46% were neutral. The network provided negative coverage of all three main candidates with McCain faring the worst (63% negative) and Romney faring a little better than the others only because a majority of his coverage was neutral. It's not that Democrats, other than Obama, fared well on CNN either. Nearly half of the Illinois Senator's stories were positive (46%), vs. just 8% that were negative. But both Clinton and Edwards ended up with more negative than positive coverage overall. So while coverage for Democrats overall was a bit more positive than negative, that was almost all due to extremely favorable coverage for Obama.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hks.harvard.edu/presspol/publications/reports/invisible_primary_invisible_no_longer.pdf|title=Microsoft Word - The Early Campaign FINAL.doc|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CNN has been accused of perpetrating [[media bias]] for allegedly promoting both a conservative and a liberal agenda based on previous incidents. [[Accuracy in Media]] and the [[Media Research Center]] have claimed that CNN's reporting contains liberal editorializing within news stories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aim.org/media_monitor/A3962_0_2_0_C/ CNN and the Liberal Propaganda Machine].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediaresearch.org/cyberalerts/1999/cyb19990217.asp Media Research Center CyberAlert – 17 February 1999 – slant of CNN's Tuesday night town meeting].&lt;/ref&gt;

CNN is one of the world's largest news organizations, and its international channel, [[CNN International]] is the leading international news channel in terms of viewer reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/about/ |title=About Us |publisher=CNN.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brandrepublic.com/bulletins/media/article/563911/cnn-tops-european-news-channels-according-ems/ |title=CNN tops European news channels according to EMS – Brand Republic News |publisher=Brand Republic |date= |accessdate=2010-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the BBC and its network of reporters and bureaus, [[CNN International]] makes extensive use of affiliated reporters that are local to, and often directly affected by, the events they are reporting. The effect is a more immediate, less detached style of on-the-ground coverage. This has done little to stem criticism, largely from Middle Eastern nations, that CNN International reports news from a pro-American perspective. This is a marked contrast to domestic criticisms that often portray CNN as having a &quot;liberal&quot; or &quot;anti-American&quot; bias. In 2002, [[Honest Reporting]] spearheaded a campaign to expose CNN for pro-Palestinian bias, citing public remarks in which [[Ted Turner]] equated Palestinian suicide bombing with Israeli military strikes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2002/jun/18/terrorismandthemedia.israel CNN chief accuses Israel of terror].&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]''. June 5, 2007. As said by Ted Turner, founder of CNN, &quot;There really isn't much of a point getting some Tom, Dick or Harry off the streets to report on when we can snag a big name whom everyone identifies with. After all, it's all part of the business.&quot; However, in April 2008, Turner criticized the direction CNN has taken.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/news/stories/2008/04/03/turner_0404.html Ted Turner: Global warming could lead to cannibalism | ajc.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Others have echoed that criticism, especially in light of CNN's drop in the ratings.

On April 24, 2008 beautician Liang Shubing and teacher Li Lilan sued commentator [[Jack Cafferty]] and CNN $1.3 billion damages ($1 per person in China), in New York, for &quot;violating the dignity and reputation of the Chinese people&quot;. This was in response to an incident during CNN's &quot;The Situation Room&quot; on April 9, where Cafferty stated his opinion that &quot;[the USA] continue to import their junk with the lead paint on them and the poisoned pet food&quot; despite his view that &quot;[the Chinese leaders were] basically the same bunch of goons and thugs they've been for the last 50 years&quot;. Further, amid China's Foreign Ministry demand for an apology, 14 lawyers filed a similar suit in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/20080424/cnn-time-warner-lawsuit-china-media.htm ''IBtimes.com'', CNN Faces $1.3 Bln Lawsuit – $1 per person in China]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSPEK30866720080424 reuters.com, CNN now sued for $1.3 billion – $1 per person in China].&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, musician [[M.I.A. (artist)|M.I.A.]] stated she did an hour-long interview with CNN condemning the mass bombing and Tamil civilian fatalities at the hands of Government forces in Sri Lanka in 16 weeks the same year, &quot;and they cut it down to one minute and made it about my single ''Paper Planes''. When I went to the Grammys, I saw the same reporter from CNN, and I was like, &quot;Why did you do that?&quot; And she said, &quot;Because you used the G-word.&quot;&quot; &quot;Genocide. I guess you’re not allowed to say that on CNN,&quot; raising questions concerning CNN's coverage and commitment to free speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tamilnet.com/art.html?catid=13&amp;artid=29642 Tamilnet.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/features/la-mag-june072009-turnitup,0,2368794,full.story|work=Los Angeles Times|first=Nic|last=Harcourt |title=Turn It Up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 11, 2009, longtime CNN anchor [[Lou Dobbs]] resigned on air after discussions with CNN President Jonathan Klein, who had agreed to a release from his contract &quot;that will enable me to pursue new opportunities.&quot;  He had previously expressed to Klein that he wished to go &quot;the opinion route&quot;.  Dobbs' advocacy journalism style coverage of immigration, [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|Obama birthers]] and free trade topics has attracted controversy both to him and to CNN.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.cnn.com/2009-11-11/us/lou.dobbs.leaving_1_anchor-lou-dobbs-dobbs-wife-moneyline?_s=PM:US Anchor Lou Dobbs Departs CNN]; CNN; November 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/dobbs_gave_up_on_3EsCWZGeRuYrPsFuzm8YoJ#ixzz0WlY7TOMc Dobbs gave up on $9M – Nixed CNN pact in 'Obama birther' flap] ''New York Post'' November 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7, 2010, [[Octavia Nasr]], senior Middle East editor and a CNN journalist for 20 years, was fired after she expressed on her [[Twitter]] account admiration for a liberal-minded Muslim cleric who had recently died, casting doubts on the company's commitment to freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/society-and-culture/land-of-the-free-now-home-of-the-afraid-20100712-107sq.html|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|title=Land of the free now home of the afraid|first=Toby|last=Harnden|date=July 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2010, CNN anchor [[Rick Sanchez]] was fired after remarks he made during an interview with comedian Pete Dominick at a radio show the previous day about prejudices he faced during his television career, at CNN and jokes about him by comedian [[Jon Stewart]]. Calling him a &quot;bigot&quot; before retracting this and describing him instead as &quot;prejudiced&quot; and &quot;uninformed&quot;, the interviewer invoked Stewart's faith as an example of how Stewart was &quot;a minority as much as you are&quot;. Sanchez stated his view that Jewish people were not an oppressed minority in America, and his view that &quot;everybody that runs CNN is a lot like Stewart&quot; before stating &quot;And a lot of people who run all the other networks are a lot like Stewart.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/02/business/media/02cnn.html?src=busln|title=CNN Fires Rick Sanchez for Remarks in Interview|work=New York Times|date=October 1, 2010|author=Stelter, Brian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
