'''Smooth jazz''' is a genre of music that grew out of [[jazz fusion]]&lt;ref name=&quot;explore_amg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Explore:Smooth Jazz|url=http://allmusic.com/explore/style/smooth-jazz-d4447|work=[[allmusic]]|accessdate=January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is influenced by [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], [[funk]], [[rock music|rock]], and [[pop music|pop]] music styles (separately, or, in any combination).{{Fact|date=August 2012}} 

Modern derivatives of the genre include the more-recent New Adult Contemporary format of broadcast radio. &quot;Smooth jazz&quot; has been successful as a [[radio format]]; however, in 2007, the popularity of the format began to slide.  Consequently, it was abandoned by several high-profile radio stations across the U.S.A., perhaps most notably by WQCD (now [[WRXP]]) in New York and [[KKSF]] in San Francisco. Many industry insiders have speculated that the smooth jazz format may die out, particularly with many of industry giant [[Clear Channel Communications]]' stations dropping the genre.&lt;ref name=&quot;ContraCostaTimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/ci_12532336?nclick_check=1|title=Smooth Jazz might be in big trouble|date=2009-06-14|accessdate=2009-06-20|last=Harrington|first=Jim|publisher=Contra Costa Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the company, however, blame Clear Channel for the format's decline, citing too much repetition of a sharply-reduced number of tracks on Clear Channel-owned stations that alienated many listeners. Despite the format's demise on commercial radio, a growing number of non-commercial stations have taken up the music. In addition, smooth jazz concerts, recording sales—as well as increased smooth jazz offerings on the Internet—continue to show strong fan support for the genre.&lt;ref name=&quot;ContraCostaTimes&quot; /&gt;

==Description==
In general, a smooth jazz track is downtempo (the most widely played tracks are in the 90&amp;ndash;105 [[beats per minute|BPM]] range), layering a lead, melody-playing instrument ([[saxophone]]s &amp;ndash; especially [[soprano saxophone|soprano]] and [[tenor saxophone|tenor]] &amp;ndash; are the most popular, with [[guitar]]s a close second) over a backdrop that typically consists of programmed rhythms and various [[synth pad|pad]]s and/or samples.

Smooth jazz groups or recording artists tend to play their instruments in a melodic fashion such that they are recognizable within just a few measures; this category includes names such as saxophonists [[Kenny G]], [[David Sanborn]], the late [[George Howard (jazz)|George Howard]], [[Najee]] and [[Art Porter, Jr.]]; guitarists [[George Benson]],  [[Earl Klugh]], [[Marc Antoine (musician)|Marc Antoine]], [[Peter White (musician)|Peter White]], [[Jonathan Butler]], [[Ray Parker, Jr]], [[Norman Brown (guitarist)|Norman Brown]], [[Ronny Jordan]], and Yves Vincent; pianists [[Joe Sample]], [[David Benoit (musician)|David Benoit]], and [[Bradley Joseph]]. Some performers, such as [[Dave Koz]], [[Bob James (musician)|Bob James]], and [[Nathan East]] are notable for their numerous collaborations with many of the genre's big names.  Groups include [[Fourplay]], [[Pieces of a Dream (band)|Pieces of a Dream]], [[Acoustic Alchemy]], [[Airborne (band)|Airborne]] and [[The Rippingtons]].   Female performers include [[Keiko Matsui]], [[Joyce Cooling]], [[Mindi Abair]], [[Candy Dulfer]], [[Sade (band)|Sade]], [[Brenda Russell]], [[Pamela Williams]], [[Regina Belle]], and [[Anita Baker]].

== Origins ==
Smooth jazz can be traced to at least the late 1960s.  Producer [[Creed Taylor]] worked with [[guitarist]] [[Wes Montgomery]] on three popular records (1967's ''A Day in the Life'' and ''Down Here on the Ground'' and 1968's ''Road Song'') consisting of instrumental versions of familiar [[pop music|pop]] songs such as &quot;[[Eleanor Rigby]]&quot;, &quot;[[I Say a Little Prayer]]&quot; and &quot;[[Scarborough Fair (ballad)|Scarborough Fair]]&quot;. While jazz musicians had performed pop hits since the early 1900s, Montgomery's commercially successful albums were somewhat of a departure from this tradition, containing little of the complex improvisation of his earlier recordings and being aimed squarely at pop music audiences. Reviewing ''A Day In the Life'', critic Scott Yannow&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-day-in-the-life-r144205&lt;/ref&gt; writes, &quot;although the jazz content is almost nil, the results are pleasing as background music.&quot;

From these commercially successful records with Montgomery, Taylor founded [[CTI Records]]. Many established jazz performers recorded for CTI (including [[Freddie Hubbard]], [[Chet Baker]], [[George Benson]] and [[Stanley Turrentine]]).  The records recorded under Taylor's guidance were typically aimed as much at pop audiences as at jazz fans, with ornate string section arrangements, and a much stronger emphasis on melody than was typical in jazz.  Some critics and jazz fans expressed a distaste for CTI releases, but much of the label's output is now generally well-regarded: Yanow writes, &quot;Taylor had great success in balancing the artistic with the commercial.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p130626|pure_url=yes}} Creed Taylor] biography&lt;/ref&gt; Hubbard's funk/fusion album ''[[Red Clay]]'', issued by CTI and containing a lengthy cover of [[John Lennon]]'s &quot;[[Cold Turkey]]&quot; and has been described as arguably &quot;Hubbard's finest moment as a leader.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmusic.com/album/red-clay-r104746/review&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Benson, jazz musicians in the 1970s whose style would be called smooth jazz today included [[Bob James (musician)|Bob James]], [[David Sanborn]], [[Herb Alpert]], [[Al Jarreau]] and [[Chuck Mangione]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Rodman, &quot;Smooth moves: Did Kenny G ruin the notion of smooth jazz?&quot; ''Chicago Sun-Times'', July 23, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Others with a similar style included [[Earl Klugh]], [[Lee Ritenour]], [[Larry Carlton]], [[Grover Washington, Jr.]], [[Spyro Gyra]] (with songs such as &quot;[[Morning Dance (song)|Morning Dance]]&quot;), [[Sérgio Mendes]],  [[Tom Scott (musician)|Tom Scott]], [[Dave Grusin|Dave]] and [[Don Grusin]],  and [[Joe Sample]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

[[The Weather Channel (United States)|The Weather Channel]] released its first compilation album in 2007, ''[[The Weather Channel Presents: The Best of Smooth Jazz]]'', based on collections of popular smooth jazz music played on the ''Local On the 8s'' segments. It peaked at #1 on [[Billboard Magazine|Billboard's]] Top Contemporary Jazz charts in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/esearch/chart_display.jsp?cfi=318&amp;cfgn=Albums&amp;cfn=Top+Contemporary+Jazz&amp;ci=3093502&amp;cdi=9730786&amp;cid=04%2F19%2F2008

In 2008, their second compilation CD containing their most requested music was released, titled ''[[The Weather Channel Presents: Smooth Jazz II]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jazzhq.blogspot.com/2008/05/weather-channel-best-of-smooth-jazz-ii.html
|title=Weather Channel, Best of Smooth Jazz II|publisher=[[JazzHQ]]|accessdate=2008-05-28 |work= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artists include [[Russ Freeman (guitarist)|Russ Freeman &amp; The Rippingtons]],   [[Jeff Lorber]], [[Ramsey Lewis|Ramsey Lewis Trio]], [[Bradley Joseph]], [[Bernie Williams]], [[David Benoit (musician)|David Benoit]], [[Spyro Gyra]], [[Norman Brown (guitarist)|Norman Brown]], [[Chris Geith]], [[Joe Sample]], [[Charlie Parker|Charlie Parker Quartet]], and [[Eric Marienthal]].

==Derivatives==
A recent development is [[urban contemporary]], which incorporates aspects of [[hip hop music|hip-hop]]. This style is aimed at audiences who would normally listen to radio stations that play a mix of hip-hop and R&amp;B. Among the musicians who frequently perform urban jazz are [[Dave Koz]], [[Boney James]], [[Paul Jackson Jr.]], Nick Colionne, [[Bobby Perry]], Urban Jazz Coalition, Streetwize, and Tha' Hot Club.

Urban jazz includes artists such as [[Bob Baldwin]], [[Michael Lington]], [[Brian Bromberg]], [[David Lanz]], [[Bobby Ricketts]], [[Kim Waters]], [[Daniele Caprelli]], [[Ken Navarro]], [[Walter Beasley]], [[Peter White (musician)|Peter White]].

Another nascent trend involves the fusion of smooth jazz and [[electronica]], the results of which are similar to what has, among electronica enthusiasts, come to be called &quot;chill.&quot; New York's WQCD integrated chill into its format in 2004, and DJ Rafe Gomez pioneered the usage of playlists that blended tracks from both genres, in addition to selections from the 70s jazz fusion and latin jazz, 80s jazz-funk, 90s acid jazz, and contemporary club jazz/nu jazz genres.

==Public reception==
The music of musicians like [[Pat Metheny]], [[David Sanborn]], [[Marcus Miller]], and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] is often classified as smooth jazz.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The [[Allmusic]] guide article on &quot;fusion&quot; states that &quot;unfortunately, as it became a money-maker and as rock declined artistically from the mid-'70s on, much of what was labeled fusion was actually a combination of jazz with easy-listening pop music and lightweight R&amp;B.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Available online at: {{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d299|pure_url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music critic [[Piero Scaruffi]] has called pop-fusion music &quot;...mellow, bland, romantic music&quot; made by &quot;mediocre musicians&quot; and &quot;derivative bands.&quot; Scaruffi criticized some of the albums of Michael and [[Randy Brecker]] as &quot;trivial dance music&quot; and stated that alto saxophonist [[David Sanborn]] recorded &quot;[t]rivial collections&quot; of &quot;...catchy and danceable pseudo-jazz&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Piero Scaruffi, 2006. Available at: http://www.scaruffi.com/history/jazz17a.html&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenny G]] in particular is often criticized by both fusion and jazz fans, and some musicians, while having become a huge commercial success. Music reviewer George Graham argues that the “so-called ‘smooth jazz’ sound of people like Kenny G has none of the fire and creativity that marked the best of the fusion scene during its heyday in the 1970s”.&lt;ref&gt;George Graham review - Available online at: http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:5Z0ukGXTz54J:georgegraham.com/reviews/methgrp.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The over-30 audience in the US enjoys the melodic nature of the music, its frequent revival of [[Pop music|Pop]] standards and its freedom from [[Wiktionary:histrionic|histrionic]] vocal lines{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}). The appeal of smooth jazz is also developing in the late-teen and 20s age groups in East Asia (especially Japan{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}) and in Europe.  In particular, late-night coffee bars play smooth jazz in order to create an enticing late-night, non-alcoholic social atmosphere where conversation is encouraged.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

In the [[United Kingdom]], British jazz performer [[Digby Fairweather]], before the launch of UK jazz station [[theJazz]], denounced the change to a smooth jazz format on defunct radio station [[102.2 Jazz FM]], stating that the owners, [[GMG Radio]] were responsible for the &quot;attempted rape and (fortunately abortive) re-definition of the music — is one that no true jazz lover within the boundaries of the [[M25 motorway|M25]] will ever find it possible to forget or forgive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyglobalmusic.com/fly/archives/europe_features/new_jazz_station_goodbye_to_th.html|title=New Jazz Station - Goodbye to the Smooth, Hello to the Classics|accessdate=2008-02-16|last=Fairweather|first=Digby|date=2006-11-18|publisher=Fly Global Music Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Radio ==
===Early history===
Smooth jazz as a [[radio format]] has its roots in the construction of what were once called &quot;[[beautiful music]]&quot; stations, which generally played fifteen-minute sets consisting of instrumentals bookending a vocal song or two.   The incubators of the format were specialty shows at night or on the weekends, in places such as Atlanta (WQXI-FM), Miami (WWWL-FM) and San Antonio (KTFM).  The first jazz radio station to attempt to reach an audience beyond hardcore jazz fans full-time was New York's WRVR-FM, which was acquired by Sonderling Broadcasting in 1976. Under its new management, WRVR more than tripled its audience by emphasizing artists like [[George Benson]] and [[Pat Metheny]] that were crossing over to more popular formats.  Other early pioneers included [[WHKQ|WLOQ]] in Orlando, Florida (which began programming such a format in 1977), Russ Davis in Atlanta and &quot;Jazz Flavours&quot;, Ross Block, Dave Caprita and Stu Grant at Love 94FM with &quot;Sunday Morning Jazz&quot; in Miami and Art Good at [[KIFM]] San Diego with &quot;Lights Out San Diego&quot;.

In 1983, &quot;adult alternative&quot; became a well-defined radio format, with jazz, [[New Age music]] and [[adult contemporary music]]. In 1987, the switch by [[album-oriented rock]] [[KMET (defunct)|KMET]] in [[Los Angeles]] to [[KTWV]] &quot;The Wave&quot; made the format more popular.&lt;ref name=Magnet&gt;&quot;Adult alternative a magnet for affluence,&quot; ''Billboard'', 8/6/94, Vol. 106, Issue 32.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After programmer Frank Cody began &quot;The Wave&quot; in Los Angeles and the simultaneous [[KIFM]] (San Diego) and the eclectic [[KKSF]] (San Francisco), the number of stations banking on &quot;The Wave's&quot; softer sound grew quickly. Those included &quot;[[WKKV|Breezin' 100.7]]&quot; in Milwaukee and KHIH in Denver programmed by consultant Gary Guthrie, WNUA (Chicago) consulted by Cody, [[WMXD|WVAE]] (a short-lived Wave network affiliate from 1987-89) and [[WDMK|WJZZ]] in Detroit, [[WNWV]] in Cleveland (which began as a Wave affiliate but eventually moved to local programming), Ohio, and the re-launch of [[WRXP|WQCD]] (CD101.9), New York. Also [[WMIA-FM|Love94FM]] [WWWL, later WLVE] in [[Miami]]/[[Ft. Lauderdale]], an early innovator with its &quot;Sunday Morning Jazz&quot; show went totally smooth jazz by 1990, not long after The Wave in Los Angeles had switched to the format.  The format had been deemed &quot;New Age&quot; originally and radio stations like WNUA Chicago and KNUA Seattle emulated the phrase in their call letters.  For a short time in 1987-1988, Chicago actually had two such stations, as the &quot;Wave&quot; network was also heard on WTWV-FM, licensed to suburban Des Plaines (now [[WPPN]]).

In the late 80's, research firm Cody/Leach conducted a study for WNUA/Chicago; it was through the verbatim responses from listeners that the name &quot;Smooth Jazz&quot; was identified.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}  WNUA then adopted the slogan &quot;Smooth Rock and Smooth Jazz&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Feder, &quot;It's mayhem in a.m. on six radio stations,&quot; ''Chicago Sun-Times'', October 25, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; replacing the old slogan &quot;Music for a New Age&quot; as the station added more vocals and dropped most &quot;avant-garde&quot; instrumentals.&lt;ref&gt; Robert Feder, &quot;New Saturday shows follow Pee-wee's lead,&quot; ''Chicago Sun-Times'', June 2, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the direction of General Manager John Gehron, &quot;Smooth Rock&quot; was dropped.  Cody is credited with making &quot;Smooth Jazz&quot; a household name, giving rise to its nationwide proliferation through the firm Broadcast Architecture, the widely syndicated “The Jazz Show with David Sanborn” and his association with saxophonist Dave Koz. Cody was also responsible for overseeing the launch of the now defunct [[Satellite Music Network]]'s syndicated &quot;Wave&quot; format.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

Over a six-year period ending in 1993, the format increased its audience by 140 percent, and from 1992 to 1993, by 67 percent. Listeners were 71 percent [[White people|white]] and 28 percent [[African- American|black]]. Advertisers recognized that adult alternative music tended to attract buyers of upscale items.&lt;ref name=Magnet/&gt; The format became much more jazz-oriented, with very little new age, and even while emphasizing young artists, the format kept its heritage acts as well.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Stark, &quot;Hip jazz boosts adult alternative radio,&quot; ''Billboard'', 4/15/95, Vol. 107, Issue 15, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; However, smooth jazz did add artists from adult contemporary music to increase its popularity with a larger audience; artists included [[Mariah Carey]], [[Bonnie Raitt]], [[Sting (musician) |Sting]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Paul Simon]], [[Michael Bolton]], [[Tina Turner]], and [[Janet Jackson]].&lt;ref name=Boehlert/&gt;  The smooth jazz format also added [[R &amp; B]]; according to Cary Goldberg of JVC, [[Paul Hardcastle]] &quot;brought a sophisticated, urban groove&quot; to the format. She said, &quot;Instead of bringing jazz to R&amp;B, he's brought an R&amp;B groove to contemporary jazz.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michele Botwin, &quot;Paul Hardcastle's Jazzmasters are choice of adult alternative radio,&quot; ''Billboard'', 7/16/94, Vol. 106, Issue 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The smooth jazz music mix included 70 percent instrumentals and 30 percent vocals. Programmers no longer regarded the music as merely &quot;background&quot;. The format's most successful stations included WNUA, KKSF, KOAI, WNWV and KIFM, as well as WQCD, which had a significant rating increase in Fall 1993.&lt;ref name=Boehlert&gt;Eric Boehlert, &quot;Adult alternative embraces AC hitmakers,&quot; ''Billboard'', 4/23/94, Vol. 106, Issue 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Smooth jazz (still referred to as &quot;adult alternative&quot; in ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' until the magazine began using the term for [[adult album alternative|album alternative]]&lt;ref&gt;Carrie Borzillo, &quot;Meeting adult alternative's unique needs,&quot; ''Billboard'', 4/22/95, Vol. 107, Issue 16.&lt;/ref&gt;) experienced the largest increase in &quot;power ratio&quot; in 1994; the term refers to the relationship between audience share and advertising revenue. Although the format was increasing in popularity, ''[[M Street Journal]]'' counted 43 stations in the format, down from 64 in 1989. But new stations such as [[KLTH|KKJZ]] in [[Portland, Oregon]] and [[KMEZ|KLJZ]] in [[New Orleans]] experienced immediate success.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Stark, &quot;Power ratios study finds adult alternative top gainer,&quot; ''Billboard'', 4/1/95, Vol. 107, Issue 13.&lt;/ref&gt; New stations in 1995 included [[WDAF-FM|KCIY]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]]; [[KZJK|KMJZ]] in [[Minneapolis]]; [[WBUF|WSJZ]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]; and [[WVMA (FM)|WJCD]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis Stark and Eric Boehlert, &quot;3 more stations flip to adult alternative; River City moves to purchase Keymarket,&quot; ''Billboard'', 4/8/95, Vol. 107, Issue 14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=8609&amp;Callsign=WDAF|title=Call Sign History (WDAF-FM)|accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=54425&amp;Callsign=KZJK|title=Call Sign History (KZJK)|accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=53699&amp;Callsign=WBUF|title=Call Sign History (WBUF)|accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=69570&amp;Callsign=WVMA|title=Call Sign History (WVMA)|accessdate=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Smooth jazz&quot; has gone on to be recognized as a successful radio format, first emerging in name in the mid- to late-1980s (often, they would be transitioned from existing &quot;[[new age music|new age]]&quot; stations) and subsequently spreading into most radio markets within the United States and many without.

===Smooth jazz radio today===

====Recent problems====

The smooth jazz radio format continued to grow and thrive through the 1990s and early 2000s, though in the late 2000s most markets began losing smooth jazz stations. In a number of media markets, this format is no longer available over the air except online or on HD Radio.&lt;ref name=&quot;WashingtonPost&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/07/AR2008030700946.html|title=Smooth Jazz: Gentle Into That Good Night?|date=2008-03-09|last=Fisher|first=Marc|accessdate=2008-12-26|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the most prominent of the few remaining commercial (and independently-programmed) smooth jazz stations are [[WSBZ]] &quot;The Seabreeze&quot; in Destin, Florida, [[WEIB]] in Northampton, Massachusetts, and [[KYSJ]] in Coos Bay, Oregon.

Three of the originators of the smooth jazz format - WQCD in [[New York City]], WNUA in Chicago, and KKSF in San Francisco - have all signed off in the last several years. WQCD became album-rocker WRXP on February 5, 2008 (which later became all-news [[WRXP]] in 2011); KKSF shifted to [[classic rock]] as &quot;The Band&quot; on May 18, 2009; and just four days later, WNUA abruptly dropped the format for &quot;Mega&quot; (a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] pop format). The demise of these pioneering smooth jazz stations seems particularly indicative of the problems within the format.

(The switch from smooth jazz WQCD to album-rock WRXP proved to be a ratings disaster, however. As a rock station, WRXP was something of an anachronism in New York -- a city long dominated by urban, R&amp;B and hip-hop-formatted stations such as [[WBLS]], [[WRKS]] (Kiss FM) and [[WHTZ]]. Most of WRXP's target audience had long ago fled to the suburbs. In July 2011, WRXP was sold to Merlin Media, which turned it into an all-news station&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-07-14/entertainment/29788740_1_wrxp-merlin-media-emmis | location=New York | work=Daily News | first=David | last=Hinckley | title=WRXP shifts from contemporary rock to news channel as it changes hands from Emmis to Merlin Media | date=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;, only to change it back to rock after the all-news format was an even larger failure. &quot;This change might seem to again support the often-heard mantra that when it comes to radio music, New York is a rhythm town, not a rock town,&quot; the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' noted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/television/wrxp-shifts-contemporary-rock-news-channel-hands-emmis-merlin-media-article-1.156496#ixzz1h1dvnioY | location=New York | work=Daily News | first=David | last=Hinckley | title=WRXP shifts from contemporary rock to news channel as it changes hands from Emmis to Merlin Media | date=2011-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;) 

Smooth jazz has also disappeared from commercial radio in most other major or medium-sized markets, including Miami; Atlanta; [[WDJO|Cincinnati]]; Dallas; Minneapolis; Philadelphia; [[WZFT|Baltimore]]; [[WMAL-FM|Washington]]; Houston; Indianapolis; Sacramento; Dayton, Ohio; Milwaukee; [[WNND|Columbus, Ohio]]; [[WHFS-FM|Tampa, Florida]]; [[WLMI|Lansing, Michigan]]; [[KRVR|Modesto, California]]; and most recently, [[WHKQ|Orlando, Florida]] and [[WKZF|Harrisburg, Pennsylvania]].  Many of these stations continue to program smooth jazz via HD subchannels or online streams.

Canada's highest-profile smooth jazz station, [[CHKX-FM|CIWV-FM]], now [[CHKX-FM]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], abandoned the format in late July 2011, switching to [[country music]] instead and moving the jazz format to an online stream only.  And after Christmas 2011, [[CJGV-FM]], the last English-speaking smooth jazz station in Canada, switched to an adult contemporary format, leaving Francophone [[CKLX-FM]] in Montreal, Quebec as the only remaining station in the format in Canada.

However, smooth jazz or some variant thereof has made a minor comeback in some markets, via AM stations (see below), FM [[HD Radio]] side channel/analog translator combos, or so-called &quot;Franken-FM's&quot; (actually low-power analog television stations on Channel 6 which serve a double function as radio stations due to the audio portion of the broadcast being audible on 87.75 MHz, possible because the FCC has not yet required low-power TV stations to convert to digital transmission).  Such &quot;Franken-FM's&quot; have popped up in [[Chicago]] (WLFM-LP, which dropped the format in May 2012 for alternative rock as [[WKQX-LP]]) and [[Anchorage, Alaska]] ([[KNIK-LP]], using the call sign of [[KMVN|a former smooth jazz station there]] which had flipped to adult contemporary).  FM HD side channel/analog translator combos have also allowed the format to return to the airwaves in [[Detroit]] and [[Orlando, Florida]], via HD side channels of [[WGPR]]-FM and [[WMGF]]-FM respectively; the Orlando station images itself with the call letters of the market's former full-power smooth jazz station [[WHKQ|WLOQ]], although its call sign is not legally WLOQ. The Detroit translator has since been ordered off the air by the FCC due to interference with a [[Toledo, Ohio]] station on the same frequency. 

In January 2012, in a rare case, a former smooth jazz station actually returned to its former format after the replacement format had failed.  [[WNWV]]-FM in Cleveland had dropped its long-running &quot;Wave&quot; smooth-jazz format in favor of [[adult alternative]] after Christmas of 2009, under the ownership of Elyria-Lorain Broadcasting.  In January 4, 2012, new owners Rubber City Radio Group restored the &quot;Wave&quot; format to the analog radio dial in Cleveland as a Smooth AC outlet, after a period of stunting with [[Christmas music]].  Shortly afterward, it was reported that [[KMVV]]-FM in Anchorage, which had dropped its [[Rhythmic AC]] format in November 2011 to stunt with Christmas music, would itself be returning with a smooth jazz format under the name &quot;The Oasis&quot; - thereby giving Anchorage ''two'' choices for smooth jazz (with &quot;Franken-FM&quot; KNIK-LP offering a mix of jazz, including some smooth jazz, and blues). As of July 2012, though, the station has not returned to the air.

====Reasons====
The decline in popularity of the smooth jazz format has been blamed on a variety of factors, including lack of exposing compelling new music, over-reliance on instrumental cover versions of pop songs similar to the mostly-defunct [[Beautiful Music]] format, and Arbitron's [[Portable People Meter|PPM]] reports showing lower ratings&lt;ref name=&quot;KJZN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fresnobee.com/entertainment/story/1373796.html|title=Jazz station moves to talk format|date=2009-05-01|accessdate=2009-05-03|last=Bentley|first=Rick|publisher=Fresno Bee}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; returns for smooth jazz stations than the traditional diary system had. Lack of revenue and the genre not being viable during the [[Late-2000s recession|current economic crisis]] have also been cited as reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;WDSJ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daytondailynews.com/entertainment/music/local-radio-station-changes-format-107476.html|title=Local radio station changes format|date=2009-05-05|last=Moss|first=Khalid|accessdate=2009-05-05|publisher=Dayton Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many purists of the format also feel that the smooth jazz interpretation has strayed too far from its roots in contemporary jazz and new age music by over-relying on soft urban vocals, with R&amp;B artists such as [[Beyoncé Knowles]] and [[Aretha Franklin]] now staples of many smooth-jazz playlists. Others indicate that the repetition of the same tracks on stations -- particularly those owned by [[Clear Channel Communications]]&lt;ref name=&quot;ContraCostaTimes&quot; /&gt; -- and the reduction of artists recording tracks resulting in fewer tracks for airplay&lt;ref name=&quot;WNWV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/tv/index.ssf/2009/12/wnwv_the_wave_soon_to_flip_for.html|title=WNWV &quot;The Wave&quot; to flip format from smooth jazz to adult album alternative|date=2009-12-23|accessdate=2009-12-31|last=Washington|first=Julie|publisher=Cleveland.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; may have also contributed to the decline.

{{rquote|right|Time to stop complaining about it not being the way it used to be ... and start embracing the way it is and the way it’s going to be in the future ... whatever that may be! Hello, Tomorrow.|Dave Koz&lt;ref name=&quot;DaveKoz&quot; /&gt;}}American saxophonist Dave Koz responded back in November 2009 to the claims that the smooth jazz radio genre was in decline by stating that although the audience has aged and not enough young people were embracing the format, making it harder to gain advertising revenue, the genre is still seeing the support in record sales and audiences at shows. He also suggested that the format may move from a genre covered by big FM stations to one covered by smaller stations, in particular [[Internet radio]] stations (such as [http://www.boomerradio.com/playernew/player.html?stream=smoothjazz&amp;u=true&amp;format=smoothjazz Boomer Radio Smooth Jazz Favorites]) which were showing an increase in popularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;DaveKoz&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiofacts.com/2009/11/30/dave-koz-says-stop-complaining-about-smooth-jazz-radios-decline-because/|title=Dave Koz says: ‘Stop complaining’ about smooth jazz radio’s decline because…|accessdate=2009-12-31|publisher=Radio Facts}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the former terrestrial smooth jazz stations, including the former KHJZ in Houston, the former WJZW in Washington, WVMV in Detroit, and the former WQCD in New York, continue to offer smooth jazz programming as Internet streams or as offerings on their HD subchannels. Some stations which are still providing smooth jazz and are still popular in their respective markets, including [[Jazz FM (UK)|Jazz FM]] in the United Kingdom used to integrate traditional and popular jazz and [[jazz standards]] alongside smooth jazz tracks in their playlists.&lt;ref name=&quot;WashingtonPost&quot; /&gt;

====The Smooth AC format====

One tack several smooth jazz stations have taken, in order to attract more younger listeners (particularly in the important 25-54 age demographic) without completely alienating jazz fans, is to evolve the format into a hybrid known as '''Smooth Adult Contemporary'''.  Smooth AC stations play more of the vocalists popular on smooth jazz stations, such as [[Luther Vandross]], [[Sade Adu|Sade]], [[Robin Thicke]], [[Anita Baker]], and [[Basia Trzetrzelewska|Basia]], while incorporating more mainstream and urban AC material from artists such as [[Celine Dion]], [[Mary J. Blige]], and [[Maroon 5]] and limiting instrumentals to two or three cuts an hour (and usually restricting airplay of instrumentals to artists such as [[Kenny G]], [[Dave Koz]] and [[Chuck Mangione]] who have had crossover pop success).  In markets where they exist, Smooth AC stations are meant to fill a void for soft music created by the mainstream Adult Contemporary format's overall move toward more uptempo adult Top-40 musical fare.

One of the first high-profile stations to adopt the Smooth AC approach was pioneering smooth-jazz station [[KTWV]] in Los Angeles (&quot;The Wave&quot;), under new program director [[Jhani Kaye]].  KTWV's transition was successful in improving the station's 25-54 ratings, and since then several other smooth-jazz stations have made a similar transition, including the late WLFM-LP in Chicago, [[WXJZ]] in Gainesville, Florida, KIFM in San Diego, and most recently, WNWV in Cleveland, Ohio, which relaunched under its former &quot;107-3 The Wave&quot; identity as a Smooth AC on January 4, 2012.  KIFM has since dropped all remaining instrumental smooth jazz remnants from its playlist and now essentially an all-vocals soft AC with some smooth jazz vocals still included. [[KJZY]] in the Santa Rosa, California, market also supplements its homegrown Smooth AC format with some [[adult standards]] artists like [[Tony Bennett]], [[Rod Stewart]], and [[Frank Sinatra]].

KTWV, KIFM and WNWV continue to program &quot;traditional&quot; smooth jazz formats on HD subchannels; KIFM's HD-2 features &quot;Pure Smooth Jazz,&quot; while KTWV and WNWV program &quot;Wave Classics,&quot; featuring vintage smooth jazz cuts no longer played on the main station, on their HD-2 feeds.

Other former smooth-jazz stations have evolved to [[Rhythmic Oldies]] formats while maintaining their previous call letters, notably [[KOAS]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] and [[KYOT]] (now known as &quot;Eva&quot;) in Phoenix.  KOAS saw its ratings in the 25-54 age demographics improve after moving to its &quot;old school&quot; format.

====Non-commercial and AM stations====

By 2009, as smooth jazz continued its rapid decline on the commercial radio airwaves, a growing number of non-commercial stations have taken up the music and added it to their programming. Among non-commercial stations now playing smooth jazz include [[WVSU-FM|WVSU]] in Birmingham, Alabama; [[WFSS]] in Fayetteville, North Carolina; [[WRMU]] in Alliance, Ohio;  [[WCRX-LP]] in Columbus, Ohio; [[WFSK]] in Nashville, Tennessee; [[KBBG]] in Waterloo, Iowa; [[KUNV]] in Las Vegas, Nevada; [[WONB]] in Ada, Ohio (on Sundays); [[LPFM]] broadcaster [[WGRV-LP]] in Melbourne, Florida, and nearby communities via translators; and most recently, [[WBWH-LP]] in [[Bluffton, Ohio]], which has extended its Sunday-night show &quot;The Chillout Sessions&quot; (featuring a mix of smooth jazz, smooth vocals, and chill music, hosted by Donald Isaac) into its primary format as of October 2011.  In addition, some commercial stations which present the format on their HD side channels, such as [[KKCW]] in Portland, Oregon, and WDZH in Detroit, do so without commercial interruption.

One of the longest-running non-commercial smooth jazz radio programs in the United States is &quot;The [[Quiet Storm]],&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wgdr.org/ai1ec_event/the-quiet-storm/?instance_id=69571&lt;/ref&gt; which airs weekly on the community-based [[WGDR]]-FM in Plainfield, Vermont and its sister station, [[WGDH]]-FM in Hardwick, Vermont, both owned by [[Goddard College]]. Launched in 1998 and hosted by Skeeter Sanders, &quot;The Quiet Storm&quot; is actually a 50-50 mix of smooth jazz and soft R&amp;B, presented in &quot;Triple-A&quot; (Album Adult Alternative) style, with a strong emphasis on &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; album tracks that most commercial stations often ignore. The show takes its name from the early-evening program pioneered in 1976 by [[WHUR]]-FM in Washington, D.C. and duplicated with great success as a 24-hour format three years later by [[KBLX]]-FM in San Francisco (whose owner, [[Entercom Broadcasting]], dropped the format after it purchased the station in April 2012 -- following the bankruptcy of former owner [[Inner City Broadcasting]] -- in favor of a more generic [[Urban AC]] sound). 

In September 2011, a syndicated commercial version of Sanders' &quot;Quiet Storm&quot; program began broadcasting on the Internet-only [[Fishbowl Radio Network]].&lt;ref&gt;http://fbrn.us/storm.html&lt;/ref&gt; Exactly one year later, the program made its overseas debut in the United Kingdom on London's [[Hot FM]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hot-fm.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

In some markets, the smooth jazz format has also found a new home on the AM dial.  The format had brief comebacks on the AM dial in Reno, Nevada and Atlanta, Georgia (the latter during weekends only).  The only AM station to program the format full-time as of July 2012 is [[KQJZ]] in Kalispell, Montana, at 1340 AM, which simulcasts on an FM translator at 103.5.  Most recently, in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], Clear Channel (who had recently dropped the format on [[KYOT]]-FM to evolve to Urban Oldies) returned smooth jazz to the air evenings, overnights and weekends on [[KOY (AM)|KOY]], an AM [[adult standards]] station.  Radio One made a similar move in Detroit in May 2012, switching nighttime programming on [[WCHB]] and its FM translator to smooth jazz.

In Orlando and Honolulu, FM translators have also signed on relaying smooth jazz-formatted HD side channels.

====Specialty shows====

It is not uncommon for [[adult contemporary music]] or [[urban AC]] stations to devote some of their weekend programming to the format in an effort to serve a [[niche market]] without devoting an entire station to it. Some examples include [[WRRM]] Warm 98 in Cincinnati,  [[WZUN]] in Syracuse, New York, [[KVIL]] in Dallas, Texas, [[WMXC]] in Mobile, Alabama, and [[WSOL-FM|WSOL]] in Jacksonville, Florida.  An oddity in this category is [[WLAV]] in Grand Rapids, Michigan, a [[classic rock]] station which features a &quot;cool jazz&quot; brunch show on Sunday mornings.  [[WZTK]] in [[Burlington, North Carolina]], a former talk station which switched in 2012 to [[regional Mexican]] programming, also formerly devoted most of its weekend programming to smooth jazz, using programming provided by [[Dial Global]] and playing much of the library from the now-defunct Jones Radio Network Smooth Jazz format.

===Syndicated shows===
In January 2007,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadcastarchitecture.com/Press.html&lt;/ref&gt; Broadcast Architecture launched the satellite-delivered Smooth Jazz Network, featuring smooth jazz artists Dave Koz, Kenny G, Norman Brown, Brian Culbertson, Paul Hardcastle and Ramsey Lewis as on-air hosts.  The network soon spread to 25 markets across the US, with among its more notable affiliates including [[WMOV-FM|WJCD]] in Norfolk, Virginia; [[WLMI|WJZL]] in Lansing, Michigan; [[WAVD|WQJZ]] in Ocean Pines, Maryland; [[KJZS]] in Reno, Nevada; [[WKYL]] in Lexington, Kentucky; [[KORL-FM|KORL]] in Honolulu, Hawaii; [[WAEG]] in Savannah, Georgia; and [[WAUN]] in Green Bay, Wisconsin.  [[WKQX-LP|WLFM-LP]] in Chicago also began as a 100% satellite-fed Broadcast Architecture affiliate, but soon went to mainly local programming during weekdays with the satellite feed filling most of the remainder of the schedule.  Of these stations, only WAEG and WAUN continue to broadcast the Smooth Jazz Network (WAUN actually dropped it for a time to switch to the related Smooth AC format, but returned to the Smooth Jazz Network by June 2012); WJCD, WQJZ, WJZL, WKYL, KJZS, WLFM and KORL have all switched to other formats, although KORL continues to broadcast Smooth Jazz Network programming on an HD Radio side channel which is simulcast on an analog translator.  In Reno, the format was briefly revived on an AM station, which dropped it in the summer of 2012.  WLFM-LP moved to the related Smooth AC format for a time, but had evolved back to Smooth Jazz at the time it dropped the format in May 2012 to become [[WKQX-LP]].    

In addition to WAUN and WAEG, the Smooth Jazz Network is also carried on [[KQJZ]] in Kalispell, Montana; [[KMYT (FM)|KMYT]] in Temecula, California; [[KJJZ]] in Palm Springs, California; [[KYZK]] in Sun Valley, translator W273CA &quot;102.5 WLOQ&quot; in Orlando, Florida, simulcasting the HD-2 feed of adult contemporary station [[WMGF]]-FM; and on a part-time basis on [[WCHB]] in Detroit and [[KOY (AM)|KOY]] in Phoenix, Arizona (both airing Smooth Jazz Network programming at nights during the week with extended hours on weekends).  It is also programmed on HD Radio subchannels in various markets, including San Francisco, Washington, Miami, Baltimore, Houston, Nashville, Memphis, St. Louis, San Antonio, and Grand Rapids, Michigan, and is available for streaming via [[Clear Channel Communications]]' [[iHeartRadio]] application.

In response to the growing trend toward Smooth AC, Broadcast Architecture has also begun marketing a Smooth AC Network (formerly named &quot;Chillout Radio Network&quot;, despite the lack of so-called [[chill music]] in the network's playlist, and then renamed &quot;Bright Radio Network&quot; before the final name change to &quot;Smooth AC&quot;) featuring the same air talent as the Smooth Jazz Network.  The first Smooth AC Network affiliated station was [[KOCD]] in the [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] market, but that station has since switched format to [[adult hits]].  Currently the Smooth AC network has no full-time affiliate; WXJZ in Gainesville and WNWV in Cleveland program the Smooth AC Network at nights only, and former Smooth AC network affiliates WAUN, KYOT and WLFM-LP (now WKQX-LP) switched to other formats (with WAUN switching back to the Smooth Jazz Network).

The current air talent lineup on the Smooth Jazz and Smooth AC Networks includes Kenny G and Sandy Kovach (formerly of the late WVMV &quot;V98.7&quot; Detroit) mornings, Miranda Wilson middays, Allan Kepler during afternoon drive, and Maria Lopez evenings and overnights, with weekend personalities including Norman Brown, Paul Hardcastle, and Allan Kepler's Smooth Jazz Top 20 Countdown.  Top-selling saxophonist Dave Koz was a former air personality on the Smooth Jazz and Smooth AC networks.

Other weekly syndicated smooth jazz radio shows include the long running Art Good's [[Jazztrax]], &quot;Chill&quot; with saxophonist Mindi Abair, Ramsey Lewis' &quot;Legends Of Jazz&quot; and the weekly two-hour Dave Koz Radio Show.  In the summer of 2007, Broadcast Architecture launched the format's first ever national countdown show, the &quot;Smooth Jazz Top 20 Countdown with Allen Kepler&quot;.  The Smooth Jazz Top 20 now airs in more than 20 radio stations.

Elements of the smooth jazz format are also present in the [[Timeless Cool]] format distributed by Timeless Cool Music, Inc., which features a mixture of smooth and traditional jazz with [[adult standards]] by artists like [[Ray Charles]], [[Madeleine Peyroux]], and [[Bobby Darin]] and [[Adult album alternative|adult alternative]] performers such as [[Jack Johnson (musician)|Jack Johnson]], [[Amy Winehouse]], and [[Annie Lennox]].  However, this format has failed to take off and is as of August 2011 aired on only a small handful of stations nationwide.

Until September 30, 2008, [[Jones Radio Networks]] also distributed a [[Smooth Jazz (radio network)|smooth-jazz format]] via satellite.  This network was discontinued following Jones Radio Networks' purchase by Triton Media Group, owners of the [[Dial Global]] stable of 24/7 formats, and Triton's decision to eliminate Smooth Jazz from its portfolio. Jones' Smooth Jazz network had dwindled to only a handful of affiliates at the time the format was discontinued; most of the remaining Jones stations (i.e. WJZL and WQJZ) were switched over to Broadcast Architecture's network.

===Smooth jazz radio internationally===
The smooth-jazz format was always less common in [[Canada]], possibly due to [[Canadian Content]] regulations and a relative lack of high-profile Canadian smooth-jazz artists (with some exceptions such as [[Diana Krall]] and [[Michael Bublé]], as well as soft AC artists like [[Celine Dion]] or [[Paul Anka]]). In August 2012, the format became completely extinct as a full-time offering on the Canadian airwaves, with the last remaining holdout, Francophone [[CKLX-FM]] in [[Montreal, Quebec|Montreal]], switching to a combination of rock music and talk programming.

In 2011, Canada's two remaining high-profile Anglophone smooth jazz stations both terminated the format, with the aforementioned CIWV-FM switching to country music in July and [[CJGV-FM]] in [[Winnipeg]] dropping its &quot;Groove&quot; format on December 1, 2011, and beginning a period of stunting toward a new adult-contemporary format.  The former CHMC-FM in [[Edmonton, Alberta]] began in 2005 as a smooth jazz station, but switched in 2010 to an &quot;uptempo&quot; Adult Hits format as [[CIUP-FM]]. 

However, in January 2012, Durham Radio, owners of CIWV-FM (now CHKX-FM), applied to relaunch the &quot;Wave&quot; format on the 88.1 FM frequency in [[Toronto]] vacated by [[CKLN-FM]] when that station was ordered off the air by the CRTC.  Durham Radio is one of nearly thirty applicants for the frequency, and the only one proposing such a format.  In the meantime, some smooth jazz is available to Toronto listeners on [[CKFG-FM]] &quot;G98.7&quot;, a recent sign-on in late 2011 featuring an eclectic Urban AC format.

New and innovative material from the UK, Europe and Australia has largely failed to gain airplay in the US. Well financed and often government-funded radio organisations in the UK, Europe and Australia, coupled with technical developments in the digital radio field, have led to the launch of a number of smooth jazz radio stations in these markets and their playlists are substantially more diverse than in the US.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

In the UK however, the only radio station that regularly played smooth jazz was [[102.2 Jazz FM]] in London and [[100.4 Jazz FM]] in the North West. Upon takeover by the Guardian Media Group in 2003, the station started to create playlists predominantly consisting of easy listening soul and pop. Finally, in March 2004 in the North West and in June 2005 in London, the station changed its name to Smooth FM, and dropped smooth jazz from its playlists altogether. At the same time, GMG launched jazzfm.com in some parts of the UK which after closing in some areas. However, as part of its relaunch, smooth jazz and funk has also been played alongside more mainstream and traditional jazz output as played by former UK jazz station [[theJazz]]. On October 6, 2008 jazzfm.com was relaunched&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.3106.2|title=Jazz FM set to return|date=2008-02-28|accessdate=2008-03-16|publisher=Radio Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; under a three year deal with [[The Local Radio Company]] to relaunch [[Jazz FM (UK)|Jazz FM]]&lt;ref name=&quot;TLRC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotoday.co.uk/news.php?extend.3540.2|title=Wheatley to relaunch Jazz FM|date=2008-06-29|accessdate=2008-06-29|publisher=Radio Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially with smooth jazz output in the daytime and early hours of the morning, however, smooth jazz output has since been dropped from the schedule as of September 2012.
