'''Black metal''' is an [[Extreme metal|extreme]] subgenre of [[heavy metal music]]. Common traits include [[Tempo#Beats per minute|fast tempos]], [[Screaming (music)#Black metal|shrieked vocals]], highly distorted [[Electric guitar|guitars]] played with [[tremolo picking]], [[blast beat]] drumming, [[Lo-fi music|raw]] recording and unconventional [[song structure]]s.

During the 1980s, several [[thrash metal]] bands formed a prototype for black metal. This so-called &quot;first wave&quot; included bands such as [[Venom (band)|Venom]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], [[Hellhammer]] and [[Celtic Frost]].&lt;ref name=sam&gt;{{cite video |last=Dunn |first=Sam |year=2005 |title=[[Metal: A Headbanger's Journey]] |type=motion picture |publisher=Seville Pictures}}&lt;/ref&gt; A &quot;second wave&quot; arose in the early 1990s, spearheaded by [[Norway|Norwegian]] bands such as [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Burzum]], [[Darkthrone]], [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]] and [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]]. The [[early Norwegian black metal scene]] developed the style of their forebears into a distinct genre. Norwegian-inspired black metal scenes emerged throughout Europe and North America, although some other scenes developed their own styles with no connection to the Norwegian one.&lt;ref name=billzebub&gt;{{cite video |last=Debub |first=Bill |year=2007 |title=Black Metal: A Documentary |type=motion picture |publisher=Bill Zebub Productions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially a synonym for &quot;Satanic metal&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McIver |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel McIver |title=Justice for All - The Truth About Metallica |edition=updated |publisher=Omnibus Press |year=2009 |url=http://books.google.de/books?id=SvW-uN-qEbIC&amp;pg=PT98&amp;dq=%22black+metal%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22black%20metal%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; black metal has often been met with hostility from mainstream culture, mainly due to the [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]] and [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]] views of many artists. Moreover, several of the genre's pioneers have been linked with [[Black metal#Church burnings|church burnings]] and murder. Some artists have also been linked to [[neo-Nazism]], although most black metal fans and most prominent black metal artists shun Nazism and oppose its influence on the black metal subculture.&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt;&lt;ref name=kingovhell&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.maelstrom.nu/ezine/interview_iss50_224.php |title=Interview with Jotunspor |last=Škot |first=Mladen |work=maelstrom.nu |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=infernus1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=93004 |title=Blabbermouth.net - Gorgoroth Guitarist Infernus: &quot;I Personally Am Against Racism in Both Thought and Practice |date=15 March 2008 |work=[[Blabbermouth.net]] |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much like [[punk rock|punk]], the black metal community generally condemns the seeking of mainstream success or attention, preferring the genre to remain [[underground music|underground]].

== Characteristics ==

=== Instrumentation ===

Black metal guitarists usually favor high-pitched guitar tones and heavy [[distortion (guitar)|distortion]].{{sfn|Kahn-Harris, Keith|2006|p=4}} The guitar is usually played with much use of fast (un-[[Palm mute|muted]]) [[tremolo picking]].{{sfn|Kahn-Harris, Keith|2006|p=4}}&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Campion |title=In the Face of Death |date=20 February 2005 |publisher=[[Guardian Unlimited]] |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/features/story/0,11710,1419364,00.html |work=[[The Guardian|guardian.co.uk]] |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chronicles&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/Articles/rants/6-668_black_metal_a_brief_guide.aspx |title=CoC : Rant : Black Metal: A Brief Guide |last=Kalis |first=Quentin |date=31 August 2004 |work=[[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]] |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guitarists often use [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonance]]—along with specific [[Musical scale|scales]], [[Interval (music)|intervals]] and [[Guitar chord|chord progressions]]—to create a sense of dread. The [[tritone]] or flat-fifth is often used, for example. [[Guitar solo]]s and low [[guitar tunings]] are rare in black metal.&lt;ref name=chronicles/&gt;

The [[bass guitar]] is seldom used to play stand-alone melodies. It is not uncommon for the bass guitar to be muted against the guitar,&lt;ref name=chronicles/&gt; or for it to [[Homophony|homophonically]] follow the bass lines of the guitar. Typically, [[Drum kit|drumming]] is fast and uses [[Heel-toe technique|double-bass]] and/or [[blast beat]]s.

Black metal songs often stray from [[Song structure (popular music)|conventional song structure]] and often lack clear verse-chorus sections. Instead, many black metal songs contain lengthy and repetitive instrumental sections.

=== Vocals and lyrics ===

Traditional black metal bands usually use high-pitched and raspy vocals which include shrieking, screaming and snarling.{{sfn|Kahn-Harris, Keith|2006|p=4}}&lt;ref name=chronicles/&gt; This vocal style was influenced by [[Quorthon]] of Bathory,{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=18f}} and is one of the traits that distinguishes traditional black metal vocals from those of [[death metal]], which usually uses low-pitched [[Death growl|growls]].

Black metal was originally used as a term for extreme metal bands with [[Satanism|Satanic]] and [[Anti-Christian sentiment|anti-Christian]] lyrics; today, the most common lyrical theme is opposition to Christianity,&lt;ref name=chronicles/&gt; other organized religions, or both. As part of this, many artists write lyrics that could be seen to promote [[atheism]], [[antitheism]], [[paganism]] or [[Satanism]].&lt;ref name=murdermusic&gt;{{cite video |last=Dome |first=Michael |year=2007 |title=Murder Music: Black Metal |type=motion picture |publisher=Rockworld TV}}&lt;/ref&gt; The anti-Christianity of secular or pagan artists is often linked to the [[Christianization]] of their countries. Other oft-explored themes are [[major depressive disorder|depression]], [[nihilism]], misanthropy,&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; [[death]] and other dark topics. However, over time, many artists have begun to focus more on topics like the seasons (particularly [[winter]]), [[nature]], [[mythology]], [[folklore]], [[philosophy]] and [[fantasy]]. (For more information about black metal lyrics, see the [[#Ideology|ideology section]] below.)

=== Production ===

Low-cost production quality was typical for early black metal artists with low budgets, where recordings would often be done in their homes or basements.{{sfn|Kahn-Harris, Keith|2006|p=4}} Even when they were able to raise their production quality, many artists chose to keep making [[low fidelity]] (lo-fi) recordings.&lt;ref name=chronicles/&gt;&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; The reason for this was to stay true to the genre's underground roots and to make the music sound more &quot;raw&quot; and &quot;cold&quot;.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; One of the better-known examples of this is the album ''[[Transilvanian Hunger]]'' by [[Darkthrone]] – a band whom Johnathan Selzer of ''[[Terrorizer (magazine)|Terrorizer]]'' magazine says &quot;represent the [[DIY ethic|DIY aspect]] of black metal&quot;.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; Many have claimed that, originally, black metal was not meant to attract a big audience.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; Vocalist [[Gaahl]] said that during its early years, &quot;black metal was never meant to reach an audience, it was purely for our own satisfaction&quot;.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

[[File:Hindvir Gaulhammer Fest 111008 01 C.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A common black metal trait is the use of [[corpse paint]]]]

=== Imagery and performances ===

Many bands choose not to play live.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Spermeth: ''Besessen von der Dunkelheit und dem Bösen''. In: ''Ablaze'', no. 5, May/June 1995, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=putrid&gt;Ben Ratliff: [http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/15/arts/music/15metal.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=all ''Thank You, Professor, That Was Putrid'']. In: ''[[The New York Times]]'', 14 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Those who do maintain that these &quot;live performances are not for entertainment or spectacle. Sincerity, authenticity and extremity are valued above all else.&quot;{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=47}} Some bands consider their concerts to be rituals{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=47}} and often make use of stage props and theatrics. Many bands, such as [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]] and [[Gorgoroth]], are noted for their controversial shows, which have featured impaled animal heads, mock [[crucifixion]]s, [[List of medieval weapons|medieval weaponry]] and band members doused in animal blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article723414.ece |title=Aftenposten Norway, Norwegian news in English |last=Tisdall |first=Jonathan |date=4 February 2004 |work=aftenposten.no |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Black metal artists often appear dressed in black with [[combat boot]]s, bullet belts, spiked wristbands&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; and [[Cross of St. Peter|inverted crosses]]/[[Sigil of Baphomet|pentagrams]] to reinforce their anti-Christian or anti-religious stance.&lt;ref name=sam/&gt; However, the most stand-out trait is their use of [[corpse paint]] – black and white makeup (sometimes mixed with real or fake blood), which is used to create a corpse-like appearance.

In the early 1990s, most pioneering black metal artists used simple [[black-and-white]] pictures or writing on their record covers.&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt; This could have been meant as a reaction against death metal bands, who at that time had begun to use brightly-colored album artwork.&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt; Most underground black metal artists have continued this style. In the main, black metal album covers are usually atmospheric or provocative; some feature natural or fantasy landscapes (for example [[Burzum]]'s ''[[Filosofem]]'' and [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]]'s ''[[In the Nightside Eclipse]]'') while others are violent, perverted, sacrilegious and iconoclastic (for example [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]]'s ''[[Fuck Me Jesus]]'' and [[Dimmu Borgir]]'s ''[[In Sorte Diaboli]]'').

== History ==

=== First wave ===

The first wave of black metal refers to those bands during the 1980s who influenced the black metal sound and formed a prototype for the genre. They were often [[speed metal]] or [[thrash metal]] bands.&lt;ref name=sam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sharpe-Young |first=Garry |title=Metal: The Definitive Guide |page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term &quot;black metal&quot; was coined by the English band [[Venom (band)|Venom]] with their second album ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'' (1982). Although deemed thrash metal rather than black metal by today's standards,&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; the album's lyrics and imagery focused more on anti-Christian and Satanic themes than any before it. Their music was fast, unpolished in production and with raspy or grunted vocals. Venom's members also adopted [[pseudonym]]s, a practice that would become widespread among black metal musicians.

[[File:Venom live at hellfest.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Venom's album, titled ''[[Black Metal (album)|Black Metal]]'', inspired the name of the genre]]

The [[Denmark|Danish]] band [[Mercyful Fate]] influenced the Norwegian scene with their imagery and lyrics. Frontman [[King Diamond]], who wore ghoulish black-and-white facepaint on stage, inspired what became known as &quot;corpse paint&quot;.

Another major influence on black metal was the [[Sweden|Swedish]] band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], led by Thomas Forsberg (under the pseudonym [[Quorthon]]). Not only was Bathory's music dark, fast, heavily distorted, lo-fi and with anti-Christian lyrics and imagery, Quorthon was also the first to use the &quot;shrieked&quot; vocals that came to define black metal.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=18f}} The band played in this style on their first four albums: ''[[Bathory (album)|Bathory]]'' (1984), ''[[The Return (Bathory album)|The Return of the Darkness and Evil]]'' (1985), ''[[Under the Sign of the Black Mark]]'' (1987) and ''[[Blood Fire Death]]'' (1988). With ''Blood Fire Death'' and the two following albums, Bathory pioneered the style that would become known as [[Viking metal]].

Other artists usually considered part of this movement include [[Hellhammer]] and [[Celtic Frost]] (from [[Switzerland]]), [[Kreator]], [[Sodom (band)|Sodom]] and [[Destruction (band)|Destruction]] (from [[Germany]]),&lt;ref name=killyourself&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lahdenpera |first=Esa |date=1995 |title=Northern Black Metal Legends |journal=Kill Yourself!!! Magazine |issue=4 |url=http://www.fmp666.com/moonlight/mayhem.html |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bulldozer (band)|Bulldozer]] and [[Death SS]] (from [[Italy]]),&lt;ref name=emperor10&gt;''Emperor''.

=== End of the first wave ===

In 1987, in the fifth issue of his ''Slayer'' fanzine, Metalion wrote that &quot;the latest fad of Black/Satanic bands seems to be over&quot;,&lt;ref name=incubus&gt;''Incubus''. In: Jon Kristiansen: ''Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries''. Brooklyn, NY: Bazillion Points Books 2011, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; the tradition being continued by a few bands like Incubus&lt;!-- Do not link to Opprobrium or the alternative rock band here, this is another band. --&gt;&lt;ref name=incubus/&gt; and [[Morbid Angel]]&lt;ref name=incubus/&gt; (from the United States), [[Sabbat (band)|Sabbat]] (from Great Britain),&lt;ref name=incubus/&gt; [[Tormentor]] (from [[Hungary]]), [[Sarcófago]] (from [[Brazil]]), [[Grotesque (band)|Grotesque]]&lt;ref name=tiamat&gt;''Tiamat''.

Second edition. Brooklyn, NY: Bazillion Points 2009, p. 162f., accessed on 24 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; (from Sweden).

In the years before the [[Early Norwegian black metal scene|Norwegian black metal scene]] arose, important recordings were released by [[Root (band)|Root]] and [[Master's Hammer]] (from [[Czechoslovakia]]), [[Von (band)|Von]] (from the United States), [[Blasphemy (band)|Blasphemy]] (from [[Canada]]), [[Rotting Christ]] (from [[Greece]]) and [[Samael (band)|Samael]] (from Switzerland). [[Fenriz]] of the Norwegian band [[Darkthrone]] called Master's Hammer's debut album ''[[Ritual (Master's Hammer album)|Ritual]]'' &quot;the first Norwegian black metal album, even though they are from Czechoslovakia&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fenriz]]: [http://www.myspace.com/officialdarkthrone/blog/519327311 ''Darkthrone Biography and Video Clips'']. 21 November 2009, accessed on 24 September 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Northern European countries, bands began to refer to these bands or the older ones from the first wave. In [[Sweden]] this included [[Marduk (band)|Marduk]], [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]], [[Nifelheim]] and [[Abruptum]]. In [[Finland]], there emerged a scene that mixed first wave black metal influences with elements of death metal and [[grindcore]]; this included [[Beherit (band)|Beherit]], [[Archgoat]] and [[Impaled Nazarene]]. Bands such as [[Demoncy]] and [[Profanatica]] emerged during this time in the United States, when death metal was more popular among extreme metal fans. The Norwegian band [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]]'s concert at the Eiskeller in Leipzig with [[Eminenz]] and [[Manos (band)|Manos]] in 1990, later released as ''[[Live in Leipzig]]'', was said to have had a strong influence on the Eastern German scene&lt;ref name=koenige&gt;Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann: ''Die Könige vom Westwall''. ''Die legendären Protagonisten von damals im exklusiven Interview''. In: ''Rock Hard'', no. 269, October 2009, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; and is even called the unofficial beginning of German black metal.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf-Rüdiger Mühlmann: ''Deutschland, deine Schwarzmetall-Bands''. In: ''Rock Hard'', no. 269, October 2009, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second wave ===
{{Main|Early Norwegian black metal scene}}

The second wave of black metal began in the early 1990s and was spearheaded by the Norwegian black metal scene. During 1990–1994 a number of Norwegian artists began performing and releasing a new kind of black metal music; this included [[Mayhem (band)|Mayhem]], [[Thorns (band)|Thorns]], [[Burzum]], [[Darkthrone]], [[Immortal (band)|Immortal]], [[Satyricon (band)|Satyricon]], [[Enslaved (band)|Enslaved]], [[Emperor (band)|Emperor]], [[Dimmu Borgir]], [[Gorgoroth]], [[Ulver]] and [[Carpathian Forest]]. They developed the style of their 1980s forebears as a distinct and separate genre. This was partly thanks to a new kind of guitar playing developed by Snorre &quot;Blackthorn&quot; Ruch of Stigma Diabolicum/Thorns and [[Euronymous|Øystein &quot;Euronymous&quot; Aarseth]] of Mayhem.&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; [[Fenriz]] of Darkthrone has credited them with this innovation in a number of interviews. He described it as being &quot;derived from Bathory&quot;&lt;ref name=untilthelight&gt;{{cite video |year=2009 |title=[[Until the Light Takes Us]] |medium=motion picture |publisher=Variance Films}}&lt;/ref&gt; and noted that &quot;those kinds of riffs became the new order for a lot of bands in the '90s&quot;.&lt;ref name=revolver&gt;Kory Grow: [http://www.revolvermag.com/uncategorized/web-exclusive-interview-darkthrones-fenriz-part-2-his-thoughts-on-transilva.html ''WEB-EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: DARKTHRONE'S FENRIZ, PART 2! HIS THOUGHTS ON 'TRANSILVANIAN HUNGER' AND HIP''].&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of these Norwegian bands would be responsible for a spate of crimes and controversy, including church burnings and murder (see below). Within this scene, an aggressive anti-Christian mindset became a must for any artists to be finalized as &quot;black metal&quot;. [[Ihsahn]] of Emperor believes that this trend may have developed simply from &quot;an opposition to society, a confrontation to all the normal stuff&quot;.&lt;ref name=ihsahn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/emperorblackmetal/ihsahn_interview.htm |title=Ihsahn Interview |work=geocities.com/emperorblackmetal |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080105154202/http://www.geocities.com/emperorblackmetal/ihsahn_interview.htm |archivedate=5 January 2008 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visually, the dark themes of their music was complemented with [[corpsepaint]], which became a way for many black metal artists to distinguish themselves from other metal bands of the era.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt;

==== Helvete and Deathlike Silence ====

[[File:Black metal - graffity in euronymous' basement.jpg|thumb|The basement of Helvete, showing graffiti from the early 1990s]]

During May–June 1991,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=66}} Euronymous of Mayhem opened an independent record shop named ''Helvete'' ([[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] for '[[hell]]') in [[Oslo]]. Musicians from Mayhem, Burzum, Emperor and Thorns often met there, and it became the foremost outlet for black metal records.&lt;ref name=&quot;Satan rir media&quot;/&gt; In its basement, Euronymous founded an [[independent record label]] named [[Deathlike Silence Productions]]. With the rising popularity of his band and others like it, the underground success of Euronymous's label is often credited for encouraging other record labels, who had previously shunned black metal acts, to then reconsider and release their material.

==== Dead's suicide ====

On 8 April 1991, Mayhem vocalist [[Per &quot;Dead&quot; Ohlin|Per Yngve 'Dead' Ohlin]] committed [[suicide]] while alone in a house shared by the band.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime&gt;{{cite video |year=2007 |title=Once Upon a Time in Norway |medium=motion picture |publisher=Another World Entertainment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=purefucking&gt;{{cite video |year=2008 |title=Pure Fucking Mayhem |medium=motion picture |publisher=Index Verlag}}&lt;/ref&gt; While fellow musicians often described Dead as odd and introverted off-stage, his on-stage persona was very different. He went to great lengths to make himself look like a corpse and would cut his arms while singing.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;&lt;ref name=basik&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-june1998.htm |title=Interview with Hellhammer conducted by Dmitry Basik June 1998 |last=Basik |first=Dmitri |date=June 1998 |work=thetruemayhem.com |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070823184104/http://www.thetruemayhem.com/interviews/previous/hh-june1998.htm |archivedate=23 August 2007 |accessdate=7 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was found with slit wrists and a [[shotgun]] wound to the head, by Mayhem guitarist [[Euronymous|Øystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth]].

==== Church burnings ====

[[Image:Bergen, Fantoft2.jpg|thumb|left|225px|The Fantoft stave church. &lt;!-- Please add a picture of one of the churches burning, if possible --&gt;]]

Musicians and fans of the [[Early Norwegian black metal scene|Norwegian black metal scene]] took part in over 50 [[arsons]] of Christian churches in Norway from 1992 to 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;Satan rir media&quot;/&gt; Some of the buildings were hundreds of years old and seen as important historical landmarks. One of the first and most notable was Norway's [[Fantoft stave church]], which police believed was burnt by [[Varg Vikernes]] of the one-man band Burzum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Satan rir media&quot;/&gt; The cover of Burzum's EP ''[[Aske (album)|Aske]]'' (Norwegian for 'ashes') is a photograph of the Fantoft stave church after the arson. In May 1994, he was found guilty for the burnings of Holmenkollen Chapel, Skjold Church and Åsane Church.&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt;{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=89}} To coincide with the release of Mayhem's ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'', Vikernes and Euronymous had also allegedly plotted to blow up [[Nidaros Cathedral]], which appears on the album cover. Euronymous's murder in August 1993 (see below) put an end to this plan and stalled the album's release.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; The musicians [[Samoth]],{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=100}} [[Faust (musician)|Faust]]{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=94f}} (both of Emperor) and [[Jørn Inge Tunsberg]] (of [[Hades Almighty]])&lt;ref name=&quot;Satan rir media&quot;/&gt; were also convicted for church arsons.

Today, opinions on the church burnings differ within the black metal community. Guitarist [[Infernus]] and former vocalist [[Gaahl]] of the band Gorgoroth have praised the church burnings in interviews, with the latter saying &quot;there should have been more of them, and there will be more of them&quot;.&lt;ref name=sam/&gt; However, [[Necrobutcher]] and [[Kjetil Manheim]] of Mayhem have condemned the church burnings, with the latter claiming &quot;It was just people trying to gain acceptance within a strict group [the black metal scene] ... they wanted some sort of approval and status&quot;.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; [[Watain]] vocalist Erik Danielsson said that he respected these acts &quot;as acts of their own will&quot; but &quot;the only Christianity they defeated was the last piece of Christianity within themselves. Which is a very good beginning, of course&quot;, and that the acts did not reach further than the inspiration they gave to others.&lt;ref name=blackmetalsatanica&gt;''Black Metal Satanica'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Euronymous's murder ====

On 10 August 1993, [[Varg Vikernes]] of Burzum murdered Mayhem guitarist [[Euronymous|Øystein 'Euronymous' Aarseth]]. That night, Vikernes and Snorre 'Blackthorn' Ruch (of [[Thorns (band)|Thorns]]) traveled from [[Bergen]] to Euronymous's apartment in [[Oslo]]. Vikernes fatally stabbed Euronymous. His body was found outside the apartment with 23 cut wounds – two to the head, five to the neck and 16 to the back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steinke |first=Darcey |title=Satan's Cheerleaders |magazine=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]] |date=February 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been speculated that the murder was the result of either a power struggle, a financial dispute over Burzum records or an attempt at &quot;outdoing&quot; a stabbing in Lillehammer the year before by another black metal musician, [[Faust (musician)|Bård 'Faust' Eithun]].&lt;ref name=ukcrlz&gt;{{cite web |last=Huey |first=Steve |url=http://music.yahoo.com/ar-257375-bio |title=Mayhem Mayhem Biography on Yahoo! Music |work=yahoo.com |date=10 August 1993 |accessdate=24 March 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes claims that Aarseth had plotted to torture him to death and videotape the event – using a meeting about an unsigned [[contract]] as a pretext.&lt;ref name=nuokon&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story02.shtml |title=A Burzum Story: Part II - Euronymous |last=Vikernes |first=Varg |authorlink=Varg Vikernes |work=burzum.org |date=December 2004 |accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of the murder, Vikernes claims he intended to hand Euronymous the signed contract and &quot;tell him to fuck off&quot;, but that Euronymous attacked him first.&lt;ref name=nuokon/&gt; Vikernes also said that most of Euronymous's cut wounds were caused by broken glass he had fallen on during the struggle.&lt;ref name=nuokon/&gt; This version is doubted by Faust and other members of the scene.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=118}}

Whatever the circumstances, Vikernes was arrested within days, and in May 1994 was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder and for four church arsons. Vikernes smiled when his verdict was read and the picture was widely reprinted in the news media.&lt;ref name=nuokon/&gt; That month saw the release of Mayhem's album ''[[De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas]]'', which featured Euronymous on guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Before the release, Euronymous's family had asked Mayhem's drummer, Hellhammer, to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said: &quot;I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was re-recording the bass parts, but I never did&quot;.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; In 2003, Vikernes failed to return to [[Tønsberg]] prison after being given a short leave. He was re-arrested shortly after while driving a stolen car with various weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Berglund |first=Nina |date=27 October 2003 |title=Police Nab 'The Count' After He Fled Jail |newspaper=[[Aftenposten]] |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article655724.ece |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070308164838/http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article655724.ece |archivedate=8 March 2007 |accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vikernes was released on [[parole]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Varg Vikernes ute på prøve |curly=y |url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/artikkel.php?artid=557287 |newspaper=[[Verdens Gang]] |location=[[Oslo]], [[Norway]] |agency=[[Norsk Telegrambyrå|NTB]] |date=10 March 2009 |accessdate=5 September 2012 |language=[[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.vg.no%2Fnyheter%2Finnenriks%2Fartikkel.php%3Fartid%3D557287&amp;date=2009-03-10 |archivedate=10 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ute av fengsel |url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/05/22/nyheter/black_metal/varg_vikernes/6354526/ |work=dagbladet.no |date=22 May 2009 |accessdate=23 May 2009 |language=[[Norwegian language|Norwegian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Conflict between scenes ====

There was said to have been a strong rivalry between [[Early Norwegian black metal scene|Norwegian black metal]] and [[Swedish death metal]] scenes. [[Fenriz]] and [[Tchort]] have noted that Norwegian black metal musicians had become &quot;fed up with the whole death metal scene&quot;&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt; and that &quot;death metal was very uncool in Oslo&quot; at the time.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; A number of times, Euronymous sent [[death threat]]s to some of the more mainstream death metal groups in Europe.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt; Allegedly, a group of Norwegian black metal fans even plotted to kidnap and murder certain Swedish death metal musicians.&lt;ref name=onceuponatime/&gt;

There was a brief feud between Norwegian and Finnish scenes during 1992 and 1993.&lt;ref name=feud1995&gt;{{cite journal | title=The End of a Legend? Isten Smokes Holocaust Vengeance out of Beherit |journal=Isten |volume=6 |year=1995 |pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feud was partly motivated by seemingly harmless pranks; for example, Nuclear Holocausto of the Finnish band [[Beherit (band)|Beherit]] made [[prank call]]s in the middle of the night to [[Samoth]] of Emperor (in Norway) and [[Mika Luttinen]] of Impaled Nazarene (in Finland). The calls consisted of senseless babbling and playing of [[children's music|children's songs]],&lt;ref name=feud1995/&gt; although Luttinen believed them to be death threats from Norwegian bands.&lt;ref name=feud1995/&gt; Impaled Nazarene's first album ''Tol Cormpt Norz Norz Norz'' has &quot;No orders from Norway accepted&quot; and &quot;Kuolema Norjan kusipäille!&quot; (&quot;Death to the assholes of Norway!&quot;) printed on the back cover. The Finnish band Black Crucifixion criticized [[Darkthrone]] as &quot;trendies&quot; due to Darkthrone originally being a death metal band.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Oath of the Goat's Black Blood |journal=Sinister Flame |volume=1 |year=2003 |pages=28–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The second wave outside Norway ====

Black metal scenes also emerged on the European mainland during the early 1990s, inspired by the Norwegian scene or the older bands, or both. In [[Poland]], a scene was spearheaded by [[Graveland]] and [[Behemoth (band)|Behemoth]]. In [[France]], a close-knit group of musicians known as [[Les Légions Noires]] emerged; this included artists such as [[Mütiilation]], [[Vlad Tepes (band)|Vlad Tepes]], Belketre and Torgeist. Bands such as [[Black Funeral]], [[Grand Belial's Key]] and [[Judas Iscariot (band)|Judas Iscariot]] emerged during this time in the United States.

A notable black metal group in [[England]] at the time was [[Cradle of Filth]], who released three demos in a black/death metal style with symphonic flourishes, followed by [[The Principle of Evil Made Flesh|a studio album]], which featured a then-unusual hybrid style of black and [[gothic metal]]. The band then abandoned black metal for gothic metal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baddeley |first1=Gavin |last2=Filth |first2=Dani |authorlink2=Dani Filth |title=[[The Gospel of Filth]] |date=March 2010 |pages=48–50 |publisher=FAB Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming one of the most successful extreme metal bands to date. John Serba of [[AllMusic]] commented that their first album &quot;made waves in the early black metal scene, putting Cradle of Filth on the tips of metalheads' tongues, whether in praise of the band's brazen attempts to break the black metal mold or in derision for its 'commercialization' of an underground phenomenon that was proud of its grimy heritage [...]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/the-principle-of-evil-made-flesh-mw0000025519 |title=The Principle of Evil Made Flesh - Cradle of Filth |last=Serba |first=John |work=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another English band called Necropolis never released any music, but &quot;began a desecratory assault against churches and cemeteries in their area&quot; and &quot;almost caused Black Metal to be banned in Britain as a result&quot;.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=278-280}}

The controversy surrounding [[Absurd (band)|Absurd]] drew attention to the [[Germany|German]] black metal scene. In 1993, the members murdered a boy from their school, Sandro Beyer.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=245-248}} A photo of Beyer's gravestone is on the cover of one of their demos,&lt;ref&gt;[[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke]]: ''Black Sun: Aryan Cults, Esoteric Nazism, and the Politics of Identity''. NYU Press, 2003. p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thuringian Pagan Madness'', along with pro-Nazi statements. It was recorded in prison and released in Poland by Graveland drummer Capricornus.&lt;ref&gt;Absurd: ''Thuringian Pagan Madness'', Capricornus Prod. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The band's early music, however, was more influenced by [[Oi!]] and [[Rock Against Communism]] (RAC) than by black metal,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=250f}} and described as being &quot;more akin to '60s garage punk than some of the […] Black Metal of their contemporaries&quot;.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=260f}} Alexander von Meilenwald from the German band [[Nagelfar]] considers [[Ungod (band)|Ungod]]'s 1993 debut album ''Circle of the Seven Infernal Pacts'', [[Desaster]]'s 1994 demo ''Lost in the Ages'', [[Tha-Norr]]'s 1995 album ''Wolfenzeitalter'' (which he called an &quot;fantastic, extremely atmospheric underground jewel&quot; by one of the most underrated German bands&lt;ref name=koenige/&gt;), [[Lunar Aurora]]'s 1996 debut ''Weltengänger'' and [[Katharsis (band)|Katharsis]]'s 2000 debut ''666'' (whose second album ''Kruzifixxion'' he called &quot;by far the best traditional black metal album from Germany&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alexander von Meilenwald: ''5 Klassiker''. In: ''Rock Hard'', no. 269, October 2009, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;) to be the most important recordings for the German scene.&lt;ref name=koenige/&gt; He said they were &quot;not necessarily the best German releases, but they all kicked off something&quot;.&lt;ref name=koenige/&gt;

=== After the second wave ===

In the beginning of the second wave, the different scenes developed their own styles; as [[Alan Averill|Alan 'A. A. Nemtheanga' Averill]] says, &quot;you had the Greek sound and the Finnish sound, and the Norwegian sound, and there was German bands and Swiss bands and that kind of thing&quot;.&lt;ref name=billzebub/&gt; By the mid 1990s, the style of the Norwegian scene was being adopted by bands worldwide, and in 1998, ''[[Kerrang!]]'' journalist [[Malcolm Dome]] said that &quot;black metal as we know it in 1998 owes more to Norway and to Scandinavia than any other particular country&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Satan rir media&quot;&gt;{{cite video |title=[[Satan rir media|Satan Rides the Media]] |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer black metal bands also began raising their production quality and introducing additional instruments such as [[synthesizer]]s and even full-symphony [[orchestra]]s.

By the late 1990s, the underground deemed many of the Norwegian pioneers, like Emperor,&lt;ref name=upagainstthewall&gt;Tornado: ''Up Against the Wall Motherfucker!!!!.

After Euronymous's death, &quot;[s]ome bands went more towards the Viking metal and epic style, while some bands went deeper into the abyss&quot;.&lt;ref name=blackmetalsatanica/&gt; In 1995, [[Jon Nödtveidt]] of [[Dissection (band)|Dissection]] joined the Misanthropic Luciferian Order (MLO).&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Biagi: [http://web.archive.org/web/20031005065926/http://www.dissection.nu/biography.htm ''Biography Part One''.

It was said he was killed &quot;out of anger&quot; because he had &quot;harassed&quot; the two men. Nödtveidt received a 10 year sentence.&lt;ref&gt;Andrea Biagi: [http://web.archive.org/web/20040216045715/http://www.dissection.nu/killing.htm ''THE KILLING''], accessed on 25 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; As the victim was a homosexual immigrant, Dissection was accused of being a Nazi band,&lt;ref name=fearthereturn&gt;''Dissection''.

[[File:Watain3.jpg|thumb|Watain singer Erik Danielsson in torn clothes and covered with blood]]
According to Erik Danielsson, when his band Watain formed in 1998 there were very few bands who took black metal as seriously as the early Norwegian scene had.&lt;ref name=blackmetalsatanica/&gt; A newer generation of Swedish Satanic bands like Watain and [[Ondskapt]], supposedly inspired by [[Ofermod]],&lt;ref&gt;Nathan T.

A part of the underground scene adopted a [[Carl Jung|Jungian]] interpretation of the church burnings and other acts of the early scene as the re-emergence of ancient archetypes, which Kadmon of [[Allerseelen]] and the authors of ''[[Lords of Chaos (book)|Lords of Chaos]]'' had implied in their writings,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=176f}}&lt;ref name=paganfront&gt;[[Hendrik Möbus]]: [http://web.archive.org/web/20071214012732/http://www.thepaganfront.com/pf.php?show=articles&amp;article=1 ''National Socialist Black Metal''].&lt;/ref&gt; and mixed this interpretation with Paganism and an interest in Nationalism.&lt;ref name=paganfront/&gt; Varg Vikernes was seen as &quot;an ideological messiah&quot; by some,&lt;ref name=decibelnsbm&gt;J.

Since the 2000s, a number of anti-[[Islam|Islamic]] black metal bands —composed of musicians from Muslim backgrounds— have emerged in the [[Middle East]]. Janaza is believed to be [[Iraq]]'s first female black metal artist and released the demo ''Burning Quran Ceremony'' in 2010. Its frontwoman, Anahita, said that her parents and brother were killed by a [[suicide bomb]] during the [[Iraq War]]. Another Iraqi band, Seeds of Iblis, released their debut EP ''Jihad Against Islam'' in 2011 through French label Legion of Death. These bands, along with Tadnees (from [[Saudi Arabia]]), False Allah (from [[Bahrain]]) and Mosque of Satan (from [[Lebanon]]), style themselves as the &quot;Arabic Anti-Islamic Legion&quot;. Another Lebanese band, Ayat, drew much attention with their debut album ''Six Years of Dormant Hatred'', released through North American label Moribund Records in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Kim.

== Stylistic divisions ==

Regarding the sound of black metal, there are two conflicting groups within the genre: &quot;those that stay true to the genre's roots, and those that introduce progressive elements&quot;.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; The former believe that the music should always be [[Minimalism|minimalist]] – performed only with the standard guitar-bass-drums setup and recorded in a [[low fidelity]] style. One supporter of this train of thought is [[Blake Judd]] of [[Nachtmystium]], who has rejected labeling his band black metal for its departure from the genre's typical sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=208961 |title=Daily Herald &amp;#124; Nachtmystium shines black light on black metal |last=Pizek |first=Jeff |date=20 June 2008 |work=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|dailyherald.com]] |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snorre Ruch of [[Thorns (band)|Thorns]], on the other hand, has said that modern black metal is &quot;too narrow&quot; and believes that this was &quot;not the idea at the beginning&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.voicesfromthedarkside.de/interviews/thorns.htm |title=Thorns |work=voicesfromthedarkside.de |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Horner of the American band Throne of Malediction says that &quot;black/extreme metal takes something that can be called 'fashion' and makes it true 'art' [...] It is a genre where beautiful piano compositions can sit next to screeching banshee vocals and raw guitars.

Since the 1990s, different styles of black metal have emerged and some have melded Norwegian-style black metal with other genres.

* '''[[Symphonic black metal]]''' is a style of black metal that incorporates [[Symphony|symphonic]] and [[orchestra]]l elements. This may include the usage of instruments found in symphony orchestras (piano, violin, [[cello]], flute and keyboards), &quot;clean&quot; or operatic vocals and guitars with less distortion.&lt;!--Please do not add bands, as there is a list in the main article--&gt;

* '''[[Viking metal]]''' melds the Nordic black metal style&lt;!-- Do not change this! Bands like Enslaved were influenced by Nordic bands, not Greek ones. --&gt; with [[Nordic music|Nordic folk music]] and focuses on [[Viking]] themes. Viking metal often has a harsh black metal sound, which may be &quot;augmented by sorrowful [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] melodies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/style/scandinavian-metal-ma0000012324 |title=Scandinavian Metal : Significant Albums, Artists and Songs, Most Viewed : AllMusic |work=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vocals are typically a mixture of high-pitched shrieks and &quot;clean&quot; [[choir|choral]] singing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/requiem-mw0000174989 |title=Requiem - Bathory |last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |work=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of Viking metal can be traced to the albums ''[[Blood Fire Death]]'' (1988) and ''[[Hammerheart]]'' (1990) by Swedish band [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bathory-mn0000151787 |title=Bathory |last=Rivadavia |first=Eduardo |work=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Pagan metal]]''' is a term for metal bands whose lyrics and imagery focus on paganism. The Norwegian band [[In the Woods...]] was one of the first bands commonly viewed as pagan metal.&lt;ref name=halupczok/&gt; In the mid 1990s, [[Ireland|Irish]] bands such as [[Cruachan (band)|Cruachan]]&lt;ref name=bolther&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rock-impressions.com/cruachan_inter1e.htm |title=Rock Impressions - Interviews - Cruachan |last=Bolther |first=Giancarlo |work=rock-impressions.com |accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Primordial (band)|Primordial]]&lt;ref name=halupczok/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/primordial-mn0000854587 |title=Primordial |last=Monger |first=James Christopher |work=[[AllMusic]] |accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; began to combine black metal with [[folk music of Ireland|Irish folk music]].

== Ideology ==

[[File:Taake Hellfest 2009 8 NB.jpg|thumb|left|175px|[[Taake]] vocalist Høst – the inverted Christian cross is often used by black metallers to signify their opposition to Christianity.]]

Bands that were part of the 'first wave' had 'Satanic' imagery and lyrics, although most of them were not Satanists.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=15f}} However, for the early 'second wave' bands in Norway, Satanism as an ideology defined black metal.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27f}}{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=7f}} Another part of the scene adopted Paganism, &quot;often coupled with nationalism&quot;,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=313}} although the early Pagan bands did not call themselves 'black metal'.&lt;ref name=halupczok/&gt;&lt;ref name=enslavedfrost/&gt;&lt;ref name=nordicmetal/&gt; Bands associating themselves with black metal are generally [[anti-Christian sentiment|opposed to Christianity]]&lt;ref name=sam/&gt; and the other major religions. Arguably, this is the only shared belief among those calling their music black metal. Artists who oppose Christianity tend to promote [[atheism]], [[antitheism]], paganism or Satanism.&lt;ref name=sam/&gt; Many artists also write lyrics that appear to be [[Nihilism|nihilistic]] and [[Misanthropy|misanthropic]],&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; although it is debatable whether this represents their mindset.

An article in the [[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]] webzine noted that &quot;An overriding feature of almost all black metal is the fascination with the past&quot;.&lt;ref name=chonicles&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chroniclesofchaos.com/articles/rants/6-668_black_metal_a_brief_guide.aspx |title=CoC : Rant : Black Metal: A Brief Guide |last=Kalis |first=Quentin |date=31 August 2004 |work=[[Chronicles of Chaos (webzine)|Chronicles of Chaos]] |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding this, Aaron Weaver from [[Wolves in the Throne Room]] said in an interview: &quot;I think that black metal is an artistic movement that is critiquing modernity on a fundamental level, saying that the modern world view is missing something&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brooklynvegan.com/archives/2009/05/an_interview_w_13.html |title=An Interview w/ Wolves in the Throne Room's Aaron Weaver |date=22 May 2009 |work=brooklynvegan.com |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this, some black metal artists have written about or focused on the ancient pre-Christian cultures of their homelands. The documentarist [[Sam Dunn]] noted of the Norwegian scene that &quot;unlike any other heavy metal scene, the culture and the place is incorporated into the music and imagery&quot;.&lt;ref name=sam/&gt; In a Norwegian documentary, [[Fenriz]] stated that &quot;black metal is individualism above all&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |title=Norsk Black Metal |year=2003 |publisher=[[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and artists tend to be supportive of [[individualism]],&lt;ref name=sam/&gt; although followers of Euronymous tended towards support of anti-individualism.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27f}} According to Benjamin Hedge Olson's master thesis, &quot;Black Metal is characterized by a conflict between radical individualism and group identity and by an attempt to accept both polarities simultaneously&quot;.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=2}}

Benjamin Hedge Olson writes that some artists hold a belief similar to [[Transcendentalism|transcendentalists]]. This belief typically means that someone is trying to leave the physical form of his or her body, and in doing so, find higher knowledge or a better understanding of the world. Usually, this means that the individual has received information from a higher being. These black metallers &quot;try to reconcile notions of self and other by dissolving their singular identity with the divine&quot; by &quot;transcending the physical self, and making contact with the divine&quot;.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=4}} They are dissatisfied with &quot;a contemporary world that they feel is devoid of spiritual and cultural significance&quot;,{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=129}} want to rise above it and challenge &quot;this secularism with religious fanaticism&quot;.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=38}} Olson defines black metal concerts as &quot;musical rituals designed to achieve both scenic solidarity and mystical transcendence&quot;{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=47}} and considers the &quot;[a]cknowledgment that the performers, through ritual performance, have transcended their mundane, physical forms and taken on a spiritual persona associated with the deity&quot; as a typical step of black metal concerts he attended.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=41}}

Some prominent musicians within the scene hold that black metal does not need to represent any particular ideology. For example, [[Jan Axel Blomberg]] (Hellhammer) said in an interview with ''Metal Library'' that &quot;In my opinion, black metal today is just music&quot;.&lt;ref name=hellhammerinterview&gt;{{cite web |url=http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=fi&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.metallibrary.ru%2Farticles%2Finterviews%2F96.html |title=Article: Interview |date=7 January 2007 |work=metallibrary.ru |publisher=Open Publishing |language=Russian (Google-translated to English) |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Sigurd Wongraven]] has said that black metal &quot;doesn't necessarily have to be all Satanic, as long as it's dark&quot;.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; Eric Horner commented: &quot;Though many bands base it on Satanic belief, I disagree that it is the only way to be 'black metal'. Black metal to me is pure emotion and individuality with a real vibe to it&quot;.&lt;ref name=throneofmalediction/&gt; However, an article in Metalion's ''Slayer'' fanzine attacked musicians that &quot;care more about their guitars than the actual essence onto which the whole concept was and is based upon&quot;, and insisted that &quot;the music itself doesn't come as the first priority&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kristiansen |first=Jon |year=2011 |title=Worship Him! |journal=Metalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries |location=[[Brooklyn]], New York |publisher=Bazillion Points Books |page=467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Satanism ===

[[File:Pentagram4.svg|thumb|150px|right|The downward-pointing [[pentagram]] is commonly used by bands in the genre.]]

Black metal was originally a term for extreme metal bands with Satanic lyrics and imagery, although most of the 'first wave' bands were not Satanists and merely used it to provoke; one of the few exceptions was [[Mercyful Fate]] singer and [[Church of Satan]] member [[King Diamond]], whom [[Michael Moynihan (journalist)|Michael Moynihan]] calls &quot;one of the only performers of the '80s Satanic metal who was more than just a [[poseur]] using a devilish image for [[shock value]]&quot;.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=15f}}

Mayhem guitarist Euronymous was central in establishing an ideology for the Norwegian black metal scene.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27f}} He and his followers shunned [[Anton LaVey]]'s Church of Satan, instead promoting a &quot;hard-line, misanthropic devil worship&quot;.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=7f}} Benjamin Hedge Olson wrote that they &quot;transform[ed] Venom's quasi-Satanic stage theatrics into a form of cultural expression unique from other forms of metal or Satanism&quot; and &quot;abandoned the mundane identities and ambitions of other forms of metal in favor of religious and ideological fanaticism&quot;.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=27f}} The [[Theistic Satanism]] espoused by Euronymous was an inversion of Christianity. He described himself as &quot;religious&quot; and said that his Satanism &quot;comes from religious Christianity, and there it shall stay&quot;.&lt;ref name=killyourself/&gt; He also professed to be in favor of [[totalitarianism]] and against individualism, compassion, peace, happiness and fun. However, some who knew Euronymous&lt;ref&gt;Fridh, Sanna. [http://www.academia.edu/239378/Satan_The_Perfect_Man ''Satan: The Perfect Man: A Symbol and Gender Analysis of Satanism in Black Metal'']. University of Gothenburg, 2010. p.6&lt;/ref&gt;—such as [[Kjetil Manheim]],&lt;ref name=purefucking/&gt; and Vikernes&lt;ref name=untilthelight/&gt;—have claimed that this was merely an image. Faust said that with Euronymous, &quot;there was a lot of smoke but not so much fire&quot;,&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; but whereas Vikernes repeatedly tried to discredit Euronymous and claimed the latter had nothing to do with any of the crimes,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=119f}} Faust mentions that Euronymous participated in the [[Holmenkollen Chapel]] arson,{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=94f}} though he believes that Euronymous &quot;felt he had to prove that he could be a part of it and not just in the background&quot;.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; [[Mortiis]], however, said that Euronymous &quot;was such a devil worshipper you wouldn't believe it&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Ian Christe: ''Sound of the Beast: the Complete Headbanging History of Heavy Metal''. New York, NY: Harper Collins, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; and Metalion, who knew Euronymous since 1985{{sfn|Kristiansen|2011|p=39}} and considered him to be his best friend,{{sfn|Kristiansen|2011|p=266-269}} said that Euronymous &quot;was always telling what he thought [...] worshipping death and being extreme&quot;.{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=39}} Tenebris&lt;!--Allegedly Jon Nödtveidt, who knew Euronymous in person like the others.--&gt; from the [[Misanthropic Luciferian Order]], a Swedish Satanic order formed in 1995, wrote that &quot;[b]ack then, in 1991, things&lt;!--Do we know what 'things' he's talking about here?--&gt; mainly concerned black metal and ideological Satanism […] and kind of stood and fell with Euronymous and his shop.

=== Unblack metal ===
{{Main|Unblack metal}}

Unblack metal, or Christian black metal, is a term used to describe music that sounds musically similar to black metal but where the artists, lyrics and imagery promote [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=kapelovitz&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kapelovitz |first=Dan |year=2001 |month=February |title=Heavy Metal Jesus Freaks - Headbanging for Christ |journal=Mean Magazine |url=http://www.kapelovitz.com/christianmetal.htm |accessdate=6 September 2007 |quote=And where secular black metal thrived, so did its Christian counterpart, unblack metal, with names like [[Satanicide]], Neversatan, and Satan's Doom. |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian band [[Horde (band)|Horde]]'s debut album ''[[Hellig Usvart]]'', released through [[Nuclear Blast Records]], is often credited as being the first Christian black metal album, although the sole member, known as Anonymous, has stated that &quot;there were similar [unblack] bands prior to Horde, even in Norway&quot;, referring to such bands as [[Antestor]], who formed in 1990, although prior to 1993 they were a [[death/doom]] band bearing a different name, Crush Evil. ''Hellig Usvart'' caused great controversy in the black metal scene, and death threats were sent to Nuclear Blast Records headquarters demanding them to release the members' names. The name of Anonymous was later revealed as [[Jayson Sherlock]], a drummer for the bands [[Mortification (band)|Mortification]] and [[Paramaecium]].

Many in the black metal scene see &quot;Christian black metal&quot; as an oxymoron.&lt;ref name=ultimatemetal/&gt; On the British black metal documentary ''[[Murder Music: A History of Black Metal]]'' (2007), all interviewed musicians stated, when asked about the matter, that black metal cannot be Christian.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; The term &quot;Christian black metal&quot; drew mocking replies from black metal musicians, for example [[Martin Walkyier]] of the English metal band [[Sabbat (band)|Sabbat]] commented: &quot;'Christian black metal?' What do they do? Do they build churches? Do they repair them? ''(laughs)''&quot;.&lt;ref name=murdermusic/&gt; In fact, the early unblack metal groups Horde and Antestor refused to call their music &quot;black metal&quot; because they felt that the style was strongly associated with Satanism. Horde called its music &quot;holy unblack metal&quot;,&lt;ref name=Erasmus&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unblack.d135-1r43.de/hordeint/hordeinterview.html |title=Horde Interview |accessdate=9 December 2007 |author=Erasmus |year=2006 |publisher=Unblack.de |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071023175915/http://unblack.d135-1r43.de/hordeint/hordeinterview.html |archivedate=23 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Antestor preferred to call their music &quot;sorrow metal&quot; instead.&lt;ref name=Morrow&gt;{{cite web |author=Morrow, Matt |title=Antestor - The Return of the Black Death |publisher=Open Publishing |year=2001 |work=The Whipping Post |url=http://thewhippingpost.tripod.com/antestorthereturnoftheblackdeath/ |accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many current unblack metal bands, such as [[Crimson Moonlight]], feel that black metal has now changed from an ideological movement to a purely musical genre, and that is why they also call their own music black metal.&lt;ref name=ultimatemetal&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimatemetal.com/forum/interviews/195667-crimson-moonlight-their-most-brutal.html |title=Crimson Moonlight - At Their Most Brutal - Ultimate Metal Forum |last=Jordan |first=Jason |date=24 May 2005 |work=ultimatemetal.com |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== National Socialist black metal ===
{{Main|National Socialist black metal}}

National Socialist black metal (NSBM) is a term used for black metal artists who promote [[Nazism|National Socialist (Nazi)]] beliefs through their music and imagery. NSBM is not regarded as a distinct subgenre, as there is no way to play black metal in a National Socialist way. Some black metal bands have made references to [[Nazi Germany]] for [[shock value]], causing them to be wrongly labeled as NSBM. Due to his writings&lt;ref name=burzum.org&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.burzum.org/eng/library/a_burzum_story07.shtml |title=A Burzum Story: Part VII - The Nazi Ghost |last=Vikernes |first=Varg |authorlink=Varg Vikernes |date=July 2005 |work=burzum.org |accessdate=4 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and outspoken far-right views, [[Varg Vikernes]] is regarded as the main inspiration for such views within the scene{{sfn|Moynihan|Søderlind|1998|p=303}}{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=103}} and therefore the NSBM movement.{{sfn|Olson|2008|p=102}} Vikernes, however, has tried to distance himself from Nazism and the NSBM scene, preferring to refer to himself as an &quot;[[Odal (rune)|odalist]]&quot; instead of a &quot;socialistic&quot;, &quot;materialistic&quot; Nazi.&lt;ref name=burzum.org/&gt;

NSBM artists are a small minority within black metal, according to Mattias Gardel&lt;ref&gt;Gardel, Mattias.
