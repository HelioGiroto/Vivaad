'''Black Entertainment Television''' ('''BET''', part of '''[[BET Networks]]''') is an American, [[Viacom]]-owned [[cable television|cable network]] based in [[Washington, D.C.]] Currently reaching more than 90 million households,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=BET Networks|publisher=Viacom|url=http://www.viacom.com/ourbrands/medianetworks/betnetworks/pages/default.aspx|accessdate=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is the most prominent television network targeting [[African American]] audiences. The network was launched on January 25, 1980, by its founder, [[Robert L. Johnson]]. Programming of the network comprises mainstream music and movies and television series. 

==History==
After stepping down as a lobbyist for the cable industry, Freeport, Illinois, native [[Robert L. Johnson]] decided to launch his own [[cable television]] network. Johnson would soon acquire a loan for $15,000, and earned a $500,000 investment from [[John Malone]] to start the network.&lt;ref name=&quot;Market Nobody Wanted&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Johnson|first=Robert|last2=Dumaine|first2=Brian|title=The Market Nobody Wanted|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fsb/fsb_archive/2002/10/01/330571/index.htm|work=Fortune Small Business|date=2002-10-01|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; BET began broadcasting on January 25, 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corporate Fact Sheet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporate Fact Sheet|url=http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=45|publisher=BET Networks|accessdate=2008-09-12|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/6AUPSeQPh |archivedate=August 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially broadcasting for two hours a week  as a block of programming on the [[Nickelodeon]] (it wouldn't be until 1983 that BET became a full fledged channel), the network lineup consisted of [[music videos]] and reruns of popular [[black sitcoms]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Market Nobody Wanted&quot;/&gt;

BET launched a news program, ''BET News'', in 1988, with [[Ed Gordon (journalist)|Ed Gordon]] as the anchor. Gordon would later host other programs and specials on BET, such as ''Black Men Speak Out: The Aftermath'', related to the [[1992 Los Angeles riots]] and a recurring interview show ''Conversations with Ed Gordon''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Anne Janette|title= Gordon, Ed 1960—|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-2871200026.html|work=Contemporary Black Biography|year=1996|accessdate=July 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the talk show ''BET Tonight'' debuted with [[Tavis Smiley]] as host; in 2001, Ed Gordon replaced Tavis Smiley. In 2002, as part of a reorganization focusing on entertainment productions, 

In 1991, the network became the first black-controlled company on the [[New York Stock Exchange]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Market Nobody Wanted&quot;/&gt; In 2003, the network was no longer a black owned business when it was bought by media conglomerate [[Viacom]] for $3 billion. In 2005, Johnson retired from the network, turning over his titles as President and Chief Executive Officer to [[Debra L. Lee]], a former Vice President.

In 2007, the network expanded into other BET-related digital cable networks: [[Centric]], [[BET Hip-Hop]], and [[BET Gospel]]. Centric (formerly BET on Jazz, BET Jazz and BET J) is a spin-off cable television channel of BET (Black Entertainment Television), created originally to showcase jazz music-related programming, especially that of black jazz musicians. It is now a general interest channel geared towards African-American adults. Centric is available in 28 million homes on DirecTV, Dish Network, Verizon FiOS, AT&amp;T U-verse, Time Warner Cable and many other digital cable providers as part of the MTV Digital Suite. The channel is additionally an associate member of the Caribbean Cable Cooperative. BET also launched a batch of original programming, including reality shows ''[[Baldwin Hills]]'' and ''[[Hell Date]]'', competition show ''[[Sunday Best]]'', and town hall-style discussion show ''Hip Hop vs. America''.&lt;ref name=&quot;confidence&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Deggans|first=Eric|title=BET diversifies with confidence|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2007/07/24/Tv/BET_diversifies_with_.shtml|accessdate=December 30, 2010|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=July 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of civil rights leader [[Coretta Scott King]] in 2006, BET broadcast its regularly scheduled music video programming rather than cover King's funeral live as [[CNN]], [[Fox News Channel]], [[MSNBC]], and BET competitors [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]] and [[Black Family Channel]] were. The BET website streamed the funeral live; BET broadcast taped, 60-second reports periodically from the funeral by senior news correspondent Andre Showell. Michael Lewellen, BET's senior vice president for corporate communications, defended the decision: &quot;We weighed a number of different options. In the end, we chose to offer a different kind of experience for BET viewers.&quot; Lewellen also said that BET received around &quot;two dozen&quot; phone calls and &quot;a handful&quot; of emails criticizing BET for not showing the King funeral live.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSK&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Shister|first=Gail|title=BET leaves pack on King funeral -- it sticks with scheduled program|url=http://findarticles.com/p/news-articles/buffalo-news/mi_8030/is_20060209/bet-leaves-pack-king-funeral/ai_n42906812/|accessdate=December 30, 2010|newspaper=The Buffalo News|date=February 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the evening of the funeral day (February 7, 2006), BET broadcast tribute special ''Coretta Scott King: Married to the Mission'' and repeated it the following Sunday, February 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=BET, BET.com Present Special Telecast, On-Line Coverage Honoring Life of Coretta Scott King|url=http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=364|publisher=BET|date=February 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Showell hosted a program featuring highlights of the funeral, ''Coretta Scott King: Celebrating Her Spirit'', that broadcast that same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://bet.mediaroom.com/index.php?s=43&amp;item=437|title=BET Celebration of Coretta Scott King Continues Sunday With Three Hours of Tributes, Special Moments|date=February 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 2007 convention, the [[National Association of Black Journalists]] gave BET its Thumbs Down Award for not broadcasting King's funeral live.&lt;ref name=&quot;thumbs down&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Juan|title='BET' Gets Thumbs Down Award From Journalists|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=12668674|work=Morning Edition|publisher=National Public Radio|accessdate=December 30, 2010|date=August 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the Reverend [[Delman Coates|Delman L.

BET announced in March 2010 that Gordon would return to the network to host &quot;a variety of news programs and specials.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bland|first=Bridget|title=Ed Gordon: Returning to BET News|url=http://www.bvnewswire.com/2010/03/08/ed-gordon-returning-to-bet-news/|work=Black Voices|publisher=AOL|accessdate=July 2, 2010|date=March 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2010 interview, BET co-founder [[Sheila Johnson]] said she herself is &quot;ashamed&quot; of what the network has become. “I don’t watch it. I suggest to my kids that they don't watch it,&quot; she said. “When we started BET, it was going to be the [[Ebony (magazine)|''Ebony'']] magazine on television. We had public affairs programming. We had news... I had a show called ''[[Teen Summit]]'', we had a large variety of programming, but the problem is that then the video revolution started up... And then something started happening, and I didn't like it at all. And I remember during those days we would sit up and watch these videos and decide which ones were going on and which ones were not. We got a lot of backlash from recording artists...and we had to start showing them. I didn’t like the way women were being portrayed in these videos.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grove|first=Lloyd|title=Sheila Johnson Slams BET|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-04-29/sheila-johnsons-fight-against-hiv-in-dc/|work=The Daily Beast|date=2010-04-29|accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
