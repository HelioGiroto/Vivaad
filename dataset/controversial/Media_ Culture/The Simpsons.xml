'''''The Simpsons''''' is an American [[animated sitcom]] created by [[Matt Groening]] for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. The series is a [[satire|satirical]] [[parody]] of a [[American middle class|middle class]] American lifestyle epitomized by [[Simpson family|its family of the same name]], which consists of [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. The show is set in the fictional town of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]] and parodies [[Culture of the United States|American culture]], [[Society of the United States|society]], television and many aspects of the [[human condition]].

The family was conceived by Groening shortly before a solicitation for a series of [[The Simpsons shorts|animated shorts]] with the producer [[James L. Brooks]]. Groening created a dysfunctional family and named the characters after members of his own family, substituting Bart for his own name. The shorts became a part of ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'' on April 19, 1987. After a three-season run, the sketch was developed into a half-hour prime time show and was an early hit for Fox, becoming the network's first series to land in the Top 30 ratings in a season (1989–1990).

Since its debut on December 17, 1989, the show has broadcast [[List of The Simpsons episodes|{{The Simpsons episode count}} episodes]]&lt;!-- The episode number is updated in the template &quot;The Simpsons episode count&quot;. Please do not update it directly in this article. --&gt; and the [[The Simpsons (season 24)|twenty-fourth season]] started airing on September 30, 2012. ''The Simpsons'' is the [[List of longest-running U.S. primetime television series|longest-running]] American sitcom, the longest-running American animated program, and in 2009 it surpassed ''[[Gunsmoke#Television version|Gunsmoke]]'' as the longest-running American primetime, scripted television series. ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', a feature-length film, was released in theaters worldwide on July 26 and July 27, 2007, and grossed over $527 million. 

''The Simpsons'' has won dozens of awards since it debuted as a series, including 27 [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, 30 [[Annie Award]]s and a [[Peabody Award]]. ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's December 31, 1999 issue named it the 20th century's best television series, and on January 14, 2000 the Simpson family was awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Homer's exclamatory catchphrase &quot;[[D'oh!]]&quot; has been adopted into the [[English language]], while ''The Simpsons'' has influenced many adult-oriented animated sitcoms.

{{Main|History of The Simpsons|The Simpsons shorts}}
When producer [[James L. Brooks]] was working on the television variety show ''[[The Tracey Ullman Show]]'', he decided that he wanted to include small animated sketches before and after the commercial breaks. Having seen one of cartoonist [[Matt Groening]]'s ''[[Life in Hell]]'' comic strips, Brooks asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts, which Groening initially intended to present as his ''Life in Hell'' series.&lt;ref name=&quot;americasfirstfamily&quot;&gt;{{cite video |year=2000 |title=The Simpsons: America's First Family |medium=television documentary  |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groening later realized that animating ''Life in Hell'' would require the rescinding of [[publication right]]s for his life's work. He therefore chose another approach while waiting in the lobby of Brooks's office for the pitch meeting, hurriedly formulating his version of a [[dysfunctional family]] that became the Simpsons.&lt;ref name=&quot;americasfirstfamily&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=inter&gt;{{cite interview|last=Groening|first=Matt|subjectlink = Matt Groening| interviewer = David Bianculli| title = Fresh Air| program = [[NPR]]| callsign = [[WHYY-FM|WHYY]]| url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1162008| city = Philadelphia| date = 2003-02-14| accessdate = 2007-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He named the characters after his own family members, substituting &quot;Bart&quot; for his own name, adapting an [[anagram]] of the word &quot;brat&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;americasfirstfamily&quot;/&gt;

The Simpson family first appeared as [[The Simpsons shorts|shorts]] in ''The Tracey Ullman Show'' on April 19, 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;goodnight&quot;&gt;Richmond, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Groening submitted only basic sketches to the animators and assumed that the figures would be cleaned up in production. However, the animators merely re-traced his drawings, which led to the crude appearance of the characters in the initial shorts.&lt;ref name=&quot;americasfirstfamily&quot;/&gt; The animation was produced domestically at [[Klasky Csupo]],&lt;ref name=&quot;animation&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=Harvey |last=Deneroff|title=Matt Groening's Baby Turns 10|journal=Animation | volume = 14 | issue = 1|month=January | year =2000|pages=10, 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Jerry|title=The animated movie guide|publisher=[[Independent Publishers Group|Chicago Review Press]]|year=2005|page=239|isbn=978-1-55652-591-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Wes Archer]], [[David Silverman]], and [[Bill Kopp]] being animators for the first season.&lt;ref name=&quot;silverman&quot;/&gt; Colorist Gyorgyi Peluce was the person who decided to make the characters yellow.&lt;ref name=&quot;silverman&quot;/&gt;

In 1989, a team of production companies adapted ''The Simpsons'' into a half-hour series for the [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]. The team included the Klasky Csupo animation house. Brooks negotiated a provision in the contract with the Fox network that prevented Fox from interfering with the show's content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&amp;IssueNum=32|title='3rd Degree: Harry Shearer'|accessdate=2006-09-01|last=Kuipers|first=Dean|date=2004-04-15|publisher=Los Angeles: City Beat|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080308105912/http://www.lacitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/?id=568&amp;IssueNum=32 |archivedate = March 8, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groening said his goal in creating the show was to offer the audience an alternative to what he called &quot;the mainstream trash&quot; that they were watching.&lt;ref name=&quot;toonterrific&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Ken|last=Tucker|title=Toon Terrific|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=1993-03-12|page=48(3)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The half-hour series premiered on December 17, 1989 with &quot;[[Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire]]&quot;, a Christmas special.&lt;ref name=officialsite&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesimpsons.com/#/recaps/season-1_episode-1|title=Simpsons Roasting on and Open Fire|publisher=The Simpsons.com|accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Some Enchanted Evening (The Simpsons)|Some Enchanted Evening]]&quot; was the first full-length episode produced, but it did not broadcast until May 1990, as the last episode of the first season, because of animation problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt|date=2001|title=The Simpsons season 1 DVD commentary for the episode &quot;Some Enchanted Evening&quot;| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, [[Tracey Ullman]] filed a lawsuit against Fox, claiming that her show was the source of the series' success. The suit said she should receive a share of the profits of ''The Simpsons''&lt;ref name=&quot;ullman&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Frank|last=Spotnitz|title=Eat my shorts!|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|page=8(1)|date=1992-10-23|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312110,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a claim rejected by the courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR101001?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|title=Ullman loses 'Simpsons' suit|agency=Associated Press|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|accessdate=2011-08-24|date=1992-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Matt Groening and James L. Brooks have served as [[executive producer]]s during the show's entire history, and also function as creative consultants. [[Sam Simon]], described by former ''Simpsons'' director [[Brad Bird]] as &quot;the unsung hero&quot; of the show,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ortved|Ortved]], p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; served as creative supervisor for the first four seasons. He was constantly at odds with Groening, Brooks and Gracie Films and left in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;O146&quot;&gt;[[#Ortved|Ortved]], pp. 146–149.&lt;/ref&gt; Before leaving, he negotiated a deal that sees him receive a share of the profits every year, and an executive producer credit despite not having worked on the show since 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;O146&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author = Dan Snierson | title = D'Oh! | work = [[Entertainment Weekly]] | url = http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20035285_20035331_20046980,00.html | accessdate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A more involved position on the show is the [[showrunner]], who acts as head writer and manages the show's production for an entire season.&lt;ref name=&quot;silverman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Cagle, Daryl|url=http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/interviews/silverman.asp|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080607073449/http://cagle.msnbc.com/hogan/interviews/silverman.asp|archivedate=2008-06-07|title=The David Silverman Interview|accessdate=2011-06-07|publisher=[[NBCNews.com|msnbc.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
{{Main|List of The Simpsons writers}}
The first team of writers, assembled by Sam Simon, consisted of [[John Swartzwelder]], [[Jon Vitti]], [[George Meyer]], [[Jeff Martin (writer)|Jeff Martin]], [[Al Jean]], [[Mike Reiss]], [[Jay Kogen]] and [[Wallace Wolodarsky]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ortved|Ortved]], p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; Newer ''Simpsons''' writing teams typically consist of sixteen writers who propose episode ideas at the beginning of each December.&lt;ref name=&quot;scully&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Gail|last=Mitchell|title=Mike Scully|publisher=Ultimate TV|date=1999-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main writer of each episode writes the first draft. Group rewriting sessions develop final scripts by adding or removing jokes, inserting scenes, and calling for re-readings of lines by the show's vocal performers.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyer&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Owen|title=Taking Humor Seriously|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=2000-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ortved|Ortved]], p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; George Meyer, who had developed the show since the first season, was active in these sessions. According to long-time writer [[Jon Vitti]], Meyer usually invented the best lines in a given episode, even though other writers may receive script credits.&lt;ref name=&quot;meyer&quot;/&gt; Each episode takes six months to produce so the show rarely comments on current events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Geoff|last=Nixon|title=Mmmmmm... pop culture|work=[[The Silhouette]]|date=2004-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With one exception, episode credits list only the [[Voice acting|voice actor]]s, and not the characters they voice. Both Fox and the production crew wanted to keep their identities secret during the early seasons and, therefore, closed most of the recording sessions while refusing to publish photos of the recording artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt; James L.

Until 1998, the six main actors were paid [[United States dollar|$]]30,000 per episode. In 1998 they were involved in a pay dispute with Fox. The company threatened to replace them with new actors, even going as far as preparing for casting of new voices, but series creator Groening supported the actors in their action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Brian|last=Doherty|title=Matt Groening|work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|date=March/April 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was soon resolved and, from 1998 to 2004, they were paid $125,000 per episode.

Episodes will quite often feature guest voices from a wide range of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, bands, musicians and scientists. In the earlier seasons, most of the guest stars voiced characters, but eventually more started appearing as themselves.

==Characters==
{{Main|List of The Simpsons characters}}
[[File:Simpsons cast.png|thumb|right|500px|''The Simpsons'' sports a vast array of secondary and tertiary characters.]]
The Simpsons are a typical family who live in a fictional &quot;[[Middle America (United States)|Middle American]]&quot; town of Springfield.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner28&quot;&gt;Turner, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; Homer, the father, works as a safety inspector at the [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#Springfield Nuclear Power Plant|Springfield Nuclear Power Plant]], a position at odds with his careless, [[jester|buffoonish]] personality. He is married to Marge Simpson, a [[stereotype|stereotypical]] American [[Homemaking|housewife]] and mother. They have three children: Bart, a ten-year-old troublemaker; Lisa, a precocious eight-year-old activist; and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]], the baby of the family who rarely speaks, but communicates by sucking on a [[pacifier]]. The family owns a dog, [[Santa's Little Helper]], and a cat, [[Simpson family#Snowballs|Snowball V]], renamed [[Simpson family#Snowballs|Snowball II]] in &quot;[[I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title=I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot| episodelink=I, (Annoyed Grunt)-Bot| series=The Simpsons| network=Fox| airdate=2004-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both pets have had starring roles in several episodes. Despite the passing of yearly milestones such as holidays or birthdays, the Simpsons do not physically age and still appear just as they did at the end of the 1980s. Although the family is dysfunctional, many episodes examine their relationships and bonds with each other and they are often shown to care about one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Oakley, Bill|date=2005|title=The Simpsons season 7 DVD commentary for the episode &quot;Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily&quot;| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show includes an array of quirky characters: co-workers, teachers, family friends, extended relatives, townspeople and local celebrities. The creators originally intended many of these characters as one-time jokesters or for fulfilling needed functions in the town. A number of them have gained expanded roles and subsequently starred in their own episodes. According to Matt Groening, the show adopted the concept of a large supporting cast from the comedy show ''[[Second City Television|SCTV]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/matt-groening,13984/|title=Matt Groening: Interview|accessdate=2006-10-22|author=Rabin, Nathan|date=2006-04-26|publisher=The A.V.

==Themes==

''The Simpsons'' uses the standard setup of a situational comedy, or sitcom, as its premise. The series centers on a family and their life in a typical American town,&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner28&quot;/&gt; serving as a [[satire|satirical]] parody of a [[working class|working]] and [[middle class]] American lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Simpsons: Culture, Class and Popular TV|author=Flew, Terry|work=Metro|issue=97|date=1994-03-03|url=http://www.metromagazine.com.au/magazine/backisues.asp?keywords=cultu&amp;whichpage=12&amp;pagesize=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because of its animated nature, ''The Simpsons''' scope is larger than that of a regular sitcom. The town of Springfield acts as a complete universe in which characters can explore the issues faced by modern society. By having Homer work in a nuclear power plant, the show can comment on the state of the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Through Bart and Lisa's days at [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#Springfield Elementary School|Springfield Elementary School]], the show's writers illustrate pressing or controversial issues in the field of education. The town features a vast array of media channels—from kids' television programming to local news, which enables the producers to make jokes about themselves and the entertainment industry.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentators say the show is political in nature and susceptible to a left-wing bias.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, pp. 221–222&lt;/ref&gt; [[Al Jean]] admitted in an interview that &quot;We [the show] are of liberal bent.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;turner223&quot;&gt;Turner, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; The writers often evince an appreciation for [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal ideals]], but the show makes jokes across the political spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; The show portrays government and large corporations as callous entities that take advantage of the common worker.&lt;ref name=&quot;turner223&quot;/&gt; Thus, the writers often portray authority figures in an unflattering or negative light. In ''The Simpsons'', politicians are corrupt, ministers such as [[Reverend Lovejoy]] are indifferent to churchgoers, and the local police force is incompetent.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Religion also figures as a recurring theme. In times of crisis, the family often turns to God, and the show has dealt with most of the major religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mark I|last=Pinsky|title=The Gospel According to Homer|work=[[Orlando Sentinel]]|date=1999-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hallmarks==
===Opening sequence===
{{Main|The Simpsons opening sequence}}
''The Simpsons''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; [[Title sequence|opening sequence]] is one of the show's most memorable hallmarks. Most episodes open with the camera zooming through the show's title towards the town of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]]. The camera then follows the members of the family on their way home. Upon entering their house, the Simpsons settle down on their couch to watch television. The opening was created by [[David Silverman]], the first task he did when production began on the show.&lt;ref name=silverinter&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/interviews/silverman/page4.shtml|title=Top titles|accessdate=2007-08-01|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series' distinctive [[The Simpsons Theme|theme song]] was [[composer|composed]] by musician [[Danny Elfman]] in 1989, after Groening approached him requesting a retro style piece.

One of the most distinctive aspects of the opening is that three of the segments change from episode to episode: Bart writes different things on the school chalkboard,&lt;ref name=silverinter/&gt; Lisa plays different solos on her saxophone, and different gags accompany the family as they enter their living room to sit on the couch.&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; On February 15, 2009, a new opening credit sequence was introduced to accompany the switch to HDTV.

===Halloween episodes===

{{Main|Treehouse of Horror (series)}}
The special [[Halloween]] episode has become an annual tradition. &quot;[[Treehouse of Horror]]&quot; first broadcast in 1990 as part of [[The Simpsons (season 2)|season two]] and established the pattern of three separate, self-contained stories in each Halloween episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/simpsons/episodeguide/season2/page3.shtml|title=The Simpsons Halloween Special|accessdate=2007-11-09|last=Martyn|first=Adrian|last2=Wood|year=2000|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; These pieces usually involve the family in some [[Horror film|horror]], [[science fiction]], or supernatural setting and often parody or pay homage to a famous piece of work in those genres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; They always take place outside the normal continuity of the show. Although the ''Treehouse'' series is meant to be seen on Halloween, in recent years, new installments have premiered after Halloween due to [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Fox]]'s current contract with [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[World Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pick of the Day: The Simpsons Treehouse of Horror XVII|last=Ryan|first=Andrew|publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=2006-11-04|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humor===
The show's humor turns on cultural references that cover a wide spectrum of society so that viewers from all generations can enjoy the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;referential&quot;&gt;Turner pp. 63–65&lt;/ref&gt; Such references, for example, come from movies, television, music, literature, science, and history.&lt;ref name=&quot;referential&quot;/&gt; The animators also regularly add jokes or sight gags into the show's background via humorous or incongruous bits of text in signs, newspapers, and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;turner62&quot;&gt;Turner p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; The audience may often not notice the visual jokes in a single viewing. Some are so fleeting that they become apparent only by pausing a video recording of the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;turner62&quot;/&gt; Kristin Thompson argues that ''The Simpsons'' uses a &quot;...flurry of cultural references, intentionally inconsistent characterization, and considerable self-reflexivity about television conventions and the status of the programme as a television show.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=King |first=Geoff|authorlink=Kristin Thompson|title=New Hollywood Cinema: An Introduction |accessdate=2007-12-18|date=2002-03-29|publisher=I B Tauris &amp; Co|isbn=1-86064-750-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Bart's early [[hallmark]]s were his prank calls to [[Springfield (The Simpsons)#Moe's Tavern|Moe's Tavern]] owner [[Moe Szyslak]] in which Bart calls Moe and asks for a [[gag name]]. Moe tries to find that person in the bar, but soon realizes it is a prank call and angrily threatens Bart. These calls were based on a series of prank calls known as the [[Tube Bar prank calls|Tube Bar recordings]]. Moe was based partly on Tube Bar owner [[Louis &quot;Red&quot; Deutsch]], whose often profane responses inspired Moe's violent side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hudsonreporter.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=15354520&amp;BRD=1291&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=523586&amp;rfi=6|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071218105842/http://www.hudsonreporter.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=15354520&amp;BRD=1291&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=523586&amp;rfi=6|archivedate=2007-12-18|title=Joke on 'Simpsons' started in JC|accessdate=2008-10-30|date=2005-08-10|work=[[Hudson Reporter]]|author=Kaulessar, Ricardo}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the series progressed, it became more difficult for the writers to come up with a fake name and to write Moe's angry response, and the pranks were dropped as a regular joke during the fourth season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Some&quot;&gt;[[James L.

Commentary for &quot;[[Moaning Lisa]]&quot;, in ''The Simpsons: The Complete First Season'' [DVD]. 20th Century Fox.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Simpsons'' also often includes [[Meta-reference|self-referential]] humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Doh!

The show uses [[catchphrase]]s, and most of the primary and secondary characters have at least one each.&lt;ref&gt;Turner p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; Notable expressions include Homer's annoyed grunt &quot;[[D'oh!]]&quot;, Mr. Burns' &quot;Excellent...&quot; and [[Nelson Muntz]]'s &quot;''Ha''-ha!&quot;. Some of Bart's catchphrases, such as &quot;''[[¡Ay, caramba!]]''&quot;, &quot;[[Don't have a cow]], man!&quot; and &quot;Eat my shorts!&quot; appeared on t-shirts in the show's early days.&lt;ref&gt;Turner p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; However, Bart rarely used the latter two phrases until after they became popular through the [[merchandising]]. The use of many of these catchphrases has declined in recent seasons. The episode &quot;[[Bart Gets Famous]]&quot; mocks catchphrase-based humor, as Bart achieves fame on the ''Krusty the Clown Show'' solely for saying &quot;I didn't do it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Turner p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

===Idioms===
A number of [[neologism]]s that originated on ''The Simpsons'' have entered popular vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/beyond-doh-simpsons-quotes-for-everyday-use,1543/|title=Beyond &quot;D'oh!&quot;: Simpsons Quotes For Everyday Use|author=Bahn, Christopher|coauthors=Donna Bowman, Josh Modell, Noel Murray, Nathan Rabin, Tasha Robinson, Kyle Ryan, Scott Tobias|accessdate=2006-07-03|date=2006-04-26|publisher=The A.V.

===Television===
''The Simpsons'' was the first successful animated program in American prime time since ''[[Wait Till Your Father Gets Home]]'' in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Alberti, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt; During most of the 1980s, US pundits considered animated shows as appropriate only for children, and animating a show was too expensive to achieve a quality suitable for prime-time television. ''The Simpsons'' changed this perception.&lt;ref name=&quot;animation&quot;/&gt; The use of Korean animation studios for [[inbetweening|tweening]], coloring, and filming made the episodes cheaper. The success of ''The Simpsons'' and the lower production cost prompted US television networks to take chances on other animated series.&lt;ref name=&quot;animation&quot;/&gt; This development led US producers to a 1990s boom in new, animated prime-time shows, such as ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]'', ''[[King of the Hill]]'', ''[[Futurama]]'', and ''[[The Critic]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;animation&quot;/&gt; &quot;''The Simpsons'' created an audience for prime-time animation that had not been there for many, many years&quot;, said ''[[Family Guy]]'' creator [[Seth MacFarlane]]. &quot;As far as I'm concerned, they basically re-invented the wheel. They created what is in many ways—you could classify it as—a wholly new medium.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/features/2007/08/simpsons200708|accessdate=2008-10-18|date=August 2007|title=Simpson Family Values|first=John|last=Ortved|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''South Park'' later paid homage to ''The Simpsons'' with the episode &quot;[[Simpsons Already Did It]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1647331,00.html|title=The Simpsons, Bigger and Better|accessdate=2007-08-01|date=2007-07-29|author=Richard Corliss|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], the animated television sitcom ''[[The Samsonadzes]]'', launched in November 2009, has been noted for its very strong resemblance with ''The Simpsons'', which its creator Shalva Ramishvili has acknowledged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8494926.stm &quot;Putin appears in Georgia's Simpsons-like cartoon show&quot;].

''The Simpsons'' has been praised by many critics, being described as &quot;the most irreverent and unapologetic show on the air.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bostonphoenix.com/archive/tv/97/05/TEN_REASONS.html|title=Eye pleasers|accessdate=2008-01-27|work=[[The Phoenix (newspaper)|The Boston Phoenix]]|first=Ted|last=Drozdowski|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1990 review of the show, Ken Tucker of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' described it as &quot;the American family at its most complicated, drawn as simple cartoons.

===Run length achievements===

In 2009, Fox began a year-long celebration of the show titled &quot;Best. 20 Years. Ever.&quot; to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the premiere of ''The Simpsons''.

As of the twenty-first season (2009–2010), ''The Simpsons'' became the longest-running American primetime, scripted television series, having surpassed ''[[Gunsmoke]]''. However, ''Gunsmoke'''s episode count of 635 episodes far surpasses ''The Simpsons'', which would not reach that mark until its approximate 29th season, under normal programming schedules.&lt;ref name=&quot;longsitcom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Television/story?id=5888441&amp;page=1|title='The Simpsons' Hits a Landmark|first=Bill|last=Keveney|date=2008-09-28|accessdate=2008-10-02|publisher=[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, Fox announced that ''The Simpsons'' had been renewed for a 24th and 25th season, which means the show will reach at least 559 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fox renews 'The Simpsons' for 24th, 25th seasons|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/07/showbiz/simpsons-renewed/index.html?hpt=hp_c2|publisher=CNN|accessdate=8 October 2011|date=8 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC2012-02-20&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-17092968 | title = The Simpsons' 500th episode airs | date = 20 February 2012 | publisher = [[BBC News Online]] | accessdate = 21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism and controversy===
Bart's rebellious nature, which frequently resulted in no punishment for his misbehavior, led some parents and [[Conservatism|conservatives]] to characterize him as a poor [[role model]] for children.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Turner|Turner]], p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6252856.stm|title=Is The Simpsons still subversive?|accessdate=2007-08-06|date=2007-06-29|author=Rosenbaum, Martin|publisher=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; In schools, educators claimed that Bart was a &quot;threat to learning&quot; because of his &quot;underachiever and proud of it&quot; attitude and negative attitude regarding his education.&lt;ref name=&quot;BartaBrat&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Is Bart a brat?

Various episodes of the show have generated controversy. The Simpsons visit Australia in &quot;[[Bart vs. Australia]]&quot; ([[The Simpsons (season 6)|season six]], 1995) and Brazil in &quot;[[Blame It on Lisa]]&quot; ([[The Simpsons (season 13)|season 13]], 2002) and both episodes generated controversy and negative reaction in the visited countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;iT2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0317/1224242946443.html|work=The Irish Times|title=Cartoon family get animated on first Irish visit|date=2009-03-17|accessdate=2009-04-15|author=Carroll, Steven}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, Rio de Janeiro's tourist board&amp;nbsp;– who claimed that the city was portrayed as having rampant street crime, kidnappings, slums, and monkey and rat infestations&amp;nbsp;– went so far as to threaten Fox with legal action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1931551.stm|title=Simpsons apologize to Rio|date=2002-04-15|accessdate=2009-03-17|publisher=BBC News Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groening was a fierce and vocal critic of the episode &quot;[[A Star Is Burns]]&quot; ([[The Simpsons (season 6)|season six]], 1995) which featured a [[fictional crossover|crossover]] with ''[[The Critic]]''. He felt that it was just an advertisement for ''The Critic'', and that people would incorrectly associate the show with him. When he was unsuccessful in getting the episode pulled, he had his name removed from the credits and went public with his concerns, openly criticizing James L. Brooks and saying the episode &quot;violates the Simpsons' universe.&quot; In response, Brooks said &quot;I am furious with Matt, [...] he's allowed his opinion, but airing this publicly in the press is going too far.

Many fans and critics reacted negatively to the revelation that [[Principal Skinner|Seymour Skinner]], a recurring character since the first season, was an impostor. The episode has been criticized by Groening and by [[Harry Shearer]], who provides the voice of Skinner. In a 2001 interview, Shearer recalled that after reading the script, he told the writers, &quot;That's so wrong. You're taking something that an audience has built eight years or nine years of investment in and just tossed it in the trash can for no good reason, for a story we've done before with other characters. It's so arbitrary and gratuitous, and it's disrespectful to the audience.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eastbayexpress.com/ebx/shearer-delight/Content?oid=1065334 |title=Shearer Delight|author=Wilonsky, Robert|date=2001-04-27|accessdate=2009-04-15|work=[[East Bay Express]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics' reviews of early ''Simpsons'' episodes praised the show for its wit, realism, and intelligence.&lt;ref name=&quot;toonterrific&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;calgary&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Bob|last=Remington|title=It's The Simpsons, Man|publisher=TV Times (''[[Calgary Herald]]'')|page=10|date=1990-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, around the airing of season ten, the tone and emphasis of the show began to change. Some critics started calling the show &quot;tired&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;slate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2078501/|title=Who turned America's best TV show into a cartoon?|accessdate=2006-07-03|author=Suellentrop, Chris|date=2003-02-12|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2000, some long-term fans had become disillusioned with the show and pointed to its shift from character-driven plots to what they perceived as an overemphasis on zany antics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/entertainment/tv/feature/2000/01/24/simpsons/index.html|title=Worst Episode Ever|accessdate=2006-07-03|author=Weinman, Jaime J.|date=2000-01-24|publisher=[[Salon (website)|Salon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/3341530|title='The Simpsons' has lost its cool|accessdate=2008-01-27|author=Bonné, Jon |date=2000-09-02|publisher=[[NBCNews.com|msnbc.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnndecline/&gt; The BBC noted &quot;the common consensus is that ''The Simpsons''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; golden era ended after [[The Simpsons (season 9)|season nine]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= The Simpsons: 10 classic episodes | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8449416.stm | publisher=BBC News Online | date= 2010-01-14 | accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Todd Leopold of CNN, in an article looking at its perceived decline, stated &quot;for many fans {{interp|...}} the glory days are long past.&quot;&lt;ref name=cnndecline&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/TV/12/14/simpsons.anniversary.end/index.html|title=Is it time for 'The Simpsons' to 'g'oh'?|publisher=CNN|author=Leopold, Todd|date=2009-12-14|accessdate=2010-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Schembri of the ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' called the show &quot;a cultural touchstone for at least two—possibly three—generations of couch potatoes&quot;, but claimed that the show has declined in quality. He attributed this decline in quality to an abandonment of character-driven storylines in favour of and overuse of celebrity [[cameo appearance]]s and references to popular culture. Schembri wrote: &quot;The central tragedy of ''The Simpsons'' is that it has gone from commanding attention to merely being attention seeking. It began by proving that cartoon characters don't have to be caricatures; they can be invested with real emotions. Now the show has in essence fermented into a limp parody of itself. Memorable story arcs have been sacrificed for the sake of celebrity walk-ons and punchline-hungry dialogue.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/tv-and-radio/pop-spoofs-no-longer-the-main-draw-20111109-1n614.html#ixzz1dHgzL7xF|title=Pop spoofs no longer the main draw|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=2011-11-10|date=2011-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Author [[Douglas Coupland]] described claims of declining quality in the series as &quot;hogwash&quot;, saying &quot;''The Simpsons'' hasn't fumbled the ball in fourteen years, it's hardly likely to fumble it now.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. xiii&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Scully]], who was showrunner during seasons nine through [[The Simpsons (season 12)|twelve]], has been the subject of criticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scully&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Turner, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Suellentrop of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' wrote that &quot;under Scully's tenure, ''The Simpsons'' became, well, a cartoon. {{interp|...}} Episodes that once would have ended with [[Duffless|Homer and Marge bicycling into the sunset]] now end with [[It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad Marge|Homer blowing a tranquilizer dart into Marge's neck]].

Once you've done that you can go on forever.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Clark, Stuart|date=2007-01-19|url=http://www.hotpress.com/features/interviews/2905326.html?page_no=4|title=Homer is where the heart is (page 4)|work= [[Hot Press]]|accessdate=2009-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, to celebrate the show's 300th episode &quot;[[Barting Over]]&quot;, ''[[USA Today]]'' published a pair of Simpsons related articles: a top-ten episodes list chosen by the webmaster of [[The Simpsons Archive]] fansite,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-02-06-fan-favorites_x.htm|title=10 fan favorites|accessdate=2006-07-03|author=Paakkinen, Jouni|date=2003-02-06|work=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a top-15 list by ''The Simpsons''' own writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2003-02-06-favorites_x.htm |title=15 writer favorites|accessdate=2006-07-03|date=2003-02-06|work=[[USA Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent episode listed on the fan list was 1997's &quot;[[Homer's Phobia]]&quot;; the Simpsons' writers most recent choice was 2000's &quot;[[Behind the Laughter]]&quot;. In 2004, [[Harry Shearer]] criticized what he perceived as the show's declining quality: &quot;I rate the last three seasons as among the worst, so Season Four looks very good to me now.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris|last=Leggett|title=Harry Shearer|publisher=UK Teletext|date=2004-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, [[Dan Castellaneta]] stated &quot;I don't agree, [...] I think Harry's issue is that the show isn't as grounded as it was in the first three or four seasons, that it's gotten crazy or a little more madcap. I think it organically changes to stay fresh.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,129665,00.html|title=D'oh!: The Voice of Homer Is Deceivingly Deadpan|publisher=Fox News|date=2004-08-23|author=Elber, Lynn|accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the criticism, ''The Simpsons'' manages to maintain a large viewership and attract new fans. While the first season enjoyed an average of 13.4 million viewers per episode in the U.S.,&lt;ref name=&quot;season1ratings&quot;/&gt; the twenty-first season had an average of 7.2 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/05/full-series-rankings-for-the-2009-10-broadcast-season |title=Full Series Rankings For The 2009–10 Broadcast Season&amp;nbsp;– |publisher=Deadline.com |date=2010-05-27 |accessdate=2010-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an April 2006 interview, Matt Groening said, &quot;I honestly don't see any end in sight. I think it's possible that the show will become too financially cumbersome... but right now, the show is creatively, I think, as good or better than it's ever been. The animation is incredibly detailed and imaginative, and the stories do things that we haven't done before. So creatively there's no reason to quit.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/matt-groening,13984/|title=Matt Groening interview with The A.V.

[[20th Century Fox]], [[Gracie Films]], and [[Film Roman]] produced ''[[The Simpsons Movie]]'', an animated film that was released on July 27, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;simpsonmovie&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117940840?refCatId=14|title=Homer going to bat in '07|accessdate=2006-07-03|author=Fleming, Michael|date=2006-04-02|publisher=Variety.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was directed by long-time ''Simpsons'' producer [[David Silverman]] and written by a team of ''Simpsons'' writers comprising Matt Groening, James L.

James L. Brooks originally thought that the story of the episode &quot;[[Kamp Krusty]]&quot; was suitable for a film, but he encountered difficulties in trying to expand the script to feature-length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people=Groening, Matt; Al Jean, Mark Kirkland, David Silverman|date=2004|title=The Simpsons season 4 DVD commentary for the episode &quot;Kamp Krusty&quot;| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a long time, difficulties such as lack of a suitable story and an already fully engaged crew of writers delayed the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub3&quot;/&gt;

The popularity of ''The Simpsons'' has made it a billion-dollar merchandising industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;mikescully&quot;/&gt; The title family and supporting characters appear on everything from t-shirts to posters. ''The Simpsons'' has been used as a theme for special editions of well-known board games, including [[Cluedo|Clue]], [[Scrabble]], [[Monopoly (game)|Monopoly]], [[Operation (game)|Operation]], and [[The Game of Life]], as well as the [[trivia]] games What Would Homer Do? and Simpsons [[Jeopardy!]]. Several card games such as [[Trump|trump cards]] and The Simpsons Trading Card Game have also been released. Many official or unofficial ''Simpsons'' books such as episode guides have been published. Many episodes of the show have been released on DVD and VHS over the years. When the first season DVD was released in 2001, it quickly became the best-selling television DVD in history, although it was later overtaken by the first season of ''[[Chappelle's Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/news/Chappelles/2338|title=Chapelle's Show—S1 DVD Passes ''The Simpsons'' As #1 All-Time TV-DVD; Celebrates by Announcing Season 2!|accessdate=2006-07-03|author=Lambert, David|date=2004-09-19|publisher=TVshowsonDVD.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, seasons one through fourteen have been released on DVD in the U.S. ([[DVD region code|Region 1]]), Europe ([[DVD region code|Region 2]]) and Australia/New Zealand/Latin America ([[DVD region code|Region 4]]) with more seasons expected to be released in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvshowsondvd.com/releaselist.cfm?ShowID=3824&amp;Studio=2 DVD release dates] at [[TVShowsOnDVD.com]].
