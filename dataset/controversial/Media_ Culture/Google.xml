&lt;!--intro--&gt;'''Google Inc.''' ({{NASDAQ|GOOG}}) is an American [[Multinational corporation|multinational]] corporation which provides Internet-related products and services, including [[internet search]], [[cloud computing]], [[software]] and [[advertising]] technologies.&lt;ref&gt;See: [[List of Google products]].&lt;/ref&gt; Advertising revenues from [[AdWords]] generate almost all of the company's profits.&lt;!--37905/36531 = 96% in 2011--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;financialtables&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investor.google.com/fin_data.html |title=Financial Tables |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=May 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Online Ads Give Google Huge Gain in Profit |first=David A. |last=Vise |url= |newspaper=The Washington Post |date=October 21, 2005 |accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--history--&gt;The company was founded by [[Larry Page]] and [[Sergey Brin]] while both attended [[Stanford University]]. Together, Brin and Page own about 16 percent of the company's stake. Google was first incorporated as a privately held company on September&amp;nbsp;4, 1998, and its [[initial public offering]] followed on August&amp;nbsp;19, 2004. The company's mission statement from the outset was &quot;to organize the world's information and make it universally accessible and useful&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;corporate&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/corporate/ |title=Google Corporate Information |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the company's unofficial slogan is &quot;[[Don't be evil]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://investor.google.com/conduct.html |title=Google Code of Conduct |date=April 8, 2009 |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogoscoped.com/archive/2007-07-16-n55.html |title=Paul Buchheit on Gmail, AdSense and More |first=Philip|last=Lenssen |date=July 16, 2007 |publisher=Google Blogoscoped |accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the company moved to its current headquarters in [[Mountain View, California]].

&lt;!--portfolio--&gt;Rapid growth since incorporation has triggered a chain of products, [[Mergers and acquisitions|acquisitions]], and partnerships beyond [[Google Search|the company's core web search engine]]. The company offers online [[productivity software]] including [[webmail|email]], an [[online office suite|office suite]], and [[social networking]]. Google's products extend to the [[Desktop environment|desktop]] as well, with applications for web browsing, organizing and [[photo editor|editing photos]], and [[instant messaging]]. Google leads the development of the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile [[operating system]], as well as the [[Google Chrome OS]] browser-only operating system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/chromebook |title=Chromebook |publisher=Google |accessdate=August 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; found on specialized [[netbook]]s called [[Chromebook]]s.

[[File:Google1998.png|thumb|left|Google's original homepage had a simple design, since its founders were not experienced in [[HTML]], the language for designing web pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alan.blog-city.com/an_evening_with_googles_marissa_mayer.htm |title=An evening with Google's Marissa Mayer |last=Williamson |first=Alan |publisher=Alan Williamson |date=January 12, 2005 |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=Google's homepage in 1998]] Google began in January 1996 as a research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD students at Stanford University in California.&lt;ref name=&quot;milestones&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/corporate/history.html |title=Google Milestones |work=Corporate Information |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While conventional search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search terms appeared on the page, the two theorized about a better system that analyzed the relationships between websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/422/ |title=The PageRank Citation Ranking: Bringing Order to the Web |last1=Page |first1=Lawrence |last2=Brin |first2=Sergey |last3=Motwani |first3=Rajeev |last4=Winograd |first4=Terry |date=November 11, 1999 |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They called this new technology [[PageRank]], where a website's [[relevance (information retrieval)|relevance]] was determined by the number of pages, and the importance of those pages, that linked back to the original site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/corporate/tech.html |title=Technology Overview |work=Corporate Information |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=February 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=www-diglib.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/WP/get/SIDL-WP-1997-0072?1 |title=PageRank: Bringing Order to the Web |last=Page |first=Larry |work=Stanford Digital Library Project |date=August 18, 1997 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020506051802/www-diglib.stanford.edu/cgi-bin/WP/get/SIDL-WP-1997-0072?1 |archivedate=May 6, 2002 |accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A small search engine called &quot;RankDex&quot; from IDD Information Services designed by [[Robin Li]] was, since 1996, already exploring a similar strategy for site-scoring and page ranking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Li |first=Yanhong |date=August 6, 2002 |title=Toward a qualitative search engine |journal=Internet Computing, IEEE |volume=2 |issue=4 |pages=24–29 |publisher=IEEE Computer Society |issn=1089-7801 |doi=10.1109/4236.707687 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/search/freesrchabstract.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=707687 |accessdate=February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technology in RankDex would be patented&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite patent |country=US |number=5920859 |status=patent |title=Hypertext document retrieval system and method |gdate=July 6, 1999 |fdate=February 5, 1997 |invent1=Li, Yanhong |assign1=IDD Enterprises, L.P. |class=G06F17/30D |accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used later when Li founded [[Baidu]] in China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/forbes/2009/1005/technology-baidu-robin-li-man-whos-beating-google_2.html |title=The Man Who's Beating Google |last=Greenberg |first=Andy |work=Forbes Magazine |date=October 5, 2009 |accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rankdex.com/about.html |title=About: RankDex |publisher=RankDex.com |accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Page and Brin originally nicknamed their new search engine &quot;BackRub&quot;, because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=The Birth of Google |first=John |last=Battelle |newspaper=Wired Magazine |date=August 2005 |url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/battelle.html?tw=wn_tophead_4 |accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.static.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/22707.html |title=9 People, Places &amp; Things That Changed Their Names |publisher=Mental Floss |accessdate=December 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://huron.stanford.edu |title=Backrub search engine at Stanford University |archiveurl=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/19961224105215/http://huron.stanford.edu/ |archivedate=December 24, 1996 |accessdate=March 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, they changed the name to Google, originating from a misspelling of the word &quot;[[googol]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://graphics.stanford.edu/~dk/google_name_origin.html |title=Origin of the name &quot;Google&quot; |last=Koller |first=David |date=January 2004 |publisher=Stanford University | accessdate=2012-07-04|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/68ubHzYs7| archivedate=2012-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.stanforddaily.com/2003/02/12/from-googol-to-google/ |title=From Googol to Google |last=Hanley |first=Rachael |date=February 12, 2003 |newspaper=The Stanford Daily |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=February 15, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the number one followed by one hundred zeros, which was picked to signify that the search engine wants to provide large quantities of information for people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/company.html |title=Google!

The domain name for Google was registered on September 15, 1997,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://whois.dnsstuff.com/tools/whois.ch?ip=google.com |title=WHOIS&amp;nbsp;– google.com |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the company was incorporated on September 4, 1998.

In May 2011, the number of monthly unique visitors to Google surpassed 1 billion for the first time, an 8.4 percent increase from May 2010 (931 million).&lt;ref&gt;[http://itsalltech.com/2011/06/22/googles-new-record-1-billion-visitors-in-may/ Google’s new record, 1 billion visitors in May | It's All Tech&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Financing and initial public offering ===

The first funding for Google was an August 1998 contribution of {{US$|100,000}} from [[Andy Bechtolsheim]], co-founder of [[Sun Microsystems]], given before Google was even incorporated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bechtolsheim&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/04/29/MNGLD6CFND34.DTL|title=For early Googlers, key word is $$$|last=Kopytoff|first=Verne|date=April 29, 2004|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|publisher=Hearst Communications|accessdate=February 19, 2010|location=San Francisco}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1999, while still graduate students, Brin and Page decided that the search engine they had developed was taking up too much of their time from academic pursuits.

Overture Services would later be bought by Yahoo! and renamed [[Yahoo! Search Marketing]]. The case was then settled out of court, with Google agreeing to issue shares of common stock to Yahoo! in exchange for a perpetual license.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/Google,-Yahoo-bury-the-legal-hatchet/2100-1024_3-5302421.html|title=Google, Yahoo bury the legal hatchet|last=Olsen|first=Stephanie|date=August 9, 2004|newspaper=CNET News|publisher=CNET|accessdate=February 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the many companies Google has purchased, the company has partnered with other organizations for everything from research to advertising.

In 2010, [[Google Energy]] made its first investment in a [[renewable energy]] project, putting $38.8&amp;nbsp;million into two wind farms in [[North Dakota]]. The company announced the two locations will generate 169.5&amp;nbsp;megawatts of power, or enough to supply 55,000 homes. The farms, which were developed by NextEra Energy Resources, will reduce fossil fuel use in the region and return profits. NextEra Energy Resources sold Google a twenty percent stake in the project to get funding for its development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Google Invests in Two Wind Farms |first1=Scott |last1=Morrison |first2=Cassandra |last2=Sweet |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |date=May 4, 2010 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704342604575222420304732394.html |accessdate=November 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2010, Google purchased Global IP Solutions, a Norway-based company that provides web-based teleconferencing and other related services.

In a post on Google's blog, Google Chief Executive and co-founder Larry Page revealed that Google's acquisition of Motorola Mobility is a strategic move to strengthen Google's patent portfolio. The company's Android operating system has come under fire in an industry-wide patent battle, as Apple and Microsoft have taken to court Android device makers such as HTC, Samsung and Motorola.&lt;ref name=&quot;appleinsider1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Hughes |first=Neil |url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/08/15/google_ceo_anticompetitive_apple_microsoft_forced_motorola_deal.html |title=Google CEO: 'Anticompetitive' Apple, Microsoft forced Motorola deal |publisher=AppleInsider |accessdate=August 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merger was completed on the 22 May 2012, after the approval of People's Republic of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-18164190|title=Google |accessdate=2012-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This purchase was made in part to help Google gain Motorola's considerable patent portfolio on mobile phones and wireless technologies to help protect it in its ongoing patent disputes with other companies,&lt;ref name=&quot;supercharging android&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Page |first=Larry |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/supercharging-android-google-to-acquire.html |title=Official Google Blog: Supercharging Android: Google to Acquire Motorola Mobility |publisher=Googleblog.blogspot.com |accessdate=August 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; mainly [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Microsoft]]&lt;ref name=&quot;appleinsider1&quot;/&gt; and to allow it to continue to freely offer [[Android (operating system)|Android]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cnet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Google to buy Motorola Mobility for $12.5B|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1035_3-20092362-94/google-to-buy-motorola-mobility-for-$12.5b/|first=Roger|last=Cheng|date=August 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, 96% of Google's revenue was derived from its advertising programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report

For the 2006 fiscal year, the company reported $10.492&amp;nbsp;billion in total advertising revenues and only $112&amp;nbsp;million in licensing and other revenues.&lt;ref name=&quot;10-K&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312507044494/d10k.htm|title=Form 10-K&amp;nbsp;– Annual Report|accessdate=July 5, 2010|publisher=SEC|work=EDGAR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google has implemented various innovations in the online advertising market that helped make it one of the biggest brokers in the market. Using technology from the company [[DoubleClick]], Google can determine user interests and target advertisements so they are relevant to their context and the user that is viewing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Nakashima, Ellen |title=Some Web Firms Say They Track Behavior Without Explicit Consent |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/11/AR2008081102270_pf.html |date=August 12, 2008 |publisher=The Washington Post Company |work=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 1, 2008 |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Helft, Miguel|title=Google to Offer Ads Based on Interests |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/11/technology/internet/11google.html |work=The New York Times |date=March 11, 2009 |accessdate=March 10, 2009 |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Google Analytics]] allows website owners to track where and how people use their website, for example by examining click rates for all the links on a page.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Bright, Peter |title=Surfing on the sly with IE8's new &quot;InPrivate&quot; Internet |url=http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2008/08/surfing-on-the-sly-ie8s-inprivate-internet.ars |date=August 27, 2008 |publisher=Ars Technica |accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google advertisements can be placed on third-party websites in a two-part program. Google's [[AdWords]] allows advertisers to display their advertisements in the Google content network, through either a cost-per-click or cost-per-view scheme. The sister service, Google [[AdSense]], allows website owners to display these advertisements on their website, and earn money every time ads are clicked.&lt;ref name=&quot;AdSense&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/adsense/login/en_US/?sourceid=aso&amp;subid=uk-en-ha&amp;utm_medium=ha&amp;utm_term=adsense&amp;gsessionid=O---pJlnnf2wFZF8qu81Lg |title=AdSense |accessdate=October 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the disadvantages and criticisms of this program is Google's inability to combat [[click fraud]], when a person or automated script &quot;clicks&quot; on advertisements without being interested in the product, which causes that advertiser to pay money to Google unduly. Industry reports in 2006 claim that approximately 14 to 20 percent of clicks were in fact fraudulent or invalid.&lt;ref&gt;Mills, Elinor. &quot;[http://news.cnet.com/Google-to-offer-advertisers-click-fraud-stats/2100-1024_3-6098469.html Google to offer advertisers click fraud stats].&quot; ''[http://www.cnet.com/ c net].'' July 25, 2006. Retrieved July 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, there has been controversy over Google's &quot;search within a search&quot;, where a secondary search box enables the user to find what they are looking for within a particular website. It was soon reported that when performing a search within a search for a specific company, advertisements from competing and rival companies often showed up along with those results, drawing users away from the site they were originally searching.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.searchengineoptimizationjournal.com/2008/03/24/why-companies-are-upset-about-googles-search-within-search/ |title=Why Companies Are Upset With Google's Search-Within-Search |author=Stamoulis, Nick |publisher=Search Engine Optimization Journal |date=March 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another complaint against Google's advertising is its censorship of advertisers, though many cases concern compliance with the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]]. For example, in February 2003, Google stopped showing the advertisements of [[Oceana (non-profit group)|Oceana]], a non-profit organization protesting a major cruise ship's sewage treatment practices. Google cited its editorial policy at the time, stating &quot;Google does not accept advertising if the ad or site advocates against other individuals, groups, or organizations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2004/05/17/google-somewhat-lifts-oceana-ad-ban|title= Google Somewhat Lifts Oceana Ad Ban|publisher=webpronews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The policy was later changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.google.com/adsense/static/en_US/Terms.html|title= Google AdSense Online Standard Terms and Conditions |publisher=Google AdSense}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2008, Google reached an advertising agreement with Yahoo!, which would have allowed Yahoo! to feature Google advertisements on its web pages. The alliance between the two companies was never completely realized due to [[Competition law|antitrust]] concerns by the [[U.S. Department of Justice]]. As a result, Google pulled out of the deal in November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloggingstocks.com/2008/10/31/yahoo-and-google-may-dump-their-deal/print/ |title=Yahoo and Google may dump their deal|last= Mclntyre|first=Douglas |publisher=Bloggingstocks.com |date=October 31, 2008 |accessdate=October 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/11/ending-our-agreement-with-yahoo.html |title=Ending our agreement with Yahoo!|last= Drummond|first=David|date= November 5, 2008 |work=The Official Google Blog.

In an attempt to advertise its own products, Google launched a website called [http://www.demoslam.com/ Demo Slam], developed to demonstrate [[technology demo]]s of [[List of Google products|Google Products]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.demoslam.com/#/what |title=Google Demo Slam |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each week, two teams compete at putting Google's technology into new contexts.

[[Google Search]], a web search engine, is the company's most popular service. According to market research published by [[comScore]] in November 2009, Google is the dominant search engine in the United States market, with a [[market share]] of 65.6%.&lt;ref name=&quot;comscore&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|date=December 16, 2006| title=comScore Releases November 2009 U.S. Search Engine Rankings|url=http://www.comscore.com/Press_Events/Press_Releases/2009/12/comScore_Releases_November_2009_U.S._Search_Engine_Rankings|accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google indexes billions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Michael |last=Arrington |url=http://techcrunch.com/2008/07/25/googles-misleading-blog-post-on-the-size-of-the-web/ |title=Google's Misleading Blog Post: The Size Of The Web And The Size Of Their Index Are Very Different |publisher=Techcrunch.com |date=July 25, 2008 |accessdate=December 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; of web pages, so that users can search for the information they desire, through the use of keywords and operators. Despite its popularity, it has received criticism from a number of organizations. In 2003, ''[[The New York Times]]'' complained about Google's indexing, claiming that Google's [[web cache|caching]] of content on its site infringed its copyright for the content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1038_3-1024234.html |title=Google cache raises copyright concerns |last1=Olsen |first1=Stefanie |date=July 9, 2003 |work=CNET News |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=June 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, the United States District Court of Nevada ruled in favor of Google in ''[[Field v.

In early 2006, the company launched Google Video, which allowed users to upload, search, and watch videos from the Internet.&lt;ref name=&quot;video2006&quot;&gt;Tyler, Nathan. &quot;[http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/video_marketplace.html Google to Launch Video Marketplace].&quot; ''Google.'' January 6, 2006.

Google's most recent development in search is its partnership with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] to create Google Patents, which enables free access to information about patents and trademarks.

One of the more controversial search services Google hosts is [[Google Books]]. The company began scanning books and uploading limited previews, and full books where allowed, into its new book search engine. The [[Authors Guild]], a group that represents 8,000 U.S. authors, filed a class action suit in a New York City federal court against Google in 2005 over this new service. Google replied that it is in compliance with all existing and historical applications of copyright laws regarding books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=China |last=Martin |url=http://www.infoworld.com/t/platforms/google-hit-second-lawsuit-over-library-project-722 |title=Google hit with second lawsuit over Library project |publisher=[[InfoWorld]] |date=November 26, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google eventually reached a revised settlement in 2009 to limit its scans to books from the U.S., the UK, Australia and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Pettersson, Edvard|title=Google Wins Preliminary Approval of Online Books Settlement|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=ahUxORgasDFs|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=November 20, 2009|accessdate=December 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the Paris Civil Court ruled against Google in late 2009, asking it to remove the works of La Martinière ([[Éditions du Seuil]]) from its database.&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{Cite news|author=Smith, Heather|title=Google's French Book Scanning Project Halted by Court |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=apZ3UG9CPLo8|publisher=Bloomberg L.P.|date=December 18, 2009|accessdate=December 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In competition with [[Amazon.com]], Google plans to sell digital versions of new books.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author=Rich, Motoko| title=Preparing to Sell E-Books, Google Takes on Amazon |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/01/technology/internet/01google.html|date=May 31, 2009|work=The New York Times |accessdate=December 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 21, 2010, in response to newcomer [[Bing]], Google updated its image search to display a streaming sequence of [[thumbnail]]s that enlarge when pointed at. Though web searches still appear in a batch per page format, on July 23, 2010, dictionary definitions for certain English words began appearing above the linked results for web searches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/07/this-week-in-search-72510.html |title=This Week in Search 7/25/10 |last1=Mayer |first1=Marissa |work=Official Google Blog |publisher=Google, Inc. |date=July 25, 2010 |accessdate=July 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google's algorithm was changed in March 2011, giving more weight to high-quality content&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://linksku.com/link?u=7910|title=Google's Code Shift |date=March 10, 2011 |accessdate=March 10, 2011}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly by the use of n-grams to remove spun content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scott-herbert.com/blog/2011/04/14/how-panderfarmer-may-be-finding-spun-and-plagiarised-content-622|title=How Pander/Farmer may be finding spun and plagiarised content. |date=April 14, 2011 |accessdate=April 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Productivity tools ===

In addition to its standard web search services, Google has released over the years a number of online productivity tools. Gmail&lt;!--, known in the United Kingdom and Germany as Google Mail,--&gt;, a free webmail service provided by Google, was launched as an invitation-only [[Betaware|beta program]] on April 1, 2004,&lt;ref name=&quot;GmailCashmore&quot; /&gt; and became available to the general public on February 7, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2007/02/anyone-can-signup-for-gmail-account.html |title=More People Can Sign up for a Gmail Account |last=Chitu |first=Ionut Alex. |date=February 7, 2007 |publisher=Google Operating System Blog |accessdate=April 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service was upgraded from beta status on July 7, 2009,&lt;ref name=&quot;appsoutofbeta&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/07/google-apps-is-out-of-beta-yes-really.html |title=Google Apps is out of beta (yes, really) |first=Matthew |last=Glotzbach |date=July 7, 2009 |work=Official Google Blog |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; at which time it had 146&amp;nbsp;million users monthly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geek.com/articles/news/facebook-strikes-back-at-google-integrates-its-chat-with-aol-instant-messenger-20100211/ |title=Facebook strikes back at Google, integrates its chat with AOL Instant Messenger |first=Christian |last=Zibreg |date=February 11, 2010 |work=Geek.com |publisher=Geek.com, LLC |at=para. 5 |accessdate=April 2, 2010 |quote=While Gmail's 146&amp;nbsp;million monthly users are no match for Facebook’s 400+ million-strong user base, not all of them use built-in chat.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service would be the first online email service with one [[gigabyte]] of storage, and the first to keep emails from the same conversation together in one thread, similar to an Internet forum.&lt;ref name=&quot;GmailCashmore&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/04/01/cashmore.gmail/ |title=Six ways Gmail revolutionized e-mail |first=Pete |last=Cashmore |date=April 1, 2010 |publisher=CNN News |publisher=Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. |location=London, England |accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service currently offers over 7600 MB of free storage with additional storage ranging from 20 GB to 16 TB available for {{US$|0.25}} per 1 GB per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2009/11/twice-storage-for-quarter-of-price.html |title=Twice the storage for a quarter of the price |last=Lee |first=Elvin |date=November 10, 2009 |work=Official Google Blog |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=April 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, software developers know Gmail for its pioneering use of [[AJAX]], a programming technique that allows web pages to be interactive without refreshing the browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/happy-sixth-birthday-google-mail--680998 |title=Happy sixth birthday, Google Mail! |first=Gary |last=Marshall |date=April 1, 2010 |work=TechRadar |publisher=Future Publishing Ltd. |accessdate=April 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; One criticism of Gmail has been the potential for data disclosure, a risk associated with many online web applications.

[[Google Docs]], another part of Google's productivity suite, allows users to create, edit, and collaborate on documents in an online environment, not dissimilar to [[Microsoft Word]]. The service was originally called Writely, but was obtained by Google on March 9, 2006, where it was released as an invitation-only preview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2006/03/writely-so.html |title=Writely so |last=Mazzon |first=Jen |date=March 9, 2006 |work=Official Google Blog |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=April 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6 after the acquisition, Google created an experimental spreadsheet editing program,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title=Google Announces limited test on Google Labs: Google Spreadsheets |publisher=Google, Inc. |date=June 6, 2006 |url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/annc/spreadsheets.html |accessdate=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would be combined with Google Docs on October 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techcrunch.com/2006/10/10/google-docs-spreadsheets-launches/ |title=Google &quot;Docs &amp; Spreadsheets&quot; Launches |last=Arrington |first=Michael |date=October 10, 2006 |publisher=TechCrunch |accessdate=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A program to edit presentations would complete the set on September 17, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13515_3-9780287-26.html |title=Google Presentations gets the green light |last=Hoffman |first=Harrison |date=September 17, 2007 |work=CNET News |publisher=CBS Interactive, Inc. |accessdate=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; before all three services were taken out of beta along with Gmail, Google Calendar and all products from the Google Apps Suite on July 7, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;appsoutofbeta&quot; /&gt;

=== Enterprise products ===
[[File:Google Appliance.jpg|thumb|upright|Google's search appliance at the 2008 [[RSA Conference]]|alt=Google's search appliance]]

Google entered the enterprise market in February 2002 with the launch of its [[Google Search Appliance]], targeted toward providing search technology for larger organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;milestones&quot;/&gt; Google launched the [[Google Mini|Mini]] three years later, which was targeted at smaller organizations. Late in 2006, Google began to sell Custom Search Business Edition, providing customers with an advertising-free window into Google.com's index. The service was renamed Google Site Search in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;csbe2gss&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://searchengineland.com/google-rebrands-custom-search-business-edition-as-google-site-search-14123 |title=Google Rebrands Custom Search &quot;Business Edition&quot; As &quot;Google Site Search&quot; |last1=Sterling |first1=Greg |date=June 3, 2008 |work=Search Engine Land |publisher=Third Door Media |accessdate=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Google Apps]] is another primary Google enterprise service offering. The service allows organizations to bring Google's web application offerings, such as [[Gmail]] and [[Google Docs]], into its own domain. The service is available in several editions: a basic free edition (formerly known as Google Apps Standard edition), Google Apps for Business, Google Apps for Education, and Google Apps for Government.  Special editions include extras such as more disk space, API access, a service level agreement (SLA), premium support, and additional apps.  In the same year Google Apps was launched, Google acquired [[Postini]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2007/09/weve-officially-acquired-postini.html |title=We've Officially Acquired Postini |last1=Girouard |first1=Dave |date=September 13, 2007 |work=The Official Google Blog |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proceeded to integrate the company's security technologies into Google Apps&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title=Google Adds Postini's Security and Compliance Capabilities to Google Apps |publisher=Google, Inc. |date=October 3, 2007 |url=http://www.google.com/intl/en/press/pressrel/apps_postini_20071003.html |accessdate=June 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the name Google Postini Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/a/help/intl/en/security/index.html |title=Postini |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional Google enterprise offerings include geospatial solutions (e.g., Google Earth and Google Maps); security and archival solutions (e.g., Postini); and Chromebooks for business and education (i.e., personal computing run on browser-centric operating systems).

[[Google Translate]] is a server-side [[machine translation]] service, which can translate between 35 different languages. Browser extensions allow for easy access to Google Translate from the browser. The software uses [[corpus linguistics]] techniques, where the program &quot;learns&quot; from professionally translated documents, specifically UN and [[European Parliament]] proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Google’s Computing Power Refines Translation Tool |first=Miguel |last=Helft |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/09/technology/09translate.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 8, 2010 |at=para. 15 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a &quot;suggest a better translation&quot; feature accompanies the translated text, allowing users to indicate where the current translation is incorrect or otherwise inferior to another translation.

Google launched its [[Google News]] service in 2002. The site proclaimed that the company had created a &quot;highly unusual&quot; site that &quot;offers a news service compiled solely by computer algorithms without human intervention. Google employs no editors, managing editors, or executive editors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Joshua |last=Macht |title=Automatic for the People |url=http://www.time.com/time/business/article/0,8599,356152,00.html |work=Time Magazine |publisher=AOL Time Warner |date=September 30, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site hosted less licensed news content than Yahoo! News, and instead presented topically selected links to news and opinion pieces along with reproductions of their headlines, story leads, and photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Hannibal |last=Travis |title=Opting Out of the Internet in the United States and the European Union: Copyright, Safe Harbors, and International Law|url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1221642 |work=Notre Dame Law Review, vol. 55, p. 391 |publisher=President and Trustees of Notre Dame University in South Bend, IN | year=2008 |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photographs are typically reduced to thumbnail size and placed next to headlines from other news sources on the same topic in order to minimize copyright infringement claims. Nevertheless, Agence France Presse sued Google for copyright infringement in federal court in the District of Columbia, a case which Google settled for an undisclosed amount in a pact that included a license of the full text of AFP articles for use on Google News.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Hannibal |last=Travis |title=Opting Out of the Internet in the United States and the European Union: Copyright, Safe Harbors, and International Law |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1221642 |work=Notre Dame Law Review, vol. 55, pp. 391–92 |publisher=President and Trustees of Notre Dame University in South Bend, IN | year=2008 |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Google made a bid to offer free wireless broadband access throughout the city of San Francisco along with [[Internet service provider]] [[EarthLink]]. Large telecommunications companies such as [[Comcast]] and [[Verizon]] opposed such efforts, claiming it was &quot;unfair competition&quot; and that cities would be violating their commitments to offer local monopolies to these companies. In his testimony before Congress on [[network neutrality]] in 2006, Google's Chief Internet Evangelist [[Vint Cerf]] blamed such tactics on the fact that nearly half of all consumers lack meaningful choice in broadband providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Hannibal |last=Travis |title=Wi-Fi Everywhere: Universal Broadband Access as Antitrust and Telecommunications Policy |url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=903425 |work=American University Law Review, vol. 55, p. 1701 |publisher=President and Trustees of American University in Washington, DC | year=2006 |accessdate=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google currently offers free wi-fi access in its hometown of Mountain View, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wifi.google.com/ |title=Google WiFi for Mountain View |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Google announced the [[Google Fiber]] project with plans to build an ultra-high-speed broadband network for 50,000 to 500,000 customers in one or more American cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;HELFT 21 march&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last=  HELFT| first= | url=  http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/22/technology/22stunts.html?src=me&amp;ref=technology| title= Hoping for Gift From Google?

The service will offer three options including a free broadband internet option, a 1Gbit/s internet option for $70 per month and a version that includes television service for $120 per month.&lt;ref name=&quot;Google Fiber Cable TV Business&quot;/&gt;

In 2007, reports surfaced that Google was planning the release of its own mobile phone, possibly a competitor to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iPhone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2006/dec/17/news.mobilephones |title=The future for Orange could soon be Google in your pocket |last1=Smith |first1=David |date=December 17, 2006 |work=The Guardian  |publisher=Guardian News and Media Ltd. |accessdate=June 16, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;orlowski&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/03/16/google_phone_confirmed/ |title=Google Phone&amp;nbsp;– it's for real |last1=Orlowski |first1=Andrew |date=March 16, 2007 |work=The Register |publisher=The Register |accessdate=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ricker&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/18/the-google-switch-an-iphone-killer/ |title=The Google Switch: an iPhone killer |last1=Ricker |first1=Thomas |date=January 18, 2007 |work=Engadget |publisher=Weblogs, Inc. |accessdate=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project, called [[Android (operating system)|Android]], turned out not to be a phone but an [[operating system]] for mobile devices, which Google acquired and then released as an [[open source]] project under the [[Apache License|Apache 2.0 license]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://source.android.com/source/licenses.html |title=Licenses |work=Android Open Source Project |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=April 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google provides a [[software development kit]] for developers so applications can be created to be run on Android-based phones.

Other projects Google has worked on include a new collaborative communication service, a web browser, and even a mobile operating system. The first of these was first announced on May 27, 2009. [[Google Wave]] was described as a product that helps users communicate and collaborate on the web. The service is Google's &quot;email redesigned&quot;, with realtime editing, the ability to embed audio, video, and other media, and extensions that further enhance the communication experience. Google Wave was previously in a developer's preview, where interested users had to be invited to test the service, but was released to the general public on May 19, 2010, at Google's I/O keynote. On September 1, 2008, Google pre-announced the upcoming availability of [[Google Chrome]], an [[open-source software|open source]] [[web browser]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/09/fresh-take-on-browser.html |title=A fresh take on the browser |last1=Pichai |first1=Sundar |date=September 1, 2008 |work=Official Google Blog |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=June 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was then released on September 2, 2008.

Google uses various [[Tax avoidance|tax avoidance strategies]]. Consequently, out of the [[List of the largest technology companies|five largest American technology companies]] it pays the lowest taxes to the countries of origin of its revenues.

{{Anchor|Innovation Time Off}}As a motivation technique, Google uses a policy often called Innovation Time Off, where Google engineers are encouraged to spend 20% of their work time on projects that interest them.

Google's headquarters in [[Mountain View, California|Mountain View]], California is referred to as &quot;the [[Googleplex]]&quot;, a play on words on the number [[googolplex]] and the headquarters itself being a ''complex'' of buildings. The lobby is decorated with a piano, [[lava lamps]], old server clusters, and a projection of search queries on the wall. The hallways are full of exercise balls and bicycles. Each employee has access to the corporate recreation center. Recreational amenities are scattered throughout the campus and include a workout room with weights and rowing machines, locker rooms, washers and dryers, a massage room, assorted video games, [[table football]], a baby grand piano, a billiard table, and ping pong. In addition to the rec room, there are snack rooms stocked with various foods and drinks, with special emphasis placed on nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.google.com/corporate/culture.html About the Googleplex].&quot; ''Google''.

Google is taking steps to ensure that its operations are environmentally sound. In October 2006, the company announced plans to install thousands of [[solar panel]]s to provide up to 1.6&amp;nbsp;[[megawatt]]s of electricity, enough to satisfy approximately 30% of the campus' energy needs.&lt;ref name=&quot;solar&quot;&gt;Richmond, Riva. &quot;[http://www.post1.net/lowem/entry/google_plans_to_build_huge Google plans to build huge solar energy system for headquarters].&quot; ''[http://www.marketwatch.com/ MarketWatch].''

=== Easter eggs and April Fools' Day jokes ===
{{Main|List of Google's hoaxes and easter eggs}}

Google has a tradition of creating [[April Fools' Day]] jokes. For example, [[Google's hoaxes#2000|Google MentalPlex]] allegedly featured the use of mental power to search the web.&lt;ref name=&quot;mentalplex&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/mentalplex/ |title=Google MentalPlex |date=April 1, 2000 |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Google announced a free Internet service called [[TiSP]], or Toilet Internet Service Provider, where one obtained a connection by flushing one end of a [[optical fiber|fiber-optic]] cable down their toilet.&lt;ref name=&quot;TiSP&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/tisp/ |title=Welcome to Google TiSP |date=April 1, 2007 |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2007, Google's Gmail page displayed an announcement for [[Gmail Paper]], allowing users to have email messages printed and shipped to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;gmail_paper&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mail.google.com/mail/help/paper/more.html |title=Google Paper |date=April 1, 2000 |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2008 Google announced Gmail Custom time where users could change the time that the email was sent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://mail.google.com/mail/help/customtime/index.html |title=Gmail Custom Time: Google makes custom time |date=April 14, 2011 |work=Google |publisher=Google |accessdate=April 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010, Google jokingly changed its company name to Topeka in honor of [[Topeka, Kansas]], whose mayor actually changed the city's name to Google for a short amount of time in an attempt to sway Google's decision in its new [[Google Fiber|Google Fiber Project]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Google Blog: A Different Kind of Company Name&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/04/different-kind-of-company-name.html |title=A different kind of company name |last1=Schmidt |first1=Eric |date=April 1, 2010 |work=Official Google Blog |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/01/business/main6353136.shtml |title=April Fools: Google Changes Name to Topeka |date=April 1, 2010 |work=CBS News |publisher=CBS Interactive, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Google announced Gmail Motion, an interactive way of controlling Gmail and the computer with body movements via the user's webcam.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.gmanews.tv/story/216708/technology/googles-gmail-motion-launched-april-1 |title=Google's GMail Motion launched April&amp;nbsp;1 |date=April 1, 2011 |work=GMA News |publisher=GMA News }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to April Fools' Day jokes, Google's services contain a number of [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]]. For instance, Google included the [[Swedish Chef]]'s &quot;Bork bork bork,&quot; [[Pig Latin]], &quot;Hacker&quot; or [[leet]]speak, [[Elmer Fudd]], [[International Talk Like a Pirate Day|Pirate]], and [[Klingon language|Klingon]] as language selections for its search engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/language_tools |title=Language Tools |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the search engine calculator provides the [[Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything]] from [[Douglas Adams]]' ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/search?q=answer+to+life+the+universe+and+everything |title=Google Search Results for 'answer to life the universe and everything' |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, when searching the word &quot;recursion&quot;, the spell-checker's result for the properly spelled word is exactly the same word, creating a recursive link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/search?q=recursion |title=Google Search Results for 'recursion' |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, when searching for the word &quot;anagram,&quot; meaning a rearrangement of letters from one word to form other valid words, Google's suggestion feature displays &quot;Did you mean: nag a ram?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/search?q=anagram |title=anagram search |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=Sep 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Google Maps, searching for directions between places separated by large bodies of water, such as Los Angeles and Tokyo, results in instructions to &quot;kayak across the Pacific Ocean.&quot; During FIFA World Cup 2010, search queries like &quot;World Cup&quot;, &quot;FIFA&quot;, etc. caused the &quot;Goooo...gle&quot; page indicator at the bottom of every result page to read &quot;Goooo...al!&quot; instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://asia.cnet.com/crave/google-celebrates-world-cup-with-gooooooooooal-62111461.htm | title=Google celebrates World Cup with Gooooooooooal! | publisher=CNET Asia | date=June 9, 2010 | accessdate=May 18, 2011 | author=Chan, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typing in 'Do a barrel roll' in the search engine will make the page do a 360° rotation.

=== Philanthropy ===

In 2004, Google formed the not-for-profit philanthropic [[Google.org]], with a start-up fund of $1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;philanthropy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.org/about.html|title=About the Foundation |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the organization is to create awareness about [[climate change]], global public health, and global poverty. One of its first projects was to develop a viable [[plug-in hybrid]] [[electric vehicle]] that can attain 100 miles per gallon. Google hired [[Larry Brilliant|Dr. Larry Brilliant]] as the program's executive director in 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Hafner |first1=Katie |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/14/technology/14google.html |title=Philanthropy Google’s Way: Not the Usual |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 14, 2006 |accessdate=July 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the current director is Megan Smith.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Helft |first1=Miguel |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/24/technology/companies/24google.html |title=Philanthropy Google’s Way: Not the Usual |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 23, 2009 |accessdate=July 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 Google announced its &quot;project 10&lt;sup&gt;100&lt;/sup&gt;&quot; which accepted ideas for how to help the community and then allowed Google users to vote on their favorites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.project10tothe100.com/ |title=Project 10 to the 100th |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=July 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After two years of silence, during which many wondered what had happened to the program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/epicenter/2010/06/google-struggles-to-give-away-10-million/ |title=Google Struggles to Give Away $10&amp;nbsp;million |last1=Van Burskirk |first1=Elliot |date=June 28, 2010 |work=Wired  |accessdate=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google revealed the winners of the project, giving a total of ten million dollars to various ideas ranging from non-profit organizations that promote education to a website that intends to make all legal documents public and online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/09/10-million-for-project-10100-winners.html |title=$10&amp;nbsp;million for Project 10^100 winners |date=September 24, 2010 |last1=Twohill |first1=Lorraine |publisher=Google, Inc. |accessdate=September 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Google donated 1&amp;nbsp;million euros to [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] to support the next five annual International Mathematical Olympiads (2011–2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imo2011.nl/node/39 |title=Google donating 1&amp;nbsp;million euros to IMO |date=January 20, 2011 |accessdate=February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2012, Google launched a &quot;Legalize Love&quot; campaign in support of [[gay]] rights worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/07/08/google-launches-legalise-love-gay-rights-campaign/ Google launches ‘Legalise Love’ gay rights campaign] retrieved 5 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Network neutrality ===

Google is a noted supporter of [[network neutrality]]. According to Google's ''Guide to Net Neutrality'':

{{quote|Network neutrality is the principle that Internet users should be in control of what content they view and what applications they use on the Internet. The Internet has operated according to this neutrality principle since its earliest days... Fundamentally, net neutrality is about equal access to the Internet. In our view, the broadband carriers should not be permitted to use their market power to discriminate against competing applications or content. Just as telephone companies are not permitted to tell consumers who they can call or what they can say, broadband carriers should not be allowed to use their market power to control activity online.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/search/label/Net%20Neutrality |publisher=Google Public Policy Blog |title=Time to let the process unfold |date=October 22, 2009 |author=Richard Whitt |accessdate=December 20, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On February 7, 2006, [[Vint Cerf]], a co-inventor of the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP), and current Vice President and &quot;Chief Internet Evangelist&quot; at Google, in testimony before Congress, said, &quot;allowing broadband carriers to control what people see and do online would fundamentally undermine the principles that have made the Internet such a success.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cerf, Vinton|authorlink=Vint Cerf|title=The Testimony of Mr. Vinton Cerf, Vice President and Chief Internet Evangelist, Google|url=http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=1937&amp;wit_id=5416|accessdate=May 4, 2008|format=PDF|page=8|date=February 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
