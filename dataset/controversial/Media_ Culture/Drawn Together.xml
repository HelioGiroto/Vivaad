'''''Drawn Together''''' is &lt;!-- Please don't change &quot;is&quot; to &quot;was&quot;. Even if the show no longer produces new material, it does not mean the show no longer exists. --&gt; an [[United States|American]] [[animated television series]], which ran on [[Comedy Central]] from October 27, 2004 to November 14, 2007. The series was created by [[Dave Jeser]] and [[Matt Silverstein]], and uses a [[Situation comedy|sitcom]] format with a TV reality show setting. Like that of ''[[The Surreal Life]],'' the show's eight characters are a combination of personalities that were recognizable and familiar prior to the series. ''Drawn Together'', however, uses cartoon parodies of [[stock character]]s. In addition, their character traits parody personality types that are typically seen in reality TV shows.

The characters agreed to live in a house together in a setup similar to that of ''[[The Real World]]''{{vague|date=November 2011}}. Comedy Central advertised it as the first animated [[reality television|reality show]], and in some episodes, characters participate in challenges that are similar to reality TV challenges.

After three seasons the show was cancelled but still maintains a cult following. Subsequently, ''[[The Drawn Together Movie: The Movie!]]'' was released on April 20, 2010. 

==Cast and characters==
{{Main|List of Drawn Together characters}}
* [[Captain Hero|Captain Leslie Hero]] (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]): A [[sociopathic]], [[chauvinism|chauvinistic]], [[perversion|perverted]], [[antiheroic]], [[pansexual]], and [[lecherous]] parody of [[Superman]] and other [[superhero]]es, with a visual style taken from the cartoons of [[Bruce Timm]] and [[Max Fleischer]].  Being primarily macho, he is prone to occasional random fits of hysterics akin to [[Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder]], playing off the &quot;tragic origin&quot; stories of many superheroes.

* [[Princess Clara]] (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]): A [[wiktionary:pamper|pampered]], [[Religion|religious]], and [[bigoted]] princess who is a parody of [[Disney Princess|Disney princesses]] such as [[Ariel (The Little Mermaid)|Ariel]] from ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989) and [[Belle (Disney)|Belle]] from ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991).

* [[Wooldoor Sockbat|Wooldoor Jebediah Sockbat]] (voiced by [[James Arnold Taylor]]): A bizarre [[children's television series|children's show]] character in the mold of [[SpongeBob SquarePants (character)|SpongeBob SquarePants]] and [[Ren and Stimpy (characters)|Stimpy]] who displays many of the typical reality-defying behaviors of [[Looney Tunes]] characters.

* [[Foxxy Love]] (voiced by [[Cree Summer]]): A sharp-tongued [[ghetto]]-parody of [[Josie and the Pussycats (comic)#Valerie Brown|Valerie Brown]] from  Hanna-Barbera's ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'', she is a promiscuous mystery-solving musician. Her name is an amalgam of 1970s [[blaxploitation]] characters Foxy Brown and Christy Love.

* [[Toot Braunstein]] (voiced by [[Tara Strong]]): An overweight alcoholic [[retro]] colored sex symbol from the 1920s reminiscent of [[Betty Boop]].  Toot demands to be the center of attention, [[self-injury|cuts herself]] with razor blades and excessively eats when depressed, and often instigates conflict in the house.

* [[Ling-Ling]] (voiced by [[Abbey DiGregorio]]): A [[homicide |homicidal]] spoof of [[Pikachu]] from the ''[[Pokémon]]'' franchise, who battles using various supernatural powers/abilities (reminiscent of [[anime]]) and speaks in pseudo-Japanese gibberish (or &quot;Japorean&quot;, as Ling-Ling's voice Abbey DiGregorio calls it) with English subtitles.

* [[Xandir|Xandir P. Wifflebottom]] (voiced by [[Jack Plotnick]]): A [[hypersensitive]], [[homosexual]], [[wiktionary:overemotional|overemotional]], and [[effeminate]] parody of video game heroes like [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] from ''[[The Legend of Zelda (series)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' series with looks quite similar to that of Ren from &quot;[[The Pirates of Dark Water]]&quot;.  The princess he was trying to rescue strongly resembles [[Princess Zelda]] in her adult form.  Xandir also wears a protective shoulder plate similar to [[Cloud Strife]] of ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]''.

* [[Spanky Ham]] (voiced by [[Adam Carolla]]): based loosely on the Evil Piggies of the [http://www.KillFrog.com KillFrog.com] &quot;Little Susie Experiments&quot; and &quot;Evil Piggies Show,&quot; he is a sex-obsessed, [[Toilet humor|toilet humored]], obnoxious parody of many other internet [[Flash animation|Flash cartoon]] characters.

==Production==
===Animation style===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dthouse.jpg|right|thumbnail|The ''Drawn Together'' house.]] --&gt;
The show's visual style is that of [[traditional animation|traditional ink and paint animation]], which is actually a departure for Comedy Central, since they usually favor more specialized approaches to animation. The style was chosen both for the [[retro]] feel it gives the show and for the versatility it allows the animators, providing an environment in which it is possible to combine many different styles of animation. Another unique aspect of the show is that, where most cartoons present their characters, though animated, as real within the show's world, the ''Drawn Together'' characters retain their identities as cartoon characters even within their animated world, and acknowledge their status as animations. The show has [[cameo appearance]]s by famous characters (or in some cases, copyright-avoiding clones) from all across the animated spectrum.

In keeping with the various animation styles for the characters, Wooldoor and Toot have four fingers on each hand, whereas Clara, Foxxy, Hero, and Xandir have five. In promotional artwork for the show, Toot and Wooldoor are drawn with the standard five fingers, but in the show itself they have four.

Whereas most of the characters are drawn with black outlines, Clara and items belonging to her are drawn with soft edges, a reference to [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] animation techniques, which involve &quot;cleanup&quot; of any black outlines. Contrasting, Toot is drawn in the grainy, high-contrast monochrome of her era's technology.

The show was made by [[Rough Draft Studios]] in [[Glendale, California]], with much of the animation done at the studio's facilities in [[Korea]]. A gag in &quot;The Drawn Together Clip Show&quot; is that they show a list of all the Korean children who died animating the show.

The movie was produced by Six Point Harness, and done completely with Flash animation.

===Cancellation===
Comedy Central's original [[tagline]] for the show was &quot;Find out what happens when cartoon characters stop being polite… and start making out in hot tubs,&quot; referring to Clara and Foxxy's kiss in the [[Hot Tub (Drawn Together episode)|pilot episode]]. The line is a parody of ''The Real World''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s tagline, &quot;Find out what happens when people stop being polite… and start getting real.&quot; The aforementioned hot tub kiss is considered one of the show's defining images; Comedy Central based nearly all of its first-season promotional material for ''Drawn Together'' on it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scoobiedavis.blogspot.com/2004/12/exclusive-was-newsmaxs-hollywood-hero.html Scoobie Davis Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A total of three seasons have been produced and completed to date. Season 3 began airing on October 5, 2006, and took a mid-season break which started on November 15, 2006. The second half of season three began airing on October 4, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/press/press_releases/2007/091807_drawntogether_new_eps.jhtml |title=The Animated Housemates Are Back with All-New Episodes of ''Drawn Together'' on Comedy Central |date=September 18, 2007|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|accessdate=2009-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, it was announced that creators Dave Jeser and Matt Silverstein had left Comedy Central and signed a two-year contract with [[20th Century Fox Television]] to create new series and/or work on the studio's existing shows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7333 Breaking News - Development Update: Friday, March 23 | TheFutonCritic.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The season three finale included multiple jokes about the show's cancellation.  ''[[TV Guide]]'' listed this episode as a series finale and described the episode as follows: ''&quot;The series wraps up with the housemates participating in a singing competition as they look back on their recent misadventures.&quot;''

In March 2008, Tara Strong confirmed that the show had been cancelled,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ithacan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theithacan.org/blogs/bigspoon/2008/03/20/big-spoon-exclusive-tara-strong-powerpuff-girl-mermaid-potty-mouth/|title=Big Spoon Exclusive: Tara Strong - Powerpuff Girl, mermaid, potty mouth|date=March 20, 2008|publisher=[[The Ithacan#Media and publications|''The Ithacan'' online]]|accessdate=2009-11-16}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the back of the third season DVD's box refers to it as the &quot;third and final season&quot;.

Since cancellation, the show has partial rotation late-nights. Uncensored on Comedy Central's ''[[Secret Stash]]'' and the [[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]] [[Television channel|Channel]].

==Content==
''Drawn Together'' is an animated show that is adult-oriented and laden with [[black comedy]]. The humor is largely [[satire|satirical]] in nature, its primary focus being the mockery of [[stereotype]]s. Some episodes have heavy emphasis on [[homosexuality]] or [[bisexuality]], with some episodes (such as &quot;[[Gay Bash (Drawn Together episode)|Gay Bash]]&quot; or &quot;[[A Very Special Drawn Together Afterschool Special]]&quot;) solely devoted to these topics. [[Kink (sexual)|Kinky sex]] is a common topic of conversation; several of the characters have extremely perverse sexual tastes, and the show makes frequent reference to [[masturbation]], [[paraphilia]], and [[BDSM]]. Death and violence are also constant themes. Nearly all episodes feature at least one death, and several episodes feature characters going on [[spree killer|killing sprees]] or perpetrating [[Wiktionary:massacre|massacres]]; often they are horribly maimed as well. Even the main cast die with great frequency only to return alive and uninjured, often within the time frame of a single episode (a satire of how cartoon violence never has any negative consequences). The show breaks the [[fourth wall]] regularly. 

Despite show's overt and underlined obscenity, the characters' innocent and sensual sides are often the main driving force of the plot (alongside with comedic non-sequitur moments intended to parody standard plot lines). This adds romantic comedy, melodrama, action film, war film, court drama and other genres to the pool of spoofing material. Sincere feelings the characters are forced to experience (and comic disregard of thereof) seem to add integrity to the plot and imbue every episode with a genuine moral message, made more efficient by constant spoofing of moral message cliches like &quot;character X has learned a valuable lesson&quot;.

[[File:Drawn together(1).jpg|thumb|175px|right|The hot tub kiss as depicted in promotional posters.]]
The show's content is controversial, partially for its explicit [[dialogue (fiction)|dialogue]] and [[graphic violence]], but primarily for the casual attitude the show takes toward [[taboo]] subject matter. A great deal of the show's humor revolves around making light of difficult topics such as [[abortion]], [[rape]], [[incest]], [[pedophilia]], [[same-sex marriage|gay marriage]], [[spousal abuse]], [[racism]], [[homophobia]], [[antisemitism]], [[necrophilia]] and [[terrorism]]. The extensive use of stereotypes is another controversial aspect of the show, though the intent is actually to make fun of [[bigotry]]. As [[Jess Harnell]] states in the DVD commentary for &quot;Hot Tub&quot;, &quot;Most of the racism on the show is coming from people who are so obviously stupid about it; it really isn't that threatening.&quot; ([[Jew|Jewish people]] are mocked, including creators and principal cast member Tara Strong.)

Other content known to be featured on some episodes are occurrences of [[natural disasters]], depictions of [[authoritarian]] [[dictators]] and [[sexual fetish]]es.

Though the two shows are stylistically dissimilar, the coarseness of the humor in ''Drawn Together'' has led to frequent comparison with ''[[South Park]]'', the show that immediately precedes it on the network. ''South Park'' was thought to be extremely profane upon its premiere seven years earlier. By 2004, the preceding cartoon had dropped its [[television rating system|TV-MA]] warning bumper, and almost immediately following, a TV-MA warning was shown before episodes of ''Drawn Together''.

''Drawn Together'' is heavy with popular culture references. Animation is a major source of material; as mentioned above, many characters from comics and animated cartoons make cameo appearances and often are the subjects of [[parody]]. However, numerous live action films, TV shows, and video games are referenced as well. [[Reality television|Reality shows]] are another prime inspiration, not surprising given that ''Drawn Together'' is presented as a reality show that takes place in a cartoon world. However, although many of the first-season plots made extensive use of the reality show scenario, this aspect of the show has largely been de-emphasized in later episodes. The spoofing of film and television [[cliché]]s is another common theme on the show; many ''Drawn Together'' stories are parodies of overused plots from TV and movies.

Although the characters come from different cartoon worlds with different laws of nature and behavior (Princess Clara's fairy tale kingdom, Xandir's video game reality, Captain Hero's universe of super-heroics with set rules for hero/villain behavior), no explanation for how these worlds co-exist is given. All seem aware that they are in fact animated cartoons and that live action creatures exist.

Another hallmark of the show is its loose [[continuity (fiction)|continuity]]. Events in different episodes contradict each other, as there is a loose sense of [[canon (fiction)|canon]]. One such example is in &quot;[[The Other Cousin]]&quot;, in which Toot is pictured with a penis, but whether or not she actually has one is debatable. Another is Foxxy's various and contradictory stories about her son Timmy (one involves selling him on the black market, another involves her accidentally shooting him after believing him to be rabid, when he was really just brushing his teeth). Often plotlines exist that do not make any kind of internal sense, such as Foxxy, who is in her twenties, having a teenaged grandson. Some episodes even start with a fake recap of events supposed to have happened in a (non-existent) previous episode. According to Executive Producer Bill Freiberger, &quot;Very little on ''Drawn Together'' can be considered canon. If you try to find continuity on this show you'll drive yourself nuts. The only thing that's consistent is we try to make the show as funny as possible. And we'd never let a little thing like continuity get in the way of that.&quot;

Occasionally, episodes of ''Drawn Together'' are shown with less editing for content during ''Secret Stash'', a Comedy Central program aired on weekends at 1 A.M. that showcases movies, comedy specials, and animated programs with uncensored language. Though ''Secret Stash'' programs typically have the nudity still censored, ''Drawn Together'' is an exception to this. Some nudity not seen in the original broadcast is shown in the ''Secret Stash'' version, while the nudity in other scenes is censored with a caption reading &quot;DVD only&quot;; this is done as a way of promoting the show's DVD releases.

==Voice cast==
''Drawn Together'' features a cast of voice actors, which contains a mix of veteran voice actors ([[Tara Strong]], [[Cree Summer]], [[Jess Harnell]], and [[James Arnold Taylor]]) and newcomers to the field ([[Abbey DiGregorio]] and [[Jack Plotnick]]). Comedian [[Adam Carolla]] rounds out the cast.

Members of the show's voice cast collaborated with each other on other projects prior to ''Drawn Together''. Taylor (Wooldoor), Summer (Foxxy), and Strong (Clara and Toot) all performed in the [[Square Co.]]/[[Square Enix]]-developed video games ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]'' as [[Tidus]]/Shuyin, Lady Belgemine/Young Tidus/Lenne (speaking voice)/Calli, and Rikku, respectively. On a similar note, Taylor, Strong, and Jess Harnell all performed in the video game ''[[Kingdom Hearts II]]'' (also developed by Square Enix) as [[Captain Jack Sparrow]]/[[Timon and Pumbaa|Timon]], [[Rikku]], and [[Doctor Finklestein]]/Lock, respectively, while Taylor and Strong both performed in [[Mark Hamill]]'s ''[[Comic Book: The Movie]]'' and the [[Insomniac Games|Insomniac]]-developed [[Ratchet &amp; Clank]] video game franchise.

Tara Strong and Cree Summer worked together on other projects, most notably ''[[Rugrats]]'', ''[[All Grown Up!]]'', ''[[Danny Phantom]]'', ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]]'', ''[[Hello Kitty's Furry Tale Theater]]'', ''[[The Buzz on Maggie]]'' (which also features Jess Harnell), and ''[[Transformers Animated]]''. According to the DVD commentary for the episode &quot;Hot Tub&quot;, the two have known each other since childhood (both grew up in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]]).

Jess Harnell who voiced Captain Hero, voiced [[Wakko Warner]] in [[Animaniacs]]. Cree Summer also guest starred in one episode of Animaniacs as [[Elmyra Duff]] from [[Tiny Toon Adventures]].

Three of the show's voice actors had worked with creators Dave Jeser and Matt Silverstein on other projects: Jack Plotnick on ''[[Action (TV series)|Action]]'', and Adam Carolla and Abbey McBride on ''[[The Man Show]]''. Two of ''Drawn Together''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s guest stars also came from the casts of earlier Jeser/Silverstein projects: &quot;The Other Cousin&quot; guest star [[Sarah Silverman]] (from ''[[Greg the Bunny]]''), and Carolla's ''Man Show'' co-host [[Jimmy Kimmel]], who guest-starred in &quot;[[Xandir and Tim, Sitting in a Tree]]&quot; and &quot;[[Alzheimer's That Ends Well]]&quot;.

Originally, Xandir was to have been played by Nat Faxon, but he was fired following the first table read because the network felt his portrayal of the character was too stereotypically gay. Gay actor Jack Plotnick ended up being cast because he could play a gay man without resorting to stereotypical mannerisms such as the [[gay lisp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= &quot;A Very Special Drawn Together Afterschool Special&quot; DVD commentary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to their regular roles, the show's cast provides many of the minor roles and guest voices on the series, Summer, Strong, Harnell, and Taylor in particular. In the DVD commentary for &quot;Hot Tub&quot;, Tara Strong jokes that this is because the show does not have a lot of money to pay guest stars. [[Chris Edgerly]] appears in the majority of Season One and Two episodes despite not having a regular role on the series.

==Criticism and controversy==
Initial reception of the pilot episode, &quot;Hot Tub&quot;, was given mediocre reviews which focused mostly on its crudity. ''[[USA Today]]'' deemed ''Drawn Together'' &quot;the smutty offspring of ''[[The Real World|Real World]]'' and ''[[Super Friends|Superfriends]]'',&quot; stating that the pilot pushed the limits of taste, being overpowered by violence, sex, and disgusting subject matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ann |last=Oldenburg |title='Drawn': Animated raunch meets reality TV |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2004-10-26-drawn-together-main_x.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |date=October 26, 2004 |accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', &quot;Hot Tub&quot;, while it had many good sight gags, did not go far enough in parodying reality television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Virginia |last=Heffernan |authorlink=Virginia Heffernan |title=Cartoon Goal: Parody of Self-Parody |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/27/arts/television/27heff.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 27, 2004 |accessdate=17 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The domination of Clara's racism in the story was criticized as being a weak attempt to &quot;send up racism while still showcasing its cruel excitement.&quot; Toot's cutting was praised as a good parody of self-harm present on reality shows, but Spanky's flatulence was considered more disgusting than humorous.

Principal cast member Tara Strong has stated that she deeply loves the show, as it was such a departure from the family-friendly productions that she was used to working on at the time; the only problems that she had with it were a few jokes related to [[Anne Frank]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ithacan&quot; /&gt;

The first season of ''Drawn Together'' was released on DVD by [[Paramount Pictures#Paramount Home Entertainment|Paramount Home Entertainment]] on October 4, 2005. Its release was timed to coincide with the premiere of Season Two on television. The set includes all seven aired first season episodes. (By the time the release was finalized, it had been determined that the unaired &quot;[[Terms of Endearment (Drawn Together episode)|Terms of Endearment]]&quot; would air during Season Two, so it was left off the set and eventually released as part of the Season Two set). The profanity and nudity are intact and uncensored. Some shows also contain additional lines and scenes. Special features include audio commentary on select episodes by creators Dave Jeser and Matt Silverstein along with assorted cast and crew members, in addition to deleted scenes and [[karaoke]]/singalong versions of the show's songs.

The set has a game called the ''Censored/Uncensored'' game: A line is given, and the viewer must decide if the line aired on television as given (uncensored), or if it had to be altered significantly or deleted (censored). Some of the censored lines appear intact in the extended DVD version of the episode. Getting at least 11 of the 19 questions correct unlocks a hidden feature, a prank phone call by Jeser and Silverstein to their agent regarding the royalties they are to receive for the DVD audio commentaries.

The song &quot;[[(I've Had) The Time of My Life|Time of My Life]]&quot; from &quot;[[Dirty Pranking No. 2]]&quot; had to be left off the first season DVD because of copyright concerns. The show mocked the situation in the lyrics of the replacement music.

Season Two Uncensored was released on September 25, 2007. Like the Season One set, the set features audio commentaries by Jeser and Silverstein along with assorted cast and crew members, as well as karaoke/singalong versions of the show's songs. The set also contains, in the words of the box art, &quot;potentially annoying&quot; commentary on the commentary for &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;. The behind-the-scenes interviews in the set are the same ones that appear on Comedy Central's website, which feature each of the voice actors talking about his or her character, along with a separate interview with creators Jeser and Silverstein. Tara Strong does two separate interviews, one for each of her characters (Princess Clara and Toot Braunstein).

The set includes the controversial horse shot from &quot;Terms of Endearment&quot;, which was not allowed to air on television.

Season Three Uncensored was released on May 13, 2008.
