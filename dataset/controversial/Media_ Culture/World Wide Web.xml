The '''World Wide Web''' (abbreviated as '''WWW''' or '''W3''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/|title=World Wide Web Consortium|quote=The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)...}}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly known as '''the Web'''), is a [[information system|system]] of interlinked [[hypertext]] documents accessed via the [[Internet]]. With a [[web browser]], one can view [[web page]]s that may contain text, images, videos, and other [[multimedia]], and [[Web navigation|navigate]] between them via [[hyperlink]]s.

Using concepts from his earlier hypertext systems like [[ENQUIRE]], British engineer, [[computer science|computer scientist]] and at that time employee of CERN, [[Tim Berners-Lee|Sir Tim Berners-Lee]], now Director of the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), wrote a proposal in March 1989 for what would eventually become the World Wide Web.&lt;ref name=AHT&gt;{{cite news

==History==
{{Main|History of the World Wide Web}}
[[File:First Web Server.jpg|thumb|The [[NeXT Computer]] used by Berners-Lee. The handwritten label declares, &quot;This machine is a server. DO NOT POWER IT DOWN!!&quot;]]
In the May 1970 issue of ''Popular Science'' magazine, [[Arthur C. Clarke]] predicted that satellites would someday &quot;bring the accumulated knowledge of the world to your fingertips&quot; using a console that would combine the functionality of the Xerox, telephone, television and a small computer, allowing data transfer and video conferencing around the globe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=von Braun |first=Wernher|url=http://www.popsci.com/archive-viewer?id=8QAAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=66&amp;query=a+c+clarke |date = May 1970|title=TV Broadcast Satellite |magazine=Popular Science |accessdate=12 January 2011 |pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1989, [[Tim Berners-Lee]] wrote a proposal that referenced [[ENQUIRE]], a database and software project he had built in 1980, and described a more elaborate information management system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Berners-Lee |first=Tim |url=http://w3.org/History/1989/proposal.html |month=March |year=1989 |title=Information Management: A Proposal |publisher=W3C |accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With help from [[Robert Cailliau]], he published a more formal proposal (on 12 November 1990) to build a &quot;Hypertext project&quot; called &quot;WorldWideWeb&quot; (one word, also &quot;W3&quot;) as a &quot;web&quot; of &quot;hypertext documents&quot; to be viewed by &quot;[[Web browser|browsers]]&quot; using a [[client–server architecture]].&lt;ref name=W90/&gt; This proposal estimated that a read-only web would be developed within three months and that it would take six months to achieve &quot;the creation of new links and new material by readers, [so that] authorship becomes universal&quot; as well as &quot;the automatic notification of a reader when new material of interest to him/her has become available.&quot; While the read-only goal was met, accessible authorship of web content took longer to mature, with the [[wiki]] concept, blogs, [[Web 2.0]] and [[RSS]]/[[Atom (standard)|Atom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://info.cern.ch/NextBrowser.html|title=Tim Berners-Lee's original World Wide Web browser|quote=With recent phenomena like blogs and wikis, the web is beginning to develop the kind of collaborative nature that its inventor envisaged from the start.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal was modeled after the [[Dynatext]] [[SGML]] reader by Electronic Book Technology, a spin-off from the Institute for Research in Information and Scholarship at Brown University. The Dynatext system, licensed by CERN, was technically advanced and was a key player in the extension of SGML ISO 8879:1986 to Hypermedia within [[HyTime]], but it was considered too expensive and had an inappropriate licensing policy for use in the general high energy physics community, namely a fee for each document and each document alteration.

[[File:Cern datacenter.jpg|thumb|right|The CERN [[datacenter]] in 2010 housing some WWW servers]]

A [[NeXT Computer]] was used by Berners-Lee as the world's first [[web server]] and also to write the first [[web browser]], [[WorldWideWeb]], in 1990. By Christmas 1990, Berners-Lee had built all the tools necessary for a working Web:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb |title=Tim Berners-Lee: client |publisher=W3.org |accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[WorldWideWeb|first web browser]] (which was a web editor as well); the first web server; and the first web pages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/History/19921103-hypertext/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html |title=First Web pages |publisher=W3.org |accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which described the project itself. On 6 August 1991, he posted a short summary of the World Wide Web project on the &lt;tt&gt;alt.hypertext&lt;/tt&gt; [[newsgroup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/alt.hypertext/msg/395f282a67a1916c |title=Short summary of the World Wide Web project |publisher=Google |date=6 August 1991 |accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This date also marked the debut of the Web as a publicly available service on the Internet. Many newsmedia have reported that the first photo on the web was uploaded by Berners-Lee in 1992, an image of the CERN house band [[Les Horribles Cernettes]] taken by Silvano de Gennaro; Gennaro has disclaimed this story, writing that media were &quot;totally distorting our words for the sake of cheap sensationalism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Silvano de Gennaro disclaims 'the first photo on the web'|url=http://musiclub.web.cern.ch/MusiClub/bands/cernettes/disclaimer.html|quote=If you read well our website, it says that it was, to our knowledge, the 'first photo of a band'. Dozens of media are totally distorting our words for the sake of cheap sensationalism. Nobody knows which was the first photo on the web.|accessdate=27 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first server outside Europe was set up at the [[SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory|Stanford Linear Accelerator Center]] (SLAC) in Palo Alto, California, to host the [[SPIRES|SPIRES-HEP]] database. Accounts differ substantially as to the date of this event. The World Wide Web Consortium says December 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/2005/01/timelines/timeline-2500x998.png|title=W3C timeline|accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas SLAC itself claims 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slac.stanford.edu/spires/about/|title=About SPIRES|accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slac.stanford.edu/history/earlyweb/history.shtml|title=The Early World Wide Web at SLAC}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by a W3C document titled ''A Little History of the World Wide Web''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/History.html|title=A Little History of the World Wide Web}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crucial underlying concept of [[hypertext]] originated with older projects from the 1960s, such as the Hypertext Editing System (HES) at Brown University, [[Ted Nelson]]'s [[Project Xanadu]], and [[Douglas Engelbart]]'s [[NLS (computer system)|oN-Line System]] (NLS). Both Nelson and Engelbart were in turn inspired by [[Vannevar Bush]]'s [[microfilm]]-based &quot;[[memex]]&quot;, which was described in the 1945 essay &quot;[[As We May Think]]&quot;.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berners-Lee's breakthrough was to marry hypertext to the Internet. In his book ''[[Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web by its inventor|Weaving The Web]]'', he explains that he had repeatedly suggested that a marriage between the two technologies was possible to members of ''both'' technical communities, but when no one took up his invitation, he finally tackled the project himself. In the process, he developed three essential technologies:
# a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the Web and elsewhere, the Universal Document Identifier (UDI), later known as [[Uniform Resource Locator]] (URL) and [[Uniform Resource Identifier]] (URI);
# the publishing language [[Hypertext Markup Language|HyperText Markup Language]] (HTML);
# the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inventor of the Week Archive: The World Wide Web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/berners-lee.html|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]: MIT School of Engineering|accessdate=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Wide Web had a number of differences from other hypertext systems that were then available. The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones. This made it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource. It also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic problem of ''[[link rot]]''. Unlike predecessors such as [[HyperCard]], the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced  that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Welcome.html |title=Ten Years Public Domain for the Original Web Software |publisher=Tenyears-www.web.cern.ch |date=30 April 2003 |accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] protocol was no longer free to use, this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and towards the Web. An early popular web browser was [[ViolaWWW]] for [[Unix]] and the [[X Windowing System]].

Scholars generally agree that a turning point for the World Wide Web began with the introduction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livinginternet.com/w/wi_mosaic.htm |title=Mosaic Web Browser History&amp;nbsp;– NCSA, Marc Andreessen, Eric Bina |publisher=Livinginternet.com |accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] web browser&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://totic.org/nscp/demodoc/demo.html |title=NCSA Mosaic&amp;nbsp;– September 10, 1993 Demo |publisher=Totic.org |accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1993, a graphical browser developed by a team at the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] (NCSA-UIUC), led by [[Marc Andreessen]]. Funding for Mosaic came from the U.S. ''High-Performance Computing and Communications Initiative'' and the ''[[High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991]]'', one of [[Al Gore and information technology|several computing developments initiated by U.S. Senator Al Gore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cs.washington.edu/homes/lazowska/faculty.lecture/innovation/gore.html |title=Vice President Al Gore's ENIAC Anniversary Speech |publisher=Cs.washington.edu |date=14 February 1996 |accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the release of Mosaic, graphics were not commonly mixed with text in web pages and the Web's popularity was less than older protocols in use over the Internet, such as [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] and [[Wide Area Information Servers]] (WAIS). Mosaic's graphical user interface allowed the Web to become, by far, the most popular Internet protocol.

The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), which had pioneered the Internet; a year later, a second site was founded at [[INRIA]] (a French national computer research lab) with support from the [[European Commission]] DG InfSo; and in 1996, a third continental site was created in Japan at [[Keio University]]. By the end of 1994, while the total number of websites was still minute compared to present standards, quite a number of [[List of websites founded before 1995|notable websites]] were already active, many of which are the precursors or inspiration for today's most popular services.

Connected by the existing Internet, other websites were created around the world, adding international standards for [[domain name]]s and [[HTML]]. Since then, Berners-Lee has played an active role in guiding the development of web standards (such as the [[markup language]]s in which web pages are composed), and in recent years has advocated his vision of a [[Semantic Web]]. The World Wide Web enabled the spread of information over the Internet through an easy-to-use and flexible format. It thus played an important role in popularizing use of the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Internet |title=Internet legal definition of Internet |publisher=Free Online Law Dictionary |date=15 July 2009 |work=West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2 |accessdate=25 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the two terms are sometimes [[conflation|conflated]] in popular use, ''World Wide Web'' is not [[synonym]]ous with ''Internet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techterms.com/definition/www |title=WWW (World Wide Web) Definition |publisher=TechTerms
|accessdate= 19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Web is a collection of documents and both client and server software using Internet protocols such as [[TCP/IP]] and [[HTTP]].
Tim Berners-Lee was knighted in 2004 by Queen Elizabeth II for his contribution to the World Wide Web.

==Function==
The terms Internet and World Wide Web are often used in everyday speech without much distinction. However, the Internet and the World Wide Web are not one and the same. The Internet is a global system of interconnected [[computer networks]]. In contrast, the Web is one of the services that runs on the Internet. It is a collection of text documents and other resources, linked by hyperlinks and URLs, usually accessed by [[web browsers]] from [[web servers]]. In short, the Web can be thought of as an [[application software|application]] &quot;running&quot; on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The W3C Technology Stack|url=http://www.w3.org/Consortium/technology|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=21 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Viewing a [[web page]] on the World Wide Web normally begins either by typing the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] of the page into a [[web browser]] or by following a [[hyperlink]] to that page or resource. The web browser then initiates a series of communication messages, behind the scenes, in order to fetch and display it. As an example, consider accessing a page with the URL &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://example.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; .

First, the browser resolves the server-name portion of the URL (''example.org'') into an [[IP address|Internet Protocol address]] using the globally distributed database known as the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS); this lookup returns an IP address such as ''208.80.152.2''. The browser then requests the resource by sending an [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] request across the Internet to the computer at that particular address. It makes the request to a particular application port in the underlying [[Internet Protocol Suite]] so that the computer receiving the request can distinguish an HTTP request from other network protocols it may be servicing such as e-mail delivery; the HTTP protocol normally uses [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port 80]]. The content of the HTTP request can be as simple as the two lines of text
 GET ''/wiki/World_Wide_Web'' HTTP/1.1
 Host: ''example.org''

The computer receiving the HTTP request delivers it to [[web server]] software listening for requests on port 80. If the web server can fulfill the request it sends an HTTP response back to the browser indicating success, which can be as simple as
 HTTP/1.0 200 OK
 Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8
followed by the content of the requested page. The Hypertext Markup Language for a basic web page looks like
 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
&lt;title&gt;Example.org – The World Wide Web&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The World Wide Web, abbreviated as WWW and commonly known ...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;

The web browser [[parsing|parses]] the HTML, interpreting the markup (&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;title&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; for paragraph, and such) that surrounds the words in order to draw the text on the screen.

Many web pages use HTML to reference the URLs of other resources such as images, other embedded media, [[JavaScript|scripts]] that affect page behavior, and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] that affect page layout. The browser will make additional HTTP requests to the web server for these other [[Internet media type]]s. As it receives their content from the web server, the browser progressively [[Layout engine|renders]] the page onto the screen as specified by its HTML and these additional resources.

===Linking===
Most web pages contain [[hyperlinks]] to other related pages and perhaps to downloadable files, source documents, definitions and other web resources. In the underlying HTML, a hyperlink looks like
 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://example.org/wiki/Main_Page&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&quot;&gt;''Example.org, a free encyclopedia''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
[[File:WorldWideWebAroundWikipedia.png|thumb|Graphic representation of a minute fraction of the WWW, demonstrating [[hyperlink]]s]]
Such a collection of useful, related resources, interconnected via hypertext links is dubbed a ''web'' of information. Publication on the Internet created what [[Tim Berners-Lee]] first called the ''WorldWideWeb'' (in its original [[CamelCase]], which was subsequently discarded) in November 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;W90&quot;/&gt;

The hyperlink structure of the WWW is described by the [[webgraph]]: the nodes of the [[webgraph]] correspond to the web pages (or URLs) the directed edges between them to the [[hyperlink]]s.

Over time, many web resources pointed to by hyperlinks disappear, relocate, or are replaced with different content. This makes hyperlinks obsolete, a phenomenon referred to in some circles as [[link rot]] and the hyperlinks affected by it are often called [[dead link]]s. The ephemeral nature of the Web has prompted many efforts to archive web sites. The [[Internet Archive]], active since 1996, is one of the best-known efforts.

===Dynamic updates of web pages===
{{Main|Ajax (programming)}}
[[JavaScript]] is a [[Scripting programming language|scripting language]] that was initially developed in 1995 by [[Brendan Eich]], then of [[Netscape]], for use within web pages.&lt;ref name=Hamilton&gt;{{cite web|author=Hamilton, Naomi|title=The A-Z of Programming Languages: JavaScript|url=http://computerworld.com.au/article/255293/-z_programming_languages_javascript|date=31 July 2008|work=Computerworld|publisher=IDG|accessdate=12 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standardised version is [[ECMAScript]].&lt;ref name=Hamilton /&gt; To make web pages more interactive, some web applications also use JavaScript techniques such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] ([[Asynchronous I/O|asynchronous]] JavaScript and [[XML]]). [[Client-side scripting|Client-side script]] is delivered with the page that can make additional HTTP requests to the server, either in response to user actions such as mouse movements or clicks, or based on lapsed time. The server's responses are used to modify the current page rather than creating a new page with each response, so the server needs only to provide limited, incremental information. Multiple Ajax requests can be handled at the same time, and users can interact with the page while data is being retrieved. Web pages may also regularly [[polling (computer science)|poll]] the server to check whether new information is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WWW prefix===
&lt;!-- WWW prefix redirects here --&gt;
Many domain names used for the World Wide Web begin with ''www'' because of the long-standing practice of naming Internet hosts (servers) according to the services they provide. The [[hostname]] for a [[web server]] is often ''www'', in the same way that it may be ''ftp'' for an [[FTP server]], and ''news'' or ''nntp'' for a [[USENET]] [[news server]]. These host names appear as [[Domain Name System]] or [domain name server](DNS) [[subdomain]] names, as in &lt;tt&gt;www.example.com&lt;/tt&gt;. The use of 'www' as a subdomain name is not required by any technical or policy standard and many web sites do not use it; indeed, the first ever web server was called &lt;tt&gt;nxoc01.cern.ch&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html |title=Frequently asked questions by the Press | first = Tim | last = Berners-Lee |publisher=W3C | accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Paolo Palazzi,&lt;ref&gt;Palazzi, P (2011) [http://soft-shake.ch/2011/en/conference/sessions.html?key=earlydays 'The Early Days of the WWW at CERN']&lt;/ref&gt; who worked at CERN along with Tim Berners-Lee, the popular use of 'www' subdomain was accidental; the World Wide Web project page was intended to be published at www.cern.ch while info.cern.ch was intended to be the CERN home page, however the dns records were never switched, and the practice of prepending 'www' to an institution's website domain name was subsequently copied. Many established websites still use 'www', or they invent other subdomain names such as 'www2', 'secure', etc. Many such web servers are set up so that both the domain root (e.g., example.com) and the ''www'' subdomain (e.g., www.example.com) refer to the same site; others require one form or the other, or they may map to different web sites.

The use of a subdomain name is useful for [[Load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] incoming web traffic by creating a [[CNAME record]] that points to a cluster of web servers. Since, currently, only a subdomain can be used in a CNAME, the same result cannot be achieved by using the bare domain root.

When a user submits an incomplete domain name to a web browser in its address bar input field, some web browsers automatically try adding the prefix &quot;www&quot; to the beginning of it and possibly &quot;.com&quot;, &quot;.org&quot; and &quot;.net&quot; at the end, depending on what might be missing. For example, entering '{{not a typo|microsoft}}' may be transformed to ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' and 'openoffice' to ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.openoffice.org&lt;/nowiki&gt;''. This feature started appearing in early versions of Mozilla [[Firefox]], when it still had the working title 'Firebird' in early 2003, from an earlier practice in browsers such as [[Lynx (web browser)|Lynx]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In English, [[Pronunciation of &quot;www&quot;|''www'' is usually read as]] ''double-u double-u double-u''. Some users pronounce it ''dub-dub-dub'', particularly in New Zealand. Stephen Fry, in his &quot;Podgrammes&quot; series of podcasts, pronouncing it ''wuh wuh wuh''. The English writer [[Douglas Adams]] once quipped in [[The Independent|The Independent on Sunday]] (1999): &quot;The World Wide Web is the only thing I know of whose shortened form takes three times longer to say than what it's short for&quot;. In Mandarin Chinese, ''World Wide Web'' is commonly translated via a [[phono-semantic matching]] to ''wàn wéi wǎng'' ({{lang|zh|[[wikt:万维网|万维网]]}}), which satisfies ''www'' and literally means &quot;myriad dimensional net&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=translate&amp;trst=0&amp;trqs=World+Wide+Web&amp;trlang=&amp;wddmtm=0 |title=MDBG Chinese-English dictionary&amp;nbsp;– Translate |accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; a translation that very appropriately reflects the design concept and proliferation of the World Wide Web. Tim Berners-Lee's web-space states that ''World Wide Web'' is officially spelled as three separate words, each capitalised, with no intervening hyphens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html |title=Frequently asked questions by the Press&amp;nbsp;– Tim BL |publisher=W3.org |accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of the www prefix is declining as [[Web 2.0]] [[web application]]s seek to brand their domain names and make them easily pronounceable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6421/is_4_92/ai_n56479358/|title=It's not your grandfather's Internet | work=Strategic Finance | year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the [[mobile web]] grows in popularity, services like [[Google Mail|Gmail]].com, MySpace.com, Facebook.com, [[Bebo]].com and Twitter.com are most often discussed without adding www to the domain (or, indeed, the .com).

===Scheme specifiers: http and https===
The scheme specifier ''&lt;nowiki&gt;http://&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' or ''&lt;nowiki&gt;https://&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' at the start of a Web [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]] refers to [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] or [[HTTP Secure]] respectively. Unlike ''www'', which has no specific purpose, these specify the communication protocol to be used for the request and response. The HTTP protocol is fundamental to the operation of the World Wide Web and the added encryption layer in HTTPS is essential when confidential information such as passwords or banking information are to be exchanged over the public Internet. Web browsers usually prepend &lt;nowiki&gt;http://&lt;/nowiki&gt; to addresses too, if omitted.

==Web servers==
{{Main|Web server}}

The primary function of a web server is to deliver web pages on the request to clients. This means delivery of HTML documents and any additional content that may be included by a document, such as images, style sheets and scripts.

==Privacy==
{{main|Internet privacy}}
Every time a web page is requested from a web server the server can identify, and usually it logs, the IP address from which the request arrived.  Equally, unless set not to do so, most web browsers record the web pages that have been requested and viewed in a ''history'' feature, and usually [[Web cache|cache]] much of the content locally. Unless HTTPS encryption is used, web requests and responses travel in plain text across the internet and they can be viewed, recorded and cached by intermediate systems.

When a web page asks for, and the user supplies, [[personally identifiable information]] such as their real name, address, e-mail address, etc., then a connection can be made between the current web traffic and that individual. If the website uses [[HTTP cookie]]s, username and password authentication, or other tracking techniques, then it will be able to relate other web visits, before and after, to the identifiable information provided. In this way it is possible for a web-based organisation to develop and build a profile of the individual people who use its site or sites. It may be able to build a record for an individual that includes information about their leisure activities, their shopping interests, their profession, and other aspects of their [[demographic profile]]. These profiles are obviously of potential interest to marketeers, advertisers and others. Depending on the website's [[terms and conditions]] and the local laws that apply information from these profiles may be sold, shared, or passed to other organisations without the user being informed. For many ordinary people, this means little more than some unexpected e-mails in their in-box, or some uncannily relevant advertising on a future web page. For others, it can mean that time spent indulging an unusual interest can result in a deluge of further targeted marketing that may be unwelcome. Law enforcement, counter terrorism and espionage agencies can also identify, target and track individuals based on what appear to be their interests or proclivities on the web.

[[Social networking]] sites make a point of trying to get the user to truthfully expose their real names, interests and locations. This makes the social networking experience more realistic and therefore engaging for all their users. On the other hand, photographs uploaded and unguarded statements made will be identified to the individual, who may regret some decisions to publish these data. Employers, schools, parents and other relatives may be influenced by aspects of social networking profiles that the posting individual did not intend for these audiences. [[Cyberbullying|On-line bullies]] may make use of personal information to harass or [[Cyberstalking|stalk]] users.  Modern social networking websites allow fine grained control of the privacy settings for each individual posting, but these can be complex and not easy to find or use, especially for beginners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=boyd|first=danah|coauthors=Hargittai, Eszter|title=Facebook privacy settings: Who cares?|journal=First Monday|year=2010|month=July|volume=15|issue=8|url=http://www.uic.edu/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/3086/2589|publisher=University of Illinois at Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photographs and videos posted onto websites have caused particular problems, as they can add a person's face to an on-line profile. With modern and potential [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition technology]], it may then be possible to relate that face with other, previously anonymous, images, events and scenarios that have been imaged elsewhere. Because of image caching, mirroring and straightforward copying, it is difficult to imagine that an image, once published onto the World Wide Web, can ever actually or totally be removed.

==Intellectual property==
{{main|Intellectual property}}
The intellectual property rights for any creative work initially rests with its creator. Web users who want to publish their work onto the World Wide Web, however, need to be aware of the details of the way they do it. If artwork, photographs, writings, poems, or technical innovations are published by their creator onto a privately owned web server, then they may choose the [[copyright]] and other conditions freely themselves. This is unusual though; more commonly work is uploaded to web sites and servers that are owned by other organizations. It depends upon the terms and conditions of the site or service provider to what extent the original owner automatically signs over rights to their work by the choice of destination and by the act of uploading.

Many users of the web erroneously assume that everything they may find on line is freely available to them as if it was in the [[public domain]]. This is almost never the case, unless the web site publishing the work clearly states that it is. On the other hand, content owners are aware of this widespread belief, and expect that sooner or later almost everything that is published will probably be used in some capacity somewhere without their permission. Many publishers therefore embed visible or invisible [[Digital watermarking|digital watermarks]] in their media files, sometimes charging users to receive unmarked copies for legitimate use. [[Digital rights management]] includes forms of access control technology that further limit the use of digital content even after it has been bought or downloaded.

==Security==
The Web has become criminals' preferred pathway for spreading [[malware]]. Cybercrime carried out on the Web can include [[identity theft]], fraud, espionage and [[intelligence gathering]].&lt;ref name=Ben-Itzhak /&gt; Web-based [[vulnerability (computing)|vulnerabilities]] now outnumber traditional computer security concerns,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christey, Steve and Martin, Robert A.|title=Vulnerability Type Distributions in CVE (version 1.1)|url=http://cwe.mitre.org/documents/vuln-trends/index.html|date=22 May 2007|publisher=[[MITRE Corporation]]|accessdate=7 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Symantec Internet Security Threat Report: Trends for July–December 2007 (Executive Summary)|publisher=Symantec Corp.|volume=XIII|pages=1–2|date=April 2008|url=http://eval.symantec.com/mktginfo/enterprise/white_papers/b-whitepaper_exec_summary_internet_security_threat_report_xiii_04-2008.en-us.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=11 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as measured by [[Google]], about one in ten web pages may contain malicious code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Google searches web's dark side|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/6645895.stm|date=11 May 2007|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Web-based [[attack (computing)|attacks]] take place on legitimate websites, and most, as measured by [[Sophos]], are hosted in the United States, China and Russia.&lt;ref name=Sophos-Q1-2008&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Threat Report|url=http://www.sophos.com/sophos/docs/eng/marketing_material/sophos-threat-report-Q108.pdf|format=PDF|date=Q1 2008|publisher=Sophos|accessdate=24 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most common of all malware [[Threat (computer)|threats]] is [[SQL injection]] attacks against websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Security threat report|url=http://www.sophos.com/sophos/docs/eng/papers/sophos-security-report-jul08-srna.pdf|format=PDF|date=July 2008|publisher=Sophos|accessdate=24 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through HTML and URIs the Web was vulnerable to attacks like [[cross-site scripting]] (XSS) that came with the introduction of JavaScript&lt;ref name=FGHR&gt;{{Cite book|author=Fogie, Seth, Jeremiah Grossman, Robert Hansen, and Anton Rager|title=Cross Site Scripting Attacks: XSS Exploits and Defense|pages=68–69, 127|publisher=Syngress, Elsevier Science &amp; Technology|url=http://www.syngress.com/book_catalog//SAMPLE_1597491543.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080625065121/http://www.syngress.com/book_catalog//SAMPLE_1597491543.pdf|archivedate=25 June 2008|format=PDF|year=2007|isbn=1-59749-154-3|accessdate=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were exacerbated to some degree by Web 2.0 and Ajax [[web design]] that favors the use of scripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=O'Reilly, Tim|title=What Is Web 2.0|url=http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/oreilly/tim/news/2005/09/30/what-is-web-20.html|pages=4–5|date=30 September 2005|publisher=O'Reilly Media|accessdate=4 June 2008}} and AJAX web applications can introduce security vulnerabilities like &quot;client-side security controls, increased attack surfaces, and new possibilities for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)&quot;, in {{Cite journal|author=Ritchie, Paul|title=The security risks of AJAX/web 2.0 applications|url=http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/research/Sep07_Ajax.pdf|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080625065122/http://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/research/Sep07_Ajax.pdf|archivedate=25 June 2008|format=PDF|date=March 2007|journal=Infosecurity|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=6 June 2008}} which cites {{Cite news|author=Hayre, Jaswinder S. and Kelath, Jayasankar|title=Ajax Security Basics|url=http://www.securityfocus.com/infocus/1868|publisher=SecurityFocus|date=22 June 2006|accessdate=6 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today by one estimate, 70% of all websites are open to XSS attacks on their users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Berinato, Scott|title=Software Vulnerability Disclosure: The Chilling Effect|url=http://www.csoonline.com/article/221113|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080418072230/http://www.csoonline.com/article/221113|archivedate=18 April 2008|work=CSO|page=7|publisher=CXO Media|date=1 January 2007|accessdate=7 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Standards==
{{Main|Web standards}}

Many formal standards and other technical specifications and software define the operation of different aspects of the World Wide Web, the Internet, and computer information exchange. Many of the documents are the work of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), headed by Berners-Lee, but some are produced by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) and other organizations.

Usually, when web standards are discussed, the following publications are seen as foundational:
* Recommendations for [[markup languages]], especially [[HTML]] and [[XHTML]], from the W3C. These define the structure and interpretation of [[hypertext]] documents.
* Recommendations for [[style sheet (web development)|stylesheets]], especially [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]], from the W3C.
* Standards for [[ECMAScript]] (usually in the form of [[JavaScript]]), from [[Ecma International]].
* Recommendations for the [[Document Object Model]], from W3C.

Additional publications provide definitions of other essential technologies for the World Wide Web, including, but not limited to, the following:
* ''Uniform Resource Identifier'' ([[Uniform Resource Identifier|URI]]), which is a universal system for referencing resources on the Internet, such as hypertext documents and images. URIs, often called URLs, are defined by the IETF's RFC 3986 / STD 66: ''Uniform Resource Identifier (URI): Generic Syntax'', as well as its predecessors and numerous [[URI scheme]]-defining [[Request For Comments|RFCs]];
* ''HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)'', especially as defined by RFC 2616: ''HTTP/1.1'' and RFC 2617: ''HTTP Authentication'', which specify how the browser and server authenticate each other.

==Accessibility==
{{Main|Web accessibility}}

There are methods available for accessing the web in alternative mediums and formats, so as to enable use by individuals with disabilities. These disabilities may be visual, auditory, physical, speech related, cognitive, neurological, or some combination therin. Accessibility features also help others with temporary disabilities like a broken arm or the aging population as their abilities change.&lt;ref name=WAI&gt;{{cite web|title=Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)|url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/l|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=7 April 2009}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Web is used for receiving information as well as providing information and interacting with society. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] claims it essential that the Web be accessible in order to provide equal access and [[equal opportunity]] to people with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization: Overview|url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/Overview|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=7 April 2009}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tim Berners-Lee once noted, &quot;The power of the Web is in its universality. Access by everyone regardless of disability is an essential aspect.&quot;&lt;ref name=WAI /&gt; Many countries regulate [[web accessibility]] as a requirement for websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal and Policy Factors in Developing a Web Accessibility Business Case for Your Organization|url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/bcase/pol|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; International cooperation in the W3C [[Web Accessibility Initiative]] led to simple guidelines that web content authors as well as software developers can use to make the Web accessible to persons who may or may not be using [[assistive technology]].&lt;ref name=WAI /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview|url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/wcag.php|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=7 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Internationalization==
The W3C [[Internationalization and localization|Internationalization]] Activity assures that web technology will work in all languages, scripts, and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internationalization (I18n) Activity|url=http://www.w3.org/International/|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 2004 or 2005, [[Unicode]] gained ground and eventually in December 2007 surpassed both [[ASCII]] and Western European as the Web's most frequently used [[character encoding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Davis, Mark|title=Moving to Unicode 5.1|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/05/moving-to-unicode-51.html|date=5 April 2008|publisher=Google|accessdate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally RFC 3986 allowed resources to be identified by [[URI]] in a subset of US-ASCII. RFC 3987 allows more characters—any character in the [[Universal Character Set]]—and now a resource can be identified by [[Internationalized Resource Identifier|IRI]] in any language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=World Wide Web Consortium Supports the IETF URI Standard and IRI Proposed Standard|url=http://www.w3.org/2004/11/uri-iri-pressrelease.html|date=26 January 2005|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
Between 2005 and 2010, the number of Web users doubled, and was expected to surpass two billion in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2010/10/19/us-telecoms-internet-idUSTRE69I24720101019 |title=Internet users to exceed 2 billion ... |publisher=Reuters |date=19 October 2010 |accessdate=9 February 2011 |first=Jonathan |last=Lynn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early studies in 1998 and 1999 estimating the size of the web using capture/recapture methods showed that much of the web was not indexed by search engines and the web was much larger than expected.&lt;ref&gt;S.

Giles, &quot;Accessibility of Information on the Web,&quot; Nature, 400, 107–109, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to a 2001 study, there were a massive number, over 550 billion, of documents on the Web, mostly in the invisible Web, or [[Deep Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brightplanet.com/resources/details/deepweb.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080404044203/http://www.brightplanet.com/resources/details/deepweb.html|archivedate=4 April 2008 |title=The 'Deep' Web: Surfacing Hidden Value |publisher=Brightplanet.com |accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 survey of 2,024 million Web pages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netz-tipp.de/languages.html |title=Distribution of languages on the Internet |publisher=Netz-tipp.de |accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; determined that by far the most Web content was in English: 56.4%; next were pages in German (7.7%), French (5.6%), and Japanese (4.9%). A more recent study, which used Web searches in 75 different languages to sample the Web, determined that there were over 11.5 billion Web pages in the [[Surface Web|publicly indexable Web]] as of the end of January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alessio Signorini |url=http://www.cs.uiowa.edu/~asignori/web-size/ |title=Indexable Web Size |publisher=Cs.uiowa.edu |accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2009|3}}, the indexable web contains at least 25.21 billion pages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwidewebsize.com/ |title=The size of the World Wide Web |publisher=Worldwidewebsize.com |accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 July 2008, Google software engineers Jesse Alpert and Nissan Hajaj announced that [[Google Search]] had discovered one trillion unique URLs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2008/07/we-knew-web-was-big.html |title=We knew the web was big... |last=Alpert |first=Jesse |coauthors=Hajaj, Nissan |date=25 July 2008 |work=The Official Google Blog }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2009|5}}, over 109.5 million domains operated.&lt;ref name=NI&gt;{{cite web|title=Domain Counts &amp; Internet Statistics|url=http://www.domaintools.com/internet-statistics/|publisher=Name Intelligence|accessdate=17 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{failed verification|date=November 2011}} Of these 74% were commercial or other sites operating in the &lt;code&gt;.com&lt;/code&gt; [[generic top-level domain]].&lt;ref name=NI /&gt;

Statistics measuring a website's popularity are usually based either on the number of [[page view]]s or on associated server '[[Hit (internet)|hits]]' (file requests) that it receives.

==Speed issues==
Frustration over [[Network congestion|congestion]] issues in the Internet infrastructure and the high [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] that results in slow browsing has led to a pejorative name for the World Wide Web: the ''World Wide Wait''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Wide Wait|url=http://www.techweb.com/encyclopedia/defineterm.jhtml?term=world+wide+wait|work=TechEncyclopedia|publisher=United Business Media|accessdate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speeding up the Internet is an ongoing discussion over the use of [[peering]] and [[Quality of service|QoS]] technologies. Other solutions to reduce the congestion can be found at [[W3C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Khare, Rohit and Jacobs, Ian|title=W3C Recommendations Reduce 'World Wide Wait'|url=http://www.w3.org/Protocols/NL-PerfNote.html|year=1999|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guideline]]s for Web response times are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nielsen, Jakob (from Miller 1968; Card et al. 1991)|title=Usability Engineering: Response Times: The Three Important Limits|chapter=5|url=http://www.useit.com/papers/responsetime.html|year=1994|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|accessdate=10 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 0.1 second (one tenth of a second). Ideal response time. The user does not sense any interruption.
* 1 second. Highest acceptable response time. Download times above 1 second interrupt the user experience.
* 10 seconds. Unacceptable response time. The user experience is interrupted and the user is likely to leave the site or system.

==Caching==
{{main|Web cache}}
If a user revisits a Web page after only a short interval, the page data may not need to be re-obtained from the source Web server. Almost all web browsers [[browser cache|cache]] recently obtained data, usually on the local hard drive. HTTP requests sent by a browser will usually ask only for data that has changed since the last download. If the locally cached data are still current, they will be reused. Caching helps reduce the amount of Web traffic on the Internet. The decision about expiration is made independently for each downloaded file, whether image, [[Cascading Style Sheets|stylesheet]], [[JavaScript]], HTML, or other [[Resource (Web)|resource]]. Thus even on sites with highly dynamic content, many of the basic resources need to be refreshed only occasionally. Web site designers find it worthwhile to collate resources such as CSS data and JavaScript into a few site-wide files so that they can be cached efficiently. This helps reduce page download times and lowers demands on the Web server.

There are other components of the Internet that can cache Web content. Corporate and academic [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]] often cache Web resources requested by one user for the benefit of all. (See also [[Web proxy#Caching proxy servers|caching proxy server]].) Some [[search engines]] also store cached content from websites. Apart from the facilities built into Web servers that can determine when files have been updated and so need to be re-sent, designers of dynamically generated Web pages can control the HTTP headers sent back to requesting users, so that transient or sensitive pages are not cached. [[Online banking|Internet banking]] and news sites frequently use this facility. Data requested with an [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] 'GET' is likely to be cached if other conditions are met; data obtained in response to a 'POST' is assumed to depend on the data that was POSTed and so is not cached.
