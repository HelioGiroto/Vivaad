==History==
{{Main|History of Fox News}}

===Early years===
In May 1985, Australian publisher Rupert Murdoch announced that he and American [[Business magnate|industrialist]] and [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]] [[Marvin Davis]] intended to develop &quot;a network of independent stations as a fourth marketing force&quot; to compete directly with [[CBS]], [[NBC]], and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] through the purchase of six television stations owned by [[Metromedia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lenzner, Robert. (May 5, 1985) Boston Globe ''[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=BG&amp;p_theme=bg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EADEAE8781FD7AD&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM Murdoch, partner plan 4th network.]'' Section: National/Foreign; Page 1 (the six stations cover many of the nation's major markets—New York, Chicago, Los Angeles, Dallas, Houston and Washington)&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1985 [[20th Century Fox]] announced that Murdoch had completed his purchase of 50 percent of [[Fox Filmed Entertainment]], parent company of 20th Century Fox Film Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times (July 11, 1985) ''[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E5D81738F932A25754C0A963948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon= $55.9 Million Fox Film Loss.]'' Section: D; Page D19.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later 20th Century Fox earned $5.6&amp;nbsp;million in its fiscal third period ended May 31, 1986, in contrast to a loss of $55.8&amp;nbsp;million in the third period of the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chicago Tribune]] (July 17, 1986) ''[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/24921105.html?dids=24921105:24921105&amp;FMT=CITE&amp;FMTS=CITE:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+17%2C+1986&amp;author=&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1&amp;desc=TURNAROUND+FOR+FOX+FILM Turnaround for Fox Film]'' Section: Business; Page 1. {{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to founding FNC, Murdoch had gained experience in the 24-hour news business when News Corp.'s [[BSkyB]] subsidiary began Europe's first 24-hour news channel ([[Sky News]]) in the United Kingdom in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Saeed.

In February 1996, after former U.S. Republican Party political strategist and NBC executive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E4DE1F3FF934A35753C1A960958260&amp;n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/People/A/Ailes,%20Roger%20E.|title=At the new Fox News Channel, the buzzword is fairness, separating news from bias| work=The New York Times|first=Lawrie|last=Mifflin|date=October 7, 1996|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ailes]] left cable-television channel [[America's Talking]] (now [[MSNBC]]), Murdoch asked him to start Fox News Channel. Ailes demanded five months of 14-hour workdays and several weeks of rehearsal shows{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} before its launch on October 7, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newscorp.com/management/foxnewschannel.html|title=News Corporation: Fox News Channel|accessdate=2008-04-21|date=2008-04-18|publisher=News Corporation|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRTzXbU5|archivedate=2010-11-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its debut 10 million households were able to watch FNC; however, it was absent from the media markets of New York City and Los Angeles. According to published reports, many media reviewers had to watch the first day's programming at Fox News studios because it was not readily available via cable.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Rolling news coverage during the day consisted of 20-minute single-topic shows such as ''Fox on Crime'' or ''Fox on Politics'', surrounded by news headlines. Interviews featured facts at the bottom of the screen about the topic or the guest. The flagship newscast at the time was ''The Schneider Report'', with [[Mike Schneider (news anchor)|Mike Schneider]]'s fast-paced delivery of the news. During the evening, Fox featured opinion shows: ''The O'Reilly Report'' (now ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''), ''The Crier Report'' (hosted by [[Catherine Crier]]) and ''[[Hannity &amp; Colmes]]''.

From the beginning, FNC has placed heavy emphasis on visual presentation. Graphics were designed to be colorful and attention-getting; this helped the viewer to grasp the main points of what was being said, even if they could not hear the host (with on-screen text summarizing the position of the interviewer or speaker, and &quot;bullet points&quot; when a host was delivering commentary). Fox News also created the &quot;Fox News Alert,&quot; which interrupted its regular programming when a breaking-news story occurred. 

To accelerate its adoption by cable companies, Fox News paid systems up to $11 per subscriber to distribute the channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-18396534/bold-grab-subs-murdoch.html|author=Richard Katz|date=1996-05|title=Bold grab for subs: Murdoch offers $11 to carry Fox News|publisher=Multichannel News| accessdate=September 1, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRU0fPQa|archivedate=2010-11-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasted with the normal practice, in which cable operators paid stations carriage fees for programming. When [[Time Warner]] bought [[Ted Turner]]'s [[Turner Broadcasting]], a federal [[antitrust]] [[consent decree]] required Time Warner to carry a second all-news channel in addition to its own [[CNN]]. Time Warner selected MSNBC as the secondary news channel, not Fox News. Fox News claimed that this violated an agreement (to carry Fox News). Citing its agreement to keep its U.S. headquarters and a large studio in New York City, News Corporation enlisted the help of Mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]]'s administration to pressure Time Warner (one of the city's two cable providers) to transmit Fox News on a city-owned channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9504E3DA123FF937A35753C1A960958260|title=Giuliani Pressures Time Warner to Transmit a Fox Channel| work=The New York Times|first=Mark|last=Landler|date=October 4, 1996|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; City officials threatened to take action affecting Time Warner's cable franchises in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E07E7DB103FF936A35753C1A960958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=City Hall Threatens Action if Time Warner Rejects Channel|work=The New York Times|first=Clifford J.|last=Levy|date=October 5, 1996|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lawsuit was filed by Time Warner against the City of New York, claiming undue interference with (and inappropriate use of) the city's educational channels for commercial programming. News Corporation countered with an antitrust lawsuit against Time Warner for unfairly protecting CNN. This led to an acrimonious battle between Murdoch and Turner, with Turner publicly comparing Murdoch to [[Adolf Hitler]]; Murdoch's ''[[New York Post]]'' ran an editorial questioning Turner's sanity. Giuliani's motives were also questioned, since his wife was a producer at Murdoch-owned [[WNYW-TV]]. In the end, Time Warner and News Corporation signed a [[settlement (law)|settlement]] agreement permitting Fox News to be carried on New York City cable systems beginning in October 1997, and on all Time Warner cable systems by 2001 (although Time Warner still does not carry Fox News in all areas).{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

During the [[September 11th attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]], Fox News was the first news organization to run a [[news ticker]] on the bottom of the screen to keep up with the flow of information that day. The ticker has remained, informing viewers about additional news which reporters may not mention onscreen and repeating news mentioned during a broadcast; it has proven popular with viewers.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Fox News Ticker&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mandatory.com/2012/09/11/11-direct-effects-9-11-had-on-the-sports-and-entertainment-indus/#photo=2|title=11 Direct Effects 9/11 Had on the Sports and Entertainment Industries|last=Dudak|first=Gary|date=September 11, 2012|publisher=Mandatory.com|accessdate=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the growth of FNC, the company introduced a radio division ([[Fox News Radio]]) in 2003. [[Syndicated radio show|Syndicated]] throughout the United States, the division provides short newscasts and talk radio programs featuring personalities from the television and radio divisions. In 2006 the company also introduced [[Fox News Talk]], a [[satellite radio]] station featuring programs syndicated by (and featuring) Fox News personalities.

===Online===
Introduced in December 1995,{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} the Fox News website features the latest coverage (including columns by FNC television, radio and online personalities). Video clips are also available on Foxnews.com and Foxbusiness.com. Fox News does not dominate its biggest rivals (CNN and MSNBC) online, as it does on television; at the end of August 2010 Foxnews.com averaged an estimated 24 million unique visitors per month, versus 47 million for MSNBC.com and 48 million for CNN.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebizmba.com/articles/news-websites 15 Most Popular News Websites] ''ebizMBA'' (derived from Alexa Internet, Quantcast, and Compete.com data) 1 September 2010 ''Retrieved: 8 September 2010'' See also: [http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2010/online_nielsen.php Top 20 Websites in 2009]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008 FNC joined other channels in introducing a live streaming segment to its website: ''The Strategy Room,'' designed to appeal to older viewers. It airs weekdays from 9&amp;nbsp;a.m. to 5&amp;nbsp;p.m. and takes the form of an informal discussion, with running commentary on the news. Regular discussion programs include ''Business Hour'', ''News With a View'' and ''God Talk''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/16/business/media/16fox.html &quot;For Talking Heads, a Spot to Relax and Sip Coffee, on Webcam &quot;] ''The New York Times''.

==Ratings and reception==
[[File:Fox News Channel's Hannity and Colmes production area.jpg|thumb|left|FNC's ''[[Hannity]]'' production area|alt=Newsroom, with political signs on the wall]]
FNC saw a large ratings jump during the early stages of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq conflict]]. According to some reports, at the height of the conflict Fox News had as much as a 300-percent increase in viewership (averaging 3.3&amp;nbsp;million viewers daily).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3148015.stm|title=War coverage lifts News Corp|publisher=[[The British Broadcasting Corporation]]|accessdate=November 29, 2005|date=August 13, 2003|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRUCY6gc|archivedate=2010-11-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, FNC's ratings for its broadcast of the [[2004 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] exceeded those of all three broadcast networks. During President [[George W. Bush]]'s address, Fox News attracted 7.3&amp;nbsp;million viewers nationally; NBC, ABC, and CBS had a viewership of 5.9 million, 5.1 million and 5.0 million respectively.

In late 2005 and early 2006, FNC saw a brief decline in ratings. One decline was in the second quarter of 2006, when Fox News lost viewers for every prime-time program compared with the previous quarter. The audience for ''[[Special Report with Brit Hume]]'', for example, dropped 19 percent. Several weeks later, in the wake of the [[North Korean missile test, 2006|North Korean missile crisis]] and the [[2006 Lebanon War]], Fox saw a surge in viewership and remained the #1-rated cable news channel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/ratings/fncs_2554_prime_downward_spiral_20939.asp FNC's 25–54 Prime &quot;Downward Spiral&quot;], TV Newser&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stateofthemedia.org/2005/narrative_cabletv_contentanalysis.asp?cat=2&amp;media=5 Cable TV: Content Analysis]{{dead link|date=June 2012}}, The State of the News Media 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Fox produced eight of the top ten most-watched nightly cable news shows, with ''The O'Reilly Factor'' and ''[[Hannity &amp; Colmes]]'' finishing first and second respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/original/ranker_april05.pdf April 2005 Competitive Program Ranker (M-F 6a-11p programs)], TV Newser&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009, the [[Pew Research Center]] published a report on the public view of national news organizations. The report indicated that 72 percent of Republican Fox viewers rated the channel as &quot;favorable&quot;, while 43 percent of Democratic viewers and 55 percent of all viewers shared that opinion. However, Fox had the highest &quot;unfavorable&quot; rating of all national outlets studied (25 percent of all viewers). The report went on to say, &quot;partisan differences in views of Fox News have increased substantially since 2007&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Accuracy Rating Hits Two-Decade Low|url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1341/press-accuracy-rating-hits-two-decade-low|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRUF5PM6|archivedate=2010-11-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2011, [[Public Policy Polling]] reported that Fox News Channel was the second-most trusted television news network in the United States, with 42 percent of respondents reporting they trusted the network compared to other news channels (behind [[PBS]] at 50 percent and ahead of [[NBC]] at 41 percent, CNN at 40 percent,[[CBS]] at 36 percent and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] at 35 percent). Fox News Channel is also ranked the most distrusted [[news channel]] in the U.S., with 46 percent of respondents reporting they distrust the network (behind PBS at 30 percent, NBC at 41 percent and CNN, CBS, and ABC each at 43 percent). This represented a combined 16-percent drop among respondents from the year before, and placed the channel fourth among Americans in trust-distrust (behind PBS, NBC, and CNN and ahead of CBS and ABC). Most of this drop was the result of an increase in distrust among moderates and liberals. While conservatives largely held the same view of the network as they did the year before (dropping from 75 to 72 percent), moderates and liberals increased their distrust of the network (from 48 to 60 percent among moderates, and 66 to 82 percent among liberals). Of the poll's respondents, 18 percent identified as liberal, 41 percent as moderate and 40 percent as conservative; 40 percent identified as [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]], 37 percent as [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and 23 percent as [[Independent (voter)|independent]] or &quot;other&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TV News Poll|url=http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/PPP_Release_National_0119930.pdf|publisher=Public Policy Polling}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Our Second Annual TV News Trust Poll|url=http://publicpolicypolling.blogspot.com/2011/01/our-second-annual-tv-news-trust-poll.html|publisher=Public Policy Polling}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of October 22, 2012, Fox set a record for its highest-rated [[telecast]] ever, with 11.5 million viewers for the third [[United States presidential election debates, 2012|U.S. presidential debate]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/final-obama-romney-debate-gives-381956&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.deadline.com/2012/10/fox-news-breaks-ratings-record-with-third-presidential-debate/#utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter&lt;/ref&gt; In prime time the week before, Fox averaged almost 3.7 million viewers with a total day average of 1.66 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-fox-news-ratings-20121023,0,240248.story&lt;/ref&gt;

==Slogan==
[[File:Fairbalanced.png|thumb|2005 &quot;Fair &amp; Balanced&quot; graphic|alt=&quot;Fair &amp; Balanced&quot; against blue, black and red background]]
&quot;Fair &amp; Balanced&quot; is a [[trademark]]ed slogan used by the broadcaster, originally used in conjunction with the phrase &quot;Real Journalism&quot;.
Comedian [[Al Franken]] used the slogan in the subtitle for his 2003 book ''[[Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them|Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right]]''. In the book, he cites examples of what he claims to be Fox News' [[Media bias|bias]]. On August 7, 2003 Fox News sued for copyright infringement.&lt;ref name=&quot;foxsuit&quot;&gt;de Moraes, Lisa (August 12, 2003). [http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A46985-2003Aug11?language=printer Three Little Words: Fox News Sues.] ''[[Washington Post]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was dropped three days later, after Judge [[Denny Chin]] refused its request for an [[injunction]]. In his decision, Chin ruled that the case (''[[Fox v. Franken]]'') was &quot;wholly without merit, both factually and legally&quot;. He went on to suggest that Fox News' trademark on the phrase &quot;fair and balanced&quot; could be invalid.&lt;ref name=&quot;foxloss&quot;&gt;Phil Hirschkorn (August 22, 2003).

In December 2003 FNC won a legal battle concerning the slogan, when [[AlterNet]] filed a cancellation petition with the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] (USPTO) to have FNC's trademark rescinded as inaccurate. AlterNet included the documentary film ''[[Outfoxed]]'' as supporting evidence in its case.&lt;ref name=&quot;coyle&quot;&gt;Coyle, Jake (July 19, 2004 ). Advocacy Groups Challenge Fox News Slogan. Associated Press&lt;/ref&gt; After losing early motions, AlterNet withdrew its petition; the USPTO dismissed the case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=92042790&amp;pty=CAN&amp;eno=1 Official Documentation of Petitioned Cancellation of &quot;Fair &amp; Balanced&quot; trademark phrase], Trademark Trial and Appeal Board Inquiry System&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 FNC used the slogan &quot;We Report, You Decide&quot;, referring to &quot;You Decide 2008&quot; (FNC's original slogan for its coverage of election issues).

A leaked memo from Fox News vice president [[Bill Sammon]] to News staff at the height of the [[health care reform in the United States]] debate has been cited as an example of the pro-[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] bias of Fox News.

The memo was sent shortly after Republican pollster [[Frank Luntz]] advised [[Sean Hannity]] on his Fox show that &quot;If you call it a public option, the American people are split.

A Pew Research poll released on October 29, 2009 found that Fox News is viewed as the most ideological channel in America. 47 percent of those surveyed said Fox News is &quot;mostly conservative&quot;, 14 percent said &quot;mostly liberal&quot; and 24 percent said &quot;neither&quot;.

A poll by [[Rasmussen Reports]] found that 31 percent of Americans feel Fox News has a conservative bias, and 15 percent that it has a liberal bias. The poll also reported that 36 percent believed Fox News delivers news with neither a conservative or liberal bias, compared with 37 percent who said NPR delivers news with no conservative or liberal bias and 32 percent who said the same of CNN.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/current_events/media/americans_see_liberal_media_bias_on_tv_news|title=Americans See Liberal Media Bias on TV News – Rasmussen Reports|publisher=Rasmussenreports.com|date=2007-07-13|accessdate=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 study looked at the introduction of Fox News into local U.S. markets between 1996 and 2000, and found that in the 2000 presidential election &quot;Republicans gained 0.4 to 0.7 percentage points in the towns that broadcast Fox News&quot;.

===Obama administration conflict with Fox News===
In September 2009, the [[Obama administration]] engaged in a verbal conflict with Fox News Channel. On September 20 [[Barack Obama|President Obama]] appeared on all major news programs except Fox News, a snub partially in response to remarks about the president by commentators Glenn Beck and Sean Hannity and Fox coverage of Obama's health-care proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/12/business/media/12fox.html|work=The New York Times|title=Fox's Volley With Obama Intensifying|first=Brian|last=Stelter|date=October 12, 2009|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usnews.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/obama/2009/10/23/fox-pushed-team-obama-over-the-brink.html |title=White House: Fox Pushed Team Obama Over the Brink – US News and World Report |publisher=Usnews.com |date=2009-10-23 |accessdate=2010-07-29|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRUSCZjg |archivedate=2010-11-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late September 2009, Obama senior advisor [[David Axelrod]] and Roger Ailes met in secret to attempt to smooth out tensions between the two camps. Two weeks later White House officials referred to FNC as “not a news network&quot;, communications director [[Anita Dunn]] stating that “Fox News often operates as either the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican Party”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://features.csmonitor.com/politics/2009/10/23/the-fox-news-war-whats-the-upside-for-obama/|title=The Fox News war: What’s the upside for Obama?|publisher=CSMonitor.com|date=|accessdate=2009-10-23|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRUTCrgh|archivedate=2010-11-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/us/politics/23fox.html?_r=1|work=The New York Times|title=Behind the War Between White House and Fox|first=Jim|last=Rutenberg|date=October 23, 2009|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Obama observed, &quot;If media is operating basically as a talk radio format, then that's one thing, and if it's operating as a news outlet, then that's another&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/10/23/eveningnews/main5415921.shtml?tag=stack|title=President Obama's Feud with FOX News – CBS Evening News|publisher=CBS News|date=2009-10-23|accessdate=2010-07-29|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRUTlhWd|archivedate=2010-11-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  White House chief of staff [[Rahm Emanuel]] stated that it was important &quot;to not have the CNN's and the others in the world basically be led in following Fox&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-rutten24-2009oct24,0,3009088.column|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Obama's misguided Fox hunt|date=October 24, 2009|accessdate=May 2, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRUVTHlE|archivedate=2010-11-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within days it was reported that Fox had been excluded from an interview with administration official [[Ken Feinberg]], with bureau chiefs from the White House press pool (ABC, CBS, NBC, and CNN) coming to Fox's defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/23/us/politics/23fox.html|work=The New York Times|title=Behind the War Between White House and Fox|first=Jim|last=Rutenberg|date=October 23, 2009|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A bureau chief stated, &quot;If any member had been excluded it would have been the same thing, it has nothing to do with Fox or the White House or the substance of the issues&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Christina Bellantoni|date=October 23, 2009|url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/10/wh-were-happy-to-exclude-fox-but-didnt-yesterday-with-feinberg-interview.php|title=WH: We're Happy To Exclude Fox, But Didn't Yesterday With Feinberg Interview &amp;#124; TPMDC|publisher=Tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com|accessdate=2010-07-29|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRUXNrxX|archivedate=2010-11-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the story broke the White House admitted to a low-level mistake, saying that Fox had not made a specific request to interview Feinberg. Fox White House correspondent Major Garrett responded by stating that he had not made a specific request, but that he had a &quot;standing request from me as senior White House correspondent on Fox to interview any newsmaker at the Treasury at any given time news is being made&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Facebook User says:|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/finally resolved-major-garrett-reveals-his-side-of-pay-czar-gate/|title=Finally Resolved?

On November 8, 2009, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported that an unnamed Democratic consultant was warned by the White House not to appear on Fox News again. According to the article, Anita Dunn claimed in an e-mail to have checked with colleagues who &quot;deal with TV issues&quot; and had been told that nobody had been instructed to avoid Fox. [[Patrick Caddell]], a Fox News contributor and former pollster for President [[Jimmy Carter]], said he had spoken with other Democratic consultants who had received similar warnings from the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-obama-fox8-2009nov08,0,507227.story?test=latestnews|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Democratic consultant says he got a warning from White House after appearing on Fox News|first=Peter|last=Nicholas|date=November 8, 2009|accessdate=May 2, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRUZStRy |archivedate=2010-11-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International transmission==
The FNC feed is available internationally via a number of providers, while ''Fox Extra'' segments provide alternate programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,77537,00.html|title=Fox Around the World|work=Fox News.com|publisher=Fox News Channel|date=2012-03-06|accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Fox Extra}}''Fox Extra''===
Initially, US advertisements were replaced on FNC with viewer e-mail and profiles of FNC anchors set to music. In 2002, these were replaced with international weather forecasts. In 2006 the weather forecasts were replaced with ''Fox Extra'' (originally ''Fox News Extra'', prior to the international launch of [[Fox Business]]) segments, narrated reports from Fox on a variety of topics. These reports generally concern lighter issues unrelated to current news events, and the segments are repeated. FNC also shows international weather forecasts when Fox Extra segments run short. In the United Kingdom, after a period when local commercials were inserted into breaks ''Fox Extra'' now fills most breaks.

===Australia===
In [[Australia]], FNC is broadcast on the three major pay-TV providers: [[Foxtel]], [[Austar]] and [[Optus Television]]. Foxtel is 25-percent owned by News Corporation. [[Sky News Australia]] is Fox's sister channel.

===Brazil===
Since 2002, FNC has been broadcast to [[Brazil]]; however, commercials are replaced with ''Fox Extra''. It is available in digital packages of [[Net S.A.|NET]].

===Canada===
In 2003, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) rejected a Canadian Cable Telecommunications Association (CCTA) application to bring Fox News to Canada because Fox News U.S. and [[Global Television]] were planning to create Fox News Canada (a combination of U.S. and Canadian news). In 2004, after a Fox U.S. executive said there were no plans to create the combined channel, the CRTC approved an application to bring Fox News to Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2004/11/18/fox_crtc041118.html|title=CRTC approves Fox News for Canada |date=November 18, 2004|publisher=cbc.ca|date=2004-11-18|accessdate=2010-08-27|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uRUZpdxg|archivedate=2010-11-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fox News Channel is currently offered by [[Access Communications]], Bell TV, [[Cogeco]], [[EastLink (company)|Eastlink]], [[Manitoba Telecom Services]], Rogers, [[SaskTel]], Shaw Cable, Shaw Direct and [[Telus TV]].

FNC is usually broadcast as a [[VideoGuard]]-encrypted channel; during major news stories it may be simulcast on Sky Active, which is [[free-to-air]]. As of September 2006 the channel has carried UK-specific advertising, headlines and weather provided by Sky News during its breaks. These run under the brand of Fox News International.

Part of its programming was translated into Italian and broadcast on the defunct Italian news channel Stream News. In 2003 it moved to [[SKY Italia]], with U.S. commercials replaced by ''Fox News Extra'' segments. It is available to 4,600,000 subscribers and 160,000 hotel rooms. [[SKY TG 24]] is a sister channel to Fox News.

===Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]] Fox News has been carried by cable providers [[UPC]] and [[CASEMA]] and satellite provider [[Canaldigitaal]]; all have dropped the channel in recent years.

===New Zealand===
In [[New Zealand]], FNC is broadcast on Channel 092 of pay satellite operator [[SKY Network Television|SKY]] TV's digital platform. It was formerly broadcast overnight on free-to-air [[UHF]] New Zealand TV channel [[Prime Television (New Zealand)|Prime]] (owned by SKY); this was discontinued in January 2010, reportedly due to an expiring broadcasting license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://skytv.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/909/~/why-is-fox-news-no-longer-airing-on-prime%3F |title=Why is Fox News no longer airing on Prime? |date=January 26, 2010 |publisher=skytv.co.nz |date=2001-01-26 |accessdate=2010-08-27|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox News parent corporation News Corp has a stake in both SKY and Prime.
