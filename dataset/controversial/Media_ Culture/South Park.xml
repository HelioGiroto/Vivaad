'''''South Park''''' is an [[Television in the United States|American]] [[animated sitcom]] created by [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] for the [[Comedy Central]] [[Cable television|television network]]. Intended for mature audiences, the show has become famous for its crude language and [[black comedy|dark]], [[surreal humor]] that [[satire|lampoon]]s a [[Subject matter in South Park|wide range of topics]]. The ongoing narrative revolves around four boys—[[Stan Marsh]], [[Kyle Broflovski]], [[Eric Cartman]] and [[Kenny McCormick]]—and their bizarre adventures in and around the titular [[Colorado]] town.

Parker and Stone developed the show from [[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)|two animated shorts]] they created in 1992 and 1995. The latter became one of the first Internet [[viral video]]s, which ultimately led to its production as a series. ''South Park'' debuted in August 1997 with great success, consistently earning the highest ratings of any basic cable program. Subsequent ratings have varied but it remains one of Comedy Central's highest rated shows, and is slated to air through at least 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2011/11/16/south-park-renewed-through-2016-by-comedy-central/110938/|title='South Park' Renewed Through 2016 By Comedy Central|author=Bill Gorman|publisher=TV By the Numbers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[television pilot|pilot episode]] was produced using [[cutout animation]]. All subsequent episodes are created with [[software]] that emulates the cutout technique. Parker and Stone perform most of the [[voice acting]]. Since 2000, each episode is typically written and produced during the week preceding its broadcast, with Parker serving as the primary [[Screenwriter|writer]] and [[Television director|director]].

The series has received numerous accolades, including four [[Primetime Emmy Award]]s, a [[Peabody Award]], and numerous inclusions in various publications' lists of greatest television shows. The show's popularity resulted in a feature-length theatrical film, ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut]]'' which was released in June 1999, less than two years after the show's premiere, and became a box office and critical success.

He was written out of the show's [[South Park (season 6)|sixth season]] in 2002, re-appearing in the [[Red Sleigh Down|season finale]]. Since then, the practice of killing Kenny has been seldom used by the show's creators. During the show's first 58 episodes, the boys were in the [[third grade]]. In the [[South Park (season 4)|season four]] episode &quot;[[4th Grade (South Park)|4th Grade]]&quot; (2000), they entered the [[fourth grade]], where they have remained ever since.&lt;ref name=&quot;faq-11jan2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/354077|title=FAQ: When will the boys be in the fifth grades?|date=January 11, 2005|publisher=South Park Studios|accessdate=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;faq-8oct2008&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/faq/354892|title=FAQ: Are the boys still in 4th grade?|date=October 8, 2008|publisher=South Park Studios|accessdate=January 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and creation==

[[File:Trey Parker Matt Stone 2007.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Two adult males sitting in chairs; the male at the right is speaking into a handheld microphone|''South Park'' creators [[Trey Parker]] (left) and [[Matt Stone]] continue to do most of the writing, directing and voice acting on the show.]]
{{Main|The Spirit of Christmas (short film)}}
Soon after meeting in film class at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] in 1992, Parker and Stone created an [[short subject|animated short]] entitled ''[[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)|The Spirit of Christmas]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;fortune&quot; /&gt; The film was created by animating construction paper cutouts with [[stop motion]], and features [[prototype]]s of the main characters of ''South Park'', including a character resembling Cartman but named &quot;Kenny&quot;, an unnamed character resembling what is today Kenny, and two near-identical unnamed characters who resemble Stan and Kyle. [[Brian Graden]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] executive and mutual friend, commissioned Parker and Stone to create a second short film as a video [[Christmas card]]. Created in 1995, the second ''The Spirit of Christmas'' short resembled the style of the later series more closely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazette.uwo.ca/article.cfm?section=Arts&amp;articleID=1811&amp;month=11&amp;day=9&amp;year=2007|title=The evolution of South Park|date=November 9, 2007|publisher=www.gazette.uwo.ca
|accessdate=August 9, 2009|last=Gregoris|first=Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; To differentiate between the two homonymous shorts, the first short is often referred to as ''Jesus vs. Frosty'', and the second short as ''Jesus vs. Santa.'' Graden sent copies of the video to several of his friends, and from there it was copied and distributed, including on the [[Internet]], where it became one of the first [[viral video]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;fortune&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Jeffrey Ressner and James Collins|title=Gross And Grosser|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=March 23, 1998|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988028-2,00.html|accessdate=April 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As ''Jesus vs. Santa'' became more popular, Parker and Stone began talks of developing the short into a television series. Fox refused to pick up the series, not wanting to air a show that included the character [[List of South Park residents#Mr. Hankey|Mr. Hankey]], a talking piece of feces.&lt;ref name=&quot;leno&quot;&gt;{{cite video|people=Trey Parker, Matt Stone|date=1998|title=The Tonight Show with Jay Leno|medium=Television show|publisher=NBC}} Interview with Jay Leno&lt;/ref&gt; The two then entered negotiations with both [[MTV]] and Comedy Central.

Parker and Stone assembled a small staff and spent three months creating the [[Television pilot|pilot]] episode &quot;[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;apple&quot; /&gt; ''South Park'' was in danger of being canceled before it even aired when the show tested poorly with test audiences, particularly with women. However, the shorts were still gaining more popularity over the Internet, and Comedy Central agreed to order a run of six episodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcfarland1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;paulson&quot; /&gt; ''South Park'' debuted with &quot;Cartman Gets an Anal Probe&quot; on August 13, 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;seriously227&quot;&gt;Fallows and Weinstock, p. 227&lt;/ref&gt;

Most child characters are the same size and shape, and are distinguished by their clothing and headwear.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvamerica&quot; /&gt; Characters are mostly presented two-dimensionally and from only one angle.

PowerAnimator and Maya are high-end programs mainly used for [[3D computer graphics]], while co-producer and former animation director, [[Eric Stough]], notes that PowerAnimator was initially chosen because its features helped animators retain the show's &quot;homemade&quot; look.&lt;ref name=&quot;method&quot; /&gt; PowerAnimator was also used for making some of the show's special effects,&lt;ref name=&quot;method&quot; /&gt; which are now created using [[Motion (software)|Motion]],&lt;ref name=&quot;apple&quot; /&gt; a newer graphics program created by [[Apple, Inc.]] for their [[Mac OS X]] [[operating system]].

===Music===
[[File:Isaac hayes 1973.jpg|thumb|alt=An adult male with sunglasses plays a piano under a spotlight on a darkened stage, 1973|[[Chef (South Park)|Chef]] would often sing in a style reminiscent of that of his voice actor, [[Isaac Hayes]]]]

Parker says that the varying uses of music is of utmost importance to ''South Park''.&lt;ref name=&quot;philomusic&quot;&gt;Arp and Broman, pp. 236–249&lt;/ref&gt; Several characters often play or sing songs in order to change or influence a group's behavior, or to educate, motivate, or indoctrinate others. The show also frequently features scenes in which its characters have disapproving reactions to the performances of certain popular musicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;philomusic&quot; /&gt;

[[Adam Berry]], the show's original score composer, used [[sound synthesis]] to simulate a small orchestra, and frequently alluded to existing famous pieces of music. Berry also used signature acoustic guitar and mandolin cues as [[leitmotif]]s for the show's establishing shots.&lt;ref name=&quot;philomusic&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundtrack.net/features/article/?id=7|title=Eating Cheesy Poofs with Adam Berry|date=December 5, 1998|publisher=www.soundtrack.net|accessdate=May 23, 2009|last=Goldwasser|first=Dan}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Berry left in 2001, Jamie Dunlap and Scott Nickoley of the Los Angeles-based Mad City Production Studios provided the show's original music for the next seven seasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;digizine&quot; /&gt; Since 2008, Dunlap has been credited as the show's sole score composer.&lt;ref name=&quot;showcredits&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/fans/behind/cast.php|title=Cast and Crew – South Park Studios|publisher=www.southparkstudios.com|accessdate=May 23, 2009|last=|first=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dunlap's contributions to the show are one of the few that are not achieved at the show's own production offices. Dunlap reads a script, creates a score using digital audio software, and then e-mails the audio file to South Park Studios, where it is edited to fit with the completed episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;digizine&quot; /&gt;

In addition to singing in an effort to explain something to the children, Chef would also sing about things relevant to what had transpired in the plot. These songs were original compositions written by Parker, and performed by Hayes in the same sexually suggestive [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] style he had utilized during his own music career. The band [[DVDA (band)|DVDA]], which consists of Parker and Stone, along with show staff members Bruce Howell and D.A. Young, would perform the music for these compositions, and, until the character's death on the show, were listed as &quot;Chef's Band&quot; in the closing credits.&lt;ref name=&quot;method&quot; /&gt;

[[Rick James]], [[Elton John]], [[Meat Loaf]], [[Joe Strummer]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Primus (band)|Primus]], [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]], and [[Ween]] all guest starred and briefly performed in the [[South Park (season 2)|season two]] (1998) episode &quot;[[Chef Aid]]&quot;.

==Reception==

===Ratings===

When ''South Park'' debuted, it was a huge ratings success for Comedy Central and is seen as being largely responsible for the success of the channel, with Herzog crediting it for putting the network &quot;on the map&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;fortune&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytad&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bc68&quot;&gt;Johnson-Woods, pp. 6–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The show's first episode, &quot;[[Cartman Gets an Anal Probe]]&quot;, earned a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] rating of 1.3 (980,000 viewers), at the time considered high for a [[Cable television in the United States|cable program]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bc68&quot; /&gt; The show instantly generated buzz among television viewers, and mass viewing parties began assembling on college campuses.&lt;ref name=&quot;whois&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimescarter&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfrubin&quot; /&gt; By the time the eighth episode &quot;[[Starvin' Marvin (South Park)|Starvin' Marvin]]&quot; aired three months after the show debuted, ratings and viewership had tripled, and ''South Park'' was already the most successful show in Comedy Central's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfrubin&quot; /&gt; When the tenth episode &quot;[[Damien (South Park)|Damien]]&quot; aired the following February, viewership increased another 33 percent. The episode earned a 6.4 rating, which at the time was over 10 times the average rating earned by a cable show aired in [[prime time]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimescarter&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bc68&quot; /&gt; The ratings peaked with the second episode of [[South Park (season 2)|season two]], &quot;[[Cartman's Mom Is Still a Dirty Slut]]&quot;, which aired on April 22, 1998. The episode earned an 8.2 rating (6.2 million viewers) and, at the time, set a record as the highest-rated non-sports show in basic cable history.&lt;ref name=&quot;augusta_trash&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wilonsky&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bc68&quot; /&gt; During the spring of 1998, eight of the ten highest-rated shows on basic cable were ''South Park'' episodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;nydailyratings&quot; /&gt;

The success of ''South Park'' prompted more cable companies to carry Comedy Central and led it to its becoming one of the fastest-growing cable channels. The number of households that had Comedy Central jumped from 9.1 million in 1997 to 50 million in June 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;bc68&quot; /&gt; When the show debuted, the most Comedy Central had earned for a 30-second commercial was US$7,500.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimescarter&quot; /&gt; Within a year, advertisers were paying an average of US$40,000 for 30 seconds of advertising time during airings of ''South Park'' in its second season, while some paid as much as US$80,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=David Horowitz|title=Why Gore would censor &quot;South Park&quot;|publisher=Salon.com|date= July 19, 1999|url=http://www.salon.com/news/col/horo/1999/07/19/south_park/index2.html|accessdate=May 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the third season ([[1999 in television|1999]]), the series' ratings began to decrease.&lt;ref&gt;

{{Wikinewspar2|Isaac Hayes quits South Park over Scientology episode|35 South Park complaints not upheld, New Zealand|YouTube, Facebook blocked in Pakistan}}
The show's frequent depiction of [[taboo]] subject matter, general toilet humor, accessibility to younger viewers, disregard for [[conservative]] sensibilities, negative depiction of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] causes, and portrayal of religion for comic effect have been the main sources for generating controversy and debate over the course of its run.

The season fourteen episodes [[200 (South Park)|200]] and [[201 (South Park)|201]] were mired in controversy for satirizing issues surrounding the depiction of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad.
The website for the organization [[Revolution Muslim]], a New York-based radical Muslim organization, posted an entry that included a warning to creators Parker and Stone that they risk violent retribution for their [[depictions of Muhammad]]. It said that they &quot;will probably wind up like Theo Van Gogh for airing this show.&quot; Filmmaker [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo Van Gogh]] was murdered by an Islamic extremist in 2004 for making a short documentary on violence against women in some Islamic societies. The posting provided the addresses to Comedy Central in New York and the production company in Los Angeles. The author of the post, [[Zachary Adam Chesser]] (who prefers to be called Abu Talhah al Amrikee),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/04/23/road-radicalism-man-south-park-threats/?test=latestnews|title=Road to Radicalism: The Man Behind the 'South Park' Threats|last=Miller|first=Joshua Rhett|date=April 23, 2010|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; said it was meant to serve as a warning to Parker and Stone, not a threat, and that providing the addresses was meant to give people the opportunity to protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/04/19/security-brief-radical-islamic-web-site-takes-on-south-park/|title=Security Brief: Radical Islamic Web site takes on 'South Park'|last=Lister|first=Tim|date=April 19, 2010|work=CNN|accessdate=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rhett&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2010/04/20/website-warns-south-park-creators-face-retribution-depicting-muhammad/|title=South Park Creators Could Face Retribution for Depicting Muhammad, Website Warns|last=Miller|first=Joshua Rhett|date=April 20, 2010|work=Fox News|accessdate=April 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite al Amrikee's claims that the website entry was a warning, several media outlets and observers interpreted it as a threat.&lt;ref name=&quot;AC360&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Radical Islamists Threaten 'South Park' Creators; More Volcano Eruptions Ahead|series=Anderson Cooper 360°|serieslink=Anderson Cooper 360°|credits=[[Anderson Cooper|Cooper, Anderson]]|network=[[CNN]]|city=New York City|airdate=April 20, 2010|began=22:00|ended=24:00|transcripturl=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1004/20/acd.01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OReilly&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title=South Park Episode Prompts Death Threats|credits=[[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|O'Reilly, Bill]]|network=[[Fox News Channel]]|series=The O'Reilly Factor|serieslink=The O'Reilly Factor|city=New York City|airdate=April 20, 2010|began=18:00|ended=19:00|transcripturl=http://video.foxnews.com/v/4159547/south-park-episode-prompts-death-threats?loomia_ow=t0:s0:a16:g2:r5:c0.006712:b33088576:z6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cavna|first=Michael|title=Comic Riffs – 'South Park': Is pro-jihad website threatening cartoonists over Muhammad satire?|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=April 20, 2010|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/comic-riffs/2010/04/south_park_threat_over_muhamma.html|accessdate=April 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for the episode has come in the form of [[Everybody Draw Mohammed Day]]!, a movement started on Facebook that encourages people to draw Muhammad on May 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=South Park Declares Jihad On the Handicapped!|work=Lineboil|date= April 28, 2010|url=http://lineboil.com/2010/04/south-park-declares-jihad-on-the-handicapped/|accessdate=May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commentary made in episodes have been interpreted as statements Parker and Stone are attempting to make to the viewing public,&lt;ref name=&quot;seriously&quot;&gt;Fallows and Weinstock, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; and these opinions have been subject to much critical analysis in the media and literary world within the framework of popular philosophical, theological, social, and political concepts.&lt;ref name=&quot;blame&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;seriously&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;blmp&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanley|first=Richard (Editor)|coauthors=|title=South Park and Philosophy: Bigger, Longer, and More Penetrating|publisher=Open Court|date=March 8, 2007|pages=|isbn=0-8126-9613-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since ''South Park'' debuted, college students have written term papers and doctoral theses analyzing the show,&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimesstudy&quot; /&gt; while [[Brooklyn College]] offers a course called &quot;''South Park'' and Political Correctness&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nypostbklyn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/11302008/news/nationalnews/south_park_no_lark_at_bklyn_college_141507.htm|date=November 30, 2008|title=South Park No Lark at B'klyn College|work=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=May 22, 2009

In the [[South Park (season 2)|season two]] episode &quot;[[Chef Aid]]&quot;, attorney [[Johnnie Cochran]] uses what's called in the show the [[Chewbacca defense]], which is a legal strategy that involves addressing plot holes related to [[Chewbacca]] in the film ''[[Star Wars Episode VI: Return of the Jedi|Return of the Jedi]]'' rather than discussing the trial at hand during a closing argument in a deliberate attempt to confuse jurors into thinking there is [[reasonable doubt]].

Another season two episode, &quot;[[Gnomes (South Park)|Gnomes]]&quot;, revolves around a group of &quot;underpants [[gnome]]s&quot; who, as their name suggests, run a corporation stealing people's underpants. When asked about their business model, various gnomes reply that theirs is a three-step process: Phase 1 is &quot;collect underpants&quot;. Phase 3 is &quot;profit&quot;. However, the gnomes are unable to explain what is to occur between the first and final steps, and &quot;Phase 2&quot; is accompanied by a large question mark on their corporate flow chart. Using &quot;????&quot; and &quot;PROFIT!&quot; as the last two steps in a process (usually jokingly) has become a widely popular [[Internet meme]] because of this. Especially in the context of politics and economics, &quot;underpants gnomes&quot; has been used by some commentators to characterize a conspicuous gap of logic or planning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124329131991652291.html|title=Obama and the 'South Park' Gnomes|author=Bret Stephens|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=June 1, 2009|date=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webnotes.net/?uGIOp6|title=Small Government Egalitarianism|author=Matt Yglesias|publisher=Think Progress|accessdate=June 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political===

While many conservatives have condemned the show for its vulgarity, a growing population of people who hold [[center-right]] political beliefs, including teenagers and young adults, have embraced the show for its tendency to mock [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] viewpoints and lampoon liberal celebrities and icons.&lt;ref name=&quot;theadvocates&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theadvocates.org/celebrities/trey-parker.html|title=Trey Parker – Libertarian|date=|publisher=www.theadvocates.org|accessdate=May 24, 2009|last=Winter|first=Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pundit (expert)|Political commentator]] [[Andrew Sullivan]] dubbed the group [[South Park Republican|''South Park'' Republicans]], or ''South Park'' conservatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=William|last= Cohen|title=Respect Its Authoritah!|work=The Cornell American|date=November 4, 2005|url=http://www.cornellamerican.com/article/109/print/|accessdate=May 5, 2009}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cityjournal&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;refugees&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=John Tierney|title=South Park Refugees|work=The New York Times|date=August 29, 2006|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06E4DC113EF93AA1575BC0A9609C8B63|accessdate=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan classified the group as &quot;extremely skeptical of political correctness but also are socially liberal on many issues&quot;, though he says the phrase applied to them is meant to be more of a casual indication of beliefs than a strong partisan label.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cityjournal&quot; /&gt; [[Brian C.

Parker and Stone downplay the show's alignment with any particular political affiliation, and deny having a political agenda when creating an episode.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcfarland1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;refugees&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HP2010&quot;&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/25/matt-stone-trey-parker-ar_n_475744.html Matt Stone &amp; Trey Parker Are Not Your Political Allies (No Matter What You Believe)] by Alex Leo, ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', February 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
The two claim the show's higher ratio of instances lampooning liberal orthodoxies stems simply from their preference to make fun of liberals more than conservatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;abc3&quot; /&gt; While Stone has been quoted saying &quot;I hate conservatives, but I really fucking hate liberals&quot;, Stone and Parker have explained that their drive to lampoon a given target comes first from the target's insistence on telling other people how to behave.&lt;ref name=&quot;gillespie&quot; /&gt; The duo explains that they perceive liberals as having both delusions of entitlement to remain free from satire, and a propensity to enforce political correctness while patronizing the citizens of [[Middle America (US)|Middle America]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimesconserv&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cityjournal&quot; /&gt; Parker and Stone are uncomfortable with the idea of themselves or ''South Park'' being applied with any kind of partisan classification.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcfarland1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;refugees&quot; /&gt; Parker said he rejects the &quot;''South Park'' Republican&quot; and &quot;''South Park'' conservative&quot; labels as a serious notion, feeling that either tag implies that one only adheres to strictly conservative or liberal viewpoints.&lt;ref name=&quot;rs1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;theadvocates&quot; /&gt; Canadian columnist Jaime J. Weinman observes that the most die-hard conservatives who identified themselves as &quot;''South Park'' Republicans&quot; began turning away from the label when the show ridiculed Republicans in the [[South Park (season 9)|season nine]] (2005) episode &quot;[[Best Friends Forever (South Park)|Best Friends Forever]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;growsup2&quot; /&gt;

===Video games===
{{See also|List of South Park video games}}
Following the early success of the series, three video games based on the series were released by [[Acclaim Entertainment]]. A [[first-person shooter]] simply titled ''[[South Park (video game)|South Park]]'' was released in 1998 for the [[Personal computer|PC]], [[Nintendo 64]], and [[PlayStation]]. This was followed in 1999 by ''[[South Park: Chef's Luv Shack]]'', a [[party video game]] featuring quizzes and mini-games, on the [[Dreamcast]], PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC. In 2000, ''[[South Park Rally]]'', a racing game, was released on the Dreamcast, PlayStation, Nintendo 64, and PC. Parker and Stone had little to do with the development of these games, apart from providing voice acting, and have publicly criticized Acclaim and the quality of the ''South Park'' games they produced.&lt;ref name=&quot;sps40&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ps2_premiere&quot;&gt;{{Cite video|url=http://treyparker.info/video/playstation_18oct00.zip|title=PlayStation 2 Premiere|publisher=[http://treyparker.info/ shpadoinkle]|date=October 18, 2000|accessdate=September 4, 2011}} [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m6jrRQnqeGU Video on YouTube].&lt;/ref&gt; Several years after these early games, the decision was made to form a small group called South Park Digital Studios, which would, among other things, work on creating new ''South Park'' games,&lt;ref name=&quot;dd_intro&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southparkstudios.com/games/lgtdp/developer-diaries#358657|title=''Let's Go Tower Defense Play!'': Developer Diaries: Do you have what it takes to save South Park?|last=Benson|first=Todd|date=September 18, 2009|accessdate=September 4, 2011|publisher=South Park Studios}}&lt;/ref&gt; that would involve the studio and the show's creators more heavily. The first such title is ''[[South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!]]'', a [[tower defense game]] developed by [[Doublesix]], which was released in 2009 for the [[Xbox Live Arcade]] service on the [[Xbox 360]] console. Two other ''South Park'' games are also currently in production. Another Xbox Live Arcade game, ''[[South Park: Tenorman's Revenge]]'' is a [[Platform game|platformer]], which was released in the spring of 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;announcement_pr&quot;&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/press/press_releases/2011/101311-sp-game.jhtml|title='South Park' Launches 'South Park: Tenorman's Revenge' Video Game Exclusively on Xbox LIVE Arcade for Spring 2012 Debut|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]|date=October 13, 2011|accessdate=October 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[South Park: The Stick of Truth]]'' is an upcoming [[role-playing video game]] that is being written by Parker and Stone,&lt;ref name=&quot;spthegame_pr&quot;&gt;{{Cite press release|url=http://www.thq.com/us/south-park-the-game/go/article/view/252101/thq_joins_forces_with_south_park_digital_studios_on|title=THQ Joins Forces with South Park Digital Studios on 'South Park: The Game'|publisher=[[THQ]]|date=December 1, 2011|accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is scheduled to be released on March 5, 2013 for the Xbox 360 and [[PlayStation 3]] consoles, and [[Microsoft Windows]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/south-park-stick-truth-release-date-set-march|title=South Park: The Stick of Truth Release Date Set for March|publisher=[[GamesRader]]|date=June 4, 2012|accessdate=September 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
