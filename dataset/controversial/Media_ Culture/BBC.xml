Outside the UK, the [[BBC World Service]] has provided services by direct broadcasting and re-transmission contracts by sound radio since the inauguration of the BBC Empire Service in December 1932, and more recently by television and online. Though sharing some of the facilities of the domestic services, particularly for news and current affairs output, the World Service has a separate Managing Director, and its operating costs have historically been funded mainly by direct grants from the British government. These grants were determined independently of the domestic licence fee and were usually awarded from the budget of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. As such, the BBC's international content has traditionally represented – at least in part – an effective foreign policy tool of the British Government.  The recent [[BBC World Service]] spending review has announced plans for the funding for the world service to be drawn from the domestic licence fee.

The Corporation's guaranteed income from the licence fee and the World Service grants are supplemented by profits from commercial operations through a wholly owned subsidiary, [[BBC Worldwide]] Ltd. The company's activities include programme- and format-sales.  The BBC also earns additional income from selling certain programme-making services through [[BBC Studios and Post Production|BBC Studios and Post Production Ltd.]], formerly [[BBC Resources Ltd]], another wholly owned trading subsidiary of the corporation. Most of the BBC's magazine and book publishing activities were sold in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sweney.

{{Further|Timeline of the BBC}}

===1922 to 1939===
[[File:Alexandra Palace 052.jpg|thumb|upright|A [[blue plaque]] at [[Alexandra Palace]] commemorating the world's first public broadcast of high-definition television]]
The privately owned BBC was the world's first national broadcasting organisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;historicalbroadcaster&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=BBC History – The BBC takes to the Airwaves|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/aboutbbcnews/spl/hi/history/html/default.stm |accessdate=19 July 2007|publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded on 18 October 1922 as the [[British Broadcasting Company|British Broadcasting Company Ltd]]&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/resources/in-depth/reith_1.shtml|title=BBC – The BBC Story – John Reith|work=[[BBC Online]]|publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 October 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100930023911/http://www.bbc.co.uk/historyofthebbc/resources/in-depth/reith_1.shtml| archivedate= 30 September 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the British [[General Post Office]] (GPO) and a group of six telecommunications companies—[[Marconi's Wireless Telegraph Company|Marconi]], Radio Communication Company, [[Metropolitan-Vickers]] (MetroVick), [[The General Electric Company plc|General Electric]], [[Western Electric]], and [[British Thomson-Houston]] (BTH)&lt;ref&gt;Western Electric was a subsidiary of AT&amp;T and, confusingly, Thomson-Houston in the USA had its roots in the (American) General Electric Co.—even more confusingly, British Thomson-Houston is sometimes referred to as Hotpoint Electric Appliance Co., which was formed by BTH in 1921—Burndept Ltd. was later added to the list to represent the interests of smaller electrical manufacturers in the UK {{cite web | url = http://www.btinternet.com/~roger.beckwith/bh/odds/prebh.htm | title = Old Broadcasting Equipment and Memories – BC: Before the Corporation: compiled by Mike Chessher | accessdate =20 September 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070808185553/http://www.btinternet.com/~roger.beckwith/bh/odds/prebh.htm| archivedate= 8 August 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;—to broadcast experimental radio services. The first transmission was on 14 November of that year, from station [[2LO]], located at Marconi House, London. That year [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]] became its general manager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/keydates.shtml |publisher=BBC Press Office| title = Key BBC Dates | accessdate =28 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923 the [[Frederick Sykes|Sykes Committee]] rejected advertising for the service as it would lower standards, and recommended that a 10s [[Television licensing in the United Kingdom (historical)|licence fee]] fund broadcasts. To avoid competition with newspapers, [[Fleet Street]] persuaded the government to ban news programs until 7 PM, and the BBC could only use news from [[wire services]] instead of reporting its own. By 1925 the BBC reached about 80% of Britons through a network of regional and relay stations. While regional stations at first offered many local programs, by 1930 the [[BBC National Programme|National Programme]] from London, and a [[BBC Regional Programme|Regional Programme]] from London and several regional cities, replaced local radio.&lt;ref name=&quot;crisell1997&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=An Introductory History of British Broadcasting | publisher=Routledge | author=Crisell, Andrew | year=1997 | pages=15-16,18-19,22 | isbn=0-415-12802-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was wound-up and on 1 January 1927&lt;ref&gt;Asa Briggs, ''The History of Broadcasting in the United Kingdom: The golden age of wireless'' (Oxford University Press, 1995) pp. 3, 6, 143.&lt;/ref&gt;

The GPO was reluctant to collect the license fee for a commercial entity, and the BBC's financial losses caused wireless manufacturers to wish to exit the consortium. In 1925, Reith persuaded another committee led by the [[David Lindsay, 27th Earl of Crawford|Earl of Crawford]] to recommend that a new entity, independent of both the government and corporations, administer broadcasting. The [[1926 general strike]] interrupted newspaper publishing so temporarily ended the ban on news reporting, and its balanced representation of strikers' and government viewpoints during the national crisis impressed millions of listeners. By the end of 1926 the government accepted the Crawford Committee's recommendations, and Reith was knighted. On 1 January 1927 the British Broadcasting Corporation, established under a [[Royal Charter]] and with Reith as [[Director-General of the BBC|Director-General]], became successor in interest.{{r|crisell1997}}

To represent its purpose and (stated) values, the Corporation adopted the [[Coat of arms of the BBC|coat of arms]], including the motto &quot;Nation shall speak peace unto Nation&quot;. The motto is generally attributed to Montague John Rendall, former headmaster of [[Winchester College]], and member of the first BBC Board of Governors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Motto&quot;&gt;{{cite web |editor-last=Knowles|editor-first=Elizabeth |title=The Oxford Dictionary of Modern Quotations|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?subview=Main&amp;entry=t93.e1500 |edition= Oxford Reference Online|year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=11 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motto is said to be a &quot;felicitous adaptation&quot; of [[Micah (prophet)|Micah]] 4: 3 &quot;nation shall not lift up a sword against nation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rendall&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Firth|first=J.

Experimental television broadcasts were started in 1932 using an electromechanical 30-line system developed by [[John Logie Baird]]. Limited regular broadcasts using this system began in 1934, and an expanded service (now named the [[BBC Television Service]]) started from [[Alexandra Palace]] in 1936, alternating between an improved Baird mechanical 240 line system and the all electronic [[405 line]] Marconi-EMI system. The superiority of the electronic system saw the mechanical system dropped early the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Norman, Bruce |title =Here's Looking at You: The Story of British Television 1908–1939 |year=1984 |page=99 |isbn=978-0563201021}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1939 to 2000 ===
Television broadcasting was suspended from 1 September 1939 to 7 June 1946 during the [[Second World War]]. A widely reported urban myth is that, upon resumption of service, announcer [[Leslie Mitchell (broadcaster)|Leslie Mitchell]] started by saying, &quot;As I was saying before we were so rudely interrupted ...&quot; In fact, the first person to appear when transmission resumed was [[Jasmine Bligh]] and the words said were &quot;Good afternoon, everybody. How are you? Do you remember me, Jasmine Bligh ...?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/baird/tvoff.php | title = Baird: The edit that rewrote history | last = Graham | first = Russ J. | date = 31 October 2005 | accessdate =11 August 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060718223433/http://www.transdiffusion.org/emc/baird/tvoff.php| archivedate= 18 July 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Broadcasting Union]] was formed on 12 February 1950, in Torquay with the BBC among the 23 founding broadcasting organisations.
[[File:BBC TV Centre.jpg|thumb|[[BBC Television Centre]] at [[White City, London|White City]], West London, which opened in 1960]]
Competition to the BBC was introduced in 1955 with the commercial and independently operated television network of [[ITV]]. However, the BBC monopoly on radio services would persist into the 1970s. As a result of the [[Pilkington Committee on Broadcasting|Pilkington Committee]] report of 1962, in which the BBC was praised for the quality and range of its output, and ITV was very heavily criticised for not providing enough quality programming,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Committees of Enquiry: Pilkington Committee | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/heritage/more/pdfs/committees_of_enquiry.pdf | page = 4 | date = 1 June 1962| format = PDF | accessdate =30 September 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061012060952/http://www.bbc.co.uk/heritage/more/pdfs/committees_of_enquiry.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 12 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; the decision was taken to award the BBC a second television channel, [[BBC Two|BBC2]], in 1964, renaming the existing service [[BBC1]]. BBC2 used the higher resolution 625 line standard which had been standardised across Europe. BBC2 was broadcast in colour from 1 July 1967, and was joined by BBC 1 and ITV on 15 November 1969. The 405 line [[Vhf#United Kingdom|VHF]] transmissions of BBC1 (and ITV) were continued for compatibility with older television receivers until 1985.

Starting in 1964 a series of [[pirate radio]] stations (starting with [[Radio Caroline]]) came on the air, and forced the British government finally to regulate radio services to permit nationally based advertising-financed services. In response the BBC reorganised and renamed their radio channels. The Light Programme was split into [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] offering continuous &quot;Popular&quot; music and [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] more &quot;Easy Listening&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/09/27/bvradio127.xml&amp;page=1 | work=Daily Telegraph | title = The day we woke up to pop music on Radio 1| date = 27 September 2007 | author=Imogen Carter | accessdate =30 September 2007 | location=London| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071018203739/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/09/27/bvradio127.xml&amp;page=1| archivedate= 18 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Third&quot; programme became [[BBC Radio 3|Radio 3]] offering classical music and cultural programming. The Home Service became [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] offering news, and non-musical content such as quiz shows, readings, dramas and plays. As well as the four national channels, a series of local BBC radio stations were established in 1967, including [[BBC London 94.9|Radio London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-Q8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA41|title=Radio in London|last=Partridge|first=Rob|date=13 November 1971|work=Billboard|accessdate=2 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the BBC's [[teletext]] service, [[Ceefax]], was introduced, created initially to provide subtitling, but developed into a news and information service. In 1978 BBC staff went on strike just before the Christmas of that year, thus blocking out the transmission of both channels and amalgamating all four radio stations into one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meldrum.co.uk/mhp/continuity/guestroom.html The Guestroom for Mr Cock-up] Pick of the Continuity Announcers, 6 April 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/itw/features/Ratings.html Ratings for 1978] Independent Teleweb&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the deregulation of the UK television and radio market in the 1980s, the BBC has faced increased competition from the commercial sector (and from the advertiser-funded public service broadcaster [[Channel 4]]), especially on satellite television, cable television, and [[digital television]] services.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The [[BBC Research Department]] has played a major part in the development of broadcasting and recording techniques. In the early days it carried out essential research into acoustics and programme level and noise measurement.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The BBC was also responsible for the development of the [[NICAM]] stereo standard.

In recent decades, a number of additional channels and radio stations have been launched: [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|Radio 5]] was launched in 1990 as a sports and educational station, but was replaced in 1994 with [[BBC Radio 5 Live|Radio 5 Live]], following the success of the [[BBC Radio 4 News FM|Radio 4 service]] to cover the 1991 Gulf War. The new station would be a news and sport station. In 1997, [[BBC News 24]], a rolling news channel, launched on [[digital television]] services and the following year, [[BBC Choice]] launched as the third general entertainment channel from the BBC. The BBC also purchased The Parliamentary Channel, which was renamed [[BBC Parliament]]. In 1999, [[BBC Knowledge]] launched as a multi media channel, with services available on the newly launched [[BBC Red Button|BBC Text]] digital teletext service, and on [[BBC Online]]. The channel had an educational aim, which was modified later on in its life to offer documentaries.

=== 2000 to 2011 ===
In 2002, a number of new channels and stations were made: [[BBC Knowledge]] was renamed [[BBC Four]] and became the BBC's arts and documentaries channel. In addition, [[CBBC]], which had been a programming strand as Children's BBC since 1985, was split into CBBC and [[CBeebies]] with both new services getting a digital channel: the [[CBBC Channel]] and [[CBeebies]] Channel. In addition to the television channels, new digital radio stations were created: [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|1Xtra]], [[BBC Radio 6 Music|6 Music]] and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|BBC7]]. [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|BBC 1Xtra]] was a sister station to [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] and specialised in modern black music, [[BBC Radio 6 Music|BBC 6 Music]] specialised in alternative music genres and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|BBC7]] specialised in archive, speech and children's programming.

The following few years resulted in repositioning of some of the channels to conform to a larger brand: in 2003, [[BBC Choice]] became [[BBC Three]], with programming for younger generations and shocking real life documentaries, BBC News 24 became the [[BBC News Channel]] in 2008, and BBC Radio 7 became [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] in 2011, with new programmes to supplement those broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]. In 2008 another channel was launched, [[BBC Alba]], a [[Scottish Gaelic]] service.

The 2004 [[Hutton Inquiry]] and the subsequent Report raised questions about the BBC's journalistic standards and its impartiality. This led to resignations of senior management members at the time including the then Director General, [[Greg Dyke]]. In January 2007, the BBC released minutes of the Board meeting which led to Greg Dyke's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/jan/11/politicsandthemedia.bbc|title=Dyke departure minutes released|work=The Guardian  |location=UK |date=11 January 2007|accessdate=22 March 2010  | first=Matt | last=Wells}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the other departments of the BBC, the BBC World Service is funded by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]]. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office, more commonly known as the Foreign Office or the FCO, is the British government department responsible for promoting the interests of the United Kingdom abroad.

In the past few years, the BBC has experimented in [[high-definition television]]. In 2006, [[BBC HD]] launched as an experimental service, and became official in December 2007. The channel broadcasts HD simulcasts of programmes on [[BBC One]], [[BBC Two|Two]], [[BBC Three|Three]] and [[BBC Four|Four]] as well as repeats of some older programmes in HD. In 2010, a HD simulcast of BBC One launched: [[BBC One HD]]. The new channel uses HD versions of BBC One's schedule and uses upscaled versions of programmes not currently produced in HD.

On 18 October 2007, BBC Director General Mark Thompson announced a controversial plan to make major cuts and reduce the size of the BBC as an organisation. The plans included a reduction in posts of 2,500; including 1,800 redundancies, consolidating news operations, reducing programming output by 10% and selling off the flagship [[BBC Television Centre|Television Centre]] building in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/10_october/18/reform.shtml|title=Radical reform to deliver a more focused BBC|publisher=BBC Press Office|date=18 October 2007|accessdate=18 October 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071020051207/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/10_october/18/reform.shtml| archivedate= 20 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; These plans have been fiercely opposed by unions, who have threatened a series of strikes, however the BBC have stated that the cuts are essential to move the organisation forward and concentrate on increasing the quality of programming.

On 20 October 2010, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[George Osborne]] announced that the television licence fee would be frozen at its current level until the end of the current charter in 2016. The same announcement revealed that the BBC would take on the full cost of running the [[BBC World Service]] and the [[BBC Monitoring]] service from the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], and will part finance the Welsh broadcaster [[S4C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Television licence fee to be frozen for the next six years|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-11572171|accessdate=6 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011 to present ===
Further cuts were announced on 6 October 2011, so the BBC could reach a total reduction in their budget of 20%, following the licence fee freeze in October 2010. Details include cutting staff by 2000 and sending a further 1000 to the [[MediaCityUK]] development, with BBC Three moving in 2016, the sharing of more programmes between stations and channels, sharing of radio news bulletins, more repeats in schedules, including the whole of BBC Two daytime and for some original programming to be reduced. Also, the [[BBC HD]] channel would be closed and replaced with an HD simulcast of BBC Two, however flagship programmes, other channels and full funding for [[CBBC]] and [[CBeebies]] would be retained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC set to cut 2000 jobs by 2017|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15165926|accessdate=6 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC cuts at a glance|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-15186116|accessdate=6 October 2011|newspaper=BBC News|date=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC cuts: in detail|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/bbc/8810868/BBC-cuts-in-detail.html|accessdate=6 October 2011|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous BBC facilities are to be sold off, including [[New Broadcasting House]] on [[Oxford Road, Manchester|Oxford Road]] in Manchester. Departments are being split between [[Broadcasting House]] and [[MediaCityUK]], as well as many services remaining at BBC Television Centre in London until at least 2016.

==Governance==
[[File:Bbc logo before 1970.png|thumb|[[Coat of arms of the BBC|The BBC coat of arms]]]]
The BBC is a corporation, independent from direct government intervention, with its activities being overseen by the [[BBC Trust]] (formerly the [[Board of Governors of the BBC|Board of Governors]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/running/|title=How the BBC is run|publisher=BBC |accessdate=28 January 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090123171540/http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/running/| archivedate= 23 January 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; General management of the organisation is in the hands of a Director-General, who is appointed by the Trust; he is the BBC's Editor-in-Chief and chairs the Executive Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/running/executive/index.shtml|title=Executive Board|publisher=BBC |accessdate=28 January 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090223173652/http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/running/executive/index.shtml| archivedate= 23 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charter===
The BBC operates under a [[Royal Charter#United Kingdom|Royal Charter]],&lt;ref name=&quot;crown&quot;/&gt; with the current Charter having come into effect on 1 January 2007 and running until 31 December 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Royal Charter&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=BBC Royal Charter and Agreement |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/about/how_we_govern/charter_and_agreement/index.shtml |accessdate=3 September 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091013152039/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/about/how_we_govern/charter_and_agreement/index.shtml| archivedate= 13 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Charter is reviewed every 10&amp;nbsp;years.

The 2007 Charter specifies that the mission of the Corporation is to &quot;inform, educate and entertain&quot;. It states that the Corporation exists to serve the public interest and to promote its public purposes: sustaining citizenship and civil society, promoting education and learning, stimulating creativity and cultural excellence, representing the UK, its nations, regions and communities, bringing the UK to the world and the world to the UK, helping to deliver to the public the benefit of emerging communications technologies and services, and taking a leading role in the [[Digital dividend|switchover to digital television]].

This Charter also created the largest change in the governance of the Corporation since its inception. It abolished the sometimes controversial governing body, the [[Board of Governors of the BBC|Board of Governors]], and replaced it with the [[BBC Trust]] and a formalised Executive Board.

Under the Royal Charter, the BBC must obtain a licence from the [[Home Secretary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbchow&quot;/&gt; This licence is accompanied by an agreement which sets the terms and conditions under which BBC is allowed to broadcast.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbchow&quot;/&gt; It was under this Licence and Agreement (and the [[Broadcasting Act 1981]]) that the [[BBC controversies#1988–1994: Sinn Féin broadcast ban|Sinn Féin broadcast ban]] from 1988 to 1994 was implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Glasgow Media Group Reader: Industry, Economy, War and Politics|page=48|volume=2|publisher=Psychology Press|first1=John Eric Thomas|last1=Eldridge|first2=Greg|last2=Philo|year=1995|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=vo4FQX4B-msC&amp;pg=PA48|isbn=978-0-415-13036-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The 'broadcast ban' on Sinn Fein|publisher=BBC News |first=Francis|last=Welch|date=5 April 2005|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4409447.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BBC Trust===
{{Main|BBC Trust}}

The BBC Trust was formed on 1 January 2007, replacing the [[Board of Governors of the BBC|Board of Governors]] as the governing body of the Corporation. The Trust sets the strategy for the corporation, assesses the performance of the BBC Executive Board in delivering the BBC's services, and appoints the Director-General.

BBC Trustees are appointed by the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|British monarch]] on advice of government ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = How Trustees are appointed | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/about/who_we_are/trustees/appointment.shtml | author=BBC | accessdate =2 September 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091009135601/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/about/who_we_are/trustees/appointment.shtml| archivedate= 9 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are currently ten trustees with two vacancies, headed by the Chairman, [[Chris Patten|Lord Patten of Barnes]] and the vice-chairman [[Diane Coyle]].

|below=List of BBC [[Director-General of the BBC|Director Generals]]}}

The Executive Board is responsible for operational management and delivery of services within a framework set by the BBC Trust, and is headed by the Director-General, [[George Entwistle]], who was appointed on 17 September 2012. The Executive Board consists of both Executive and Non-Executive directors, with non-executive directors being sourced from other companies and corporations and being appointed by the [[BBC Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | title = About the BBC – Executive Board Biographies  | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/running/executive  | author=BBC  | accessdate =11 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The executive board is made up of the Director General as well as the head of each of the main BBC divisions, with the exception of the BBC North Group. These at present are [[Roger Mosey]], Acting Director of BBC Vision; [[Tim Davie]], Director of BBC Audio &amp; Music; [[Ralph Rivera]], Director of Future Media; [[Zarin Patel]], Chief Financial Officer; Lucy Adams, Director of Business Operations and [[Helen Boaden]], Director of News.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc executive board 2012&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Executive Board|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/insidethebbc/managementstructure/seniormanagement/|work=About the BBC|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these members, there are also five non-executive directors, these are currently [[Marcus Agius]], the senior non-executive director and Chairman of [[Barclays]]; Sally Davis, former CEO of BT Wholesale; [[Michael Richard Lynch|Dr Mike Lynch]] OBE, the co-founder and Chief Executive of [[Autonomy Corporation]]; Dame [[Fiona Reynolds]], Director-General of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]; [[Brian McBride (director)|Brian McBribe]], the former Managing Director of [[Amazon.com|Amazon.co.uk]] and [[Simon Burke]] the non-executive director.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc executive board 2012&quot;/&gt;

===Corporate structure===
The Corporation is headed by Director General's office, which has overall control of the management and running of the BBC. Below this is the BBC Direction Group, which deals with inter departmental issues and any other tasks which the Executive board has delegated to it. Below the BBC Direction Group are the following seven departments covering all the BBC's output:&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/running/bbcstructure/ bbc.co.uk About The BBC section] Retrieved 2011-07-09 18:58&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[BBC Vision]] is in charge of [[BBC Television]], of commissioning and producing television programming, of operations such as the [[BBC Natural History Unit]] and also includes the [[BBC Archives]].
#[[BBC Audio &amp; Music]] is in charge of [[BBC Radio]] and music content across the BBC, including the Music area of [[BBC Online]], music programmes on BBC Television, events such as the [[BBC Proms]] and the numerous [[BBC Orchestras and Singers|orchestras]] such as the [[BBC Philharmonic]].
#BBC Future Media is in charge of all digital output, such as [[BBC Online]], the [[BBC iPlayer]], [[BBC Red Button]] service and developing new technologies through [[BBC Research &amp; Development]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;
#BBC Operations includes the former BBC People department in charge of employees welfare, the Technologies department, previously part of BBC Future Media, and BBC Marketing, Communications and Audience. The department as a whole looks after the employees, the upkeep of the buildings, strategy, policy, project delivery, property, legal affairs, marketing and the normal day to day functioning of the corporation.
#BBC Finance &amp; Business manage the corporations expenses, long term business plans and licence fee collection. They also assign budgets to the different departments.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;
#BBC News Group operate the entire [[BBC News]] operation, including the national, regional and international operations. They are in charge of all Television, Radio and Online bulletins in all operations. They are in charge of [[BBC Scotland]], [[BBC Northern Ireland]], [[BBC Cymru Wales]] and the [[BBC English Regions]] and the BBC Global News division.
#The [[BBC North]] group includes all departments based at [[MediaCityUK]]. It organised the move to Salford, and contains departments such as [[BBC Sport]], [[CBBC|BBC Children's]], [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] as well as some sections of [[BBC Learning]]. Many of the departments in this section belong to other departments too, such as [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] which is also part of BBC Audio &amp; Music.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

All aspects of the BBC fall into one or more of the above departments, with the following exceptions:
*The [[BBC Trust]] is separate from departments as it is part of their operation to monitor the operations and departments of the corporation. The other three departments are stand-alone, due to their commercial nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;
*[[BBC Worldwide]] Ltd. operates international channels and exploits programme brands to gain addition income for BBC programmes. The [[BBC World News]] department is distributed by BBC Worldwide, but still separate. It has close links with the BBC News group, but is not governed by it.
*[[BBC Studios and Post Production]] is also separate and officially owns and operates some of the BBC's facilities, such as [[BBC Television Centre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

==Finances==
The BBC has the second largest budget of any UK-based broadcaster with an operating expenditure of £4.808&amp;nbsp;billion in 2011/12&lt;ref name=&quot;Annual Report 2011/12 (2-62)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The BBC Executive's Review and Assessment|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/annualreport/pdf/bbc_executive_2011_12.pdf|work=Annual Report 2011/12|publisher=BBC|accessdate=16 July 2012|pages=2–62|date=16 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared to £5.9&amp;nbsp;billion for [[British Sky Broadcasting]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Preliminary Results 2009 | url = http://corporate.sky.com/documents/pdf/press_releases/FY_0809_Press_Release

===Revenue===
{{See also|Television licence|Television licensing in the United Kingdom}}

The principal means of funding the BBC is through the television licence, costing £145.50 per year per household since April 2010. Such a licence is required to receive broadcast television across Britain, however no licence is required to own a television used for other means, or for sound only radio sets (though a separate licence for these was also required for non-TV households until 1971). The cost of a television licence is set by the government and enforced by the criminal law. A discount is available for households with only black-and-white television sets. A 50% discount is also offered to registered blind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/check-if-you-need-one/for-your-home/blindseverely-sight-impaired-aud5/ |title=Blind/severely sight impaired |publisher=TV Licensing |date=1 April 2000 |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the UK Government's recent spending review, an agreement has been reached between the government and the corporation in which the current licence fee will remain frozen at the current level until the Royal Charter is renewed at the beginning of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mark Thompson increases BBC budget cuts by 4%|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12190540|accessdate=16 July 2012|newspaper=BBC News|date=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revenue is collected privately and is paid into the central government [[Consolidated Fund]], a process defined in the [[Communications Act 2003]]. This ''TV Licensing'' collection is currently carried out by Capita, an outside agency. Funds are then allocated by the Department of Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) and the Treasury and approved by Parliament via legislation. Additional revenues are paid by the Department for Work and Pensions to compensate for subsidised licences for eligible over-75-year-olds.

Income from commercial enterprises and from overseas sales of its catalogue of programmes has substantially increased over recent years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Annual Report and Accounts 2004–2005 | url = http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/annualreport/pdf/2004-05/bbc_2004_05.pdf | author=BBC | format = PDF | page = 94 | accessdate=16 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[BBC Worldwide]] contributing some £145&amp;nbsp;million to the BBC's core public service business.

According to the BBC's 2011/12 Annual Report&lt;ref name=&quot;Annual Report 2011/12 (2-62)&quot;/&gt; its income can be broken down, as follows:

* £3,606.3&amp;nbsp;million in licence fees collected from householders;
* £222&amp;nbsp;million from BBC Commercial Businesses;
* £279.4&amp;nbsp;million from government grants;
* £271.9&amp;nbsp;million from other income, such as providing content to overseas broadcasters and concert ticket sales;

The licence fee has, however, attracted criticism. It has been argued that in an age of multi stream, multi-channel availability, an obligation to pay a licence fee is no longer appropriate. The BBC's use of private sector company [[Capita Group]] to send letters to premises not paying the licence fee has been criticised, especially as there have been cases where such letters have been sent to premises which are up to date with their payments, or do not require a TV licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/09/22/ftlicence22.xml | title = Why am I being hounded like this? | publisher=[[Telegraph]] | date = 22 September 2006 | accessdate =6 February 2008 | location=London | first=Simon | last=Heffer}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The BBC uses an advertising campaign to inform customers of the requirement to pay the licence fee. These letters and adverts have been criticised by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MPs [[Boris Johnson]] and [[Ann Widdecombe]], for having a threatening nature and language used to scare evaders into paying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2005/05/26/do2602.xml | title = I won't pay to be abused by the BBC | publisher=[[Telegraph]] | date =  26 May 2005 | accessdate =6 February 2008 | location=London | first=Boris | last=Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailyexpress.co.uk/posts/view/24455/BBC-bullies-shame-in-licence-fee-chaos | title = BBC bullies' shame in licence fee chaos |work=Daily Express  |location=UK | date =  7 November 2007 | accessdate =6 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audio clips and television broadcasts are used to inform listeners of the BBC's comprehensive database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/index.jsp | title = TV Licensing | publisher=[[TV Licensing]] | date =  2 June 2008 | accessdate =6 February 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080207185717/http://www.tvlicensing.co.uk/index.jsp| archivedate= 7 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are a number of pressure groups campaigning on the issue of the licence fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.spiderbomb.com/tv/ | title = Example of Licence Fee pressure group | publisher=[[Campaign to Abolish the Licence Fee]] | date =  2 June 2008 | accessdate =6 February 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080220031124/http://www.spiderbomb.com/tv/| archivedate= 20 February 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bbc broadcasting house front.jpg|thumb|150px|The headquarters of the BBC at [[Broadcasting House]] in [[Portland Place]], London, England]] 
[[File:MediaCity at night.jpg|thumb|200px|[[MediaCityUK]] in [[Salford Quays]], [[Greater Manchester]].]]
[[Broadcasting House]] in [[Portland Place]], London, is the official headquarters of the BBC. It is home to three of the ten BBC national radio networks, [[BBC Radio 3]], [[BBC Radio 4]], and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]]. On the front of the building are statues of [[Prospero]] and [[Ariel (The Tempest)|Ariel]], characters from [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest]]'', sculpted by [[Eric Gill]]. Renovation of Broadcasting House began in 2002 and is scheduled for completion in 2012. 

[[BBC Television]] and [[BBC News]] are currently based at [[BBC Television Centre]], a purpose built television facility and the second built in the country located in [[White City, London]]. This facility has been host to a number of famous guests and programmes through the years, and its name and image is familiar with many British citizens. Nearby, the [[BBC White City]] complex contains numerous programme offices, housed in Centre House, the Media Centre and Broadcast Centre. It is in this area around [[Shepherd's Bush]] that the majority of BBC employees work.

As part of a major reorganisation of BBC property, the entire BBC News operation is expected to relocate from the News Centre at [[BBC Television Centre]] to the refurbished Broadcasting House to create what is being described as &quot;one of the world's largest live broadcast centres&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = New Broadcasting House – The future | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/broadcastinghouse/thefuture/bh_project.shtml | author=BBC | accessdate =6 July 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060521230740/http://www.bbc.co.uk/broadcastinghouse/thefuture/bh_project.shtml| archivedate= 21 May 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following completion Broadcasting House will also be home to most of the BBC's national radio stations, and the [[BBC World Service]]. The major part of this plan involves the demolition of the two post-war extensions to the building and construction of an extension&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = New Broadcasting House | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/broadcastinghouse/timeline/index.shtml | author=BBC | accessdate =16 September 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091005184252/http://www.bbc.co.uk/broadcastinghouse/timeline/index.shtml| archivedate= 5 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed by [[Richard MacCormac|Sir Richard MacCormac]] of [[MJP Architects]]. This move will concentrate the BBC's London operations, allowing them to sell [[Television Centre]], which is expected to be completed by 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC News Article - TV Centre up for sale&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=BBC|title=BBC Television Centre up for sale|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13746250|accessdate=11 July 2011|newspaper=BBC News |date=13 June 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110720070550/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13746250| archivedate= 20 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the scheme above, the BBC is in the process of making and producing more programmes outside of London. This involves producing more programmes at production centres such as [[BBC Northern Ireland|Belfast]], [[BBC Scotland|Glasgow]], [[BBC Cymru Wales|Cardiff]] and, most notably, Manchester. As part of the scheme, several departments, including [[BBC North West]], [[BBC Sports]], [[CBBC|BBC Children's]], [[BBC Radio 5 Live|Radio 5 Live]], [[BBC Breakfast]] and the [[BBC Philharmonic]] moved from their previous locations in either London or [[New Broadcasting House]], Manchester, to the [[MediaCityUK]] development in [[City of Salford|Salford]]. [[MediaCityUK]] will therefore become the biggest staffing operation outside London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = BBC Salford move gets green light | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/6708383.stm | author=[[BBC News Online]] | date = 31 May 2007 | accessdate =31 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC North Website&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=BBC|title=BBC North|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/aboutthebbc/bbcnorth/index.shtml|publisher=BBC |accessdate=11 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as the two main sites in London (Broadcasting House and White City), there are seven other major BBC production centres in the UK, mainly specialising in different productions. [[Broadcasting House (Cardiff)|Broadcasting House Cardiff]], has been home to [[BBC Cymru Wales]], which specialises in drama production.  Open since October 2011, and containing 7 new studios, Roath Lock&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roathlock.com/ |title=Roath Lock studios |publisher=Roathlock.com |accessdate=29 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is notable as the home of productions such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]''. [[Broadcasting House (Belfast)|Broadcasting House Belfast]], home to [[BBC Northern Ireland]], specialises in original drama and comedy, and has taken part in many co-productions with independent companies and notably with [[RTÉ]] in the Republic of Ireland. [[BBC Scotland]], based in [[BBC Pacific Quay|Pacific Quay, Glasgow]] is a large producer of programmes for the network, including several quiz shows. In England, the larger regions also produce some programming. 

Previously, the largest 'hub' of BBC programming from the [[BBC English Regions|regions]] is [[BBC North West]]. At present they produce all Religious and Ethical programmes on the BBC, as well as other programmes such as ''[[A Question of Sport]]'', however this is to be merged and expanded under the [[BBC North]] project, which involved the region moving from [[New Broadcasting House]], Manchester, to [[MediaCityUK]]. [[BBC West Midlands|BBC Midlands]], based at [[The Mailbox]] in Birmingham, also produces drama and contains the headquarters for the [[BBC English Regions|English regions]] and the BBC's daytime output. Other production centres include [[Broadcasting House (Bristol)|Broadcasting House Bristol]], home of [[BBC West]] and famously the [[BBC Natural History Unit]] and to a lesser extent, [[Quarry Hill, Leeds|Quarry Hill]] in Leeds, home of [[BBC Yorkshire]]. There are also many smaller local and regional studios throughout the UK, operating the BBC regional television services and the [[BBC Local Radio]] stations.

The BBC also operates several news gathering centres in various locations around the world, which provide news coverage of that region to the national and international news operations.

{{Main|BBC Television}}

The BBC operates several television channels in the UK of which [[BBC One]] and [[BBC Two]] are the flagship television channels. In addition to these two flagship channels, the BBC operates several [[digital television|digital]] only stations: [[BBC Three]], [[BBC Four]], [[BBC News (TV channel)|BBC News]], [[BBC Parliament]], and two children's channels, [[CBBC Channel|CBBC]] and [[CBeebies]]. Digital television is now in widespread use in the UK, with analogue transmission being phased out by December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = BBC News Report | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6453087.stm | date = 15 March 2007 | accessdate =15 March 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070317195832/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6453087.stm| archivedate= 17 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC One is a regionalised TV service which provides opt-outs throughout the day for local news and other local programming. These variations are more pronounced in the BBC 'Nations', i.e. [[BBC Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]], [[BBC Scotland|Scotland]] and [[BBC Wales|Wales]], where the presentation is mostly carried out locally on BBC One and Two, and where programme schedules can vary largely from that of the network. BBC Two variations exist in the Nations, however [[BBC English Regions|English regions]] today rarely have the option to 'opt out' as regional programming now only exists on BBC One, and regional opt outs are not possible in the regions that have already undertaken the switch to digital television. BBC Two was also the first channel to be transmitted on 625 lines in 1964, then carry a small-scale regular colour service from 1967. BBC One would follow in November 1969.

A new [[Scottish Gaelic]] television channel, [[BBC Alba (TV channel)|BBC Alba]], was launched in September 2008. It is also the first multi-genre channel to come entirely from Scotland with almost all of its programmes made in Scotland. The service was initially only available via [[Satellite television|satellite]] but since June 2011 has been available to viewers in Scotland on [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] and cable television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = BBC Alba Freeview date unveiled | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-13479551 | date = 23 May 2011 | accessdate=28 July 2011 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC also has a [[High-definition television|HD]] channel, [[BBC HD]], that launched on 9 June 2006 following a 12 month trial of the broadcasts. It became a proper channel in 2007, and screens HD programmes as simulcasts of the main network, or as repeats. The corporation has been producing programmes in the format for many years, and stated that it hoped to produce 100% of new programmes in HDTV by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = BBC Press Release: ''BBC to trial High Definition broadcasts in 2006'' | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2005/11_november/08/hdtv.shtml | date = 8 November 2005 | accessdate=7 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 November 2010, a high-definition simulcast of BBC One was launched, entitled [[BBC One HD]]. 

In the Republic of Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands and Switzerland, the BBC channels are available in a number of ways. In these countries digital and cable operators carry a range of BBC channels these include BBC One, BBC Two and BBC World News, although viewers in the Republic of Ireland may receive BBC services via 'overspill' from transmitters in Northern Ireland or Wales, or via 'deflectors' – transmitters in the Republic which rebroadcast broadcasts from the UK, received off-air, or from digital satellite.

Since 1975, the BBC has also provided its TV programmes to the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]] (BFBS), allowing members of [[Military of the United Kingdom|UK military]] serving abroad to watch and listen to them on two dedicated TV channels.

Since 2008, all the BBC channels are available to watch online through the [[BBC iPlayer]] service. This online streaming ability came about following experiments with live streaming, involving streaming certain channels in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/11_november/19/simulcast.shtml |title=BBC One and BBC Two to be simulcast from 27 November |publisher=BBC |date=19 November 2008 |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|BBC Radio|BBC Local Radio}}

The BBC has ten national radio stations, six stations serving the BBC Regions and numerous others covering the Local regions in England. Of the ten national stations, five are major stations and are available on [[FM broadcasting|FM]], [[Digital radio in the United Kingdom|DAB]] and online. These are [[BBC Radio 1]], offering new music and popular styles and being notable for its chart show; [[BBC Radio 2]], playing [[Adult contemporary music|Adult contemporary]], country and soul music amongst many other genres; [[BBC Radio 3]], playing classical and jazz music and home to the [[BBC Proms]]; [[BBC Radio 4]], offering current affairs, factual, drama and comedy speech programmes and [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], broadcasting 24 hour news, sport and talk programmes. 

In addition to these five stations, the BBC also runs five additional stations that broadcast on DAB and online only. These stations supplement and expand on the big five stations, and were launched in 2002. [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] sisters Radio 1, and broadcasts new black music and urban tracks. [[BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra]] sisters 5 Live and offers extra sport analysis, including broadcasting sports that previously were not covered. [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] offers alternative music genres and is notable as a platform for new artists. 

[[BBC Radio 7]], later renamed [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]], provided archive drama, comedy and children's programming. Following the change to Radio 4 Extra, the service has dropped a defined children's strand in favour of family-friendly drama and comedy. In addition, new programmes to complement Radio 4 programmes were introduced such as ''[[Ambridge Extra]]'', and ''Desert Island Discs revisited''. The final station is the [[BBC Asian Network]], providing music, talk and news to this section of the community. This station evolved out of Local radio stations serving certain areas, and as such this station is available on [[Medium Wave]] frequency in some areas of the Midlands.

As well as the national stations, the BBC also provides regional stations. In the 'Nations', six stations serve large areas of these regions. In Scotland, these are [[BBC Radio Scotland]] and [[BBC Radio nan Gaidheal]], the latter providing programmes in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scots Gaelic]]; in Wales these are [[BBC Radio Wales]] and [[BBC Radio Cymru]], the latter providing programming in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and in Northern Ireland there is [[BBC Radio Ulster]] with an opt out for the North West called [[BBC Radio Foyle]]. Furthermore, there are 40 [[BBC Local Radio]] stations in England and the Channel Islands, usually covering specific cities and their surrounding areas (Such as [[BBC Radio Bristol]]), for counties, or regions (Such as [[BBC Three Counties Radio]]), or geographic features (Such as [[BBC Radio Solent]] covering the South Coast).

As part of BBC Local Radio, the BBC also serves the [[Channel Islands]], which strictly speaking are not part of the United Kingdom, through its [[Spotlight (BBC South West News)#BBC Channel Islands|TV News service]] and [[BBC Guernsey]] and [[BBC Radio Jersey]]. These services are funded from locally collected licence fees. However, despite this, the BBC does not offer Local Radio for the [[Isle of Man]], primarily because the island has been served by the popular and long lasting independent commercial station, [[Manx Radio]].

For a worldwide audience, the [[BBC World Service]] provides news, current affairs and information in 28 languages, including English, around the world and is available in over 150 capital cities. It is broadcast worldwide on [[shortwave]] radio, DAB and online and has an estimated weekly audience of 180 million listeners. Since 2005, it is also available on DAB in the UK, a step not taken before, due to the way it is funded. The service is funded by a Parliamentary Grant-in-Aid, administered by the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]], however following the Governments spending review in 2011, this funding will cease, and it will be funded for the first time through the Licence fee.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC World Service Annual Review 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=BBC|title=BBC World Service Annual Review 2009–2010|url=http://downloads.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/pdf/bbc_world_service_annual_review_0910.pdf|work=Annual Review|publisher=BBC World Service|accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;World Service Finance details&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=BBC World Servce|title=How BBC World Service is run|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/institutional/2009/03/000000_ws_run.shtml|publisher=BBC |accessdate=12 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, some services of the World Service have been reduced; the [[Thai language|Thai]] service ended in 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= BBC Thai service ends broadcasts| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4609860.stm | author=Clare Harkey | date = 13 March 2006 | accessdate =8 November 2008 |publisher=BBC News | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081218021705/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4609860.stm| archivedate= 18 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did the Eastern European languages, with resources diverted instead into the new [[BBC Arabic Television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = BBC Arabic TV appoints former Al Jazeera employee as news editor | url = http://www.metimes.com/articles/normal.php?StoryID=20060315-071402-4650r | author=Middle East Times | authorlink = Middle East Times | date = 15 March 2006 | accessdate =6 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the BBC was the only legal radio broadcaster based in the UK mainland until 1967, when [[URY|University Radio York (URY)]], then under the name ''Radio York'', was launched as the first, and now oldest, legal independent radio station in the country. However, the BBC did not enjoy a complete monopoly before this as several Continental stations, such as [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]], broadcast programmes in English to Britain since the 1930s and the Isle of Man based [[Manx Radio]] began in 1964. Today, the BBC still has some of the most popular Radio stations, with BBC Radio 2 being the most popular of the network and the most popular in the country, with 12.9&amp;nbsp;million weekly listeners in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Quarterly Summary of Radio Listening – Quarter 1 2006 – National Stations | url = http://www.rajar.co.uk/quarterlysummary/qstsvfiles/135/Q12006National.pdf | author=RAJAR | authorlink = RAJAR | format = PDF | date = 11 May 2006 | accessdate=6 July 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060723051549/http://www.rajar.co.uk/quarterlysummary/qstsvfiles/135/Q12006National.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 23 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC Programming is also available to other services and in other countries. Since 1943, the BBC has provided radio programming to the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service]], which broadcasts in countries where British troops are stationed. [[BBC Radio 1]] is also carried in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] on [[Sirius XM Radio]] (online streaming only). 

The BBC is a patron of The [[Radio Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;The Radio Academy [http://www.radioacademy.org/about/patrons/ &quot;Patrons&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this, news stories are available on the [[BBC Red Button]] service, [[Ceefax]] and [[BBC News Online]]. In addition to this, the BBC has been developing new ways to access BBC News, as a result has launched the service on BBC Mobile, making it accessible to mobile phones and PDAs, as well as developing alerts by e-mail, digital television, and on computers through a desktop alert.

Ratings figures suggest that during major crises such as the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] or a Royal Event, the UK audience overwhelmingly turns to the BBC's coverage as opposed to its commercial rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Cozens | first = Claire  | title = BBC news ratings double |work=The Guardian  |location=UK | date = 8 July 2005 | url = http://media.guardian.co.uk/overnights/story/0,,1524235,00.html | accessdate =25 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 7 July 2005, the day that there were a series of coordinated bomb blasts on London's public transport system, the [[BBC Online]] website recorded an all time [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] peak of 11&amp;nbsp;[[gigabit|Gb]]/s at 12:00 on 7 July. BBC News received some 1&amp;nbsp;billion total hits on the day of the event (including all images, text and [[HTML]]), serving some 5.5 [[terabyte]]s of data. At peak times during the day there were 40,000 page requests per second for the BBC News website. The previous day's announcement of the [[2012 Olympics]] being awarded to London caused a peak of around 5&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s. The previous all time high at [[BBC Online]] was caused by the announcement of the [[Michael Jackson]] verdict, which used 7.2&amp;nbsp;Gbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Statistics on BBC Webservers 7&amp;nbsp;July 2005 | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/feedback/07July_Statistics.shtml | author=BBC | accessdate =13 November 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061012141440/http://www.bbc.co.uk/feedback/07July_Statistics.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 12 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC's online presence includes a comprehensive [[BBC News Online|news website]] and archive. It was launched as BBC Online, before being renamed BBCi, then bbc.co.uk, before it was rebranded back as BBC Online. The website is funded by the Licence fee, but uses [[Geo targeting|GeoIP]] technology, allowing advertisements to be carried on the site when viewed outside of the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6385175.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; BBC keeps web adverts on agenda |publisher=BBC News |date=22 February 2007 |accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC claims the site to be &quot;Europe's most popular content-based site&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = bbc.co.uk Commissioning | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/newmedia/websites.shtml | accessdate =6 July 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060706020809/http://www.bbc.co.uk/commissioning/newmedia/websites.shtml| archivedate= 6 July 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and states that 13.2&amp;nbsp;million people in the UK visit the site's more than two million pages each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = bbc.co.uk Key Facts | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/website.shtml | accessdate =6 July 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060524233844/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/website.shtml| archivedate= 24 May 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Alexa Internet|Alexa's]] TrafficRank system, in July 2008 BBC Online was the 27th most popular English Language website in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Top English-language Sites | url=http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_sites?ts_mode=lang&amp;lang=en | author=Alexa | authorlink = Alexa Internet | accessdate=12 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 46th most popular overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Global Top 500 Sites | url = http://www.alexa.com/site/ds/top_sites?ts_mode=global&amp;lang=none | author=Alexa | authorlink = Alexa Internet | accessdate=12 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another large part of the site also allows users to watch and listen to most Television and Radio output live and for seven days after broadcast using the [[BBC iPlayer]] platform, which launched on 27 July 2007, and initially used [[peer-to-peer]] and [[Digital rights management|DRM]] technology to deliver both radio and TV content of the last seven days for offline use for up to 30&amp;nbsp;days, since then video is now streamed directly. Also, through participation in the [[Creative Archive Licence]] group, bbc.co.uk allowed legal downloads of selected archive material via the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/01_january/03/archive.shtml | title = BBC Press Release: ''BBC News opens its archives for the first time'' | date = 3 January 2006 | accessdate=3 October 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060903045904/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/01_january/03/archive.shtml| archivedate= 3 September 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The BBC has often included learning as part of its online service, running services such as [[BBC Jam]], [[BBC Learning Zone|Learning Zone Class Clips]] and also runs services such as [[BBC WebWise]] and First Click which are designed to teach people how to use the internet. [[BBC Jam]] was a free online service, delivered through broadband and narrowband connections, providing high-quality interactive resources designed to stimulate learning at home and at school. Initial content was made available in January 2006 however BBC Jam was suspended on 20 March 2007 due to allegations made to the [[European Commission]] that it was damaging the interests of the commercial sector of the industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/news/press_releases/14_03_2007.html|title=BBC Trust suspends BBC Jam|publisher=[[BBC Trust]]|date=14 March 2007|accessdate=5 February 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080126171441/http://www.bbc.co.uk/bbctrust/news/press_releases/14_03_2007.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 26 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years some major on-line companies and politicians have complained that BBC Online receives too much funding from the television licence, meaning that other websites are unable to compete with the vast amount of advertising-free on-line content available on BBC Online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Department of Culture, Media and Sport: Independent Review of BBC Online, pp41-58 | url = http://www.culture.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/45F9953F-CE61-4325-BEA6-400DF9722494/0/BBCOnlinereview.pdf | last = Graf | first = Philip | format = PDF | accessdate =6 July 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060723051550/http://www.culture.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/45F9953F-CE61-4325-BEA6-400DF9722494/0/BBCOnlinereview.pdf| archivedate= 23 July 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have proposed that the amount of licence fee money spent on BBC Online should be reduced—either being replaced with funding from advertisements or subscriptions, or a reduction in the amount of content available on the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=British Internet Publishers Alliance | title = BIPA Response to Review of the BBC’s Royal Charter | url = http://www.bipa.co.uk/getArticle.php?ID=325 | date = 31 May 2005 | accessdate =6 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this the BBC carried out an investigation, and has now set in motion a plan to change the way it provides its online services. BBC Online will now attempt to fill in gaps in the market, and will guide users to other websites for currently existing market provision. (For example, instead of providing local events information and timetables, users will be guided to outside websites already providing that information.)
Part of this plan included the BBC closing some of its websites, and rediverting money to redevelop other parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Public value key to BBC websites |publisher=BBC News  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3992875.stm | date = 8 November 2004 | accessdate =6 July 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060616150109/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/3992875.stm| archivedate= 16 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article1219009.ece|title=99 per cent of the BBC archives is on the shelves.

On 26 February 2010 [[The Times]] claimed that [[Mark Thompson (television executive)|Mark Thompson]], Director General of the BBC, proposed that the BBC's web output should be cut by 50%, with online staff numbers and budgets reduced by 25% in a bid to scale back BBC operations and allow commercial rivals more room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article7041944.ece &quot;BBC signals an end to era of expansion&quot;] 26 February 2010 Retrieved 26 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  On 2 March 2010, the BBC reported that it will cut its website spending by 25% and close BBC 6 Music and Asian Network, as part of Mark Thompson's plans to make &quot; a smaller, fitter BBC for the digital age&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/03/business/media/03bbc.html &quot;BBC Proposes Deep Cuts in Web Site&quot;] 2 March 2010 Retrieved 2 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/8544150.stm &quot;BBC 6 Music and Asian Network face axe in shake-up&quot;] 2 March 2010 Retrieved 2 March 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interactive television===
{{Main|BBC Red Button}}
BBC Red Button is the brand name for the BBC's [[Interactive television|interactive]] [[digital television]] services, which are available through [[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]] (digital terrestrial), as well as [[Freesat]], [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky]] (satellite), and [[Virgin Media]] (cable). Unlike [[Ceefax]], the service's analogue counterpart, BBC Red Button is able to display full-colour graphics, photographs, and video, as well as programmes and can be accessed from any BBC channel. The service carries News, Weather and Sport 24 hours a day, but also provides extra features related to programmes specific at that time. Examples include viewers to play along at home to gameshows, to give, voice and vote on opinions to issues, as used alongside programmes such as ''[[Question Time]]''. At some points in the year, when multiple sporting events occur, some coverage of less mainstream sports or games are frequently placed on the Red Button for viewers to watch. Frequently, other features are added unrelated to programmes being broadcast at that time, such as the broadcast of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' animated episode ''[[Dreamland (Doctor Who)|Dreamland]]'' in November 2009.

===Music===
[[File:BBC Big Band - Town Hall Birmingham - May 2012.jpg|thumb|The [[BBC Big Band]]]]
The BBC employs staff orchestras, a choir, and supports two amateur choruses, based in BBC venues across the UK; the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], the [[BBC Singers]], [[BBC Symphony Chorus]] and [[BBC Big Band]] based in London, the [[BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra]] in Glasgow, the [[BBC Philharmonic]] in Manchester, the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] based in Watford and the [[BBC National Orchestra of Wales]] in Cardiff. It also buys a selected number of broadcasts from the [[Ulster Orchestra]] in Belfast. Many famous musicians of every genre have played at the BBC, such as The Beatles (''The Beatles Live at the BBC'' is one of their many albums). The BBC is also responsible for the United Kingdom coverage of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], a show with which the broadcaster has been associated for over 50 years.

===Other===
The BBC operates in other ventures in addition to their broadcasting arm. In addition to broadcasting output on television and radio, some programmes are also displayed on the [[BBC Big Screen]]s located in several central city locations. The BBC and the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] also jointly run [[BBC Monitoring]], which monitors radio, television, the press and the internet worldwide. The BBC also developed several computers throughout the 1980s, most notably the [[BBC Micro]], which ran alongside the corporation's educational aims and programming.

In 1951, in conjunction with [[Oxford University Press]] the BBC published ''The BBC Hymn Book'' which was intended to be used for listeners on the radio, to follow hymns which were broadcast.  The book was published both with and without music, the music edition being entitled ''The BBC Hymn Book with Music''.&lt;ref&gt;British Broadcasting Corporation (1969) ''The BBC Hymn Book with Music''  London: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The book contained 542 popular hymns

==Commercial activities==
{{Main|BBC Worldwide}}
BBC Worldwide Limited is the wholly owned commercial subsidiary of the BBC responsible for the commercial exploitation of BBC programmes and other properties, including a number of television stations throughout the world. It was formed following the restructuring of its predecessor, BBC Enterprises, in 1995.

The company owns and administers a number of commercial stations around the world operating in a number of territories and on a number of different platforms. The channel [[BBC Entertainment]] shows current and archive entertainment programming to viewers in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East, with the BBC Worldwide channels [[BBC America]] and [[BBC Canada]] (Joint venture with [[Shaw Media]]) showing similar programming in the North America region and [[UKTV (Australia and New Zealand)|UKTV]] in the Australasia region. The company also airs two channels aimed at children, an international [[CBeebies]] channel and [[BBC Kids]], a joint venture with [[Knowledge (TV channel)|Knowledge Network Corporation]], which airs programmes under the CBeebies and BBC K brands. The company also runs the channels [[BBC Knowledge (Worldwide)|BBC Knowledge]], broadcasting factual and learning programmes, and [[BBC Lifestyle]], broadcasting programmes based on themes of Food, Style and Wellbeing. In addition to this, BBC Worldwide runs an internation version of the channel [[BBC HD Scandinavia|BBC HD]], and provides HD simulcasts of the channels BBC Knowledge and BBC America.

BBC Worldwide also distributes the 24-hour international news channel [[BBC World News]]. The station is separate from BBC Worldwide to maintain the station's neutral point of view, but is distributed by BBC Worldwide. The channel itself is the oldest surviving entity of its kind, and has bases and correspondents in over 200 countries. As officially surveyed it is available to more than 274&amp;nbsp;million households, significantly more than [[CNN]]'s estimated 200&amp;nbsp;million.

In addition to these international channels, BBC Worldwide also owns, together with [[Scripps Networks Interactive]], the [[UKTV]] network of ten channels. These channels contain BBC archive programming to be rebroadcast on their respective channels: [[Alibi (TV channel)|Alibi]], drama; [[Blighty (TV channel)|Blighty]], British-oriented; [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] (slogan: &quot;The Home of Witty Banter&quot;); [[Eden (TV channel)|Eden]], nature; [[Gold (TV channel)|Gold]], comedy; [[Good Food]], cookery; [[Home (TV channel)|Home]], home and garden; [[Really (TV channel)|Really]], female programming; [[Watch (TV channel)|Watch]], entertainment and [[Yesterday (TV channel)|Yesterday]], history programming.

In addition to these channels, many BBC programmes are sold via BBC Worldwide to foreign television stations with comedy, documentaries and [[Costume drama|historical drama]] productions being the most popular. In addition, BBC television news appears nightly on many [[Public Broadcasting Service]] stations in the United States, as do reruns of BBC programmes such as ''[[EastEnders]]'', and in New Zealand on [[TV One (New Zealand)|TV One]].

In addition to programming, BBC Worldwide produces material to accompany programmes. The company maintained the publishing arm of the BBC, and is currently the third-largest publisher of consumer magazines in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Annual Review 2001 | url = http://www.bbcworldwide.com/annualreviews/review2001/magazines2.html | author=BBC Worldwide | authorlink = BBC Worldwide | accessdate =14 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC Magazines]], formerly known as BBC Publications, publishes the ''[[Radio Times]]'' as well as a number of magazines that support BBC programming such as ''[[Top Gear (magazine)|BBC Top Gear]]'', ''BBC Good Food'', ''[[The Sky at Night|BBC Sky at Night]]'', ''[[BBC History (magazine)|BBC History]]'', ''[[BBC Wildlife]]'' and ''[[BBC Music Magazine|BBC Music]]''. This department included independent magazine publisher Origin Publishing, which BBC Worldwide owned between 2004 and 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Origin Publishing | url=http://www.originpublishing.co.uk/ | accessdate=31 December 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061231024723/http://www.originpublishing.co.uk/| archivedate= 31 December 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BBC Worldwide also publishes books, to accompany programmes such as ''[[Doctor Who]]'' under the [[BBC Books]] brand, and also owns the biggest travel guidebook and digital media publisher in the world, [[Lonely Planet]]. Soundtrack albums, talking books and sections of radio broadcasts are also sold under the brand [[BBC Records]], with DVD's also being sold and licensed in large quantities to consumers both in the UK and abroad under the [[2 Entertain]] brand. Archive programming and classical music recordings are sold under the brand BBC Legends.

==Unions==
Staff at the BBC are normally represented by [[BECTU]], along with journalistic staff by the [[National Union of Journalists|NUJ]] and electrical staff by [[Unite (trade union)|Unite]]. Union membership is optional, and is paid for by staff members, not by the BBC; staff are not automatically covered by a union.

==Cultural significance==
Until the development, popularisation, and domination of television, radio was the broadcast medium upon which people in the United Kingdom relied. It &quot;reached into every home in the land, and simultaneously united the nation, an important factor during the Second World War&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Perry | first = George | title = The Life of Python | year = 1999 | publisher=Pavilion Books | location = London | isbn = 1-85793-441-5 | page = 14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC introduced the world's first &quot;high-definition&quot; [[405-line television system|405-line television]] service in 1936, and apart from suspending service throughout World War II until 1946, was the only television broadcaster in the UK until 1955. &quot;The BBC's monopoly was broken in 1955, with the introduction of Independent Television ([[ITV]])&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry16&quot;&gt;Perry (1999) p16&lt;/ref&gt; This heralded the transformation of television into a popular and dominant medium. Nevertheless, &quot;throughout the 1950s radio still remained the dominant source of broadcast comedy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry16&quot; /&gt; Further, the BBC was the only legal radio broadcaster until 1968 (when [[URY]] obtained their first licence).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ury.york.ac.uk/about.php|title=URY History|accessdate=21 November 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081006220201/http://ury.york.ac.uk/about.php| archivedate= 6 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even since the advent of commercial television and radio, the BBC has remained one of the main elements in British popular culture through its obligation to produce TV and radio programmes for mass audiences.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} However, the arrival of BBC2 allowed the BBC also to make programmes for minority interests in drama, documentaries, current affairs, entertainment and sport. Examples are cited such as ''[[I, Claudius (TV series)|I, Claudius]]'', ''[[Civilisation (TV series)|Civilisation]]'', ''[[Tonight (1957 TV series)|Tonight]]'', ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Pot Black]]'', but other examples can be given in each of these fields as shown by the BBC's entries in the [[British Film Institute]]'s 2000 list of the [[100 Greatest British Television Programmes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tv100&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/list.php|title=The BFI TV 100: 1–100|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|year=2000|accessdate=23 February 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070223104219/http://www.bfi.org.uk/features/tv/100/list/list.php| archivedate= 23 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The export of BBC programmes through both services like the [[BBC World Service]] and [[BBC World News]], as well as the channels operated by [[BBC Worldwide]] mean that BBC productions can now be experienced worldwide. 

The term [[BBC English]] (Received Pronunciation) refers to the former use of [[Standard English]] with this accent. However, the organisation now makes more use of [[Regional accents of English speakers|regional accents]] in order to reflect the diversity of the UK, though clarity and fluency are still expected of presenters.&lt;ref name=&quot;accents&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/289882.stm|title=Speaking out for regional accents|accessdate=26 January 2009 |publisher=BBC News  | date=3 March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; From its &quot;starchy&quot; beginnings, the BBC has also become more inclusive, and now attempts to accommodate the interests of all strata of society and all minorities, because they all pay the licence fee.&lt;ref name=&quot;diversityPolicy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/policies/diversity.shtml|title=Diversity Policy|accessdate=26 January 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090207222149/http://www.bbc.co.uk/info/policies/diversity.shtml| archivedate= 7 February 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Competition from [[ITV|Independent Television]], [[Channel 4]], [[British Sky Broadcasting|Sky]] and other broadcast television stations, has lessened the BBC's influence, but such public broadcasting remains a major influence on British popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Attitudes toward the BBC in popular culture===
Older domestic UK audiences often refer to the BBC as &quot;the Beeb&quot;, a nickname originally dubbed by [[Peter Sellers]] in ''[[The Goon Show]]'' in the 1950s, when he referred to the &quot;Beeb Beeb Ceeb&quot;. It was then borrowed, shortened and popularised by [[Kenny Everett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/kenny_everett_page.htm | title = Radio Rewind: Kenny Everett | last = Davies | first= Alan | accessdate=10 May 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070501114549/http://www.radiorewind.co.uk/kenny_everett_page.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another nickname, now less commonly used, is &quot;Auntie&quot;, said to originate from the old-fashioned &quot;Auntie knows best&quot; attitude (but possibly a reference to the &quot;aunties&quot; and &quot;uncles&quot; who were presenters of children's programmes in early days)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BBC Press Release: ''Mark Thompson celebrates the official opening of a new state-of-the art BBC building in Hull'' |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/10_october/21/hull.shtml |date=21 October 2004 |accessdate=6 July 2006| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20060628183705/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2004/10_october/21/hull.shtml| archivedate= 28 June 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the days when [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]], the BBC's first director general, was in charge. The two nicknames have also been used together as &quot;Auntie Beeb&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Times Online: ''Auntie Beeb suffers a relapse'' |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article400120.ece |date=7 December 2004 |accessdate=12 February 2007 | location=London |work=The Times  }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Auntie has been used in out-take programmes such as ''[[Auntie's Bloomers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IMDB listing for ''Auntie's Big Bloomers''|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0159155/ |accessdate=7 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and controversies==
{{main|Criticism of the BBC|BBC controversies}}

That BBC has faced various accusations regarding the Iraq war, political, ethnic and religious, as well as funding and staffing. It also has been involved in numerous controversies regarding its coverage of specific news stories and programming.

===Child abuse===
On the 23 October 2012 [[George Entwhistle]] the BBC Director-General appeared before the [[Culture, Media and Sport Committee|Culture, Media and Sport Committee]] to answer questions following revelations in the [[Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal]] that Savile had abused children on BBC property while he worked for the BBC. When asked by Committee chairman, John Whittingdale if the BBC's reputation for trust and integrity were in jeopardy, Entwhistle stated that allegations of child abuse at the BBC were a &quot;very, very grave matter&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;http://news.sky.com/story/1001205/jimmy-savile-bbc-boss-is-grilled-by-mps&lt;/ref&gt;
