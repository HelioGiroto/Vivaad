[[File:LOGODIGIMON.jpg|right|frame|English version logo for Digimon.]]
{{nihongo|'''Digimon'''|デジモン|Dejimon|lead=yes}}, short for {{nihongo|&quot;Digital Monsters&quot;|デジタルモンスター|Dejitaru Monsutā}}, is a [[Japan]]ese [[media franchise]] encompassing digital toys, [[anime]], [[manga]], [[video game]]s and videos. The franchise's eponymous creatures are monsters of various forms living in a &quot;[[Digital World]]&quot;, a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] that originated from Earth's various [[Telecommunications network|communication networks]].

==Eponymous creatures==
Digimon hatch from eggs called {{nihongo|Digi-Eggs|デジタマ|Dejitama}}. In the [[English language|English]] [[iteration]]s of the franchise there is another type of [[Digi-Eggs|Digi-Egg]] that can be used to digivolve, or transform, Digimon. This second type of Digi-Egg is called a {{nihongo|Digimental|デジメンタル|Dejimentaru}} in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. They age via a process called &quot;Digivolution&quot; which changes their appearance and increases their powers. The effect of Digivolution, however, is not permanent in the partner Digimon of the main characters in the anime, and Digimon who have digivolved will most of the time revert back to their previous form after a battle or if they are too weak to continue. Some Digimon act feral. Most, however, possess large amounts of [[intelligence]] and human speech. They are able to digivolve by the use of Digivices that their human partners have. In some cases, as in the first series, the DigiDestined (known as the 'Chosen Children' in the original Japanese) had to find some special items such as crests and tags so the Digimon could digivolve into further stages of evolution known as ''Ultimate'' and ''Mega'' in the dub.

The first Digimon anime introduces the Digimon [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]: They age in a similar fashion to real organisms, but do not die under normal circumstances because they are made of reconfigurable data. Any Digimon that receives a fatal wound will dissolve into [[infinitesimal]] bits of data. The data then recomposes itself as a Digi-Egg, which will hatch when rubbed gently, and the Digimon goes through its life cycle again. Digimon who are reincarnated in this way will sometimes retain some or all their memories of their previous life. However, if a Digimon's data is completely destroyed, they will die.

==Virtual pet toy==
{{Main|Digital Monster (virtual pet)}}
Digimon started out as a [[digital pet]] called &quot;[[Digimon virtual pet|Digital Monster]]&quot;, similar in style and concept to the [[Tamagotchi]]. It was planned by [[Wiz (company)|Wiz]] and released by [[Bandai]] on June 26, 1997&lt;!--The earliest sources point to this as the date of release in Japan--&gt;. The toy began as the simple concept of a [[Tamagotchi]] mainly for boys. The V-Pet is similar to its predecessors, with the exceptions of being much harder and being able to connect to fight other Digimon v-pets. Every owner would start with a Baby Digimon, train it, evolve it, take care of it, and then have battles with other Digimon owners to see who was stronger. The Digimon pet had several evolution capabilities and abilities too, so many owners had many different Digimon. In December, the second generation of Digital Monster was released, followed by a third edition in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = What Is Digimon?|accessdate = September 5, 2006|url = http://shiningevo.ultmatedigimon.com/wit.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anime meta-series==
On March 6, 1999, the franchise was given an anime as the first of the ''Digimon'' [[Film|movies]] aired in [[theaters]] in Japan. Originally, the ''Digimon Adventure'' movie was supposed to be a short film, but after the storyboard was finished, a request for ''Digimon'' becoming a children's television show was made. On March 7, 1999, they began airing a television counterpart titled ''[[Digimon Adventure]]''.

Five more series would follow, most of them with their own tie-in movies, and the series was dubbed for release in western markets in the fall of the same year. The show spawned card games, with ''Hyper Colosseum'' in Japan and later ''Digi-Battle'' in America, and more video games. The animated series is easily the best-known segment of the Digimon universe and responsible for the majority of its popularity.

&quot;Digimon&quot; are &quot;[[Digital]] [[Monster]]s&quot;. According to the stories, they are inhabitants of the &quot;[[DigiWorld]]&quot;, a manifestation of Earth's communication network. The stories tell of a group of mostly pre-[[teen]]s, who accompany special Digimon born to defend their world (and ours) from various evil forces. To help them surmount the most difficult obstacles found within both realms, the Digimon have the ability to evolve ''([[Digivolution|Digivolve]])''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=TV.com |url=http://www.tv.com/shows/digimon-digital-monsters/ |title=Digimon: Digital Monsters |publisher=TV.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/29/tv/cover-story-masters-of-the-universe-youth-division.html | work=The New York Times | first=Laurel | last=Graeber | title=COVER STORY; Masters of the Universe, Youth Division | date=August 29, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, the Digimon change appearance and become much stronger,&lt;ref name=&quot;clements2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Jonathan|title=The Anime Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|location=California|isbn=1-933330-10-4|coauthors=McCarthy, Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; often changing in personality as well. The group of [[child]]ren who come in contact with the Digital World changes from series to series.

As of 2011, there have been six series— ''Digimon Adventure'', the follow-up sequel ''Digimon Adventure 02'', ''Digimon Tamers'', ''Digimon Frontier'', ''Digimon Data Squad'' and ''Digimon Fusion''. The first two series take place in the same fictional universe, but the third, fourth, fifth and sixth each occupy their own unique world (in the case of ''Digimon Tamers'', the ''Adventure'' universe is referred to as a television and commercial enterprise, as well as the appearance of [[Ryo Akiyama|one character]] hailing from the ''Adventure'' universe). In addition, each series has spawned assorted feature films. Digimon still shows popularity, as new card series, video games, and movies are still being produced and released: new card series include Eternal Courage, Hybrid Warriors, Generations, and Operation X; the video game, [[Digimon Rumble Arena 2]]; and the previously unreleased movies ''[[Digimon Adventure 02#Revenge of Diaboromon|Revenge of Diaboromon]]'', ''[[Digimon Tamers#Runaway Locomon|Runaway Locomon]]'', ''[[Minami Uehara|Battle of Adventurers]]'', and ''[[Island of Lost Digimon]]''. In Japan, ''[[Digital Monster X-Evolution]]'', the eighth TV movie, was {{when|date=April 2011}} released, and on December 23, 2005 at [[Jump Festa]] 2006, the fifth series, ''[[Digimon Data Squad|Digimon Savers]]'' was announced for Japan to begin airing after a three-year [[hiatus (television)|hiatus]] of the show. A sixth television series, ''[[Digimon Fusion|Digimon Xros Wars]]'', began airing in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-04-02/new-digital-monsters/digimon-tv-anime-listed |title=New Digital Monsters/Digimon TV Anime Listed |publisher=Anime News Network |date= |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed by a second season, which started on October 2, 2011 as a direct sequel to ''Digimon Xros Wars''.

''Digimon'' was produced by [[Toei Animation]] and Bandai of Japan. The series were broadcast in Japan by [[Fuji Television]]. The first four series were called ''Digimon: Digital Monsters'' in international markets, while ''Savers'' was released as ''Digimon Data Squad''.

===''Digimon Adventure'' (Series One)===
{{Main|Digimon Adventure}}
The first Digimon television series, which began airing on March 7, 1999 in Japan on [[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]] and [[Kids Station]] and on August 14, 1999 in the United States on [[Fox Kids]] dubbed by [[Saban Entertainment]] for the North American English version. Its premise is a group of seven kids who, while at summer camp, travel to the Digital World,&lt;ref name=&quot;clements2006&quot;/&gt; inhabited by creatures known as Digimon, learning they are chosen to be &quot;[[DigiDestined]]&quot;  (&quot;Chosen Children&quot; in the Japanese version) to save both the Digital and Real World from evil. Each Kid was given a Digivice which selected them to be transported to the DigiWorld and was destined to be paired up with a [[Chosen Digimon|Digimon Partner]], such as Tai being paired up with [[Agumon]] and Matt with [[Gabumon]]. The children are helped by a mysterious man/digimon named Gennai, who helps them via hologram. The Digivices help their Digimon allies to Digivolve into stronger creatures in times of peril. The Digimon usually reached higher forms when their human partners are placed in dangerous situations, such as fighting the evil forces of Devimon, Etemon and Myotismon in their Champion forms. Later, each character discovered a crest that each belonged to a person; Tai the Crest of Courage, Matt the Crest of Friendship, Sora the Crest of Love, Izzy the Crest of Knowledge, Mimi the Crest of Sincerity, Joe the Crest of Reliability, T.K. the Crest of Hope, and later Kari the Crest of Light which allowed their digimon the digivolve into their Ultimate form. The group consisted of seven original characters: [[Taichi &quot;Tai&quot; Kamiya]], [[Yamato &quot;Matt&quot; Ishida]], [[Sora Takenouchi]], [[Koushiro &quot;Izzy&quot; Izumi]], [[Mimi Tachikawa]], [[Joe Kido]], and [[Takeru &quot;T.K.&quot; Takaishi]]. Later on in the series, an eighth character was introduced: [[Hikari &quot;Kari&quot; Kamiya]] (who is Taichi's younger sister).&lt;ref name=&quot;clements2006&quot;/&gt;

===''Digimon Adventure 02'' (Series Two)===
{{Main|Digimon Adventure 02}}
The second Digimon series is direct continuation of the first one, and began airing on April 2, 2000. Three years later, with most of the original DigiDestined now in high school at age fourteen, the Digital World was supposedly secure and peaceful. However, a new evil has appeared in the form of the Digimon Emperor (Digimon Kaiser) who as opposed to previous enemies is a human just like the DigiDestined. The Digimon Emperor has been enslaving Digimon with Black Rings and Control Spires and has somehow made regular Digivolution impossible. However, five set Digi-Eggs with engraved emblems had been appointed to three new DigiDestined along with T.K. and Kari, two of the DigiDestined from the previous series. This new evolutionary process, dubbed Armor Digivolution, helps the new DigiDestined to defeat evil lurking in the Digital World. Eventually, the DigiDestined defeat the Digimon Emperor, more commonly known as [[Ken Ichijouji]] on Earth, (who is more or less a rival to Davis) only with the great sacrifice of Ken's own Digimon, Wormmon. Just when things were thought to be settled, new Digimon enemies made from the deactivated Control Spires start to appear and cause trouble in the Digital World. To atone for his past mistakes, Ken joins the DigiDestined, being a DigiDestined himself, with his Partner [[Wormmon]] revived to fight against them. They soon save countries including France and Australia from control spires and defeat MaloMyotismon (BelialVamdemon), the digivolved form of Myotismon (Vamdemon) from the previous series. They stop the evil from destroying the two worlds, and at the end every one has their own Digimon partner.

===''Digimon Tamers'' (Series Three)===
{{Main|Digimon Tamers}}
The third Digimon series, which began airing on April 1, 2001, is set largely in a &quot;real world&quot; where the ''Adventure'' and ''Adventure 02'' series are television shows, and where Digimon game merchandise (based on actual items) become key to provide power boosts to real Digimon which appeared in that world. The plot revolves around three Tamers, [[Takato Matsuki]], [[Rika Nonaka]], and [[Henry Wong]]. It began with Takato making his very own Digimon by sliding a mysterious blue card on his card reader, which then became a [[Digivice|D-Power]]. [[Guilmon]] taken form from Takato’s sketchings of a new Digimon. (''Tamers''’ only human connection to the ''Adventure'' series is [[Ryo Akiyama]], a character featured in some of the Digimon video games and who made an appearance in some occasions of the ''Adventure'' story-line.) Some of the changes in this series include the way the Digimon digivolve, and the way their &quot;Digivices&quot; work. In this series, the Tamers can slide cards through their &quot;Digivices&quot;, which give their digimon certain advantages, such as in a card game. This act is called &quot;Digi-modify&quot; (Card Slash in the Japanese version). The same process was often used to Digivolve the Digimon, but as usual feelings play a big part in the digivolving process. Unlike most Digimon series where the tone is set mostly in a way to appeal to young children, Tamers took a darker tone in nature.

===''Digimon Frontier'' (Series Four)===
{{Main|Digimon Frontier}}
The fourth Digimon series, which began airing on April 7, 2002, radically departs from the previous three by focusing on a new and very different kind of evolution, Spirit Evolution, in which the human characters use their D-Tectors (this series' Digivice) to transform themselves into special Digimon called [[Legendary Warriors]]. After receiving unusual phone messages from Ophanimon, one of the three ruling Digimon alongside Seraphimon and [[Cherubimon]], the five main characters go to a subway station and take a train to the Digital World. Becoming DigiDestined through the spirits of the Legendary Warriors, they end up fighting Cherubimon and his group of Legendary Warrior servants, hoping to foil his effort to dominate the Digital World. Later on, they face an even greater challenge as they try to stop the [[Royal Knights#Digimon Frontier|Royal Knights]]—[[Dynasmon]] and [[Crusadermon]]—from destroying the Digital World and using its data to revive the original ruler of the Digital World: the tyrannical [[Lucemon]]. In general, ''Frontier'' has a much lighter tone than that of ''Tamers'', yet remains darker than ''Adventure'' and ''Adventure 02''.

===''Digimon Savers / Data Squad'' (Series Five)===
{{Main|Digimon Data Squad}}
After a three year hiatus, a fifth Digimon series began airing on April 2, 2006. Like ''Frontier'', ''Savers'' has no connection with the previous installments, and also marks a new start for the Digimon franchise, with a drastic change in character designs and story-line, in order to reach a broader audience. The story focuses on the challenges faced by the members of D.A.T.S. (&quot;Digital Accident Tactics Squad&quot;), an organization created to conceal the existence of the Digital World and Digimon from the rest of mankind, and secretly solve any Digimon-related incidents occurring on Earth. Later the D.A.T.S. is dragged into a massive conflict between Earth and the Digital World, triggered by an ambitious human scientist determined to make use of the Digimon for his own personal gains. The English version was dubbed by [[Studiopolis]] and it premiered on the [[Jetix]] block on [[Toon Disney]] on October 1, 2007. Digivolution in ''Data Squad'' requires the human partner's DNA (&quot;Digisoul&quot; in the Japanese version) to activate, a strong empathy with their Digimon and a will to succeed. Like previously in Tamers, this plot takes on a dark tone throughout the story and the anime was aimed, originally in Japan, at an older audience consisting of late teens and people in their early twenties from ages 16 to 21.  Because of that, along with the designs, the anime being heavily edited and localized for western US audiences like past series, and the English dub being aimed mostly toward younger audiences of children aged 6 to 10 and having a lower TV-Y7-FV rating just like past dubs, Studiopolis dubbed the anime on Jetix with far more edits, changes, censorship, and cut footage. This included giving the Japanese characters full Americanized names and American surnames as well as applying far more Americanization, cultural streamlining and more edits to their version similar to the changes 4Kids often made (such as removal of Japanese text for the purpose of cultural streamlining). Despite all that, the setting of the country was still in Japan and the characters were Japanese in the dub. This series was the first to show any Japanese cultural concepts that were unfamiliar with American audiences (such as the manju), which were left unedited and used in the English dub.  Well Go USA  released it on DVD instead of Disney. The North American English dub was televised on Jetix in the U.S. and on the Family Channel in Canada.

===''Digimon Xros Wars / Fusion'' (Series Six)===
{{Main|Digimon Fusion}}
Three and a quarter years after the end of the fifth series, a new sixth series was confirmed by [[Bandai]] for the Digimon anime, its official name of the series revealed in the June issue of Shueisha's V Jump magazine being ''Digimon Xros Wars''. It began airing in Japan on TV Asahi from July 6, 2010 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-04-02/new-digital-monsters/Digimon-tv-anime-listed|title=New Digital Monsters/Digimon Anime TV Listed|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2010-04-02|accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-04-05/new-digital-monsters/Digimon-tv-anime-image-posted|title=New Digital Monsters/Digimon TV Anime's Image Posted|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2010-04-05|accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reverting back to the design style of the first four series as well as the plot taking on the younger, lighter tone present in series one, two and four throughout the story. The story follows a boy named Taiki Kudō who, along with his friends, ends up in the Digital World where they meet Shoutmon and his Digimon friends. Wielding a digivice known as a Xros Loader, Taiki is able to combine multiple Digimon onto one to enhance his power, Shoutmon being the usual core of the combination, using a technique known as 'DigiXros'. Forming Team Xros Heart, Taiki, Shoutmon and their friends travel through the Digital World to liberate it from the evil Bagra Army, led by Bagramon, and Twilight, a shady group led by DarkKnightmon with Nene as a figurehead before joining Xros Heart. Xros Heart also finds themselves at odds with Blue Flare, led by Kiriha. The second arc of ''Xros Wars'' was subtitled ''The Evil Death Generals and the Seven Kingdoms''. It saw the main cast reshuffled with a new wardrobe while Akari and Zenjiro stay behind in the Human World; thus making Taiki, Kiriha and Nene the lead protagonists as they set off to face the Seven Death Generals of the Bagra Army and DarkKnightmon's new pawn: Nene's brother Yū. A new evolution known as Super Digivolution was introduced at the end of the first arc.

On August 17, 2011, [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[V-Jump]]'' magazine announced a sequel set one year later, a third arc of ''Xros Wars'' subtitled ''The Young Hunters Who Leapt Through Time'', which aired from October 2, 2011 to March 25, 2012, following on from the previous arc. It focuses on a new protagonist, Tagiru Akashi and his partner Gumdramon who embark on a new journey with an older Taiki, Shoutmon, an older Yū and the revived Damemon, along with other new comrades as they deal with a hidden dimension that lies between the Human World and the Digital World called DigiQuartz. The series finale reintroduces the heroes of the previous five series as they help the current heroes in the final battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-08-17/digimon-xros-wars-anime-to-get-2nd-year-this-october |title=Digimon Xros Wars Anime to Get 2nd Year This October - News |publisher=Anime News Network |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2012-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Digimon Xros Wars: The Young Hunters Who Leapt Through Time'' is currently a nominee for the 2012 [[International Emmy]] Kids Awards for &quot;Best Animation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iemmys.tv/news_item.aspx?id=155&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been nine Digimon movies released in Japan. The first seven were directly connected to their respective anime series; ''[[Digital Monster X-Evolution]]'' originated from the [[Digimon Chronicle]] merchandise line. All movies except ''X-Evolution'' and ''[[Digimon Data Squad#Film|Ultimate Power! Activate Burst Mode]]'' have been released and distributed internationally. &lt;!--The Savers movie is not considered canon to the fifth show's plotline.--&gt; ''[[Digimon: The Movie]]'', released in the U.S. and Canada territory by [[Fox Kids]] through [[20th Century Fox]] on October 6, 2000, consists of the union of the first three Japanese movies.

===Versions outside Japan===

'''United States'''

:In the United States, the series premiered in August 1999 on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Television Network]]. It was dubbed by [[Saban Entertainment]] (later [[Sensation Animation]]), and was initially broadcasted through Fox Network's [[Fox Kids]] and [[ABC Family|Fox Family]]. The first four series were collectively retitled ''Digimon: Digital Monsters''. Some scenes from the original version were omitted from the Saban dub, or were modified, in order to comply with Fox's [[Standards and practices]] which considered several scenes to be inappropriate for the target age group. Often dialogue was changed, and the show became less &quot;Serious&quot; in tone compared to the Japanese version, instead featuring more jokes and added dialogue, along with a completely different musical score (usually orchestral music) and completely different sound effects, due to licensing issues. Another noticeable change in the dub is using different voice actors for different forms of a certain Digimon, whereas in Japan, the voice actor merely changes the tone of his/her voice, sometimes being altered for effect. This is especially the case in Season 1. 

:After [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] acquired Saban during the third series, the first three series moved to the [[cable network]] [[ABC Family]], while the fourth (''Frontier'') premiered on [[UPN]]. This was due to a deal between Disney and UPN which concluded with ''Digimon Frontier''. ''Frontier'' was syndicated on [[ABC Family]] shortly after that. ''Digimon'' continues to run in syndication on the new channel after Toon Disney, [[Disney XD (United States)|Disney XD]]. [[Digimon Savers|Digimon Data Squad]] had started to air on Disney XD. Disney eventually lost the license to Digimon. Toei Animation has however released an official subtitled version of Xros Wars: The Young Hunters Who Lept Through Time. [[Funimation Entertainment]] has online streaming rights to subtitled version of ''[[Digimon Adventure 02]]'' and ''[[Digimon Tamers]]''. 

:In 2012, [[Saban Brands]] licensed ''[[Digimon Fusion|Digimon Xros Wars]]'' with an English dub in the works.

:In September 2012, [[Saban Capital Group#Saban Brands|Saban Brands]] announced it had acquired the ''Digimon'' franchise and MarVista Entertainment will distribute the series outside of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Crowe|first=Deborah|title=Saban Brands Acquires Digimon Anime Brand|url=http://www.labusinessjournal.com/news/2012/sep/25/saban-brands-acquires-digimon-anime-brand/|accessdate=September 26, 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Business Journal|date=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saban Brands Acquires Digimon Anime Franchise|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2012-09-25/saban-brands-acquires-digimon-anime-franchise|accessdate=September 26, 2012|newspaper=AnimeNewsNetwork|date=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sarah|title=Saban Brands Acquires Digimon Brand|url=http://www.bsckids.com/2012/09/saban-brands-acquires-digimon-brand/|accessdate=September 26, 2012|newspaper=BSCKids|date=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canada'''

:In Canada, the Saban version was broadcast on [[YTV (Canadian television)|YTV]]. In the U.S. [[insular area]] of [[Puerto Rico]], the show was redubbed in Spanish, and in Quebec (where ''[[Digimon Adventure]]'' aired on [[TQS]], and ''[[Digimon 02]]'' on [[TÉLÉTOON (Canada)|TÉLÉTOON]]), the show was redubbed in French. A French version of ''[[Digimon Tamers]]'' was aired in France, but not in North America.

'''United Kingdom'''

:In the United Kingdom, ''Digimon'' first aired and gained most popularity on [[ITV1]]'s children's slot [[CITV]] from 2001-2005, which broadcast ''Adventure'', ''Adventure 02'' and a small amount of ''Tamers'' airing during after school hours. The rest of ''Tamers'' aired on cable channel [[Jetix]] from 2005-2007. ''[[Digimon Frontier]]'' (the fourth series/season) never aired in the UK as the shows (then) provider ''Jetix'' placed the season on hold, however shortly after, Jetix ended. From 2011, [[Digimon Data Squad]] (the fifth series/season) airs in the UK on [[Kix (TV channel)|Kix]] (the shows sole provider).

:It has also aired in countries such as Ireland, South Africa, [[Malaysia]], Australia, [[Mexico]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and others. After the overwhelming popularity of [[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]] in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], [[Cartoon Network (India)|Cartoon Network]] started to air Digimon in 2004. Later, all 4 series aired. The 3rd Series was ended in 2009.

:The [[Latin American]], [[Brazil]]ian, [[Spain|Spanish]], [[Germany|German]] and [[Italy|Italian]] versions of Digimon are completely uncensored and uncut from the original Japanese edition. In [[Latin America]], the first four series were aired on ''[[Disney XD (Latin America)|Fox Kids]]'' and later on ''[[Disney XD (Latin America)|Jetix]]'' and later on ''[[Disney XD (Latin America)]]'', which also aired the fifth series, ''[[Digimon Data Squad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anmtvla.com ANIME, MANGA Y TV]&lt;/ref&gt;

:This show also aired in the [[Philippines]] in the middle of 2000 on [[ABS-CBN]]. It would air Friday nights at 7:30PM. ABS-CBN hired [[Filipino people|Filipino]] voice actors to dub the show in English. This dubbing is mostly true to the original. Though they used the original Japanese show as the medium for the dub, some of the voices seem to sound like the U.S. version (e.g., Taichi having an adolescent's voice instead of a kid's) or completely original to the dubbing crew (e.g., Gabumon's deep, grumbly voice). The entire first series of ''[[Digimon Adventure]]'' was dubbed in English (in order to compete with the [[4Kids Entertainment|4Kids]] version of ''[[Pokémon (anime)|Pokémon]]'' which aired on the rival network [[GMA 7]] on the same day and time), along with ''[[Digimon Adventure 02]]''. The second series aired on a new Saturday morning block at 10 A.M. two weeks after the first series finale. This series was dubbed in both English and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], so that it would be compatible with the other shows in the block. [[Cartoon Network Philippines]] began airing ''[[Digimon Tamers]]'' around 2003, then ''[[Digimon Frontier]]'' late in 2004. This time, the show, along with some of the other [[anime]] that aired with it, was dubbed by [[Singapore]]an voice actors. Tamers and Frontier were dubbed in Filipino when both series aired on ABS-CBN on its weekday morning line-up of animated shows (Tamers first followed by Frontier after a few months). ''[[Digimon Savers]]'' began airing in the country on September 8, 2008 and has currently ended. However, in January 2008, [[Hero (TV channel)|Hero]] started to broadcast the Digimon series with [[Digimon Adventure]]. The series which is currently shown on Hero is [[Digimon Savers]] (January 2011)

:In the Czech republic, Digimon was aired after the success of Pokémon by the TV Nova but it never got that popular. The first season was taken from America, it had the same dialogues and the soundtrack was just translated (instead of &quot;Digimon, digital monsters, digimon are the championa&quot; it was &quot;Digimon, digitální monstra, digimoních strážců šampion&quot; and so on). The second season, however, had Japanese soundtrack (not translated) even though it was still American version. Digimon Tamers along with Digimon Frontier got there many years later and it was aired by czech version of Animax.

:In Sweden, only the first two seasons were dubbed into Swedish and aired on Swedish channel TV3 (2001-2002) (Reruns were shown on the Swedish version of Fox Kids from 2002 to 2004), it was a straight dub from the North Americen English version. After the second season was over, the third season was neither dubbed nor aired on Swedish TV. Digimon couldn't compete against Pokémon in Sweden. The first three movies were cut and merged into a movie. The fourth movie &quot;Diaboromon Strikes Back&quot; was never released in Sweden.

==Manga==

===Yuen Wong Yu manhua===
A Chinese [[manhua]] was written and drawn by [[Yuen Wong Yu]] (余 遠鍠 ''Yu Yuen-wong''), who based its storyline on the television series. This adaptation covers ''Digimon Adventure'' in five volumes, ''Digimon Adventure 02'' in two, ''Digimon Tamers'' in four, and ''Digimon Frontier'' in three. The original stories are heavily abridged, though on rare occasions events play out differently than the anime.

The Cantonese language version was published by [[Rightman Publishing|Rightman Publishing Ltd.]] in [[Hong Kong]].

Two English versions were also released. The first one was published by [[Chuang Yi]] in [[Singapore]]. The second one, which was adapted by [[Lianne Sentar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liannesentar.com/works/ |title=Lianne Sentar's Other Published Works/Works List |publisher=Liannesentar.com |date=2011-10-23 |accessdate=2012-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released by [[TOKYOPOP]] in [[North America]].&lt;br&gt;The three volumes for ''Digimon Frontier'' have been released by Chuang Yi in English.

===Dark Horse===
{{main|Digimon: Digital Monsters (comics)}}
[[Dark Horse Comics]] published American-style Digimon [[comic book]]s, adapting the first thirteen episodes of the English [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] of ''Digimon Adventure'' in 2001. The story was written by Daniel Horn and Ryan Hill, and illustrated by Daniel Horn and Cara L. Niece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Horn | first = Daniel | coauthors = Ryan Hill | others = illustrated by Daniel Horn, Cara L.

===Panini===
The European publishing company, [[Panini Comics|Panini]], approached Digimon in different ways in different countries. While Germany created their own adaptations of episodes, the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom (UK)]] reprinted the Dark Horse titles, then translated some of the German adaptations of ''Adventure 02'' episodes. Eventually the UK comics were given their own original stories, which appeared in both the UK's official ''Digimon Magazine'' and the official UK Fox Kids companion magazine, ''Wickid''. These original stories only roughly followed the [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of ''Adventure 02''. When the comic switched to the ''Tamers'' series the storylines adhered to continuity more strictly; sometimes it would expand on subject matter not covered by the original Japanese anime (such as [[Mitsuo Yamaki]]'s past) or the English adaptations of the television shows and movies (such as Ryo's story or the movies that remained undubbed until 2005). In a money saving venture, the original stories were later removed from ''Digimon Magazine'', which returned to printing translated German adaptations of ''Tamers'' episodes. Eventually, both magazines were cancelled.
