'''World War&amp;nbsp;II''', or the '''Second World War''' (often abbreviated as '''WWII''' or '''WW2'''), was a global [[war]] that was underway by 1939 and ended in 1945. It involved [[Participants in World War II|a vast majority of the world's nations]]—including all of the [[great power]]s—eventually forming two opposing [[military]] alliances: the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the [[Axis powers|Axis]]. It was the most widespread war in history, with more than 100 million people serving in [[military]] units. In a state of &quot;[[total war]]&quot;, the major participants placed their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities at the service of the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by significant events involving the mass death of civilians, including the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] and the [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|only use of nuclear weapons in warfare]], it resulted in [[World War II casualties|50 million to over 70 million fatalities]]. These deaths make World War II by far the [[List of wars and disasters by death toll|deadliest conflict]] in all of [[History of the world|human history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Complete Illustrated History of World War Two: An Authoritative Account of the Deadliest Conflict in Human History with Analysis of Decisive Encounters and Landmark Engagements|first=Donald|last=Sommerville|publisher=Lorenz Books|year=2008|page=5|isbn=0-7548-1898-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Empire of Japan]] was already [[Second Sino-Japanese War|at war]] with the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]] in 1937,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first1=David P|last1=Barrett|last2=Shyu|title=China in the anti-Japanese War, 1937–1945: politics, culture and society.

Germany set out to establish a large empire in [[Europe]]. From late 1939 to early 1941, in a series of campaigns and [[Tripartite Pact|treaties]], Germany conquered or subdued much of continental Europe. Following the [[Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union|Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], the nominally neutral Soviet Union fully or partially invaded, occupied and annexed territories of its six European neighbours, [[Soviet invasion of Poland|including Poland]]. The United Kingdom and its Commonwealth remained the only major force continuing the fight against the Axis, with battles taking place in [[Western Desert Campaign|North Africa]] as well as the long-running [[Battle of the Atlantic]]. In June 1941, the European Axis launched an invasion of the Soviet Union, giving a start to the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|largest land theatre of war in history]], which tied down the major part of the Axis' military forces for the rest of the war. In December 1941, the [[Empire of Japan]], which aimed to dominate [[East Asia]] and [[Indochina]], joined the Axis, [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|attacked the United States]] and [[Japanese invasion of Malaya|European territories]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]], and quickly conquered much of the West Pacific.

The Axis advance was stopped in 1942, after Japan lost a series of naval battles and European Axis troops were defeated in [[Second Battle of El Alamein|North Africa]] and, decisively, at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]]. In 1943, with a series of [[Battle of Kursk|German defeats]] in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Allied invasion]] of [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Fascist Italy]], and American victories in the Pacific, the Axis lost the initiative and undertook strategic retreat on all fronts. In 1944, the Western Allies [[Normandy landings|invaded France]], while the Soviet Union regained all of its territorial losses and invaded Germany and its allies. The war in Europe ended with the [[Battle of Berlin|capture of Berlin]] by Soviet and Polish troops and the subsequent [[German Instrument of Surrender|German unconditional surrender]] on [[Victory in Europe Day|8&amp;nbsp;May 1945]]. During 1944 and 1945 the United States defeated the Japanese Navy and captured key West Pacific islands, dropping atomic bombs on the country as the [[Operation Downfall|invasion of the Japanese archipelago]] became imminent. This was followed by the Soviet Union declaring war on Japan and [[Soviet invasion of Manchuria|invading Japanese-controlled Manchuria]] The war in Asia ended on 15&amp;nbsp;August 1945 when the Empire of Japan agreed to surrender.

The total victory of the Allies over the Axis in 1945 ended the conflict. World War&amp;nbsp;II altered the political alignment and social structure of the world. The [[United Nations]] (UN) was established to foster international cooperation and prevent future conflicts. The great powers that were the victors of the war—the United States, Soviet Union, China, the United Kingdom, and France—became the [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent members]] of the [[United Nations Security Council]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The UN Security Council&quot;&gt;{{Citation|title=The UN Security Council|url=http://www.unfoundation.org/what-we-do/issues/united-nations/the-un-security-council.html|accessdate=15 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet Union and the United States emerged as rival superpowers, setting the stage for the [[Cold War]], which lasted for the next 46 years. Meanwhile, the influence of European great powers started to decline, while the [[decolonisation of Asia]] and [[decolonisation of Africa|Africa]] began. Most countries whose industries had been damaged moved towards [[post-World War II economic expansion|economic recovery]]. Political integration, especially [[European integration|in Europe]], emerged as an effort to stabilise postwar relations.

==Chronology==
{{See also|Timeline of World War II}}
The start of the war is generally held to be 1&amp;nbsp;September 1939, beginning with the [[Invasion of Poland|German invasion of Poland]]; Britain and France declared war on Germany two days later. Other dates for the beginning of war include the start of the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] on 7&amp;nbsp;July 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Roger|last=Chickering|title=A World at Total War: Global Conflict and the Politics of Destruction, 1937–1945|page=64|url=http://books.google.com/?id=evVPoSwqrG4C|isbn=0-275-98710-8|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Fiscus|first=James W|title=Critical Perspectives on World War II|page=44|url=http://books.google.com/?id=6MTcnkLfDZAC|publisher=Rosen Publishing Group|isbn=1-4042-0065-7|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others follow British historian [[A. J. P. Taylor]], who held that the Sino-Japanese War and war in Europe and its colonies occurred simultaneously and the two wars merged in 1941. This article uses the conventional dating. Other starting dates sometimes used for World War&amp;nbsp;II include the [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|Italian invasion of Abyssinia]] on 3 October 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Horin, Eliahu (1943).

Hamilton. p. vii; Kellogg, William O (2003). ''American History the Easy Way''. Barron's Educational Series. p. 236 ISBN 0764119737. There also exists the viewpoint that both World War&amp;nbsp;I and World War&amp;nbsp;II are part of the same &quot;[[European Civil War]]&quot; or &quot;[[Second Thirty Years War]]&quot;: Canfora, Luciano; Jones, Simon (2006).

Routledge. p. 11. ISBN 0415369606.&lt;/ref&gt; British historian [[Antony Beevor]] views the beginning of the Second World War as the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in August 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beevor|first=Antony|title=The Second World War|year=2012|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=9780297844976|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The exact date of the war's end is also not universally agreed upon. It has been suggested that the war ended at the [[armistice]] of 14&amp;nbsp;August 1945 ([[Victory over Japan Day|V-J Day]]), rather than the formal surrender of Japan (2&amp;nbsp;September 1945); in some European histories, it ended on [[Victory in Europe Day|V-E Day]] (8&amp;nbsp;May 1945). However, the [[Treaty of San Francisco|Treaty of Peace with Japan]] was not signed until 1951,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Shiraishi|last=Masaya|title=Japanese relations with Vietnam, 1951–1987|publisher=SEAP Publications|year=1990|isbn=0-87727-122-4|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany|that with Germany]] not until 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usa.usembassy.de/etexts/2plusfour8994e.htm|title=German-American Relations – Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany (two plus four)|publisher=Usa.usembassy.de|accessdate=29 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Main|Causes of World War II}}

[[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] radically altered the political map, with the defeat of the [[Central Powers]], including [[Austria-Hungary]], Germany and the [[Ottoman Empire]]; and the 1917 [[Bolshevik]] seizure of power in [[Russia]]. Meanwhile, existing victorious Allies such as France, Belgium, Italy, Greece and Romania gained territories, while new states were created out of the collapse of Austria-Hungary and the [[Russian Empire|Russian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] Empires.

Despite the [[pacifism|pacific movement]] in the [[aftermath of World War I|aftermath of the war]],&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  the losses still caused [[Irredentism|irredentist]] and [[Revanchism|revanchist]] nationalism to became important in a number of European states. Irredentism and revanchism were strong in Germany because of the significant territorial, colonial, and financial losses incurred by the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Under the treaty, Germany lost around 13 percent of its home territory and all of [[German colonial empire|its overseas colonies]], while German annexation of other states was prohibited, reparations were imposed, and limits were placed on the size and capability of the country's armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kantowicz|1999|p=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the [[Russian Civil War]] had led to the creation of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Davies|2008|pp=134–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German Empire was dissolved in the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]], and a democratic government, later known as the [[Weimar Republic]], was created. The interwar period saw strife between supporters of the new republic and hardline opponents on both the [[right-wing politics|right]] and [[left-wing politics|left]]. Although Italy as an Entente ally made some territorial gains, Italian nationalists were angered that the [[Treaty of London (1915)|promises made]] by Britain and France to secure Italian entrance into the war were not fulfilled with the peace settlement. From 1922 to 1925, the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] movement led by [[Benito Mussolini]] seized power in Italy with a nationalist, totalitarian, and class collaborationist agenda that abolished representative democracy, repressed socialist, left wing and liberal forces, and pursued an aggressive foreign policy aimed at forcefully forging Italy as a world power—a &quot;[[Italian Empire|New Roman Empire]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shaw|2000|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Germany, the [[Nazi Party]] led by [[Adolf Hitler]] sought to establish a fascist government in Germany. With the onset of the [[Great Depression]], domestic support for the Nazis rose and, in 1933, Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany. In the aftermath of the [[Reichstag fire]], Hitler created a totalitarian single-party state led by the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bullock|1962|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kuomintang]] (KMT) party in China launched a [[Northern Expedition|unification campaign]] against regional warlords and nominally unified China in the mid-1920s, but was soon embroiled in a [[Chinese Civil War|civil war]] against its former [[Chinese Communist Party|Chinese communist]] allies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Preston|1998|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1931, an [[Militarism-Socialism in Showa Japan|increasingly militaristic]] [[Empire of Japan|Japanese Empire]], which had long sought influence in China&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Myers|1987|p=458}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the first step of what its government saw as the country's [[Hakko ichiu|right to rule Asia]], used the [[Mukden Incident]] as a pretext to [[Japanese invasion of Manchuria|launch an invasion of Manchuria]] and establish the [[puppet state]] of [[Manchukuo]].&lt;ref name=Mukden&gt;{{harvnb|Smith|2004|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Too weak to resist Japan, China appealed to the [[League of Nations]] for help. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations after being [[Lytton Report|condemned]] for its incursion into Manchuria. The two nations then fought several battles, in [[28 January Incident|Shanghai]], [[Battle of Rehe|Rehe]] and [[Defense of the Great Wall|Hebei]], until the [[Tanggu Truce]] was signed in 1933. Thereafter, Chinese volunteer forces continued the resistance to Japanese aggression in [[Pacification of Manchukuo|Manchuria]], and [[Actions in Inner Mongolia (1933–1936)|Chahar and Suiyuan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Volunteer Armies of Northeast China|url=http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5000186948|first=Anthony|last=Coogan|journal=History Today|volume=43|date=July 1993|accessdate=14 November 2009|quote=Although some Chinese troops in the Northeast managed to retreat south, others were trapped by the advancing Japanese Army and were faced with the choice of resistance in defiance of orders, or surrender.

[[File:Hitlermusso2 edit.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Benito Mussolini]] (left) and [[Adolf Hitler]] (right)]]
Adolf Hitler, after an [[Beer Hall Putsch|unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the German government]] in 1923, became the [[Hitler's rise to power|Chancellor of Germany in 1933]]. He abolished democracy, espousing a [[New Order (Nazism)|radical, racially motivated revision of the world order]], and soon began a massive [[German re-armament|rearmament campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brody|1999|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, France, to secure its alliance, [[Franco–Italian Agreement|allowed Italy a free hand in Ethiopia]], which Italy desired as a colonial possession. The situation was aggravated in early 1935 when the [[Saar (League of Nations)|Territory of the Saar Basin]] was legally reunited with Germany and Hitler repudiated the Treaty of Versailles, accelerated his rearmament programme and introduced [[conscription]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Zalampas|1989|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoping to contain Germany, the United Kingdom, France and Italy formed the [[Stresa Front]]. The Soviet Union, concerned due to [[Drang nach Osten|Germany's goals of capturing vast areas of eastern Europe]], wrote a treaty of mutual assistance with France. Before taking effect though, the [[Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance|Franco-Soviet pact]] was required to go through the bureaucracy of the [[League of Nations]], which rendered it essentially toothless.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Record|2005|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mandelbaum|1988|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in June 1935, the United Kingdom made an [[Anglo-German Naval Agreement|independent naval agreement]] with Germany, easing prior restrictions. The United States, concerned with events in Europe and Asia, passed the [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|Neutrality Act]] in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Schmitz|first=David F|title=The First Wise Man|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2001|isbn=0-8420-2632-0|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October, Italy invaded Ethiopia, and Germany was the only major European nation to support the invasion. Italy subsequently dropped its objections to Germany's goal of absorbing [[Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kitson|2001|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler defied the Versailles and [[Locarno Treaties|Locarno]] treaties by [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarizing]] the [[Rhineland]] in March 1936. He received little response from other European powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adamthwaite|1992|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Spanish Civil War]] broke out in July, Hitler and Mussolini supported the fascist and authoritarian [[Nationalist Spain|Nationalist forces]] in their civil war against the Soviet-supported [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]]. Both sides used the conflict to test new weapons and methods of warfare,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Graham|2005|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the Nationalists winning the war in early 1939. In October 1936, Germany and Italy formed the [[Rome-Berlin Axis]]. A month later, Germany and Japan signed the [[Anti-Comintern Pact]], which Italy would join in the following year. In China, after the [[Xi'an Incident]] the Kuomintang and communist forces agreed on a ceasefire in order to present a [[Second United Front|united front]] to oppose Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Busky|2002|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-war events==

===Italian invasion of Ethiopia (1935)===
{{Main|Second Italo-Abyssinian War}}

The Second Italo–Abyssinian War was a brief [[colonial war]] that began in October 1935 and ended in May 1936. The war was fought between the armed forces of the [[Kingdom of Italy]] (''Regno d'Italia'') and the armed forces of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] (also known as [[Ethiopia|Abyssinia]]). The war resulted in the [[military occupation]] of Ethiopia and its [[annexation]] into the newly created colony of [[Italian East Africa]] (''Africa Orientale Italiana'', or AOI); in addition, it exposed the weakness of the [[League of Nations]] as a force to preserve peace. Both Italy and Ethiopia were member nations, but the League did nothing when the former clearly violated the League's own [[Article X of the Covenant of the League of Nations|Article X]].&lt;ref name=Barker-159&gt;{{Cite book|last=Barker|first=A.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H25224, Guernica, Ruinen.jpg|thumb|The ruins of Guernica [[Bombing of Guernica|after the bombing]].]]

Germany and Italy lent support to the [[Spanish State|Nationalist insurrection]] led by general [[Francisco Franco]] in Spain. The Soviet Union supported the existing government, the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]], which showed leftist tendencies. Both Germany and the USSR used this [[proxy war]] as an opportunity to test improved weapons and tactics. The deliberate [[Bombing of Guernica]] by the German [[Condor Legion]] in April 1937 contributed to widespread concerns that the next major war would include extensive terror bombing attacks on civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Beevor|first=Antony|title=The Battle for Spain: The Spanish Civil War 1936–1939|year=2006|publisher=Phoenix|isbn=0-7538-2165-6|pages=258–260|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Budiansky|first=Stephen|title=Air power : The Men, Machines, and Ideas that Revolutionized War, from Kitty Hawk to Gulf War II|year=2004|publisher=Viking|location=London|isbn=0-670-03285-9|pages=209–211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Generalissimo]] [[Chiang Kai-shek]] deployed his [[German-trained divisions in the National Revolutionary Army|best army]] to [[Battle of Shanghai|defend Shanghai]], but after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push the Chinese forces back, [[Battle of Nanking|capturing the capital Nanking]] in December 1937 and committed the [[Nanking Massacre]].

In June&amp;nbsp;1938, Chinese forces stalled the Japanese advance by [[1938 Yellow River flood|flooding the Yellow River]]; this manoeuvre bought time for the Chinese to prepare their defenses at [[Wuhan]], but the [[Battle of Wuhan|city was taken]] by October.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Fairbank|first1=John King|last2=Feuerwerker|first2=Albert|last3=Twitchett|first3=Denis Crispin|title=The Cambridge history of China|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1986|isbn=0-521-24338-6|page=566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese military victories did not bring about the collapse of Chinese resistance that Japan had hoped to achieve, instead the Chinese government relocated inland to [[Chongqing]] and continued the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Jay|title=The Generalissimo: Chiang Kai-shek and the struggle for modern China|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-674-03338-2|pages=150–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the situation in Europe and Asia relatively stable, Germany, Japan, and the Soviet Union made preparations.

The Allies, however, prevented the invasion by intercepting and defeating the Japanese naval forces in the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maddox|first=Robert James|title=The United States and World War II|publisher=Westview Press|year=1992|isbn=0-8133-0436-9|pages=111–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's next plan, motivated by the earlier [[Doolittle Raid]], was to seize [[Midway Atoll]] and lure American carriers into battle to be eliminated; as a diversion, Japan would also send forces to [[Aleutian Islands Campaign|occupy the Aleutian Islands]] in Alaska.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Salecker|first=Gene Eric|title=Fortress Against the Sun: The B-17 Flying Fortress in the Pacific|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2001|isbn=1-58097-049-4|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early June, Japan put its operations into action but the Americans, having broken [[Japanese naval codes]] in late May, were fully aware of the plans and force dispositions and used this knowledge to [[Battle of Midway|achieve a decisive victory at Midway]] over the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ropp|first=Theodore|title=War in the Modern World|publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company|year=1962|isbn=0-8018-6445-3|page=368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With its capacity for aggressive action greatly diminished as a result of the Midway battle, Japan chose to focus on a belated attempt to capture [[Port Moresby]] by an [[Kokoda Track campaign|overland campaign]] in the [[Territory of Papua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weinberg|1995|p=339}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Americans planned a counter-attack against Japanese positions in the southern [[Solomon Islands]], primarily [[Guadalcanal]], as a first step towards capturing [[Rabaul]], the main Japanese base in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gilbert|first=Adrian|title=The Encyclopedia of Warfare: From Earliest Times to the Present Day|publisher=Globe Pequot|year=2003|isbn=1-59228-027-7|page=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both plans started in July, but by mid-September, [[Guadalcanal Campaign|the Battle for Guadalcanal]] took priority for the Japanese, and troops in New Guinea were ordered to withdraw from the Port Moresby area to the [[Oro Province|northern part of the island]], where they faced Australian and United States troops in the [[Battle of Buna-Gona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Swain|first=Bruce|title=A Chronology of Australian Armed Forces at War 1939–45|publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin|year=2001|isbn=1-86508-352-6|page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Guadalcanal soon became a focal point for both sides with heavy commitments of troops and ships in the battle for Guadalcanal.

In Italy the Allied advance also slowed down, when they ran into the [[Gothic Line|last major German defensive line]].

On 22 June, the Soviets launched a strategic offensive in Belarus (known as &quot;[[Operation Bagration]]&quot;) that resulted in the almost complete destruction of the German [[Army Group Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;The operation &quot;was the most calamitous defeat of all the German armed forces in World War II&quot; ({{Cite book|last=Zaloga|first=Steven J|title=Bagration 1944: The destruction of Army Group Centre|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=1996|isbn=1-85532-478-4|page=7}})&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after that, [[Lvov-Sandomierz Offensive|another Soviet strategic offensive]] forced German troops from Western Ukraine and Eastern Poland.

In September 1944, Soviet [[Red Army]] troops advanced into [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] and forced the rapid withdrawal of the German Army Groups [[Army Group E|E]] and [[Army Group F|F]] in [[Axis occupation of Greece during World War II|Greece]], [[Albania under Nazi Germany|Albania]] and [[Yugoslav Front|Yugoslavia]] to rescue them from being cut off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Hastings|first1=Max|last2=Paul Henry|first2=Collier|title=The Second World War: a world in flames|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2004|isbn=1-84176-830-8|pages=223–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; By this point, the Communist-led [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] under Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]], who had led an [[Yugoslav Front|increasingly successful guerrilla campaign]] against the occupation since 1941, controlled much of the territory of Yugoslavia and were engaged in delaying efforts against the German forces further south. In northern [[Serbia (1941–1944)|Serbia]], the [[Red Army]], with limited support from [[Yugoslav Front#Allied offensive in the Balkans|Bulgarian forces]], assisted the Partisans in a joint [[Belgrade Offensive|liberation of the capital city of Belgrade]] on 20 October.

In the Pacific, American forces continued to press back the Japanese perimeter. In mid-June 1944 they began their [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|offensive against the Mariana and Palau islands]], and decisively defeated Japanese forces in the [[Battle of the Philippine Sea]]. These defeats led to the resignation of Japanese Prime Minister [[Hideki Tōjō|Tōjō]] and provided the United States with air bases to launch intensive heavy bomber attacks on the Japanese home islands. In late October, American forces [[Battle of Leyte|invaded the Filipino island of Leyte]]; soon after, Allied naval forces scored another large victory during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], one of the largest naval battles in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Chris|last2=Bewes|first2=Diccon|title=What Happened Where: A Guide to Places and Events in Twentieth-Century History|page=305|year=1997|publisher=UCL Press|isbn=1-85728-532-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Axis collapse, Allied victory (1945)===
On 16 December 1944, Germany attempted its last desperate measure for success on the Western Front by using most of its remaining reserves to launch [[Battle of the Bulge|a massive counter-offensive in the Ardennes]] to attempt to split the Western Allies, encircle large portions of Western Allied troops and capture their primary supply port at [[Antwerp]] in order to prompt a political settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;parkerxiii&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Parker|first=Danny S|title=Battle of the Bulge: Hitler's Ardennes Offensive, 1944–1945|publisher=Da Capo Press|year=2004|isbn=0-306-81391-2|pages=xiii–xiv, 6–8, 68–70 &amp; 329–330}}&lt;/ref&gt; By January, the offensive had been repulsed with no strategic objectives fulfilled.&lt;ref name=&quot;parkerxiii&quot;/&gt; In Italy, the Western Allies remained stalemated at the German defensive line. In mid-January 1945, the Soviets attacked in Poland, [[Vistula-Oder Offensive|pushing from the Vistula to the Oder]] river in Germany, and [[East Prussian Offensive|overran East Prussia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Glantz|2001|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 February, U.S., British, and Soviet leaders met for the [[Yalta Conference]].

==Aftermath==
{{Main|Aftermath of World War II}}

The Allies established occupation administrations in [[Allied-administered Austria|Austria]] and [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Germany]]. The former became a neutral state, non-aligned with any political bloc. The latter was divided into western and eastern occupation zones controlled by the Western Allies and the USSR, accordingly. A [[denazification]] program in Germany led to the [[Nuremberg Trials|prosecution of Nazi war criminals]] and the removal of ex-Nazis from power, although this policy moved towards amnesty and re-integration of ex-Nazis into West German society.&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Frei.

Germany lost a quarter of its pre-war (1937) territory, the eastern territories: [[Silesia]], [[Neumark]] and most of [[Pomerania]] were taken over by Poland; [[East Prussia]] was divided between Poland and the USSR, followed by the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expulsion of the 9 million Germans]] from these provinces, as well as of 3 million Germans from the [[Sudetenland]] in Czechoslovakia, to Germany. By the 1950s, every fifth West German was a refugee from the east.

[[File:WorldWarII-GDP-Relations-Allies-Axis-simple.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|Allied to Axis GDP ratio]]

In Europe, before the outbreak of the war, the Allies had significant advantages in both population and economics. In 1938, the Western Allies (United Kingdom, France, Poland and British Dominions) had a 30 percent larger population and a 30 percent higher gross domestic product than the European Axis (Germany and Italy); if colonies are included, it then gives the Allies more than a 5:1 advantage in population and nearly 2:1 advantage in GDP.&lt;ref name=&quot;6Econ3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Harrison|first=Mark|title=The Economics of World War II: Six Great Powers in International Comparison|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=0-521-78503-0|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Asia at the same time, China had roughly six times the population of Japan, but only an 89 percent higher GDP; this is reduced to three times the population and only a 38 percent higher GDP if Japanese colonies are included.&lt;ref name=&quot;6Econ3&quot;/&gt;

Though the Allies' economic and population advantages were largely mitigated during the initial rapid blitzkrieg attacks of Germany and Japan, they became the decisive factor by 1942, after the United States and Soviet Union joined the Allies, as the war largely settled into one of attrition.&lt;ref name=&quot;6Econ2&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Harrison|first=Mark|title=The Economics of World War II: Six Great Powers in International Comparison|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=0-521-78503-0|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Allies' ability to out-produce the Axis is often attributed to the Allies having more access to natural resources, other factors, such as Germany and Japan's reluctance to employ women in the [[labour force]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=Matthew|last2=Mann|first2=Chris|title=Inside Hitler's Germany: Life Under the Third Reich|page=148|publisher=Potomac Books Inc|year=2000|isbn=1-57488-281-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bernstein|first=Gail Lee|title=Recreating Japanese Women, 1600–1945|page=267|publisher=University of California Press|year=1991|isbn=978-0-520-07017-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allied [[Strategic bombing during World War II|strategic bombing]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hughes|first=Matthew|last2=Mann|first2=Chris|title=Inside Hitler's Germany: Life Under the Third Reich|page=151|publisher=Potomac Books Inc|year=2000|isbn=1-57488-281-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Griffith|first=Charles|title=The Quest: Haywood Hansell and American Strategic Bombing in World War II|isbn=1-58566-069-8|publisher=DIANE Publishing|year=1999|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Germany's late shift to a [[war economy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Overy|first=R.J|title=War and Economy in the Third Reich|page=26|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|year=1995|isbn=0-19-820599-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; contributed significantly.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-031-2436-03A, Russland, Hinrichtung von Partisanen.jpg|right|thumb|[[Soviet partisans]] hanged by German forces in January 1943]]
In Europe, occupation came under two very different forms. In Western, Northern and Central Europe (France, Norway, Denmark, the Low Countries, and the [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|annexed portions of Czechoslovakia]]) Germany established economic policies through which it collected roughly 69.5 billion [[German Reichsmark|reichmarks]] (27.8 billion US Dollars) by the end of the war; this figure does not include the [[Nazi plunder|sizable plunder]] of industrial products, military equipment, raw materials and other goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Liberman|first=Peter|title=Does Conquest Pay?: The Exploitation of Occupied Industrial Societies|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1998|isbn=0-691-00242-8|page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the income from occupied nations was over 40 percent of the income Germany collected from taxation, a figure which increased to nearly 40 percent of total German income as the war went on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Milward|first=Alan S|title=War, Economy, and Society, 1939–1945|publisher=University of California Press|year=1979|isbn=0-520-03942-4|page=138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the East, the much hoped for bounties of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' were never attained as fluctuating front-lines and Soviet [[scorched earth]] policies denied resources to the German invaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Milward|first=Alan S|title=War, Economy, and Society, 1939–1945|publisher=University of California Press|year=1979|isbn=0-520-03942-4|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike in the West, the [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi racial policy]] encouraged excessive brutality against what it considered to be the &quot;[[Untermensch|inferior people]]&quot; of Slavic descent; most German advances were thus followed by [[Generalplan Ost|mass executions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Perrie|first=Maureen|last2=Lieven|first2=D.

===Advances in technology and warfare===
{{Main|Technology during World War II}}
Aircraft were used for reconnaissance, as [[fighter aircraft|fighters]], [[bomber]]s and ground-support, and each role was advanced considerably. Innovation included [[airlift]] (the capability to quickly move limited high-priority supplies, equipment and personnel);&lt;ref name=&quot;EncWWII_76&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|year=2004|title=Encyclopedia of World War II: A Political, Social, and Military History|publisher=ABC-CLIO|last1=Tucker|first1=Spencer C.|last2=Roberts|first2=Priscilla Mary Roberts|page=76|isbn=1-57607-999-6|location=Sanata Barbara, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; and of [[strategic bombing]] (the bombing of civilian areas to destroy industry and morale).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Levine|first=Alan J.|title=The Strategic Bombing of Germany, 1940–1945|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1992|page=217|isbn=0-275-94319-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anti-aircraft warfare|Anti-aircraft weaponry]] also advanced, including defences such as [[radar]] and surface-to-air artillery, such as the German [[88 mm gun]]. The use of the [[jet aircraft]] was pioneered, and though late introduction meant it had little impact, it led to jets becoming standard in worldwide air forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sauvain|first=Philip|title=Key Themes of the Twentieth Century: Teacher's Guide|page=128|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|year=2005|isbn=1-4051-3218-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Advances were made in nearly every aspect of naval warfare, most notably with aircraft carriers and submarines. Although at the start of the war [[Aeronautics|aeronautical]] warfare had relatively little success, actions at Taranto, Pearl Harbor, the South China Sea and the Coral Sea established the carrier as the dominant capital ship in place of the battleship.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncWWII_163&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|year=2004|title=Encyclopedia of World War II: A Political, Social, and Military History|publisher=ABC-CLIO|last1=Tucker|first1=Spencer C.|last2=Roberts|first2=Priscilla Mary Roberts|page=163|isbn=1-57607-999-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Bishop|first1=Chris|last2=Chant|first2=Chris|title=Aircraft Carriers: The World's Greatest Naval Vessels and Their Aircraft|page=7|publisher=Silverdale Books|year=2004|isbn=1-84509-079-9|location=Wigston, Leics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Chenoweth|first1=H.

In the Atlantic, [[escort carrier]]s proved to be a vital part of Allied convoys, increasing the effective protection radius and helping to close the [[Mid-Atlantic gap]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Sumner|first=Ian|last2=Baker|first2=Alix|title=The Royal Navy 1939–45|page=25|publisher=Osprey Publishing|year=2001|isbn=1-84176-195-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carriers were also more economical than battleships due to the relatively low cost of aircraft&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hearn|first=Chester G.|title=Carriers in Combat: The Air War at Sea|page=14|publisher=Stackpole Books|year=2007|isbn=0-8117-3398-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their not requiring to be as heavily armoured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Gardiner|first1=Robert|last2=Brown|first2=David K|title=The Eclipse of the Big Gun: The Warship 1906–1945|isbn=0-85177-953-0|page=52|publisher=Conway Maritime|location=London|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Submarines, which had proved to be an effective weapon during the First World War&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rydill|first=Louis|title=Concepts in Submarine Design|page=15|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-55926-X|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; were anticipated by all sides to be important in the second. The British focused development on [[Anti-submarine warfare|anti-submarine]] [[anti-submarine weapon|weaponry]] and tactics, such as [[sonar]] and convoys, while Germany focused on improving its offensive capability, with designs such as the [[German Type VII submarine|Type VII submarine]] and [[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]] tactics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Rydill|first=Louis|title=Concepts in Submarine Design|page=16|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-521-55926-X|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gradually, improving Allied technologies such as the [[Leigh light]], [[Hedgehog (weapon)|hedgehog]], [[Squid (weapon)|squid]], and [[Mark 24 FIDO Torpedo|homing torpedoes]] proved victorious.

Land warfare changed from the static front lines of World War&amp;nbsp;I to increased mobility and [[combined arms]]. The [[tank]], which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, had evolved into the primary weapon.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncWWII_125&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|year=2004|title=Encyclopedia of World War II: A Political, Social, and Military History|publisher=ABC-CLIO|last1=Tucker|first1=Spencer C.|last2=Roberts|first2=Priscilla Mary Roberts|page=125|isbn=1-57607-999-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced than it had been during World War I,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dupuy|first=Trevor Nevitt|title=The Evolution of Weapons and Warfare|publisher=[[Jane's Information Group]]|isbn=0-7106-0123-9|year=1982|page=231}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Tanks in World War II|advances continued throughout the war]] in increasing speed, armour and firepower.

At the start of the war, most commanders thought enemy tanks should be met by tanks with superior specifications.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncWWII_108&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|year=2004|title=Encyclopedia of World War II: A Political, Social, and Military History|publisher=ABC-CLIO|last1=Tucker|first1=Spencer C.|last2=Roberts|first2=Priscilla Mary|page=108|isbn=1-57607-999-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was challenged by the poor performance of the relatively light early tank guns against armour, and German doctrine of avoiding tank-versus-tank combat. This, along with Germany's use of combined arms, were among the key elements of their highly successful blitzkrieg tactics across Poland and France.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncWWII_125&quot;/&gt; Many means of [[anti-tank warfare|destroying tanks]], including [[Indirect fire|indirect artillery]], [[anti-tank gun]]s (both towed and [[self-propelled gun|self-propelled]]), [[anti-tank mine|mines]], short-ranged infantry antitank weapons, and other tanks were utilised.&lt;ref name=&quot;EncWWII_108&quot; /&gt; Even with large-scale mechanisation, infantry remained the backbone of all forces,&lt;ref name=&quot;EncWWII_734&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|year=2004|title=Encyclopedia of World War II: A Political, Social, and Military History|publisher=ABC-CLIO|last1=Tucker|first1=Spencer C.|last2=Roberts|first2=Priscilla Mary Roberts|page=734|isbn=1-57607-999-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and throughout the war, most infantry were equipped similarly to World War I.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comp_221&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cowley|first=Robert|last2=Parker|first2=Geoffrey|title=The Reader's Companion to Military History|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|year=2001|isbn=0-618-12742-9|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The portable machine gun spread, a notable example being the German [[MG42]], and various [[submachine gun]]s which were suited to close combat in urban and jungle settings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comp_221&quot; /&gt; The [[assault rifle]], a late war development incorporating many features of the rifle and submachine gun, became the standard postwar infantry weapon for most armed forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infantry Weapons Of World War 2|url=http://greyfalcon.us/Infantry%20Weapons%20Of%20World%20War%202.htm|publisher=Grey Falcon (Black Sun)|accessdate=14 November 2009|quote=These all-purpose guns were developed and used by the German army in the 2nd half of World War 2 as a result of studies which showed that the ordinary rifle's long range is much longer than needed, since the soldiers almost always fired at enemies closer than half of its effective range.
