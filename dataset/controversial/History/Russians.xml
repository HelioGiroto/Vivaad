{{See also|List of Russian people}}

The '''Russian people''' ({{lang-ru|русские}}, ''russkiye'') are a predominantly [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] ethno-linguistic group native to [[Russia]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/548156/Slav &quot;Slav.&quot;] Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 30 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; with some significant [[Germanic]] and [[Finno-Ugric]] ancestry speaking the [[Russian language]] and primarily living in [[Russia]] and neighboring countries.

According to the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 census]], ethnic Russians make up about 81% of the population of Russia.&lt;ref name=gks/&gt;

==Terminology==
There are two Russian words which are commonly translated into English as &quot;Russians&quot;: &quot;русские&quot; (''russkiye''), which means &quot;ethnic Russians&quot; and &quot;россияне&quot; (''rossiyane''), which means &quot;citizens of Russia&quot;. The first word refers to all ethnic Russians, indifferently of what country they live in (Russia, Ukraine, Latvia etc.), and does not include members of Russia's ethnic minorities. The second word refers to all people holding citizenship of Russia, indifferently of their ethnicity, and does not include ethnic Russians living outside of Russia. English translations do not always distinguish these two words.

==Origins==
{{further|Rus' (people)|Primary Chronicle|Lech, Czech and Rus}}

The modern Russian is formed from two groups, Northern and Southern, which were made up of [[Krivich]]es, [[Ilmen Slavs]], [[Radimichs]], [[Vyatich]]es and [[Severians]] [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] tribes. Genetic studies show that modern Russians do not differ significantly from [[Poles]] or [[Slovenians]] or [[Ukrainians]]. Some ethnographers, like Zelenin, affirm that Russians are more similar to Belarusians and Ukrainians than southern Russians to northern Russians. Russians in northern European Russia share moderate genetic similarities with [[Uralic peoples]],&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsru.com/russia/28sep2005/russians.html |title=Новости NEWSru.com :: Ученые завершили масштабное исследование генофонда русского народа (Фотороботы) |publisher=Newsru.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=2253976 Two Sources of the Russian Patrilineal Heritage in Their Eurasian Context] by Oleg Balanovsky, Siiri Rootsi, Andrey Pshenichnov, Toomas Kivisild et al.&lt;/ref&gt; who lived in modern north central European Russia and were partly assimilated by the [[Slavs]] as the Slavs migrated northeastwards. Among those peoples were [[Merya]]&lt;ref&gt;*[[Aleksey Uvarov]], &quot;Étude sur les peuples primitifs de la Russie. Les mériens&quot; (1875)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Muromian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emc.komi.com/01/12/115.htm ]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside archaeological remains, little is known about the predecessors to Russians in general prior to 859 AD when the [[Primary Chronicle]] starts.&lt;ref&gt;The Primary Chronicle is a history of the Ancient Rus' from around 850 to 1110 originally compiled in Kiev about 1113)&lt;/ref&gt; It is thought that by 600 AD, the [[Slavs]] had split linguistically into southern, western, and eastern branches. The eastern branch was settled between the [[Southern Bug]] and the [[Dnieper]] Rivers in what is now [[Ukraine]]; from the 1st century AD through almost the millennium, they spread peacefully northward to the [[Baltic region|Baltic]] region, assimilating indigents and forming the [[Dregovichs|Dregovich]], [[Radimichs|Radimich]] and [[Vyatichs|Vyatich]] Slavic tribes on the Baltic substratum, therefore having language features such as [[Vowel reduction in Russian|vowel reduction]]. Later, both [[Belarusians]] and South Russians formed themselves on this ethnic linguistic ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;pivtorak&quot;&gt;Pivtorak. Formation and dialectal differenciaton of the Old Rus language. 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 6th century, another group of Slavs moved from [[Pomerania]] to  northeast of the [[Baltic Sea]], where they encountered the [[Varangians]] of the [[Rus' Khaganate]] and established the important regional center of [[Novgorod]]. This is possibly why Russians are known in [[Finnic languages]] as [[Venedes]], a name derived for [[West Slavs]]. The same Slavic ethnic population also settled the present-day [[Tver Oblast]] and the region of [[Beloozero]]. With the Uralic substratum, they formed [[Krivich]]es and [[Ilmen Slavs]].

==Genetics==
Russians show the characteristic [[R1a]] genes of paternal descent from a single male at 33.4% in North Russia to 49% in rest of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Rosser et al. (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tambets et al. (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oleg Balanovsky, Siiri Rootsi, Andrey Pshenichnov et al., &quot;Two Sources of the Russian Patrilineal Heritage in Their Eurasian Context,&quot; American Journal of Human Genetics 82, 236–250, January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Such large frequencies of R1a have been found only in Eastern Europe ([[Sorbs]], [[Poles]] and [[Ukrainians]]; at about 50 to 65%),&lt;ref&gt;Balanovsky et al. (2008), &quot;Two Sources of the Russian Patrilineal Heritage in Their Eurasian Context&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Semino et al. (2000), &quot;The Genetic Legacy of Paleolithic Homo sapiens sapiens in Extant Europeans: A Y Chromosome Perspective&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Central Asia  and South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;F. Luca, F. Di Giacomo, T. Benincasa et al., &quot;Y-Chromosomal Variation in the Czech Republic,&quot; American Journal of Physical Anthropology 132:132–139 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

The percentages of Y-chromosome markers vary in ethnic Russian populations, and in different studies.
The top four Y-DNA haplogroups are:&lt;ref&gt;http://ruthen-info.fatal.ru/files/mtDNA_Y_Chromosomes_in_Russian_Populations.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=2253976 | pmid=18179905 | doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.09.019 | volume=82 | issue=1 | title=Two sources of the Russian patrilineal heritage in their Eurasian context | year=2008 | month=January | journal=Am. J. Hum. Genet. | pages=236–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Haplogroup R1a (Y-DNA)]] – 19.8% to 62.7%, with an average of '''46.7%'''

[[Haplogroup I (Y-DNA)]] – 0% to 26.8%, with an average of '''17.6%''' (All regions), and '''23.5%''' (Central and South Russia)

[[Haplogroup R1b (Y-DNA)]] – 0% to 14%, with an average of '''5.8%'''

==Emergence of Russian ethnicity==
According to some modern ethnologists, ethnic Russians originated from the earlier [[Rus' (people)|Rus' people]] and gradually evolved into a separate ethnicity from the western Rus peoples, who became known as the modern-day [[Belarusians]] and [[Ukrainians]]. Early ancestors of the Russians were [[Early East Slavs|East Slavic]] tribes migrating to the [[East European Plain]] in the early Middle Ages. Most prominent Slavic tribes in the area of what is now European Russia included [[Vyatichs]], [[Krivich]]s, [[Radimichs]], [[Severians]] and [[Ilmen Slavs]]. By the 11th century, East Slavs assimilated the [[Uralic peoples|Uralic]] tribes [[Merya]] and [[Muromian|Muroma]], and the [[Balts|Baltic]] tribe [[Eastern Galindae]] that inhabited the same area (now [[European Russia|Central Russia]]).

Ethnic Russians were referred to as [[Great Russia]]ns (as opposed to the [[ethnonym]]s [[White Russia]]n and [[Little Russia]]n) and began to be recognized as a distinct ethnic group in the 15th century. At that time, during the consolidation of the [[Russian Tsardom]] as a regional power, they were referred to as [[Grand Duchy of Moscow|Moscovites]] in the West. Between the 12th and 16th century, Russians known as [[Pomors]] migrated to northern Russia and settled the [[White Sea]] coasts. As a result of these migrations and Russian conquests, after the liberation from the [[Mongol invasion of Russia|Mongol]] [[Golden Horde]] domination during the 15th and 16th century, Russians settled the [[Privolzhsky (Volga) Federal District|Volga]], [[Urals Federal District|Urals]] and [[Southern Federal District|Northern Caucasus]] regions. Between the 17th and 19th century, migrants settled eastwards in the vast, sparsely inhabited areas of [[Siberia]] and the [[Russian Far East]]. The [[Cossacks|Cossack]] movement played a significant role in these territorial expansions and migrations.

==Population==
{{see also|Demographics of Russia}}

Russians are the most numerous ethnic group in Europe and [[List of ethnic groups by population|one of the largest in the world]] with a population of about 140 million people worldwide. Roughly 116 million ethnic Russians live in [[Russia]] and about 16 million more live in the neighboring countries. A significant number of Russians, around 4,6 million, live elsewhere in the world, mostly in the [[Americas]] and [[Western Europe]], but also in other places of [[Eastern Europe]], [[Asia]] and elsewhere.

==Culture==
{{Main|Russian culture|List of Russian people}}

[[File:Danceinalanya.jpg|thumb|left|240px|A girl in folk costume performing a Russian folk dance.]]
[[File:RedSquare SaintBasile (pixinn.net).jpg|thumb|160px|[[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] on the [[Red Square]], [[Moscow]]]]
Russian culture started from that of [[East Slavs]], who were largely [[polytheists]], and had a specific way of life in the wooden areas of [[Eastern Europe]]. The [[Scandinavia]]n [[Vikings]], or ''[[Varangians]]'', also took part in the forming of Russian identity and state in the early [[Kievan Rus']] period of the late [[1st millennium AD]]. [[Rus' people|Rus']] had [[Christianization of the Kievan Rus'|accepted the Orthodox Christianity]] from the [[East Roman Empire]] in 988, and this largely defined the Russian culture of [[Millennium of Russia|next millennium]] as the synthesis of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Byzantine]] cultures.&lt;ref name=Curtis&gt;{{cite web|last=excerpted from Glenn E. Curtis (ed.)|title=Russia: A Country Study: Kievan Rus' and Mongol Periods|publisher=Washington, DC: Federal Research Division of the Library of Congress|year=1998|url=http://www.shsu.edu/~his_ncp/Kievan.html|accessdate=2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[fall of Constantinople]] in 1453, Russia remained the largest [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] nation in the world and claimed succession to the Byzantine legacy in the form of the [[Third Rome]] idea. At different points of its history, the country also was strongly influenced by the [[European Culture]], and since [[Reforms of Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great reforms]] Russian culture largely developed in the context of the [[Western culture]]. For most of the 20th century, the [[Marxism|Marxist ideology]] shaped the [[Soviet culture|culture of the Soviet Union]], where Russia, or [[Russian SFSR]], was the largest and leading part.

[[Russian culture]] is extremely various and unique in many aspects. It has a rich history and can boast a long tradition of excellence in every aspect of arts,&lt;ref name=britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia|title=Russia|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2008-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially when it comes to [[Russian literature|literature]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761564269/Russian_Literature.html|title=Russian Literature|last=Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2007|accessdate=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Russian philosophy|philosophy]], [[Russian music|classical music]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia::Music|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2009-10-05|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia/38636/Music}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://petersburgcity.com/news/culture/2005/11/18/theatre/|title=A Tale of Two Operas|publisher=Petersburg City|accessdate=2008-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Russian ballet|ballet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Garafola, L|title=Diaghilev's Ballets Russes|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=576|isbn=0-19-505701-5|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Russian architecture|architecture]] and [[Russian visual arts|painting]], [[Russian cinema|cinema]]&lt;ref name=film&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia::Motion pictures|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|year=2007|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia|accessdate=2007-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Russian animation|animation]], which all had considerable influence on the world culture.

[[Russian literature]] is known for such notable writers as [[Aleksandr Pushkin]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Vladimir Mayakovsky]], [[Boris Pasternak]], [[Anna Akhmatova]], [[Joseph Brodsky]], [[Maxim Gorky]], [[Vladimir Nabokov]], [[Mikhail Sholokhov]], [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], [[Andrei Platonov]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], and [[Varlam Shalamov]]. Russians also gave the [[classical music]] world some very famous composers, including [[Piotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]] and his contemporaries, the [[Mighty Handful]], including [[Modest Mussorgsky]] and [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]]. In the 20th century Russian music was credited with such influential composers as [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], [[Igor Stravinski]], [[Georgy Sviridov]], and [[Alfred Schnittke]]. Many more famous Russian people are associated with different aspects of culture.

==Language==
{{Main|Russian language}}
'''Russian''' (&lt;span class=&quot;unicode audiolink&quot;&gt;{{lang|ru|[[:Media:Ru-russkiy jizyk.ogg|русский язык]]}}&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;span class=&quot;metadata audiolinkinfo&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;([[Wikipedia:Media help|help]]·[[:File:Ru-russkiy jizyk.ogg|info]])&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, [[Romanization of Russian|transliteration]]: ''{{transl|ru|ALA|Russkiy yazyk}}'', {{IPA-ru|ˈruskʲɪj jɪˈzɨk|}}) is the most geographically widespread language of [[Eurasia]] and the most widely spoken of the [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] languages. Russian belongs to the family of [[Indo-European languages]] and is one of three (or, according to some authorities{{who|date=September 2012}}, four) living members of the [[East Slavic languages]], the others being [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] and [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]].

Examples of Old East Slavonic are attested from the 10th century onwards, and while Russian preserves much of East Slavonic grammar and a [[Proto-Slavic language|Common Slavonic]] word base, modern Russian exhibits a large stock of borrowed international vocabulary for politics, science, and technology. Due to the status of the [[Soviet Union]] as a [[super power]], Russian had great political importance in the 20th century, and is one of the [[United Nations#Languages|official languages]] of the [[United Nations]].

[[File:Gorskii 04421u.jpg|thumb|A group of Russian children, 1909. [[Sergei Mikhailovich Prokudin-Gorskii]].]]
&lt;!-- FAIR USE of RussianChildrenOnAHillside.jpg: see image description page at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:RussianChildrenOnAHillside.jpg for rationale --&gt;
Russian has [[palatalization|palatal]] [[secondary articulation]] of [[consonant]]s, the so-called ''soft'' and ''hard'' sounds. This distinction is found in almost all consonant [[phoneme]]s and is one of the most distinguishing features of the language. Another important aspect is the [[vowel reduction|reduction]] of [[stress (linguistics)|unstressed]] [[vowel]]s, not entirely unlike a similar process present in most forms of [[English language|English]]. Stress in Russian is generally quite unpredictable and can be placed on almost any syllable, one of the most difficult aspects for foreign language learners.

==Religion==
{{Main|Religion in Russia}}
Around 63% of the Russia's population identify themselves with [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religare.ru/article42432.htm|title=Опубликована подробная сравнительная статистика религиозности в России и Польше |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; most of whom belong to the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], which played a vital role in the development of Russian national identity. In other countries Russian faithful usually belong to the local Orthodox congregations which either have a direct connection (like the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church - Moscow Patriarchy|Ukrainian Orthodox Church]], [[Autonomy (Eastern Christianity)|autonomous]] from the [[Patriarch of Moscow|Moscow Patriarchate]]) or historical origin (like [[the Orthodox Church in America]] or a [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside of Russia]]) with the Russian Orthodox Church.

Non-religious Russians may associate themselves with the Orthodox faith for cultural reasons. Some Russian people are [[Old Believers]]: a relatively small [[Schism (religion)|schismatic]] group of the Russian Orthodoxy that rejected the liturgical reforms introduced in the 17th century. Other schisms from Orthodoxy include [[Doukhobor]]s which in the 18th century rejected secular government, the Russian Orthodox priests, icons, all church ritual, the Bible as the supreme source of divine revelation and the divinity of Jesus, and later emigrated into Canada. An even earlier sect were [[Molokan]]s which formed in 1550 and rejected Czar's [[Divine right of kings|divine right to rule]], icons, the [[Trinity]] as outlined by the [[Nicene Creed]], Orthodox [[Fasting#Eastern Orthodoxy and Greek-Catholicism|fasts]], military service, and practices including [[Baptism|water baptism]].

Other world religions have negligible representation among ethnic Russians. The most prominent are [[Baptists]] with over 85,000 Russian adherents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_639.html |title=statistics |publisher=Adherents.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others are mostly [[Pentecostals]], [[Evangelicals]], [[Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Lutherans]] and [[Jehovah's Witnesses]].

Since the fall of the [[Soviet Union]] various new religious movements have sprung up and gathered a following among ethnic Russians. The most prominent of these are [[Slavic Neopaganism|Rodnovery]], the revival of the Slavic native religion also common to other [[Slavs|Slavic nations]],&lt;ref&gt;Victor Shnirelman. ''[http://www.wlu.ca/documents/6483/Christians_Go_home.pdf “Christians! Go home”: A Revival of Neo-Paganism between the Baltic Sea and Transcaucasia]''. Journal of Contemporary Religion, Vol. 17, No. 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; forms of autochthonous &quot;Russian [[Vedism]]&quot; and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] movements such as [[Krishnaism]] and the [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|Hare Krishna]].&lt;ref&gt;Elena J. Deryagina. ''[http://elib.sfu-kras.ru/bitstream/2311/1530/2/09_Deruagina_1.pdf Russian Krishnaism: Problem of «Conventionality» in Modern Culture]''. Krasnoyarsk State Teachers’ Training University, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Another movement, very small in comparison to other new religions, is [[Vissarion]]ism, a [[syncretism|syncretic]] group with an Orthodox Christian background.

==Russians outside of Russia==

{{Main|Russian diaspora}}
[[File:Eglise notre dame de l assomption 7.jpg|thumb|[[Sainte-Geneviève-des-Bois Russian Cemetery]], the resting place of many eminent Russian émigrés]]
Ethnic Russians historically migrated throughout the area of former [[Russian Empire]] and [[Soviet Union]], sometimes encouraged to re-settle in borderlands by Tsarist and later Soviet government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4420922.stm Russians left behind in Central Asia]. BBC News. November 23, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; On some occasions ethnic Russian communities, such as [[Lipovans]] who settled in the [[Danube delta]] or [[Doukhobor]]s in [[Canada]], emigrated as religious dissidents fleeing the central authority.

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] and [[Russian Civil War]] starting in 1917, many Russians were forced to leave their homeland fleeing the [[Bolshevik]] regime, and millions became refugees. Many [[white emigre|white émigrés]] were participants in the [[White movement]], although the term is broadly applied to anyone who may have left the country due to the change in regime.

Today the largest ethnic Russian diasporas outside of Russia live in former Soviet states such as [[Ukraine]] (about 8 million), [[Kazakhstan]] (about 3.8 million), [[Belarus]] (about 785,000), [[Latvia]] (about 556,000) with the most Russian settlement out of the [[Baltic States]] which includes [[Lithuania]] and [[Estonia]], [[Uzbekistan]] (about 650,000) and [[Kyrgyzstan]] (about 419,000).
[[File:Russian Orthodox Church, Old Shanghai.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Russian Orthodox Church in [[Shanghai]] around 1948]]
Over a million [[Russian Jews]] emigrated to [[Israel]] during and after the [[Refusenik (Soviet Union)|Refusenik]] movements; some brought ethnic Russian relatives along with them. Out of more than one million Russian-speaking immigrants in Israel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/952558.html Study: Soviet immigrants outperform Israeli students]. Haaretz.com. 10/02/2008.&lt;/ref&gt; about 300,000 are considered not Jewish according to the rabbinical commandments (but not all of them are ethnic Russians).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/pages/QA.jhtml?qaNo=59 Q&amp;A Lily Galili on 'The Russians in Israel']. Haaretz.com&lt;/ref&gt; There are also small Russian communities in the [[Balkans]], Eastern and Central European nations such as [[Germany]] and [[Poland]], as well Russians settled in [[China]], [[Japan]], [[South Korea]], [[Latin America]] (i.e. [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]] and [[Argentina]]) and [[Australia]]. These communities may identify themselves either as Russians or citizens of these countries, or both, to varying degrees.

People who had arrived in [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] during the Soviet era, including their descendants born in these countries, mostly Russians, became [[Statelessness|stateless]] after the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and were provided only with an option to acquire naturalised citizenship. The language issue is still contentious, particularly in Latvia, where ethnic Russians have protested against plans to liquidate education in minority languages, including Russian. Since 1992, Estonia has naturalized some 137,000 residents of undefined citizenship, mainly ethnic Russians. 136,000, or 10 percent of the total population, remain without citizenship.
[[File:Russians ethnic 94.jpg|thumb|400px|Ethnic Russians in former Soviet Union states]]
Both the [[European Union]] and the [[Council of Europe]], as well as the [[Russian government]], expressed their concern during the 1990s about minority rights in several countries, most notably [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]]. In [[Moldova]], the [[Transnistria]] region (where 30.4% of population is Russian) broke away from government control amid fears the country would soon reunite with [[Romania]]. In June 2006, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] announced the plan to introduce a national policy aiming at encouraging ethnic Russians to immigrate to Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bigg |first=Claire |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/1070573.html |title=Latvia: Ethnic Russians Divided On Moscow's Repatriation Scheme |publisher=Rferl.org |date=2006-08-15 |accessdate=2012-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Significant numbers of Russians emigrated to [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and the [[United States]]. [[Brighton Beach, Brooklyn]] and [[South Beach, Staten Island]] in [[New York City]] is an example of a large community of recent Russian and [[Russian Jews|Jewish Russian]] immigrants. Other examples are [[Sunny Isles Beach]], a northern suburb of [[Miami]], and &quot;Little Moscow&quot; in [[Hollywood]] of the [[Los Angeles]] area.

At the same time, many ethnic Russians from former Soviet territories have emigrated to Russia itself since the 1990s. Many of them became refugees from a number of states of [[Central Asia]] and [[Caucasus]] (as well as from the separatist [[Chechen Republic]]), forced to flee during political unrest and hostilities towards Russians.

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]] in 1917, many Russians who were identified with the [[White army]] moved to [[China]] — most of them settling in [[Harbin]] and [[Shanghai]]. By the 1930s Harbin had 100,000 Russians. Many of these Russians had to move back to the Soviet Union after [[World War II]]. Today, a large group of people in northern China can still speak Russian as a second language.

[[Ethnic Russians in China|Russians (''eluosizu'')]] are one of the [[Nationalities of China|56 ethnic groups]] officially recognized by the [[People's Republic of China]] (as ''the Russ''); there are approximately 15,600 Russian Chinese living mostly in northern [[Xinjiang]], and also in [[Inner Mongolia]] and [[Heilongjiang]].

==Notable achievements==
[[File:Gagarin in Sweden.jpg|thumb|Right|150px|Yuri Gagarin, first human in space (1961)]]
Various Russians have greatly contributed to the world of [[music]], [[sports]], [[science]], technology and [[arts]]. Notable Russian [[scientists]] include [[Dmitri Mendeleev]], [[Nikolay Bogolyubov]], [[Andrei Kolmogorov]], [[Ivan Pavlov]], [[Nikolai Semyonov]], [[Dmitri Ivanenko]], [[Nikolai Lobachevsky]], [[Alexander Lodygin]], [[Alexander Stepanovich Popov|Alexander Popov]] (one of inventors of [[radio]]), [[Nikolay Yegorovich Zhukovsky|Nikolai Zhukovsky]], [[Alexander Prokhorov]] and [[Nikolay Basov]] (co-inventors of [[laser]]), [[Georgiy Gamov]], [[Vladimir Zworykin]], [[Lev Pontryagin]], [[Sergei Sobolev]], [[Pavel Yablochkov]], [[Aleksandr Butlerov]], [[Andrei Sakharov]], [[Dmitry Ivanovsky]], [[Sergey Korolyov]] and [[Mstislav Keldysh]] (creators of the [[Soviet space program]]), [[Aleksandr Lyapunov]], [[Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky]], [[Andrei Tupolev]], [[Yuri Denisyuk]] (the first practicable method of [[holography]]), [[Mikhail Lomonosov]],  [[Vladimir Vernadsky]], [[Pyotr Kapitsa]], [[Igor Sikorsky]], [[Ludvig Faddeev]], [[Zhores Alferov]], [[Konstantin Novoselov]], [[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy]], [[Nikolai Trubetzkoy]] etc.

The first man in space, [[Yuri Gagarin]], was Russian, and the first [[artificial satellite]] to be put into [[outer space]], [[Sputnik 1]], was launched by the [[Soviet Union]] and was developed mainly by [[Sergey Korolyov]] who had a Russian father (his mother was [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]).

[[Russian Literature]] representatives like [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Lev Tolstoy]], [[Ivan Turgenev]], [[Anton Chekhov]], [[Alexander Pushkin]], and many more, reached a high status in world [[literature]]. In the field of the novel, Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky, in particular, were important figures and have remained internationally renowned. Some scholars have described one or the other as the greatest novelist ever.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Russian literature.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. 16 July 2007 &lt;http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-29157&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russian composers]] who reached a high status in the world of [[music]] include [[Igor Stravinsky]], [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]], [[Dmitri Shostakovich]], [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov]], [[Sergei Prokofiev]], and [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]].

Russian people played a crucial role in the victory over [[Nazi Germany]] in [[World War II]]. Russia's casualties in this war were the highest of all nations, and numbered more than 20 million dead (Russians composed 80% of the 26.6 million people lost by the [[USSR]]), which is about half of all World War II casualties and the vast majority of Allied casualties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4530565.stm Leaders mourn Soviet wartime dead], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United Kingdom|British]] historian [[Richard Overy]], the Eastern Front included more combat than all the other European fronts combined. The [[Wehrmacht]] suffered 80% to 93% of all of its total World War II combat casualties on the Eastern Front.
