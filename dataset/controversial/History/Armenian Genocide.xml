The '''Armenian Genocide'''&lt;ref&gt;The International Association of Genocide Scholars, Affirmation, Armenian Genocide, &quot;That this assembly of the Association of Genocide Scholars in its conference held in Montreal, June 11–3, 1997, reaffirms that the mass murder of Armenians in Turkey in 1915 is a case of genocide which conforms to the statutes of the United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide. It further condemns the denial of the Armenian Genocide by the Turkish government and its official and unofficial agents and supporters&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-hy|Հայոց Ցեղասպանություն}}, {{IPA-hy|hɑˈjɔtsʰ tsʰɛʁɑspɑnuˈtʰjun|}}), also known as the '''Armenian Holocaust''', the '''Armenian Massacres''' and, traditionally among Armenians, as the '''Great Crime''' ({{lang-hy|Մեծ Եղեռն}}, {{IPA-hy|mɛts jɛˈʁɛrn|}}; English transliteration: Medz Yeghern [Medz/Great + Yeghern/Crime]&lt;ref&gt;H.

== Background ==
{{Main|Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Armenian population}}

=== Life under Ottoman rule ===

Armenia had come largely under Ottoman rule during the 15th and 16th centuries. The vast majority of Armenians, grouped together under the name [[Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Armenian ''millet'']] (community) and led by their spiritual head, the [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople]], were concentrated in the eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire (commonly referred to as [[Western Armenia]]), although large communities were also found in the western provinces, as well as in the capital [[Constantinople]]. The Armenian community was made up of three religious denominations: the [[Armenian Apostolic Church|Armenian Apostolic]] to which the overwhelming majority of Armenians belonged, and the [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian Catholic]] and [[Armenian Evangelical Church|Armenian Protestant]] communities. With the exception of the empire's urban centers and the extremely wealthy, Constantinople-based ''Amira'' class, a social elite whose members included the Duzians (Directors of the Imperial Mint), the [[Balyan family|Balyans]] (Chief Imperial Architects) and the [[Dadian family|Dadians]] (Superintendent of the Gunpowder Mills and manager of industrial factories), most Armenians &amp;mdash; approximately 70% of their population &amp;mdash; lived in poor and dangerous conditions in the rural countryside.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hagop Barsoumian|Barsoumian, Hagop]] (1982). &quot;The Dual Role of the Armenian Amira Class within the Ottoman Government and the Armenian Millet (1750–1850)&quot; in ''Christians and Jews in the Ottoman Empire: The Functioning of a Plural Society, Vol. I'', eds. Benjamin Braude and Bernard Lewis. New York: Holmes and Meier.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Barsoumian&quot;&gt;Barsoumian, Hagop (1997), &quot;The Eastern Question and the Tanzimat Era&quot;, in, ''The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times, II: Foreign Dominion to Statehood: The Fifteenth Century to the Twentieth Century'', ed. [[Richard G. Hovannisian]]. New York: St. Martin's Press, pp. 175–201. ISBN 0-312-10168-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

There, the Armenians were subject to the whims of their Turkish and Kurdish neighbors, who would regularly overtax them, subject them to [[brigandage]] and kidnapping, force them to convert to Islam, and otherwise exploit them without interference from central or local authorities.&lt;ref name = &quot;Barsoumian&quot; /&gt; In the Ottoman Empire, in accordance with the Muslim ''[[dhimmi]]'' system, they, like all other [[Christian]]s, were accorded certain limited freedoms (such as the right to worship), but were in essence treated as [[second-class citizen]]s and referred to in Turkish as ''[[Giaour|gavours]]'', a pejorative word meaning &quot;infidel&quot; or &quot;unbeliever&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Balakian&quot;&gt;{{citation | authorlink = Peter Balakian| last = Balakian | first = Peter | title = The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response | place = New York | publisher = HarperCollins | year = 2003 | ISBN = 0-06-019840-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |25, 445}} The British ethnographer, [[William Mitchell Ramsay|William Ramsay]], writing in the late 1890s after having visited the Ottoman Empire, described the conditions of the Armenians:

{{quote|Turkish rule...meant unutterable contempt...The Armenians (and Greeks) were dogs and pigs...to be spat upon, if their shadow darkened a Turk, to be outraged, to be the mats on which he wiped the mud from his feet. Conceive the inevitable result of centuries of slavery, of subjection to insult and scorn, centuries in which nothing belonged to the Armenian, neither his property, his house, his life, his person, nor his family, was sacred or safe from violence – capricious, unprovoked violence – to resist which by violence meant death.&lt;ref name = &quot;Balakian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |43}}}}

In addition to other legal limitations, Christians were not considered equals to [[Muslims]]: testimony against Muslims by Christians and Jews was inadmissible in courts of law; they were forbidden to carry weapons or ride atop horses; their houses could not overlook those of Muslims; and their religious practices were severely circumscribed (e.g., the ringing of church bells was strictly forbidden).&lt;ref name = &quot;Akçam&quot;&gt;{{citation | first = Taner | last = Akçam | authorlink = Taner Akçam | title = A Shameful Act: The Armenian Genocide and the Question of Turkish Responsibility | place = New York | publisher = Metropolitan Books | year = 2006 | ISBN = 0-8050-7932-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |24}}  Violation of these statutes could result in punishments ranging from the levying of exorbitant fines to execution.

=== Reform implementation, 1840s–80s ===
{{Main|Armenian Question}}
[[File:Ethnicturkey1911.jpg|thumb|right|280px|The majority of the Armenian population was concentrated in the east of the Ottoman Empire.]]
Beginning in the mid-19th century, the three major European powers, Great Britain, France and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] (known as the Great Powers), took issue with the Empire's treatment of its Christian minorities and increasingly pressured the Ottoman government (known as the [[Sublime Porte]]) to extend equal rights to all its citizens. Starting in 1839 and ending with the declaration of a constitution in 1876, the Ottoman government implemented a series of reforms, known as the [[Tanzimat]], to improve the situation of minorities, although these were all largely abortive. The Muslims of the empire were loath to consider the Christians as their social equals. By the late 1870s, the [[Greeks]], along with several other Christian nations in the [[Balkans]], frustrated with their conditions, had, often with the help of the Powers, broken free of Ottoman rule. The Armenians remained, by and large, passive during these years, earning them the title of ''millet-i sadika'' or the &quot;loyal millet.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Dadrian&quot;&gt;{{citation | authorlink = Vahakn Dadrian | last = Dadrian | first = Vahakn N | title = The History of the Armenian Genocide: Ethnic Conflict from the Balkans to Anatolia to the Caucasus | place = Oxford | publisher = Berghahn Books | year = 1995 | ISBN = 1-57181-666-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |192}}

In the mid-1860s and early 1870s, things began to change as an intellectual class began to emerge among Armenian society. Educated in the European university system or in American missionary schools in the Ottoman Empire, these Armenians began to question their second-class status in society and initiated a movement that asked for better treatment from their government. In one such instance, after amassing the signatures of peasants from Western Armenia, the Armenian Communal Council petitioned to the Ottoman government to redress the issues that the peasants complained about the most: &quot;the looting and murder in Armenian towns by [Muslim] [[Kurds]] and [[Circassians]], improprieties during tax collection, criminal behavior by government officials and the refusal to accept Christians as witnesses in trial.&quot;  The Ottoman government considered these grievances and promised to punish those responsible, though no meaningful steps were ever taken.&lt;ref name=&quot;Akçam&quot; /&gt;{{rp |36}}

Following the violent suppression of Christians in the uprisings in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Bulgaria]] and [[Serbia]] in 1875, the Great Powers invoked the 1856 [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] by claiming that it gave them the right to intervene and protect the Ottoman Empire's Christian minorities.&lt;ref name = &quot;Akçam&quot; /&gt;{{rp |35ff}}  Under growing pressure, the government of [[Ottoman Sultan|Sultan]] [[Abdul Hamid II]] declared itself a constitutional monarchy with a parliament (which was almost immediately [[Legislative_session#Common_procedure|prorogued]]) and entered into negotiations with the powers.  At the same time, the Armenian patriarchate of Constantinople, Nerses II, forwarded Armenian complaints of widespread &quot;forced land seizure… forced conversion of women and children, arson, [[Protection racket|protection extortion]], rape, and murder&quot; to the Powers.&lt;ref name = &quot;Akçam&quot; /&gt;{{rp |37}}

After the conclusion of the 1877–78 [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]], the Armenians began to look more toward the [[Russian Empire]] as the ultimate guarantors of their security. Nerses approached the Russian leadership during its negotiations with the Ottomans in [[San Stefano]] and in the [[Treaty of San Stefano|eponymous treaty]], convinced them to insert a clause, Article 16, stipulating that the Russian forces occupying the Armenian-populated provinces in the eastern Ottoman Empire would withdraw only with the full implementation of reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = [[Treaty of San Stefano]] | section = Article 16 | quote = As the evacuation of the Russian troops of the territory they occupy in Armenia...might give rise to conflicts and complications detrimental to the maintenance of good relations between the two countries, the [[Sublime Porte]] engaged to carry into effect, without further delay, the improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces inhabited by Armenians and to guarantee their security from Kurds and [[Circassians]].}}&lt;/ref&gt; Great Britain was troubled with Russia's holding on to so much Ottoman territory and forced it to enter into new negotiations with the convening of the [[Congress of Berlin]] in June 1878. Armenians also entered into these negotiations and emphasized that they sought [[autonomy]], not independence from the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name = &quot;Akçam&quot; /&gt;{{rp |38}} They partially succeeded, as Article 61 of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] contained the same text as Article 16 but removed any mention that Russian forces would remain in the provinces; instead, the Ottoman government was periodically to inform the Great Powers of the progress of the reforms.

=== Armenian revolutionary movement ===
{{Main|Armenian Revolutionary Movement}}
As it turned out, the reforms were not forthcoming. Upset with this turn of events, a number of disillusioned Armenian intellectuals living in Europe and Russia decided to form political parties and societies dedicated to the betterment of their compatriots living inside the Ottoman Empire. In the last quarter of the 19th century, this movement came to be dominated by three parties: the Ramkavar (Constitutional-Democrat; Armenakan), [[Social Democrat Hunchakian Party]], and the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]] (Dashnaktsutiun).  While the parties differed somewhat in ideology, they were all committed to the same goal of seeing the social status of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire improve. Parallel to their efforts, another group of Armenians, seeing the futility of asking for reforms and the unwillingness of the European powers in pressuring the Ottoman government to implement reforms, were convinced that the only possibility of improving the plight of the Armenians was through self-defense.&lt;ref&gt;Nalbandian, Louise.

=== Hamidian Massacres, 1894–96 ===
{{Main|Hamidian Massacres}}
Since 1876, the Ottoman state had been led by Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]]. From the beginning of the reform period after the signing of the Berlin treaty, Hamid II attempted to stall their implementation and asserted that Armenians did not make up a majority in the provinces and that Armenian reports of abuses were largely exaggerated or false. In 1890, Hamid II created a [[paramilitary]] outfit known as the ''[[Hamidiye (cavalry)|Hamidiye]]'' which was made up of Kurdish irregulars who were tasked to &quot;deal with the Armenians as they wished.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Balakian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |40}} As Ottoman officials intentionally provoked rebellions (often as a result of over-taxation) in Armenian populated towns, such as in [[Sasun Resistance (1894)|Sasun]] in 1894 and [[Zeitun Rebellion (1895–1896)|Zeitun]] in 1895–96, these regiments were increasingly used to deal with the Armenians by way of oppression and massacre.  In some instances, Armenians successfully fought off the regiments and brought the excesses to the attention of the Great Powers in 1895 who subsequently condemned the Porte.&lt;ref name = &quot;Akçam&quot; /&gt;{{rp |40–2}}

The Powers forced Hamid to sign a new reform package designed to curtail the powers of the ''Hamidiye'' in October 1895 which, like the Berlin treaty, was never implemented. On October 1, 1895, 2,000 Armenians assembled in Constantinople to petition for the implementation of the reforms but Ottoman police units converged towards the rally and violently broke it up.&lt;ref name = &quot;Balakian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |57–8}}  Soon, massacres of Armenians broke out in Constantinople and then engulfed the rest of the Armenian-populated provinces of [[Bitlis]], [[Diyarbekir]], [[Erzerum]], [[Harput]], [[Sivas]], [[Trabzon]] and [[Van]]. Estimates differ on how many Armenians were killed but European documentation of the violence, which became known as the [[Hamidian massacres]], placed the figures from anywhere between 100–300,000&amp;nbsp;Armenians.&lt;ref&gt;The German Foreign Ministry operative, Ernst Jackh, estimated that 200,000 Armenians were killed and a further 50,000 expelled from the provinces during the Hamidian unrest. French diplomats placed the figures to 250,000 killed. The German pastor [[Johannes Lepsius]] was more meticulous in his calculations, counting the deaths of 88,000&amp;nbsp;Armenians and the destruction of 2,500&amp;nbsp;villages, 645&amp;nbsp;churches and monasteries, and the plundering of hundreds of churches, of which 328 were converted into mosques.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hamid was never directly implicated in ordering the massacres, it is believed that they had his tacit encouragement approval.&lt;ref name = &quot;Akçam&quot; /&gt;{{rp |42}} Frustrated with European indifference to the massacres, Armenians from the Dashnaktsutiun party [[1896 Ottoman Bank Takeover|seized]] the European-managed [[Ottoman Bank]] on August 26, 1896. This incident brought further sympathy for Armenians in Europe and was lauded by the European and American press, which vilified Hamid and painted him as the &quot;great assassin&quot; and &quot;bloody Sultan.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Balakian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |35,115}} While the Great Powers vowed to take action and enforce new reforms, these never came into fruition due to conflicting political and economic interests.

==Prelude to genocide==

=== The Young Turk Revolution of 1908 ===
{{Main|Young Turk Revolution|Dissolution of the Ottoman Empire}}

On July 24, 1908, Armenians' hopes for equality in the empire brightened once more when a [[coup d'état]] staged by officers in the [[Turkish Third Army]] based in [[Salonika]] removed Abdul Hamid from power and restored the country to a constitutional monarchy. The officers were part of the [[Young Turks|Young Turk]] movement that wanted to reform administration of the decadent state of the Ottoman Empire and modernize it to European standards. The movement was an anti-Hamidian coalition made up of two distinct groups: the [[Secularity|secular]] [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[constitutionalism|constitutionalists]] and the [[Nationalism|nationalists]]; the former was more [[democracy|democratic]] and accepted Armenians into their wing whereas the latter was more intolerant in regard to Armenian-related issues and their frequent requests for European assistance.&lt;ref name =
&quot;Balakian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |140–1}}  In 1902, during a congress of the Young Turks held in Paris, the heads of the liberal wing, [[Sabahheddin Bey]] and [[Ahmed Riza]], partially persuaded the nationalists to include in their objectives to ensure some rights to all the minorities of the empire.

One of the numerous factions within the Young Turk movement was a secret revolutionary organization called The Committee of Union and Progress. It drew its proliferating membership from disaffected army officers based in Salonika and was behind a wave of mutinies against the central government. In 1908, elements of the Third Army and the Second Army Corps declared their opposition to the Sultan and threatened to march on the capital to depose him. Hamid, shaken by the wave of resentment, stepped down from power as Armenians, Greeks, [[Arab]]s, [[Bulgarians]] and Turks alike rejoiced in his dethronement.&lt;ref name = &quot;Balakian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |143–4}}

=== The Adana Massacre of 1909 ===
{{Main|Adana Massacre}}
[[File:Adanamass.PNG|thumb|right|220px|An Armenian town left pillaged and destroyed after the massacres in [[Adana]] in 1909.]]
A [[Countercoup of 1909|countercoup]] took place on April 13, 1909. Some Ottoman military elements, joined by [[Islamism|Islamic]] [[theological]] students, aimed to return control of the country to the Sultan and the rule of [[Sharia|Islamic law]]. Riots and fighting broke out between the reactionary forces and CUP forces, until the CUP was able to put down the uprising and [[court-martial]] the opposition leaders.

While the movement initially targeted the Young Turk government, it spilled over into [[pogrom]]s against Armenians who were perceived as having supported the restoration of the [[Second Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|constitution]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Akçam&quot; /&gt;{{rp |68–9}}  When Ottoman Army troops were called in, many accounts record that instead of trying to quell the violence they actually took part in pillaging Armenian enclaves in [[Adana]] province.&lt;ref name=daysof&gt;{{cite news |title= Days of horror described; American missionary an eyewitness of murder and rapine |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50612F63A5512738DDDA10A94DC405B898CF1D3 |date=1909-04-28 |publisher= New York Times |accessdate= 2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 15,000–30,000&amp;nbsp;Armenians were killed in the course of the &quot;[[Adana Massacre]]&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Akçam&quot; /&gt;{{rp |69}}&lt;ref name= 30t&gt;{{cite news |title=30,000 Killed in massacres; Conservative estimate of victims of Turkish fanaticism in Adana Vilayet |url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50C10F93C5A15738DDDAC0A94DC405B898CF1D3 |date=1909-04-25 | publisher=''New York Times'' |accessdate= 2008-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Balkan wars===
In 1912, the [[First Balkan War]] broke out and resulted in a defeat of the Ottoman Empire and the loss of 85% of its territory in Europe. Many in the empire saw their defeat as &quot;Allah's divine punishment for a society that did not know how to pull itself together.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Akçam&quot; /&gt;{{rp |84}} The Turkish nationalist movement in the country gradually came to view Anatolia as their last refuge. That the Armenian population formed a significant minority in this region would figure prominently in the calculations of the Young Turks who would eventually carry out the Armenian Genocide.

An important consequence of the Balkan Wars was also the mass expulsion of Muslims (known as ''muhajirs'') from the Balkans. In fact, beginning in the mid-19th century, hundreds of thousands of Muslims, including [[Circassians]] and [[Chechens]], were expelled or forced to flee from the Caucasus and the Balkans ([[Rumelia]]) as a result of the Russo-Turkish wars and the conflicts in the Balkans. Muslim society in the empire was incensed by this flood of refugees and overcome by a sense of revenge. A journal published in Constantinople expressed the mood of the times: &quot;Let this be a warning...O Muslims, don't get comfortable! Do not let your blood cool before taking revenge.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Akçam&quot; /&gt;{{rp |86}} As many as 850,000 of these refugees were settled in areas where the Armenians were resident from the period of 1878–1904. The ''muhajirs'' resented the status of their relatively well-off neighbors and, as historian [[Taner Akçam]] and others have noted, the refugees would come to play a pivotal role in the killings of the Armenians and the confiscation of their properties during the genocide.&lt;ref name = &quot;Akçam&quot; /&gt;{{rp |86–87}}

== World War I ==
{{See also|Middle Eastern theatre of World War I}}
On November 2, 1914, the Ottoman Empire entered World War I on the side of the [[Central Powers]]. The [[Middle Eastern theatre of World War I|Middle Eastern theatre]] of World War I became the scene of action. The combatants were the Ottoman Empire, with some assistance from the other [[Central Powers]], and primarily the [[British Empire|British]] and the [[Russian Empire|Russians]] among the [[Allies of World War I]]. The conflicts at the [[Caucasus Campaign]], the [[Persian Campaign]] and the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} affected where the Armenian people lived in significant amounts. Before the declaration of war at the [[Armenian congress at Erzurum]] the [[Imperial Government (Ottoman Empire)|Ottoman government]] requested the Ottoman Armenians to facilitate the conquest of [[Transcaucasia]] by inciting a rebellion with the [[Russian Armenians]] against the tsarist army in the event of a [[Caucasus Campaign|Caucasus front]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Akçam&quot; /&gt;{{rp |136}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last1 = Walker | first1 = Christopher J | authorlink = Christopher J. Walker | year = | chapter = World War I and the Armenian Genocide | url = | title = The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times | volume = II | page = 244}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Battle of Sarikamish ===
{{See also|Caucasus Campaign}}
On December 24, 1914 Minister of War [[Enver Pasha]] developed a plan to encircle and destroy the Russian [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Caucasus Army]] at [[Sarikamish]], to regain territories lost to Russia after the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877–78. Enver Pasha's forces were routed at the [[Battle of Sarikamis]], and almost completely destroyed.

In the summer of 1914, [[Armenian volunteer units]] were established under the Russian Armed forces. As the Russian Armenian conscripts had already been sent to the European Front, this force was uniquely established from Armenians that were not Russian or who were not obligated to serve.  An Ottoman representative, [[Karekin Bastermadjian]] (Armen Karo), was also brought into to this force. Initially they had 20,000 men, but it was reported that their number subsequently increased. Returning to Constantinople, Enver publicly blamed his defeat on Armenians in the region having actively sided with the Russians.&lt;ref name = &quot;Balakian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |200}}

=== Labor battalions, February 25 ===
{{Further2|[[Ottoman labour battalions]]}}
On February 25, 1915, The War minister [[Enver Pasha]] sent an order to all military units that Armenians in the active Ottoman forces be demobilized and assigned to the unarmed [[Labour battalion]] (Turkish: ''amele taburlari'').  Enver Pasha explained this decision as &quot;out of fear that they would collaborate with the Russians&quot;.  As a tradition, the Ottoman Army drafted non-Muslim males only between the ages of 20 and 45 into the regular army. The younger (15–20) and older (45–60) non-Muslim soldiers had always been used as logistical support through the labor battalions. Before February, some of the Armenian recruits were utilized as laborers (''hamals''), though they would ultimately be executed.&lt;ref&gt;Toynbee, Arnold.  ''Armenian Atrocities: The Murder of a Nation''. London: Hodder and Stoughton, 1915, pp. 181–2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Transferring Armenian conscripts from active field (armed) to passive, unarmed logistic section was an important aspect of the subsequent genocide. As reported in &quot;[[The Memoirs of Naim Bey]]&quot;, the extermination of the Armenians in these battalions was part of a premeditated strategy on behalf of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]]. Many of these Armenian recruits were executed by local Turkish gangs.&lt;ref name = &quot;Balakian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |178}}

=== Events at Van, April 1915 ===
{{Further2|[[Siege of Van]]}}
[[File:Van Defenders.jpg|thumb|235px|Armed Armenian civilians and self-defense units holding a line against Ottoman forces in the walled [[Siege of Van]] in May 1915.]]
On April 19, 1915, [[Jevdet Bey]] demanded that the [[city of Van]] immediately furnish him 4,000&amp;nbsp;soldiers under the pretext of [[conscription]].  However, it was clear to the Armenian population that his goal was to massacre the able-bodied men of Van so that there would be no defenders. Jevdet Bey had already used his official writ in nearby villages, ostensibly to search for arms, but in fact to initiate wholesale massacres.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balakian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |202}}  The Armenians offered five hundred soldiers and exemption money for the rest in order to buy time, but Djevdet accused Armenians of &quot;rebellion&quot; and asserted his determination to &quot;crush&quot; it at any cost. &quot;If the rebels fire a single shot&quot;, he declared, &quot;I shall kill every Christian man, woman, and&quot; (pointing to his knee) &quot;every child, up to here.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Morgenthau&quot;&gt;{{citation | last = Morgenthau | first = Henry | year = 1918 | title = Ambassador Morgenthau's Story | place = Garden City, New York | publisher = Doubleday | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=ENsLAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=morgenthau%27s+story#PRA1-PA336,M1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |298}}

On April 20, 1915, the armed conflict of the [[Siege of Van]] began when an Armenian woman was harassed and the two Armenian men that came to her aid were killed by Ottoman soldiers. The Armenian defenders protected 30,000&amp;nbsp;residents and 15,000&amp;nbsp;refugees in an area of roughly one square kilometer of the Armenian Quarter and suburb of Aigestan with 1,500&amp;nbsp;ablebodied riflemen who were supplied with 300&amp;nbsp;rifles and 1,000&amp;nbsp;pistols and antique weapons. The conflict lasted until [[General Yudenich]] came to rescue them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Hinterhoff |first = Eugene |title =Persia: The Stepping Stone To India. Marshall Cavendish Illustrated Encyclopedia of World War I | volume = iv |pages = 1153–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar reports reached Morgenthau from Aleppo and Van, prompting him to raise the issue in person with Talaat and Enver. As he quoted to them the testimonies of his consulate officials, they justified the deportations as necessary to the conduct of the war, suggesting that complicity of the Armenians of Van with the Russian forces that had taken the city justified the persecution of all ethnic Armenians.

=== Arrest and deportation of Armenian notables, April 1915 ===
{{Further2|[[Armenian notables deported from the Ottoman capital in 1915]]}}
[[File:April24Victims.jpg|thumb|220px|Armenian intellectuals who were arrested and later executed ''en masse'' by Ottoman authorities on the night of April 24, 1915.]]
On April 24, 1915, [[Red Sunday]] ({{lang-hy|Կարմիր Կիրակի}}), was the night on which the leaders of Armenians of the Ottoman capital, [[Constantinople]], and later extending to other Ottoman centers were arrested and moved to two holding centers near Ankara by then minister of interior [[Mehmed Talaat]] Bey with his [[s:Circular on April 24, 1915|order on April 24, 1915]]. These Armenians were later deported with the passage of Tehcir Law on 29 May 1915. The date 24 April, [[Genocide Remembrance Day]], commemorates the Armenian notables deported from the Ottoman capital in 1915, as the precursor to the ensuing events.

[[File:Talat Pasha.jpg|thumb|230px|Interior Minister [[Talaat Pasha]], who ordered the arrests.]]
In his order, [[s:Circular on April 24, 1915|order on April 24, 1915]], Talaat claimed &quot;have long been pursuing to gain an administrative autonomy and this desire is displayed once more, in no uncertain terms, with the inclusion of the Russian Armenians who have assumed a position against us together with the Daschnak Committee in no time in the regions of Zeytûn ([[Zeitun Resistance (1915)]]), Bitlis, Sivas, and Van ([[Siege of Van]]) in accordance with the decisions they have previously taken ([[Armenian congress at Erzurum]]).&quot; By 1914, Ottoman authorities had already begun a [[propaganda]] drive to present Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire as a threat to the empire's security. An [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman naval]] officer in the War Office described the planning:

{{quote |In order to justify this enormous crime the requisite propaganda material was thoroughly prepared in Constantinople.  [It included such statements as] &quot;the Armenians are in league with the enemy.  They will launch an uprising in Istanbul, kill off the Committee of Union and Progress leaders and will succeed in opening the straits (of the [[Dardanelles]]).&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Dadrian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |220}}}}

On the night of April 24, 1915, the Ottoman government rounded up and imprisoned an estimated [[Armenian notables deported from the Ottoman capital in 1915|250 Armenian intellectuals and community leaders]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Balakian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |211–2}}  This date coincided with Allied troop landings at [[Battle of Gallipoli|Gallipoli]] after unsuccessful Allied [[Naval operations in the Dardanelles Campaign|naval]] attempts to break through the Dardanelles to Constantinople in February and March 1915.

===Triple Entente's reaction===
On May 24, 1915, the [[Triple Entente]] warned the [[Ottoman Empire]] that &quot;In view of these new crimes of Turkey against humanity and civilization, the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Governments]] announce publicly to the Sublime Porte that they will hold personally responsible for these crimes all members of the Ottoman Government, as well as those of their agents who are implicated in such massacres.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;H.RES.316&quot;&gt;1915 declaration

They told the Russians that the stench of the burning human flesh permeated the air for many days after.&quot;

====Drowning====
Trabzon was the main city in Trabzon province; Oscar S. Heizer, the American consul at Trabzon, reports: &quot;This plan did not suit Nail Bey.... Many of the children were loaded into boats and taken out to sea and thrown overboard.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;April 11, 1919 report. U.S. National Archives.

The psychiatrist Robert Jay Lifton writes in a parenthesis when introducing the crimes of Nazi doctors, &quot;Perhaps Turkish doctors, in their participation in the genocide against the Armenians, come closest, as I shall later suggest.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lifton, Robert Jay. ''Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide'', New York: Basic Books, 1986, p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Morphine overdose:''' During the Trabzon trial series of the Martial court, from the sittings between March 26 and May 17, 1919, the Trabzons Health Services Inspector Dr. Ziya Fuad wrote in a report that Dr. Saib caused the death of children with the injection of morphine.

'''Typhoid inoculation:''' The Ottoman surgeon, Dr. Haydar Cemal wrote &quot;on the order of the Chief Sanitation Office of the Third Army in January 1916, when the spread of typhus was an acute problem, innocent Armenians slated for deportation at Erzican were inoculated with the blood of typhoid fever patients without rendering that blood ‘inactive’.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Türkce Istanbul'', No. 45, 23 December 1918.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Renaissance'', 26 December 1918.&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy Hugh Baron writes: &quot;Individual doctors were directly involved in the massacres, having poisoned infants, killed children and issued false certificates of death from natural causes.

[[File:Morgenthau336.jpg|thumb|215px|Of this photo, the United States ambassador wrote,&lt;ref name = &quot;Morgenthau&quot; /&gt;  &quot;Scenes like this were common all over the Armenian provinces, in the spring and summer months of 1915. Death in its several forms—massacre, [[starvation]], [[exhaustion]]—destroyed the larger part of the [[refugee]]s. The Turkish policy was that of [[genocide|extermination]] under the guise of [[deportation]].&quot;]]

In May 1915, [[Mehmed Talaat Pasha]] requested that the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]] and [[Grand Vizier]] [[Said Halim Pasha]] legalize a measure for relocation and settlement of Armenians to other places due to what Talaat Pasha called &quot;the Armenian riots and massacres, which had arisen in a number of places in the country.&quot; However, Talaat Pasha was referring specifically to events in [[Siege of Van|Van]] and extending the implementation to the regions in which alleged &quot;riots and massacres&quot; would affect the security of the war zone of the [[Caucasus Campaign]].  Later, the scope of the immigration was widened in order to include the Armenians in the other provinces.

On 29 May 1915, the CUP Central Committee passed the [[Tehcir Law|Temporary Law of Deportation]] (&quot;Tehjir Law&quot;), giving the Ottoman government and military authorization to deport anyone it &quot;sensed&quot; as a threat to national security.&lt;ref name = &quot;Balakian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |186–8}}  The &quot;Tehjir Law&quot; brought some measures regarding the property of the deportees, but during September a new law was proposed. By means of the &quot;Abandoned Properties&quot; Law (Law Concerning Property, Dept's and Assets Left Behind Deported Persons, also referred as the &quot;Temporary Law on Expropriation and Confiscation&quot;), the Ottoman government took possession of all &quot;abandoned&quot; Armenian goods and properties.  Ottoman parliamentary representative [[Ahmed Riza]] protested this legislation:

{{quote |It is unlawful to designate the Armenian assets as &quot;abandoned goods&quot; for the Armenians, the proprietors, did not abandon their properties voluntarily; they were forcibly, compulsorily removed from their domiciles and exiled. Now the government through its efforts is selling their goods…  If we are a constitutional regime functioning in accordance with constitutional law we can’t do this. This is atrocious. Grab my arm, eject me from my village, then sell my goods and properties, such a thing can never be permissible. Neither the conscience of the Ottomans nor the law can allow it.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Bayur, ''Turk Inkilabz'', vol. III, part 3, in Dadrian, ''History of the Armenian Genocide''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 13 September 1915, the Ottoman parliament passed the &quot;Temporary Law of Expropriation and Confiscation&quot;, stating that all property, including land, livestock, and homes belonging to Armenians, was to be confiscated by the authorities.&lt;ref name = &quot;Dadrian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |224}}

With the implementation of [[Tehcir law]], the confiscation of Armenian property and the slaughter of Armenians that ensued upon the law's enactment outraged much of the [[western world]]. While the Ottoman Empire's wartime allies offered little protest, a wealth of German and Austrian historical documents has since come to attest to the witnesses' horror at the killings and mass starvation of Armenians.&lt;ref name = &quot;Fisk&quot;&gt;{{citation | authorlink = Robert Fisk | last = Fisk | first = Robert | title = [[The Great War for Civilisation: The Conquest of the Middle East]] | place = New York | publisher = Alfred A Knopf | year = 2005 | ISBN = 1-84115-007-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |329–31}}&lt;ref name = &quot;Fromkin&quot;&gt;{{citation | authorlink = David Fromkin| last = Fromkin | first = David | title = [[A Peace to End All Peace|A Peace to End All Peace: The Fall of the Ottoman Empire and the Creation of the Modern Middle East]] | place = New York | publisher = Avon Books | year = 1989 | ISBN = 0-8050-6884-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |212–3}}&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | place = USA | url = http://www.pbs.org/greatwar/chapters/ch2_voices2.html | title = The Great War | chapter = 2 | publisher = PBS}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported almost daily on the mass murder of the Armenian people, describing the process as &quot;systematic&quot;, &quot;authorized&quot; and &quot;organized by the government.&quot;  [[Theodore Roosevelt]] would later characterize this as &quot;the greatest crime of the war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Ruth. &quot;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/12/15/EDGGA3G8H21.DTL The hidden holocaust].&quot; ''San Francisco Chronicle''.

====Death marches====
[[File:Dead Armenian girl in Aleppo desert.jpg|thumb|210px|An Armenian woman kneeling beside dead child in field &quot;within sight of help and safety at Aleppo.&quot;]]
The Armenians were marched out to the [[Syria]]n town of [[Deir ez-Zor]] and the [[Deir ez-Zor Camps|surrounding desert]]. A good deal of evidence suggests that the Ottoman government did not provide any facilities or supplies to sustain the Armenians during their deportation, nor when they arrived.&lt;ref name= &quot;StarveNYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last = |first = |coauthors = |title = Exiled Armenians starve in the desert; Turks drive them like slaves, American committee hears ;- Treatment raises death rate | pages = |language = |publisher =New York Times |date= August 8, 1916 |url =http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00C17F73C5F13738DDDA10894D0405B868DF1D3 | accessdate = 2007-09-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071026001641/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00C17F73C5F13738DDDA10894D0405B868DF1D3| archivedate= 26 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By August 1915, ''The New York Times'' repeated an unattributed report that &quot;the roads and the [[Euphrates]] are strewn with corpses of exiles, and those who survive are doomed to certain death.

Ottoman troops escorting the Armenians not only allowed others to rob, kill, and rape the Armenians, but often participated in these activities themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;StarveNYT&quot; /&gt; Deprived of their belongings and marched into the desert, hundreds of thousands of Armenians perished.

German engineers and laborers involved in building the railway also witnessed Armenians being crammed into cattle cars and shipped along the railroad line. Franz Gunther, a representative for [[Deutsche Bank]] which was funding the construction of the Baghdad Railway, forwarded photographs to his directors and expressed his frustration at having to remain silent amid such &quot;bestial cruelty&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Balakian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |326}}  Major General [[Otto von Lossow]], acting military attaché and head of the German Military [[Plenipotentiary]] in the Ottoman Empire, spoke to Ottoman intentions in a conference held in [[Batum]] in 1918:

{{quote |The Turks have embarked upon the &quot;total extermination of the Armenians in [[Transcaucasia]]…  The aim of Turkish policy is, as I have reiterated, the taking of possession of Armenian districts and the extermination of the Armenians. Talaat's government wants to destroy all Armenians, not just in Turkey but also outside Turkey.

====Extermination camps====
It is believed that 25&amp;nbsp;major [[concentration camp]]s existed, under the command of [[Şükrü Kaya]], one of the right-hand men of Talaat Pasha.  The majority of the camps were situated near Turkey's modern [[Iraq]]i and Syrian borders, and some were only temporary transit camps.  Others, such as [[Radjo]], [[Katma]], and [[Azaz]], are said to have been used only temporarily, for [[mass grave]]s; these sites were vacated by autumn 1915.  Some authors also maintain that the camps [[Lale]], [[Tefridje]], [[Dipsi]], [[Del-El]], and [[Ra's al-'Ayn Camps|Ra's al-'Ayn]] were built specifically for those who had a life expectancy of a few days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kotek&quot;&gt;{{fr icon}} Kotek, Joël and Pierre Rigoulot.

====Relief====

{{See also|American Committee for Relief in the Near East}}
The American Committee for Relief in the Near East is a relief organization established in 1915, just after the deportations, whose primary aim was to alleviate the suffering of the Armenian people.  Henry Morgenthau played a key role in rallying support for the organization. Between 1915 and 1930, distributed humanitarian relief across a wide range of geographical locations.  ACRNE eventually spent over ten times the initial estimate, see [[:File:Near East Relief Report 1919 - The New York Times Current History - May 1919.png|original estimate]], that amount and helped an estimated close to 2,000,000 refugees.&lt;ref&gt;Suzanne E. Moranian.  &quot;The Armenian Genocide and American Missionary Relief Efforts&quot;, in ''America and the Armenian Genocide of 1915''.  Jay Winter (ed.) Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In its first year, the ACRNE cared for 132,000 Armenian orphans from [[Tiflis]], [[Yerevan]], [[Constantinople]], [[Sivas]], [[Beirut]], [[Damascus]], and [[Jerusalem]]. A relief organization for refugees in the Middle East helped donate over $102 million (budget $117,000,000) [1930 value of dollar] to Armenians both during and after the war.&lt;ref name = &quot;Oren&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Oren | first = Michael B | authorlink = Michael B.

=== Trials ===

==== Turkish courts-martial ====
{{Main|Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919–20}}
In 1919, Sultan [[Mehmed VI]] ordered domestic courts-martial to try members of the [[Committee of Union and Progress]] (CUP) (Turkish: &quot;''Ittihat Terakki''&quot;) for their role in taking the Ottoman Empire into World War I. The courts-martial blamed the members of CUP for pursuing a war that did not fit into the notion of [[Millet (Ottoman Empire)|Millet]]. The Armenian issue was used as a tool to punish the leaders of the CUP. Most of the documents generated in these courts were later moved to international trials. By January 1919, a report to Sultan [[Mehmed VI]] accused over 130 suspects, most of whom were high officials. The military court found that it was the will of the CUP to eliminate the Armenians physically, via its [[Special Organization (Ottoman Empire)|special organization]]. The 1919 pronouncement reads as follows:

{{quote |[[Turkish Courts-Martial of 1919-20|The Court Martial]] taking into consideration the above-named crimes declares, unanimously, the culpability as principal factors of these crimes the fugitives [[Talat Pasha]], former Grand Vizir, [[Enver Efendi]], former War Minister, struck off the register of the Imperial Army, Cemal Efendi, former Navy Minister, struck off too from the Imperial Army, and Dr. Nazim Efendi, former Minister of Education, members of the General [[Committee of Union and Progress|Council of the Union &amp; Progress]], representing the moral person of that party;… the Court Martial pronounces, in accordance with said stipulations of the Law the death penalty against Talat, Enver, Cemal, and Dr. Nazim.}}

The term [[Three Pashas]], which include [[Mehmed Talaat Pasha]] and [[Ismail Enver]], refers to the triumvirate who had fled the Empire at the end of World War I. At the trials in Constantinople in 1919 they were sentenced to death in absentia.  The courts-martial officially disbanded the CUP and confiscated its assets, and the assets of those found guilty. At least two of the three were later assassinated by [[Operation Nemesis|Armenian vigilantes]].

==== International trials ====
{{Main|Malta exiles|Malta Tribunals}}

Following the [[Armistice of Mudros|Mudros Armistice]], the preliminary [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Peace Conference in Paris]] established &quot;The Commission on Responsibilities and Sanctions&quot; in January 1919, which was chaired by US Secretary of State Lansing. Based on the commission's work, several articles were added to the [[Treaty of Sèvres]], and the acting government of the [[Ottoman Empire]], Sultan [[Mehmed VI]] and [[Damat Adil Ferit Pasha]], were summoned to trial. The Treaty of Sèvres (August 1920) planned a trial to determine those responsible for the &quot;barbarous and illegitimate methods of warfare… [including] offenses against the laws and customs of war and the principles of humanity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nazi&quot;/&gt; Article 230 of the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] required the Ottoman Empire &quot;hand over to the Allied Powers the persons whose surrender may be required by the latter as being responsible for the massacres committed during the continuance of the state of war on territory which formed part of the [[Ottoman Empire]] on August 1, 1914.&quot;

Various Ottoman politicians, generals, and intellectuals were [[Malta exiles|transferred to Malta]], where they were held for some three years while searches were made of archives in Constantinople, London, Paris and Washington to investigate their actions.&lt;ref&gt;Türkei By Klaus-Detlev. Grothusen.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Inter-allied tribunal attempt]] demanded by the Treaty of Sèvres never solidified and the detainees were eventually returned to Turkey in exchange for British citizens held by Kemalist Turkey.

==== Trial of Soghomon Tehlirian ====
{{See also|Operation Nemesis}}
On March 15, 1921, former [[Grand Vizier]] [[Talaat Pasha]] was assassinated in the [[Charlottenburg]] District of Berlin, Germany, in broad daylight and in the presence of many witnesses. Talaat's death was part of &quot;''[[Operation Nemesis]]''&quot;, the [[Armenian Revolutionary Federation]]'s codename for their covert operation in the 1920s to kill the [[Young Turks|planners]] of the Armenian Genocide.

The subsequent trial of the assassin, [[Soghomon Tehlirian]], had an important influence on [[Raphael Lemkin]], a [[lawyer]] of [[Poles|Polish]]&amp;ndash;[[Jewish]] descent who campaigned in the [[League of Nations]] to ban what he called &quot;barbarity&quot; and &quot;vandalism&quot;. The term &quot;[[genocide]]&quot;, created in 1943, was coined by Lemkin who was directly influenced by the massacres of Armenians during World War I.&lt;ref name = &quot;Bloxham&quot;&gt;{{citation | last = Bloxham | first = Donald | title = The Great Game of Genocide: Imperialism, Nationalism, and the Destruction of the Ottoman Armenians | place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |210}}

Hundreds of eyewitnesses, including the neutral United States and the Ottoman Empire's own allies, Germany and [[Austria-Hungary]], recorded and documented numerous acts of state-sponsored massacres.

As the orders for deportations and massacres were enacted, many consular officials reported to the ambassador what they were witnessing. In his memoirs which he completed writing in 1918, Morgenthau wrote, &quot;When the Turkish authorities gave the orders for these deportations, they were merely giving the death warrant to a whole race; they understood this well, and, in their conversations with me, they made no particular attempt to conceal the fact…&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Morgenthau&quot; /&gt;{{rp |309}}  In memoirs and reports, their staff vividly described the brutal methods used by Ottoman forces and documented numerous instances of atrocities committed against the Christian minority.&lt;ref&gt;James L.

=== Allied forces in the Middle East ===
On the Middle Eastern front, the British military was engaged fighting the Ottoman forces in southern Syria and [[Mesopotamia]]. British diplomat [[Gertrude Bell]] filed the following report after hearing the account from a captured Ottoman soldier:

{{quote |The battalion left Aleppo on 3 February and reached Ras al-Ain in twelve hours… some 12,000 Armenians were concentrated under the guardianship of some hundred [[Kurds]]…  These Kurds were called gendarmes, but in reality mere butchers; bands of them were publicly ordered to take parties of Armenians, of both sexes, to various destinations, but had secret instructions to destroy the males, children and old women…  One of these gendarmes confessed to killing 100 Armenian men himself… the empty desert cisterns and caves were also filled with corpses…&lt;ref name = &quot;Fisk&quot; /&gt;{{rp |327}}}}

[[Winston Churchill]] described the massacres as an &quot;administrative holocaust&quot; and noted that &quot;the clearance of the race from Asia Minor was about as complete as such an act, on a scale so great, could well be. […] There is no reasonable doubt that this crime was planned and executed for political reasons.

Reacting to numerous eyewitness accounts, British politician [[Viscount Bryce]] and historian Toynbee compiled statements from survivors and eyewitnesses from other countries including Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Sweden, and Switzerland, who similarly attested to the systematized massacring of innocent Armenians by Ottoman government forces.&lt;ref&gt;''The Treatment of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire, 1915–1916: Documents Presented to Viscount Grey of Falloden by Viscount Bryce, James Bryce and Arnold Toynbee, Uncensored Edition''. Ara Safarian (ed.) Princeton, New Jersey: Gomidas Institute, 2000. ISBN 0-9535191-5-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book has since been criticized as British wartime propaganda to build up sentiment against the Central Powers, but Bryce had submitted the work to scholars for verification before its publication.  [[University of Oxford]] Regius Professor [[Gilbert Murray]] stated, &quot;…the evidence of these letters and reports will bear any scrutiny and overpower any skepticism. Their genuineness is established beyond question.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Dadrian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |228}}  Other professors, including [[Herbert Fisher]] of [[Sheffield University]] and former [[American Bar Association]] president [[Moorfield Storey]], came to the same conclusion.&lt;ref name = &quot;Dadrian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |228–9}}

=== Joint Austrian and German mission ===
As allies during the war, the Imperial German mission in the Ottoman Empire included both military and civilian components. Germany had brokered a deal with the [[Sublime Porte]] to commission the building of a railroad stretching from Berlin to the Middle East, called the [[Baghdad Railway]]. Germany's diplomatic mission at the beginning of 1915 was led by Ambassador Baron [[Hans Freiherr von Wangenheim]] (who was later succeeded by Count [[Paul Wolff Metternich]] following his death in 1915). Like Morgenthau, von Wangenheim began to receive many disturbing messages from consul officials around the Ottoman Empire detailing the massacre of Armenians. From the province of [[Adana]], Consul Eugene Buge reported that the CUP chief had sworn to kill and massacre any Armenians who survived the deportation marches.&lt;ref name = &quot;Balakian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |186}}  In June 1915, von Wangenheim sent a cable to Berlin reporting that Talat had admitted that the deportations were not &quot;being carried out because of 'military considerations alone.'&quot;  One month later, he came to the conclusion that there &quot;no longer was doubt that the Porte was trying to exterminate the Armenian race in the Turkish Empire.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Fromkin&quot; /&gt;{{rp |213}}

When Wolff-Metternich succeeded von Wangenheim, he continued to dispatch similar cables: &quot;The Committee [CUP] demands the extirpation of the last remnants of the Armenians and the government must yield…  A Committee representative is assigned to each of the provincial administrations…  [[Turkification]] means license to expel, to kill or destroy everything that is not Turkish.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Auswärtiges Amt'', West German Foreign Office Archives, K170, no. 4674, folio 63, in Balakian, ''The Burning Tigris'', p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Armenian Genocide (Collection of St. Lazar Mkhitarian Congregation).jpg|thumb|Turkish official teasing starved Armenian children by showing bread, 1915]]
Another notable figure in the German military camp was [[Max Erwin von Scheubner-Richter]], who documented various massacres of Armenians. He sent fifteen reports regarding &quot;deportations and mass killings&quot; to the German chancellery.  His final report noted that fewer than 100,000 Armenians were left alive in the Ottoman Empire: the rest having been exterminated ({{lang-de |ausgerottet}}).&lt;ref name = &quot;Fisk&quot; /&gt;{{rp |329–30}}  Scheubner-Richter also detailed the methods of the Ottoman government, noting its use of the Special Organization and other bureaucratized instruments of genocide.

The Germans also witnessed the way Armenians were burned according to Israeli historian, Bat Ye’or, who writes: &quot;The Germans, allies of the Turks in the First World War… saw how civil populations were shut up in churches and burned, or gathered en masse in camps, tortured to death, and reduced to ashes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;B. Ye'or, ''The Dhimmi. The Jews and Christians under Islam'', Trans. from the French by D. Maisel P. Fenton and D. Liftman, Cranbury, New Jersey: Frairleigh Dickinson University, 1985. p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; German officers stationed in eastern Turkey disputed the government's assertion that Armenian revolts had broken out, suggesting that the areas were &quot;quiet until the deportations began.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Fromkin&quot; /&gt;{{rp |212}}  Other Germans openly supported the Ottoman policy against the Armenians. As Hans Humann, the German naval attaché in Constantinople said to US Ambassador Henry Morgenthau:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have lived in Turkey the larger part of my life…  and I know the Armenians. I also know that both Armenians and Turks cannot live together in this country. One of these races has got to go. And I don't blame the Turks for what they are doing to the Armenians. I think that they are entirely justified. The weaker nation must succumb. The Armenians desire to dismember Turkey; they are against the Turks and the Germans in this war, and they therefore have no right to exist here.&lt;ref name = &quot;Morgenthau&quot; /&gt;{{rp |375}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a genocide conference held in 2001, professor Wolfgang Wipperman of the [[Free University of Berlin]] introduced documents evidencing that the German High Command was aware of the mass killings at the time but chose not to interfere or speak out.&lt;ref name = &quot;Fisk&quot; /&gt;{{rp |331}}

Photographs exist that may also suggest the Germans participated in the mass killing and some of the German witnesses to the Armenian holocaust would go on to play a role in the Nazi regime - [[Konstantin Freiherr von Neurath]], for example, was attached to the Turkish 4th Army in 1915 with instructions to monitor &quot;operations&quot; against the Armenians who later became Hitler's foreign minister and &quot;Protector of Bohemia and Moravia&quot; during Reinhard Heydrich's terror in Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref&gt; The Independent, 22 October 2012 [http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/photograph-links-germans-to-1915-armenia-genocide-8219537.html] &lt;/ref&gt;

==== Armin T. Wegner ====
{{See also|Armin T. Wegner}}

German military medic [[Armin T. Wegner]] enrolled as a medic at the outbreak of World War I during the winter of 1914–15. He defied censorship in taking hundreds of photographs&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.armenian-genocide.org/photo_wegner.html#photo_collection | last = Wegner | title = Photo collection | publisher = Armenian Genocide}}.&lt;/ref&gt; of Armenians being deported and subsequently starving in northern Syrian camps&lt;ref name = &quot;Fisk&quot; /&gt;{{rp |326}} and in the deserts of Der Zor. Wegner was part of a German detachment under von der Goltz stationed near the [[Baghdad Railway]] in [[Mesopotamia]]. Wegner was eventually arrested by the Germans and recalled to Germany.

Wegner protested against the atrocities perpetrated in an open letter submitted to US President [[Woodrow Wilson]] at the peace conference of 1919. The letter made a case for the creation of an independent Armenian state. Also in 1919, Wegner published ''The Road of No Return'' (&quot;Der Weg ohne Heimkehr&quot;), a collection of letters he had written during what he deemed the &quot;martyrdom&quot; (German: &quot;Martyrium&quot;) of the Armenians.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | language = German | place = DE | url = http://www.armin-t-wegner.de/biographie.htm | title = Wegner Biographie}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary film depicting Wegner's personal account of the Armenian Genocide through his own photographs called &quot;Destination Nowhere: The Witness&quot; and produced by Dr J Michael Hagopian premiered in Fresno on 25 April 2000. Prior to the release of the documentary he was honored at the Armenian Genocide Museum in Yerevan for championing the plight of Armenians throughout his life.

=== Russian military ===
The Russian Empire's response to the bombardment of its Black Sea naval ports was primarily a land campaign through the Caucasus. Early victories against the Ottoman Empire from the winter of 1914 to the spring 1915 saw significant gains of territory, including relieving the Armenian bastion resisting in the city of Van in May 1915. The Russians also reported encountering the bodies of unarmed civilian Armenians as they advanced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70A1FFC395C13738DDDAA0A94DA405B858DF1D3 Massacre By Turks In Caucasus Towns; Armenians Led Out Into the Streets and Shot or Drowned – Old Friends Not Spared.]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1916, the scenes they saw in the city of [[Erzerum]] led the Russians to retaliate against the Ottoman III Army whom they held responsible for the massacres, destroying it in its entirety.&lt;ref&gt;New York Times Dispatch.

''New York Times'', March 6, 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Swedish Embassy and Military Attaché ===
Sweden, as a neutral state during the entire World War I, had permanent representatives in the Ottoman Empire, able to continuously report on the ongoing events in the country. The Swedish Embassy in [[Constantinople]], represented by Ambassador Per Gustaf August Cosswa Anckarsvärd, along with Envoy M. Ahlgren, and the Swedish Military Attaché, Captain Einar af Wirsén, closely followed the development throughout the empire, reporting, among others, on the Armenian massacres. On July 7, 1915, Anckarsvärd dispatched a two-page report to [[Stockholm]], beginning with the following information:

{{quote |The persecutions of the Armenians have reached hair-raising proportions and all points to the fact that the Young Turks want to seize the opportunity, since due to different reasons there are no effective external pressure to be feared, to once and for all put an end to the Armenian question. The means for this are quite simple and consist of the extermination (utrotandet) of the Armenian nation.&lt;ref name = &quot;Avedian&quot;&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.armenica.org/material/master_thesis_vahagn_avedian.pdf | last = Avedian | first = Vahagn | title = The Armenian Genocide 1915: From a Neutral Small State's Perspective: Sweden | format = [[PDF]] | publisher = Uppsala University | year = 2008}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |39}}}}

During the remainder of 1915 alone, Anckarsvärd dispatched six other reports entitled &quot;The Persecutions of the Armenians&quot;. In his report on July 22, Anckarsvärd noted that the persecutions of the Armenians were being extended to encompass all Christians in the [[Ottoman Empire]]:

{{quote |[The deportations] can not be any other issue than an annihilation war against the Greek nation in Turkey and as measures hereof they have been implementing forced conversions to Islam, in obvious aim to, that if after the end of the war there again would be a question of European intervention for the protection of the Christians, there will be as few of them left as possible.&lt;ref name = &quot;Avedian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |40}}}}

On August 9, 1915, Anckarsvärd dispatched yet another report, confirming his suspicions regarding the plans of the Turkish government, &quot;It is obvious that the Turks are taking the opportunity to, now during the war, annihilate [utplåna] the Armenian nation so that when the peace comes no Armenian question longer exists.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Avedian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |41}}

When reflecting upon the situation in Turkey during the final stages of the war, Envoy Alhgren presented an analysis of the prevailing situation in Turkey and the hard times which had befallen the population. In explaining the increased living costs he identified a number of reasons: &quot;obstacles for domestic trade, the almost total paralysing of the foreign trade and finally the strong decreasing of labour power, caused partly by the mobilisation but partly also by the extermination of the Armenian race [utrotandet af den armeniska rasen].&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Avedian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |52}}

Wirsén, when writing his memoirs from his mission to the Balkans and Turkey, ''Minnen från fred och krig'' (&quot;Memories from Peace and War&quot;), dedicated an entire chapter to the Armenian genocide, entitled ''Mordet på en nation'' (&quot;The Murder of a Nation&quot;). Commenting on the interpretation that the deportations resulted from the purported  collaboration of the Armenians with the Russians, Wirsen concludes that their subsequent deportations were nothing but a cover for their extermination.: &quot;Officially, these had the goal to move the entire Armenian population to the steppe regions of Northern Mesopotamia and Syria, but in reality they aimed to exterminate [utrota] the Armenians, whereby the pure Turkish element in Asia Minor would achieve a dominating position.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Avedian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |28}}

In conclusion, Wirsén made the following note: &quot;The annihilation of the Armenian nation in Asia Minor must revolt all human feelings…  The way the Armenian problem was solved was hair-raising. I can still see in front of me Talaat's cynical expression, when he emphasized that the Armenian question was solved.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Avedian&quot; /&gt;{{rp |29}}

===Bodil Biørn===
{{See also|Bodil Katharine Biørn}}

In 1905 the missionary nurse Bodil Biørn (1871–1960) was sent to Armenia. First based in the town of Mezereh (now Elazig) and later in Mush, she worked for widows and orphaned children in cooperation with missionaries from the German Hülfsbund.  She witnessed the massacres of 1915 in Mush and saw most of the children in her care murdered along with Armenian priests, teachers, and assistants. She barely escaped after 9 days on horseback but stayed on in the region for another 2 years under increasingly difficult working conditions. After a period at home she again went to Armenia and, until she retired in 1935, worked for Armenian refugees in Syria and Lebanon. Bodil Biørn was also an able photographer.  Many of her photos are now in the WMF archive, which since the organisation was dissolved in 1982 has been preserved in the National Archives of Norway.  In combination with her comments, written in her photo albums or on the back of the prints themselves, these photos bear strong witness of the atrocities that she saw.&lt;ref name=NorwegianStateArchive&gt;{{citation | publisher = Norwegian State Archive | url = http://www.arkivverket.no/webfelles/armenia/english.html | title = Armenia}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman reactions===
According to Celal Bey, the former governor of Halep Province, a deputy of Konya, explained him the situation and said:

{{quote |Blood flowing instead of water in the river, and thousands of innocent children, blameless elderly, helpless women and strong youths were flowing towards death in this blood flow.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Halep Valisi Celal'in Anılar&quot;, ''Vakit'', December 12, 1918, Turkish text: ''Nehirde su yerine kan akıyor ve binlerce masum çocuk, kabahatsız ihtiyar, aciz kadınlar, kuvvetli gençler bu kan cereyanı içinde ademe doğru akıp gidiyorlardı.''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Halil Kut|Halil Paşa (Kut)]], uncle of [[Enver Paşa]] wrote &quot;Armenian nations whom I tried to annihilate to the last member of them, because of trying erase us from history as prisoners of the enemy in the most horrible and painful days of my homeland…&quot; in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;Halil Paşa (transcribed by Taylan Sorgun), ''İttihat ve Terakki'den Cumhuriyet'e Bitmeyen Savaş'', Kamer, İstanbul, 1997, pp. 240–41, Turkish text: ''Vatanımın en korkunç ve acı günlerinde vatanımı düşmana esir olarak tarihten silmeye kalktıkları için Ermeni milleti…''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, Ahmet Refik wrote &quot;the [[Committee of Union and Progress|Unionists]] (Committee of Union and Progress) wanted to remove the problem of [[Vilâyât-ı Sitte]] with annihilating Armenians&quot; in his work entitled ''İki Komite İki Kıtal''.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmet Refik (transcripion: Hamide Koyukan), ''Kafkas Yolunda İki Komite İki Kıtal'', Kebikeç Yayınları, Ankara, 1994, ISBN 975-7981-00-1, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a secret session of the National Assembly, held on October 17, 1920, [[Hasan Fehmi Kolay|Hasan Fehmi Bey (Kolay)]], deputy of Bursa at the time, said:

{{quote |As you know, the issue of relocation was an event that made world to yell blue and made all of us to be considered as murderer. We knew, before we done it, the Christian world won't tolerate it and they would direct anger and hatred toward us.  Why did we impute the title of murderer to our race?  Why did we enter into such decisive and difficult struggle?  That was done just for securing the future of our country that we know as more precious and sacred than our lives.&lt;ref&gt;''Türkiye Büyük Millet Meclisi Gizli Celse Zabıtları'', Vol. I, Türkiye İş Bankası Kültür Yayınları, Ankara, 1985, p. 177, Turkish text: ''Tehcir meselesi, biliyorsunuz ki dünyayı velveleye veren ve hepimizi katil telâkki ettiren bir vaka idi. Bu yapılmazdan evvel âlem-i nasraniyetin bunu hazmetmeyeceği ve bunun için bütün gayz ve kinini bize tevcih edeceklerini biliyorduk. Neden katillik ünvanını nefsimize izafe ettik? Neden o kadar azim, müşkül bir dava içine girdik? Sırf canımızdan daha aziz ve daha mukaddes bildiğimiz vatanımızın istikbalini taht-ı emniyete almak için yapılmış şeylerdir.''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Persia===
Throughout history, the nation of [[Persia]] (now known as [[Iran]]) has usually regarded itself as the protector of Armenian nation whom they considered as fellows due to their both belonging to the [[Aryan race]].{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}  However, in this case, due to the weak central government in Tehran's inability to protect its territorial integrity, no resistance was offered by the mostly Islamic Persian troops when, after the withdrawal of Russian troops from the extreme northwest of Persia, Islamic Turks invaded the town of Salmas in northwestern Persia and tortured and massacred the Christian Armenian inhabitants in the cruelest possible manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cilicia.com/armo10c-mr191507a.html &quot;The Jihad Rampant in Persia&quot; by Rev. Robert M. Labree--reporting from Tabriz, Persia July 1915:]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Study of the Armenian Genocide ==
The Armenian Genocide is widely corroborated by the international genocide scholars. The [[International Association of Genocide Scholars]] (IAGS), consisting of world's foremost experts on genocide,{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} unanimously passed a formal resolution affirming the fact of the Armenian Genocide. According to IAGS, &quot;Every book on comparative genocide studies in the English language contains a segment on the Armenian Genocide. Leading texts in the international law of genocide such as [[William Schabas]]'s 'Genocide in International Law' cite the Armenian Genocide as presursor to the Holocaust and as a precedent for the law on crimes against humanity. Polish Jurist Raphael Lemkin, when he coined the term [[genocide]] in 1944, cited the Turkish extermination of the Armenians and the Nazi extermination of the Jews as defining examples of what he meant by genocide. The killings of Armenians is genocide as defined by the 1948 United Nations Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. 126 leading scholars of the holocaust including [[Elie Wiesel]], and [[Yehuda Bauer]] placed a statement in the ''New York Times'' in June 2000 declaring the &quot;inconstestable fact of the Armenian genocide&quot; and urging western democracies to acknowledge it. &quot;The [[Institute on the Holocaust and Genocide]] (Jerusalem), and the Institute for the Study of Genocide (NYC), have affirmed the historical fact of the Armenian Genocide.&quot;&lt;ref name=IAGS&gt;IAGS open letter (page2) http://www.voelkermord.at/docs/Scholars_Denying_IAGS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  

British historian Arnold J. Toynbee, whose 1917 report remains a critical primary source, changed his evaluation later in life, concluding, &quot;These…Armenian political aspirations had not been legitimate....Their aspirations did not merely threaten to break up the Turkish Empire; they could not be fulfilled without doing grave injustice to the Turkish people itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Gunter, ''Pursuing the Just Cause'' (1986) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

For Turkish historians, supporting the national republican myth is essential to preserving Turkish national unity. The usual Turkish argument is that the deportations were necessary because the Armenians had allied themselves with the Russian army in wartime and that around 600,000 Armenians perished during the marches, largely due to isolated massacres, disease, or malnourishment.&lt;ref&gt;Papazian, Dennis. [http://www.umd.umich.edu/dept/armenian/facts/answers.html Useful Answers to Frequent Questions on the Armenian Genocide].&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;There was no genocide committed against the Armenians in the Ottoman Empire before or during World War I.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Statements by the Assembly of Turkish American Associations, 1982, quoted in Gunter (1986) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Genocide scholars [[Roger Smith]], [[Eric Markusen]], and [[Robert Jay Lifton]] wrote in ''Professional Ethics and the Denial of the Armenian Genocide'' (Holocaust and Genocide Studies): &quot;Where scholars deny genocide in the face of decisive evidence ... they contribute to false consciousness that can have the most dire reverbrations. Their message, in effect, is ... mass murder requires no confrontation, no reflection, but should be ignored, glossed over.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith1995&quot;/&gt; Some dissident historians and scholars in Turkey, including [[Yektan Turkyilmaz|Yektan Türkyilmaz]], have been trying to reclaim the Armenians as part of Ottoman and Turkish history and acknowledge the wrongs done to the Armenians as a condition for reconciliation with them on the basis of confidence in Turkish national unity.&lt;ref&gt;Lucette Valensi, &quot;Notes on Two Discordant Histories: Armenia During World War I.&quot; ''Mediterranean Historical Review'' 2001 16(1): 49–60. Issn: 0951-8967; James Reid, &quot;The Armenian Massacres in Ottoman and Turkish Historiography.&quot; ''Armenian Review'' 1984 37(1): 22–40. Issn: 0004-2366&lt;/ref&gt;

==Defining ''genocide''==
[[Hebrew University]] scholar [[Yehuda Bauer]] suggests of the Armenian Genocide, &quot;This is the closest parallel to the [[Holocaust]].&quot;&lt;ref name=bauer_holocaust&gt;{{citation | first = Yehuda | last = Bauer | contribution = The Place of the Holocaust in Contemporary History | title = Holocaust: Religious &amp; Philosophical Implications}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He nonetheless distinguishes several key differences between the Holocaust and the Armenian Genocide, particularly in regard to motivation:

{{quote |[T]he Nazis saw the Jews as ''the'' central problem of world history. Upon its solution depended the future of mankind.  Unless International Jewry was defeated, human civilization would not survive. The attitude towards the Jews had in it important elements of pseudo-religion. There was no such motivation present in the Armenian case; Armenians were to be annihilated for power-political reasons, and in Turkey only… The differences between the holocaust and the Armenian massacres are less important than the similarities—and even if the Armenian case is not seen as a holocaust in the extreme form which it took towards Jews, it is certainly the nearest thing to it.&lt;ref name=bauer_holocaust/&gt;}}

Bauer has also suggested that the Armenian Genocide is best understood, not as having begun in 1915, but rather as &quot;an ongoing genocide, from 1896, through 1908/9, through World War I and right up to 1923.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ongoing&quot;&gt;{{citation | last = Bauer | first = Yehuda | url = http://www.armeniaforeignministry.com/conference/yahuda_bauer.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | title = Can Genocides be Prevented? | publisher = Armenia Foreign Ministry}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucy Dawidowicz]] also alludes to these earlier massacres as at least as significant as World War I era events:

{{quote |In 1897, when the [[Dreyfus Affair]] was tearing France apart, [[Bernard Lazare]], a French Jew active in Dreyfus's defense, addressed a group of Jewish students in Paris on the subject of anti-Semitism.  &quot;For the Christian peoples&quot;, he remarked, &quot;an Armenian solution&quot; to their Jew-hatred was available. He was referring to the Turkish massacres of Armenians, which in their extent and horror most closely approximated the murder of European Jews. But, Lazare went on, &quot;their sensibilities cannot allow them to envisage that.&quot;  The once unthinkable &quot;Armenian solution&quot; became, in our time, the achievable &quot;Final Solution&quot;, the Nazi code name for the annihilation of the European Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last= Dawidowicz | first =Lucy S |authorlink=Lucy Dawidowicz |title=The Holocaust and the Historians |year=1981 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=0-674-40566-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- which page of which edition? the 1982/1983 ISBN 0-674-40567-6 of 204 pages or the 1981 hardcover 0-674-40566-8 of 187–200 pages? --&gt;}}

Law professor [[Raphael Lemkin]], who coined the term &quot;genocide&quot; in 1943, has stated that he did so with the fate of the Armenians in mind, explaining that &quot;it happened so many times… First to the Armenians, then after the Armenians, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] took action.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last =Stanley |first =Alessandra |title =A PBS Documentary Makes Its Case for the Armenian Genocide, With or Without a Debate |work =New York Times |date= 2006-04-17 |url =http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/17/arts/television/17stan.html |accessdate =2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several international organizations have conducted studies of the events, each in turn determining that the term &quot;genocide&quot; aptly describes &quot;the Ottoman massacre of Armenians in 1915–16.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ictj&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last = |first = |authorlink = |coauthors = |title =Turkey Recalls Envoys Over Armenian Genocide |work = |publisher =International Center for Transitional Justice |date= 2006-05-08 |url =http://www.ictj.org/en/news/coverage/article/935.html |doi = |accessdate =2007-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among the organizations affirming this conclusion are the [[International Center for Transitional Justice]], the [[International Association of Genocide Scholars]], and the United Nations' [[Sub-Commission on Prevention of Discrimination and Protection of Minorities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ictj&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name= armeniapediaictj&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.armeniapedia.org/index.php?title=International_Center_for_Transitional_Justice | publisher = Armeniapedia | title = International Center for Transitional Justice}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  One public figure who objected to the use of the term &quot;genocide&quot; was Israeli Foreign Minister [[Shimon Peres]], who was subsequently rebutted by Dr Israel Charny, executive director of the [[Institute on the Holocaust and Genocide]] in Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = The Independent | place = UK | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/peres-stands-accused-over-denial-of-meaningless-armenian-holocaust-681774.html | title = Peres stands accused over denial of &quot;meaningless&quot; Armenian Holocaust}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the [[International Center for Transitional Justice]] (ICTJ) was asked by the Turkish Armenian Reconciliation Commission to provide a report on the applicability of the Genocide Convention to the controversy.  An independent legal counsel drafted  memorandum for the ICTJ stated that in the opinion of the independent legal counsel &quot;legal scholars as well as historians, politicians, journalists and other people would be justified in continuing to so describe [the events as genocide]&quot;&lt;ref name = ICTJ-memorandum&gt;{{citation | publisher = ICTJ | format = [[PDF]] | url = http://www.ictj.org/images/content/7/5/759.pdf | title = The Applicability of the United Nations Convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide to the events which occurred during the early twentieth century | note = The memorandum was drafted by independent legal counsel and not by the ICTJ.

&lt;/ref&gt; and further that the Republic of Turkey was not liable for the event.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

While some consider denial to be a form of [[hate speech]] or politically minded [[historical revisionism (political)|historical revisionism]], several western academics have expressed doubts as to the genocidal character of the events.&lt;ref&gt;Gilles Veinstein, &quot;Trois questions sur un massacre&quot;, L’Histoire, no. 187 (April 1995), pp. 40–1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salt, Jeremy. &quot;The Narrative Gap in Ottoman Armenian History, Middle Eastern Studies, Vol 39, No 1, January 2003 pp. 19–36.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erickons, E.J., 2006.

Summer 2006, Vol. 13, No. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The most important counterpoint may be that of British scholar [[Bernard Lewis]].

Academic views within the Republic of Turkey are often at odds with international consensus: this may partly stem from the fact that to acknowledge the Armenian genocide in Turkey carries with it a risk of criminal prosecution. Many Turkish intellectuals have been prosecuted for characterizing the massacres as genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nouritza Matossian |title=They say 'incident'.

[[Bat Ye'or]] has suggested that &quot;the genocide of the Armenians was a [[jihad]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | date = 2007-8 | url = http://www.americanthinker.com/2007/08/congress_must_recognize_the_ar_1.html | publisher =  American Thinker | title = Congress Must Recognize the Armenian Genocide}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ye'or holds jihad and what she calls &quot;[[dhimmitude]]&quot; to be among the &quot;principles and values&quot; that led to the Armenian Genocide.&lt;ref&gt;Ye'or, Bat.

[[Noam Chomsky]] has suggested that, rather than the Armenian Genocide having been relegated to the periphery of public awareness, &quot;more people are aware of the Armenian genocide during the First World War than are aware of the [[Indonesian killings of 1965–66|Indonesian genocide]] in 1965&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, Noam.

On October 10, 2009 in Zurich, despite overwhelming opposition by Armenians in Armenia and in the Diaspora, the Armenian government signed the Armenia-Turkey Protocols, one of the provisions of which stipulates the establishment of a research commission &quot;to study the two country's historical grievances.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;October 2009&quot;&gt;[http://www.france24.com/en/20091011-opposition-parties-express-concern-signed-accords-turkey-armenia &quot;Turkey's Opposition parties express concern over reconciliation accords&quot;].

According to Kemal Çiçek, the head of the Armenian Research Group at the [[Turkish Historical Society]], in Turkey there is no official thesis on the Armenian issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttk.org.tr/index.php?Page=Basinda&amp;HaberNo=446 Turkish Historical Society],  ''In Turkey, There is no official thesis on the Armenian issue.

Keşke resmi tez olsaydı, şu anda herkes o tezi bilirdi).'' {{Tr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]]'s formal stance is that the deaths of [[Armenians]] during the &quot;relocation&quot; or &quot;[[deportation]]&quot; cannot aptly be deemed &quot;genocide&quot;, a position that has been supported with a plethora of diverging justifications:  that the killings were not deliberate or were not governmentally orchestrated, that the killings were justified because Armenians posed a Russian-sympathizing threat&lt;ref&gt;The Armenian Review&amp;nbsp;— p. 92, He invoked the &quot;Armenian revolt of Van.&quot;91 He also invoked Armenian-Russian collaboration, as well as Armenian cruelties against Turks.&lt;/ref&gt; as a cultural group, that Armenians merely starved, or any of various characterizations recalling marauding &quot;Armenian gangs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkses.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=521&amp;Itemid=33 TURKSES Voice of Turks – The So-Called Armenian Genocide&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ataa.org/reference/question_tashan.html Assembly of Turkish American Associations&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anarmenianmyth.com/massacred_turks.htm An Armenian Myth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; Some suggestions seek to invalidate the genocide on semantic or anachronistic grounds (the word &quot;[[genocide]]&quot; was not coined until 1943). Turkish World War I casualty figures are often cited to mitigate the effect of the number of Armenian dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turkishembassy.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=64&amp;Itemid=257 Turkish Embassy.org – Republic of Turkey&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the retired ambassador of Turkey to Germany and Spain; Volkan Vural, the Turkish state should apologize for what happened to the Armenians during the deportations of 1915 and what happened to the Greeks during [[Istanbul Pogrom]]&lt;ref name=VolkanVuralinterview&gt;&quot;Devlet Ermenilerden özür dilemeli I-II&quot;, http://www.hyetert.com/yazi3.asp?Id=341&amp;DilId=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=aghetinterview&gt;&quot;Interview with Volkan Vural&quot;,http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JYP2i8vF7C8&amp;t=7m46s&lt;/ref&gt; He also states that, &quot;I think that, the Armenian issue can be solved by politicians and not by historians. I don't believe that historical facts about this issue is not revealed. The historical facts are already known. The most important point here is that how this facts will be interpreted and will affect the future.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;VolkanVuralinterview&quot;/&gt;

Turkish governmental sources have asserted that the historically demonstrated &quot;tolerance of Turkish people&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TurkishGeneralStaff&quot;&gt;[http://www.tsk.mil.tr//eng/uluslararasi/armenianissue.htm Turkish General Staff&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; itself renders the Armenian Genocide an impossibility. One military document leverages 11th century history to cast doubt on the Armenian Genocide: &quot;It was the [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuq Turks]] who saved the Armenians that came under the [[Battle of Manzikert|Turkish domination in 1071]] from the [[Byzantium|Byzantine]] persecution and granted them the right to live as a man should.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TurkishGeneralStaff&quot; /&gt; A ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' article addressed this modern Turkish conception of history thus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Would you admit to the crimes of your grandfathers, if these crimes didn't really happen?&quot; asked ambassador Öymen. But the problem lies precisely in this question, says [[Hrant Dink]], publisher and editor-in-chief of the Istanbul-based Armenian weekly ''[[Agos]]''. Turkey's bureaucratic elite have never really shed themselves of the Ottoman tradition&amp;nbsp;— in the perpetrators, they see their fathers, whose honor they seek to defend. This tradition instills a sense of identity in Turkish nationalists&amp;nbsp;— both from the left and the right, and it is passed on from generation to generation through the school system. This tradition also requires an antipole against which it could define itself. Since the times of the Ottoman Empire, religious minorities have been pushed into this role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,353274,00.html Turkey's Memory Lapse: Armenian Genocide Plagues Ankara 90 Years On – International – SPIEGEL ONLINE – News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2007, [[Turkish Prime Minister]] [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] issued a circular that calls the government institutions to use &quot;1915 Events&quot; (in Turkish, 1915 Olayları) phrase instead of the &quot;so-called Armenian genocide&quot; (in Turkish, sözde Ermeni soykırımı) phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://arsiv.sabah.com.tr/2007/07/28/haber,C7B8DF9C11C040F785183D0B06FDE27C.html |accessdate=2008-09-03 |title=1915 yılı olayları |date=2007-07-27 |work=[[Sabah (newspaper)|Sabah]] |language=Turkish |quote=Erdoğan, eylülde ABD Kongresi'nin gündemine gelmesi beklenen soykırım iddialarına ilişkin genelgesinde, kamu kurumlarının, '1915 yılı olayları', '1915 yılı olayları ile ilgili Ermeni iddiaları veya varsayımları' ifadelerini kullanmalarını istedi.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Turkish government continues to protest against the formal recognition of the genocide by other countries and to dispute that there ever was a genocide.

===Controversies===
Efforts by the Turkish government and its agents to quash mention of the genocide have resulted in numerous scholarly, diplomatic, political and legal controversies. Prosecutors acting on their own initiative have utilized [[Article 301 (Turkish penal code)|Article 301]] of the Turkish Penal Code prohibiting &quot;insulting Turkishness&quot; to silence a number of prominent Turkish intellectuals who spoke of atrocities suffered by Armenians in the last days of the Ottoman Empire (as of yet, most of these cases have been dismissed).&lt;ref&gt;Corley, Felix. &quot;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20020214/ai_n12598598 Obituary: Ayse Nur Zarakolu]&quot;, ''[[The Independent|Independent]]'', February 14, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;  These prosecutions have often been accompanied by hate campaigns and threats, as was the case for [[Hrant Dink]], who was prosecuted three times for &quot;[[Article 301 (Turkish penal code)|denigrating Turkishness]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = |first = |authorlink = |coauthors = | title =IPI Deplores Callous Murder of Journalist in Istanbul |work = |publisher =International Press Institute |date = 2007-01-22 |url =http://www.freemedia.at/cms/ipi/statements_detail.html?ctxid=CH0055&amp;docid=CMS1169459655335 |doi = | accessdate = 2007-09-16| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070926235019/http://www.freemedia.at/cms/ipi/statements_detail.html?ctxid=CH0055&amp;docid=CMS1169459655335| archivedate= 26 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; and murdered in 2007.

In 1982, the [[Israel]]i Foreign Ministry attempted to prevent an international conference on genocide, held in [[Tel Aviv]], from including any mention of the Armenian Genocide. Several reports suggested that Turkey had warned that [[Turkish Jews]] might face &quot;reprisals&quot;, if the conference permitted Armenian participation.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70C1EFD355C0C778CDDAF0894DA484D81&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=jews+armenian+genocide+reprisals&amp;st=nyt Genocide Parley with Armenians to Proceed]&quot;, ''[[New York Times]]'', June 4, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; This charge was &quot;categorically denied&quot; by Turkey;&lt;ref&gt;Howe, Marvine. &quot;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50610F8355C0C768CDDAF0894DA484D81&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=jews+armenian+genocide&amp;st=nyt Turkey Denies it Threatened Jews Over Parley on Genocide]&quot;, ''[[New York Times]]'', June 5, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; the Israeli Foreign Ministry supported Turkey in this protestation that there had been no threats against Jews, suggesting that its misgivings as to the genocide conference were based on considerations &quot;vital to the Jewish nation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E3DB173BF935A25755C0A964948260&amp;scp=6&amp;sq=jews+armenian+genocide&amp;st=nyt Armenians to Take Part In Tel Aviv Seminar]&quot;, ''[[New York Times]]'', June 16, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year (1982), the [[Institute of Turkish Studies]] in Washington, D.C. (ITS) was established by a $3 million grant from the Turkish Government. Israel Charny identifies ITS and some of its foremost deniers of the Armenian genocide, such as [[Stanford J. Shaw|Stanford Shaw]], [[Heath W.

A 1989 U.S. Senate proposal to recognize the Armenian Genocide stoked the ire of Turkey. The proposal occurred in the context of the publication of internal U.S. documents which laid out a State Department official's eyewitness report that &quot;thousands and thousands of Armenians, mostly innocent and helpless women and children, were butchered&quot;, in the last days of the Ottoman Empire.  Turkey responded by blocking [[United States Navy]] visits to Turkey and suspending some US military training facilities on Turkish territory.

In 1990, psychologist [[Robert Jay Lifton]] received a letter from the Turkish Ambassador to the United States, questioning his inclusion of references to the Armenian Genocide in one of his books.

In 1993, [[Ragıp Zarakolu]] a Turkish human rights activist published the Turkish translation of the book called ''History of the Genocide'' written by [[Yves Ternon]]. The book was the first to be published in Turkey that openly acknowledged the event in 1915 as [[Genocide]]. Soon after its  publication, he started to receive threats and eventually in 1994 the publishing firm of Ragıp Zorakolu was the target of a serious bomb attack.&lt;ref name=meseledergi&gt;&quot;Ragıp Zarakolu: Hümanist Ekol, Benim Suç Ortağımdır&quot;http://www.meseledergi.com/?p=192&lt;/ref&gt;

During a February 2005 interview with ''[[Das Magazin]]'', novelist [[Orhan Pamuk]] made statements implicating Turkey in massacres against Armenians and persecution of the Kurds, declaring: &quot;Thirty thousand Kurds and a million Armenians were killed in these lands and nobody but me dares to talk about it&quot;.  Subjected to a [[hate speech|hate campaign]], he left Turkey, before returning in 2005 to defend his right to [[freedom of speech]]: &quot;What happened to the Ottoman Armenians in 1915 was a major thing that was hidden from the Turkish nation; it was a taboo. But we have to be able to talk about the past&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4527318.stm | publisher = BBC | title = News — &quot;Author's trial set to test Turkey&quot; | date = 14 December 2005 | first=Sarah | last=Rainsford}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, when asked about his speech on CNN TURK television, Pamuk stated that &quot;I did not estimate the number of killed Armenians, I did not use the word genocide, I did say Armenians were killed, but I did not say Armenians were killed by Turks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haberpan.com/gergin-bir-mulakatti-kiskirtildim-haberi/ |title = Gergin Bir Mülakatti, Kişkirtildim Haberi Gergin Bir Mülakatti, Kişkirtildim Izle Gergin Bir Mülakatti, Kişkirtildim Resimleri |publisher=Haberpan |language=Turkish|date=2005-10-16 | accessdate = 2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers of two Turkish ultranationalist professional associations led by Kemal Kerinçsiz then brought criminal charges against Pamuk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Nouritza Matossian |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1426319,00.html |title = World view: Nouritza Matossiann &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124 | work=The Observer | date= March 1, 2005|accessdate= 2010-09-04 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, on January 23, 2006 the charges of &quot;insulting Turkishness&quot; were dropped (for formal reasons without finding it necessary to judge on the essence of the case), a move welcomed by the EU. That the charges had been brought at all was still a matter of contention for European politicians.

According to some newly discovered documents that belonged to the interior minister of the Ottoman Empire, more than 970,000 Ottoman Armenians disappeared from official population records from 1915 through 1916. These documents have been published in a recent book titled ''The Remaining Documents of Talat Pasha'' (aka &quot;Talat Pasha's Black Book&quot;) written by the Turkish journalist [[Murat Bardakçı]]. The book is a collection of documents and records that once belonged to Mehmed Talat, known as Talat Pasha, the primary architect of the Armenian deportations. The documents were given to Mr. Bardakçı by Mr Talat's widow, Hayriye Talat Bafralı, in 1983. According to the documents, the number of Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire before 1915 stood at 1,256,000. The number plunged to 284,157 two years later in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;Tavernise, Sabrina &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/09/world/europe/09turkey.html?em Nearly a Million Genocide Victims, Covered in a Cloak of Amnesia].&quot; ''[[New York Times]]'', March 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the meeting with UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown, Turkey's PM announced that the Turkish Government might order the expulsion of all illegal Armenian immigrants from Turkey. The statement came after recent US House Committee and Swedish Parliament resolutions over the Armenian Genocide affirmation. He repeated the statement in a BBC interview immediately afterwards, declaring that there were 100,000 illegal Armenian citizens living in Turkey and that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If necessary, I may have to tell these 100,000 to go back to their country because they are not my citizens. I don't have to keep them in my country.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8572934.stm BBC – Turkey threatens to expel 100,000 Armenians].&quot; ''[[BBC News]]''.

March 17, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The answer to Erdoğan came from the Armenian Prime Minister; he said that this kind of threat reminded Armenians of the Armenian Genocide and neither did they improve relations between the two countries. The exact number of illegal Armenians in Turkey is unknown, but the estimation is only 12,000 – 13,000 &lt;ref name=&quot;UNHCR-100,000&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/4bab90fb28.html |title= UNHCR – Turkey threatens to expel Armenian immigrants amid genocide row}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrary to number used by the Turkish prime minister.

== Armenia and the Genocide ==
{{See also|Nagorno-Karabakh War|Sumgait pogrom}}
[[Armenia]] has been involved in a protracted ethnic-territorial conflict with [[Azerbaijan]], a [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] state, since Azerbaijan became independent from the Soviet Union in 1991. The conflict has featured several pogroms, massacres, and waves of [[ethnic cleansing]], by both sides. Some foreign policy observers and historians have suggested that Armenia and the Armenian diaspora have sought to portray the modern conflict as a continuation of the Armenian Genocide, in order to influence modern policy-making in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloxham&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=ambrosio12&gt;Ambrosio, Thomas. ''Ethnic Identity Groups and U.S. Foreign Policy''. 2002, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp |232–3}}  According to [[Thomas Ambrosio]], the Armenian Genocide furnishes &quot;a reserve of public sympathy and moral legitimacy that translates into significant political influence… to elicit congressional support for anti-Azerbaijan policies.&quot;&lt;ref name=ambrosio12 /&gt;

The rhetoric leading up to the onset of the conflict, which unfolded in the context of several pogroms of Armenians, was dominated by references to the Armenian Genocide, including fears that it would be, or was in the course of being, repeated.&lt;ref&gt;Atabaki, Touraj and Mehendale, Sanjyot. ''Central Asia and the Caucasus: Transnationalism and Diaspora''. 2005, pp. 85–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman, Stuart J. ''Modern Hatreds: The Symbolic Politics of Ethnic War''. New York: Cornell University Press, 2001, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; During the conflict, the Azeri and Armenian governments regularly accused each other of genocidal intent, although these claims have been treated skeptically by outside observers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bloxham&quot; /&gt;{{rp |232–3}}

The worldwide recognition of the Genocide is a core aspect of Armenia's foreign policy and overarching grand strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = Global Politician | url = http://www.globalpolitician.com/2661-armenia-turkey | title = Armenia–Turkey}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a response to the continuing denial of the Armenian Genocide by the Turkish State, many activists among [[Armenian Diaspora]] communities have pushed for formal recognition of the Armenian genocide from various governments around the world. 20 countries and 42&amp;nbsp;[[U.S. state]]s have adopted resolutions acknowledging the Armenian Genocide as a ''bona fide'' historical event. On March 4, 2010, a US congressional panel narrowly voted that the incident was indeed genocide; within minutes the Turkish government issued a statement critical of &quot;this resolution which accuses the Turkish nation of a crime it has not committed.&quot; The [[Armenian Assembly of America]] (AAA) and the single largest organisation with the AAA the [[Armenian National Committee of America]] (ANCA) have as their main lobbying agenda to press Congress and the President of the United States for an increase of economic aid for Armenia (already the second largest per capita after Israel) and the reduction economic and military assistance for Turkey. The efforts also include reaffirmation of a genocide by Ottoman Turkey in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;Cameron, Fraser ''United States foreign policy after the Cold War'' The Armenain-American´lobby, Routledge 2002 pp.91&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite his previous public recognition and support of Genocide bills, as well as the election campaign promises to formally recognize the Armenian Genocide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Barack Obama on the Importance of US-Armenia Relations|url= http://www.barackobama.com/2008/01/19/barack_obama_on_the_importance.php|accessdate=2010-04-26| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100424170850/http://www.barackobama.com/2008/01/19/barack_obama_on_the_importance.php| archivedate= 24 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  the U.S. President, Barack Obama, although repeating that his views on the issue have not changed, has thus far abstained from using the term 'genocide'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Barack Obama Campaign Promise No. 511|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/promise/511/recognize-armenian-genocide|accessdate=2010-04-26| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100506080622/http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/promise/511/recognize-armenian-genocide| archivedate= 6 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 24 commemoration speeches President Obama has yet referred to the Armenian Genocide only by the Armenian synonym Metz Eghern (&quot;Mec Eġeṙn&quot;).

== Cultural loss ==
The premeditated destruction of objects of Armenian cultural, religious, historical and communal heritage was yet another key purpose of both the genocide itself and the post-genocidal campaign of denial. Armenian churches and monasteries were destroyed or changed into mosques, Armenian cemeteries flattened, and, in several cities (e.g. Van), Armenian quarters were demolished.&lt;ref&gt;Bevan, Robert. The Destruction of Memory: Architecture at War. Reaktion Books, 2007, pp. 52–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the deaths, Armenians lost their wealth and property without compensation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Century of Genocide&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Totten | first1 = Samuel | last2 = Parsons | first2 = William S. | title = A Century of Genocide: Critical Essays and Eyewitness Accounts | publisher = Routledge |year= 2009 | location = New York | page = 58 | isbn=0-203-89043-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses and farms were lost, and all schools, churches, hospitals, orphanages, monasteries, and graveyards became Turkish state property.&lt;ref name=&quot;Century of Genocide&quot;/&gt; In January 1916, the Ottoman Minister of Commerce and Agriculture issued a decree ordering all financial institutions operating within the empire's borders to turn over Armenian assets to the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Business Wire&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Armenian Genocide Descendants File Class Action against Deutsche Bank and Dresdner Bank Announces Kabateck Brown Kellner LLP | publisher = Business Wire | date = May 6, 2010 | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2006_Jan_13/ai_n26726211/ | accessdate = May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is recorded that as much as 6 million Turkish gold pounds were seized along with real property, cash, bank deposits, and jewelry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Business Wire&quot;/&gt; The assets were then funneled to European banks, including [[Deutsche Bank|Deutsche]] and [[Dresdner Bank|Dresdner]] banks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Business Wire&quot;/&gt;

After the end of World War I, Genocide survivors tried to return and reclaim their former homes and assets, but were driven out by the [[Ankara Government]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Century of Genocide&quot;/&gt;

In 1914, the Armenian Patriarch in Constantinople presented a list of the Armenian holy sites under his supervision. The list contained 2,549 religious places of which 200 were monasteries while 1,600 were churches. In 1974 UNESCO stated that after 1923, out of 913 Armenian historical monuments left in Eastern Turkey, 464 have vanished completely, 252 are in ruins, and 197 are in need of repair (in stable conditions).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.genocide-museum.am/eng/cultural_genocide.php Cultural Genocide] in The Armenian Genocide Museum-Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/1861892055.html Bevan, Robert, The Destruction of Memory: Architecture at War, Chicago, 2006].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Armenian Genocide reparations ==

{{Main|Armenian Genocide reparations}}

Referring to the restitution for the damage caused to the Armenian nation due to the Genocide it can be stated that those could be of financial, estate or territorial nature alike, and may be claimed individually or collectively as well as by the State.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===The grounds of the International Law===

The United Nations Basic Principles and Guidelines on the Right to Reparation for Victims of Gross Violations of Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law provide in part, that reparation may be claimed individually and where appropriate collectively, by the direct victims of violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, the immediate family, dependants or other persons or groups of persons closely connected with the direct victims.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNHCR&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.unhchr.ch/Huridocda/Huridoca.nsf/TestFrame/b3111e1e8f4a9278c125660f004e5fcf?Opendocument QUESTION OF THE HUMAN RIGHTS OF ALL PERSONS SUBJECTED TO ANY FORM OF DETENTION OR IMPRISONMENT].&quot; United Nations Commission on Human Rights.&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Henry Theriault, while current members of Turkish society cannot be blamed morally for the destruction of Armenians, present-day [[Republic of Turkey]], as [[successor state]] to the Ottoman Empire and as beneficiary of the wealth and land expropriations brought forth through the genocide, is responsible for reparations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Theriault&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Theriault | first = Henry | title = The Global Reparations Movement and Meaningful Resolution of the Armenian Genocide | publisher = Armenian Weekly | date = May 6, 2010 | url = http://www.armenianweekly.com/2010/05/06/reparations-2/ | accessdate = May 11, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100510063921/http://www.armenianweekly.com/2010/05/06/reparations-2/| archivedate= 10 May 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Particularly important are Principles 9 and 12 that state, that civil claims relating to reparations for gross violations of human rights and international humanitarian law shall not be subject to statutes of limitations (article 9), and that restitution shall be provided to re-establish the situation that existed prior to the violations of human rights or international humanitarian law. The restitution requires, ''inter alia'' – return to one's place of residence and restoration of property.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNHCR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commission on Human Rights, fifty-third session, Doc. E/CN.4/1997/104. Compare with the first report by Professor Theo van Boven C/CH.4/Sub.2/1993/8 of 2 July 1993, section IX, and the second report C/CN.4/Sub.2/1996/7 of 24 May 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of International Law of [[Geneva School of Diplomacy]] (J.D. – Harvard, Dr.phil. – Göttingen), former Secretary of the [[UN Human Rights Committee]] and former Chief of Petitions at the Office of the [[UN High Commissioner for Human Rights]], Dr. Alfred de Zayas stated, that because of the continuing character of the crime of genocide in factual and legal terms, the remedy of restitution has not been foreclosed. Thus the survivors of the genocide against the Armenians, both individually and collectively, have standing to advance a claim for restitution. Whenever possible complete restitution or restoration to the previous condition should be granted. But where is not possible, relevant compensation may be substituted as a remedy.

In an article published in [[European Journal of International Law]], Vahagn Avedian, rather leaving the limitations of the UN Genocide Convention, emphasizes the applicability of the then and now prevailing international laws, e.g. the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907]], more specifically the [[Martens Clause]], pertaining to the protection of civilian population, but also existing international laws on unlawful confiscation etc. Thus, the actions of the Turkish governments (the Ottoman, the insurgent nationalist movement as well as the succeeding republic), should be viewed from the perspective of Internationally Wrongful Acts. Avedian argues that: {{quote | the Republic not only failed to stop doing the wrongful acts of its predecessor, but it also continued the very internationally wrongful acts committed by the Young Turk government. Thus, the insurgent National Movement, which later became the Republic, made itself responsible for not only its own wrongful acts but also those of its predecessor, including the act of  genocide committed in 1915–1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = European Journal of International Law | first=Vahagn | last=Avedian | format = [[PDF]] | url =http://ejil.oxfordjournals.org/content/23/3/797.full.pdf?keytype=ref&amp;ijkey=4FZRuLROIocgqw8 |title = State Identity, Continuity, and Responsibility: The Ottoman Empire, the Republic of  Turkey and the Armenian Genocide | | year = 2012 | volume = 23 | issue=3 | pages = 797-820}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Sèvres Treaty===

Although there are different opinions on the legitimacy of the Treaty of Sèvres and its relativity to reparation claims, there are specialists who claim that some of its elements retain the force of law. In particular, the fixing of the proper borders of an Armenian state was undertaken pursuant to the treaty and determined by a '''binding arbitral award''', regardless of whether the treaty was ultimately ratified. ''The committee process determining the arbitral award was agreed to by the parties'' and, according to international law, the resulting determination has legal force regardless of the ultimate fate of the treaty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Theriault&quot;/&gt;

===Lawsuits===

In July 2004, after [[California]] Legislature passed the [[Armenian Genocide Insurance Act]], descendants of Armenian Genocide victims settled a case for about 2,400 [[life insurance]] policies from [[New York Life]] written on Armenians living in the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reparations&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Brophy | first = Alfred L. | title = Reparations: Pro &amp; Con | publisher = Oxford University Press |year= 2006 | location = New York | pages = 119–120 | isbn=0-19-530408-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1918, the Turkish government attempted to recover for the people it had killed with the argument that there are no identifiable heirs to the policy holders. The settlement provided $20 million, of which $11 million was for heirs of the Genocide victims.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reparations&quot;/&gt;

=== Memorials ===
{{See also|List of Armenian Genocide memorials}}
[[File:Tzitsernakapert.jpg|thumb|300px|The  [[Tsitsernakaberd|Tsitsernakaberd Armenian Genocide memorial]] in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenia]]]]
Over 135 memorials, spread across 25 countries, commemorate the Armenian Genocide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armenian-genocide.org/memorials.html Memorials to the Armenian Genocide], Armenian National Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, the 50th anniversary of the genocide, a [[1965 Yerevan demonstrations|24-hour mass protest]] was initiated in [[Yerevan]] demanding recognition of the Armenian Genocide by Soviet authorities. The memorial was completed two years later, at [[Tsitsernakaberd]] above the [[Hrazdan]] gorge in Yerevan. The {{convert|44|m|ft}} [[Stela|stele]] symbolizes the national rebirth of Armenians. Twelve slabs are positioned in a circle, representing 12&amp;nbsp;lost provinces in present day Turkey. At the center of the circle there is an [[eternal flame]]. Each April 24, hundreds of thousands of people walk to the genocide monument and lay flowers around the eternal flame.

Another memorial, in [[Alfortville]], France, near Paris, was bombed on May 3, 1984, by a hit-team headed by [[Grey Wolves]] member [[Abdullah Çatlı]] and paid by the [[National Intelligence Organization (Turkey)|Turkish intelligence agency (MİT)]].&lt;ref name=Zaman_Ergenekon&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=150621 Ergenekon document reveals MİT's assassination secrets], ''[[Today's Zaman]]'', 19 August 2008. {{en icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Representation in popular culture ===
{{main|Armenian Genocide in culture}}
The earliest example of the Armenian genocide on art was a medal issued in [[St. Petersburg]], signifying Russian sympathy for Armenian suffering. It was struck in 1915, as the massacres and deportations were still raging.  Since then, dozens of medals in different countries have been commissioned to commemorate the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Sarkisyan |first = Henry |title = Works of the State History History Museum of Armenia | volume = IV: Armenian Theme in Russian Medallic Art |publisher = Hayastan | year= 1975 |location = Yerevan |page = 136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several eyewitness accounts of the events were published, notably those of Swedish missionary [[Alma Johansson]] and U.S. Ambassador [[Henry Morgenthau, Sr.]] German medic [[Armin Wegner]] wrote several books about the events he witnessed while stationed in the Ottoman Empire. Years later, having returned to Germany, Wegner was imprisoned for opposing Nazism,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hgs.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/8/3/395 Document: Armin T.

It was a bestseller that became particularly popular among the youth of the Jewish ghettos during the Nazi era.&lt;ref name = &quot;Auron&quot; /&gt;{{rp |302–4}}

[[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s 1988 novel ''[[Bluebeard (book)|Bluebeard]]'' features the Armenian Genocide as an underlying theme. Other novels incorporating the Armenian Genocide include [[Louis de Berniéres]]' ''Birds without Wings'', [[Edgar Hilsenrath]]'s German-language ''[[The Story of the Last Thought]]'', and Polish [[Stefan Żeromski]]'s 1925 ''[[The Spring to Come]]''. A story in Edward Saint-Ivan's 2006 anthology &quot;The Black Knight's God&quot; includes a fictional survivor of the Armenian Genocide.

The first film about the Armenian Genocide appeared in 1919, a Hollywood production titled ''[[Ravished Armenia]]''. It resonated with acclaimed director [[Atom Egoyan]], influencing his 2002 ''[[Ararat (film)|Ararat]]''. There are also references in [[Elia Kazan]]'s ''[[America, America]]'' and [[Henri Verneuil]]'s ''[[Mayrig]]''. At the [[Berlin Film Festival]] of 2007 Italian directors [[Paolo and Vittorio Taviani]] presented another film about the events, based on Antonia Arslan's book, ''[[La Masseria Delle Allodole]]'' (''The Farm of the Larks'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,466427,00.html |title = Armenian Genocide at the Berlin Film Festival: &quot;The Lark Farm&quot; Wakens Turkish Ghosts | author = Wolfgang Höbel and Alexander Smoltczyk |publisher = Spiegel Online |accessdate = 2007-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Kalinoski's play, ''Beast on the Moon'', is about two Armenian Genocide survivors.

His two ''The Artist and His Mother'' paintings are based on a photograph with his mother taken in Van. 

In 1975, famous French-Armenian singer [[Charles Aznavour]] recorded the song &quot;[[Ils Sont Tombés (Charles Aznavour Song)|Ils sont tombés]]&quot; (&quot;They Fell&quot;), dedicated to the memory of Armenian Genocide victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.azad-hye.net/article/article_view.asp?rec=84 |title = The status of Armenian communities living in the United States |author = Mari Terzian |publisher = Azad-Hye |accessdate = 2007-09-06| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070928093603/http://www.azad-hye.net/article/article_view.asp?rec=84| archivedate= 28 September 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song &quot;Adana&quot;, named for the province of [[Adana massacre|a 1909 pogrom]] of the Armenian people, tells the story of the Armenian Genocide. &quot;Adana&quot; has been translated into 17 languages and recorded by singers around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.evangelicalnews.org/indiv_pr.php?action=display&amp;pr_id=3554 |title = Gospel Artist Given Standing Ovation By Armenian Government Officials |publisher = ANS |accessdate = 2007-09-06| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071009170919/http://www.evangelicalnews.org/indiv_pr.php?action=display&amp;pr_id=3554| archivedate= 9 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2003, [[Diamanda Galás]] released the album ''Defixiones, Will and Testament: Orders from the Dead'', an 80-minute memorial tribute to the Armenian, Assyrian and Greek victims of the genocide in Turkey.  &quot;The performance is an angry meditation on genocide and the politically cooperative denial of it, in particular the Turkish and American denial of the Armenian, Assyrian, and Anatolian Greek genocides from 1914 to 1923&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.diamandagalas.com/defixiones/ | title = Defixiones: Orders from the Dead | first = Diamanda | last = Galás | publisher = The San Francisco Chronicle | accessdate = 2007-10-05| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071011191127/http://diamandagalas.com/defixiones/| archivedate= 11 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
