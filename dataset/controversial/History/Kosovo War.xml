{{Campaignbox Kosovo War}}

The '''Kosovo War''', was an armed conflict in [[Kosovo]], in the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], which involved Yugoslav government forces, Albanian separatist forces ([[Kosovo Liberation Army|KLA]]), and [[NATO]], between 1998 to 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;chrono&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Kosovo war chronology|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|url=http://www.hrw.org/campaigns/kosovo98/timeline.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The KLA, formed in 1991, began attacking police stations and Yugoslav government offices in February 1996, which resulted in an increase in the number of Yugoslav security forces in the region. This led to an escalation into a conflict, although it was initially viewed as an [[insurgency]]. The KLA was regarded by the US as a [[terrorist organization|terrorist group]] until 1998 when it was de-listed for classified reasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;gri&quot;&gt;[http://www.globalresearch.ca/articles/BIS111A.html War on terrorism skipped the KLA] National Post, 13 November 2001, Centre for Research on Globalisation (CRG)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reveron 68&quot;&gt;Reveron, 2006, pages [http://books.google.com/books?id=OjvdsfiWwJcC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PT104#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false 68–69]&lt;/ref&gt; The UK and the US then lobbied France to do the same.&lt;ref name=reveron82&gt;Reveron, p. 82&lt;/ref&gt; The US and NATO then cultivated diplomatic relationships with KLA leaders.

==Background==

===Kosovo in Tito's Yugoslavia (1945–1986)===
{{Section OR|date=September 2009}}
Tensions between the Serbian and Albanian communities in Kosovo simmered throughout the 20th century and occasionally erupted into major violence, particularly during the [[First Balkan War]], [[World War I]], and [[World War II]]. The Socialist government of [[Josip Broz Tito]] systematically repressed nationalist manifestations throughout Yugoslavia, seeking to ensure that no republic or nationality gained dominance over the others. In particular, the power of [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]]—the largest and most populous republic—was diluted by the establishment of autonomous governments in the province of [[Vojvodina]] in the north of Serbia and Kosovo in the south. Kosovo's borders did not precisely match the areas of ethnic Albanian settlement in Yugoslavia (significant numbers of Albanians were left in the [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Republic of Macedonia]], [[Albanians in Montenegro|Montenegro]], and [[Albanians in the Republic of Serbia|Serbia]]{{disambiguation needed|date=May 2012}} though the majority of its inhabitants were Albanian). Kosovo's formal autonomy, established under the 1945 Yugoslav constitution, initially meant relatively little in practice. Tito's [[UDBA|secret police]] cracked down hard on nationalists. In 1956, a number of [[Albanians]] were put on trial in Kosovo on charges of espionage and subversion. The threat of separatism was in fact minimal, as the few underground groups aiming for union with [[Albania]] were politically insignificant. Their long-term impact was substantial, though, as some—particularly the Revolutionary Movement for Albanian Unity, founded by [[Adem Demaci]]—were to form the political core of the [[Kosovo Liberation Army]]. Demaci himself was imprisoned in 1964 along with many of his followers. Yugoslavia underwent a period of economic and political crisis in 1969, as a massive government program of economic reform widened the gap between the rich north and poor south of the country.

Student demonstrations and riots in [[Belgrade]] in June 1968 spread to Kosovo in November the same year, but were quelled by the Yugoslav security forces. However, some of the students' demands—in particular, representative powers for Albanians in both the Serbian and Yugoslav state bodies, and better recognition of the [[Albanian language]]—were conceded by Tito. The [[University of Pristina (1969–1999)|University of Pristina]] was established as an independent institution in 1970, ending a long period when the institution had been run as an outpost of [[Belgrade University]]. The Albanianisation of education in Kosovo was hampered by the lack of Albanian-language educational materials in Yugoslavia, so an agreement was struck with [[Socialist People's Republic of Albania|Albania]] itself to supply textbooks. In 1974, Kosovo's political status was improved further when a new Yugoslav constitution granted an expanded set of political rights. Along with [[Socialist Province of Vojvodina|Vojvodina]], Kosovo was [[Socialist Province of Kosovo|declared a province]] and gained many of the powers of a fully-fledged republic: a seat on the federal presidency and its own assembly, police force, and national bank.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Power was still exercised by the Communist Party, but it was now devolved mainly to ethnic Albanian communists. Tito's death on May 9, 1980 ushered in a long period of political instability, worsened by growing economic crisis and nationalist unrest. The first major outbreak occurred in Kosovo's main city, [[Pristina]], in July 1981, when Albanian students rioted over long queues in their university canteen. This seemingly trivial dispute rapidly spread throughout Kosovo and took on the character of a national revolt, with massive popular demonstrations in many Kosovo towns.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} The protesters demanded that Kosovo should become the seventh republic of Yugoslavia.

However, this was politically unacceptable to Serbia and the [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia]]. Some Serbs (and possibly some Albanian nationalists as well) saw the demands as being a prelude to a &quot;[[Greater Albania]]&quot; which could encompass parts of [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|Montenegro]], the [[Republic of Macedonia]] and Kosovo itself. The Communist Yugoslav presidency quelled the disturbances by sending in riot police and the army, and proclaiming a state of emergency, although it did not repeal the province's autonomy as some Serbian Communists demanded. The Yugoslav press reported that about 11 people had been killed (others claimed a death toll as high as 1,000) and another 4,200 were imprisoned. Kosovo's Communist Party also suffered purges, with several key figures (including its president) expelled.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Hardliners instituted a fierce crackdown on nationalism of all kinds, Albanian and Serbian alike. Kosovo endured a heavy secret police presence throughout most of the 1980s that ruthlessly suppressed any unauthorized nationalist manifestations, both Albanian and Serbian. According to a report quoted by [[Mark Thompson]], as many as 580,000 inhabitants of Kosovo were arrested, interrogated, interned, or reprimanded. Thousands of these lost their jobs or were expelled from their educational establishments. During this time, tension between the Albanian and Serbian communities continued to escalate.

In 1969, the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] had ordered its clergy to compile data on the ongoing problems of Serbs in Kosovo, seeking to pressure the government in Belgrade to do more to protect the Serbian faithful. In February 1982, a group of priests from Serbia proper petitioned their bishops to ask &quot;why the Serbian Church is silent&quot; and why it did not campaign against &quot;the destruction, arson and sacrilege of the holy shrines of Kosovo&quot;. Such concerns did attract interest in Belgrade. Stories appeared from time to time in the Belgrade media claiming that Serbs and Montenegrins were being persecuted. There was a perception among Serbian nationalists that Serbs were being driven out of Kosovo.

In addition to all this, the worsening state of Kosovo's economy made the province a poor choice for Serbs seeking work. Albanians, as well as Serbs, tended to favor their compatriots when employing new recruits, but the number of jobs was too few for the population. Kosovo was the poorest part of Yugoslavia: the average per capita income was $795, compared with the national average of $2,635.

===Riots===
In 1981, it was reported that some 4,000 Serbs moved from Kosovo to Central Serbia after the Kosovo Albanian riots in March that resulted in several Serb deaths and the desecration of Serbian Orthodox architecture and graveyards.&lt;ref&gt;The Associated Press-October 17, 1981 &quot;Minorities Leaving Yugoslav Province Dominated by Albanians&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982 It was concluded that the Serbs were victims of major prejudice and harassment, several murders had been committed by ethnic Albanians, and forming of serious nationalist groups was reality. 33 nationalist formations were dismantled by the Yugoslav Police who sentenced some 280 people (800 fined, 100 under investigation) and seized arms caches and propaganda material.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times (London) February 5, 1982–&quot;Police fail to crush resistance in Kosovo&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987 [[David Binder]] wrote a report on ''[[The New York Times]]'' about the rising nationalism among Albanians in Kosovo. In his report he tells about [[Paraćin massacre]], where an ethnic Albanian soldier in the JNA killed four fellow soldiers and wounded five others.&lt;ref name=NYDB&gt;[[The New York Times]], November 1, 1987, Late City Final Edition (p.14) -&quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/world/in-yugoslavia-rising-ethnic-strife-brings-fears-of-worse-civil-conflict.html In Yugoslavia, Rising Ethnic Strife Brings Fears of Worse Civil Conflict] By David Binder&lt;/ref&gt;

The report quoting Federal Secretary for National Defense, Fleet Adm. Branko Mamula, shows that from 1981–1987, 216 illegal Albanian organizations with 1,435 members were discovered in the JNA. They had prepared the mass killings of officers and soldiers, poisoning food and water, sabotage, breaking in and stealing weapons and ammunition.&lt;ref name=NYDB/&gt;

===Kosovo and the rise of Slobodan Milošević (1986–1990)===
{{Section OR|date=September 2009}}

In Kosovo, growing [[Albanian nationalism]] and separatism led to tensions between Serbs and Albanians. An increasingly poisonous atmosphere led to wild rumors being spread around and otherwise trivial incidents being blown out of proportion.

It was against this tense background that the [[Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]] (SANU, from its Serbian initials, САНУ) conducted a survey of Serbs who had left Kosovo in 1985 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snd-us.com/history/Petrovic-Blagojevic/index.htm|title=The Migration of Serbs and Montenegrins from Kosovo and Metohija|year=2000|publisher=Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts|author=Ruza Petrovic, Marina Blagojevic}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report concluded that a considerable part of those who had left had been under pressure by Albanians to do so.

Sixteen prominent members of the SANU began work in June 1985 on a draft document that was leaked to the public in September 1986. The [[SANU Memorandum]], as it has become known, was hugely controversial. It focused on the political difficulties facing Serbs in Yugoslavia, pointing to Tito's deliberate hobbling of Serbia's power and the difficulties faced by Serbs outside Serbia proper.

The Memorandum paid special attention to Kosovo, arguing that the province's Serbs were being subjected to &quot;physical, political, legal and cultural genocide&quot; in an &quot;open and total war&quot; that had been ongoing since the spring of 1981. It claimed that Kosovo's status in 1986 was a worse historical defeat for the Serbs than any event since liberation from the Ottomans in 1804, thus ranking it above such catastrophes as the Nazi occupation or the First World War occupation of Serbia by the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarians]]. The Memorandum's authors claimed that 200,000 Serbs had moved out of the province over the previous twenty years and warned that there would soon be none left &quot;unless things change radically.&quot; The remedy, according to the Memorandum, was for &quot;genuine security and unambiguous equality for all peoples living in Kosovo and Metohija [to be] established&quot; and &quot;objective and permanent conditions for the return of the expelled [Serbian] nation [to be] created.&quot; It concluded that &quot;Serbia must not be passive and wait and see what the others will say, as it has done so often in the past.&quot;

The SANU Memorandum met with many different reactions. The Albanians saw it as a call for Serbian supremacy at a local level. They claimed that all Serb emigrants had left Kosovo for economic reasons. Other Yugoslav nationalities, notably the Slovenes and Croats, saw a threat in the call for a more assertive Serbia. Serbs themselves were divided: many welcomed it, while the Communist old guard strongly attacked its message. One of those who denounced it was Serbian Communist Party official [[Slobodan Milošević]].

In November 1988, Kosovo's head of the provincial committee was arrested. In March 1989, Milošević announced an &quot;[[anti-bureaucratic revolution]]&quot; in Kosovo and Vojvodina, curtailing their autonomy as well as imposing a curfew and a state of emergency in Kosovo due to violent demonstrations, resulting in 24 deaths (including two policemen). Milošević and his government claimed that the constitutional changes were necessary to protect Kosovo's remaining Serbs against harassment from the Albanian majority.

On 17 November 1988, [[Kaqusha Jashari]] and [[Azem Vllasi]] were forced to resign from the leadership of the [[League of Communists of Kosovo]] (LCK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia 1997–1999|first1=André|last1=Klip|first2=Göran|last2=Sluiter|page=12|series=Annotated Leading Cases of International Criminal Tribunals|volume=3|isbn=978-90-5095-141-8|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kwR88-rsWaoC&amp;pg=PA12|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Yugoslavia: A Concise History|last=Benson|first=Leslie|year=2001|page=149|isbn=978-0-333-79241-4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=iw9PHRR1oe4C&amp;pg=PA149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Branka1993p208&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Destruction of Yugoslavia: Tracking the Break-Up 1980–92|first=Branka|last=Magaš|year=1993|page=208|isbn=978-0-86091-593-5|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=d5np99Vgc0YC&amp;pg=PA208}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1989 the Serbian Assembly proposed amendments to the Constitution of Serbia which would remove the word &quot;Socialist&quot; from the Serbian Republic's title, establish multi-party elections, remove the independence of institutions of the autonomous provinces such as Kosovo, and rename Kosovo as the [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija]].{{sfn|Klip|Sluiter|pp=12–13}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Europa2001p347&quot;/&gt; In February Kosovar Albanians demonstrated in large numbers against the proposal, emboldened by striking miners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Branka1993p208&quot;/&gt;{{sfn|Klip|Sluiter|p=13}} Serbs in Belgrade protested against the Kosovo Albanian's separatism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bethlehem1997pliii&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The 'Yugoslav' Crisis in International Law|last1=Bethlehem|first1=Daniel L.|last2=Weller|first2=Marc|year=1997|page=xx|series=Cambridge International Documents Series|volume=5|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-46304-1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7SczBzxA6-IC&amp;pg=PR20|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 March 1989 the [[Presidency of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Presidency of Yugoslavia]] imposed special measures assigning responsibility for public security to the federal government.{{sfn|Klip|Sluiter|p=13}} On 23 March the Assembly of Kosovo voted to accept the proposed amendments although most Albanian delegates abstained.{{sfn|Klip|Sluiter|p=13}} In early 1990 Kosovar Albanians held mass demonstrations against the special measures, which were lifted on 18 April 1990 and responsibility for public security was again assigned to Serbia.{{sfn|Klip|Sluiter|p=13}}{{sfn|Bethlehem|Weller|1997|p=xxii}}

====Analysis====
{{Section OR|date=September 2009}}

Crucially, as both provinces had a vote in the eight member Yugoslav Presidency, this gave Milosevic an automatic four votes when combined with Serbia and Montenegro (which was closely allied to Serbia). [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|Slovenia]], [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]], [[Socialist Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] and [[Socialist Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] thus had to maintain an uneasy alliance to prevent Milošević from driving through constitutional changes. Serbia's political changes were ratified in a July 5, 1990 [[referendum]] across the entire republic of Serbia, including Kosovo. As a result of these measures more than 80,000 Kosovo Albanians were expelled from their state jobs in Kosovo. A new Serb curriculum was imposed in all higher education in Kosovo, a move which was rejected by Albanians who responded by creating their parallel education system.

The impact on Kosovo was drastic. The reduction of its autonomy was accompanied by the abolition of its political institutions (including the [[League of Communists of Kosovo]]); its assembly and government were formally disbanded. As most of Kosovo's industry was state-owned, the changes brought a wholesale change of corporate cadres. Technically, few were sacked outright: their companies required them to sign loyalty pledges, which most Albanians would not sign, although a few did and remained employed in Serbian state companies right up to 1999.

Albanian cultural autonomy was also drastically reduced. TV and radio broadcasts in Albanian ceased. Albanian was no longer an official language of the province. The University of Pristina, seen as a hotbed of [[Albanian nationalism]], was purged: 800 lecturers at Pristina University were sacked and 22,500 of the 23,000 students expelled. Some 40,000 Yugoslav troops and police replaced the original Albanian-run security forces. A punitive regime was imposed that was harshly condemned as a &quot;[[police state]]&quot;. Poverty and unemployment reached catastrophic levels, with about 80% of Kosovo's population becoming unemployed. As many as a third of adult male Albanians chose to go abroad (particularly to Germany and [[Switzerland]]) to find work.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

With Kosovo's Communist Party effectively broken up by Milošević's crackdown, the dominant Albanian political party position passed to the [[Democratic League of Kosovo]], led by the writer [[Ibrahim Rugova]]. It responded to the abolition of Kosovo's autonomy by pursuing a policy of peaceful resistance. Rugova took the very practical line that armed resistance would be futile given Serbia's military strength and would lead only to a bloodbath in the province. He called on the Albanian populace to boycott the Yugoslav and Serbian states by not participating in any elections, by ignoring the [[military draft]] (compulsory in Yugoslavia), and most important, by not paying any taxes or duties to the State. He also called for the creation of parallel Albanian schools, clinics, and hospitals. In September 1991, the shadow Kosovo Assembly organized a [[referendum]] on independence for Kosovo. Despite widespread harassment and violence by Serbian security forces, the referendum achieved a reported 90% turnout among the province's Albanians, and a 98% vote—nearly a million votes in all—which approved the creation of an independent &quot;Republic of Kosovo&quot;. In May 1992, a second referendum elected Rugova as President of Kosovo. The Serbian government declared that both referendums were illegal, and their results null and void.

==Eruption of War==

===The slide to war (1996–1998)===
{{Kosovo War}}
{{Section OR|date=September 2009}}
Rugova's policy of passive resistance succeeded in keeping Kosovo quiet during the war with [[Slovenia]], and the wars in [[Croatia]] and [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]] during the early 1990s. However, as evidenced by the emergence of the KLA, this came at the cost of increasing frustration among Kosovo's Albanian population. In the mid-1990s, Rugova pleaded for a United Nations peacekeeping force for Kosovo. In 1997, Milošević was promoted to the presidency of the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (comprising Serbia and Montenegro since its inception in April 1992).

Continuing Serbian repression had radicalized many Albanians, some of whom decided that only armed resistance would change the situation. On April 22, 1996, four attacks on Serbian security personnel were carried out almost simultaneously in several parts of Kosovo. A hitherto-unknown terrorist organization calling itself the &quot;[[Kosovo Liberation Army]]&quot; (KLA) subsequently claimed responsibility. The nature of the KLA was at first highly mysterious.

It is widely believed that the KLA received financial and material support from the Kosovo Albanian diaspora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.kosovo.net/judah2.html | title = Kosovo: Peace Now | publisher = kosovo.net, originally from b92.net | author = Tim Judah | date = 1999-08-12 | accessdate = 2008-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;interpol&quot;/&gt; In early 1997, [[Albania]] collapsed into chaos following the fall of President [[Sali Berisha]]. Military stockpiles were looted with impunity by criminal gangs, with much of the hardware ending up in western Kosovo and boosting the growing KLA arsenal. [[Bujar Bukoshi]], shadow Prime Minister in exile (in [[Zürich]], Switzerland), created a group called FARK ([[Armed Forces of the Republic of Kosova]]) which was reported to have been disbanded and absorbed by the KLA in 1998.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The Yugoslav government considered the KLA to be &quot;terrorists&quot; and &quot;[[insurgents]]&quot; who indiscriminately attacked police and civilians, while most Albanians saw the KLA as &quot;[[Resistance movement|freedom fighters]]&quot;.
In 1998, the U.S. State Department listed the KLA as a terrorist organization,&lt;ref name=&quot;interpol&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://judiciary.house.gov/Legacy/muts1213.htm | title = The Threat Posed by the Convergence of Organized Crime, Drugs Trafficking and Terrorism. | author = written Testimony of Ralf Mutschke Assistant Director, Criminal Intelligence Directorate International Criminal Police Organization&amp;nbsp;— Interpol General Secretariat before a hearing of the Committee on the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime | publisher = U.S. House Judiciary Committee | date = 2000-12-13 | accessdate = 2008-05-31 | quote = In 1998, the U.S. State Department listed the KLA as a terrorist organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1999 the [[Republican Party of the United States|Republican]] Policy Committee of the [[U.S. Senate]] expressed its troubles with the &quot;effective alliance&quot; of the [[Democratic Party of the United States|Democratic]] Clinton administration with the KLA due to &quot;numerous reports from reputable unofficial sources &quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;senate&quot;/&gt;

In 2000, a [[BBC]] article stated that ''Nato at War'' shows how the United States, which had described the KLA as &quot;terrorist&quot;, now sought to form a relationship with the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/674056.stm|title=Behind the Kosovo crisis|author=Allan Little|publisher=BBC|date=2000-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. envoy Robert Gelbard referred to the KLA as terrorists.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_june_1998&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/121818.stm|title=The KLA&amp;nbsp;— terrorists or freedom fighters?|date=1998-06-28|publisher=BBC|author=Nened Sebak}}&lt;/ref&gt; Responding to criticism, he later clarified to the House Committee on International Relations that &quot;while it has committed 'terrorist acts,' it has 'not been classified legally by the U.S. Government as a terrorist organization.'&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;senate&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.senate.gov/~rpc/releases/1999/fr033199.htm | title = The Kosovo Liberation Army: Does Clinton Policy Support Group with Terror, Drug Ties? | publisher = [[U.S. Senate]], Republican Policy Committee | date = 1999-03-31 | accessdate = 2008-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 1998, he held talks with two men who claimed they were political leaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_june_1998&quot;/&gt;

Meanwhile, the U.S. held an &quot;outer wall of sanctions&quot; on Yugoslavia which had been tied to a series of issues, Kosovo being one of them. These were maintained despite the agreement at Dayton to end all sanctions. The Clinton administration claimed that Dayton bound Yugoslavia to hold discussions with Rugova over Kosovo.

The crisis escalated in December 1997 at the Peace Implementation Council meeting in Bonn, where the International Community (as defined in the [[Dayton Agreement]]) agreed to give the High Representative in Bosnia sweeping powers, including the right to dismiss elected leaders. At the same time, Western diplomats insisted that Kosovo be discussed, and that Serbia and Yugoslavia be responsive to Albanian demands there. The delegation from Serbia stormed out of the meetings in protest.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

This was followed by the return of the Contact Group that oversaw the last phases of the Bosnian conflict and declarations from European powers demanding that Serbia solve the problem in Kosovo.

===War begins===
KLA attacks suddenly intensified, centered on the [[Drenica]] valley area, with the compound of one [[Adem Jashari]] being a particular focal point. Days after Robert Gelbard described the KLA as a terrorist group, Serbian police responded to the KLA attacks in the [[Likosane]] area, and pursued some of the KLA to Cirez, resulting in the deaths of 16 Albanian fighters&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bmlv.gv.at/pdf_pool/publikationen/01_kse1_02_tck.pdf Stefan Troebst: THE KOSOVO CONFLICT, 1998. (Serbian Raid against Drenica, February to March)&lt;/ref&gt; and four Serbian policemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fco.gov.uk/Files/kfile/koschron.pdf|format=PDF|title=Kosovo Chronology: From 1997 to the end of the conflict|month=June|year=1999|publisher=[[British Parliament]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first serious action of the war had begun.

Despite some accusations of summary executions and killings of civilians, condemnations from Western capitals were not as voluble as they would become later. Serb police began to pursue Jashari and his followers in the village of [[Donje Prekaz]]. A massive firefight at the Jashari compound led to the massacre of 60 Albanians, of which eighteen were women and ten were under the age of sixteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/campaigns/kosovo98/timeline.shtml|title=Kosovo War Crimes Chronology|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This March 5 event provoked massive condemnation from the western capitals. [[Madeleine Albright]] stated that &quot;this crisis is not an internal affair of the FRY&quot;.

On March 24, Serbian forces surrounded the village of Glodjane, in the Dukagjin operational zone, and attacked a rebel compound there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iwpr.net/?p=tri&amp;s=f&amp;o=235663&amp;apc_state=henitri2005|title=Ramush Haradinaj|author=Stacy Sullivan|date=2005-03-11|publisher=[[Institute for War and Peace Reporting|IWPR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite their superior firepower, the Serbian forces failed to destroy the KLA unit which had been their objective. Although there were deaths and severe injuries on the Albanian side, the insurgency in [[Glodjane]] was far from stamped out. It was in fact to become one of the strongest centers of resistance in the upcoming war.

The KLA's first goal was thus to merge its Drenica stronghold with their stronghold in Albania proper, and this would shape the first few months of the fighting.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1998-10-20/news/9810190342_1_kosovo-liberation-army-serbian-forces-serbian-officials&lt;/ref&gt;

The Serbs also continued their efforts at diplomacy, attempting to arrange talks with Ibrahim Rugova's staff (talks which Rugova and his staff refused to attend). After several failed meetings, Ratko Marković, chairman of the Serbian delegation to the meetings, invited representatives of Kosovo minority groups to attend while maintaining his invitation to the Albanians. Serbian President [[Milan Milutinović]] attended one of the meetings, though Rugova did not. He and his staff insisted on talking to Yugoslav officials, not ''Serbian'' ones, and only to discuss the modalities of Kosovo independence.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

A new Serbian government was also formed at this time, led by the [[Socialist Party of Serbia]] and the [[Serbian Radical Party]]. Ultra-nationalist Radical Party chairman [[Vojislav Šešelj]] became a deputy prime minister. This increased the dissatisfaction with Serbia's position among Western diplomats and spokespersons.

In early April, Serbia arranged for [[Serbian foreign mediation in Kosovo referendum, 1998|a referendum]] on the issue of foreign interference in Kosovo. Serbian voters decisively rejected foreign interference in this crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=rs011998 Serbien (Jugoslawien), 23. April 1998 : Internationale Beobachter für Kosovo] Direct Democracy&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the KLA claimed much of the area in and around [[Dečani]] and ran a territory based in the village of Glođane, encompassing its surroundings. So, on May 31, 1998, the Yugoslav army and the Serb Ministry of the Interior police began an operation to clear the border of the KLA. NATO's response to this offensive was mid-June's Operation Determined Falcon, an air show over the Yugoslav borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/determined_falcon.htm |title=Operation Determined Falcon |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time, the Yugoslav President Milošević reached an arrangement with Boris Yeltsin of Russia to stop offensive operations and prepare for talks with the Albanians, who, through this whole crisis, refused to talk to the Serbian side, but not the Yugoslav. In fact, the only meeting between Milošević and Ibrahim Rugova took place on May 15 in Belgrade, two days after [[Richard Holbrooke]] announced that it would take place. One month later, Holbrooke, after a trip to Belgrade where he threatened Milošević that if he did not obey, &quot;what's left of your country will implode&quot;, he visited the border areas affected by the fighting in early June; there he was famously photographed with the KLA. The publication of these images sent a signal to the KLA, its supporters and sympathizers, and to observers in general, that the U.S. was decisively backing the KLA and the Albanian population in Kosovo.

The Yeltsin agreement included Milošević's allowing international representatives to set up a mission in Kosovo-Metohija to monitor the situation there. This was the [[Kosovo Diplomatic Observer Mission]] (KDOM) that began operations in early July. The American government welcomed this part of the agreement, but denounced the initiative's call for a mutual cease fire. Rather, the Americans demanded that the Serbian-Yugoslavian side should cease fire &quot;without linkage...to a cessation in terrorist activities&quot;.

All through June and into mid-July, the KLA maintained its advance. KLA surrounded [[Peć]], [[Đakovica]], and had set up an interim capital in the town of [[Mališevo]] (north of [[Orahovac]]). The KLA troops infiltrated [[Suva Reka]], and the northwest of Priština. They moved on to the Belacevec coal pits and captured them in late June, threatening energy supplies in the region. Their tactics as usual focused mainly on [[Guerrilla warfare|guerilla]] and [[mountain warfare]], and harassing and ambushing Serb forces and police patrols.

The tide turned in mid-July when the KLA captured Orahovac. On July 17, 1998, two close-by villages to Orahovac, Retimlije and Opteruša, were also captured. Similar, even if less systematic events took place in the town of Orahovac and the larger Serb village of Velika hoċa. The Orthodox monastery of Zociste 3 miles (5&amp;nbsp;km) from Orehovac—famous for the relics of the Saints Kosmas and Damianos and revered also by local Albanians—was robbed, its monks deported to a KLA prison camp, and, while empty, the monastery church and all its buildings were leveled to the ground by mining. This led to a series of Serb and Yugoslav offensives which would continue into the beginning of August.

A new set of KLA attacks in mid-August triggered Yugoslavian operations in south-central Kosovo south of the Priština-Peć road. This wound down with the capture of [[Klecka]] on August 23 and the discovery of a KLA-run crematorium in which some of their victims were found. The KLA began an offensive on September 1 around [[Prizren]], causing Yugoslavian military activity there. In [[Metohija]], around [[Peć]], another offensive caused condemnation as international officials expressed fear that a large column of displaced people would be attacked.

In early mid-September, for the first time, some KLA activity was reported in northern Kosovo around [[Podujevo]]. Finally, in late September, a determined effort was made to clear the KLA out of the northern and central parts of Kosovo and out of the Drenica valley itself. During this time many threats were made from Western capitals but these were tempered somewhat by the elections in Bosnia, as they did not want Serbian Democrats and Radicals to win. Following the elections, however, the threats intensified once again but a galvanizing event was needed. They got it on September 28, when the mutilated corpses of a family were discovered by KDOM outside the village of [[Gornje Obrinje massacre|Gornje Obrinje]]; the bloody doll from there became the rallying image for the ensuing war.

===UN, NATO, and OSCE (1998–1999)===
On 23 September 1998 acting under [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter]] the [[United Nations Security Council|UN Security Council]] adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1199|Resolution 1199]].  This expressed 'grave concern' at reports reaching the Secretary General that over 230,000 persons had been displaced from their homes by 'the excessive and indiscriminate use of force by Serbian security forces and the Yugoslav Army',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=S/RES/1199(1998) UNSCR 1199]&lt;/ref&gt; demanding that all parties in Kosovo and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) cease hostilities and maintain a ceasefire. On 24 September the [[North Atlantic Council]] (NAC) of [[NATO]] issued an &quot;activation warning&quot; (ACTWARN) taking NATO to an increased level of military preparedness for both a limited air option and a phased air campaign in Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Statement by the Secretary General following the ACTWARN decision|date=24 September 1998|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/1998/p980924e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The other major issue for those who saw no option but to resort to the use of force was the estimated 250,000 displaced Albanians, 30,000 of whom were out in the woods, without warm clothing or shelter, with winter fast approaching.

Meanwhile, the U.S. Ambassador to the [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Christopher R. Hill|Christopher Hill]], was leading shuttle diplomacy between an Albanian delegation, led by Rugova, and the Yugoslav and Serbian authorities. It was these meetings which were shaping what was to be the peace plan to be discussed during a period of planned NATO occupation of Kosovo.

During a period of two weeks, threats intensified, culminating in NATO's Activation Order being given. All was ready for the bombs to fly; Richard Holbrooke went to Belgrade in the hope of reaching an agreement with Milošević.

Officially, the international community demanded an end to fighting. It specifically demanded that the Serbs end its offensives against the KLA whilst attempting to convince the KLA to drop its bid for independence. Moreover, attempts were made to persuade Milošević to permit NATO peacekeeping troops to enter Kosovo. This, they argued, would allow for the Christopher Hill peace process to proceed and yield a peace agreement.

On 13 October 1998 the [[North Atlantic Council]] issued issue activation orders (ACTORDs) for the execution of both limited [[air strike]]s and a phased [[aerial warfare|air campaign]] in Yugoslavia which would begin in approximately 96 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Statement to the Press by the Secretary General Following Decision on the ACTORD|date=13 October 1998|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/speech/1998/s981013a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 October the NATO [[Kosovo Verification Mission]] (KVM) Agreement for a ceasefire was signed, and the deadline for withdrawal was extended to 27 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;gs_oee&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation Eagle Eye |publisher=[[GlobalSecurity.org]]|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/eagle_eye.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nato_oaf&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Operation Allied Force|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.afsouth.nato.int/archives/operations/detforce/force.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Serbian withdrawal commenced on or around 25 October 1998, and [[Operation Eagle Eye (Kosovo)|Operation Eagle Eye]] commenced on 30 October.&lt;ref name=&quot;gs_oee&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nato_oaf&quot;/&gt;

The KVM was a large contingent of unarmed [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) peace monitors (officially known as verifiers) that moved into Kosovo. Their inadequacy was evident from the start. They were nicknamed the &quot;clockwork oranges&quot; in reference to their brightly coloured vehicles. Fighting resumed in December 1998 after both sides broke the ceasefire.&lt;ref name=Maisonneuve&gt;{{cite web|last=Brigadier-General Maisonneuve|title=THE OSCE KOSOVO VERIFICATION MISSION|url=http://www.journal.forces.gc.ca/vo1/no1/doc/49-54-eng.pdf|work=Canadian Military Journal|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The January to March 1999 phase of the war brought increasing insecurity in urban areas, including bombings and murders. Such attacks took place during the Rambouillet talks in February and as the Kosovo Verification Agreement unraveled in March. Killings on the roads continued and increased. There were military confrontations in, among other places, the [[Vučitrn]] area in February and the heretofore unaffected [[Kačanik]] area in early March.

On 15 January 1999 the [[Račak massacre]] occurred when &quot;45 Kosovan Albanian farmers were rounded up, led up a hill and massacred&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Massacre that started long haul to justice|last=Strauss|first=Julius|date=30 June 2001|publisher=The Daily Telegraph|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1312900/Massacre-that-started-long-haul-to-justice.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bodies had been discovered by OSCE monitors, including Head of Mission [[William Walker (diplomat)|William Walker]], and foreign news correspondents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Racak massacre haunts Milosevic trial|last=Silverman|first=Jon|date=14 February 2002|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1812847.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ustrans&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=TRANSCRIPT: AMB.

The incident was immediately condemned as a massacre by the [[Western countries]] and the [[United Nations Security Council]], and later became the basis of one of the charges of war crimes leveled against Milošević and his top officials. This massacre was the turning point of the war. [[NATO]] decided that the conflict could only be settled by introducing a military peacekeeping force under the auspices of NATO, to forcibly restrain the two sides.

Priština, the capital of Kosovo, had been subjected to heavy firefights and segregation according to OSCE reports.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

===The Rambouillet Conference (January–March 1999)===
On 30 January 1999 NATO issued a statement announcing that the [[North Atlantic Council]] had agreed that &quot;the NATO Secretary General may authorise air strikes against targets on FRY territory&quot; to &quot;[compel] compliance with the demands of the international community and [to achieve] a political settlement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Statement by the North Atlantic Council on Kosovo|date=30 January 1999|publisher=NATO|url=http://www.nato.int/docu/pr/1999/p99-012e.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this was most obviously a threat to the Milošević government, it also included a coded threat to the Albanians: any decision would depend on the &quot;position and actions of the Kosovo Albanian leadership and all Kosovo Albanian armed elements in and around Kosovo.&quot;{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Also on 30 January 1999 the Contact Group issued a set of &quot;non-negotiable principles&quot; which made up a package known as &quot;Status Quo Plus&quot;—effectively the restoration of Kosovo's pre-1990 autonomy within Serbia, plus the introduction of democracy and supervision by international organizations. It also called for a peace conference to be held in February 1999 at the [[Château de Rambouillet]], outside Paris.

The [[Rambouillet Agreement|Rambouillet talks]] began on February 6, 1999, with [[Secretary General of NATO|NATO Secretary General]] [[Javier Solana]] negotiating with both sides. They were intended to conclude by February 19. The Serbian delegation was led by then president of Serbia [[Milan Milutinović]], while Milošević himself remained in Belgrade. This was in contrast to the 1995 [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton conference]] that ended the war in Bosnia, where Milošević negotiated in person. The absence of Milošević was interpreted as a sign that the real decisions were being made back in Belgrade, a move that aroused criticism in Serbia as well as abroad; Kosovo's Serbian Orthodox bishop [[Artemije]] traveled all the way to Rambouillet to protest that the delegation was wholly unrepresentative. At this time speculation about an indictment of Milošević for war crimes was rife, so his absence may have been motivated by fear of arrest.

The first phase of negotiations was successful. In particular, a statement was issued by the Contact Group co-chairmen on February 23, 1999 that the negotiations &quot;have led to a ''consensus'' on substantial autonomy for Kosovo, including on mechanisms for free and fair elections to democratic institutions, for the governance of Kosovo, for the protection of human rights and the rights of members of national communities; and for the establishment of a fair judicial system&quot;. They went on to say that &quot;a political framework is now in place&quot;, leaving the further work of finalizing &quot;the implementation Chapters of the Agreement, including the modalities of the ''invited international'' civilian and military presence in Kosovo&quot;. During the next month, however, NATO, under the influence of US diplomats Rubin and Albright, sought to impose a forced, as opposed to invited, military presence.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} The tilting of NATO towards the KLA organization is chronicled in the BBC Television &quot;Moral Combat: NATO at War&quot; program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/events/panorama/transcripts/transcript_12_03_00.txt|title=Moral Combat:NATO at War|author=Allan Little|publisher=BBC|date=2000-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; This happened despite the fact, quoting General [[Klaus Naumann]] (Chairman of NATO Military Committee), that &quot;Ambassador Walker stated in the NAC (North Atlantic Council) that the majority of [ceasefire] violations was caused by the KLA&quot;.

In the end, on March 18, 1999, the Albanian, American, and British delegations signed what became known as the [[Rambouillet Agreement|Rambouillet Accords]] while the Serbian and Russian delegations refused as it called for the complete and unrestricted movement of NATO on the whole of Serbia's territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/articles/200005--.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Caraccilo2011p44&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond Guns and Steel: A War Termination Strategy|first=Dominic J.|last=Caraccilo|year=2011|page=44|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|isbn=978-0-313-39149-1|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=FDA8dQyaQ9MC&amp;pg=PA44|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accords called for NATO administration of Kosovo as an autonomous province within Yugoslavia, a force of 30,000 NATO troops to maintain order in Kosovo; an unhindered right of passage for NATO troops on Yugoslav territory, including Kosovo; and immunity for NATO and its agents to Yugoslav law.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caraccilo2011p44&quot;/&gt; These latter provisions were much the same as had been applied to Bosnia for the [[SFOR]] (Stabilization Force) mission there. There were also many who viewed the accords as an excuse to bomb the whole of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/mar/24/serbia-kosovo&lt;/ref&gt;

While the accords did not fully satisfy the Albanians, they were much too radical for the Serbs, who responded by substituting a drastically revised text that even the [[Russia]]ns (traditional allies of the Serbs) found unacceptable. It sought to reopen the painstakingly negotiated political status of Kosovo and deleted all of the proposed implementation measures. Among many other changes in the proposed new version, it eliminated the entire chapter on humanitarian assistance and reconstruction, removed virtually all international oversight and dropped any mention of invoking &quot;the will of the people [of Kosovo]&quot; in determining the final status of the province.

Two proposals were on the table on the eve of the bombing. One was the Rambouillet accord, presented to Serbia as an ultimatum. The second was Serbia’s position, formulated in its March 15 “Revised Draft Agreement” and the Serb National Assembly Resolution of March 23. A serious concern for protecting Kosovars might well have brought into consideration other options as well, including, perhaps, something like the 1992–93 proposal of the Serbian president of Yugoslavia, Dobrica Cosic, that Kosovo be partitioned, separating itself from Serbia apart from “a number of Serbian enclaves.” At the time, the proposal was rejected by Ibrahim Rugova’s Republic of Kosovo, which had declared independence and set up a parallel government; but it might have served as a basis for negotiation in the different circumstances of early 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;/&gt; 

Events proceeded rapidly after the failure at Rambouillet and the alternative Serbian proposal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caraccilo2011p44&quot;/&gt; The international monitors from the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] withdrew on 22 March, for fear of the monitors' safety ahead of the anticipated NATO bombing campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caraccilo2011p44&quot;/&gt;

On March 23, the Serbian assembly accepted the principle of autonomy for Kosovo and non-military part of the agreement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caraccilo2011p44&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serbia-info.com/news/1999-03/24/10030.html|title=Conclusions of Serbian parliament|publisher=[[Government of Serbia]]|date=1999-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the Serbian side had objections to the military part of the Rambouillet agreement, particularly appendix B that foresees free access to all of Serbia for NATO troops, which it characterized as &quot;NATO occupation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Caraccilo2011p44&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/www/regions/eur/ksvo_rambouillet_text.html|title=Interim Agreement for Peace and Self-Government in Kosovo|publisher=[[U.S. State Department]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Perhaps even more striking is that the Rambouillet ultimatum, though universally described as the peace proposal, was also kept from the public, particularly the provisions that were apparently introduced in the final moments of the Paris peace talks (appendix B) in March after Serbia had expressed agreement with the main political proposals, and that virtually guaranteed rejection.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;/&gt;

NATO's bombing campaign lasted from March 24 to June 11, 1999, involving up to 1,000 aircraft operating mainly from bases in [[Italy]] and aircraft carriers stationed in the [[Adriatic]]. [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk]] [[cruise missile]]s were also extensively used, fired from aircraft, ships, and submarines. All of the NATO members were involved to some degree—with the exception of Greece. Over the ten weeks of the conflict, NATO aircraft flew over 38,000 combat missions. For the [[German Air Force]] (''Luftwaffe''), it was the second time it had participated in a conflict since World War II after the Bosnian War.

[[File:CK building on fire 1999.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ušće Tower|CK]] building in the moments after bombing.]]

The proclaimed goal of the NATO operation was summed up by its spokesman as &quot;[[Serbs]] out, peacekeepers in, refugees back&quot;. That is, Yugoslav troops would have to leave Kosovo and be replaced by international peacekeepers to ensure that the Albanian refugees could return to their homes. The campaign was initially designed to destroy Yugoslav air defenses and high-value military targets. It did not go very well at first, with bad weather hindering many sorties early on. NATO had seriously underestimated Milošević's will to resist: few in Brussels thought that the campaign would last more than a few days, and although the initial bombardment was more than just a pin-prick, it was nowhere near the concentrated bombardments seen in Baghdad in 1991. On the ground, the ethnic cleansing campaign by the Serbians was stepped up.  In actions unparalleled since World War Two, Serbian forces expelled hundreds of thousands of Kosovo Albanians from Kosovo, in miserable conditions. UNHCR representatives reported on 3 April that, &quot;During 2 April, an estimated 45,000 Kosovars arrived at the Macedonian border with Kosovo, of whom around 25,000 in six trains carrying people who report that they were expelled from Pristina. The new arrivals were exhausted and traumatized.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/news/NEWS/3ae6b80f14.html UNHCR Kosovo Crisis Update 3 April 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;  On 6 April, UNHCR representatives were reporting that &quot;at least 25,000 Kosovars arrived at the main Albanian border point at Morini between Monday and Tuesday mornings and a further 15,000 at the mountain frontier of Qafa Prushit, bringing the estimated total to 262,000 ... Virtually every Kosovar arriving at Qafa Prushit came on foot in very, very bad physical condition ... refugees interviewed said men were both being tortured and even executed in front of their families ... Serbian police stationed just opposite the Albanian border post warned journalists they would shoot if the correspondents approached. Aid officials were told to withdraw 500 metres from the crossing.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/news/NEWS/3ae6b80d0.html UNHCR Kosovo Crisis Update 6 April 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;  A report written for the UNHCR after the crisis &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org/research/RESEARCH/3ba0bbeb4.pdf The Kosovo refugee crisis: An independent evaluation of UNHCR’s emergency preparedness and response, page v]&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that 'half a million people arrived in neighbouring areas in the course of about
two weeks, and a few weeks later the total was over 850,000'.  The Serbian authorities have never acknowledged these UNHCR figures.  On 25 March [[Arkan]] appeared at the [[Hyatt]] hotel in Belgrade where most of Western journalists were staying and warned all of them to leave Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,22121,00.html|title=Serbs Unplug CNN|author=Tony Karon|publisher=[[TIME Magazine]]''|date=1999-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NATO military operations switched increasingly to attacking Yugoslav units on the ground, hitting targets as small as individual tanks and artillery pieces, as well as continuing with the strategic bombardment. This activity was, however, heavily constrained by politics, as each target needed to be approved by all nineteen member states. [[Montenegro]] was bombed on several occasions but NATO eventually desisted to prop up the precarious position of its anti-Milošević leader, [[Milo Đukanović|Đukanović]]. So-called &quot;[[dual-use]]&quot; targets, of use to both civilians and the military, were attacked, including bridges across the [[Danube]], factories, power stations, schools, houses, nurseries, hospitals, telecommunications facilities and, controversially, the headquarters of [[Yugoslavian Leftists]], a political party led by Milošević's wife, and the Serbian state television broadcasting tower. Some saw these actions as violations of international law and the [[Geneva Conventions]] in particular. NATO, however, argued that these facilities were potentially useful to the Yugoslav military and that their bombing was therefore justified.

At the start of May, a NATO aircraft attacked an Albanian refugee [[convoy]], believing it was a Yugoslav military convoy, killing around fifty people. NATO admitted its mistake five days later, but the Serbs accused NATO of deliberately attacking the refugees;{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} however, a later report conducted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]] entitled '''Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia'''&lt;ref name=ICTYReport&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/10052#IVB4|publisher=UNICTY}}&lt;/ref&gt; opined that &quot;civilians were not deliberately attacked in this incident&quot; and that &quot;neither the aircrew nor their commanders displayed the degree of recklessness in failing to take precautionary measures which would sustain criminal charges.&quot; On May 7, [[NATO Bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|NATO bombs hit the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade]], killing three Chinese journalists and outraging Chinese public opinion. The United States and NATO later apologized for the bombing, saying that it occurred because of an outdated map provided by the [[CIA]] although this was challenged by a joint report from ''[[The Observer]]'' (UK) and ''[[Politiken]]'' ([[Denmark]]) newspapers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Kosovo/Story/0,2763,203214,00.html|title=Nato bombed Chinese deliberately|author=John Sweeney, Jens Holsoe, Ed Vulliamy|publisher=The Guardian|date=1999-10-17 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; which claimed that NATO intentionally bombed the embassy because it was being used as a relay station for Yugoslav army radio signals. However the report by the newspaper contradicts findings in the same report by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]] which stated that the root of the failures in target location &quot;appears to stem from the land navigation techniques employed by an intelligence officer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|url=http://www.icty.org/sid/10052#IVB4|publisher=UNICTY|location=Para 82}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In another major incident at the [[Dubrava]]{{disambiguation needed|date=May 2012}} prison in Kosovo, the Yugoslav government attributed 85 civilian deaths to NATO bombing{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} of the facility after NATO cited Serbian and Yugoslav military activity in the area&lt;ref name=HRW&gt;{{cite book|title=Under Orders:War Crimes in Kosovo|publisher=UNHCR|isbn=1564322645|pages=244|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1n8DrZg2rb8C&amp;pg=PA244&amp;lpg=PA244&amp;dq=Dubrava+Prison+massacre&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DDz3m5wShH&amp;sig=ruQx6R7Ux4BTX4BAVDpmxdf8nfM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KrABS9ztJ5L44AbL79mEDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|authorlink=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a [[Human Rights Watch]] reported only at least nineteen ethnic Albanian prisoners killed.&lt;ref name=HRW/&gt;

By the start of April, the conflict seemed little closer to a resolution and NATO countries began to think seriously about a ground operation—an invasion of Kosovo. This would have to be organized very quickly, as there was little time before winter would set in and much work would have to be done to improve the roads from the [[Greece|Greek]] and [[Albania]]n ports to the envisaged invasion routes through [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and northeastern Albania. British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] was a strong advocate of ground forces, pressing for this from the United States; his strong stance caused some alarm in Washington as American forces would be making the largest contribution to any offensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marr, Andrew page 550&quot;&gt;Marr, Andrew; A History of Modern Britain (2008 printing); page 550&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. President Bill Clinton was extremely reluctant to commit American forces for a ground offensive. Instead, Clinton authorized a [[CIA]] operation to look into methods to destabilize the Serbian government without training KLA troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9905/24/kosovo.01/|title=CIA reportedly authorized to develop ways to 'destabilize' Yugoslavian government|work=CNN.com|author=Walter Rodgers, Carl Rochelle and Matthew Chance|date=1999-05-24|accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, [[Finland|Finnish]] and [[Russia]]n diplomatic negotiators continued to try to persuade Milošević to back down. Tony Blair would order 50,000 British soldiers to be made ready for a ground offensive: most of the available [[British Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Marr, Andrew page 550&quot;/&gt; 

Milošević finally recognised that NATO was serious in its resolve to end the conflict one way or another and that Russia would not intervene to defend Serbia despite Moscow's strong anti-NATO rhetoric. Faced with little alternative, Milošević accepted the conditions offered by a Finnish–Russian mediation team and agreed to a military presence within Kosovo headed by the UN, but incorporating NATO troops.

The Norwegian special forces [[Hærens Jegerkommando]] and [[Forsvarets Spesialkommando]] cooperated with the KLA in gathering intelligence information. Preparing for the invasion on June 12, the [[Norway|Norwegian]] special forces sat together with the KLA on the Ramno mountain on the border between Macedonia and Kosovo and had an excellent scouting point for what was happening inside Kosovo. Together with British special forces, Norwegian special forces were the first to cross over the border into Kosovo. According to Keith Graves with the television network Sky News, the Norwegians were already inside Kosovo two days prior to the marching in of other forces and were among the first to enter into Pristina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg.no/nyheter/utenriks/artikkel.php?artid=8665264|title=UCK hjalp norsk spesialstyrke|work=NTB|author=Lise Åserud and Gunnar Nyquist|date=1999-06-21|accessdate=2008-10-08|language = Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hærens Jegerkommando's and Forsvarets Spesialkommando's job was to clear the way between the striding parties and to make local deals to implement the peace deal between the Serbians and the Kosovo Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aftenposten.no/english/local/article254448.ece?service=print|title=Norway has forces in Afghanistan|work=Aftenposten English Web Desk|author=Nina Berglund|date=2002-01-08|accessdate=2008-10-08}} (Mentions work in Kosovo / Pristina)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| author =Tom Bakkeli|title=Norges Hemmelige Krigere / Norway's secret Warriors | isbn = 978-82-489-0722-0 | language = Norwegian |work = Kagge Forlag | year = 2007| accessdate = 2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yugoslav army withdrawal and the entry of KFOR==

On 3 June 1999, Milošević accepted the terms of an international peace plan to end the fighting, with the Serbian parliament adopting the proposal amid contentious debate with delegates coming close to fistfights at some points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9906/03/kosovo.peace.04/ | work=CNN | title=Milosevic accepts peace plan, Finnish envoy says | date=June 3, 1999 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://nytimes.com/1999/06/04/opinion/the-kosovo-peace-plan.html | work=The New York Times | title=The Kosovo Peace Plan | date=June 4, 1999 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 June, the [[North Atlantic Council]] ratified the agreement and suspended air operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title=Press statement by NATO Secretary General | publisher=NATO | date=10 June 1999 | url=http://www.nato.int/kosovo/press/p990610a.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June, after Milošević accepted the conditions, the NATO-led [[NATO peacekeeping|peacekeeping]] [[Kosovo Force]] (KFOR) began entering Kosovo. KFOR had been preparing to conduct combat operations, but in the end, its mission was only peacekeeping. It was based upon the [[Headquarters Allied Command Europe Rapid Reaction Corps|Allied Rapid Reaction Corps]] headquarters commanded by then Lieutenant General [[Mike Jackson]] of the [[British Army]]. It consisted of British forces (a brigade built from 4th Armored and 5th Airborne Brigades), a [[French Army]] Brigade, a [[German Army]] brigade, which entered from the west while all the other forces advanced from the south, and [[Italian Army]] and [[United States Army]] brigades. The U.S. contribution, known as the Initial Entry Force, was led by the 1st Armored Division which was spearheaded by a platoon from the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment attached to the British Forces. Subordinate units included TF 1–35 Armor from Baumholder, Germany, the 2nd Battalion, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, the [[26th Marine Expeditionary Unit]] from [[Camp Lejeune]], [[North Carolina]], the 1st Battalion, 26th Infantry Regiment from Schweinfurt, Germany, and Echo Troop, 4th Cavalry Regiment, also from Schweinfurt, Germany. Also attached to the U.S. force was the [[Greek Army]]'s 501st Mechanized Infantry Battalion. The initial U.S. forces established their area of operation around the towns of Uroševac, the future [[Camp Bondsteel]], and Gnjilane, at [[Camp Monteith]], and spent four months—the start of a stay which continues to date—establishing order in the southeast sector of Kosovo.

During the initial incursion, the U.S. soldiers were greeted by Albanians cheering and throwing flowers as U.S. soldiers and KFOR rolled through their villages. Although no resistance was met, three U.S. soldiers from the Initial Entry Force lost their lives in accidents.&lt;ref&gt;Sergeant William Wright&amp;nbsp;— B Company 9th Engineers (17 July 1999); Specialist Sherwood Brim&amp;nbsp;— B Company 9th Engineers (17 July 1999); Private First Class Benjamin McGill&amp;nbsp;— C Company 1st Battalion 26th Infantry (5 August 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 October 1999, approximately 150 paratroopers from Alpha Company, 1/508th Airborne Battalion Combat Team from Vicenza, Italy parachuted into Ferizaj, Kosovo as part of Operation Rapid Guardian.  The purpose of the mission was primarily to warn then Serbian President Slobodan Milošević of NATO resolve and of its rapid military capability.  One U.S. soldier, Army Ranger Sgt. Jason Neil Pringle, was killed during operations after his parachute failed to deploy.  The paratroopers of the 1/508th then joined paratroopers of the 82nd Airborne and K.F.O.R. in patrolling various areas of Kosovo, without incident, through 3 October 1999.    

Following the military campaign, the involvement of Russian peacekeepers proved to be tense and challenging to the NATO Kosovo force. The Russians expected to have an independent sector of Kosovo, only to be unhappily surprised with the prospect of operating under NATO command. Without prior communication or coordination with NATO, Russian peacekeeping forces entered Kosovo from [[Bosnia]] and seized [[Pristina International Airport]].

In 2010, [[James Blunt]] described in an interview how his unit was given the assignment of securing Pristina during the advance of the 30,000-strong peacekeeping force and how the Russian army had moved in and taken control of the city's airport before his unit's arrival. As the first officer on the scene, Blunt shared a part in the difficult task of addressing the potentially violent international incident. According to Blunt's account, verified by [[General Sir Mike Jackson|General Mike Jackson]], there was a stand-off with the Russians, and the NATO Supreme Commander, US [[General Wesley Clark]], gave orders to over-power them. Whilst these were questioned by Blunt, they were rejected by General Jackson, with the now famous line, &quot;I'm not having my soldiers responsible for starting World War III.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Singer James Blunt 'prevented World War III'|publisher=BBC|date=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, in June 2000, arms trading relations between Russia and Serbia were exposed which lead to the retaliation and bombings of Russian Checkpoints and area Police Stations. [[Outpost Gunner]] was established on a high point in the Preševo Valley by Echo Battery 1/161 Field Artillery in an attempt to monitor and assist with peacekeeping efforts in the Russian Sector. Operating under the support of 2/3 Field Artillery, 1st Armored Division, the Battery was able to successfully deploy and continuously operate a Firefinder Radar which allowed the NATO forces to keep a closer watch on activities in the Sector and the Preševo Valley. Eventually a deal was struck whereby Russian forces operated as a unit of KFOR but not under the NATO command structure.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-airport&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/671495.stm|title=Confrontation over Pristina airport|accessdate=2008-02-08|date=2000-03-09|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction to the war==

===Support for the war===
Support for the Kosovan War and, in particular, the [[Legitimacy of NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|legitimacy of NATO's bombing campaign]] came from a variety of sources. Every member of NATO, every EU country, and all of Serbia's neighbours, supported military action&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; with statements from the leaders of [[United States|Bill Clinton]], [[Czech Republic|Václav Havel]] and [[United Kingdom|Tony Blair]] respectively describing the war as, &quot;an attack by tanks and artillery on a largely defenseless people whose leaders already have agreed to peace,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clinton|first=Bill|title=Statement on Kosovo (March 24, 1999)|url=http://millercenter.org/president/speeches/detail/3932|publisher=Miller Center at the University of Virginia}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;the first war for values&quot;&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last=Clark|first=David|title=Kosovo was a just war, not an imperialist dress rehearsal|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2009/apr/16/clark-kosovo-war-crimes|newspaper=The Guardian|date=16 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one &quot;to avert what would otherwise be a humanitarian disaster in Kosovo.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blair|first=Tony|title=Blair: 'We must act - to save thousands of innocent men, women and children'|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/1999/mar/23/balkans.tonyblair|newspaper=The Guardian|date=Tuesday 23 March 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others included the then U.N. Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] who was reported by some sources as acknowledging that the NATO action was legitimate&lt;ref name=CAForces&gt;{{cite journal|last=Legault|first=Albert|title=NATO INTERVENTION IN KOSOVO: THE LEGAL CONTEXT*|journal=Canadian Military Journal|year=2000|month=Spring|pages=64|url=http://www.journal.forces.gc.ca/vo1/no1/doc/63-66-eng.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; who emphasised that there were times when the use of force was legitimate in the pursuit of peace&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news|last=Devenport|first=Mark|title=Kofi Annan's delicate balance|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1999/03/99/kosovo_strikes/318104.stm|newspaper=BBC|date=April 13, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Kofi Annan|Annan]] stressed that the &quot;Council should have been involved in any decision to use force.&quot;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt; The distinction between the legality and legitimacy of the intervention was further highlighted in two separate reports: one conducted by the Independent International Commission on Kosovo entitled '''The Kosovo Report'''&lt;ref name=KosovoReport&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kosovo Report|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/drwcasebook/files/the_kosovo_report_and_update.pdf|publisher=U Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; which found that, &quot;the NATO military intervention was illegal but legitimate&quot;,&lt;ref name=UMich&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kosovo Report|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/drwcasebook/files/the_kosovo_report_and_update.pdf|publisher=U Michigan|pages=2–3, 58–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second published by the NATO Office of Information and Press&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kumbaro|first=Dajena|title=THE KOSOVO CRISIS IN AN INTERNATIONAL LAW PERSPECTIVE: SELF-DETERMINATION,  TERRITORIAL INTEGRITY AND THE NATO INTERVENTION|url=http://www.nato.int/acad/fellow/99-01/kumbaro.pdf|publisher=NATO Office of Information and Press|date=16|month=JUNE|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; which reported that, &quot;the human rights violations committed on  a large scale in Kosovo provide an

Aside from politicians and diplomats, commentators and intellectuals also supported the war. [[Michael Ignatieff]] called NATOs intervention a &quot;morally justifiable response to ethnic cleansing and the resulting flood of refugees, and not the cause of the flood of refugees&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mellon|first=James G.|title=Review Essays: Ethics, Diplomacy and Intervention in Kosovo|journal=Journal of Conflict Studies|year=2001|month=Winter|volume=XXI|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Christopher Hitchens]] said NATO intervened only, &quot;when Serbian forces had resorted to mass deportation and full-dress ethnic &quot;cleansing.&quot;&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hitchens|first=Christopher|title=South Ossetia Isn't Kosovo|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2008/08/south_ossetia_isnt_kosovo.html|newspaper=Slate|date=Aug. 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in [[The Nation]], [[Richard A. Falk]] wrote that, &quot;the NATO campaign achieved the removal of Yugoslav military forces from Kosovo and, even more significant, the departure of the dreaded Serbian paramilitary units and police&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Falk|first=Richard|title=Kosovo Revisited|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/kosovo-revisited|newspaper=The Nation|date=March 22, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; while an article in [[The Guardian]] wrote that for [[Mary Kaldor]], Kosovo represented a laboratory on her thinking for human security, humanitarian intervention and international peacekeeping, the latter two which she defined as, &quot;a genuine belief in the equality of all human beings; and this entails a readiness to risk lives of peacekeeping troops to save the lives of others where this is necessary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tran|first=Mark|title='The international community makes a terrible mess wherever it goes'|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/apr/01/mary.kaldor.interview|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of the case for war===
Some criticized the NATO intervention as a political diversionary tactic, coming as it did on the heels of the [[Monica Lewinsky scandal]]. Some support for this hypothesis may be found in the fact that coverage of the bombing directly replaced coverage of the [[Monica Lewinsky scandal]] in American news cycles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foerstel&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=HorHFYH0NsoC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;lpg=PA132&amp;dq=Who+tied+the+lewinski+scandal+to+the+Kosovo+war?&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fbLzfRczrr&amp;sig=MkE8rIfEEy2EyPqFuwngtmSojxs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=qx47TYXbKY36swOA_bzVAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false From Watergate to Monicagate: ten controversies in modern journalism and media] By Herbert N. Foerstel, pg 131–135.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some point out that before the bombing, rather than there being an unusually bloody conflict, the KLA was not engaged in a widespread civil war against Yugoslav forces and the death toll among all concerned (including ethnic Albanians) skyrocketed after the NATO intervention.;&lt;ref name=&quot;Foerstel&quot; /&gt; the absence of war did not mean the presence of peace between [[Albanians]] and [[Serbians]] however as other sources have noted including: the murder of 1500 Albanians and displacement of 270,000 before the NATO intervention&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt; and the systematic repression of the Albanian population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kosovo Report|url=http://sitemaker.umich.edu/drwcasebook/files/the_kosovo_report_and_update.pdf|publisher=U Michigan|pages=12–13, 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; through constitutional changes by the Milosevic&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|title=Milosevic accused of 'apartheid'|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2002-02-18/world/milosevic.address_1_yugoslav-leader-mahmut-bakalli-kosovar-albanians?_s=PM:WORLD|newspaper=CNN|date=February 18, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; regime that imposed an &quot;apartheid&quot; in Kosovo.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Horrors of Kosovo revealed|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/551875.stm|newspaper=BBC|date=Monday, 6 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many{{quantify|date=September 2012}} on the left of Western politics saw the NATO campaign as U.S. aggression and imperialism, while critics on the right considered it irrelevant to their countries' national security interests. [[Noam Chomsky]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/199906140008 Is this really a grand NATO victory?], Noam Chomsky, New Statesman, June 14, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; [[Edward Said]]{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} and [[Tariq Ali]]{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} were prominent in opposing the campaign. However, in comparison with the anti-war protests against the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], the campaign against the war in Kosovo aroused much less public support.

A number of critics have emerged since the end of the war. They have accused the coalition of leading a war in Kosovo under the false pretense of [[genocide]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} U.S. President Clinton and his administration were accused of inflating the number of [[Kosovo|Kosovo Albanians]] killed by Serbians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Phyllis Schlafly|date=1999-10-19|url=|title=Numbers Game in Kosovo|publisher=[[Washington Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
After the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade, Chinese Premier Jiang Zemin said that the US was using its economic and military superiority to aggressively expand its influence and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. Chinese leaders called the NATO campaign a dangerous precedent of naked aggression, a new form of colonialism, and an aggressive war groundless in morality or law. It was seen as part of a plot by the US to destroy Yugoslavia, expand eastward and control all of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kzNFT_7HcR4C&amp;pg=PA148&amp;dq=Interfere+Bosnia+internal+affairs+NATO&amp;sig=ACfU3U2pRGEayFd2PsgXEitUtKrPdqQ2bA |title=Brian Frderking, The United States and the Security Council |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Charter does not allow military interventions in other sovereign countries with few exceptions which, in general, need to be decided upon by the United Nations Security Council; this legal enjoinment has proved controversial with  many&lt;ref name=CAForces/&gt;&lt;ref name=KosovoReport/&gt;&lt;ref name=UMich/&gt; legal scholars who argue that though the Kosovo War illegal, it was still legitimate.  The issue was brought before the UN Security Council by Russia, in a draft resolution which, ''inter alia'', would affirm &quot;that such unilateral use of force constitutes a flagrant violation of the United Nations Charter&quot;. China, Namibia, and Russia voted for the resolution, the other members against, thus it failed to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/1999/19990326.sc6659.html|date=1999-03-26|publisher=United Nations|title=Security Council Rejects Demand for Cessation of Use of Force Against Federal Republic of Yugoslavia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war inflicted many casualties. Already by March 1999, the combination of fighting and the targeting of civilians had left an estimated 1,500–2,000 civilians and combatants dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRW1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2001/kosovo/undword-03.htm|title=Under Orders: War Crimes in Kosovo|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Final estimates of the casualties are still unavailable for either side.

The war was also controversial{{by whom|date=September 2012}} because of the choice of targets NATO engaged. The destruction of bridges over the Danube greatly disrupted shipping on the river for months afterwards, causing serious economic damage to countries along the length of the river.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} Moreover, only state-owned factories were targeted, leading critics{{quantify|date=September 2012}} to suspect that the bombing campaign was partly designed to prepare the way for a free market-based reconstruction by wealthy foreign powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pilger|date=2004-12-13|publisher=[[New Statesman]]|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200412130010|title=John Pilger reminds us of Kosovo}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps the most controversial deliberate attack of the war was that made against the headquarters of Serbian television on April 23, which killed at least fourteen people. NATO justified the attack on the grounds that the Serbian television headquarters was part of the Milošević regime's &quot;propaganda machine&quot; and opponents of Milošević inside Serbia charged that the managers of the state TV station had been forewarned of the attack but ordered staff to remain inside the building despite an air raid alert; a later report conducted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]] entitled '''Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia''' opined that, &quot;Insofar as the attack actually was aimed at disrupting the communications network, it was legally acceptable&quot; and that, &quot;NATO’s targeting of the RTS building for propaganda purposes was an incidental (albeit complementary) aim of its primary goal of disabling the Serbian military command and control system and to destroy the nerve system and apparatus that keeps Milosević in power.&quot;&lt;ref name=ICTYReport/&gt; In regards to civilian casualties, it further stated that though they were, &quot;unfortunately high, they do not appear to be clearly disproportionate.&quot;&lt;ref name=ICTYReport/&gt;

==Casualties==

===Civilian losses===
In June 2000, the [[Red Cross]] reported that 3,368 civilians (2,500 Albanians, 400 Serbs, and 100 Roma) were still missing, nearly one year after the conflict.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-missing&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/781310.stm|publisher=BBC|title=3,000 missing in Kosovo|date=2000-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Clarify|date=January 2010}}

A study by researchers from the [[Center for Disease Control and Prevention]] in [[Atlanta]], Georgia published in 2000 in medical journal [[the Lancet]] estimated that &quot;12,000 deaths in the total population&quot; could be attributed to war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdf.thelancet.com/pdfdownload?uid=llan.355.9222.original_research.1004.1&amp;x=x.pdf|format=PDF|title=Casualties in Kosovo|publisher=[[The Lancet]]|date=2000-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number was achieved by surveying 1,197 households from February 1998 through June 1999. 67 out of the 105 deaths reported in the sample population were attributed to war-related [[Physical trauma|trauma]], which extrapolates to be 12,000 deaths if the same war-related mortality rate is applied to Kosovo's total population. The highest mortality rates were in men between 15 and 49 (5,421 victims of war) as well as for men over 50 (5,176 victims). For persons younger than 15, the estimates were 160 victims for males and 200 for females.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} For women between 15–49 the estimate is that there were 510 victims; older than 50 years the estimate is 541 victims. The authors stated that it is not &quot;possible to differentiate completely between civilian and military casualties&quot;.

In the 2008 joint study by the Humanitarian Law Center (an NGO from Serbia and Kosovo), The International Commission on Missing Person, and the Missing Person Commission of Serbia made a name-by-name list of war and post-war victims. According to the Kosovo Memory Book, 13,421 people were killed in Kosovo during the conflict, from 1 January 1998 up until December 2000. Of that sum, 10,533 were Albanians, 2,238 were Serbs, 126 Roma, 100 Bosniaks and others.&lt;ref name=kosovomemorybook&gt;{{cite web| publisher=The Kosovo Memory Book| url=http://www.kosovomemorybook.org/?page_id=2884&amp;lang=de| title=Public review of data on victims, killed and missing – Presentation in Belgrade| accessdate=21 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civilians killed by NATO airstrikes====
{{Main|Civilian casualties during Operation Allied Force}}

Yugoslavia claimed that NATO attacks caused between 1,200 and 5,700 civilian casualties. NATO's Secretary General, Lord Robertson, wrote after the war that &quot;the actual toll in human lives will never be precisely known&quot; but he then offered the figures found in a report by  [[Human Rights Watch]] as a reasonable estimate. This report counted between 488 and 527 civilian deaths (90 to 150 of them killed from cluster bomb use) in 90 separate incidents, the worst of which were the 87 Albanian refugees who perished at the hands of NATO bombs, near Koriša.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nato.int/kosovo/repo2000/conduct.htm#TopOfPage|title=Kosovo One Year On: Achievement and Challenge, by Lord Robertson of Port Ellen, Secretary General of NATO|publisher=[[NATO]]|month=March|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Attacks in Kosovo overall were more deadly due to the confused situation with many refugee movements— the one-third of the incidents there account for more than half of the deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/2000/nato/index.htm#TopOfPage|title=Civilian Deaths in the NATO Air Campaign|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|month=February|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civilians killed by Yugoslav forces====

Various estimates of the number of killings attributed to Yugoslav forces have been announced through the years.

The estimate of 10,000 deaths is used by the [[United States Department of State]], which cited human rights abuses as its main justification for attacking Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=&quot;state.gov-ethnic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/www/global/human_rights/kosovoii/homepage.html|title=Ethnic Cleansing in Kosovo: An Accounting|publisher=[[U.S. Department of State]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statistical experts working on behalf of the [[ICTY]] prosecution estimate that the total number of dead is about 10,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shr.aaas.org/kosovo/icty_report.pdf|format=PDF|title=Killings and Refugee Flow in Kosovo|date=2002-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Fruits, a professor at Portland State University, argued that the experts' analyses were based on fundamentally flawed data and that none of its conclusions are supported by any valid statistical analysis or tests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdx.academia.edu/documents/0035/5846/ICTY_Fruits_expert_report_final_080203.pdf Expert Report to the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Milutinovic et al., Case No. IT-05-87 PT]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Military casualties on the [[NATO]] side were light. According to official reports, the alliance suffered no fatalities as a result of combat operations. However, in the early hours of May 5, an American military [[AH-64 Apache]] helicopter crashed not far from the border between Serbia and Albania.&lt;ref name=&quot;NATOlosses&quot;&gt;[http://www.aeronautics.ru/official/losthelicopters.htm Officially confirmed/documented NATO helicopter losses]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were other casualties after the war, mostly due to land mines.

===Yugoslav military losses===

NATO did not release any official casualty estimates. The Yugoslav authorities claimed 462 soldiers were killed and 299 wounded by NATO airstrikes.&lt;ref name=&quot;syzlgikbtgfzp1999&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=-OhPTJn8ZWoC&amp;pg=PA323&amp;lpg=PA323&amp;dq=civilian+deaths+in+1999+bombing|title=The Kosovo Conflict and International Law: An Analytical Documentation 1974–1999|first=Heike|last=Krieger|accessdate=2009-04-19|page=323|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80071-6|year=2001|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The names of Yugoslav casualties were recorded in a &quot;book of remembrance&quot;.

Of military equipment, NATO destroyed around 50 Yugoslav aircraft including 6 MiG-29s destroyed in air-to-air combat. A number of G-4 Super Galebs were destroyed in their hardened aircraft shelter by bunker-busting bombs which started a fire which spread quickly because the shelter doors were not closed. At the end of war, NATO officially claimed that they had destroyed 93 Yugoslav tanks. Yugoslavia admitted a total of 3 destroyed tanks. The latter figure was verified by European inspectors when Yugoslavia rejoined the Dayton accords, by noting the difference between the number of tanks then and at the last inspection in 1995. NATO claimed that the Yugoslav army lost 93 tanks ([[M-84]]'s and [[T-55]]'s), 132 APCs, and 52 artillery pieces.&lt;ref name=&quot;one-six-one.fifthinfantrydivision.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://one-six-one.fifthinfantrydivision.com/airpwr.htm |title=Kosovo Coverup |publisher=One-six-one.fifthinfantrydivision.com |date=2000-05-15 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Newsweek]], the second-largest news weekly magazine in the U.S, gained access to a suppressed US Air Force report that claimed the real numbers were &quot;3 tanks, not 120; 18 armored personnel carriers, not 220; 20 artillery pieces, not 450&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;one-six-one.fifthinfantrydivision.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Kosovo Cover-Up&quot; by John Barry and Evan Thomas, ''Newsweek'', May 15, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the targets hit in Kosovo were decoys, such as tanks made out of plastic sheets with telegraph poles for gun barrels, or old World War II–era tanks which were not functional. Anti-aircraft defences were preserved by the simple expedient of not turning them on, preventing NATO aircraft from detecting them, but forcing them to keep above a ceiling of 15,000 feet (5,000&amp;nbsp;m), making accurate bombing much more difficult. Towards the end of the war, it was claimed that carpet bombing by [[B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] aircraft had caused huge casualties among Yugoslav troops stationed along the Kosovo–Albania border. Careful searching by NATO investigators found no evidence of any such large-scale casualties.

However, the most significant loss for the [[Yugoslav Army]] was the damaged and destroyed infrastructure. Almost all military air bases and airfields ([[Batajnica Air Base|Batajnica]], [[Kraljevo-Lađevci Airport|Lađevci]], [[Slatina Air Base|Slatina]], [[Golubovci Air Base|Golubovci]], [[Kovin Airport|Kovin]], and [[Đakovica Airfield|Đakovica]]) and other military buildings and facilities were badly damaged or destroyed. Unlike the units and their equipment, military buildings couldn't be camouflaged. thus, defence industry and military technical overhaul facilities were also seriously damaged ([[Utva]], [[Zastava Arms]] factory, Moma Stanojlović air force overhaul center, technical overhaul centers in [[Čačak]] and [[Kragujevac]]). Moreover, in an effort to weaken the Yugoslav Army, NATO targeted several important civilian facilities (the [[Pančevo]] oil refinery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbudbill.com/jme14.html|title=NATO BOMBS LEAVE TOXIC SLOUGH|publisher=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; bridges, TV antennas, railroads, etc.)

===KLA losses===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}
Kosovo Liberation Army losses are difficult to analyze. According to some reports there were around 1,000&lt;ref name=&quot;antiwar.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antiwar.com/malic/?articleid=13083 |title=The War Street Journal Invents Kosovo (KLA casualties) |publisher=Antiwar.com |date=2008-07-04 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; fatalities on the KLA side. Difficulties arise in calculating an accurate figure. Things are complicated by the difficulty of determining who was a KLA member and who was a civilian. For example, the Yugoslavs considered any armed Albanian to be a member of the KLA, regardless of whether he was officially a card-carrying member, so someone who is counted as a civilian by the Albanian side might be counted as a KLA combatant by the [[Serbs]]. Also, many KLA members were not wearing any uniforms and had no identification.

===Aftermath===
[[File:Refugee camp in Albania.jpg|thumb|right|Refugee camp in [[Fier]], Albania]]

Within three weeks, over 500,000 Albanian [[refugees]] had returned home.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} By November 1999, according to the [[UNHCR|UN High Commissioner for Refugees]], 848,100 out of 1,108,913 had returned.

During the war, 90,000 [[Serbs in Kosovo|Serbs]] fled from Kosovo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2004/03/18/serbia8129.htm|title=Kosovo/Serbia: Protect Minorities from Ethnic Violence|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yugoslav [[Red Cross]] had also registered 247,391 mostly Serbian refugees by November. The persistent anti-Serb attacks and riots, including against other non-Albanians, had remained in the anarchic stage until some form of order was established in 2001. This order disintegrated during the 2004 pogrom against non Albanians. More than 164,000 Serbs have left Kosovo during the seven weeks since Yugoslav and Serb forces withdrew and the NATO-led Kosovo Force (KFOR) entered the province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/1999/08/01/abuses-against-serbs-and-roma-new-kosovo Abuses against Serbs and Roma in the New Kosovo], Human rights watch&lt;/ref&gt;

==War crimes==
{{Main|War crimes in Kosovo}}

===Serbian war crimes===
{{Main|Serbian war crimes in the Yugoslav Wars}}
The [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] charged Milošević with [[crimes against humanity]], violating the [[laws or customs of war]], grave breaches of the [[Geneva Conventions]] and [[genocide]] for his role during the wars in [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]], and Kosovo.

Before the end of the bombing, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milošević, along with Milan Milutinović, [[Nikola Šainović]], [[Dragoljub Ojdanić]] and [[Vlajko Stojiljković]] were charged by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) with crimes against humanity including murder, forcible transfer, deportation, and &quot;persecution on political, racial or religious grounds&quot;.

Further indictments were leveled in October 2003 against former armed forces chief of staff [[Nebojša Pavković]], former army corps commander [[Vladimir Lazarević]], former police official [[Vlastimir Đorđević]], and the current head of Serbia's public security, [[Sreten Lukić]]. All were indicted for crimes against humanity and violations of the laws or customs of war.

War crimes prosecutions have also been carried out in Yugoslavia. Yugoslav soldier [[Ivan Nikolić]] was found guilty in 2002 of war crimes in the deaths of two civilians in Kosovo. A significant number of Yugoslav soldiers were tried by Yugoslav military tribunals during the war.

===Albanian war crimes===
The ICTY also leveled indictments against KLA members [[Fatmir Limaj]], [[Haradin Bala]], [[Isak Musliu]], and [[Agim Murtezi]] for crimes against humanity. They were arrested on February 17 and 18, 2003. Charges were soon dropped against Agim Murtezi as a case of mistaken identity, whereas Fatmir Limaj was acquitted of all charges on November 30, 2005 and released. The charges were in relation to the prison camp run by the defendants at [[Lapušnik prison camp|Lapušnik]] between May and July 1998.

In 2008, [[Carla Del Ponte]] published a book in which she alleged that, after the end of the war in 1999, Kosovo Albanians were smuggling organs of between 100 and 300 Serbs and other minorities from the province to Albania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Champion |first=Marc |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB120812796372611429.html?mod=googlenews_wsj |title=Organ smuggling in Wall Street Journal |publisher=Online.wsj.com |date=2008-04-14 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICTY and the Serbian War Crimes Tribunal are currently investigating these allegations, as numerous witnesses and new materials have recently emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/flash-actu/2008/04/16/01011-20080416FILWWW00481-trafic-d-organeskosovo-aucune-trace.php |title=Le Figaro&amp;nbsp;– Flash actu : trafic d'organes/Kosovo: '&amp;#39;aucune trace'&amp;#39; |publisher=Lefigaro.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2012}}

On March 2005, a U.N. tribunal indicted Kosovo Prime Minister [[Ramush Haradinaj]] for war crimes against the Serbs. On March 8, he tendered his resignation. Haradinaj, an ethnic Albanian, was a former commander who led units of the Kosovo Liberation Army and was appointed Prime Minister after winning an election of 72 votes to three in the Kosovo's Parliament in December 2004. Haradinaj was acquitted on all counts. The Office of the Prosecutor has appealed his acquittal, and as of July 2008, the matter remains unresolved.

===NATO war crimes===
The Yugoslav government and a number of international pressure groups (e.g. [[Amnesty International]]) claimed that NATO had carried out war crimes during the conflict, notably the bombing of the Serbian TV headquarters in Belgrade on April 23, 1999, where 16 people were killed and 16 more were injured. Sian Jones of Amnesty stated, &quot;The bombing of the headquarters of Serbian state radio and television was a deliberate attack on a civilian object and as such constitutes a war crime&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iI-Ix5tQ59McTX8NyBF1R120X4dAD97O8IRO0 Amnesty: NATO bombing of Serbian TV 'war crime']{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However,  a later report conducted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]] entitled '''Final Report to the Prosecutor by the Committee Established to Review the NATO Bombing Campaign Against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia''' sided with NATO's version of the attack, opining that, &quot;Insofar as the attack actually was aimed at disrupting the communications network, it was legally acceptable&quot; and that, &quot;NATO’s targeting of the RTS building for propaganda purposes was an incidental (albeit complementary) aim of its primary goal of disabling the Serbian military command and control system and to destroy the nerve system and apparatus that keeps Milosević in power.&quot;&lt;ref name=ICTYReport/&gt; In regards to civilian casualties, it further stated that though they were, &quot;unfortunately high, they do not appear to be clearly disproportionate.&quot;&lt;ref name=ICTYReport/&gt; Activist/Writer Noam Chomsky claims this is inaccurate as the mass exodus of civilians did not occur until after the NATO bombing, and in his view NATO acted without the support of the United Nations and therefore this constitutes a war crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://iraqwar.org/germanreport.htm].&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify credibility|date=September 2012}}

==Military and political consequences==

[[File:Kla members.jpg|thumb|Members of the Kosovo Liberation Army turn over their weapons to U.S. Marines]]

{{Main|Kosovo status process|Constitutional status of Kosovo}}
The Kosovo war had a number of important consequences in terms of the military and political outcome. The status of Kosovo remains unresolved; international negotiations began in 2006 to determine the level of autonomy Kosovo would have, as envisaged under [[UN Security Council Resolution 1244]], but failed. The province is administered by the United Nations despite its [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|unilateral declaration of independence]] on February 17, 2008.

The UN-backed talks, led by UN Special Envoy [[Martti Ahtisaari]], had begun in February 2006. Whilst progress was made on technical matters, both parties remained diametrically opposed on the question of status itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6034567.stm|title=UN frustrated by Kosovo deadlock|publisher=BBC|date=2006-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, Ahtisaari delivered a draft status settlement proposal to leaders in Belgrade and Pristina, the basis for a draft UN Security Council Resolution which proposes &quot;supervised independence&quot; for the province, which is in contrary to UN Security Council Resolution 1244. By July 2007, the draft resolution, which was backed by the United States, United Kingdom, and other European members of the [[Security Council]], had been rewritten four times to try to accommodate Russian concerns that such a resolution would undermine the principle of state sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/06/29/nb-07|title=Russia reportedly rejects fourth draft resolution on Kosovo status|date=2007-06-29|publisher=[[Southeast European Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia, which holds a veto in the Security Council as one of [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|five permanent members]], stated that it would not support any resolution which is not acceptable to both Belgrade and Priština.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2007/07/10/nb-02|title=UN Security Council remains divided on Kosovo|date=2007-10-07|publisher=[[Southeast European Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign exposed significant weaknesses in the U.S. arsenal, which were later addressed for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq]] campaigns. [[AH-64 Apache|Apache attack helicopters]] and [[AC-130 Spectre]] gunships were brought up to the front lines but were never actually used after two Apaches crashed during training in the Albanian mountains. Stocks of many precision missiles were run down to critically low levels; had the campaign lasted much longer, NATO would have had to revert back to using &quot;dumb&quot; bombs for lack of anything better. The situation was not any better with the combat aircraft; continuous operations meant skipped maintenance schedules and many aircraft were withdrawn from service awaiting spare parts and service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeronautics.ru/nws002/theobserver04.htm|title=Hundreds of crippled jets put RAF in crisis|author=Antony Barnett|date=2000-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, many of the precision-guided weapons proved unable to cope with Balkan weather, as the clouds blocked the laser guidance beams. This was resolved by retrofitting bombs with [[Global Positioning System]] satellite guidance devices that are immune to bad weather. Also, although [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|pilotless surveillance aircraft]] were extensively used, it often proved the case that attack aircraft could not be brought to the scene quickly enough to hit targets of opportunity. This led to the fitting of missiles to Predator drones in Afghanistan, reducing the &quot;sensor to shooter&quot; time to virtually nothing.

Kosovo also demonstrated that even a high-tech force such as NATO could be thwarted by simple tactics, according to [[Wesley Clark]] and other NATO generals who analyzed these tactics a few years after the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/front/RTGAM/20021120/wless1120/Front/homeBN/breakingnews|title=NATO attack on Yugoslavia gave Iraq good lessons|publisher=[[Globe and Mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Yugoslav army had long expected to need to resist a much stronger enemy, either [[Red Army|Soviet]] or NATO, during the [[Cold War]] and had developed effective tactics of deception and concealment in response. These would have been unlikely to have resisted a full-scale invasion for long, but were probably effective in misleading overflying aircraft and satellites. Among the tactics used were:
* U.S. stealth aircraft were tracked with radars operating on long wavelengths. If stealth jets got wet or opened their bomb bay doors they would become visible on the radar screens. An [[F-117 Nighthawk]] downed with a missile was possibly spotted in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj02/sum02/lambeth.html |title=Kosovo and the Continuing SEAD Challenge |accessdate=May 28, 2011 |author=Benjamin S. Lambeth|date=2006-06-03 |work=Aerospace Power Journal |publisher=[[United States Air Force]]|quote=Serb air defenders could have employed low-frequency radars for the best chance of getting a snap look at the aircraft. Former F-117 pilots and several industry experts acknowledged that the aircraft is detectable by such radars when viewed from the side or directly below.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Precision-guided missiles were often confused and unable to pinpoint radars, because radar beams were reflected off heavy farm machinery like old tractors and plows.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}
* Many low-tech approaches were used to confuse heat-seeking missiles and infrared sensors. Decoys such as small gas furnaces were used to simulate nonexistent positions on mountainsides.
* Dummy targets were used very extensively. Fake bridges, airfields and decoy planes and tanks were used. Tanks were made using old tires, plastic sheeting and logs, and sand cans and fuel set alight to mimic heat emissions. They fooled NATO pilots into bombing hundreds of such decoys, though General Clark's survey found that in Operation: Allied Force, NATO airmen hit just 25 decoys—an insignificant percentage of the 974 validated hits.&lt;ref name=&quot;fooled&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afa.org/magazine/june2000/0600kosovo.asp|month=June|year=2000|title=Nine Myths About Kosovo|author=Rebecca Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[NATO]] sources claim that this was due to operating procedures, which oblige troops, in this case aircraft, to engage any and all targets, however unlikely they may be. The targets needed only to look real to be shot at, if detected, of course. NATO claimed that Yugoslav air force had been devastated. &quot;Official data show that the Yugoslav army in Kosovo lost 26 percent of its tanks, 34 percent of its APCs, and 47 percent of the artillery to the air campaign.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fooled&quot;/&gt;
* Old electronic jammers were used to block U.S. bombs equipped with satellite guidance.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}
* [[Hispano-Suiza]] anti-aircraft cannon from the [[World War II]] era was used once effectively against slow-flying drone aircraft.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Military decorations==
As a result of the Kosovo War, the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation created a second NATO medal, the [[NATO Medal]] for Kosovo Service, an [[international military decoration]]. Shortly thereafter, NATO created the Non-Article 5 Medal for Balkans service to combine both Yugoslavian and Kosovo operations into one service medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=2449 |title=News Release: Kosovo Campaign Medal Approved |publisher=Defense.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the involvement of the [[United States armed forces]], a separate [[awards and decorations of the United States military|U.S. military decoration]], known as the [[Kosovo Campaign Medal]], was established by President [[Bill Clinton]] in 2000.

==Weaponry &amp; Vehicular Units used on all sides==
A variety of weapons were used by the Yugoslav security forces and the Kosovo Liberation Army during the conflict. NATO only operated aircraft and various naval units for the duration of the conflict.

;Yugoslav security forces
The following weapons used by Yugoslav government forces are listed below. Most of them were Yugoslav made weaponry, while almost all of the AA units were Soviet made.

==Literature==
Kosovo, due to its strategical and historical place in the Balkans, has many sources of literature. Some of it is in Albanian due to its predominant ethnic Albanian population and the rest in other languages. There are many books which cover the 1998–1999 Kosovo conflict written by international authors. A few books worthy of mention are:

* ''The Dollar and the Gun'': theme connected, documentary-based short stories, about or inspired by, the Kosovo war, written by novelist and thinker [[Shlomo Kalo]]. Published in Serbia, England, Israel, Greece, Italy, India.
