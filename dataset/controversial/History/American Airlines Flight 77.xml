'''American Airlines Flight 77''' was a [[Airline|passenger flight]] which was [[Aircraft hijacking|hijacked]] by five [[al-Qaeda]] terrorists on September 11, 2001, as part of the [[September 11 attacks]]. They deliberately crashed it into the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] near [[Washington, D.C.]], killing all 59 people on board plus the hijackers, as well as 125 people in the building. The aircraft involved, a [[Boeing 757|Boeing 757-223]], was flying [[American Airlines]]' daily scheduled morning [[transcontinental flight|transcontinental service]] from [[Washington Dulles International Airport]], in [[Dulles, Virginia|Dulles]], Virginia to [[Los Angeles International Airport]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]].

Less than 35&amp;nbsp;minutes into the flight, the hijackers stormed the cockpit and forced the passengers, crew, and pilots to the rear of the aircraft. [[Hani Hanjour]], one of the hijackers who was trained as a pilot, assumed control of the flight. Unknown to the hijackers, passengers aboard were able to make telephone calls to loved ones and relay information on the hijacking.

The aircraft crashed into the western side of the Pentagon at 09:37 [[Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]. Dozens of people witnessed the crash and news sources began reporting on the incident within minutes. The impact severely damaged an area of the Pentagon and caused a large fire. At 10:10AM, a portion of the Pentagon collapsed; firefighters spent days trying to fully extinguish the blaze. The damaged sections of the Pentagon were rebuilt in 2002, with occupants moving back into the completed areas on August 15, 2002.

The 184 victims of the attack are memorialized in the [[Pentagon Memorial]] adjacent to the Pentagon. The {{convert|1.93|acre|m2|sing=on}} park contains a bench for each of the victims, arranged according to their year of birth, ranging from 1930 (age 71) to 1998 (age 3).

== Hijackers ==
The hijackers on American Airlines Flight&amp;nbsp;77 were led by [[Hani Hanjour]], who piloted the aircraft into the Pentagon.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Chen |first=David W |title= A Nation Challenged: The Suspect; Man Traveled Across U.S. In His Quest to Be a Pilot |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F03EFDF153BF93BA2575AC0A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2001-09-18 |accessdate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanjour first came to the United States in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Yardley |first=Jim |coauthors=Thomas, Jo |title= Traces of Terror: The F.B.I.; For Agent in Phoenix, the Cause of Many Frustrations Extended to His Own Office |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE0DD173FF93AA25755C0A9649C8B63 |date=2002-06-19 |work = The New York Times |accessdate=2008-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He trained at the CRM Airline Training Center in [[Scottsdale, Arizona]], earning his [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] [[Commercial Pilot License|commercial pilot's certificate]] in April&amp;nbsp;1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Four Planes, Four Coordinated Teams |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/graphics/attack/hijackers.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |year=2001 |accessdate=2001-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had wanted to be a commercial pilot for the [[Saudi Arabian Airlines|Saudi national airline]] but was rejected when he applied to the civil aviation school in [[Jeddah]] in 1999.

The CIA's unit dedicated to tracking Osama bin Laden, [[Alec Station]], had discovered that two of the other hijackers, al-Hazmi and al-Mihdhar, had multiple entry visas to the United States well before 9/11. Two FBI agents inside the unit tried to alert FBI headquarters, but CIA officers rebuffed them.&lt;ref name=bam1/&gt;

In December 2000, Hanjour arrived in [[San Diego]], joining &quot;muscle&quot; hijackers [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]] and [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]], who had been there since January&amp;nbsp;2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;911 ch7&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Goldstein |first=Amy |title=Hijackers Led Core Group |work = The Washington Post |url=http://www.pulitzer.org/year/2002/national-reporting/works/093001.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080505123208/http://www.pulitzer.org/year/2002/national-reporting/works/093001.html |archivedate=2008-05-05 |date=2001-09-30 |accessdate=2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after arriving, Hanjour and Hazmi left for [[Mesa, Arizona]], where Hanjour began refresher training at Arizona Aviation.&lt;ref name=&quot;911 ch7&quot; /&gt; In April&amp;nbsp;2001, they relocated to [[Falls Church, Virginia]], where they awaited the arrival of the remaining &quot;muscle&quot; hijackers.&lt;ref name=&quot;911 ch7&quot; /&gt; One of these men, [[Majed Moqed]], arrived on May 2, 2001, with Flight&amp;nbsp;175 hijacker [[Ahmed al-Ghamdi]] from [[Dubai]] at [[Dulles International Airport]] and moved into an apartment with Hazmi and Hanjour.&lt;ref name=&quot;travel&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/911_TerrTrav_Ch2.pdf |title=Monograph on 9/11 and Terrorist Travel |chapter=Chronology |publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |page=22 |format=PDF|accessdate=2008-05-25| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080529193648/http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/911_TerrTrav_Ch2.pdf| archivedate= 29 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Suspected accomplices ===

According to U.S. State Department cable of February 2010,  the FBI has investigated another suspect, Mohammed al-Mansoori, who had associated with three Qatari citizens who had flown from Washington to London on the eve of the attacks, after allegedly surveying the World Trade Center and the White House. U.S. law enforcement officials said that the information about the four men was &quot;just one of many leads that were thoroughly investigated at the time and never led to terrorism charges&quot;. An official added, however, that the three Qatari citizens have never been questioned by the FBI. [[Eleanor Hill]], the former staff director for the congressional joint inquiry on the September 11 attacks, said the cable reinforces questions about the thoroughness of the FBI's investigation. She also said that the inquiry concluded that the hijackers had a support network that helped them in different ways. The three Qatari men were booked to fly from Los Angeles to Washington on September 10, 2001, on the same plane that was hijacked and piloted into the Pentagon on the following day, but did instead fly from Los Angeles to Qatar, via London. While the cable states that Mansoori would be currently under investigation, U.S. law enforcement officials said that there was no active investigation of him or of the Qatari citizens mentioned in the cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Isikoff|first=Michael|publisher=MSNBC|title=WikiLeaks cable revives talk of 9/11 support network|date=February 2, 2011|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/41400106/ns/us_news-security/|accessdate=February 18, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110211203506/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/41400106/ns/us_news-security/| archivedate= 11 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Boarding and departure===
On the morning of September 11, 2001, the five hijackers arrived at [[Washington, D.C.]]'s [[Dulles International Airport]]. At 07:15, [[Khalid al-Mihdhar]] and [[Majed Moqed]] checked in at the American Airlines ticket counter for Flight 77,&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |chapter='We Have Some Planes' |url=http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch1.htm |year=2004 |title=9/11 Commission Report |publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |accessdate=2008-05-30| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080514052417/http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report_Ch1.htm| archivedate= 14 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; arriving at the passenger security checkpoint a few minutes later at 07:18.&lt;ref name=&quot;staff3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/staff_statement_3.pdf |format=PDF|title=The Aviation Security System and the 9/11 Attacks - Staff Statement No. 3 |work=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |accessdate=2008-05-30| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080528201527/http://www.9-11commission.gov/staff_statements/staff_statement_3.pdf| archivedate= 28 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both men set off the metal detector and were put through secondary screening.  Moqed continued to set off the alarm, so he was searched with a [[hand wand]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dullesvideo&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0407/21/acd.01.html | title =New Video of 9/11 hijackers at Dulles Airport before attacks |series=Anderson Cooper 360 |network=CNN |airdate=2004-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hazmi brothers checked in together at the ticket counter at 07:29. [[Hani Hanjour]] checked in separately and arrived at the passenger security checkpoint at 07:35.&lt;ref name=&quot;911-notes&quot;/&gt; Hanjour was followed minutes later at the checkpoint by [[Salem al-Hazmi|Salem]] and [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]], who also set off the metal detector's alarm. The screener at the checkpoint never resolved what set off the alarm. As seen in security footage later released, Nawaf Hazmi appeared to have an unidentified item in his back pocket, but four-inch [[utility knife|utility knives]] were nonetheless then permitted by the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) as carry-on items.&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;dullesvideo&quot;/&gt;  The passenger security checkpoint at Dulles International Airport was operated by [[Argenbright Security]], under contract with [[United Airlines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Orecklin |first=Michele |coauthors=Land, Greg |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1001252,00.html |title=Why Argenbright Sets Off Alarms |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=2001-11-19 |accessdate=2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hijackers were also all selected for extra screening of their checked bags. Hani Hanjour, Khalid al-Mihdhar, and Majed Moqed were chosen by the [[Computer Assisted Passenger Prescreening System]] criteria, while Nawaf al-Hazmi and Salem al-Hazmi were selected because they did not provide adequate identification and were deemed suspicious by the airline check-in agent.  Hanjour, Mihdhar, and Nawaf al-Hazmi did not check any bags for the flight. Checked bags belonging to Moqed and Salem al-Hazmi were held until they boarded the aircraft.&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archives.gov/research/9-11/staff-report-sept2005.pdf |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5T7H27edX |archivedate=2007-11-05 |title=Staff Monograph on the &quot;Four Flights and Civil Aviation Security&quot; |month=September | year=2005 |publisher=National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States |format=PDF |accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 07:50, the five hijackers, carrying knives and box cutters, had made it through the airport security checkpoint.

Flight 77 was scheduled to depart for Los Angeles at 08:10; 58 passengers boarded through Gate D26, including the five hijackers. Excluding the hijackers, of the 59 other passengers and crew on board, there were 26 men, 22 women, and five children ranging in age from three to eleven. On the flight, Hani Hanjour was seated up front in 1B, while Salem and Nawaf al-Hazmi were seated in first class in seats 5E and 5F. Majed Moqed and Khalid al-Mihdhar were seated further back in 12A and 12B, in economy class.&lt;ref name=&quot;Summary&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vaed.uscourts.gov/notablecases/moussaoui/exhibits/prosecution/flights/P200054.html |title=Summary of Flight 77 |publisher=[[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia]] |accessdate=2007-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flight 77 left the gate on time and took off from Runway 30 at Dulles at {{Nowrap|8:20 am}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;four&quot;/&gt;

=== Hijacking ===
The [[9/11 Commission]] estimated that the flight was hijacked between 08:51 and 08:54, shortly after [[American Airlines Flight 11]] struck the [[World Trade Center]] and not too long after [[United Airlines Flight 175]] had just been hijacked. The last normal radio communications from the aircraft to [[air traffic control]] occurred at 08:50:51.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gregor |first=Joseph A. |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/foia/9_11/ATC_Report_AA77.pdf |format=PDF|title=ATC Report American Airlines Flight 77 |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |date=2001-12-21 |accessdate=2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the other three flights, there were no reports of anyone being stabbed or a bomb threat. At 08:54, the plane began to deviate from its normal, assigned flight path and turned south.&lt;ref name=&quot;911-ch1&quot;/&gt; The hijackers set the flight's [[autopilot]] heading for Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/info/autopilot_AA77_UA93_study.pdf |format=PDF|title=Study of Autopilot, Navigation Equipment, and Fuel Consumption Activity Based on United Airlines Flight&amp;nbsp;93 and American Airlines Flight&amp;nbsp;77 Digital Flight Data Recorder Information |last=O'Callaghan |first=John |coauthors=Bower, Daniel |publisher=National Transportation Safety Board |date=2002-02-13 |accessdate=2008-06-01}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 08:56, the flight was turned around, and the [[transponder (aviation)|transponder]] had been disabled. The FAA was aware at this point that there was an emergency on board the airplane.

Officials estimated temperatures of up to {{convert|2000|°F|°C}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pent86&quot; /&gt; While progress was made against the interior fires by late afternoon, firefighters realized a flammable layer of wood under the Pentagon's slate roof had caught fire and begun to spread.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pent91&quot;&gt;Goldberg et al., pp. 91–95.&lt;/ref&gt; Typical firefighting tactics were rendered useless by the reinforced structure as firefighters were unable to reach the fire to extinguish it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pent91&quot; /&gt; Firefighters instead made [[firebreak]]s in the roof on September 12 to prevent any further spreading.

=== Cockpit voice recorder ===
[[File:Flight 77 CVR.jpg|right|thumb|A photograph of the [[cockpit voice recorder]] from American Airlines Flight 77, as used in an exhibit at the Moussaoui trial]]
At around 3:40 a.m on September 14, a paramedic and a firefighter who were searching through the debris of the impact site found two dark boxes, about {{convert|1.5|ft|cm}} by {{convert|2|ft|cm}} long. They called for an FBI agent, who in turn called for someone from the [[National Transportation Safety Board]] (NTSB). The NTSB employee confirmed that these were the [[flight recorder|flight recorders (&quot;black boxes&quot;)]] from American Airlines Flight 77.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3069699/ |title=Washington’s Heroes: On the ground at the Pentagon on Sept. 11 |accessdate=2009-11-02 |last=Rosenberg |first=Debra |date=2001-09-28 |publisher=MSNBC |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040526034459/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3069699/ |archivedate=2004-05-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dick Bridges, deputy manager for Arlington County, Virginia, said the voice recorder was damaged on the outside and the flight data recorder was charred. But he said the FBI still was confident the data can be recovered from both. Bridges said the recorders were found &quot;right where the plane came into the building.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Searchers find Pentagon black boxes | date=2001-09-14 | publisher=Gannett Co. Inc. | url =http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2001/09/14/pentagon-fire.htm | work =USA Today | accessdate = 2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials at both American Airlines and United Airlines said the black boxes aboard their destroyed aircraft were modern solid-state versions, which are more resistant to damage than the older magnetic tape recorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= FBI analyzing voice, data recorders from two flights | date=2001-09-15 | publisher=St. Petersburg Times | url =http://www.sptimes.com/News/091501/Worldandnation/FBI_analyzing_voice__.shtml | accessdate = 2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cockpit voice recorder was quickly transported to the NTSB lab in Washington, D.C., and its data was downloaded.  Soon afterward, the FBI took charge of the box and its data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Ray | last=Bert | title=Hearing Voices | date=Spring 2002 | publisher=Worcester Polytechnic Institute | url =http://www.wpi.edu/News/Transformations/2002Spring/hear.html | work =Transformations | accessdate = 2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS News reported that &quot;Preliminary information shows there is nothing that appears to be useful on the cockpit voice tape.

The NTSB reported that &quot;The majority of the recording tape was fused into a solid block of charred plastic.&quot; No usable segments of tape were found inside the recorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Specialist's Factual Report of Investigation: Cockpit Voice Recorder | date=2002-04-30 | url =http://www.scribd.com/doc/14780831/T8-B18-NTSB-Documents-1-of-3-Fdr-CVR-Cockpit-Voice-Recorder-Reports-AA-77-and-UA-93-Paperclipped-Together260 | work =National Transportation Safety Board | accessdate = 2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Continuity of operations ===
At the moment of impact, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] was in his office on the other side of the Pentagon, away from the crash site. He ran to the site and assisted the injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Vobejda |first=Barbara |title='Extensive Casualties' in Wake of Pentagon Attack |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/daily/sep01/attack.html |work=The Washington Post |date=2001-09-11 |accessdate=2008-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumsfeld then returned to his office, and went to a conference room in the Executive Support Center where he joined a secure videoteleconference with Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] and other officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Creed, Patrick and Rick Newman |title=Firefight: Inside the Battle to Save the Pentagon on 9/11 |year=2008 |publisher=Presidio Press |isbn=0-89141-905-5 |pages=276–277}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the day of the attacks, Department of Defense officials considered moving command operations to [[Site R]], a backup facility in [[Pennsylvania]].  Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld insisted he remain at the Pentagon, instead sending Deputy Secretary [[Paul Wolfowitz]] to Site R.

On May 16, 2006, the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] released filmed footage that was recorded by a security camera of American Airlines Flight&amp;nbsp;77 crashing into the Pentagon, with a plane visible in one frame, as a &quot;thin white blur&quot; and an explosion following.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12818225/ |title=Video of 9/11 plane hitting Pentagon is released |publisher=MSNBC |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The images were made public in response to a December 2004 [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request by [[Judicial Watch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Judicial Watch Obtains September 11 Pentagon Video |url=http://www.judicialwatch.org/5772.shtml |publisher=[[Judicial Watch]] |date=2006-05-16 |accessdate=2008-06-11| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080511221056/http://www.judicialwatch.org/5772.shtml| archivedate= 11 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some still images from the video had previously been released and publicly circulated, but this was the first official release of the full video of the crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/03/07/gen.pentagon.pictures/ |title=Images show September 11 Pentagon crash |publisher=CNN |date=2002-03-08 |accessdate=2008-06-11| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080531134018/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/03/07/gen.pentagon.pictures/| archivedate= 31 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A nearby [[Citgo]] service station also had security cameras installed, but a video released on September 15, 2006, did not show the crash because the camera was pointed away from the crash site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.judicialwatch.org/5965.shtml |title=CITGO Gas Station Cameras Near Pentagon Evidently Did Not Capture Attack |date=2006-09-15 |publisher=Judicial Watch |accessdate=2008-06-11| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080501110315/http://www.judicialwatch.org/5965.shtml| archivedate= 1 May 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Videotapes dispel conspiracy; Plane, not missile seen hitting Pentagon on 9/11 |work = The Washington Times |date=2006-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
