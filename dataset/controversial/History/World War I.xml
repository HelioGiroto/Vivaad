'''World War I''' ('''WWI''') was a [[World war|global war]] centred in [[Europe]] that began on 28 July 1914 and lasted until 11 November 1918. It was predominantly called the '''World War''' or the '''Great War''' from its occurrence until the start of [[World War II]] in 1939, and the '''First World War''' or World War I thereafter. It involved all the world's [[great powers]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were assembled in two opposing alliances: the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] (based on the [[Triple Entente]] of the [[United Kingdom]], [[France]] and [[Russia]]) and the [[Central Powers]] (originally centred around the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] of [[Germany]], [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Italy]]; but, as Austria–Hungary had taken the offensive against the agreement, Italy did not enter into the war).&lt;ref name=Willmott15&gt;{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; These alliances both reorganised (Italy fought for the Allies) and expanded as more nations entered the war. Ultimately more than 70&amp;nbsp;million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keegan|1988|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bade|Brown|2003|pp=167–168}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 9&amp;nbsp;million combatants [[World War I casualties|were killed]], largely because of technological advancements that led to enormous increases in the lethality of weapons without corresponding improvements in protection or mobility. It was the sixth-[[List of wars and anthropogenic disasters by death toll|deadliest conflict]] in world history, subsequently paving the way for various political changes such as revolutions in many of the nations involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-term causes of the war included the [[imperialism|imperialistic]] foreign policies of the great powers of Europe, including the [[German Empire]], the [[Austria-Hungary#The Great War|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the [[Ottoman Empire#Dissolution (1908–1922)|Ottoman Empire]], the [[Russian Empire]], the [[British Empire]], the [[French Army in World War I|French Republic]], and [[Italy in World War I#From neutrality to the intervention in the war|Italy]]. The [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassination on 28 June 1914]] of [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], the heir to the throne of [[Austria-Hungary]], by a [[Yugoslav nationalism|Yugoslav nationalist]] in [[Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina]] was the proximate trigger of the war. It resulted in a [[July Ultimatum|Habsburg ultimatum]] against the [[Kingdom of Serbia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AJPT2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|1998|pp=80–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Djokić|2003|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several alliances formed over the previous decades were invoked, so within weeks the major powers were at war; via their colonies, the conflict soon spread around the world.

On 28 July, the conflict opened with the Austro-Hungarian [[Serbian Campaign (World War I)|invasion of Serbia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Evans|2004|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Martel|2003|p=xii ff}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by the German invasion of [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]] and France; and a Russian attack against Germany. After the German march on [[Paris]] was brought to a halt, the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] settled into a static battle of attrition with a [[trench warfare|trench line]] that changed little until 1917. In the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|East]], the Russian army successfully fought against the Austro-Hungarian forces but was forced back from [[East Prussia]] and [[Poland]] by the German army. Additional fronts opened after the Ottoman Empire joined the war in 1914, Italy and [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] in 1915 and [[Romania]] in 1916. The Russian Empire [[Russian Revolution (1917)|collapsed in March 1917]], and Russia left the war after the [[October Revolution]] later that year. After a 1918 German offensive along the western front, the Allies drove back the German armies in a series of successful offensives and [[United States]] forces began entering the trenches. Germany, which had [[German Revolution|its own trouble with revolutionaries]] at this point, agreed to a cease-fire on 11 November 1918, later known as [[Armistice Day]]. The war had ended in victory for the Allies.

Events on the [[Home front during World War I|home fronts]] were as tumultuous as on the battle fronts, as the participants tried to mobilize their manpower and economic resources to fight a [[total war]]. By the end of the war, four major imperial powers—the [[German Empire|German]], [[Russian Empire|Russian]], [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] empires—ceased to exist. The successor states of the former two lost a great amount of territory, while the latter two were dismantled entirely. The map of central Europe was redrawn into several smaller states.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keegan|1988|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[League of Nations]] was formed in the hope of preventing another such conflict. The European nationalism spawned by the war and the breakup of empires, the repercussions of Germany's defeat and problems with the [[Treaty of Versailles]] are agreed to be factors contributing to [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keegan|1988|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
In Canada, ''Maclean's Magazine'' in October 1914 said, &quot;Some wars name themselves. This is the Great War.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/81104 &quot;great, adj., adv., and n.&quot; in ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (Second edition, 1989; online version March 2012)]&lt;/ref&gt; A history of the origins and early months of the war published in New York in late 1914 was titled ''The World War''.&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Elbert Francis. ''The World War: How It Looks to the Nations Involved and What It Means to Us'' (New York: MacMillan Company, 1914). This book covers the war up to November 20, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; During the Interwar period, the war was most often called the ''World War'' and the ''Great War'' in English-speaking countries.

After the onset of the Second World War in 1939, the terms ''World War I'' or ''the First World War'' became standard, with British and Canadian historians favouring the ''First World War'', and Americans ''World War I''. Both of these terms had also been used during the Interwar period. The term &quot;First World War&quot; was first used in September 1914 by the German philosopher [[Ernst Haeckel]], who claimed that &quot;there is no doubt that the course and character of the feared 'European War' ... will become the first world war in the full sense of the word.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shapiro|2006|p=329}} citing a wire service report in ''The Indianapolis Star, 20 September 1914''&lt;/ref&gt; ''The First World War'' was also the title of a 1920 history by the officer and journalist [[Charles à Court Repington]].

==Background==
{{Main|Causes of World War I}}
[[File:WWI-re.png|thumb|400px|right|Map of the [[participants in World War I]]: [[Allies of World War I|Allied Powers]] in green, [[Central Powers]] in orange, and neutral countries in grey]]
In the 19th century, the major European powers had gone to great lengths to maintain a [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] throughout Europe, resulting by 1900 in a complex network of political and military alliances throughout the continent.&lt;ref name=Willmott15/&gt; These had started in 1815, with the [[Holy Alliance]] between [[Prussia]], Russia, and Austria. Then, in October 1873, German Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] negotiated the [[League of the Three Emperors]] (German: ''Dreikaiserbund'') between the monarchs of Austria–Hungary, Russia and Germany. This agreement failed because Austria–Hungary and Russia could not agree over Balkan policy, leaving Germany and Austria–Hungary in an alliance formed in 1879, called the [[Dual Alliance (1879)|Dual Alliance]]. This was seen as a method of countering Russian influence in the [[Balkans]] as the [[Ottoman Empire]] continued to weaken.&lt;ref name=Willmott15 /&gt; In 1882, this alliance was expanded to include Italy in what became the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]].&lt;ref name=keegan52&gt;{{harvnb|Keegan|1998|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1870, European conflict was averted largely through a carefully planned network of treaties between the German Empire and the remainder of Europe orchestrated by Bismarck. He especially worked to hold Russia at Germany's side to avoid a two-front war with France and Russia. When [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]] ascended to the throne as [[German Emperor]] (''Kaiser''), Bismarck was compelled to retire and his system of alliances was gradually de-emphasised. For example, the Kaiser refused to renew the [[Reinsurance Treaty]] with Russia in 1890. Two years later, the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] was signed to counteract the force of the Triple Alliance. In 1904, the United Kingdom signed a series of agreements with France, the [[Entente Cordiale]], and in 1907, the United Kingdom and Russia signed the [[Anglo-Russian Convention]]. While these agreements did not formally ally the United Kingdom with France or Russia, they made British entry into any future conflict involving France or Russia probable, and the system of interlocking bilateral agreements became known as the [[Triple Entente]].&lt;ref name=Willmott15/&gt;

[[File:HMS Dreadnought 1906 H61017.jpg|thumb|alt=Ship at sea with smoke emitting from two funnels|{{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}}. A naval [[arms race]] existed between the United Kingdom and Germany.]]

German industrial and economic power had grown greatly after [[German unification|unification and the foundation of the Empire]] in 1871. From the mid-1890s on, the government of Wilhelm II used this base to devote significant economic resources to building up the ''[[Kaiserliche Marine]]'' (Imperial German Navy), established by Admiral [[Alfred von Tirpitz]], in rivalry with the British [[Royal Navy]] for world naval supremacy.&lt;ref name=willmott21/&gt; As a result, each nation strove to out-build the other in terms of [[capital ships]]. With the launch of {{HMS|Dreadnought|1906|6}} in 1906, the British Empire expanded on its significant advantage over its German rival.&lt;ref name=willmott21&gt;{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arms race between Britain and Germany eventually extended to the rest of Europe, with all the major powers devoting their industrial base to producing the equipment and weapons necessary for a pan-European conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Prior|1999|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1908 and 1913, the military spending of the European powers increased by 50&amp;nbsp;percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fromkin2004&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fromkin|2004|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gavrilo Princip captured in Sarajevo 1914.jpg|left|thumb|Gavrilo Princip, a [[Bosnian Serb]] student, was arrested immediately after he assassinated [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]]]]

Austria-Hungary precipitated the [[Bosnian crisis]] of 1908–1909 by officially annexing the former Ottoman territory of [[Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina, which it had occupied since 1878]]. This angered the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] and its patron, the [[Pan-Slavism|Pan-Slavic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] [[Russian Empire]].&lt;ref name=keegan48-49&gt;{{harvnb|Keegan|1998|pp=48–49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian political manoeuvring in the region destabilised peace accords that were already fracturing in what was known as &quot;the [[powder keg of Europe]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=keegan48-49 /&gt;

In 1912 and 1913 the [[First Balkan War]] was fought between the [[Balkan League]] and the fracturing Ottoman Empire. The resulting [[Treaty of London (1913)|Treaty of London]] further shrank the Ottoman Empire, creating an independent Albanian State while enlarging the territorial holdings of Bulgaria, Serbia, Montenegro, and Greece. When Bulgaria attacked both Serbia and Greece on 16 June 1913, it lost most of Macedonia to Serbia and Greece and [[Southern Dobruja]] to Romania in the 33-day [[Second Balkan War]], further destabilising the region.&lt;ref name=Willmott22-23&gt;{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|pp=2–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Austria Hungary ethnic.svg|thumb|300px|Ethno-linguistic map of Austria–Hungary, 1910]]

On 28 June 1914, [[Gavrilo Princip]], a [[Bosnian Serb]] student and member of [[Young Bosnia]], assassinated the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]] in [[Sarajevo]], Bosnia.&lt;ref name=Willmott26&gt;{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; This began a month of diplomatic manoeuvring among Austria-Hungary, Germany, Russia, France, and Britain called the [[July Crisis]]. Wanting to finally end Serbian interference in Bosnia, Austria-Hungary delivered the July Ultimatum to Serbia, a series of ten demands intentionally made unacceptable, intending to provoke a war with Serbia.&lt;ref name=Willmott27&gt;{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Serbia agreed to only eight of the ten demands, Austria-Hungary declared war on 28 July 1914. [[Hew Strachan|Strachan]] argues, &quot;Whether an equivocal and early response by Serbia would have made any difference to Austria-Hungary's behaviour must be doubtful. Franz Ferdinand was not the sort of personality who commanded popularity, and his demise did not cast the empire into deepest mourning&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strachan|2003|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian Empire, unwilling to allow Austria–Hungary to eliminate its influence in the Balkans, and in support of its longtime Serb protégés, ordered a partial mobilisation one day later.&lt;ref name=keegan52 /&gt; The German Empire mobilized on 30 July 1914, ready to apply the &quot;Schlieffen Plan&quot; which planned a quick, massive invasion of France to eliminate the French army, then to turn east against Russia. The French cabinet  resisted to the military pressure on immediate mobilisation, and ordered its troops to withdraw 10 km from the border to avoid any incident. France mobilized only on the evening of August 2nd, when Germany invaded Belgium and attacked French troops. Germany declared war on Russia on the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Willmott|2003|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914, following an &quot;unsatisfactory reply&quot; to the British ultimatum that Belgium must be kept [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/mirror01_01.shtml|publisher=BBC|title=Daily Mirror Headlines: The Declaration of War, Published 4 August 1914|accessdate=9 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatres of conflict==

===Opening hostilities===

====Confusion among the Central Powers====
The strategy of the Central Powers suffered from miscommunication. Germany had promised to support Austria-Hungary's invasion of Serbia, but interpretations of what this meant differed. Previously tested deployment plans had been replaced early in 1914, but the replacements had never been tested in exercises. Austro-Hungarian leaders believed Germany would cover its northern flank against Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Strachan|2003|pp=292–296, 343–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- may be able to find more on this in Samuel R. Williamson, Jr: &quot;Austria-Hungary and the Origins of the First World War&quot; --&gt; Germany, however, envisioned Austria-Hungary directing most of its troops against Russia, while Germany dealt with France. This confusion forced the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] to divide its forces between the Russian and Serbian fronts.

On 9 September 1914, the ''[[Septemberprogramm]]'', a possible plan which detailed Germany's specific war aims and the conditions that Germany sought to force on the Allied Powers, was outlined by [[Chancellor of Germany|German Chancellor]] [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]]. It was never officially adopted.

{{Main|African theatre of World War I}}
Some of the first clashes of the war involved British, French, and German colonial forces in Africa. On 7 August, French and British troops invaded the German protectorate of [[Togoland]]. On 10 August, German forces in [[German South-West Africa|South-West Africa]] attacked South Africa; sporadic and fierce fighting continued for the rest of the war. The German colonial forces in [[German East Africa]], led by Colonel [[Paul Emil von Lettow-Vorbeck]], fought a [[guerrilla warfare]] campaign during World War I and only surrendered two weeks after the armistice took effect in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farwell|1989|p=353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Serbian campaign====

[[File:Serbian Artillery WW1.jpg|thumb|right|Serbian troops artillery positions in the [[Battle of Kolubara]].]]
Austria invaded and fought the Serbian army at the [[Battle of Cer]] and [[Battle of Kolubara]] beginning on 12 August. Over the next two weeks Austrian attacks were thrown back with heavy losses, which marked the first major Allied victories of the war and dashed Austro-Hungarian hopes of a swift victory. As a result, Austria had to keep sizable forces on the Serbian front, weakening its efforts against Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Serbia’s defeat of the Austro-Hungarian invasion of 1914 counts among the major upset victories of the last century.&lt;ref&gt;John R.

{{Main|Western Front (World War I)}}
At the outbreak of the First World War, the German army (consisting in the West of [[German Army order of battle (1914)|seven field armies]]) carried out a modified version of the [[Schlieffen Plan]], designed to quickly attack France through neutral Belgium before turning southwards to encircle the French army on the German border.&lt;ref name=AJPT2/&gt;. Since France had declared that it would &quot;keep full freedom of acting in case of a war between Germany and Russia&quot;, Germany had to expect the possibility of an attack on two fronts. To such a scenario the Schlieffen Plan stated that Germany must try to defeat France quickly (as had happened in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870-71). It further suggested that to repeat a fast victory in the west, Germany should not attack through Alsace-Lorraine (which had a direct border west of the river Rhine), the idea was instead to try to in a hurry cut Paris of from the English Channel (independent of Great Britain). Then the armies should be moved over to the east to meet Russia. Russia was believed to need a long time of preparations before they could become a real threat to the Central Powers.

Germany wanted free escort through Belgium (and originally Holland as well, which though Kaiser [[Wilhelm II]] rejected) to meet France by its borders. The answer from the neutral Belgium was of course &quot;no&quot;. Then Germany needed to invade Belgium instead, since this was the only existing plan in case of a two-front war for Germany.  However also France wanted to move their troops into Belgium, but Belgium originally rejected this &quot;suggestion&quot; as well, in hope of avoiding any war on Belgian soil. In the end, after the German invasion, Belgium did though try to join their army with the French (but a large part of the Belgian army retreated to [[Antwerp]] where they were forced to surrender when all hope of help was out).  

The plan called for the right flank of the German advance to converge on Paris, and initially the Germans were successful, particularly in the [[Battle of the Frontiers]] (14–24 August). By 12 September, the French, with assistance from the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British forces]], halted the German advance east of Paris at the [[First Battle of the Marne]] (5–12 September), and pushed the German forces some 50 km back. The last days of this battle signified the end of [[Maneuver warfare|mobile warfare]] in the west.&lt;ref name=AJPT2/&gt; The French offensive into Southern Alsace, launched on 20th August with the [[Battle of Mulhouse]], had limited success.

In the east, only one field army, the 8th was rapidly moved by rail across the German Empire. This army was led by general [[Paul von Hindenburg]] from being a reserve army in the west they defended [[East Prussia]], after the (from German point of view) surprisingly early Russian invasion with two armies. Germany defeated Russia in a series of battles collectively known as the First [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]] (17 August&amp;nbsp;– 2 September). But the failed Russian invasion most probably caused the German attack in the west to a sudden stop and tactical defeat by the French Army at [[Marne]]. The German soldiers had become tired and the reserve forces had been moved to meet the Russian invasion.  The [[German General Staff]] under general [[Helmuth von Moltke the Younger]] had also foreseen that the use of fast troop transports by rail did not work as expected outside the German Empire. The Central Powers were denied a quick victory in France and forced to fight a war on two fronts. The German army had fought its way into a good defensive position inside France and had permanently incapacitated 230,000 more French and British troops than it had lost itself. Despite this, communications problems and questionable command decisions cost Germany the chance of early victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=376–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October, the cruiser ''[[SMS Emden (1906)|SMS Emden]]'' sunk the [[Russian cruiser Zhemchug]] in the [[Battle of Penang]]. Japan seized Germany's Micronesian colonies and, after the [[Siege of Tsingtao]], the German coaling port of [[Qingdao]] in the Chinese [[Shandong]] peninsula. Within a few months, the Allied forces had seized all the German territories in the Pacific; only isolated commerce raiders and a few holdouts in New Guinea remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keegan|1968|pp=224–232}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Falls|1960|pp=79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trench warfare begins (1914–1915)====
[[File:WinstonChurchill1916Army.gif|thumb|upright|[[Winston Churchill|Sir Winston Churchill]] with the [[Royal Scots Fusiliers]], 1916]]
Military tactics before World War I had failed to keep pace with advances in technology. These advances allowed for impressive defence systems, which out-of-date military tactics could not break through for most of the war. [[Barbed wire]] was a significant hindrance to massed infantry advances. [[Artillery]], vastly&lt;!--between HE &amp; hydraulic recoil mechanisms, something like two orders of magnitude--&gt; more lethal than in the 1870s, coupled with [[machine guns]], made crossing open ground extremely difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raudzens|1990|pp=424}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans introduced [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]]; it soon became used by both sides, though it never proved decisive in winning a battle. Its effects were brutal, causing slow and painful death, and poison gas became one of the most-feared and best-remembered horrors of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Duffy |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/weaponry/gas.htm |title=Weapons of War: Poison Gas |publisher=Firstworldwar.com |date=2009-08-22 |accessdate=2012-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commanders on both sides failed to develop tactics for breaching entrenched positions without heavy casualties. In time, however, technology began to produce new offensive weapons, such as the [[tank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raudzens|1990|pp=421–423}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the [[First Battle of the Marne]] (5–12 September 1914), both [[Triple Entente|Entente]] and German forces began a series of outflanking manoeuvres, in the so-called &quot;[[Race to the Sea]]&quot;. Britain and France soon found themselves facing entrenched German forces from [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] to Belgium's coast.&lt;ref name=AJPT2/&gt; Britain and France sought to take the offensive, while Germany defended the occupied territories. Consequently, German trenches were much better constructed than those of their enemy; Anglo-French trenches were only intended to be &quot;temporary&quot; before their forces broke through German defences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodspeed|1985|p=199 (footnote)}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Royal Irish Rifles ration party Somme July 1916.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Mud stained British soldiers at rest |In the trenches: [[Royal Irish Rifles]] in a communications trench on the [[first day on the Somme]], 1 July 1916.]]
Both sides tried to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances. On 22 April 1915 at the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], the Germans (violating the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Convention]]) used [[chlorine]] gas for the first time on the Western Front. Algerian troops retreated when gassed and a six-kilometre (four-mile) hole opened in the Allied lines that the Germans quickly exploited, taking [[Kitcheners' Wood]], before [[Military history of Canada during World War I|Canadian soldiers]] closed the breach.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Love|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tanks]] were first used in combat by the British during the [[Battle of Flers-Courcelette]] (part of the wider Somme offensive) on 15 September 1916 with only partial success; the French introduced the revolving turret of the [[Renault FT]] in late 1917; the Germans employed captured Allied tanks and small numbers of their own design.

====Trench warfare continues (1916–1917)====
Neither side proved able to deliver a decisive blow for the next two years. Around 1.1 to 1.2 million soldiers from the British and Dominion armies were on the Western Front at any one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Perry|1988|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; A thousand battalions, occupying sectors of the line from the [[North Sea]] to the [[Orne River (Lorraine)|Orne River]], operated on a month-long four-stage rotation system, unless an offensive was underway. The front contained over {{convert|9600|km|mi|0}} of trenches. Each battalion held its sector for about a week before moving back to support lines and then further back to the reserve lines before a week out-of-line, often in the [[Poperinge]] or [[Amiens]] areas.

Throughout 1915–17, the British Empire and France suffered more casualties than Germany, because of both the strategic and tactical stances chosen by the sides. Strategically, while the Germans only mounted a single main offensive at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], the Allies made several attempts to break through German lines. 

[[File:Grand Fleet sails.jpg|thumb|The British [[Grand Fleet]] making steam for [[Scapa Flow]], 1914]]

On 1 July 1916, the [[British Army]] endured the bloodiest day in its history, suffering 57,470 casualties, including 19,240 dead, on the [[first day on the Somme|first day]] of the [[Battle of the Somme]]. Most of the casualties occurred in the first hour of the attack. The entire Somme offensive cost the British Army almost half a million men.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Duffy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Hochseeflotte 2.jpg|thumb|A battleship squadron of the [[High Seas Fleet|Hochseeflotte]] at sea]]

Protracted German action at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]] throughout 1916,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=1221}}&lt;/ref&gt; combined with the bloodletting at the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]] (July and August 1916), brought the exhausted French army to the brink of collapse. Futile attempts at frontal assault came at a high price for both the British and the French ''[[poilu]]'' and led to [[French Army Mutinies (1917)|widespread mutinies in 1917]], after the costly [[Nivelle Offensive]] (April and May 1917).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=854}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tactically, German commander [[Erich Ludendorff]]'s doctrine of &quot;[[defense in depth|elastic defence]]&quot; was well suited for trench warfare. This defence had a lightly defended forward position and a more powerful main position farther back beyond artillery range, from which an immediate and powerful counter-offensive could be launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heer|2009|pp=223–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Goodspeed|1985|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ludendorff wrote on the fighting in 1917, {{quote|The 25th&amp;nbsp;of August concluded the second phase of the Flanders battle. It had cost us heavily&amp;nbsp;... The costly August battles in Flanders and at Verdun imposed a heavy strain on the Western troops. In spite of all the concrete protection they seemed more or less powerless under the enormous weight of the enemy's artillery. At some points they no longer displayed the firmness which I, in common with the local commanders, had hoped for. The enemy managed to adapt himself to our method of employing counter attacks&amp;nbsp;... I myself was being put to a terrible strain. The state of affairs in the West appeared to prevent the execution of our plans elsewhere. Our wastage had been so high as to cause grave misgivings, and had exceeded all expectation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ludendorff|1919|p=480}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the battle of the Menin Road Ridge, Ludendorff wrote, {{quote|Another terrific assault was made on our lines on the&amp;nbsp;20 September&amp;nbsp;... The enemy's onslaught on the 20th was successful, which proved the superiority of the attack over the defence. Its strength did not consist in the tanks; we found them inconvenient, but put them out of action all the same. The power of the attack lay in the artillery, and in the fact that ours did not do enough damage to the hostile infantry as they were assembling, and above all, at the actual time of the assault.&lt;ref name=&quot;Terraine-Victory&quot; /&gt;}}

In the 1917 [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]], the only significant British military success was the capture of [[Vimy Ridge]] by the [[Canadian Corps]] under [[Sir Arthur Currie]] and [[Julian Byng]]. The assaulting troops could – for the first time – overrun, rapidly reinforce, and hold the ridge defending the coal-rich [[Douai]] plain.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Vimy Ridge, Canadian National Memorial|year=2007|url=http://www.ww1westernfront.gov.au/vimy-ridge/index.html|work=Australians on the Western Front 1914–1918|publisher=New South Wales Department of Veteran's Affairs and Board of Studies|author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winegard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naval war===
{{Main|Naval warfare of World War I}}
At the start of the war, the German Empire had [[cruiser]]s scattered across the globe, some of which were subsequently used to attack Allied [[merchant shipping]]. The British [[Royal Navy]] systematically hunted them down, though not without some embarrassment from its inability to protect Allied shipping. For example, the German detached light cruiser [[SMS Emden (1908)|SMS ''Emden'']], part of the East-Asia squadron stationed at Tsingtao, seized or destroyed 15 merchantmen, as well as sinking a Russian cruiser and a French destroyer. However, most of the [[German East Asia Squadron|German East-Asia squadron]]—consisting of the armoured cruisers {{SMS|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{SMS|Gneisenau||2}}, light cruisers {{SMS|Nürnberg|1906|2}} and {{SMS|Leipzig||2}} and two transport ships—did not have orders to raid shipping and was instead underway to Germany when it met British warships. The German flotilla and {{SMS|Dresden|1907|2}} sank two armoured cruisers at the [[Battle of Coronel]], but was almost destroyed at the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]] in December 1914, with only ''Dresden'' and a few auxiliaries escaping, but at the [[Battle of Más a Tierra]] these too were destroyed or interned.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2007|pp=39–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after the outbreak of hostilities, Britain began a naval [[blockade of Germany]]. The strategy proved effective, cutting off vital military and civilian supplies, although this blockade violated accepted international law codified by several international agreements of the past two centuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-313-33181-2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Keene|2006|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain mined international waters to prevent any ships from entering entire sections of ocean, causing danger to even neutral ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn1-85728-498-4&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Halpern|1995|p=293}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since there was limited response to this tactic, Germany expected a similar response to its unrestricted submarine warfare.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-8476-9645-6&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Zieger|2001|p=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1916 [[Battle of Jutland]] (German: ''Skagerrakschlacht'', or &quot;Battle of the Skagerrak&quot;) developed into the largest naval battle of the war, the only full-scale clash of battleships during the war, and one of the largest in history. It took place on 31 May&amp;nbsp;– 1 June 1916, in the [[North Sea]] off [[Jutland]]. The Kaiserliche Marine's High Seas Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]], squared off against the Royal Navy's [[Grand Fleet]], led by Admiral Sir [[John Jellicoe, 1st Earl Jellicoe|John Jellicoe]]. The engagement was a stand off, as the Germans, outmanoeuvred by the larger British fleet, managed to escape and inflicted more damage to the British fleet than they received. Strategically, however, the British asserted their control of the sea, and the bulk of the German surface fleet remained confined to port for the duration of the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=619–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

German [[U-boats]] attempted to cut the supply lines between North America and Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheffield&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Sheffield|first=Garry|title=The First Battle of the Atlantic|work=World Wars In Depth|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/battle_atlantic_ww1_01.shtml|publisher=BBC|accessdate=11 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of submarine warfare meant that attacks often came without warning, giving the crews of the merchant ships little hope of survival.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheffield&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-8050-7617-4&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gilbert|2004|p=306}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States launched a protest, and Germany changed its rules of engagement. After the sinking of the passenger ship [[RMS Lusitania|RMS ''Lusitania'']] in 1915, Germany promised not to target passenger liners, while Britain armed its merchant ships, placing them beyond the protection of the &quot;cruiser rules&quot; which demanded warning and placing crews in &quot;a place of safety&quot; (a standard which lifeboats did not meet).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|von der Porten|1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in early 1917 Germany adopted a policy of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]], realising the Americans would eventually enter the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheffield&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-8420-2918-4&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|2001|p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany sought to strangle Allied sea lanes before the U.S. could transport a large army overseas, but could maintain only five long-range U-boats on station, to limited effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheffield&quot; /&gt;

[[File:NationaalArchief uboat155London.jpg|thumb|[[Unterseeboot 155 (1917)|U-155]] exhibited near Tower Bridge in London after the First World War.]]
The U-boat threat lessened in 1917, when merchant ships began travelling in [[Convoys in World War I|convoys]], escorted by [[destroyer]]s. This tactic made it difficult for U-boats to find targets, which significantly lessened losses; after the [[hydrophone]] and [[depth charge]]s were introduced, accompanying destroyers might attack a submerged submarine with some hope of success. Convoys slowed the flow of supplies, since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled. The solution to the delays was an extensive program to build new freighters. Troopships were too fast for the submarines and did not travel the North Atlantic in convoys.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/legislature/hansard//comm/va/va_2006nov09.htm|title=Nova Scotia House of Assembly Committee on Veterans' Affairs|accessdate=30 October 2007|work=Hansard|author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U-boats had sunk more than 5,000 Allied ships, at a cost of 199 submarines.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Chickering, Stig Förster, Bernd Greiner, German Historical Institute (Washington, D.C.)

====War in the Balkans====
{{Main|Balkans Campaign (World War I)|Serbian Campaign (World War I)|Macedonian front (World War I)}}

[[File:Austrians executing Serbs 1917.JPG|thumb|Austro-Hungarian troops executing captured Serbians.

''[[Library of Congress Country Studies]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Faced with Russia, Austria-Hungary could spare only one-third of its army to attack Serbia. After suffering heavy losses, the Austrians briefly occupied the Serbian capital, [[Belgrade]]. A Serbian counterattack in the [[battle of Kolubara]], however, succeeded in driving them from the country by the end of 1914. For the first ten months of 1915, Austria-Hungary used most of its military reserves to fight Italy. German and Austro-Hungarian diplomats, however, scored a coup by persuading Bulgaria to join in attacking Serbia. The Austro-Hungarian provinces of [[Slovenia]], Croatia and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] provided troops for Austria-Hungary, invading Serbia as well as fighting Russia and Italy. Montenegro allied itself with Serbia.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neiberg|2005|pp=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Serbia was conquered in a little more than a month, as the Central Powers, now including Bulgaria, sent in 600,000 troops. The Serbian army, fighting on two fronts and facing certain defeat, retreated into northern [[Principality of Albania|Albania]] (which they had invaded at the beginning of the war{{dubious|date=September 2012}}). The Serbs suffered defeat in the [[Battle of Kosovo (1915)|Battle of Kosovo]]. Montenegro covered the Serbian retreat towards the Adriatic coast in the [[Battle of Mojkovac]] in 6–7 January 1916, but ultimately the Austrians conquered Montenegro, too. The surviving 70,000 Serbian soldiers were evacuated by ship to Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=1075–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1915, a Franco-British force landed at [[Salonica]] in Greece, to offer assistance and to pressure the government to declare war against the Central Powers. Unfortunately for the Allies, the pro-German [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I]] dismissed the pro-Allied government of [[Eleftherios Venizelos]], before the Allied expeditionary force could arrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neiberg|2005|pp=108–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The friction between the king of Greece and the Allies continued to accumulate with the [[National Schism]], which effectively divided Greece between regions still loyal to the king and the new provisional government of Venizelos in Salonica. After intensive diplomatic negotiations and an armed confrontation in [[Athens]] between Allied and royalist forces (an incident known as [[Noemvriana]]) the king of Greece resigned, and his second son [[Alexander of Greece|Alexander]] took his place. Venizelos returned to Athens on 29 May 1917 and Greece, now unified, officially joined the war on the side of the Allies. The entire Greek army was mobilized and began to participate in military operations against the [[Central Powers]] on the Macedonian front.
[[File:Bulgaria southern front.jpg|thumb|Bulgarian soldiers in a trench, preparing to fire against an incoming airplane]]
After conquest, Serbia was divided between Austro-Hungary and Bulgaria. In 1917 the Serbs launched the [[Toplica (river)#Toplica rebellion|Toplica Uprising]] and liberated for a short time the area between the [[Kopaonik]] mountains and the [[South Morava]] river. The uprising was crushed by joint efforts of Bulgarian and Austrian forces at the end of March 1917.

The Macedonian Front in the beginning was mostly static. French and Serbian forces retook limited areas of Macedonia by recapturing [[Bitola]] on 19 November 1916 as a result of the costly [[Monastir Offensive]] which brought stabilization of the front.

Serbian and French troops finally made a breakthrough, after most of the German and Austro-Hungarian troops had withdrawn. This breakthrough was significant in defeating Bulgaria and Austro-Hungary, which led to the final victory of WWI. The Bulgarians suffered their only defeat of the war at the [[Battle of Dobro Pole]] but days later, they decisively defeated British and Greek forces at the [[Battle of Doiran]], avoiding occupation. After Serbian breakthrough of Bulgarian lines, Bulgaria capitulated on 29 September 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|Wood|Murphy|1999|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hindenburg and Ludendorff concluded that the strategic and operational balance had now shifted decidedly against the [[Central Powers]] and a day after the Bulgarian collapse, during a meeting with government officials, insisted on an immediate peace settlement.&lt;ref name=Doughty&gt;{{Citation|url=http://books.google.com/?id=vZRmHkdGk44C&amp;pg=PA247|title=Pyrrhic victory: French strategy and operations in the Great War|first=Robert A.

The disappearance of the [[Macedonian front]] meant that the road to [[Budapest]] and [[Vienna]] was now opened for the 670,000-strong army of general [[Franchet d'Esperey]] as the Bulgarian surrender deprived the [[Central Powers]] of the 278 infantry battalions and 1,500 guns (the equivalent of some 25 to 30 German divisions) that were previously holding the line.&lt;ref name=militera/&gt; The German high command responded by sending only seven infantry and one cavalry division but these forces were far from enough for a front to be reestablished.&lt;ref name=militera&gt;{{cite web|url=http://militera.lib.ru/h/korsun_ng4/06.html|title=The Balkan Front of the World War (in Russian)|first=N.Korsun|publisher=militera.lib.ru|accessdate=27 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ottoman Empire====
{{Main|Middle Eastern theatre of World War I}}
The Ottoman Empire joined the Central Powers in the war, the secret [[Ottoman-German Alliance]] having been signed in August 1914.&lt;ref&gt;[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/turkgerm.asp The Treaty of Alliance Between Germany and Turkey] 2 August 1914, Yale University&lt;/ref&gt; It threatened Russia's [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] territories and Britain's communications with India via the [[Suez Canal]]. The British and French opened overseas fronts with the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] (1915) and [[Mesopotamian campaign]]s. In Gallipoli, the Ottoman Empire successfully repelled the British, French, and [[Australian and New Zealand Army Corps]] (ANZACs). In Mesopotamia, by contrast, after the disastrous [[Siege of Kut]] (1915–16), British Imperial forces reorganised and captured [[Baghdad]] in March 1917.

{{main|Sinai and Palestine Campaign}}
Further to the west, the [[Suez Canal]] was successfully defended from Ottoman attacks in 1915 and 1916; in August a joint [[German Empire|German]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] force was defeated at the [[Battle of Romani]] by the [[Anzac Mounted Division|Anzac Mounted]] and the [[52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division]]s. Following this victory, a [[British Empire]] [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] advanced across the [[Sinai Peninsula]], pushing Ottoman forces back in the [[Battle of Magdhaba]] in December and the [[Battle of Rafa]] on the border between the Egyptian [[Sinai]] and Ottoman Palestine in January 1917.

[[File:Sarikam.jpg|thumb|Russian forest trench at the Battle of Sarikamish]]
Russian armies generally had the best of it in the Caucasus. [[Enver Pasha]], supreme commander of the Ottoman armed forces, was ambitious and dreamed of re-conquering central Asia and areas that had been lost to Russia previously. He was, however, a poor commander.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-8050-6884-8&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Fromkin|2001|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; He launched an offensive against the Russians in the Caucasus in December 1914 with 100,000 troops; insisting on a frontal attack against mountainous Russian positions in winter, he lost 86% of his force at the [[Battle of Sarikamish]].&lt;ref name=caven&gt;{{harvnb|Hinterhoff|1984|pp=499–503}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General [[Nikolai Yudenich|Yudenich]], the Russian commander from 1915 to 1916, drove the Turks out of most of the southern Caucasus with a string of victories.&lt;ref name=caven /&gt; In 1917, Russian [[Grand Duke Nicholas]] assumed command of the Caucasus front. Nicholas planned a railway from Russian Georgia to the conquered territories, so that fresh supplies could be brought up for a new offensive in 1917. However, in March 1917 (February in the pre-revolutionary Russian calendar), the Czar was overthrown in the [[February Revolution]] and the [[Russian Caucasus Army (World War I)|Russian Caucasus Army]] began to fall apart.

Instigated by the Arab bureau of the British [[Foreign Office]], the [[Arab Revolt]] started with the help of Britain in June 1916 at the [[Battle of Mecca 1916|Battle of Mecca]], led by [[Sherif Hussein]] of [[Mecca]], and ended with the Ottoman surrender of Damascus. [[Fakhri Pasha]], the Ottoman commander of [[Medina]], resisted for more than two and half years during the [[Siege of Medina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sachar|pp=122–138}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Along the border of Italian Libya and British Egypt, the [[Senussi]] tribe, incited and armed by the Turks, waged a small-scale guerrilla war against Allied troops. The British were forced to dispatch 12,000 troops to oppose them in the [[Senussi Campaign]]. Their rebellion was finally crushed in mid-1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gilbert|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italian participation====
{{Main|Italian Campaign (World War I)}}
{{Further|Battles of the Isonzo}}
[[File:Austro-Hungarian mountain corps.jpg|thumb|upright|Austro-Hungarian mountain corps in Tyrol]]
Italy had been allied with the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires since 1882 as part of the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. However, the nation had its own designs on Austrian territory in [[Trentino]], [[Istria]], and [[Dalmatia]]. Rome had a secret 1902 pact with France, effectively nullifying its alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of hostilities, Italy refused to commit troops, arguing that the Triple Alliance was defensive and that Austria–Hungary was an aggressor. The Austro-Hungarian government began negotiations to secure Italian neutrality, offering the French colony of Tunisia in return. The Allies made a counter-offer in which Italy would receive the [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol|Southern Tyrol]], [[Julian March]] and territory on the [[Dalmatia]]n coast after the defeat of Austria-Hungary. This was formalised by the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]]. Further encouraged by the Allied invasion of Turkey in April 1915, Italy joined the Triple Entente and declared war on Austria-Hungary on 23 May. Fifteen months later Italy declared war on Germany.

Militarily, the Italians had numerical superiority. This advantage, however, was lost, not only because of the difficult terrain in which fighting took place, but also because of the strategies and tactics employed. [[Field Marshal]] [[Luigi Cadorna]], a staunch proponent of the frontal assault, had dreams of breaking into the [[Slovenia]]n plateau, taking [[Ljubljana]] and threatening [[Vienna]]. Cadorna's plan did not take into account the difficulties of the rugged Alpine terrain, or the technological changes that created [[trench warfare]], giving rise to a series of bloody and inconclusive stalemated offensives.

On the Trentino front, the Austro-Hungarians took advantage of the mountainous terrain, which favoured the defender. After an initial strategic retreat, the front remained largely unchanged, while Austrian [[Kaiserschützen]] and [[:de:Standschützen|Standschützen]] engaged Italian [[Alpini]] in bitter hand-to-hand combat throughout the summer. The Austro-Hungarians counterattacked in the [[Asiago|Altopiano of Asiago]], towards Verona and Padua, in the spring of 1916 (''[[Battle of Asiago|Strafexpedition]]''), but made little progress.

Beginning in 1915, the Italians under Cadorna mounted eleven offensives on the [[Soča|Isonzo front]] along the [[Soča|Isonzo River]], northeast of [[Trieste]]. All eleven offensives were repelled by the Austro-Hungarians, who held the higher ground. In the summer of 1916, the Italians captured the town of [[Gorizia]]. After this minor victory, the front remained static for over a year, despite several Italian offensives. In the autumn of 1917, thanks to the improving situation on the Eastern front, the Austro-Hungarian troops received large numbers of reinforcements, including German [[Stormtrooper]]s and the elite [[Alpenkorps (German Empire)|Alpenkorps]]. 

[[File:Kämpfe auf dem Doberdo.JPG|210px|left|thumb|Depiction of the [[Battle of Doberdò]], fought in August 1916 between the Italian and Austro-Hungarian army.]]

The Central Powers launched a crushing offensive on 26 October 1917, spearheaded by the Germans. They achieved a victory at [[Battle of Caporetto|Caporetto]]. The Italian Army was routed and retreated more than {{convert|100|km|mi}} to reorganise, stabilising the front at the [[Battle of the Piave River|Piave River]]. Since in the Battle of Caporetto the Italian Army had heavy losses, the Italian Government called to arms the so-called '''99 Boys'' (''Ragazzi del '99''): that is, all males who were 18 years old. In 1918, the Austro-Hungarians failed to break through, in a series of battles on the [[Battle of the Piave River|Piave River]], and were finally decisively defeated in the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]] in October of that year. From 5–6 November 1918, Italian forces were reported to have reached [[Vis (island)|Lissa]], [[Lastovo|Lagosta]], [[Šibenik|Sebenico]], and other localities on the Dalmatian coast.&lt;ref&gt;Giuseppe Praga, Franco Luxardo.

====Romanian participation====
{{Main|Romania during World War I}}
[[File:Marshal Joffre inspecting Romanian troops during WWI.jpg|thumb|Marshal [[Joffre]] inspecting Romanian troops]]
Romania had been allied with the Central Powers since 1882. When the war began, however, it declared its neutrality, arguing that because Austria-Hungary had itself declared war on Serbia, Romania was under no obligation to join the war. When the Entente Powers promised Romania large territories of eastern Hungary ([[Transylvania]] and [[Banat]]) that had a large Romanian population in exchange for Romania's declaring war on the Central Powers, the Romanian government renounced its neutrality, and on 27 August 1916 the Romanian Army [[Battle of Transylvania|launched an attack]] against Austria-Hungary, with limited Russian support. The Romanian offensive was initially successful, pushing back the Austro-Hungarian troops in Transylvania, but a counterattack by the forces of the [[Central Powers]] drove back the Russo-Romanian forces. As a result of the [[Battle of Bucharest]] the Central Powers occupied Bucharest on 6 December 1916. Fighting in Moldova [[Romanian Campaign#Stabilization and stalemate (1917)|continued in 1917]], resulting in a costly stalemate for the Central Powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwar2.ro/primulrazboi/?language=en&amp;article=116|title=The Battle of Marasti (July 1917)|publisher=WorldWar2.ro|date=22 July 1917|accessdate=8 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Falls, ''The Great War'', p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Russian withdrawal from the war in late 1917 as a result of the [[October Revolution]] meant that Romania was forced to sign an armistice with the Central Powers on 9 December 1917.

In January 1918, Romanian forces established control over [[Bessarabia]] as the Russian Army abandoned the province. Although a treaty was signed by the Romanian and the [[Bolshevik]] Russian government following talks from 5–9 March 1918 on the withdrawal of Romanian forces from Bessarabia within two months, on 27 March 1918 Romania attached Bessarabia to its territory, formally based on a resolution passed by the local assembly of the territory on the unification with Romania.

Romania officially made peace with the Central Powers by signing the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|Treaty of Bucharest]] on 7 May 1918. Under that treaty, Romania was obliged to end war with the Central Powers and make small territorial concessions to Austria-Hungary, ceding control of some passes in the [[Carpathian Mountains]], and grant oil concessions to Germany. In exchange, the Central Powers recognised the sovereignty of Romania over [[Bessarabia]]. The treaty was renounced in October 1918 by the [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] government, and Romania nominally re-entered the war on 10 November 1918. The next day, the Treaty of Bucharest was nullified by the terms of the Armistice of [[Compiègne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Béla|first=Köpeczi|title=Erdély története|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó|url=http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02109/html/571.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Béla|first=Köpeczi|title=History of Transylvania|publisher=Akadémiai Kiadó|url=http://mek.niif.hu/03400/03407/html/429.html|isbn=84-8371-020-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Total Romanian deaths from 1914 to 1918, military and civilian, within contemporary borders, were estimated at 748,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Poteri narodonaseleniia v XX veke : spravochnik|last=Erlikman|first=Vadim|year=2004|location=Moscow|isbn=5-93165-107-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The role of India====
{{Further2|[[Third Anglo-Afghan War]]|[[Hindu-German Conspiracy]]}}
Contrary to British fears of a revolt in India, the outbreak of the war saw an unprecedented outpouring of loyalty and goodwill towards the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=197–198}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1994|pp=201–203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian political leaders from the [[Indian National Congress]] and other groups were eager to support the British war effort since they believed that strong support for the war effort would further the cause of [[Indian Home Rule Movement|Indian Home Rule]]. The [[British Indian Army|Indian Army]] in fact outnumbered the British Army at the beginning of the war; about 1.3&amp;nbsp;million Indian soldiers and labourers served in Europe, Africa, and the Middle East, while both the central government and the [[princely states]] sent large supplies of food, money, and ammunition. In all, 140,000&amp;nbsp;men served on the Western Front and nearly 700,000 in the Middle East. Casualties of Indian soldiers totalled 47,746 killed and 65,126 wounded during World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mgtrust.org/ind1.htm|title=Participants from the Indian subcontinent in the First World War|publisher=Memorial Gates Trust|accessdate=12 December 2008|author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The suffering engendered by the war as well as the failure of the British government to grant self-government to India after the end of hostilities bred disillusionment and fuelled [[Indian independence movement|the campaign for full independence]] that would be led by [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi]] and others.

===Eastern Front===

====Initial actions====
{{Main|Eastern Front (World War I)}}
While the Western Front had reached stalemate, the war continued in East Europe. Initial Russian plans called for simultaneous invasions of Austrian [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] and German East Prussia. Although Russia's initial advance into Galicia was largely successful, it was driven back from East Prussia by [[Paul von Hindenburg|Hindenburg]] and [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]] at [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Tannenberg]] and the [[First Battle of the Masurian Lakes|Masurian Lakes]] in August and September 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|2005|p=715}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Meyer|2006|pp=152–4, 161, 163, 175, 182}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia's less developed industrial base and ineffective military leadership was instrumental in the events that unfolded. By the spring of 1915, the Russians had retreated into Galicia, and in May the Central Powers achieved a remarkable breakthrough on Poland's southern frontiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smele&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Smele}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 August they captured [[Warsaw]] and forced the Russians to withdraw from Poland.

====Russian Revolution====
{{Main|Russian Revolution (1917)}}
{{Further|North Russia Campaign}}
[[File:Lenin.WWI.JPG|thumb|upright|alt=A man in a business suit holds up his right hand with palm open.|[[Vladimir Lenin|Vladimir Illyich Lenin]]]]
Despite the success of the June 1916 [[Brusilov Offensive]] in eastern [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schindler|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; dissatisfaction with the Russian government's conduct of the war grew. The offensive's success was undermined by the reluctance of other generals to commit their forces to support the victory. Allied and Russian forces were revived only temporarily by Romania's entry into the war on 27 August. German forces came to the aid of embattled Austro-Hungarian units in [[Transylvania]], and [[Bucharest]] fell to the Central Powers on 6 December. Meanwhile, unrest grew in Russia, as the [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar]] remained at the front. [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Empress Alexandra's]] increasingly incompetent rule drew protests and resulted in the murder of her favourite, [[Grigori Rasputin|Rasputin]], at the end of 1916.

In March 1917, demonstrations in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]] culminated in the abdication of [[Nicholas II of Russia|Tsar Nicholas II]] and the appointment of a weak [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] which shared power with the [[Petrograd Soviet]] socialists. This arrangement led to confusion and chaos both at the front and at home. The army became increasingly ineffective.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smele&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Brest-litovsk treaty.jpg|thumb|Signing the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk (9 February 1918) are: 1. [[Count Ottokar von Czernin]], 2. [[Richard von Kühlmann]], and 3. [[Vasil Radoslavov]]|alt=Three formally attired men at a conference table sign documents while 32 others look on.]]

Discontent and the weaknesses of the Provisional Government led to a rise in popularity of the [[Bolshevik]] Party, led by [[Vladimir Lenin]], which demanded an immediate end to the war. The [[October Revolution|successful armed uprising by the Bolsheviks]] of November was followed in December by an armistice and negotiations with Germany. At first the Bolsheviks refused the German terms, but when German troops began marching across the Ukraine unopposed, the new government acceded to the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] on 3 March 1918. The treaty ceded vast territories, including Finland, the [[Baltic states|Baltic provinces]], parts of Poland and Ukraine to the Central Powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wheeler-Bennett|1956}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this enormous apparent German success, the manpower required for German occupation of former Russian territory may have contributed to the failure of the Spring Offensive and secured relatively little food or other [[materiel]].

With the adoption of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, the Entente no longer existed. The Allied powers led [[Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War|a small-scale invasion]] of Russia, partly to stop Germany from exploiting Russian resources and, to a lesser extent, to support the &quot;Whites&quot; (as opposed to the &quot;Reds&quot;) in the [[Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mawdsley|2008|pp=54–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allied troops landed in [[Arkhangelsk]] and in [[Vladivostok]].

===Central Powers proposal for starting peace negotiations===
[[File:River Crossing NGM-v31-p338.jpg|thumb|On the way to [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]]. &quot;''[[They shall not pass]]&quot;'' is a phrase typically associated with the defense of Verdun.]]
In December 1916, after ten brutal months of the [[Battle of Verdun]] and a [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)#The counteroffensive of the Central Powers (September–December 1916)|successful offensive against Romania]], the Germans attempted to negotiate a peace with the Allies. Soon after, U.S. President Woodrow Wilson attempted to intervene as a peacemaker, asking in a note for both sides to state their demands. Lloyd George's War Cabinet considered the German offer to be a ploy to create divisions amongst the Allies. After initial outrage and much deliberation, they took Wilson's note as a separate effort, signalling that the U.S. was on the verge of entering the war against Germany following the &quot;submarine outrages&quot;. While the Allies debated a response to Wilson's offer, the Germans chose to rebuff it in favour of &quot;a direct exchange of views&quot;. Learning of the German response, the Allied governments were free to make clear demands in their response of 14 January. They sought restoration of damages, the evacuation of occupied territories, reparations for France, Russia and Romania, and a recognition of the principle of nationalities. This included the liberation of Italians, Slavs, Romanians, Czecho-Slovaks, and the creation of a &quot;free and united Poland&quot;. On the question of security, the Allies sought guarantees that would prevent or limit future wars, complete with sanctions, as a condition of any peace settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kernek|1970|pp=721–766}}&lt;/ref&gt; The negotiations failed and the Entente powers rejected the German offer, because Germany did not state any specific proposals. To Wilson, the Entente powers stated that they would not start peace negotiations until the Central powers evacuated all occupied Allied territories and provided indemnities for all damage which had been done.&lt;ref&gt;Stracham (1998), p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

===1917–1918===

====Developments in 1917====
Events of 1917 proved decisive in ending the war, although their effects were not fully felt until 1918.

The British naval blockade began to have a serious impact on Germany. In response, in February 1917, the [[German General Staff]] convinced [[Chancellor]] [[Theobald von Bethmann-Hollweg]] to declare unrestricted submarine warfare, with the goal of starving Britain out of the war. German planners estimated that unrestricted submarine warfare would cost Britain a monthly shipping loss of 600,000 tons. The General Staff acknowledged that the policy would almost certainly bring the United States into the conflict, but calculated that British shipping losses would be so high that they would be forced to sue for peace after 5 to 6 months, before American intervention could make an impact. In reality, tonnage sunk rose above 500,000&amp;nbsp;tons per month from February to July. It peaked at 860,000&amp;nbsp;tons in April. After July, the newly re-introduced [[convoy]] system became extremely effective in reducing the [[U-boat]] threat. Britain was safe from starvation while German industrial output fell, and the United States troops joined the war in large numbers far earlier than Germany had anticipated.
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1983-0323-501, Kriegskinematograph im Schützengraben.jpg|thumb|German&lt;!--UFA?--&gt; film crew recording the action.]]

On 3 May 1917, during the [[Nivelle Offensive]], the weary French 2nd Colonial Division, veterans of the Battle of Verdun, refused their orders, arriving drunk and without their weapons. Their officers lacked the means to punish an entire division, and harsh measures were not immediately implemented. Then, [[French Army Mutinies (1917)|mutinies]] afflicted an additional 54 French divisions and saw 20,000 men desert. The other Allied forces attacked but sustained tremendous casualties.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lyons|1999|p=243}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, appeals to patriotism and duty, as well as mass arrests and trials, encouraged the soldiers to return to defend their trenches, although the French soldiers refused to participate in further offensive action.&lt;ref&gt;Marshall, 292.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Nivelle]] was removed from command by 15 May, replaced by General [[Philippe Pétain]], who suspended bloody large-scale attacks.

The victory of Austria–Hungary and Germany at the [[Battle of Caporetto]] led the Allies at the [[Rapallo Conference]] to form the [[Supreme War Council]] to coordinate planning. Previously, British and French armies had operated under separate commands.

[[File:Guetteur au poste de l'écluse 26.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Haut-Rhin]], France, 1917]]

In December, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia. This released large numbers of German troops for use in the west. With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the Western Front. The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for success based on a final quick offensive. Furthermore, the leaders of the Central Powers and the Allies became increasingly fearful of social unrest and revolution in Europe. Thus, both sides urgently sought a decisive victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-313-29880-7&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Heyman|1997|pp=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ottoman Empire conflict in 1917====
{{main|Sinai and Palestine Campaign}}
In March and April 1917 at the [[First Battle of Gaza|First]] and [[Second Battle of Gaza|Second Battles of Gaza]], German and Ottoman forces stopped the advance of the [[Egyptian Expeditionary Force]] which had begun in August 1916 at [[Battle of Romani|Romani]]. At the end of October the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign]] resumed, when General [[Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby|Edmund Allenby]]'s [[XX Corps (United Kingdom)|XXth Corps]], [[XXI Corps (United Kingdom)|XXI Corps]] and [[Desert Mounted Corps]] won the [[Battle of Beersheba (1917)|Battle of Beersheba]]. Two Ottoman armies were defeated a few weeks later at the [[Battle of Mughar Ridge]], and early in December [[Jerusalem]] was captured following another Ottoman defeat at the [[Battle of Jerusalem (1917)]]. About this time [[Friedrich Freiherr Kress von Kressenstein]] was relieved of his duties as the Eighth Army's commander, replaced by [[Cevat Çobanlı|Djevad Pasha]], and a few months later the commander of the [[Ottoman Army]] in Palestine, [[Erich von Falkenhayn]], was replaced by [[Otto Liman von Sanders]].

====Entry of the United States====
{{Main|American entry into World War I}}

=====Non-intervention=====
At the outbreak of the war the United States pursued a policy of [[non-intervention]], avoiding conflict while trying to broker a peace. When a German U-boat [[Sinking of the RMS Lusitania|sank the British liner RMS ''Lusitania'']] on 7 May 1915 with 128 Americans among the dead, President [[Woodrow Wilson]] insisted that &quot;America is too proud to fight&quot; but demanded an end to attacks on passenger ships. Germany complied. Wilson unsuccessfully tried to mediate a settlement. However, he also repeatedly warned that the U.S.A. would not tolerate unrestricted submarine warfare, in violation of international law. Former president [[Theodore Roosevelt]] denounced German acts as &quot;piracy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brands|1997|p=756}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was narrowly reelected in 1916 as his supporters emphasized &quot;he kept us out of war&quot;.

In January 1917, Germany resumed unrestricted submarine warfare, realizing it would mean American entry. The German Foreign Minister, in the [[Zimmermann Telegram]], invited Mexico to join the war as Germany's ally against the United States. In return, the Germans would finance Mexico's war and help it recover the territories of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tuchman|1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson released the Zimmerman note to the public, and Americans saw it as ''casus belli''—a cause for war. Wilson called on antiwar elements to end all wars, by winning this one and eliminating militarism from the globe. He argued that the war was so important that the U.S. had to have a voice in the peace conference.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karp-PoW-1979&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karp|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:USA bryter de diplomatiska förbindelserna med Tyskland 3 februari 1917.jpg|thumb|[[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] before Congress, announcing the break in official relations with Germany on 3 February 1917.]]

=====U.S. declaration of war on Germany=====
After the sinking of seven U.S. merchant ships by submarines and the publication of the Zimmerman telegram, Wilson called for war on Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[[S: Woodrow Wilson Urges Congress to Declare War on Germany|&quot;Woodrow Wilson Urges Congress to Declare War on Germany&quot;]] (Wikisource)&lt;/ref&gt; which the [[U.S. Congress]] [[United States declaration of war on Germany (1917)|declared on 6 April 1917]].

=====First active U.S. participation=====
The United States was never formally a member of the Allies but became a self-styled &quot;Associated Power&quot;. The United States had a small army, but, after the passage of the [[Selective Service Act of 1917|Selective Service Act]], it drafted 2.8 million men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sss.gov/induct.htm|title=Selective Service System: History and Records|publisher=Sss.gov|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by summer 1918 was sending 10,000 fresh soldiers to France every day. In 1917, the U.S. Congress gave U.S. citizenship to Puerto Ricans when they were drafted to participate in World War I, as part of the [[Jones-Shafroth Act|Jones Act]]. Germany had miscalculated, believing it would be many more months before American soldiers would arrive and that their arrival could be stopped by U-boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wilgus|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Navy]] sent a [[United States Battleship Division Nine (World War I)|battleship group]] to [[Scapa Flow]] to join with the British Grand Fleet, [[destroyers]] to [[Cobh|Queenstown]], Ireland, and [[submarines]] to help guard convoys. Several regiments of [[U.S. Marines]] were also dispatched to France. The British and French wanted U.S. units used to reinforce their troops already on the battle lines and not waste scarce shipping on bringing over supplies. The U.S. rejected the first proposition and accepted the second. General [[John J. Pershing]], [[American Expeditionary Forces]] (AEF) commander, refused to break up U.S. units to be used as reinforcements for British Empire and French units. As an exception, he did allow African-American combat regiments to be used in French divisions. The [[Harlem Hellfighters]] fought as part of the French 16th Division, earning a unit [[Croix de guerre 1914–1918 (France)|Croix de Guerre]] for their actions at Chateau-Thierry, Belleau Wood, and Sechault.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=U.S. [[National Archives and Records Administration]]|url=http://www.archives.gov/education/lessons/369th-infantry/|title=Teaching With Documents: Photographs of the 369th Infantry and African Americans during World War I|accessdate=29 October 2009|author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

====Austrian offer of separate peace====
In 1917, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria]] secretly attempted separate peace negotiations with Clemenceau, with his wife's brother [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma|Sixtus]] in Belgium as an intermediary, without the knowledge of Germany. When the negotiations failed, his attempt was revealed to Germany, resulting in a diplomatic catastrophe.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kurlander|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shanafelt|1985|pp=125–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====German Spring Offensive of 1918====
{{Main|Spring Offensive}}
German General [[Erich Ludendorff]] drew up plans ([[Code name|codenamed]] [[Operation Michael]]) for the 1918 offensive on the Western Front. The Spring Offensive sought to divide the British and French forces with a series of feints and advances. The German leadership hoped to strike a decisive blow before significant U.S. forces arrived. The operation commenced on 21 March 1918 with an attack on British forces near [[Amiens]]. German forces achieved an unprecedented advance of {{convert|60|km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Westwell|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Prisioneiros ingleses portugueses 09 04 1918.jpg|thumb|left|British and Portuguese prisoners in 1918.]]
British and French trenches were penetrated using novel [[infiltration tactics]], also named ''Hutier'' tactics, after General [[Oskar von Hutier]]. Previously, attacks had been characterised by long artillery bombardments and massed assaults. However, in the Spring Offensive of 1918, Ludendorff used artillery only briefly and infiltrated small groups of infantry at weak points. They attacked command and logistics areas and bypassed points of serious resistance. More heavily armed infantry then destroyed these isolated positions. German success relied greatly on the element of surprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Posen|1984|pp=190&amp;191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The front moved to within {{convert|120|km|mi}} of Paris. Three heavy [[Krupp]] [[railway gun]]s fired 183&amp;nbsp;shells on the capital, causing many Parisians to flee. The initial offensive was so successful that Kaiser Wilhelm II declared 24 March a [[Public holiday|national holiday]]. Many Germans thought victory was near. After heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted. Lacking tanks or [[Self-propelled artillery|motorised artillery]], the Germans were unable to consolidate their gains. This situation was not helped by the supply lines now being stretched as a result of their advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|1991|p=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sudden stop was also a result of the four [[Australian Imperial Force]] (AIF) divisions that were &quot;rushed&quot; down, thus doing what no other army had done: stopping the German advance in its tracks. During that time the first Australian division was hurriedly sent north again to stop the second German breakthrough.

[[Ferdinand Foch|General Foch]] pressed to use the arriving American troops as individual replacements. Pershing sought instead to field American units as an independent force. These units were assigned to the depleted French and British Empire commands on 28 March. A Supreme War Council of Allied forces was created at the [[Doullens Conference]] on 5 November 1917.&lt;ref name=moon/&gt; General Foch was appointed as supreme commander of the allied forces. Haig, Petain, and Pershing retained tactical control of their respective armies; Foch assumed a coordinating rather than a directing role, and the British, French, and U.S. commands operated largely independently.&lt;ref name=moon&gt;{{harvnb|Moon|1996|pp=495–196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Operation Michael, Germany launched [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Operation Georgette]] against the northern [[English Channel]] ports. The Allies halted the drive after limited territorial gains by Germany. The German Army to the south then conducted [[Third Battle of the Aisne|Operations Blücher and Yorck]], pushing broadly towards Paris. Operation Marne was launched on 15 July, attempting to encircle [[Reims]] and beginning the [[Second Battle of the Marne]]. The resulting counterattack, starting the [[Hundred Days Offensive]], marked the first successful Allied offensive of the war.

By 20 July the Germans were back across the Marne at their Kaiserschlacht starting lines,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rickard|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; having achieved nothing. Following this last phase of the war in the West, the German Army never regained the initiative. German casualties between March and April 1918 were 270,000, including many highly trained [[Stormtrooper|storm troopers]].

Meanwhile, Germany was falling apart at home. [[Anti-war]] marches became frequent and morale in the army fell. Industrial output was 53&amp;nbsp;percent of 1913 levels.

====Ottoman Empire conflict 1918====
{{main|Sinai and Palestine Campaign}}
Early in 1918 the front line was [[Capture of Jericho (1918)|extended]] into the [[Occupation of the Jordan Valley (1918)|Jordan Valley]] which continued to be occupied, following the [[First Transjordan attack on Amman (1918)|First Transjordan]] and the [[Second Transjordan attack on Shunet Nimrin and Es Salt (1918)|Second Transjordan]] attack by British Empire forces in March and April 1918, into the summer. During March, most of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force's British infantry and [[Yeomanry]] cavalry were sent to fight on the Western Front as a consequence of the Spring Offensive. They were replaced by Indian Army units. During several months of reorganisation and training during the summer, a [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign#Summer front line operations|number of attacks]] were carried out on sections of the Ottoman front line. These pushed the front line north to more advantageous positions in preparation for an attack and to acclimatise the newly arrived Indian Army infantry. It was not until the middle of September that the integrated force was ready for large-scale operations.

The reorganised Egyptian Expeditionary Force, with an additional mounted division broke Ottoman forces at the [[Battle of Megiddo (1918)|Battle of Megiddo]] in September 1918. In two days the British and [[British Indian Army|Indian]] infantry supported by a creeping barrage broke the Ottoman front line and captured the headquarters of the [[Eighth Army (Ottoman Empire)]] at [[Battle of Tulkarm (1918)|Tulkarm]], the continuous trench lines at [[Battle of Tabsor (1918)|Tabsor]], [[Battle of Arara|Arara]] and the [[Seventh Army (Ottoman Empire)]] headquarters at [[Battle of Nablus (1918)|Nablus]]. The [[Desert Mounted Corps]] rode through the break in the front line created by the infantry and during virtually continuous operations by Australian [[Light Horse]], British [[Yeomanry|mounted Yeomanry]], Indian [[Lancers]] and New Zealand [[Mounted Riflemen|Mounted Rifle]] brigades. On the [[Jezreel Valley]] they captured [[Battle of Nazareth (1918)|Nazareth]], [[Capture of Afulah and Beisan|Afulah and Beisan]], [[Capture of Jenin (1918)|Jenin]], along with [[Battle of Haifa (1918)|Haifa]] on the Mediterranean coast and [[Daraa]] east of the Jordan River on the Hejaz railway. [[Battle of Samakh (1918)|Samakh]] and [[Tiberias]] on the [[Sea of Galilee]], were captured on the way northwards to [[Damascus]]. Meanwhile [[Third Transjordan attack (1918)|Chaytor's Force]] of Australian light horse, New Zealand mounted rifles, Indian, British West Indies and Jewish infantry captured the crossings of the [[Jordan River]], [[Salt, Jordan|Es Salt]], [[Amman]] and at Ziza most of the [[Fourth Army (Ottoman Empire)]]. The [[Armistice of Mudros]], signed at the end of October ended hostilities with the Ottoman Empire when fighting was continuing north of [[Aleppo]].

====New states under war zone====
{{main|Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Democratic Republic of Armenia|Azerbaijan Democratic Republic|Democratic Republic of Georgia}}
In the late spring of 1918, three new states were formed in the [[South Caucasus]]: the [[Democratic Republic of Armenia]], the [[Azerbaijan Democratic Republic]], and the [[Democratic Republic of Georgia]], which declared their independence from the Russian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Hovannisian|first=Richard G.|authorlink=Richard G. Hovannisian|title=Armenia on the Road to Independence, 1918|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|year=1967|isbn=0-520-00574-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other minor entities were established, the [[Centrocaspian Dictatorship]] and [[South West Caucasian Republic]] (the former was liquidated by Azerbaijan in the autumn of 1918 and the latter by a joint Armenian-British task force in early 1919). With the withdrawal of the Russian armies from the Caucasus front in the winter of 1917–18, the three major republics braced for an imminent Ottoman advance, which commenced in the early months of 1918. Solidarity was briefly maintained when the [[Transcaucasian Democratic Federative Republic|Transcaucasian Federative Republic]] was created in the spring of 1918 but collapsed in May, when the Georgians asked and received protection from Germany and the Azerbaijanis concluded a treaty with the Ottoman Empire that was more akin to a military alliance. Armenia was left to fend for itself and struggled for five months against the threat of a full-fledged occupation by the Ottoman Turks.&lt;ref&gt;See {{Citation|last=Hovannisian|first=Richard G.|title=The Republic of Armenia: The First Year, 1918–1919|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|year=1971|pages=1–39|isbn=0-520-01805-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Allied victory: summer and autumn 1918====
{{Main|Hundred Days Offensive|Weimar Republic}}
The Allied counteroffensive, known as the Hundred Days Offensive, began on 8 August 1918. The [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]] developed with III Corps [[British Fourth Army]] on the left, the [[French First Army]] on the right, and the [[Australian Corps|Australian]] and [[Canadian Corps]] spearheading the offensive in the centre through [[Harbonnières]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AWMAmiens&quot;&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/1918/battles/amiens.htm|title=The Battle of Amiens: 8 August 1918|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=12 December 2008|author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/1918/battles/amiensmap.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070617055415/http://www.awm.gov.au/1918/battles/amiensmap.htm|archivedate=17 June 2007|title=Amiens Map|publisher=Australian War Memorial|accessdate=24 October 2009|author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}} (archived 17 June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt; It involved 414 tanks of the [[Mark I tank|Mark IV]] and [[Mark V (tank)#Mark V series|Mark V]] type, and 120,000 men. They advanced {{convert|12|km|mi}} into German-held territory in just seven hours. Erich Ludendorff referred to this day as the &quot;Black Day of the German army&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AWMAmiens&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rickard|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Aerial view of ruins of Vaux, France, 1918, ca. 03-1918 - ca. 11-1918 - NARA - 512862.tif|thumb|Aerial view of ruins of [[Vaux-devant-Damloup]], France, 1918]]
The Australian-Canadian spearhead at Amiens, a battle that was the beginning of Germany's downfall,&lt;ref name=&quot;Terraine-Victory&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Terraine|1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; helped pull forward the British armies to the north and the French armies to the south. On the British Fourth Army front at Amiens, after an advance as far as {{convert|14|mi|km|0}}, German resistance stiffened, and the battle there concluded. But the French Third Army lengthened the Amiens front on 10&amp;nbsp;August, when it was thrown in on the right of the French First Army, and advanced {{convert|4|mi|km|0}}, liberating Lassigny in fighting which lasted until 16&amp;nbsp;August. South of the French Third Army, General [[Charles Mangin]] (The Butcher) drove his French Tenth Army forward at Soissons on 20 August to capture eight thousand prisoners, two hundred guns, and the Aisne heights overlooking and menacing the German position north of the Vesle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt-1918&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Pitt|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another &quot;Black day&quot;, as described by Erich Ludendorff.

[[File:Canadian Scottish at Canal du Nord Sept 1918 IWM CO 3289.jpg|thumb|left|[[16th Battalion (Canadian Scottish), CEF|Canadian Scottish]] advancing during the Battle of the Canal du Nord, September 1918]]
Meanwhile General Byng of the British Third Army, reporting that the enemy on his front was thinning in a limited withdrawal, was ordered to attack with 200 tanks towards Bapaume, opening the [[Battle of Albert (1918)|Battle of Albert]], with specific orders &quot;To break the enemy's front, in order to outflank the enemy's present battle front&quot; (opposite the British Fourth Army at Amiens).&lt;ref name=&quot;Terraine-Victory&quot;/&gt; Allied leaders had now realised that to continue an attack after resistance had hardened was a waste of lives, and it was better to turn a line than to try to roll over it. They began to undertake attacks in quick order to take advantage of successful advances on the flanks, then broke them off when each attack lost its initial impetus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt-1918&quot; /&gt;

The British Third Army's {{convert|15|mi|km|0|sing=on}} front north of Albert progressed after stalling for a day against the main resistance line to which the enemy had withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Maurice|1918}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rawlinson's British Fourth Army was able to push its left flank forward between Albert and the Somme, straightening the line between the advanced positions of the Third Army and the Amiens front, which resulted in recapturing Albert at the same time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt-1918&quot; /&gt; On 26&amp;nbsp;August the British First Army on the left of the Third Army was drawn into the battle, extending it northward to beyond Arras. The Canadian Corps, already back in the vanguard of the [[First Army (United Kingdom)|First Army]], fought its way from Arras eastward {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} astride the heavily defended Arras-Cambrai area before reaching the outer defences of the [[Hindenburg Line]], breaching them on the 28 and 29&amp;nbsp;August. Bapaume fell on 29&amp;nbsp;August to the New Zealand Division of the Third Army, and the Australians, still leading the advance of the Fourth Army, were again able to push forward at Amiens to take Peronne and [[Mont Saint-Quentin]] on 31&amp;nbsp;August. Further south, the French First and Third Armies had slowly fought forward while the Tenth Army, which had by now crossed the Ailette and was east of the Chemin des Dames, neared the Alberich position of the Hindenburg Line.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chron-FWW&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gray|Argyle|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the last week of August the pressure along a {{convert|70|mi|km|0|sing=on}} front against the enemy was heavy and unrelenting. From German accounts, &quot;Each day was spent in bloody fighting against an ever and again on-storming enemy, and nights passed without sleep in retirements to new lines.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pitt-1918&quot; /&gt; Even to the north in [[Flanders]] the British Second and Fifth Armies during August and September were able to make progress, taking prisoners and positions that had previously been denied them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chron-FWW&quot;/&gt;
[[File:American troops in Vladivostok 1918 HD-SN-99-02013.JPEG|thumb|American troops in [[Vladivostok]], Siberia, August 1918]]

On 2 September the [[Canadian Corps]]' outflanking of the Hindenburg line, with the breaching of the Wotan Position, made it possible for the Third Army to advance, which sent repercussions all along the Western Front. That same day [[Oberste Heeresleitung]] (OHL) had no choice but to issue orders to six armies to withdraw back into the Hindenburg Line in the south, behind the [[Canal du Nord]] on the Canadian-First Army's front and back to a line east of the Lys in the north. This ceded without a fight the salient seized the previous April.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nicholson|1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Erich Ludendorff|Ludendorff]] &quot;We had to admit the necessity&amp;nbsp;...to withdraw the entire front from the Scarpe to the Vesle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ludendorff&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ludendorff|1919}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:World War I Observation Balloon HD-SN-99-02269.JPEG|thumb|left|upright|Close-up view of an American major in the basket of an [[observation balloon]] flying over territory near front lines]]

In nearly four weeks of fighting beginning 8&amp;nbsp;August, over 100,000 German prisoners were taken, 75,000 by the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|BEF]] and the rest by the French. As of &quot;The Black Day of the German Army&quot;, the German High Command realised the war was lost and made attempts to reach a satisfactory end. The day after that battle Ludenforff told Colonel Mertz: &quot;We cannot win the war any more, but we must not lose it either.&quot; On 11&amp;nbsp;August he offered his resignation to the Kaiser, who refused it, replying, &quot;I see that we must strike a balance. We have nearly reached the limit of our powers of resistance. The war must be ended.&quot; On 13 August at [[Spa, Belgium|Spa]], Hindenburg, Ludendorff, the Chancellor, and Foreign Minister Hintz agreed that the war could not be ended militarily, and on the following day the German Crown Council decided that victory in the field was now most improbable. Austria and Hungary warned that they could only continue the war until December, and Ludendorff recommended immediate peace negotiations, to which the Kaiser responded by instructing Hintz to seek the mediation of the Queen of the Netherlands. Prince Rupprecht warned Prince Max of Baden: &quot;Our military situation has deteriorated so rapidly that I no longer believe we can hold out over the winter; it is even possible that a catastrophe will come earlier.&quot; On 10&amp;nbsp;September Hindenburg urged peace moves to Emperor Charles of Austria, and Germany appealed to the Netherlands for mediation. On 14&amp;nbsp;September Austria sent a note to all belligerents and neutrals suggesting a meeting for peace talks on neutral soil, and on 15&amp;nbsp;September Germany made a peace offer to Belgium. Both peace offers were rejected, and on 24&amp;nbsp;September [[Oberste Heeresleitung|OHL]] informed the leaders in Berlin that armistice talks were inevitable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chron-FWW&quot;/&gt;

September saw the Germans continuing to fight strong rear-guard actions and launching numerous counterattacks on lost positions, but only a few succeeded, and then only temporarily. Contested towns, villages, heights, and trenches in the screening positions and outposts of the Hindenburg Line continued to fall to the Allies, with the BEF alone taking 30,441&amp;nbsp;prisoners in the last week of September. Further small advances eastward would follow the Third Army's victory at Ivincourt on 12&amp;nbsp;September, the Fourth Army's at Epheny on 18&amp;nbsp;September, and the French gain of [[Essigny-le-Grand]] a day later. On 24&amp;nbsp;September a final assault by both the British and French on a {{convert|4|mi|km|adj=on}} front would come within {{convert|2|mi|km}} of St. Quentin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chron-FWW&quot;/&gt; With the outposts and preliminary defensive lines of the Siegfried and Alberich Positions eliminated, the Germans were now completely back in the Hindenburg Line. With the Wotan position of that line already breached and the Siegfried position in danger of being turned from the north, the time had now come for an Allied assault on the whole length of the line.

The Allied [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive|attack on the Hindenburg Line]], begun on 26&amp;nbsp;September, included U.S. soldiers. The still-green American troops suffered problems coping with supply trains for large units on a difficult landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jenkins|2009|p=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week cooperating French and American units broke through in [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] at the [[Battle of Blanc Mont Ridge]], forcing the Germans off the commanding heights, and closing towards the Belgian frontier.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|McLellan|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last Belgian town to be liberated before the armistice was Ghent, which the Germans held as a pivot until the Allies brought up artillery.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gibbs|1918b}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gibbs|1918a}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German army had to shorten its front and use the Dutch frontier as an anchor to fight rear-guard actions.
[[File:US 64th regiment celebrate the Armistice.jpg|thumb|Men of U.S. 64th Regiment, [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]], celebrate the news of the Armistice, 11 November 1918]]
When Bulgaria signed a separate armistice on 29&amp;nbsp;September, the Allies gained control of Serbia and Greece. Ludendorff, having been under great stress for months, suffered something similar to a breakdown. It was evident that Germany could no longer mount a successful defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stevenson|2004|p=380}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hull|2006|pp=307–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, news of Germany's impending military defeat spread throughout the German armed forces. The threat of mutiny was rife. Admiral [[Reinhard Scheer]] and Ludendorff decided to launch a last attempt to restore the &quot;valour&quot; of the German Navy. Knowing the government of [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]] would veto any such action, Ludendorff decided not to inform him. Nonetheless, word of the impending assault reached sailors at [[Kiel]]. Many, refusing to be part of a naval offensive which they believed to be suicidal, rebelled and were arrested. Ludendorff took the blame; the Kaiser dismissed him on 26&amp;nbsp;October. The collapse of the Balkans meant that Germany was about to lose its main supplies of oil and food. Its reserves had been used up, even as U.S. troops kept arriving at the rate of 10,000 per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stevenson|2004|p=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having suffered over 6&amp;nbsp;million casualties, Germany moved towards peace. [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]] took charge of a new government as Chancellor of Germany to negotiate with the Allies. Telegraphic negotiations with President Wilson began immediately, in the vain hope that he would offer better terms than the British and French. Instead Wilson demanded the abdication of the Kaiser. There was no resistance when the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]] [[Philipp Scheidemann]] on 9&amp;nbsp;November declared Germany to be a republic. Imperial Germany was dead; a new Germany had been born: the [[Weimar Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Stevenson|2004|ch=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collapse of the Central Powers came swiftly. Bulgaria was the first to sign an armistice, on 29 September 1918 at [[Saloniki]].&lt;ref name=&quot;indiana.edu-1918&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiana.edu/~league/1918.htm|work=League of Nations Photo Archive|title=1918 Timeline|accessdate=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 October, the Ottoman Empire capitulated at [[Moudros]] ([[Armistice of Mudros]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;indiana.edu-1918&quot;/&gt;

On 24 October, the Italians began a push which rapidly recovered territory lost after the [[Battle of Caporetto]]. This culminated in the [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto]], which marked the end of the Austro-Hungarian Army as an effective fighting force. The offensive also triggered the disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. During the last week of October, declarations of independence were made in Budapest, Prague, and Zagreb. On 29 October, the imperial authorities asked Italy for an armistice. But the Italians continued advancing, reaching Trento, Udine, and Trieste. On 3 November Austria–Hungary sent a [[White flag|flag of truce]] to ask for an [[Armistice]]. The terms, arranged by telegraph with the Allied Authorities in Paris, were communicated to the Austrian commander and accepted. The [[Armistice of Villa Giusti|Armistice with Austria]] was signed in the Villa Giusti, near [[Padua]], on 3 November. Austria and Hungary signed separate armistices following the overthrow of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]].

Following the outbreak of the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]], a republic was proclaimed on 9 November. The [[Kaiser]] fled to the Netherlands. 

On 11 November at 5:00 am, an [[armistice with Germany]] was signed in a railroad carriage at [[Compiègne]]. At 11&amp;nbsp;am on 11 November 1918 — &quot;the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month&quot; — a ceasefire came into effect. During the six hours between the signing of the armistice and its taking effect, opposing armies on the Western Front began to withdraw from their positions, but fighting continued along many areas of the front, as commanders wanted to capture territory before the war ended. Canadian Private [[George Lawrence Price]] was shot by a German sniper at 10:57 and died at 10:58.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Lindsay|first=Robert|url=http://www.nwbattalion.com/last.html|title=The Last Hours|work=28th (Northwest) Battalion Headquarters|accessdate=20 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; American [[Henry Gunther]] was killed 60 seconds before the armistice came into force while charging astonished German troops who were aware the Armistice was nearly upon them.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Gunther|first=Henry|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/7696021.stm|title=[[BBC News|BBC Magazine]]|date=Wednesday 29, 2008|accessdate=6 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last British soldier to die was [[armistice with Germany|Pte George Edwin Ellison]].

The occupying armies consisted of American, Belgian, British and French forces.

=====Allied superiority and the stab-in-the-back legend, November 1918=====
In November 1918 the Allies had ample supplies of men and [[materiel]] to invade Germany. Yet at the time of the armistice, no Allied force had crossed the German frontier; the Western Front was still almost {{convert|900|mi|km|abbr=on}} from Berlin; and the Kaiser's armies had retreated from the battlefield in good order. These factors enabled Hindenburg and other senior German leaders to spread the story that their armies had not really been defeated. This resulted in the [[stab-in-the-back legend]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baker|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chickering|2004|pp=185–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; which attributed Germany's defeat not to its inability to continue fighting (even though up to a million soldiers were suffering from the [[1918 flu pandemic]] and unfit to fight), but to the public's failure to respond to its &quot;patriotic calling&quot; and the supposed intentional sabotage of the war effort, particularly by Jews, Socialists, and Bolsheviks.

===Treaty of Versailles, June 1919===
A formal state of war between the two sides persisted for another seven months, until the signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] with Germany on 28 June 1919. However, the American public opposed ratification of the treaty, mainly because of the [[League of Nations]] the treaty created; the U.S. did not formally end its involvement in the war until the [[Knox–Porter Resolution]] was signed in 1921. After the Treaty of Versailles, treaties with Austria, Hungary, Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire were signed. However, the negotiation of the latter treaty with the Ottoman Empire was followed by strife (the [[Turkish War of Independence]]), and a final peace treaty between the Allied Powers and the country that would shortly become the Republic of Turkey was not signed until 24 July 1923, at [[Treaty of Lausanne|Lausanne]].

Some [[war memorial]]s date the end of the war as being when the Versailles Treaty was signed in 1919, which was when many of the troops serving abroad finally returned to their home countries; by contrast, most commemorations of the war's end concentrate on the armistice of 11 November 1918. Legally, the formal peace treaties were not complete until the last, the Treaty of Lausanne, was signed. Under its terms, the Allied forces divested [[Constantinople]] on 23 August 1923.

==Technology==
{{See also|Technology during World War I|Weapons of World War I}}

[[File:Armoured car.jpg|thumb|Armoured cars]]
[[Image:mustard gas burns.jpg|thumb|A Canadian soldier with [[mustard gas]] burns, ca. 1917–1918.]]
The First World War began as a clash of 20th-century technology and 19th-century [[military tactics|tactics]], with the inevitably large ensuing casualties. By the end of 1917, however, the major armies, now numbering millions of men, had modernised and were making use of telephone, [[Wireless|wireless communication]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hartcup|1988|p=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Armored car (military)|armoured cars]], [[tanks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hartcup|1988|pp=82–86}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aircraft. Infantry formations were reorganised, so that 100-man companies were no longer the main unit of manoeuvre; instead, squads of 10 or so men, under the command of a junior NCO, were favoured.

Artillery also underwent a revolution. In 1914, cannons were positioned in the front line and fired directly at their targets. By 1917, [[indirect fire]] with guns (as well as mortars and even machine guns) was commonplace, using new techniques for spotting and ranging, notably aircraft and the often overlooked [[field telephone]]. [[Counter-battery fire|Counter-battery]] missions became commonplace, also, and sound detection was used to locate enemy batteries.

Germany was far ahead of the Allies in utilising heavy indirect fire. The German Army employed 150 and 210&amp;nbsp;mm [[howitzer]]s in 1914, when typical French and British guns were only 75 and 105&amp;nbsp;mm. The British had a 6&amp;nbsp;inch (152&amp;nbsp;mm) howitzer, but it was so heavy it had to be hauled to the field in pieces and assembled. Germans also fielded Austrian 305&amp;nbsp;mm and 420&amp;nbsp;mm guns, and already by the beginning of the war had inventories of various calibers of ''[[Minenwerfer]]'' ideally suited for trench warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mosier|2001|pp=42–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the combat involved [[trench warfare]], in which hundreds often died for each yard gained. Many of the deadliest battles in history occurred during the First World War. Such battles include [[Battle of Passchendaele|Ypres]], the [[First Battle of the Marne|Marne]], [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Cambrai]], the [[Battle of the Somme|Somme]], [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]], and [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]]. The Germans employed the [[Haber process]] of [[nitrogen fixation]] to provide their forces with a constant supply of gunpowder, despite the British naval blockade.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harcup|1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artillery was responsible for the largest number of casualties&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raudzens|p=421}}&lt;/ref&gt; and consumed vast quantities of explosives. The large number of head wounds caused by exploding shells and [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|fragmentation]] forced the combatant nations to develop the modern steel [[helmet]], led by the French, who introduced the [[Adrian helmet]] in 1915. It was quickly followed by the [[Brodie helmet]], worn by British Imperial and U.S. troops, and in 1916 by the distinctive German ''[[Stahlhelm]]'', a design, with improvements, still in use today.

The widespread use of chemical warfare was a distinguishing feature of the conflict. Gases used included [[chlorine]], [[mustard gas]] and [[phosgene]]. Few war casualties were caused by gas,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Raudzens}}&lt;/ref&gt; as effective countermeasures to gas attacks were quickly created, such as [[gas mask]]s. The use of [[chemical warfare]] and small-scale [[Aerial bombing of cities|strategic bombing]] were both outlawed by the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|1907 Hague Conventions]], and both proved to be of limited effectiveness,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heller|1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; though they captured the public imagination.&lt;ref&gt;Postwar pulp novels on future &quot;gas wars&quot; included Reginald Glossop's 1932 novel ''Ghastly Dew'' and Neil Bell's 1931 novel ''The Gas War of 1940''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most powerful land-based weapons were [[railway gun]]s weighing hundreds of tons apiece. These were nicknamed [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|Big Berthas]], even though the namesake was not a railway gun. Germany developed the [[Paris Gun]], able to bombard Paris from over {{convert|100|km|mi}}, though shells were relatively light at 94&amp;nbsp;kilograms (210&amp;nbsp;lb). While the Allies also had railway guns, German models severely out-ranged and out-classed them.

===Aviation===
:{{main|Aviation in World War I}}
[[File:Sopwith F-1 Camel.jpg|thumb|[[RAF]] [[Sopwith Camel]]. In April 1917, the average life expectancy of a British pilot on the Western Front was 93 flying hours.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Lawson, Jane Lawson (2002). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=9PGHckhHiX0C&amp;pg=PT123 The First Air Campaign: August 1914– November 1918]''&quot;. Da Capo Press. p.123. ISBN 0-306-81213-4&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Fixed-wing aircraft]] were first used militarily by the Italians in Libya on 23 October 1911 during the [[Italo-Turkish War]] for reconnaissance, soon followed by the dropping of grenades and [[aerial photography]] the next year. By 1914 their military utility was obvious. They were initially used for [[reconnaissance]] and [[Close air support|ground attack]]. To shoot down enemy planes, anti-aircraft guns and [[fighter aircraft]] were developed. [[Strategic bombers]] were created, principally by the Germans and British, though the former used [[Zeppelin]]s as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cross 1991&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cross|1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the conflict, [[aircraft carrier]]s were used for the first time, with [[HMS Furious (47)|HMS ''Furious'']] launching [[Sopwith Camels]] in [[Tondern raid|a raid]] to destroy the Zeppelin hangars at [[Tondern]] in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cross|1991|pp=56–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manned [[observation balloon]]s, floating high above the trenches, were used as stationary reconnaissance platforms, reporting enemy movements and directing artillery. Balloons commonly had a crew of two, equipped with [[parachute]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Winter|1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that if there was an enemy air attack the crew could parachute to safety. (At the time, parachutes were too heavy to be used by pilots of aircraft (with their marginal power output), and smaller versions were not developed until the end of the war; they were also opposed by British leadership, who feared they might promote cowardice.)&lt;ref name=FullCircle&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Battle of Messines - destroyed German trench.jpg|thumb|German trench destroyed by a [[Tunnel warfare|mine explosion]]. Approximately 10,000 German troops were killed when the 19 mines were simultaneously detonated.]]
Recognised for their value as observation platforms, balloons were important targets of enemy aircraft. To defend them against air attack, they were heavily protected by antiaircraft guns and patrolled by friendly aircraft; to attack them, unusual weapons such as air-to-air rockets were even tried. Thus, the reconnaissance value of blimps and balloons contributed to the development of air-to-air combat between all types of aircraft, and to the trench stalemate, because it was impossible to move large numbers of troops undetected. The Germans conducted air raids on England during 1915 and 1916 with airships, hoping to damage British morale and cause aircraft to be diverted from the front lines, and indeed the resulting panic led to the diversion of several squadrons of fighters from France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cross 1991&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=FullCircle /&gt;

===Improvements in naval technology during World War I===
Germany deployed [[U-boat]]s ([[submarines]]) after the war began. Alternating between restricted and unrestricted submarine warfare in the Atlantic, the [[Kaiserliche Marine]] employed them to deprive the British Isles of vital supplies. The deaths of British merchant sailors and the seeming invulnerability of U-boats led to the development of depth charges (1916), [[hydrophone]]s (passive [[sonar]], 1917), [[blimp]]s, [[hunter-killer submarine]]s ([[British R class submarine|HMS ''R-1'']], 1917), forward-throwing [[anti-submarine weapon]]s, and dipping hydrophones (the latter two both abandoned in 1918).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Price|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; To extend their operations, the Germans proposed supply submarines (1916). Most of these would be forgotten in the [[interwar period]] until World War II revived the need.

===Improvements in ground warfare technology in World War I===
[[File:Vickers IWW.jpg|thumb|British [[Vickers machine gun]]]]
Trenches, machine guns, air reconnaissance, barbed wire, and modern artillery with fragmentation [[Shell (projectile)|shells]] helped bring the battle lines of World War I to a stalemate. The British and the French sought a solution with the creation of the tank and [[mechanised warfare]]. The British [[Mark I (tank)|first tanks]] were used during the [[Battle of the Somme]] on 15 September 1916. Mechanical reliability was an issue, but the experiment proved its worth. Within a year, the British were fielding tanks by the hundreds, and they showed their potential during the [[Battle of Cambrai (1917)|Battle of Cambrai]] in November 1917, by breaking the Hindenburg Line, while [[combined arms]] teams captured 8000 enemy soldiers and 100&amp;nbsp;guns. Meanwhile the French introduced the first tanks with rotating turred, the Renault FT-A7, which became a decisive tool of the victory. The conflict also saw the introduction of [[Light machine gun|Light automatic weapons]] and [[submachine guns]], such as the [[Lewis Gun]], the [[Browning Automatic Rifle|Browning automatic rifle]], and the [[Bergmann MP18]].

===Flamethrowers and subterranean transport===
Another new weapon, the [[flamethrower]], was first used by the German army and later adopted by other forces. Although not of high tactical value, the flamethrower was a powerful, demoralising weapon that caused terror on the battlefield. It was a dangerous weapon to wield, as its heavy weight made operators vulnerable targets.

[[Trench railways]] evolved to supply the enormous quantities of food, water, and ammunition required to support large numbers of soldiers in areas where conventional transportation systems had been destroyed. Internal combustion engines and improved traction systems for automobiles and trucks/lorries eventually rendered trench railways obsolete.

===&quot;Rape of Belgium&quot;===
{{Main|Rape of Belgium}}
The German invaders treated any resistance—such as sabotaging rail lines—as illegal and immoral, and shot the offenders and burned buildings in retaliation. In addition they tended to suspect most civilians to be potential &quot;franc-tireurs&quot;, and accordingly took  and sometimes killed hostages among the civilian population.  The German army executed over 6,500 French and Belgian civilians between August and November 1914, usually in near-random large-scale shootings of civilians ordered by junior German officers. The German Army destroyed 15,000–20,000 buildings—most famously the university library at [[Louvain]]—and generated a refugee wave of over a million people. Over half the German regiments in Belgium were involved in major incidents.&lt;ref&gt;John Horne and Alan Kramer, ''German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial'' (Yale U.P. 2001) ch 1–2, esp. p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of workers were shipped to Germany to work in factories. British propaganda dramatizing the &quot;[[Rape of Belgium]]&quot; attracted much attention in the U.S., while Berlin said it was legal and necessary because of the threat of &quot;franc-tireurs&quot; (guerrillas) like those in France in 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Horne and Kramer, ''German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial'' ch 3–4 show there were no &quot;franc-tireurs&quot; in Belgium.&lt;/ref&gt; The British and French magnified the reports and disseminated them at home and in the U.S., where they played a major role in dissolving support for Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Horne and Kramer, ''German Atrocities, 1914: A History of Denial'' ch 5–8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keegan|1998|pp=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The soldiers of the war were initially volunteers, except for those of Italy, but increasingly were [[conscription|conscripted]] into service. Britain's [[Imperial War Museum]] has collected more than 2,500&amp;nbsp;recordings of soldiers' personal accounts, and selected transcripts, edited by military author [[Max Arthur]], have been published. The Museum believes that historians have not taken full account of this material, and accordingly has made the full archive of recordings available to authors and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Forgotten Voices of the Great War|publisher=[[Imperial War Museum]]|url=http://www.forgottenvoices.co.uk/|accessdate=30 March 2008|author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surviving veterans, returning home, often found that they could only discuss their experiences amongst themselves.

===Prisoners of war===
{{Main|World War I prisoners of war in Germany}}
[[File:German prisoners in a French prison camp. French Pictorial Service., 1917 - 1919 - NARA - 533724.tif|thumb|210px|German prisoners in a French prison camp]]
About 8 million men surrendered and were held in [[Pow camp|POW camps]] during the war. All nations pledged to follow the [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague Conventions]] on fair treatment of [[prisoners of war]]. POWs' rate of survival was generally much higher than that of their peers at the front.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phillimore|Bellot|1919|pp=4–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual surrenders were uncommon; large units usually surrendered en masse. At the [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]] 92,000&amp;nbsp;Russians surrendered. When the besieged garrison of [[Kaunas]] surrendered in 1915, some 20,000&amp;nbsp;Russians became prisoners. Over half of Russian losses (as a proportion of those captured, wounded, or killed) were to prisoner status; for Austria-Hungary 32%, for Italy 26%, for France 12%, for Germany 9%; for Britain 7%. Prisoners from the Allied armies totalled about 1.4&amp;nbsp;million (not including Russia, which lost 2.-3.5{{clarify|2-point-what? Does this mean 2.5–3.5? Or 2 million to 3.5?|date=October 2010}} million men as prisoners.) From the Central Powers about 3.3&amp;nbsp;million men became prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferguson|1999|pp=368–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Germany held 2.5&amp;nbsp;million prisoners; Russia held 2.9&amp;nbsp;million; while Britain and France held about 720,000. Most were captured just prior to the Armistice. The U.S. held 48,000. The most dangerous moment was the act of surrender, when helpless soldiers were sometimes gunned down.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blair|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cook|2006|pp=637&amp;-665}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once prisoners reached a camp, conditions were, in general, satisfactory (and much better than in World War II), thanks in part to the efforts of the [[International Red Cross]] and inspections by neutral nations. However, conditions were terrible in Russia: [[starvation]] was common for prisoners and civilians alike; about 15–20% of the prisoners in Russia died. In Germany, food was scarce, but only 5% died.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Speed|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ferguson|1999|ch=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morton|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many were in very bad condition when captured, Ottoman officers forced them to march {{convert|1100|km|mi|0}} to [[Anatolia]]. A survivor said: &quot;We were driven along like beasts; to drop out was to die.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.awm.gov.au/stolenyears/ww1/turkey/story2.asp|publisher=Australian War Memorial|work=Stolen Years: Australian Prisoners of War|title=Prisoners of Turkey: Men of Kut ''Driven along like beasts''|accessdate=10 December 2008|author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; The survivors were then forced to build a railway through the [[Taurus Mountains]].

In Russia, when the prisoners from the [[Czech Legion]] of the Austro-Hungarian army were released in 1917, they re-armed themselves and briefly became a military and diplomatic force during the Russian Civil War.

While the Allied prisoners of the Central Powers were quickly sent home at the end of active hostilities, the same treatment was not granted to Central Power prisoners of the Allies and Russia, many of whom served as [[forced labor]], e.g., in France until 1920. They were released only after many approaches by the Red Cross to the [[Allied Supreme Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrc.org/Web/Eng/siteeng0.nsf/html/57JQGQ|title=ICRC in WWI: overview of activities|publisher=Icrc.org|accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; German prisoners were still being held in Russia as late as 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Monday, 1 Sep 1924|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,768983,00.html|title=GERMANY: Notes, Sep. 1, 1924|work=Time|date=1 September 1924|accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military attachés and war correspondents===
{{Main|Military attachés and war correspondents in the First World War}}
Military and civilian observers from every major power closely followed the course of the war. Many were able to report on events from a perspective somewhat akin to modern &quot;[[embedded journalist|embedded]]&quot; positions within the opposing land and naval forces. These military attachés and other observers prepared voluminous first-hand accounts of the war and analytical papers.

For example, former U.S. Army Captain [[Granville Roland Fortescue|Granville Fortescue]] followed the developments of the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] from an embedded perspective within the ranks of the Turkish defenders; and his report was passed through Turkish censors before being printed in London and New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fortescue|28 October 1915|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this observer's role was abandoned when the U.S. entered the war, as Fortescue immediately re-enlisted, sustaining wounds at [[Forest of Argonne]] in the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]], September 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Arlington National Cemetery|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/fortesc.htm|title=Granville Roland Fortescue|accessdate=17 November 2009|author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In-depth observer narratives of the war and more narrowly focused professional journal articles were written soon after the war; and these post-war reports conclusively illustrated the battlefield destructiveness of this conflict. This was not the first time the tactics of entrenched positions for infantry defended with machine guns and artillery became vitally important. The [[Russo-Japanese War]] had been closely observed by military attachés, war correspondents and other observers; but, from a 21st century perspective, it is now apparent that a range of tactical lessons were disregarded or not used in the preparations for war in Europe and throughout the Great War.&lt;ref name=&quot;sizemore1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sisemore|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support and opposition to the war==
{{Main|Opposition to World War I|French Army Mutinies (1917)}}

===Support===
[[File:Old england first.jpg|thumb|upright|Old England first, self second 1916]]
In the Balkans, [[Yugoslav nationalism|Yugoslav nationalists]] such as the leader [[Ante Trumbić]] in the [[Balkans]] strongly supported the war, desiring the freedom of [[Yugoslavs]] from [[Austria-Hungary]] and other foreign powers and the creation of an independent [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=1189}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yugoslav Committee]] was formed in Paris on 30 April 1915 but shortly moved its office to London; Trumbić led the Committee.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

In the Middle East, [[Arab nationalism]] soared in Ottoman territories in response to the rise of Turkish nationalism during the war, with Arab nationalist leaders advocating the creation of a [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] state.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, the [[Arab Revolt]] began in Ottoman-controlled territories of the Middle East in an effort to achieve independence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

[[Italian nationalism]] was stirred by the outbreak of the war and was initially strongly supported by a variety of political factions. One of the most prominent and popular Italian nationalist supporters of the war was [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]], who promoted [[Italian irredentism]] and helped sway the Italian public to support intervention in the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Italian Liberal Party]] under the leadership of [[Paolo Boselli]] promoted intervention in the war on the side of the Allies and utilised the [[Dante Aligheri Society]] to promote Italian nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of socialist parties initially supported the war when it began in August 1914.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=1001}}&lt;/ref&gt; But European socialists split on national lines, with the concept of [[class conflict]] held by radical socialists such as Marxists and [[Syndicalism|syndicalists]] being overborne by their patriotic support for war.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=1069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the war began, Austrian, British, French, German, and Russian socialists followed the rising nationalist current by supporting their countries' intervention in the war.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=884}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Italian socialists were divided on whether to support the war or oppose it; some were militant supporters of the war, including [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Leonida Bissolati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[Italian Socialist Party]] decided to oppose the war after anti-militarist protestors were killed, resulting in a [[general strike]] called [[Red Week (Italy)|Red Week]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=596}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian Socialist Party purged itself of pro-war nationalist members, including Mussolini.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; Mussolini, a [[Syndicalism|syndicalist]] who supported the war on grounds of irredentist claims on Italian-populated regions of Austria-Hungary, formed the pro-interventionist ''[[Il Popolo d'Italia]]'' and the ''Fasci Riviluzionario d'Azione Internazionalista'' (&quot;Revolutionary [[Fasci]] for International Action&quot;) in October 1914 that later developed into the ''[[Fasci di Combattimento]]'' in 1919, the origin of fascism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=826}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mussolini's nationalism enabled him to raise funds from [[Italian Ansaldo company|Ansaldo]] (an armaments firm) and other companies to create ''Il Popolo d'Italia'' to convince socialists and revolutionaries to support the war.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Mack Smith. 1997. ''Modern Italy; A Political History''. Ann Arbor: The University of Michigan Press. Pp. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1918 the Rome Congress of Oppressed Nationalities met, including [[Czechoslovak]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Poles|Polish]], [[Transylvanian]], and [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] representatives who urged the Allies to support national [[self-determination]] for the peoples residing within [[Austria-Hungary]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

===Opposition===
[[File:Horace Smith-Dorrien LOC.jpg|thumb|180px|Shortly before the war, British General [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]] predicted a catastrophic war which should be avoided at ''almost any cost''.]]
The trade union and socialist movements had long voiced their opposition to a war, which they argued would mean only that workers would kill other workers in the interest of capitalism. Once war was declared, however, many socialists and trade unions backed their governments. Among the exceptions were the [[Bolshevik]]s, the [[Socialist Party of America]], and the [[Italian Socialist Party]], and individuals such as [[Karl Liebknecht]], [[Rosa Luxemburg]], and their followers in Germany. There were also small anti-war groups in Britain and France.

[[Benedict XV]], elected to the papacy less than three months into World War I, made the war and its consequences the main focus of his early pontificate. In stark contrast to his [[Pius X|predecessor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=History of the Church|year=1981|publisher=Burns &amp; Oates|location=London|isbn=0-86012-091-0|coauthors=Margit Resch (tr.), John Dolan|volume=9|series-title=The Church in the industrial age|author=Roger Aubert|series-editor=Hubert Jedin|page=521|chapter=Chapter 37: The Outbreak of World War I|author-separator=,|display-authors=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; five days after his election he spoke of his determination to do what he could to bring peace. His first encyclical, [[Ad Beatissimi Apostolorum]], given 1 November 1914, was concerned with this subject. Seen as being biased in favour of the other and resented for weakening national morale, Benedict XV found his abilities and unique position as a religious emissary of peace ignored by the belligerent powers.

[[File:Sackville Street (Dublin) after the 1916 Easter Rising.JPG|thumb|left|Sackville Street (now [[O'Connell Street]]), Dublin, after the 1916 [[Easter Rising]]]]
The 1915 Treaty of London between Italy and the Triple Entente included secret provisions whereby the Allies agreed with Italy to ignore papal peace moves towards the Central Powers. Consequently, the publication of Benedict's proposed seven-point Peace Note of August 1917 was roundly ignored by all parties except Austria-Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Who's Who&amp;nbsp;— Pope Benedict XV|publisher=firstworldwar.com|date=Saturday, 22 August 2009|url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/popebenedict.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], in 1914, the [[Public Schools Act 1868|Public Schools]] [[Officers' Training Corps]] annual camp was held at Tidworth Pennings, near [[Salisbury Plain]]. Head of the [[British Army]] [[Lord Kitchener of Khartoum|Lord Kitchener]] was to review the [[cadet]]s, but the imminence of the war prevented him. General [[Horace Smith-Dorrien]] was sent instead. He surprised the two-or-three thousand cadets by declaring (in the words of Donald Christopher Smith, a [[Bermuda|Bermudian]] cadet who was present), ''that war should be avoided at almost any cost, that war would solve nothing, that the whole of Europe and more besides would be reduced to ruin, and that the loss of life would be so large that whole populations would be decimated. In our ignorance I, and many of us, felt almost ashamed of a British General who uttered such depressing and unpatriotic sentiments, but during the next four years, those of us who survived the holocaust—probably not more than one-quarter of us—learned how right the General's prognosis was and how courageous he had been to utter it.''&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;Merely For the Record&quot;: The Memoirs of Donald Christopher Smith 1894–1980''. By Donald Christopher Smith. Edited by John William Cox, Jr. Bermuda.&lt;/ref&gt; Voicing these sentiments did not hinder Smith-Dorien's career, or prevent him from doing his duty in World War I to the best of his abilities.

Many countries jailed those who spoke out against the conflict. These included [[Eugene Debs]] in the United States and [[Bertrand Russell]] in Britain. In the U.S., the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and [[Sedition Act of 1918]] made it a federal crime to oppose military recruitment or make any statements deemed &quot;disloyal&quot;. Publications at all critical of the government were removed from circulation by postal censors,&lt;ref name=&quot;Karp-PoW-1979&quot;/&gt; and many served long prison sentences for statements of fact deemed unpatriotic.

A number of nationalists opposed intervention, particularly within states that the nationalists were hostile to. Although the vast majority of Irish people consented to participate in the war in 1914 and 1915, a minority of advanced [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]] staunchly opposed taking part.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Pennell|first=Catriona|title=A Kingdom United: Popular Responses to the Outbreak of the First World War in Britain and Ireland|year=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0199590582}}&lt;/ref&gt; The war began amid the Home Rule crisis in Ireland that had resurfaced in 1912, and by July 1914 there was a serious possibility of an outbreak of civil war in Ireland.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|p=584}}&lt;/ref&gt; Irish nationalists and Marxists attempted to pursue Irish independence, culminating in the [[Easter Rising]] of 1916, with Germany sending 20,000 rifles to Ireland in order to stir unrest in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5 /&gt; The UK government placed Ireland under [[martial law]] in response to the Easter Rising, although once the immediate threat of revolution had dissipated the authorities did try to make concessions to nationalist feeling.&lt;ref&gt;O'Halpin, Eunan, ''The decline of the union: British government in Ireland, 1892–1920'', (Dublin, 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other opposition came from [[conscientious objector]]s&amp;nbsp;– some socialist, some religious&amp;nbsp;– who refused to fight. In Britain 16,000 people asked for conscientious objector status.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lehmann|1999|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them, most notably prominent peace activist [[Stephen Henry Hobhouse]], refused both military and alternative service.&lt;ref&gt;Brock, Peter, ''These Strange Criminals: An Anthology of Prison Memoirs by Conscientious Objectors to Military Service from the Great War to the Cold War'', p. 14, Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2004, ISBN 0802087078&lt;/ref&gt; Many suffered years of prison, including [[solitary confinement]] and bread and water diets. Even after the war, in Britain many job advertisements were marked &quot;No conscientious objectors need apply&quot;.

The [[Central Asian Revolt]] started in the summer of 1916, when the [[Russian Empire]] government ended its exemption of Muslims from military service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-12499.html Uzbeks].

In 1917, a series of [[French Army Mutinies (1917)|mutinies in the French army]] led to dozens of soldiers being executed and many more imprisoned.

In [[Milan]] in May 1917, [[Bolshevik]] revolutionaries organised and engaged in rioting calling for an end to the war, and managed to close down factories and stop public transportation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seton_6&quot;&gt;Seton-Watson, Christopher. 1967.

In 1917, Emperor [[Charles I of Austria]] secretly entered into peace negotiations with the Allied powers, with his brother-in-law [[Prince Sixtus of Bourbon-Parma|Sixtus]] as intermediary, without the knowledge of his ally Germany. He failed, however, because of the resistance of Italy.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/106679/Charles-I#ref214141 Charles (I) (emperor of Austria)]&quot;. &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1917, [[Russian Expeditionary Force in France|Russian soldiers in France]] began questioning why they were fighting for the French at all and mutinied.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cockfield|1997|pp=171–237}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, opposition to the war led to soldiers also establishing their own revolutionary committees, which helped foment the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, with the call going up for &quot;bread, land, and peace&quot;. The Bolsheviks agreed to a peace treaty with Germany, the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|peace of Brest-Litovsk]], despite its harsh conditions.

In northern [[German Empire|Germany]], the end of October 1918, saw the beginning of the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]]. Units of the German Navy refused to set sail for a last, large-scale operation in a war which they saw as good as lost; this initiated the uprising. The [[Wilhelmshaven mutiny|sailors' revolt]] which then ensued in the naval ports of [[Wilhelmshaven]] and [[Kiel]] spread across the whole country within days and led to the proclamation of a republic on 9 November 1918 and shortly thereafter to the abdication of [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]].

====Conscription====
As the war slowly turned into a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]], [[conscription]] was implemented in some countries. This issue was particularly explosive in Canada and Australia. In the former it opened a political gap between [[French Canadian]]s, who believed their true loyalty should be to Canada and not to the British Empire, and members of the Anglophone majority, who saw the war as a duty to both Britain and Canada. Prime Minister [[Robert Borden]] pushed through a [[Military Service Act (Canada)|Military Service Act]], provoking the [[Conscription Crisis of 1917]]. In Australia, a sustained pro-conscription campaign by Prime Minister [[Billy Hughes]] caused a split in the [[Australian Labor Party]], so Hughes formed the [[Nationalist Party of Australia]] in 1917 to pursue the matter. Nevertheless, the [[labour movement]], the Catholic Church, and [[Irish republican|Irish nationalist]] expatriates successfully opposed Hughes' push, which was [[Australian plebiscite, 1917|rejected in two plebiscites]].

Conscription put into uniform nearly every physically fit man in Britain, six of ten million eligible. Of these, about 750,000 lost their lives and 1,700,000 were wounded. Most deaths were to young unmarried men; however, 160,000 wives lost husbands and 300,000 children lost fathers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Havighurst|1985|p=131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No other war had changed the map of Europe so dramatically. Four empires disappeared: the German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, and Russian. Four dynasties, together with their ancillary aristocracies, all fell after the war: the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollerns]], the [[Habsburg]]s, the [[Romanov]]s, and the [[Ottoman Dynasty|Ottomans]]. Belgium and Serbia were badly damaged, as was France, with 1.4&amp;nbsp;million soldiers dead,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7199127.stm &quot;France's oldest WWI veteran dies&quot;], ''BBC News'', 20 Jan 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; not counting other casualties.

The war had profound economic consequences. Of the 60&amp;nbsp;million European soldiers who were mobilised from 1914 to 1918, 8&amp;nbsp;million were killed, 7&amp;nbsp;million were permanently disabled, and 15&amp;nbsp;million were seriously injured.

In Australia the effects of the war on the economy were no less severe.

The social disruption and widespread violence of the [[Revolution of 1917]] and the ensuing [[Russian Civil War]] sparked more than 2,000 [[pogrom]]s in the former Russian Empire, mostly in the [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0016_0_15895.html|title=Pogroms|work=[[Encyclopaedia Judaica]]|accessdate=17 November 2009|author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 60,000–200,000&amp;nbsp;civilian Jews were killed in the atrocities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/modtimeline.html|title=Jewish Modern and Contemporary Periods (ca. 1700–1917)|work=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=17 November 2009|author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of World War I, Greece [[Greco-Turkish War (1919-1922)|fought]] against Turkish nationalists led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk|Mustafa Kemal]], a war which resulted in a [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey|massive population exchange between the two countries]] under the [[Treaty of Lausanne]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,451140,00.html &quot;The Diaspora Welcomes the Pope&quot;], ''Der Spiegel'' Online. 28 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; According to various sources,&lt;ref&gt;[[R. J. Rummel]], &quot;The Holocaust in Comparative and Historical Perspective,&quot; 1998, ''Idea Journal of Social Issues'', Vol.3 no.2&lt;/ref&gt; several hundred thousand [[Pontic Greeks]] died during this period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/17/nyregion/a-few-words-in-greek-tell-of-a-homeland-lost.html Chris Hedges, &quot;A Few Words in Greek Tell of a Homeland Lost&quot;], ''The New York Times'', 17 Sep 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace treaties and national boundaries===
After the war, the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] imposed a series of peace treaties on the Central Powers. The 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] officially ended the war. Building on [[Fourteen Points|Wilson's 14th point]], the Treaty of Versailles also brought into being the [[League of Nations]] on 28 June 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Magliveras|1999|pp=8–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Northedge|1986|pp=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In signing the treaty, Germany acknowledged responsibility for the war, and agreed to pay enormous [[war reparations]] and award territory to the victors. The &quot;Guilt Thesis&quot; became a controversial explanation of later events among analysts in Britain and the United States. The Treaty of Versailles caused enormous bitterness in Germany, which nationalist movements, especially the [[Nazi]]s, exploited with a [[conspiracy theory]] they called the ''Dolchstosslegende'' ([[Stab-in-the-back legend]]). The [[Weimar Republic]] lost the former [[German colonial empire|colonial possessions]] and was saddled with accepting blame for the war, as well as paying punitive [[World War I reparations|reparations]] for it. Unable to pay them with exports (as a result of territorial losses and postwar recession),&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Keynes|1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany did so by borrowing from the United States. Runaway inflation in the 1920s contributed to the economic collapse of the [[Weimar Republic]], and the payment of reparations was suspended in 1931 following the [[Stock Market Crash]] of 1929 and the beginnings of the [[Great Depression]] worldwide.

Austria–Hungary was partitioned into several successor states, including Austria, Hungary, [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Yugoslavia]], largely but not entirely along ethnic lines. [[Transylvania]] was shifted from Hungary to [[Greater Romania]]. The details were contained in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] and the [[Treaty of Trianon]]. As a result of the [[Treaty of Trianon]], 3.3 million Hungarians came under foreign rule. Although the Hungarians made up 54% of the population of the pre-war [[Kingdom of Hungary]], only 32% of its territory was left to Hungary. Between 1920 and 1924, 354,000 Hungarians fled former Hungarian territories attached to Romania, [[Czechoslovakia]], and [[Yugoslavia]].

The Russian Empire, which had withdrawn from the war in 1917 after the [[October Revolution]], lost much of its western frontier as the newly independent nations of Estonia, Finland, Latvia, Lithuania, and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] were carved from it. [[Bessarabia]] was re-attached to [[Greater Romania]], as it had been a Romanian territory for more than a thousand years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clark|1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ottoman Empire disintegrated, and much of its non-[[Anatolia]]n territory was awarded to various Allied powers as protectorates. The Turkish core was reorganised as the Republic of Turkey. The Ottoman Empire was to be partitioned by the [[Treaty of Sèvres]] of 1920. This treaty was never ratified by the Sultan and was rejected by the [[Turkish republican movement]], leading to the [[Turkish Independence War]] and, ultimately, to the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]].

The first tentative efforts to comprehend the meaning and consequences of modern warfare began during the initial phases of the war, and this process continued throughout and after the end of hostilities.

===Memorials===
[[File:Beaumont hamel newfoundland memorial.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Beaumont Hamel Newfoundland Memorial]] in the Somme.]]
Memorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns. Close to battlefields, those buried in improvised burial grounds were gradually moved to formal graveyards under the care of organisations such as the [[Commonwealth War Graves Commission]], the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]], the [[German War Graves Commission]], and [[Le Souvenir français]]. Many of these graveyards also have central monuments to the missing or unidentified dead, such as the [[Menin Gate]] memorial and the [[Thiepval Memorial to the Missing of the Somme]].

On 3 May 1915, during the [[Second Battle of Ypres]], Lieutenant Alexis Helmer was killed. At his graveside, his friend [[John McCrae]], M.D., of [[Guelph]], Ontario, Canada, wrote the memorable poem ''[[In Flanders Fields]]'' as a salute to those who perished in the Great War. Published in [[Punch Magazine|''Punch'']] on 8 December 1915, it is still recited today, especially on [[Armistice Day|Remembrance Day]] and [[Memorial Day]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.histori.ca/minutes/minute.do?id=10200|title=John McCrae|publisher=Historica|author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;ArticleId=A0004849|author=Evans David|title=John McCrae|work=Canadian Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Liberty Memorial]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri]], is a United States memorial dedicated to all Americans who served in World War I. The site for the Liberty Memorial was dedicated on 1 November 1921. On this day, the supreme Allied commanders spoke to a crowd of more than 100,000 people. It was the only time in history these leaders were together in one place. In attendance were Lieutenant General Baron Jacques of Belgium; General [[Armando Diaz]] of Italy; Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] of France; General Pershing of the United States; and Admiral [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|D. R. Beatty]] of Great Britain. After three years of construction, the [[Liberty Memorial]] was completed and President [[Calvin Coolidge]] delivered the dedication speech to a crowd of 150,000 people in 1926.

Liberty Memorial is also home to [[National World War I Museum|The National World War I Museum]], the only museum dedicated solely to World War I in the United States.

===Cultural memory===
The First World War had a lasting impact on social memory. It was seen by many in Britain as signalling the end of an era of stability stretching back to the [[Victorian era|Victorian period]], and across Europe many regarded it as a watershed.&lt;ref&gt;Mark David Sheftall, ''Altered Memories of the Great War: Divergent Narratives of Britain, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Historian Samuel Hynes explained:

{{quote|A generation of innocent young men, their heads full of high abstractions like Honour, Glory and England, went off to war to make the world safe for democracy. They were slaughtered in stupid battles planned by stupid generals. Those who survived were shocked, disillusioned and embittered by their war experiences, and saw that their real enemies were not the Germans, but the old men at home who had lied to them. They rejected the values of the society that had sent them to war, and in doing so separated their own generation from the past and from their cultural inheritance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hynes1991&quot; /&gt;}}
[[File:Pagny le Chateau monument morts 002b.jpg|thumb|180px|left|A village [[war memorial]] to soldiers killed in World War I.]]
This has become the most common perception of the First World War, perpetuated by the art, cinema, poems, and stories published subsequently. Films such as ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' and ''[[King &amp; Country]]'' have perpetuated the idea, while war-time films including ''Camrades'', ''Flanders Poppies'', and ''[[Shoulder Arms]]'' indicate that the most contemporary views of the war were overall far more positive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Todman2005&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Todman|first=Daniel|title=The Great War: myth and memory|year=2005|publisher=Hambledon and London|isbn=978-1-85285-459-1|pages=153–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the art of [[Paul Nash (artist)|Paul Nash]], [[John Nash (artist)|John Nash]], [[Christopher Nevison]], and [[Henry Tonks]] in Britain painted a negative view of the conflict in keeping with the growing perception, while popular war-time artists such as [[Muirhead Bone]] painted more serene and pleasant interpretations subsequently rejected as inaccurate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hynes1991&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Hynes|first=Samuel Lynn|title=A war imagined: the First World War and English culture|year=1991|publisher=Atheneum|isbn=978-0-689-12128-9|pages=i–xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several historians like John terriane, Niall Ferguson and Gary Sheffield have challenged these interpretations as partial and polemical views:
[[File:Siegfried Sassoon by George Charles Beresford (1915).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Siegfried Sassoon]] (May 1915)]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;These beliefs did not become widely shared because they offered the only accurate interpretation of wartime events. In every respect, the war was much more complicated than they suggest. In recent years, historians have argued persuasively against almost every popular cliché of the First World War. It has been pointed out that, although the losses were devastating, their greatest impact was socially and geographically limited. The many emotions other than horror experienced by soldiers in and out of the front line, including comradeship, boredom, and even enjoyment, have been recognised. The war is not now seen as a 'fight about nothing', but as a war of ideals, a struggle between aggressive militarism and more or less [[liberal democracy]]. It has been acknowledged that British generals were often capable men facing difficult challenges, and that it was under their command that the British army played a major part in the defeat of the Germans in 1918: a great forgotten victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Todman2005&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though these historians have discounted as &quot;myths&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hynes1991&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fussell2000&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Fussell|first=Paul|title=The Great War and modern memory|url=http://books.google.com/?id=D9iNQYfeKdwC|accessdate=18 May 2010|year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513332-5|pages=1–78}}&lt;/ref&gt; these perceptions of the war, they are common.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} They have dynamically changed according to contemporary influences, reflecting in the 1950s perceptions of the war as 'aimless' following the contrasting Second World War and emphasising conflict within the ranks during times of class conflict in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Todman2005&quot; /&gt; The majority of additions to the contrary are often rejected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Todman2005&quot; /&gt;

===Social trauma===
The social trauma caused by unprecedented rates of casualties manifested itself in different ways, which have been the subject of subsequent historical debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;todmanxi-xv&quot;/&gt; Some people{{Who|date=May 2010}} were revolted by nationalism and its results, and began to work towards a more [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] world, supporting organisations such as the [[League of Nations]]. [[Pacifism]] became increasingly popular. Others had the opposite reaction, feeling that only strength and military might could be relied upon in a chaotic and inhumane world. [[Development criticism|Anti-modernist]] views were an outgrowth of the many changes taking place in society.

[[File:Cover-of-book-for-WWI-veterans-by-William-Brown-Meloney-born-1878.jpg|thumb|upright|Book distributed by the U.S. [[United States Department of War|War Department]] to veterans in 1919&lt;/center&gt;]]
The experiences of the war led to a [[collective trauma]] shared by many from all participating countries. The [[optimism]] of ''[[Belle Époque|la belle époque]]'' was destroyed, and those who had fought in the war were referred to as the [[Lost Generation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roden}}&lt;/ref&gt; For years afterwards, people mourned the dead, the missing, and the many disabled.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wohl|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many soldiers returned with severe trauma, suffering from [[combat stress reaction|shell shock]] (also called neurasthenia, a condition related to [[posttraumatic stress disorder]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tucker|Roberts|2005|pp=108–1086}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many more returned home with few after-effects; however, their silence about the war contributed to the conflict's growing mythological status.&lt;ref name=&quot;todmanxi-xv&quot;/&gt; In the United Kingdom, mass mobilisation, large casualty rates, and the collapse of the [[Edwardian era]] made a strong impression on society. Though many participants did not share in the experiences of combat or spend any significant time at the front, or had positive memories of their service, the images of suffering and trauma became the widely shared perception.&lt;ref name=&quot;todmanxi-xv&quot;&gt;Todman, D. ''The Great War, Myth and Memory'', p. xi–xv.&lt;/ref&gt; Such historians as Dan Todman, Paul Fussell, and Samuel Heyns have all published works since the 1990s arguing that these common perceptions of the war are factually incorrect.&lt;ref name=&quot;todmanxi-xv&quot;/&gt;

===Discontent in Germany===
The rise of [[Nazism]] and fascism included a revival of the nationalist spirit and a rejection of many post-war changes. Similarly, the popularity of the [[Stab-in-the-back legend]] (German: ''Dolchstoßlegende'') was a testament to the [[Mental health|psychological state]] of defeated Germany and was a rejection of responsibility for the conflict. This [[conspiracy theory]] of betrayal became common, and the German populace came to see themselves as victims. The ''Dolchstoßlegende'''s popular acceptance in Germany played a significant role in the rise of Nazism. A sense of disillusionment and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] became pronounced, with [[nihilism]] growing. Many believed the war heralded the end of the world as they had known it because of the high fatalities among a generation of men, the dissolution of governments and empires, and the collapse of capitalism and [[imperialism]].

Communist and socialist movements around the world drew strength from this theory and enjoyed a new level of popularity. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or harshly affected by the war. Out of German discontent with the still controversial [[Treaty of Versailles]], [[Adolf Hitler]] was able to gain popularity and power.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwone/war_end_01.shtml|publisher=BBC|title=The Ending of World War One, and the Legacy of Peace|author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.schoolshistory.org.uk/hitlergainspower.htm|title=The Rise of Hitler|accessdate=12 November 2009|author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; World War II was in part a continuation of the power struggle never fully resolved by the First World War; in fact, it was common for Germans in the 1930s and 1940s to justify acts of international aggression because of perceived injustices imposed by the victors of the First World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110199/World-War-II|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080704030736/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9110199/World-War-II|archivedate=4 July 2008|title=World War II|work=Britannica Online Encyclopedia|accessdate=12 November 2009|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]]|author1=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Baker|first=Kevin|url=http://harpers.org/StabbedInTheBack.html|title=Stabbed in the Back!

All these slaughters, it is argued here, had a common origin, the collapse of the elite structure and normal modes of government of much of central, eastern and southern Europe as a result of the First World War, without which surely neither Communism nor Fascism would have existed except in the minds of unknown agitators and crackpots&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Rubinstein, W.

The establishment of the modern state of Israel and the roots of the continuing [[Israeli-Palestinian Conflict]] are partially found in the unstable power dynamics of the Middle East which resulted from World War I.&lt;ref name=&quot;Economist_2005&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Economist|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the end of the war, the [[Ottoman Empire]] had maintained a modest level of peace and stability throughout the Middle East.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hooker_1996&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hooker|1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the fall of the Ottoman government, power vacuums developed and conflicting claims to land and nationhood began to emerge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muller_2008&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Muller|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The political boundaries drawn by the victors of the First World War were quickly imposed, sometimes after only cursory consultation with the local population.

===Views in the United States===
U.S. intervention in the war, as well as the Wilson administration itself, became deeply unpopular. This was reflected in the [[U.S. Senate]]'s rejection of the [[Versailles Treaty]] and membership in the [[League of Nations]]. In the interwar era, a consensus arose that U.S. intervention had been a mistake, and the Congress passed [[Neutrality Acts of 1930s|laws]] in an attempt to preserve U.S. neutrality in any future conflict. Polls taken in 1937 and the opening months of World War II established that nearly 60% regarded intervention in WWI as a mistake, with only 28% opposing that view. But, in the period between the [[fall of France]] and the [[attack on Pearl Harbor]], public opinion changed dramatically and, for the first time, a narrow plurality rejected the idea that the war had been a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RPUaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YEwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3742,5638207|title=1941 Gallup poll|publisher=Google|accessdate=15 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Czechoslovakia]], combining the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]] with parts of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], became a new nation. Russia became the [[Soviet Union]] and lost Finland, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia, which became independent countries. The [[Ottoman Empire]] was soon replaced by Turkey and several other countries in the Middle East.

In the British Empire, the war unleashed new forms of nationalism. In Australia and New Zealand the [[Gallipoli Campaign|Battle of Gallipoli]] became known as those nations' &quot;Baptism of Fire&quot;. It was the first major war in which the newly established countries fought, and it was one of the first times that Australian troops fought as Australians, not just subjects of the [[British Crown]].

One of the most dramatic effects of the war was the expansion of governmental powers and responsibilities in Britain, France, the United States, and the Dominions of the British Empire. In order to harness all the power of their societies, governments created new ministries and powers. New taxes were levied and laws enacted, all designed to bolster the [[war effort]]; many have lasted to this day. Similarly, the war strained the abilities of some formerly large and bureaucratised governments, such as in Austria–Hungary and Germany; however, any analysis of the long-term effects were clouded by the defeat of these governments.

Gross domestic product (GDP) increased for three Allies (Britain, Italy, and U.S.), but decreased in France and Russia, in neutral Netherlands, and in the three main Central Powers. The shrinkage in GDP in Austria, Russia, France, and the Ottoman Empire reached 30 to 40%. In Austria, for example, most pigs were slaughtered, so at war's end there was no meat.

In all nations the government's share of GDP increased, surpassing fifty percent in both Germany and France and nearly reaching that level in Britain. To pay for purchases in the United States, Britain cashed in its extensive investments in American railroads and then began borrowing heavily on [[Wall Street]]. President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916, but allowed a great increase in [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] lending to the Allies. After 1919, the U.S. demanded repayment of these loans. The repayments were, in part, funded by German reparations, which, in turn, were supported by American loans to Germany. This circular system collapsed in 1931 and the loans were never repaid. In 1934, Britain owed the US $4.4 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]]&lt;ref&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; in this context&amp;nbsp;– see [[Long and short scales]]&lt;/ref&gt; of World War I debt.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4757181.stm What's a little debt between friends?]&quot;. BBC News. 10 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Macro- and micro-economic consequences devolved from the war. Families were altered by the departure of many men. With the death or absence of the primary wage earner, women were forced into the workforce in unprecedented numbers. At the same time, industry needed to replace the lost labourers sent to war. This aided the struggle for [[suffragette|voting rights for women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Noakes|first=Lucy|title=Women in the British Army: war and the gentle sex, 1907–1948|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|location=Abingdon, England|isbn=0-415-39056-7|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

World War I further compounded the gender imbalance, adding to the phenomenon of [[surplus women]]. The deaths of nearly one million men during the war increased the gender gap by almost a million; from 670,000 to 1,700,000. The number of unmarried women seeking economic means grew dramatically. In addition, demobilisation and economic decline following the war caused high unemployment. The war increased female empolyment, however the return of demoblised men displaced many from the workforce, as did the closure of many of the wartime factories. Hence women who had worked during the war found themselves struggling to find jobs and those approaching working age were not offered the opportunity.

In Britain, rationing was finally imposed in early 1918, limited to meat, sugar, and fats (butter and [[Margarine|oleo]]), but not bread. The new system worked smoothly. From 1914 to 1918 trade union membership doubled, from a little over four million to a little over eight million. Work stoppages and strikes became frequent in 1917–1918 as the unions expressed grievances regarding prices, alcohol control, pay disputes, fatigue from overtime and working on Sundays, and inadequate housing.

Britain turned to her colonies for help in obtaining essential war materials whose supply had become difficult from traditional sources. Geologists such as [[Albert Ernest Kitson]] were called upon to find new resources of precious minerals in the African colonies. Kitson discovered important new deposits of [[manganese]], used in munitions production, in the [[Gold Coast (region)|Gold Coast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Green|1938|pp=CXXVI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|Article 231]] of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] (the so-called &quot;war guilt&quot; clause) declared Germany and its allies responsible for all &quot;loss and damage&quot; suffered by the Allies during the war and provided the basis for [[World War I reparations|reparations]]. The total reparations demanded was 132 billion gold marks, which was far more than the total German gold or foreign exchange. The economic problems that the payments brought, and German resentment at their imposition, are usually cited as one of the more significant factors that led to the end of the [[Weimar Republic]] and the beginning of the dictatorship of [[Adolf Hitler]]. After Germany's defeat in World War II, payment of the reparations was not resumed. There was, however, outstanding German debt that the Weimar Republic had used to pay the reparations. Germany finished paying off the reparations in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2010/1004/Germany-finishes-paying-WWI-reparations-ending-century-of-guilt|title=Germany finishes paying WWI reparations, ending century of 'guilt'}} Christian Science Monitor. 4 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
