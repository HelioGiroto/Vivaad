[[Image:Sanhedrim.jpg|thumb|The ''Sanhedrin'', from an 1883 encyclopedia]]

The '''Sanhedrin''' (Hebrew: {{Hebrew|סַנְהֶדְרִין}} ''sanhedrîn'', {{lang-el|συνέδριον}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blueletterbible.org/cgi-bin/strongs.pl?strongs=4892 Lexicon Reslts for sunedrion (Strong's 4892)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Synedrion|''synedrion'']], &quot;sitting together,&quot; hence &quot;[[Deliberative assembly|assembly]]&quot; or &quot;council&quot;) was an assembly of seventy to seventy three people appointed in every city in the biblical [[Land of Israel]]. The [[Mishnah]]&lt;ref&gt;The ''Mishnah'' (Sanhedrin 1:1)&lt;/ref&gt; arrives at the number twenty-three based on an exegetical derivation: It must be possible for a &quot;[[minyan|community]]&quot; to vote for both conviction and exoneration ({{Bibleverse-lb||Numbers|35:24-5|HE}}). The minimum size of a &quot;community&quot; is 10 ({{Bibleverse-lb||Numbers|14:27|HE}}; i.e. the 10 spies). One more is required to achieve a majority (11–10), but a simple majority cannot convict ({{Bibleverse-lb||Exodus|23:2|HE}}), and so an additional judge is required (12–10). Finally, a court should not have an even number of judges to prevent deadlocks; thus 23.                                                                                                                                            This court delt with only religious matters. The Great Sanhedrin was made up of a Chief/Prince/Leader called ''[[Nasi]]'' (at some times this position may have been held by the ''[[Kohen Gadol]]'' or the High Priest), a vice chief justice (''[[Av Beit Din]]''), and sixty-nine general members.&lt;ref&gt;In general usage, &quot;The Sanhedrin&quot; without qualifier normally refers to the Great Sanhedrin.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Second Temple period, the Great Sanhedrin met in the [[Hall of Hewn Stones]] in the Temple in [[Jerusalem]]. The court convened every day except [[Jewish Holidays|festivals]] and [[Shabbos]]. In the late 3rd century, to avoid persecution, its authoritative decisions were issued under the name of ''Beis HaMidrash''.

The penultimate binding decision of the Sanhedrin was in 358, when the [[Hebrew Calendar]] was adopted. The ''Sanhedrin'' was dissolved after continued persecution by the [[Roman Empire]]. Over the centuries, there have been attempts to revive the institution, such as the [[Grand Sanhedrin]] convened by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] and modern attempts in [[Israel]].

The ''Sanhedrin'' is mentioned in the [[Gospel]]s in relation to the [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus]].

==Early Sanhedrin==
The Hasmonean court in the [[Land of Israel]], presided over by [[Alexander Jannaeus]], king of Judea until 76 BC, followed by his wife, was called ''Synhedrion'' or ''Sanhedrin.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Wanderings p. 191&quot;&gt;''Wanderings: Chaim Potok's History of the Jews,'' Chaim Potok, Knopf, New York, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; The exact nature of this early Sanhedrin is not clear. It may have been a body of sages and/or priests, or a political, legislative and judicial institution. Only after the destruction of the Second Temple was the Sanhedrin made up only of sages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wanderings p. 191&quot;/&gt;

===Great and Lesser Sanhedrin===
The Talmud (tractate [[Sanhedrin (tractate)|Sanhedrin]]) identifies two classes of rabbinical courts called Sanhedrin, a Great Sanhedrin (בית דין הגדול) and a Lesser Sanhedrin (בית דין הקטן). Each city could have its own lesser Sanhedrin of 23 judges, but there could be only one Great Sanhedrin of 71, which among other roles acted as the Supreme Court, taking appeals from cases decided by lesser courts. The numbers of judges were predicated on eliminating the possibility of a tie and the last to cast their vote was the head of the court.

===Function and procedures===
The Sanhedrin as a body claimed powers that lesser Jewish courts did not have. As such, they were the only ones who could try the king, extend the boundaries of the Temple and Jerusalem, and were the ones to whom all questions of law were finally put. Before 191 BC the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] acted as the ''ex officio'' head of the Sanhedrin, but in 191 BC, when the Sanhedrin lost confidence in the High Priest, the office of [[Nasi]] was created. After the time of [[Hillel the Elder]] (late 1st century BC and early 1st century AD), the Nasi was almost invariably a descendant of Hillel. The second highest-ranking member of the Sanhedrin was called the [[Av Beit Din]], or &quot;Head of the Court&quot; (literally, Beit Din = &quot;house of law&quot;), who presided over the Sanhedrin when it sat as a criminal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/economic/friedman/sanhedrin.htm |title=Sanhedrin |publisher=CUNY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sanhedrin met in a building known as the [[Hall of Hewn Stones]] (''Lishkat Ha-Gazith''), which has been placed by the Talmud and many scholars as built into the north wall of the [[Temple Mount]], half inside the sanctuary and half outside, with doors providing access both to the Temple and to the outside. The name presumably arises to distinguish it from the buildings in the Temple complex used for ritual purposes, which had to be constructed of stones unhewn by any [[iron]] implements.

In some cases, it was only necessary for a 23-member panel (functioning as a Lesser Sanhedrin) to convene. In general, the full panel of 71 judges was only convened on matters of national significance (e.g., a declaration of war) or in the event that the 23-member panel could not reach a conclusive verdict.&lt;ref&gt;Babylonian Talmud: Sanhedrin [http://images.e-daf.com/DafImg.asp?ID=3613&amp;size=1 2a].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ancient Galilee.jpg|thumb|right|225px|[[Galilee]] in [[Late Antiquity|late antiquity]].]]
By the end of the [[Second Temple]] period, the Sanhedrin reached its pinnacle of importance,  legislating all aspects of Jewish religious and political life within the parameters laid down by Biblical and Rabbinic tradition.

After the destruction of the Second Temple in 70, the Sanhedrin was re-established in [[Yavneh]] with reduced authority. The imperial Roman government and legislation recognized it as the [[Palestinian Patriarchate]], the ultimate authority in Jewish religious matters. The seat of the Patriarchate moved to [[Usha (ancient)|Usha]] under the presidency of [[Shimon ben Gamliel|Gamaliel II]] in 80 CE. In 116 it moved back to Yavneh, and then again back to Usha. It moved in 140 to [[Shefa-'Amr|Shefaram]] under the presidency of [[Shimon ben Gamliel II]], and to [[Beit Shearim]] and Sephoris in 163, under the presidency of [[Judah I]]. Finally, it moved to [[Tiberias]] in 193, under the presidency of [[Gamaliel III]] (193–230) ben [[Judah haNasi]], where it became more of a consistory, but still retained, under the presidency of [[Judah II]] (230–270), the power of excommunication.

During the presidency of [[Gamaliel IV]] (270–290), due to Roman persecution, it dropped the name Sanhedrin; and its authoritative decisions were subsequently issued under the name of ''[[Yeshiva|Beth HaMidrash]]''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

In 363, emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] ordered the Temple rebuilt.&lt;ref&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', 23.1.2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;  A personal friend of his, [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], wrote this about the effort:

{{quotation|Julian thought to rebuild at an extravagant expense the proud Temple once at Jerusalem, and committed this task to [[Alypius of Antioch]]. Alypius set vigorously to work, and was seconded by the [[Roman governor|governor of the province]]; when fearful balls of fire, breaking out near the foundations, continued their attacks, till the workmen, after repeated scorchings, could approach no more: and he gave up the attempt.|&lt;small&gt;Ammianus Marcellinus&lt;/small&gt;}}

The failure to rebuild the Temple has been ascribed to the [[Galilee earthquake of 363]], and to the [[Jew]]s' ambivalence about the project. Sabotage is a possibility, as is an accidental fire.  Divine intervention was the common view among Christian historians of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solomon&quot;&gt;See [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/jewish/julian-jews.html &quot;Julian and the Jews 361–363 CE&quot;] and [http://www.gibsoncondo.com/~david/convert/history.html &quot;Julian the Apostate and the Holy Temple&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; Julian's support of [[Judaism|Jews]], coming after the hostility of many earlier Emperors, meant that Jews called him ''Julian the [[Names of the Greeks#Hellene_comes_to_mean_.22pagan.22|Hellene]]''.&lt;ref&gt;A Psychoanalytic History of the Jews, [[Avner Falk]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a reaction to Julian's pro-Jewish stance, [[Theodosius I]] forbade the Sanhedrin to assemble and declared [[Semicha|ordination]] illegal. Capital punishment was prescribed for any Rabbi who received ordination and complete destruction of the town where the ordination occurred.&lt;ref&gt;''A History of the Jewish People'', by Hayim Ben-Sasson, Harvard University Press (October 15, 1985), ISBN 978-0-674-39731-6&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since the [[Hebrew calendar]] was based on witnesses' testimony, that had become far too dangerous to collect, [[Hillel II]] recommended change to a mathematically based calendar that was adopted at a clandestine, and maybe final, meeting in 358. This marked the last universal decision made by that body.

[[Gamaliel VI]] (400–425) was the Sanhedrin's last president. With his death in 425, executed by [[Theodosius II]] for erecting new synagogues contrary to the imperial decree, the title [[Nasi]], the last remains of the ancient Sanhedrin, became illegal. An imperial decree of 426 diverted the patriarchs' tax (''post excessum patriarchorum'') into the imperial treasury&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeological findings==
In 2004, excavations in Tiberias conducted by the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] uncovered a structure dating to the 3rd century CE that may have been the seat of the Sanhedrin when it convened in that city. At the time it was called Beit Hava'ad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/researchers-say-tiberias-basilica-may-have-housed-sanhedrin-1.117483 Researchers say Tiberias basilica may have housed Sanhedrin]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revival attempts==
{{See also|Semicha#Attempts to revive classical semicha}}

The Sanhedrin is traditionally viewed as the last institution that commanded universal Jewish authority among the Jewish people in the long chain of tradition from [[Moses]] until the present day. Since its dissolution in 358 by imperial decree, there have been several attempts to re-establish this body either as a self-governing body, or as a puppet of a sovereign government.

There are records of what may have been of attempts to reform the Sanhedrin in Arabia,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alsadiqin.org/history/The%20Persian%20conquest%20of%20Jerusalem%20in%20614CE%20compared%20with%20Islamic%20conquest%20of%20638CE.pdf The Persian conquest of Jerusalem in 614 compared with Islamic conquest of 638]&lt;/ref&gt; in Jerusalem under the Caliph 'Umar,&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt; and in Babylon (Iraq),&lt;ref&gt;''Sefer Yuchsin'', cf. ''Yarchei Kallah'', Rabbi Nassan describes &quot;the seventy judges who comprise the Sanhedrin&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; but none of these attempts were given any attention by Rabbinic authorities and little information is available about them.

===Napoleon Bonaparte's &quot;Grand Sanhedrin&quot;===
{{main|Napoleon Bonaparte's &quot;Grand Sanhedrin&quot;}}
[[Image:Frenchsanhedrin2.jpg|thumb|200px|Medallion struck in honor of the &quot;Grand Sanhedrin&quot; convened by Emperor Napoleon I of France.]]
The &quot;Grand Sanhedrin&quot; was a Jewish high court convened by [[Napoleon I]] to give legal sanction to the principles expressed by the [[Assembly of Notables]] in answer to the twelve questions submitted to it by the government (see Jew. Encyc. v. 468, s.v. France).

On October 6, 1806, the Assembly of Notables issued a proclamation to all the Jewish communities of Europe, inviting them to send delegates to the Sanhedrin, to convene on October 20. This proclamation, written in Hebrew, French, German, and Italian, speaks in extravagant terms of the importance of this revived institution and of the greatness of its imperial protector. While the action of Napoleon aroused in many Jews of Germany the hope that, influenced by it, their governments also would grant them the rights of citizenship, others looked upon it as a political contrivance. When in the war against Prussia (1806–7) the emperor invaded Poland and the Jews rendered great services to his army, he remarked, laughing, &quot;The sanhedrin is at least useful to me.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} David Friedländer and his friends in Berlin described it as a spectacle that Napoleon offered to the [[Paris]]ians.

===Modern attempts in Israel===
{{main| Modern attempts to revive the Sanhedrin}}
Since the dissolution of the Sanhedrin in 358,&lt;ref&gt;The dissolution of the Sanhedrin, in terms of its power to give binding universal decisions, is usually dated to 358 when [[Hillel II]]'s Jewish Calendar was adopted. This marked the last universally accepted decision made by that body.&lt;/ref&gt; there has been no universally recognized authority within [[Halakha|Jewish law]]. [[Maimonides]] (1135–1204) was one of the greatest scholars of the Middle Ages, and is arguably one of the most widely accepted scholars among the Jewish people since the closing of the Talmud in 500. Influenced by the rationalist school of thought and generally showing a preference for a natural (as opposed to miraculous) redemption for the Jewish people, [[Maimonides]] proposed a rationalist solution for achieving the goal of re-establishing the highest court in Jewish tradition and reinvesting it with the same authority it had in former years. There have been several attempts to implement [[Maimonides]]' recommendations, the latest being in modern times.

There have been rabbinical attempts to renew [[Semicha]] and re-establish a Sanhedrin by Rabbi [[Jacob Berab]] in 1538, Rabbi [[Yisroel Shklover]] in 1830, Rabbi Aharon Mendel haCohen in 1901, Rabbi Zvi Kovsker in 1940 and Rabbi [[Yehuda Leib Maimon]] in 1949.

In October 2004 (Tishrei 5765), a group of [[rabbi]]s representing varied Orthodox communities in [[Israel]] undertook a ceremony in [[Tiberias]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnn.com/data/asx2004/10/20/asx_1159_300.asx israelnn.com]&lt;/ref&gt;, where the original Sanhedrin was disbanded, which is claimed to re-establish the body according to the proposal of [[Maimonides]] and the Jewish legal rulings of Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]]. The controversial attempt has been subject to debate within different Jewish communities.
