'''Chicano nationalism''' is the [[ethnic nationalism|ethnic nationalist]] ideology of [[Chicano]]s. While there were [[nationalism|nationalistic]] aspects of the [[Chicano Movement]] of the 1960s and 1970s, the Movement tended to emphasize [[civil rights]] and political and social inclusion rather than nationalism. For this reason, Chicano nationalism is better described as an ideology than as a [[political movement]].

==Background==
Violence and discrimination against [[Mexican American]]s continued into the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-111897839.html |title=The lynching of persons of Mexican origin or descent in}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oah.org/pubs/magazine/deseg/ruiz.html |title=South by Southwest: Mexican Americans and Segregated Schooling, 1900-1950 | Vicki L. Ruiz | OAH Magazine of History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many organizations, businesses, and homeowners associations had official policies to exclude Mexican Americans. In many areas across the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]], Mexican Americans lived in separate residential areas, due to laws and real estate company policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CzarnBhJiZUC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=history+residential+discrimination+%22mexican+americans%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=E5sWzrye-1&amp;sig=ASrRu7iGdrLIFEc6cNirTozixiU |title=Black, brown, yellow, and left ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This group of laws and policies, known as [[redlining]], lasted until the 1950s, and fall under the concept of official segregation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CzarnBhJiZUC&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=history+residential+discrimination+%22mexican+americans%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=E5sWzrye-1&amp;sig=ASrRu7iGdrLIFEc6cNirTozixiU#PPA54,M1 |title=Black, brown, yellow, and left ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many other instances, it was more of a general social understanding that Mexicans should be excluded from [[White American|White]] society. For instance, signs with the phrase &quot;No Dogs or Mexicans&quot; were posted in small businesses and public pools throughout the Southwest well into the 60's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neta.com/~1stbooks/press3b.htm |title=press3b}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the Mexican American community began to question whether assimilation was possible or even desirable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://depts.washington.edu/civilr/Chicanomovement_part1.htm Chicano Movement&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, a sense of ethnic consciousness and unity was forming, especially among the youth, around the [[Delano grape strike|plight of the farmworkers]]. Mexican Americans, some of whom began calling themselves &quot;[[Chicano]]s&quot; as a symbol of ethnic pride, also began to uncover their history and critically analyze what they learned in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denver-rmn.com/millennium/0921mile.shtml ]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this new sense of identity and history, the early proponents of the Chicano movement began viewing themselves as a colonized people entitled to [[self-determination]] of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7YPRSKIrUJsC&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=%22chicano+movement%22+%22colonized+people%22&amp;source=web&amp;ots=3JZ1OlC9lC&amp;sig=RSKBqhAekFeM9_JwvU7MR2T00Y8 |title=Youth, identity, power: the Chicano ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of them also embraced a form of nationalism that was based on their perception of the failure of the [[United States]] government to live up to the promises that it had made in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/rubyhatchet/guadalupe_hidalgo.html |title=Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/rubyhatchet/guadalupe_hidalgo.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:53:05|archivedate=2009-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lasculturas.com/lib/sd/blsd092200a.php |title=A History of Mexican Americans in California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quote==
The concept of Chicano nationalism is perhaps best &lt;!--editorializing--&gt;articulated in the 1968 [[Plan Espiritual de Aztlán]], generally considered &lt;!--by whom--&gt;the [[manifesto]] of the Chicano Movement{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. It states, &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;El Plan Espiritual de Aztlán sets the theme that the Chicanos (''[[Bronze race|La Raza de Bronze]]'') must use their nationalism as the key or common denominator for mass mobilization and organization. Once we are committed to the idea and philosophy of El Plan de Aztlán, we can only conclude that social, economic, cultural, and political [[independence]] is the only road to total liberation from [[oppression]], [[exploitation]], and [[racism]]. Our struggle then must be for the control of our [[barrio]]s, [[Field (agriculture)|campos]], [[pueblo]]s, lands, our economy, our culture, and our political life. El Plan commits all levels of Chicano society - the barrio, the campo, the [[Ranching|ranchero]], the [[writer]], the [[teacher]], the [[Labour (economics)|worker]], the [[professional]] - to ''La Causa''.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Functions and basis==
Chicano nationalism allowed Chicanos to define themselves as a group on their own terms, and was a determination on their part to mold their own destiny. It is rooted in the [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]] [[creation myth]] of [[Aztlán]], a &quot;northerly place&quot;. As the Aztecs are central to the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|conquest]] and [[history of Mexico]], the use of the word took on the added dimension of the reclamation of an [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] heritage as part of the [[decolonization]] process.

The sense of Chicano nationalism was enhanced by a geographical proximity of the United States and Mexico. Chicanos use the name Aztlán in reference to territories within the [[Border|boundaries]] of the [[Mexican Cession]], the land that was &quot;granted&quot; to Spain in 1493 by Pope Alexander VI in Bull [[Inter caetera]], then claimed by the [[Mexican Empire]] in 1821 when Spain signed the [[Treaty of Córdoba]] at the conclusion of the [[Mexican War of Independence]], then claimed as &quot;territories&quot; (as opposed to &quot;states&quot;, often referred to as &quot;provinces&quot;) by [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|1824 Constitution]], and finally ceded to the United States in 1848 as an outcome of the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]] (although it also included [[Texas]], which had earlier proclaimed its independence from the government in Mexico City and was independent territory.)

The commitment to a nationalist ideology allowed Chicano activists to supersede differences that threatened their unity. Mexican Americans had regional, linguistic, age, cultural, racial, and gender differences, all of which were all subsumed to a mutual dedication to the Chicano Movement.

This emphasis on cultural nationalism would persist well into the late seventies before the concept of activism ‘sin fronteras’ (without borders) and [[Marxist]] critiques of empire transformed the Chicano Left, causing them to turn their attention towards conflicts such as the [[Zapatista National Liberation Army]]’s (EZLN) revolution against [[neo-liberal]] economic doctrine in [[Chiapas, Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/22755094.html?dids=22755094:22755094&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+29%2C+1995&amp;author=MIMI+KO&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Countywide+Zapatista+Supporters+Protest+U.S.+Actions&amp;pqatl=google | title=Countywide Zapatista Supporters Protest U.S. Actions | first=Mimi | last=Ko | date=1995-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
