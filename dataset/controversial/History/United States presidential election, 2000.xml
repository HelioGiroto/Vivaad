The '''United States presidential election of 2000''' was a contest between [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] candidate [[George W. Bush]], the [[governor of Texas]] and son of former president [[George H. W. Bush]], and [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] candidate [[Al Gore]], the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]].

The incumbent [[President of the United States|President]], [[Bill Clinton]], was vacating the position after serving the maximum two terms allowed by the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-second Amendment]]. Bush narrowly won the November 7 election, with 271 [[List of United States presidential electors, 2000|electoral votes]] to Gore's 266 (with one [[Electoral College (United States)|elector]] abstaining in the official tally).

The election was noteworthy for a [[United States presidential election in Florida, 2000|controversy]] over the awarding of [[Florida]]'s 25 [[electoral votes]], the subsequent recount process in that state, and the unusual event of the winning candidate having received fewer popular votes than the runner-up.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2000&quot;&gt;http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/2000presgeresults.htm&lt;/ref&gt; This marked only the fourth election in U.S. History in which the eventual  winner failed to win a plurality of the [[popular vote]] (after the elections of [[United States presidential election, 1824|1824]], [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876]], and [[United States presidential election, 1888|1888]]). Later research showed that by the standards requested by the Gore campaign in their contest brief or by the partial statewide recount set by the Florida Supreme Court, Bush would have likely won the recount anyway.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes2001&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2001/11/12/politics/12VOTE.html Study of Disputed Florida Ballots Finds Justices Did Not Cast the Deciding Vote].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the same research indicates that had the statewide recount  included all uncounted votes (overvotes as well as undervotes), as seems probable based on later statements by the judge overseeing the recount and supported by faxes made public in November, 2001, Gore would have won the election.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norc.uchicago.edu/fl/index.asp  |title=Florida Ballots Project|publisher= |date= |accessdate=2006-08-30 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060830005647/http://www.norc.uchicago.edu/fl/index.asp |archivedate = 2006-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek2001&quot;&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/76207/page/1 The Final Word?

&lt;/gallery&gt;

[[Al Gore]] of [[Tennessee]] was a consistent front-runner for the  nomination. Other prominent Democrats mentioned as possible contenders included [[Bob Kerrey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/12/13/kerrey/ | title = Nebraska's Kerrey bows out of 2000 presidential race | publisher = CNN | date = December 13, 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Missouri]] Congressman [[Dick Gephardt]], [[Minnesota]] Senator [[Paul Wellstone]], and famous actor and director [[Warren Beatty]], who declined to run.&lt;ref&gt;York, Anthony (Sep. 2, 1999) [http://www.salon.com/news/feature/1999/09/02/beatty/index.html &quot;Life of the Party?&quot;] ''Salon News''.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, only Wellstone formed an [[exploratory committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/04/08/wellstone/index.html | title = Wellstone Launches Presidential Exploratory Committee | publisher = CNN | first = Carin | last = Dessauer | date = April 8, 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Gore's advantage as the incumbent Vice President, Bradley was not the candidate of a major faction or coalition of blocs. Running an insurgency campaign, Bradley positioned himself as the alternative to Gore, who was a founding member of the centrist [[Democratic Leadership Council]]. While former basketball star [[Michael Jordan]] campaigned for him in the early primary states, Bradley announced his intention to campaign &quot;in a different way&quot; by conducting a positive campaign of &quot;big ideas&quot;. The focus of his campaign was a plan to spend the record-breaking budget surplus on a variety of social welfare programs to help the poor and the middle-class, along with campaign finance reform and [[gun control]].

Gore easily defeated Bradley in the primaries, largely because of support from the Democratic Party establishment and Bradley's poor showing in the Iowa caucus, where Gore successfully painted Bradley as aloof and indifferent to the plight of farmers. The closest Bradley came to a victory was his 50–46 loss to Gore in the New Hampshire primary. On March 14, Al Gore won the Democratic nomination.

None of Bradley's delegates were allowed to vote for him, so Gore won the nomination unanimously at the [[2000 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]]. [[Connecticut]] Senator [[Joe Lieberman]] was nominated for Vice President by voice vote. Lieberman became the first [[American Jews|Jewish American]] ever to be chosen for this position by a major party. Gore chose Lieberman over five finalists.&lt;ref name = GoreLiebermanCNN&gt;{{cite news | url = http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/08/07/gore.lieberman/index.html | title = Gore, Lieberman prepare for public debut of Democratic ticket | publisher = CNN | date = August 8, 2000 }} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Several Republican candidates appeared on the national scene to challenge Gore's candidacy.

George W. Bush became the early front-runner, acquiring unprecedented funding and a broad base of leadership support based on his governorship of Texas and the name recognition and connections of the Bush family. Former cabinet member [[George Shultz]] played an important early role in securing establishment Republican support for Bush. In April 1998, he invited Bush to discuss policy issues with experts including [[Michael Boskin]], [[John B. Taylor|John Taylor]], and [[Condoleezza Rice]]. The group, which was &quot;looking for a candidate for 2000 with good political instincts, someone they could work with&quot;, was impressed, and Shultz encouraged him to enter the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= The Choice 2004|series=Frontline|serieslink=Frontline (U.S. TV series)|network=PBS|station=[[WGBH-TV]]|city=Boston|airdate=October 12, 2004|transcripturl= http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/choice2004/etc/script.html|accessdate=February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several aspirants withdrew before the [[Iowa Republican caucuses, 2000|Iowa Caucus]] because they were unable to secure funding and endorsements sufficient to remain competitive with Bush. These included [[Elizabeth Dole]], [[Dan Quayle]], [[Lamar Alexander]], and [[Robert C. Smith]]. [[Pat Buchanan]] dropped out to run for the Reform Party nomination. That left Bush, [[John McCain]], [[Alan Keyes]], [[Steve Forbes]], [[Gary Bauer]], and [[Orrin Hatch]] as the only candidates still in the race.

On January 24, Bush won the Iowa caucus with 41% of the vote. Forbes came in second with 30% of the vote. Keyes received 14%, Bauer 9%, McCain 5%, and Hatch 1%. Hatch dropped out. On the national stage, Bush was portrayed in the media as the establishment candidate. McCain, with the support of many moderate Republicans and Independents, portrayed himself as a crusading insurgent who focused on [[Electoral reform|campaign reform]].

On February 1, McCain won a 49%&amp;ndash;30% victory over Bush in the [[New Hampshire Presidential primary|New Hampshire primary]]. Gary Bauer dropped out. After coming in third in Delaware Forbes dropped out, leaving three candidates. In the [[South Carolina Republican primary, 2000|South Carolina primary]], Bush soundly defeated McCain. Some McCain supporters blamed it on the Bush campaign, accusing them of mudslinging and dirty tricks, such as [[push poll]]ing that implied that McCain's adopted Bangladeshi-born daughter was an African-American child he fathered out of wedlock.&lt;ref name=pushpolling&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dadmag.com/archive/060400jmccain.php |title=Interview with John McCain|publisher=Dadmag.com |date=June 4, 2000 |accessdate=November 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While McCain's loss in South Carolina damaged his campaign, he won both Michigan and his home state of Arizona on February 22.

On February 24, McCain criticized Bush for accepting the endorsement of [[Bob Jones University]] despite its policy banning interracial dating. On February 28, McCain also referred to Rev. [[Jerry Falwell]] and televangelist [[Pat Robertson]] as &quot;agents of intolerance&quot;, a term he would later distance himself from during his [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008|2008 bid]] for the party's nomination. He lost the state of Virginia to Bush on February 29. On [[Super Tuesday]], March 7, Bush won New York, Ohio, Georgia, Missouri, California, Maryland, and Maine. McCain won Rhode Island, Vermont, Connecticut, and Massachusetts, but dropped out of the race. On March 10, Alan Keyes got 21% of the vote in Utah. Bush took the majority of the remaining contests and won the Republican nomination on March 14, winning his home state of Texas and his brother [[Jeb Bush|Jeb's]] home state of Florida among others. At the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia George W. Bush accepted the nomination of the Republican party.

Bush asked former [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Dick Cheney]] to head up a team to help select a running mate for him, but ultimately, Bush decided that Cheney should be the vice presidential nominee. While the U.S. Constitution does not specifically disallow a president and a vice president from the same state, it does prohibit electors from casting both of his or her votes for persons from his or her own state. Accordingly, Cheney&amp;mdash;who had been a resident of [[Texas]] for nearly 10 years&amp;mdash;changed his voting registration back to Wyoming. Had Cheney not done this, either he or Bush would have forfeited their electoral votes from the Texas electors.

==General election campaign==
Although the campaign focused mainly on domestic issues, such as the projected budget surplus, proposed reforms of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], health care, and competing plans for tax relief, foreign policy was often an issue. Bush criticized [[Clinton administration]] policies in [[Somalia]], where 18 Americans died in 1993 trying to sort out warring factions, and in the Balkans, where United States peacekeeping troops perform a variety of functions. &quot;I don't think our troops ought to be used for what's called [[nation-building]],&quot; Bush said in the second [[American presidential debate|presidential debate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=2004| url=http://www.debates.org/pages/trans2000b.html| title=The Second Gore-Bush Presidential Debate| work=2000 Debate Transcript| publisher=Commission on Presidential Debates| accessdate=October 21, 2005 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050403122916/http://www.debates.org/pages/trans2000b.html |archivedate = April 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush also pledged to bridge partisan gaps in the nation's capital, claiming the atmosphere in Washington stood in the way of progress on necessary reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/ |title=Election 2000 Archive |publisher=CNN/AllPolitics.com |accessdate=November 16, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080730055332/http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/ |archivedate = July 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gore, meanwhile, questioned Bush's fitness for the job, pointing to gaffes made by Bush in interviews and speeches and suggesting the Texas governor lacked the necessary experience to be president.

[[Bill Clinton]]'s [[impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment]] and the [[Monica Lewinsky affair|sex scandal]] that led up to it cast a shadow on the campaign, particularly on his vice president's run to replace him. Republicans strongly denounced the Clinton scandals, particularly Bush, who made his repeated promise to restore &quot;honor and dignity&quot; to the White House a centerpiece of his campaign. Gore studiously avoided the Clinton scandals, as did Lieberman, even though Lieberman had been the first Democratic senator to denounce Clinton's misbehavior. In fact, some media observers theorized that Gore actually chose Lieberman in an attempt to separate himself from Clinton's past misdeeds, and help blunt the GOP's attempts to link him to his boss.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Rather|Rather, Dan]]. [[CBS News|CBSNews.com]]. [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/08/09/politics/main223151.shtml Out of the Shadows]. Aug. 9, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Others pointed to the passionate kiss Gore gave his wife during the [[2000 Democratic National Convention|Democratic Convention]], as a signal that despite the allegations against Clinton, Gore himself was a faithful husband.&lt;ref&gt;[[The New York Times]]. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E3D6123EF933A1575BC0A9669C8B63 When a Kiss Isn't Just a Kiss]. Aug. 20, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Gore avoided appearing with Clinton, who was shunted to low visibility appearances in areas where he was popular. Experts have argued that this cost Gore votes from some of Clinton's core supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greens.org/s-r/25/25-03.html |title=Greens.org |publisher=Greens.org |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jacob Weisberg |url=http://www.slate.com/id/1006450/ |title=Slate.com |publisher=Slate.com |date=2000-11-08 |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nigerdeltacongress.com/articles/an_anatomy_of_2000_usa_president.htm |title=Nigerdeltacongress.com |publisher=Nigerdeltacongress.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ralph Nader]] was the most successful of third-party candidates, drawing 2.74 percent of the popular vote. His campaign was marked by a traveling tour of large &quot;super-rallies&quot; held in sports arenas like [[Madison Square Garden]], with retired [[talk show host]] [[Phil Donahue]] as master of ceremonies. After initially ignoring Nader, the Gore campaign made a pitch to (potential) Nader supporters in the final weeks of the campaign, downplaying Gore's differences with Nader on the issues and arguing that Gore's ideas were more similar to Nader's than Bush's were, and noting that Gore had a better chance of winning than Nader. On the other side, the [[Republican Leadership Council]] ran pro-Nader ads in a few states in an effort to split the liberal vote.&lt;ref&gt;Meckler, Laura (Oct. 27, 2000) [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/aponline/20001027/aponline115918_000.htm &quot;GOP Group to Air Pro-Nader TV Ads.&quot;] ''Washington Post''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of the campaign, many Gore supporters claimed that Nader acted as a [[spoiler effect|spoiler]] in the election, that Nader votes would have been cast for Gore, and that Nader threw the election outcome to Bush. Nader dismissed such concerns, claiming his objective in the campaign was to pass the 5-percent threshold so his Green Party would be eligible for matching funds in future races.

Both vice presidential candidates [[Dick Cheney]] and [[Joe Lieberman]] campaigned aggressively in the 2000 presidential election. Both camps made numerous campaign stops nationwide, often just missing each other such as when Cheney, [[Hadassah Lieberman]], and [[Tipper Gore]] attended Chicago's [[Taste of Polonia]] over [[Labor Day Weekend]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901E2DB1F30F936A3575AC0A9669C8B63|work=The New York Times|title=The 2000 Campaign: Campaign Briefing Published|date=September 5, 2000|accessdate=March 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential debates===
There were three presidential debates:

There was also one vice-presidential debate:
*October 5, 2000, at [[Centre College]] in Kentucky&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.debates.org/index.php?page=2000-debates#oct-5-2000 |title=Commission on Presidential Debates |publisher=Debates.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commission on Presidential Debates]], formed by Democratic and Republican party leaders, set rules that effectively excluded all but the two major party candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.opendebates.org/theissue/2000.html |title=Open Debates &amp;#124; What Happened in 2000? |work=opendebates.org |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ralph Nader was blocked from attending a closed circuit screening of the first debate in spite of his holding a ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/05/us/2000-campaign-green-party-nader-wants-apology-debate-panel-for-turning-him-away.html |title=THE 2000 CAMPAIGN: THE GREEN PARTY; Nader Wants Apology From Debate Panel for Turning Him Away |first=Carey |last=Goldberg |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2000-10-05 |publisher=[[New York Times Company|NYTC]] |location=[[New York, NY|New York]] |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was barred from attending an interview near the site of the third debate in spite of having a &quot;perimeter pass&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.naderlibrary.com/lit.crashparty.12.htm |title=Crashing the Party |first=Ralph |last=Nader |work=naderlibrary.com |year=2002 [last update] |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nader later sued the CPD for its role in the former incident.

==Results==
[[Image:pbc-fl-2000-recount-1.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Palm Beach County recount]]

With the exceptions of [[Florida]] and Gore's home state of [[Tennessee]], Bush carried the Southern states by comfortable margins (including then-President Bill Clinton's home state of Arkansas) and also secured wins in [[Ohio]], [[Indiana]], most of the rural [[Midwestern United States|Midwester]]n farming states, most of the Rocky Mountain states, and Alaska. Gore balanced Bush by sweeping the [[Northeastern United States]] (with the sole exception of [[New Hampshire]], which Bush won narrowly), most of the [[Upper Midwest]], and all of the Pacific Coast states of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], [[Oregon]], and [[California]], and carried [[Hawaii]], as well.

As the night wore on, the returns in a handful of small-to-medium sized states, including [[Wisconsin]] and [[Iowa]], were extremely close; however it was the state of Florida that would make clear the winner of the election. As the final national results were tallied the following morning, Bush had clearly won a total of 246 electoral votes, while Gore had won 255 votes. 270 votes were needed to win. Two smaller states—[[New Mexico]] (5 electoral votes) and Oregon (7 electoral votes)—were still too close to call. It was Florida (25 electoral votes), however, that the [[news media]] focused their attention on. Mathematically, Florida's 25 electoral votes became the key to an election win for either candidate. Although both New Mexico and Oregon were declared in favor of Gore over the next few days, Florida's statewide vote took center stage because that state's winner would ultimately win the election. The outcome of the election was not known for more than a month after the balloting ended because of the extended process of counting and then recounting Florida's presidential ballots.

===Florida recount===
{{Main|United States presidential election in Florida, 2000}}
[[Image:TallahaseePalmBeachBallotBox1.jpg|left|thumb|upright|2000 Palm Beach County voting stand and ballot box]]

At approximately 7:50 p.m. EST on election day, 10 minutes before the polls closed in the largely Republican Florida panhandle, which is in the Central time zone, some television news networks declared that Gore had carried Florida's 25 electoral votes. They based this prediction substantially on [[exit poll]]s. However, in the actual vote tally Bush began to take a wide lead early in Florida, and by 10 p.m. EST those networks had retracted that prediction and placed Florida back into the &quot;undecided&quot; column. At approximately 2:30 a.m., with some 85% of the votes counted in Florida and Bush leading Gore by more than 100,000 votes, the networks declared that Bush had carried Florida and therefore had been elected President. However, most of the remaining votes to be counted in Florida were located in three heavily Democratic counties—[[Broward County, Florida|Broward]], [[Miami-Dade County|Miami-Dade]], and [[Palm Beach County|Palm Beach]]—and as their votes were reported Gore began to gain on Bush. By 4:30 a.m., after all votes were counted, Gore had narrowed Bush's margin to just over 2,000 votes, and the networks retracted their predictions that Bush had won Florida and the presidency. Gore, who had privately conceded the election to Bush,&lt;!-- ref name=&quot;timemag&quot;/ --&gt; withdrew his concession. The final result in Florida was slim enough to require a mandatory recount (by machine) under state law; Bush's lead had dwindled to about 300 votes by the time it was completed later that week. A count of overseas military ballots later boosted his margin to about 900 votes.
[[File:FlaSupremeCrtBldgFeb08.JPG|thumb|right|Florida Supreme Court]]
At 4 AM EST on election night, NBC pundit Jonathan Alter predicted that Florida and the entire election would be settled in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OOaaUackKFQ |title=Election 2000 Florida, Florida, Florida |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-11-12 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the post-electoral controversy revolved around Gore's request for hand recounts in four counties (Broward, Miami Dade, Palm Beach, and [[Volusia County, Florida|Volusia]]), as provided under Florida state law. [[Florida Secretary of State]] [[Katherine Harris]] announced she would reject any revised totals from those counties if they were not turned in by November 14, the statutory deadline for amended returns. The [[Florida Supreme Court]] extended the deadline to November 26, a decision later [[vacated]] by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]]. Miami-Dade eventually halted its recount and resubmitted its original total to the state canvassing board, while Palm Beach County failed to meet the extended deadline. On November 26, the state canvassing board certified Bush the winner of Florida's electors by 537 votes. Gore formally contested the certified results, but a state court decision overruling Gore was reversed by the Florida Supreme Court, which ordered a recount of over 70,000 ballots previously rejected by machine counters. The U.S. Supreme Court quickly halted that order the next day with the concurring opinion that a recount of votes &quot;of questionable legality does [...] threaten irreparable harm&quot; to Bush as &quot;each manual recount produces a degradation of the ballots.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url=http://election2000.stanford.edu/00-949x.pdf
| title=SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES. No. 00-949 (00A504) Bush v. Gore, On Application For Stay| date=2000-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, the Supreme Court [[Bush v. Gore|ruled]] in a 7–2 vote that the Florida Supreme Court's ruling requiring a statewide recount of ballots was unconstitutional, and in a 5–4 vote that the Florida recounts could not be completed before a December 12 &quot;safe harbor&quot; deadline, and should therefore cease and the previously certified total should hold.

===National results===
Though Gore came in second in the electoral vote, he received 543,895 more popular votes than Bush.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2000&quot;/&gt; Gore failed to win the popular vote in his home state, [[Tennessee]], which both he and his father had represented in the Senate, making him the first major-party presidential candidate to have lost his home state since [[George McGovern]] lost [[South Dakota]] in [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972]]. Bush lost in [[Connecticut]], the state of his birth. Bush is also the first Republican in American history to win the presidency without winning Vermont or Illinois, the second Republican to win the presidency without winning California ([[James A. Garfield]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 1880|1880]] was the first), and the only winning Republican not to receive any electoral votes from California (Garfield received one vote in 1880).

==Aftermath==
===Post recount===
After Florida was decided and Gore conceded, Texas Governor George W. Bush became the [[President-elect of the United States|President-elect]] and began forming his [[Presidential transition|transition committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bush, now president-elect, signals will to bridge partisan gaps|author=Ian Christopher McCaleb|date=December 13, 2000|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/12/13/election.wrap/|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|accessdate=February 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a speech on December 13, in the Texas House of Representatives chamber,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-spanarchives.org/library/index.php?main_page=product_video_info&amp;products_id=161267-1|title=Bush Acceptance—December 13, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush stated he was reaching across party lines to bridge a divided America, saying, &quot;the President of the United States is the President of every single American, of every race, and every background.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2000/transcripts/121300/bush.html|title=George W. Bush statement—December 13, 2000 | work=CNN}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 6, 2001, a [[Joint session of the United States Congress|joint session of Congress]] met to certify the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]. Twenty members of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], most of them Democratic members of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], rose one-by-one to file objections to the electoral votes of Florida. However, according to an [[Electoral Commission (United States)|1877]] law, any such objection had to be sponsored by both a representative and a [[United States Senate|senator]]. No senator would co-sponsor these objections, deferring to the Supreme Court's ruling. Therefore, Gore, who presided in his capacity as [[Vice President of the United States|President of the Senate]], ruled each of these objections out of order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/browse/collection.action?collectionCode=CREC&amp;browsePath=2001%2F01%2F01-06\%2F7&amp;isCollapsed=false&amp;leafLevelBrowse=false&amp;ycord=482 ''Congressional Record'' for January 6, 2001], page found 2012-03-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the joint session of Congress certified the electoral votes from all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Bush took the oath of office on January 20, 2001. He would serve for the next 8 years. Meanwhile, Gore declined to run for president in 2004 and 2008.

The first independent recount was conducted by The Miami Herald and USA Today. The Commission found that under most recount scenarios, Bush would have won the election, but Gore would have won using the most generous standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/media/media_watch/jan-june01/recount_4-3.html|title=Media Recount: Bush Won The 2000 election}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, a media consortium — comprising the New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Tribune Co. (parent of the L.A. Times), Associated Press, CNN, Palm Beach Post and St. Petersburg Times&lt;ref name=&quot;fair2002&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1095|title=Who Won the Election? Who Cares?|publisher=fair.org|date= |accessdate=2012-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; — hired the [[National Opinion Research Center]] at the [[University of Chicago]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norc.uchicago.edu/fl/index.asp|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20011217183836/http://www.norc.uchicago.edu/fl/index.asp|archivedate=Dec. 17, 2001 |title=Florida Ballots Project |publisher=Norc.uchicago.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  to examine 175,010 ballots that were collected from the entire state, not just the disputed counties that were discounted; these ballots contained undervotes (votes with no choice made for president) and overvotes (votes made with more than one choice marked). Their goal was to determine the reliability and accuracy of the systems used for the voting process. The NORC concluded that if the disputes over the validity of all the ballots statewide in question had been consistently resolved and ''any'' uniform standard applied, the electoral result would have been reversed and Gore would have won by 107-115 votes if only two of the three coders had to agree on the ballot.  When counting ballots wherein all three coders agreed, Gore would have won the most restrictive scenario by 127 votes and Bush would have won the most inclusive scenario by 110 votes.&lt;ref&gt;Wolter, K.M., Jergovic, D., Moore, W., Murphy, J. and O'Muirheartaigh, C. 2003. &quot;Reliability of the Uncertified Ballots in the 2000 Presidential Election in Florida.&quot; American Statistician, 57(1):1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent analyses cast further doubt on conclusions that Bush likely would have won anyway, had the U.S. Supreme Court not intervened. An analysis of the NORC data by [[University of Pennsylvania]] researcher Steven F. Freeman and journalist [[Joel Bleifuss]] concluded that a recount of all uncounted votes using any standard (inclusive, strict, statewide or county by county), Gore would have been the victor&lt;ref name=&quot;freemanbleifuss&quot;&gt;Freeman, Steven &amp; Bleifuss, Joel. Was the 2004 presidential election stolen?: exit polls, election fraud, and the official count. Seven Stories Press, 2006, p. 41-47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Such a statewide review including all uncounted votes was a very real possibility, as Leon County Circuit Court Judge Terry Lewis, whom the Florida Supreme Court had assigned to oversee the statewide recount, had scheduled a hearing for December 13 (mooted by the U.S. Supreme Court's final ruling on the 12th) to consider the question of including overvotes as well as undervotes, and subsequent statements by Judge Lewis and internal court documents support the liklihood of including overvotes in the recount.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek2001&quot; /&gt; [[Florida State University]] professor of public policy Lance deHaven-Smith observed that, even considering only undervotes, &quot;under any of the five most reasonable interpretations of the Florida Supreme Court ruling, Gore does, in fact, more than make up the deficit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;deHaven-Smith, Lance. The Battle for Florida: An Annotated Compendium of Materials from the 2000 Presidential Election. University Press of Florida, 2005, p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]]'s analysis of the NORC study and media coverage of it supports these interpretations and criticizes the coverage of the study by media outlets such as the [[New York Times]] and the other media consortium members.&lt;ref name=&quot;fair2002&quot; /&gt;

===Voting machines===
Because the 2000 presidential election was so close in Florida, the United States government and state governments pushed for [[election reform]] to be prepared by the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 United States Presidential Election]]. Many of Florida's year 2000 election night problems stemmed from [[usability]] and ballot design factors with voting systems, including the potentially confusing &quot;[[butterfly ballot]]&quot;. Many voters had difficulties with the paper-based [[Voting machine#Punch card|punch card]] voting machines and were either unable to understand the required process for voting or unable to perform the process. This resulted in an unusual amount of [[overvote]] (voting for more candidates than is allowed) and [[undervote]]s (voting for fewer than the minimum candidates, including none at all). Many undervotes were potentially caused by either voter error or errors with the punch card paper ballots resulting in hanging, dimpled, or pregnant [[Chad (paper)|chad]].

A proposed solution to these problems was the installation of modern [[electronic voting]] machines. The United States Presidential Election of 2000 spurred the debate about election and voting reform, but it did not end it.

===Exit polling and declaration of vote winners===
The [[Voter News Service]]'s reputation was damaged by its treatment of Florida's presidential vote in 2000. Breaking its own guidelines, VNS called the state as a win for Gore 12 minutes before polls closed in the [[Florida Panhandle|Florida panhandle]]. Although most of the state is in the Eastern Time Zone, counties in the Florida panhandle, located in the Central Time Zone, had not yet closed its polls. More seriously, inconsistent polling results caused the VNS to change its call twice, first from Gore to Bush, and then to &quot;too close to call&quot;.

Also, charges of media bias were levied against the networks by Republicans. They claimed that the networks called states more quickly for Al Gore than for George W. Bush. Congress held hearings on this matter and the networks claimed to have no intentional bias in their election night reporting. However, a study of the calls made on election night 2000 indicated that states carried by Gore were called more quickly than states won by Bush; however, notable Bush states, like New Hampshire and Florida, were very close, and close Gore states like New Mexico were called late too.&lt;ref&gt;Uscinski, Joseph. 2007. &quot;Too Close Too Call? Uncertainty and Bias in Election Night Reporting&quot; Social Science Quarterly vol. 88,(1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===More consequences===
In the aftermath of the election, the [[Help America Vote Act]] (HAVA) was passed to help states upgrade their election technology in the hopes of preventing similar problems in future elections. Unfortunately, the electronic voting systems that many states purchased to comply with HAVA actually caused problems in the presidential election of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Freeman, Steven &amp; Bleifuss, Joel. Was the 2004 election stolen?: exit polls, election fraud, and the official count. Seven Stories Press, 2006, p. 68-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Democrats blame third party candidate [[Ralph Nader]], claiming he [[vote splitting|split votes]] with Gore. Nader received 97,000 votes in Florida (for comparison, there were 111,251 [[overvotes]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2001-05-10-overvotetable.htm | work=USA Today | title=Overvote county summary | date=May 10, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, Nader received 22,000 votes in New Hampshire, where Bush beat Gore by 7,000 votes.  Either state would have won the election for Gore.  Defenders of Nader, including [[Tom Tomorrow|Dan Perkins]], argued that the margin in Florida was small enough that Democrats could blame any number of third-party candidates for the defeat, including [[Workers World Party]] candidate [[Monica Moorehead]], who received 1,500 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.salon.com/comics/tomo/2000/11/13/tomo/index.html|title=This Modern World|publisher=Salon.com Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the controversy with Nader also drained energy from the Democratic party as divisive debate went on in the months leading up to the election. Nader's reputation was hurt by this perception, and may have hindered his goals as an activist. For example, ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' wrote, &quot;For evidence of how rank-and-file liberals have turned against Nader, one need look no further than the empire he created. [[Public Citizen]], the organization (Nader) founded in 1971, has a new fundraising problem&amp;mdash;its founder. After the election, contributions dropped... When people inquire about Nader's relationship to the organization, Public Citizen sends out a letter that begins with a startling new disclaimer: 'Although Ralph Nader was our founder, he has not held an official position in the organization since 1980 and does not serve on the board. Public Citizen&amp;mdash;and the other groups that Mr. Nader founded&amp;mdash;act independently.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Margolis, John (July/August 2001) [http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2001/07/nader.html Nader Unrepentant]. ''Mother Jones''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Democratic party strategist and [[Democratic Leadership Council]] (DLC) chair [[Al From]] expressed a different view. In the January 24, 2001, issue&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndol.org/ndol_ci.cfm?kaid=86&amp;subid=84&amp;contentid=2919 |title=Building A New Progressive Majority by Al From |publisher=DLC |date=2001-01-24 |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the DLC's ''Blueprint'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndol.org/ndol_ka.cfm?kaid=132 |title=Democratic Leadership Council: Blueprint Magazine |publisher=Ndol.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; he wrote, &quot;I think they're wrong on all counts. The assertion that Nader's marginal vote hurt Gore is not borne out by polling data. When exit pollers asked voters how they would have voted in a two-way race, Bush actually won by a point. That was better than he did with Nader in the race.&quot;
