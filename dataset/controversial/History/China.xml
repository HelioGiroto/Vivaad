'''China''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-China.ogg|ˈ|tʃ|aɪ|n|ə}}; {{zh | s=中国| hp=Zhōngguó}}; see also [[Names of China]]), officially the '''People's Republic of China''' ('''PRC'''), is a country in [[East Asia]]. It is the world's [[List of countries by population|most populous country]], with [[Demographics of the People's Republic of China|a population of over 1.3&amp;nbsp;billion]]. Covering approximately 9.6&amp;nbsp;million square kilometres, the country is the world's [[List of countries and outlying territories by land area|second-largest country by land area]],&lt;ref name=&quot;listofcountriesoftheworld.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.listofcountriesoftheworld.com/area-land.html |title=Countries of the world ordered by land area|publisher=Listofcountriesoftheworld.com |accessdate=27 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|third- or fourth-largest by total area]], depending on the definition of total area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_b&quot;&gt;The total area ranking relative to the United States depends on the measurement of the total areas of China and the United States.

The PRC government denies the legitimacy of the ROC.

China's landscape is vast and diverse, with [[Mongolian-Manchurian grassland|forest steppes]] and the [[Gobi Desert|Gobi]] and [[Taklamakan Desert|Taklamakan]] deserts occupying the arid north and northwest near [[Mongolia]] and Central Asia, and [[subtropical]] forests being prevalent in the wetter south near Southeast Asia. The terrain of western China is rugged and elevated, with the [[Himalaya]], [[Karakoram]], [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] and [[Tian Shan]] mountain ranges separating China from South and Central Asia. The [[Yangtze River|Yangtze]] and [[Yellow River]]s, the [[List of rivers by length|third- and sixth-longest in the world]], have their sources in the [[Tibetan Plateau]] and continue to the densely populated eastern seaboard. China's coastline along the Pacific Ocean is {{convert|14500|km|mi}} long—the [[List of countries by length of coastline|11th-longest in the world]]—and is bounded by the [[Bohai Sea|Bohai]], [[Yellow Sea|Yellow]], [[East China Sea|East]] and [[South China Sea]]s.

The nation of China has had numerous [[History of China|historical incarnations]]. The [[History_of_China#Ancient_era|ancient Chinese civilization]]—one of the world's earliest—flourished in the fertile basin of the Yellow River in the [[North China Plain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/features/China2004/106396.htm |title=Rivers and Lakes  |publisher=China.org.cn |accessdate=15 June 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; China's political system was based on hereditary monarchies, known as [[Dynasties in Chinese history|dynasties]], beginning with the semi-mythological [[Xia Dynasty|Xia]] of the Yellow River basin (approx. 2000 BC) and ending with the fall of the [[Qing Dynasty]] in 1911.  Since 221 BC, when the [[Qin Dynasty]] first conquered several states to form a Chinese empire, the country has expanded, fractured and been reformed numerous times.  The [[Republic of China (1912-1949)|Republic of China]], founded in 1911 after the overthrow of the Qing dynasty, ruled the [[mainland China|Chinese mainland]] until 1949. In 1945, the ROC acquired Taiwan from [[Japan]] following [[World War II]].

In the 1946–1949 phase of the Chinese Civil War, the Chinese Communist Party defeated the nationalist [[Kuomintang]] in mainland China and established the People's Republic of China in Beijing on 1 October 1949. The Kuomintang relocated the ROC government to Taiwan, establishing its capital in [[Taipei]]. The ROC's jurisdiction is now limited to Taiwan and several outlying islands, including [[Penghu]], [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]]. Since 1949, the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China (now widely known as &quot;Taiwan&quot;) have remained in dispute over the [[sovereignty]] of China and the political status of Taiwan, mutually claiming each other's territory and competing for international [[diplomatic recognition]].  In 1971, the PRC gained admission to the [[United Nations]] and took the [[China and the United Nations|Chinese seat]] as a [[Permanent members of the United Nations Security Council|permanent member]] of the [[United Nations Security Council|U.N. Security Council]]. China is also a member of numerous formal and informal multilateral organizations, including the [[World Trade Organization|WTO]], [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation|APEC]], [[BRICS]], the [[Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]], the [[BCIM]] and the [[G-20 major economies|G-20]]. As of August 2012, all but [[Foreign relations of the Republic of China|23 countries]] have recognized the PRC as the [[One-China policy|sole legitimate government of China]].

Since the introduction of [[Chinese economic reform|economic reforms in 1978]], China has become the world's [[List of countries by real GDP growth rate|fastest-growing]] major economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.economist.com/node/21543570|title=Output, prices and jobs|date=28 January 2012|accessdate=28 January 2012|work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, it is the world's second-largest economy, after the United States, by both [[List of countries by GDP (nominal)|nominal GDP]] and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP)|purchasing power parity (PPP)]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Altucher2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | title=There's no stopping China |work=New York Post | date=8 January 2010 | url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/there_no_stopping_china_0H8GJaMgzHCYenL038Yh2N | accessdate=2 August 2010 | first=James | last=Altucher}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is also the world's [[List of countries by exports|largest exporter]] and [[List of countries by imports|second-largest importer]] of goods. On a [[per capita income]] basis, China ranked [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|90th by nominal GDP]] and [[List of countries by GDP (PPP) per capita|91st by GDP (PPP)]] in 2011, according to the [[IMF]]. China is a [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty|recognized]] [[List of states with nuclear weapons|nuclear weapons state]] and has the world's [[List of countries by number of active troops|largest standing army]], with the [[List of countries by military expenditures|second-largest defense budget]].

The word &quot;China&quot; is derived from [[Persian language|Persian]] ''Cin'' (چین). It is first recorded in 1516 in the journal of Portuguese explorer [[Duarte Barbosa]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;China&quot;. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' (1989). ISBN 0199573158.&lt;br/&gt;''[http://books.google.com.vn/books?id=edzW9fuOF-cC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Very%20Great%20Kingdom%20of%20China%22&amp;f=false The Book of Duarte Barbosa]'' (chapter title &quot;The Very Great Kingdom of China&quot;). ISBN 8120604512. The Portuguese original is [http://purl.pt/435/ here]: (&quot;O Grande Reino da China&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; The word appears in English in a translation published in 1555.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Eden|Eden, Richard]] (1555). ''Decades of the New World'': &quot;The great China whose kyng is thought the greatest prince in the world.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Persian word is, in turn, derived from the [[Sanskrit]] word ''[[Chinas|Cīna]]'' (चीन),&lt;ref name=&quot;AmHer&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/China?qsrc=2888 china]&quot;, ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language,'' Boston and New York, Houghton-Mifflin, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; which was used as a name for China as early as AD 150.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fairbank&quot;&gt;Found in Book 2 of [[Kautilya]]'s ''[[Arthashastra]]''. (Denis Crispin Twitchett, Michael Loewe, John King Fairbank, ''The Ch'in and Han Empires 221 B.C.-A.D. 220'', p. 20.)&lt;/ref&gt; There are various scholarly theories regarding the origin of this word. The traditional theory, proposed in the 17th century by [[Martino Martini]], is that &quot;China&quot; is derived from &quot;Qin&quot; ({{linktext|秦}}), the westernmost of the Chinese kingdoms during the [[Zhou Dynasty]], or from the succeeding [[Qin Dynasty]] (221–206 BC).&lt;ref name=&quot;Martini&quot;&gt;Martino, Martin, ''Novus Atlas Sinensis'', Vienna 1655, Preface, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''Cīna'' is used in two [[Hindu]] scriptures – the ''[[Mahābhārata]]'' of the 5th century BC and the ''[[Manusmṛti|Laws of Manu]]'' of the 2nd century BC – to refer to a country located in the Tibetan-Burman borderlands east of [[India]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Liu&quot;&gt;Liu, Lydia He, ''The Clash of Empires'', p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wade1&quot;&gt;Wade, Geoff. &quot;[http://www.sino-platonic.org/complete/spp188_yelang_china.pdf The Polity of Yelang and the Origin of the Name 'China']&quot;. ''[[Sino-Platonic Papers]]'', No. 188, May 2009, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, common names for the country include ''Zhōngguó'' ({{zh|s=[[wikt:中国|中国]]|p=|l=the Central State(s)}}) and ''Zhōnghuá'' ({{zh|s=[[wikt:中华|中华]]|links=no}}), although the country's official name has been changed numerous times by successive [[dynasties]] and modern governments. The term ''Zhongguo'' appeared in various ancient texts, such as the ''[[Classic of History]]'' of the 6th century BC,&lt;ref&gt;尚書•梓材》:「皇天既付中國民越厥疆土于先王」 Roughly translated as &quot;The Heavens awarded the lands and peoples of ''Zhōngguó'' to our ancestors&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and in pre-imperial times it was often used as a cultural concept to distinguish the ''[[Huaxia]]'' from the barbarians. The term, which can be either singular or plural, referred to the group of states in the central plain. It was only in the nineteenth century that the term emerged as the formal name of the country. The Chinese were not unique in regarding their country as &quot;central&quot;, since other civilizations had the same view.&lt;ref&gt;Endymion Wilkinson, ''Chinese History: A Manual'' (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, Rev. and enl., 2000 ISBN 0-674-00247-4 ), 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jade deer.jpg|thumb|[[Jade]] deer ornament dating from the [[Shang Dynasty]].]]
Chinese tradition names the first imperial dynasty [[Xia Dynasty|Xia]], but it was considered mythical until scientific excavations found early [[Bronze Age]] sites at [[Erlitou culture|Erlitou]] in Henan Province in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/exhibitions/chbro_bron.shtm &quot;Bronze Age China&quot;] by [http://www.nga.gov/ National Gallery of Art]&lt;/ref&gt; Archaeologists have since uncovered urban sites, bronze implements, and tombs in locations cited as Xia's in ancient historical texts, but it is impossible to verify that these remains are of the Xia without written records from the period.

[[File:Chinesische-mauer.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The [[Great Wall of China]] was built by several dynasties over two thousand years to protect the sedentary agricultural regions of the [[China Proper|Chinese interior]] from incursions by [[nomad]]ic [[pastoralists]] of the northern [[steppes]].]]
The first Chinese dynasty that left historical records, the loosely feudal [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]] (Yin), settled along the [[Yellow River]] in eastern China from the 17th to the 11th century BC. The [[oracle bone script]] of the Shang Dynasty represents the oldest form of Chinese writing yet found, and the direct ancestor of the modern [[Chinese characters]] used throughout East Asia. The Shang were invaded from the west by the [[Zhou Dynasty|Zhou]], who ruled from the 12th to the 5th century BC, until their centralized authority was slowly eroded by feudal warlords. Many independent states eventually emerged out of the weakened Zhou state, and continually waged war with each other in the [[Spring and Autumn Period]], only occasionally deferring to the Zhou king. By the time of the [[Warring States Period]] in the 5th–3rd centuries BC, there were seven powerful sovereign states, each with its own king, ministry and army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/warringstates.htm|title=The Warring States Period of Ancient China 480 BCE to 221 BCE|publisher=[[San Jose State University]]|accessdate=22 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Imperial China ===
The first unified Chinese state was established by [[Qin Shi Huang]] of the [[Qin state]] in 221 BC. Qin Shi Huang proclaimed himself the &quot;First Emperor&quot; (始皇帝), and imposed many reforms throughout China, notably the forced standardization of the Chinese language, measurements, length of cart axles, and currency. The [[Qin Dynasty]] lasted only fifteen years, falling soon after Qin Shi Huang's death, as its harsh [[Legalism (philosophy)|legalist]] and authoritarian policies led to widespread rebellion.&lt;ref name=Bodde1986&gt;Bodde, Derk.

The subsequent [[Han Dynasty]] ruled China between 206 BC and 220 AD, and created a lasting [[Han Chinese|Han cultural identity]] among its populace that has endured to the present day.&lt;ref name=Bodde1986/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis2007/&gt; The Han Dynasty [[History of the Han Dynasty|expanded the empire's territory considerably]] with military campaigns reaching [[Korea]], Vietnam, [[Mongolia]] and Central Asia, and also helped establish the [[Silk Road]] in Central Asia.

This growth came about through expanded rice cultivation in central and southern China, and the production of abundant food surpluses.

Within its borders, the Northern Song Dynasty had a population of some 100 million people. The Song Dynasty was a culturally rich period for philosophy and the arts. [[Landscape art]] and [[portrait]] painting were brought to new levels of maturity and complexity after the Tang Dynasty, and social elites gathered to view art, share their own, and trade precious artworks. Philosophers such as [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]] and [[Chu Hsi]] reinvigorated Confucianism with new commentary, infused [[Buddhist]] ideals, and emphasized a new organization of classic texts that brought about the core doctrine of [[Neo-Confucianism]].

In 1271, the [[Mongol]] leader and fifth [[Khagan]] of the [[Mongol Empire]] [[Kublai Khan]] established the [[Yuan Dynasty]], with the last remnant of the Song Dynasty falling to the Yuan in 1279. Before the [[Mongol invasion of China|Mongol invasion]], Chinese dynasties reportedly had approximately 120 million inhabitants; after the conquest was completed in 1279, the 1300 census reported roughly 60 million people.&lt;ref&gt;Ping-ti Ho, &quot;An Estimate of the Total Population of Sung-Chin China&quot;, in ''Études Song'', Series 1, No 1, (1970) pp. 33–53.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Late dynastic rule ===
A peasant named [[Zhu Yuanzhang]] overthrew the Yuan Dynasty in 1368 and founded the [[Ming Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761580643/ming_dynasty.html Ming Dynasty]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&quot;. Microsoft Encarta Online Encyclopedia 2009. [http://www.webcitation.org/5kwQtyH2M Archived] 31 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
Under the Ming Dynasty, China enjoyed another golden age, developing one of the strongest navies in the world and a rich and prosperous economy amid a flourishing of art and culture. It was during this period that [[Zheng He]] led explorations throughout the world, reaching as far as Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/25/kenya-china | work=The Guardian | first=Xan | last=Rice | title=Chinese archaeologists' African quest for sunken ship of Ming admiral | date=25 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years of the Ming Dynasty, China's capital was moved from [[Nanjing]] to Beijing.

During the Ming Dynasty, thinkers such as [[Wang Yangming]] further critiqued and expanded Neo-Confucianism with concepts of [[individualism]] and innate morality that would have tremendous impact on later Japanese thought. [[Joseon Dynasty|Chosun Korea]] also became a nominal vassal state of Ming China, and adopted much of its Neo-Confucian bureaucratic structure.

In 1644, Beijing was sacked by a coalition of rebel forces led by [[Li Zicheng]], a minor Ming official who led the peasant revolt. The last Ming [[Chongzhen Emperor]] committed suicide when the city fell. The Manchu [[Qing Dynasty]] then allied with Ming Dynasty general [[Wu Sangui]] and overthrew Li's short-lived [[Shun Dynasty]], and subsequently seized control of Beijing, which became the new capital of the Qing Dynasty. In total, the [[Manchu conquest of China]] cost as many as 25 million lives.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Roberts (1997).

The Qing Dynasty, which lasted until 1912, was the last imperial dynasty of China. In the 19th century, the Qing Dynasty adopted a defensive posture towards European [[imperialism]], even though it engaged in an [[Imperialism in Asia|imperialistic expansion]] of its own into Central Asia. At this time, China awoke to the significance of the rest of the world, the West in particular. As China opened up to foreign trade and missionary activity, [[opium]] produced by [[British India]] was forced onto Qing China. Two [[Opium Wars]] with Britain weakened the Emperor's control. Western imperialism proved to be disastrous for China:  &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The end of the Opium War marked the beginning of Western imperialism in China. Unequal treaties, imposed at the end of the war, forced China to relinquish Hong Kong, open new &quot;Treaty Ports&quot; to foreign trade, pay indemnities to her vanquishers, and allow foreigners to live and work on Chinese soil free of the jurisdiction of Chinese law (extraterritoriality). Over the years new wars with Western powers would expand these impositions on China's national sovereignty, culminating in the Treaty of Shimonoseki, which ended the Sino-Japanese War of 1894- 95.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ainslie Thomas Embree, Carol Gluck (1997).

[[File:Regaining the Provincial Capital of Ruizhou.jpg|thumb|280px|left|A 19th-century painting depicting the [[Taiping Rebellion]] of 1850–1864.]]
The weakening of the Qing regime, and the apparent humiliation of the unequal treaties in the eyes of the Chinese people, led to increasing domestic disorder. In late 1850, southern China erupted in the [[Taiping Rebellion]], a violent civil war which lasted until 1864. The rebellion was led by [[Hong Xiuquan]], who was partly influenced by an idiosyncratic interpretation of [[Christianity]]. Hong believed himself to be the son of God and the younger brother of Jesus. Although the Qing forces were eventually victorious, the civil war was one of the bloodiest in human history, costing at least 20 million lives (more than the total number of fatalities in World War I), with some estimates of up to 40 million. Other costly rebellions followed the Taiping Rebellion, such as the [[Punti-Hakka Clan Wars]] (1855–67), [[Nien Rebellion]] (1851–1868), Miao Rebellion (1854–73), [[Panthay Rebellion]] (1856–1873) and the [[Dungan revolt (1862–1877)]].&lt;ref&gt;Jenks, R.D.

[[File:Great Rear Attack by Our Second Army at Weihaiwei.jpg|thumb|230px|In the [[First Sino-Japanese War]] of 1894–95, which was fought over influence in Korea, Japanese troops defeated Qing forces.]]
While China was wracked by continuous war, [[Meiji Japan]] succeeded in rapidly modernizing its military, and set its sights on the conquest of Korea and [[Manchuria]]. At the request of the Korean emperor, the Qing government sent troops to aid in suppressing the [[Tonghak Rebellion]] in 1894. However, Japan also sent troops to Korea, leading to the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], which resulted in Qing China's loss of influence in the [[Korean Peninsula]] as well as the cession of [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]] (including the Pescadores) to Japan.

Following this series of defeats, [[Hundred Days' Reform|a reform plan]] for the empire to become a modern Meiji-style [[constitutional monarchy]] was drafted by the [[Guangxu Emperor]] in 1898, but was opposed and stopped by the [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], who placed Emperor Guangxu under house arrest in a coup d'état. The ill-fated [[Boxer Rebellion]] of 1898–1901, in which westerners in Beijing were targeted ''en masse'', resulted in as many as 115,000 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rissc.jo/books/en/005-Body-Count-Violence-Civilizations.pdf|title=Body Count: a quantitative review

By the early 20th century, mass civil disorder had begun, and calls for reform and revolution were heard across the country. The 38-year-old Emperor Guangxu died under house arrest on 14 November 1908, suspiciously just a day before Cixi's own death. With the throne empty, he was succeeded by Cixi's handpicked heir, his two-year-old nephew [[Puyi]], who became the Xuantong Emperor. Guangxu's consort became the [[Empress Dowager Longyu]]. In another coup d'état in 1912, [[Yuan Shikai]] overthrew Puyi, and forced Longyu to sign the abdication decree as regent, ending over two thousand years of imperial rule in China. Longyu died, childless, in 1913.

In 1915, Yuan proclaimed himself [[Empire of China (1915–1916)|Emperor of China]], but was forced to abdicate and reestablish the republic in the face of popular condemnation, not only from the general population but also from among his own Beiyang Army and its commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Haw, (2006).

The [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] (1937–1945), a part of [[World War II]], forced an uneasy alliance between the Kuomintang and the Communists. The Japanese &quot;[[Three Alls Policy|three-all policy]]&quot; in northern China—''&quot;kill all, burn all and destroy all&quot;''—led to numerous [[Japanese war crimes|war atrocities]] being committed against the civilian population; in all, as many as 20 million Chinese civilians were killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/worldwars/wwtwo/nuclear_01.shtml &quot;Nuclear Power: The End of the War Against Japan&quot;].

=== People's Republic of China (1949–present) ===
{{Main|History of the People's Republic of China}}

Major combat in the [[Chinese Civil War]] ended in 1949 with the Communist Party in control of [[mainland China]], and the Kuomintang retreating offshore, reducing the ROC's territory to only [[Taiwan (island)|Taiwan]], Hainan, and their surrounding islands. On 1 October 1949, [[Mao Zedong]] proclaimed the People's Republic of China,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_c&quot;&gt;[http://www.isop.ucla.edu/eas/documents/mao490921.htm The Chinese people have stood up].

Greenwood Publishing Group, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; Mao's rule proved to be disastrous for China:

ISBN 0691027773.&lt;/ref&gt;}} In 1966, Mao and his allies launched the [[Cultural Revolution]], which would last until Mao's death a decade later. The Cultural Revolution, motivated by power struggles within the Party and a fear of the [[Soviet Union]], led to a major upheaval in Chinese society. In October 1971, the PRC [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758|replaced the Republic of China]] in the United Nations, and took its seat as a permanent member of the Security Council. In that same year, for the first time, the number of countries recognizing the PRC surpassed those recognizing the ROC in Taipei as the government of China.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Y.M. Kao, &quot;Taiwan's and Beijing's Campaigns for Unification,&quot; in Harvey Feldman, Michael Y.M. Kao, eds., ''Taiwan in a Time of Transition'' (New York: Paragon House, 1988), 188.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1972, at the peak of the [[Sino-Soviet split]], Mao and [[Zhou Enlai]] met [[Richard Nixon]] in Beijing. However, the U.S. did not [[Joint Communiqué on the Establishment of Diplomatic Relations|officially recognise]] the PRC as China's sole legitimate government until 1 January 1979.

After Mao's death in 1976 and the arrest of the [[Gang of Four]], who were blamed for the excesses of the Cultural Revolution, [[Deng Xiaoping]] quickly wrested power from Mao's anointed successor [[Hua Guofeng]]. Although he never became the head of the party or state himself, Deng was in fact the [[Paramount Leader]] of China at that time, his influence within the Party led the country to [[Chinese economic reform|significant economic reforms]]. The Communist Party subsequently loosened governmental control over citizens' personal lives and the [[People's commune|communes]] were disbanded with many peasants receiving multiple land leases, which greatly increased incentives and agricultural production. This turn of events marked China's transition from a planned economy to a mixed economy with an increasingly open market environment, a system termed by some &quot;[[market socialism]]&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_e&quot;&gt;Hart-Landsberg, Martin; and Burkett, Paul.

China adopted its current [[constitution of the People's Republic of China|constitution]] on 4 December 1982.

The death of pro-reform official [[Hu Yaobang]] helped to spark the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], during which students and others campaigned for several months, speaking out against corruption and in favour of greater political reform, including democratic rights and freedom of speech. However, they were eventually put down on 4 June when [[People's Liberation Army|PLA]] troops and vehicles entered and forcibly cleared the square, resulting in numerous casualties. This event was widely reported and brought worldwide condemnation and sanctions against the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_f&quot;&gt;Youngs, R.

[[File:Shanghai Pudong.jpg|thumb|left|The city of Shanghai has become a symbol of China's rapid economic expansion since the 1990s.]]
President [[Jiang Zemin]] and Premier [[Zhu Rongji]], both former mayors of Shanghai, led the nation in the 1990s. Under Jiang and Zhu's ten years of administration, China's economic performance pulled an estimated 150&amp;nbsp;million peasants out of poverty and sustained an average annual gross domestic product growth rate of 11.2%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_h&quot;&gt;[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/en/doc/2003-07/11/content_244499.htm ''Nation bucks trend of global poverty''] (11 July 2003).

=== Political geography ===
The People's Republic of China is the [[List of countries and outlying territories by land area|second-largest]] country in the world by land area after [[Russia]]&lt;ref name=&quot;listofcountriesoftheworld.com&quot; /&gt; and is either the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|third- or fourth-largest]] by total area, after Russia, Canada and, depending on the definition of total area, the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_aq&quot;&gt;[http://www.fco.gov.uk/servlet/Front?pagename=OpenMarket/Xcelerate/ShowPage&amp;c=Page&amp;cid=1007029394365&amp;a=KCountryProfile&amp;aid=1018965313021 &quot;The People's Republic of China&quot;] (7 September 2005).

According to the ''Encyclopædia Britannica'', the total area of the United States, at {{convert|9522055|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, is slightly smaller than that of China. Meanwhile, the CIA World Factbook states that China's total area was greater than that of the United States until the coastal waters of the [[Great Lakes]] was added to the United States' total area in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;The CIA has updated the total area of United States a number of times since the initial publication of the World Factbook. From 1989 through 1996, the total area of US was listed as {{convert|9372610|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} (land area plus inland water only). The listed total area changed to {{convert|9629091|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in 1997 (with the Great Lakes areas and the coastal waters added), to {{convert|9631418|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in 2004, to {{convert|9631420|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in 2006, and to {{convert|9826630|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in 2007 (territorial waters added). Note: From 1989 to 1996, China was listed as the world's third-largest country by total area according to the CIA World Factbook. The United States replaced China in 1997 after additional water spaces were added.&lt;/ref&gt;

China has the [[List of land border lengths|longest combined land border in the world]], measuring  {{convert|22117|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the mouth of the [[Yalu River]] to the [[Gulf of Tonkin]]. China borders 14 nations, [[List of countries by number of neighbouring countries|more than any other country]] except Russia, which also borders 14. China extends across much of East Asia, bordering [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], and [[Burma]] in Southeast Asia; India, [[Bhutan]], Nepal and [[Pakistan]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_at&quot;&gt;China's border with Pakistan falls in the disputed [[Kashmir]] province. The area under Pakistani-administration is claimed by India.&lt;/ref&gt; in South Asia; [[Afghanistan]], Tajikistan, [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Kazakhstan]] in Central Asia; a small section of [[Altai Republic|Russian Altai]] and [[Mongolia]] in [[Inner Asia]]; and the [[Russian Far East]] and [[North Korea]] in Northeast Asia.

Additionally, China shares maritime boundaries with [[South Korea]], Japan, Vietnam and the [[Philippines]]. The PRC and the Republic of China (Taiwan) make mutual claims over each other's territory and the frontier between areas under their respective control is closest near the islands of [[Kinmen]] and [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], off the [[Fujian]] coast, but otherwise run through the [[Taiwan Strait]].  The PRC and ROC assert identical claims over the entirety of the [[Spratly Islands]] in the [[South China Sea]], and the southern-most extent of these claims reach [[Zengmu Ansha|''Zengmu Ansha'' (James Shoal)]], which would form a maritime frontier with [[Malaysia]].

The territory of China lies between [[latitude]]s [[18th parallel north|18°]] and [[54th parallel north|54° N]], and [[longitude]]s [[73rd meridian east|73°]] and [[135th meridian east|135° E]]. China's landscapes vary significantly across its vast width. In the east, along the shores of the [[Yellow Sea]] and the [[East China Sea]], there are extensive and densely populated [[alluvium|alluvial plains]], while on the edges of the Inner Mongolian plateau in the north, broad [[grassland]]s predominate. Southern China is dominated by hills and low mountain ranges, while the central-east hosts the [[river delta|deltas]] of China's two major rivers, the [[Yellow River]] and the [[Yangtze River]]. Other major rivers include the [[Xi River|Xi]], [[Mekong]], [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]] and [[Amur River|Amur]]. To the west, major mountain ranges, most notably the Himalayas, and high [[plateau]]s feature among the more arid landscapes of the north, such as the [[Taklamakan Desert|Taklamakan]] and the [[Gobi Desert]]. The world's highest point, [[Mt. Everest]] (8848m), lies on the Sino-Nepalese border. The country's lowest point, and the world's fourth-lowest, is the dried lake bed of [[Ayding Lake]] (−154m) in the [[Turpan Depression]].

A major environmental issue in China is the continued [[desertification|expansion of its deserts]], particularly the Gobi Desert, which is currently [[List of deserts by area|the world's fifth-largest desert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gobidesert.org/content/facts|title=Gobi Desert Facts|accessdate=24 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_au&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/4915690.stm &quot;Beijing hit by eighth sandstorm&quot;].

China's climate is mainly dominated by [[dry season]]s and wet [[monsoons]], which lead to pronounced temperature differences between winter and summer. In the winter, northern winds coming from high-latitude areas are cold and dry; in summer, southern winds from coastal areas at lower latitudes are warm and moist. The climate in China differs from region to region because of the country's highly complex [[topography]].

In the Palearctic zone, mammals such as the horse, [[camel]], [[tapir]], and [[jerboa]] can be found. Among the species found in the Indomalaya region are the [[Leopard Cat]], [[bamboo rat]], [[treeshrew]], and various [[monkey]] and [[ape]] species. Some overlap exists between the two regions due to natural dispersal and migration; [[deer]], [[antelope]], bears, [[Gray wolf|wolves]], pigs, and numerous rodent species can all be found in China's diverse climatic and geological environments. The [[giant panda]], an emblem of modern China, is found only in a limited area along the Yangtze River. [[Wildlife trade|Illegal trading in endangered species]] is rife in China, although there are now laws to prohibit such activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/mar2010/2010-03-17-02.html|title=China's Illegal Wildlife Trade in Tigers, Turtles, Timber|publisher=Environment News Service|date=17 March 2010|accessdate=27 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China also hosts a variety of forest types. Cold [[coniferous]] forests predominate in the north of the country, supporting animal species such as [[moose]] and the [[Asian black bear]], along with over 120 bird species. Moist [[conifer]] forests can have thickets of [[bamboo]] as an understorey, replaced by [[rhododendron]]s in higher montane stands of [[juniper]] and [[taxus|yew]]. [[Subtropical]] forests, which dominate central and southern China, support as many as 146,000 species of flora. Tropical and seasonal [[rainforest]]s, though confined to [[Yunnan]] and [[Hainan Island]], contain a quarter of all the plant and animal species found in China.

Much of China's current foreign policy is reportedly based on [[Zhou Enlai]]'s [[Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence]]—non-interference in other states' affairs, non-aggression, peaceful coexistence, equality and mutual benefits. China's foreign policy is also driven by the concept of &quot;harmony without uniformity&quot;, which encourages diplomatic relations between states despite ideological differences. This policy has led China to support states that are [[rogue state|regarded as dangerous]] or repressive by Western nations, such as [[Zimbabwe]], North Korea, and [[Iran]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Keith&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Keith|first=Ronald C.|title=China from the inside out – fitting the People's republic into the world|publisher=PlutoPress}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conflicts with foreign countries have occurred at times in China's recent history, particularly with the United States; for example, the [[U.S. bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|US bombing of the Chinese embassy]] in Belgrade during the [[Kosovo War|Kosovo conflict]] in May 1999 and the [[Hainan Island incident|US-China spy plane incident]] in April 2001.

In recent decades, China has played an increasing role in calling for [[free trade area]]s and security pacts amongst its Asia-Pacific neighbors.

The [[Chinese democracy movement]], social activists, and some members of the Communist Party of China have all identified the need for social and political reform. While economic and social controls have been greatly relaxed in China since the 1970s, [[political freedom]] is still tightly restricted. The [[Constitution of the People's Republic of China]] states that the &quot;fundamental rights&quot; of citizens include [[freedom of speech]], [[freedom of the press]], the [[right to a fair trial]], [[freedom of religion]], [[universal suffrage]], and [[property|property rights]]. However, in practice, these provisions do not afford significant protection against criminal prosecution by the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_ah&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/en/world-report-2009/china |title=Human Rights Watch, World Report 2009 |publisher=Hrw.org |accessdate=14 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_ai&quot;&gt;''Will the Boat Sink the Water?: The Life of China's Peasants'' / [[Chen Guidi]] and Wu Chuntao (2006) ISBN 1-58648-358-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_aj&quot;&gt;''Empire of Lies: The Truth About China in the Twenty-First Century'' / [[Guy Sorman]] (2008) ISBN 1-59403-216-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Chinese politicians have spoken out in favor of reforms, while others remain more conservative. In 2010, Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] stated that China needs &quot;to gradually improve the democratic election system so that state power will truly belong to the people and state power will be used to serve the people.&quot; Despite his status, Wen's comments were later censored by the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/13/AR2010101306347.html &quot;Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao talks reform, but most countrymen never get to hear what he says&quot;].

As the social, cultural and political consequences of economic growth and reform become increasingly manifest, tensions between the conservatives and reformists in the Communist Party are sharpening.

Under the post-Mao market reforms, a wide variety of small-scale private enterprises were encouraged, while the government relaxed price controls and promoted foreign investment. Foreign trade was focused upon as a major vehicle of growth, leading to the creation of [[Special Economic Zone]]s (SEZs), first in [[Shenzhen]] and then in other Chinese cities. Inefficient [[Government-owned corporation|state-owned enterprises]] (SOEs) were restructured by introducing western-style management systems, with unprofitable ones being closed outright, resulting in massive job losses. By the latter part of 2010, China was reversing some of its economic liberalization initiatives, with state-owned companies buying up independent businesses in the steel, auto and energy industries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2010-11-23/china-s-state-planned-economy-is-doomed-to-flop-david-pauly.html &quot;China's State-Planned Economy Is Doomed to Flop: David Pauly&quot;] ''Bloomberg''.

China was a world leader in science and technology until the [[Ming Dynasty]]. Ancient [[List of Chinese discoveries|Chinese discoveries]] and [[List of Chinese inventions|inventions]], such as [[papermaking]], [[History of typography in East Asia|printing]], the [[compass]], and [[gunpowder]] (the [[Four Great Inventions]]), contributed to the economic development of Asia and Europe. However, Chinese scientific activity entered a prolonged decline in the fourteenth century. Unlike European scientists, medieval Chinese thinkers did not attempt to reduce observations of nature to mathematical laws, and they did not form a scholarly community offering [[peer review]] and progressive research. There was an increasing concentration on literature, the arts, and public administration, while science and technology were seen as trivial or restricted to limited practical applications.&lt;ref name=LOC&gt;Donald D. DeGlopper (1987), [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/cntoc.html Chapter 9 – Science and Technology, ''A Country Study: China''], Library of Congress.

After repeated military defeats by Western nations in the 19th century, Chinese reformers began promoting modern science and technology as part of the [[Self-Strengthening Movement]]. After the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War in 1949, efforts were made to organize science and technology based on the model of the [[Soviet Union]]. However, Mao Zedong's [[Cultural Revolution]] of 1966–76 had a catastrophic effect on Chinese research, as academics were persecuted and the training of scientists and engineers was severely curtailed for nearly a decade. After Mao's death in 1976, science and technology was established as one of the [[Four Modernizations]], and the Soviet-inspired academic system was gradually reformed.&lt;ref name=LOC/&gt;

The languages most spoken in China belong to the [[Sino-Tibetan language]] family. There are also several major [[Varieties of Chinese|linguistic groups]] within the Chinese language itself. The most spoken varieties are [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] (natively spoken by over 70% of the population), [[Wu Chinese|Wu]] (includes [[Shanghainese]]), [[Yue Chinese|Yue]] (includes [[Cantonese]] and [[Taishanese]]), [[Min Chinese|Min]] (includes [[Hokkien]] and [[Teochew dialect|Teochew]]), [[Xiang Chinese|Xiang]], [[Gan Chinese|Gan]], and [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]].

''URL accessed 3 May 2006.''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Standard Chinese|Standard Mandarin]], a variety of Mandarin based on the [[Beijing dialect]], is the official national language of China and is used as a [[lingua franca]] between people of different linguistic backgrounds.

[[Classical Chinese]] was the written standard in China for thousands of years, and allowed for written communication between speakers of various unintelligible languages and dialects in China. [[Written vernacular Chinese]], or ''baihua'', is the written standard, based on the Mandarin dialect and first popularized in Ming Dynasty novels. It was adopted, with significant modifications, during the early 20th century as the national standard. Classical Chinese is still part of the high school curriculum, and is thus intelligible to some degree to many Chinese. Since their promulgation by the government in 1956, [[Simplified Chinese characters]] have become the official standardized [[writing system|written script]] used to [[Written Chinese|write the Chinese language]] within mainland China, supplanting the use of the earlier [[Traditional Chinese characters]].

Since ancient times, Chinese culture has been heavily influenced by [[Confucianism]] and conservative philosophies. For much of the country's dynastic era, opportunities for social advancement could be provided by high performance in the prestigious [[Imperial examination]]s, which were instituted in 605 AD to help the Emperor select skilful bureaucrats. The literary emphasis of the exams affected the general perception of cultural refinement in China, such as the belief that [[Chinese calligraphy|calligraphy]] and literati [[Chinese painting|painting]] were higher forms of art than dancing or drama. Chinese culture has long emphasized a sense of deep history and a largely inward-looking national perspective.&lt;ref name=ChinaFuture/&gt;

A number of more authoritarian and [[rationalism|rational]] strains of thought were also influential, with [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]] being a prominent example. There was often conflict between the philosophies – for instance, the individualistic [[Song Dynasty]] [[Neo-Confucianism|neo-Confucians]] believed that Legalism departed from the original spirit of Confucianism. Examinations and a [[meritocracy|culture of merit]] remain greatly valued in China today. In recent years, a number of [[New Confucianism|New Confucians]] have claimed that modern democratic ideals and human rights are compatible with traditional Confucian values.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_abcdee&quot;&gt;Bary, Theodore de.

The first leaders of the People's Republic of China were born into the traditional imperial order, but were influenced by the [[May Fourth Movement]] and reformist ideals. They sought to change some traditional aspects of Chinese culture, such as rural land tenure, [[sexism]], and the Confucian system of education, while preserving others, such as the family structure and culture of obedience to the state.

Some observers see the period following the establishment of the PRC in 1949 as a continuation of traditional Chinese dynastic history, while others claim that the Communist Party's rule has damaged the foundations of Chinese culture, especially through political movements such as the [[Cultural Revolution]] of the 1960s, where many aspects of traditional culture were destroyed, having been denounced as 'regressive and harmful' or 'vestiges of [[feudalism]]'. Many important aspects of traditional Chinese morals and culture, such as [[Confucianism]], [[Chinese art]], literature, and performing arts like [[Peking opera]], were altered to conform to government policies and propaganda at the time.

Today, the Chinese government has accepted numerous elements of traditional Chinese culture as being integral to Chinese society. With the rise of [[Chinese nationalism]] and the end of the Cultural Revolution, various forms of traditional Chinese art, literature, music, film, fashion and architecture have seen a vigorous revival,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_abcdef&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+cn0133) |title=&quot;China: Traditional arts&quot;.

Chinese cuisine is highly diverse, drawing on several millennia of culinary history.

The Food of Asia. Tuttle Publishing. ISBN 0-7946-0146-4&lt;/ref&gt; employing countless imperial kitchen staff and [[concubines]] to prepare the food. Such royal dishes gradually became a part of wider Chinese culture. China's staple food is rice, but the country is also well known for its meat dishes. [[Five-spice powder|Spices]] are endemic to Chinese cuisine.

Numerous foreign offshoots of Chinese food, such as [[Cuisine of Hong Kong#Eastern Styles|Hong Kong cuisine]] and [[American Chinese food]], have emerged in the various nations which play host to the [[Chinese diaspora]].
