{{History of Mexico}}
The '''Texas Revolution''', also known as the '''Texas War of Independence''', was the military conflict between the government of [[Mexico]] and [[Texas]] colonists that began October 2, 1835 and resulted in the establishment of the [[Republic of Texas]] after the final battle on April 21, 1836. Intermittent conflicts between the two nations continued into the 1840s, finally being resolved with the [[Mexican–American War]] of 1846 to 1848 after the [[Texas annexation|annexation of Texas]] to the United States.

Long-running political and cultural clashes between the Mexican government and the settlers in Texas were exacerbated after conservative forces took control and the [[Siete Leyes]] (Seven Laws) of 1835 were approved. It displaced the federal [[Constitution of 1824]] with the [[1835 Constitution of Mexico]], thereby ending the [[Federation|federal system]] and establishing a provisional [[centralized government]] in its place. The new laws were unpopular throughout Mexico, leading to [[Mexican_states#Centralist_Republic|secession movements and violence in several Mexican states]].

Open warfare began in Texas on October 2, 1835, with the [[Battle of Gonzales]]. Early [[Texan Army]] successes at [[Goliad, TX|La Bahía]] and [[San Antonio]] ([[Battle of Goliad]], [[Siege of Béxar]]) were soon reversed when the Mexican Army retook the territory a few months later ([[Battle of Coleto]], [[Battle of the Alamo]]). The war ended at the [[Battle of San Jacinto]], where the Texian army under General [[Sam Houston]] routed the Mexican forces with a surprise attack.

==Background==
{{Main|Mexican Texas}}

The [[Mexican War for Independence]] (1810–1821) severed control that [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] had exercised on its North American territories, and the new country of [[Mexico]] was formed from much of the individual territory that had comprised [[New Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;Manchaca (2001), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 4, 1824, Mexico adopted [[1824 Constitution of Mexico|a new constitution]] which defined the country as a federal republic with nineteen states and four&amp;nbsp;territories. The former province of [[Spanish Texas]] became part of a newly created state, [[Coahuila y Tejas]],&lt;ref name=manchaca162&gt;Manchaca (2001), p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; whose capital was at [[Saltillo]], hundreds of miles from the former Texas capital, [[San Antonio de Bexar]] (now [[San Antonio]], Texas, USA).&lt;ref name=edmondson72&gt;Edmondson (2000), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

The new country emerged essentially bankrupt from the war against Spain. With little money for the military, Mexico encouraged settlers to create their own militias for protection against hostile Indian tribes. Texas was very sparsely populated &lt;ref group=Note&gt;. In the early 1820s, approximately 3500 people lived in Tejas, mostly congregated at San Antonio and [[Goliad, TX|La Bahia]]. Edmondson (2000), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the hope that an influx of settlers could control the Indian raids, the government liberalized immigration policies for the region.&lt;ref name=manchaca164&gt;Manchaca (2001), p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; The first group of colonists, known as the [[Old Three Hundred]], had arrived in 1822 to settle an [[empresario|empresarial]] grant that had been given to [[Stephen F. Austin]]. Of the 24 empresarios, only one settled citizens from within the Mexican interior; most of the remaining settlers came from the United States.&lt;ref name=manchaca198and199&gt;Manchaca (2001), pp. 198&amp;ndash;9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mexican-born settlers in Texas were soon vastly outnumbered by people born in the United States. To address this situation, President [[Anastasio Bustamante]] implemented several measures on April 6, 1830. Chief among these was a prohibition against further immigration to Tejas from the United States, although American citizens would be allowed to settle in other parts of Mexico. Furthermore, the property tax law, intended to exempt immigrants from paying taxes for ten years, was rescinded, and tariffs were increased on goods shipped from the United States. Bustamante also ordered all Tejas settlers to comply with the federal prohibition against slavery or face military intervention.&lt;ref name=manchaca200&gt;Manchaca (2001), p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt; These measures did not have the intended effect. Settlers simply circumvented or ignored the laws. By 1834, it was estimated that over 30,000 [[Anglo#United_States|Anglos]] lived in Coahuila y Tejas,&lt;ref name=manchaca201&gt;Manchaca (2001), p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; compared to only 7,800&amp;nbsp;Mexican-born citizens.&lt;ref name=manchaca172&gt;Manchaca (2001), p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1836, there were approximately 5,000 slaves in Texas.&lt;ref name=barr17&gt;Barr (1996), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible Role of Slavery===
One possible issue and motivation for the revolution was Mexico's prohibition of slavery. &lt;ref&gt;http://latinamericanhistory.about.com/od/TexasIndependence/p/Causes-Of-Texas-Independence.htm,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/disp_textbook.cfm?smtid=3&amp;psid=3656&lt;/ref&gt;  The Mexican government had invited immigrants to Mexican Texas with the understanding that they would produce food crops, insisting upon production of corn, grain and beef.&lt;ref name=davis65&gt;Davis (2004), p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Former American settlers found such [[micromanagement]] of the land use to be opposed to their economic interests in slavery. They tended to ignore their contracts. If these were enforced, Texas slave-owners stood to lose a large investment in slave labor. [[Cotton]] was in high demand throughout Europe and so a lucrative export throughout the [[southern United States]].  Much of the land being opened up to Anglos in Mexican Texas was well suited for cotton, but raising cotton was a labor intensive endeavor at the time, and many Texans thought that slave-labor was more profitable. Most of the American settlers in Mexico were from southern states, where slavery was still legal. They even brought their slaves with them. Because slavery was illegal in Mexico, these settlers made their slaves sign agreements giving them the status of indentured servants – essentially slavery by another name. The Mexican authorities nominally regulated this practice, and the issue continued to flare up, especially when slaves ran escaped. By the 1830s, many settlers were afraid that the Mexicans would take the slaves away, which made them favor independence.  Some non-slave-owning settlers recognized the economic impact of the prohibition, and as potential beneficiaries of the slave-based economy, supported independence as well.

The significance of slavery in the Texas War for Independence is unclear and difficult to determine.  It is important to address the fact that the Texas Declaration of Independence of 1836 does not mention slavery, unlike Texas' 1861 Ordinance of Secession.  Furthermore, the vast majority of primary-sources from the period do not mention slavery as a cause, but rather focus on issues such as religious freedom, the abrogation of the Mexican Constitution, and land rights. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tamu.edu/faculty/ccbn/dewitt/mckshorts.htm#slavery&lt;/ref&gt;    &lt;ref&gt;http://www.northamptonmud.com/nh_story/chapter1table.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Issues==

Texans were becoming increasingly disillusioned with the Mexican government. Many of the Mexican soldiers [[garrison]]ed in Texas were convicted criminals who were given the choice of prison or serving in the army in Texas. Many Texians were also unhappy with the location of their state capital, which moved periodically between [[Saltillo]] and [[Monclova]], both of which were in southern [[Coahuila]], some {{convert|500|mi|km}} away; they wanted Texas to be a separate state from Coahuila (but not independent from Mexico) and to have its own capital.&lt;ref name=santos3&gt;Santos (1968), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

The other interest of the Texans was representation of their interests in the government. They believed a closer location for the capital would help to stem [[political corruption|corruption]] and facilitate other matters of government.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} [[List of people from Texas|Texans]] continued to lobby to overturn the laws of 1830. In April 1833, settlers [[Convention of 1833|called a convention]] to discuss proposed changes in immigration, judicial, and other political policies. The delegates also advocated separate statehood for Texas and elected Austin to carry a proposed state constitution to Mexico City. The new Mexican President, [[Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna]], approved many of the proposals, but refused to agree to separate statehood; Austin was jailed when he wrote a letter advocating that Texans act unilaterally on statehood.&lt;ref name=lack7&gt;Lack (1992), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1834, because of perceived troubles within the Mexican government, Santa Anna went through a process of dissolving state legislatures, disarming state militias, and abolishing the Constitution of 1824. He also imprisoned some cotton plantation owners who refused to raise their assigned crops, which were intended to be redistributed within Mexico instead of being exported.

==Mexican preparation==
In early 1835, as the Mexican government transitioned from a [[federalism|federalist]] model to [[centralized government|centralism]], wary Texans began forming Committees of Correspondence and Safety. A central committee in [[San Felipe, Texas|San Felipe de Austin]] coordinated their activities.&lt;ref name=huson4&gt;Huson (1974), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The Texians staged a minor revolt against customs duties in June; these [[Anahuac Disturbances]] prompted Mexican President [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]] to send additional troops to Texas.&lt;ref name=roell36&gt;Roell (1994), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; In July, Colonel Nicolas Condelle led 200&amp;nbsp;men to reinforce [[Presidio La Bahía]].

The following month, a contingent of soldiers arrived in Béxar with Colonel [[Domingo de Ugartechea]].&lt;ref name=huson5&gt;Huson (1974), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing that stronger measures were needed to quell the unrest, Santa Anna ordered his brother-in-law, General [[Martín Perfecto de Cos]] to &quot;repress with strong arm all those who, forgetting their duties to the nation which has adopted them as her children, are pushing forward with a desire to live at their own option without subjection to the laws&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;roell36&quot; /&gt; Cos landed at the port of [[Copano, Texas|Copano]] on September 20 with approximately 500&amp;nbsp;soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;huson5&quot; /&gt;

Austin was released in July, having never been formally charged with sedition, and was in Texas by August. Austin saw little choice but revolution. A consultation was scheduled for October to discuss possible formal plans to revolt, and Austin sanctioned it.&lt;ref name=edmondson207&gt;Edmondson (2000), p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texan Army offensive==
Before the consultation could happen, however, in accordance with Santa Anna’s nationwide call to disarm state militias, Colonel [[Domingo Ugartechea]], who was stationed in San Antonio, ordered the Texans to return a cannon given to them by Mexico that was stationed in Gonzales. The Texans refused. Ugartechea sent Lieutenant [[Francisco de Castañeda]] and 100 [[dragoon]]s to retrieve it.&lt;ref name=davis138&gt;Davis (2006), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; When he arrived at the rain-swollen banks of the [[Guadalupe River (Texas)|Guadalupe River]] near Gonzales, there were just eighteen Texans to oppose him. Unable to cross, Castañeda established a camp, and the Texians buried the cannon and called for volunteers.&lt;ref name=davis139&gt;Davis (2006), p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Texans stalled for several days until reinforcements arrived. The [[Texan Army]] attacked early on October 2, 1835. The [[Battle of Gonzales]] ended with a Mexican withdrawal. Two Mexican soldiers were killed, and one Texian was injured when he fell off his horse during the skirmish.&lt;ref name=davis142&gt;Davis (2006), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next several days, The Texian Army continued to gather at Gonzales.

After learning of the [[Texan Army]] victory, Cos made haste for Béxar. He left with the bulk of his soldiers on October 5, but because he was unable to find adequate transportation, most of his supplies remained at La Bahía.&lt;ref name=goliadhandbook&gt;{{citation|last=Roell|first=Craig H.|title=Goliad Campaign of 1835|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/GG/qdg1.html|accessdate=2008-07-14|publisher=[[Handbook of Texas]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unaware of Cos's departure, on October 6 Texans in Matagorda decided to march on the Mexican garrison at [[Presidio La Bahía]] in Goliad. They intended to kidnap Cos and, if possible, steal the estimated $50,000 that was rumored to accompany him.&lt;ref name=hardin14&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 10, the Texians stormed the presidio, and the Mexican garrison surrendered after a 30-minute battle.&lt;ref name=hardin16&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hardin17&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; One Texian was wounded,&lt;ref name=scott21&gt;Scott (2000), p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; and estimates of Mexican casualties range from one to three soldiers killed and from three to seven wounded.&lt;ref name=goliadhandbook/&gt;&lt;ref name=scott20&gt;Scott (2000), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 20&amp;nbsp;soldiers escaped. They warned the garrisons at Copano and [[Refugio, Texas|Refugio]] of the advancing Texians; those garrisons abandoned their posts and joined the soldiers at [[Fort Lipantitlán]], near [[San Patricio, TX|San Patricio]].&lt;ref name=goliadhandbook/&gt;

[[Image:Texas Flag Come and Take It.svg|thumb|right|200px|The ''[[Come and take it]]'' flag, used during the revolution]]

The Texans confiscated over $10,000 in food, blankets, clothing, and other provisions.&lt;ref name=scott20/&gt; For the next three months, the provisions were parceled out among companies in the Texian Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;goliadhandbook&quot;/&gt; Over the next several days, The Texian Army continued to gather at La Bahia.&lt;ref name=huson17&gt;Huson (1974), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Austin ordered that 100&amp;nbsp;men remain at Goliad, under the command of Captain [[Philip Dimmitt]], while the rest should join the Texian Army in marching on Cos's troops in Béxar.&lt;ref name=goliadhandbook/&gt; Within days of his appointment, Dimmitt began advocating for an attack on Fort Lipantitlán.&lt;ref name=hardin41/&gt; Dimmitt believed that Texian control of Fort Lipantitlán would &quot;secure the frontier, provide a vital station for defense, create instability among the centralists, and encourage Mexican federalists&quot;.&lt;ref name=hardin41&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican soldiers at Fort Lipantitlán intimidated the settlers in San Patricio, leaving them afraid to openly support the federalists who defied Mexican president [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]].&lt;ref name=roell42&gt;Roell (1994), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, Dimmitt sent a group of men under Adjutant Ira Westover to take the fort.&lt;ref name=hardin42&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; They arrived at Fort Lipantitlán late on November 3 and took the undermanned fort without firing a shot.&lt;ref name=hardin44&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, the Texians dismantled the fort.&lt;ref name=groneman36&gt;Groneman (1998), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; As they prepared to return to Goliad, the remainder of the Mexican garrison, who had been out on patrol, approached.&lt;ref name=huson102&gt;Huson (1974), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Battle of Lipantitlán]] lasted only 30 minutes, and resulted in the retreat of the Mexican soldiers.&lt;ref name=hardin46&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Their departure left only one remaining group of Mexican soldiers in Texas, those under Cos at Béxar.&lt;ref name=groneman37&gt;Groneman (1998), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hardin53&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; The Texian Army controlled the Gulf Coast, so all communication with the Mexican interior would now be transferred overland. The long journey left Cos unable to quickly request or receive reinforcements or supplies.&lt;ref name=groneman37/&gt;

===Siege of Bexar===
While Dimmitt supervised the Texan Army forces along the Gulf Coast, [[Stephen F. Austin]] worked to organize the men gathered in Gonzales into a cohesive army. On October 13, Austin led the newly formed [[Texan Army]] toward Bexar to engage Cos and his troops.&lt;ref name=barr6&gt;Barr (1990), p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; One week later, the men reached [[Salado Creek]] and initiated a [[siege of Bexar]].&lt;ref name=barr15&gt;Barr (1990), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The Texians gradually moved their camp nearer Bexar, and on October 27 had made camp at [[Mission San Francisco de la Espada]].&lt;ref name=barr19&gt;Barr (1990), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; That afternoon Austin sent [[James Bowie]] and [[James Fannin]] with a contingent of men to find a closer campsite. The men realized that [[Mission Concepción]] was a good defensive spot. Rather than return immediately to Austin, as their orders specified, Bowie and Fannin instead sent a courier to bring Austin directions to Concepción. The next day, an angry Austin issued a statement threatening officers who chose not to follow orders with [[court-martial]].&lt;ref name=barr22&gt;Barr (1990), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cos had learned that the Texan Army was temporarily divided and sent Ugartechea and troops to engage Bowie and Fannin's men.&lt;ref name=barr23&gt;Barr (1990), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; The ensuing [[Battle of Concepción]], which historian J.R. Edmondson describes as &quot;the first major engagement of the Texas Revolution&quot;,&lt;ref name=edmondson224&gt;Edmondson (2000), p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt; was the last offensive against the Texian Army that Cos would order.&lt;ref name=barr27&gt;Barr (1990), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Although historian [[Alwyn Barr]] of [[Texas Tech University]] believes that the battle &quot;should have taught&amp;nbsp;... lessons on Mexican courage and the value of a good defensive position&quot;,&lt;ref name=barr60&gt;Barr (1990), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; historian Stephen Hardin believes that &quot;the relative ease of the victory at Concepción instilled in the Texians a reliance on their long rifles and a contempt for their enemies&quot;.&lt;ref name=hardin35&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Texan Army volunteers had little or no experience as professional soldiers, and by early November many had begun to miss their homes. As the weather turned colder and rations grew smaller, many soldiers became sick, and groups of men began to leave, most without permission.&lt;ref name=barr29&gt;Barr (1990), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 18, however, a group of volunteers from the United States, known as the [[New Orleans Greys]], joined the Texan Army.&lt;ref name=barr35&gt;Barr (1990),p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hardin60&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the majority of the Texian volunteers, the Greys looked like soldiers, with uniforms, well-maintained rifles, adequate ammunition, and some semblance of discipline.&lt;ref name=hardin60/&gt; The Greys, as well as several companies of Texians who had arrived recently, were eager to face the Mexican Army directly.&lt;ref name=barr38&gt;Barr (1990), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; The Texan volunteers, however, were becoming discouraged with the siege.&lt;ref name=hardin61&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Within days Austin resigned his command to become a commissioner to the United States; Texan Army elected [[Edward Burleson]] as their new commander.&lt;ref name=hardin62&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 26, Burleson received word that a Mexican [[packhorse|pack train]] of mules and horses, accompanied by 50&amp;ndash;100&amp;nbsp;Mexican soldiers, was within {{convert|5|mi|km}} of Bexar.&lt;ref name=barr39&gt;Barr (1990), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hardin64&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; After a near mutiny, Burleson sent Bowie and William H. Jack with cavalry and infantry to intercept the supplies.&lt;ref name=hardin64/&gt;&lt;ref name=edmondson237&gt;Edmondson (2000), p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; In the subsequent skirmish, the Mexican forces were forced to retreat to San Antonio, leaving their cargo behind. To the disappointment of the Texans, the saddlebags contained only fodder for the horses; for this reason the battle was later known as the [[Grass Fight]].&lt;ref name=edmondson238&gt;Edmondson (2000), p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the victory briefly uplifted the Texian troops, morale continued to fall as the weather turned colder and the men grew bored. Burleson proposed that the army lift the siege and retreat to Goliad until spring. His war council was ambivalent until Colonel [[Ben Milam]] stood up and yelled, &quot;Who will go with old Ben Milam into San Antonio?&quot; Several hundred soldiers, including the New Orleans Greys, agreed to participate in the attack, which commenced on December 5. Milam and Colonel [[Frank W. Johnson]] led two columns of men into the city, and for the next few days they fought their way from house to house towards the fortified plazas where the Mexican soldiers waited. Milam was killed by a sharpshooter on December 7.&lt;ref name=edmondson243&gt;Edmondson (2000), p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 9, Cos and the bulk of his men withdrew into the [[Alamo Mission]] on the outskirts of Bexar. Cos presented a plan for a counterattack; cavalry officers believed that they would be surrounded by Texians and refused their orders.&lt;ref name=barr55&gt;Barr (1990), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly 175&amp;ndash;soldiers from four of the cavalry companies left the mission and rode south.&lt;ref name=todish26&gt;Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; Sanchez Navarro said the troops were not deserting but misunderstood their orders and were withdrawing all the way to the [[Rio Grande]].&lt;ref name=todish26/&gt; The following morning, Cos called Sanchez Navarro to the Alamo and gave him orders to &quot;go save those brave men. ... Approach the enemy and obtain the best terms possible&quot;.&lt;ref name=barr56&gt;Barr (1990), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, the Texans officially accepted Cos's surrender.&lt;ref name=barr57&gt;Barr (1990), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the terms of the surrender, Cos and his men would leave Texas and no longer fight against the Constitution of 1824.&lt;ref name=barr58&gt;Barr (1990), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; With his departure, there was no longer an organized garrison of Mexican troops in Texas,&lt;ref name=barr64&gt;Barr (1990), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; and many of the Texans believed that the war was over. Johnson described the battle as &quot;the period put to our present war&quot;.&lt;ref name=hardin91&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; Burleson resigned his leadership of the army on December 15 and returned to his home. Many of the men did likewise, and Johnson assumed command of the 400 soldiers who remained. Soon after, a new contingent of Texans and volunteers from the United States arrived with more heavy artillery.&lt;ref name=barr58/&gt;&lt;ref name=todish29/&gt; According to Barr, the large number of American volunteers &quot;contributed to the Mexican view that Texan opposition stemmed from outside influences&quot;.&lt;ref name=barr63&gt;Barr (1990), p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within several weeks of the Mexican surrender, Johnson and Dr. [[James Grant (Texas)|James Grant]] enticed 300 of the Texans to join them in preparing to invade Mexico, leaving Colonel [[James C. Neill]] to oversee the remaining 100&amp;nbsp;Texan Army soldiers garrisoned at the Alamo.&lt;ref name=todish29&gt;Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Matamoros Expedition]], as it came to be known, was but one of many schemes to bring the war to Mexico, nothing came of it. On November 6, 1835, the [[Tampico Expedition]] under [[José Antonio Mexía]] left [[New Orleans]], intending to capture the town from the Centralists. The expedition failed. These independent missions drained the Texan movement of supplies and men.&lt;ref name=winders89&gt;Winders (2004), p. 60&amp;89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provisional government===
In November 1835 at San Felipe de Austin, the [[Consultation (Texas)]] scheduled for the month before finally got underway after enough delegates from the colonies arrived to signify a quorum. After bitter debate, they finally created a provisional government that was not to be separate from Mexico but only to oppose the Centralists.&lt;ref name=todish24&gt;Todish ''et al'', p. 24.&lt;/ref&gt; They elected [[Henry Smith (Texas Governor)|Henry Smith]] as governor,&lt;ref name=winders72&gt;Winders (2004), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[Sam Houston]] was appointed commander-in-chief of the regular Army of Texas. There was no regular army yet; Austin’s army was all volunteers, so Houston would have to build one.&lt;ref name=winders70to72&gt;Winders (2004), pp. 70&amp;ndash;2.&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the regular army would be paid in land.&lt;ref name=todish24/&gt;  The provisional government commissioned privateers and established a postal system. A merchant was sent to the U.S. to borrow $100,000. They ordered hundreds of copies of various military textbooks.{{citation}} They gave Austin the option to step down as commander of the Texan Army in Béxar and go to the U.S. as a commissioner. On November 24, 1835, Austin stepped down as general. Elections were held, and Colonel [[Edward Burleson]] became Austin’s successor.&lt;ref name=&quot;hardin62&quot; /&gt;

==Santa Anna's offensive==

===Army of Operations===
[[Image:Santaanna1.JPG|thumb|right|[[Antonio López de Santa Anna]]]]
As early as October 27, Santa Anna had been making plans to quell the unrest in Texas. He stepped down from his duties as president to lead what he dubbed the Army of Operations in Texas, which would relieve Cos and put an end to the Texan revolt. Santa Anna and his soldiers believed that the Texians would be quickly cowed. The Mexican Secretary of War, [[José María Tornel]], wrote: &quot;The superiority of the Mexican soldier over the mountaineers of Kentucky and the hunters of Missouri is well known. Veterans seasoned by 20&amp;nbsp;years of wars can't be intimidated by the presence of an army ignorant of the art of war, incapable of discipline, and renowned for insubordination.&quot;&lt;ref name=hardin98&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The units comprising the Army of Operations were generally operating at under full strength, and many of the men were raw recruits.&lt;ref name=hardin99&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; A majority of the troops had been [[conscript]]ed or were convicts who agreed to serve in the military instead of jail.&lt;ref name=todish20&gt;Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican officers knew that the [[Brown Bess]] muskets they carried lacked the range of the Texan weapons, but Santa Anna was convinced that his superior planning would nonetheless result in an easy victory.&lt;ref name=scott73&gt;Scott (2000), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his preparations, Santa Anna orchestrated a warning to the American citizens who were flocking to Texas. At his behest, the Mexican Congress passed a resolution stating:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;div&gt;Foreigners landing on the coast of the Republic or invading its territory by land, armed, and with the intent of attacking our country, will be deemed pirates and dealt with as such, being citizens of no nation presently at war with the Republic and fighting under no recognized flag.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;All foreigners who shall import, by either sea or land, in the places occupied by the rebels, either arms or ammunition or any kind for their use, will be deemed pirates and punished as such.&lt;ref name=scott71&gt;Scott (2000), p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In this time period, captured pirates were executed immediately. The resolution thus gave the Mexican Army permission to take no prisoners in the war against the Texians.&lt;ref name=scott71/&gt; Santa Anna also sent a strongly worded letter to [[Andrew Jackson]], the United States president, warning that any Americans found fighting the Mexican government would be treated as pirates.&lt;ref name=scott74&gt;Scott (2000), p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was not widely distributed, and it is unlikely that most of the American recruits serving in the Texian Army were aware that there would be no prisoners of war.&lt;ref name=scott75&gt;Scott (2000), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

By December 1835 6,019&amp;nbsp;soldiers had gathered at [[San Luis Potosi]] to march into Texas.&lt;ref name=hardin102/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Filisola, Vicente. Memoirs for the History of the War in Texas. Digital ed. Vol. 2. N.p.: Rice University, n.d. 2010. p. 337. .&lt;/ref&gt; Several of Santa Anna's officers argued that the Army of Operations should advance along the coast, so that they would be able to receive additional supplies via sea. Instead, Santa Anna ordered the army inland to Bexar, the political center of Texas and the site of Cos's defeat; Santa Anna wanted to restore the reputation of his family after his brother-in-law's embarrassing surrender.&lt;ref name=hardin102/&gt; The long march would also provide an opportunity to train the new recruits.&lt;ref name=hardin103&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; In late December, the army began the march north.&lt;ref name=hardin102&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

Progress was slow. There were not enough mules to transport all of the supplies, and many of the [[teamster]]s, all civilians, quit when their pay was delayed. The large number of ''[[soldaderas]]''&amp;ndash;women and children who followed the army&amp;ndash;reduced the already scarce supplies. The soldiers were soon reduced to partial rations.&lt;ref name=hardin103/&gt; After reaching Saltillo, the army halted for two weeks so that Santa Anna could recover from an illness. Officers took advantage of the break to train the men. Many of the new recruits did not know how to use the sights of their guns, and many refused to fire from the shoulder because of the large recoil.&lt;ref name=lord67&gt;Lord (1961), p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The march into Texas resumed on January 26,&lt;ref name=lord68&gt;Lord (1961), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; and the army crossed the [[Rio Grande]] on February 12.&lt;ref name=lord73&gt;Lord (1961), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

Temperatures in Texas reached record lows, and by February 13 an estimated {{convert|15|-|16|in|cm}} of snow had fallen. A large number of the new recruits were from the tropical climate of the [[Yucatán]], and some of them died of hypothermia. Others contracted dysentery. Soldiers who fell behind were sometimes killed by [[Comanche]] raiding parties.&lt;ref name=hardin105&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the army continued to march toward Bexar. As they progressed, settlers in their path in [[South Texas]] evacuated northward. The Mexican army ransacked and occasionally burned the vacant homes.&lt;ref name=scott77&gt;Scott (2000), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alamo===
{{Main|Battle of the Alamo}}
[[File:Texas historical commission african americans in the texas revolution TxHM.jpg|thumb|[[Texas Historical Commission]] marker in Austin, commemorating the role of African-Americans in the Texas Revolution, including [[Joe Travis]], who survived the [[Battle of the Alamo]] and carried news of it to [[General Sam Houston]].]]
The Mexican Army arrived in San Antonio on February 23, 1836. The Texian garrison was completely unprepared for the arrival of the Mexican army and had to quickly gather food from the town to supply the Alamo.&lt;ref name=edmondson299and301&gt;Edmondson (2000), pp. 299, 301.&lt;/ref&gt; By late afternoon Bexar was occupied by about 1500 Mexican troops, who quickly raised a blood-red flag signifying [[no quarter]].&lt;ref name=nofi78&gt;Nofi (1992), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=todish40&gt;Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; For the next thirteen days, the Mexican army [[Siege of the Alamo|besieged the Alamo]]. Although there were several small skirmishes that provided the defenders with much needed optimism, they had little real impact.&lt;ref name=todish42and43&gt;Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 42&amp;ndash;3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=edmondson325&gt;Edmondson (2000), p. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early hours of March 6, the Mexican army attacked the fort in what became known as the [[Battle of the Alamo]].&lt;ref name=hardin138&gt;Hardin (1994), p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all of the [[List of Alamo defenders|Texian defenders]], estimated at 182&amp;ndash;257 men, were killed, including [[James Bowie]], [[Davy Crockett]] and [[William B. Travis]].&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Brigido Guerrero convinced the Mexican army he had been imprisoned by the Texians. Joe, the slave of Alamo commander [[William B. Travis]], was spared because he was a slave. Some historians also believe that Henry Warnell escaped during the battle, although he may have been a courier who left before the battle began. He died several months after the battle of wounds incurred during his escape. See Edmondson (2000), pp. 372, 407.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nofi133&gt;Nofi (1992), p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Most Alamo historians agree that 400&amp;ndash;600&amp;nbsp;Mexicans were killed or wounded.&lt;ref name=todish55/&gt;&lt;ref name=hardin155&gt;Hardin (1961), p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nofi136&gt;Nofi (1992), p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; This would represent about one-third of the Mexican soldiers involved in the final assault, which Todish remarks is &quot;a tremendous casualty rate by any standards&quot;.&lt;ref name=todish55&gt;Todish ''et al.'' (1998), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Bexar, Santa Anna divided his army and sent three [[flying column]]s across Texas.  General [[Jose de Urrea]] was to advance eastward on the Texans from the south, Santa Anna and General [[Joaquin Ramirez y Sesma]] pushing from the center, and General [[Antonio Gaona]] supplied to march north of the Texans to Nacogdoches and then turn to block further retreat toward Louisiana.&lt;ref name=&quot;Santa Anna 2006. p. 15&quot;&gt;Santa Anna, Antonio Lopez De. &quot;Manifesto.&quot; ''The Mexican Side Of The Texas Revolution''. Trans. Carlos E. Castaneda. Toronto: Scholar's Bookshelf, 2006. p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; The objective was to force a decisive battle over the [[Texian Army]], now led by General [[Sam Houston]].

===Goliad campaign===
{{Main|Goliad Campaign}}
[[Image:Presidio La Bahía.jpg|thumb|left|200px|thumb|&lt;font size=2&gt;[[Presidio La Bahía]] in Goliad, Texas&lt;/font size=2&gt;]]
General [[José Urrea]] marched into Texas from [[Matamoros, Tamaulipas|Matamoros]], making his way north following the coast of Texas, thus preventing any foreign aid by sea and opening up an opportunity for the [[Mexican Navy]] to land much needed provisions. After surprising Colonel Frank Johnson and his troops at the [[Battle of San Patricio]], Urrea's forces defeated a small Texan force at the [[Battle of Agua Dulce]] on March 2, 1836. Urrea then led his troops toward Goliad, where Colonel [[James Fannin]] commanded 450 of the only Texian Army troops outside the Alamo.&lt;ref name=Edmonson333&gt;Edmonson (2000), p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 10, Fannin had divided his force, by sending out 148 Texians with William C. Francis, Amon B. King and [[William Ward (Texas)|William Ward]] to the [[Refugio, Texas|Refugio]] area. In Refugio, the Texians would fall into Urrea's path. The Texians repulsed several attacks and inflicted heavy casualties at the [[Battle of Refugio]]. Fannin sent couriers with word to rendezvous with him in [[Victoria, Texas|Victoria]] and thus they broke off the attack. However, some couriers had been captured, which ultimately provided Urrea with precious details of Fannin's plans.&lt;ref name=Edmonson379&gt;Edmonson (2000), p. 379.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fannin was ordered by General Sam Houston on March 11, 1836, to abandon Goliad and retreat to Victoria, but delayed his retreat until March 19. His force of about 300 men were caught on the open prairie at a slight depression near Coleto Creek and repulsed three charges at a heavy cost in Mexican casualties, during this [[Battle of Coleto]]. Overnight, Urrea's forces surrounded the Texans, brought up cannon and reinforcements, and induced Fannin's surrender under terms the next day, March 20. About 342 of the Texian troops captured during the Goliad Campaign were executed a week later on [[Palm Sunday]], March 27, 1836, under Santa Anna's direct orders, widely known as the [[Goliad Massacre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edmonson379&quot; /&gt;

According to Harbert Davenport, &quot;The impact of the Goliad Massacre was crucial. Until this episode Santa Anna's reputation had been that of a cunning and crafty man, rather than a cruel one...together with the fall of the Alamo, branded both Santa Anna and the Mexican people with a reputation for cruelty and aroused the fury of the people of Texas, the United States, and even Great Britain and France, thus considerably promoting the success of the Texas Revolution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Harbert Davenport,[http://www.tshaonline.org/publications/journals/shq/online/v043/n1/contrib_DIVL373.html &quot;Men of Goliad&quot;], Volume 43, Number 1, Southwestern Historical Quarterly Online (Accessed Tue October 31, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meeting of two armies==
[[File:Mexico 1835-1846 administrative map-en-2.svg|350px|thumb|left|A map of Mexico, 1835-1846, showing administrative divisions. The red areas show regions where separatist movements were active.]]

===Texan retreat: &quot;The Runaway Scrape&quot;===
{{Main|Runaway Scrape}}
The term “Runaway Scrape” is used to refer to two aspects of the Revolution upon word spreading of the fall of the Alamo.  Both and either may be intended depending upon context.  In the first context the term refers to the military retreat of the Texan forces under Houston.  In the second, the reference is to the civilian flight toward Louisiana.

Houston immediately understood that his small army was not prepared to fight Santa Anna out in the open. The Mexican cavalry, experienced and feared, was something the Texians could not easily defeat. Seeing that his only choice was to keep the army together enough to be able to fight on favorable grounds, Houston ordered a retreat towards the U.S. border, and many [[Runaway Scrape|settlers also fled]] in the same direction. There is speculation that one of the possible scenarios Houston envisioned was to actually lead his Texan army into Louisiana (U.S. territory), whereupon an invading Mexican army could be attacked not only by the retreating Texan army but also by American forces summoned from garrisons in New Orleans. That Sam Houston was an old friend of then U.S. president [[Andrew Jackson]], and possibly had some communication during this crucial period, and Stephen F. Austin was in New Orleans during this time, lend a measure of credence to such speculation. On its way toward Louisiana, the Texan army implemented a [[scorched earth]] policy, denying much-needed food for the Mexican army. Soon, the rains made the roads impassable, and the cold season made the list of casualties grow in both armies.&lt;ref name=fehrenbach242&gt;Fehrenbach (2000), p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Anna's army, always on the heels of Houston, gave unrelenting chase. The town of Gonzales could not be defended by the Revolutionaries, so it was put to the torch. The same fate awaited Austin's colony of San Felipe. Despair grew among the ranks of Houston's men, and much animosity was aimed towards him. All that impeded Santa Anna's advance were the swollen rivers, which gave Houston a chance to rest and drill his army.&lt;ref name=castaneda26&gt;Castaneda (1970), p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preceding the Texas Army's eastward movement away from the Mexican Army, was the civilian exodus toward the safety of Louisiana. At [[Bastrop, Texas|Mina]], for example, the Texas Ranger unit was divided so that half would protect the civilian evacuation and the remainder would serve as the rear guard and scouts (&quot;spies&quot; they were called) during the military retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Smithwick, Noah. ''The Evolution of a State or Recollections of Old Texas Days''. Austin: University of Texas, 1983 p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Stephen L. ''Eighteen Minutes the Battle of San Jacinto and the Texas Independence Campaign''. Dallas: Republic of Texas, Distributed by National Book Network, 2004. p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the period of the Runaway Scrape, Gaona's army was re-directed from its original orders (to proceed to Nacogdoches via the San Antonio Road in a flanking maneuver) to, instead, turn southeast and join the main forces of Cos and Sesma at San Felipe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Santa Anna 2006. p. 15&quot;/&gt;  Santa Anna was not aware that Houston and his army were, from March 30 through April 12, camped in the woods along the Brazos only fifteen miles above the main Mexican forces who were camped at San Felipe from April 7 through April 9.&lt;ref&gt;Santa Anna, Antonio Lopez De. &quot;Manifesto.&quot; ''The Mexican Side Of The Texas Revolution''. Trans. Carlos E. Castaneda. Toronto: Scholar's Bookshelf, 2006. p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;  Gaona’s Division did not arrive at San Felipe until April 17, having marched past the already deserted Texian camp.

The Texans remained undiscovered for nearly two weeks, allowing the number of volunteers to increase and training them in military discipline.  Early on, Houston commandeered the Steamboat [[Yellowstone (steamboat)|Yellowstone]] so as to facilitate their safe and orderly crossing of the Brazos River when the troops were prepared or should they be discovered. The Mexican Army had no knowledge as to where the main body of Texans was during early April while the Texans knew the location of the three Mexican forces.&lt;ref&gt;See dispatch from Sam Houston to Major Robert McAlpin Williamson, April 7th, 1836; in: Jenkins, John Holmes. ''The Papers of the Texas Revolution, 1835-1836''. Vol. 5. Austin: Presidial, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until Santa Anna arrived in Harrisburg and interrogated civilians there, that he learned Houston had been camped so near his own forces on the Brazos.&lt;ref&gt;Santa Anna, Antonio Lopez De. &quot;Manifesto.&quot; ''The Mexican Side Of The Texas Revolution''. Trans. Carlos E. Castaneda. Toronto: Scholar's Bookshelf, 2006. p. 20-22.&lt;/ref&gt;
After crossing the Brazos, the Texian Army marched due east as Houston received reports from his scouts to the rear.  This adds perspective to the speculation that Houston intended to flee into US territory. It was an option, but not Houston's preferred option—he was looking for, and found, a weakness in Santa Anna's tactics.&lt;ref&gt;James, Marquis. ''The Raven. A Biography of Sam Houston. Illustrated''. Indianapolis: Bobbs-Merreill, 1929. p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;  That weakness came in the form of Santa Anna’s rapid pursuit intending to capture the provisional Texan government.  Leaving the main body of the Mexican Army behind at the San Bernard River, Santa Anna assembled a smaller unit of his best troops and hurried off toward New Washington on Trinity Bay just below San Jacinto.  It was at this time in which Houston turned toward Harrisburg to the southeast at the famed &quot;fork in the road.&quot;

It was at that fork in the road at which the Runaway Scrape had ended in military terms, while the civilians continued to flee. From that moment, Houston was no longer in retreat, but rather leading the Army to find a place to confront Santa Anna on Texas soil.

===Santa Anna defeated===
{{Main|Battle of San Jacinto}}
Events moved at a quick pace after Santa Anna decided to divide his own flying column and race quickly towards [[Galveston]], where members of the Provisional Government had fled. Santa Anna hoped to capture the Revolutionary leaders, and put an end to the war, which had proven costly and prolonged. Santa Anna, as dictator of Mexico, felt the need to return to Mexico City as soon as possible. Houston was informed of Santa Anna's unexpected move. Numbering about 700, Santa Anna's column marched east from [[Harrisburg, Texas]]. 

[[Image:SantaAnnaSurrender.jpg|thumb|right|350px|The painting &quot;Surrender of Santa Anna&quot; by William Huddle shows the Mexican president and general surrendering to a wounded Sam Houston]]
On April 20, both armies met at the [[San Jacinto River (Texas)|San Jacinto River]]. Separating them was a large sloping ground with tall grass, which the Texans used as cover. Santa Anna, elated at finally having the Texas Army in front of him, waited for reinforcements, which were led by General Cos. On that same day, a skirmish was fought between the enemies, mostly cavalry, but nothing came of it.

To the dismay of the Texans, Cos arrived sooner than expected with 540 more troops, swelling Santa Anna's army to over 1,200 men. About 3:30 in the afternoon on April 21, after burning [[Vince's Bridge]], the Texans surged forward, catching the Mexican army by surprise. Hours before the attack, Santa Anna had ordered his men to stand down, noting that the Texans would not attack his superior force. Also, his army had been stretched to the limit of endurance by the ongoing forced marches. His force was overwhelmed by Texans pushing into the Mexican camp. An 18-minute-long battle ensued, but soon the defenses crumbled and a massacre ensued.&lt;ref name=davis271&gt;Davis (2006), p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Anna's entire force of men were killed or captured by Sam Houston's heavily outnumbered army of Texans; only nine Texans died.&lt;ref name=&quot;davis271&quot; /&gt; This decisive battle resulted in Texas's independence from Mexico.

Santa Anna was found in a swamp wearing the uniform of a common soldier and captured. He was brought before Houston, who had been shot in the ankle and badly wounded. Santa Anna agreed to end the campaign.&lt;ref name=davis272&gt;Davis (2006), p. 272.&lt;/ref&gt; General [[Vicente Filisola]], noting the state of his tired and hungry army, marched a force of 4,273 back to Mexico,&lt;ref name=santos3&gt;Santos (1968), p. 9, (prologue).&lt;/ref&gt; but not without protests from Urrea. Santa Anna was forced to sign two treaties, a public treaty and a private stating the exchange of prisoners and to never fight the Texans again. Only Santa Anna had been defeated, not the Army of Operations, and Urrea felt that the campaign should continue, but Filisola disagreed.&lt;ref name=Brands464&gt;Brands (2005), p. 464.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
With [[Antonio López de Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] a prisoner, his captors forced him to sign the [[Treaties of Velasco]] on May 14. The treaty recognized Texas' independence and guaranteed Santa Anna's life. The initial plan was to send him back to Mexico to help smooth relations between the two states. His departure was delayed by a mob who wanted him dead. Santa Anna, declaring himself as the only person who could bring about peace, was sent to [[Washington, D.C.]], by the Texas government to meet President Jackson in order to guarantee independence of the new republic. But unknown to Santa Anna, the Mexican government deposed him ''in absentia''; thus, he no longer had any authority to represent Mexico. The [[Treaty of Velasco]] was never ratified in Mexico, and from the end of the revolution to roughly the beginning of the [[Mexican-American War]], the Texas navy was tasked with forcing the Mexican Government to accept Texas independence. Although fighting between the Mexican and Texian armies ceased for the time being, battles on water and on the coast continued.&lt;ref name=nofi188&gt;Nofi (1992), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of the notable naval conflicts were the [[Battle of Brazos River]], the [[Battle of Galveston Harbor]] and the [[Naval Battle of Campeche]].

Santa Anna re-emerged as a hero during the [[Pastry War]] in 1838. He was re-elected President, and in early 1842 under his orders, expeditions into Texas were led by [[Ráfael Vásquez (Mexican general)|Ráfael Vásquez]] with 500 men, then General [[Adrian Woll]] with 1,400 men.  Mexican troops commanded by Vasquez occupied Goliad, Refugio, and Victoria and, on March 5, entered San Antonio.  On March 15, a Texian militia gathered in San Antonio only to find the Mexican troops had left.  On September 11, 1842, Woll's troops occupied San Antonio.  On September 17 or 18, over 200 Texian militia under [[Mathew Caldwell]] ambushed 500 of Woll's troops and won the [[Battle of Salado Creek (1842)|Battle of Salado Creek]].  53 Texians responding to Caldwell's call for reinforcements were surprised near Salado Creek and killed, many in cold blood after surrendering, in the [[Dawson Massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/qem02 |title=MEXICAN INVASIONS OF 1842 |first=Jack W. |last=Gunn |work=Handbook of Texas Online |publisher=Texas State Historical Association |accessdate=1 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Woll retreated to Mexico with many hostages, including the local judge, clerk, district attorney and all attorneys attending the court session.  These hostages remained in captivity for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The San Antonio Bench and Bar Fight a Mexican Army and Lose |last=Paulsen |first=James |year=2012 |month=March |journal=Texas Bar Journal |volume=75 |series= |issue=9 |page=194 |location=Austin, TX |publisher=State Bar of Texas |editor1-first=Michelle |editor1-last=Hunter |accessdate=1 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Texian's pursuing the Mexicans and seeking retribution included the ill-fated [[Mier Expedition]].

Small clashes arose between the two countries for several years afterward. The war between Texas and Mexico did not truly come to an end until the [[Mexican-American War]] of 1846.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tsl.state.tx.us/treasures/republic/san-jacinto.html Texas State Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sam Houston's victory at San Jacinto would earn him the presidency of Republic of Texas twice. He later became a [[United States Senate|U.S. senator]] and [[governor of Texas]]. Stephen F. Austin, after a lost bid for Texas's presidency in 1836, was appointed Secretary of State but died two months later. Sam Houston eulogized Austin as the &quot;Father of Texas&quot;.
