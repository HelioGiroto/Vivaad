[[File:World-cannabis-laws.png|thumb|500px|World cannabis laws]]

The '''legality of cannabis''' concerns laws which in most countries regulate the use, possession, cultivation, transfer, and trade in [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. Since the beginning of widespread cannabis prohibition around the mid 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.drugwarrant.com/articles/why-is-marijuana-illegal/ |title=Why is Marijuana Illegal? |publisher=drugwarrant.com |accessdate=17 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; most countries have not re-legalized it for personal use, although more than 10 countries tolerate (or have decriminalized) its use and/or its cultivation in limited quantities. [[Medical cannabis|Medicinal use of cannabis]] is legal in a number of countries, including [[Canada]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Israel]] and 16 [[U.S. state|states]] of the [[United States]] (though it is illegal, according to U.S. federal law). In the [[Netherlands]] cannabis is formally illegal, but Justice guidelines show that no action is to be taken in case of possession of a small amount and sale under strict conditions.

Some countries have laws that are not as vigorously prosecuted as others but, apart from the countries that offer access to medical marijuana, most countries have various penalties ranging from lenient to very severe. Some infractions are taken more seriously in some countries than others in regard to the cultivation, use, possession or transfer of [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] for recreational use. A few jurisdictions have lessened penalties for possession of small quantities of cannabis, making it punishable by [[confiscation]] and a [[Fine (penalty)|fine]], rather than [[imprisonment]]. Some jurisdictions/[[drug court]]s use mandatory treatment programs for young or frequent users, with freedom from narcotic drugs as the goal and a few jurisdictions permit cannabis use for medicinal purposes. There are also changes in a more restrictive direction as in [[Canada]]. [[Drug test]]s to detect cannabis are increasingly common in many countries and have resulted in jail sentences and people losing their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wzzm13.com/news/news_story.aspx?storyid=119421&amp;catid=14 |title=Walmart fires Michigan man for using medical marijuana |publisher=Wzzm13.com |date=2010-03-12 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, simple possession can carry long jail sentences in some countries, particularly in parts of [[East Asia]], such as [[Malaysia]] where the sale of cannabis may lead to a sentence of life in prison or even execution.

Under the name cannabis, 19th century medical practitioners sold the drug (usually as a tincture), popularizing the word amongst English-speakers. It was rumoured that [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s menstrual pains were treated with cannabis; her personal physician, Sir John Russell Reynolds, wrote an article in the first edition of the medical journal ''[[The Lancet]]'' about the benefits of cannabis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reynolds&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jnnp.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/75/8/1148|title=Positive and negative cerebral symptoms: the roles of Russell Reynolds and Hughlings Jackson|accessdate=2006-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1894, the ''[[Indian Hemp Drugs Commission|Report of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission]]'' commissioned by the UK Secretary of State and the government of India, was instrumental in the decision not to criminalize the drug in those countries.&lt;ref&gt;Kaplan, J. (1969) &quot;Introduction&quot; of the ''Report of the Indian Hemp Drugs Commission'' ed. by The Honorable W. Mackworth Young, ''et al.'' (Simla: Government Central Printing Office, 1894) LCCN 74-84211, pp. v-vi.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1860 different states in the [[United States]] started to implement regulations for sales of ''Cannabis sativa.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Senate|newspaper=New York Times|date=February 15, 1860|location=New York City|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1860/02/16/news/senate-88150825.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1925 a change of the [[International Opium Convention]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/history/e1920/willoughby.htm |title=W.W. Willoughby: Opium as an International Problem, Baltimore, The Johns Hopkins Press, 1925 |publisher=Druglibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; banned exportation of ''Indian hemp'' to countries that have prohibited its use. Importing countries were required to issue certificates approving the importation and stating that the shipment was to be used &quot;exclusively for medical or scientific purposes&quot;.

In 1937 the F.D. Roosevelt administration crafted the [[Marihuana Tax Act of 1937|1937 Marihuana Tax Act]], the first US national law making cannabis possession illegal via an unpayable tax on the drug.

The name ''marijuana'' ([[Mexican Spanish]] ''marihuana'', ''mariguana'') is associated almost exclusively with the plant's psychoactive use. The term is now well known in English largely due to the efforts of American drug prohibitionists during the 1920s and 1930s. Mexico itself had passed prohibition in 1925, following the International Opium Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=MEXICO BANS MARIHUANA.; To Stamp Out Drug Plant Which Crazes Its Addicts|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 29, 1925|location=New York City|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20915FB3A5E1A7A93CBAB1789D95F418285F9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prohibitionists deliberately used a [[Mexico|Mexican]] name for cannabis in order to turn the US populace against the idea that it should be legal by playing to negative attitudes towards that nationality. (''See [[1937 Marihuana Tax Act]]''). Those who demonized the drug by calling it marihuana omitted the fact that the &quot;deadly marihuana&quot; was identical to ''Cannabis sativa'', which had at the time a reputation for pharmaceutical safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Woodward |publisher=Druglibrary.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many advocate legalization of cannabis, believing that it will eliminate the illegal trade and associated crime, yield a valuable tax-source and reduce policing costs. Cannabis is now available as a palliative agent, in Canada, with a medical prescription. In 1969, only 16% percent of voters in the USA supported legalization, according to a poll by Gallup. According to the same source, that number had risen to 36% by 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/19561/who-supports-marijuana-legalization.aspx|title=Who supports cannabis legalization?|accessdate=2009-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent polling indicates that the number has risen even further since the [[financial crisis of 2007-2009]]: in 2009, between 46% and 56% of US voters would support legalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/05/06/majority-of-americans-wan_n_198196.html|title=Majority of Americans Want Pot Legalized|accessdate=2009-08-31 | work=Huffington Post|first=Ryan|last=Grim|date=2009-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe has the development turned in the opposite direction in the Netherlands where the last few years certain strains of [[cannabis]] with higher concentrations of [[THC]] and [[drug tourism]] have challenged the former policy with legal sales of cannabis and led to more restrictive approach; e.g. ban of all sales of cannabis to tourists in [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]]s from the end of 2011 onward.

==Detection and the law==
[[File:Cannabis reflection.jpg|thumb|A chart demonstrating the reflective qualities of cannabis plants in comparison with other common plants. Growers may use these other plants  for cover. Law enforcement can conduct [[aerial reconnaissance]] of targeted areas and measure reflection to detect crops.]]

As cannabis and its cultivation are illegal in most parts of the world, considerable resources and effort are committed to both interdiction and counter-interdiction of cultivation. Thermal imaging helicopters (to detect hot lighting), inspection of trash (to find evidence of cultivation including waste plant matter), examination of credit card purchases (to find purchases from hydroponic equipment vendors), and analysis of energy bills (to detect energy usage patterns of marijuana growers), have been used in prosecutions. In the US, thermal imaging cameras are considered to violate civil liberties embedded in the United States Constitution. This has resulted in significant changes to domestic growing trends and has increased availability. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugscience.org/Petition/C5H.html |title=Effects of Cannabis Eradication on Cultivation Trends and General Availability |publisher=Drugscience.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=By country=
{{Main|Legality of cannabis by country}}

===Australia===
It is illegal to use, possess, grow or sell cannabis in [[Australia]], but penalties differ for each state or territory. In the [[Australian Capital Territory]], [[South Australia]], [[Western Australia]] and the [[Northern Territory]] there are differing degrees of decriminalization for minor offenses. In [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Tasmania]] and [[Queensland]] the possession of cannabis is considered a criminal offense.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCPICfactsheet&quot;&gt;[http://ncpic.org.au/workforce/alcohol-and-other-drug-workers/cannabis-information/factsheets/article/cannabis-and-the-law Cannabis and the Law Factsheet] - National Cannabis Preventions and Information Centre (Australia)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ACT a civil penalty system for possession of small amounts of cannabis was introduced in 1993. Possession of up to 25g or two non-hydroponic plants attracts a fine of A$100 to be paid within 60 days. Offenders can choose to attend the Alcohol and Drug Program.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACT-ATODS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://health.act.gov.au/c/health?a=&amp;did=10107160 |title=ACT Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs Strategy |publisher=Health.act.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Australia possession of small quantities of cannabis is decriminalized attracting fines similar to a parking ticket. However, penalties for cultivation of marijuana have become harsher since the widespread advent of large scale cultivation. There is much confusion on the subject, with many people believing that possession of a certain amount is legal.

The Northern Territory, since 1996, adults found in possession of up to 50&amp;nbsp;grams of marijuana, one gram of hash oil, 10&amp;nbsp;grams of hash or cannabis seed, or two non-hydroponic plants can be fined $200 with 28 days to expiate rather than face a criminal charge.

In Western Australia, as of August 2011: A person found in possession of 10&amp;nbsp;grams or less of cannabis will receive a Cannabis Intervention Requirement notice to attend a mandatory one on one counselling session. Quantities larger than this attract a penalty of A$2000 or two years in jail, or both. A person found in possession of more than 100g of cannabis would be deemed to have that quantity for supply and could face a penalty of A$20,000 or two years in jail. It is also illegal for cannabis smoking implements to be displayed in shops or sold, with fines up to A$10,000 for sales to adults and jail for up to two years or a fine of up to A$24,000 for selling to minors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Lloyd|title=Tough New Cannabis Laws For WA|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/tough-new-cannabis-laws-for-wa-20110717-1hjq2.html|accessdate=28 January 2012|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=July 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposing political sides have accused the government of changing the laws to appear tough on drugs in response to an increased public fear of clandestine drug labs following a number of them exploding in suburban areas.

In New South Wales, Queensland, Victoria and Tasmania first-time offences for possession and use of small amounts of cannabis or cannabis products (e.g. cannabis oil or resin) can be dealt with by diversion programs, which aim to divert offenders into education, assessment and treatment programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCPICfactsheet&quot;/&gt; In New South Wales if you are caught with up to 15g of cannabis, at the police's discretion, up to two cautions can be issued.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCPICfactsheet&quot;/&gt; In Tasmania up to three cautions can be issued for possession of up to 50g of cannabis, with a hierarchy of referrals for treatment then intervention for each caution.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCPICfactsheet&quot;/&gt; Similarly in Victoria up to 50g of cannabis will attract a caution and the opportunity to attend an education program;&lt;ref name=&quot;VicDrugServicesCannabis&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20110107194906/http://www.health.vic.gov.au/drugservices/services/fs_cannabis.htm |title=Victoria Cannabis Cautioning Program |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2011-01-07 |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; only two cautions will be dealt out. In Queensland possession of cannabis or any schedule 1 or 2 drug specified in the Drugs Misuse Regulation 1987&lt;ref name=&quot;QLDDrugsMisuseReg87&quot;&gt;[http://www.legislation.qld.gov.au/LEGISLTN/CURRENT/D/DrugsMisuseA86.pdf Drugs Misuse Regulation 1987], Queensland&lt;/ref&gt; carries a maximum prison sentence of 15 years, however, jail terms for minor possessions are very rare. Possession of smoking utensils or anything used to smoke cannabis is also a criminal offense in Queensland. However, under the Police Powers and Responsibilities Act 2000 a person who admits to carrying not more than 50&amp;nbsp;grams (and is not committing any other offence) must be offered a drug diversion program.

With the rapid expansion in hydroponic cannabis cultivation, the Australian Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act (1985) was amended in 2006, reducing the amount of cannabis grown indoors under hydroponic conditions that qualifies as a 'commercial quantity' or as a 'large quantity'.&lt;ref name=&quot;NCPICfactsheet&quot;/&gt;

===Bangladesh===
Cannabis is grown throughout the [[Bengal]] region, which is currently split between [[Bangladesh]] and the [[India]]n state of [[West Bengal]]. In both parts of Bengal, cannabis ([[Bengali language|Bengali]]: গাঁজা ''gãja'')  has been widely used for centuries. Cannabis was banned in Northern Bangladesh in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/ecosocdev/geninfo/drugs/souasi_e.htm 1995 Annual Report of the International Narcotics Control Board], [[International Narcotics Control Board]], [[United Nations]], 1995&lt;/ref&gt; As of now, cannabis is  still illegally available in the underground markets of Bangladesh, and is in somewhat common use among people. It is known as ganja or hashish, and drunk in bhang.

===Belgium===
Individual or solo use by adults has the lowest priority to police and government instances, if the use doesn't cause any problems to their environment. This basically means only the use in public places, possession of more than 3&amp;nbsp;grams, or the sale of the drug are pursued in court. However, the use in the presence of minors is strictly forbidden. The cultivation of one female cannabis plant for personal use is decriminalized.
Other than cultivating a female cannabis plant, there is no legal way of obtaining cannabis.

===Brazil===
On June 15, 2011, the eight ministers of [[Brazil]]'s [[Supreme Federal Court|Supreme Court]] (STF) that participated in the trial were unanimous in free demonstrations for the legalization of drugs, such as the '''''Marcha da Maconha''''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈmaʁʃɐ da mɐˈkõȷ̃ɐ}}, ''Marijuana Walk'') in Brazil (part of the [[Global Marijuana March]]), in which they decided that the demonstrations are an exercise of freedom of expression and not incitement to [[Crime in Brazil|crime]], as argued judges who have banned the march in the past. The discussion of the ''Marcha da Maconha'' reached the Supreme Court in June 2009 when the Deputy Attorney General of the Republic Deborah Duprat filed the claim of breach of fundamental precept, [[ADPF 187]]. In the lawsuit, the attorney states that the legal prohibition of the demonstrations in favor of marijuana and other narcotics have been based on misinterpretation of the [[Law of Brazil|Criminal Code]]. She said that it is &quot;wrong&quot; to say that the realization of these events are an &quot;apology to crime&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stf.jus.br/portal/cms/verNoticiaDetalhe.asp?idConteudo=182124 |title=Notícias STF :: STF - Supremo Tribunal Federal |publisher=STF |date= |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/cotidiano/ultimas-noticias/2011/06/15/stf-decide-que-ato-por-legalizacao-de-drogas-e-liberdade-de-expressao-e-libera-marcha-da-maconha.htm |title=STF decide que ato por legalização de drogas é liberdade de expressão e libera Marcha da Maconha - Notícias - UOL Notícias |publisher=Noticias.uol.com.br |date= |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of smoking marijuana was bought to Brazil from its [[Slavery in Brazil|African slaves]], and with the [[Eugenics|eugenic]] [[Positivism|positivist]] intellectual and political status quo of the [[Western world|Western civilization]] in the early 20th century, its use was deemed as a signal of decadence by its stigmatized use as a [[recreational drug use|recreational drug]] of the poor, the rural people and the [[Afro-Brazilian]]. It was deemed to cause serious harm both to the physical and to the mental health of smokers and blamed recreational cannabis use for multiple problems such as &quot;idiocy, violence, unbridled sensuality, madness and racial degeneration&quot;. In fact, little knowledge about cannabis was generalized, with many likening its effects to those produced by [[opium]], and also considered to be immensely addictive in similar levels. Its association with the [[counterculture]] and [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] [[youth]]s during the highly [[Anti-Communism|anti-Communist]] [[History of Brazil (1964-1985)|military dictatorship]], initially a strong ally of the United States' government, fortified its negative perceptions both by the authorities and the masses, and many myths relative to marijuana and its users circulate up to day, even being the topic by far not a taboo as it was in the past decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;encod.org&quot; /&gt;

Nevertheless, since the [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] centre-right government of [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] (1994–2002), position strengthened in the so-called ''Era [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva|Lula]]'' (2003–2010), individual marijuana use by adults started to have no major importance to police and government instances – though not, ironically (since the country has major crime problems with [[Illegal drug trade|drug dealers]]), its domestic cultivation for own consumption. One can see and smell people smoking the so-called ''maconha'' openly in Brazil's [[Centro-Sul|Centre-Southern half]] as well as in the [[Northeast Region, Brazil|Northeastern states]], and recreational use of cannabis in private became more accepted among large sectors of the middle classes since the early 1990s. The academic milieu is no exception and, today, a sizeable minority of Brazilian University lecturers, students and researchers smoke cannabis.&lt;ref name=&quot;encod.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Prohibitionist Drug Policies and the Subculture of Cannabis Use in Two Brazilian Middle Class Urban Settings|url=http://www.encod.org/info/Cannabis-and-Prohibition-in-Brazil.html|date=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
{{Main|Cannabis legalization in Canada}}
Cannabis is currently illegal in Canada, with exceptions only for medical usage. The marijuana laws in Canada are currently under review as an Ontario court judge deemed the laws unconstitutional thus giving the government 90 days, as of April 13, 2011, to revamp the law. As of June 22, 2011, the prosecutor and federal government was granted a stay on the 90 day deadline, extending it by an additional 6 months, pushing the deadline back to November.

*A July 13, 2007, decision in Ontario Provincial court has ruled that criminal possession laws for cannabis are unconstitutional (R. v. Long). However, Toronto police spokesman Mark Pugash said that nothing will change about how the police deal with marijuana possession for the time being.&lt;ref name=&quot;ontariocannabis&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2007/07/13/pot-toronto.html|title= Judge rules Canada's pot possession laws unconstitutional|publisher=[[CBC News|CBC]]|date=2007-07-19|accessdate=2007-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*Possession of cannabis is not illegal in Canada according to Justice Edmonson of the Ontario Court of Justice in R. v. Bodnar/Hall/Spasic - &quot;there is no offence known to law which the accused have committed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Edmonson&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thepotlawhasfallen.ca/2007October19_img.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080616064522/http://www.thepotlawhasfallen.ca/2007October19_img.html|archivedate=2008-06-16|title=Scan of OCJ Decision|publisher=OCJ|date=2007-10-19|accessdate=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannabis Culture Magazine&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cannabisculture.com/articles/5115.html|title=Another Judge Agrees: Canada's Pot Laws Are Unconstitutional and DO NOT EXIST!|publisher[[Cannabis Culture Magazine]]|date=2007-11-16|accessdate=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Marijuana was first banned in Canada in 1923 under the Opium and Drug Act. Since 1997 marijuana has been covered by the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. &lt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/marijuana/marijuana_legalize.html&gt;
*The Special Senate Committee on Illegal Drugs reviewed Canada's current anti-drug policies and legislation and reported in September 2002 that marijuana is not a gateway drug and should be treated more like tobacco or alcohol than harder drugs.
*The House of Commons Special Committee on the Non-Medical Use of Drugs looked at an overall drug strategy for Canada and issued their report in December 2002. The House committee said that while marijuana is unhealthy, the current criminal penalties for possession and use of small amounts of cannabis are disproportionately harsh. They recommended that the Canadian Ministers of Justice and of Health come up with a strategy to decriminalize the possession and cultivation of not more than thirty grams of cannabis for personal use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Canada Online&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://canadaonline.about.com/od/marijuana/Marijuana_in_Canada.htm|title=Marijuana Reform Bill|publisher=[[Munroe, Susan]]|year=2008|accessdate=2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Various estimates peg this country's cannabis trade at considerably more than $7&amp;nbsp;billion in annual sales—twice as much as pig farming brings in, and almost three times more than wheat does. Even the cattle industry, at $5.2&amp;nbsp;billion a year in revenue, lags behind the marijuana business for sheer size. Just as importantly, the report points out, every dollar reaped by government regulation of the pot industry would be a dollar taken away from the criminal gangs that run the industry today. In 2001, Auditor General Sheila Fraser said the federal government was spending close to $500 million a year fighting the drug trade. Roughly 95 per cent of that goes to enforcement and policing, and two-thirds of the country's 50,000 annual drug arrests are for cannabis offences.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maclean's Magazine&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.macleans.ca/article.jsp?content=20041122_93410_93410&amp;source=srch|title=A Case For Marijuana Inc|publisher=[[Maich, Steve]]|year=2004|accessdate=2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Prime Minister Harper announced a new National Anti-Drug Strategy. A proposed Bill would have dealers facing one-year mandatory prison sentences if they’re operating for organized crime purposes, or if violence is involved. Dealers would also face a two-year mandatory jail sentence if they’re selling to youth, or dealing drugs near a school or an area normally frequented by youth. Additionally, people in Canada who run a large marijuana grow operation of at least 500 plants would risk facing a mandatory two-year jail term.

Perhaps the biggest proposed policy change is mandatory six-month sentencing for those growing as little as one marijuana plant for the purposes of trafficking. If the Bill passes, this is also likely to be felt by small-time distributors who are not linked to the ring of organized crime, and who usually face no more than a fine if caught.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vancouver |first=The |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=e3f8a100-2f8e-4b73-b131-3411c2619f58 |title=Tories reveal mandatory jail terms for growing marijuana |publisher=Canada.com |date=2007-11-21 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Conservative Party now holds a majority government, with the NDP (New Democratic Party) as the official opposition.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfu.ca/~aheard/elections/results.html&lt;/ref&gt; Previous attempts by past Liberal Governments in the late 1990s and early 2000s to decriminalize marijuana for personal use have failed to become law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/marijuana/marijuana_legalize.html |title=Canada's marijuana law and the debate over decriminalization |publisher=Cbc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 20, 2011, the newly-elected Conservative majority government re-introduced an omnibus crime bill, Bill C-10. (formely known as the &quot;Safe Streets and Communities Act&quot;) The bill combines more than 10 different pieces of previously unpassed criminal legislation, as well as proposing to amend the [[Criminal Code of Canada]] with respect to drug offences. This bill specifically targets growers, dealers and consumers of cannabis, introducing mandatory minimum sentences for the cultivation of modest amounts of cannabis. This proposed legislation has come under substantial criticism and scrutiny from opposition party MPs as well as numerous experts and intellectuals, particularly from the US. The position of the Harper government is notably in defiance of credible evidence of the harm caused by the decades of drug prohibition, contrary to many US states (most notably [[Texas]]), which are relaxing drug laws. The provinces of [[Ontario]], [[Quebec]] and [[British Columbia]] have expressed their opposition towards bearing the likely great costs and other effects the bill will bring, particularly since the government has not yet disclosed the costs as well as some other information associated with the proposed legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabisfacts.ca/mandatoryminimums.html |title=Cannabis Facts for Canadians &gt; Omnibus Crime Bill C-10: mandatory minimum sentences for &quot;organized&quot; drug crimes |publisher=Cannabisfacts.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costa Rica===

Cannabis is used in [[Costa Rica]], in spite of it being illegal. Police officers might not arrest someone unless the amount carried is seemingly for distribution or selling. Much of it is grown in the rain forest reserves, as no person can be prosecuted for that, but more potent strains are grown hydroponically in small grow-ops in San José. There is a small percentage coming from [[Jamaica]], but the most popular kind is grown locally. [[Laura Chinchilla]], the president of Costa Rica (2010–2014) stated -&quot;It must be approached very rigorously based on empiric evidence and the experiences other countries have had when boarding widely the concept of legalization [...]&quot; after a meeting with [[José Miguel Insulza]], Secretary General of the [[Organization of American States]], regarding the fight against hard drug smuggling from [[Colombia]] to the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nacion.com/2010-08-24/ElPais/NotasSecundarias/ElPais2495186.aspx |title=Chinchilla ve complicado legalizar la marihuana - EL PAÍS - La Nación |publisher=Nacion.com |date=2010-08-24 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Czech Republic===

In 1938 production and possession (but not the consumption) of drugs became a punishable crime in [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jod.sagepub.com/content/37/1/45 |title=Legislation and Practice concerning Prosecution of Drug Offenses in the Czech Republic, Journal of Drug Issues 2007 37: 45 p.47 |publisher=Jod.sagepub.com |date=2007-01-01 |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law did not distinguish between different types of drugs. Until the [[Velvet Revolution]] (1989) narcotics were only a minor problem in Czech society. A law from 1992 stopped criminalization of drug possession for personal use. This changed in 1998, &quot;''possession of more than a small amount of drugs''&quot; (the amount was not defined) became a criminal offence again. The limits were defined later through internal research by Czech law enforcers making the possession of under 15&amp;nbsp;grams not a crime. The owner could be fined. Consumption was not punishable. Enforcement of the law was spotty and sometimes inconsistent. The impact of this change was reviewed by a Czech Government report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglawreform.info/en/issues/decriminalization/item/787-impact-analysis-project-of-new-drugs-legislation |title=Impact Analysis Project of New Drugs Legislation, Secretariat of the National Drug Commission Office of the Czech Government |publisher=Druglawreform.info |date=1999-01-01 |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; which found the availability of illicit drugs did not decrease and there had been no reduction in prevalence of illicit drug use as a result of the 1998 re-criminalisation.  

The Czech cabinet approved a Justice Ministry proposal in early 2010 that sets personal use quantity limits for illicit drugs under a penal code revision that decriminalizes drug possession in the Czech Republic. Under the new law, possession of less than the following amounts of illicit drugs is a misdemeanor subject to fines equal to a parking ticket:

* [[Marijuana]] 15&amp;nbsp;grams (or five plants)
* [[Hashish]] 5&amp;nbsp;grams
* [[Magic mushrooms]] 40 pieces
* [[Peyote]] 5 plants
* [[LSD]] 5 tablets
* [[Ecstasy (drug)|Ecstasy]] 4 tablets
* [[Amphetamine]] 2&amp;nbsp;grams
* [[Methamphetamine]] 2&amp;nbsp;grams
* [[Heroin]] 1.5&amp;nbsp;grams
* [[Coca]] 5 plants
* [[Cocaine]] 1&amp;nbsp;gram

Possession of “larger than a small amount” of marijuana can result in a jail sentence of up to one year. For other illicit drugs, the sentence is two years. Trafficking offenses carry stiffer sentences. The Czech Republic now joins [[Portugal]] as a European country that has decriminalized drug possession.

Young people are the most frequent users of marijuana: a poll from 2007 estimated that almost 30% of Czechs under 24 had tried it. In 2007 the [[Supreme Court of the Czech Republic]] ruled that mere cultivation of hemp should not be punishable unless production of the drug is proven; an officer from the Czech anti-drug unit was quoted saying that &quot;this decision is irrelevant to our work.&quot; As of 2007 several initiatives towards either decriminalization of marijuana or creating a more tolerated category of ''soft drugs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;All texts in Czech language.

===Denmark===

In Denmark, despite a general public tolerance towards cannabis for private consumption, cannabis remains illegal. Possession of less than 10&amp;nbsp;grams (.35 oz) cannabis is punishable by a fine of 2000DKK (370USD) for a first-time offender, 3000DKK for a second-time offender, and 4000DKK for a third-time offender. However, possession of small quantities of cannabis, or public use, often is tolerated by the police and people involved in it go away with a verbal warning.

Denmark's capital, [[Copenhagen]] is home to a self-proclaimed autonomous neighborhood called [[Freetown Christiania|Christiania]], where cannabis and hashish are both sold openly. In a display of Denmark’s tolerance, this sale, which has fueled an alternative, freewheeling, culture in Christiania, was allowed largely unhindered until 2004, when sanctions were imposed to moderate it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Make it a mad Monday for Christiania’s Big 4-0|newspaper=Copenhagen Post|date=September 22, 2011|location=Copenhagen|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100208075212/http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?|archivedate=2010-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2004, a number of raids led by Danish authorities have led to unrest and tension between Christiania's residents and the Danish government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Danish police arrest 53 in drugs raid on Christiania|newspaper=The Independent|date=March 17, 2004|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/danish-police-arrest-53-in-drugs-raid-on-christiania-566587.html?|location=London|first=Leyla|last=Linton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Massive haul at Christiania police raid|newspaper=Copenhagen Post|date=April 12, 2011|url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/crime/155-crime/51421-massive-haul-at-christiania-police-raid-.html?}}{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, [[Copenhagen Municipality]] has been in favor of legalizing cannabis via state-run coffee-shops, in order to take over the control of the substance which is currently mostly supplied by criminal gangs.&lt;ref name=cph-telegraph&gt;{{cite news|last=Orange|first=Richard|title=Copenhagen votes to legalise marijuana|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/denmark/8899243/Copenhagen-votes-to-legalise-marijuana.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=21 November 2011|location=London|date=2011-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal could make the city the first to fully legalise marijuana consumption, but it still has to be approved by the [[Folketing]].

===Estonia===
It is illegal to grow, possess or trade cannabis in Estonia. Consumption and possession in small amounts will lead to a fine. Larger amounts than 10&amp;nbsp;grams is considered trafficking and can lead to a maximum jail sentence of 5 years. Growing is illegal and can lead to a jail sentence, which can also be up to 5 years.  Possession of seeds is legal, import and export is illegal.

===Finland===
Possession, manufacture and use of cannabis products were prohibited by law in Finland in 1972. The parliamentary discussion and the following vote resulted in a stalemate, so the issue was resolved by [[Sortition|drawing lots]] - which resulted in cannabinoid products becoming illegal.
In practice, possession or manufacture of cannabis products is considered to be a minor misdemeanor punishable by a minor fine (normally in the range of 60-500 euros). A supreme court decision of 2004 set up a &quot;half a dozen&quot; precedent: Cultivation of up to 6 plants for personal use is subject to the same penalties as personal use. The same applies to distribution and use within a &quot;closed circle of users&quot;.
However, open distribution is generally punished very severely.
Aside from criminal penalties, users are often persecuted by welfare authorities on the pretext of child welfare (if the user has offspring); withdrawal of driving license is also commonplace.

In 2010 police first time used the law passed in 2006, which makes selling equipment for creating or growing drugs illegal. This resulted in closing of a gardening store Viherpeukku and 200 home searches through the customer register. The owners of Viherpeukku were charged for selling gardening equipment with knowledge, that they could be used in home growing of Cannabis. Some controversy rose from the home searches due many of them being done into legal chili farmers houses. Those charges were later dropped by the supreme court. The court saw that although the owners might have known that some of the fertilizers may have been used for cultivation of cannabis, they are not directly aiming at that market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.verkkouutiset.fi/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=44882%3Akannabiskasvatukseen-sopivien-tuotteiden-myynti-ei-riko-lakia-ennakkotapaus&amp;Itemid=8 |title=Verkkouutiset - Kannabiskasvatukseen sopivien tuotteiden myynti ei riko lakia - ennakkotapaus |publisher=Verkkouutiset.fi |date=2010-12-17 |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
In [[France]] the law prohibits &quot;any presentation in a favorable light&quot; of narcotic substances. Because of this law, organizations seeking to promote the decriminalization (as the collective information and research cannabis) are often put off-the-law and therefore risk severe penalties for incitement to drug use. In addition, a public body, MILDT (Interministerial Mission for the fight against drugs and addiction) informs extensively (website, brochures, etc..) On the hard drugs, placing cannabis in the midst of them, the compared to drugs such as cocaine or LSD.

Harm reduction is recognized by French law since 2004.

The law allows the movement of hemp (cannabis seeds) and their trade between the Member States of the European Free Trade Area (EU + Norway, Switzerland and Iceland).

Individuals can use hemp legal (with a certificate of compliance) for personal use only; their production, use and cultivation for commercial or professional activity is subject to authorization. These varieties are in fact non-psychoactive hemp. Individuals are required to retain certificates of conformity provided for sale of hemp or, failing that, the package that lists the references, in order to prove that the variety planted or owned is allowed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20110726142049/http://www.drogues.gouv.fr/qr_reponse.php3?id_rubrique=145&amp;id=10231&amp;list_page=1&amp;list_records_by_page=50  Site de la Mission Interministérielle de Lutte contre la Drogue et la Toxicomanie] '''Question à la MILDT''': ''Y aurait-il des variétés sans THC qui seraient autorisées ? Sont-elles utilisables comme plante d’ornement ?'' '''Réponse de la MILDT''': ''Les graines de cannabis dont la teneur en THC est inférieure à 0,2% sont autorisées en France, à condition toutefois de faire, pour chaque variété, l’objet d’une autorisation par décret. Entre 10 et 20 variétés de cannabis sont donc autorisées. L’utilisation de telles graines n’est donc pas illégale en France et elle se fait depuis longtemps. Mais ces variétés de cannabis n’ont pas d’effet psychotrope et ne correspondent qu’à des utilisations commerciales ou industrielles. Un particulier peut les utiliser pour son besoin personnel (pêche, jardinage, nourriture pour oiseaux, ... ) mais ne peut en faire le commerce ou la production à grande échelle sans autorisation préalable. ''&lt;/ref&gt; These varieties of cannabis on the list issued by the European Union, must be a decree that requires their permission.

All imports from countries not members of the European zone of free exchange can be performed by an importer licensed by the European Union.

The specificity of the French law led to a formal speech that can seem quite confusing to most other European nationals.

Besides the debate, French law bans the production, possession, sale, purchase and use of drugs, with penalties more or less severe depending on the act.

Traffic, that is to say, the possession, transport, supply, transfer or acquisition of narcotic, is punished with imprisonment for a term exceeding ten years or a fine up to 7.5 million euros&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006417724&amp;dateTexte=20110422 |title=Art. 222-37 of the Penal Code |language={{fr icon}} |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date=1992-07-22 |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The simple use is normally punished by a maximum sentence of one year imprisonment or a fine of up to 3 750 euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006072665&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006688173&amp;dateTexte=20110422 |title=Art. 3421-1 of Public Health Code |language={{fr icon}} |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date=2002-03-04 |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the consumer can simply be treated as a trafficker and therefore be liable to the same penalties. Indeed, cannabis necessarily implies to hold, and thus to buy or to produce, leaving free the judge to penalize the user on the basis of the Code of Public Health (use ) or the Penal Code (possession / trafficking / production). Specifically, the judge's decision will depend mainly seizures, history of the accused, etc..

As for production, even for personal use, it is punishable by a maximum sentence of twenty years'imprisonment or a fine of up to 7.5 million euros.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do?cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;idArticle=LEGIARTI000006417718&amp;dateTexte=20110422 |title=Art. 222-35 of the Penal Code |language={{fr icon}} |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date=1992-07-22 |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
While illegal, possession is generally not fined as long as a certain maximum amount (so called &quot;geringe Menge&quot; = English &quot;small amount&quot;) is not exceeded. This maximum amount varies between 6 and 15&amp;nbsp;grams depending on which particular [[States of Germany|federal state]] the person is in and the potential amount of THC. The person caught will have the cannabis confiscated. Until 2002 one could have one's driver's license taken away because of cannabis possession, even if driving a car was not involved. This still happens today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabislegal.de/recht/fs.htm#karlsruhe |title=Cannabis und Führerschein |publisher=Cannabislegal.de |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Use'' of cannabis is not illegal in Germany.

Law enforcement in the city of [[Berlin]] and many other major cities currently places a very low priority on enforcement of cannabis laws; many people smoke openly in parks and bars throughout the central city.

===Honduras===
In Honduras it is illegal to grow, plant, harvest, collect or possess cannabis. Violators can face 9 to 12 years in prison and a fine of 5,000 [[Honduran lempira|Lps.]] (US$265) to 25,000 [[Honduran lempira|Lps.]] (US$1,323). It is also illegal to own cannabis seeds. Traffickers can face 15 to 20 years in prison and a fine of 1,000,000 Lps. to 5,000,000 Lps.

===Hong Kong===

The possession, cultivation and trafficking of cannabis are illegal in [[Hong Kong]], and is punishable under The Dangerous Drug Ordinance&lt;ref name=&quot;Hong Kong&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.police.gov.hk/ppp_en/04_crime_matters/drug/law_pen.html |title=Information on the official web site of the Hong Kong Police Force |publisher=Police.gov.hk |date= |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Chapter 134 of the [[Law of Hong Kong]]), which contains the following key points:
* Any person who traffics in a dangerous drug shall be liable upon conviction to a fine of [[Hong Kong dollar|HK$]] 5,000,000 and   imprisonment for life, where trafficking includes selling or giving away any amount of a dangerous drug.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hong Kong&quot;/&gt;
* Any person who manufactures a dangerous drug, shall be liable upon conviction to a fine of HK$ 5,000,000 and   imprisonment for life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hong Kong&quot;/&gt;
* Any person who has in his possession; or smokes, inhales, ingest or injects a dangerous drug, shall be liable upon conviction to a fine HK$ 1,000,000 and imprisonment for 7 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hong Kong&quot;/&gt;
* Any person who has in his possession any pipe, equipment or apparatus fit and intended for the smoking, inhalation, ingestion or injection of a dangerous drug, shall be liable upon conviction to a fine of HK$10,000 and  imprisonment for 3 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hong Kong&quot;/&gt;
* Any person who cultivates any plant of the genus cannabis or opium poppy, shall be liable upon conviction to a fine of HK$ 100,000 and  imprisonment for 15 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hong Kong&quot;/&gt;
[[Mainland China]] has a different legal system from Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hong Kong&quot;/&gt;

===India===
Often seen as the country where the plant originates from, throughout India it is illegal to grow, consume, or traffic cannabis since 1980, although there is a variation in penalties and enforcement according to the region. Usage of cannabis, also locally known as ganja ([[Sanskrit]] ''ganjika'') or ''[[bhang]]'' (when made into a drink) is common and not prosecuted throughout [[India]]. [[Sadhu]]s openly smoke ''ganja'' and there are government licensed ''bhang'' shops in some regions. Furthermore, on the festival of [[Holi]], cannabis is widely consumed in the open in its numerous forms. [[Charas]], [[bhang]] and ganja (with seeds in it) are by far the most common forms of the drug in India; it is widely available and [[bhang]] and ganja are relatively inexpensive. [[Charas]] on the other hand is quite expensive and not available all over the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;chipmonk&quot;&gt;http://www.antidrugs.gov.il/download/files/indian_drug-laws.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===

The most recent Misuse of Drugs (Designation) Order ([http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1998/en/si/0069.html S.I. No. 69/1998]) lists [[cannabis]], [[Hashish|cannabis resin]], [[cannabis]] and its derivatives as [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances#Schedules of Controlled Substances|Schedule 1]] drugs under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act (Ireland)|Misuse of Drugs Acts of 1977 and 1984]]. As a consequence manufacture, production, preparation, sale, supply, distribution and possession of cannabis is unlawful for any purpose, except under license from the [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health]].
The [[gardaí]] (Irish police) have a level of discretion when dealing with recreational cannabis users. To procure a conviction any cannabis seized has to be sent for analysis to the Garda Forensic Science Laboratory. This, along with the time needed to process the arrest, means that individual gardaí may decide not to arrest for small amounts,
Gardaí cannot arrest for simple possession if they are satisfied with the name and address of the offender. If there are enough drugs for sale or supply then Gardaí can arrest but the drug will be seized and the name and address of the individual will be taken. Possession of cannabis is an arrestable offense and, in 2003, 53 per cent of all drug confiscations and 70 per cent of all drug-related prosecutions were for cannabis. Trafficking or possession with intent to supply are serious offenses under [[Law of the Republic of Ireland|Irish law]].

Upon being brought to [[Courts of Ireland|court]], the penalties for possession are outlined as follows:
*'''First offense:''' On summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding €381, or on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €635.
*'''Second offense:''' On summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding €508, or on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €1,269.
*'''Third or subsequent offense:''' On summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding €1,269 or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding twelve months, or to both the fine and the imprisonment, or on conviction on indictment, to a fine of such amount as the court considers appropriate or, at the discretion of the court, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding three years, or to both the fine and the imprisonment.
There is no law against possession or sale of cannabis seeds. However, the growing of cannabis, even for medicinal benefits by genuine sufferers, is often treated harshly by the courts.
Various movements have been founded to legalize the drug{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}, including an attempt at starting a cannabis legalization political party.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Current [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]] member [[Luke 'Ming' Flanagan|Luke Flanagan]] the former mayor of [[Roscommon]] is known for his long running campaign to legalise cannabis.

===Israel===

Israel considers cannabis illegal; however, punishment is not severe for &quot;personal use&quot;. The amount defined by the law as &quot;for personal use&quot; is 15g of marijuana and hashish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-stoned.com/rec/102-Cannabis-in-Israel |title=Cannabis in Israel, Marijuana and hash in the holy land - Local Cannabis Policies &amp; Prices / World Wide Weed Guide / Countries |publisher=E-stoned |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the popularity of [[nargila]] in Israel, smoking using paraphernalia is a common sight at popular street cafes. Consequently, there is little [[social stigma]] attached to smoking using marijuana paraphernalia.

A medical marijuana program is existent; however patients must meet certain prerequisites. The categories include patients suffering from nausea induced by chemotherapy or those in the later stages of HIV.&lt;ref name=&quot;israelity.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://israelity.com/2009/03/22/israel-going-to-pot/ |title=Israel going to pot |publisher=Israelity |date=2009-03-22 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trials have been conducted by the [[Israel Defence Forces|IDF]] for soldiers experiencing [[Posttraumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;israelity.com&quot;/&gt;

===Italy===
Cannabis is illegal in Italy. Current legislation establishes quantitative limits of [[active ingredient]]: within those limits it is considered an [[administrative law|administrative]] offense, over them it is regarded as [[Illegal drug trade|pushing]]; whoever is considered to produce, sell, give or traffic every kind of substance is punished with 6–20 years of [[imprisonment]]. The years are reduced to 1-3 if the [[Plant cultivation|cultivation]] is for personal use only. However, [[jurisprudence]] is contradictory concerning growing for personal use. Medical use of substances prepared with marijuana are legal, if provided by medical prescription.

In July 2008, however, the [[Court of Cassation (Italy)|Italian Supreme Court]] ruled that Rastafari may be allowed to possess greater amounts of cannabis legally, owing to its use by them as a sacrament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL1041616220080710 |title=Rasta pot smokers win legal leeway in Italy |publisher=Reuters |date=2008-07-10 |accessdate=2010-02-01 | first=Phil | last=Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20100211174526/http://news.aol.com/story/_a/rasta-smoker-wins-appeal-of-marijuana/n20080711112609990016 |title=AOL News - Rasta smoker wins appeal of marijuana conviction |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2010-02-11 |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 2006, the [[Congress of Mexico]] passed a bill decriminalizing possession of small amounts of drugs intended for recreational use (up to 5g for marijuana).&lt;ref name=&quot;mexicolegal&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Noel|last=Randewich|author=Noel Randewich|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060428/ts_nm/mexico_drugs_dc|title=Mexico to decriminalize pot, cocaine and heroin|publisher=Reuters|date=2006-04-28|accessdate=2006-04-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060504045737/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060428/ts_nm/mexico_drugs_dc |archivedate = May 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new bill was hoped to relieve cartel-related crime as well as reduce drug-related arrests. A possibly [[unintended consequence]] would have been increased tourism. The move caused many in the US government to question Mexico's commitment to the [[War on Drugs]]. However, President Fox sent the legislation back, asking that the decriminalization be removed. This action showed the U.S. government's influence over the Mexican Government's decisions,&lt;ref name=&quot;legaldrug&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/mexico/20060504-9999-1n4fox.html|title=Mexican legal drug proposal rejected|publisher=Sign On San Diego|date=2006-05-04|accessdate=2006-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; sparking broad controversy over the bill.&lt;ref name=&quot;deniespressure&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dominicantoday.com/app/article.aspx?id=13096|title=Mexico denies drug law veto result of US pressure|publisher=Dominican Today|date=2006-05-04|accessdate=2006-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;consulateprotest&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0605/S00095.htm|title=Protest at Mexican Consulate in New York, Friday|publisher=Scoop|date=2006-05-05|accessdate=2006-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;smokein&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,194552,00.html|title=Drug Bill Veto Sparks Mexico City Marijuana Smoke-In|publisher=[[Fox News]]|date=2006-06-05|accessdate=2006-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 14, 2008 a bill was proposed in Mexico City's Congress to legalize the consumption, possession and commerce of Marijuana. The bill states that only a person over 18 can have access to the drug, the places where marijuana is sold cannot also sell alcoholic drinks, and must be at least 1000 meters away from schools{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. The Government would issue special licenses for the distribution of marijuana in special places, similar to the legislation in the Netherlands.

On August 21, 2009, Mexico decriminalized &quot;personal use&quot; possession of up to 5&amp;nbsp;grams of marijuana, half a gram of cocaine, 50 milligrams of heroin, 40 milligrams for methamphetamine and 0.015 milligrams of LSD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/08/21/world/americas/21mexico.html | work=The New York Times | title=Mexico Legalizes Drug Possession | date=2009-08-21 | accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nepal===

Marijuana was made illegal in Nepal in mid 70's but it was never really enforced. It is widely tolerated: in some parts of the country - mostly in rural areas - it is a way of life. Law against marijuana is rarely enforced although selling and transporting of hashish could be taken seriously. It has been a very popular destination for teenagers from countries like Israel for the same reason. {{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

===Netherlands===
{{Main|Drug policy of the Netherlands}}

The possession/purchase of Cannabis is tolerated in small amounts. One can purchase cannabis in special shops (called &quot;coffeeshops&quot;) if one is aged eighteen and over. Sale and purchase of cannabis anywhere else is illegal. Cultivation and wholesale of cannabis is likewise &quot;tolerated&quot; in small amounts (guidelines here are no more than five plants at home or the possession of 5&amp;nbsp;grams per adult max.). The tolerance guidelines appear in appendix of the Opium Act. The Opium Act states very clearly that every part of the hemp plant is banned except for the seeds – this is in accordance with many of the international treaties which the Netherlands have signed. It is for this reason Cannabis cannot be legalised in the Netherlands. Thus, it remains illegal but it is &quot;tolerated.&quot; A recent court decision allowed a medical cannabis  to avoid legal prosecution for possession of a small number of cannabis plants; however, the state is appealing the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2006/10/state_to_appeal_medical_cannab.php|publisher=[http://www.dutchnews.nl/ DutchNews.nl]|date=2007-03-21|accessdate=2007-03-21|title=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2009, 27 ''coffee shops'' selling cannabis in [[Rotterdam]], [[Netherlands]], all within 250 meters from schools must close down. This is nearly half of the coffeeshops that currently operate within its municipality. This is due to a new policy of city mayor Ivo Opstelten and the town council as a result of increased use of ''soft drugs'' among pupils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=View all comments that have been posted about this article. |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/22/AR2007062202015_pf.html |title=Washington Post Changing Patterns in Social Fabric Test Netherlands |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2007-06-22 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsevier.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/asp/artnr/160710/rss/true/index.html |title=Rotterdamse gemeente doekt 27 coffeeshops |publisher=Elsevier.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although outdoor use is prohibited this is also &quot;tolerated&quot; in most places.
Since January 2006 certain areas in the district &quot;De Baarsjes&quot; in [[Amsterdam]] have been declared official cannabis-free zones because of nuisance to inhabitants of the areas.
A special road sign was chosen out of 3 designs by [[Hans Bos]] to designate the areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nieuwsuitamsterdam.nl/afbeeldingen/blowverbod.JPG ]{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This sign is not a recognized traffic sign however as it is not used outside of Amsterdam.  For a while the municipality of Amsterdam sold the signs &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dutchamsterdam.nl/57-amsterdam-selling-no-toking-signs |title=Amsterdam selling 'No Toking' signs |publisher=DutchAmsterdam.nl |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to curtail theft of traffic sign.

Higher concentrations of [[THC]] and [[drug tourism]] have challenged the current policy and led to a re-examination of the current approach; e.g. ban of all sales of cannabis to tourists in [[Coffeehouse|coffee shop]]s from end of 2011 was proposed but currently only the border city of Maastricht has adopted the measure in order to test out its feasibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15134669 |title=BBC News - Maastricht bans cannabis coffee-shop tourists |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-10-01 |accessdate=2011-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2011 decided the government that, starting in 2012, each coffee shop must operate like a private club with some 1,000 to 1,500 members. In order to qualify for a membership card, applicants have to be adult Dutch resident, membership will only to be allowed in one club.&lt;ref name=&quot;theatlanticwire&quot;&gt;{{cite news

===New Zealand===
{{Main|Cannabis in New Zealand}}
Possession of cannabis is illegal in New Zealand and can result in a fine of up to $500 or even a 3-month prison sentence (though the latter is rarely used). Anyone caught in possession of more than 28&amp;nbsp;grams of cannabis or 100 cannabis joints is classed as a dealer unless s/he can prove they are not. Cannabis is a class C drug in [[New Zealand]], of which the penalty for dealing can result in a maximum prison sentence of 8 years under the New Zealand [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1975]].  There have been many public campaigns to decriminalise cannabis but so far none have succeeded.

===Norway===
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
Any consumption, possession, buying or selling of cannabis is prohibited by law in Norway. Possession of up to 15&amp;nbsp;grams of cannabis will be punished by fines and anything above 15&amp;nbsp;grams can be punished by jail. Jail penalties may vary due to the amount of cannabis involved but they range from 6 months to 21 years.

There have recently been some political discussion whether or not to decriminalize marijuana, but so far (as of September 2011), only two political parties, the youth rally of the party Venstre (a liberal party) (the party itself  states  decriminalization) and The Greens state legalization or decriminalization as a goal. The political parties themselves are often internally split on this matter.

===Peru===
In Peru usage of marijuana and possession of up to 8&amp;nbsp;grams is legal if no other drugs are carried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druglawreform.info/en/country-information/peru/item/207-peru|title=Peru|publisher=Drug Law Reform in Latin America|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland===

Cannabis is a controlled substance in Poland and its possession remains a criminal offence which can be
punished with imprisonment up to 3 years, or up to 8 years if the quantity in possession is considered 'large'
upon current law. No specific measurements are given to determine if an amount is to be considered 'small' or
'large'. Cultivation is also illegal and is threatened with up to 3 years of imprisonment and up to 8 years if
considered 'large'.
On 1st April 2011, the Polish parliament passed an amendment to the 2005 'Ustawa o przeciwdziałaniu narkomanii'
(&quot;Drug-dependence Counteract Law&quot;) to create a possibility of dropping prosecution for possession of small amounts
of drugs for personal use. The law introduces the possibility when a person caught possesses negligible amounts of
drugs for personal use only and the 'social harmfulness' of the case is considered to be low (i.e.-negligible).
Nonetheless the &quot;small amounts&quot; are still undetermined and a temporary detention and house search by the police continues to apply
in virtually every case.
At the same time the reformed law raised the maximum applicable penalties for possession of large amounts of
controlled substances (including cannabis) from 8 to 10 years of imprisonment and from 10 to 12 years for trafficking
of large amounts of controlled substances, among other related crimes. This implies hardening the law without
eliminating the ambiguous terms 'small amounts'/'large amounts'.
These amendments entered into legal force on 8th December 2011.

===Portugal===
Personal consumption of cannabis is limited in the range of 2.5&amp;nbsp;gram marijuana, 0.5&amp;nbsp;gram hashish and 0.25 of hash oil per day. One may possess no more than 10 daily doses, otherwise it may be categorized as trafficking. The consumption still entails a penalty and fine. Cultivation however, is still completely illegal and even cultivation of a single plant is assumed to indicate involvement with trafficking. Possession of seeds is also illegal and despite there being several &quot;[[head shop]]s&quot; or &quot;[[grow shop]]s&quot; in Portugal, they, too, are forbidden to market cannabis seeds. At the same time, the number of grow shops has increased over the past few years, which seems to indicate that cultivation for personal use (in Portuguese: auto-cultivo) is becoming a more common practice. The 2006 [[Global Marijuana March]] ({{lang-pt|Marcha Global da Marijuana}}) was celebrated for the first time in Lisbon and in 2007 both Lisbon and Porto celebrated it.

===Romania===
[[Romania]] is a leader in hemp fiber, second only to China. However, possession of any quantity is punishable by law. Marijuana is considered high risk drug.
Law no. 143/2000 on combating illicit drug trafficking and use.
Chapter II sanctioning illicit trafficking and other operations with controlled substances national
Article 4. Cultivation, production, manufacture, testing, extraction, preparation, processing, purchase or possession of drugs for personal use, without law, shall be punished with imprisonment for 2–5 years. Decriminalization is proposed, but it doesn't have any political support (only 2 politicians are public known to be pro-[[decriminalization]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antena3.ro/stiri/politica/raport-prezidential-pentru-eba-comisia-lui-basescu-propune-dezincriminarea-consumului-de-droguri_80829.html |title=Raport pentru EBA: Comisia prezidenţială susţine dezincriminarea consumului de droguri şi sexul comercial |publisher=Antena3.ro |date=2009-09-22 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The media is totally against any kind of [[pro-marijuana]] manifestations and therefore has a big impact on the population, as most of the mid-age and elderly people cannot distinguish between soft and hard [[drugs]]. The possession of seeds is not banned by law (it is not illegal, but neither legal), but if caught possessing seeds, they are usually confiscated without any other consequence.
[[Hashish]] is considered a high-risk drug, therefore even the possession of very small quantities is usually punished with jail time.

===Russia===
Possession of up to 6&amp;nbsp;grams (dry weight) of cannabis or 2&amp;nbsp;grams of hashish is punishable by fine 4000-5000 roubles or administrative detention of up to 15 days (KoAP 6.8). Possession of more than this amount is punishable by prison term (UK 228). Growing more than 20 plants is punishable by prison term (UK 231).

Consumption is not criminalized, punishable, or technically subject to fining. In practice carrying any amount of illegal drugs is considering in court as &quot;transfer&quot; and is punishable by 4 to 8 years of imprisonment (UK 228.1). However, &quot;intoxicated in public&quot; fines (approximately $10) can be and are applied to those visibly under influence in public places. Note that, for intoxication in public fines to be applied, the offending substance does not have to be identified (or illegal, for that matter), and the fine is applied for being in a state of influence that is a potential or actual public nuisance, not for the fact of consumption.

===South Africa===
The use, possession, cultivation and supply of cannabis remains illegal in the Republic of South Africa. South Africa was the first country to enact anti-cannabis legislation at the turn of the 20th century in 1908. NORML ZA (the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws in South Africa) is currently the largest cannabis advocacy group and claims to represent the country's estimated 2-3 million regular cannabis users. &quot;The Dagga Couple&quot; are gaining prominence for their bid to have cannabis 're-legalized' in the country's Constitutional Court. They have launched a nationwide campaign aimed at educating the public about the real reasons as to why cannabis was made illegal and why these laws should be overturned. The Dagga Couple are also producing a blueprint, which will indicate how the government could go about regulating a cannabis market in the event that it should be legalized&lt;ref&gt;http://daggacouple.co.za/ Official website of The Dagga Couple&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.norml.org.za/ Official website of NORML ZA&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spain===
In Spain the possession and use of cannabis in public places is classed as a misdemeanour under public health laws and is punishable by fines and confiscation. Trafficking is a criminal offense.

One can be denounced for doing so by neighbors or ill-wishers, and the burden is then effectively on the user or grower to prove that the material is for personal use only. {{verify credibility|date=May 2012}}

In recent years a number of members' associations have been established throughout the country in an attempt to extend the boundary of the Spanish citizen's constitutional rights. In an association cannabis is grown and shared among the members. The association may not promote or be seen to encourage the use of cannabis and it must be a closed group for existing adult consumers only, distributing only small amounts regularly to each member (typically 10&amp;nbsp;grams per week) so as to prevent the possibility of trafficking. As well as a membership fee, members must pay for what they consume and prices may not be much different than on the black market.

Where the associations have come under legal challenge they have been able to surmount this, and in at least one case have secured the return of several kilos of confiscated plants. The umbrella group for cannabis associations in Spain is the Federación de Asociaciones Cannábicas: http://www.fac.cc/ and Politic Group:RCN-NOK Representacion Cannabica de Navarra: http://www.rcnavarra.org/

However, the autonomous [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]] in the northern region of Spain has announced it is to legalise the sale and cultivation of cannabis to persons over the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tokeofthetown.com/2011/12/spanish_basque_country_legalizing_marijuana_in_201.php?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=tumblr |title=Spanish Basque Country Legalizing Marijuana In 2012 - Toke of the Town - cannabis news, views, rumor and humor |publisher=Toke of the Town |date=2011-12-13 |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sweden===
{{See also|Drug policy of Sweden}}

====Swedish Cannabis Law====
{{POV|date=September 2012}}
It is illegal to purchase, possess, sell, transfer or consume any amount of cannabis in Sweden. If police suspect someone has consumed cannabis they could be ordered to take a [[drug test]], which is seen as a way to prove consumption. Minor offenses, such as simple consumption generally renders a 30 [[day-fine]] (a day-fine is currently between 50 to 1000 [[Swedish krona|SEK]], depending on salary) while possession and even occasional cultivation of plants for personal use attracts higher fines (up to 150 day-fines) as long as they are under the threshold for minor drug offenses.&lt;ref name=&quot;rpm&quot;&gt;[http://www.aklagare.se/PageFiles/6043/R%C3%A4ttsPM%202011_10%20Narkotika%20preparatbeskrivning.pdf RättsPM 2011:10] ''Åklagarmyndighetens Utvecklngscentrum'' December, 2011 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the purchase, smuggling and possession of larger amounts, organized cultivation or sale, the punishments range from 6 months to 10 years imprisonment&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notisum.se/rnp/SLS/lag/19680064.htm Narkotikastrafflagen] (1968:64) {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notisum.se/rnp/SLS/LAG/20001225.htm Lag om straff för smuggling] (2000:1225) {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined sentence can be even longer, for example when a series of crimes are added up into one sentence. Depending on the circumstances 14 or 18 years is the maximum penalty before limitation rules set in.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notisum.se/rnp/SLS/LAG/19620700.htm Brottsbalken] (1962:700) Kapitel 26 {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dn.se/nyheter/sverige/14-ars-fangelse-for-cannabissmuggling &quot;14 års fängelse för cannabissmuggling&quot;] ''Dagens Nyheter'' July 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Every time reasonable suspicion arises, the police are obliged to intervene under a zero tolerance strategy even though mere police intuition is legally insufficient. The expressed aim of government is the creation of a &quot;''drug-free society''&quot; and the police are to give high priority towards drug crimes. However, as a condition of largely being a [[victimless crime]], the police's own efforts are essential to apprehend cannabis offenders. That is, as opposed to many other crimes where a victim will report it to the police, they must apprehend the drug users and more advanced criminals for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Cannabis seeds are not legally classified as cannabis and mere possession of seeds is not illegal. 

Growing cannabis for industrial use is legal for farmers with at least 4 ha land if the grower has applied for area-based support for the crop and grows EU certified seeds(low % of THC).&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32003R1782:EN:HTML Council Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003] {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://lagen.nu/1992:1554 Förordning (1992:1554) om kontroll av narkotika] {{sv icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the exemption of [[Khat]], Cannabis has the least ''penal value'' per effective dose.&lt;ref name=&quot;rpm&quot; /&gt; Even with the general exemption for drug offences, among juveniles this is of special priority regardless of what drugs are involved. When juveniles are apprehended, the police are obliged to report the young user to the municipal [[Social work|social care]]. Although the charges often are [[Nolle prosequi|dropped]] in consideration of their youth, the social service may then take various measures ranging from just talking to the adolescent and their parents to placing the delinquent in [[Involuntary treatment|forced treatment]] for substance abuse.

In 2011 the Swedish government has given 48 MSEK (6 million USD) extra to a campaign against smoking of cannabis among young men in the biggest cities. What this budget will entail is still under debate but it is administrated by other authorities than the Police.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tidningarnas Telegrambyrå|TT]] [http://www.gp.se/nyheter/sverige/1.677297-miljonkampanj-mot-cannabis &quot;Miljonkampanj mot cannabis&quot;] ''Göteborgs Posten'' July 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===

{{Main|Cannabis in Switzerland}}
As of 1/1/12 home grown cannabis is legal up to 4 plants each. The sale of cannabis is illegal.
Cannabis is classified as an illegal narcotic in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/812_121/a8.html Art. 8 par. 1 lit. d] of the Federal Narcotics Law&lt;/ref&gt; The production and sale of illegal narcotics is punishable by a monetary penalty or by imprisonment of up to three years, as are public incitements to the consumption of illegal narcotics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/sr/812_121/a19.html Art. 19] of the Federal Narcotics Law&lt;/ref&gt;

The enforcement of the prohibition on cannabis is spotty, because around 500,000 Swiss people are believed to use cannabis regularly or occasionally. In a health poll conducted in 1997, 7% of people aged 15 to 39 stated that they were currently consuming cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;See the message to Parliament accompanying the government's decriminalization proposal; Federal Official Journal (BBl/FO) [http://www.admin.ch/ch/d/ff/2001/index0_32.html 2001 3715], p. 3719/21&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 1998, some 250 [[hectares]] of land were used in Switzerland to grow cannabis,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bag.admin.ch/shop/00033/00097/index.html?lang=de 1999 Cannabis Report]{{dead link|date=December 2011}} of the Federal Narcotics Commission, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; yielding more than 100 tons of cannabis per year.&lt;ref&gt;Id. at 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The product is sold mostly on the street and (in &quot;[[scent bag]]s&quot; or covertly) through &quot;cannabis shops&quot; clustered in the urban centers.

Breaking News: [16.11.2011]
Cannabis plants can flourish freely in the lounge or on the balcony of individuals, provided they are four in number, and they are not marketed. This authorization derives from Latin Concordat on culture and commerce of hemp, which was ratified this year by the cantons of Vaud, Neuchâtel, Geneva and Fribourg. The Jura, Valais and Ticino, have yet to decide.
This text, which should come into force on 1 January 2012, aims to harmonize the regulation of culture and commerce of hemp in the different cantons. As noted in today's Le Matin, the heads of the Departments of Justice and Police also hope that this arrangement will play a preventive role.

&quot;Avoiding anarchy&quot;
&quot;This is a regulation to prevent anarchy and tourism between the cantons,&quot; said State Councilor Jean Studer Neuchâtel in the daily Romand.

Thus, each person who wishes to grow more than four plants has an obligation to announce it to the competent authorities in order to receive authorization. In addition, recent reserve the right to control nuisance, including homes.
If the text has attracted the majority of speaking cantons, the Valais. In The Morning Rothen Michel, president of the PDC of Valais, said that his party will oppose the ratification of the Concordat, discussed today at the Grand Council of Valais. &quot;We have always been against the decriminalization of consumption, we can not accept that the law allows each to grow four plants of hemp home.&quot;

===Syria===
Under the laws of the government of [[Bashar al-Assad]], cannabis use carries harsh penalties, up to life imprisonment. However, in some [[Kurds|Kurdish]] areas [[2012 Syrian Kurdistan campaign|cleared of government forces]] during the [[Syrian civil war]], cannabis cultivation has emerged as a common way of earning income in the war-torn region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rudaw.net/english/news/syria/5123.html|title=Poverty Leading to Marijuana Farms in Kobane|last=Ahmad|first=Rozh|date=24 August 2012|work=Rudaw|accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
The THC-containing cannabis is totally forbidden in Turkey. Persons carrying less than 12.5&amp;nbsp;grams of cannabis are required to attend rehab once a week and are subjected to mandatory drug screenings for a six month period if it is a first time offense. If it is not, the punishment is one year of prison. Drug trafficking is punished with long term imprisonment.

Cannabis is illegal in the United Kingdom but punishments are usually minor, resulting in a confiscation and a &quot;cannabis warning&quot; for small amounts. A record of the warning is retained on police information databases for intelligence purposes (effectively so the police can check to see if someone has previously been given a warning) and a crime is recorded under the Home Office Counting Rules but this is not disclosable to third parties. A cannabis warning will not show up on a CRB check, though a police caution for cannabis possession would do (which is usually the next step if someone already with a warning is caught and arrested). Technically there is nothing to prevent the police from giving an individual with personal use amounts of cannabis repeated cannabis warnings, but most forces operate along guidelines that if someone has been caught once (sometimes twice) within a 12 month period then they are arrested if caught again. Cannabis warnings can only be given to persons aged 18 and over. Due to international agreements the UK is signatory to, the cannabis warning process could not be extended to those under 18, who have to either be dealt with unofficially by confiscation and parental disclosure or by means of arrest.

In 1928: Cannabis became illegal in the United Kingdom as a class B drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Independent Drug Monitoring Unit |url=http://www.idmu.co.uk/historical.htm |title=How Cannabis was Criminalised &amp;#124; Cannabis Information |publisher=Idmu.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the government commissioned a study into the effects of downgrading cannabis from a [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971|class B]] to a [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971|class C]].

In November 2009: [[Professor Nutt|Professor David Nutt]] was asked to resign from his position as chairman of the Government's [[Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs]] by the then [[Home Secretary]] ([[Alan Johnson]]), after publishing in a professional journal figures which indicated that cannabis was less harmful than both alcohol and tobacco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/oct/30/drugs-adviser-david-nutt-sacked | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Government drug adviser David Nutt sacked | first=Mark | last=Tran | date=2009-10-30 | accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other members of the Advisory Council resigned in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=jameshigham says: |url=http://www.economicvoice.com/2716/5002716#axzz0aql8tysw |title=Three more members of the ACMD resign |publisher=The Economic Voice |date=2009-11-11 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Afterwards, discussions were being focused towards imposing a new 'code of conduct'; in order to avoid any similar action in future, rather than of the issue at hand (that being the legality of the plant cannabis itself) also this is not under [[Common law offences]], the basis for [[Statutory law]] in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Committee Office, House of Commons |url=http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmselect/cmsctech/1031/1031we07.htm |title=House of Commons - Science and Technology - Written Evidence |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Federal====
'''Non-medical'''&lt;br&gt;
Colonel Joseph Franklin Siler, MD (1875–1960) U.S. Army, performed the first controlled clinical studies of marijuana use by soldiers.  Siler et al., &quot;Marihuana Smoking in Panama,&quot; The Military Surgeon, 73: 269-280, 1933.

Cannabis is classified as a [[List of Schedule I drugs|Schedule I drug]] under the federal [[Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970|Controlled Substances Act of 1970]] and is deemed to have a high potential for abuse and no legitimate medical uses. As such, it prohibits the possession, usage, purchase, sale, and/or cultivation of marijuana.

[[US Federal Courts]] have interpreted numerous state laws on multiple occasions. The [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled in [[United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Coop]] and [[Gonzales v. Raich]] that the federal government has the authority to regulate and criminalize cultivation and distribution of cannabis under the [[interstate commerce clause]], as even purely intrastate sales will affect the market price in other states by altering nationwide [[supply and demand]] patterns.

'''Medical'''&lt;br&gt;
In April 2012, however, the [[Obama Administration]] stated that the [[US Justice Department|Justice Department]] will not crack down on legal [[medical marijuana]] users in states where medical marijuana is permitted. This stance however does not include dispensaries particularly &quot;large-scale producers and operators of marijuana&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tau|first=Byron|title=Obama clarifies his stance on medical marijuana|url=http://www.politico.com/politico44/2012/04/obama-clarifies-his-stance-on-medical-marijuana-121598.html|accessdate=20 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://medicalmarijuana.procon.org/sourcefiles/charles-oberly-delaware-medical-marijuana.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 California voters passed Proposition 215, later renamed the [[California Proposition 215 (1996)|Compassionate Use Act]], by means of popular [[initiative]]. It allows patients with a valid doctor's recommendation, and the patient's designated Primary Caregivers, to possess and cultivate marijuana for personal medical use, and has since been expanded to protect a growing system of collective and cooperative distribution. It was the first such law in the nation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Pot Book: A Complete Guide to Cannabis: Its Role in Medicine, Polititcs, Science, and Culture|page=463|first=Julie|last=Holland|isbn=978-1-59477-368-6|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MQql_gt2QEgC&amp;pg=PA463|date=2010-09-23|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

California state [[common law]] has interpreted the initiative on multiple occasions. In 2007 the courts upheld a decision of a trial court in ''City of Garden Grove v. Superior Court'' to &quot;[order] the Garden Grove Police Department to give [Felix Kha] back his marijuana&quot; because &quot;it is not the job of local police to enforce the federal drug law&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=California Court Decisively Rules State Medical Marijuana Law Trumps Federal Law|publisher=[[Americans For Safe Access]]|work=Cannabis Culture Magazine|url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/articles/5124.html|date=1 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants= City of Garden Grove v.

In California there are designated shops for people who are permitted by law to purchase and use marijuana.  Today there are even marijuana bakeries that make a wide variety of treats that range from chocolate bars to foods such as nachos and baked goods. These shops are made for people who have illnesses which allow them to purchase medical marijuana to go to if they do not wish to smoke in order to get the needed marijuana into their system.

However, California is not the only state that has legalized cannabis for medical use. 16 states and the District of Columbia have also legalized it for medical purposes. Besides California, the other states that have legalized marijuana for medical purposes are Arizona, Alaska, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, Montana, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and Washington.

====Proposals====
Back in 1972, during the presidential campaign, Democratic candidate George McGovern made a bold move to legalize marihuana.&lt;ref name=&quot;dies&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/george-s-mcgovern-democratic-nominee-who-lost-to-nixon-in-72-dies-at-90/2012/10/21/1db1dda8-c5db-11df-94e1-c5afa35a9e59_story.html |title=McGovern dies|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|date=21-10-2012|author=Patricia Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2009, [[California]] state representative [[Tom Ammiano]] introduced [[Marijuana Control, Regulation, and Education Act|a bill]], titled [[Marijuana Control, Regulation, and Education Act]], to legalize, regulate, and tax the recreational use of cannabis in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/02/28/BA00165VB9.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Three questions for: Tom Ammiano | date=2009-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Wall Street Journal, Ammiano, a Democrat, estimates that marijuana legalization &quot;would generate more than $1 billion annually for the cash-strapped state&quot;. Currently, marijuana is California's biggest cash crop, with annual sales reaching $14
billion. The bill &quot;proposes a tax of $50 on an ounce of marijuana, which sells for a few hundred dollars on the street&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj-california&quot;&gt;Woo, Stu. “California Legislature Sees Benefit in Legalizing Pot.” The Wall Street Journal Feb. 2009. http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123552248140364907.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16, 2009, a pair of bills (House Bill 2929 and Senate Bill 1801) were introduced into the [[Massachusetts]] legislature. Its stated objectives are &quot;the reduction of cannabis abuse, the elimination of marijuana-related crime and the raising of public revenue.&quot; The bill proposes an [[excise]] on all cannabis sold that would range from $150 per ounce to $250 per ounce depending on the levels of THC present.&lt;ref name='Mass 2009-01-16'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/legis/bills/house/186/ht02/ht02929.htm |title= An Act to regulate and tax the cannabis industry |accessdate=2009-07-27 |last=Evans |first=Richard |date=2009-01-16 |publisher=[[The Commonwealth of Massachusetts]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple attempts at rescheduling cannabis at a federal level have failed in the past.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} In June 2009, the [[Personal Use of Marijuana by Responsible Adults Act of 2009]] was introduced into the [[US House of Representatives]] by [[Barney Frank]] co-sponsored by [[Ron Paul]] and three other congressmen. If enacted, the bill &quot;would eliminate federal penalties for the personal possession of up to 100 grams (over three and one-half ounces)&quot;. This would effectively leave the legality of cannabis possession for states to decide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.norml.org/2009/06/18/lawmakers-call-for-an-end-to-federal-marijuana-prosecutions/ |title=Lawmakers Call For An End To Federal Marijuana Prosecutions &amp;#124; NORML Blog, Marijuana Law Reform |publisher=Blog.norml.org |date=2009-06-18 |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Debate====
[[File:NORMLprotesting-07-04-00.JPG|thumb|left|200px|National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws protesters at July 4th protest.]]
A majority of Americans (56%) are in favor of marijuana legalization, believing that marijuana should be regulated in a way similar to tobacco and cigarettes, and that it should not be a criminal offense to consume marijuana in the home, based on a national survey of 1,000 citizens of voting age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/lifestyle/general_lifestyle/may_2012/56_favor_legalizing_regulating_marijuana 56% Favor Legalizing, Regulating Marijuana] [[Rasmussen Reports]] Thursday, May 17, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  A September 2009 article in ''[[Fortune Magazine]]'' notes that [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]’s stance regarding marijuana, expressed by the U.S. Attorney General’s Office. The U.S. Attorney General, has all but decriminalized its use in the United States. Eric Holder, confirmed at a press conference that his Office would no longer subject individuals who were complying with state medical marijuana laws to federal drug raids and prosecutions. However, these raids are still taking place as of 2012 and marijuana use is not even close to being decriminalized. The article likens Obama’s policy toward marijuana, in terms of its eventual outcome, to the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twenty-First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution]], which repealed the federal prohibition on alcoholic beverage sales.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Parloff (September 11, 2009). Marijuana may be legalized in the next one to three years.

: ''&quot;I think we consume far more dangerous drugs that are legal: cigarette smoking, nicotine and alcohol,&quot;'' said Joycelyn Elders, the former surgeon general and a supporter of the measure.

===Uruguay===
Uruguayan law and government agree that drug use should be considered a complex multifactorial issue. The law does not consider the user or consumer as the problem. Drug consumption is legal and is not criminalized in Uruguay. As of April 26, 2011, Cannabis is legal to grow in small amounts for home consumption. The law prohibits traffic, distribution, and production of drugs. Police acts are generally oriented towards the reduction of large-scale drug trafficking. The state takes a public health approach in regards to the population of users or potential users. These include offering free healthcare services at public events where drug consumption is likely to occur (e.g., rock concerts) and voluntary rehabilitation services. Policy is based on epidemiological evidence regarding demonstrable public harm. Thus, government efforts over the past decade to reduce drug consumption have been largely oriented towards tobacco and alcohol, and more recently coca-paste.

In June 2012, the Uruguayan government presided by [[José Mujica]] announced plans to legalize state-controlled sales of marijuana in order to fight drug-related crimes and health issues. The government stated that they will ask global leaders to do the same.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-18529993 Uruguay government aims to legalise marijuana]. ''[[BBC]]''. Retrieved 21 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Time Magazine]] featured an article where it considers that Uruguay's proposal to legalize marijuana sales and make its government the sole seller reflects a growing worldwide urge to find new and less violent solutions to the drug war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://world.time.com/2012/06/26/uruguay-wants-to-legalize-marijuana-sales-should-the-rest-of-the-world-follow/#ixzz1z0z02xqa|title=Should the world follow Uruguay's legalization of marijuana?|date=26 Jun 2012|publisher=Time Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nobel prize winner [[Mario Vargas Llosa]] praised the decision as &quot;courageous&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lr21.com.uy/politica/1046408-vargas-llosa-elogio-%e2%80%9cvalerosa-decision%e2%80%9d-uruguaya-de-legalizar-la-venta-de-marihuana|title=Vargas Llosa praises Uruguayan decision to legalize marihuana|date=2-7-2012|publisher=LR21}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Monocle (lifestyle magazine)|Monocle]]'' magazine expressed its admiration for the bold step taken by President [[José Mujica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monocle.com/monocolumn/2012/08/09/south-americas-unsung-political-hero/|title=South America’s unsung political hero |date=August 9, 2012 |publisher=Monocle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mujica's plan would allow users to cultivate the plant for non-commercial use and grant licenses to professional farmers for larger scale production.

|Death penalty is exercised regularly for drug offenses under Chinese law, often in an annual frenzy corresponding to the ''United Nations' International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug trafficking''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/192/chinakillings.shtml |title=China Celebrates UN Anti-Drug Day With 59 Executions |publisher=Stopthedrugwar.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government does not make precise records public, however Amnesty International estimates that around 500 people are executed there each year for drug offenses. Those executed have typically been convicted of smuggling or trafficking in anything from cannabis to methamphetamine.

|Constitutionality untested, never imposed
|While current U.S. Federal law allows for the punishment of death for those who have extraordinary amounts of the drug (60,000 kilograms or 60,000 plants) or are part of a continuing criminal enterprise in smuggling contraband which nets over $20 million, the United States Supreme Court has held that no crimes other than '''murder''' and '''treason''' can constitutionally carry a death sentence (''[[Coker v. Georgia]]'' and ''[[Kennedy v. Louisiana]]'')

[[Hemp]] is the common name for cannabis and is the English term used when this annual herb is grown for non-drug purposes. These include industrial purposes for which cultivation licenses may be issued in the [[European Union|European Union (EU)]]. When grown for industrial purposes hemp is often called industrial hemp, and a common product is [[fibre]] for use in a variety of different ways. [[Fuel]] is often a by-product of hemp cultivation.

Hemp may be grown also for food (the edible seeds), though in the UK [[Defra]] (the UK's Department for the Environment, Food and the Rural Affairs) will not issue cultivation licenses for this purpose, treating it as a non-food crop, though the seed appears on the UK market as a food product.

In the UK hemp seed and fibre have always been perfectly legal products. Cultivation for non drug purposes was however completely prohibited from 1928 until circa 1998, when [[Home Office]] industrial-purpose licenses became available under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]].

Industrial strains intended for legal use within the EU are bred to comply with regulations limiting THC content to 0.2%. (THC content is a measure of the herb's drug potential and can reach 25% or more in drug strains).
