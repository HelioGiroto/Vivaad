English edition. London, England, UK: Routledge, 1999 pp. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement emphasized the need for a racially &quot;pure&quot; Croatia and promoted persecution and [[genocide]] against [[Serbs]], [[Jews]]{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=351–352}} and [[Romani people]].{{sfn|Fischer|2007|pp=207}} Fiercely nationalistic, the Ustaše were also fanatically [[Roman Catholicism|Catholic]]. In the Yugoslav political context, they identified Catholicism with Croatian nationalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lonely Cold War&quot;&gt;Peter C.

In the Yugoslav political context, they identified Catholicism with Croatian nationalism...''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[Croatian nationalism]], they declared the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Islam|Muslim]] faiths as religions of the [[Croats|Croatian people]]. The Ustaše also saw the Islam of Bosniaks as a religion which &quot;keeps true the blood of Croats.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Butić-Jelić, Fikreta. Ustaše i Nezavisna Država Hrvatska 1941–1945.

The movement functioned as a terrorist organization before [[World War II]],&lt;ref&gt;Der kroatische Ustascha-Staat, pp. 19–27&lt;/ref&gt; but in April 1941, they were appointed to rule a part of [[Axis powers of World War II|Axis]]-occupied [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] as the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (NDH), which has been described as both an Italian-German quasi-protectorate,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=233–241}} and as a [[puppet state]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-1413183/Independent-State-of-Croatia |title=Independent State of Croatia – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005456 Yugoslavia], ''Holocaust Encyclopedia'', United States Holocaust Memorial Museum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761577939_7/Croatia.html#p51 History of Croatia:World War II]&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref name=CRIMES&gt;{{cite book |last=Watch |first=Helsinki |title=War Crimes in Bosnia-Hercegovina |url=http://books.google.com/?id=nltdtAo38K0C&amp;pg=PA14 |accessdate=23 April 2008 |year=1993 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |isbn=978-1-56432-083-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=STATEHOOD&gt;{{cite book |last=Raič |first=David |title=Statehood and the law of self-determination |url=http://books.google.com/?id=L7UOyPGYBkwC&amp;pg=PA81 |accessdate=23 April 2008 |year=2002 |publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers |isbn=978-90-411-1890-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005456 [[USHMM]] about Independent State of Croatia]&lt;/ref&gt; The Ustaše were chiefly responsible for the World War II [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] in the NDH. Around three hundred thousand were killed by the NDH government's racial policies, which condemned all Serbs, Jews and Roma to death in the [[concentration camp]]s, alongside Croat resistance members and political opponents.

When it was founded in 1930,{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=30}} the Ustaše was a nationalist organization that sought to create an independent Croatian state. When the Ustaše came to power in the NDH, a quasi-protectorate established by Fascist Italy and Nazi Germany during [[World War II]], its military wings became the [[Army of the Independent State of Croatia]] and the Ustaše militia ({{lang-hr|Ustaška vojnica}}).&lt;ref&gt;Der kroatische Ustascha-Staat, Die Ustascha an der Macht chapter, pp. 75–80.&lt;/ref&gt; The NDH collaborated with the Italian and German occupation forces in Yugoslavia in fighting an increasingly unsuccessful campaign against the resistance forces, the [[Yugoslav Partisans]], who were recognized in late November 1943 as the military of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] Yugoslav state. As German forces withdrew from Yugoslavia in 1944/1945, the Ustaše mostly left the country, some of them remained in [[SFR Yugoslavia]] as a resistance group known as [[Crusaders (guerilla)|Crusaders]] and large numbers of them were killed without trial by Yugoslav forces (the Partisans) after the end of the war.

== Name ==

The word ''ustaša'' (plural: ''ustaše'') is derived from the intransitive verb ''ustati'' (Croatian for ''rise up'').

&quot;{{lang|hr|Pučki-ustaša}}&quot; ({{lang-de|[[Landsturm]]}}) was a military rank in the [[Imperial Croatian Home Guard]] (1868–1918). The same term was the name of Croatian third-class infantry regiments ({{lang-de|Landsturm regiments}}) during World War One 1914–1918.&lt;ref&gt;See: [[:hr:Pučki-ustaše]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another variation of the word ''ustati'' is ''ustanik'' (plural: ''ustanici'') which means an [[Insurgency|insurgent]], or a rebel. The name ''ustaša'' did not have fascist connotations during their early years in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia as the term &quot;ustat&quot; was itself used in [[Herzegovina]] to denote the insurgents from the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875-1878)|Herzegovinian rebellion]] of 1875.

The full original name of the organization appeared in April 1931 as the ''Ustaša – Hrvatska revolucionarna organizacija'' or UHRO (Ustaša – Croatian revolutionary organization), though in 1933 it was renamed the ''Ustaša – Hrvatski revolucionarni pokret'' (Ustaša – Croatian revolutionary movement) which it kept until World War II.

== Ideology ==

=== Ideological roots ===

One of the major ideological influences of the Croatian nationalism of the Ustaše was 19th century Croatian activist [[Ante Starčević]].{{sfn|Fischer|2007|p=207}} Starčević was an advocate of Croatian unity and independence and was both anti-[[Habsburg]] and anti-Serbian.{{sfn|Fischer|2007|p=207}} He envisioned the creation of a [[Greater Croatia]] that would include territories inhabited by [[Bosniaks]], [[Serbs]], and [[Slovenes]], considering Bosniaks and Serbs as Croats who had been converted to [[Islam]] and [[Orthodox Christianity]] while considering the Slovenes &quot;mountain Croats&quot;.{{sfn|Fischer|2007|p=207}} He argued that the large Serb presence in territories claimed by a Greater Croatia was the result of recent settlement, encouraged settlement by Habsburg rulers, and influx of groups like [[Vlachs]] who took up Orthodox Christianity and identified as Serbs.{{sfn|Fischer|2007|pp=207–208}} Starčević declared his admiration for Bosniaks because in his view they were Croats who tactically had adopted Islam to preserve the economic and political autonomy of Bosnia and medieval Croatia under the [[Ottoman Empire]].{{sfn|Fischer|2007|p=208}}

[[File:Mussolini and Pavelic 1941.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Poglavnik]]'' [[Ante Pavelic]] and Italy's ''[[Duce]]'' [[Benito Mussolini]] on 18 May 1941 in [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. The Ustaše were heavily influenced by Italian Fascism and politically supported by Fascist Italy.]]

The Ustaše used Starčević's theories to promote the annexation of [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]] to Croatia and recognized Croatia as having two major ethnocultural components: Catholic Croats and Muslim Croats.{{sfn|Fischer|2007|p=208}} The Ustaše deliberately sought to represent Starčević as being connected to their views, and falsely asserted that Starčević, as a [[Liberalism|liberal]], never supported human equality or women's equality while portraying him as a racist.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=117}}

The Ustaše promoted the theories of Dr. [[Milan Šufflay]] who is believed to have claimed that Croatia had been &quot;one of the strongest ramparts of Western civilization for many centuries&quot; that he claimed had been lost with its union with Serbia in Yugoslavia in 1918.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=118}} Šufflay himself had been murdered in Yugoslavia in 1931, allegedly by proponents of the regime, causing an internationally publicized affair.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT04.06.31&quot;&gt;''[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F0091EFB345C157A93C4A9178ED85F458385F9&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=sufflay%20einstein&amp;st=cse Einstein accuses Yugoslavian rulers in savant's murder]'', [[New York Times]]. 6 May 1931.  [http://crostamps.com/nyt/nyt.htm mirror]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RaditchTimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10A17F63C591B728DDDAA0A94D0405B818FF1D3&amp;scp=4&amp;sq=Sufflay&amp;st=cse | title = Raditch left tale of Yugoslav plot | publisher = New York Times | date = 23 August 1931 | accessdate =6 December 2008 | page = N2 }} [http://www.croatianhistory.net/etf/raditch.pdf mirror]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip J. Cohen, David Riesman. ''Serbia's Secret War: Propaganda and the Deceit of History''. Texas A&amp;M University Press, 1996, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ustaše utilized the 1935 thesis by Reverend [[Krunoslav Draganović]], which claimed that many Roman Catholics in southern Herzegovina had been converted to Orthodox Christianity in the 16th and 17th centuries, to justify a policy of forced conversion of Orthodox Christians in the area to Roman Catholicism.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=126}}

The Ustaše were heavily influenced by [[Italian Fascism]] and [[Nazism]].{{sfn|Fischer|2007|p=207}} Ante Pavelić's position of ''[[Poglavnik]]'' was based on the similar positions of ''[[Duce]]'' held by [[Benito Mussolini]] and ''[[Führer]]'' by [[Adolf Hitler]].{{sfn|Fischer|2007|p=210}} The Ustaše, like fascists, promoted a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Djilas, p. 114&quot;&gt;Djilas, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt;  Pavelić and the Ustaše were allowed sanctuary in Italy by Mussolini after being exiled from Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Fischer|2007|p=210}} Pavelić had been in negotiations with Fascist Italy since 1927 that included advocating a territory-for-sovereignty swap in which he would tolerate Italy annexing its claimed territory in Dalmatia in exchange for Italy supporting the sovereignty of an independent Croatia.{{sfn|Fischer|2007|p=210}}

However Mussolini's support of the Ustaše was based on pragmatic maximization of Italian influence in the Balkans. After 1937 with the weakening of French influence in Europe following Germany's remilitarization of the Rhineland, and with the rise of a quasi-fascist government in Yugoslavia under [[Milan Stojadinović]], Mussolini from 1937 to 1939 abandoned support for the Ustase and sought to improve relations Yugoslavia, as he feared that continued hostility towards Yugoslavia would result in Yugoslavia joining the German sphere of influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;VanCreveld6&quot;&gt;Martin L. Van Creveld. Hitler's Strategy 1940–1941: The Balkan Clue. 2nd edition. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Cambridge University Press, 1974. pp. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; However the collapse of the quasi-fascist Stojadinović regime resulted in Italy restoring its support for the Ustaše and its agenda to promote an independent Croatia broken away from Yugoslavia that was in personal union with Italy.&lt;ref name=&quot;VanCreveld6&quot; /&gt; Distrust towards the Ustase grew, Mussolini's son-in-law Count and Italian foreign minister Count [[Galeazzo Ciano]] noting in his diary that &quot;The Duce is indignant with Pavelić, because he claims that the Croats are descendants of the Goths. This will have the effect of bringing them into the German orbit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Galeazzo Ciano, Malcolm Muggeridge (translator). ''Ciano's diary, 1939–1943''. W. Heinemann, 1950. pp. 392.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nazi Germany initially held no support for an independent Croatia nor the Ustaše and Hitler stressed the importance for a &quot;strong and united Yugoslavia&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;VanCreveld78&quot;&gt;Martin L. Van Creveld. Hitler's Strategy 1940–1941: The Balkan Clue. 2nd edition. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Cambridge University Press, 1974. pp. 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nazi officials including [[Hermann Göring]] wanted Yugoslavia to be stable and officially neutral during the war to insure that Germany could continue to securely gain Yugoslavia's raw material exports.&lt;ref name=&quot;VanCreveld78&quot; /&gt; The Nazis also grew aggravated with the Ustase, such as Reichsfuhrer SS [[Heinrich Himmler]] who was dissatisfied with the lack of full compliance by the NDH to the Nazis' agenda of extermination of the Jews, as the Ustaše permitted Jews who converted to Catholicism to be recognized &quot;honourary Croats&quot; and were exempted from persecution.{{sfn|Fischer|2007|pp=226}}

=== Political programme and main agendas ===
In 1933, the Ustaše presented &quot;The Seventeen Principles&quot; that formed the official ideology of the movement. The Principles stated the uniqueness of the Croatian nation, promoted collective rights over individual rights, and declared that people who were not Croat by &quot;[[Heredity|blood]]&quot; would be excluded from political life.{{sfn|Fischer|2007|p=208}} Those peoples considered &quot;undesirables&quot; were subjected to mass murder.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=119}} The Principles called for the creation of a new economic system that would be neither [[Capitalism|capitalist]] nor [[Communism|communist]].{{sfn|Fischer|2007|p=210}} The Principles emphasized the importance of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] and the [[Patriarchy|patriarchial]] family as means to maintain social order and morality.{{sfn|Fischer|2007|p=209}} (The name given by modern historian to this particular aspect of Ustaše ideology varies; &quot;[[national Catholicism]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Payne1996&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Stanley G. Payne|title=A History of Fascism, 1914–1945|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=x_MeR06xqXAC&amp;pg=PA406|year=1996|publisher=University of Wisconsin Pres|isbn=978-0-299-14873-7|page=406}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[political Catholicism]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lampe2004&quot;/&gt; and &quot;Catholic Croatism&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lampe2004&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=John R.

In power, the Ustaše banned [[contraception]] and tightened laws against [[blasphemy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholas Atkin 2003, p. 248&quot;&gt;Nicholas Atkin, Frank Tallet. ''Priests, prelates and people: a history of European Catholicism since 1750''. New York, New York, USA: I. B. Taurus &amp; Co. Ltd., 2003. pp. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Deniker's Races de l'Europe (1899).jpg|thumb|[[Joseph Deniker]]'s map of European races (1899) identified &quot;Dinarics&quot; as the dominant group in parts of [[central Europe]], Northern [[Italy]] and the North West [[Balkans]]. ]]

The Ustase accepted that Croats were part of the [[Dinaric race]],&lt;ref name=&quot;CaccamoTrinchese&quot;&gt;Caccamo Trinchese. Rotte adriatiche. Tra Italia, Balcani e Mediterraneo. FrancoAngeli, 2011. pp. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; but rejected the concept that Croats were primarily a Slavic people and claimed that Croats were primarily the descendents of the  stronger Germanic roots with the [[Goths]] than Slavic roots.&lt;ref&gt;Rich, Norman (1974). Hitler's War Aims: the Establishment of the New Order, p. 276-7. W. W. Norton &amp; Company Inc., New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ustaše believed that a government must naturally be strong and authoritarian.&lt;ref name=&quot;Djilas, p. 114&quot; /&gt; The movement opposed [[parliamentary democracy]] for being &quot;corrupt&quot; and [[Marxism]] and [[Bolshevism]] for interfering in family life and the economy and for their [[materialism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Djilas, p. 114&quot; /&gt; The movement considered political institutions such as political parties and parliaments to be harmful and unnatural.&lt;ref&gt;Djilas, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ustaše recognized both Roman Catholicism and [[Islam]] as the national religions of the Croatian people but initially rejected [[Orthodox Christianity]] as being incompatible with their objectives.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=118}} Though the Ustase emphasized religious themes, it stressed that duty to the nation took precedence over religious custom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greble125&quot;&gt;Emily Greble. ''Sarajevo, 1941–1945: Muslims, Christians, and Jews in Hitler's Europe''. Ithaca, New York, USA: Cornell University Press, 2011. pp. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ustaše in power banned the use of the expression of &quot;Serbian Orthodox faith&quot; and mandated the use of the expression &quot;Greek-Eastern faith&quot; in its place.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=119}} The Ustaše persecuted &quot;Old Catholics&quot; who did not recognize [[papal infallibility]].{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=119}} Orthodox Christian churches were closed, destroyed, or plundered during Ustaše rule.{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=119}} The Ustaše altered their stance towards the Orthodox faith in August 1941 when the NDH allowed those Orthodox Serbs who held no political association with Serbia to be permitted to attain Croatian citizenship and be declared an Aryan person.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greble125&quot; /&gt; On 2 July 1942 the [[Croatian Orthodox Church]] was founded, and Orthodoxy thus became one of Croatia's state religions.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=546}} The Ustaše attached conditions to citizenship of people of Islamic faith, such as asserting that a Muslim who supported Yugoslavia would not be considered a Croat, nor a citizen but a &quot;Muslim Serb&quot; who could be denied property and imprisoned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greble125&quot; /&gt; The Ustase claimed that such &quot;Muslim Serbs&quot; had to earn Croat status.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greble125&quot; /&gt;

The Ustaše persecuted Jews who practiced [[Judaism]] but it authorized Jewish converts to Catholicism to be recognized as Croatian citizens and be given honourary Aryan citizenship that allowed them to be reinstated in their jobs that they had lost due to their previous practice of Judaism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greble125&quot; /&gt;

In economics, the Ustaše supported the creation of a [[Corporatism|corporatist]] economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Djilas, p. 114&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholas Atkin 2003, p. 248&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roger Griffin.

=== Before World War II ===

[[File:Velika Hrvatska (Hrvatski Domobran).jpg|thumb|300px|Map of a [[Greater Croatia]] in a 1939 article of the Ustaše ''Hrvatski Domobran'' newspaper associated with the Ustase organization of the same name, ''[[Hrvatski Domobran]]'', that sought recruitment of Croat [[emigres]] in Argentina and other countries. This article rejects the [[Cvetković–Maček Agreement]] and the borders that it provided to Croatia as insufficient.]]

In October 1928, after the assassination of leading Croatian politician [[Stjepan Radić]], [[Croatian Peasant Party]] President in the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Assembly]] by radical Montenegrin politician [[Puniša Račić]], a youth group named the Croat Youth Movement was founded by [[Branimir Jelić]] at the [[University of Zagreb]]. A year later, [[Ante Pavelić]] was invited by the 21-year-old Jelić into the organization as a junior member. A related movement, the Domobranski Pokret, which had been the name of the legal Croatian army in [[Austria-Hungary]], began publication of ''Hrvatski Domobran'', a newspaper dedicated to Croatian national matters. The Ustase sent ''Hrvatski Domobran'' to the [[United States]] to garner support for the Ustase from [[Croatian Americans]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kivisto. ''The Ethnic enigma: the salience of ethnicity for European-origin groups''. Cranbury, New Jersey, USA; London, England, UK; Mississauga, Ontario, Canada: Associated University Press, 1989. pp. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The organization around the Domobran tried to engage with and radicalize moderate Croats, using Radić’s murder to stir up emotions in the country. By 1929, however, two divergent political streams had formed within Croatia: some supported the Pavelić view that only violence could secure Croatia's national interests; however, the Croatian Peasant Party, led then by [[Vladko Maček]], successor to Stjepan Radić, had much greater support among Croats.&lt;ref&gt;Djilas, Aleksa. The contested country: Yugoslav unity and communist revolution, 1919–1953, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

Various members of the [[Party of Rights (1861–1929)|Croatian Party of Rights]] contributed to the writing of the ''Domobran'', until around Christmas 1928 when the newspaper was banned by the authorities of the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]]. In January 1929, the King banned all national parties,&lt;ref&gt;Jović, Dejan. Yugoslavia: a state that withered away, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; and the radical wing of the Party of Rights was exiled, among them Ante Pavelić, Gustav Perčec and Branimir Jelić. This group was later joined by several other Croatian exiles.

On 20 April 1929, Pavelić and others co-signed a declaration in [[Sofia]], [[Bulgaria]] together with members of the [[Macedonians (Bulgarians)|Macedonia]]n National Committee, asserting that they would pursue &quot;their legal activities for the establishment of human and national rights, political freedom and complete independence for both Croatia and Macedonia&quot;. Due to this, the Court for the Preservation of the State in [[Belgrade]] sentenced Pavelić and Perčec to death on 17 July 1929. The exiles started organizing support for their cause among the [[Croatian diaspora]] in Europe, North and South America. In January 1932, they named their revolutionary organization &quot;Ustaša&quot;. In November 1932, ten Ustaše led by [[Andrija Artuković]], supported by four local sympathisers, attacked a gendarme outpost at Brušani in the [[Lika]]/[[Velebit]] area. The goal of attack was to scare Yugoslav authorities. The incident has sometimes been termed the [[Velebit Uprising]].

[[File:1934-10-17 King Alexander Assassination.ogv|thumb|left|150px|[[Universal Newsreel]]'s film about the assassination.]]

One of the most important actions of Ustaše was assassination of Yugoslav king [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|Alexander I]]. Organizer of assassination was [[Eugen Dido Kvaternik]] while assassin was [[Vlado Chernozemski]], member of the [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization]] (IMRO). Soon after the assassination, all organizations related to the Ustaše as well as the Hrvatski Domobran, which continued as a civil organization, were banned throughout Europe. Pavelić and Kvaternik were detained in Italy from October 1934 until the end of March 1936. After March 1937, when Italy and Yugoslavia signed a pact of friendship, Ustaše and their activities were banned.

However, not only did these events fail to destroy the Ustaša organization, but it even attracted sympathizers among the Croatian youth, especially among university students. In February 1939, two of these returnees, [[Mile Budak]] and Ivan Oršanić, became editors of the newly published magazine ''Hrvatski narod'' (&quot;The Croatian nation&quot;), which supported the Ustaše ideas of Croatian independence.

=== World War II ===

The [[Axis Powers]] [[Invasion of Yugoslavia|invaded Yugoslavia]] on 6 April 1941. Vladko Maček, the leader of the Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) which was the most influential party in Croatia at the time, rejected German offers to lead the new government. On 10 April the most senior home-based Ustaša, [[Slavko Kvaternik]], took control of the police in Zagreb and in a radio broadcast that day proclaimed the formation of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] (''Nezavisna Država Hrvatska'', NDH). The name of the state was an attempt to capitalise on the Croat struggle for independence. Maček issued a statement that day, calling on all Croatians to co-operate with the new authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Vladko Maček, ''In the Struggle for Freedom'' (New York: Robert Speller &amp; Sons, 1957) p 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile Pavelić and several hundred Ustaše left their camps in Italy for Zagreb, where Pavelić declared new government on 16 April 1941.{{sfn|Fischer|2007|p={{page needed|date=September 2012}}}} He accorded himself the title of &quot;Poglavnik&quot; — a Croatian approximation to &quot;Führer&quot; and translating to something like &quot;Headman&quot; in English. Independent State of Croatia was declared on Croatian &quot;ethnic and historical territory&quot;{{refn|name=Tomasevich 2001 p466}} what is today [[Croatia|Republic of Croatia]] (without [[Istria]]), [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Syrmia]] and [[Bay of Kotor]]. However, a few days after the declaration of independence, the Ustaše were forced{{sfn|Fischer|2007|p={{page needed|date=September 2012}}}} to sign the [[Treaty of Rome]] where they surrendered part of Dalmatia and [[Krk]], [[Rab]], [[Korčula]], [[Biograd]], [[Šibenik]], [[Split, Croatia|Split]], [[Čiovo]], [[Šolta]], [[Mljet]] and part of [[Konavle]] and [[Bay of Kotor]] in favor of [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]]. ''De facto'' control over this territory varied for the majority of the war, as the Partisans grew more successful, while the Germans and Italians increasingly exercised direct control over areas of interest. The Germans and the Italians split the NDH into two zones of influence, one in the southwest controlled by the Italians and the other in the northeast controlled by the Germans. As a result, the NDH has been described as 'an Italian-German Quasi-Protectorate'.{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|pp=233–302}} In September 1943, after Italian capitulation, the NDH annexed the whole territory which was annexed by Italy according to [[Treaty of Rome]].

=== Ustaše Militia ===

[[File:Chetniks, Ustasa, and Domobrani.jpg|thumb|200px|Meeting in Bosnia between representatives of the [[Chetniks]] and Independent State of Croatia officers (including the Ustaše Militia and the [[Croatian Home Guard (Independent State of Croatia)|Croatian Home Guard]])]]

The [[Army of the Independent State of Croatia]] was composed of enlisted men who did not participate in Ustaše activities. The fanatical Ustaše Militia, however, organised in 1941 into five (later 15) 700-man battalions, two railway security battalions, and the elite Black Legion and Poglavnik Bodyguard Battalion (later Brigade), fought with a merciless tenacity which impressed and appalled friend and foe alike.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas 1995, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 April 1941, a newly formed unit of the Ustaše army killed members of the largely Serbian community of Gudovac, near [[Bjelovar]]. Eventually all who opposed and/or threatened the Ustaše were outlawed. The HSS was banned on 11 June 1941, in an attempt by the Ustaše to take their place as the primary representative of the Croatian peasantry. Vladko Maček was sent to the [[Jasenovac concentration camp]], but later released to serve a [[house arrest]] sentence due to his popularity among the people. Maček was later again called upon by foreigners to take a stand and oppose the Pavelić government, but refused. In early 1941, Jews and Serbs were ordered to leave certain areas of Zagreb&lt;ref name=&quot;ushmm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |year=1941|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/media_ph.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005456&amp;MediaId=2156|title=PHOTOGRAPHY|publisher=Jewish Historical Museum of Yugoslavia|accessdate=3 December 2007 |last= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some were cast into concentration camps and subsequentally killed. For the description of these deportations and the treatment in the camps C.f. Djuro Schwartz, &quot;In the Jasenovac camps of death&quot; (ג'ורו שווארץ, במחנות המוות של יאסנובאץ&quot;, קובץ מחקרים כ&quot;ה, יד-ושם)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pavelić first met with [[Adolf Hitler]] on 6 June 1941. [[Mile Budak]], then a minister in Pavelić's government, publicly proclaimed the violent racial policy of the state on 22 July 1941. [[Maks Luburic|Vjekoslav &quot;Maks&quot; Luburić]], one of the chiefs of the secret police, started building [[concentration camp]]s in the summer of the same year. Ustaše activities in villages across the [[Dinaric Alps]] led to the Italians and the Germans expressing disquiet. According to [[Srđa Trifković]], as early as 10 July 1941, Wehrmacht General [[Edmund Glaise-Horstenau|Edmund Glaise von Horstenau]] reported the following to the German High Command, the [[Oberkommando der Wehrmacht]] (OKW):

{{blockquote|Our troops have to be mute witnesses of such events; it does not reflect well on their otherwise high reputation... I am frequently told that German occupation troops would finally have to intervene against Ustaše crimes. This may happen eventually. Right now, with the available forces, I could not ask for such action. Ad hoc intervention in individual cases could make the German Army look responsible for countless crimes which it could not prevent in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | authorlink = Srđa Trifković | last = Trifković | first = Srđa | title = The Real Genocide in Yugoslavia: Independent Croatia of 1941 Revisited. | date = 21 April 2000 | journal = [[Chronicles (magazine)|Chronicles]] | url = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A [[Geheime Staatspolizei|Gestapo]] report to Reichsführer SS [[Heinrich Himmler]], dated 17 February 1942, stated that:

{{blockquote|Increased activity of the bands [of rebels] is chiefly due to atrocities carried out by Ustaše units in Croatia against the Orthodox population. The Ustaše committed their deeds in a bestial manner not only against males of conscript age, but especially against helpless old people, women and children.

Italian troops in the field had competing territorial claims with their Ustaše allies and had cooperated from the start with [[Chetnik]] units operating in the southern areas that they controlled.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}} Hitler tried to insist that Mussolini should have his forces work with the Ustaše, but senior Italian commanders such as General [[Mario Roatta]] ignored such orders.{{citation needed|date=November 2008}}

[[File:Ustasaguard.jpg|thumb|200px|An Ustaša guard poses among the bodies of prisoners murdered in [[Jasenovac concentration camp]]]]

By the end of 1942, the news about events at Jasenovac and elsewhere had also spread among the Croatian population. Writers [[Vladimir Nazor]] and [[Ivan Goran Kovačić]] escaped from Ustaše-held territory to join the Partisans, and were followed by others.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In September 1942 an Ustaše Defensive Brigade was formed, and during 1943 the Ustaše battalions were re organised into eight four-battalion brigades (1st to 8th).&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 1995, p. 17&quot;&gt;Thomas 1995, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1943, the Germans suffered major losses on the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Eastern Front]] and the [[Armistice between Italy and Allied armed forces|Italians signed an armistice]] with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], leaving behind significant armaments that the Partisans used against the occupiers and the Ustaše.

By 1944 Pavelić was almost totally reliant on Ustaše units, now 100,000 strong, formed in Brigades 1 to 20, Recruit Training Brigades 21 to 24, three divisions, two railway brigades, one defensive brigade and the new Mobile Brigade. In November 1944 the Army was effectively put under Ustaše control when the [[Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia]] were combined with the units of the Ustaše to form eighteen divisions, comprising 13 infantry, two mountain and two assault divisions and one replacement division, each with its own organic artillery and other support units. There were also several armoured units.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas 1995, p. 17&quot; /&gt;

Fighting continued for a short while after the formal surrender of German [[Army Group E]] on 9 May 1945, as Axis forces and many refugees attempted to escape to Austria. The [[Battle of Poljana]], between a mixed German and Ustaše column and a Partisan force, was the last battle of World War II on European soil. Many of those fleeing were handed over to the Yugoslavs on the Austrian border, to be subsequently either executed or sent on a &quot;death march&quot; back into the country, an episode known as the [[Bleiburg tragedy]]. Pavelić, however, with the help of associates among the [[Franciscans]], managed to escape and hide in Austria and Rome, later fleeing to [[Argentina]].

=== After the war ===

After World War II, the remaining Ustaše went underground or fled to countries such as Canada, Australia, Germany and South America, with the assistance of Roman Catholic churches and their grassroots supporters&lt;ref name=&quot;jasenovac-info&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=Decemberlassified 12 September 1983|url=http://www.jasenovac-info.com/cd/biblioteka/pavelicpapers/army/ar0004.html|title=US Army File: Dr. DRAGANOVIC' Krunoslav|publisher=[http://www.jasenovac-info.com jasenovac-info]|accessdate=4 October 2007 |last= |quote= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071008210215/http://www.jasenovac-info.com/cd/biblioteka/pavelicpapers/army/ar0004.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 8 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jasenovac-info&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jasenovac-info2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=Decemberlassified 12 September 1983|url=http://www.jasenovac-info.com/cd/biblioteka/pavelicpapers/pavelic/ap0010.html|title=CIC Memorandum|publisher=[http://www.jasenovac-info.com jasenovac-info]|accessdate=4 October 2007 |last= |quote= |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071008210552/http://www.jasenovac-info.com/cd/biblioteka/pavelicpapers/pavelic/ap0010.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 8 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of them persisted in their crusade against Yugoslavia.

With the defeat of the Independent State of Croatia, the movement ceased to exist. Infighting over the failure to establish a Croatian state also fragmented the surviving Ustaše. Ante Pavelić formed the [[Croatian Liberation Movement]] which drew several of the former state's leaders. [[Vjekoslav Vrančić]] founded a reformed Croatian Liberation Movement, and was its leader. [[Vjekoslav Luburić]] formed the [[Croatian National Resistance]]. Blagoje Jovović, a [[Serbs|Montenegrin Serb]] Chetnik, shot Ante Pavelić near [[Buenos Aires]] on 9 April 1957, inflicting injuries from which he later died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pavelic-papers.com/features/tbfp.html |title=The Leading Pave LIC Papers Site on the Net |publisher=pavelic-papers.com |date= |accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=September 2012}}

The Ustaše aimed to create an ethnically &quot;pure&quot; Croatia, and saw the [[Serbs]] that lived in Croatia, [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]] as their biggest obstacle. Thus, Ustaše ministers [[Mile Budak]], Mirko Puk, and Milovan Žanić declared in May 1941 that the goal of the new Ustaše policy was an ethnically clean Croatia. The strategy to achieve their goal:&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas A.

# One third of the Serbs were to be killed.
# One third of the Serbs were to be expelled (ethnically cleansed).
# One third of the Serbs were to be forcibly converted to [[Roman Catholicism|Catholicism]].

The NDH government cooperated with the Nazi Germany in [[the Holocaust]] and exercised their own version of the [[genocide]] against ethnic Serbs living in their borders. State policy about Serbs has been first declared in words of Milovan Žanić minister of NDH Legislative council on 2 May 1941: &quot;This country can only be Croatian country, and there is no method we would hesitate to use in order to make it truly Croatian and cleanse it of Serbs, who have for centuries endangered us and who will endanger us again if they are given opportunity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategicstudiesinstitute.army.mil/pdffiles/PUB159.pdf |title=Deciphering the Balkan Enigma: Using History to Inform Policy |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ustaše enacted [[Nuremberg Laws|race laws]] patterned after those of the [[Third Reich]], which were aimed against [[Jew]]s and [[Roma (Romani subgroup)|Roma]] and [[Serbs]], who were collectively declared enemies of the Croatian people.&lt;ref&gt;Ante Pavelic and the Ustasa State in Croatia by John K Cox  in Balkan Strongmen: Dictators and Authoritarian Rulers of South-Eastern Europe edited by Bernd J Fischer;

The exact number of victims is not known. By the end of war, the Ustaše, under Pavelic's leadership, exterminated 30,000 Jews, about 29,000 Gypsies, and between 300,000 and 600,000 Serbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Genocide: A Reference Handbook |last=Ball |first=Howard |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location= |isbn=978-1-59884-488-7 |page=124 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hpVo-cu8wNUC&amp;pg=PA124 |accessdate=}}{{better|this author's work is unfootnoted and full of errors and unsubstantiated material with respect to Pavelic|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The history textbooks in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] cited 700,000 as the total number of victims at Jasenovac. This was promulgated from a 1946 calculation of the demographic loss of population (the difference between the actual number of people after the war and the number that would have been, had the pre-war growth trend continued). After that, it was used by [[Edvard Kardelj]] and [[Moša Pijade]] in the Yugoslav [[war reparations]] claim sent to [[Germany]]. According to the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] (citing the ''[[Encyclopedia of the Holocaust]]''), &quot;Ustasa terrorists killed 500,000 Serbs, expelled 250,000 and forced 250,000 to convert to Catholicism. They murdered thousands of Jews and Gypsies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://motlc.wiesenthal.com/pages/t081/t08100.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]] says:&lt;blockquote&gt;Due to differing views and lack of documentation, estimates for the number of Serbian victims in Croatia range widely, from 25,000 to more than one million. The estimated number of Serbs killed in Jasenovac ranges from 25,000 to 700,000. The most reliable figures place the number of Serbs killed by the Ustaša between 330,000 and 390,000, with 45,000 to 52,000 Serbs murdered in Jasenovac.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us-israel.org/jsource/Holocaust/Jasenovac.html |title=Jasenovac |publisher=Us-israel.org |date= |accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The [[Jasenovac concentration camp|Jasenovac]] Memorial Area, currently headed by Slavko Goldstein, keeps a list of 59,188 names of Jasenovac victims that was gathered by government officials in Belgrade in 1964. Because the gathering process was imperfect, they estimated that the list contains between 60 and 75 percent of the total victims, putting the number of killed in that complex at about 80,000–100,000. The previous head of the Memorial Area Simo Brdar estimated at least 365,000 dead at Jasenovac. The analyses of the statisticians [[Vladimir Žerjavić]] and [[Bogoljub Kočović]] were similar to those of the Memorial Area. In all of Yugoslavia, the estimated number of Serb deaths was 487,000 according to Kočović, and 530,000 according to Žerjavić, out of a total of 1,014,000 or 1,027,000 deaths (resp.). Žerjavić further stated that there were 197,000 Serb civilians killed in NDH (78,000 as prisoners in Jasenovac and elsewhere) as well as 125,000 Serb combatants.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The [[Belgrade]] Museum of Holocaust compiled a list of over 77,000 names of Jasenovac victims. It was previously headed by Milan Bulajić, who supported the claim of a total of 700,000 victims. The current administration of the Museum has further expanded the list to include a bit over 80,000 names. During the 1961 trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]], Alexander Arnon (secretary of the Jewish Community in Zagreb) testified about the treatment of Jews in Yugoslavia during the war.

The first group of camps was formed in the spring of 1941. These included:

* [[Danica, Croatia|Danica]] near [[Koprivnica]]
* [[Pag (town)|Pag]]
* [[Jadovno concentration camp|Jadovno]] near [[Gospić]]
* [[Kruščica]] near [[Vitez]] and [[Travnik]] in Bosnia
* [[Đakovo]]
* Loborgrad in [[Zagorje]]
* Tenja near [[Osijek]]

These six camps were closed by October 1942. The Jasenovac complex was built between August 1941 and February 1942. The first two camps, Krapje and Bročica, were closed in November 1941. The three newer camps continued to function until the end of the war:

* Ciglana (Jasenovac III)
* [[Kozara]] (Jasenovac IV)
* [[Stara Gradiška concentration camp|Stara Gradiška]] (Jasenovac V)

== Connections with the Catholic Church ==

{{main|Catholic clergy involvement with the Ustaše}}

The Ustaše policies against Eastern Orthodoxy are incorrectly associated with &quot;[[Uniatism]]&quot; in some Eastern Orthodox circles.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} This term has not been used by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] except for [[Holy See|Vatican]] condemnation of the idea in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNIATISM&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date= 17–24 June 1993|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/chrstuni/ch_orthodox_docs/rc_pc_chrstuni_doc_19930624_lebanon_en.html|title=UNIATISM, METHOD OF UNION OF THE PAST, AND THE PRESENT SEARCH FOR FULL COMMUNION|publisher=[[Vatican Publishing House|Vatican]]|accessdate=4 October 2007 |last= |quote=With regard to the method which has been called &quot;uniatism&quot;, it was stated at Freising (June 1990) that &quot;we reject it as method for the search for unity because it is opposed to the common tradition of our Churches&quot;.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ustaše represented an extreme example of &quot;Uniatism&quot; rather based on nationalism than on religion. They supported violent aggression or force in order to convert [[Serbo-Croatian language|Serbo-Croatian]] speaking [[Serbian Orthodox]] believers.

The Ustaše held the position that [[Eastern Orthodoxy]], as a symbol of [[Serbian nationalism]], was their greatest foe.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}} The Ustaše never recognized the existence of a Serb people on the territories of Croatia or Bosnia{{spaced ndash}}they recognized only &quot;Croats of the Eastern faith.&quot; They also called Bosniaks &quot;Croats of the Islamic faith,&quot; but they had a stronger ethnic dislike of Serbs.

Some former priests, mostly [[Franciscans]], particularly in, but not limited to, [[Herzegovina]] and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]], took part in the atrocities themselves. [[Miroslav Filipović]] was a Franciscan friar (from the [[Petrićevac]] monastery) who allegedly joined the Ustaša army on 7 February 1942 in a brutal massacre of 2730 Serbs of the nearby villages, including 500 children. He was allegedly subsequently dismissed from his order and defrocked, though when he was hanged for his [[war crimes]], he wore his Franciscan robes.{{citation needed|date=October 2007}} Filipović became Chief Guard of [[Jasenovac concentration camp]] where he was nicknamed ''&quot;Fra [[Satan|Sotona]]&quot;'', and he was given this nickname by Croats themselves.

For the duration of the war, the [[Holy See|Vatican]] kept up full diplomatic relations with the Ustaša state (granting Pavelić an audience), with its [[papal nuncio]] in the capital [[Zagreb]]. The nuncio was briefed on the efforts of religious conversions to Roman Catholicism. After the World War II was over, the Ustaše who had managed to escape from Yugoslav territory (including Pavelić) were smuggled to [[South America]]. It is widely alleged that this was done through [[Ratlines (history)|rat lines]] which were operated by members of the organization who were Catholic priests and who had previously secured positions at the [[Holy See|Vatican]]. Members of the [[Pontifical Croatian College of St. Jerome|Illyrian College of San Girolamo]] in Rome were reputedly involved in this: friars [[Krunoslav Draganović]], Petranović, and Dominik Mandić.

The Ustaše regime had sent large amounts of gold that it had plundered from Serbian and Jewish property owners during World War II into [[Swiss bank]] accounts.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}Of a total of 350 million [[Swiss Franc]]s,{{citation needed|date=April 2008}} about 150 million was seized by [[United Kingdom|British troops]];{{citation needed|date=April 2008}} however, the remaining 200 million (ca. 47 million dollars) reached the Vatican.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}} In October 1946 the American intelligence agency SSU alleged that these funds were still held in the [[Vatican Bank]].{{citation needed|date=April 2008}} This issue is the theme of a recent class action suit against the Vatican Bank and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gorin 23 February 2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Gorin | first = Julia | url = http://www.jpost.com/Features/InThespotlight/Article.aspx?id=169378 |title=Mass grave of history: Vatican's WWII identity crisis | publisher = The Jerusalem Post | date = 23 February 2010 | accessdate = 3 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Alperin v. Vatican Bank]]. Cardinal [[Aloysius Stepinac|Alojzije Stepinac]], [[Archbishop]] of [[Zagreb]] during World War II, was accused of supporting the Ustaše, and of exonerating those in the clergy who collaborated with the Ustaše and were hence complicit in forced conversions. On the other hand, he himself helped Jewish, Serb and Roma/Sinti victims of the Ustaša terror at the same time. Once, while celebrating mass in Zagreb's cathedral, he reportedly said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;katolička crkva ne priznaje podjele na gospodujuće i robujuće rase. Svaki narod, svaka rasa i svaka religija ima jednako pravo dignuti ruke prema nebu i reći oče naš, koji jesi na nebesima.... Neka se srame oni, koji su dušu čovječju, hram Božji, pretvorili u spilju razbojničku!''(Croatian) — The Catholic Church does not recognize divisions into &quot;master&quot; and &quot;slave&quot; races. Every nation, every race and every religion has an equal right to lift their hands to Heaven and pray: &quot;Our Father who art in heaven...&quot; May those be ashamed who have made the human soul, which is God's temple, into a cave of thieves. {{citation needed|date=April 2011}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Archbishop Stepinac also said this on 28 March 1941, noting Yugoslavia's early attempts to unite Croatians and Serbs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All in all, Croats and Serbs are of two worlds, northpole and southpole, never will they be able to get together unless by a miracle of God. The schism (between the Catholic Church and [[Eastern Orthodoxy]]) is the greatest curse in Europe, almost greater than [[Protestantism]]. Here there is no moral, no principles, no truth, no justice, no honesty.&lt;ref&gt;Alojzije Stepinac, zločinac ili svetac:
dokumenti o izdaji i zločinu by Branimir Stanojević; Nova knjiga, 1986, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1998, Stepinac was [[beatification|beatified]] by [[Pope John Paul II]]. On 22 June 2003, John Paul II visited [[Banja Luka]]. During the visit, he held a [[mass]] at the aforementioned [[Petricevac|Petrićevac]] monastery. This caused public uproar due to the connection of the Petrićevac monastery with the crimes of former friar Filipović. At the same location, the pope also proclaimed the [[beatification]] of the Catholic layman Ivan Merz (1896–1928) who was the founder of the &quot;Association of Croatian Eagles&quot; in 1923, which many Serb nationalists and communists view as the precursor to the Ustaše.{{citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Roman Catholic [[apologist]]s defend the Pope's actions by claiming that the convent at Petricevac was one of the places that went up in flames causing the death of 80-year-old Friar Alojzije Atlija.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}} Further, that the war had produced &quot;a total exodus of the Catholic population from this region&quot;; that the few who remained were &quot;predominantly elderly&quot;; and that the church in Bosnia then risked &quot;total extinction&quot; due to the war.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}} Therefore, supporters state that the focus on the anti-Croatian tragedy presently occurring is more important than focusing on one of 60 years ago.{{citation needed|date=April 2008}}

== Structure ==

At the top of the command was the ''[[Poglavnik]]'' (meaning &quot;head&quot;) Ante Pavelić. Pavelić was appointed the office as Head of State of Croatia after [[Adolf Hitler]] had accepted [[Benito Mussolini]]'s proposal of Pavelic, on 10 April 1941.

The [[Army of the Independent State of Croatia|Croatian Home Guard]] was the armed forces of Croatia, it subsequently merged into [[Croatian Armed Forces (Independent State of Croatia)|the Croatian Armed Forces]].

== Symbols ==

[[File:Ustase symbol.svg|thumb|100px]]

The symbol of the Ustaše was a [[majuscule|capital]] blue letter &quot;U&quot; with an exploding grenade emblem within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Littlejohn|first=David|title=Foreign Legions of the Third Reich|year=1994|publisher=R. James Bender Publishing|isbn=978-0-912138-29-9|volume=3|pages=216–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Tomasevich|2001|p=327}}

The flag of the [[Independent State of Croatia]] was a red-white-blue horizontal [[tricolor flag|tricolor]] with the shield of the Coat of Arms or Croatia in the middle and the U in the upper left. Its currency was the [[Independent State of Croatia kuna|NDH kuna]]. The checkered coat of arms of the NDH started with a white field in the corner, and that of today's [[Republic of Croatia|Croatia]] starts with a red field in the corner. Some possible explanations are that the white field symbolizes the Croatian nationality, as opposed to the red field which symbolizes the Croatian state; or that the white field is used on the so-called ''war flag''.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

The Ustaše greeting was &quot;[[Za dom - spremni!]]&quot;:

: ''Salute:'' Za dom! ''For home(land)!''
: ''Reply:'' Spremni! ''(We are) ready!''

This was used instead of the Nazi greeting ''[[Heil Hitler]]'' by the Ustaše. While the greeting was invented in the 19th century by Croatian [[ban (title)|ban]] [[Josip Jelačić]], today it is nominally associated with Ustasha sympathisers by Serbs or non-Ustasha conservatives associated with the [[Croatian Party of Rights]].
However, some Croats see it as a patriotic salute, because it was used long before the Ustase regime{{citation needed|date=January 2010}} and it emphasized the fact of defending your country, your home.
In Internet communication, it is sometimes abbreviated as ZDS.

== Modern usage of term &quot;Ustaša&quot; ==

After World War II, the Ustaša movement was split into several organizations and there is presently no political or paramilitary movement that claims its legacy as their &quot;successor&quot;. The term &quot;ustaše&quot; is today used as (derogatory) term for Croatian [[ultranationalism]]. The term &quot;ustaše&quot; is sometimes used among Serbs to describe [[Serbophobia]] or generally to defame political opponents. When [[Slobodan Milošević]] was at the end of his rule, the protesters called him &quot;Ustaša&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Regional Express, [http://regionalexpress.hr/site/more/prosvjedi-operacija-nije-uspjela-pacijent-je-umro/ prosvjedi-operacija-nije-uspjela-pacijent-je-umro]&lt;/ref&gt;
