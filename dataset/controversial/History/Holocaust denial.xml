'''Holocaust denial''' is the act of [[denial|denying]] the [[genocide]] of [[Jews]] in [[the Holocaust]] during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;definition&quot;&gt;Donald L Niewyk, ''The Columbia Guide to the Holocaust,'' Columbia University Press, 2000, p.45: &quot;The Holocaust is commonly defined as the murder of more than 5,000,000 Jews by the Germans in World War II.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The key claims of Holocaust denial are: the [[Nazi Germany|German Nazi]] government had no [[Final Solution|official policy or intention of exterminating Jews]], Nazi authorities did not use [[extermination camp]]s and [[gas chamber]]s to [[mass murder]] Jews, and the actual number of Jews killed was significantly (typically an [[order of magnitude]]) lower than the historically accepted figure of 5 to 6 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.yadvashem.org/yv/en/holocaust/resource_center/faq.asp &quot;How many Jews were murdered in the Holocaust?

*&quot;Before discussing how Holocaust denial constitutes a conspiracy theory, and how the theory is distinctly American, it is important to understand what is meant by the term &quot;Holocaust denial.&quot; Holocaust deniers, or &quot;revisionists,&quot; as they call themselves, question all three major points of definition of the Nazi Holocaust. First, they contend that, while mass murders of Jews did occur (although they dispute both the intentionality of such murders as well as the supposed deservedness of these killings), there was no official Nazi policy to murder Jews. Second, and perhaps most prominently, they contend that there were no homicidal gas chambers, particularly at Auschwitz-Birkenau, where mainstream historians believe over 1&amp;nbsp;million Jews were murdered, primarily in gas chambers. And third, Holocaust deniers contend that the death toll of European Jews during World War II was well below 6&amp;nbsp;million. Deniers float numbers anywhere between 300,000 and 1.5&amp;nbsp;million, as a general rule.&quot; Mathis, Andrew E.

*&quot;In part III we directly address the three major foundations upon which Holocaust denial rests, including... the claim that gas chambers and crematoria were used not for mass extermination but rather for delousing clothing and disposing of people who died of disease and overwork; ... the claim that the six million figure is an exaggeration by an order of magnitude—that about six hundred thousand, not six million, died at the hands of the Nazis; ... the claim that there was no intention on the part of the Nazis to exterminate European Jewry and that the Holocaust was nothing more than the unfortunate by-product of the vicissitudes of war.&quot; Michael Shermer and Alex Grobman.

*Several hundred thousand rather than approximately six million Jews died during the war.
*Scientific evidence proves that gas chambers could not have been used to kill large numbers of people.
*The Nazi command had a policy of deporting Jews, not exterminating them.
*Some deliberate killings of Jews did occur, but were carried out by the peoples of Eastern Europe rather than the Nazis.
*Jews died in camps of various kinds, but did so as the result of hunger and disease. The Holocaust is a myth created by the Allies for propaganda purposes, and subsequently nurtured by the Jews for their own ends.
*Errors and inconsistencies in survivors’ testimonies point to their essential unreliability.
*Alleged documentary evidence of the Holocaust, from photographs of concentration camp victims to Anne Frank’s diary, is fabricated.
*The confessions of former Nazis to war crimes were extracted through torture.&quot; [http://www.jpr.org.uk/Reports/CS_Reports/no_3_2000/index.htm The nature of Holocaust denial: What is Holocaust denial?], JPR report No. 3, 2000. Retrieved December 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holocaust deniers generally do not accept the term ''[[Denialism|denial]]'' as an appropriate description of their activities, and use the term ''[[Historical revisionism (negationism)|revisionism]]'' instead.&lt;!-- FOOTNOTE BEGINS --&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Revisionist&quot;&gt;Refer to themselves as revisionists:
*&quot;The deniers' selection of the name revisionist to describe themselves is indicative of their basic strategy of deceit and distortion and of their attempt to portray themselves as legitimate historians engaged in the traditional practice of illuminating the past.&quot; [[Deborah Lipstadt]].

*&quot;Dressing themselves in pseudo-academic garb, they have adopted the term &quot;revisionism&quot; in order to mask and legitimate their enterprise.&quot; [http://www.adl.org/holocaust/theory.asp Introduction: Denial as Anti-Semitism], &quot;Holocaust Denial: An Online Guide to Exposing and Combating Anti-Semitic Propaganda&quot;, [[Anti-Defamation League]], 2001.

*&quot;Holocaust deniers often refer to themselves as ‘revisionists’, in an attempt to claim legitimacy for their activities. There are, of course, a great many scholars engaged in historical debates about the Holocaust whose work should not be confused with the output of the Holocaust deniers. Debate continues about such subjects as, for example, the extent and nature of ordinary Germans’ involvement in and knowledge of the policy of genocide, and the timing of orders given for the extermination of the Jews. However, the valid endeavour of historical revisionism, which involves the re-interpretation of historical knowledge in the light of newly emerging evidence, is a very different task from that of claiming that the essential facts of the Holocaust, and the evidence for those facts, are fabrications.&quot; [http://www.jpr.org.uk/Reports/CS_Reports/no_3_2000/index.htm The nature of Holocaust denial: What is Holocaust denial?], JPR report No. 3, 2000.

&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars use the term &quot;denial&quot; to differentiate Holocaust deniers from [[historical revisionism|historical revisionists]], who use established historical [[methodology|methodologies]].&lt;!-- LONG FOOTNOTE FOLLOWS --&gt;&lt;ref name=terminology&gt;Denial vs. &quot;revisionism&quot;:
*&quot;This is the phenomenon of what has come to be known as 'revisionism', 'negationism', or 'Holocaust denial,' whose main characteristic is either an outright rejection of the very veracity of the Nazi genocide of the Jews, or at least a concerted attempt to minimize both its scale and importance... It is just as crucial, however, to distinguish between the wholly objectionable politics of denial and the fully legitimate scholarly revision of previously accepted conventional interpretations of any historical event, including the Holocaust.&quot; [[Omer Bartov|Bartov, Omer]]. ''The Holocaust: Origins, Implementation and Aftermath,'' Routledge, pp.11–12. Bartov is John P. Birkelund Distinguished Professor of European History at the Watson Institute, and is regarded as one of the world's leading authorities on [[genocide]] ([http://www.watsoninstitute.org/contacts_detail.cfm?id=97 &quot;Omer Bartov&quot;], The Watson Institute for International Studies).
*&quot;The two leading critical exposés of Holocaust denial in the United States were written by historians [[Deborah Lipstadt]] (1993) and [[Michael Shermer]] and Alex Grobman (2000). These scholars make a distinction between historical revisionism and denial. Revisionism, in their view, entails a refinement of existing knowledge about an historical event, not a denial of the event itself, that comes through the examination of new empirical evidence or a reexamination or reinterpretation of existing evidence. Legitimate historical revisionism acknowledges a &quot;certain body of irrefutable evidence&quot; or a &quot;convergence of evidence&quot; that suggest that an event_like the black plague, American slavery, or the Holocaust—did in fact occur (Lipstadt 1993:21; Shermer &amp; Grobman 200:34). Denial, on the other hand, rejects the entire foundation of historical evidence...&quot; Ronald J. Berger.

*&quot;At this time, in the mid-1970s, the specter of Holocaust Denial (masked as &quot;revisionism&quot;) had begun to raise its head in Australia...&quot; [[Paul R.

*&quot;[[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]] urges that denial of the Holocaust should not be called 'revisionism' because 'to deny history is not to revise it'. ''Les Assassins de la Memoire. Un Eichmann de papier et autres essays sur le revisionisme'' (The Assassins of Memory—A Paper-Eichmann and Other Essays on Revisionism) 15 (1987).&quot; Cited in Roth, Stephen J. &quot;Denial of the Holocaust as an Issue of Law&quot; in the ''Israel Yearbook on Human Rights'', Volume 23, Martinus Nijhoff Publishers, 1993, ISBN 0-7923-2581-8, p. 215.
*&quot;This essay describes, from a methodological perspective, some of the inherent flaws in the &quot;revisionist&quot; approach to the history of the Holocaust. It is not intended as a polemic, nor does it attempt to ascribe motives. Rather, it seeks to explain the fundamental error in the &quot;revisionist&quot; approach, as well as why that approach of necessity leaves no other choice. It concludes that &quot;revisionism&quot; is a misnomer because the facts do not accord with the position it puts forward and, more importantly, its methodology reverses the appropriate approach to historical investigation... &quot;Revisionism&quot; is obliged to deviate from the standard methodology of historical pursuit, because it seeks to mold facts to fit a preconceived result; it denies events that have been objectively and empirically proved to have occurred; and because it works backward from the conclusion to the facts, thus necessitating the distortion and manipulation of those facts where they differ from the preordained conclusion (which they almost always do). In short, &quot;revisionism&quot; denies something that demonstrably happened, through methodological dishonesty.&quot; McFee, Gordon.

*&quot;Crucial to understanding and combating Holocaust denial is a clear distinction between denial and revisionism. One of the more insidious and dangerous aspects of contemporary Holocaust denial, a la Arthur Butz, Bradley Smith and Greg Raven, is the fact that they attempt to present their work as reputable scholarship under the guise of 'historical revisionism.' The term 'revisionist' permeates their publications as descriptive of their motives, orientation and methodology. In fact, Holocaust denial is in no sense 'revisionism,' it is denial... Contemporary Holocaust deniers are not revisionists&amp;nbsp;– not even neo-revisionists. They are '''Deniers'''. Their motivations stem from their neo-nazi political goals and their rampant antisemitism.&quot; Austin, Ben S.

*&quot;Holocaust denial can be a particularly insidious form of antisemitism precisely because it often tries to disguise itself as something quite different: as genuine scholarly debate (in the pages, for example, of the innocuous-sounding Journal for Historical Review). Holocaust deniers often refer to themselves as ‘revisionists’, in an attempt to claim legitimacy for their activities. There are, of course, a great many scholars engaged in historical debates about the Holocaust whose work should not be confused with the output of the Holocaust deniers.

*&quot;The deniers' selection of the name revisionist to describe themselves is indicative of their basic strategy of deceit and distortion and of their attempt to portray themselves as legitimate historians engaged in the traditional practice of illuminating the past. For historians, in fact, the name revisionism has a resonance that is perfectly legitimate&amp;nbsp;– it recalls the controversial historical school known as World War I &quot;revisionists,&quot; who argued that the Germans were unjustly held responsible for the war and that consequently the Versailles treaty was a politically misguided document based on a [[false premise]]. Thus the deniers link themselves to a specific historiographic tradition of reevaluating the past. Claiming the mantle of the World War I revisionists and denying they have any objective other than the dissemination of the truth constitute a tactical attempt to acquire an intellectual credibility that would otherwise elude them.&quot; [[Deborah Lipstadt]].

*&quot;Jews are thus depicted as manipulative and powerful conspirators who have fabricated myths of their own suffering for their own ends.

*&quot;Why, we might ask the deniers, if the Holocaust did not happen would any group concoct such a horrific story?

*&quot;The central assertion for the deniers is that Jews are not victims but victimizers. They 'stole' billions in reparations, destroyed Germany's good name by spreading the 'myth' of the Holocaust, and won international sympathy because of what they claimed had been done to them. In the paramount miscarriage of injustice, they used the world's sympathy to 'displace' another people so that the state of Israel could be established.

*&quot;They [Holocaust deniers] picture a vast shadowy conspiracy that controls and manipulates the institutions of education, culture, the media and government in order to disseminate a pernicious mythology.

*&quot;The primary motivation for most deniers is anti-Semitism, and for them the Holocaust is an infuriatingly inconvenient fact of history. After all, the Holocaust has generally been recognized as one of the most terrible crimes that ever took place, and surely the very emblem of evil in the modern age. If that crime was a direct result of anti-Semitism taken to its logical end, then anti-Semitism itself, even when expressed in private conversation, is inevitably discredited among most people. What better way to rehabilitate anti-Semitism, make anti-Semitic arguments seem once again respectable in civilized discourse and even make it acceptable for governments to pursue anti-Semitic policies than by convincing the world that the great crime for which anti-Semitism was blamed simply never happened&amp;nbsp;– indeed, that it was nothing more than a frame-up invented by the Jews, and propagated by them through their control of the media? What better way, in short, to make the world safe again for anti-Semitism than by denying the Holocaust?&quot; Reich, Walter.

==Terminology and etymology==
Holocaust deniers prefer to refer to their work as historical revisionism, and object to being referred to as &quot;deniers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Revisionist&quot;/&gt; Scholars consider this to be misleading, since the methods of Holocaust denial differ from those of legitimate historical revision.&lt;ref name=&quot;terminology&quot;/&gt; Legitimate historical revisionism is explained in a resolution adopted by the [[Duke University]] History Department, November 8, 1991, and reprinted in ''Duke Chronicle'', November 13, 1991 in response to an advertisement produced by Bradley R Smith's [[CODOH|Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust]]:

{{quote|That historians are constantly engaged in historical revision is certainly correct; however, what historians do is very different from this advertisement. Historical revision of major events ... is not concerned with the actuality of these events; rather, it concerns their historical interpretation – their causes and consequences generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Denying the Holocaust: the growing assault on truth and memory|edition=reprint |author=Lipstadt, Deborah E. |year=1994 |publisher=Plume |url=http://www.google.ie/search?hl=en&amp;q=Resolution%20adopted%20by%20the%20Duke%20University%20History%20Department%2C%20Nov.%208%2C%201991%2C%20and%20reprinted%20in%20Duke%20Chronicle%2C%20Nov.%2013%2C%201991.&amp;gs_sm=e&amp;gs_upl=14061l14061l0l1l1l0l0l0l0l0l0ll0&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;tbo=u&amp;tbm=bks&amp;source=og&amp;sa=N&amp;tab=wp |isbn=978-0-452-27274-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''The Holocaust: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', [[Donald L. Niewyk]] gives some examples of how legitimate historical revisionism—the re-examination of accepted history and its updating with newly discovered, more accurate, or less-biased information—may be applied to the study of the Holocaust as new facts emerge to change the historical understanding of it:

{{quote|With the main features of the Holocaust clearly visible to all but the willfully blind, historians have turned their attention to aspects of the story for which the evidence is incomplete or ambiguous. These are not minor matters by any means, but turn on such issues as Hitler's role in the event, Jewish responses to persecution, and reactions by onlookers both inside and outside Nazi-controlled Europe.&lt;ref&gt;Niewyk, Donald L. (ed). ''The Holocaust: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', D.C. Heath and Company, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In contrast, the Holocaust denial movement bases its approach on the predetermined idea that the Holocaust, as understood by mainstream historiography, did not occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;predetermined&quot;/&gt; Sometimes referred to as &quot;negationism&quot;, from the French term ''négationnisme'' introduced by [[Henry Rousso]],&lt;ref&gt;See Alain Finkielkraut, Mary Byrd Kelly, Richard J. Golsan.

[[Koenraad Elst]] writes:

{{quote|Negationism means the denial of historical crimes against humanity. It is not a reinterpretation of known facts, but the denial of known facts. The term negationism has gained currency as the name of a movement to deny a specific crime against humanity, the Nazi genocide on the Jews in 1941–45, also known as the holocaust (Greek: complete burning) or the ''Shoah'' (Hebrew: disaster). Negationism is mostly identified with the effort at re-writing history in such a way that the fact of the Holocaust is omitted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Koenraad Elst]].

==Examination of claims==
{{Main|Criticism of Holocaust denial}}

The key claims which cause Holocaust denial to differ from established fact are:&lt;ref name=&quot;Key elements&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Assertions/&gt;

*The Nazis had no official policy or intention of exterminating Jews.
*Nazis did not use [[gas chamber]]s to mass murder Jews.
*The figure of 5 to 6&amp;nbsp;million Jewish deaths is a gross exaggeration, and the actual number is an [[order of magnitude]] lower.

Other claims include the following:
*Stories of the Holocaust were a myth initially created by the [[Allies of World War II]] to demonize Germans.&lt;ref name=Assertions/&gt; Jews spread this myth as part of a grander plot intended to enable the creation of a Jewish homeland in [[Palestine]], and now to garner continuing support for the state of [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;A plot designed to garner support of Israel:
*&quot;The central assertion for the deniers is that Jews are not victims but victimizers. They 'stole' billions in reparations, destroyed Germany's good name by spreading the 'myth' of the Holocaust, and won international sympathy because of what they claimed had been done to them. In the paramount miscarriage of injustice, they used the world's sympathy to 'displace' another people so that the state of Israel could be established. This contention relating to the establishment of Israel is a linchpin of their argument.&quot; [[Deborah Lipstadt]]. ''Denying the Holocaust&amp;nbsp;– The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory'', Penguin, 1993, p. 27. ISBN 0-452-27274-2.
*&quot;Jews are thus depicted as manipulative and powerful conspirators who have fabricated myths of their own suffering for their own ends. According to the Holocaust deniers, by forging evidence and mounting a massive propaganda effort, the Jews have established their lies as ‘truth’ and reaped enormous rewards from doing so: for example, in making financial claims on Germany and acquiring international support for Israel.&quot; [http://www.jpr.org.uk/Reports/CS_Reports/no_3_2000/index.htm The nature of Holocaust denial: What is Holocaust denial?], JPR report No. 3, 2000. Retrieved May 16, 2007.
*&quot;Why, we might ask the deniers, if the Holocaust did not happen would any group concoct such a horrific story? Because, some deniers claim, there was a conspiracy by Zionists to exaggerate the plight of Jews during the war in order to finance the state of Israel through war reparations.&quot; Michael Shermer &amp; Alex Grobman. ''Denying History: : who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and why Do They Say It?'', University of California Press, 2000, ISBN 0-520-23469-3, p. 106.
*&quot;They [Holocaust deniers] picture a vast shadowy conspiracy that controls and manipulates the institutions of education, culture, the media and government in order to disseminate a pernicious mythology. The purpose of this Holocaust mythology, they assert, is the inculcation of a sense of guilt in the white, Western Christian world. Those who can make others feel guilty have power over them and can make them do their bidding. This power is used to advance an international Jewish agenda centered in the Zionist enterprise of the State of Israel.&quot; [http://www.adl.org/holocaust/theory.asp Introduction: Denial as Anti-Semitism], &quot;Holocaust Denial: An Online Guide to Exposing and Combating Anti-Semitic Propaganda&quot;, [[Anti-Defamation League]], 2001.

Powell, ''Troubled Memory: Anne Levy, the Holocaust, and David Duke's Louisiana'', University of North Carolina Press, 2000, ISBN 0-8078-5374-7, p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Documentary evidence of the Holocaust, from photographs to the ''[[The Diary of a Young Girl|Diary of Anne Frank]]'', is fabricated.&lt;ref name=Assertions/&gt;
*Survivor testimonies are filled with errors and inconsistencies, and are thus unreliable.&lt;ref name=Assertions/&gt;
*Interrogators obtained Nazi prisoners' confessions of war crimes through the use of torture.&lt;ref name=Assertions/&gt;
*The Nazi treatment of Jews was no different from what the [[Allies]] did to their enemies in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Shermer &amp; Grobman, 2002, pp. 103–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holocaust denial is widely viewed as failing to adhere to [[rules of evidence|rules for the treatment of evidence]], principles that mainstream historians (as well as scholars in other fields) regard as basic to [[reason|rational inquiry]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;(H)istory is the attempt to describe events of the past and move from description to analysis, in accordance with certain agreed rules of evidence, of analysis of language, and of logic.&quot; 'Yehuda Bauer, Historian of the Holocaust&amp;nbsp;– Portrait of an Historian&quot;&amp;nbsp;– Online Dimensions, a Journal of Holocaust Studies, Fall, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Browning]], ''The Path to Genocide: essays on launching the final solution'', Cambridge University Press, 1992, ISBN 0-521-55878-6, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;According to the historian [[Raul Hilberg]], the United States alone captured forty thousand linear feet of documents on the murder of European Jews... we can say that the Holocaust is a uniquely well-documented historical event.&quot; Deák, István. ''Essays on Hitler's Europe'', University of Nebraska Press, 2001, ISBN 0-8032-1716-1, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; It was further witnessed by the [[Allies|Allied]] forces who entered Germany and its associated [[Axis Powers|Axis]] states towards the end of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;''Holocaust: The events and their impact on real people'', DK Publishing in conjunction with the USC Shoah Foundation Institute for Visual History and Education, p. 146. &quot;&quot;There our troops found sights, sounds, and stenches horrible beyond belief, cruelties so enormous as to be incomprehensible to the normal mind.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kelly Oliver.

''Image and remembrance: representation and the Holocaust'', 2003, Indiana University Press, ISBN 0-253-34188-4, pp. 205–206.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to researchers [[Michael Shermer]] and [[Alex Grobman]], there is a &quot;convergence of evidence&quot; that proves that the Holocaust happened. This evidence includes:&lt;ref&gt;Shermer &amp; Grobman, 2002, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
#''Written documents''—hundreds of thousands of letters, memos, blueprints, orders, bills, speeches, articles, memoirs, and confessions.
#''Eyewitness testimony''—accounts from survivors, Jewish [[Sonderkommando]]s (who helped load bodies from the gas chambers into the crematoria in exchange for a chance of survival), [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] guards, commandants, local townspeople, and even high-ranking Nazis who spoke openly about the mass murder of the Jews.
#''Photographs''—including official military and press photographs, civilian photographs, secret photographs taken by survivors, aerial photographs, German and Allied film footage, and unofficial photographs taken by the German military.
#''The camps themselves''—concentration camps, work camps, and [[extermination camp]]s that still exist in varying degrees of originality and reconstruction.
#''Inferential evidence''—population demographics, reconstructed from the pre–World War II era; if six million Jews were not killed, what happened to them?}}

Much of the controversy surrounding the claims of Holocaust deniers centers on the methods used to present arguments that the Holocaust allegedly ''never happened as commonly accepted''. Numerous accounts have been given by Holocaust deniers (including evidence presented in court cases) of claimed facts and evidence; however, independent research has shown these claims to be based upon flawed research, biased statements, or even deliberately falsified evidence. Opponents of Holocaust denial have documented numerous instances in which such evidence was altered or manufactured (see [[Nizkor Project]] and [[David Irving]]). According to [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]], &quot;in our society of image and spectacle, extermination on paper leads to extermination in reality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]], French ''une tentative d'extermination sur le papier qui relaie l'extermination réelle'' in &quot;Les assassins de la mémoire&quot;, ''Un Eichman de papier'', Postface de Gisèle Sapiro, Nouvelle édition revue et augmentée, La Découverte, Paris, 2005, ISBN 2-7071-4545-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians have documented evidence that as Germany's defeat became imminent and the Nazi leaders realized they would most likely be captured and brought to trial, great effort was made to destroy all evidence of mass extermination.

In 1945, General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], Supreme Allied Commander, anticipated that someday an attempt would be made to recharacterize the Nazi crimes as propaganda and took steps against it:

{{quote|The same day&lt;ref&gt;April 12, 1945&lt;/ref&gt; I saw my first horror camp. It was near the town of Gotha. I have never been able to describe my emotional reactions when I first came face to face with indisputable evidence of Nazi brutality and ruthless disregard of every shred of decency. Up to that time I had known about it only generally or through secondary sources. I am certain however, that I have never at any time experienced an equal sense of shock.&lt;br /&gt;
I visited every nook and cranny of the camp because I felt it my duty to be in a position from then on to testify at first hand about these things in case there ever grew up at home the belief or assumption that &quot;the stories of Nazi brutality were just propaganda&quot;. Some members of the visiting party were unable to go through with the ordeal. I not only did so but as soon as I returned to [[George S. Patton|Patton]]'s headquarters that evening I sent communications to both Washington and London, urging the two governments to send instantly to Germany a random group of newspaper editors and representative groups from the national legislatures. I felt that the evidence should be immediately placed before the American and the British publics in a fashion that would leave no room for cynical doubt.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower, Dwight D.]], ''Crusade in Europe'', pages 409–10, Doubleday, New York, 1948 (no ISBN for this edition)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Eisenhower, upon finding the victims of the death camps, ordered all possible photographs to be taken, and for the German people from surrounding villages to be ushered through the camps and even made to bury the dead. He wrote the following to General Marshall after visiting a German internment camp near Gotha, Germany: {{quote|The visual evidence and the verbal testimony of starvation, cruelty and bestiality were so overpowering as to leave me a bit sick. In one room, where they [there] were piled up twenty or thirty naked men, killed by starvation, George Patton would not even enter. He said that he would get sick if he did so. I made the visit deliberately, in order to be in a position to give first-hand evidence of these things if ever, in the future, there develops a tendency to charge these allegations merely to &quot;propaganda.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower, Dwight D.]], ''Dear General: Eisenhower's Wartime Letters to Marshall'', page 223, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==History and development after World War II==
After World War II, many of the former leaders of the [[SS]] left Germany and began using their propaganda skills to defend their actions (or, their critics contended, to rewrite history). Denial materials began to appear shortly after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Perry, Anti-Semitism, Palgrave: 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

===Harry Elmer Barnes===
[[Harry Elmer Barnes]], an American, was at one time a mainstream historian; he assumed a Holocaust-denial stance in the later years of his life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vho.org/GB/Books/tmotsm/A5.html HARRY ELMER BARNES: Zionist Fraud&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Between World War I and World War II, Barnes became well known as an [[anti-war]] writer and a leader in the historical revisionism movement, where he had worked closely from 1924 onwards with [[Centre for the Study of the Causes of the War]]. This institute was a pseudo-historical think-tank based in Berlin, secretly funded by the German government and headed by a former [[Völkisch movement|''völkisch'']] activist named Major Alfred von Wegerer, whose sole purpose was to prove Germany was the victim of Allied aggression in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Herwig, Holger “Clio Deceived” pages 5–44 from ''International Security'', Volume 12, Issue 2, Fall 1987 pages 22–23 &amp; 26&lt;/ref&gt; Following World War II, Barnes became convinced that allegations made against Germany and Japan, including the Holocaust, were wartime propaganda used to justify U.S. involvement in World War II.

In his 1962 pamphlet, ''Revisionism and Brainwashing'', Barnes claimed that there was a “lack of any serious opposition or concerted challenge to the atrocity stories and other modes of defamation of German national character and conduct”.&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt, Deborah ''Denying the Holocaust'', Free Press: New York, 1993 pages 73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes went on to write that in his view there was “a failure to point out the atrocities of the Allies were more brutal, painful, mortal and numerous than the most extreme allegations made against the Germans”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipstadt, Deborah page 74&quot;&gt;Lipstadt, Deborah ''Denying the Holocaust'', Free Press: New York, 1993 page 74.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting at this time, Barnes started to cite the French Holocaust denier [[Paul Rassinier]], whom Barnes called a “distinguished French historian” who Barnes claimed had exposed the “exaggerations of the atrocity stories&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipstadt, Deborah page 74&quot;/&gt; In a 1964 article entitled “Zionist Fraud” published in the ''[[American Mercury]],'' Barnes wrote that: {{quote|The courageous author [Rassinier] lays the chief blame for misrepresentation on those whom we must call the swindlers of the crematoria, the Israeli politicians who derive billions of marks from nonexistent, mythical and imaginary cadavers, whose numbers have been reckoned in an unusually distorted and dishonest manner”.&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt, Deborah Denying the Holocaust, Free Press: New York, 1993 page 74.&lt;/ref&gt;}} Using Rassinier as his source, Barnes claimed that Germany was the victim of aggression in both 1914 and 1939, and the Holocaust was just propaganda to justify a war of aggression against Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipstadt, Deborah page 74&quot;/&gt; Barnes took the view that World War II had ended in disaster for the West with Germany divided and the United States locked into the [[Cold War]], made all the worse in Barnes’s eyes, as in his view Germany never wanted war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipstadt, Deborah page 75&quot;&gt;Lipstadt, Deborah ''Denying the Holocaust'', Free Press: New York, 1993 page 75&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes claimed that in order to justify the “horrors and evils of the Second World War”, the Allies were required to make the Nazis the “scapegoat” for their own misdeeds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipstadt, Deborah page 75&quot;/&gt; Barnes claimed there were two false claims made about World War II, namely that Germany started the war in 1939, and the Holocaust, which Barnes denied.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipstadt, Deborah page 75&quot;/&gt;

Following the example of Barnes, a few other early libertarian writers also concerned with anti-war historical revisionism began to take a Holocaust-denial stance, including [[James J. Martin]]. Most libertarians, however—even those who otherwise hold Barnes' writings in high regard—reject his Holocaust denial.&lt;ref&gt;Phyllis B Gerstenfeld, Diana R Grant, Crimes of Hate. Sage Press, 2003, p 191&lt;/ref&gt; Barnes' name has since been appropriated by some modern Holocaust deniers in an attempt to lend credibility to their cause, most notably [[Willis Carto]].

===The beginnings of the modern denial movement===
[[File:KKK holocaust a zionist hoax.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Ku Klux Klan|KKK]]: Nazi salute and Holocaust denial]]
In 1961, the American historian and a leading protégé of Barnes, [[David Hoggan]] published ''Der Erzwungene Krieg'' (''The Forced War'') in West Germany, which claimed that Germany had been the victim of an Anglo-Polish conspiracy in 1939. Though ''Der Erzwungene Krieg'' was primarily concerned with the origins of World War II, it also down-played or justified the effects of Nazi [[antisemitic]] measures in the pre-1939 period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipstadt, Deborah page 71&quot;&gt;Lipstadt, Deborah ''Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory'', New York : Free Press ; Toronto : Maxwell Macmillan Canada ; New York ; Oxford : Maxwell Macmillan International, 1993 page 71&lt;/ref&gt; For an example, Hoggan justified the huge one billion ''Reich''-mark fine imposed on the entire Jewish community in Germany after the 1938 ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' as a reasonable measure to prevent what he called &quot;Jewish profiteering&quot; at the expense of German insurance companies and alleged that no Jews were killed in the ''Kristallnacht'' (in fact, 91 German Jews were killed in the ''Kristallnacht'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Lipstadt, Deborah page 71&quot;/&gt; Subsequently, Hoggan wrote one of the first books denying the Holocaust in 1969 entitled ''The Myth of the Six Million'', which was published by the [[Noontide Press]], a small Los Angeles publisher specializing in antisemitic literature.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfired, Ted: ''Deniers Of The Holocaust: Who They Are, What They Do, Why They Do It'' (Twenty-First Century Books, 2001). Page 29&lt;/ref&gt; Hoggan became one of the early stars of the Holocaust denial movement, because he had a number of university professorships.

In 1964, French historian [[Paul Rassinier]] published ''The Drama of the European Jews.'' Rassinier was himself a concentration camp survivor (imprisoned in [[Buchenwald]] for his having helped French Jews escape the Nazis), and modern-day deniers continue to cite his works as scholarly research that questions the accepted facts of the Holocaust. Critics argued that Rassinier did not cite evidence for his claims and ignored information that contradicted his assertions; he nevertheless remains influential in Holocaust denial circles for being one of the first deniers to propose that a vast Zionist/Allied/Soviet conspiracy faked the Holocaust, a theme that would be picked up in later years by other authors.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah E. Lipstadt, ''History on Trial'', Harcourt:2005 ISBN 0-06-059376-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The publication of [[Arthur Butz]]'s ''[[The Hoax of the Twentieth Century]]: The case against the presumed extermination of European Jewry'' in 1976; and [[David Irving]]'s ''[[Hitler's War]]'' in 1977 brought other similarly inclined individuals into the fold.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Lipstadt, ''Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory'' 1994&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1978 and January 1979, [[Robert Faurisson]], a French professor of literature at the [[University of Lyon]], wrote two letters to ''[[Le Monde]]'' claiming that the [[gas chambers]] used by the Nazis to exterminate the Jews did not exist. A colleague of Faurisson, [[Jean-Claude Pressac]], who initially shared Faurisson's views, later became convinced of the Holocaust's evidence while investigating documents at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] in 1979. He published his conclusions along with much of the underlying evidence in his 1989 book, ''Auschwitz: Technique and operation of the gas chambers''.&lt;ref&gt;

[[Henry Bienen]], the former president of [[Northwestern University]], has described Arthur Butz's view of the Holocaust as an &quot;embarrassment to Northwestern&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bienen&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.northwestern.edu/president/arthurbutz.html|title=Message from President Bienen, Northwestern University|last=Bienen|first=Henry S.|date=February 6, 2006|publisher=Northwestern University|accessdate=September 20, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070501100921/http://www.northwestern.edu/president/arthurbutz.html |archivedate = May 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, sixty of Butz's colleagues from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science faculty signed a censure describing Butz's Holocaust denial as &quot;an affront to our humanity and our standards as scholars&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tdn&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailynorthwestern.com/2.13924/students-faculty-oppose-butz-with-petitions-1.1973677#.T7T_58W_MmU|title=Students, faculty oppose Butz with petitions|last=Elizabeth|first=Campbell|date=February 16, 2006|publisher=The Daily Northwestern|accessdate=May 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter also called for Butz to &quot;leave our Department and our University and stop trading on our reputation for academic excellence.&quot;&lt;ref name=tdn/&gt;

===Institute for Historical Review===
In 1978 [[Willis Carto]] founded the [[Institute for Historical Review]] (IHR) as an organization dedicated to publicly challenging the commonly accepted history of the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Chip Berlet &amp; Matthew J. Lyons, ''Right-Wing Populism in America: Too Close for Comfort'', New York: Guilford Press, 2000, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; The IHR sought from the beginning to attempt to establish itself within the broad tradition of historical revisionism, by soliciting token supporters who were not from a neo-Nazi background such as James J. Martin and [[Samuel Edward Konkin III]], and by promoting the writings of French socialist Paul Rassinier and American anti-war historian Harry Elmer Barnes to attempt to show that Holocaust denial had a broader base of support besides just neo-Nazis. The IHR brought most of Barnes' writings, which had been out of print since his death, back into print. While IHR included articles on other topics and sold books by mainstream historians in its catalog, the majority of material published and distributed by IHR was devoted to questioning the facts surrounding the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Evans, ''Lying About Hitler: History, Holocaust, and the David Irving Trial,'' Basic Books, 2002 (ISBN 0-465-02153-0).&lt;/ref&gt;
The IHR became one of the most important organizations devoted to Holocaust denial. In recent years the IHR underwent an internal power struggle which ousted Willis Carto and put [[Mark Weber]] in charge. Carto went on to found the ''[[Barnes Review]]'' magazine after his ouster from IHR, a magazine which is also devoted to Holocaust denial.

In an &quot;About the IHR&quot; statement on their website, the IHR stated that &quot;The Institute does not 'deny the Holocaust'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071013154000/http://ihr.org/main/about.shtml Institute for Historical Review, &quot;About the IHR&quot; page.] Version of October 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The IHR journal, however, states:

{{quote|There is no dispute over the fact that large numbers of Jews were deported to concentration camps and ghettos, or that many Jews died or were killed during World War II. Revisionist scholars have presented evidence, which &quot;exterminationists&quot; have not been able to refute, showing that there was no German program to exterminate Europe's Jews, and that the estimate of six million Jewish wartime dead is an irresponsible exaggeration. The Holocaust&amp;nbsp;– the alleged extermination of some six million Jews (most of them by gassing)&amp;nbsp;– is a hoax and should be recognized as such by Christians and all informed, honest and truthful men everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;''Journal for Historical Review'', 1993, 13, 5, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Commentators and historians have noted the misleading nature of statements by the IHR that they are not Holocaust deniers. [[Paul Rauber]], a senior editor for the Sierra Club Magazine, writes that:
{{quote|The question [of whether the IHR denies the Holocaust] appears to turn on IHR's Humpty-Dumpty word game with the word Holocaust. According to Mark Weber, associate editor of the IHR's Journal of Historical Review [now Director of the IHR], &quot;If by the 'Holocaust' you mean the political persecution of Jews, some scattered killings, if you mean a cruel thing that happened, no one denies that. But if one says that the 'Holocaust' means the systematic extermination of six to eight million Jews in concentration camps, that's what we think there's not evidence for.&quot; That is, IHR doesn't deny that the Holocaust happened; they just deny that the word 'Holocaust' means what people customarily use it for.&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Rauber]], ''[[East Bay Express]]'', January 17, 1992, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to British historian of Germany [[Richard J. Evans]]:
{{quote|Like many individual Holocaust deniers, the Institute as a body denied that it was involved in Holocaust denial. It called this a 'smear' which was 'completely at variance with the facts' because 'revisionist scholars' such as Faurisson, Butz 'and bestselling British historian David Irving acknowledge that hundreds of thousands of Jews were killed and otherwise perished during the Second World War as a direct and indirect result of the harsh anti-Jewish policies of Germany and its allies'. But the concession that a relatively small number of Jews were killed was routinely used by Holocaust deniers to distract attention from the far more important fact of their refusal to admit that the figure ran into the millions, and that a large proportion of these victims were systematically murdered by gassing as well as by shooting.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard J. Evans]]. ''Telling Lies About Hitler: The Holocaust, History and the David Irving Trial'', Verso, 2002, ISBN 1-85984-417-0, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Bradley Smith and the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust===
In 1987, Bradley R. Smith, a former media director of the Institute for Historical Review,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/archive/archive2/usa/usa.htm Antisemitism and Xenophobia Today: United States of America]&lt;/ref&gt; founded the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust (CODOH).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/poisoning_web/codoh.asp &quot;Poisoning the Web&amp;nbsp;– Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust.&quot;] ''[[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]]''. 2001. April 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, CODOH has repeatedly tried to place newspaper advertisements questioning whether the Holocaust happened, especially in college campus newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/holocaust/bradley_smith.asp &quot;Bradley Smith and the Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust: The New College Try.&quot;] ''[[Anti-Defamation League|ADL]]''. 2001.

April 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradley Smith has more recently sought other avenues to promote Holocaust denial&amp;nbsp;– with little success. On September 8, 2009, The Harvard Crimson school paper ran a paid ad from Bradley R Smith. It was quickly criticized and an apology was issued from the editor, claiming it was a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/US/09/09/massachusetts.harvard.holocaust/index.html|title=Harvard Crimson says Holocaust denial ad published by accident|last=Buxbaum|first=Evan|date=September 10, 2009|publisher=CNN|accessdate=September 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- For the whole paragraph as it falls under [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons]]--&gt;

Bradley referred to his tactics as the CODOH campus project. Bradley says, “I don’t want to spend time with adults anymore, I want to go to students. They are superficial. They are empty vessels to be filled.” “What I wanted to do was I wanted to set forth three or four ideas that students might be interested in, that might cause them to think about things or to have questions about things. And I wanted to make it as simple as possible, and to set it up in a way that could not really be debated”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/smith_codoh/words.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=10 Bradley Smith, Holocaust Denial, Committee for Open Debate on the Holocaust – Extremism in America&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Holocaust deniers have placed[…]“Full page advertisements in college and university newspaper, including those of Brandeis University, Boston College, Pennsylvania State University, and Queens College.

===James Keegstra===
{{Details|R. v. Keegstra}}
In 1984, [[James Keegstra]], a Canadian high-school teacher, was charged with denying the Holocaust and making antisemitic claims in his classroom as part of the course material. Keegstra and his lawyer, [[Doug Christie (lawyer)|Doug Christie]], argued that the section of the [[Criminal Code of Canada]] (now section 319{2}), is an infringement of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|Charter of Rights]] (section 9{b}). The case was appealed to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], where it was decided that the law he was convicted under did infringe on his freedom of expression, but it was a [[R. v. Keegstra#Reasons of the court|justified infringement]]. Keegstra was convicted, and fired from his job.&lt;ref&gt;

*&quot;The trouble erupted when the teacher's anti-Jewish (and, incidentally, anti-Catholic) views attracted complaints from certain Eckville parents, thereby inviting intervention from the district school superintendent, Robert David, in 1981. A train of events was launched that finally led to Keegstra's dismissal and subsequent indictment.&quot; Alan Davies, &quot;The Keegstra Affair&quot;, in Alan T. Davies, ''Antisemitism in Canada: History and Interpretation'', Wilfrid Laurier University Press, 1992, ISBN 0-88920-216-8, p. 228.
*&quot;Far from arguing that Keegstra had a civil right to continue spreading his dreck at Eckville High, civil libertarians wonder (along with the rest of Canada, we hope) why it took twelve years for the local school board to exercise its appropriate authority and fire him. But at least Keegstra was finally fired, and was finally removed from his position as Mayor of Eckville.&quot; John Dixon, [http://www.bccla.org/positions/freespeech/85keegstra.html The Keegstra case: Freedom of speech and the prosecution of harmful ideas], [[British Columbia Civil Liberties Association]] Position Paper, 1986.

===The Zündel trials===
{{See also|Leuchter report}}
[[File:Did six million really die.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Did Six Million Really Die?]]'' by Richard Harwood (also known as [[Richard Verrall]]). The Supreme Court of Canada found in 1992 that the book &quot;misrepresented the work of historians, misquoted witnesses, fabricated evidence, and cited non-existent authorities.&quot;]]''

The Toronto-based photo retoucher [[Ernst Zündel]] operated a small-press publishing house called Samisdat Publishing, which published and distributed Holocaust-denial material such as ''[[Did Six Million Really Die?]]'' by Richard Harwood (a.k.a. [[Richard Verrall]]&amp;nbsp;– a British neo-Nazi leader). In 1985, he was tried in [[R. v. Zundel]] and convicted under a &quot;false news&quot; law and sentenced to 15 months imprisonment by an [[Ontario]] court for &quot;disseminating and publishing material denying the Holocaust.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zundelcourt&quot;&gt;{{cite court|litigants=R. v. Zundel |vol=|reporter=|opinion=|pinpoint=|court=|date=August 27, 1992|url=http://scc.lexum.umontreal.ca/en/1992/1992rcs2-731/1992rcs2-731.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Holocaust historian [[Raul Hilberg]] was a notable witness for the prosecution at the 1985 trial. Zündel gained considerable notoriety after this conviction, and a number of free-speech activists stepped forward to defend his right to publish his opinions. After his conviction in 1985, Zündel was able to have it overturned in an appeal on a legal technicality, leading to a second trial in 1988, in which he was again convicted. The 1988 trial was notable for the appearance of [[Fred A. Leuchter]], [[David Irving]] and [[Robert Faurisson]] as defense witnesses for Zündel, and for the presentation of the pseudo-scientific [[Leuchter report]] as a defense document. The Leuchter report was published in Canada in 1988 by [[Samisdat Publishers]] and in Britain in 1989 by Irving's Focal Point Publishing. In both of his trials, Zündel was defended by [[Doug Christie (lawyer)|Douglas Christie]] and [[Barbara Kulaszka]]. His conviction was overturned in 1992 when the Supreme Court of Canada declared the &quot;false news&quot; law unconstitutional.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zundelcourt&quot;/&gt;

Zündel has a website, web-mastered by his wife Ingrid, which publicises his viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;[(www.Zundelsite.org) Zundelsite] Accessed June 27, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2002, the [[Canadian Human Rights Commission|Canadian Human Rights Tribunal]] delivered a ruling in a complaint involving his website, in which it was found to be contravening the [[Canadian Human Rights Act]]. The court ordered Zündel to cease communicating hate messages. In February 2003, the American [[Immigration and Naturalization Service|INS]] arrested him in [[Tennessee]], USA, on an immigration violations matter, and few days later, Zündel was sent back to Canada, where he tried to gain refugee status. Zündel remained in prison until March 1, 2005, when he was deported to Germany and prosecuted for disseminating hate propaganda. On February 15, 2007, Zündel was convicted on 14 counts of incitement under Germany's ''[[Volksverhetzung]]'' law, which bans the incitement of hatred against a portion of the population, and given the maximum sentence of five years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/topics/news/world/story.html?id=c61ce061-50b2-42a5-bb2f-a7bbaecccceb&amp;k=32537 | title = German court sentences Ernst Zundel to 5 years in prison for Holocaust denial | author=Canadian Press | publisher=canada.com | date= February 15, 2007 | accessdate =February 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ernst Nolte===
The German philosopher and historian [[Ernst Nolte]], starting in the 1980s, advanced a set of theories, which though not denying the Holocaust appeared to flirt with Holocaust denial as a serious historical argument.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans, Richard J. page 83&quot;&gt;Evans, Richard J. ''In Hitler's Shadow'' New York: Pantheon Books, 1989 page 83.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to the Israeli historian Otto Dov Kulka of December 8, 1986 Nolte criticized the work of the French Holocaust denier [[Robert Faurisson]] on the ground that the Holocaust did occur, but went on to argue that Faurison’s work was motivated by what Nolte claimed were the admirable motives of sympathy towards the Palestinians and opposition to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, Charles ''The Unmasterable Past'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1988 page 190.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1987 book ''Der europäische Bürgerkrieg'' (''The European Civil War''), Nolte claimed that the intentions of Holocaust deniers are &quot;often honourable&quot;, and that some of their claims are &quot;not obviously without foundation&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evans, Richard J. page 83&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt, Deborah ''Denying the Holocaust'', New York: Free Press, 1993 page 214&lt;/ref&gt; Nolte himself, though he has never denied the occurrence of the Holocaust, has claimed that the [[Wannsee Conference]] of 1942 never happened, and that the minutes of the conference were post-war forgeries done by &quot;biased&quot; Jewish historians designed to discredit Germany&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt, Deborah ''Denying the Holocaust'', Free Press: New York, 1993 page 214&lt;/ref&gt;

The British historian [[Ian Kershaw]] has argued that Nolte was operating on the borderlines of Holocaust denial with his implied claim that the &quot;negative myth&quot; of the Third Reich was created by Jewish historians, his allegations of the domination of Holocaust scholarship by “biased” Jewish historians, and his statements that one should withhold judgment on Holocaust deniers, whom Nolte takes considerable pains to stress are not exclusively Germans or fascists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kershaw, Ian page 176&quot;&gt;Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretations'', London: Arnold, 1989 page 176&lt;/ref&gt; In Kershaw's opinion, Nolte is attempting to imply that perhaps Holocaust deniers are on to something.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kershaw, Ian page 176&quot;/&gt; In a 1990 interview, Nolte implied that there was something to the [[Leuchter report]]: &quot;If the revisionists [Holocaust deniers] and Leuchter among them have made it clear to the public that even &quot;Auschwitz&quot; must be an object of scientific inquiry and controversy then they should be given credit for this. Even if it finally turned out that the number of victims was even greater and the procedures were even more horrific than has been assumed until now.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brinks, Jan Hermann ''Children of a New Fatherland'', London: I.B. Tauris, 2000 page 108.&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1993 book ''Streitpunkte'' (''Points of Contention''), Nolte praised the work of Holocaust deniers as superior to &quot;mainstream scholars&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wistrich, Robert S pages 293-301&quot;&gt;Wistrich, Robert S. &quot;Holocaust Denial&quot; pages 293–301 from ''The Holocaust Encyclopedia'' edited by Walter Laqueur, New Haven: Yale University Press, 2001 page 299&lt;/ref&gt; Nolte wrote that &quot;radical revisionists have presented research which, if one is familiar with the source material and the critique of the sources, is probably superior to that of the established historians of Germany&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wistrich, Robert S pages 293-301&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lukacs, John ''The Hitler of History'' New York: Vintage Books, 1997, 1998 page 233.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1994 interview with ''Der Spiegel'' magazine, Nolte stated &quot;I cannot rule out the importance of the investigation of the gas chambers in which they looked for remnants of the [chemical process engendered by Zyklon B]&quot;, and that “'Of course, I am against revisionists, but Fred Leuchter's &quot;study&quot; of the Nazi gas ovens has to be given attention, because one has to stay open to &quot;other&quot; ideas.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The British historian [[Richard J. Evans]] in his 1989 book ''In Hitler's Shadow'' expressed the view that Nolte’s reputation as a scholar was in ruins as a result of these and other controversial statements on his part.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Richard ''In Hitler's Shadow'', New York, NY: Pantheon, 1989 page 123&lt;/ref&gt; The American historian [[Deborah Lipstadt]] in a 2003 interview stated: {{quote|Historians such as the German Ernst Nolte are, in some ways, even more dangerous than the deniers. Nolte is an anti-Semite of the first order, who attempts to rehabilitate Hitler by saying that he was no worse than Stalin; but he is careful not to deny the Holocaust. Holocaust-deniers make Nolte's life more comfortable. They have, with their radical argumentation, pulled the center a little more to their side. Consequently, a less radical extremist, such as Nolte, finds himself closer to the middle ground, which makes him more dangerous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===The Mayer Controversy===
In 1988, the American historian [[Arno J. Mayer]] published a book entitled ''Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?'', which did not deny the Holocaust, but appeared to lend support to Holocaust denial by stating that the majority of people who died at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] were the victims of diseases rather than gassing.&lt;ref&gt;Dawidowicz, Lucy ''What Is The Use of Jewish History?'', New York: Schocken Books, 1992 pages 129–130&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, critics of Mayer such as [[Lucy Dawidowicz]] assailed him for listing the works of [[Arthur Butz]] and [[Paul Rassinier]] in his bibliography, and charged his statements about Auschwitz were factually incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;Dawidowicz, Lucy ''What Is The Use of Jewish History?'', New York: Schocken Books, 1992 page 130&lt;/ref&gt; Holocaust expert [[Robert Jan van Pelt]] has noted that Mayer's book is as close as a mainstream historian has ever come to supporting Holocaust denial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pelt pages 47-48&quot;&gt;Pelt, Robert Jan van ''The Case for Auschwitz'', Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 2002 pages 47–48&lt;/ref&gt; Holocaust deniers such as [[David Irving]] have often cited Mayer’s book as one reason for embracing Holocaust denial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pelt pages 47-48&quot;/&gt; Though Mayer has been often condemned for his statement about the reasons for the Auschwitz death toll, his book does not deny the Holocaust as Holocaust deniers often claim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Holocaust deniers have often quoted out of context Mayer’s sentence in ''Why Did the Heavens Not Darken?'' that “Sources for the study of the gas chambers at once rare and unreliable”&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael &amp; Grobman, Alex ''Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?,'' Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002 page 126.&lt;/ref&gt; as the authors [[Michael Shermer]] and Alex Grobman have noted that the paragraph from which the sentence is taken states that the SS destroyed the majority of the documention relating to the operation of the gas chambers in the death camps, which is why Mayer feels that sources for the operation of the gas chambers are &quot;rare&quot; and &quot;unreliable&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Shermer, Michael &amp; Grobman, Alex ''Denying History: Who Says the Holocaust Never Happened and Why Do They Say It?,'' Berkeley: University of California Press, 2002 pages 126–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Israeli historian [[Yehuda Bauer]] wrote that Mayer &quot;popularizes the nonsense that the Nazis saw in Marxism and Bolshevism their main enemy, and the Jews unfortunately got caught up in this; when he links the destruction of the Jews to the ups and downs of German warfare in the Soviet Union, in a book that is so cocksure of itself that it does not need a proper scientific apparatus, he is really engaging in a much more subtle form of Holocaust denial&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Baurer, Yehuda &quot;A Past That Will Not Away&quot; pages 12–22 from ''The Holocaust and History'' edited by Michael Berenbaum and Abrahm Peck, Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1998 page 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ken McVay and ''alt.revisionism''===
[[Ken McVay]], an American resident in Canada, was disturbed by the efforts of organizations like the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]] to suppress the speech of the Holocaust deniers, feeling that it was better to confront them openly than to try to censor them. On the [[Usenet]] newsgroup ''alt.revisionism'' he began a campaign of &quot;truth, fact, and evidence,&quot; working with other participants on the newsgroup to uncover factual information about the Holocaust and counter the arguments of the deniers by proving them to be based upon misleading evidence, false statements, and outright lies. He founded the [[Nizkor Project]] to expose the activities of the Holocaust deniers, who responded to McVay with personal attacks, slander, and death threats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protocol.gov.bc.ca/protocol/prgs/obc/1995/1995_KMcVay.htm O.B.C Biography&amp;nbsp;– Kenneth McVay]&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Irving and the Lipstadt libel case===
{{Main|Irving v Penguin Books and Lipstadt}}

[[Deborah Lipstadt]]'s 1993 book ''[[Denying the Holocaust]]'' was sharply critical of questionable analytical methods used by various Holocaust deniers, in particular British author [[David Irving]], whom she accused of deliberately misrepresenting evidence to justify his preconceived conclusions.  In 1996 Irving filed a libel suit against Lipstadt and her publisher, [[Penguin Books]].  American historian [[Christopher Browning]], an expert witness for the defense, wrote a comprehensive essay for the court summarizing the voluminous evidence for the reality of the Holocaust, and under cross-examination, effectively countered all of Irving's principal arguments to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Evans | first = Richard J. | authorlink = Richard J. Evans | title = Telling Lies about Hitler | publisher=Verso | year = 2002 | isbn = 1-85984-417-0 | page = 35 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge historian [[Richard J. Evans]], another defense expert witness, spent two years examining Irving's writings, and confirmed his misrepresentations, including evidence that he had knowingly used forged documents as source material. The judge, Justice Charles Gray, ultimately delivered a long and decisive verdict in favor of Lipstadt that referred to Irving as a &quot;Holocaust denier&quot; and &quot;right-wing pro-Nazi [[polemic]]ist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lipstadt, ''History on Trial''&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2006 Irving was arrested in Austria, where Holocaust denial is illegal, for a speech he had made in 1989 in which he denied the existence of gas chambers at Auschwitz.&lt;ref name=&quot;release&quot;/&gt; Irving was aware of the outstanding arrest warrant, but chose to go to Austria anyway &quot;to give a lecture to a far-right student fraternity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;release&quot;&gt;&quot;Holocaust denier to be released&quot; (December 20, 2006): [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/6196073.stm BBC News] Retrieved January 13, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although he pleaded guilty to the charge, Irving said he had been &quot;mistaken&quot;, and had changed his opinions on the Holocaust. &quot;I said that then, based on my knowledge at the time, but by 1991 when I came across the Eichmann papers, I wasn't saying that anymore and I wouldn't say that now.

Upon hearing of Irving's sentence, Lipstadt said, &quot;I am not happy when censorship wins, and I don't believe in winning battles via censorship&amp;nbsp;... The way of fighting Holocaust deniers is with history and with truth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCCenshorship&quot;/&gt;

According to ''[[CNN]]'', upon Irving's return to the UK, he &quot;vow[ed] to repeat views denying the Holocaust that led to his conviction&quot; stating he felt &quot;no need any longer to show remorse&quot; for his Holocaust views.&lt;ref&gt;{{wayback|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/12/21/uk.irving.ap/index.html|title=Holocaust denier: 'No need to show remorse'|date=20070116221731}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent developments and trends==
In Turkey, in 1996, the Islamic preacher [[Harun Yahya]] distributed thousands of copies of a book which was originally published the previous year, entitled ''Soykırım Yalanı'' (&quot;The Holocaust Lie&quot;) and mailed unsolicited texts to American and European schools and colleges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/organizations/harunyahya.html Harun Yahya and Holocaust Revisionism]&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of ''Soykırım Yalanı'' sparked much public debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;axt&quot; &gt;[http://www.axt.org.uk/antisem/archive/archive1/turkey/turkey.htm AXT 1996 report on antisemitism in Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;  This book claims that “what is presented as Holocaust is the death of some Jews due to the typhus plague during the war and the famine towards the end of the war caused by the defeat of the Germans.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.fortunecity.com/vural/bks/HOLOCAUST.HTML The Holocaust Deception&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1996, a Turkish painter and intellectual, [[Bedri Baykam]], published a strongly worded critique of the book in the Ankara daily newspaper ''Siyah-Beyaz'' (&quot;Black and White&quot;).

In France, Holocaust denial became more prominent in the 1990s as ''négationnisme,'' though the movement has existed in ultra-left French politics since at least the 1960s, led by figures such as [[Pierre Guillaume]] (who was involved in the bookshop [[La Vieille Taupe]] during the 1960s). Recently, elements of the extreme far right in France have begun to build on each other's negationist arguments, which often span beyond the Holocaust to cover a range of antisemitic views, incorporating attempts to tie the Holocaust to the Biblical massacre of the [[Canaanites]], critiques of Zionism, and other material fanning what has been called a &quot;conspiratorial Judeo-phobia&quot; designed to legitimize and &quot;banalize&quot; antisemitism.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Joseph Golsan, ''Vichy's Afterlife,'' University of Nevada Press, 2003, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Belgium in 2001, [[Roeland Raes]], the ideologue and vice-president of one of the country's largest political parties, the [[Vlaams Belang]] (formerly named [[Vlaams Blok]], Flemish Bloc), gave an interview on Dutch TV where he cast doubt over the number of Jews murdered by the Nazis during the Holocaust. In the same interview he questioned the scale of the Nazis' use of gas chambers and the authenticity of [[Anne Frank|Anne Frank's]] diary. In response to the media assault following the interview, Raes was forced to resign his position but vowed to remain active within the party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/elsewhere/journalist/story/0,7792,449278,00.html Belgium's far right party in Holocaust controversy], ''The Guardian'', Friday, March 9, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later, the Vlaams Blok was convicted of racism and chose to disband. Immediately afterwards, it legally reformed under the new name Vlaams Belang (Flemish Interest) with the same leaders and the same membership.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3994867.stm Court rules Vlaams Blok is racist], BBC News, November 9, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Holocaust denial in the Arab world===
Denials of the Holocaust have been regularly promoted by various Arab leaders and others and in Arab media throughout the Middle East. According to Associated Press reports, Arab world attitudes towards the Holocaust range from total denial to a minimization of the extent of the genocide and holocaust denial is rife within Palestinian society and in the Palestinian territories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1073846.html|title= Palestinian children sing for Holocaust survivors|author=Diaa Hadid|date=March 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090908/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_palestinians_un_holocaust|title=UN caught in Gaza dispute over study of Holocaust|last=Laub|first=Karin|date=September 8, 2009|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=September 8, 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090915182155/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090908/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_palestinians_un_holocaust &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=September 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/holocaust/Denial_ME/in_own_words.asp ADL on Holocaust Denial], [http://www.memri.org/bin/articles.cgi?Page=countries&amp;Area=egypt&amp;ID=SP7700 MEMRI]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a University of Haifa survey revealed that 40.5 percent of Israeli Arabs claim the Holocaust never happened.&lt;ref&gt;Fadi Eyadat: [http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/survey-finds-nearly-half-of-israeli-arabs-deny-holocaust-1.276206 Survey finds nearly half of Israeli Arabs deny Holocaust] ''Haaretz,'' May.18, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent Arab figures from the Middle East have rarely made publicized visits to [[Auschwitz]]&lt;ref name=&quot;MK&quot;&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1145271.html Arab MK's Auschwitz visit draws fire from Jewish, Arab critics] ''[[Associated Press]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and individuals from the [[Syria]]n government, the [[Palestinian Authority]], and a number of Palestinian groups have all engaged in various aspects of Holocaust denial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karsh98&quot;&gt;[[Efraim Karsh|Karsh, Efraim]].

According to [[Bernard Lewis]], the three most common positions on the historicity of the Holocaust are: &quot;it never happened; it was greatly exaggerated; the Jews deserved it anyway.  On the last point, some more enterprising writers add a rebuke to [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] for not having finished the job.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|Lewis, Bernard]].  ''[[The Crisis of Islam: Holy War and Unholy Terror]]''.  New York: The Modern Library, 2003.  p. 155.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In August 2002, the [[Zayed Center for Coordination and Follow-Up]], an [[Arab League]] think-tank whose Chairman, [[Sultan bin Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan]], served as Deputy Prime Minister of the [[United Arab Emirates]], promoted a Holocaust denial symposium in [[Abu Dhabi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.likud.nl/extr225.html Arab League to participate in Holocaust-denial symposium], ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', August 28, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The government of the United Arab Emirates closed down the Zayed Center as a result.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/PresRele/ASInt_13/4335_13.htm The Anti-Defamation League (ADL)].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hamas]] leaders have also promoted Holocaust denial; [[Abdel Aziz al-Rantissi]] held that the Holocaust never occurred, that [[Zionism|Zionists]] were behind the action of Nazis, and that Zionists funded Nazism.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/jun/22/religion.guardiancolumnists |work=The Guardian  |location=London  | title=The new anti-Semitism | date=June 22, 2003 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A press release by Hamas in April 2000 decried &quot;the so-called Holocaust, which is an alleged and invented story with no basis.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtoninstitute.org/templateC05.php?CID=1946 Washington Institute for Near East Policy], 2000&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, Hamas refused to allow Palestinian children to learn about the Holocaust, which it called &quot;a lie invented by the Zionists&quot; and referred to Holocaust education as a &quot;war crime.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jta.org/news/article/2009/08/31/1007549/hamas-condemns-un-for-teaching-the-holocaust#When:14:44:00Z &quot;Hamas rips U.N. for teaching the Holocaust.&quot;] ''[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency|JTA]]''.

Holocaust denial has also been resisted by prominent intellectual figures in the Arab world; in 2001, an outcry led by Palestinian poet [[Mahmoud Darwish]], Lebanese writer [[Elias Khoury (writer)|Elias Khoury]] and others brought about the cancellation of a conference the Holocaust denial organization Institute for Historical Review had planned to hold in Beirut.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/Learn/ext_us/historical_review.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=3&amp;item=ihr Anti-defamation League website article on Institute for Historical Review, visualised September 1, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the Egyptian [[Muslim Brotherhood]] leader, [[Mohammed Mahdi Akef]], denounced what he called &quot;the myth of the Holocaust&quot; in defending Iranian president [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s denial of the Holocaust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4554986.stm Egyptian Islamists deny Holocaust], December 23, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the founder of the [[Islamic Movement in Israel]], Sheikh [[Abdullah Nimr Darwish]], condemned Holocaust denial in the Muslim world (especially that by [[Mahmoud Ahmedinejad]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;H&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/founder-of-islamic-movement-in-israel-slams-holocaust-denial-1.212724 | title=Founder of Islamic Movement in Israel slams Holocaust denial | publisher=[[Haaretz]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a debate which aired on ''Al-Alam TV'' on May 5, 2010 (as translated by [[MEMRI]]), Ali Hatar of the ''Jordanian Association against Zionism and Racism'' stated that &quot;To this day, those who claim that [the Holocaust] did take place have been unable to provide any evidence whatsoever to that effect.&quot; He claimed that a report by the [[Red Cross]] in 1949 &quot;refutes the claim that anyone was killed in these camps, during the so-called Holocaust. It also mentions the self-management [of the camps] by the Jews.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/2474.htm Holocaust Denial Discussed on Iranian TV: There Were No Gas Chambers; You Cannot Squeeze 2,000 Jews into 100 Square Meters], MEMRITV.org, Clip No. 2474, May 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Holocaust denial is relatively new to the Middle East, as Kenneth Jacobson, assistant national director of the [[Anti-Defamation League]], said in an interview with ''[[Haaretz]]'': &quot;Adopting the theories of Holocaust denial of Western scholars is a relatively new phenomenon in the Muslim world. The accepted attitude had been to say that whereas it was true the Holocaust had taken place, the Palestinians should not have to pay the price. A look at Iranian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]'s statements shows that he has mixed the two approaches.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Amiram Barkat, [http://web.archive.org/web/20060305231222/http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/685642.html &quot;Iran pledges to finance Hamas-led Palestinian government&quot;], Haaretz (Way Back Machine)&lt;/ref&gt;

In a December 2005 speech, Ahmadinejad said that a legend was fabricated and had been promoted to protect [[Israel]]. He said,
{{quote|They have fabricated a legend, under the name Massacre of the Jews, and they hold it higher than God himself, religion itself and the prophets themselves&amp;nbsp;...

The remarks immediately provoked international controversy as well as swift condemnation from government officials in Israel, Europe, and the United States. All six political parties in the German parliament signed a joint resolution condemning this Holocaust denial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expatica.com/source/site_article.asp?subchannel_id=52&amp;story_id=26268&amp;name=German+parliament+slams+Ahmadinejad+remarks German parliament slams Ahmadinejad remarks], ''Expatica'', December 16, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hamas]] political leader [[Khaled Mashaal]] described Ahmadinejad's comments as &quot;courageous&quot; and stated that &quot;Muslim people will defend Iran because it voices what they have in their hearts, in particular the Palestinian people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Al Jazeera, [http://web.archive.org/web/20071206115859/http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=17093 &quot;Hamas springs to Iran's defense&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the [[Muslim Public Affairs Council]] condemned Ahmadinejad's remarks.&lt;ref name=mpac&gt;{{cite news|title=MPAC Rebukes Iranian President's Comments|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080617083103/http://www.mpac.org/article.php?id=231|accessdate=January 31, 2012|date=December 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]] is the former [[Prime minister of Iran|Prime minister]] of Iran and an opposition leader.
During a TV-debate preceding [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|Iran's 2009 elections]], the [[Jerusalem Post]] reported that Mousavi &quot;slam[med] Ahmadinejad's Holocaust denial&quot;. He also said that it had cost Iran its international standing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mousavi slams Ahmadinejad's Holocaust denial in TV debate|url=http://www.jpost.com/IranianThreat/News/Article.aspx?id=144442|publisher=[[Jerusalem Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Press TV]], Mousavi has said that the Holocaust is not Iran's business, and that Iran should instead try to &quot;find the most reasonable way to solve the Palestine case&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moussavi: Holocaust not Iran's business|url=http://edition.presstv.ir/detail/92465.html|publisher=[[Press TV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early June 2009, Ahmadinejad described Israel as &quot;the most criminal regime in human history&quot; and spoke about the &quot;great deception of the Holocaust&quot; in a speech quoted by IRIB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE5525W320090603 Ahmadinejad calls Holocaust a &quot;great deception&quot;], Reuters, June 3, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the September 2009 [[Quds Day]] ceremonies in Tehran, Ahmadinejad stated Israel was created on &quot;a lie and a mythical claim,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090918/ap_on_re_mi_ea/ml_iran_ahmadinejad Iran's Ahmadinejad questions Holocaust]{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the Western powers &quot;launched the myth of the Holocaust.

In September 2010, during a State visit to New York City, Ahmadinejad once again questioned the Holocaust, saying it “has been exaggerated as a pretext for war.” In an interview with the editor of the magazine ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' on September&amp;nbsp;28, he said, “The question is, why don't we allow this subject to be examined further ... It is incorrect to force only one view on the rest of the world.” He added: “How come when it comes to the subject of the Holocaust there is so much sensitivity?”&lt;ref&gt;Ahmadinejad Again Denies Holocaust, Threatens U.S. (September 29, 2010).

Ahmadinejad made similar statements later that day during what was described by [[Agence France-Presse]] as a “chaotic speech” at the United Nations summit on the [[Millennium Development Goals]].  He further charged that the U.S. government &quot;orchestrated&quot; the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|World Trade Center attacks]] in order to reverse declines in the U.S. economy and &quot;save the Zionist regime.&quot;  He broke off at one point during the speech to complain that his words were not being accurately translated.

===Propaganda in the media===
According to James Najarian, Holocaust deniers working for the Institute for Historical review are not trained in history and &quot;put out sham scholarly articles in the mock-academic publication, the ''Journal of Historical Review''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Najarian |first1=James |year=1997 |title=Gnawing at History: The Rhetoric of Holocaust Denial |journal=Midwest Quarterly |volume=39 |issue=1 |page=74 |url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?hid=106&amp;sid=132224f1-624f-44b2-9db4-f89053786c68%40sessionmgr111&amp;vid=4&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=9711065531 |accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They appeal to “our objectivity, our sense of fair play, and our distrust of figurative language”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Najarian |first1=James |year=1997 |title=Gnawing at History: The Rhetoric of Holocaust Denial |journal=Midwest Quarterly |volume=39 |issue=1 |page=76 |url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?hid=106&amp;sid=132224f1-624f-44b2-9db4-f89053786c68%40sessionmgr111&amp;vid=4&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=9711065531 |accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, they rely on facts to grab the readers’ attention. These facts, however, are strung by what Narjarian calls “fabricated decorum” and are re-interpreted for their use. For example, they pay particular attention to inconsistencies in numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Najarian |first1=James |year=1997 |title=Gnawing at History: The Rhetoric of Holocaust Denial |journal=Midwest Quarterly |volume=39 |issue=1 |page=80 |url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?hid=106&amp;sid=132224f1-624f-44b2-9db4-f89053786c68%40sessionmgr111&amp;vid=4&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=9711065531 |accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holocaust denial propaganda in all forms has shown to influence the audiences that it reaches. In fact, even the well-educated—that is, college graduates and current university students alike—are susceptible to such propaganda when it is presented before them. This stems from the growing disbelief that audiences feel after being exposed to such information, especially since Holocaust witnesses themselves are decreasing in number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lasson |first=Kenneth |year=2007 |title=Defending Truth: Legal and Psychological Aspects of Holocaust Denial |journal=Current Psychology |volume=26 |page=256 |url=http://www.schaler.net/Lasson.pdf |accessdate=February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies centered on the psychological effects of Holocaust denial propaganda confirm this assertion.  Linda M. Yelland and William F. Stone, in particular, show that Denial essays decrease readers’ belief in the Holocaust, regardless of their prior Holocaust awareness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yelland |first1=Linda M. |last2=Stone |first2=William F. |year=1996 |title=Belief in the Holocaust: Effects of Personality and Propaganda |journal=Political Psychology |volume=17 |issue=3 |page=559 |jstor=3791968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions to Holocaust denial==
{{Further|Criticism of Holocaust denial}}

===Types of reaction===
Scholarly response to Holocaust denial can be roughly divided into three categories: Some academics refuse to engage Holocaust deniers or their arguments at all, on grounds that doing so lends them unwarranted legitimacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Wilhelm Heitmeyer]] and John Hagan, International Handbook of Violence Research, Springer: 2003&lt;/ref&gt; A second group of scholars, typified by the American historian [[Deborah Lipstadt]], have tried to raise awareness of the methods and motivations of Holocaust denial without legitimizing the deniers themselves. &quot;We need not waste time or effort answering the deniers' contentions,&quot; Lipstadt wrote. &quot;It would be never-ending&amp;nbsp;... Their commitment is to an ideology and their 'findings' are shaped to support it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Lipstadt, 1992 interview with Ken Stern of the American Jewish Committee&lt;/ref&gt; A third group, typified by the [[Nizkor Project]], responds to arguments and claims made by Holocaust denial groups by pointing out inaccuracies and errors in their evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Hilliard &amp; Michael C. Keith. ''Waves of Rancor: tuning in the radical right'', M.E. Sharpe, 1999, ISBN 0-7656-0131-1, p. 250&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Wolfish &amp; Gordon S. Smith. ''Who Is Afraid of the State?: Canada in a World of Multiple Centres of Power'', University of Toronto Press, 2001, ISBN 0-8020-8388-9, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even scholarly responses, however, can trigger vigorous rebuttals. In 1996, the British historian [[David Irving]] brought [[Irving v Penguin Books and Lipstadt|a civil defamation suit]] against Lipstadt and her publisher, stemming from Lipstadt's book ''[[Denying the Holocaust]]'', in which she named Irving as &quot;one of the more dangerous&quot; Holocaust deniers, because he was a published author, and was viewed by some as a legitimate military historian. He was &quot;familiar with historical evidence,&quot; she wrote, and &quot;bends it until it conforms with his ideological leanings and political agenda.&quot; Irving, who appeared as a defense witness in [[Ernst Zündel]]'s [[R. v. Zundel|trial]] in Canada, and once declared at a rally of Holocaust deniers that &quot;more women died [[Chappaquiddick incident|in the back seat of Edward Kennedy's car]] than ever died in a gas chamber at [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Holocaust Denial on Trial [http://www.hdot.org/trial HDOT.org]. Retrieved September 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that Lipstadt's allegation damaged his reputation. After a two-month trial in London, the trial judge issued a 333-page ruling against Irving.&lt;ref&gt;Bazyler, Prof. Michael J: Holocaust Denial Laws and Other Legislation Criminalizing Promotion of Nazism.

A number of public figures and scholars have spoken out against Holocaust denial. The [[American Historical Association]], the oldest and largest society of historians and teachers of history in the United States, states that Holocaust denial is &quot;at best, a form of academic fraud.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;adaaha&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gerstenfeld|first=Phyllis B.|coauthors=Grant, Diana Ruth|title=Crimes of hate: selected readings|publisher=SAGE|location=p. 190.|year=2004|page=391|isbn=0-7619-2943-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. William Shulman, director of the Holocaust Research Center, described the denial &quot;as if these people [in the Holocaust] were killed twice&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Sophia Chang [http://www.timesledger.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=13569863&amp;BRD=2676&amp;PAG=461&amp;dept_id=542415&amp;rfi=6 Times Ledger], December 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; a sentiment echoed by literary theorist [[Jean Baudrillard]], who argued that &quot;Forgetting the extermination is part of the extermination itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Golsan, 130&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] said: &quot;Remembering is a necessary rebuke to those who say the Holocaust never happened or has been exaggerated. Holocaust denial is the work of bigots; we must reject their false claims whenever, wherever and by whomever they are made.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4653666.stm Annan condemns Holocaust denial], January 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Holocaust survivor and Nobel Prize winner [[Elie Wiesel]] calls the Holocaust &quot;the most documented tragedy in [[recorded history]]. Never before has a tragedy elicited so much witness from the killers, from the victims and even from the bystanders—millions of pieces here in the museum what you have, all other museums, archives in the thousands, in the millions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/eliewiesel/resources/millennium.html Millennium Evening with Elie Wiesel]&lt;/ref&gt; He made a similar statement on a special edition of ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' after his final trip to [[Auschwitz]], along with host Winfrey.

In January 2007, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] condemned &quot;without reservation any denial of the Holocaust&quot;, though Iran disassociated itself from the resolution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=21355&amp;Cr=holocaust&amp;Cr1 UN Assembly condemns Holocaust denial by consensus; Iran disassociates itself], U.N.

===Former SS members===
Critics of Holocaust denial also include members of the Auschwitz SS. Camp physician and SS-''[[Untersturmführer]]'' [[Hans Münch]] considered the facts of Auschwitz &quot;so firmly determined that one cannot have any doubt at all&quot;, and described those who negate what happened at the camp as &quot;malevolent&quot; people who have &quot;personal interest to want to bury in silence things that cannot be buried in silence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Frankfurter, Bernhard.

===Holocaust denial and antisemitism===
Holocaust denial is generally viewed as antisemitic.&lt;ref name=&quot;antisemitic&quot;/&gt; The ''Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity'', for example, defines Holocaust denial as &quot;a new form of anti-Semitism, but one that hinges on age-old motifs&quot;.&lt;ref name=EGCAH45&gt;&quot;Holocaust denial is a new form of anti-Semitism, but one that hinges on age-old motifs.&quot; Dinah Shelton, ''Encyclopedia of Genocide and Crimes Against Humanity'', Macmillan Reference, 2005, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Anti-Defamation League]] has stated that &quot;Holocaust denial is a contemporary form of the classic anti-Semitic doctrine of the evil, manipulative and threatening world Jewish conspiracy&quot;&lt;ref name=ADLguide&gt;[http://www.adl.org/Holocaust/theory.asp &quot;Introduction: Denial as Anti-Semitism&quot;], Holocaust Denial: An Online Guide to Exposing and Combating Anti-Semitic Propaganda, [[Anti-Defamation League]] website. Retrieved August 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and French historian Valérie Igounet has written that &quot;Holocaust denial is a convenient polemical substitute for anti-semitism.&quot;&lt;ref name=Igounet&gt;Igounet, Valérie. [http://mondediplo.com/1998/05/08igou &quot;Holocaust denial is part of a strategy&quot;], ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'', May 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (now the [[Fundamental Rights Agency]]) published a &quot;working definition&quot; of antisemitism which gave as an example of the way that antisemitism might manifest itself, &quot;denying the fact, scope, mechanisms (e.g. gas chambers) or intentionality of the genocide of the Jewish people at the hands of National Socialist Germany and its supporters and accomplices during World War II (the Holocaust)&quot;.&lt;ref name=EFRAWorkingDefinition&gt;{{PDF|[http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/material/pub/AS/AS-WorkingDefinition-draft.pdf Working Definition of Antisemitism]|33.8&amp;nbsp;KB}}, [[Fundamental Rights Agency]], March 16, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that not all Holocaust deniers are necessarily antisemitic. In a defense of professor of literature and Holocaust denier [[Robert Faurisson]], and of having an essay of his included in the introduction of one of Faurisson's books, linguist and political activist [[Noam Chomsky]] stated &quot;I see no antisemitic implications in denial of the existence of gas chambers, or even denial of the holocaust&quot;.&lt;ref name=Rubinstein&gt;[[William Rubinstein|Rubinstein, William]]. {{PDF|[http://www.paulbogdanor.com/chomsky/rubinstein.pdf &quot;Chomsky and the neo-Nazis&quot;]|334&amp;nbsp;KB}}, ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'', October 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Chomsky would later elaborate:
{{quote|I was asked whether the fact that a person denies the existence of gas chambers does not prove that he is an anti-Semite. I wrote back what every sane person knows: no, of course it does not. A person might believe that Hitler exterminated 6&amp;nbsp;million Jews in some other way without being an anti-Semite. Since the point is trivial and disputed by no one, I do not know why we are discussing it. In that context, I made a further point: even denial of the Holocaust would not prove that a person is an anti-Semite. I presume that that point too is not subject to contention. Thus if a person ignorant of modern history were told of the Holocaust and refused to believe that humans are capable of such monstrous acts, we would not conclude that he is an anti-Semite.&lt;ref name=ChomskyAddendum&gt;[http://chomsky.info/letters/1989----.htm &quot;The Faurisson Affair: Noam Chomsky writes to Lawrence K. Kolodney Circa 1989–1991&quot;], Noam Chomsky website. Retrieved August 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a defense of Holocaust denier Bishop [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]] against the charge of being antisemitic, the journalist and writer [[Kevin Myers]] argued &quot;It is not anti-Semitic to make a fool of yourself in public about a historical fact. It is anti-Semitic to preach or promote a dislike of Jews because they are Jews, which is what Bishop Williamson has not done.&quot;&lt;ref name=Myers&gt;[http://www.independent.ie/opinion/columnists/kevin-myers/antisemitic-imams-will-no-more-see-inside-a-jail-than-a-synagogue-1671518.html 'Anti-Semitic imams will no more see inside a jail than a synagogue'], ''[[Irish Independent]]'', March 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Walter Reich, psychiatrist and then senior scholar at the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]], one-time director of the [[United States Holocaust Memorial Museum]], and now professor of international affairs at [[George Washington University]]:{{quote|The primary motivation for most deniers is anti-Semitism, and for them the Holocaust is an infuriatingly inconvenient fact of history. After all, the Holocaust has generally been recognized as one of the most terrible crimes that ever took place, and surely the very emblem of evil in the modern age. If that crime was a direct result of anti-Semitism taken to its logical end, then anti-Semitism itself, even when expressed in private conversation, is inevitably discredited among most people. What better way to rehabilitate anti-Semitism, make anti-Semitic arguments seem once again respectable in civilized discourse and even make it acceptable for governments to pursue anti-Semitic policies than by convincing the world that the great crime for which anti-Semitism was blamed simply never happened—indeed, that it was nothing more than a frame-up invented by the Jews, and propagated by them through their control of the media? What better way, in short, to make the world safe again for anti-Semitism than by denying the Holocaust?&lt;ref name=ReichNYT&gt;Reich, Walter. [http://www.nytimes.com/1993/07/11/books/erasing-the-holocaust.html?pagewanted=11 &quot;Erasing the Holocaust&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 11, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The French historian [[Pierre Vidal-Naquet]] described the motivation of deniers more succinctly:{{quote|One revives the dead in order the better to strike the living.&lt;ref name=Vidal-NaquetMotivations&gt;[[Pierre Vidal-Naquet|Vidal-Naquet, Pierre]], [http://www.anti-rev.org/textes/VidalNaquet92a/part-4.html &quot;A Paper Eichmann (1980)&amp;nbsp;– Anatomy of a Lie: On the Revisionist Method&quot;], in ''Assassins of Memory'', [[Columbia University Press]], 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Laws against Holocaust denial==
{{Main|Laws against Holocaust denial}}
Holocaust denial is explicitly or implicitly illegal in 17 countries: Austria, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, Israel, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, and Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;Lechtholz-Zey, Jacqueline: Laws Banning Holocaust Denial.  [http://www.genocidepreventionnow.org/2010/06/laws-banning-holocaust-denial.html Genocide Prevention Now.]. Retrieved September 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The European Union's Framework decision on Racism and Xenophobia states that denying or grossly trivializing &quot;crimes of genocide&quot; should be made &quot;punishable in all [[EU Member States]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cms_data/docs/pressdata/en/misc/93739.pdf See Luxembourg, April 19, 2007, 8665/07 (Presse 84)]&lt;/ref&gt;  Slovakia criminalized denial of fascist crimes in general in late 2001; in May 2005, the term &quot;Holocaust&quot; was explicitly adopted by the penal code and in 2009, it became illegal to deny any act regarded by an international criminal court as genocide. The Parliament of Hungary adopted the most recent legislation, which declared denial or trivialization of the Holocaust a crime punishable by up to three years imprisonment, in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://index.hu/belfold/2010/02/22/buntetheto_a_holokauszttagadas/ Index.hu Atricle (in Hungarian)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Such legislation remains controversial.  In October 2007, a tribunal declared Spain's Holocaust denial law [[unconstitutional]].&lt;ref&gt;By way of [http://www.tribunalconstitucional.es/jurisprudencia/Stc2007/STC2007-5152-2000.html judgment of November 7, 2007] of the [[Constitutional Court of Spain]], which ruled the criminalization to be unconstitutional and void.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Italy rejected a denial law proposing a prison sentence of up to four years.  In 2006 the Netherlands rejected a draft law proposing a maximum sentence of one year on denial of genocidal acts in general, although specifically denying the Holocaust remains a criminal offense there. The United Kingdom has twice rejected [[Holocaust denial laws]]. Denmark and Sweden have also rejected such legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/19/world/europe/19iht-eu.4.5359640.html EU adopts measure outlawing Holocaust denial&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. By Dan Bilefsky. ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 19, 2007 .&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of deniers have been prosecuted under various countries' denial laws.  French literature professor [[Robert Faurisson]], for example, was convicted and punished under the [[Gayssot Act]] in 1990.  Some historians oppose such laws, among them [[Vidal-Naquet]], an outspoken critic of Faurisson, on the grounds that denial legislation imposes &quot;historical truth as legal truth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''To live with Faurisson? Any other attitude would imply that we were imposing historical truth as legal truth, which is a dangerous attitude available to other fields of application.'' [http://www.anti-rev.org/textes/VidalNaquet92a/ Pierre Vidal-Naquet: A Paper Eichmann (1980)&amp;nbsp;– Anatomy of a Lie (10) ]&lt;/ref&gt; Other academics favor [[criminalization]].  Holocaust denial, they contend, is &quot;the worst form of racism and its most respectable version because it pretends to be a research.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;François de Smet, Philosopher of the [[Université Libre de Bruxelles|ULB]]: ''Le négationnisme est l’une des pires formes de racisme. Elle en est aussi sa version la plus « respectable », se parant des oripeaux de la science. C’est pour cela qu’il faut continuer à le sanctionner'', in ''[[La Libre Belgique]]'', on April 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the Belgian Senate the Minister of Justice [[Laurette Onkelinx]] compared laws criminalizing Holocaust denial with those condemning [[incitement to ethnic or racial hatred]] in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Focus on Allied war crimes in Holocaust denial literature==
The focus on supposed Allied atrocities during the war has also been a theme in Holocaust denial literature, particularly in countries where outright denial of the Holocaust is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen E. Atkins, &quot;Holocaust denial as an international movement&quot;, ABC-CLIO, 2009, pg. 105&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian [[Deborah Lipstadt]], the concept of &quot;comparable Allied wrongs&quot; such as the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|post-war expulsions]] and alleged [[Allied war crimes during World War II|Allied war crimes]] like the [[bombing of Dresden]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Evans| first = Richard| authorlink = Richard J. Evans| title = Dresden and Holocaust Denial| work=David Irving, Hitler and Holocaust Denial: Electronic Edition| year = 1996| url = http://www.holocaustdenialontrial.org/en/trial/defense/evans/520e| accessdate =January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is at the center of, and a continuously repeated theme of, contemporary [[Historical revisionism (negationism)#Politically motivated historical revisionism|Holocaust denial]]; phenomenon she calls &quot;immoral equivalencies&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Lipstadt, &quot;Denying the Holocaust: The Growing Assault on Truth and Memory&quot;, Bt Bound, 1999, pg. 41&lt;/ref&gt; Pierre Vidal-Naquet pointed out the same phenomenon in the earlier version of ''Les Assassins de la mémoire'' under the title ''Auschwitz et le tiers monde'' (''Les Assassins de la mémoire'', Paris, 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;170–180), and accurately about the declarations of [[Klaus Barbie]]'s lawyer [[Jacques Vergès]]. In 1977, [[Martin Broszat]] in a review of [[David Irving]]'s book ''[[Hitler's War]]'' maintained that the picture of World War II drawn by Irving was done in a such way to imply moral equivalence between the actions of the Axis and Allied states with both sides equally guilty of terrible crimes, leading to Hitler's &quot;fanatical, destructive will to annihilate&quot; being downgraded to being &quot;no longer an exceptional phenomenon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Broszat, Martin &quot;Hitler and the Genesis of the 'Final Solution': An Assessment of David Irving's Theses&quot; pages 390–429 from ''Aspects of the Third Reich'' edited by H.W. Koch page 395.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other genocide denials==
{{Main|Genocide denial}}

Other acts of genocide have met similar attempts to deny and minimize. [[Gregory H. Stanton]], formerly of the US State Department and the founder of Genocide Watch, lists denial as the final stage of a genocide development: &quot;Denial is the eighth stage that always follows a genocide. It is among the surest indicators of further genocidal massacres. The perpetrators of genocide dig up the mass graves, burn the bodies, try to cover up the evidence and intimidate the witnesses. They deny that they committed any crimes, and often blame what happened on the victims.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Stanton, [http://www.genocidewatch.org/eightstages.htm Eight Stages of Genocide Denial], Genocide Watch&lt;/ref&gt;
