'''Prussia''' ({{Audio-de|Preußen|De-Preußen-2.ogg}}; [[Latin]]: ''Borussia'', ''Prutenia''; {{lang-lv| Prūsija}}; {{lang-lt|Prūsija}}; {{lang-pl|Prusy}}; [[Old Prussian language|Old Prussian]]: ''Prūsa''; {{lang-da|Prøjsen}}; {{lang-ru|Пру́ссия}}) was a German kingdom and historic state originating out of the [[Duchy of Prussia]] and the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]]. For centuries, the [[House of Hohenzollern]] ruled Prussia, successfully expanding its size by way of an unusually well-organized and effective army. Prussia shaped the [[history of Germany]], with its capital in [[History of Berlin|Berlin]] after 1451.  By 1871, the smaller German city states were merged with Prussia, resulting in the creation of the German Empire.  In November 1918 the royalty abdicated and the nobility lost most of its political power. Prussia was effectively abolished in 1932, and officially abolished in 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark, Christopher 2006&quot;&gt;Christopher Clark, ''Iron Kingdom: The Rise and Downfall of Prussia, 1600–1947'' (2006) is the standard history.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Prussia'' derives from the [[Old Prussians]]. In the 13th century, &quot;Old Prussia&quot; was conquered by [[Prussian Crusade|German crusaders]], the [[Teutonic Knights]]. In 1308 Teutonic Knights conquered the formerly Polish region of [[Pomerelia]] with [[Gdańsk]] (Danzig). Their [[State of the Teutonic Order|monastic state]] was mostly [[Germanisation|Germanized]] through [[Ostsiedlung|immigration from central and western Germany]] and in the south it was [[Polonisation|Polonized]] by settlers from [[Masovia]]. After the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)|Second Peace of Thorn]] of 1466, Prussia was split into the western [[Royal Prussia]], a province of Poland, and the eastern part, since 1525 called [[Duchy of Prussia]], a fief of the [[Crown of Poland]] up to 1657. The [[Brandenburg-Prussia|union of Brandenburg and the Duchy of Prussia]] in 1618 led to the proclamation of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] in 1701.

Prussia achieved its greatest importance in the 18th and 19th centuries. During the 18th century, it became a great European power under the reign of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick the Great]] (1740–1786). During the 19th century, Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]] united the German principalities into a  &quot;[[Kleindeutsche Lösung|Lesser Germany]]&quot; which would exclude the [[Austrian Empire]].

After 1810 Prussia dominated Germany politically, economically, and in population, and was the core of the unified [[North German Confederation]] formed in 1867, which became part of the [[German Empire]] or ''[[Deutsches Reich]]'' in 1871.

The term &quot;Prussian&quot; has often been used, especially outside of Germany, to emphasize the professionalism, aggressiveness, militarism, and conservatism of the [[Junker|Junker class]] of landed aristocrats in the East who dominated Prussia into the 20th century.

==Symbols==
{{Main|Coat of arms of Prussia}}

The main [[coat of arms of Prussia]], as well as the [[flag of Prussia]], depicted a [[black eagle]] on a white background.

The black and white national colours were already used by the [[Teutonic Knights]] and by the [[Hohenzollern dynasty]]. The Teutonic Order wore a white coat [[embroidery|embroidered]] with a black cross with gold insert and black imperial eagle. The combination of the black and white colours with the white and red [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] colours of the free cities [[Bremen]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Free City of Lübeck|Lübeck]] as well as of [[Brandenburg]] resulted in the black-white-red commercial flag of the [[North German Confederation]], which became the flag of the German Empire in 1871.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

''[[Jedem das Seine|Suum cuique]]'' (&quot;to each, his own&quot;), the motto of the [[Order of the Black Eagle]] created by King [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]] in 1701, was often associated with the whole of Prussia. The [[Iron Cross]], a military decoration created by King [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] in 1813, was also commonly associated with the country.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The region, originally populated by Baltic [[Old Prussians]] who were Christianised, became a favoured location for immigration by (later mainly Protestant) [[Germans]] (''see [[Ostsiedlung]]''), as well as [[Poles]] and [[Lithuanians]] along the border regions.

Before its abolition, the territory of the [[Kingdom of Prussia]] included the provinces of [[West Prussia Province|West Prussia]], [[East Prussia Province|East Prussia]], [[Brandenburg Province|Brandenburg]], [[Saxony Province|Saxony]] (including most of the present-day state of [[Saxony-Anhalt]] and parts of the state of [[Thuringia]] in Germany), [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Pomerania]], [[Rhineland Province|Rhineland]], [[Westphalia Province|Westphalia]], [[Silesia Province|Silesia]] (without [[Czech Silesia|Austrian Silesia]]), [[Lusatia]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Hanover Province|Hanover]], [[Hesse-Nassau Province|Hesse-Nassau]], and a small detached area in the south called [[Hohenzollern Province|Hohenzollern]], the ancestral home of the Prussian ruling family. The land that Teutonic Prussia occupied was flat and covered with rich soil. The land was perfectly suited to the large-scale raising of wheat.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Koch, ''A History of Prussia'' (1978) p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; The rise of early Prussia was based on the raising and selling of wheat. Teutonic Prussia became known as the &quot;bread basket of Western Europe&quot; (in German, ''Kornkammer'', or granary). The port cities of Stettin ([[Szczecin]]) in Pomerania, Danzig ([[Gdansk]]) in Prussia, [[Riga]] in Livonia, Koenigsberg ([[Kaliningrad]]) and Memel ([[Klaipėda]]) rose on the back of this wheat production. Wheat production and trade brought Prussia into close relationship with the [[Hanseatic League]] during the period of time from 1356 (official founding of the Hanseatic League) until the decline of the League in about 1500.

The expansion of Prussia based on its connection with the [[Hanseatic League]] cut both [[Poland]] and [[Lithuania]] off from the coast of the [[Baltic Sea]] and trade abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Hoyt &amp; Stanley Chodorow, ''Europe in Middle Ages'' (1976) p. 629.&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that Poland and Lithuania would be traditional enemies of Prussia—which was still called the Teutonic Knights.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Davies, ''God's Playground: A History of Poland Vol. l'' (1982) p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, Prussia's population numbered 24.69 million, accounting for 60% of the [[German Empire]]'s population.&lt;ref name=Handbuch&gt;{{cite book|first=Otto|last=Büsch|coauthors=Ilja Mieck, Wolfgang Neugebauer|title=Handbuch der preussischen Geschichte|pages=42|isbn=978-3-11-008322-4|volume=2|editor=Otto Büsch|language=German|year=1992|publisher=de Gruyter|location=Berlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, the population had increased to 40.17 million (62% of the Empire's population).&lt;ref name=Handbuch/&gt; In 1914, Prussia had an area of 354,490&amp;nbsp;km². In May 1939 Prussia had an area of 297,007&amp;nbsp;km² and a population of 41,915,040 inhabitants. The [[Principality of Neuenburg]], now the [[Canton of Neuchâtel]] in [[Switzerland]], was a part of the Prussian kingdom from 1707 to 1848.

Although Prussia was dominated by [[Protestantism|Protestant Germans]] ([[Lutheranism|Lutherans]] along with some [[Reformed churches|Reformed]]), it contained millions of [[Catholic Church|Catholics]] in the west and in Poland. East Prussia's southern region of [[Masuria]] was mostly made up of Germanised Protestant [[Mazurian ethnic group|Masur]]s. There were numerous Catholic populations in the Rhineland and parts of Westphalia. In addition, West Prussia, [[Warmia]], [[Silesia]], and the [[Province of Posen]] had predominantly Catholic populations.

In 1871, approximately 2.4 million Poles lived in Prussia, constituting the largest minority.&lt;ref name=Handbuch/&gt; Other minorities were Jews, Danes, [[Frisians]], [[Kashubians]] (72,500 in 1905), [[Masurians]] (248,000 in 1905), [[Lithuanians]] (101,500 in 1905), [[Walloons]], [[Czechs]] and [[Sorbs]].&lt;ref name=Handbuch/&gt;

The area of [[Greater Poland]], where the Polish nation had originated, became the [[Province of Posen]] after the [[Partitions of Poland]]. Poles in this Polish-majority province (62% Polish, 38% German) resisted German rule. Also, the southeast portion of Silesia ([[Upper Silesia]]) had a Polish majority. But Catholics, ethnic Poles and other Slavs, and Jews did not have equal status with Protestants&lt;ref&gt;Hajo Holborn, ''History of Modern Germany: 1648–1840'' 2:274&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919 the [[Second Polish Republic]] was granted not only these two areas, but also areas with a German majority in the Province of West Prussia. After [[World War II]], East Prussia, Silesia, most of Pomerania, and the eastern part of Brandenburg were annexed by either the Soviet Union or Poland.

==Early history==
{{History of Brandenburg and Prussia}}
{{Main|Monastic state of the Teutonic Knights|Duchy of Prussia}}

[[Image:Ordensstaat-kirchlich.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Situation after the conquest in the late 13th century. Areas in purple under control of the Monastic State of the Teutonic Knights]]
[[Image:Teutonic state 1466.png|thumb|left|200px|After the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)]]. Teutonic Order state: orange]]

In 1211 [[Andrew II of Hungary]] granted [[Burzenland]] in Transylvania as a [[fiefdom]] to the [[Teutonic Knights]]. In 1225, Andrew II expelled the Teutonic Knights from Transylvania, and they had to transfer to the Baltic Sea. [[Konrad I of Masovia|Konrad I]], the Polish Duke of [[Masovia]], unsuccessfully attempted to conquer [[Prussia (region)|pagan Prussia]] in crusades in 1219 and 1222.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Henry Lewinski Corwin]] {{cite book|last=Lewinski-Corwin|first=Edward Henry|title=A History of Prussia|publisher=The Polish Book Importing Company|location=New York|year=1917|pages=628|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Ec4eAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;dq=lizard+union#PRA2-PA45,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1226 Duke Konrad invited the Teutonic Knights, a German [[military order]] of [[Crusades|crusading]] knights, headquartered in the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]] at [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], to conquer the Baltic [[Old Prussians|Prussian tribes]] on his borders.

During 60 years of [[Prussian uprisings|struggles against the Old Prussians]], the order created an independent state which came to control Prūsa. After the [[Livonian Brothers of the Sword]] joined the Teutonic Order in 1237 they also controlled [[Livonia]] (now [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]]). Around 1252 they finished the conquest of the northernmost Prussian tribe of the [[Skalvians]] as well as the western Baltic [[Curonians]] and erected the [[Memel Castle]], which developed into the major port city of [[Klaipėda|Memel (Klaipėda)]]. The final border between Prussia and the adjoining [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] was determined in the [[Treaty of Melno]] in 1422.

The [[Hanseatic League]] was officially formed in 1356 as a group of trading cities in northern Europe which came to have a monopoly on all trade leaving the interior of Europe and Scandinavia and on all sailing trade in the Baltic Sea for foreign countries.&lt;ref&gt;Robert S. Hoyt and Stanley Chodorow (1976) ''Europe in the Middle Ages''. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich. ISBN 0-15-524712-3 p. 629.&lt;/ref&gt; The businessmen of the interior Sweden, Denmark and Poland came to feel oppressed by the Hanseatic League.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In the course of the [[Ostsiedlung]] process, settlers were invited in, a majority of them Germans. This brought about changes in the ethnic composition as well as in language, culture and law. [[Low German]] became the dominant language.

The Knights were subordinate to the pope and the [[Holy Roman Emperor|emperor]]. Their initially close relationship with the Polish Crown deteriorated after they conquered Polish-controlled [[Pomerelia]] and [[Gdańsk|Danzig (Gdańsk)]] in 1308. Eventually Poland and Lithuania, allied through the [[Union of Krewo]] (1385), defeated the Knights in the [[Battle of Grunwald]] (Tannenberg) in 1410.

The [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)|Thirteen Years' War]] (1454–1466) began when the [[Prussian Confederation]], a coalition of [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities of western Prussia, rebelled against the Order and requested help from the Polish king. The Teutonic Knights were forced to acknowledge the sovereignty of and to pay tribute to King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] of Poland in the [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)]], losing western Prussia ([[Royal Prussia]]) to Poland in the process. Pursuant to the Second Peace of Thorn, two Prussian states were established&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Stone, ''A History of East Central Europe'', (2001), p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

After admitting the dependence of Prussia to the Polish crown, [[Albert of Prussia]] receives [[Ducal Prussia]] as a [[fief]] from King [[Sigismund I the Old]] of [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Poland]] in 1525.]]

In 1525, Grand Master [[Albert I, Duke of Prussia|Albert of Brandenburg-Ansbach]], a member of a cadet branch of the [[House of Hohenzollern]], became a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Protestant and secularised the Order's remaining Prussian territories into the [[Duchy of Prussia]].&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Koch, ''A History of Prussia'' p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the area east of the mouth of the [[Vistula]] River, later sometimes called &quot;Prussia proper&quot;. For the first time, these lands came into the hands of a branch of the Hohenzollern family. (The Hohenzollern dynasty had ruled the [[Margraviate of Brandenburg]] to the west, a German state centered on [[Berlin]], since the 15th century.) Furthermore, with his renunciation of the Order, Albert could now marry and produce legitimate heirs.

==Brandenburg-Prussia==
{{Main|Brandenburg-Prussia}}

Brandenburg and Prussia were unified two generations later. Anna, granddaughter of Albert I and daughter of Duke [[Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia|Albert Frederick]] (reigned 1568–1618), married her cousin [[Prince-Elector|Elector]] [[John Sigismund, Margrave of Brandenburg|John Sigismund]] of [[Margraviate of Brandenburg|Brandenburg]]. Upon the death of Albert Frederick in 1618, who died without male heirs, John Sigismund was granted the right of succession to the Duchy of Prussia, which was still a Polish fief. From this time the Duchy of Prussia was in [[personal union]] with the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The resulting state, known as [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], consisted of geographically disconnected territories in Prussia, Brandenburg, and the [[Rhineland]] lands of [[Duchy of Cleves|Cleves]] and [[County of Mark|Mark]].

[[File:Keurvorst Frederik Willem I en Louise Henriëtte van Oranje.jpg|thumb|200px|The &quot;[[Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg|Great Elector]]&quot; and [[Luise Henriette of Nassau|his wife]]]]

During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the disconnected Hohenzollern lands were repeatedly marched across by various armies, especially the occupying [[Swedish Empire|Swedes]]. The ineffective and militarily weak Margrave [[George William, Margrave of Brandenburg|George William]] (1619–1640) fled from Berlin to [[Königsberg]], the historic capital of the [[Duchy of Prussia]], in 1637. His successor, [[Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William I]] (1640–1688), reformed the [[Prussian Army|army]] to defend the lands.

Frederick William I went to [[Warsaw]] in 1641 to render [[homage]] to King [[Władysław IV Vasa]] of Poland for the Duchy of Prussia, which was still held in [[fief]] from the Polish crown. In the first phase of the [[Second Northern War]] (1654–1660), he took the duchy [[Treaty of Königsberg (1656)|as a fief from the Swedish king]] who later granted him full sovereignty in the [[Treaty of Labiau]]. In 1657, this grant was renewed by the Polish king in the treaties of [[Treaty of Wehlau|Wehlau]] and [[Treaty of Bromberg|Bromberg]]. With Prussia, the Brandenburg [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern dynasty]] now held a territory free of any feudal obligations, which constituted the basis for their later elevation to kings.

Frederick William I became known as the &quot;Great Elector&quot; for his achievements in organizing the electorate, which he accomplished by establishing an absolute monarchy (see [[Absolutism (European history)|absolutism]]) in Brandenburg-Prussia. Above all, he emphasized the importance of a [[Prussian Army|powerful military]] to protect the state's disconnected territories, while the [[Edict of Potsdam]] opened Brandenburg-Prussia for immigration of [[Protestantism|Protestant]] refugees, and he established a bureaucracy to carry out state business efficiently.

==Kingdom of Prussia==
[[Image:Friedrich I of Prussia.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]], [[King in Prussia]]]]
{{Main|Kingdom of Prussia}}
On 18 January 1701, Frederick William's son, Elector Frederick III, upgraded Prussia from a duchy to a kingdom and crowned himself King [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]]. To avoid offending [[Poland]], where a part of the old Prussia lay, [[Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor|Leopold I]], emperor of the Holy Roman Empire where most of the lands of Prussia lay, allowed Frederick only to title himself &quot;[[King in Prussia|King ''in'' Prussia]]&quot;, not &quot;King ''of'' Prussia&quot;.

[[Image:Acprussiamap2.gif|thumb|left|300px|Growth of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]], 1600–1795]]
The state of [[Brandenburg-Prussia]] became commonly known as &quot;Prussia&quot;, although most of its territory, in Brandenburg, Pomerania, and western Germany, lay outside of Prussia proper. The Prussian state grew in splendour during the reign of Frederick I, who sponsored the arts at the expense of the treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' ch 4&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick I was succeeded by his son, [[Frederick William I of Prussia|Frederick William I]] (1713–1740) the austere &quot;Soldier King&quot;, who did not care for the arts but was thrifty and practical.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} He is considered the creator of the vaunted Prussian bureaucracy and the professionalized standing army, which he developed into one of the most powerful in Europe, although his troops [[Siege of Stralsund (1711–1715)|only briefly saw action]] during the [[Great Northern War]]. In view of the size of the army in relation to the total population, [[André Boniface Louis Riqueti de Mirabeau|Mirabeau]] said later: ''Prussia, is not a state with an army, but an army with a state.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediamonitors.net/uri79.html |title=The Army has a State |first=Uri |last=Avnery |publisher=Media Monitors Network |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Frederick William settled more than 20,000 Protestant refugees from [[Salzburg]] in thinly populated eastern Prussia, which was eventually extended to the west bank of the [[Neman River|Memel]] river, and other regions.

The king died in 1740 and was succeeded by his son, [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]], whose accomplishments led to his reputation as &quot;Frederick the Great&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;H. W. Koch, ''A History of Prussia''  pp. 100–102.&lt;/ref&gt;  As crown prince, Frederick had focused, primarily, on philosophy and the arts.&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Asprey, ''Frederick the Great: The Magnificent Enigma'' (1986) pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was an accomplished flute player. In 1740, Prussian troops crossed over the undefended border of Silesia and occupied Schweidnitz.  [[Silesia]] was the richest province of Habsburg Austria.&lt;ref&gt;Koch, ''A History of Prussia'', p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;   It signalled the beginning of three [[Silesian Wars]] (1740–1763).&lt;ref&gt;Robert A. Kahn, A History of the Habsburg Empire 1526–1918 (1974) p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[First Silesian War]] (1740–1742) and the [[Second Silesian War]] (1744–1745) have, historically, been grouped together with the general European war called the War of Austrian Succession (1740–1748). [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles VI]] had died on October 20, 1740. He was succeeded to the throne by his daughter, [[Maria Theresa]].

By defeating the Austrian Army at the [[Battle of Mollwitz]] on April 10, 1741, Frederick succeeded in conquering [[Lower Silesia]] (the northwestern half of Silesia).&lt;ref&gt;Asprey, ''Frederick the Great: the Magnificent Enigma'', pp. 195–208.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the next year, 1742, he conquered [[Upper Silesia]] (the southeastern half).  Furthermore, in the third Silesian War (usually grouped with the [[Seven Years War]]) Frederick won a victory over Austria at the [[Battle of Lobositz]] on October 1, 1756. On November 3, 1760 Frederick won another battle—the decisive battle—the [[Battle of Torgau]].  With this victory and the overall victory in the Seven Years War, Frederick, [[Anglo-Prussian Alliance|allied with]] [[Great Britain]], [[Hanover]], and [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]], was able to hold the whole of Silesia against a coalition of [[Saxony]], [[Austria]], [[France]], and [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;Hermann Kinder &amp; Werner Hilgermann, ''The Anchor Atlas of World History: Volume 1'' (1974) pp. 282–283.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Voltaire]], a close friend of the king, once described Frederick the Great's Prussia by saying &quot;...it was [[Sparta]] in the morning, [[Athens]] in the afternoon.&quot; From these wars onwards the [[Austria–Prussia rivalry]] dominated German politics until 1866.

Silesia, full of rich soils and prosperous manufacturing towns, became a vital region to Prussia, greatly increasing the nation's area, population, and wealth.&lt;ref&gt;James K. Pollock &amp; Homer Thomas, ''Germany: In Power and Eclipse'' (1952) pp. 297–302.&lt;/ref&gt;  Success on the battleground against Austria and other powers proved Prussia's status as one of the [[great power]]s of Europe. The Silesian Wars began more than a century of rivalry and conflict between Prussia and Austria as the two most powerful states operating within the Holy Roman Empire (although, ironically, both had extensive territory outside the empire).&lt;ref&gt;Marshall Dill, Jr., ''Germany: A Modern History'' (1970) p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1744 the County of [[East Frisia]] fell to Prussia following the extinction of its ruling Cirksena dynasty.
[[Image:Frederick II of Prussia Coloured drawing.png|thumb|upright|King [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]],&lt;br&gt; &quot;the Great&quot;]]
In the last 23 years of his reign until 1786, Frederick II, who understood himself as the &quot;first servant of the state&quot;, promoted the development of Prussian areas such as the [[Oderbruch]]. At the same time he built up Prussia's military power and participated in the [[Partition of Poland|First Partition of Poland]] with Austria and Russia (1772), an act that geographically connected the Brandenburg territories with those of Prussia proper. During this period, he also opened Prussia's borders to immigrants fleeing from religious persecution in other parts of Europe, such as the [[Huguenots]]. Prussia became a safe haven in much the same way that the [[United States]] welcomed immigrants seeking freedom in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark, Iron Kingdom ch 7&quot;&gt;Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' ch 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick the Great, the first &quot;King ''of'' Prussia&quot;, practised [[enlightened absolutism]]. He introduced a general civil code, abolished torture, and established the principle that the Crown would not interfere in matters of justice. He also promoted an advanced secondary education, the forerunner of today's German [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]] (grammar school) system, which prepares the brightest students for university studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kraus, Hans-Christof 2008&quot;&gt;Hans-Christof Kraus.

Jahrhundert]''. Oldenbourg Wissenschaftsverlag, 2008, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Prussian education system]] was  emulated in various countries, including the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark, Iron Kingdom ch 7&quot;/&gt;

===Napoleonic Wars===
{{Main|Napoleonic Wars|Battle of Jena-Auerstedt|War of the Sixth Coalition#War in Germany}}

During the reign of King [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William II]] (1786–1797), Prussia annexed additional Polish territory through further [[Partitions of Poland]]. His successor, [[Frederick William III of Prussia|Frederick William III]] (1797–1840), announced the union of the Prussian [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] and [[Reformed churches]] into [[Prussian Union (Evangelical Christian Church)|one church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark, Iron Kingdom ch 12&quot;&gt;Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' ch 12&lt;/ref&gt;

Prussia took a leading part in the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], but remained quiet for more than a decade due to the [[Peace of Basel]] of 1795, only to go once more to war with France in 1806 as negotiations with that country over the allocation of the spheres of influence in Germany failed. Prussia suffered a devastating defeat against [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s troops in the [[Battle of Jena-Auerstedt]], leading Frederick William III and his family to flee temporarily to [[Klaipėda|Memel]]. Under the [[Treaties of Tilsit]] in 1807, the state lost about one third of its area, including the areas gained from the second and third [[Partitions of Poland]], which now fell to the [[Duchy of Warsaw]]. Beyond that, the king was obliged to pay a large indemnity, to cap his army at 42,000 men, and to allow French troops to be garrisoned throughout Prussia, effectively making the Kingdom a French satellite.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark, Iron Kingdom ch 11&quot;&gt;Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' ch 11&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to this defeat, reformers such as [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl Reichsfreiherr vom und zum Stein|Stein]] and [[Karl August von Hardenberg|Hardenberg]] set about modernising the Prussian state. Among their reforms were the liberation of peasants from [[serfdom]], the [[Jewish Emancipation|Emancipation of Jews]] and making full citizens of them. The school system was rearranged, and in 1818 free trade was introduced. The process of army reform ended in 1813 with the introduction of compulsory military service.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' ch 10&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Napoleon's invasion of Russia|defeat of Napoleon in Russia]], Prussia quit its alliance with France and took part in the [[Sixth Coalition]] during the &quot;Wars of Liberation&quot; (''Befreiungskriege'') against the French occupation. Prussian troops under Marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher]] contributed crucially in the [[Battle of Waterloo]] of 1815 to the final victory over Napoleon. Prussia's reward in 1815 at the [[Congress of Vienna]] was the recovery of her lost territories, as well as the whole of the [[Rhineland]], [[Westphalia]], and some other territories. These western lands were to be of vital importance because they included the [[Ruhr Area]], the centre of Germany's fledgling [[industrialisation]], especially in the arms industry. These territorial gains also meant the doubling of Prussia's population. In exchange, Prussia withdrew from areas of central Poland to allow the creation of [[Congress Poland]] under Russian sovereignty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark, Iron Kingdom ch 11&quot;/&gt;

Prussia emerged from the [[Napoleonic Wars]] as the dominant power in Germany, overshadowing long-time rival Austria, which had abdicated the imperial crown in 1806.{{Citation needed|reason=disputable – at this point, Austria was still very dominant|date=October 2008}} In 1815 Prussia became part of the [[German Confederation]].

[[Image:FriedrichWilhelmIV.jpg|upright|thumb|King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]]]]
The first half of the 19th century saw a prolonged struggle in Germany between [[Liberalism|liberals]], who wanted a united, federal Germany under a democratic constitution, and [[Conservatism|conservatives]], who wanted to maintain Germany as a patchwork of independent, monarchical states, with Prussia and Austria competing for influence. One small movement that signaled a desire for German unification in this period was the [[Burschenschaft]] student movement, by students who encouraged the use of the black-red-gold flag, discussions of a unified German nation, and a progressive, liberal political system. Because of Prussia's size and economic importance, smaller states began to join its free trade area in the 1820s. Prussia benefited greatly from the creation in 1834 of the German Customs Union ([[Zollverein]]), which included most German states but excluded Austria.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clark, Iron Kingdom ch 12&quot;/&gt;

In 1848 the liberals saw an opportunity when [[Revolutions of 1848|revolutions broke out across Europe]]. Alarmed, King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Frederick William IV]] agreed to convene a National Assembly and grant a constitution. When the [[Frankfurt Parliament]] offered Frederick William the crown of a united Germany, he refused on the grounds that he would not accept a crown from a revolutionary assembly without the sanction of Germany's other monarchs.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' ch 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

The Frankfurt Parliament was forced to dissolve in 1849, and Frederick William issued [[Constitution of the Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia's first constitution]] by his own authority in 1850. This conservative document provided for a two-house parliament. The lower house, or ''[[Landtag]]'' was elected by all taxpayers, who were divided into [[Prussian three-class franchise|three classes]] whose votes were weighted according to the amount of taxes paid. Women and those who paid no taxes had no vote. This allowed just over one-third of the voters to choose 85% of the legislature, all but assuring dominance by the more well-to-do men of the population. The upper house, which was later renamed the ''[[Prussian House of Lords|Herrenhaus]]'' (&quot;House of Lords&quot;), was appointed by the king. He retained full executive authority and ministers were responsible only to him. As a result, the grip of the landowning classes, the [[Junker]]s, remained unbroken, especially in the eastern provinces.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, ''Iron Kingdom'' ch 14&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wars of unification===
[[Image:BismarckArbeitszimmer1886rest.jpg||thumb|[[Otto von Bismarck]]]]

In 1862 King [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] appointed [[Otto von Bismarck]] as [[Prime Minister of Prussia]]. Bismarck was determined to defeat both the liberals and conservatives and increase Prussian supremacy and influence among the German states. There has been much debate as to whether Bismarck actually planned to create a united Germany when he set out on this journey, or whether he simply took advantage of the circumstances that fell into place. Certainly his memoirs paint a rosy picture of an idealist, but these were written with the benefit of hindsight. What is clear is that Bismarck curried support from large sections of the people by promising to lead the fight for greater German unification. He eventually guided Prussia through three wars which together brought William the position of [[German Emperor]].

====Schleswig Wars====
The Kingdom of [[Denmark]] was at the time in personal union with the Duchies of [[Schleswig]] and [[Holstein]], both of which had close ties with each other, although only Holstein was part of the [[German Confederation]]. When the Danish government tried to integrate Schleswig, but not Holstein, into the Danish state, Prussia led the German Confederation against Denmark in the [[First War of Schleswig]] (1848–1851). Because [[Russian Empire|Russia]] supported Austria, Prussia also conceded predominance in the German Confederation to Austria in the [[Punctation of Olmütz]] in 1850.

In 1863, Denmark introduced a shared constitution for Denmark and Schleswig. This led to conflict with the German Confederation, which authorized the occupation of Holstein by the Confederation, from which Danish forces withdrew. &lt;!-- not a direct annexation. A similar construction with DK, Schl, and Hol. had existed shortly c. 10 years before --&gt; In 1864, Prussian and Austrian forces crossed the border between Holstein and Schleswig initiating the [[Second War of Schleswig]].&lt;!--Since Schleswig was not a member of the German Confederation, the Confederation could only authorize a Confederate intervention in Holstein, not in non-member Schleswig. That initiative came from Prussia. --&gt; The Austro-Prussian forces defeated the Danes, who surrendered both territories. In the resulting [[Gastein Convention]] of 1865 Prussia took over the administration of Schleswig while Austria assumed that of Holstein.

====Austro-Prussian War====
{{Main|Austro-Prussian War}}
[[Image:ac.prussiamap3.gif|thumb|300px|Expansion of Prussia 1807–1871]]

Bismarck realized that the dual administration of Schleswig and Holstein was only a temporary solution, and tensions rose between Prussia and Austria. The struggle for supremacy in Germany then led to the [[Austro-Prussian War]] (1866), triggered by the dispute over Schleswig and Holstein.

On the Austrian side stood the south German states (including [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] and [[Württemberg]]), some central German states (including [[Kingdom of Saxony|Saxony]]), and [[Kingdom of Hanover|Hanover]] in the north. On the side of Prussia were [[Italy]], most north German states, and some smaller central German states. Eventually, the better-armed Prussian troops won the crucial victory at the [[Battle of Königgrätz]] under [[Helmuth von Moltke the Elder]]. The century-long struggle between Berlin and Vienna for dominance of Germany was now over. As a side show in this war, Prussia defeated Hanover in the Battle of Langensalza. While Hanover hoped in vain for help from Britain (as they had previously been in personal union), Britain stayed out of a confrontation with a continental superpower and Prussia satisfied its desire for merging the once separate territories and gaining strong economic and strategic power, particularly from the full access to the resources of the Ruhr.

Bismarck desired Austria as an ally in the future, and so he declined to annex any Austrian territory. But in the [[Peace of Prague (1866)|Peace of Prague]] in 1866, Prussia annexed four of Austria's allies in northern and central Germany—Hanover, [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel|Hesse-Kassel]] (or Hesse-Cassel), [[Duchy of Nassau|Nassau]] and [[Frankfurt]]. Prussia also won full control of [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. As a result of these territorial gains, Prussia now stretched uninterrupted across the northern two-thirds of Germany and contained two-thirds of Germany's population. The German Confederation was dissolved, and Prussia impelled the 21 states north of the [[Main (river)|Main]] River into forming the [[North German Confederation]].

Prussia was the dominant state in the new confederation, as the kingdom comprised almost four-fifths of the new state's territory and population. Prussia's near-total control over the confederation was secured in the constitution drafted for it by Bismarck in 1867. Executive power was held by a president, assisted by a chancellor responsible only to him. The presidency was a hereditary office of the [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] rulers of Prussia. There was also a two-house parliament. The lower house, or ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]'' (Diet), was elected by universal male [[suffrage]]. The upper house, or ''Bundesrat'' (Federal Council) was appointed by the state governments. The Bundesrat was, in practice, the stronger chamber. Prussia had 17 of 43 votes, and could easily control proceedings through alliances with the other states.

As a result of the peace negotiations, the states south of the Main remained theoretically independent, but received the (compulsory) protection of Prussia. Additionally, mutual defense treaties were concluded. However, the existence of these treaties was kept secret until Bismarck made them public in 1867, when France tried to [[Luxembourg Crisis|acquire Luxembourg]].

====Franco-Prussian War====
{{Main|Franco-Prussian War}}
[[Image:Wilhelm1.jpg|thumb|upright|Emperor [[Wilhelm I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]]]]
The controversy with the [[Second French Empire]] over the candidacy of a [[House of Hohenzollern|Hohenzollern]] to the [[Spain|Spanish]] throne was escalated both by France and Bismarck. With his [[Ems Dispatch]], Bismarck took advantage of an incident in which the French ambassador had approached William. The government of [[Napoleon III of France|Napoleon III]], expecting another civil war among the German states, declared war against Prussia, continuing [[Franco-German enmity]]. Honouring their treaties, however, the German states joined forces and quickly defeated France in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] in 1870. Following victory under Bismarck's and Prussia's leadership, [[Baden]], [[Württemberg]], and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]] — which had remained outside the North German Confederation — accepted incorporation into a united [[German Empire]].

The empire was a &quot;Lesser German&quot; solution (in German, &quot;[[kleindeutsche Lösung]]&quot;) to the question of uniting all German-speaking peoples into one state, because it excluded Austria, which remained connected to [[Hungary]] and whose territories included non-German populations. On 18 January 1871 (the 170th anniversary of the coronation of King [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick I]]), William was proclaimed &quot;German [[Kaiser|Emperor]]&quot; (not &quot;Emperor of Germany&quot;) in the [[Palace of Versailles|Hall of Mirrors]] at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] outside [[Paris]], while [[Siege of Paris (1870–1871)|the French capital was still under siege]].

===German Empire===
{{Main|German Empire}}
[[Image:prussiamap.gif|thumb|upright=1.5|Prussia in the German Empire 1871–1918]]
The two decades after the [[unification of Germany]] were the peak of Prussia's fortunes, but the seeds for potential strife were built into the Prusso-German political system.

The constitution of the German Empire was a slightly amended version of the North German Confederation's constitution. Officially, the German Empire was a federal state. In practice, Prussia's relationship with the rest of the empire was somewhat confusing. The Hohenzollern kingdom included three-fifths of the German territory and two-thirds of its population. The [[German Army (German Empire)|Imperial German Army]] was, in practice, an enlarged Prussian army, although the other kingdoms ([[Bavaria]], [[Saxony]], and [[Württemberg]]) retained their own armies. The imperial crown was a hereditary office of the [[House of Hohenzollern]], the royal house of Prussia. The prime minister of Prussia was, except for two brief periods (January–November 1873 and 1892–94), also imperial chancellor.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} But the empire itself had no right to collect taxes directly from its subjects; the only incomes fully under federal control were the customs duties, common excise duties, and the revenue from postal and telegraph services. While all men above age 25 were eligible to vote in imperial elections, Prussia retained its restrictive three-class voting system. This effectively required the king/emperor and prime minister/chancellor to seek majorities from legislatures elected by two different franchises. In both the kingdom and the empire, the original constituencies were never redrawn to reflect changes in population, meaning that rural areas were grossly overrepresented by the turn of the 20th century.
[[Image:Friedrich III, Deutscher Kaiser.jpg|[[Frederick III, German Emperor|Emperor Frederick III]]|thumb|left|upright]]
As a result, Prussia and the German Empire were something of a paradox. Bismarck knew that his new [[German Reich]] was now a colossus out of all proportion to the rest of the continent. With this in mind, he declared Germany a satisfied power, using his talents to preserve peace, for example at the [[Congress of Berlin]]. Bismarck had barely any success in some of his domestic policies, such as the anti-Catholic ''[[Kulturkampf]]'', but he also had mixed success on ones like [[Germanisation of Poles during Partitions|Germanization]] or [[Expulsion of Poles by Germany|expulsion]] of Poles of foreign nationality (Russian or Austro-Hungarian).

[[Frederick III, German Emperor|Frederick III]] was  emperor for just 99 days in 1888 upon the death of his father, dying from cancer. [[Image:Wilhelm II of Germany.jpg||thumb|upright|Emperor [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Wilhelm II]]]] At age 29, William became [[William II, German Emperor|Emperor William II]] after a difficult youth and conflicts with his British mother [[Victoria, Princess Royal]]. He turned out to be a man of limited experience, narrow and reactionary views, poor judgment, and occasional bad temper, which alienated former friends and allies.

===Railways===
{{Main|Prussian state railways}}
Prussia  nationalized its railways in the 1880s in an effort both to lower rates on freight service and to equalize those rates among shippers. Instead of lowering rates as far as possible, the government ran the railways as a profitmaking endeavor, and the railway profits became a major source of revenue for the state. The nationalization of the railways slowed the economic development of Prussia because the state favored the relatively backward agricultural areas in its railway building. Moreover, the railway surpluses substituted for the development of an adequate tax system.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Fremdling, &quot;Freight Rates and State Budget: The Role of the National Prussian Railways 1880–1913,&quot; ''Journal of European Economic History'', Spring 1980, Vol. 9#1 pp 21–40&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Free State of Prussia in the Weimar Republic==
{{Main|Free State of Prussia}}
[[Image:Deutsches Reich 1925 b.png|thumb|300px|Federal States of the Weimar Republic. Prussia is light blue. After [[World War I|WWI]] the Provinces of [[Province of Posen|Posen]] and [[West Prussia Province|West Prussia]] came largely to the [[Second Polish Republic|2nd Polish Republic]]; [[Posen-West Prussia]] and the [[Regierungsbezirk Westpreußen|West Prussia district]] were formed from the remaining parts.]]
Because of the [[German Revolution]] of 1918, William II abdicated as German Emperor and King of Prussia. Prussia was proclaimed a &quot;Free State&quot; (i.e. a [[republic]], German: ''Freistaat'') within the new [[Weimar Republic]] and in 1920 received a democratic constitution.

Almost all of Germany's territorial losses, specified in the [[Treaty of Versailles]], were areas that had been part of Prussia: [[Eupen]] and [[Malmedy]] to [[Belgium]]; [[South Jutland County|North Schleswig]] to Denmark; the [[Klaipėda Region|Memel Territory]] to Lithuania; the [[Hlučínsko|Hultschin area]] to [[Czechoslovakia]]. Many of the areas which Prussia had annexed in the [[partitions of Poland]], such as the Provinces of [[Province of Posen|Posen]] and [[West Prussia]], as well as eastern [[Upper Silesia]], went to the [[Second Polish Republic]]. [[Gdańsk|Danzig]] became the [[Free City of Danzig]] under the administration of the [[League of Nations]]. Also, the [[Saargebiet]] was created mainly from formerly Prussian territories. [[East Prussia]] became an exclave, only reachable by ship (the [[Seedienst Ostpreußen|Sea Service East Prussia]]) or by a railway through the [[Polish corridor]].

The German government seriously considered breaking up Prussia into smaller states, but eventually traditionalist sentiment prevailed and Prussia became by far the largest state of the [[Weimar Republic]], comprising 60% of its territory. With the abolition of the older Prussian franchise, it became a stronghold of the left. Its incorporation of &quot;Red Berlin&quot; and the industrialised Ruhr Area — both with working-class majorities — ensured left-wing dominance.&lt;ref&gt; Clark, ''Iron Kingdom,'' pp 620-24&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1919 to 1932, Prussia was governed by a coalition of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrats]], [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre]], and [[German Democratic Party|German Democrats]]; from 1921 to 1925, coalition governments included the [[German People's Party]]. Unlike in other states of the German Reich, majority rule by democratic parties in Prussia was never endangered. Nevertheless, in [[East Prussia]] and some industrial areas, the [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Party]] of [[Adolf Hitler]] gained more and more influence and popular support, especially from the lower middle class. Except for Catholic [[Upper Silesia]], the Nazi Party in 1932 became the largest party in most parts of the Free State of Prussia. However, the democratic parties in coalition remained a majority, while Communists and Nazis were in the opposition.&lt;ref&gt; Clark, ''Iron Kingdom,'' pp 630-39&lt;/ref&gt;


The East Prussian [[Otto Braun]], who was Prussian minister-president almost continuously from 1920 to 1932, is considered one of the most capable Social Democrats in history. He implemented several trend-setting reforms together with his minister of the interior, [[Carl Severing]], which were also models for the later [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]] (FRG). For instance, a Prussian minister-president could be forced out of office only if there was a &quot;positive majority&quot; for a potential successor. This concept, known as the [[constructive vote of no confidence]], was carried over into the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] of the FRG. Most historians regard the Prussian government during this time as far more successful than that of Germany as a whole.&lt;ref&gt; Clark, ''Iron Kingdom,'' p 652&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to its prewar authoritarianism, Prussia was a pillar of democracy in the Weimar Republic. This system was destroyed by the ''[[Preußenschlag]]'' (&quot;Prussian coup&quot;) of [[Reich Chancellor]] [[Franz von Papen]]. In this coup d'état, the government of the Reich unseated the Prussian government on 20 July 1932, under the pretext that the latter had lost control of public order in Prussia (during the [[Altona Bloody Sunday|Bloody Sunday]] of [[Altona, Hamburg]], which was still part of Prussia at that time). Papen appointed himself Reich commissioner for Prussia and took control of the government. The ''Preußenschlag'' made it easier, only half a year later, for Hitler to take power decisively in Germany, since he had the whole apparatus of the Prussian government, including the police, at his disposal.&lt;ref&gt; Clark, ''Iron Kingdom,'' pp 647-48&lt;/ref&gt;

==The End of Prussia==
After the appointment of Hitler as the new chancellor, the Nazis used the absence of [[Franz von Papen]] as an opportunity to appoint [[Hermann Göring]] federal commissioner for the Prussian ministry of the interior. The [[German election, 1933|Reichstag election]] of March 5, 1933 strengthened the position of the [[Nazi Party]], although they did not achieve an absolute majority.&lt;ref&gt; Clark, ''Iron Kingdom,'' pp 655-70&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Paul von Hindenburg.jpeg||thumb|upright|left|[[Paul von Hindenburg]]]]

Because the [[Reichstag (building)|Reichstag building]] had been [[Reichstag fire|set on fire]] a few weeks earlier, the new [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]] was opened in the [[Garrison Church (Potsdam)|Garrison Church]] of [[Potsdam]] on March 21, 1933 in the presence of President [[Paul von Hindenburg]]. In a propaganda-filled meeting between Hitler and the Nazi Party, the &quot;marriage of old Prussia with young Germany&quot; was celebrated, to win over the Prussian monarchists, conservatives, and nationalists and induce them to vote for the [[Enabling Act of 1933]].

In the centralised state created by the Nazis in the &quot;Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich&quot; (&quot;Gesetz über den Neuaufbau des Reiches&quot;, 30 January 1934) and the &quot;Law on Reich Governors&quot; (&quot;Reichsstatthaltergesetz&quot;, 30 January 1935) the states were dissolved, in fact if not in law. The federal state governments were now controlled by governors for the Reich who were appointed by the chancellor. Parallel to that, the organisation of the party into districts (''[[Gau (German)|Gaue]]'') gained increasing importance, as the official in charge of a ''Gau'' (the head of which was called a ''[[Gauleiter]]'') was again appointed by the chancellor who was at the same time chief of the Nazi Party.

In Prussia, this centralistic policy went even further. From 1934 almost all ministries were merged and only a few departments were able to maintain their independence. Hitler himself became formally the governor of Prussia. His functions were exercised, however, by Hermann Göring, as Prussian prime minister.

As provided for in the &quot;Greater Hamburg Law&quot; (&quot;Groß-Hamburg-Gesetz&quot;), certain exchanges of territory took place. Prussia was extended on 1 April 1937, for instance, by the incorporation of the Free and Hanseatic City of [[Lübeck]].

The Prussian lands transferred to Poland after the Treaty of Versailles were re-annexed during [[World War II]]. However, most of this territory was not reintegrated back into Prussia but assigned to separate ''Gaue'' of [[Danzig-West Prussia]] and [[Wartheland]].

With the end of Nazi rule in 1945 came the division of Germany into Zones of Occupation, and the transfer of control of everything east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]], (including [[Silesia]], [[Farther Pomerania]], [[Eastern Brandenburg]], and southern [[East Prussia]]), to Poland, with the northern third of East Prussia, including Königsberg, now [[Kaliningrad]], going to the [[Soviet Union]]. Today the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] is a Russian exclave between Lithuania and Poland. During the [[Soviet Army]]'s takeover of eastern Germany an estimated ten million Germans fled, were [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|expelled]] from (or were not able to return) to these territories as part of the [[Potsdam Agreement]] and the sanctioned [[German exodus from Eastern Europe]].

[[Image:Germany former prussian lander.png|thumb|Map of current [[states of Germany]] that are completely or mostly situated inside the old borders of [[Imperial Germany]]’s [[Kingdom of Prussia]]]]

As part of their war aims the Western allies sought the abolition of Prussia. Stalin was initially content to retain the name, Russia having a different historical view of its neighbour and sometime former ally. In Law #46 of February 25, 1947 the [[Allied Control Council]] formally proclaimed the dissolution of Prussia.&lt;ref&gt; Clark, ''Iron Kingdom,'' pp 670-82&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Soviet Zone of Occupation, which became [[East Germany]] in 1949, the former Prussian territories were reorganised into the states of [[Brandenburg]] and [[Saxony-Anhalt]], with the remaining parts of the [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Province of Pomerania]] going to [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]. These states were abolished in 1952 in favour of districts, but were recreated after the fall of the Eastern Bloc in 1990.

In the Western Zones of occupation, which became [[West Germany]] in 1949, the former Prussian territories were divided up among [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[Hesse]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]], and [[Schleswig-Holstein]]. [[Württemberg-Baden]] and [[Württemberg-Hohenzollern]] were later merged with [[Baden]] to create the state of [[Baden-Württemberg]].

In the mid-16th century, the [[margraves of Brandenburg]] had become highly dependent on the estates (counts, lords, knights and towns, no prelates due to the [[Protestant Reformation]] in 1538).&lt;ref name=Kotulla262&gt;Kotulla (2008), p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; The margraviate's liabilities and tax income as well as the margrave's finances were controlled by the ''Kreditwerk'', an institution not controlled by the elector, and the ''Großer Ausschuß'' (&quot;Great Committee&quot;) of the estates.&lt;ref name=Kotulla263&gt;Kotulla (2008), p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to concessions made by [[Joachim II, Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim II]] in 1541 in turn for financial aid by the estates, however, the ''Kreditwerk'' went bankrupt between 1618 and 1625.&lt;ref name=Kotulla263/&gt; The margraves further had to yield the veto of the estates in all issues concerning the &quot;better or worse of the country&quot;, in all legal commitments, and in all issues concerning pawn or sale of the elector's real property.&lt;ref name=Kotulla263/&gt;

To reduce the influence of the estates, [[Joachim Frederick, Elector of Brandenburg|Joachim Frederick]] in 1604 created a council called ''Geheimer Rat für die Kurmark'' (&quot;Privy Council for the Electorate&quot;), which instead of the estates was to function as the supreme advisory council for the elector.&lt;ref name=Kotulla263/&gt; While the council was permanently established in 1613, it failed to gain any influence until 1651 due to the [[Thirty Years' War]].&lt;ref name=Kotulla263/&gt;

Until after the Thirty Years' War, the territories of Brandenburg-Prussia were politically independent from each other,&lt;ref name=Kotulla262/&gt;&lt;ref name=Duchhardt101&gt;Duchhardt (2006), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; connected only by the common feudal superior.&lt;ref name=Duchhardt101/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kotulla265&gt;Kotulla (2008), p. 265&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick William I, Elector of Brandenburg|Frederick William]], who envisioned the transformation of the [[personal union]] into a [[real union]],&lt;ref name=Kotulla265/&gt; started to centralize the Brandenburg-Prussian government with an attempt to establish the ''Geheimer Rat'' as a central authority for all territories in 1651, but this project proved to be unfeasible.&lt;ref name=Kotulla267/&gt; Instead, the elector continued to appoint a governor (''Kurfürstlicher Rat'') for each territory, who in most cases was a member of the ''Geheimer Rat''.&lt;ref name=Kotulla267/&gt; The most powerful institution in the territories remained the governments of the estates (''Landständische Regierung'', named ''Oberratsstube'' in Prussia and ''Geheime Landesregierung'' in Mark and Cleves), which were the highest government agencies regarding jurisdiction, finances and administration.&lt;ref name=Kotulla267/&gt; The elector attempted to balance the estates' governments by creating ''Amtskammer'' chambers to administer and coordinate the elector's domains, tax income and privileges.&lt;ref name=Kotulla267/&gt; Such chambers were introduced in Brandenburg in 1652, in Cleves and Mark in 1653, in Pomerania in 1654, in Prussia in 1661 and in Magdeburg in 1680.&lt;ref name=Kotulla267&gt;Kotulla (2008), p. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1680, the ''Kreditwerk'' came under the aegis of the elector.&lt;ref name=Kotulla266&gt;Kotulla (2008), p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Frederick William's excise tax (''Akzise''), which since 1667 replaced the property tax raised in Brandenburg for Brandenburg-Prussia's standing army with the estates' consent, was raised by the elector without consultation of the estates.&lt;ref name=Kotulla266/&gt; The conclusion of the [[Second Northern War]] had strengthened the elector politically, enabling him to reform the constitution of Cleves and Mark in 1660 and 1661 to introduce officials loyal to him and independent of the local estates.&lt;ref name=Kotulla266/&gt; In the Duchy of Prussia, he confirmed the traditional privileges of the estates in 1663,&lt;ref name=Kotulla266/&gt; but the latter accepted the caveat that these privileges were not to be used to interfere with the exertion of the elector's sovereignty.&lt;ref name=Kotulla267/&gt; As in Brandenburg, Frederick William ignored the privilege of the Prussian estates to confirm or veto taxes raised by the elector: while in 1656, an ''Akzise'' was raised with the estates' consent, the elector by force collected taxes not approved by the Prussian estates for the first time in 1674.&lt;ref name=Kotulla267/&gt; Since 1704, the Prussian estates had de facto relinquished their right to approve the elector's taxes while formally still entitled to do so.&lt;ref name=Kotulla267/&gt; In 1682, the elector introduced an ''Akzise'' to Pomerania and in 1688 to Magdeburg,&lt;ref name=Kotulla267/&gt; while in Cleves and Mark an ''Akzise'' was introduced only between 1716 and 1720.&lt;ref name=Kotulla266/&gt; Due to Frederick William's reforms, the state income increased threefold during his reign,&lt;ref name=Duchhardt101/&gt; and the tax burden per subject reached a level twice as high as in [[France]].&lt;ref name=Duchhardt108&gt;Duchhardt (2006), p. 108&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the rule of [[Frederick I of Prussia|Frederick III (I)]], the Brandenburg Prussian territories were de facto reduced to provinces of the [[Kingdom of Prussia|monarchy]].&lt;ref name=Kotulla265/&gt; Frederick William's testament would have divided Brandenburg-Prussia among his sons, yet firstborn Frederick III with the emperor's backing succeeded in becoming the sole ruler based on the [[Treaty of Gera]], which forbade a division of Hohenzollern territories.&lt;ref name=Kotulla269&gt;Kotulla (2008), p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; In 1689, a new central chamber for all Brandenburg-Prussian territories was created, called ''Geheime Hofkammer'' (since 1713: ''Generalfinanzdirektorium'').&lt;ref name=Kotulla270&gt;Kotulla (2008), p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; This chamber functioned as a superior agency of the territories' ''Amtskammer'' chambers.&lt;ref name=Kotulla270/&gt; The [[General War Commissariat]] (''Generalkriegskommissariat'') emerged as a second central agency, superior to the local ''Kriegskommissariat'' agencies initially concerned with the administration of the army, but until 1712 transformed into an agency also concerned with general tax and police tasks.&lt;ref name=Kotulla270/&gt;

[[File:Corona Prusia-mj2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Crown of William II|Prussian King´s Crown]] ([[Hohenzollern Castle]] Collection)]]
The Kingdom of Prussia was an [[absolute monarchy]] until the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]], after which Prussia became a [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[Adolf Heinrich von Arnim-Boitzenburg]] was elected as Prussia's first [[Prime Minister of Prussia|prime minister]]. Following [[Constitution of the Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia's first constitution]], a two-house parliament was formed. The lower house, or ''[[Prussian Landtag|Landtag]]'' was elected by all taxpayers, who were [[Prussian three-class franchise|divided into three classes]] according to the amount of taxes paid.  This allowed just over 25% of the voters to choose 85% of the legislature, all but assuring dominance by the more well-to-do elements of the population.  The upper house, which was later renamed the [[Prussian House of Lords]], was appointed by the king.  He retained full executive authority and ministers were responsible only to him.  As a result, the grip of the landowning classes, the [[Junker]]s, remained unbroken, especially in the eastern provinces. [[Prussian Secret Police]], formed in response to the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states]], aided the conservative government.

Unlike its authoritarian pre-war predecessor, Prussia was a promising democracy within Germany. The abolition of the aristocracy transformed Prussia into a region strongly dominated by the [[left wing]] of the political spectrum, with &quot;Red Berlin&quot; and the industrial centre of the [[Ruhr Area]] exerting a major influence. During this period, a coalition of centre-left parties ruled, predominantly under the leadership of East Prussian [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]] [[Otto Braun]]. While in office he implemented several  reforms together with his Minister of the Interior, [[Carl Severing]], which were also models for the later [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]]. For instance, a Prussian prime minister could only be forced out of office if there was a &quot;positive majority&quot; for a potential successor{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. This concept, known as the [[constructive vote of no confidence]], was carried over into the [[Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany|Basic Law]] of the Federal Republic of Germany. Most historians regard the Prussian government during this time as far more successful than that of Germany as a whole.

Similar to other German states both [[States of Germany|now]] and [[Weimar Republic#Constituent states of Germany during the Weimar period|at the time]], [[Executive (government)|executive power]] was continued to be vested in a [[Minister-President|Minister-President of Prussia]] and laws established by a [[Landtag]] elected by the people.
