The '''War of 1812''' was a military conflict fought between the forces of the [[United States]] and those of the [[British Empire]]. The United States declared war in 1812 for several reasons, including trade restrictions brought about by Britain's ongoing [[Napoleonic Wars#War between Britain and France, 1803–1814|war with France]], the [[impressment]] of American merchant sailors into the [[Royal Navy]], British support of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] tribes against American expansion, outrage over insults to national honour after humiliations on the high seas, and possible American desire to annex Canada.{{sfn| Stagg| 1983| p=4}} Tied down in Europe until 1814, the British at first used defensive strategy, repelling multiple American invasions of the provinces of [[British North America|Upper and Lower Canada]]. However, the Americans gained control over [[Lake Erie]] in  1813, seized parts of [[western Ontario]], and ended the prospect of an [[Tecumseh's Confederacy|Indian confederacy]] and an independent Indian state in the Midwest under British sponsorship. In the [[Deep South|Southwest]], General [[Andrew Jackson]] destroyed the military strength of the [[Muscogee (Creek) Nation|Creek nation]] at the [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Battle of Horseshoe Bend]] in 1814. With the [[War of the Sixth Coalition|defeat of Napoleon in 1814]] on April 6, the British adopted a more aggressive strategy, sending in three large invasion armies. The British victory at the [[Battle of Bladensburg]] in August 1814 allowed them to capture and [[Burning of Washington|burn Washington, D.C]]. American victories in September 1814 and January 1815 repulsed all three British invasions in [[Battle of Plattsburgh|New York]], [[Battle of Baltimore|Baltimore]]  and [[Battle of New Orleans|New Orleans]].

The war was fought in three principal theatres. Firstly, at sea, warships and [[privateer]]s of both sides attacked each other's merchant ships, while the British [[blockade]]d the Atlantic coast of the U.S. and mounted large-scale raids in the later stages of the war. Secondly, both land and naval battles were fought on the American–Canadian frontier, which ran along the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Saint Lawrence River]]. Thirdly, the American South and [[Gulf of Mexico|Gulf Coast]] also saw major land battles in which the American forces defeated Britain's Indian allies and repulsed a British invasion force at [[Battle of New Orleans|New Orleans]].

Both sides invaded each other's territory, but these invasions were unsuccessful or temporary. At the end of the war, both sides occupied parts of the other's land, but these areas were restored by the [[Treaty of Ghent]].

In the United States, victories at the [[Battle of New Orleans]] in 1815 and in the [[Battle of Baltimore]] of 1814 (which inspired the lyrics of the United States national anthem, &quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]&quot;) produced a sense of euphoria over a &quot;second war of independence&quot; against Britain. Peace brought an &quot;[[Era of Good Feelings]]&quot; in which partisan animosity nearly vanished. Canada also emerged from the war with a heightened sense of national feeling and solidarity, having repelled multiple American invasions. Battles such as the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]] and the [[Battle of Crysler's Farm]] became iconic for English-speaking Canadians. In Canada, especially Ontario, memory of the war retains national significance, as the invasions were largely perceived by Canadians as an annexation attempt by America seeking to expand US territory. In Canada, numerous ceremonies are scheduled in 2012 to commemorate a Canadian victory. The war is scarcely remembered in Britain today; as it regarded the conflict as sideshow to the much larger [[Napoleonic Wars]] raging in Europe. As such it welcomed an era of peaceful relations and trade with the United States.

==Reasons for the war==
{{Main|Origins of the War of 1812}}
The United States declared war on Britain for several reasons.  
===Honor and the second war of independence===
As Risjord (1961) notes, an unstated but powerful motivation for the Americans was the desire to uphold national honour in the face of what they considered to be British insults (including [[Chesapeake-Leopard Affair|the ''Chesapeake'' affair]]).&lt;ref&gt;Norman K. Risjord, &quot;1812: Conservatives, War Hawks, and the Nation's Honor.&quot; ''William And Mary Quarterly'' 1961 18(2): 196–210. [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1918543 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Brands says, &quot;The other war hawks spoke of the struggle with Britain as a second war of independence; [Andrew] Jackson, who still bore scars from the first war of independence held that view with special conviction. The approaching conflict was about violations of American rights, but was it also vindication of American identity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=H.W. Brands|title=Andrew Jackson: His Life and Times|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=I4a7hMqBKFMC&amp;pg=PA163|year=2006|publisher=Random House Digital|page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Madison often quoted what Benjamin Franklin was noted having said following the Battle of Yorktown: &quot;The War of Revolution is won, but the War for Independence is yet to be fought.&quot;

===Trade with France===
In 1807, Britain introduced a series of trade restrictions via a [[Orders in Council (1807)|series of Orders in Council]] to impede American trade with [[First French Empire|France]], with which Britain was at war. The United States contested these restrictions as illegal under international law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sir Robert Phillimore|title=Commentaries upon international law|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Rq8LAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA211|year=1857|publisher=T. &amp; J. W. Johnson|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British wanted to reduce American trade with France, regardless of its theoretical right as a neutral. As historian Reginald Horsman explains, &quot;a large section of influential British opinion, both in the government and in the country, thought that America presented a threat to British maritime supremacy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Horsman|1962|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American merchant marine had come close to doubling between 1802 and 1810, making it by far the largest neutral fleet. Britain was the largest trading partner, receiving 80% of U.S. cotton and 50% of other U.S. exports. The British public and press were resentful of the growing mercantile and commercial competition.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=281}} The United States' view was that Britain's restrictions violated its right to trade with others.

===Impressment===
During the [[Napoleonic Wars]], the [[Royal Navy]] expanded to 175 [[Ship of the line|ships of the line]] and 600 ships overall, requiring 140,000 sailors to man.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=382}}  While the Royal Navy could man its ships with volunteers in peacetime, it competed in wartime with [[British Merchant Navy|merchant shipping]] and [[privateer]]s for a small pool of experienced sailors and turned to [[impressment]] when it could not operate ships with volunteers alone. Britain did not recognize the right of a British subject to relinquish his status as a British subject, emigrate and transfer his national allegiance as a naturalized citizen to any other country. Thus while the United States recognized British-born sailors on American ships as Americans, Britain did not. It was estimated that there were 11,000 [[Naturalization|naturalized]] sailors on United States ships in 1805. Secretary of the Treasury [[Albert Gallatin]] stated that 9,000 were born in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Caffrey|1977|p=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Royal Navy went after them by intercepting and searching U.S. merchant ships for deserters.  Impressment actions such as the [[HMS Leander (1780)#The Leander Affair|''Leander'' Affair]] and the [[Chesapeake–Leopard Affair|''Chesapeake''–''Leopard'' Affair]] outraged Americans, because they infringed on national sovereignty and denied America’s ability to naturalize foreigners.{{sfn|Black|2002|p=44}} Moreover, a great number of British sailors serving as naturalized Americans on U.S. ships were, in fact, Irish. An investigation by Captain Isaac Chauncey in 1808 found that 58% of the sailors based in New York City were either naturalized citizens or recent immigrants, the majority of foreign sailors (134 of 150) being from Britain. Moreover, eighty of the 134 British sailors were Irish.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Taylor, ''The Civil War of 1812'' p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States believed that British deserters had a right to become [[Citizenship in the United States|United States citizens]]. Britain did not recognize naturalized United States citizenship, so in addition to recovering deserters, it considered United States citizens born British liable for impressment. Aggravating the situation was the widespread use of forged identity papers by sailors. This made it all the more difficult for the Royal Navy to distinguish Americans from non-Americans and led it to impress some Americans who had never been British. (Some gained freedom on appeal.){{sfn|Latimer|2007|p=17}} American anger at impressment grew when British frigates stationed themselves just outside U.S. harbours in view of U.S. shores and searched ships for contraband and impressed men in U.S. territorial waters.{{sfn|Toll|2006|pp=278–279}} &quot;Free trade and sailors' rights&quot; was a rallying cry for the United States throughout the conflict.

===British support for Indian raids===
{{Warof1812-Origins}}
The [[Northwest Territory]], comprising the modern states of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, and Wisconsin, had been an area of dispute between the Indian Nations and the United States since the passage of the [[Northwest Ordinance]] in 1787.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard White|title=The Middle Ground: Indians, Empires, and Republics in the Great Lakes Region, 1650-1815|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fHLfiOZVzmMC&amp;pg=PA416|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge U.P.|page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The British Empire had ceded the area to the United States in the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783. The Indian Nations followed [[Tenskwatawa]], the Shawnee Prophet and the brother of [[Tecumseh]]. Tenskwatawa had a vision of purifying his society by expelling the &quot;children of the Evil Spirit&quot;: the American settlers.{{sfn|Willig|2008|p=207}}  Tenskwatawa and Tecumseh formed a confederation of numerous tribes to block American expansion. The British saw the Indian nations as valuable allies and a buffer to its Canadian colonies and provided arms. Attacks on American settlers in the Northwest further aggravated tensions between Britain and the United States.{{sfn|Hitsman|1965|p=27}} The Confederation's raids hindered American expansion into rich farmlands in the Northwest Territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heidler|1997|pp=253,392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British had the long-standing goal of creating a large &quot;neutral&quot; Indian state that would cover much of Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan. They made the demand as late as the fall of 1814 at the peace conference, but lost control of western Ontario at key battles on Lake Erie, thus giving the Americans control of the proposed neutral zone.{{sfn|Smith|1989|pp=46–63, esp 61–63}}{{sfn|Carroll|2001|p=23}}

===American expansionism===
American expansion into the Northwest Territory was being obstructed by indigenous leaders like [[Tecumseh]], who were supplied and encouraged by the British. Americans on the western frontier demanded that interference be stopped.{{sfn|Kennedy|Cohen|Bailey|2010|p=244}} Before 1940, some historians{{sfn|Pratt|1925|pp=9–15}}{{sfn|Hacker|1924|pp=365–395}} held that United States expansionism into Canada was also a reason for the war; however, one subsequent historian wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;Almost all accounts of the 1811–1812 period have stressed the influence of a youthful band, denominated [[War Hawk]]s, on Madison's policy. According to the standard picture, these men were a rather wild and exuberant group enraged by Britain's maritime practices, certain that the British were encouraging the Indians and convinced that Canada would be an easy conquest and a choice addition to the national domain. Like all stereotypes, there is some truth in this tableau; however, inaccuracies predominate. First, Perkins has shown that those favoring war were older than those opposed. Second, the lure of the Canadas has been played down by most recent investigators.{{sfn|Egan|1974|p=74}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Some Canadian historians proposed the notion in the early 20th century,{{sfn|Bowler|1988|pp=11–32}} and it survives in public opinion in Ontario. According to Stagg (1981 and 1983), Madison and his advisers believed that conquest of Canada would be easy and that economic coercion would force the British to come to terms by cutting off the food supply for their West Indies colonies. Furthermore, possession of Canada would be a valuable bargaining chip. Stagg suggested that settlers demanded the seizure of Canada not because they wanted the land, but because the British were thought to be arming the Indians and thereby blocking US settlement of the West.{{sfn|Stagg|1981|pp=3–34}}{{sfn|Stagg|1983|loc={{page needed|date=September 2010}}}} As Horsman concluded, &quot;The idea of conquering Canada had been present since at least 1807 as a means of forcing England to change her policy at sea. The conquest of Canada was primarily a means of waging war, not a reason for starting it.&quot;{{sfn|Horsman|1962|p=267}} Hickey flatly stated, &quot;The desire to annex Canada did not bring on the war.&quot;{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=72}} Brown (1964) concluded, &quot;The purpose of the Canadian expedition was to serve negotiation, not to annex Canada.&quot;{{sfn|Brown|1971|p=128}} Burt, a Canadian scholar,but also a professor at an American university, agreed, noting that [[Sir Augustus Foster, 1st Baronet|Foster]]—the British minister to Washington—also rejected the argument that annexation of Canada was a war goal.{{sfn|Burt|1940|pp=305–10}} However, J. C. A. Stagg states that, &quot;...had the War 1812 been a successful military venture, the Madison administration would have been reluctant to have returned occupied Canadian territory to the enemy&quot;.{{sfn| Stagg| 1983| p=4}} Other authors concur, one stating &quot;Expansion was not the only American objective, and indeed not the immediate one. But it was an objective.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Walter Nugent|title=Habits of Empire:A History of American Expansionism|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=uLV0hPR1yEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=American+expansionism&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=r1CTfHd1GS&amp;sig=O5BDaSqHdWbzHZpBHBAYuI1S-B0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=W2I7UI7gKuOFyQGv1IHYDw&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=American%20expansionism&amp;f=false|publisher=Random house of Canada|page=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another suggests that &quot;Americans harboured 'manifest destiny' ideas of Canadian annexation throughout the nineteenth century.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CarlisleGolson2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Rodney P. Carlisle|author2=J. Geoffrey Golson|title=Manifest Destiny and the Expansion of America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ka6LxulZaEwC&amp;pg=PA44|date=1 February 2007|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-833-0|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;} A third states that &quot;The [American] belief that the United States would one day annex Canada had a continuous existence from the early days of the War of Independence to the War of 1812 [and] was a factor of primary importance in bringing on the war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Julius W. (1925b.) Expansionists of 1812 &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Upper Canada]] (Ontario) had mostly been settled by Revolutionary-era exiles from the United States ([[United Empire Loyalist]]s) or postwar American immigrants. The Loyalists were hostile to union with the United States, while the immigrant settlers were generally uninterested in politics and remained neutral or supported the British (see [[Laura Secord]]) during the war. The Canadian colonies were thinly populated and only lightly defended by the British Army. Americans then believed that many men in Upper Canada would rise up and greet an American invading army as liberators. That did not happen.  One reason American forces retreated after one successful battle inside Canada was that they could not obtain supplies from the locals.{{sfn|Berton|2001|p=206}} But the Americans thought that the possibility of local support suggested an easy conquest, as former President [[Thomas Jefferson]] believed: &quot;The acquisition of Canada this year, as far as the neighborhood of Quebec, will be a mere matter of marching, and will give us the experience for the attack on Halifax, the next and final expulsion of England from the American continent.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald R. Hickey|title=The War of 1812: A Forgotten Conflict|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Ik6Vi82gLagC&amp;pg=PA68|year=2012|publisher=U. of Illinois Press|page=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some British officials—and some dissident Americans—charged that the goal of the war was to annex part of Canada, but they did not specify which part. The states nearest Canada strongly opposed the war.{{sfn|Hickey|1989|pp=52–53}}

===US political conflict===

While the British government was largely oblivious to the deteriorating North-American situation because of its involvement in a continent-wide European War, the US was in a period of significant political conflict between the [[Federalist Party]] (based mainly in the Northeast), which favoured a strong central government and closer ties to Britain, and the [[Democratic-Republican Party]] (with its greatest power base in the South and West), which favoured a weak central government, preservation of slavery, expansion into Indian land, and a stronger break with Britain.  By 1812, the Federalist Party had weakened considerably, and the Democratic-Republicans, with [[James Madison]] completing his first term of office and control of Congress, was in a very strong position to pursue its more aggressive agenda against Britain and attempt to further weaken its Federalist rivals.&lt;ref&gt;The US political background is described in detail in Alan Taylor, ''The Civil War of 1812: American Citizens, British Subjects, Irish Rebels &amp; Indian Allies,''  New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the war, support for the US cause would be weak (or sometimes non-existent) in Federalist areas of the Northeast, though after the war, the self-destruction of the Federalists at the [[Hartford Convention]] led to broader, retroactive support from all parts of the country.

{{Wikisource|US Declaration of War against the United Kingdom}}
On June 1, 1812, President [[James Madison]] sent a message to the [[United States Congress|Congress]] recounting American grievances against Great Britain, though not specifically calling for a declaration of war. After Madison's message, the House of Representatives deliberated for four days behind closed doors before voting 79 to 49 (61% in favor) [[United States declaration of war upon the United Kingdom (1812)|the first declaration of war]], and the Senate agreed by 19 to 13 (59% in favor). The conflict began formally on June 18, 1812, when Madison signed the measure into law. This was the first time that the United States had declared war on another nation, and the Congressional vote would prove to be the closest vote to formally declare war in American history. (The [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 1991]], while not a formal declaration of war, was a closer vote.) None of the 39 [[Federalist Party|Federalists]] in Congress voted in favor of the war; critics of war subsequently referred to it as &quot;Mr. Madison's War&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/hlaw:@field(DOCID+@lit(sj005181)) |title='&amp;#39;Journal of the Senate of the United States of America'&amp;#39;, 1789–1873 |publisher=Memory.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile in London on May 11, an assassin killed Prime Minister [[Spencer Perceval]], which resulted in [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] coming to power. Liverpool wanted a more practical relationship with the United States. He issued a repeal of the Orders in Council, but the United States was unaware of this, as it took three weeks for the news to cross the Atlantic.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=329}} In response to the US declaration of war, [[Isaac Brock]] issued a proclamation alerting the citizenry in Upper Canada of the state of war and urging all military personnel &quot;to be vigilant in the discharge of their duty&quot; to prevent communication with the enemy and to arrest anyone suspected of helping the Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flickr.com/photos/lac-bac/7288766718/in/photostream|title=Proclamation: Province of Upper Canada|publisher=Library and Archives Canada|date=December 17, 2008|accessdate=2012-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wesley B.

==Course of the war==
Although the outbreak of the war had been preceded by years of angry diplomatic dispute, neither side was ready for war when it came. Britain was heavily engaged in the Napoleonic Wars, most of the [[British Army]] was deployed in the [[Peninsular War]] (in Portugal and Spain), and the Royal Navy was compelled to blockade most of the coast of Europe. The number of British regular troops present in Canada in July 1812 was officially stated to be 6,034, supported by Canadian militia.{{sfn|Hickey|1989|pp=72–75}}  Throughout the war, the British [[Secretary of State for War and the Colonies]] was the [[Henry Bathurst, 3rd Earl Bathurst|Earl of Bathurst]]. For the first two years of the war, he could spare few troops to reinforce North America and urged the [[commander-in-chief]] in North America (Lieutenant General Sir [[George Prevost]]) to maintain a defensive strategy. The naturally cautious Prevost followed these instructions, concentrating on defending [[Lower Canada]] at the expense of [[Upper Canada]] (which was more vulnerable to American attacks) and allowing few offensive actions.

The United States was not prepared to prosecute a war, for [[James Madison|Madison]] had assumed that the state militias would easily seize Canada and that negotiations would follow. In 1812, the regular army consisted of fewer than 12,000 men. Congress authorized the expansion of the army to 35,000 men, but the service was voluntary and unpopular; it offered poor pay, and there were few trained and experienced officers, at least initially.{{sfn|Quimby|1997|pp=2–12}} The militia objected to serving outside their home states, were not open to discipline, and performed poorly against British forces when outside their home states.  American prosecution of the war suffered from its unpopularity, especially in [[New England]], where anti-war speakers were vocal. &quot;Two of the Massachusetts members [of Congress], [[Ebenezer Seaver|Seaver]] and [[William Widgery|Widgery]], were publicly insulted and hissed on Change in Boston; while another, [[Charles Turner, Jr.|Charles Turner]], member for the [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]] district, and Chief-Justice of the Court of Sessions for that county, was seized by a crowd on the evening of August 3, [1812] and kicked through the town.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Adams, Henry]], ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=f_wAAAAAYAAJ History of the United States of America during the Administrations of James Madison, vol. II], p. 400'', (later edition: ISBN 0-940450-35-6, p. 574)&lt;/ref&gt; The United States had great difficulty financing its war. It had disbanded its [[First Bank of the United States|national bank]], and private bankers in the Northeast were opposed to the war. The failure of New England to provide militia units or financial support was a serious blow.{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=80}} Threats of secession by New England states were loud, as evidenced by the [[Hartford Convention]].  Britain exploited these divisions, blockading only southern ports for much of the war and encouraging smuggling.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|1997|pp=233–34,349–50,478–79}}

On July 12, 1812, General [[William Hull]] led an invading American force of about 1,000 untrained, poorly-equipped militia across the [[Detroit River]] and occupied the Canadian town of Sandwich (now a neighbourhood of [[Windsor, Ontario]]). By August, Hull and his troops (numbering 2,500 with the addition of 500 [[Canadians]]) retreated to Detroit, where they surrendered to a force of British regulars, Canadian militia and Native Americans, led by British Major General [[Isaac Brock]] and [[Shawnee]] leader [[Tecumseh]].{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|1997|p=248}} The surrender not only cost the United States the village of Detroit, but control over most of the [[Michigan Territory]]. Several months later, the U.S. launched a second invasion of Canada, this time at the [[Niagara Peninsula|Niagara peninsula]]. On October 13, United States forces were again defeated at the [[Battle of Queenston Heights]], where General Brock was killed.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|1997|pp=437–8}}

Military and civilian leadership remained a critical American weakness until 1814. The early disasters brought about chiefly by American unpreparedness and lack of leadership drove [[United States Secretary of War]] [[William Eustis]] from office. His successor, [[John Armstrong, Jr.]], attempted a coordinated strategy late in 1813 (with 10,000 men) aimed at the capture of [[Montreal]], but he was thwarted by logistical difficulties, uncooperative and quarrelsome commanders and ill-trained troops. After losing several battles to inferior forces, the Americans retreated in disarray in October 1813.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|1997|pp=362–363}}

[[Image:Battle of Lundys Lane.jpg|thumb|American Infantry attacks at Lundy's Lane]]
A decisive use of naval power came on the [[Great Lakes]] and depended on a contest of building ships. The U.S. started a rapidly-expanded program of building warships at [[Sackets Harbor Battlefield State Historic Site|Sackets Harbor]] on Lake Ontario, where 3,000 men were recruited, many from New York City, to build 11 warships early in the war.  In 1813, the Americans won control of Lake Erie in the [[Battle of Lake Erie]] and cut off British and Native American forces in the west from their supply base; they were decisively defeated by General [[William Henry Harrison]]'s forces on their retreat towards Niagara at the [[Battle of the Thames]] in October 1813.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|1997|pp=290–293}} Tecumseh, the leader of the tribal confederation, was killed and his Indian coalition disintegrated.{{sfn|Goltz|2000|loc=Tecumseh}} While some Natives continued to fight alongside British troops, they subsequently did so only as individual tribes or groups of warriors, and where they were directly supplied and armed by British agents. The Americans controlled western Ontario, and permanently ended the threat of Indian raids based in Canada into the American Midwest, thus achieving a basic war goal.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|1997|pp=505,508–511}}{{sfn|Gilbert|1989|pp=329–30}} Control of Lake Ontario changed hands several times, with both sides unable and unwilling to take advantage of the temporary superiority.

At sea, the powerful [[Royal Navy]] blockaded much of the coastline, though it was allowing substantial exports from New England, which traded with Canada in defiance of American laws.  The blockade devastated American agricultural exports, but it helped stimulate local factories that replaced goods previously imported.  The American strategy of using small gunboats to defend ports was a [[Failure|fiasco]], as the British raided the coast at will. The most famous episode was a series of British raids on the shores of [[Chesapeake Bay]], including an attack on Washington that resulted in the British burning of the [[White House]], the [[United States Capitol|Capitol]], the [[Washington Navy Yard|Navy Yard]], and other public buildings, in the &quot;[[Burning of Washington]]&quot;. The embarrassing Burning of Washington led to Armstrong's dismissal as US Secretary of War. The British power at sea was enough to allow the Royal Navy to levy &quot;[[protection money|contributions]]&quot; on bayside towns in return for not burning them to the ground.  The Americans were more successful in ship-to-ship actions. They sent out several hundred [[privateer]]s to attack British merchant ships; in the first four months of war they captured 219 British merchant ships.{{sfn|Latimer|2007|p=101}} British commercial interests were damaged, especially in the [[West Indies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|first=George |last=Coggeshall |year=2005 |title=History of the American privateers|ref=harv}}&lt;sup&gt; [publisher] and &lt;/sup&gt;{{page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle of New Orleans Duval engraving cropped.jpg|thumb|The Battle of New Orleans in 1815]]
After Napoleon abdicated on April 6, 1814, the British could send veteran armies to the United States, but by then the Americans had learned how to mobilize and fight.{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=126}} British General Prevost launched a major invasion of [[New York|New York State]] with these veteran soldiers, but the American fleet under [[Thomas Macdonough]] gained control of [[Lake Champlain]] and the British lost the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]] in September 1814.  Prevost, blamed for the defeat, sought a [[court-martial]] to clear his name, but he died in London awaiting it.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|1997|pp=428–429}} A British invasion of [[Louisiana]] (unknowingly launched after the [[Treaty of Ghent]] was negotiated to end the war) was defeated with very heavy British losses by General [[Andrew Jackson]] at the [[Battle of New Orleans]] in January 1815.  The victory made Jackson a national hero, restored the American sense of [[honour]],{{sfn|Millett|1991|p=46}} and ruined the Federalist party efforts to condemn the war as a failure.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|1997|pp=378–382}}{{sfn|Remini|2001|pp=136–83}} With the ratification of the peace treaty in February 1815, the war ended before the U.S. new Secretary of War [[James Monroe]] could put his new offensive strategy into effect.

Once Britain and [[War of the Sixth Coalition|The Sixth Coalition]] defeated Napoleon in 1814, France and Britain became allies.  Britain ended the trade restrictions and the impressment of American sailors, thus removing two more causes of the war. After two years of warfare, the major causes of the war had disappeared. Neither side had a reason to continue or a chance of gaining a decisive success that would compel their opponents to cede territory or advantageous peace terms.{{sfn|Black|2002|p=69}} As a result of this [[stalemate]], the two countries signed the [[Treaty of Ghent]] on December 24, 1814.  News of the peace treaty took two months to reach the U.S., during which fighting continued.  The war fostered a spirit of national unity and an &quot;[[Era of Good Feelings]]&quot; in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;Major L. Wilson, ''Space, Time, and Freedom: The Quest for Nationality and the Irrepressible Conflict, 1815–1861'' (1974) p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Paul G. Cornell, ''Canada, unity in diversity'' (1967) p.192&lt;/ref&gt; It opened a long era of peaceful relations between the United States and the British Empire.&lt;ref&gt;David Heidler and Jeanne T. Heidler, ''The War of 1812'' (2002) pp 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theatres of war==
The war was conducted in three theatres:
#At sea, principally the Atlantic Ocean and the east coast of North America
#The [[Great Lakes]] and the Canadian frontier
#The Southern States

===Atlantic theatre===
====Single-ship actions====
[[File:Map of the Frigate Chesapeake's First War of 1812 Cruise.png|thumb|Map of the [[USS Chesapeake (1799)|''Chesapeake'']]'s first cruise during the War of 1812. Modern boundaries are shown.]]
In 1812, Britain's [[Royal Navy]] was the world's largest, with over 600&amp;nbsp;cruisers in commission and some smaller vessels. Although most of these were involved in blockading the French navy and protecting British trade against (usually French) privateers, the Royal Navy nevertheless had 85&amp;nbsp;vessels in American waters, if all British Navy vessels in North American and the Caribbean are counted.&lt;ref&gt;Admiralty reply to British press criticism ({{harvnb|Toll|2006|p=180}}).&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Royal Navy's [[North America and West Indies Station|North American squadron]] based in [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], which bore the brunt of the war, numbered one small [[ship of the line]], seven [[frigate]]s, nine smaller [[Sloop-of-war|sloops]] and brigs along with five schooners.&lt;ref&gt;Gwyn, Julian, ''Frigates and Foremasts: The North American Squadron in Nova Scotian Waters, 1745–1815'', UBC Press (2003), p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the [[United States Navy]] comprised 8&amp;nbsp;[[frigate]]s, 14 smaller [[sloops]] and [[brig]]s, and no [[ship of the line|ships of the line]].  Three of the American [[frigate]]s were exceptionally large and powerful for their class, larger than any British frigate in North America: whereas the standard British frigate of the time was rated as a 38&amp;nbsp;gun ship, actually carrying up to 50 guns, with its main battery consisting of 18-pounder guns, the ''Constitution'', ''President'', and ''United States'' were rated as 44-gun ships carrying 56-60 guns with a main [[Artillery battery|battery]] of 24-pounders.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=50}}

[[File:USS Constitution vs Guerriere.jpg|left|thumb|[[USS Constitution|''Constitution'']] defeats [[HMS Guerriere (1806)|HMS ''Guerriere'']], a significant event during the war.]]
The British strategy was to protect their own merchant shipping to and from [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], Nova Scotia, and the [[West Indies]], and to enforce a blockade of major American ports to restrict American trade. Because of their numerical inferiority, the Americans aimed to cause disruption through hit-and-run tactics, such as the capture of [[prize (law)|prizes]] and engaging [[Royal Navy]] vessels only under favourable circumstances. Days after the formal declaration of war, however, two small squadrons sailed, including the frigate ''President'' and the sloop [[USS Hornet (1805, brig)|''Hornet'']] under Commodore [[John Rodgers (naval officer, War of 1812)|John Rodgers]], and the frigates ''United States'' and [[USS Congress (1799)|''Congress'']], with the brig [[USS Argus (1803)|''Argus'']] under Captain [[Stephen Decatur]]. These were initially concentrated as one unit under Rodgers, and it was his intention to force the Royal Navy to concentrate its own ships to prevent isolated units being captured by his powerful force. Large numbers of American merchant ships were still returning to the United States, and if the Royal Navy was concentrated, it could not watch all the ports on the American seaboard. Rodgers' strategy worked, in that the Royal Navy concentrated most of its frigates off [[New York Harbor]] under Captain [[Philip Broke]] and allowed many American ships to reach home. However, his own cruise captured only five small merchant ships, and the Americans never subsequently concentrated more than two or three ships together as a unit.{{citation needed|date = March 2012}}

Meanwhile, the ''Constitution'', commanded by Captain [[Isaac Hull]], sailed from [[Chesapeake Bay]] on July 12. On July 17, Broke's British squadron gave chase off New York, but the ''Constitution'' evaded her pursuers after two days. After briefly calling at Boston to replenish water, on August 19, the ''Constitution'' [[USS Constitution vs HMS Guerriere|engaged the British frigate]] [[HMS Guerriere (1806)|HMS ''Guerriere'']]. After a 35-minute battle, ''Guerriere'' had been dis-masted and captured and was later burned. The ''Constitution'' earned the nickname &quot;Old Ironsides&quot; following this battle as many of the British cannon balls were seen to bounce off her hull. Hull returned to Boston with news of this significant victory. On October 25, the ''United States'', commanded by Captain Decatur, captured the British frigate [[HMS Macedonian|HMS ''Macedonian'']], which he then carried back to port.{{sfn|Toll|2006|pp=360–365}} At the close of the month, the ''Constitution'' sailed south, now under the command of Captain [[William Bainbridge]]. On December 29, off [[Bahia]], Brazil, she met the British frigate [[HMS Java (1811)|HMS ''Java'']]. After a battle lasting three hours, ''Java'' [[striking the colors|struck her colours]] and was burned after being judged unsalvageable.  The ''Constitution'', however, was relatively undamaged in the battle.{{citation needed|date = March 2012}}

The successes gained by the three big American frigates forced Britain to construct five 40-gun, 24-pounder heavy frigates{{sfn|Gardiner|1996|p=162}} and two &quot;spar-decked&quot; frigates (the 60-gun [[HMS Leander (1813)|HMS ''Leander'']] and [[HMS Newcastle|HMS ''Newcastle'']]{{sfn|Gardiner|1996|p=164}}) and to [[razee]] three old 74-gun ships of the line to convert them to heavy frigates.{{sfn|Gardiner|1996|p=163}} The Royal Navy acknowledged that there were factors other than greater size and heavier guns. The United States Navy's sloops and brigs had also won several victories over Royal Navy vessels of approximately equal strength. While the American ships had experienced and well-drilled volunteer crews, the enormous size of the overstretched Royal Navy meant that many ships were shorthanded and the average quality of crews suffered, and constant sea duties of those serving in North America interfered with their training and exercises.{{sfn|Toll|2006|pp=405–417}}

The capture of the three British frigates stimulated the British to greater exertions. More vessels were deployed on the American seaboard and the blockade tightened. On June 1, 1813, off [[Boston Harbor]], the frigate [[USS Chesapeake (1799)|''Chesapeake'']], commanded by Captain [[James Lawrence]], was captured by the British frigate [[HMS Shannon (1806)|HMS ''Shannon'']] under Captain Sir Philip Broke. Lawrence was mortally wounded and famously cried out, &quot;Don't give up the ship! Hold on, men!&quot;{{sfn|Toll|2006|pp=405–417}} Although the ''Chesapeake'' was only of equal strength to the average British frigate and the crew had mustered together only hours before the battle, the British press reacted with almost hysterical relief that the run of American victories had ended.{{sfn|Forester|1970|pp=131–132}} Notably, this action was by ratio one of the bloodiest contests recorded during this age of sail, with more dead and wounded than HMS&amp;nbsp;''Victory'' suffered in four hours of combat at Trafalgar. Captain Lawrence was killed and Captain Broke was so badly wounded that he never again held a sea command.{{sfn|Gardiner|1996|p=61}}

In January 1813, the American frigate [[USS Essex (1799)|''Essex'']], under the command of Captain [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]], sailed into the Pacific in an attempt to harass British shipping. Many British whaling ships carried [[letters of marque]] allowing them to prey on American whalers, and nearly destroyed the industry. The ''Essex'' challenged this practice. She inflicted considerable damage on British interests before she was captured off Valparaiso, Chile by the British frigate [[HMS Phoebe (1795)|HMS ''Phoebe'']] and the sloop [[HMS Cherub (1806)|HMS ''Cherub'']] on March 28, 1814.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/e5/essex-i.htm ''Essex''], [[Naval History and Heritage Command]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The British 6th-rate [[Cruizer class brig-sloop|''Cruizer''-class brig-sloop]]s did not fare well against the American ship-rigged sloops of war. The [[USS Hornet (1805 brig)|''Hornet'']] and [[USS Wasp (1807)|''Wasp'']] constructed before the war were notably powerful vessels, and the ''Frolic'' class built during the war even more so (although [[USS Frolic (1813)|''Frolic'']] was trapped and captured by a British frigate and a schooner). The British brig-rigged sloops tended to suffer fire to their rigging far worse than the American ship-rigged sloops, while the ship-rigged sloops could back their sails in action, giving them another advantage in manoeuvring.{{sfn|Gardiner|1996|pp=85–90}}

Following their earlier losses, the British Admiralty instituted a new policy that the three American heavy frigates should not be engaged except by a ship of the line or smaller vessels in squadron strength. An example of this was the [[Capture of USS President|capture of the ''President'']] by a squadron of four British frigates in January 1815. A month later, however, the ''Constitution'' managed to engage and capture two smaller British warships, [[HMS Cyane (1806)|HMS ''Cyane'']] and [[HMS Levant (1813)|HMS ''Levant'']], sailing in company.{{sfn|Roosevelt|1902|pp=[http://www.archive.org/stream/navalwarorhisto00roosgoog#page/n167/mode/1up 155–158]}}

====Blockade====
The blockade of American ports later tightened to the extent that most American merchant ships and naval vessels were confined to port. The American frigates ''[[USS United States (1797)|United States]]'' and ''[[HMS Macedonian|Macedonian]]'' ended the war blockaded and [[Hulk (ship)|hulked]] in [[New London, Connecticut]]. Some merchant ships were based in Europe or Asia and continued operations. Others, mainly from New England, were issued licences to trade by Admiral Sir [[John Borlase Warren]], commander in chief on the American station in 1813. This allowed Wellington's army in Spain to receive American goods and to maintain the New Englanders' [[Opposition to the War of 1812 in the United States|opposition to the war]]. The blockade nevertheless resulted in American exports decreasing from $130&amp;nbsp;million in 1807 to $7&amp;nbsp;million in 1814. Most of these were food exports that had gone to Britain or British colonies, which suffered when their supplies were cut off.{{sfn|Leckie|1998|p=255}}

The operations of American [[privateer]]s (some of which belonged to the United States Navy, but most of which were private ventures) were extensive. They continued until the close of the war and were only partially affected by the strict enforcement of [[convoy]] by the Royal Navy. An example of the audacity of the American cruisers was the depredations in British home waters carried out by the American sloop [[Argus (1803)|''Argus'']], which was eventually captured off [[St David's|St. David's Head]] in Wales by the British brig [[HMS Pelican (1812)|HMS ''Pelican'']] on August 14, 1813. A total of 1,554 vessels were claimed captured by all American naval and privateer vessels, 1,300 of which were captured by privateers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usmm.org/warof1812.html |title=American Merchant Marine and Privateers in War of 1812 |publisher=Usmm.org |accessdate=July 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princedeneufchatel.com/ |title=www.princedeneufchatel.com |publisher=princedeneufchatel.com |accessdate=July 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msc.navy.mil/sealift/2004/May/perspective.htm |title=Sealift – Merchant Mariners – America’s unsung heroes |publisher=Msc.navy.mil |accessdate=October 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, insurer [[Lloyd's of London]] reported that only 1,175 British ships were taken, 373 of which were recaptured, for a total loss of 802.&lt;ref&gt;''Hansard'', vol 29, pp. 649–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Royal Navy base that supervised the blockade, [[City of Halifax|Halifax]] profited greatly during the war. From that base British [[privateer]]s seized many French and American ships and sold their prizes in Halifax.

The war was the last time the British allowed privateering, since the practice was coming to be seen as politically inexpedient and of diminishing value in maintaining its naval supremacy. It was the swan song of Bermuda's privateers, who had vigorously returned to the practice after American lawsuits had put a stop to it two decades earlier. The nimble [[Bermuda sloop]]s captured 298 enemy ships. British naval and privateer vessels between the Great Lakes and the West Indies captured 1,593.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The American War of 1812&quot; [http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/gpvillain/1812.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+23:27:23  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Atlantic coast====
{{refimprove section|date=April 2012}}
Preoccupied in their pursuit of American privateers when the war began, the British naval forces had some difficulty in blockading the entire U.S. coast. The British government, having need of American foodstuffs for its army in Spain, benefited from the willingness of the New Englanders to trade with them, so no blockade of New England was at first attempted. The [[Delaware River]] and [[Chesapeake Bay]] were declared in a state of blockade on December 26, 1812.

This was extended to the coast south of [[Narragansett, Rhode Island|Narragansett]] by November 1813 and to the entire American coast on May 31, 1814. In the meantime, illicit trade was carried on by collusive captures arranged between American traders and British officers. American ships were fraudulently transferred to neutral flags. Eventually, the U.S. government was driven to issue orders to stop illicit trading; this put only a further strain on the commerce of the country. The overpowering strength of the British fleet enabled it to occupy the Chesapeake and to attack and destroy numerous docks and harbours.

The blockading fleet in the [[Chesapeake]]{{dn|date=August 2012}}, based at Bermuda, received increasing numbers of enslaved Americans during 1813, welcomed by Royal Navy officers holding [[anti-slavery]] sentiments and, by British government order, treated as free on coming into British hands. In 1814, the British government changed from a policy of passively permitting reception of refugees to one of actively encouraging emigration, imperfectly implemented by [[Alexander Cochrane|Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane]]'s [[Black Refugee (War of 1812)|proclamation of April 2, 1814]], and somewhat reminiscent of the offers of freedom during the [[Revolutionary War]]. Thousands of enslaved Americans went over to the British with their families during the two years from March 1813, and from May 1814 younger men among the volunteers were recruited into a new [[Corps of Colonial Marines]], initially based on occupied [[Tangier, Virginia|Tangier Island]], in the Chesapeake, the Corps joining [[Royal Marines]] in September 1814 to become part of the [[Royal Marines Battalions (Napoleonic Wars)|3rd Battalion Royal and Colonial Marines]]. They fought for Britain throughout the Atlantic campaign, with praise from commanders, including the [[Battle of Bladensburg]] and the attacks on Washington, D.C. and [[Battle of Baltimore|Baltimore]]. After garrison service in the new [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|Royal Naval Dockyard at Bermuda]] after the war they were settled in Trinidad in August 1816, where seven hundred{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} of these ex-marines were granted land, organized in villages according to their military companies, in the area since known as The Company Villages. A small number of other freed Americans were recruited into the [[West India Regiment|Second West India regiment]]. Most of those men who did not enlist were settled with their families in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[New Brunswick]] by the British, while two hundred from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] were settled in Trinidad in 1815.

====Maine====
Maine, then part of Massachusetts, was a base for smuggling and illegal trade between the U.S. and the British. Until 1813 the region was generally quiet except for privateer actions near the coast.  In September, 1813, there was a notable naval action when the U.S. Navy's brig ''[[Enterprise (1799)|Enterprise]]'' [[Capture of HMS Boxer|fought and captured]] the Royal Navy brig ''[[HMS Boxer (1812)|Boxer]]'' off Pemaquid Point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Joshua|title=Battle for the Bay: The War of 1812|year=2011|publisher=Goose Lane Editions|location=Fredericton, NB|isbn=978-0-86492-644-9|pages=75–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first British assault came in July, 1814, when Sir [[Thomas Masterman Hardy]] took Moose Island ([[Eastport, Maine]]) without a shot, with the entire American garrison of [[Fort Sullivan (Maine)|Fort Sullivan]] surrendering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Joshua|title=Borderland Smuggling|year=2007|publisher=University Press of Florida|location=Gainesville, FL|isbn=0-8130-2986-4|pages=81–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, from his base in [[Halifax Regional Municipality|Halifax, Nova Scotia]], in September 1814, Sir [[John Coape Sherbrooke]] led 3,000 British troops in the &quot;Penobscot Expedition&quot;. In 26 days, he raided and looted [[Hampden, Maine|Hampden]], [[Bangor, Maine|Bangor]], and [[Machias, Maine|Machias]], destroying or capturing 17 American ships. He won the [[Battle of Hampden]] (losing two killed while the Americans lost one killed). Retreating American forces were forced to destroy the frigate [[Adams (1799)|''Adams'']]. The British occupied the town of [[Castine, Maine|Castine]] and most of eastern Maine for the rest of the war. The [[Treaty of Ghent]] returned this territory to the United States. The British left in April 1815, at which time they took 10,750 pounds obtained from tariff duties at Castine. This money, called the &quot;Castine Fund&quot;, was used in the establishment of [[Dalhousie University]], in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], Nova Scotia.{{sfn|Harvey|1938|pp=207–213}}

====Chesapeake campaign and &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;====
[[File:Warof1812.jpg|thumb|Following their victory at the Battle of Bladensburg, the British entered Washington D.C.]]
The strategic location of the Chesapeake Bay near America's capital made it a prime target for the British. Starting in March 1813, a squadron under Rear Admiral [[George Cockburn]] started a blockade of the bay and raided towns along the bay from [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] to [[Raid on Havre de Grace|Havre de Grace]].

On July 4, 1813, [[Joshua Barney]], a Revolutionary War naval hero, convinced the Navy Department to build the [[Chesapeake Bay Flotilla]], a squadron of twenty barges to defend the Chesapeake Bay. Launched in April 1814, the squadron was quickly cornered in the [[Patuxent River]], and while successful in harassing the [[Royal Navy]], they were powerless to stop the British campaign that ultimately led to the &quot;Burning of Washington&quot;. This expedition, led by Cockburn and General [[Robert Ross (general)|Robert Ross]], was carried out between August 19 and 29, 1814, as the result of the hardened British policy of 1814 (although British and American commissioners had convened peace negotiations at [[Ghent]] in June of that year). As part of this, Admiral Warren had been replaced as commander in chief by Admiral [[Alexander Cochrane]], with reinforcements and orders to coerce the Americans into a favourable peace.

[[File:BurningofWashington1814.jpg|left|thumb|Burning of Washington 1814]]
[[Governor-in-chief]] of British North America Sir [[George Prevost]]  had written to the Admirals in Bermuda, calling for retaliation for the American [[Battle of York|sacking of York]] (now [[Toronto]]). A force of 2,500 soldiers under General Ross had just arrived in Bermuda aboard [[HMS Royal Oak (1809)|HMS ''Royal Oak'']], three frigates, three sloops and ten other vessels. Released from the [[Peninsular War]] by British victory, the British intended to use them for diversionary raids along the coasts of Maryland and Virginia. In response to Prevost's request, they decided to employ this force, together with the naval and military units already on the station, to strike at Washington, D.C.

On August 24, U.S. Secretary of War John Armstrong insisted that the British would attack Baltimore rather than Washington, even when the British army was obviously on its way to the capital. The inexperienced American militia, which had congregated at [[Bladensburg, Maryland]], to protect the capital, was routed in the [[Battle of Bladensburg]], opening the route to Washington. While [[Dolley Madison]] saved valuables from the [[White House|Presidential Mansion]], President James Madison was forced to flee to [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;burn washington&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/burning_washington.htm#rodgers-p |title=The Defense and Burning of Washington in 1814: Naval Documents of the War of 1812 |publisher=History.navy.mil |accessdate=October 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British commanders ate the supper that had been prepared for the President before they burned the Presidential Mansion; American morale was reduced to an all-time low. The British viewed their actions as retaliation for destructive American raids into Canada, most notably the Americans' [[Battle of York|burning of]] York (now [[Toronto]]) in 1813. Later that same evening, a furious storm swept into Washington, D.C., sending one or more [[List of District of Columbia tornadoes|tornadoes]] into the city that caused more damage but finally extinguished the fires with torrential rains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbook.com/1814.htm |title=The Tornado and the Burning of Washington |publisher=Weatherbook.com |accessdate=October 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The naval yards were set afire at the direction of U.S. officials to prevent the capture of naval ships and supplies.&lt;ref name=&quot;burn washington&quot;/&gt; The British left Washington, D.C. as soon as the storm subsided. Having destroyed Washington's public buildings, including the President's Mansion and the Treasury, the British army next moved to capture [[Baltimore]], a busy port and a key base for American privateers. The subsequent [[Battle of Baltimore]] began with the British landing at North Point, where they were met by American militia. An exchange of fire began, with casualties on both sides. General Ross was killed by an American sniper as he attempted to rally his troops. The sniper himself was killed moments later, and the British withdrew. The British also attempted to attack Baltimore by sea on September 13 but were unable to reduce [[Fort McHenry]], at the entrance to Baltimore Harbor.

[[File:Ft. Henry bombardement 1814.jpg|thumb|right|An artist's rendering of the battle at [[Fort McHenry]], where [[Francis Scott Key]] was inspired to write &quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]&quot;.]]
The Battle of Fort McHenry was no battle at all. British guns had range on American cannon, and stood off out of U.S. range, bombarding the fort, which returned no fire. Their plan was to coordinate with a land force, but from that distance coordination proved impossible, so the British called off the attack and left. All the lights were extinguished in Baltimore the night of the attack, and the fort was bombarded for 25 hours. The only light was given off by the exploding shells over Fort McHenry, illuminating the flag that was still flying over the fort. The defence of the fort inspired the American lawyer [[Francis Scott Key]] to write a poem that would eventually supply the lyrics to &quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]&quot;.

None of the actions of the Chesapeake campaign were deemed worthy of a British army medal clasp (Fort Detroit, Chateauguay, Chrysler's Farm being the three clasps for the war), but participants in the attack in Washington were paid prize money by the War Office.&lt;ref name=&quot;Listing by surname of Royal Marines (2nd Battn, 3rd Battn, Colonial Marines) paid prize money for participating in the attack on Washington&quot;&gt;http://www.britishmedals.us/files/rmwashington.html&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, prize-money arising from the booty captured by the expedition in the River Patuxent, at Fort Washington, and Alexandria, between August 22 and 29, 1814 was paid in November 1817. Three companies of [[Corps of Colonial Marines]] were among the recipients. A first-class share was worth ₤183 9[[shilling|s]] 1¾[[pence|d]]; a sixth-class share, which was what probably an ordinary marine would receive, was worth ₤1 9s 3½d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17305|startpage=2316|date=November 15, 1817|accessdate=Dec 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second and final payment came in May 1819. A first-class share was worth ₤42 13s 10¾d; a sixth-class share was worth 9s 1¾d.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=17482|startpage=955|date=June 1, 1819|accessdate=Dec 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Great Lakes and Western Territories===
====Invasions of Upper and Lower Canada, 1812====
[[File:Anglo American War 1812 Locations map-en.svg|thumb|380px|Map showing the northern theatre of the War of 1812]]
American leaders assumed that Canada could be easily overrun. Former President Jefferson optimistically referred to the conquest of Canada as &quot;a matter of marching.&quot; Many Loyalist Americans had migrated to Upper Canada after the Revolutionary War. There was also significant non-Loyalist American immigration to the area due to the offer of land grants to immigrants, and the US assumed the latter would favour the American cause, but they did not. In prewar Upper Canada, General Prevost was in the unusual position of having to purchase many provisions for his troops from the American side. This peculiar trade persisted throughout the war in spite of an abortive attempt by the US government to curtail it. In Lower Canada, which was much more populous, support for Britain came from the English elite with strong loyalty to the Empire, and from the [[Canadien]] elite, who feared American conquest would destroy the old order by introducing Protestantism, Anglicization, republican democracy, and commercial capitalism; and weakening the Catholic Church. The Canadien inhabitants feared the loss of a shrinking area of good lands to potential American immigrants.{{sfn|Burroughs|2000|loc=&quot;Prevost, Sir George&quot;}}

In 1812–13, British military experience prevailed over inexperienced American commanders.  Geography dictated that operations would take place in the west: principally around [[Lake Erie]], near the [[Niagara River]] between Lake Erie and [[Lake Ontario]], and near the [[Saint Lawrence River]] area and [[Lake Champlain]]. This was the focus of the three-pronged attacks by the Americans in 1812. Although cutting the St. Lawrence River through the capture of Montreal and Quebec would have made Britain's hold in North America unsustainable, the United States began operations first in the western frontier because of the general popularity there of a war with the British, who had sold arms to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s opposing the settlers.

The British scored an important early success when their detachment at [[St. Joseph Island]], on [[Lake Huron]], learned of the declaration of war before the nearby American garrison at the important trading post at [[Mackinac Island]] in [[Michigan]]. A scratch force landed on the island on July 17, 1812 and mounted a gun overlooking [[Fort Mackinac]]. After the British fired one shot from their gun, the Americans, taken by surprise, surrendered. This early victory encouraged the natives, and large numbers moved to help the British at [[Amherstburg, Ontario|Amherstburg]].

[[File:KENSETT MAP CANADA 1812.jpg|thumb|Kensett's engraving of Upper &amp; Lower Canada 1812]]
An American army under the command of [[William Hull]] invaded Canada on July 12, with his forces chiefly composed of untrained and ill-disciplined militiamen.{{sfn |Benn |Marston |2006 |p=214}} Once on Canadian soil, Hull issued a proclamation ordering all British subjects to surrender, or &quot;the horrors, and calamities of war will stalk before you.&quot; He also threatened to kill any British prisoner caught fighting alongside a native. The proclamation helped stiffen resistance to the American attacks. Hull's army was too weak in artillery and badly supplied to achieve its objectives, and had to fight just to maintain its own lines of communication.

The senior British officer in Upper Canada, Major General [[Isaac Brock]], felt that he should take bold measures to calm the settler population in Canada, and to convince the aboriginals who were needed to defend the region that Britain was strong.{{sfn |Benn |Marston |2006 |p=214}} He moved rapidly to [[Amherstburg, Ontario|Amherstburg]] near the western end of Lake Erie with reinforcements and immediately decided to [[Siege of Detroit|attack Detroit]]. Hull, fearing that the British possessed superior numbers and that the Indians attached to Brock's force would commit massacres if fighting began, surrendered Detroit without a fight on August 16. Knowing of British-instigated indigenous attacks on other locations, Hull ordered the evacuation of the inhabitants of [[Fort Dearborn]] (Chicago) to Fort Wayne. After initially being granted safe passage, the inhabitants (soldiers and civilians) were attacked by Potowatomis on August 15 after travelling only {{convert|2|mi|km}} in what is known as the [[Battle of Fort Dearborn]].{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=84}} The fort was subsequently burned.

Brock promptly transferred himself to the eastern end of Lake Erie, where American General [[Stephen Van Rensselaer III|Stephen Van Rensselaer]] was attempting a second invasion. An armistice (arranged by Prevost in the hope the British renunciation of the Orders in Council to which the United States objected might lead to peace) prevented Brock from invading American territory. When the armistice ended, the Americans attempted an attack across the [[Niagara River]] on October 13, but suffered a crushing defeat at [[Battle of Queenston Heights|Queenston Heights]]. Brock was killed during the battle. While the professionalism of the American forces would improve by the war's end, British leadership suffered after Brock's death. A final attempt in 1812 by American General [[Henry Dearborn]] to advance north from Lake Champlain failed when his militia refused to advance beyond American territory.

In contrast to the American militia, the Canadian militia performed well. [[French Canadian]]s, who found the anti-Catholic stance of most of the United States troublesome, and [[United Empire Loyalist]]s, who had fought for the Crown during the American Revolutionary War, strongly opposed the American invasion. However, many in Upper Canada were recent settlers from the United States who had no obvious loyalties to the Crown. Nevertheless, while there were some who sympathized with the invaders, the American forces found strong opposition from men loyal to the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fraser|2000|loc=&quot;Mallory, Benajah&quot;}} and {{harvnb|Jones|2000|loc=&quot;Willcocks (Wilcox), Joseph&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====American Northwest, 1813====
{{Main|Ohio in the War of 1812}}
After Hull's surrender of Detroit, General [[William Henry Harrison]] was given command of the U.S. Army of the Northwest. He set out to retake the city, which was now defended by Colonel [[Henry Procter (British Army officer)|Henry Procter]] in conjunction with [[Tecumseh]]. A detachment of Harrison's army was defeated at [[Battle of Frenchtown|Frenchtown]] along the [[River Raisin]] on January 22, 1813. Procter left the prisoners with an inadequate guard, who could not prevent some of his North American aboriginal allies from attacking and killing perhaps as many as sixty Americans, many of whom were Kentucky militiamen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kynghistory.ky.gov/history/1qtr/warof1812.htm |title=Kentucky: National Guard History eMuseum – War of 1812 |publisher=Kynghistory.ky.gov |accessdate=October 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident became known as the [[River Raisin Massacre]]. The defeat ended Harrison's campaign against Detroit, and the phrase &quot;Remember the River Raisin!&quot; became a rallying cry for the Americans.

[[File:Battle erie.jpg|right|thumb|[[Oliver Hazard Perry]]'s message to William Henry Harrison after the [[Battle of Lake Erie]] began with what would become one of the most famous sentences in American military history: &quot;We have met the enemy and they are ours.&quot; This 1865 painting by [[William Henry Powell|William H. Powell]] shows Perry transferring to a different ship during the battle.]]

In May 1813, Procter and Tecumseh set [[Siege of Fort Meigs|siege to Fort Meigs]] in northern [[Ohio]]. American reinforcements arriving during the siege were defeated by the natives, but the fort held out. The Indians eventually began to disperse, forcing Procter and Tecumseh to return to Canada. A second offensive against Fort Meigs also failed in July. In an attempt to improve Indian morale, Procter and Tecumseh attempted to [[Battle of Fort Stephenson|storm Fort Stephenson]], a small American post on the [[Sandusky River]], only to be repulsed with serious losses, marking the end of the Ohio campaign.

On Lake Erie, American commander Captain [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] fought the [[Battle of Lake Erie]] on September 10, 1813. His decisive victory ensured American control of the lake, improved American morale after a series of defeats, and compelled the British to fall back from Detroit. This paved the way for General Harrison to launch another invasion of Upper Canada, which culminated in the U.S. victory at the [[Battle of the Thames]] on October 5, 1813, in which Tecumseh was killed. Tecumseh's death effectively ended the North American indigenous alliance with the British in the Detroit region. American control of Lake Erie meant the British could no longer provide essential military supplies to their aboriginal allies, who therefore dropped out of the war. The Americans controlled the area during the conflict.

====Niagara frontier, 1813====
Because of the difficulties of land communications, control of the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River corridor was crucial. When the war began, the British already had a small squadron of warships on [[Lake Ontario]] and had the initial advantage. To redress the situation, the Americans established a Navy yard at [[Sackett's Harbor, New York]]. Commodore [[Isaac Chauncey]] took charge of the large number of sailors and shipwrights sent there from New York; they completed the second warship built there in a mere 45 days. Ultimately, 3,000 men worked at the shipyard, building eleven warships and many smaller boats and transports. Having regained the advantage by their rapid building program, Chauncey and Dearborn attacked [[York, Upper Canada|York]] (now called [[Toronto]]), the capital of Upper Canada, on April 27, 1813. The [[Battle of York]] was an American victory, marred by looting and the burning of the Parliament buildings and a library. However, [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] was strategically more valuable to British supply and communications along the St. Lawrence. Without control of Kingston, the U.S. navy could not effectively control Lake Ontario or sever the British supply line from [[Lower Canada]].

On May 27, 1813, an American amphibious force from Lake Ontario assaulted [[Fort George, Ontario|Fort George]] on the northern end of the Niagara River and captured it without serious losses. The retreating British forces were not pursued, however, until they had largely escaped and organized a counteroffensive against the advancing Americans at the [[Battle of Stoney Creek]] on June 5. On June 24, with the help of advance warning by [[United Empire Loyalists|Loyalist]] [[Laura Secord]], another American force was forced to surrender by a much smaller British and native force at the [[Battle of Beaver Dams]], marking the end of the American offensive into Upper Canada. Meanwhile, Commodore [[James Lucas Yeo]] had taken charge of the British ships on the lake and mounted a counterattack, which was nevertheless repulsed at the [[Battle of Sackett's Harbor]]. Thereafter, Chauncey and Yeo's squadrons fought two indecisive actions, neither commander seeking a fight to the finish.

Late in 1813, the Americans abandoned the Canadian territory they occupied around Fort George. They set fire to the village of Newark (now [[Niagara-on-the-Lake, Ontario|Niagara-on-the-Lake]]) on December 15, 1813, incensing the Canadians and politicians in control. Many of the inhabitants were left without shelter, freezing to death in the snow. This led to British retaliation following the [[Capture of Fort Niagara]] on December 18, 1813.  Early the next morning on December 19, the British and their native allies stormed the neighbouring town of Lewiston, New York, torching homes and buildings and killing about a dozen civilians. As the British were chasing the surviving residents out of town, a small force of Tuscarora natives intervened and stopped the pursuit, buying enough time for the locals to escape to safer ground. It is notable in that the Tuscaroras defended the Americans against their own Iroquois brothers, the Mohawks, who sided with the British.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.historiclewiston.org/history.html |title= Historic Lewiston, NY |publisher= Historical Association of Lewiston |accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Lewiston monument to mark Tuscarora heroism in War of 1812 |newspaper= [[The Buffalo News]] |date= August 21, 2010 |last= Prohaska |first= Thomas J. |url= http://www.buffalonews.com/city/communities/niagara-county/article44523.ece |accessdate=October 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the British attacked and burned [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] on December 30, 1813.

In 1814, the contest for Lake Ontario turned into a building race. Eventually, by the end of the year, Yeo had constructed [[HMS St. Lawrence (1814)|HMS St. Lawrence]], a [[first-rate]] [[ship of the line]] of 112 guns that gave him superiority, but the [[Engagements on Lake Ontario]] were an indecisive draw.

====St. Lawrence and Lower Canada, 1813====
[[Image:Attack on Fort Oswego (May 1914), War of 1812.jpg|thumb|Attack on [[Fort Oswego]] (May 1814), War of 1812]]
[[File:Six Nations survivors of War of 1812.jpg|thumb|Sakawarton ([[John Smoke Johnson]]), John Tutela, and Young Warner, three [[Iroquois|Six Nations]] veterans of the War of 1812.]]
The British were potentially most vulnerable over the stretch of the St. Lawrence where it formed the frontier between Upper Canada and the United States. During the early days of the war, there was illicit commerce across the river. Over the winter of 1812 and 1813, the Americans launched a series of raids from [[Ogdensburg, New York|Ogdensburg]] on the American side of the river, which hampered British supply traffic up the river. On February 21, Sir George Prevost passed through [[Prescott, Ontario|Prescott]] on the opposite bank of the river with reinforcements for Upper Canada. When he left the next day, the reinforcements and local militia attacked. At the [[Battle of Ogdensburg]], the Americans were forced to retire.

For the rest of the year, Ogdensburg had no American garrison, and many residents of Ogdensburg resumed visits and trade with Prescott. This British victory removed the last American regular troops from the Upper St. Lawrence frontier and helped secure British communications with Montreal. Late in 1813, after much argument, the Americans made two thrusts against Montreal. The plan eventually agreed upon was for Major General [[Wade Hampton I|Wade Hampton]] to march north from Lake Champlain and join a force under General [[James Wilkinson]] that would embark in boats and sail from [[Sackets Harbor, New York|Sackett's Harbor]] on Lake Ontario and descend the St. Lawrence. Hampton was delayed by bad roads and supply problems and also had an intense dislike of Wilkinson, which limited his desire to support his plan. On October 25, his 4,000-strong force was defeated at the [[Battle of the Chateauguay|Chateauguay River]] by [[Charles de Salaberry|Charles de Salaberry's]] smaller force of -[[Canadian Voltigeurs]] and [[Mohawks]]. Wilkinson's force of 8,000 set out on October 17, but was also delayed by bad weather. After learning that Hampton had been checked, Wilkinson heard that a British force under Captain [[William Mulcaster]] and Lieutenant Colonel [[Joseph Wanton Morrison]] was pursuing him, and by November 10, he was forced to land near [[Morrisburg, Ontario|Morrisburg]], about 150 kilometres (90&amp;nbsp;mi.) from Montreal. On November 11, Wilkinson's rear guard, numbering 2,500, attacked Morrison's force of 800 at [[Battle of Crysler's Farm|Crysler's Farm]] and was repulsed with heavy losses. After learning that Hampton could not renew his advance, Wilkinson retreated to the U.S. and settled into winter quarters. He resigned his command after a failed attack on a British outpost at [[Battle of Lacolle Mills (1814)|Lacolle Mills]].

====Niagara and Plattsburgh Campaigns, 1814====
By the middle of 1814, American generals, including Major Generals [[Jacob Brown]] and [[Winfield Scott]], had drastically improved the fighting abilities and discipline of the army. Their renewed attack on the Niagara peninsula quickly captured [[Fort Erie]]. Winfield Scott then gained a victory over an inferior British force at the [[Battle of Chippawa]] on July 5. An attempt to advance further ended with a hard-fought but inconclusive battle at [[Battle of Lundy's Lane|Lundy's Lane]] on July 25.

The outnumbered Americans withdrew but withstood a prolonged [[Siege of Fort Erie]]. The British suffered heavy casualties in a failed assault and were weakened by exposure and shortage of supplies in their siege lines. Eventually the British raised the siege, but American Major General [[George Izard]] took over command on the Niagara front and followed up only halfheartedly. The Americans lacked provisions, and eventually destroyed the fort and retreated across the Niagara.

Meanwhile, following the abdication of Napoleon, 15,000 British troops were sent to North America under four of Wellington’s ablest brigade commanders. Fewer than half were veterans of the Peninsula and the rest came from garrisons. Prevost was ordered to neutralize American power on the lakes by burning Sackets Harbor, gain naval control of Lake Erie, Lake Ontario and the Upper Lakes, and defend Lower Canada from attack. He did defend Lower Canada but otherwise failed to achieve his objectives.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Grodzinski, &quot;Review,&quot; ''Canadian Historical Review'' Volume 91#3 Sep 2010 pp 560–1&lt;/ref&gt; Given the late season he decided to invade New York State. His army outnumbered the American defenders of [[Plattsburgh, New York|Plattsburgh]], but he was worried about his flanks so he decided he needed naval control of Lake Champlain. On the lake, the British squadron under Captain [[George Downie]] and the Americans under Master Commandant [[Thomas Macdonough]] were more evenly matched.

On reaching Plattsburgh, Prevost delayed the assault until the arrival of Downie in the hastily completed 36-gun frigate [[HMS Confiance (1814)|HMS ''Confiance'']]. Prevost forced Downie into a premature attack, but then unaccountably failed to provide the promised military backing. Downie was killed and his naval force defeated at the naval [[Battle of Plattsburgh]] in Plattsburgh Bay on September 11, 1814. The Americans now had control of Lake Champlain; [[Theodore Roosevelt]] later termed it &quot;the greatest naval battle of the war.&quot; The successful land defence was led by [[Alexander Macomb (American general)|Alexander Macomb]]. To the astonishment of his senior officers, Prevost then turned back, saying it would be too hazardous to remain on enemy territory after the loss of naval supremacy. Prevost was recalled and in London, a naval court-martial decided that defeat had been caused principally by Prevost’s urging the squadron into premature action and then failing to afford the promised support from the land forces. Prevost died suddenly, just before his own court-martial was to convene. Prevost's reputation sank to a new low, as Canadians claimed that their militia under Brock did the job and he failed. Recently, however, historians have been more kindly, measuring him not against Wellington but against his American foes. They judge Prevost’s preparations for defending the Canadas with limited means to be energetic, well-conceived, and comprehensive; and against the odds, he had achieved the primary objective of preventing an American conquest.{{sfn|Burroughs|2000|loc=&quot;Prevost, Sir George&quot;}}

The [[Mississippi River]] valley was the western frontier of the United States in 1812. The territory acquired in the [[Louisiana Purchase]] of 1803 contained almost no U.S. settlements west of the Mississippi except around [[St. Louis, Missouri|Saint Louis]] and a few forts and trading posts. [[Fort Bellefontaine]], an old trading post converted to a U.S. Army post in 1804, served as regional headquarters. [[Fort Osage]], built in 1808 along the Missouri was the western-most U.S. outpost, it was abandoned at the start of the war.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2002|p=270}} [[Fort Madison]], built along the Mississippi in what is now Iowa, was also built in 1808, and had been repeatedly attacked by British-allied [[Sauk people|Sauk]] since its construction. In September 1813 Fort Madison was abandoned after it was attacked and besieged by natives, who had support from the British. This was one of the few battles fought west of the Mississippi. [[Black Hawk (chief)|Black Hawk]] played a leadership role.&lt;ref&gt;Cyrenus Cole, ''A history of the people of Iowa'' (1921) pp 69–74&lt;/ref&gt;

Little of note took place on Lake Huron in 1813, but the American victory on Lake Erie and the recapture of Detroit isolated the British there. During the ensuing winter, a Canadian party under Lieutenant Colonel [[Robert McDouall]] established a new supply line from York to [[Nottawasaga Bay]] on [[Georgian Bay]]. When he arrived at Fort Mackinac with supplies and reinforcements, he sent an expedition to recapture the trading post of [[Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin|Prairie du Chien]] in the far west. The [[Siege of Prairie du Chien]] ended in a British victory on July 20, 1814.

Earlier in July, the Americans sent a force of five vessels from Detroit to recapture Mackinac. A mixed force of regulars and volunteers from the militia landed on the island on August 4. They did not attempt to achieve surprise, and at the brief [[Battle of Mackinac Island]], they were ambushed by natives and forced to re-embark. The Americans discovered the new base at Nottawasaga Bay, and on August 13, they destroyed its fortifications and a schooner that they found there. They then returned to Detroit, leaving two gunboats to blockade Mackinac. On September 4, these gunboats were taken unawares and captured by British boarding parties from canoes and small boats. This [[Engagement on Lake Huron]] left Mackinac under British control.

The British garrison at Prairie du Chien also fought off another attack by Major [[Zachary Taylor]]. In this distant theatre, the British retained the upper hand until the end of the war, through the allegiance of several indigenous tribes that received British gifts and arms. In 1814 U.S. troops retreating from the [[Battle of Credit Island]] on the upper Mississippi attempted to make a stand at [[Fort Johnson]], but the fort was soon abandoned, along with most of the upper Mississippi valley.{{sfn|Nolan|2009|pp=85–94}}

After the U.S. was pushed out of the Upper Mississippi region, they held on to eastern Missouri and the St. Louis area. Two notable battles fought against the Sauk were the [[Battle of Cote Sans Dessein]], in April 1815, at the mouth of the Osage River in the Missouri Territory, and the [[Battle of the Sink Hole]], in May 1815, near [[Fort Cap au Gris]].&lt;ref&gt;

At the conclusion of peace, Mackinac and other captured territory was returned to the United States. Fighting between Americans, the Sauk, and other indigenous tribes continued through 1817, well after the war ended in the east.&lt;ref name=first&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaw.on.ca/~jsek/us1inf.htm |title=First United States Infantry |publisher=Iaw.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2012-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Southern theatre===
====Creek War====
{{Main|Creek War}}
[[File:Fort Mims massacre 1813.jpg|thumb|The [[Fort Mims massacre]] in 1813. The Creek warriors attacked the fort, and killed a total of 400 to 500 people.]]
In March 1814, Jackson led a force of [[Tennessee]] militia, [[Choctaw]],{{sfn|Lossing|1869|loc=Chapter 34: War Against the Creek Indians}} [[Cherokee]] warriors, and U.S. regulars southward to attack the [[Creek (people)|Creek]] Indians. On March 26, Jackson and General [[John Coffee]] decisively defeated the Creek at [[Battle of Horseshoe Bend (1814)|Horseshoe Bend]], killing 800 of 1,000 Creeks at a cost of 49 killed and 154 wounded out of approximately 2,000 American and Cherokee forces. Jackson pursued the surviving Creeks until they surrendered. Most historians{{who|date=August 2012}} consider the Creek War as part of the War of 1812, because the British supported them.{{cn|date=August 2012}}

====New Orleans====
{{main|Battle of New Orleans}}
Andrew Jackson heard reports that the British were organizing ships and armies for a large-scale invasion. The British set up a base at [[Pensacola, Florida]] in August 1814; Jackson with 4,000  men took the town in November.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|1997|pp=409–11}} Unaware of the Ghent treaty, Andrew Jackson's force moved to [[New Orleans]], Louisiana, in late 1814. Using 1,000 regulars and 3,000 to 4,000 militia, pirates and other fighters, as well as civilians and slaves sent to work on the fortifications, he built strong defences just south of the city, which was {{convert|150|mi|km}} north of the Gulf.  The 8,000 British regulars under General [[Edward Pakenham]] attacked on January 8, 1815. The [[Battle of New Orleans]] was an American victory, as the British suffered 2,000 casualties: 291 dead (including Pakenham and his second and third in command); 1262 wounded, and 484 captured or missing.&lt;ref&gt;Brooks, Charles B p. 252,{{Verify source|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Reilly|1974|pp=303, 306}}{{sfn|Remini|2001|p=167}} The Americans had 71 casualties: 13 dead, 39 wounded, and 19 missing. It was hailed as a great victory across the U.S., making Jackson a national hero and eventually propelling him to the presidency.{{sfn|Remini|2001|pp=136–83}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/AMH-V1/ch06.htm|title=Chapter 6: The War of 1812 |publisher=Army.mil |accessdate=January 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alabama====
[[James Wilkinson]] captured [[Mobile, Alabama]] from the Spanish in March 1813, and built fortifications.

In early 1815 the British gave up on New Orleans but moved to attack Mobile. In one of the last military actions of the war, 1,000 British troops won the Battle of [[Fort Bowyer]] on February 12, 1815. When news of peace arrived the next day, they abandoned the fort and sailed home.

====Postwar fighting====
In May 1815, a band of British-allied [[Sauk people|Sauk]], unaware that the war had ended months before, attacked a small band of U.S. soldiers northwest of St. Louis.{{sfn|Tanner|1987|p=120}} Intermittent fighting, primarily with the Sauk, continued in the Missouri Territory well into 1817, although it is unknown if the Sauk were acting on their own or on behalf of British agents.&lt;ref name=first/&gt; Several uncontacted isolated warships continued fighting well into 1815 and were the last American forces to take offensive action against the British.

==The Treaty of Ghent==
{{main|Treaty of Ghent}}

===Factors leading to the peace negotiations===
By 1814, both sides had achieved their main war goals and were weary of a costly war that offered little but stalemate. They both sent delegations to a neutral site in Ghent, Belgium.  The negotiations began in early August and concluded on December 24, when a final agreement was signed; both sides had to ratify it before it could take effect.  Meanwhile both sides planned new invasions.

In 1814 the British began blockading New England ports, reducing American foreign trade to a trickle, but hurting British interests in the West Indies and Canada that had depended on that trade.  New England was considering secession.{{sfn |Hickey |1989 |p=231}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Morison|1941|pp=205–206}}&lt;/ref&gt; But although American privateers found chances of success much reduced, with most British merchantmen now sailing in convoy, privateering continued to prove troublesome to the British, as shown by high insurance rates.{{sfn|Hickey|1989|pp=217–218}} British landowners grew weary of high taxes, and colonial interests and merchants called on the government to reopen trade with the U.S. by ending the war.{{sfn|Latimer|2007|pp=362–365}}

===Negotiations and peace===
As the peace talks opened, the British demanded the creation of an Indian barrier state in the American Northwest Territory (the area from Ohio to Wisconsin), and they demanded that Americans not have any naval forces on the Great Lakes. The U.S. rejected the demands and there was an impasse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Spencer C. Tucker|title=The Encyclopedia of North American Indian Wars, 1607–1890: A Political, Social, and Military History: A Political, Social, and Military History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lyNakUZmQ9IC&amp;pg=PA1097|date= 2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|page=1097}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles M. Gates, &quot;The West in American Diplomacy, 1812-1815,&quot; ''Mississippi Valley Historical Review'' (1940) 26#4 pp. 499-510 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1896318 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

American public opinion was outraged when Madison published the demands; even the Federalists were now willing to fight on. The British had planned three invasions. One force burned Washington but failed to capture Baltimore, and sailed away when its commander was killed. In northern New York State, 10,000 British veterans were marching south until a decisive defeat at the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]] forced them back to Canada.&lt;ref group=nb&gt;The British were unsure whether the attack on Baltimore was a failure, but Plattsburg was a humiliation that called for court martial ({{harvnb|Latimer|2007|pp=331,359,365}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing was known of the fate of the third large invasion force aimed at capturing New Orleans and southwest. The Prime Minister wanted the Duke of Wellington to command in Canada and finally win the war; Wellington said that he would go to America but he believed he was needed in Europe.{{sfn|Perkins|1964|pp=108–109}}{{sfn|Hickey|2006|pp=150–151}}{{sfn|Hibbert|1997|p=164}} He also stated:

{{quote|I think you have no right, from the state of war, to demand any concession of territory from America&amp;nbsp;... You have not been able to carry it into the enemy's territory, notwithstanding your military success and now undoubted military superiority, and have not even cleared your own territory on the point of attack. You cannot on any principle of equality in negotiation claim a cessation of territory except in exchange for other advantages which you have in your power&amp;nbsp;... Then if this reasoning be true, why stipulate for the [[uti possidetis]]? You can get no territory: indeed, the state of your military operations, however creditable, does not entitle you to demand any.{{sfn|Mills|1921|pp=19–32}}{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=441}} }}

The Prime Minister, Lord Liverpool, aware of growing opposition to wartime taxation and the demands of Liverpool and Bristol merchants to reopen trade with America, realized Britain had little to gain and much to lose from prolonged warfare.{{sfn|Latimer|2007|pp=389–91}}{{sfn|Gash|1984|pp=111–119}}

On December 24, 1814 the diplomats in Ghent signed the [[Treaty of Ghent]]. The treaty was ratified by the British three days later on December 27{{sfn|Hickey|2006|p=295}}{{sfn|Updyke|1915|p=360}}{{sfn|Perkins|1964|pp=129–130}} and arrived in Washington on February 17 where it was quickly ratified and went into effect, thus finally ending the war. The terms called for all occupied territory to be returned, the prewar boundary between Canada and the United States to be restored, and the Americans were to gain fishing rights in the [[Gulf of Saint Lawrence]].

The treaty ignored the grievances that led to war. American complaints of Indian raids, impressment and blockades had ended when Britain's war with France ended in 1814, and were not mentioned in the treaty.  Mobile and parts of western Florida were not mentioned in the treaty but remained permanently in American possession, despite objections by Spain.{{sfn|Smith|1999}} Thus, the war ended with no significant territorial losses for either side.

Impressment could have become an issue during Napoleon's reappearance for the [[Hundred Days]], for which Britain remanned her fleet; however, the British did not  search American ships for British sailors at Liverpool (even the American official position conceded that they had the right to do in British ports), and when [[William Eustis]], American minister to the Netherlands, complained of the impressment of a seaman off an American ship, the captain responsible was recalled to explain his actions. After the second fall of Napoleon, impressment was largely abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;Irving Brant, ''The Fourth President'', pp. 592–3. Eustis reported to Madison that the seaman was neither American nor of good character; he was protesting the ''act'' of impressment.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Losses and compensation==
British losses in the war were about 1,600 killed in action and 3,679 wounded; 3,321 British died from disease.  American losses were 2,260 killed in action and 4,505 wounded. While the number of Americans who died from disease is not known, it is estimated that about 15,000 died from all causes directly related to the war.{{sfn|Hickey|2006|p=297}} These figures do not include deaths among Canadian militia forces or losses among native tribes.

There have been no estimates of the cost of the American war to Britain, but it did add some £25&amp;nbsp;million to the national debt.&lt;ref&gt;Latimer p 389&lt;/ref&gt;  In the U.S., the cost was $105&amp;nbsp;million, about the same as the cost to Britain.  The national debt rose from $45&amp;nbsp;million in 1812 to $127&amp;nbsp;million by the end of 1815, although by selling bonds and [[Treasury Note (19th century)#War of 1812|treasury notes]] at deep discounts—and often for irredeemable paper money due to the suspension of specie payment in 1814—the government received only $34&amp;nbsp;million worth of specie.{{sfn|Adams|1930|p=385}}{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=303}}

In addition, at least 3,000 American slaves escaped to the British because of their offer of freedom, the same as they had made in the American Revolution.  Many other slaves simply escaped in the chaos of war and achieved their freedom on their own.  The British settled some of the newly freed slaves in Nova Scotia.{{sfn|Schama|2006|p=406}} Four hundred freedmen were settled in New Brunswick.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlanticportal.hil.unb.ca/acva/blackloyalists/en/ &quot;Black Loyalists in New Brunswick, 1789–1853&quot;], Atlantic Canada Portal, University of New Brunswick. Retrieved Feb 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  The Americans protested that Britain's failure to return the slaves violated the Treaty of Ghent.

==Memory and historiography==
===Popular views===
During the 19th century the popular image of the war in the United States was of an American victory, and in Canada, of a Canadian victory. Each young country saw her self-perceived victory as an important foundation of her growing nationhood. The British, on the other hand, who had been preoccupied by Napoleon's challenge in Europe, paid little attention to what was to them a peripheral and secondary dispute, a distraction from the principal task at hand.

===Canadian===
[[File:Battle of Chateauguay.jpg|thumb|[[Canadian Voltigeurs]] in action at the Battle of the Chateauguay]]
In [[British North America]] (which formed the [[Dominion of Canada]] in 1867), the War of 1812 was seen by Loyalists as a victory, as they had successfully defended their borders from an American takeover. The outcome gave Empire-oriented Canadians confidence and, together with the postwar &quot;militia myth&quot; that the civilian militia had been primarily responsible rather than the British regulars, was used to stimulate a new sense of Canadian nationalism.{{sfn|Kaufman|1997|pp=110–135}} [[John Strachan]], the first Anglican bishop of Toronto, created the myth, telling his flock that Upper Canada had been saved from the dangerous republicanism of the American invaders by the heroism of the local citizenry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J. L. Granatstein|title=Canada's Army: Waging War and Keeping the Peace|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=z7E-j1UWuOMC&amp;pg=PA4|year=2011|publisher=U. of Toronto Press|pages=4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pierre Berton|title=Flames Across the Border: 1813–1814|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sJjTGA1mABQC&amp;pg=PT29|year=2011|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|pages=29–30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A long-term implication of the militia myth—which was false, but remained popular in the Canadian public at least until the First World War—was that Canada did not need a regular professional army.&lt;ref&gt;CMH, &quot;Origins of the Militia Myth&quot; (February 2006) [http://www.cdnmilitary.ca/index.php?p=19 online]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Army had done poorly, on the whole, in several attempts to invade Canada, and the Canadians had shown that they would fight bravely to defend their country. But the British did not doubt that the thinly populated territory would be vulnerable in a third war. &quot;We cannot keep Canada if the Americans declare war against us again,&quot; Admiral Sir David Milne wrote to a correspondent in 1817.{{sfn|Toll|2006|pp=458,459}}

By the 21st century it was a forgotten war in Britain and Quebec, although still remembered in the [[rest of Canada]], especially Ontario. In a 2009 poll, 37% of Canadians said the war was a Canadian victory, 9% said the U.S. won, 15% called it a draw, and 39%—mainly younger Canadians—said they knew too little to comment.&lt;ref&gt;Randy Boswell, &quot;Who won War of 1812 baffles poll respondents,&quot; Canwest News Service Dec 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

A February 2012 poll found that in a list of items that could be used to define Canadians' identity, the fact that Canada successfully repelled an American invasion in the War of 1812 places second (25%), only behind the fact that Canada has [[universal health care]] (53%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ipsos Reid|title=Americans (64%) less likely than Canadians (77%) to Believe War of 1812 had Significant Outcomes, Important to formation National Identity, but still more likely to Commemorate War|url=http://www.historica-dominion.ca/sites/default/files/program-logos/war_of_1812_factum_3.pdf|publisher=Ipsos Reid|accessdate=Feb 14, 2012}}{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American===
Today, American popular memory includes the British capture and the burning of Washington in August 1814, which necessitated its extensive renovation.  Another memory is the successful American defence of [[Fort McHenry]] in September 1814, which inspired the lyrics of the U.S. national anthem, &quot;[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web   |url=http://www.si.edu/Encyclopedia_SI/nmah/starflag.htm   |title=The Star-Spangled Banner and the War of 1812   |publisher=Encyclopedia Smithsonian   |accessdate=March 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The successful Captains of the U.S. Navy became popular heroes with plates with the likeness of Decatur, Steward, Hull, and others, becoming popular items. Ironically, many were made in England. The Navy became a cherished institution, lauded for the victories that it won against all odds.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=456}}

The war was somewhat revitalized in the American popular consciousness as a result of the 1959 song &quot;[[The Battle of New Orleans]]&quot;.{{citation needed|date = March 2012}}

===Historians' views===
Historians have differing and more complex interpretations. Historians agree that ending the war with neither side gaining or losing territory allowed for the peaceful settlement of boundary disputes and for the opening of a permanent era of good will and friendly relations between the U.S. and Canada. The war established distinct national identities for Canada and the United States, with a &quot;newly significant border.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades the view of the majority of historians has been that the war ended in stalemate, with the Treaty of Ghent closing a war that had become militarily inconclusive. Neither side wanted to continue fighting since the main causes had disappeared and since there were no large lost territories for one side or the other to reclaim by force. Insofar as they see the war's untriumphant resolution as allowing two centuries of peaceful and mutually beneficial intercourse between the U.S., Britain and Canada, these historians often conclude that all three nations were the &quot;real winners&quot; of the War of 1812. These writers often add that the war could have been avoided in the first place by better diplomacy. It is seen as a mistake for everyone concerned because it was badly planned and marked by multiple fiascoes and failures on both sides, as shown especially by the repeated American failure to seize parts of Canada, and the failed British invasions of New Orleans and upstate New York.{{sfn|Heidler|Heidler|2002|p=137}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Howe|2007|p=74}} See also {{harvnb|Morison|1972|p=302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, other scholars hold that the war constituted a British victory and an American defeat. They argue that the British achieved their military objectives in 1812 (by stopping the repeated American invasions of Canada) and that Canada retained her independence of the United States. By contrast, they say, the Americans suffered a defeat when their armies failed to achieve their war goal of seizing part or all of Canada. Additionally, they argue the US lost as it failed to stop impressment, which the British refused to repeal until the end of the Napoleonic Wars, and the US actions had no effect on the orders in council, which were rescinded before the war started.{{sfn |Benn | 2002 |p=83}}{{sfn|Latimer|2007|pp=3}}

A second minority view is that both the US and Britain won the war—that is, both achieved their main objectives, while the Indians were the losing party.{{sfn|Campbell|2007|p=10}}{{sfn|Turner|2000|pp=130–131}} The British won by losing no territories and achieving their great war goal, the total defeat of Napoleon. U.S. won by (1) securing her honour and successfully resisting a powerful empire once again,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;As [[Winston Churchill]] concluded, &quot;The lessons of the war were taken to heart. Anti-American feeling in Great Britain ran high for several years, but the United States were never again refused proper treatment as an independent power&quot;.{{harvnb|Churchill|2001|p=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus winning a &quot;second war of independence&quot;;{{sfn|Langguth|2006|p=177}}  (2) ending the threat of Indian raids and the British plan for a semi-independent Indian sanctuary—thereby opening an unimpeded path for the United States' westward expansion—and (3) stopping the Royal Navy from restricting American trade and impressing American sailors.&lt;ref&gt;Turner (2000) Zuehlke (2007), Hixson (2001){{Verify source|date=October 2010}}&lt;!-- no page numbers--&gt;; {{harvnb|Williams|1961|p=196}}; {{harvnb|Watts|1987|p=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Indians as losers====
Historians generally agree that the real losers of the War of 1812 were the Indians (called &quot;First Nations&quot; in Canada).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Herd Thompson|author2=Stephen J.

Throughout the war the British had played on terror of the tomahawks and scalping knives of their Indian allies; it worked especially at Hull's surrender at Detroit.  By 1813 Americans had killed Tecumseh and broken his coalition of tribes. Jackson then defeated the enemy Indians in the Southwest. At the peace conference the British demanded an independent Indian state in the Midwest, but by late 1814 the British-Indian alliance had been defeated militarily and the British had to abandon the demand. The withdrawal of British protection gave the Americans a free hand, which resulted in the removal of most of the tribes to [[Indian Territory]] (present-day [[Oklahoma]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2011|p=435-439}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In that sense according to historian Alan Taylor, the final victory at New Orleans had &quot;enduring and massive consequences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2011|p=421}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gave the Americans &quot;continental predominence&quot; while it left the Indians dispossessed, powerless, and vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2011|p=437}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long-term consequences==
{{Main|Results of the War of 1812}}

Neither side lost territory in the war,&lt;ref group=nb&gt;Spain, a British ally,  lost control of the Mobile, Alabama, area to the Americans.&lt;/ref&gt; nor did the treaty that ended it address the original points of contention—and yet it changed much between the United States of America and Britain.

The [[Rush–Bagot Treaty]] was a treaty between the United States and Britain enacted in 1817 that provided for the demilitarization of the Great Lakes and [[Lake Champlain]], where many British naval arrangements and forts still remained. The treaty laid the basis for a demilitarized boundary and was indicative of improving relations between the United States and Great Britain in the period following the War of 1812. It remains in effect to this day.

The Treaty of Ghent established the ''status quo ante bellum''; that is, there were no territorial losses by either side. The issue of impressment was made moot when the Royal Navy, no longer needing sailors, stopped impressment after the defeat of Napoleon. Except for occasional border disputes and the circumstances of the [[American Civil War]], relations between the U.S. and Britain remained generally peaceful for the rest of the 19th century, and the two countries became [[Special Relationship|close allies]] in the 20th century.

Border adjustments between the U.S. and British North America were made in the [[Treaty of 1818]]. A border dispute along the [[Maine]]–[[New Brunswick]] border was settled by the 1842 [[Webster–Ashburton Treaty]] after the bloodless [[Aroostook War]], and the border in the [[Oregon Territory]] was settled by splitting the disputed area in half by the 1846 [[Oregon Treaty]].

===United States===
The U.S. suppressed the native American resistance on its western and southern borders. The nation also gained a psychological sense of complete independence as people celebrated their &quot;second war of independence.&quot;{{sfn|Langguth|2006|pp=1, 177}}{{sfn|Cogliano|2008|p=247}}  Nationalism soared after the victory at the Battle of New Orleans. The opposition [[United States Federalist Party|Federalist Party]] collapsed, and the [[Era of Good Feelings]] ensued.{{sfn|Dangerfield|1952|pp=xi–xiii, 95}}

No longer questioning the need for a strong Navy, the U.S. built three new 74-gun ships of the line and two new 44-gun frigates shortly after the end of the war.{{sfn|Toll|2006|pp=456,467}} (Another frigate had been destroyed to prevent it being captured on the stocks.){{sfn|Roosevelt|1902|pp=[http://www.archive.org/stream/navalwarorhisto00roosgoog#page/n59/mode/1up 47,80]}} In 1816, the U.S. Congress passed into law an &quot;Act for the gradual increase of the Navy&quot; at a cost of $1,000,000 a year for eight years, authorizing 9 ships of the line and 12 heavy frigates.{{sfn|Toll|2006|p=457}} The Captains and Commodores of the U.S. Navy became the heroes of their generation in the U.S. Decorated plates and pitchers of Decatur, Hull, Bainbridge, Lawrence, Perry, and Macdonough were made in Staffordshire, England, and found a ready market in the United States. Three of the war heroes used their celebrity to win national office: [[Andrew Jackson]] ([[United States presidential election, 1828|elected President in 1828 and 1832]]), [[Richard Mentor Johnson]] ([[United States presidential election, 1836|elected Vice President in 1836]]), and [[William Henry Harrison]] ([[United States presidential election, 1840|elected President in 1840]]).

[[New England]] states became increasingly frustrated over how the war was being conducted and how the conflict was affecting them. They complained that the U.S. government was not investing enough in the states' defences militarily and financially, and that the states should have more control over their militia. The increased taxes, the British blockade, and the occupation of some of New England by enemy forces also agitated public opinion in the states.{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=255ff}} As a result, at the [[Hartford Convention]] (December 1814 – January 1815) Federalist delegates deprecated the war effort and sought more autonomy for the New England states. They did not call for secession but word of the angry anti-war resolutions appeared at the same time that peace was announced and the victory at New Orleans was known.  The upshot was that the Federalists were  permanently discredited and quickly disappeared as a major political force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Francis D.

This war enabled thousands of slaves to escape to British lines or ships for freedom, despite the difficulties. The planters' complacency about slave contentment was shocked by their seeing slaves who would risk so much to be free.{{sfn|Schama|2006|p=406}}

===British North America (Canada)===
[[File:Couplandart.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Douglas Coupland]]'s 'Monument to the War of 1812' (2008) in Toronto; depicts toy soldiers]]

A strong hostility to republicanism and American influences permeated western Canada after the war and shaped its policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Donald Harman Akenson|title=The Irish in Ontario: A Study in Rural History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=lTeYpObU3qwC&amp;pg=PA137|year=1999|publisher=McGill-Queens|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immigration from the U.S. was discouraged, and favour was shown the Anglican church as opposed to the more Americanized Methodist church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fred Landon|title=Western Ontario and the American Frontier|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=1sXAAhVML2gC&amp;pg=PA123|year=1941|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|page=123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Battle of York]] showed the vulnerability of Upper and Lower Canada. In the 1820s, work began on [[La Citadelle]] at [[Quebec City]] as a defence against the United States. Additionally, work began on the [[Halifax citadel]] to defend the port against American attacks. From 1826 to 1832, the [[Rideau Canal]] was built to provide a secure waterway not at risk from American cannon fire. To defend the western end of the canal, the British also built [[Fort Henry, Ontario|Fort Henry]] at Kingston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Derek Hayes|title=Canada: An Illustrated History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hrkq7t_4080C&amp;pg=PA117|year=2008|publisher=Douglas &amp; McIntyre|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indigenous nations===
The Native Americans allied to the British lost their cause. The British proposal to create a &quot;neutral&quot; Indian zone in the American West was rejected at the Ghent peace conference and never resurfaced. After 1814 the natives, who lost most of their fur gathering territory, became an undesirable burden to British policymakers who now looked to the United States for markets and raw materials. British agents in the field continued to meet regularly with their former native partners, but they did not supply arms or encouragement and there were no Indian campaigns to stop U.S. expansionism in the Midwest. Abandoned by their powerful sponsor, Great Lakes-area natives ultimately migrated or reached accommodations with the American authorities and settlers.{{sfn|Calloway|1986|pp=1–20}} In the Southeast, Indian resistance had been crushed by General Andrew Jackson; as President (1829–37), Jackson systematically expelled the major tribes to reservations west of the Mississippi.{{sfn|Remini|2002|pp=62–93, 226–281}}

===Bermuda===
[[Bermuda]] had been largely left to the defences of its own militia and privateers prior to U.S. independence, but the Royal Navy had begun buying up land and operating from there in 1795, as its location was a useful substitute for the lost U.S. ports. It originally was intended to be the winter headquarters of the North American Squadron, but the war saw it rise to a new prominence. As construction work progressed through the first half of the 19th century, Bermuda became the permanent naval headquarters in Western waters, housing the Admiralty and serving as a [[Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda|base and dockyard]]. The military garrison was built up to protect the naval establishment, heavily fortifying the archipelago that came to be described as the &quot;Gibraltar of the West.&quot; Defence infrastructure would remain the central leg of Bermuda's economy until after [[World War II]].

===Britain===
The massive ongoing conflict against the [[First French Empire|French Empire]] under [[Napoleon]] ensured that the War of 1812 was never seen as more than a sideshow to the main event by the British.{{sfn|Hickey|1989|p=304}} Britain's blockade of French trade had been entirely successful and the [[Royal Navy]] was the world's dominant nautical power (and would remain so for another century).  While the land campaigns had contributed to saving Canada, the Royal Navy had shut down American commerce, bottled up the U.S. Navy in port and heavily suppressed privateering.  British businesses were demanding  peace so that trade could resume.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=David Stephen Heidler|author2=Jeanne T.

Stearns, ed. ''The Oxford encyclopedia of the modern world'' (2008)  vol 7 p 547&lt;/ref&gt;
