The name Israel has historically been used, in common and religious usage, to refer to the biblical [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] or the entire Jewish nation.&lt;ref name=levine&gt;{{cite quick |news | last = Levine |first = Robert A. |title = See Israel as a Jewish Nation-State, More or Less Democratic |work=The New York Times |date = 7 November 2000 |accessdate =19 January 2011 |url = http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/07/opinion/07iht-edlevine.t.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Hebrew Bible]] the [[Israel (name)|name &quot;Israel&quot;]] was given to the patriarch [[Jacob]] (&lt;small&gt;[[Modern Hebrew|Standard]]&lt;/small&gt;&amp;nbsp;''{{Unicode|Yisraʾel}}'', ''{{Unicode|Isrāʾīl}}''; [[Septuagint]] {{lang-el|Ἰσραήλ}} ''Israēl''; &quot;struggle with God&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |book |title=Longman pronunciation dictionary |first=John C. |last=Wells |publisher=Longman |location=Harlow, England |year=1990 |isbn=0-582-05383-8 |page=381}} entry &quot;Jacob&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;) after he successfully wrestled with the angel of the Lord.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;And he said, Thy name shall be called no more Jacob, but Israel: for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men, and hast prevailed.&quot; ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]], 32:28, 35:10). See also [http://www.mechon-mamre.org/p/pt/pt1312.htm Hosea 12:5].&lt;/ref&gt; Jacob's twelve sons became the ancestors of the [[Israelites]], also known as the ''Twelve Tribes of Israel'' or ''Children of Israel''. Jacob and his sons had lived in [[Canaan]] but were forced by famine to go into Egypt for four generations until [[Moses]], a great-great grandson of Jacob,&lt;ref&gt;{{Bibleverse||Exodus|6:16–20|HE}}&lt;/ref&gt; led the Israelites back into Canaan the &quot;[[The Exodus|Exodus]]&quot;. The earliest archaeological artifact to mention the word &quot;Israel&quot; is the [[Merneptah Stele]] of [[ancient Egypt]] (dated to the late 13th century BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Barton|Bowden|2004|p=126}}. &quot;The Merneptah Stele... is arguably the oldest evidence outside the Bible for the existence of Israel as early as the 13th century BCE.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The area is also known as the [[Holy Land]], being holy for all [[Abrahamic religions]] including Judaism, Christianity, Islam and the [[Bahá'í Faith]]. Prior to the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]] of 1948, the whole region was known by various other names including [[Southern Syria]], [[Syria Palestina]], [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], [[Iudaea Province]], [[Coele-Syria]], [[Retjenu]], Canaan and, particularly, [[Palestine]].

The notion of the &quot;[[Land of Israel]]&quot;, known in Hebrew as ''Eretz Yisrael'' (or ''Eretz Yisroel''), has been important and sacred to the Jewish people since Biblical times. According to the [[Torah]], God [[Promised Land|promised the land]] to the three [[Patriarchs (Bible)|Patriarchs]] of the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;And the Lord thy God will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possessed, and thou shalt possess it; and he will do thee good, and multiply thee above thy fathers.&quot; ({{Bibleverse||Deuteronomy|30:5|HE}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;But if ye return unto me, and keep my commandments and do them, though your dispersed were in the uttermost part of the heaven, yet will I gather them from thence, and will bring them unto the place that I have chosen to cause my name to dwell there.&quot; ({{Bibleverse||Nehemiah|1:9|HE}}).&lt;/ref&gt; On the basis of scripture, the period of the three Patriarchs has been placed somewhere in the early 2nd millennium&amp;nbsp;BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |document |url=http://www.pbs.org/walkingthebible/timeline.html |publisher=Public Broadcast Television |title=Walking the Bible Timeline |work=Walking the Bible |accessdate=29 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] was established around the 11th century BCE.

The northern Kingdom of Israel, as well as Philistine city states fell in 722 BCE, though the southern [[Kingdom of Judah]] and several Phoenician city states continued their existence as the region came under [[Assyria]]n rule. With the emergence of [[Babylonia]]ns, Judah was eventually conquered as well.

===Classical period===
With successive [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian rule]], the region, divided between Syria-Coele province and later the autonomous [[Yehud Medinata]], was gradually developing back into urban society, largely dominated by Judeans. The [[Hellenistic Greece|Greek]] conquests largely skipped the region without any resistance or interest. Incorporated into Ptolemaic and finally Seleucid Empires, southern Levant was heavily [[hellenization|hellenized]], building the tensions between Judeans and Greeks. The conflict erupted in 167 BCE with the [[Maccabean Revolt]], which succeeded in establishing an independent Hasmonean Kingdom in Judah, which later expanded over much of modern Israel, as the Seleucids gradually lost control in the region.

The [[Roman Empire]] invaded the region in 63 BCE, first taking control of Syria, and then intervening in the Hasmonean civil war. The struggle between pro-Roman and pro-Parthian factions in Judea eventually led to the installation of [[Herod the Great]] and consolidation of the [[Herodian Kingdom]] as vassal Judean state of Rome. With the decline of Herodians, Judea, transformed into a Roman province, became the site of a violent struggle of Jews against Greco-Romans, culminating in the [[Jewish-Roman Wars]], ending in wide-scale destruction and genocide. Jewish presence in the region significantly dwindled after the failure of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]] against the Roman Empire in 132 CE.&lt;ref&gt;Oppenheimer, A'haron and Oppenheimer, Nili. ''Between Rome and Babylon: Studies in Jewish Leadership and Society''. Mohr Siebeck, 2005, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there was a continuous small Jewish presence and [[Galilee]] became its religious center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |book |title=Atlas of Jewish History |last=Cohn-Sherbok |first=Dan |year=1996 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-08800-8 |page=58 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web |url=http://people.usd.edu/~clehmann/erp/Palestine/palestin.htm |publisher=The University of South Dakota |title=Palestine: History |accessdate=20 March 2012 |date=18 January 2007 |work=The Online Encyclopedia of the Roman Provinces}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mishnah]] and part of the [[Jerusalem Talmud|Talmud]], central Jewish texts, were composed during the 2nd to 4th centuries CE in Tiberias and Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Morçöl|2006|p=304}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region came to be populated predominantly by Greco-Romans on the coast and Samaritans in the hill-country. Christianity was gradually evolving over Roman paganism, when the area under Byzantine rule was transformed into Deocese of the East, as Palaestina Prima and Palaestina Secunda provinces. Through the 5th and 6th centuries, dramatic events of [[Samaritan Revolts]] reshaped the land, with massive destruction to Byzantine Christian and Samaritan societies and a resulting decrease of the population. After the Persian conquest and the installation of a short lived [[Jewish revolt against Heraclius|Jewish Commonwealth]] in 614 CE, the Byzantine Empire reinstalled its rule in 625 CE, resulting in further decline and destruction.

===Muslim rule===

The [[Jewish Legion]], a group primarily of Zionist volunteers, assisted in the British conquest of Palestine in 1917. Arab opposition to British rule and Jewish immigration led to the [[1920 Palestine riots]] and the formation of a Jewish militia known as the [[Haganah]] (meaning &quot;The Defense&quot; in Hebrew), from which the [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]], or ''Stern Gang'', paramilitary groups later split off.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Scharfstein|1996|p=269}}. &quot;During the First and Second Aliyot, there were many Arab attacks against Jewish settlements...

After World War II, Britain found itself in fierce [[British–Zionist conflict|conflict]] with the [[yishuv|Jewish community]], as the [[Haganah]] joined [[Irgun]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lehi]] in an armed struggle against British rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Fraser|2004|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, hundreds of thousands of Jewish Holocaust survivors and refugees sought a new life far from their destroyed communities in Europe. The Yishuv attempted to bring these refugees to Palestine but many were turned away or rounded up and [[Atlit detainee camp|placed in detention camps]] by the British. In 1947, the British government announced it would withdraw from [[Mandatory Palestine]], stating it was unable to arrive at a solution acceptable to both Arabs and Jews.

On 15 May 1947, the [[General Assembly of the United Nations|General Assembly of the newly formed United Nations]] resolved that a committee, [[United Nations Special Committee on Palestine]] (UNSCOP), be created &quot;to prepare for consideration at the next regular session of the Assembly a report on the question of Palestine&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web |url=http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/F5A49E57095C35B685256BCF0075D9C2 |title=A/RES/106 (S-1) |date=15 May 1947 |work=General Assembly resolution |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Report of the Committee dated 3 September 1947 to the UN General Assembly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web |url=http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/07175DE9FA2DE563852568D3006E10F3 |title=A/364 |date=3 September 1947 |work=Special Committee on Palestine |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the majority of the Committee in Chapter VI proposed a plan to replace the British Mandate with &quot;an independent Arab State, an independent Jewish State, and the City of Jerusalem..., the last to be under an International Trusteeship System&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |document|url=http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/2248AF9A92B498718525694B007239C6 |publisher=United Nations |date=20 April 1949 |accessdate=31 July 2007 |title=Background Paper No. 47 (ST/DPI/SER.A/47)}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 November 1947, the [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] adopted a [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|resolution]] recommending the adoption and implementation of the ''Plan of Partition with Economic Union'' as Resolution 181 (II).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web |url= http://domino.un.org/unispal.nsf/0/7f0af2bd897689b785256c330061d253 |title=A/RES/181(II) of 29 November 1947 |publisher=United Nations |year=1947 |accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Plan attached to the resolution was essentially that proposed by the majority of the Committee in the Report of 3 September 1947.

In July 1976 Israeli commandos carried out a [[Operation Entebbe|rescue mission]] which succeeded in rescuing 102 hostages who were being held by Palestinian guerillas at [[Entebbe International Airport]] close to [[Kampala]], Uganda.

The [[Israeli legislative election, 1977|1977 Knesset elections]] marked a major turning point in Israeli political history as [[Menachem Begin]]'s [[Likud]] party took control from the [[Labor Party (Israel)|Labor Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Bregman|2002|pp=169–170}} &quot;In hindsight we can say that 1977 was a turning point...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Egyptian President [[Anwar El Sadat]] made a trip to Israel and spoke before the [[Knesset]] in what was the first recognition of Israel by an Arab head of state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Bregman|2002|pp=171–174}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the two years that followed, Sadat and Begin signed the [[Camp David Accords]] (1978) and the [[Israel–Egypt Peace Treaty]] (1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Bregman|2002|pp=186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula and agreed to enter negotiations over an autonomy for Palestinians in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Bregman|2002|pp=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 March 1978, a PLO guerilla raid from Lebanon led to the [[Coastal Road Massacre]], in which 38 Israeli civilians were killed and 71 injured. Israel responded by launching an [[1978 South Lebanon conflict|invasion of southern Lebanon]] to destroy the PLO bases south of the Litani River. Most PLO fighters withdrew, but Israel was able to secure southern Lebanon until a UN force and the Lebanese army could take over. However, the PLO soon resumed its [[Palestinian insurgency in South Lebanon|policy of attacks]] against Israel. In the next few years the PLO infiltrated back south and kept up a sporadic shelling across the border. Israel carried out numerous retaliatory attacks by air and on the ground.

Meanwhile, Begin's government actively encouraged Israelis to [[Israeli settlements|settle]] in the occupied West Bank, leading to increasing friction with the Palestinians in that area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |book |title=A history of the modern Middle East |last=Cleveland |first=William L. |year=1999 |publisher=Westview Press |isbn=978-0-8133-3489-9 |page=356 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jerusalem Law|Basic Law: Jerusalem, the Capital of Israel]], passed in 1980, was believed by some to reaffirm Israel's 1967 annexation of Jerusalem by government decree and [[UN Security Council Resolution 478|reignited international controversy]] over the [[Positions on Jerusalem|status of the city]].

On 7 June 1981, the Israeli air force [[Operation Opera|destroyed]] Iraq's sole [[Osirak|nuclear power plant]], which was under construction just outside Baghdad.

Following a series of PLO attacks in 1982, Israel [[1982 Lebanon War|invaded]] Lebanon once again to destroy the bases from which the PLO launched attacks and missiles into northern Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|Bregman|2002|p=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first six days of fighting, the Israelis destroyed the military forces of the PLO in Lebanon and decisively defeated the Syrians. An Israeli government inquiry – the [[Kahan Commission]] – would later hold Begin, Sharon and several Israeli generals as indirectly responsible for the [[Sabra and Shatila massacres]]. In 1985 Israel responded to a Palestinian [[Achille Lauro hijacking|terrorist attack]] in Cyprus by [[Operation Wooden Leg|bombing]] the PLO headquarters in Tunis. Israel withdrew from most of Lebanon in 1986, but maintained a [[Israeli Security Zone|borderland buffer zone]] in [[South Lebanon conflict (1982–2000)|southern Lebanon]] until 2000.

Israel operates under a [[parliamentary system]] as a democratic republic with [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; A member of parliament supported by a parliamentary majority becomes the [[Prime Minister of Israel|prime minister]]—usually this is the chair of the largest party.

Parliamentary elections are scheduled every four years, but unstable coalitions or a [[motion of no confidence|no-confidence vote]] by the Knesset can dissolve a government earlier. The [[Basic Laws of Israel]] function as an [[uncodified constitution]].

===Legal system===
{{Main|Israeli judicial system}}

Israel has a [[Israeli judicial system|three-tier court system]]. At the lowest level are [[magistrate]] courts, situated in most cities across the country. Above them are [[district court]]s, serving both as [[appeal|appellate]] courts and [[trial court|courts of first instance]]; they are situated in five of Israel's six [[Districts of Israel|districts]]. The third and highest tier is the [[Supreme Court of Israel|Supreme Court]], located in Jerusalem; it serves a dual role as the highest court of appeals and the [[Supreme Court of Israel#High Court of Justice|High Court of Justice]]. In the latter role, the Supreme Court rules as a court of first instance, allowing individuals, both citizens and non-citizens, to petition against the decisions of state authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;judiciary&quot;&gt;{{cite quick |document |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Government/Branches%20of%20Government/Judicial/The%20Judiciary-%20The%20Court%20System |publisher=Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs |accessdate=5 August 2007 |date=1 August 2005 |title=The Judiciary: The Court System }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |document |url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news/opinion/editorial/view.bg?articleid=1030205 |publisher=The Boston Herald |title=Israel's high court unique in region |accessdate=15 September 2007 |date=9 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Israel supports the goals of the [[International Criminal Court]], it has not ratified the [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|Rome Statute]], citing concerns about the ability of the court to remain free from political impartiality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |document |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/MFAArchive/2000_2009/2002/6/Israel%20and%20the%20International%20Criminal%20Court |title=Israel and the International Criminal Court| publisher=Office of the Legal Adviser to the [[Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] |date=30 June 2002 |accessdate=20 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel's legal system combines three legal traditions: [[English law|English]] [[common law]], [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], and [[Halakha|Jewish law]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot; /&gt; It is based on the principle of ''[[stare decisis]]'' (precedent) and is an [[adversarial system]], where the parties in the suit bring evidence before the court. Court cases are decided by professional judges rather than juries.&lt;ref name=&quot;judiciary&quot; /&gt; Marriage and divorce are under the jurisdiction of the religious courts: [[Beth din|Jewish]], [[Sharia|Muslim]], Druze, and Christian.

===Israeli-occupied territories===
{{Main|Israeli-occupied territories}}
[[File:Is-wb-gs-gh v3.png|thumb|upright|Map of Israel showing the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, and the Golan Heights]]
In 1967, as a result of the [[Six-Day War]], Israel gained control of the [[West Bank]] (Judaea and Samaria), [[East Jerusalem]], the [[Gaza Strip|Gaza strip]] and the [[Golan Heights]]. Israel also took control of the [[Sinai Peninsula]], but returned it to Egypt as part of the 1979 [[Israel–Egypt Peace Treaty]].

Following Israel's capture of these territories, [[Israeli settlement|settlements]] consisting of Israeli citizens were established within each of them. Israel applied civilian law to the [[Golan Heights Law|Golan Heights]] and [[Jerusalem Law|East Jerusalem]], incorporating them into its sovereign territory and granting their inhabitants permanent residency status and the choice to apply for citizenship. In contrast, the West Bank has remained under [[military occupation]], and Palestinians in this area cannot become citizens. The Gaza Strip is independent of Israel with no Israeli military or civilian presence, but Israel continues to maintain control of its airspace and waters. The Gaza Strip and the West Bank are seen by the Palestinians and most of the international community as the site of a [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|future Palestinian state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |news |title=Solana to Haaretz: New rules of war needed for age of terror |first=Adar |last=Primor |newspaper=Haaretz |date=23 October 2009 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/solana-to-haaretz-new-rules-of-war-needed-for-age-of-terror-1.5588}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |document |url=http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2009a/11/132434.htm |title=United States: &quot;an independent and viable state based on the 1967 lines, with agreed swaps&quot; |date=25 November 2009 |publisher=U.S. Department of State |accessdate=10 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Security Council has declared the annexation of the Golan Heights and East Jerusalem to be &quot;null and void&quot; and continues to view the territories as occupied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web |url=http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/73D6B4C70D1A92B7852560DF0064F101 |title=Resolution 497 (1981) |year=1981 |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |document |url=http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/dde590c6ff232007852560df0065fddb?OpenDocument |title=East Jerusalem: UNSC Res. 478 |year=1980 |publisher=UN |accessdate=10 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Court of Justice]], principal judicial organ of the United Nations, asserted, in its [[International law and the Arab–Israeli conflict#Ruling of the ICJ|2004 advisory opinion]] on the legality of the construction of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]], that the lands captured by Israel in the Six-Day War, including East Jerusalem, are occupied territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |document |title=Arabs will ask UN to seek razing of Israeli wall |publisher=MSNBC |date=9 July 2004 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5400559/ |accessdate=7 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of East Jerusalem in any future peace settlement has at times been a difficult hurdle in negotiations between Israeli governments and representatives of the Palestinians, as Israel views it as its sovereign territory, as well as part of its capital. Most negotiations relating to the territories have been on the basis of [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242]], which emphasises &quot;the inadmissibility of the acquisition of territory by war&quot;, and calls on Israel to withdraw from occupied territories in return for normalization of relations with Arab states, a principle known as &quot;[[Land for peace]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |document |title=Olmert: Willing to trade land for peace |publisher=[[Ynetnews]] |date =16 December 2006 |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3340641,00.html |accessdate=26 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |news |title=Syria ready to discuss land for peace |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=12 June 2007 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=64667 |accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |news |title=Egypt: Israel must accept the land-for-peace formula |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=15 March 2007 |url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=54876 |accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The West Bank was annexed by Jordan in 1948, following the Arab rejection of the UN decision to create two states in Palestine. Only Britain recognized this annexation and Jordan has since [[Israel–Jordan peace treaty#cite note-0|ceded]] its claim to the territory to the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]]. The West Bank was occupied by Israel in 1967 during the Six-Day War.

The Gaza Strip was [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|occupied by Egypt from 1948 to 1967]] and then by Israel after 1967. In 2005, as part of [[Israel's unilateral disengagement plan]], Israel removed all of its settlers and forces from the territory. Israel does not consider the Gaza Strip to be occupied territory and declared it a &quot;foreign territory&quot;.

The city of [[Jerusalem]] is of special importance to Jews, Muslims and Christians as it is the home of sites that are pivotal to their religious beliefs, such as the Israeli-controlled [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] that incorporates the [[Western Wall]] and the [[Temple Mount]], the [[Al-Aqsa Mosque]] and the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |book |title=Jerusalem: its sanctity and centrality to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam |last=Levine |first=Lee I. |year=1999 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |isbn=978-0-8264-1024-5 |page=516 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The administrative center of the [[Bahá'í Faith]] and the [[Shrine of the Báb]] are located at the [[Bahá'í World Centre]] in [[Haifa]] and the leader of the faith is buried in [[Acre, Israel|Acre]].

Israel has also been the home of two leading Palestinian poets and writers: [[Emile Habibi]], whose novel ''The Secret Life of Saeed the Pessoptimist'', and other writings, won him the Israel prize for Arabic literature; and [[Mahmoud Darwish]], considered by many to be &quot;the Palestinian national poet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7551918.stm |newspaper=BBC News |date=9 August 2008 |title=Palestinian 'national poet' dies}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwish was born and raised in northern Israel, but lived his adult life abroad after joining the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]].

===Music and dance===
{{Main|Music of Israel}}
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 4023 The Tel Aviv Performing Arts Center.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tel Aviv Performing Arts Center]].]]
[[Music of Israel|Israeli music]] contains musical influences from all over the world; [[Sephardic music]], [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] melodies, [[Belly dance|Belly dancing]] music, [[Music of Greece|Greek music]], [[jazz]], and [[pop rock]] are all part of the music scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets |Broughton |Ellingham |Trillo |1999 |pp=365–369}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web |url=http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/view/page.basic/country/content.country/israel_36 |publisher=National Geographic Society |title=Israel |work=World Music |accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The nation's canonical [[folk music|folk songs]], known as &quot;Songs of the Land of Israel,&quot; deal with the experiences of the pioneers in building the Jewish homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web |url=http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/view/page.basic/genre/content.genre/israeli_folk_735/en_US |publisher=National Geographic Society |title=Israeli Folk Music |accessdate=20 March 2012 |work=World Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hora (dance)|Hora]] (הורה) circle dance introduced by early Jewish settlers was originally popular in the Kibbutzim and outlying communities. It became a symbol of the Zionist reconstruction and of the ability to experience joy amidst austerity. It now plays a significant role in modern Israeli folk dancing and is regularly performed at weddings and other celebrations, and in group dances throughout Israel.

Modern dance in Israel is a flourishing field, and several Israeli choreographers such as [[Ohad Naharin]], Rami Beer, [[Barak Marshall]] and many others, are considered to be among the most versatile and original international creators working today. Famous Israeli companies include the [[Batsheva Dance Company]] and the Kibbutz Contemporary Dance Company.

Israel is home to many Palestinian musicians, including internationally acclaimed [[oud]] and violin virtuoso Taiseer Elias, singer [[Amal Murkus]], and brothers Samir and [[Wissam Joubran]]. Israeli Arab musicians have achieved fame beyond Israel's borders: Elias and Murkus frequently play to audiences in Europe and America, and oud player Darwish Darwish (Prof. Elias's student) was awarded first prize in the all-Arab oud contest in Egypt in 2003. The [[Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance]] has an advanced degree program, headed by Taiseer Elias, in Arabic music.

===Cinema and theatre===
{{Main|Cinema of Israel}}
[[File:Diamond Theatre.jpg|left|thumb|Diamond Theatre.]]
Ten Israeli films have been final nominees for [[Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film|Best Foreign Language Film]] at the [[Academy Award]]s since the establishment of Israel. The 2009 movie ''[[Ajami (film)|Ajami]]'' was the third consecutive nomination of an Israeli film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |news |title='Ajami' nominated for Oscar |first=Hannah |last=Brown |newspaper=Jerusalem Post |date=2 February 2010 |url=http://www.jpost.com/ArtsAndCulture/Entertainment/Article.aspx?id=167582 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Continuing the strong [[Yiddish theatre|theatrical traditions]] of the Yiddish theater in Eastern Europe, Israel maintains a vibrant theatre scene. Founded in 1918, [[Habima Theatre]] in Tel Aviv is Israel's oldest [[repertory]] theater company and national theater.&lt;ref&gt;{{he icon}} {{cite quick |document |url=http://www.habima.co.il/ |title=התיאטרון הלאומי הבימה |publisher=Habima National Theatre |accessdate=13 August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Palestinian Israeli filmmakers have made a number of films, some of them controversial, dealing with the Arab-Israel conflict and the status of Palestinians within Israel. [[Mohammed Bakri]]'s 2002 film ''[[Jenin, Jenin]]'', about an Israeli military action in the West Bank town of Jenin, won the Best Film award at the Carthage International film festival, but was widely criticized within Israel for allegedly distorting the story of the battle. ''Ajami'', a 2009 film about violence and discrimination in a mixed Jewish-Arab neighborhood in south Tel Aviv-Jaffa, was written and directed jointly by Palestinain Scandar Copti and Jewish Israeli Yaron Shani. It won an honorable mention in the Cannes Film Festival. ''[[The Syrian Bride]]'', about a Druze wedding between families on opposite sides of the Israel–Syria ceasefire line in the Golan Heights, was directed by a Jewish Israeli (Eran Riklis), but had an almost completely Druze cast.

Israeli [[cuisine]] includes local dishes as well as dishes brought to the country by Jewish immigrants from around the world. Since the establishment of the State in 1948, and particularly since the late 1970s, an Israeli [[fusion cuisine]] has developed.

Israeli cuisine has adopted, and continues to adapt, elements of various styles of [[Jewish cuisine]], particularly the [[Cuisine of the Mizrahi Jews|Mizrahi]], [[Cuisine of the Sephardic Jews|Sephardic]], and [[Ashkenazi cuisine|Ashkenazi]] styles of cooking, along with [[Moroccan Jews|Moroccan Jewish]], [[Iraqi Jews|Iraqi Jewish]], [[Ethiopian Jewish]], [[Indian Jewish]], [[Iranian Jews|Iranian Jewish]] and [[Yemenite Jews|Yemeni Jewish]] influences. It incorporates many foods traditionally eaten in the [[Arab cuisine|Arab]], [[Middle Eastern cuisine|Middle Eastern]] and [[Mediterranean cuisine]]s, such as ''[[falafel]]'', ''[[hummus]]'', ''[[shakshouka]]'', ''[[couscous]]'', and ''[[za'atar]]'', which have become common ingredients in Israeli cuisine.

|{{note|capital-disp}}The [[Jerusalem Law]] states that &quot;Jerusalem, complete and united, is the capital of Israel&quot; and the city serves as the seat of the government, home to the President's residence, government offices, supreme court, and [[Knesset|parliament]]. [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 478]] (20 August 1980; 14–0, U.S. abstaining) declared the Jerusalem Law &quot;null and void&quot; and called on member states to withdraw their diplomatic missions from Jerusalem. The United Nations and all member nations refuse to accept the Jerusalem Law (see {{Harvard citation no brackets|Kellerman|1993|p=140}}) and maintain their embassies in other cities such as Tel Aviv, [[Ramat Gan]], and [[Herzliya]] &lt;small&gt;(see the [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/is.html CIA Factbook] and [http://www.un.org/Depts/Cartographic/map/profile/israel.pdf Map of Israel])&lt;/small&gt;. The U.S. Congress subsequently adopted the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]], which said that the U.S. embassy should be relocated to Jerusalem and that it should be recognized as the capital of Israel. However, the US Justice Department Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the provisions of the act &quot;invade exclusive presidential authorities in the field of foreign affairs and are unconstitutional&quot;. Since passage of the act, all Presidents serving in office have determined that moving forward with the relocation would be detrimental to U.S. national security concerns and opted to issue waivers suspending any action on this front. The [[Palestinian Authority]] sees [[East Jerusalem]] as the capital of a [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|future Palestinian state]]. The city's final status awaits future negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority &lt;small&gt;(see [http://www.pij.org/details.php?id=460 &quot;Negotiating Jerusalem,&quot; Palestine–Israel Journal])&lt;/small&gt;.
