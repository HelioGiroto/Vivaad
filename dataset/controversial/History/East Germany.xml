The '''German Democratic Republic''' ('''GDR'''; German: ''Deutsche Demokratische Republik'' {{IPA-de|ˈdɔʏtʃə demoˈkʀaːtɪʃə ʀepuˈbliːk|}} or ''DDR''), informally known in [[English language|English]] as '''East Germany''', was a [[socialist state]] established by the [[Soviet Union]] in 1949 out of the [[Soviet occupation zone|Soviet zone]] of [[occupied Germany]], including [[East Berlin]] of the Allied-occupied capital city. The GDR had an area of 107,771&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (41,610&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), bordering [[Czechoslovakia]] to the south, [[West Germany]] to the south and west, [[Poland]] to the east, and the [[Baltic Sea]] to the north. East Germany ceased to exist when its federal states were re-established and acceded to the [[Federal Republic of Germany]] on 3 October 1990 (see [[German reunification]]).

The GDR had a complex and controversial [[History of East Germany|history]]. While the [[West Germany|Western]] government, which acknowledged itself as the legal successor to the [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]], was regarded by the East as nothing other than an extension of the old [[Nazi]] regime, those who opposed the East regarded it as a [[puppet state]] for the Soviet Union. During the years of Nazi control, it was [[Nazism and race|taught]] that [[Russian people|Russian]]s, along with all [[Slavic peoples]], were &quot;''[[Untermensch]]en''&quot; – or &quot;''sub-human''&quot;. Because of this, some East Germans saw the Soviet occupation of their country as shameful and regarded the new regime with contempt. The [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]], formed out of the merging of the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic Party]], was often referred to by such people as the &quot;Russian Party&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jörg Echternkamp, Stefan Martens. Experience and Memory: The Second World War in Europe. Berghahn Books, 2010, p. 218. (&quot;The SED was considered the enforcer of the occupation power by a large segment of the population, or simply the “Russian party&quot;.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; The combination of the state's perceived illegitimacy by some East Germans and post-war economic problems resulted in 2.7 million East Germans violating the GDR ban on leaving the country by going to West Germany in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Training socialist citizens: sports and the state in East Germany. Leiden, Netherlands; Danvers, Massachusetts, US: Koninklijke Brill NV, 2006, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Frontier barriers were constructed to prevent further depopulation caused by emigration to West Germany, the most prominent of which being the [[Anti-Fascist Protection Wall]] – commonly known as the &quot;Berlin Wall&quot; – constructed in 1961, which finally closed the loop hole in the GDR border between [[East Berlin]] and [[West Berlin]].

In 1989, a non-violent movement called for the end of German division and for the expansion of civil liberties. A border security crisis ensued resulting in many GDR citizens emigrating through [[Czechoslovakia]] and [[Hungary]]. The Soviet Union, under the [[Perestroika|reformist]] leadership of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], refused to intervene on the basis of his policy to de-escalate the Cold War and let East Germany resolve its own crisis. On 9 November, destruction of the Berlin Wall began. On 3 October 1990, the five states of the German Democratic Republic joined the Federal Republic of Germany, ending over 40 years of division and becoming a single [[Germany]].

== Naming conventions ==
The official name was ''Deutsche Demokratische Republik'' (German Democratic Republic), usually abbreviated as ''DDR''. Both terms were used in East Germany with an increasing emphasis on the abbreviated name, especially since East Germany considered West Germans and West Berliners to be foreigners following the promulgation of its [[Constitution of East Germany#1968 constitution|second constitution]] in 1968.

''Ostzone'' (Eastern Zone) or ''Soviet Zone'' were two surrogate names for East Germany that were often used colloquially{{by whom|date=March 2012}}. {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The different names used to describe the German Democratic Republic reflected political positions during the [[Cold War]] conflict; for example, many Westerners doubted the political sovereignty and democratic constitution of East Germany. Surrogate name usage for East Germany could thus reveal the political leaning  of a person or news source.  So the media controlled by the East German government emphasised the use of the official name, DDR, while West Germans, western media and statesmen may have used other names such as [[Middle Germany]], emphasising the location of East Germany in the centre of pre-1937 Germany.

The name Sowjetische Besatzungszone (Soviet Occupation Zone, often abbreviated to SBZ) was used by those who wanted to indicate that East Germany lacked sovereignty, whereas others used ''Ostzone'' or ''der Osten'' (''Eastern Zone'' or ''the East'') to avoid the actual name of the state{{citation needed|date=March 2012}}. The latter term, because it was based plainly on geographic location, was sometimes also used by East Germans. Some [[Axel Springer AG|West German media]] referred to East Germany initially as the ''SBZ'' and later consistently named it the ''so-called &quot;GDR&quot;'' (sogenannte &quot;DDR&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;The last division: a history of Berlin, 1945–1989, Ann Tusa, p.73&lt;/ref&gt;

However, over time East Germany's abbreviation ''DDR'' became colloquial also among most West Germans and West German media.&lt;ref&gt;However, the usage of the abbreviation ''BRD'' (FRG) for the West German, ''Bundesrepublik Deutschland'' (''Federal Republic of Germany''), was never accepted in West Germany since it was considered a political statement. Thus BRD (FRG) was a term used by East Germans, or it might have been used by West Germans who held a pro-East German view. Colloquially, West Germans called West Germany simply Germany, or, alternatively, ''Bundesrepublik'' or ''Bundesgebiet'' (federal republic, or federal territory, respectively), referring to the country and ''Bundesbürger'' (federal citizen[s]) for its citizens, with the adjective, ''bundesdeutsch'' (federally German).&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ostdeutschland'' (an ambiguous term meaning simultaneously East or Eastern Germany) was not commonly used in East or West German common parlance to refer to the German Democratic Republic, because ''Ostdeutschland'' usually referred to the [[former eastern territories of Germany]].

The term ''Westdeutschland'' ([[West Germany]]) when used by West Germans was almost always a reference to the geographic region of [[Western Germany]] but not to the area within the boundaries of the Federal Republic of Germany. However, this usage was not always consistent, as, for example, West Berliners frequently applied the term ''Westdeutschland'' to denote the Federal Republic.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

{{Further|History of Germany}}
[[File:Soviet Sector Germany.png|thumb|'''Germany defeated:''' On the basis of the [[Potsdam Conference]], the Allies jointly occupied Germany west of the [[Oder–Neisse line]].]]
According to German historian [[Jürgen Kocka]] (2010):
:Conceptualizing the GDR as a dictatorship has become widely accepted, while the meaning of the concept dictatorship varies. Massive evidence has been collected that proves the repressive, undemocratic, illiberal, nonpluralistic character of the GDR regime and its ruling party.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jürgen Kocka|title=Civil Society and Dictatorship in Modern German History|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=j8mo4uP3SQMC&amp;pg=PA37|date= 2010|publisher=UPNE|page=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Explaining the internal impact of the DDR regime from the perspective of German history in the long term, historian Gerhard A. Ritter (2002) has argued that the East German state was defined by two dominant forces – Soviet Communism on the one hand, and German traditions filtered through the interwar experiences of German Communists on the other. It always was constrained by the powerful example of the increasingly prosperous West, to which East Germans compared their nation. The changes wrought by the Communists were most apparent in ending capitalism and transforming industry, agriculture, in the militarization the society, and the political thrust of the educational system and the media. On the other hand, there was relatively little change made in the historically independent  domains of the sciences, the engineering professions, the Protestant churches, and in many bourgeois life styles.  Social policy, says Ritter, became a critical legitimization tool in the last decades and mixed socialist and traditional elements about equally.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard A. Ritter, &quot;Die DDR in der Deutschen Geschichte,&quot; [The GDR in German history] ''Vierteljahrshefte für Zeitgeschichte,'' Apr 2002, Vol. 50 Issue 2, pp 171–200; this author is the son of historian [[Gerhard Ritter]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Origins ===
At the [[Yalta Conference]] during World War II, the Allies (the U.S., Britain, and the Soviet Union) agreed on dividing a defeated Germany into occupation zones,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/2WWyalta.htm |title=Yalta Conference |publisher=spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk |accessdate=25 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on dividing Berlin, the German capital, among the Allied powers as well. Initially this meant the construction of three zones of occupation, i.e., American, British, and Soviet. Later, a French zone was carved out of the American and British zones.

=== GDR created 1949 ===
{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}
The ruling Communist party, known as the &quot;[[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]]&quot; (SED), was formed in April 1946 from the merger between the [[German Communist Party]] (KPD) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) by mandate of [[Joseph Stalin]]. The two former parties were notorious rivals when they were active before the Nazis consolidated all power and criminalised their agitation. The unification of the two parties was symbolic of the new friendship of German socialists in defeating their common enemy, however, Communists who made a majority had virtually total control over policy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hdg.de/lemo/html/Nachkriegsjahre/PolitischerNeubeginn/sed.html Political new beginning: SED (Socialist Unity Party of Germany)]&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Walter Ulbricht]] noted, everything was made to look democratic while in reality Communists retained control in the background. They were totally loyal to Stalin, and realized their regime would collapse if it lost the backing of the Soviet army—as indeed happened in 1989. Historians debate whether the decision to form a separate country was initiated by Stalin or by the SED.&lt;ref&gt;See Spilker (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

As West Germany was reorganized and gained independence from the occupation, the German Democratic Republic was established in East Germany in 1949. The creation of the two states made the 1945 division of Germany permanent.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://web.ku.edu/~eceurope/hist557/lect17.htm Anna M. Cienciala &quot;History 557 Lecture Notes]&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 March 1952, (in what would become known as the &quot;[[Stalin Note]]&quot;) Stalin put forth a proposal to reunify Germany with a policy of neutrality, with no conditions on economic policies and with guarantees for &quot;the rights of man and basic freedoms, including freedom of speech, press, religious persuasion, political conviction, and assembly&quot; and free activity of democratic parties and organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Steininger, Rolf (1990). The German Question: The Stalin Note of 1952 and the Problem of Reunification. New York: Columbia University&lt;/ref&gt; However, leadership of West Germany saw reunification as a rather abstract goal. Western powers chose to decline on this proposal, due to belief that Germany should be able to join [[NATO]] and that such a negotiation with the Soviet Union would be seen as a capitulation. Afterwards, there had been several debates about whether a real chance for reunification had been missed in 1952.

In 1949 the Soviets turned control of East Germany over to the Socialist Unity Party, headed by [[Wilhelm Pieck]] (1876–1960), who became president of the GDR and remained officially 'Number One' until his death in 1960, while most executive authority was assumed by SED General Secretary Walter Ulbricht. Socialist leader [[Otto Grotewohl]] (1894–1964) became prime minister until his death. In a major speech to an SED party conference on 28 March 1956, Grotewohl condemned abuses in the legal system. He denounced illegal arrests, called for more respect for civil rights, and even asked the parliament to develop lively debate.&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Gary. &quot;Review of Hoffmann, Dierk, _Otto Grotewohl (1894-1964): Eine politische Biographie_&quot; H-German, H-Net Reviews. November, 2010. [https://www.h-net.org/reviews/showrev.php?id=31618 online]&lt;/ref&gt;

West Germany saw itself as the legal successor to the [[Third Reich]], shouldering the burdens of legal responsibility for its crimes. By contrast, East Germany renounced ties to the Nazi past, styling itself the &quot;anti-fascist rampart&quot; and proclaiming itself the first socialist state on German soil. It refused to admit existences of anti-semitism and refused to recognize Israel or reimburse victims of the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref&gt;David S. Wyman and Charles H. Rosenzveig, ''The world reacts to the Holocaust'' (1996) p 457-66&lt;/ref&gt; The SED set a primary goal of ridding the GDR of all traces of the fascist regime, by ensuring democratic elections and the protection of individual liberties in the building up socialism.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://germanhistorydocs.ghi-dc.org/pdf/eng/Parties%20SZ%204%20ENG_BOOK.pdf SED Party Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Soviet role ===
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
In 1955, the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] declared the [[Soviet occupation zone]] – the historic middle portion of Germany – to be a sovereign state named the ''Deutsche Demokratische Republik'' (German Democratic Republic, established in 1949), while the [[Red Army]] and the Western Allies' occupation forces remained in place under the tripartite [[Potsdam Agreement]] (1945) which established the [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Allied Occupation of Germany]].

The Communist German Democratic Republic was established in the historic &quot;Mitteldeutschland&quot; ([[Middle Germany]]). Former German territories east of the [[Oder]] and [[Lusatian Neisse|Neisse]] rivers, mainly the [[Prussia]]n provinces of [[Pomerania]], [[East Prussia]], [[West Prussia]], [[Province of Upper Silesia|Upper Silesia]], [[Province of Lower Silesia|Lower Silesia]], the eastern [[Neumark]] of [[Brandenburg]], and a small piece of [[Saxony]]  were thus detached from Germany. To compensate Poland for the USSR's annexation of its eastern provinces, the Allies provisionally established Poland's post-war western border at the [[Oder–Neisse line]] at the [[Yalta Conference]] (1945). As a result, most of Germany's central territories became the ''Sowjetische Besatzungszone'' (SBZ, Soviet Occupation Zone). All other lands east of the Oder–Neisse line were put under Polish administration, with the [[Kaliningrad Oblast|exception]] of historic northern [[East Prussia]], which went to the USSR.

=== Zones of occupation ===
{{Further|Allied-occupied Germany}}

In the Yalta and Potsdam conferences, the Allies established their joint military occupation and administration of Germany via the [[Allied Control Council]] (ACC), a four-power (US, UK, USSR, France) [[military occupation|military government]] effective until the restoration of German sovereignty. In eastern Germany, the Soviet Occupation Zone (SBZ – ''Sowjetische Besatzungszone'') comprised the five states (''Länder'') of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Brandenburg]], [[Saxony]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], and [[Thuringia]]. Disagreements over the policies to be followed in the occupied zones quickly led to a breakdown in cooperation between the four powers, and the Soviets administered their zone without regard to the policies implemented in the other zones.  The Soviets withdrew from the ACC in 1948; subsequently as the other three zones were increasingly unified and granted self-government, the Soviet administration facilitated the development of a separate socialist government in its zone.

Yet, seven years after the Allies’ [[Potsdam Agreement]] to a unified Germany, the USSR via the [[Stalin Note]] (10 March 1952) proposed [[German reunification]] and [[superpower disengagement]] from Central Europe, which the three Western Allies (US, France, UK) rejected. Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]], a communist proponent of reunification, was dead by March 1953. Similarly, [[Lavrenty Beria]], the First Deputy Prime Minister of the USSR, pursued German reunification, but an internal (Party) [[coup d'état|''coup d’étât'']] [[deposition (politics)|deposed]] him from government in mid-1953, before he could act on the matter. His successor, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], rejected reunification as equivalent to returning East Germany for annexation to the West; hence reunification went unconsidered until the German Democratic Republic collapsed in 1989.

[[File:West and East Berlin.svg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;West and East Berlin with Berlin wall {{nowrap|([http://sharemap.org/public/West_and_East_Berlin interactive map])}}]]
East Germany and the [[Eastern Bloc]] diplomatically recognised [[East Berlin]] as the capital city of the German Democratic Republic, but the Western Allies disputed said recognition, considering the entire city of Berlin an [[military occupation|occupied territory]] governed by the [[martial law]] of the [[Allied Control Council]]. According to Margarete Feinstein, East Berlin's status as the capital was largely unrecognized by the West and most Third World countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;German Democratic Republic page 78&quot;&gt;&quot;State symbols: the quest for legitimacy in the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, 1949–1959&quot;, by Margarete Myers Feinstein, page 78: &quot; ... claims of East Berlin as the capital of the GDR, ... East Berlin was not recognized by the West and most Third World countries&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, the ACC’s authority was rendered moot by the [[Cold War]], and the East German government ignored the legal restrictions on integration of East Berlin into the GDR.

Abetted by ACC’s weakness, Cold War political conflicts among the Allies over the status of West Berlin provoked the [[Berlin Blockade]] (24 June 1948 – 12 May 1949), in which the Soviet army stopped all Allied rail, road, and water traffic to and from West Berlin. The Allies countered the Soviets with the [[Berlin Airlift]] (1948–49) of food, fuel, and supplies to keep West Berlin alive.&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Haydock, ''City Under Siege: The Berlin Blockade and Airlift, 1948–1949'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partition===
{{History of Germany}}
In 1946, the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (''Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands'' – KPD) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (''Sozialdemokratische Partei Deutschlands'' – SPD) merged to form the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED – ''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'') (21 April 1945), which then won the elections of 1946, held under the oversight of the Soviet army. Being a [[Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] political party, the SED's government [[nationalization|nationalised]] infrastructure and industrial plants.

In 1948, the [[German Economic Commission]] (Deutsche Wirtschaftskomission—DWK) under its chairman [[Heinrich Rau]] assumed administrative authority in the Soviet occupation zone, thus becoming the predecessor of an East German government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Weitz|1997|p=350:}} Following a Soviet order in February 1948, the German Economic Commission became a nascent state structure for all intents and purposes, with competence far beyond the economy proper and it was granted power to issue orders and directives to all German organs within the Soviet Occupation Zone.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|McCauley|1983|p=38:}} It (the DWK) had become the de facto government of the Soviet zone. Its chairman was Heinrich Rau (SED) and four of his six deputies were also SED members.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October 1949, the SED established the ''Deutsche Demokratische Republik'' (German Democratic Republic – GDR), based on a socialist political constitution establishing its control of the [[Anti-Fascism|anti-fascist]] [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front of the German Democratic Republic]] (NF – ''Nationale Front der Deutschen Demokratischen Republik''), an omnibus alliance of every party and mass organisation in East Germany. The NF was established to stand for election to the ''Volkskammer'' (&quot;[[People's Chamber]]&quot;), the East German parliament. The first (and only) President of the German Democratic Republic was [[Wilhelm Pieck]]. However, after 1950, the true ruler of East Germany was [[Walter Ulbricht]], the First Secretary of the SED.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Major and Jonathan Osmund, ''Workers' and Peasants' State: Communism and Society in East Germany under Ulbricht, 1945–71'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 June 1953, workers constructing the new ''[[Stalinallee]]'' boulevard in [[East Berlin]] rioted against a 10% production quota increase. Initially a labour protest, it soon included the general populace, who added their anti-Soviet discontent to the workers' civil disobedience, and on 17 June similar protests occurred throughout the GDR, with more than a million people [[General strike|striking]] in some 700 cities and towns. Fearing anti-communist [[counter-revolution]] on 18 June 1953, the government of the GDR enlisted the [[Group of Soviet Occupation Forces in Germany|Soviet Occupation Forces]] to aid the ''[[Volkspolizei]]'' (&quot;People's Police&quot;) in suppressing the rioters; some fifty people were killed and some 10,000 were jailed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,894998,00.html East Berlin 17 June 1953: Stones Against Tanks], ''Deutsche Welle''. Retrieved 16 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Victor Baras, &quot;Beria's Fall and Ulbricht's Survival,&quot; ''Soviet Studies,'' 1975, Vol. 27 Issue 3, pp. 381–395&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany]].)

The German [[war reparations]] owed to the USSR impoverished the Soviet Zone of Occupation and severely weakened the East German economy. In the 1945–46 period, the Soviets confiscated and transported to the USSR approximately 33% of the industrial plant and by the early 1950s had extracted some US$10 billion in reparations in agricultural and industrial products.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman M. Naimark 1949, pp. 167-9&quot;&gt;Norman M. Naimark. ''The Russians in Germany: A History of the Soviet Zone of Occupation, 1945–1949.'' Harvard University Press, 1995. ISBN 0-674-78405-7 pp. 167–9&lt;/ref&gt;

The poverty of East Germany induced by reparations provoked the ''[[Republikflucht]]'' (&quot;flight from the republic&quot;) to West Germany, aggravating the emigration, continual since the 1940s, from the Soviet zone of Germany to the Western Allied zones, further weakening the GDR's economy. Western economic opportunities and lack of political freedom in East Germany induced a [[brain drain]]. In response, the GDR closed the [[Inner German Border]], and on the night of 12–13 August 1961, East German soldiers began erecting the [[Berlin Wall]] which prevented anyone from escaping.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Taylor, ''Berlin Wall: A World Divided, 1961–1989'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R0518-182, Erich Honecker.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Head of State: [[Erich Honecker]] (1971–89)]]

In 1971, Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] had Ulbricht removed; [[Erich Honecker]] replaced him. While the Ulbricht government had experimented with liberal reform, the Honecker government increased controls upon the populace of the GDR. The new government introduced a new [[East German Constitution]] which defined the German Democratic Republic as a &quot;republic of workers and peasants&quot; and hardly mentioned the word &quot;German&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Krisch, &quot;Soviet-GDR Relations in the Honecker Era,&quot; ''East Central Europe,'' Dec 1979, Vol. 6 Issue 2, pp 152–172&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, East Germany maintained that it was the only lawful government of Germany.  However, from the 1960s onward, East Germany held itself out as a separate country from West Germany, and shared the legacy of the [[German Reich|united German state of 1871–1945]]. West Germany, in contrast, claimed an [[exclusive mandate]] for all of Germany.  From 1949 to the early 1970s, West Germany maintained that East Germany was an illegally constituted state. It argued that the GDR was a Soviet puppet regime and thus illegitimate. This position was shared by most of the world, until 1973. East Germany was recognized only by Communist countries and the Arab bloc, along with some &quot;scattered sympathizers&quot;.&lt;ref name=time&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903634,00.html EAST GERMANY: The Price of Recognition, Time Magazine, 1 January 1973]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Hallstein Doctrine]] (1955), West Germany also did not diplomatically recognize any country – except the USSR – that recognized East German sovereignty.

But in the early 1970s, the ''[[Ostpolitik]]'' (&quot;Eastern Policy&quot;) of &quot;Change Through Rapprochement&quot; of the pragmatic government of FRG Chancellor [[Willy Brandt]], established normal diplomatic relations with the [[East Bloc]] states and the GDR. In the event, the [[Treaty of Moscow (1970)|Treaty of Moscow]] (August 1970), the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1970)|Treaty of Warsaw]] (December 1970), the [[Four Power Agreement on Berlin]] (September 1971), the [[Transit Agreement (1972)|Transit Agreement]] (May 1972), and the [[Basic Treaty (1972)|Basic Treaty]] (December 1972) established normal relations between the Germanies, later allowing their integration to the United Nations. This also increased the number of countries recognizing East Germany to 55, including the US, UK and France, though the last three still refused to recognize East Berlin as the capital, and insisted on a specific provision in the UN resolution accepting the two Germanies into the UN to that affect.&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;/&gt;

===GDR identity===
[[File:Karl Marx memorial.jpg|right|thumb|200px|GDR era [[Karl Marx]] monument in [[Chemnitz]] (renamed ''Karl-Marx-Stadt'' from 1953 to 1990).]]
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
From the beginning, the newly formed GDR tried to establish its own separate identity. Because of Marx's abhorrence of [[Prussia]], the SED repudiated continuity between Prussia and the GDR. The SED destroyed the Junker manor houses, wrecked the Berlin city palace and removed the equestrian statue of [[Frederick the Great]] from East Berlin. Instead the SED focused on the progressive heritage of German history, including [[Thomas Muentzer|Thomas Müntzer]]'s role in the [[German Peasants' War]] and the role played by the heroes of the class struggle during Prussia's industrialization. Nevertheless, as early as 1956 East Germany's Prussian heritage asserted itself in the NVA.

As a result of the Ninth Party Congress in May 1976, East Germany after 1976–77 considered its own history as the essence of German history, in which West Germany was only an episode. It laid claim to reformers such as [[Heinrich Friedrich Karl vom und zum Stein|Karl Freiherr vom Stein]], [[Karl August von Hardenberg]], [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]], and [[Gerhard von Scharnhorst]].

In the early 1980s, West Germany adopted the line of &quot;two German states in one German nation&quot;.  While it respected East Germany's independence, it formally maintained that the GDR was merely a ''de facto'' government within a single German nation of which the FRG was the sole representative. For instance, it did not treat East Germans as foreigners.

=== The ''Wende'' ===
{{Main|Die Wende|German reunification}}

In 1989, following widespread public anger over the faking of results of local government elections that spring, many citizens applied for exit visas or left the country contrary to DDR laws. In August 1989 [[Hungary]] removed its border restrictions and unsealed its border, and more than 13,000 people left East Germany by crossing the &quot;green&quot; border via [[Czechoslovakia]] into Hungary and then on to [[Austria]] and West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.germannotes.com/hist_east_wall.shtml The Berlin Wall (1961–89)] German Notes. Retrieved 24 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Many others [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|demonstrated against the ruling party]], especially in the city of [[Leipzig]]. [[Kurt Masur]], the conductor of the [[Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra]], led local negotiations with the government and held town meetings in the concert hall.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton, Robert, ''Berlin Journal'' (New York, 1992, W.W. Norton) pp.98–99&lt;/ref&gt; The demonstrations eventually led Erich Honecker to resign in October, and he was replaced by a slightly more moderate communist, [[Egon Krenz]].

On 9 November 1989, a few sections of the Berlin Wall were opened, resulting in thousands of East Germans crossing into West Berlin and West Germany for the first time. Krenz resigned a few days later, and the SED abandoned power shortly afterward. Although there were some limited attempts to create a permanent democratic East Germany, these were soon overwhelmed by calls for unification with West Germany.

East Germany held its last elections in March 1990. The winner was a coalition headed by the East German branch of West Germany's [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], which advocated speedy reunification. After some negotiations ([[Treaty on the Final Settlement With Respect to Germany|2+4]] Talks) were held involving the two German states and the former [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]] which led to agreement on the conditions for German unification. The five original [[New states of Germany|East German states]] that had been abolished in 1952 were recreated. On 3 October 1990, the five states officially joined the Federal Republic of Germany, while East and West Berlin united as a third city-state (in the same manner as [[Bremen]] and [[Hamburg]]). On July 1st a currency-union had preceded the political union - the &quot;Ostmark&quot; was abolished, the Western German &quot;Deutsche Mark&quot; became common currency.
The great economic and socio-political inequalities between the former Germanies required government subsidy for the full integration of East Germany to the Federal German Republic. Because of the deindustrialization taking place in he outcome of this economic reunion, the matter is disputed in political conflicts up to the present day. Most times the lack of efficiency of the East German Economy is highlighted and the de-industrialization seen as natural outcome of the &quot;Wende&quot;. But many East German critics point out that the shock-therapy style of privatization did not leave room for east German Enterprises to adapt.&lt;ref&gt;For example the economist Jörg Roesler - see: Jörg Roesler: Ein Anderes Deutschland war möglich. Alternative Programme für das wirtschaftliche Zusammengehen beider deutscher Staaten, in: [[Jahrbuch für Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung]], No. II/2010, pp.34-46. The historian Ulrich Busch pointed out that the currency union as such had come to early- see Ulrich Busch: Die Währungsunion am 1. Juli 1990: Wirtschaftspolitische Fehlleistung mit Folgen, in: [[Jahrbuch für Forschungen zur Geschichte der Arbeiterbewegung]], No. II/2010, pp.5-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were four periods in East German political history.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Conradt, ''The German Polity'' (2008) p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; These included: 1949–61, which saw the building of socialism; 1961–1970 after the Berlin Wall closed off escape was a period of stability and consolidation; 1971–85 was termed the [[Honecker]] Era, and saw closer ties with West Germany; and 1985–89 saw the decline and extinction of East Germany.

=== Organization ===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}The ruling political party in East Germany was the ''Sozialistische Einheitspartei Deutschlands'' ([[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]], SED). It was created in 1946 through the Soviet-directed merger of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) in the Soviet controlled zone.

The Potsdam Agreement committed the Soviets to supporting a democratic form of government in Germany, and as in some other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries, [[Bloc party (politics)|other non-communist political parties]] were allowed. Nevertheless, every political party in the GDR had to register with the [[National Front (East Germany)|National Front of Democratic Germany]], an alliance of parties and mass political organisations, including:

* ''Christlich-Demokratische Union Deutschlands'' ([[Christian Democratic Union (East Germany)|Christian Democratic Union of Germany]], CDU), merged with the West-German [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] after reunification
* ''Demokratische Bauernpartei Deutschlands'' ([[Democratic Farmers' Party of Germany]], DBD). The party merged with the West German [[Christian Democratic Union of Germany|CDU]] after reunification.
* ''Liberal-Demokratische Partei Deutschlands'' ([[Liberal Democratic Party of Germany]], LDPD), merged with the West German [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] after reunification.
* ''Nationaldemokratische Partei Deutschlands'' ([[National Democratic Party of Germany (East Germany)|National Democratic Party of Germany]], NDPD), merged with the West German [[Free Democratic Party of Germany|FDP]] after reunification.

Elections took place at the ''Volkskammer'' but were effectively controlled by the SED/state hierarchy, as [[Hans Modrow]] has noted. Elections were held in less-than-secret conditions, with voters given the choice of approving or rejecting &quot;unity lists&quot; put forward by the National Front and predetermining the distribution of seats given to the different parties and mass organisations. As was the case in most communist countries, approval rates of 90% or more were routine. 

Voting in East Germany was relatively simple. To vote yes, a voter simply took the ballot paper, which contained only one name—that of the approved candidate—and dropped it into the voting box.  A voter could vote against the candidate by crossing out his or her name, but had to do so in a separate voting booth without any secrecy. The consequences for such an act of defiance were severe—loss of one's job or expulsion from school, and close surveillance by the Stasi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sebetsyen|first=Victor|title=Revolution 1989: The Fall of the Soviet Empire|publisher=[[Pantheon Books]]|location=New York City|year=2009|isbn=0-375-42532-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Berlin DDR.jpg|thumb|Poster with inscription &quot;Berlin - Hauptstadt der DDR&quot;, 1967]]

The Volkskammer also included representatives from the ''[[mass movement|mass organisations]]'' like the [[Free German Youth]] (''Freie Deutsche Jugend'' or ''FDJ''), or the [[Free German Trade Union Federation]]. In an attempt to include women in the political life of East Germany, there was a [[Democratic Women's Federation of Germany]], with seats in the Volkskammer.

Important non-parliamentary mass organisations in East German society included the [[German Gymnastics and Sports Association]] (''Deutscher Turn- und Sportbund'' or ''[[DTSB]]''), and [[People's Solidarity]] (''Volkssolidarität'', an organisation for the elderly). Another society of note was the [[Society for German-Soviet Friendship]].

Following German reunification, the SED was renamed the &quot;Party of Democratic Socialism&quot; (PDS) which subsequently merged with the West German [[Labour and Social Justice – The Electoral Alternative|WASG]] to form the [[Left Party (Germany)|Left Party]] (''Die Linke''). The Left Party continues to be a political force in many parts of Germany, albeit drastically less powerful than the SED.

[[File:Nva-ehrenwache.jpg|thumb|thumb|right|upright|The East German Military: A ''[[National People's Army|Nationale Volksarmee]]'' changing-of-the-guard ceremony, East Berlin.]]
Because of East Germany's proximity to the West during the Soviet–American [[Cold War]] (1945–91), its four-branch military, the ''[[National People's Army|Nationale Volksarmee]]'' (National People's Army, NVA) was among the most advanced of the [[Warsaw Pact]]; its branches were:

# Army ''([[Landstreitkräfte]])''
# Navy ''([[Volksmarine]]'' –  People's Navy)
# Air Force–Air Defence ''([[Luftstreitkräfte der NVA|Luftstreitkräfte/Luftverteidigung]])''
# GDR Border Troops ''([[Grenztruppen der DDR]])''

Every man served eighteen months of [[conscription|compulsory military service]]; for the medically unqualified and the [[conscientious objector]], there were the ''[[Conscientious objection in East Germany#Baueinheiten|Baueinheiten]]'' construction units, established in 1964 in response to political pressure by the national Protestant Church upon the GDR’s government. The armed forces of the GDR also possessed paramilitary reserve forces, such as the ''Kampfgruppen der Arbeiterklasse'' ([[Combat Groups of the Working Class]]), and from the [[Stasi]], the Ministry for State Security (Mfs —''Ministerium für Staatssicherheit''), the “''Schild und Schwert der Partei''” (Shield and Sword of the Party).

== Administrative districts ==
[[File:DDR Verwaltungsbezirke farbig.svg|thumb|300px|Administrative map: The districts of German Democratic Republic in 1952.]]
{{Main|Administrative divisions of East Germany}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
Until 1952, the GDR comprised the East Berlin capital city and the five [[States of Germany|German states]] of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] (in 1947 renamed: Mecklenburg), [[Brandenburg]], Saxony-Anhalt, [[Thuringia]], Saxony, their post-war territorial demarcations approximating the pre-war German demarcations of the [[Middle Germany|Middle German]] ''Länder'' (states) and ''Provinzen'' ([[provinces of Prussia]]). Moreover, the western parts of two provinces, [[Pomerania Province (1815-1945)|Pomerania]] and [[Lower Silesia]], although prevailingly annexed by Poland, remained politically integral to the GDR.

The [[East German Administrative Reform of 1952]] disestablished the five states and established 14 ''Bezirke'' (districts), named per their capital cities: (i) [[Rostock]], (ii) [[Neubrandenburg]], (iii) [[Schwerin]], (iv) [[Potsdam]], (v) [[Frankfurt (Oder)]], (vi) [[Magdeburg]], (vii) [[Cottbus]], (viii) [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], (ix) [[Leipzig]], (x) [[Erfurt]], (xi) [[Dresden]], (xii) [[Karl-Marx-Stadt]] (Chemnitz until 1953 and again in 1990), (xiii) [[Gera]], and (xiv) [[Suhl]]; [[East Berlin]] was denominated a ''Bezirk'' (district) in 1961.

The disestablished ''Länder'' (states), demarcated as ''Bezirke'' (districts), were renamed so: the northern ''Land'' (state) [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern|Mecklenburg]] was divided among the ''Bezirke'' [[Rostock]], [[Schwerin]], and [[Neubrandenburg]]; [[Brandenburg]] (containing Berlin) was divided into the [[Potsdam]], [[Frankfurt (Oder)]], and [[Cottbus]] districts; [[Saxony-Anhalt]] was divided into the [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]] and [[Magdeburg]] districts; the south-western state of [[Thuringia]] was divided into the [[Erfurt]], [[Gera]], and [[Suhl]] districts; and the south-eastern state of [[Saxony]] was divided among the [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]], and [[Chemnitz|Karl-Marx-Stadt]] districts.

East Berlin, the capital city of the German Democratic Republic, formed the ''Bezirk'' Berlin, the country’s fifteenth district, retaining special legal status until 1968, when the residents voted in approving the new (draft) constitution. Regardless of the city's four-occupying-power-status, the ACC, and diplomatic objections of the Allied governments, the GDR administered the ''Bezirk'' Berlin as sovereign territory.

== Population ==
The East German population declined by three million people throughout its forty-one year history, from 19 million in 1948 to 16 million in 1990; of the 1948 population, some 4 million [[Expulsion of Germans|were deported]] from the lands east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.populstat.info/Europe/germanec.htm |title=East Germany: country population |publisher=Populstat.info |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This compares starkly with Poland, which increased during that time from 24 million in 1950 (a little more than East Germany) to 38 million (more than twice East Germany's population). This was primarily a result of emigration – about one quarter of East Germans left the country before the Berlin Wall was completed in 1961,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;In the period between the Second World War and 1961, a total of 3.8 million people emigrated from East to West Germany.&quot; Laar, M. (2009). &quot;The Power of Freedom. Central and Eastern Europe after 1945.&quot; Centre for European Studies, p. 58. http://www.poweroffreedombook.com/preview_PoF.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and after that time, East Germany had very low birth rates,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.country-studies.com/germany/population---historical-background.html |title=Germany Population – Historical Background |publisher=Country-studies.com |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; except for a recovery in the 1980s when the birth rate in East Germany was considerably higher than in West Germany,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.destatis.de/jetspeed/portal/cms/Sites/destatis/Internet/DE/Content/Publikationen/Fachveroeffentlichungen/Bevoelkerung/BroschuereGeburtenDeutschland,property=file.pdf Destatis.de] page 17&lt;/ref&gt; and in general the birth rate per woman was never much lower than in West Germany, except during the 1990s.

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of the German Democratic Republic}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-P0619-306, Trabant 601.jpg|thumb|upright|Communist economic staple: The [[Trabant]] automobile was a profitable product made in the German Democratic Republic (GDR).]]

The East German economy began poorly because of the devastation caused by the war, the loss of so many young soldiers, the disruption of business and transportation, the presence of so many refugees, and finally reparations owed to the USSR. The [[Red Army]] dismantled and transported to Russia the infrastructure and industrial plants of the Soviet Zone of Occupation. By the early 1950s, the reparations were paid in agricultural and industrial products; and [[Lower Silesia]], with its coal mines and [[Szczecin]], an important natural port, were given to Poland by the decision of Stalin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norman M. Naimark 1949, pp. 167-9&quot;/&gt;

The socialist [[central planning|centrally planned economy]] of the German Democratic Republic was like that of the USSR. In 1950, the GDR joined the [[COMECON]] trade bloc. In 1985, [[collective]] (state) enterprises earned 96.7% of the net national income. To ensure stable prices for goods and services, the state paid 80% of basic supply costs. The estimated 1984 per capita income was $9,800 ($21,000 in 2008 dollars). In 1976, the average annual growth of the GDP was approximately five percent. This made [[East German]] economy the richest in all of the [[Soviet Bloc]] until 1990 after the Communist collapse in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Econ stats&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1052/is_n4_v110/ai_7373809|title=Business America.

Notable East German exports were [[camera|photographic cameras]], under the [[Praktica]] brand; automobiles under the [[Trabant]], [[Wartburg (car)|Wartburg]], and the [[Industrieverband Fahrzeugbau|IFA]] brands; hunting rifles, [[sextant]]s,  and [[watch|wristwatches]].

Until the 1960s, East Germans endured shortages of basic foodstuffs such as sugar and coffee. East Germans with friends or relatives in the West (or any access to a [[hard currency]]) and the necessary [[Staatsbank]] [[foreign currency account]], could afford Western products and export-quality East German products via [[Intershop]]. Consumer goods also were available, by post, from the Danish [[Jauerfood]], and Genex companies.

The government used money and prices as political devices, providing highly subsidised prices for a wide range of basic goods and services, in what was known as &quot;the second pay packet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Boroch, Wilfried (1996), &quot;Social policy as an institutional transformation problem&quot;, ''Transition Economies'', Volume 31, Number 3, pp139-146&lt;/ref&gt;  The economic results were highly negative, and created an increasing differential with the prosperity in West Germany. At the production level, artificial prices made for an inefficient, backward system of semi-barter and resource-hoarding. For the consumer, it led to the substitution of GDR money with time, barter, and hard-currencies. Ironically, the socialist economy became steadily more dependent on financial infusions from hard-currency loans from West Germany. East Germans, meanwhile, came to see their soft-currency as worthless relative to the Deutsche Mark (DM).&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan R. Zatlin, ''The Currency of Socialism: Money and Political Culture in East Germany'' (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Consumption and jobs ===
In East Germany, people who were disgruntled resorted to nasty jokes at the expense of the oppressive regime; their names were recorded, and too many jokes would land a man in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan R. Zatlin, ''The Currency of Socialism: Money and Political Culture in East Germany.'' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its history the main criterion for getting a good job was unblinking loyalty to the Communist party bosses. Even in the electronics industry, a relatively modern and competitive sector of the GDR's economy, the criteria of professionalism were secondary to political criteria in personnel recruitment and development. Dubious loyalty meant exclusion from the university and from good jobs.{{or|date=February 2012}}

With a very low birth rate and a high rate of exodus, East Germany was losing workers. The solution was to import low-skilled workers from other Communist countries. Beginning in 1963 with a series of secret international agreements, East Germany recruited workers from Poland, Hungary, Cuba, Albania, Mozambique, Angola and (North) Vietnam. They numbered more than 100,000 by 1989. Their working conditions were bleak, and although they were officially equal to their German counterparts, the foreign workers remained at the bottom of the social ladder with almost no rights.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond G. Stokes, ''Constructing Socialism: Technology and Change in East Germany, 1945–1990'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religion ==
Religion was contested ground in the GDR, with the Communists promoting [[state atheism]], although some people were loyal to Christian communities.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Fulbrook, &quot;The Limits Of Totalitarianism: God, State and Society in the GDR,&quot; ''Transactions of the Royal Historical Society,'' Jan 1957, Vol. 7 Issue 1, pp 25–52&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atheism ===
At the beginning, the Communist party had asserted the compatibility of Christianity and Marxism and sought Christian participation in the building of socialism. At first the question of atheism received little official attention. In the mid-1950s, as the Cold War heated up, atheism became suddenly a topic of major interest for the regime for propaganda purposes, both domestic and foreign. University chairs and departments devoted to the study of 'scientific atheism' were founded and much literature (scholarly and popular) on the subject was produced. Then this activity rather quickly subsided in the late 1960s amid perceptions that atheistic propaganda was becoming counterproductive; but official and scholarly attention to atheism was renewed beginning in 1973, though this time there was more emphasis on scholarship and the training of cadre than propaganda. Throughout, attention paid to atheism in East Germany always reflected politics and was never intended to jeopardise the cooperation that was desired from those East Germans who were religious.&lt;ref&gt;Fulbrook, &quot;The Limits Of Totalitarianism: God, State and Society in the GDR&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Protestants ===
East Germany historically was about 90% Protestant. Between 1956 and 1971 the leadership of the East German Lutheran Church changed its relations with the state from hostility to cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Onnasch, &quot;Konflikt Und Kompromiss: Die Haltung Der Evangelischen Kirchen Zu Den Gesellschaftlichen Veränderungen In Der Ddr Am Anfang Der Fünfziger Jahre,&quot; [&quot;Conflict and compromise: the position of the Protestant churches with regard to social changes in the GDR at the beginning of the 1950s&quot;], ''Kirchliche Zeitgeschichte / Halbjahresschrift fuer Theologie und Geschichtswisseschaft,'' 1990, Vol. 3 Issue 1, pp 152–165&lt;/ref&gt; From the founding of the GDR in 1949, the Communist Party tried to weaken the influence of the church on the rising generation. The church therefore adopted an attitude of confrontation and distance regarding the Communist authorities. Around 1956 this firm stand against the regime began to wither in favour of a more neutral stance and conditional loyalty. The regime was no longer regarded as illegitimate; instead, the church leaders started viewing the authorities as installed by God and, therefore, deserving of obedience by Christians. But on matters where the state demanded something which was not in accordance with the will of God, the church reserved its right to say no. There were both structural and intentional causes behind this development. Structural causes included the hardening of Cold War tensions in Europe in the mid-1950s, which took away the temporary character of the East German state. The loss of church members and discrimination against young Christians also made it clear to the leaders of the church that they had to come into some kind of dialogue with the authorities. The intentions behind the change of attitude varied from a traditional Lutheran acceptance of secular power to a positive attitude toward socialist ideas. There was also a will to cooperate in order to have the ability to criticise from within a position of loyalty.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen R. Bowers 1982, pp 73-86&quot;&gt;Stephen R. Bowers, &quot;Private Institutions in Service to the State: The German Democratic Republic'S Church in Socialism,&quot; ''East European Quarterly,'' Spring 1982, Vol. 16 Issue 1, pp 73–86&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Manfred Stolpe]] (b. 1936) became a lawyer for the Protestant church in 1959 before taking up a position at church headquarters in Berlin. In 1969 he helped found the Bund der Evangelischen Kirchen in der DDR, where he negotiated with the Communist government while at the same time working within the truly democratic system of the church's institutions. The international outlook he gained through the church's ecumenical activities helped him in his new job after winning the regional elections for the state of Brandenburg at the head of the SPD list in 1990. Despite accusations of having colluded with the Communist government, Stolpe, cleared of the charges, remained at the head of the Brandenburg government until he joined the federal government in 2002.

=== Catholics ===
The smaller Roman Catholic Church had a fully functioning episcopal hierarchy that was in full accord with the Vatican. During the early postwar years, tensions were high. The Catholic Church as a whole and particularly the bishops were resistant to both the regime and Marxist ideology, and the state allowed the bishops to lodge protests, which they did on issues such as abortion. The bishops were, however, closely observed by the Stasi.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stephen R. Bowers 1982, pp 73-86&quot;/&gt;

After 1945, the Church did fairly well in integrating Catholic exiles from lands to the east (which were given to Poland) and adjusting its institutional structures against the threats of an atheistic state. Within the Church, this meant an increasingly hierarchical structure, whereas in the area of religious education, press, and youth organisations, a system of temporary staff was developed, one that took into account the special situation of the Caritas, a charity organisation. They were hardly affected by Communist attempts to force them into line. By 1950, therefore, there existed a Catholic subsociety that was well adjusted to prevailing specific conditions and capable of maintaining Catholic identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bernd Schaefer|title=The East German State and the Catholic Church, 1945-1989|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=96QzpCRH2agC|year=2010|publisher=Berghahn Books}} ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;

With a generational change in the episcopacy taking place in the early 1980s, the state hoped for better relations with the new bishops, but the new bishops instead showed increasing independence from the state by holding unauthorised mass meetings, promoting international ties in discussions with theologians abroad, and hosting ecumenical conferences. The new bishops became less politically oriented and more involved in pastoral care and attention to spiritual concerns.  The government responded by limiting international contacts for bishops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Adrian Webb|title=Routledge Companion to Central and Eastern Europe since 1919|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=omjBEYM3IK4C&amp;pg=PA185|date= 2008|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of East Germany}}
East Germany's culture was strongly influenced by communism and particularly Stalinism and was described by East German psychoanalyst Hans-Joachim Maaz in 1990 as having produced a &quot;Congested Feeling&quot; among East Germans as a result of the East German state's goal to protect people from dangers of deviant cultural influence and dangers of popular expression deviating from the state's ideals through enforcing official ideals through physical and psychological repression of these tendencies via its institutions, particularly the [[Stasi]].  Critics of the East German state have claimed that the state's commitment to communism was a hollow and cynical tool [[Machiavellianism|Machiavellian]] in nature, but this assertion has been challenged by studies that have found that the East German leadership was genuinely committed to the advance of scientific knowledge, economic development, and social progress.  However, Pence and Betts argue, the majority of East Germans over time increasingly regarded the state's ideals to be hollow, though there was also a substantial number of East Germans who regarded their culture as having a healthier, more authentic mentality than that of West Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Pence and Betts, ''Socialist modern: East German everyday culture and politics''. pp 37 for Maaz, 58.&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Music ===
The [[Puhdys]] and [[Karat (band)|Karat]] were some of the most popular mainstream bands, managing to hint at critical thoughts in their lyrics without being explicit. Like most mainstream acts, they appeared in popular youth magazines such as ''Neues Leben'' and ''Magazin''. Other popular rock bands were [[Wir (band)|Wir]], [[Dean Reed]], [[City (band)|City]], [[Silly (band)|Silly]] and [[Pankow (German band)|Pankow]]. Most of these artists recorded on the state-owned [[AMIGA (label)|AMIGA]] label.

Influences from the West were heard because West German TV and radio could be received in many parts of the East (an exception being [[Dresden]] with its geographical position in the [[Elbe]] valley, although limited reception of Western radio was still possible there). The Western influence led to the formation of more &quot;underground&quot; groups with a decisively western-oriented sound. A few of these bands were [[Die Skeptiker]], [[Die Art]] and [[Feeling B]]. Additionally, [[hip hop]] culture reached the ears of the East German youth. With videos such as ''[[Beat Street]]'' and ''[[Wild Style]]'', young East Germans were able to develop a hip hop culture of their own.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Timothy S. “‘Keeping it Real’ in a Different ‘Hood: (African-) Americanization and Hip-hop in Germany.” In The Vinyl Ain’t Final: Hip Hop and the Globalization of Black Popular Culture, ed. by Dipannita Basu and Sidney J. Lemelle, pp.137–150. London; A&lt;/ref&gt; East Germans accepted hip hop as more than just a music form. The entire street culture surrounding rap entered the region and became an outlet for oppressed youth.&lt;ref&gt;Elfein, Dietmar. From Krauts with Atittudes to Turks with Attitudes: Some Aspects of Hip-Hop History in Germany, pp.225–265 Popular Music vol. 17:3. October 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dissident singer/songwriter [[Wolf Biermann]], although professing to be a dedicated Communist, was not permitted to perform in public, and was deprived of his East German citizenship in 1976, while visiting West Germany. He was not allowed to return to East Germany until 1989.

Singer [[Nina Hagen]], who is the stepdaughter of Biermann, was exiled at the same time.

Governmental support of classical music maintained some fifty symphony orchestras, such as [[Gewandhausorchester]] and [[Thomanerchor]] in Leipzig; [[Sächsische Staatskapelle Dresden|Sächsische Staatskapelle]] in Dresden; and [[Berliner Sinfonie Orchester]] and [[Staatsoper Unter den Linden]] in Berlin.

The birthplace of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]] (1685–1750), [[Eisenach]], was rendered as a museum about him, featuring more than three hundred instruments, which, in 1980, received some 70,000 visitors. In Leipzig, the Bach archive contains his compositions and correspondence and recordings of his music.

=== Theatre ===
[[File:Bertolt-Brecht.jpg|thumb|upright|Playwright [[Bertolt Brecht]] (1898–1956)]]

East German theatre was originally dominated by [[Bertolt Brecht]], who brought back many artists out of exile and reopened the ''[[Theater am Schiffbauerdamm]]'' with his [[Berliner Ensemble]]. Alternatively, other influences tried to establish a &quot;Working Class Theatre&quot;, played for the working class by the working class.

After Brecht's death, conflicts began to arise between his family (around [[Helene Weigel]]) and other artists about Brecht's heritage. [[Heinz Kahlau]], [[Slatan Dudow]], [[Erwin Geschonneck]], [[Erwin Strittmatter]], [[Peter Hacks]], [[Benno Besson]], [[Peter Palitzsch]] and [[Ekkehard Schall]] were considered to be among Bertolt Brecht's scholars and followers.

In the 1950s the Swiss director [[Benno Besson]] with the [[Deutsches Theater]] successfully toured Europe and Asia including Japan with ''The Dragon'' by [[Jewgenij Schwarz]]. In the 1960s, he became the Intendant of the [[Volksbühne]] often working with [[Heiner Müller]].

After 1975 many artists left the GDR because of increasing censorship. A parallel theatre scene sprung up, creating theatre &quot;outside of Berlin&quot; in which artists played at provincial theatres. For example [[Peter Sodann]] founded the [[Neues Theater]] in [[Halle/Saale]] and [[Frank Castorf]] at the theater [[Anklam]].

Theatre and [[cabaret]] had high status in the GDR, which allowed it to be very pro-active. This often brought it into confrontation with the state. Benno Besson once said, &quot;In contrast to artists in the west, they took us seriously, we had a bearing.&quot;

[[File:VolksbühBerlJan08.JPG|thumb|[[Volksbühne]]]]

Important theatres include: [[Berliner Ensemble]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.berliner-ensemble.de |title=Das BE – ein Theater für Zeitgenossen |publisher=Berliner-ensemble.de |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; – [[Deutsches Theater]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deutsches-theater.de |title=Deutsches Theater: Home |publisher=Deutsches-theater.de |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maxim-Gorki-Theater]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gorki.de |title=Gorki.de |publisher=Gorki.de |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Volksbühne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.volksbuehne-berlin.de |title=Volksbühne Berlin |publisher=Volksbuehne-berlin.de |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cinema ===
The prolific cinema of East Germany was headed by the [[DEFA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.defa-stiftung.de |title=DEFA – Stiftung – Home |publisher=Defa-stiftung.de |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Deutsche Film AG'', which was subdivided in different local groups, for example ''Gruppe Berlin'', ''Gruppe [[Babelsberg]]'' or ''Gruppe [[Johannisthal (Berlin)|Johannisthal]]'', where the local teams shot and produced films. Besides folksy movies, the movie-industry became known worldwide for its productions, especially children's movies (''[[Das kalte Herz]]'', film versions of the [[Brothers Grimm]] fairy tales and modern productions such as ''[[Das Schulgespenst]]'').

[[Frank Beyer]]'s ''[[Jacob the Liar (1975 film)|Jakob der Lügner]]'' (Jacob the Liar), about the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]], and ''[[Fünf Patronenhülsen]]'' (Five Cartridges), about resistance against fascism, became internationally famous.

Films about daily life, such as ''[[The Legend of Paul and Paula|Die Legende von Paul und Paula]]'', by [[Heiner Carow]], and ''[[Solo Sunny]]'', directed by [[Konrad Wolf]] and [[Wolfgang Kohlhaase]], were very popular.

The film industry was remarkable for its production of ''[[Ostern]]'', or Western-like movies. [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] in these films often took the role of displaced people who fight for their rights, in contrast to the [[Western (genre)|American westerns]] of the time, where Indians were often either not mentioned at all or are portrayed as the villains. [[Yugoslavia]]ns were often cast as the Indians because of the small number of American Indians in eastern Europe. [[Gojko Mitić]] was well known in these roles, often playing the righteous, kindhearted and charming [[Tribal chief|chief]] (''[[The Sons of Great Bear|Die Söhne der großen Bärin]]'' directed by [[Josef Mach]]). He became an honorary [[Sioux]] chief when he visited the United States in the 1990s, and the television crew accompanying him showed the tribe one of his movies. American actor and singer [[Dean Reed]], an expatriate who lived in East Germany, also starred in several films. These films were part of the phenomenon of Europe producing alternative films about the colonization of America.

Because of censorship a certain number of very remarkable movies were forbidden at this time and reissued after the ''[[Die Wende|Wende]]'' in 1990. Examples are ''[[Traces of Stones|Spur der Steine]]'' (directed by [[Frank Beyer]]) and ''[[Der geteilte Himmel]]'' (directed by [[Konrad Wolf]]).

Cinemas in the GDR also showed foreign films. Czechoslovak and Polish productions were more common, but certain western movies were shown, though the numbers of these were limited because it cost foreign exchange to buy the licences. Further, movies representing or glorifying capitalistic ideology were not bought. Comedies enjoyed great popularity, such as the Danish ''[[Olsen Gang]]'' or movies with the French comedian [[Louis de Funès]].

Since the fall of the Berlin Wall, several movies depicting life in the GDR have been critically acclaimed.  Some of the most notable were ''[[Good Bye Lenin!]]'' by [[Wolfgang Becker]], ''[[The Lives of Others|Das Leben der Anderen]]'' (The Lives of Others) by [[Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck]]  (won the [[Academy Award]] for best Film in a Foreign Language) in 2006,&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405094/awards 2006 Academy Award for &quot;The Lives of Others&quot;],&lt;/ref&gt;   ''[[Alles auf Zucker!]]'' (Go for Zucker) by Dani Levi.  Each film is heavily infused with cultural nuances unique to life in the GDR.

=== Sport ===
{{refimprove section|date=February 2012}}
East Germany was very successful in the sports of [[bicycling]], [[weight-lifting]], swimming, gymnastics, track and field, [[boxing]], [[ice skating]], and winter sports. The success is attributed to the leadership of Dr. [[Manfred Hoeppner]] which started in the late 1960s.

Another supporting reason was [[doping in East Germany]], especially with anabolic steroids, the most detected doping substances in [[IOC]]-accredited laboratories for many years.&lt;ref&gt;Hartgens and Kuipers (2004), p. 515&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Anabolic steroids in sport: biochemical, clinical and analytical perspectives |journal=Annals of Clinical Biochemistry |volume=40 |issue=Pt 4 |pages=321–56 |year=2003 |month=July |pmid=12880534 |doi=10.1258/000456303766476977 |url=http://acb.rsmjournals.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12880534 |author1=Kicman AT |author2=Gower DB |author-separator=, |author-name-separator=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The development and implementation of a state-supported sports doping program helped East Germany, with its small population, to become a world leader in sport during the 1970s and 1980s, winning a large number of Olympic and world gold medals and records.&lt;ref&gt;Tagliabue, John. – [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE7D81039F931A25751C0A967958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2 &quot;Political Pressure Dismantles East German Sports Machine&quot;] – ''[[New York Times]]'' – 12 February 1991 | Janofsky, Michael. – [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9D0CE1DA1731F930A35751C1A967958260 &quot;OLYMPICS; Coaches Concede That Steroids Fueled East Germany's Success in Swimming&quot;] – ''[[New York Times]]'' – 3 December 1991 | Kirschbaum, Erik. – [http://www.rediff.com/sports/2000/sep/15germ.htm &quot;East German dope still leaves tracks&quot;] – Rediff from [[Reuters]] – 15 September 2000 | Ungerleider, Steven (2001).

Another factor for success was the furtherance-system for young people in GDR. Sport-teachers at school were encouraged to look for certain talents in children ages 6 to 10 years old. For older pupils it was possible to attend grammar-schools with a focus on sports (for example sailing, football and swimming). This policy was also used for talented pupils with regard to music or mathematics.

[[File:Karin Janz.png|right|thumb|200px|[[Karin Janz]]]]
Sports clubs were highly subsidized, especially sports in which it was possible to get international fame. For example, the major leagues for ice hockey and basketball just included each 2 teams. [[Association football|Football (soccer)]] was the most popular sport. Club football teams such as [[Dynamo Dresden]], [[1. FC Magdeburg]], [[FC Carl Zeiss Jena]], [[1. FC Lokomotive Leipzig]] and [[BFC Dynamo]] had successes in European competition. Many East German players such as [[Matthias Sammer]] and [[Ulf Kirsten]] became integral parts of the reunified national football team. Other sports enjoyed great popularity like figure skating, especially because of sportspeople like [[Katarina Witt]].

;Track-suit diplomacy
The East and the West also competed via sport; GDR athletes dominated several Olympic sports. Of special interest was the only football match between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic, a first-round match during the [[1974 FIFA World Cup]], which the East won 1–0; but West Germany, the host, went on to win the World Cup.

=== Television and radio ===
Television and radio in East Germany were state controlled; the ''[[Rundfunk der DDR]]'' was the official radio broadcasting organisation from 1952 until German reunification. The organization was based in the ''Funkhaus Nalepastraße'' in East Berlin. ''[[Deutscher Fernsehfunk]]'' (DFF), from 1972–1990 known as ''Fernsehen der DDR'' or DDR-FS, was the state television broadcaster from 1952. Reception of Western radio (and even television) broadcasts was widespread.&lt;ref name=Cooke&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=H7ajL_aNu6oC&amp;pg=PA146 ''Representing East Germany since unification: from colonization to nostalgia''], By Paul Cooke, Berg Publishers, 1 August 2005, ISBN 978-1-84520-189-0, page 146. Retrieved from [[Google Books]] 25 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Telecommunications ==
{{Further2|[[Communications in Germany]]}}
{{unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}
By the mid-1980s, East Germany possessed a well-developed communications system. There were approximately 3.6 million telephones in usage (21.8 for every 100 inhabitants), and 16,476 [[telegraphy#Telex|Telex]] stations. Both of these networks were run by the [[Deutsche Post der DDR]] (East German Post Office). East Germany was assigned telephone country code 37; in 1991, several months after reunification, East German telephone exchanges were incorporated into country code 49.

An unusual feature of the telephone network was that in most cases, [[direct dialing]] for [[long distance call]]s was not possible. Although [[area codes]] were assigned to all major towns and cities, they were only used for switching international calls. Instead, each location had its own list of dialing codes with shorter codes for [[local call]]s and longer codes for long distance calls. After reunification, the existing network was largely replaced, and area codes and dialing became standardised.

In 1976 East Germany inaugurated the operation of a ground-based radio station at [[Fürstenwalde]] for the purpose of relaying and receiving communications from Soviet satellites and to serve as a participant in the international telecommunications organization established by the Soviet government, [[Intersputnik]].

But for many East Germans, this joy quickly turned to dismay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Leonie Naughton|title=That Was the Wild East: Film Culture, Unification, and the &quot;New&quot; Germany|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AugFhjJZz0QC&amp;pg=PA14|year=2002|publisher=U. of Michigan Press|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  West Germans often acted as if they had &quot;won&quot; and East Germans had &quot;lost&quot; in unification, leading many East Germans (''Ossis'') to resent West Germans (''Wessis'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Bickford|title=Fallen Elites: The Military Other in Post-Unification Germany|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sELghp1BIbgC&amp;pg=PA10|year=2011|publisher=Stanford U.P.|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barnstone finds that, &quot;East Germans resent the wealth possessed by West Germans; West Germans see the East Germans as lazy opportunists who want something for nothing. East Germans find “Wessis” arrogant and pushy, West Germans think the “Ossis” are lazy good-for-nothings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ascher Barnston|title=The Transparent State: Architecture and Politics in Postwar Germany|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dkO_WwhyXWMC&amp;pg=PA92|date= 2005|publisher=Psychology Press|page=92}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the dislocations, especially the closure of obsolete factories in the east, the end of Communism, the disappearance of East Germany and German unification were hardest for East Germany, where unemployment skyrocketed and many East German professionals quickly fled for better jobs in West Germany.

These and other effects of unification led many East Germans to begin to think of themselves more strongly as &quot;East&quot; Germans rather than as simply as &quot;Germans&quot;. In many former GDR citizens this produced a longing for certain aspects of the former East Germany, such as full employment and other perceived benefits of the GDR state, termed &quot;[[Ostalgie]]&quot; (a [[blend]] of {{lang|de|''Ost''}} &quot;east&quot; and {{lang|de|''Nostalgie''}} &quot;nostalgia&quot;) and depicted in the [[Wolfgang Becker]] film ''[[Goodbye Lenin!]]''.

Danish historian Feiwel Kupferberg (2002) argues that the real difficulty in German reunification was the sharply different ways the West Germans and East Germans interpreted their Nazi past. The West Germans confronted the past and atoned for it, and meanwhile transformed the FRG into a prosperous, free democracy that expressed the values of both individual freedom and responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;Feiwel Kupferberg, ''The Rise and Fall of the German Democratic Republic'' (2002), p 46&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the East Germans took hold of Moscow's official interpretation that East Germany was the &quot;victor of history&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kupferberg, ''The Rise and Fall of the German Democratic Republic'' (2002), p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; and represented the successful opposition to the Nazis. This myth, Kupferberg argues, allowed the GDR to attack the West Germans as historically complicit in the Nazi crimes because it had the same capitalist economy which had produced Hitler in the first place. East Germany was now pure, because it had rejected fascism and its twin, capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Kupferberg, ''The Rise and Fall of the German Democratic Republic'' (2002), pp 54–55, 62, 66, 94–5, 192–32&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude, Kupferberg argues, allowed middle classes that had supported Hitler to often retain powerful roles in East Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Kupferberg, ''The Rise and Fall of the German Democratic Republic'' (2002), p. 166&lt;/ref&gt; Granville concludes that Kupferberg, &quot;articulates well the thesis that the rigid communist system in the GDR inculcated passivity, helplessness, and amoral pragmatism in its citizens.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;see [Johanna Granville, &quot;H-NET BOOK REVIEW&quot; Published by H-German@h-net.msu.edu (April 2003)]&lt;/ref&gt;
