The '''1992 Los Angeles riots''' were a series of [[race riot]]s that occurred over six days in the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] in [[California]] in April 1992. 

The riots started on April 29, 1992, after a jury trial resulted in the [[acquittal]] of four [[Los Angeles Police Department]] officers accused in the videotaped beating of motorist [[Rodney King]] following a high-speed police pursuit. Thousands of people throughout the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] rioted over the six days following the announcement of the verdict.&lt;ref name='emergency.com'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.emergency.com/la-riots.htm | title = Three days of  @#!*%  in Los Angeles | accessdate =February 9, 2011 | last = Staten | first = Clark | date = April 29, 1992 | publisher = Emergencynet News Service (ENN) | archiveurl = http://web.archive.bibalex.org/web/20070903160703/http://www.emergency.com/la-riots.htm | archivedate = September 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Widespread [[looting]], [[assault]], [[arson]] and [[murder]] occurred during the riots, and estimates of property damages topped one billion dollars. The rioting ended after soldiers from the [[California Army National Guard]], along with U.S. Marines from [[Camp Pendleton]] were called in to stop the rioting. In total, 53 people were killed during the riots and over two thousand people were injured.&lt;ref name=LAWeekly&gt;[http://www.laweekly.com/2002-05-02/news/the-l-a-53/ &quot;The L.A. 53&quot;].

==Name==
The riots are also known as the Rodney King Riots, the South Central Riots, the 1992 Los Angeles Civil Disturbance, and the 1992 Los Angeles Civil Unrest. Among South Korean immigrants living in the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]], the 1992 Los Angeles Riots are referred to as ''Sah-E-Goo'', meaning literally &quot;four-two-nine&quot; in the [[Korean language]], in reference to the date of which the rioting started, April 29, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/B6W64-45YCT72-5/2/ee3e87b74cbbdfe99e408f80607fa9ee|title=The Social Science Journal : Effects of the 1992 Los Angeles civil unrest: Post traumatic stress disorder symptomatology among law enforcement officers |publisher= |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gateway.nlm.nih.gov/MeetingAbstracts/ma?f=102278441.html |title=Gonorrhea and the 1992 Civil Unrest in Los Angeles |publisher=Gateway.nlm.nih.gov |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usc.edu/libraries/archives/cityinstress/analysis/main.html |title=Analysis of the 1992 Los Angeles Civil Unrest |publisher=Usc.edu |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:South Central Los Angeles 1.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[South Central Los Angeles]], where much of the rioting took place.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;The [[National Geographic Channel]] (U.S. version) program &quot;The Final Report: The L.A. Riots&quot; aired originally on October 4, 2006 10&amp;nbsp;pm [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]], approximately 38 minutes into the hour (including commercial breaks).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
On March 3, 1991, [[Rodney King]] and two passengers were driving west on the [[Foothill Freeway]] (I-210) through the [[Lake View Terrace]] neighborhood of Los Angeles. The [[California Highway Patrol]] (CHP) attempted to initiate a traffic stop. A high-speed pursuit ensued with speeds estimated at up to 115&amp;nbsp;mph first over freeways and then through residential neighborhoods. When King came to a stop, CHP Officer Timothy Singer and his wife, CHP Officer Melanie Singer, ordered the occupants under arrest.&lt;ref name=&quot;query.nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/20/us/sergeant-says-king-appeared-to-be-on-drugs.html |title= Sergeant Says King Appeared to Be on Drugs|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 20, 1992| accessdate= March 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After two passengers were placed in the patrol car, five white Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) officers ([[Stacey Koon]], [[Laurence Powell]], Timothy Wind, Theodore Briseno, and Rolando Solano) attempted to subdue King, who came out of the car last. In a departure from the usual procedure, which is to tackle and cuff a suspect, King was [[Electroshock gun|tasered]], kicked in the head, beaten with [[PR-24]] batons for over one minute, then tackled and cuffed. The officers claimed that King was under the influence of [[Phencyclidine|PCP]] at the time of arrest, which caused him to be very aggressive and violent towards the officers. The video showed that he was crawling on the ground during the beating and that the police made no attempt to cuff him.&lt;ref name=&quot;query.nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;

A subsequent test for the presence of PCP turned up negative. The incident was captured on a camcorder by resident [[George Holliday (Rodney King witness)|George Holliday]] from his apartment in the vicinity. The tape was roughly ten minutes long. While the case was presented to the court, clips of the incident were not released to the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mqh.blogia.com/2006/030901-la-otra-paliza-con-rodney-king.php]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a later interview, King, who was on parole from prison on a robbery conviction and who had past convictions for assault, battery and robbery,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Doug Linder |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/lapd/kingarrests.html |title=The Arrest Record of Rodney King |publisher=Law.umkc.edu |accessdate=August 11, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100911204525/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/lapd/kingarrests.html| archivedate= September 11, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=C0tWztU6f0sC&amp;pg=RA1-PA41&amp;lpg=RA1-PA41&amp;dq=%22rodney+king%22+wife Official Negligence: How Rodney King and the Riots Changed Los Angeles and the LAPD] pages 41–42&lt;/ref&gt; said that he had not surrendered earlier because he knew that an arrest for DUI would violate the terms of his parole.

The footage of King being beaten by police while lying on the ground became a focus for media attention and a rallying point for activists in Los Angeles and around the United States. Coverage was extensive during the initial two weeks after the incident: the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published forty-three articles about the incident,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/results.html?st=advanced&amp;QryTxt=%22rodney+king%22&amp;type=current&amp;sortby=RELEVANCE&amp;datetype=6&amp;frommonth=03&amp;fromday=03&amp;fromyear=1991&amp;tomonth=03&amp;today=17&amp;toyear=1991&amp;By=&amp;Title=&amp;at=ALL&amp;Sect=ALL |title=Los Angeles Times: Archives |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' published seventeen articles,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/search/query?query=rodney+king&amp;srchst=nyt&amp;d=&amp;o=&amp;v=&amp;c=&amp;sort=closest&amp;n=10&amp;dp=0&amp;daterange=period&amp;year1=1991&amp;mon1=03&amp;day1=03&amp;year2=1991&amp;mon2=03&amp;day2=17&amp;frow=10 |title=The New York Times: Search for 'rodney king' |work=The New York Times |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}{{verify source|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' published eleven articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/results.html?st=advanced&amp;QryTxt=%22rodney+king%22&amp;type=current&amp;sortby=RELEVANCE&amp;datetype=6&amp;frommonth=03&amp;fromday=03&amp;fromyear=1991&amp;tomonth=03&amp;today=17&amp;toyear=1991&amp;By=&amp;Title=&amp;Sect=ALL |title=Archives: Chicago Tribune |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Eight stories appeared on [[ABC News]], including a sixty-minute special on ''[[Primetime Live]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Charges and trial===
The [[Los Angeles District Attorney]] subsequently charged four police officers, including one sergeant, with assault and use of excessive force.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_19920306&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/06/us/police-beating-trial-opens-with-replay-of-videotape.html

The jury was composed of ten Caucasians, one Hispanic, and one [[Asian American|Asian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_19920506&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/06/us/after-the-riots-a-juror-describes-the-ordeal-of-deliberations.html |title=After the riots; A Juror Describes the Ordeal of Deliberations |work=The New York Times |date=May 6, 1992| accessdate= March 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutor, Terry White, was black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/trials24.htm |title=Jurist – The Rodney King Beating Trials |publisher=Jurist.law.pitt.edu |accessdate=August 11, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100826053233/http://www.jurist.law.pitt.edu/trials24.htm| archivedate= August 26, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/lapd/white.jpg Law.umkc.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 1992, the seventh day of [[Deliberation|jury deliberations]], the jury acquitted all four officers of assault and acquitted three of the four of using excessive force.  The jury [[hung jury|could not agree on a verdict]] for the fourth officer charged with using excessive force.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_19920506&quot;/&gt; The verdicts were based in part on the first three seconds of a blurry, 13-second segment of the video tape that, according to journalist [[Lou Cannon]], was edited out by television news stations in their broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/authors_corner/jan-june98/cannon_4-7.html |title=Online NewsHour Forum: Authors' Corner with Lou Cannon – April&amp;nbsp;7, 1998 |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=August 11, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100812192824/http://www.pbs.org/newshour/authors_corner/jan-june98/cannon_4-7.html| archivedate= August 12, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first two seconds of videotape,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=doug linder |url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/lapd/kingvideo.html |title=videotape |publisher=Law.umkc.edu |accessdate=August 11, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100823001955/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/lapd/kingvideo.html| archivedate= August 23, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- do NOT remove that citation please, it shows the complete video --&gt; in confirmation of claims by the police, the video showed King aggressing toward Laurence Powell. During the next one minute and 19 seconds, King is beaten continuously by the officers. The officers testified that they tried to physically restrain King prior to the starting point of the videotape but, according to the officers, King was able to physically throw them off himself.&lt;ref&gt;The American edition of the [[National Geographic Channel]] aired the program &quot;The Final Report: The L.A. Riots&quot; on October 4, 2006 10&amp;nbsp;pm [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]], approximately 27 minutes into the hour (including commercial breaks).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another theory offered by the prosecution for the officers' acquittal is that the jurors may have become desensitized to the violence of the beating, as the defense played the videotape repeatedly in slow motion, breaking it down until its emotional impact was lost.&lt;ref&gt;Cannon, L. (2002). ''Official Negligence : How Rodney King and the Riots Changed Los Angeles and the LAPD''. Basic Books. ISBN 0-8133-3725-9&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside the Simi Valley courthouse where the acquittals were delivered, county sheriff's deputies protected Stacey Koon from angry protest on the way to his car. Director [[John Singleton]], who was in the crowd at the courthouse, predicted, &quot;By having this verdict, what these people done, they lit the fuse to a bomb.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;CNN Documentary &quot;Race + Rage: The Beating of Rodney King&quot; aired originally on March 5, 2011, approximately 14 minutes into the hour (not including commercial breaks).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Riots==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mark downey2.JPG|thumb|280px|right|[[LAPD]] officers on [[Normandie Avenue]] and 3rd Street in [[Koreatown, Los Angeles|Koreatown]] during the riots]] --&gt;
The riots, beginning the day of the verdicts, peaked in intensity over the next two days. A dusk-to-dawn curfew and deployment of the [[California Army National Guard|National Guard]] eventually worked to control the situation.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Fifty-three people died during the riots, including ten who were shot dead by police and military forces,&lt;ref name=Crogan&gt;The most accurate documented count of the dead may be the April 24, 2002 ''[[LA Weekly]]'' article, &quot;The L.A. 53&quot;, by Jim Crogan. Using coroner's reports, police records and interviews, he documented the deaths of 53 people, including details about how they died.&lt;/ref&gt; with as many as 2,000 people injured. Estimates of the material losses vary between about $800&amp;nbsp;million and $1&amp;nbsp;billion. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Approximately 3,600 fires were set, destroying 1,100 buildings, with fire calls coming once every minute at some points. Widespread looting also occurred. Stores owned by [[Korean Americans|Korean]] and other [[Asian Americans|Asian]] immigrants were widely targeted,&lt;ref name=CSMDarkest&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0429/p01s07-ussc.html |title=L.A.'s darkest days |author=Daniel B. Wood |date=April 29, 2002 |publisher=Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=January 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although other stores owned by whites and blacks were targeted by rioters as well.

Many of the disturbances were concentrated in [[South Central Los Angeles]], which was primarily composed of African American and [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] residents. Half of all riot arrestees and more than a third of those killed during the violence were Hispanic.&lt;ref name=Pastor&gt;Manuel Pastor Jr, &quot;Economic Inequality, Latino Poverty, and the Civil Unrest in Los Angeles&quot;, ''Economic Development Quarterly'', Vol. 9, No. 3, August 1995, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kwong&gt;Peter Kwong, &quot;The First Multicultural Riots&quot;, in Don Hazen (ed.), ''Inside the L.A. Riots: What really happened&amp;nbsp;— and why it will happen again'', Institute for Alternative Journalism, 1992, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First day (Wednesday, April 29, 1992)===
The acquittals of the four accused Los Angeles Police Department officers came at 3:15&amp;nbsp;pm local time.  By 3:45, a crowd of more than 300 people had appeared at the Los Angeles County Courthouse protesting the verdicts passed down a half an hour earlier. Between 5 and 6&amp;nbsp;pm, a group of two dozen officers, commanded by Los Angeles Police officer, Lieutenant Michael Moulin, confronted a growing crowd at the intersection of Florence and Normandie in South Central Los Angeles. Outnumbered, the police officers retreated.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TELeNBory8 |title=‪LAPD Police Flee Angry Mob la riots 1992‬ |publisher=YouTube |date=April 3, 2010 |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By about 6:30&amp;nbsp;pm, a new group of protesters appeared at the Los Angeles Police Department's headquarters at [[Parker Center]], and fifteen minutes later, the crowd at Florence and Normandie had started looting, attacking vehicles and people.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

====Attack on Reginald Denny====
{{Main|Attack on Reginald Denny}}
[[File:Florence and Normandie.jpg|thumb|Looking northeast from the southwestern corner of Florence and Normandie, in March 2010.]]
At approximately 6:45&amp;nbsp;pm, Reginald Oliver Denny, a white truck driver who stopped at a traffic light at the intersection of Florence and Normandie Avenues, was dragged from his vehicle and severely beaten by a mob of local black residents as a TV news helicopter hovered above, piloted by reporter/pilot [[Bob Tur]], who broadcast live pictures of the attack, including a concrete brick that was thrown by 'Football' Damian Williams that struck Denny in the temple, causing a near-fatal seizure. As Tur continued his reporting, it was clear that local police had deserted the city.  

Coincidentally, it was Tur's live reports that led to Denny being rescued by an unarmed, African American civilian named Bobby Green Jr. who, seeing the assault live on television, rushed to the scene and drove Denny to the hospital using the victim's own truck, which carried twenty-seven tons of sand. Denny had to undergo years of rehabilitative therapy, and his speech and ability to walk were permanently damaged.  Although several other motorists were brutally beaten by the same mob, Denny remains the best-known victim of the riots because of the live television coverage. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

====Fidel Lopez beating====
At the same intersection, just minutes after Denny was rescued, another beating was captured on video tape. Fidel Lopez, a self-employed construction worker and Guatemalan immigrant, was pulled from his truck and robbed of nearly $2,000. [[Damian Williams (criminal)|Damian Williams]] smashed his forehead open with a car stereo&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes_williams&quot;&gt;{{cite news  | title = Man Pleads Guilty to Trying To Rob Trucker During Riot  |work=The New York Times  | date = March 17, 1993  | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/17/us/man-pleads-guilty-to-trying-to-rob-trucker-during-riot.html | accessdate= March 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as another rioter attempted to slice his ear off. After Lopez lost consciousness, the crowd spray painted his chest, torso and genitals black.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Alexander|first = Von Hoffman| title = House by House, Block by Block: The Rebirth of America's Urban Neighborhoods| publisher = Oxford University Press| year =2003|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=6tAQFzdJ6x0C&amp;pg=PA227&amp;lpg=PA227&amp;dq=fidel+lopez+riot#PPA227,M1| isbn = 0-19-514437-6| page = 227 | accessdate= March 4, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lopez survived the attack, undergoing extensive surgery to reattach his partially severed ear, and months of recovery.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Second day (Thursday, April 30)===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Mark Downey.JPG|thumb|200px|right|Olympic Blvd., Koreatown, Los Angeles during the riots]] --&gt;
Although the day began relatively quietly, by mid-morning on the second day violence appeared widespread and unchecked as heavy [[looting]] and fires were witnessed across [[Los Angeles County]]. Korean-Americans, seeing the police force's abandonment of [[Koreatown, Los Angeles, California|Koreatown]], organized armed security teams composed of store owners, who defended their livelihoods from assault by the mobs. Open gun battles were televised as Korean shopkeepers exchanged gunfire with armed looters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Organized law-enforcement response began to come together by midday. Fire crews began to respond backed by police escort; California Highway Patrol reinforcements were [[Airlift (logistics)|airlifted]] to the city; and Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley announced a dusk-to-dawn curfew at 12:15&amp;nbsp;am. President [[George H. W. Bush]] spoke out against the rioting, stating that &quot;anarchy&quot; would not be tolerated. The California [[United States National Guard|National Guard]], which had been advised not to expect civil disturbance and had, as a result, loaned its riot equipment out to other law enforcement agencies, responded quickly by calling up about 2,000 soldiers, but could not get them to the city until nearly 24 hours had passed because of a lack of proper equipment, training, and available ammunition which had to be picked up from [[Camp Roberts, California|Camp Roberts]], California (near [[Paso Robles]]).  {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} 
In an attempt to end hostilities, [[Bill Cosby]] spoke on the NBC affiliate television station [[KNBC]] and asked people to stop what they were doing and instead watch the final episode of ''[[The Cosby Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001070/bio Bill Cosby asks for peace during 1992 Los Angeles Riot]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bayweekly.com/year05/issuexiii26/featurexiii26.html Bay Weekly: This Weeks Feature Stories]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third day was punctuated by live footage of Rodney King at an impromptu news conference in front of his lawyer's Los Angeles offices on Wilshire &amp; Doheny, saying, &lt;!-- THIS WORDING IS CORRECT, DO NOT CHANGE IT --&gt;&quot;People, I just want to say, you know, can we all get along?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Keyes (author)|Keyes, Ralph]].

[[40th Infantry Division (United States)|National Guard units]] (doubled to 4,000 troops) continued to move into the city in [[Humvee]]s, eventually seeing 10,000 National Guard troops activated. Additionally, a varied contingent of 1,700 federal law-enforcement officers from different agencies from across the state began to arrive, to protect federal facilities and assist local police. As darkness fell, the main riot area was further hit by a [[power cut]].  {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} 

Friday evening, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George H.W. Bush]] addressed the country, denouncing &quot;random terror and lawlessness&quot;, summarizing his discussions with Mayor [[Tom Bradley (American politician)|Bradley]] and Governor Wilson, and outlining the federal assistance he was making available to local authorities. Citing the &quot;urgent need to restore order&quot;, he warned that the &quot;brutality of a mob&quot; would not be tolerated, and he would &quot;use whatever force is necessary&quot;. He then turned to the Rodney King case and a more moderate tone, describing talking to his own grandchildren and pointing to the reaction of &quot;good and decent policemen&quot; as well as civil rights leaders. He said he had already directed the Justice Department to begin its own investigation, saying that &quot;grand jury action is underway today&quot; and that justice would prevail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Bush | first=George H.W. | authorlink=George H.

By this point, many entertainment and sports events were postponed or canceled.  The [[Los Angeles Lakers]] hosted the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] in a basketball playoff game on the night the rioting started, but the following game was postponed until Sunday and moved to [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]].  The [[Los Angeles Clippers]] moved a playoff game against the [[Utah Jazz]] to nearby [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]].  In baseball, the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] postponed games for four straight days from Thursday to Sunday, including a whole 3-game series against the [[Washington Nationals|Montreal Expos]] (now Washington Nationals); all were made up as part of [[doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheaders]] in July.  In San Francisco, a city curfew due to unrest there forced the postponement of a May 1 [[San Francisco Giants]] home game against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/19/sports/baseball-4-doubleheaders-for-the-dodgers.html &quot;Baseball; 4 Doubleheaders For The Dodgers&quot;]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. May 19, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[horse racing]] venues [[Hollywood Park Racetrack]] and [[Los Alamitos Race Course]] were also shut down.  L.A. Fiesta Broadway, a major event in the Latino community, was not held in the first weekend in May as scheduled. In Music, [[Van Halen]] canceled two concert shows in [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] on Saturday and Sunday. [[Michael Bolton]] was scheduled to perform at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] for Sunday, but the concert was canceled. [[WWE|The World Wrestling Federation]] also canceled events on Friday and Saturday in the cities of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] and [[Fresno, California|Fresno]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Cawthon | first=Graham | url=http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/92.htm | title=1992 WWF results | publisher=The History of WWE | accessdate=January 12, 2009| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080505064406/http://www.angelfire.com/wrestling/cawthon777/92.htm| archivedate = May 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Southern California Rapid Transit District]] (now [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]) suspended all bus service throughout the Los Angeles area. Some major freeways were closed down.

===Fourth day (Saturday, May 2)===
On the fourth day, 2,000 7th Infantry Division (L) 2nd BDE soldiers, and a company's worth of military policemen from [[Fort Ord]], along with 1,500 U.S. Marines from [[Camp Pendleton]], arrived to reinforce the [[California Army National Guard]] soldiers already in the city. This federal force took twenty-four hours to deploy to [[Huntington Park, California|Huntington Park]], about the same time it took for the [[California Army National Guard]] soldiers. This brought total troop strength associated with the effort to stop the breakdown in civil order to 13,500. U.S. military forces directly supported Los Angeles Police officers in restoring order and had a major effect of first containing, then stopping the violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/jtf-la.htm |title=Operation Garden Plot, JTF-LA Joint Task Force Los Angeles : |publisher= GlobalSecurity.org |accessdate=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; With most of the violence under control, 30,000 people attended a peace rally. On the same day, [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice Department]] announced it would begin a federal investigation of the Rodney King beating.

===Fifth day (Sunday, May 3)===
Overall quiet set in and Mayor Bradley assured the public that the crisis was, more or less, under control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Del Vecchio, Rick, Suzanne Espinosa, &amp; Carle Nolte | title=Bradley Ready to Lift Curfew He Says L.A. is 'under control' |work=San Francisco Chronicle | page=A1 | date=May 4, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one incident, National Guardsmen shot and killed a motorist who tried to run them over at a barrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=itkgAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1888,183703|title=Motorist Shooting shakes L.A. calm|author=Karen Ball|agency=Associated Press|work=McCook Daily Gazette|date=May 4, 1992|page=1| accessdate= August 11, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sixth day (Monday, May 4)===
Although Mayor Bradley lifted the curfew, signaling the official end of the riots, sporadic violence and crime continued for a few days afterward. Schools, banks, and businesses reopened. Federal troops did not stand down until May 9; the Army National Guard remained until May 14; and some soldiers remained as late as May 27.

==Riots and Korean-Americans==
Korea-Americans in Los Angeles refer to the event as &quot;Sa-E-Gu&quot;, meaning &quot;four-two-nine&quot; in the [[Korean language]], in reference to the April 29, 1992, which was the day the riots started. The riots prompted various responses from Korean-Americans, including the formation of activist organizations such as the Association of Korean-American Victims, and increased efforts to build collaborative links with other ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rtjournal.cgu.edu/nancy_park.html CGU Culture Critique&amp;nbsp;–Los Angeles Riots: Sa-I-Gu&amp;nbsp;– From a Korean Women's Perspective]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the riots, many Korean immigrants from the area rushed to [[Koreatown, Los Angeles|Koreatown]], after Korean-language radio stations called for volunteers to guard against rioters. Many were armed, with a variety of improvised weapons, shotguns, and semi-automatic rifles.&lt;ref name=&quot;LA Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url =

According to Professor Edward Park, director of the Asian Pacific American Studies Program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lmu.edu/PageFactory.aspx?PageID=22013 Asian Pacific American Studies]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Loyola Marymount University]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://myweb.lmu.edu/epark/ Edward J.W. Park, Ph.D.]&lt;/ref&gt; the 1992 violence stimulated a new wave of political activism among Korean-Americans, but it also split them into two camps. The liberals sought to unite with other minorities in Los Angeles to fight against racial oppression and [[scapegoating]]. The conservatives emphasized [[law and order (politics)|law and order]] and generally favored the economic and social policies of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The conservatives tended to emphasize the political differences between Koreans and other minorities, specifically blacks and Hispanics.&lt;ref&gt;Edward J.W. Park, &quot;Competing visions: Political formation of Korean Americans in Los Angeles, 1992–1997,&quot; ''Amerasia Journal,'' 1998, Vol. 24 Issue 1, pp 41–57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Abelmann and John Lie, ''Blue dreams: Korean Americans and the Los Angeles riots'' (1997)&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most iconic and controversial television images of the violence was a scene of two Korean merchants firing pistols repeatedly at roving looters. ''[[The New York Times]]'' said &quot;that the image seemed to speak of race war, and of vigilantes taking the law into their own hands.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/03/us/riot-los-angles-pocket-tension-target-rioters-koreatown-bitter-armed-determined.html?pagewanted=all| title=Riot In Los Angeles: Pocket of Tension; A Target of Rioters, Koreatown Is Bitter, Armed and Determined|work=The New York Times |accessdate=August 2010 | first=Seth | last=Mydans | date=May 3, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; The merchants, jewelry store and gun shop owner Richard Park and his gun store manager, David Joo, were reacting to the shooting of Mr. Park's wife and her sister by looters who converged on the shopping center where the shops were located.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times2&quot;/&gt; 

David Joo, a manager of the gun store, said, &quot;I want to make it clear that we didn't open fire first. At that time, four police cars were there. Somebody started to shoot at us. The [[LAPD]] ran away in half a second. I never saw such a fast escape. I was pretty disappointed.&quot; Carl Rhyu, a participant in the Korean immigrants' armed response to the rioting, said, &quot;If it was your own business and your own property, would you be willing to trust it to someone else? We are glad the [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] is here. They're good backup. But when our shops were burning we called the police every five minutes; no response.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times2&quot;/&gt; At a shopping center several miles north of [[Koreatown, Los Angeles|Koreatown]], Jay Rhee, who estimated that he and others fired five hundred shots into the ground and air, said, &quot;We have lost our faith in the police. Where were you when we needed you?&quot;

One of the largest armed camps in Los Angeles' Koreatown, [[Los Angeles|Koreatown]] was at the California Market. On the first night after the verdicts were returned in the trial of the four officers charged in the beating of Rodney King, Richard Rhee, the market owner, posted himself in the parking lot with about 20 armed employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

Blacks also voice fears but fewer want to relocate.|author=K. Connie Kang|newspaper=Los Angeles Times| accessdate= August 11, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before a verdict was issued in the new 1993 [[Rodney King]] federal civil rights trial against the four officers, Korean shop owners prepared for the worst as fear ran throughout the city, gun sales went up, virtually all of them by those of Korean descent, some merchants at flea markets removed their merchandise from their shelves, storefronts were fortified with extra Plexiglas and bars. Throughout the region, merchants readied to defend themselves as if on the eve of a war.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times&quot;/&gt; College student Elizabeth Hwang spoke of the attacks on her parents' convenience store in 1992 and the fact that if trouble erupted following the 1993 trial, that they were armed with a [[Glock 17]] pistol, a [[Beretta]] and a [[shotgun]] and they plan to barricade themselves in their store to fight off looters.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times&quot;/&gt; Some Koreans formed armed self defence groups following the 1992 riots. Speaking just prior to the 1993 verdict, Mr. Yong Kim, leader of the Korea Young Adult Team of Los Angeles, which purchased five [[AK-47]]s, stated, &quot;We made a mistake last year. This time we won't. I don't know why Koreans are always a special target for African-Americans, but if they are going to attack our community then we are going to pay them back.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times&quot;/&gt;

==Post-riot commentary==
In addition to the immediate trigger of the Rodney King verdicts, a range of other factors were cited as reasons for the unrest. Anger over [[Korean American]] shop-owner [[Soon Ja Du|Soon Ja Du's]] weak sentence for fatally shooting a black teenager [[Latasha Harlins]] was pointed to as a potential reason for the riots, particularly for aggression toward Korean Americans. Publications such as ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' suggested that the source of these racial antagonisms was derived from perceptions amongst blacks that Korean-American merchants were taking money out of their community and refusing to hire blacks to work in their shops. According to this view, these tensions were intensified when Du was sentenced to five years probation but no jail time after a jury convicted her of [[manslaughter]].&lt;ref name=mathewsetal&gt;Tom Mathews et.al., &quot;The Siege of L.A.&quot;, ''Newsweek'', May 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Ellis, &quot;L.A. Lawless&quot;, ''Time'', May 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another explanation offered for the riots was the extremely high unemployment among the residents of South Central Los Angeles, which had been hit very hard by the [[Late 1980s recession|nation-wide recession]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityresearch.com/pubs/la_riot.pdf |title=The Los Angeles Riot and the Economics of Urban Unrest |format=PDF |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the high levels of poverty there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/apr/29/local/me-riots29 |title=15 years after L.A. riots, tension still high |work=Los Angeles Times  |date=April 29, 2007 |accessdate=August 11, 2010 | first1=Deborah | last1=Schoch | first2=Rong-Gong | last2=Lin II| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100810004945/http://articles.latimes.com/2007/apr/29/local/me-riots29| archivedate= August 10, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Articles in the ''Los Angeles Times'' and ''The New York Times'' linked the economic deterioration of South Central to the declining living conditions of the residents, and suggested that local resentments about these conditions helped to fuel the riots.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline Jones, &quot;Forgotten Americans&quot;, ''The New York Times'', May 5, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Don Terry, &quot;Decades of Rage Created Crucible of Violence&quot;, ''Time'', May 3, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Tale of Two Cities: Rich and Poor, Separate and Unequal&quot;, ''Los Angeles Times'', May 6, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Globilization of Los Angeles: The First Multiethnic Riots&quot;, ''Los Angeles Times'', May 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times, ''Understanding the Riots: Los Angeles Before and After the Rodney King Case'', Los Angeles: Los Angeles Times, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Social commentator [[Mike Davis (scholar)|Mike Davis]] pointed to the growing economic disparity in Los Angeles in the years leading up to the riots caused by corporate restructuring and government deregulation, with inner-city residents bearing the brunt of these changes. Such conditions engendered a widespread feeling of frustration and powerlessness in the urban populace, with the King verdicts eventually setting off their resentments in a violent expression of collective public protest.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Davis, &quot;In L.A., Burning All Illusions&quot; ''The Nation'', June 1, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Davis, &quot;The L.A. Inferno&quot; ''Socialist Review'', January–March 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; To Davis and other writers, the tensions witnessed between African-Americans and Korean-Americans during the unrest was as much to do with the economic competition forced on the two groups by wider market forces, as with either cultural misunderstandings or blacks angered about the killing of Harlins.&lt;ref name =Kwong/&gt;

One of the more detailed analyses of the unrest was a study produced shortly after the riots by a Special Committee of the California Legislature, entitled ''To Rebuild is Not Enough''.&lt;ref&gt;Assembly Special Committee ''To Rebuild is Not Enough: Final Report and Recommendations of the Assembly Special Committee on the Los Angeles Crisis'', Sacramento: Assembly Publications Office, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; After extensive research, the Committee concluded that the inner-city conditions of poverty, segregation, lack of educational and employment opportunities, [[police abuse]] and unequal consumer services created the underlying causes of the riots. It also pointed to changes in the American economy and the growing ethnic diversity of Los Angeles as important sources of urban discontent, which eventually exploded on the streets following the King verdicts. Another official report, ''The City in Crisis'', was initiated by the Los Angeles Board of Police Commissioners and made many of the same observations as the Assembly Special Committee about the growth of popular urban dissatisfaction leading up to the unrest.&lt;ref&gt;Webster Commission, ''The City in Crisis' A Report by the Special Advisor to the Board of Police Commissioners on the Civil Disorder in Los Angeles'', Los Angeles: Institute for Government and Public Affairs, UCLA, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his public statements during the riots, [[civil rights]] [[activism|activist]] and [[Baptist]] [[Minister of religion|minister]] [[Jesse Jackson]] sympathized with the anger experienced by African-Americans regarding the verdicts in the King trial, and pointed to certain root causes of the disturbances. Although he suggested that the violence was not justified, he repeatedly emphasized that the riots were an inevitable result of the continuing patterns of racism, police brutality and economic despair suffered by inner-city residents&amp;nbsp;— a tinderbox of seething frustrations which was eventually set off by the verdicts.&lt;ref&gt;Jesse Jackson, &quot;A 'Terrible Rainbow of Protest'&quot;, ''Los Angeles Times'', May 4, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Miles Colvin, &quot;Man with a Mission&quot;, ''Los Angeles Times'', May 6, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Democratic presidential candidate, [[Bill Clinton]], argued likewise that the violence resulted from the breakdown of economic opportunities and social institutions in the inner city. He also berated both major political parties for failing to address urban issues, especially the Republican Administration for its presiding over &quot;more than a decade of urban decay&quot; generated by their spending cuts.&lt;ref name=Brownstein&gt;Ronald Brownstein, &quot;Clinton: Paries Fail to Attack Race Divisions&quot;, ''Los Angeles Times'', Sunday Final Edition, May 3, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained that the King verdicts could not be avenged by the &quot;savage behavior&quot; of &quot;lawless vandals&quot;. He also stated that people &quot;are looting because ... [t]hey do not share our values, and their children are growing up in a culture alien from ours, without family, without neighborhood, without church, without support.&quot;&lt;ref name =Brownstein/&gt;

African-American Congressional representative of South Central Los Angeles, Democrat [[Maxine Waters]], said that the events in L.A. constituted a &quot;rebellion&quot; or &quot;insurrection&quot; caused by the underlying reality of poverty and despair existing in the inner city. This state of affairs, she asserted, were brought about by a government which had all but abandoned the poor through the loss of local jobs and by the institutional discrimination encountered by people of racial minorities, especially at the hands of the police and financial institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas P. Shuit, &quot;Waters Focuses Her Rage at System&quot;, ''The New York Times'', Sunday Final Edition, May 10, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Waters&gt;Maxine Waters, &quot;Testimony Before the Senate Banking Committee&quot;, in Don Hazen (ed.), ''Inside the L.A. Riots: What really happened&amp;nbsp;— and why it will happen again'', Institute for Alternative Journalism, 1992, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, President Bush argued that the unrest was &quot;purely criminal&quot;. Though he acknowledged that the King verdicts were plainly unjust, he maintained that &quot;we simply cannot condone violence as a way of changing the system ... Mob brutality, the total loss of respect for human life was sickeningly sad ... What we saw last night and the night before in Los Angeles is not about civil rights. It's not about the great cause of equality that all Americans must uphold. It's not a message of protest. It's been the brutality of a mob, pure and simple.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Excerpts from Bush's speech on the Los Angeles Riots: 'Need to Restore Order', ''The New York Times'', May 2, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Vice President [[Dan Quayle]] [[Dan Quayle#Vice Presidency|blamed]] the violence on a &quot;Poverty of Values&quot;&amp;nbsp;–&quot;I believe the lawless social anarchy which we saw is directly related to the breakdown of family structure, personal responsibility and social order in too many areas of our society&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commonwealthclub.org/archive/20thcentury/92-05quayle-speech.html |title=The Vice President Speaks |publisher=Commonwealthclub.org |date=May 19, 1992 |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the [[White House Press Secretary]], [[Marlin Fitzwater]], alleged that &quot;many of the root problems that have resulted in inner city difficulties were started in the '60s and '70s and ... they have failed ... [N]ow we are paying the price.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Wines, &quot;White House Links Riots to Welfare&quot;, ''The New York Times'', May 5, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several prominent writers expressed a similar &quot;[[culture of poverty]]&quot; argument. Writers in ''Newsweek'', for example, drew a distinction between the actions of the rioters in 1992 with those of the urban upheavals in the 1960s, arguing that &quot;[w]here the looting at [[Watts riots|Watts]] had been desperate, angry, mean, the mood this time was closer to a manic fiesta, a TV game show with every looter a winner.&quot;&lt;ref name =mathewsetal/&gt;

Meanwhile, in an article published in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' entitled &quot;How the Rioters Won&quot;, conservative columnist [[Midge Decter]] referred to African-American city youths and asked &quot;[h]ow is it possible to go on declaring that what will save the young men of South-Central L.A., and the young girls they impregnate, and the illegitimate babies they sire, is jobs? How is it possible to look at these boys of the underclass ... and imagine that they either want or could hold on to jobs?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Midge Decter, &quot;How the Rioters Won&quot;, ''Commentary'', Vol. 94, July 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media coverage==
Almost as soon as the disturbances broke out in South Central, local television news cameras were on the scene to record the events as they happened.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, R: ''Race, Media, and the Crisis of Civil Society: From the Watts Riots to Rodney King'', pages 81–120. Cambridge University Press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Television coverage of the riots was near-continuous, starting with the beating of motorists at the intersection of Florence and Normandie broadcast live by television news pilot/reporter [[Bob Tur]], and his camera operator, Marika Gerrard.{{citation needed|date=July 2011}} By virtue of their extensive coverage, mainstream television stations provided a vivid, comprehensive and valuable record of the violence occurring on the streets of Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=smith&gt;Erna Smith, ''Transmitting Race: the Los Angeles Riot in Television News'', Research Paper, President of the Fellows of Harvard College, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In part because of extensive media coverage of the Los Angeles riots, smaller but similar riots and other anti-police actions took place in other cities throughout the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;emergency.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/history/1992-the-la-riots |title=1992: The LA riots |publisher=libcom.org |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Emergency Broadcast System]] was also utilized during the rioting.

==Aftermath==
{{Expand section|date=June 2008}}
In the aftermath of the riots, pressure mounted for a retrial of the officers, and federal charges of [[civil rights]] violations were brought against them. As the first anniversary of the acquittal neared, the city tensely awaited the decision of the federal jury; seven days of deliberations raised fears of further violence in the event of another &quot;not guilty&quot; verdict. {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

The decision was read in an atypical 7:00&amp;nbsp;am Saturday court session on April 17, 1993. Two officers - Officer [[Laurence Powell]] and Sergeant [[Stacey Koon]] - were found guilty, while officers Theodore Briseno and Timothy Wind were acquitted. Mindful of accusations of sensationalist reporting in the wake of the first trial and the resulting chaos, media outlets opted for more sober coverage, which included calmer on-the-street interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Howard | last=Rosenberg | title=Los Angeles TV Shows Restraint |work=Chicago Sun-Times | page=22 | date=April 19, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police were fully mobilized with officers on 12-hour shifts, convoy patrols, scout helicopters, street barricades, tactical command centers, and support from the [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] and Marines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Seth | last=Mydans | title=Verdict in Los Angeles; Fear Subsides With Verdict, But Residents Remain Wary |work=The New York Times | page=11 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/04/19/us/verdict-in-los-angeles-fear-subsides-with-verdict-but-residents-remain-wary.html |date=April 19, 1993|accessdate=April 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Tisdall, Simon, &amp; Christopher Reed | title=All Quiet on the Western Front After King Verdicts |work=The Guardian |location=UK | page=20 | date=April 19, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All four of the officers involved have since quit or have been fired from the LAPD. Officer Theodore Briseno left the LAPD after being acquitted on federal charges. Officer Timothy Wind, who was also acquitted a second time, was fired after the appointment of [[Willie L. Williams]] as Chief of Police.  Chief Williams' tenure was also short-lived. The Los Angeles Police Commission declined to renew his contract, citing Williams' failure to fulfill his mandate to create meaningful change in the department in the wake of the Rodney King disaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Rodney King was awarded $3.8&amp;nbsp;million in damages from the City of Los Angeles for the attack. He invested most of this money in founding a record label, &quot;Straight Alta-Pazz Records&quot;. The venture was unable to garner any success and soon folded. Since the arrest which culminated in his severe beating by the four police officers, King was arrested at least a further eleven times on a variety of charges, including domestic abuse and hit-and-run.&lt;ref&gt;Gray, M: &quot;The L.A.

King and his family later returned to Los Angeles, where they ran a family-owned construction company. King, until his death on June 17, 2012, rarely discussed the incident or its aftermath, preferring to remain out of the spotlight. Renee Campbell, his most recent attorney, described King as &quot;...simply a very nice man caught in a very unfortunate situation.&quot;  {{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Many Los Angeles residents were motivated to buy weapons for self-defense against further violence, though the 10-day waiting period in California law stymied those who wanted to purchase firearms while the riot was going on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-17/local/me-5096_1_gun-sales|title=Going Great Guns : Security: The L.A. riots trigger a firearms-buying spree in the county.

Nearly a third of the rioters arrested were released because police officers were unable to identify individuals in the sheer volume of the crowd. In one case, officers arrested around 40 people stealing from one store- while they were identifying them, a group of another 12 looters were brought in. With the groups mingled, charges could not be brought against individuals for stealing from specific stores, and the police were forced to release them all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/06/03/us/police-can-t-identify-them-so-looting-suspects-go-free.html|title=Police Can't Identify Them, So Looting Suspects Go Free|date=June 3, 1992|author=Seth Mydans|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;
