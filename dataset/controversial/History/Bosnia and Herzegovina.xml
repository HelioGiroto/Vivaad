'''Bosnia and Herzegovina''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Bosnia and Herzegovina.ogg|'|b|ɒ|z|n|i|ə|_|ən|_|h|ɛ|r|t|s|ə|g|əʊ|'|v|iː|n|ə}}; [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: ''Bosna i Hercegovina''  [[Serbian language|Serbian]]: ''Босна и Херцеговина''), sometimes called '''Bosnia-Herzegovina''', is a country in [[Southeastern Europe]], on the [[Balkans|Balkan Peninsula]]. Its capital and largest city is [[Sarajevo]]. Bordered by [[Croatia]] to the north, west and south, [[Serbia]] to the east, and [[Montenegro]] to the southeast, Bosnia and Herzegovina is almost [[landlocked]], except for the {{convert|20|km|abbr=off}} of coastline on the [[Adriatic Sea]] surrounding the city of [[Neum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;coastline&quot;&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2060.html Field Listing – Coastline], ''[[The World Factbook]]'', 2006-08-22&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761563626/Bosnia_and_Herzegovina.html Bosnia and Herzegovina: I: Introduction]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}, ''[[Encarta]]'', 2006. [http://www.webcitation.org/5kwQDsIKK Archived] 2009-10-31.&lt;/ref&gt; In the central and southern interior of the country the geography is mountainous, in the northwest it is moderately hilly, and the northeast is predominantly flatland. The inland is a geographically larger region and has a moderate [[continental climate]], bookended by hot summers and cold and snowy winters. The southern tip of the country has a [[Mediterranean climate]] and plain topography.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is a region that traces permanent human settlement back to the [[Neolithic]] age, during and after which it was populated by several [[Illyria]]n and [[Celts|Celtic]] civilizations. Culturally, politically, and socially, the country has one of the richest histories in the region, having been first settled by the [[Slavic peoples]] that populate the area today from the 6th through to the 9th centuries AD. They then established the first independent [[ban (title)|ban]]ate in the region, known as the [[Banate of Bosnia]], in the early 12th century upon the arrival and convergence of peoples that would eventually come to call themselves ''Dobri Bošnjani'' (&quot;Good Bosnians&quot;). This evolved into the [[Kingdom of Bosnia]] in the 14th century, after which it was annexed into the [[Ottoman Empire]], under whose rule it would remain from the mid 15th to the late 19th centuries. The Ottomans brought [[Islam in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Islam]] to the region, and altered much of the cultural and social outlook of the country. This was followed by annexation into the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878–1918)|Austro-Hungarian Monarchy]], which lasted up until [[World War I]]. Following the dissolution of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], the country [[Breakup of Yugoslavia|proclaimed independence]] in 1992, which was followed by a [[Bosnian War|bloody war]], lasting until late 1995.

Today, the country maintains high [[List of countries by Human Development Index|literacy, life expectancy and education]] levels and is one of the [[Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina|most frequently-visited countries in the region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/bosnia-and-hercegovina |title=Lonely Planet's Bosnia and Herzegovina Tourism Profile |publisher=Lonely Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnia and Herzegovina is regionally and internationally renowned for its [[Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina|natural beauty]] and [[Culture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|cultural heritage]] inherited from six historical civilizations, its [[Bosnia and Herzegovina cuisine|cuisine]], [[Tourism in Bosnia and Herzegovina#Winter sports|winter sports]], its eclectic and unique [[Architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|architecture]] and the [[Sarajevo Film Festival]] and [[Sarajevo Jazz Festival]], both the largest and most prominent of their kind in Southeastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sff.ba/content.php/en/festival?set_culture=en |title=About the Sarajevo Film Festival |publisher=Sarajevo Film Festival Official Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidefilm.com/europe.html |title=Inside Film's Guide to Film Festivals in Europe |publisher=Inside Film}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country is home to three ethnic groups or, officially, [[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|constituent peoples]], a term unique for Bosnia and Herzegovina. [[Bosniaks]] are the largest group of the three, with [[Serbs]] second and [[Croats]] third. Regardless of ethnicity, a citizen of Bosnia and Herzegovina is often identified in English as a [[Bosnians|Bosnian]]. The terms [[Herzegovina|Herzegovinian]] and [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]]n are maintained as a regional rather than ethnic distinction, and the region of Herzegovina has no precisely defined borders of its own. Moreover, the country was simply called &quot;Bosnia&quot; (without Herzegovina) until the Austro-Hungarian occupation at the end of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utoronto.ca/tsq/03/vinko.shtml |title=The Language Situation in Post-Dayton Bosnia and Herzegovina |publisher=Toronto Slavic Quarterly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosnia and Herzegovina has a [[bicameral]] legislature and a three-member Presidency composed of a member of each major ethnic group. However, the central government's power is highly limited, as the country is largely decentralized and comprises two autonomous entities: the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Republika Srpska]], with a third region, the [[Brčko District]], governed under local government. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is itself complex and consists of 10 federal units - [[Cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|cantons]]. The country is a [[Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union|potential candidate for membership to the European Union]] and has been a candidate for [[NATO]] membership since April 2010, when it received a [[Membership Action Plan]] at the summit in [[Tallinn]]. Additionally, the country has been a member of the [[Council of Europe]] since April 2002 and a founding member of the [[Union for the Mediterranean|Mediterranean Union]] upon its establishment in July 2008.

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;

The first preserved mention of the name &quot;Bosnia&quot; is in ''[[De Administrando Imperio]]'', a politico-geographical handbook written by the [[List of Byzantine emperors|Byzantine emperor]] [[Constantine VII]] in the mid-10th century (between 948 and 952) describing the &quot;small country&quot; (χωρίον in [[Greek language|Greek]]) of &quot;Bosona&quot; (Βοσώνα).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thezaurus.com/sloveniana/glagolitic_script.htm |title=De administrando imperio |publisher=Thezaurus.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja]] from 1172-1196 of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Bar|Bar's Roman Catholic Christian Archbishop]] Grgur names Bosnia, and references an earlier source from the year of 753 - the De Regno Sclavorum (Of the Realm of Slavs). The name &quot;Bosnia&quot; probably comes from the name of the [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] river around which it has been historically based, which was recorded in the [[Roman Empire|Roman era]] under the name ''Bossina''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;&gt;Malcolm, Noel (1994). Bosnia A Short History. New York University Press. ISBN 0-8147-5520-8.&lt;/ref&gt; More direct roots of the river's names are unknown. Philologist Anton Mayer proposed a connection with the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] root ''*bos'' or ''*bogh'', meaning &quot;running water&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamovic&quot;&gt;Imamović, Mustafa (1996). Historija Bošnjaka. Sarajevo: BZK Preporod. ISBN 9958-815-00-1&lt;/ref&gt; Certain [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] sources similarly mention ''Bathinus flumen'' as a name of the [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]] ''Bosona'', both of which would mean &quot;running water&quot; as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamovic&quot;/&gt; Other theories involve the rare [[Latin]] term ''Bosina'', meaning boundary, and possible [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamovic&quot;/&gt;

The origins of &quot;Herzegovina&quot; can be identified with more precision. During the [[Middle Ages#Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]] the region was known as [[Zahumlje|Hum]], from the ''Zachlumoi'' tribe of southern Slavs which inhabited it. In the 1440s, the region was ruled by the powerful nobleman [[Stjepan Vukčić Kosača|Stephen Vukčić Kosača]]. In a document sent to [[Friedrich III, Elector of Saxony|Friedrich III]] on January 20, 1448, Stefan Vukčić Kosača called himself &quot;Herzog of [[Saint Sava]], Lord of Hum and Primorje, Grand Duke of Bosnia&quot;. Herzog is the [[German language|German]] for &quot;[[duke]]&quot;, and so the lands he controlled later became known as ''Herzegovina'' (&quot;Dukedom&quot;, from the addition of ''-ovina'', &quot;land&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt; The region was administered by the Ottomans as the [[Sanjak of Herzegovina]] (Hersek), which was briefly elevated to the status of an [[Eyalet of Herzegovina]] in the 19th century.

On initial proclamation of independence in 1992 the country's official name was the ''Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina'' but following the 1995 [[Dayton Agreement]] and the new constitution that accompanied it the name was officially changed to ''Bosnia and Herzegovina''.

==History==
{{Main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}

===Early history===
{{Main|Early history of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}

Bosnia has been inhabited since at latest the [[Neolithic]] age. The earliest Neolithic population became known in the [[Classical Antiquity|Antiquity]] as the [[Illyrians]]. [[Celts|Celtic]] migrations in the 4th century&amp;nbsp;BC were also notable. Concrete historical evidence for this period is scarce, but overall it appears that the region was populated by a number of different peoples speaking distinct languages. Conflict between the Illyrians and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] started in [[229 BC|229&amp;nbsp;BC]], but Rome did not complete its annexation of the region until [[9|AD&amp;nbsp;9]].

[[File:Daorson.jpg|200px|thumb|left|Walls of ancient [[Daorson]], Ošanići near [[Stolac]], Bosnia and Herzegovina, 3rd century BC.]]
It was precisely in what is now Bosnia and Herzegovina that Rome fought one of the most difficult battles in its history since the [[Punic Wars]], as described by the Roman historian [[Suetonius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Suetonius]], Tiberius 16,17&lt;/ref&gt; This was the Roman campaign against the revolt of indigenous communities from [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]], known in history as the [[Great Illyrian Revolt]], and also as the [[Pannonian revolt]], or [[Bellum Batonianum]], the latter named after two leaders of the rebellious Illyrian communities, [[Bato I|Bato]]/Baton of the [[Daesitiates]], and Bato of the [[Breuci]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Norma. Tacitus: Annals I, 2002, ISBN 1-85399-358-1. It had originally been joined to Illyricum, but after the great Illyrian/Pannonian revolt of AD 6 it was made a separate province with its own governor&lt;/ref&gt;

The Great Illyrian revolt was a rising up of Illyrians against the Romans, more specifically a revolt against [[Tiberius]]' attempt to recruit them for his war against the [[Germans]]. The Illyrians put up a fierce resistance to the most powerful army on earth at the time{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} (the [[Roman Army]]) for four years (AD 6 to AD 9), but they were finally subdued by Rome in AD 9.

The last Illyrian stronghold, of which their defence won the admiration of Roman historians, is said to have been Arduba.&lt;ref&gt;Stipčević, Aleksandar, The Illyrians-History and Culture, 1974, Noyess Press&lt;/ref&gt; Bato of Daesitiates was captured and taken to Italy. It is alleged that when Tiberius asked Bato and the Daesitiates why they had rebelled, Baton was reputed to have answered: &quot;''You Romans are to blame for this; for you send as guardians of your flocks, not dogs or shepherds, but wolves''.&quot; Bato spent the rest of his life in the Italian town of Ravenna.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Roman period, Latin-speaking settlers from the entire [[Roman Empire]] settled among the Illyrians, and Roman soldiers were encouraged to retire in the region.&lt;ref name=Malcolm&gt;{{cite book |last=Malcolm |first=Noel |title=Bosnia: A Short History |publisher=[[New York University Press]] |year=1996 |chapter=|isbn=0-8147-5561-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The land was originally part of [[Illyria]] up until the Roman occupation. Following the split of the Roman Empire between 337 and 395 AD, Dalmatia and Pannonia became parts of the [[Western Roman Empire]]. Some claim that the region was conquered by the [[Ostrogoths]] in 455 AD. It subsequently changed hands between the [[Alans]] and the [[Huns]]. By the 6th century, Emperor [[Justinian I|Justinian]] had reconquered the area for the [[Byzantine Empire]]. The [[Illyrians]] were conquered by the [[European Avars|Avars]] in the 6th century.

However, the Illyrians did not entirely vanish from Bosnia and Herzegovina with the arrival of new cultures. A large part of the remaining Illyrian culture intermingled with those of new settlers,  some of it is believed to have been adopted by the latter, and some survived up to date, such as architectural remains ( e.g.[[Daorson]] in [[Ošanići]] near [[Stolac]]), certain customs and traditions (e.g.tatooing, the 'gluha kola' dances, the 'ganga' singing, zig-zag and concentric circles in traditional decorations),  place names (e.g. [[Čapljina]], from 'čaplja', a south Slavic word for 'heron', coincides with 'Ardea', a [[Latin]]  word for 'heron', and 'Ardea', in turn, bears striking similarity with the name of [[Ardiaei]], the native Illyrian people of the wider Neretva valley region, where the town of Čapljina is situated), etc.&lt;ref&gt;Adzanela (Axhanela) Ardian, ''Illyrian Bosnia and Herzegovina-an overview of a cultural legacy'', 2004, Centre for Balkan Studies, Online Balkan Centre : http://www.balkancenter.org/Anglisht/ardian.ilyrianbosna.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval Bosnia===
{{Main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (958–1463)}}

[[File:Bosnia kingdom in the XIV c.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Expansion of the [[Bosnian kingdom]] in the XIV century]]
Modern knowledge of the political situation in the west Balkans into the region in the late 9th century. The [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] tribes also brought their mythology and pagan system of beliefs, the ''Rodovjerje''. In particular, [[Perun]] / [[Перун]], the highest god of the pantheon and the god of thunder and lightning is also commonly found in Bosnian toponymy, for instance in the name of ''Mount Perun'' (''Perunova Gora'' / ''Перунова Гора'').
Along with the Slavic settlers, the native Illyrians were [[Christianization|Christianized]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina, because of its geographic position and terrain, was probably one of the last areas to go through this process, which presumably originated from the urban centers along the Dalmatian coast. Thus, Slavic Bosnian tribes remained pagans for a longer time, and finally converted to Christianity.

The principalities of [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]] split control of Bosnia and Herzegovina in the 9th and 10th century, but by the [[High Middle Ages]] political circumstance led to the area being contested between the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] and the Byzantine Empire. Following another shift of power between the two in the early 12th century, Bosnia found itself outside the control of both and emerged as an independent state under the rule of local ''[[Ban (title)|bans]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

The first{{verify source|date=February 2012}} Bosnian monarch was [[Ban Borić]]. The second{{verify source|date=February 2012}} was [[Ban Kulin]] whose rule marked the start of a controversy with the [[Bosnian Church]], because he allowed an indigenous [[Bogomilism]] sect considered heretical by the Roman Catholic Church. In response to Hungarian attempts to use church politics regarding the issue as a way to reclaim sovereignty over Bosnia, Kulin held a council of local church leaders to renounce the heresy and embraced Catholicism in 1203. Despite this, Hungarian ambitions remained unchanged long after Kulin's death in 1204, waning only after an unsuccessful invasion in 1254.

Bosnian history from then until the early 14th century was marked by a power struggle between the [[Šubić]] and [[House of Kotromanić|Kotromanić]] families. This conflict came to an end in 1322, when [[Stephen II, Ban of Bosnia|Stephen II Kotromanić]] became ''Ban''. By the time of his death in 1353, he was successful in annexing territories to the north and west, as well as Zahumlje and parts of Dalmatia. He was succeeded by his nephew [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko]] who, following a prolonged struggle with nobility and inter-family strife, gained full control of the country in 1367. Tvrtko crowned himself in 1377 as Stephen Tvrtko I the [[List of rulers of Bosnia|King]] of &quot;Serbia, Bosnia, [[Pomorje]], and the Western lands&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singleton |first=Frederick Bernard |title=A Short History of the Yugoslav Peoples |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1985 |isbn=0-521-27485-0 |page=496 |ref=Singleton_1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ottoman Empire]] had already started its [[Ottoman wars in Europe|conquest of Europe]] and posed a major threat to the [[Balkans]] throughout the first half of the 15th century. Finally, after decades of political and social instability, the Kingdom of Bosnia ceased to exist in 1463.

===Ottoman Era (1463–1878)===

[[File:Ottomanbosnia.PNG|thumb|right|250px|The [[Eyalet of Bosnia|Ottoman provinces of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] in the 17th century.]]
The Ottoman conquest of Bosnia marked a new era in the country's history and introduced drastic changes in the political and [[cultural landscape]]. The Ottomans allowed for the preservation of Bosnia's identity by incorporating it as an integral province of the Ottoman Empire with its historical name and territorial integrity&amp;nbsp;— a unique case among subjugated states in the Balkans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riedlmayer&quot;&gt;Riedlmayer, Andras (1993). [http://www.kakarigi.net/manu/briefhis.htm A Brief History of Bosnia-Herzegovina]. The Bosnian Manuscript Ingathering Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within Bosnia the Ottomans introduced a number of key changes in the territory's socio-political administration; including a new landholding system, a reorganization of administrative units, and a complex system of social differentiation by class and religious affiliation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

The three centuries of Ottoman rule also had a drastic impact on Bosnia's population make-up, which changed several times as a result of the empire's conquests, frequent wars with European powers, forced and economic migrations, and epidemics. A native Slavic-speaking Muslim community emerged and eventually became the largest of the ethno-religious groups due to lack of strong Christian church organizations and continuous rivalry between orthodox and catholic churches.

The Bosnian Christian communities also experienced major changes. The Bosnian [[Franciscan]]s (and the Catholic population as a whole) were to a minor extent protected by official imperial decree, while the Bosnian Church disappeared altogether.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

As the Ottoman Empire continued their rule in the [[Balkans]] ([[Rumelia]]), Bosnia was somewhat relieved of the pressures of being a frontier province, and experienced a period of general welfare. A number of cities, such as Sarajevo and [[Mostar]], were established and grew into regional centers of trade and [[urban culture]] and were then visited by [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] traveler [[Evliya Çelebi]] in 1648. Within these cities, various Ottoman Sultans financed the construction of many works of [[Architecture of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian architecture]] such as the country's first library in [[Sarajevo]], [[madrassa]]s, a school of [[Sufi philosophy]], and a [[clock tower]] (''Sahat Kula''), bridges such as the [[Stari Most]], the [[Tsar's Mosque]] and the [[Gazi Husrev-beg's Mosque]].

Furthermore, some Bosnians played influential roles in the Ottoman Empire's cultural and [[political history]] during this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riedlmayer&quot;/&gt; Bosnian recruits formed a large component of the Ottoman ranks in the battles of [[Battle of Mohács|Mohács]] and [[Battle of Krbava field|Krbava field]], while numerous other Bosnians rose through the ranks of the Ottoman military to occupy the highest positions of power in the Empire, including admirals such as [[Matrakçı Nasuh]]; generals such as [[Isa-Beg Isaković]], [[Gazi Husrev-beg]] and [[Telli Hasan Pasha]]; administrators such as [[Ferhat-paša Sokolović]] and [[Osman Gradaščević]]; and [[Vizier|Grand Viziers]] such as the influential [[Mehmed Paša Sokolović]]. Some Bosnians emerged as [[Sufi]] mystics, scholars such as [[Ali Džabič]]; and poets in the [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]], [[Arabic]], and [[Persian language]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamovic&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Bruner-Dvorak, Rudolf - Bosna, Cazin 2 (ca 1906).jpg|thumb|[[Cazin]], Bosnia, circa 1906]]
However, by the late 17th century the Empire's military misfortunes caught up with the country, and the conclusion of the [[Great Turkish War]] with the [[treaty of Karlowitz]] in 1699 once again made Bosnia the Empire's westernmost province. The following century was marked by further military failures, numerous revolts within Bosnia, and several outbursts of plague. The Porte's false efforts at [[Ottoman military reform efforts|modernizing]] the Ottoman state were met with distrust growing to hostility in Bosnia, where local aristocrats stood to lose much through the proposed reforms.

This, combined with frustrations over [[concession (politics)|political concessions]] to nascent Christian states in the east, culminated in a partially unsuccessful revolt by [[Husein Gradaščević]], in 1831 after the Turkish Sultan [[Mahmud II]] slaughtered and abolished the [[Janissary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamovic&quot;/&gt; Related rebellions would be extinguished by 1850, but the situation continued to deteriorate. Later agrarian unrest eventually sparked the [[Herzegovina Uprising (1875-1878)|Herzegovinian rebellion]], a widespread peasant uprising, in 1875. The conflict rapidly spread and came to involve several Balkan states and Great Powers, a situation which eventually led to the [[Congress of Berlin]] and the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

===Austro-Hungarian rule (1878–1918)===
{{Main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1878–1918)}}

At the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] Foreign Minister [[Gyula Andrássy]] obtained the occupation and administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina, and he also obtained the right to station garrisons in the [[Sanjak of Novi Pazar]], which remained under [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administration. The Sanjak preserved the separation of Serbia and Montenegro, and the Austro-Hungarian garrisons there would open the way for a dash to Salonika that &quot;would bring the western half of the Balkans under permanent Austrian influence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Albertini|first=Luigi|title=The Origins of the War of 1914, Volume I|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1952|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;High [Austro-Hungarian] military authorities desired [an...] immediate major expedition with Salonika as its objective.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini 1952 33&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Albertini|first=Luigi|title=The Origins of the War of 1914, Volume I|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1952|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
On 28 September 1878 the Finance Minister, Koloman von Zell, threatened to resign if the army, backed by the [[Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen|Archduke Albert]], were allowed to advance to Salonika. In the session of the Hungarian Parliament of 5 November 1878 the Opposition proposed that the Foreign Minister should be impeached for violating the constitution with his policy during the Near East Crisis and by the occupation of Bosnia-Herzegovina. The motion lost 179 to 95. The gravest accusations were raised by the opposition rank and file against Andrassy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini 1952 33&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although an Austro-Hungarian side quickly came to an agreement with Bosnians, tensions remained in certain parts of the country (particularly the south) and a mass emigration of predominantly Slavic dissidents occurred.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt; However, a state of relative stability was reached soon enough and Austro-Hungarian authorities were able to embark on a number of social and administrative reforms which intended to make Bosnia and Herzegovina into a &quot;model colony&quot;.

With the aim of establishing the province as a stable [[political spectrum|political model]] that would help dissipate rising South Slav nationalism, Habsburg rule did much to codify laws, to introduce new political practices, and to provide for modernisation. The Austro-Hungarian Empire built the three Roman Catholic churches in Sarajevo and these three churches are among only 20 Catholic churches in the state of Bosnia.

Within three years of formal occupation of Bosnia Herzegovina, Austria-Hungary, in 1881, obtained German, and more importantly, Russian, approval for the annexation of these provinces, at a time which suited Vienna. This mandate was formally ratified by the [[League of the Three Emperors|Dreikaiserbund (Three Emperor's Treaty)]] on June 18 of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini17&quot;&gt;L.Albertini, The Origins of the War of 1914, vol 1, (New York, 2005), p37, ISBN 1-929631-31-6&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the accession of Czar Nicholas II, however, the Russians reneged on the agreement, asserting in 1897 the need for special scrutiny of the Bosnian Annexation issue at an unspecified future date.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini19&quot;&gt;L.Albertini, The Origins of the War of 1914, vol 1, (New York, 2005), p94, ISBN 1-929631-31-6&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gavrilo princip memorial plaque 2009 edit1.jpg|thumb|right|A plaque commemorating the location of the [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]].]]
External matters began to affect the Bosnian Protectorate, however, and its relationship with Austria-Hungary. A bloody coup occurred in Serbia, on June 10, 1903, which brought a radical anti-Austrian government into power in Belgrade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini70&quot;&gt;L.Albertini, The Origins of the War of 1914, vol 1, (New York, 2005), p140, ISBN 1-929631-31-6&lt;/ref&gt; Serb attempts to foment agitation followed, advocating a unified South Slavic state, ruled from Belgrade. This gained little support amongst most of the population of Bosnia Herzegovina, and only found fertile ground with disaffected portions of the Orthodox minority. Also, the revolt in the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1908, raised concerns that the Istanbul government might seek the outright return of Bosnia Herzegovina. These factors caused the Austrian-Hungarian government to seek a permanent resolution of the Bosnian question, sooner, rather than later.

On July 2, 1908, in response to the pressing of the Austrian-Hungarian claim, the Russian Imperial Foreign Minister Alexander Izvolsky offered to support the Bosnian Annexation in return for Vienna's support for Russia's bid for naval access through the [[Dardanelles]] Straits into the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini71&quot;&gt;L.Albertini, The Origins of the War of 1914, vol 1, (New York, 2005), p195, ISBN 1-929631-31-6&lt;/ref&gt; With the Russians being, at least, provisionally willing to keep their word over Bosnia Herzegovina for the first time in 11 years, Austria-Hungary waited and then published the annexation proclamation on October 6, 1908. The international furor over the annexation announcement caused Izvolsky to drop the [[Dardanelles]] Straits question, altogether, in an effort to obtain a European conference over the Bosnian Annexation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Albertini72&quot;&gt;L.Albertini, The Origins of the War of 1914, vol 1, (New York, 2005), p227, ISBN 1-929631-31-6&lt;/ref&gt; This conference never materialized and without British or French support, the Russians and their client state, Serbia, were compelled to accept the Austrian-Hungarian annexation of Bosnia Herzegovina in March 1909.

Political tensions culminated on 28 June 1914, when Serb nationalist youth [[Gavrilo Princip]], a member of the Serb movement, [[Young Bosnia]], [[Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|assassinated]] the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne, [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria|Archduke Franz Ferdinand]], in Sarajevo – an event that proved to be the spark that set off World War I. Although some Bosnians died serving in the armies of the various warring states, Bosnia and Herzegovina itself managed to escape the conflict relatively unscathed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riedlmayer&quot;/&gt;

===Kingdom of Yugoslavia (1918–1941)===
{{Main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1918–1941)}}

Following the war, Bosnia and Herzegovina joined the South Slav [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (soon renamed Yugoslavia). Political life in Bosnia at this time was marked by two major trends: social and economic unrest over [[redistribution (economics)|property redistribution]], and formation of several political parties that frequently changed coalitions and alliances with parties in other Yugoslav regions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Riedlmayer&quot;/&gt; The dominant ideological conflict of the Yugoslav state, between Croatian regionalism and Serbian centralization, was approached differently by Bosnia's major [[ethnic group]]s and was dependent on the overall political atmosphere.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt; The political reforms brought about in the newly established Yugoslavian kingdom saw few benefits for the Bosniaks; according to the 1910 final census of land ownership and population according to religious affiliation conducted in Austro-Hungary, Muslims (Bosniaks) owned 91.1%, Orthodox Serbians owned 6.0%, Croatian Catholics owned 2.6% and others, 0.3% of the property. Following the reforms Bosnian Muslims had a total of 1,175,305 hectares of agricultural and forest land taken away from them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Danijela Nadj, dnadj@hic.hr |url=http://www.hic.hr/books/seeurope/010e-semiz.htm |title=An International Symposium &quot;Southeastern Europe 1918–1995&quot; |publisher=Hic.hr |accessdate=14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the initial split of the country into 33 [[oblast]]s erased the presence of traditional geographic entities from the map, the efforts of Bosnian politicians such as [[Mehmed Spaho]] ensured that the six oblasts carved up from Bosnia and Herzegovina corresponded to the six sanjaks from Ottoman times and, thus, matched the country's traditional boundary as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

The establishment of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1929, however, brought the redrawing of administrative regions into [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia#Subdivisions|banates]] or ''[[banovina (region)|banovinas]]'' that purposely avoided all historical and ethnic lines, removing any trace of a Bosnian entity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt; Serbo-Croat tensions over the structuring of the Yugoslav state continued, with the concept of a separate Bosnian division receiving little or no consideration.

The [[Cvetković–Maček Agreement|Cvetković-Maček Agreement]] that created the [[Banovina of Croatia|Croatian banate]] in 1939 encouraged what was essentially a partition of Bosnia between Croatia and Serbia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Imamovic&quot;/&gt; However the rising threat of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Nazi Germany]] forced Yugoslav politicians to shift their attention. Following a period that saw attempts at [[appeasement]], the signing of the [[Tripartite Pact|Tripartite Treaty]], and a coup d'état, Yugoslavia was finally invaded by Germany on 6 April 1941.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

===World War II (1941–45)===

Once the kingdom of Yugoslavia was conquered by Nazi forces in World War II, all of Bosnia was ceded to the Nazi puppet regime, [[Independent State of Croatia]].
The Croat leaders embarked on a [[World War II persecution of Serbs|campaign of extermination]] of [[Serbs]], Jews, [[Roma (Romani subgroup)|Roma]], Croats who opposed the regime, communists and large numbers of [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisans]] by setting up a number of [[Jasenovac concentration camp|death camps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4479837.stm|title=Balkan 'Auschwitz' haunts Croatia |publisher=BBC News|author=|date=25 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Serbs themselves took up arms and joined the [[Chetniks]], a Serb nationalist movement that conducted operations against the Nazi forces and the partisans. The Chetniks were also known to persecute and murder non-Serbs and communist sympathizers. They committed many war crimes against Bosnian Muslims in Eastern Bosnia.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} On October 12, 1941 a group of 108 notable Muslim citizens of Sarajevo signed the [[Resolution of Sarajevo Muslims]] by which they condemned the [[World War II persecution of Serbs|persecution of Serbs]] organized by [[Ustaše]], made distinction between Muslims who participated in such persecutions and whole Muslim population, presented informations about the persecutions of Muslims by Serbs and requested security for all citizens of the country, regardless of their identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Hadžijahić |first=Muhamed |author=Muhamed Hadžijahić |title=Istorija Naroda Bosne i Hercegovine |url=|archiveurl=|archivedate=|format=|accessdate=|edition=|series=|volume=|date=|origyear=|year=1973 |month=|publisher=Institut za istoriju radničkog pokreta |location=Sarajevo|language=Serbocroatian |page=277 |chapter=Muslimanske rezolucije iz 1941 godine [Muslim resolutions of 1941] |chapterurl=http://www.scribd.com/doc/47323922/Muhamed-Hadzijahic-Muslimanske-rezolucije-1941}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, many Bosnian Muslims served in the [[13th Waffen Mountain Division of the SS Handschar (1st Croatian)|Waffen-SS]] units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Starting in 1941, Yugoslav communists under the leadership of [[Josip Broz Tito]] organized their own multi-ethnic resistance group, the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|partisans]], who fought against both Axis and Chetnik forces. On 29 November 1943 the [[Anti-Fascist Council of National Liberation of Yugoslavia]] with Tito at its helm held a founding conference in [[Jajce]] where Bosnia and Herzegovina was reestablished as a republic within the Yugoslavian federation in its Habsburg borders.

Military success eventually prompted the Allies to support the Partisans, but Tito declined their offer to help and relied on his own forces instead. All the major military offensives by the antifascist movement of Yugoslavia against Nazis and their local supporters were conducted in Bosnia-Herzegovina and its peoples bore the brunt of fighting. More than 300,000 people died in Bosnia and Herzegovina in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Žerjavić|first=Vladimir|title='Yugoslavia manipulations with the number Second World War victims''|publisher=Croatian Information Centre|isbn=0-919817-32-7|url=http://www.hic.hr/books/manipulations/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the war the establishment of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], with the [[1946 Yugoslav Constitution|constitution of 1946]], officially made Bosnia and Herzegovina one of six constituent republics in the new state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

===Socialist Yugoslavia (1945–1992)===
{{Main|History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (1945–1992)}}

Because of its central geographic position within the Yugoslavian federation, post-war Bosnia was selected as a base for the development of the [[defense (military)|military defense]] industry. This contributed to a large concentration of arms and military personnel in Bosnia; a significant factor in the [[Bosnian War|war]] that followed the break-up of Yugoslavia in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt; However, Bosnia's existence within Yugoslavia, for the large part, was peaceful and prosperous.
Though considered a political backwater of the federation for much of the 1950s and 1960s, in the 1970s a strong Bosnian political elite arose, fueled in part by Tito's leadership in the [[Non-Aligned Movement]] and Bosnians serving in Yugoslavia's [[diplomatic corps]].

While working within the communist system, politicians such as [[Džemal Bijedić]], [[Branko Mikulić]] and [[Hamdija Pozderac]] reinforced and protected the sovereignty of Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;ref name=&quot;Stojic&quot;&gt;Stojic, Mile (2005). [http://www.bosnia.org.uk/bosrep/report_format.cfm?articleid=3058&amp;reportid=170 Branko Mikulic – socialist emperor manqué]. [[BH Dani]]&lt;/ref&gt; Their efforts proved key during the turbulent period following Tito's death in 1980, and are today considered some of the early steps towards Bosnian independence. However, the republic did not escape the increasingly nationalistic climate of the time. With the fall of the Soviet Union and the start of the break-up of Yugoslavia, the old communist doctrine of tolerance began to lose its potency, creating an opportunity for nationalist elements in the society to spread their influence.

===Bosnian War for independence (1992–1995)===

On 18 November 1990 the first multi-party parliamentary elections were held (with a second round on 25 November), which resulted in a [[National Assembly|national assembly]] dominated by three ethnically based parties, which had formed a loose coalition to oust the communists from power.&lt;ref name=&quot;phron1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phron.org/Reference/Books/Balkans%20-%20post%20communist%20history.pdf |title=The Balkans: A post-Communist History |format=PDF |accessdate=14 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]]'s subsequent declarations of independence and the warfare that ensued placed Bosnia and Herzegovina and its three constituent peoples in an awkward position. A significant split soon developed on the issue of whether to stay with the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav federation]] (overwhelmingly favored among Serbs) or seek independence (overwhelmingly favored among Bosniaks and Croats).

The [[Serbs|Serb]] members of parliament, consisting mainly of the [[Serbian Democratic Party (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Serb Democratic Party]] members, abandoned the central parliament in Sarajevo, and formed the [[National Assembly of the Republika Srpska|Assembly of the Serb People of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 24 October 1991, which marked the end of the tri-ethnic coalition that governed after the elections in 1990. This Assembly established the [[Republika Srpska|Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] on 9 January 1992, which became [[Republika Srpska]] in August 1992.

On 18 November 1991, the party branch in Bosnia and Herzegovina of the ruling party in the Republic of Croatia, the [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ), proclaimed the existence of the [[Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia|Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia]], as a separate &quot;political, cultural, economic and territorial whole&quot;, on the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina, with [[Croatian Defence Council|Croat Defence Council]] (HVO) as its military part.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICTY: Prlić et al.

A declaration of Bosnia and Herzegovina sovereignty on 15 October 1991 was followed by a referendum for independence from [[Yugoslavia]] on 29 February and 1 March 1992 boycotted by the great majority of the Serbs. The turnout in the independence referendum was 63.4 per cent and 99.7 per cent of voters voted for independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csce.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=UserGroups.Home&amp;ContentRecord_id=250&amp;ContentType=G&amp;ContentRecordType=G&amp;UserGroup_id=5&amp;Subaction=ByDate|title=The Referendum on Independence in Bosnia-Herzegovina: February 29 – March 1, 1992|year=1992|publisher=Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe|page=19|accessdate=2009-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bosnia and Herzegovina declared independence on 3 March 1992. Following a tense period of escalating tensions the opening shots in the incipient Bosnian conflict were fired when Serb paramilitary forces attacked Bosnian Croat villages around Capljina on 7 March 1992 and around Bosanski Brod and Bosniak town Gorazde on 15 March. These minor attacks were followed by much more serious Serb artillery attacks on Neum on 19 March and on Bosanski Brod on 24 March. The killing of a Bosniak civilian woman ([[Suada Dilberović]]), on 5 April 1992 by a sniper, while she was demonstrating in Sarajevo against the raising of barricades by Bosnian Serbs, is widely regarded as marking the start of warfare between the three major communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;phron1&quot;/&gt;

Secret discussions between [[Franjo Tuđman]] and [[Slobodan Milošević]] on the division of Bosnia and Herzegovina between Serbia and Croatia were held as early as March 1991, known as the [[Karađorđevo agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina P.|title=The Three Yugoslavias: State-Building and Legitimation, 1918–2004|year=2006|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=0-271-01629-9|page=379}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the declaration of independence of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina, the Serbs attacked different parts of the country. The state administration of Bosnia and Herzegovina effectively ceased to function having lost control over the entire territory.

Historical background}}&lt;/ref&gt;

International recognition of Bosnia and Herzegovina increased diplomatic pressure for the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA) to withdraw from the republic's territory which they officially did. However, in fact, the Bosnian Serb members of JNA simply changed insignia, formed the [[Army of the Republika Srpska|Army of Republika Srpska]], and continued fighting. Armed and equipped from JNA stockpiles in Bosnia, supported by volunteers and various [[paramilitary|paramilitary forces]] from Serbia, and receiving extensive humanitarian, logistical and financial support from the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], Republika Srpska's offensives in 1992 managed to place much of the country under its control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Malcolm&quot;/&gt;

Initially, the Serb forces attacked the non-Serb civilian population in Eastern Bosnia. Once towns and villages were securely in their hands, the Serb forces – military, police, the paramilitaries and, sometimes, even Serb villagers – applied the same pattern: Bosniak houses and apartments were systematically ransacked or burnt down, Bosniak civilians were rounded up or captured, and sometimes beaten or killed in the process. 2.2&amp;nbsp;million refugees were displaced by the end of the war (of all three nationalities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/research/RESEARCH/3ae6a0c58.pdf|title=The humanitarian operation in Bosnia, 1992–95: the dilemmas of negotiating humanitarian access|month=May|year=1999|publisher=United Nations High Commission for Refugees|accessdate=2008-06-24|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Men and women were separated, with many of the men detained in the camps. The women and indeed some children, as young as twelve years of age, were kept in various detention centres where they had to live in intolerably unhygienic conditions, where they were mistreated in many ways including being raped repeatedly. Serb soldiers or policemen would come to these detention centres, select one or more women, take them out and rape them.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICTY: Kunarac, Kovač and Vuković judgement - Foča&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/icty/kunarac/trialc2/judgement/kun-tj010222e-5.htm#VC|title=ICTY: The attack against the civilian population and related requirements}}{{Dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1992 the focus switched to [[Novi Travnik]] and [[Gornji Vakuf-Uskoplje|Gornji Vakuf]] where the Croat Defence Council (HVO) efforts to gain control were resisted. On 18 June 1992 the Bosnian Territorial Defence in Novi Travnik received an [[ultimatum]] from the HVO which included demands to abolish existing Bosnia and Herzegovina institutions, establish the authority of the Croatian Community of Herzeg-Bosnia and pledge allegiance to it, subordinate the Territorial Defense to the HVO and expel Muslim refugees, all within 24 hours. The attack was launched on June 19. The elementary school and the [[Post office|Post Office]] were attacked and damaged.&lt;ref&gt;ICTY – Kordic and Cerkez judgment – II. Persecution: The HVO Take-Overs B. Novi Travnik – [http://www.un.org/icty/kordic/trialc/judgement/kor-tj010226e-4.htm#IIB]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gornji Vakuf was initially attacked by Croats on 20 June 1992, but the attack failed. The [[Graz agreement]] caused deep division inside the Croat community and strengthened the separation group, which led to the conflict with Bosniaks. One of the primary pro-union Croat leaders, [[Blaž Kraljević]] (leader of the [[Croatian Defence Forces]] (HOS) armed group) was killed by HVO soldiers in August 1992, which severely weakened the moderate group who hoped to keep the Bosnian Croat alliance alive.&lt;ref&gt;''Sarajevo, i poslije'', Erich Rathfelder, [[Munich|München]] 1998 [http://www.hsp1861.hr/vijesti/201129erra.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The situation became more serious in October 1992 when Croat forces attacked the Bosniak population in [[Prozor-Rama|Prozor]]. According to ''[[Jadranko Prlić]] indictment'', HVO forces cleansed most of the Muslims from the town of Prozor and several surrounding villages.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICTY: Prlić et al. (IT-04-74)&quot;/&gt;

By 1993, when an armed conflict erupted between the predominantly Bosniak government in Sarajevo and the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia, about 70% of the country was controlled by Republika Srpska. [[Ethnic cleansing]] and [[civil and political rights|civil rights]] violations against non-Serbs were rampant in these areas. DNA teams have been used to collect evidence of the atrocities committed by Serbian forces during these campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Court wants exemplary Karadzic trial&quot;, [[BBC News]], 2008-07-24, retrieve 2009-07-12 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7522908.stm]&lt;/ref&gt; One single most prominent example is the [[Srebrenica massacre|Srebrenica Massacre]], ruled [[genocide]] by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]]. An estimated 8,372 Bosnians were killed by the Serbian [[political authorities]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''The Geography of Genocide''&quot;, Allan D. Cooper, p. 178, University Press of America, 2008, ISBN 0-7618-4097-4&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1994, the signing of the Washington Accords between the leaders of the republican government and Herzeg-Bosnia led to the creation of a joint Bosniak-Croat [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]], which absorbed the territory of the Croatian Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia and that held by the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The Federation soon liberated the small [[Autonomous Province of Western Bosnia]].

[[File:Bk-map.png|thumb|200px|left|Bosnia and Herzegovina after [[Dayton Agreement]].]]
A [[1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina|NATO bombing campaign]] began in August, 1995, against the Army of Republika Srpska, after the [[Srebrenica massacre]]. Meanwhile, a ground offensive by the allied forces of Croatia and Bosnia, based on the treaty in Split by Tudjman and Izetbegović, pushed the Serbs away from territories held in western Bosnia which paved the way to negotiations.
In December 1995, the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] in [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]], Ohio by the presidents of Bosnia and Herzegovina ([[Alija Izetbegović]]), Croatia ([[Franjo Tuđman]]), and Serbia ([[Slobodan Milošević]]) brought a halt to the fighting, roughly establishing the basic structure of the present-day state. A [[IFOR|NATO-led peacekeeping force]] was immediately dispatched to Bosnia to enforce the deal.

The number of identified victims is currently at 97,207, and the recent research estimates the total number to be less than 110,000 killed (civilians and military),&lt;ref name=&quot;hundred thousand&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/klu/eujp/2005/00000021/F0020002/00006852|publisher=European Journal of Population|title=War-related Deaths in the 1992–1995 Armed Conflicts in Bosnia and Herzegovina: A Critique of Previous Estimates and Recent Results|date=June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hundredthousand&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://today.reuters.com/News/CrisesArticle.aspx?storyId=L23677389|agency=Reuters |title=Research halves Bosnia war death toll to 100,000|date=2005-11-23}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hundredthousandplus&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.america.gov/st/washfile-english/2006/March/20060302182114MVyelwarC0.6359674.html|publisher=U.S. Department of State|title=Review of European Security Issues|date=2006-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 1.8&amp;nbsp;million displaced. This is being addressed by the [[International Commission on Missing Persons]].

According to numerous [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) judgements the conflict involved Bosnia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (later [[Serbia and Montenegro]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2004/ij/icty/2.htm#_Toc62882595|title=ICTY: Conflict between Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Croatia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hrw.org/reports/2004/ij/icty/2.htm#_Toc62882594|title=ICTY: Conflict between Bosnia and Croatia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bosnian government charged Serbia of complicity in genocide in Bosnia during the war at the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ). The ICJ ruling of 26 February 2007 effectively determined the war's nature to be international, though exonerating Serbia of direct responsibility for the genocide committed by Serb forces of [[Republika Srpska]]. The ICJ concluded, however, that Serbia failed to prevent genocide committed by Serb forces and failed to punish those who carried out the genocide, especially general [[Ratko Mladić]], and bring them to justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/docket/files/91/13685.pdf|title=ICJ: The genocide case: Bosnia v. Serbia|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ratko Mladić]] was arrested in a village in northern Serbia on 26 May 2011, being accused of directly orchestrating and overseeing the slaughter of 8,000 Muslim men and boys, amongst other genocide and war crime charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Profile: Ratko Mladic, Bosnian Serb army chief|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13559597|publisher=BBC NEWS europe |date=27 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The judges ruled that the criteria for genocide with the specific intent (''[[dolus specialis]]'') to destroy Bosnian Muslims were met [[Srebrenica massacre|only in Srebrenica]] or Eastern Bosnia in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/02/26/international/i033600S38.DTL&amp;type=politics|title=Courte: Serbia failed to prevent genocide, UN court rules|date=2007-02-26|agency=Associated Press|work=The San Francisco Chronicle|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The court concluded that the crimes committed during the 1992–1995 war, may amount to [[crime against humanity|crimes against humanity]] according to the [[international law]], but that these acts did not, in themselves, constitute genocide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sense-agency.com/en/stream.php?sta=3&amp;pid=9273&amp;kat=3|title=Sense Tribunal: Serbia Found Guilty Of Failure To Prevent And Punish Genocide}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court further decided that, following [[Montenegro]]'s [[declaration of independence]] in June 2006, Serbia was the only respondent party in the case, but that &quot;any responsibility for ''past'' events involved at the relevant time the composite State of Serbia and Montenegro&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icj-cij.org/icjwww/ipresscom/SPEECHES/ispeech_president_higgins_bhy_20070226.htm|title=Statement of the President of the Court}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosnia is located in the western [[Balkans]], bordering [[Croatia]] ({{convert|932|km|mi|disp=s|abbr=on}}) to the north and south-west, [[Serbia]] ({{convert|302|km|mi|disp=s|abbr=on}}) to the east, and [[Montenegro]] ({{convert|225|km|mi|disp=s|abbr=on}}) to the southeast. It lies between latitudes [[42nd parallel north|42°]] and [[46th parallel north|46° N]], and longitudes [[15th meridian east|15°]] and [[20th meridian east|20° E]].

The country's name comes from the two regions [[Bosnia (region)|Bosnia]] and [[Herzegovina]], which have a very vaguely defined border between them. Bosnia occupies the northern areas which are roughly four-fifths of the entire country, while Herzegovina occupies the rest in the south part of the country.

The country is mostly mountainous, encompassing the central [[Dinaric Alps]]. The northeastern parts reach into the [[Pannonian Plain|Pannonian basin]], while in the south it borders the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]]. Dinaric Alps generally run in east-west direction, and get higher towards the south. The highest point of the country is peak [[Maglić (mountain)|Maglić]] at 2,386&amp;nbsp;m, at the Montenegrin border. Major mountains include [[Kozara]], [[Grmeč]], [[Vlašić (mountain)|Vlašić]], [[Čvrsnica Mountain|Čvrsnica]], [[Prenj]], [[Romanija]], [[Jahorina]], [[Bjelašnica Mountain|Bjelašnica]] and [[Treskavica]].

Overall, close to 50% of Bosnia and Herzegovina is forested. Most forest areas are in Central, Eastern and Western parts of Bosnia. Herzegovina has drier Mediterranean climate, with dominant [[karst]] topography. Northern Bosnia ([[Posavina]]) contains very fertile agricultural land along the river Sava and the corresponding area is heavily farmed. This farmland is a part of the Parapannonian Plain stretching into neighboring Croatia and Serbia. The country has only 20 kilometers (12&amp;nbsp;mi) of coastline,&lt;ref name=&quot;coastline&quot;/&gt; around the town of [[Neum]] in the Herzegovina-Neretva Canton. Although the city is surrounded by Croatian peninsulas, by the international law, Bosnia and Herzegovina has a [[right of passage]] to the outer sea.

The major cities are the capital [[Sarajevo]], [[Banja Luka]] in the northwest region known as [[Bosanska Krajina]], [[Bijeljina]] and [[Tuzla]] in the northeast, [[Zenica]] and [[Doboj]] in the central part of Bosnia and [[Mostar]], the capital of [[Herzegovina]].

There are seven major rivers in Bosnia and Herzegovina&lt;ref name=fao&gt;{{cite web|title=Watershed Management in Mountain Regions in Bosnia and Herzegovina|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/009/a0269e/A0269E05.pdf|publisher=FAO|page=113|author=Izet Čengić, Azra Čabaravdić|accessdate=2011-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Sava River|Sava]] is the largest river of the country, but it only forms its northern [[natural border]] with Croatia. It drains 76%&lt;ref name=fao/&gt; of the country's territory into the Danube and the Black Sea. Bosnia and Herzegovina is therefore also a member of the [[International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River]] (ICPDR).
*The [[Una (Sava)|Una]], [[Sana River|Sana]] and [[Vrbas River|Vrbas]] are right tributaries of Sava river. They are located in the northwestern region of Bosanska Krajina.
*The [[Bosna (river)|Bosna]] river gave its name to the country, and is the longest river fully contained within it. It stretches through central Bosnia, from its source near [[Sarajevo]] to Sava in the north.
*The [[Drina]] flows through the eastern part of Bosnia, and for the most part it forms a natural border with Serbia.
*The [[Neretva]] is the major river of Herzegovina and the only major river that flows south, into the Adriatic Sea.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Bosnia and Herzegovina belongs to the [[Boreal Kingdom]] and is shared between the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] and Adriatic province of the [[Mediterranean Basin|Mediterranean Region]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], the territory of Bosnia and Herzegovina can be subdivided into three [[ecoregion]]s: the Pannonian [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]], Dinaric Mountains mixed forests and Illyrian [[deciduous|deciduous forests]].

==Government and politics==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2010}}
{{Main|Politics of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Political divisions of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
[[File:Map Bih entities.png|thumb|200px|left|Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (FBiH), [[Republika Srpska]] (RS), and [[Brčko District]] (BD).]]
[[File:Zgrada Vijeća ministara BiH Sarajevo.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Building of the Government of Bosnia and Herzegovina in Sarajevo]]
[[File:Presidency BosniaandHerzegovina.png|200px|thumb|right|The [[Presidency Building]] in central [[Sarajevo]].]]
Bosnia and Herzegovina has several levels of political structuring, according to the [[Dayton accord]]. The most important of these levels is the division of the country into two entities: [[Republika Srpska]] and the [[Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina covers 51% of Bosnia and Herzegovina's total area, while Republika Srpska covers 49%. The entities, based largely on the territories held by the two warring sides at the time, were formally established by the Dayton peace agreement in 1995 because of the tremendous changes in Bosnia and Herzegovina's ethnic structure. Since 1996 the power of the entities relative to the State government has decreased significantly. Nonetheless, entities still have numerous powers to themselves. The [[Brčko District]] in the north of the country was created in 2000 out of land from both entities. It officially belongs to both, but is governed by neither, and functions under a decentralized system of local government. The Brčko District has been praised for maintaining a multiethnic population and a level of prosperity significantly above the national average.&lt;ref name=&quot;OHR&quot;&gt;OHR Bulletin 66 (February 3, 1998). [http://www.ohr.int/ohr-dept/presso/chronology/bulletins/default.asp?content_id=4991#8 – Final hearing of the Arbitration Tribunal in Vienna]. OHR.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third level of Bosnia and Herzegovina's political subdivision is manifested in [[Cantons of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina|cantons]]. They are unique to the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina entity, which consists of ten of them. All of them have their own cantonal government, which is under the law of the Federation as a whole. Some cantons are ethnically mixed and have special laws implemented to ensure the equality of all constituent people.

The fourth level of political division in Bosnia and Herzegovina is the municipalities. The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina is divided in 74 municipalities, and Republika Srpska in 63. Municipalities also have their own local government, and are typically based on the most significant city or place in their territory. As such, many municipalities have a long tradition and history with their present boundaries. Some others, however, were only created following the recent war after traditional municipalities were split by the [[Inter-Entity Boundary Line]]. Each canton in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina consists of several municipalities, which are divided into local communities.

Besides entities, cantons, and municipalities, Bosnia and Herzegovina also has four &quot;official&quot; cities. These are: [[Banja Luka]], [[Mostar]], [[Sarajevo]], and [[Istočno Sarajevo|East Sarajevo]]. The territory and government of the cities of Banja Luka and Mostar corresponds to the municipalities of the same name, while the cities of Sarajevo and East Sarajevo officially consist of several municipalities. Cities have their own city government whose power is in between that of the municipalities and cantons (or the entity, in the case of Republika Srpska).

As a result of the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]], the civilian peace implementation is supervised by the [[High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina]] selected by the [[Peace Implementation Council]]. The High Representative has many governmental and legislative powers, including the dismissal of elected and non-elected officials. More recently, several central institutions have been established (such as [[defence minister|defense ministry]], security ministry, state court, [[indirect tax]]ation service and so on) in the process of transferring part of the jurisdiction from the entities to the state.

The representation of the government of Bosnia and Herzegovina is by elites who represent the country's three major groups, with each having a guaranteed share of power.

The Chair of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] rotates among three members ([[Bosniaks|Bosniak]], [[Serbs|Serb]], [[Croats|Croat]]), each elected as the Chair for an eight-month term within their four-year term as a member. The three members of the [[Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Presidency]] are elected directly by the people with Federation voters voting for the Bosniak and the Croat, and the [[Republika Srpska]] voters for the Serb.

The Chair of the [[Council of Ministers of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Council of Ministers]] is nominated by the Presidency and approved by the House of Representatives. He or she is then responsible for appointing a Foreign Minister, Minister of Foreign Trade, and others as appropriate.

The [[Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Parliamentary Assembly]] is the lawmaking body in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It consists of two houses: the [[House of Peoples of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Peoples]] and the [[House of Representatives of Bosnia and Herzegovina|House of Representatives]]. The House of Peoples has 15 delegates, two-thirds of which come from the Federation (5 Croat and 5 Bosniaks) and one-third from the Republika Srpska (5 Serbs). The House of Representatives is composed of 42 Members, two-thirds elected from the Federation and one-third elected from the Republika Srpska.

The Constitutional Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the supreme, final arbiter of legal matters. It is composed of nine members: four members are selected by the House of Representatives of the Federation, two by the Assembly of the Republika Srpska, and three by the President of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] after consultation with the Presidency.

However, the highest political authority in the country is the High Representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the chief [[executive officer]] for the international civilian presence in the country. Since 1995, the High Representative has been able to bypass the elected parliamentary assembly, and since 1997 has been able to remove elected officials. The methods selected by the High Representative have been criticized as undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.nyu.edu/eecr/vol7num2/special/bosnia.html|title=''The Contradictions of &quot;Democracy&quot; without Consent'', East European Constitutional Review, New York University Law School, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; International supervision is to end when the country is deemed politically and democratically stable and self-sustaining.

==Military==
{{Main|Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
[[File:BHArmy 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Bosnian-Herzegovinian soldiers armed with Yugoslavian-made [[SKS]] rifles]]
The Armed Forces of Bosnia and Herzegovina were unified into a single entity in 2005, with the merger of the [[Army of the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and the [[Army of Republika Srpska]], which had defended their respective regions. The [[Ministry of Defense of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Ministry of Defense]] had been founded in 2004.

The Bosnian military consists of the [[Bosnian Ground Forces]] and [[Air Force and Anti-Aircraft Defence of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Air Force and Air Defense]]. The Ground Forces number 10,000 active and 5,000 reserve personnel. They are armed with a mix of American, Yugoslavian, Soviet, and European-made weaponry, vehicles, and military equipment. The Air Force and Air Defense Forces has 2,500 personnel and about 45 aircraft. All of its aircraft are utility helicopters and basic trainers. The Air Defense Forces operate [[MANPAD]] hand-held missiles, [[Surface-to-Air Missile|SAM]] missile batteries, anti-aircraft cannons, and radar. Almost all of its anti-aircraft equipment is of Soviet origin, though it also operates some U.S. and Swedish hardware.

==Foreign relations==
{{Main|Foreign relations of Bosnia and Herzegovina}}
{{See also|Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union}}
[[Accession of Bosnia and Herzegovina to the European Union|EU integration]] is one of the main political objectives of Bosnia and Herzegovina, it initiated the [[Stabilisation and Association Process]] in 2007. Countries participating in the SAP have been offered the possibility to become, once they fulfill the necessary conditions, Member States of the EU. Bosnia and Herzegovina is therefore a potential candidate country for EU accession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enlargement/potential-candidate-countries/bosnia_and_herzegovina/eu_bosnia_and_herzegovina_relations_en.htm |title=European Commission – Enlargement – Bosnia and Herzegovina – Relations with the EU |work=Europa (web portal) |accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]] of 1995 has focused the efforts of policymakers in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the international community, on regional stabilization in the countries-successors of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]]. Within Bosnia and Herzegovina, relations with its neighbors of [[Croatia]], [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] have been fairly stable since the signing of the [[Dayton Agreement]] in 1995.

On April 23, 2010, Bosnia and Herzegovina received the [[Membership Action Plan]] from [[NATO]], which is the last step before full membership in the alliance. Full membership is expected in 2014 or 2015, depending on the progress of reforms.

Bosnia and Herzegovina is home to three ethnic &quot;[[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|constituent peoples]]&quot;: [[Bosniaks]], [[Serbs]] and [[Croats]]. Tensions between the three constitutional peoples remain high and often provoke political disagreements.

According to the [[1991 population census in Bosnia and Herzegovina|1991 census]], Bosnia and Herzegovina had a population of 4,377,000, while the 1996 UNHCR unofficial census showed a decrease to 3,920,000.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} Large population migrations during the Yugoslav wars in the 1990s have caused demographic shifts in the country. No census has been taken since 1991/96, and political disagreements have made it impossible to organize one. Nevertheless, a census has been planned for 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/bosnia-edges-closer-to-census&lt;/ref&gt; As almost all of the post-war data is simply an estimate, a census would be a statistical, inclusive, and objective way to analyze the demographics of Bosnia and Herzegovina. Most sources, however, estimate the population to be about four million, representing a decrease of 500,000 since 1991. The last official estimate by BHAS (Agency for Statistics of BiH) for 2011 shows a decrease of the population to 3,840,000.&lt;ref name='asbh'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bhas.ba/ |title=Agency for Statistics Bosnia and Herzegovina |publisher=Bhas.ba |date= |accessdate=2012-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other BHAS estimation of population done on 30 June 2009 is 3,843,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Timur|last=Ljubuncic|url=http://www.bhas.ba/eng/Default.asp |title=Agencija za statistiku Bosne i Hercegovine - BHAS |publisher=Bhas.ba |date=2009-06-30 |accessdate=2010-05-19}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bosnia faces the dual problem of rebuilding a war-torn country and introducing market reforms to its formerly centrally planned economy. One legacy of the previous era is a greatly overstaffed military industry; under former leader [[Josip Broz Tito]], military industries were promoted in the republic, resulting in the development of a large share of Yugoslavia's defense plants but fewer commercially-viable firms.

For the most of Bosnia's history, agriculture has been based on small and inefficient privately owned farms; food has traditionally been a net import for the republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/serbian_digest/225/t225-4.htm|title=A Divided Bosnia, January 29, 1996, Aleksandar Ciric}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The war in the 1990s caused a dramatic change in the Bosnian economy.&lt;ref&gt;Daclon, Corrado Maria (1997). Bosnia. Maggioli. Italy&lt;/ref&gt; GDP fell by 75% and the destruction of physical infrastructure devastated the economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/public/english/employment/skills/training/publ/pub12.htm|title=Post-conflict Bosnia and Herzegovina – Martha Walsh – Employment Sector|publisher=ILO|accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; While much of the production capacity has been restored, the Bosnian economy still faces considerable difficulties. Figures show GDP and per capita income increased 10% from 2003 to 2004; this and Bosnia's shrinking [[Government debt|national debt]] being positive trends, but high unemployment and a large [[Balance of trade|trade deficit]] remain cause for concern.

The national currency is the (Euro-pegged) [[Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark|Convertible Mark]] (KM), controlled by the [[currency board]]. Annual inflation is the lowest relative to other countries in the region at 1.9% in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency]]|title=[[The World Factbook|World Factbook]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international debt was $3.1&amp;nbsp;billion (2005 est) – the smallest amount of debt owed of all the former Yugoslav republics. [[Gross domestic product|Real GDP]] growth rate was 5% for 2004 according to the Bosnian [[Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Central Bank of BiH]] and Statistical Office of Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Bosnia and Herzegovina has one of the highest [[List of countries by income equality|income equality rankings]] in the world, ranking eighth out of 193 nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/hdr2006/pdfs/report/HDR06-complete.pdf#page=335|title=Table 15: Inequality in income or expenditure|accessdate=2007-01-09|publisher=UN|year=2006|format=PDF|work=Human Development Report 2006|page=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Eurostat]] data, Bosnia and Herzegovina's PPS GDP per capita stood at 29 per cent of the EU average in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/tgm/table.do?tab=table&amp;init=1&amp;plugin=1&amp;language=en&amp;pcode=tec00114|title=GDP per capita in PPS|publisher=Eurostat|accessdate=2011-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art of Bosnia and Herzegovina was always evolving and ranged from the original medieval tombstones called [[Stećci]] to paintings in [[House of Kotromanić|Kotromanić]] court. However, only with the arrival of Austro-Hungarians did the painting renaissance in Bosnia really begin to flourish.

Among those are: [[Gabrijel Jurkić]], Petar Tiješić, Karlo Mijić, Špiro Bocarić, Petar Šain, Đoko Mazalić, Roman Petrović and Lazar Drljača.

The [[Yugoslavia national basketball team|Yugoslav national basketball team]], which medaled in every world championship from 1963 through 1990, included Bosnian players such as [[Dražen Dalipagić]] and [[Mirza Delibašić]]. Bosnia and Herzegovina regularly qualifies for the [[EuroBasket|European Championship in Basketball]]. [[Jedinstvo Aida]] [[women's basketball]] club, based in Tuzla, has won the 1989 European Championships in Florence.

Bosnia has produced many world-class basketball players, notably [[Mirza Teletović]], the first Bosnian in the [[NBA]], who has signed a three year deal with [[Brooklyn Nets]]. Among others are, [[Elmedin Kikanović]], [[Nihad Đedović]], [[Ognjen Kuzmić]], [[Jusuf Nurkić]], [[Nedžad Sinanović]], and [[Nemanja Mitrović]].

The Tuzla-Sinalco [[karate]] club from Tuzla has won the most Yugoslav championships, as well as four European Championships and one World Championship.

The Bosnian [[chess]] team has been [[Yugoslav Chess Championship|Champion of Yugoslavia]] seven times, in addition to club ŠK Bosna Sarajevo winning four Chess Club Cup : 1994 in [[Lyon]], 1999 in [[Bugojno]], 2000 in [[Neum]], and 2001 in Kallithea Elassonos. Chess grandmaster [[Borki Predojević]] has also won two European Championships: Under-12 years [[Litochoro]] (Greece) in 1999, and Under-14 years [[Kallithea Elassonos]] (Greece) in 2001, and in 2003 won World Championship Under-16 years [[Halkidiki]] (Greece).

He also won Yugoslav Championship in 1982, the Championship of the Balkans in 1983, and the Belgrade Trophy in 1985.

Association football is the most popular sport in Bosnia and Herzegovina. It dates from 1903, but its popularity grew significantly after World War I. At the local level, [[FK Sarajevo]] (1967 and 1984), [[FK Željezničar Sarajevo|Željezničar]] (1972) have both won the Yugoslav Championship. The former [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslav national football team]] has included a number of Bosnian players, such as [[Josip Katalinski]], [[Blaž Slišković]], [[Dušan Bajević]], [[Enver Marić]], [[Mehmed Baždarević]], [[Ivica Osim]], [[Safet Sušić]], [[Vahidin Musemić]] and [[Mirsad Fazlagić]].

For all time matches: [[Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team results|Bosnia and Herzegovina national football team results (1995-2011)]].

Bosnian national teams have struggled to draft the best national players. Many players born in Bosnia and Herzegovina choose to play for other countries because of their ethnic identification. For example [[Nikica Jelavić]] and [[Vedran Ćorluka]] were both born in Bosnia and Herzegovina but play for Croatia. Other internationally famous players from Bosnia and Herzegovina, who have made similar choices, are: [[Dejan Lovren]], [[Mladen Petrić]], [[Mario Stanić]], [[Neven Subotić]], [[Zlatan Ibrahimović]] (born and raised in Sweden, his mother a Croat, his father a Bosnian), [[Marko Marin (footballer)|Marko Marin]], [[Boris Živković]], [[Zlatko Junuzović]], [[Savo Milošević]], and [[Zdravko Kuzmanović]].

Bosnia and Herzegovina was the world champion of [[volleyball at the 2004 Summer Paralympics]] and [[volleyball at the 2012 Summer Paralympics]]. Many among those on the team lost their legs in the Bosnian War.

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Bosnia and Herzegovina cuisine}}
[[File:Cevapcici in somun.JPG.jpg|thumb|Ćevapčići in somun.]]
Bosnian cuisine uses many spices, in moderate quantities. Most dishes are light, as they are cooked in lots of water; the sauces are fully natural, consisting of little more than the natural juices of the vegetables in the dish. Typical ingredients include tomatoes, potatoes, onions, [[garlic]], [[capsicum|peppers]], [[cucumber]]s, carrots, [[cabbage]], [[mushroom]]s, [[spinach]], [[zucchini]], [[bean|dried beans]], fresh beans, [[plum]]s, milk, [[paprika]] and cream called [[Smetana (dairy product)|Pavlaka]]. Bosnian cuisine is balanced between [[Western culture|Western]] and [[Eastern world|Eastern]] influences. As a result of the [[Turkish cuisine|Ottoman]] administration for almost 500 years, Bosnian food is closely related to [[Turkish cuisine|Turkish]], [[Greek cuisine|Greek]], and other former [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] and [[Mediterranean cuisine|Mediterranean]] cuisines. However, because of years of Austrian rule, there are many influences from Central Europe. Typical meat dishes include primarily beef and [[lamb and mutton|lamb]]. Some local specialties are [[Ćevapčići|ćevapi]], [[burek]], [[dolma]], [[sarma (food)|sarma]], [[pilaf]], [[goulash]], [[ajvar]] and a whole range of Eastern sweets. Local wines come from [[Herzegovina]] where the climate is suitable for growing grapes. Herzegovinian loza (similar to Italian [[Grappa]] but less sweet) is very popular. Plum (''rakija'') or apple (''jabukovača'') alcohol beverages are produced in the north. In the south, distilleries used to produce vast quantities of [[brandy]] and supply all of ex-Yugoslavian alcohol factories (brandy is the base of most [[alcoholic beverage|alcoholic drinks]]).

===Leisure activities===
Coffeehouses, where [[Turkish coffee#Bosnia-Herzegovina|Bosnian coffee]] is served in [[cezve|džezva]] with [[Turkish Delight|rahat lokum]] and sugar cubes, proliferate Sarajevo and every city in the country. Coffee drinking is a favorite Bosnian pastime and part of the culture. Bosnians are believed to be some of the heaviest coffee drinkers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldofsevdah.com/bosnian-traditional-coffee/ |title=Bosnian traditional coffee &quot; World of Sevdah |publisher=Worldofsevdah.com |date=2007-03-08 |accessdate=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
