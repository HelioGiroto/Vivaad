The '''Falkland Islands''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɒ|l|k|l|ən|d}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ɔː|l|k|l|ən|d}}; {{lang-es|Islas Malvinas}}) are an [[archipelago]] in the South [[Atlantic Ocean]], located more than {{convert|250|nmi|lk=on|abbr=off}} east of the coast of mainland [[South America]]. The archipelago which has an area of 4,700 square miles (12,173&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) comprises [[East Falkland]], [[West Falkland]], and 776 smaller islands. [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]], the capital and only city, is on East Falkland. The islands, a [[British Overseas Territories|British Overseas Territory]], enjoy a large degree of [[self-governing|internal self-government]] with the [[United Kingdom]] guaranteeing good government and taking responsibility for their defence and foreign affairs.

Controversy exists over the Falklands' original discovery and subsequent colonisation by Europeans. At various times there have been French, British, Spanish, and Argentine settlements. Britain [[Re-establishment of British rule on the Falkland Islands|re-established its rule in 1833]], though the islands continue to be [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|claimed]] by [[Argentina]]. In 1982, following Argentina's [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|invasion of the islands]], the two-month-long undeclared [[Falklands War]] between both countries resulted in the surrender of all Argentine forces and the return of the islands to British administration.

The population, estimated at 3,140, primarily consists of native [[Falkland Islanders]], the majority being of British descent. Other ethnicities include French, [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarian]], and [[Scandinavia]]n. Immigration from the United Kingdom, [[Saint Helena]], and [[Chile]] has reversed a former population decline. The predominant and official language is English. Under the [[British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983|British Nationality Act of 1983]], Falkland Islanders are legally [[British nationality law|British citizens]].

The islands lie on the boundary of the [[Oceanic climate|Subarctic maritime climate]] and [[Oceanic climate|Temperate maritime climate]] zones with both major islands having mountain ranges reaching to {{convert|700|m|ft}}. The islands are home to large bird populations, although many no longer breed on the main islands due to introduced species. Major economic activities include [[fishery|fishing]], [[tourism]], sheep farming with an emphasis on high-quality wool exports, and oil exploration. Oil exploration, licensed by the [[Falkland Islands Government]], remains controversial as a result of maritime disputes with Argentina.

==Etymology==
{{See also|List of Falkland Islands placenames}}

The Falkland Islands took their English name from &quot;Falkland Sound&quot;, the channel between the two main islands, which was in turn named after [[Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount of Falkland]], by Captain [[John Strong (mariner)|John Strong]], who landed on the islands in 1690.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pepper |first=Peter J |title=Port Desire and the Discovery of the Falklands |journal=Falkland Islands Newsletter |edition=78 |year=2001 |month=March |url=http://www.falklands.info/history/histarticle19.html |accessdate=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish name, ''las (Islas) Malvinas'',&lt;ref name=&quot;WordReference&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wordreference.com/es/translation.asp?tranword=Falklands&amp;B10=Buscar&amp;dict=enes |title=Falklands |publisher=WordReference.com |accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; is derived from the French name,&lt;ref name=&quot;Malouines&quot;&gt;{{cite web

As a result of the [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|sovereignty dispute]], the use of many Spanish names is considered offensive in the Falkland Islands, particularly those associated with the [[Falklands War|1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falklands.info/background/99agree.html |title=Agreement of 14th July 1999 |publisher=Falklands.info |accessdate=23 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; General Sir [[Jeremy Moore]] would not allow the use of ''Islas Malvinas'' in the [[Falklands War Argentine surrender|surrender document]], dismissing it as a [[propaganda]] term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psywar.org/falklands.php |title=PSYOP of the Falkland Islands War |publisher=Psywar.org |accessdate=23 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy exists as to who first discovered the Falkland Islands, with competing Portuguese, Spanish, and British claims in the 16th century.&lt;ref name=FI-H-00&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/blog/2012/feb/02/who-first-owned-falkland-islands? |title=Who first owned the Falkland Islands? |publisher=The Guardian |date= 2 February 2012 |accessdate=11 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goebel|Goebel, 1971]], pp.&amp;nbsp;xiv–xv&lt;/ref&gt; While [[Amerindian]]s from [[Patagonia]] could have visited the Falklands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1690, Captain [[John Strong (mariner)|John Strong]] of the ''Welfare'' en route to [[Puerto Deseado]] was driven off course and reached the Falkland Islands instead, landing at Bold Cove. Sailing between the two principal islands, he called the passage &quot;Falkland Channel&quot; (now [[Falkland Sound]]), after Anthony Cary, 5th Viscount of Falkland, who as Commissioner of the [[Admiralty]] had financed the expedition. The island group takes its English name from this body of water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Falklands_Info&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falklands.info/history/history1.html |title=The Discovery of the Falkland Islands |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:John Byron-Joshua Reynolds-1759 .jpg|thumb|upright|[[John Byron]], by [[Joshua Reynolds]], 1759.]]
In 1764, [[France|French navigator]] and military commander [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]] founded the first settlement on Berkeley Sound, in present-day [[Port Louis, Falkland Islands|Port Louis]], [[East Falkland]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goebel|Goebel, 1971]], pp.&amp;nbsp;226&lt;/ref&gt; In 1765, British captain [[John Byron]] explored and claimed [[Saunders Island, Falkland Islands|Saunders Island]] on [[West Falkland]], where he named the harbour [[Port Egmont]] and a settlement was constructed in 1766.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Goebel|Goebel, 1971]], pp.&amp;nbsp;232,269&lt;/ref&gt; Unaware of the French presence, Byron claimed the island group for [[George III of the United Kingdom|King George III]]. Spain acquired the French colony in 1767, and placed it under a governor subordinate to the [[Governorate of the Río de la Plata#Buenos Aires Province governors|Buenos Aires colonial administration]]. In 1770, Spain attacked Port Egmont and expelled the British presence, [[Falklands Crisis (1770)|bringing the two countries to the brink of war]]. War was avoided by a peace treaty and the British return to Port Egmont.&lt;ref name=&quot;briefhistory2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falklands.info/history/history2.html |title=A brief history of the Falkland Islands Part 2 – Fort St. Louis and Port Egmont |publisher=Falklands.info |accessdate=8 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1774, economic pressures leading up to the [[American Revolutionary War]] forced Great Britain to withdraw from many overseas settlements.&lt;ref name=&quot;briefhistory2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falklands.info/history/timeline.html |title=Falkland Islands Timeline: A chronology of events in the history of the Falkland Islands |publisher=Falklands.info |accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon withdrawal, the British left behind a [[commemorative plaque|plaque]] asserting Britain's continued claim. Spain maintained its governor until 1806 who, on his departure, left behind a plaque asserting Spanish claims. The remaining settlers were withdrawn in 1811.&lt;ref name=&quot;briefhistory2&quot;/&gt;

In 1820, storm damage forced the [[privateer]] [[Heroína (ship)|''Heroína'']] to take shelter in the islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatham pp. 308-309&quot;&gt;[[#Tatham|Tatham, 2008]], pp.&amp;nbsp;308–309&lt;/ref&gt; Her captain [[David Jewett]] raised the flag of the [[United Provinces of the River Plate]] and read a proclamation claiming the islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatham pp. 308-309&quot;/&gt; This became public knowledge in [[Buenos Aires]] nearly a year later after the proclamation was published in the ''Salem Gazette''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatham pp. 308-309&quot;/&gt; After several failures, [[Luis Vernet]] established a settlement in 1828 with authorisation from the Republic of Buenos Aires and from Great Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatham&quot;&gt;{{cite book|chapter = Luis Vernet| last = Peter Pepper| first = Graham Pascoe  |editor=David Tatham|title=The Dictionary of Falklands Biography (Including South Georgia): From Discovery Up to 1981|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=0D0VNAAACAAJ|accessdate=15 August 2011|date=1 June 2008|publisher=D. Tatham|isbn=978-0-9558985-0-1|pages=540–546}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1829, after asking for help from Buenos Aires, he was instead proclaimed Military and Civil Commander of the islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatham&quot;/&gt; Additionally, Vernet asked the British to protect his settlement if they returned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mary Cawkell|title=The history of the Falkland Islands|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YG8VAAAACAAJ|accessdate=4 March 2012|date=31 August 2001|publisher=Anthony Nelson|isbn=978-0-904614-55-8|page=50}} ''&quot;On this visit he met Woodbine Parish who expressed great interest in his venture and asked Vernet to prepare a full report on the islands to submit to the British government.  On his side Vernet expressed the wish that, in the event of the British returning to the islands, HMG would take his settlement under their protection.&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

The leaders of the prisoners was Louis Vernet, a German, and Matthew Brisbane, an Englishman both of Buenos Aries.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and taken to [[Montevideo]],&lt;ref name=&quot;briefhistory3&quot;/&gt; where they were released without charge on the orders of Commodore Rogers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tatham|Tatham, 2008]], pp.&amp;nbsp;117&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1832, Argentina sent Commander Mestivier as an interim commander to found a penal settlement, but he was killed in a [[mutiny]] after four days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falklands.gov.fk/Historical_Dates.html |title=Historical Dates |publisher=Falkland Islands Government |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following January, British forces returned and requested the Argentine garrison leave.

Whittington, formed the Falkland Islands Commercial Fishery and Agricultural Association and tried to put pressure on the British government to proceed with the colonisation of the Falkland Islands. He published a leaflet entitled 'The Falkland Islands' containing material acquired indirectly from Vernet, and then presented to the government a petition signed by owner a hundred London merchants, shipowners and traders demanding that a public meeting be held to discuss the future of the Falkland Islands. In April 1840 he wrote to the Colonial Secretary, Lord Russell, proposing that the islands be colonised by his Association. In May the Colonial Land and Emigration Commissioners decided that the Falkland Islands were suitable for colonisation. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new harbour was built in Stanley,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tatham|Tatham, 2008]], pp.&amp;nbsp;382&lt;/ref&gt; and the islands became a strategic point for navigation around [[Cape Horn]]. A [[World War I]] naval battle, the [[Battle of the Falkland Islands]], took place in December 1914, with a British victory over the smaller [[Imperial German]] Asiatic Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tatham|Tatham, 2008]], pp.&amp;nbsp;510–511&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], Stanley served as a Royal Navy station and serviced ships which took part in the 1939 [[Battle of the River Plate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-WH2Navy-c4.html |title=CHAPTER 4 — The Battle of the River Plate |publisher=New Zealand Electronic Texts Centre |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sovereignty over the islands became an issue in the second half of the 20th century, when Argentina saw the creation of the [[UN]] as an opportunity to pursue its claim. Talks between British and Argentine foreign missions took place in the 1960s but failed to come to any meaningful conclusion. A major sticking point in all the negotiations was that the inhabitants preferred that the islands remain British territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;claim&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falklands.info/history/history5.html |title=A BRIEF HISTORY OF THE FALKLAND ISLANDS Part 5 – The Argentine Claim |publisher=Falklands.info |accessdate=28 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A result of these talks was the establishment of the islands' first air link. In 1971, the Argentine state airline [[LADE]] began a service between [[Comodoro Rivadavia]] and Stanley. A temporary strip was followed by the construction of a permanent airfield and flights between Stanley and Comodoro Rivadavia continued until 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;LADE&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.hcdn.gov.ar/proyxml/expediente.asp?fundamentos=si&amp;numexp=4812-D-2006 |title=Líneas Aéreas Del Estado, LADE |publisher=Argentine National Congress, Chamber of Deputies |language=Spanish |date=25 August 2006 |accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Albatross&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asociacionatta.com.ar/aviones/avion30.htm |title=Grumman HU-16B Albatross |publisher=Asociación Tripulantes de Transporte Aéreo |language=Spanish |accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FAA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asociacionatta.com.ar/aviones/avion23.htm |title=Fokker F-27 Troopship y Friendship |publisher=Asociación Tripulantes de Transporte Aéreo |language=Spanish |accessdate=25 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further agreements gave [[YPF]], the Argentine national oil and gas company, a monopoly over the supply of the islands' energy needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.falklands.info/history/history5.html | title = A Brief History of the Falkland Islands, Part 5 – The Argentine Claim | accessdate =2 September 2011 | last = Lewis | first = Jason | coauthors = Alison Inglis | quote = In 1974 Britain and Argentina agreed that the islands would be supplied with petrol, diesel and oil by YPF, the Argentine State Oil Company, at mainland rates.

On 2 April 1982, Argentina [[1982 invasion of the Falkland Islands|invaded the Falkland Islands]] and [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands|other British territories]] in the South Atlantic. The [[National Reorganization Process|military junta]] which had ruled Argentina since 1976 sought to maintain power by diverting public attention from the nation's [[National Reorganization Process#Economic policies|poor economic performance]] and the growing internal opposition and exploiting the long-standing feelings of the Argentines towards the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.me.gov.ar/curriform/publica/sirlin_conv_dictadura.pdf |title=Las convocatorias nacionales de la última dictadura |publisher=Ministerio de Educación, Ciencia y Tecnología de la Nación |language=Spanish |date=18 September 2006 |accessdate=23 August 2011 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several British writers hold that the United Kingdom's reduction in military capacity in the South Atlantic also encouraged the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Guide to the conflict |work=Fight for the Falklands—20 years on |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/in_depth/uk/2002/falklands/guide2.stm |quote=The Foreign Secretary, Lord Carrington, and two junior ministers had resigned by the end of the week &lt;nowiki&gt;[following the Argentine invasion]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

The British sent an [[Expeditionary warfare|expeditionary force]] to retake the islands, leading to the Falklands War. After short but fierce naval and air battles, the British landed at [[San Carlos Water]] on 21 May, and a land campaign followed leading to the British taking the high ground surrounding Stanley on 11 June. The Argentine forces surrendered on 14 June 1982. The war resulted in the deaths of 255 British and 649 Argentine soldiers, sailors and airmen, as well as 3 civilian Falklanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Before the Falklands War===
Shortly after the formation of the United Nations in 1945, Argentina asserted its right to sovereignty over the Falkland Islands and its dependencies. In 1947, the United Kingdom offered to submit the case over the [[Falkland Islands Dependencies]] to the [[International Court of Justice]] at The Hague, but Argentina refused the offer. A unilateral application by the United Kingdom in 1955 to the Court in respect of Argentine encroachment ended in deadlock when Argentina announced that it would not respect the decision of the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110606073350/http://www.raf.mod.uk/falklands/preface.html |archivedate=6 June 2011 |url=http://www.raf.mod.uk/falklands/preface.html |work=The Falkland Islands – A history of the 1982 conflict |title=Preface to a conflict |publisher=Royal Air Force |accessdate=6 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1960s, as part of the United Kingdom's [[decolonisation]] policy, secret discussions were held by the British and Argentine governments to identify a means by which the United Kingdom could cede the islands to Argentina while protecting the rights and way of life of the islanders. Details of the talks were leaked and the islanders protested against the talks having taken place. Subsequently however, economic and transport links between Argentina and the islands were established, but the political situation remained unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===After the Falklands War===
The dispute over control of the islands has continued since the Falklands War,&lt;ref name=AR_FA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancilleria.gov.ar/portal/seree/malvinas/homeing.html |title=Islas Malvinas, Georgias del Sur y Sandwich del Sur |publisher=Secretaría de Relaciones Exteriores [Argentine Ministry of Foreign Affairs] |accessdate=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although diplomatic relations between Argentina and the UK were resumed in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;Briefing papers&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN05602.pdf |title=Argentina and the Falkland Islands |publisher=House of Commons Library |date=22 June 2010 |accessdate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 Argentina [[1994 reform of the Argentine Constitution|added its claim]] to the islands to the [[Constitution of Argentina|Argentine constitution]], stating that this claim must be pursued in a manner &quot;respectful of the way of life of their inhabitants and according to the principles of international law&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdba.georgetown.edu/Constitutions/Argentina/argen94_e.html |title=Argentina Constitution, Georgetown University |publisher=Georgetown University |date=16 July 2008 |accessdate=15 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the war, successive Argentine governments have stated their intention to pursue their claim to the islands by peaceful means. Kirchner, [[Argentine general election, 2003|campaigning for president]] in 2003, regarded the islands as a top priority, taking actions such as banning flights to the Falklands from Argentine airspace. In June 2003 the issue was brought before a United Nations committee, and attempts have been made to open talks with the United Kingdom to resolve the issue of the islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Briefing papers&quot;/&gt;

In 1998, in retaliation for the arrest in London of the former Chilean president [[Augusto Pinochet]], the [[Chile]]an government banned flights between [[Punta Arenas]] and Stanley, thus isolating the islands from the rest of the world. [[Uruguay]] and [[Brazil]] refused to authorise direct flights between their territories and Stanley. This forced the islands' government to enter negotiations with the Argentine government and led to Argentina authorising direct flights between its territory and Stanley, on condition that Argentine citizens be allowed on the islands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://falklands.info/history/99comm.html Falklands.info], Agreement of 14 July 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and government==
{{Main|Politics of the Falkland Islands}}
The islands are a [[British Overseas Territory]] which, under the [[Falkland Islands Constitution|2009 Constitution]], enjoys a large degree of internal self-government, with the United Kingdom guaranteeing good government and taking responsibility for defence and foreign affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitution&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title= New Year begins with a new Constitution for the Falklands |url=http://en.mercopress.com/2009/01/01/new-year-begins-with-a-new-constitution-for-the-falklands |publisher=MercoPress |date=1 January 2009 |postscript =Links to the text of the constitution. |accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = constitutiontext&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falklands.gov.fk/site/legco/constitution-2008.pdf |title=The Falkland Islands Constitution Order 2008 |publisher=The Queen in Council |date =5 November 2008 |accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Executive (government)|Executive authority]] is vested in the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]] and is exercised by the [[Governor of the Falkland Islands|Governor]] on her behalf. The Governor is also responsible for the administration of [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands]], as these islands have no native inhabitants. The governor acts on the advice of the [[Executive Council of the Falkland Islands|Executive Council]], composed of himself as chairman, the [[Chief Executive of the Falkland Islands|Chief Executive]], [[Director of Finance of the Falkland Islands|Director of Finance]] and three elected Legislative Assembly Members.&lt;ref name = constitutiontext/&gt; The current Governor [[Nigel Haywood]] took office in October 2010.&lt;ref name=HaywoodGovernor&gt;{{cite web

The [[Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands|Legislative Assembly]] consists of the Chief Executive, Director of Finance and the eight members elected for four-year terms by [[universal suffrage]], of whom five are from [[Stanley, Falkland Islands|Stanley]] and three from [[Camp (Falkland Islands)|Camp]].&lt;ref name = constitutiontext/&gt; There are no political parties, and no formal opposition.

[[Justice]] is administered by a resident senior magistrate and a non-resident Chief Justice of the islands who visits the islands at least once a year. The senior magistrate handles petty criminal cases, civil, commercial, admiralty and family cases and is also the island's coroner. The Chief Justice handles serious criminal cases and hears appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.falklands.gov.fk/Government.html |publisher=Falkland Islands Government |title=Government |accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constitution binds the judiciary to comply with decisions of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] when hearing cases related to [[human rights]].&lt;ref name=constitutiontext/&gt;

Primary education is available at Stanley where there are boarding facilities, at [[RAF Mount Pleasant]] for children of service personnel and at a number of rural settlements where remote learning is supported by the Stanley based Camp Education Unit. The Islands' only secondary school is in Stanley and offers boarding facilities and 12 subjects to [[GCSE]] level. After 16, suitably qualified students may study at two colleges in England for their A-levels or for vocational qualifications. The government pays for older students to attend higher education, usually in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Geography==

[[File:Falkland Islands topographic map-en.svg|thumb|300px|Map of the Falkland Islands]]

The Falkland Islands are located in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]] on a projection of the Patagonian continental shelf about {{convert|250|nmi|mi km|0}} from the Patagonia coastline and slightly to the north of the southerly tip of [[Cape Horn]] and of its undersea extension, the [[Scotia Arc]]. In ancient geological time this shelf was part of [[Gondwana]], which around 400 million years ago broke from what is now Africa and drifted westwards relative to Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;epk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epd.gov.fk/wp-content/uploads/Falkland%20Islands%20State%20of%20the%20Environment%20Report%202008_final_sm.pdf |title=Falkland Islands State of the Environment Report 2008 |last1=Otley |first1=Helen |last2=Munro |first2=Grant |last3=Clausen |firs34=Andrea |last4=Ingham |first4=Becky |publisher=Environmental Planning Department Falkland Islands Government |date=May 2008 |accessdate=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Falklands, which have a total land area of 4,700 square miles (12,173&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and a [[coastline]] estimated at 800&amp;nbsp;miles (1288&amp;nbsp;km),&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; comprise two main islands, [[West Falkland]] and [[East Falkland]] and about 776 small islands.

The southern part of East Falkland, the Lafonia Peninsula, which is connected to the rest of the island by a 4&amp;nbsp;km narrow isthmus, is dissimilar to the rest of the island. Most of Lafonia is a flat plain underlain by younger [[Mesozoic]] rock, but in the north west is [[Permian]] rock which is similar to that of parts of Ecca Pass in South Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;seabirds&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Britlinks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britlink.org/eastfalkland.html |title=East Falkland Island |publisher=Britlink.org |accessdate=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weather conditions are known to be extremely changeable, with it not being unusual to face all four seasons in one afternoon.  The reason for this is the many wind directions resulting in many air masses mixing at the [[Drake Passage]], which is often an area of low pressures.

Whilst being located as far south as the [[U.K]] is north, the absence of a warming current like the [[Gulf Stream]] means temperatures are considerably colder than comparable areas in North West Europe.  Weather forecasts are given by a local branch of the UK's [[Met Office]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P3IIAx8hRnA&amp;list=PL2766F789289DB6CA&amp;index=6&amp;feature=plcp The Met Men of The Falkland Islands 13.06.12 – BFBS News]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gypsy-Cove.jpg|thumb|alt=Five penguins walking up a grassy slope against the wind|Penguins at [[Gypsy Cove]]]]
There are no native [[reptile]]s or [[amphibian]]s on the islands. Over 200 species of insects have been recorded, along with 43 [[spider]] species and 12 [[worm]] species. Only 13 terrestrial invertebrates are recognised as [[Endemism|endemic]], although information on many species is lacking and it is suspected up to two thirds of species found are actually endemic. Due to the island environment, many insect species have developed reduced or absent wings. There are around 129 freshwater invertebrates, the majority being [[rotifer]]; however, the identification of some species remains in dispute.&lt;ref name=&quot;epk&quot;/&gt; Six species of fish are found in freshwater areas, including [[zebra trout]] and [[falklands minnow]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;epk&quot;/&gt; Different species of [[krill]] are found in Falkland waters, with [[Lobster Krill]] inhabiting the warmer waters in the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;seabirds&quot;/&gt;

There are no native tree species on the archipelago, although two species of bushes, [[Chiliotrichum diffusum|fachine]] and [[Hebe elliptica|native box]] are found. Other vegetation consists of [[grass]]es and [[fern]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Backgroundgeography&quot;/&gt; Around 363 species of [[vascular plant]]s, 21 species of [[fern]]s and [[clubmoss]]es and 278 species of [[flowering plant]]s have been recorded on the islands. Of the vascular plants, 171 are believed to be native and 13 to be endemic.&lt;ref name=&quot;epk&quot;/&gt; Some [[bog]]s and [[fen]]s exist and support some freshwater plant species, but these are not common on the islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;seabirds&quot;/&gt; [[Tussac grass]], which averages {{convert|2|m|ft|1|abbr=on|1}} in height but can reach up to {{convert|4|m|ft|0|abbr=on|0}}, is found within 300&amp;nbsp;m (1,000&amp;nbsp;ft) of the coast where it forms bands around larger islands.

There is little long-term data on habitat changes, so the extent of human impact is unclear.&lt;ref name=&quot;epk&quot;/&gt; Vegetation such as tussac grass, fachine, and native box have been heavily impacted by introduced grazing animals. Many breeding birds similarly only live on offshore islands, where introduced animals such as cats and rats are not found.&lt;ref name=&quot;seabirds&quot;/&gt; Virtually the entire area of the islands is used as [[pasture]] for [[domestic sheep|sheep]]. There is also an introduced [[reindeer]] population, which was brought to the islands in 2001 for commercial purposes.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; Rats&lt;ref name=&quot;Britlinks&quot;/&gt; and [[Grey fox]]es have been introduced and are having a detrimental impact on birds that nest on the shores, as are [[feral cat]]s. 22 introduced plant species are thought to provide a significant threat to local flora.&lt;ref name=&quot;epk&quot;/&gt;

==Demographics==
{{See also|Falkland Islanders|Origins of Falkland Islanders}}
[[File:WhaleboneArchCathedral.JPG|thumb|[[Christ Church Cathedral (Falkland Islands)|Christ Church Cathedral]] with an arch made of whale bone, Stanley]]
The population of the Falkland Islands is primarily of British descent (about 70 percent of the population), mainly as a result of [[Scottish people|Scottish]] and [[Welsh people|Welsh]] immigration to the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Patrick|last=Vincent|title=The Geographical Journal, Vol. 149, No. 1, pp 16–17|month=March | year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2006 census, some Islanders identified themselves as of [[French people|French]], [[Gibraltarian people|Gibraltarian]], and [[Scandinavia]]n descent.&lt;ref name=2006Census&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.falklands.gov.fk/documents/Census%20Report%202006.pdf|title=Falkland Islands Census Statistics, 2006|publisher=Falkland Islands Government|accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other minorities include those from [[Chile]] and [[Saint Helena]], many of whom have become assimilated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6683677.stm |title=Falklands questions answered |publisher=BBC News |date=4 June 2007 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the few Argentines currently residing in the islands is Maria Strange, wife of the author and historian [[Ian Strange]].&lt;ref name='telegraph 2010-02-28'&gt;{{cite news | first = Tom | last = Leonard | title = 'We must educate the Argentines' | date = 28 February 2010 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/falklandislands/7332262/We-must-educate-the-Argentines.html | work = The Telegraph | accessdate =8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents of the Falklands are often called &quot;[[Kelpers]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tweedie&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/falklandislands/9176205/How-the-good-life-came-to-the-Kelpers.html |title=How the good life came to the Kelpers |last=Tweedie |first=Neil |newspaper=The Telegraph |date=31 March 2012 |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;Islanders&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falklands.gov.fk//Falklands_Life.html |title=People |publisher=Falkland Islands Government |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal term for having the right of residence is &quot;belonging to the islands&quot;.&lt;ref name = constitutiontext/&gt; From 1 January 1983, as provided in the [[British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983]], the islanders have been full [[British nationality law|British citizens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1983/6 |title=British Nationality (Falkland Islands) Act 1983 |publisher=The National Archives |accessdate=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A population decline leading up to the Falklands War has reversed, with the population bolstered by immigration from the British island of Saint Helena, and Chile&lt;ref name=&quot;Tweedie&quot;/&gt; though figures for immigration are skewed by including children born to Falkland Islander women who for medical reasons travelled abroad for their confinement as being &quot;born abroad&quot;.&lt;ref name=2006Census/&gt; Historical census figures show that the population rose from an estimate of 287 in 1851 to 2,272 in 1911. The population was 2,094 in 1921 and 2,392 in 1931, but it then declined to 1,813 in 1980.&lt;ref name=2006Census/&gt; However, the population recorded in the 2001 census was higher than at any previous point in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.falklands.info/background/census2001r.html |title=Summary Report |publisher=Falklands.info |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The population later rose to 2,955 (2006 census). The 2006 census recorded 2,115 people in Stanley and 477 in Mount Pleasant, 194 in the rest of East Falkland, 127 in West Falkland and 42 people in all the other islands. These figures exclude all military personnel and their families, but include 477 people who were present in the Falkland Islands in connection with the military garrison.&lt;ref name=&quot;2006Census&quot;/&gt;

The age distribution of the islands residents is skewed towards people of working age {{nowrap|(20–60)}} – 65% as opposed to 21% aged below 20 and 14% aged above 60. Males outnumber females by 53% to 47% with the deviation being most prominent in the {{nowrap|20–60}} age group.&lt;ref name=2006Census/&gt; In the 2006 census, 67.2% of the islanders identified themselves as being [[Christian]]s, 31.5% either declined to answer or had no religious affiliation and the remaining 1.3% (39 individuals) identified themselves as adherents of other faiths.&lt;ref name=2006Census/&gt; The islands have three churches, one for each of the [[Church of England]], [[Roman Catholic]] and [[United Free Church]] communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Media===
The islands have two weekly newspapers – ''The Penguin News'', published by Mercopress and the ''Teaberry Express'' published by Falkland Islands News Network.&lt;ref name=pressreference&gt;{{cite web

Falkland Islands technical standards for radio and television are identical to those in the United Kingdom or, in the case of [[Medium Wave]] broadcasts, the Americas. There are approximately 1000 television sets and 1000 radio receivers on the islands.&lt;ref name=pressreference/&gt; Two terrestrial television channels are broadcast by the [[British Forces Broadcasting Service#Television|British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS)]] while [[KTV Ltd.]] relay a number of satellite services such as [[BBC]], [[CNN]] via [[cable television|cable]] to subscribers in Stanley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher = KTV Ltd.
|accessdate =4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Radio broadcasting is supported by seven FM radio stations and one AM radio station. The first broadcasting service, the Falkland Islands Broadcasting Service, established in 1929 used landlines connected to a speaker in people's homes. This was upgraded to wireless in 1942 and a 5&amp;nbsp;kW medium wave transmitter installed in 1954. VHF was introduced in 1999. In 2005 the service was privatised and renamed [[Falkland Islands Radio Service]] (FIRS).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Telephone===
The first telephones in the Falklands were installed by the Falkland Island Company in 1880, with lines to all settlements in Camp being installed by 1907. In 1911, Marconi built a telegraph office that permitted telegrams to be sent to [[Montevideo]]. In 1950, the fixed line telephone service to Camp was replaced by a radio service;&lt;ref name=C&amp;WHistory&gt;{{cite web

The [[Royal Air Force]] operates flights from [[RAF Mount Pleasant]] to [[RAF Brize Norton]] in Oxfordshire, England, with a refuelling stop at [[RAF Ascension Island]]. RAF flights are on [[Lockheed TriStar (RAF)|TriStars]] although charter aircraft are often used if the TriStars are required for operational flights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.mercopress.com/2010/01/27/air-seychelles-begins-operating-brize-norton-falklands-air-bridge |title=Air Seychelles begins operating Brize Norton-Falklands Air Bridge |publisher=MercoPress |date=28 January 2011 |accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local military air support – moving of personnel, equipment and supplies around the islands is carried out under contract by [[British International Helicopters|British International (BRINTEL)]] who operate two [[H-3 Sea King|Sikorsky S61N]] helicopters. The principal civilian air operator at Mount Pleasant is [[LAN (airline)|LAN Airlines]] who operate weekly flights to [[Santiago, Chile]] via [[Punta Arenas]] with an additional stop once a month at [[Río Gallegos]], Argentina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xtold.visitorfalklands.com/content/view/186/175/ |title=Official Tourism Website of the Falkland Islands |publisher=Xtold.visitorfalklands.com |date=18 August 2009 |accessdate=9 June 2010}}{{Dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main operator at Port Stanley Airport is the [[Falkland Islands Government Air Service]] (FIGAS) that operates [[Britten-Norman Islander|Islander]] aircraft which can use the grass airstrips at most settlements. Flight schedules, which are broadcast on the radio every evening, are planned on a daily basis according to passenger needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
