Puerto Rico (Spanish for &quot;rich port&quot;) comprises an [[archipelago]] that includes the main island of Puerto Rico and a number of smaller islands, the largest of which are [[Vieques, Puerto Rico|Vieques]], [[Culebra, Puerto Rico|Culebra]], and [[Mona, Puerto Rico|Mona]]. The main island of Puerto Rico is the smallest by land area of the [[Greater Antilles]]. However, it ranks third in population among that group of four islands, which also include [[Cuba]], [[Hispaniola]] (Dominican Republic and [[Haiti]]), and [[Jamaica]]. Due to its location, Puerto Rico enjoys a tropical climate and also experiences the Atlantic [[hurricane]] season.

Originally populated for centuries by indigenous [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|aboriginal]] peoples known as [[Taíno people|Taíno]]s, the island was claimed by [[Christopher Columbus]] for Spain during his second voyage to the Americas on November 19, 1493. Under Spanish rule, the island was colonized and the indigenous population was forced into [[slavery]] and nearly wiped out due to, among other things, European infectious diseases. The remaining population was emancipated by [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I]] in 1520. Spain possessed Puerto Rico for over 400 years, despite attempts at capture of the island by the French, Dutch, and British. The Spanish Crown, in an attempt to keep Puerto Rico from gaining its independence, revived the [[Royal Decree of Graces of 1815]]. The decree was printed in three languages &amp;mdash; [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] &amp;mdash; and it fostered the immigration of hundreds of non-Spanish European families.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graces&quot;&gt;[http://www.ensayistas.org/antologia/XIXE/castelar/esclavitud/cedula.htm   Real Cédula de 1789 &quot;para el comercio de Negros&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Puerto Rico and the United States dates back to the [[Spanish-American War]], in which Spain, under the terms of the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris of 1898]], ceded the island to the United States. Puerto Ricans became U.S. citizens in 1917, and the [[United States Congress]] legislates many aspects of Puerto Rican life.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ayINMX_RtkEC&amp;pg=PA167# |title=The Louisiana Purchase and American Expansion, 1803–1898.

Its official languages are Spanish and English, with Spanish being the primary language. The island's current [[Political status of Puerto Rico|political status]], including the possibility of [[U.S. state|statehood]] or [[Puerto Rican independence movement|independence]], is widely debated in Puerto Rico.  A [[Puerto Rican status referendum, 2012|referendum]] on statehood, independence, or continuance of the status quo will be held on November 6, 2012.

== Name ==
[[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Ricans]] often call the island ''Borinquen'', from ''Borikén'', its [[Indigenous peoples|indigenous]] Taíno name, which means &quot;Land of the Valiant Lord&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Allatson, Paul.

The island is also popularly known in Spanish as ''la isla del encanto'', meaning &quot;the island of enchantment&quot;.

Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista, in honor of Saint [[John the Baptist]]. Eventually, traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as &quot;Puerto Rico&quot;, and &quot;San Juan&quot; became the name of the main trading/shipping port.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Puerto Rico}}

=== Pre-Columbian era ===
The ancient history of the archipelago known today as Puerto Rico before the arrival of Columbus is not well known. Unlike other larger more advanced indigenous communities in the New World ([[Aztec]], [[Inca]]) that left behind abundant archeological and physical evidence of their societies, the indigenous population of Puerto Rico left scant records. What is known today about them comes from scarce archaeological findings and early Spanish scholarly accounts. Today, there are few and rare cave drawings, rock carvings and ancient recreational activity sites that have been identified with some degree of speculation as to who left them behind. The first comprehensive book on the history of Puerto Rico was written by [[Fray Íñigo Abbad y Lasierra]] in 1786, almost three centuries after the first Spaniards arrived on the island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Abbad y Lasierra |first=Iñigo |title=Historia Geográfica, Civil y Natural de la Isla de San Juan Bautista de Puerto Rico}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Taino Village.JPG|thumb|left|Taíno Village at the [[Tibes Indigenous Ceremonial Center|Tibes Ceremonial Center]]]]
The first settlers were the [[Ortoiroid people]], an [[Archaic period in the Americas|Archaic Period]] culture of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Amerindian]] hunters and fishermen. An archaeological dig in the island of Vieques in 1990 found the remains of what is believed to be an ''Arcaico'' (Archaic) man (named &quot;Puerto Ferro Man&quot;) dated to around 2000&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mahaffy, Cheryl|title = Vieques Island – What lies beneath|date = January 28, 2006|publisher=Edmonton Journal|url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/travel/story.html?id=eb3c0119-8328-4b52-96ed-4a63763160f7|accessdate=February 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Igneri]], a tribe from the region of the [[Orinoco]] river, in northern South America, arrived between 120 and 400&amp;nbsp;CE. The Arcaicos and Igneri co-existed on the island between the 4th and 10th centuries, and perhaps clashed.

Between the 7th and 11th centuries the Taíno culture developed on the island, and by approximately 1000&amp;nbsp;CE had become dominant. At the time of Columbus' arrival, an estimated 30 to 60 thousand Taíno Amerindians, led by ''[[cacique]]'' (chief) [[Agüeybaná (The Great Sun)|Agüeybaná]], inhabited the island. They called it Boriken, &quot;the great land of the valiant and noble Lord&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pedro Torres|work=Taíno Inter-Tribal Council Inc.|title=The Dictionary of the Taíno Language|url=http://members.dandy.net/~orocobix/tedict.html|accessdate=February 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The natives lived in small villages led by a cacique and subsisted on hunting, fishing and gathering of indigenous [[cassava]] root and fruit. This lasted until Columbus arrived in 1493.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.canada.com/edmontonjournal/news/travel/story.html?id=eb3c0119-8328-4b52-96ed-4a63763160f7 |title=Vieques Island: What lies beneath |author=Cheryl Mahaffy |date=January 30, 2006 |publisher=Edmonton Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newberry.org/exhibits/PuertoRico.html |title=500 Years of Puerto Rican History through the Eyes of Others|publisher=The Newberry library - Newberry.org |date=2008-07-12 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Puerto Rican culture today exhibits many Taíno influences within its music and vocabulary.

When Columbus arrived in Puerto Rico during his second voyage on {{Nowrap|November 19}}, 1493, the island was inhabited by the Taínos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://welcome.topuertorico.org/history.shtml |title=History of Puerto Rico |accessdate=November 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They called it &quot;Borikén&quot;, or &quot;Borinquen&quot;.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Today, Puerto Ricans are also known as Boricuas, or people from Borinquen.&lt;/ref&gt; Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista, in honor of Saint [[John the Baptist]]. The first Spanish settlement, [[Caparra]], was founded on August 8, 1508 by [[Juan Ponce de León]], a [[lieutenant]] under Columbus, who later became the [[List of Governors of Puerto Rico|first governor]] of the island.&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Vicente Yañez Pinzón]] is considered the first appointed governor of Puerto Rico, but he never arrived on the island.&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico, and San Juan became the name of the main trading/shipping port. According to the &quot;500TH Florida Discovery Council Round Table&quot;, on March 3, 1513, Juan Ponce de Leon, organized and commenced an expedition (with a Crew of 200-including Women and Free Blacks) departing from &quot;[[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Punta Aguada]]&quot; Puerto Rico. Puerto Rico was the historic 1st gateway to the discovery of Florida which opened the doors to the advanced settlement of the USA. They introduced Christianity, Cattle, Horses, Sheep, the Spanish language and more to the land (Florida) that later became the United States of America, 107 years before the Pilgrims landed.&lt;ref&gt; PROCLAMATION precented by Dennis O.

The [[Spanish people|Spaniards]] began to colonize the island.

In 1520, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles I of Spain]] issued a royal decree collectively emancipating the remaining Taíno population. Essentially, the Taíno presence while not completely extinct had almost vanished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/gsp/colonial/puerto-rico/index.html |title=Puerto Rico &amp;#124; Colonial Genocides &amp;#124; Genocide Studies Program  |publisher=Yale University|date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The importation of Sub-Saharan African slaves was introduced to provide the new manual work force for the Spanish colonists and merchants. Following the decline of the Taíno population, more slaves were brought to Puerto Rico; however, the number of slaves on the island paled in comparison to those in neighboring islands.&lt;ref name=Dietz&gt;Dietz, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; African slavery was primarily restricted to coastal ports and cities, while the interior of the island continued to be essentially unexplored and undeveloped. Spanish and other European colonists were concentrated in island's seaports. Puerto Rico soon became an important stronghold and a significant port for Spanish Main colonial expansion. Various forts and walls, such as [[La Fortaleza]], [[Fort San Felipe del Morro|El Castillo San Felipe del Morro]] and [[Fort San Cristóbal|El Castillo de San Cristóbal]], were built to protect the strategic port of San Juan from numerous European invasion attempts. San Juan served as an important port-of-call for ships of all European nations for purposes of taking on water, food and other commercial provisions and mercantile exchange.

In 1607, Puerto Rico served as a port provisioning the English ships ''Godspeed'', ''Susan Constant'' and ''Discovery'', which were on their way to establish [[Jamestown, Virginia]], the first successful English settlement in the New World. The Netherlands and England made several attempts to capture Puerto Rico but failed to wrest it from the long-term possession by Spain, which held tenaciously onto its increasingly prized island colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=July 20, 2004|title=The Life of Sir Francis Drake|url=http://www.drakenavigatorsguild.org/drakeslife.html|accessdate=March 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;''Historias de Puerto Rico'' by Paul G. Miller, (1947) pp. 221–237.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 17th and early 18th centuries, Spanish colonial emphasis continued to be focussed on the more prosperous mainland North, Central, and South American colonies. This continued distraction on the part of the Spanish Crown left the island of Puerto Rico virtually unexplored, undeveloped, and (excepting coastal outposts) largely unsettled before the nineteenth century. But as independence movements in the larger Spanish colonies grew successful, Spain began to pay attention to Puerto Rico as one of its last remaining maritime colonies.  Amidst the attacks, Puerto Rican culture began to flourish. In 1786, the first comprehensive history of Puerto Rico—''Historia Geográfica, Civil y Política de Puerto Rico'' by [[Fray Iñigo Abbad y Lasierra]]—was published in [[Madrid]], documenting the history of Puerto Rico from the time of Columbus' landing in 1493 until 1783.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Abbad y Lasierra| first = Iñigo| title = Historia Geográfica, Civil y Política de Puerto Rico| isbn = 0-8477-0800-4| publisher=Univ Of Puerto Rico Pr| location = S.l.}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book also presents a first-hand account of Puerto Rican identity, including music, clothing, personality and nationality.

In 1779, citizens of the still-Spanish colony of Puerto Rico fought in the [[American Revolutionary War]] under the command of [[Bernardo de Gálvez]], named [[Field Marshal]] of the Spanish colonial army in North America. Puerto Ricans participated in the capture of [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], the capital of the British colony of [[West Florida]], and the cities of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]]. The Puerto Rican troops, under the leadership of Brigadier General Ramón de Castro,&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Thomas Ellingwood Fortin, producer, New Albion Pictures&lt;/ref&gt; helped defeat the British and Indian army of 2,500 soldiers and British warships in Pensacola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecajuns.com/galvezrw.htm |title=Words from Pres. Ronald Reagan |publisher=Thecajuns.com |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1809, in a further move to secure its political bond with the island and in the midst of the European [[Peninsular War]], the [[Junta (Peninsular War)|Supreme Central Junta]] based in [[Cádiz]] recognized Puerto Rico as an overseas province of Spain with the right to send representatives to the recently convened [[Cádiz Cortes|Spanish parliament]] with equal representation to Mainland Iberian, Mediterranean (Balearic Islands) and Atlantic maritime Spanish provinces (Canary Islands). The first Spanish parliamentary representative from the island of Puerto Rico, [[Ramon Power y Giralt]], died after serving a three-year term in the Cortes. These [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|parliamentary and constitutional reforms]], which were in force from 1810 to 1814 and again from 1820 to 1823, were reversed twice afterwards when the traditional monarchy was restored by [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand&amp;nbsp;VII]]. Nineteenth-century immigration and commercial trade reforms further augmented the island's European population and economy, and expanded Spanish cultural and social imprint on the local character of the island.
[[Image:Real Cédula de Gracia.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Royal Decree of Graces, 1815, which allowed foreigners to enter Puerto Rico]]
Minor slave revolts had occurred in the island during this period; however, the revolt planned and organized by [[Marcos Xiorro]] in 1821, was the most important. Even though the conspiracy was unsuccessful, Xiorro achieved legendary status and is part of Puerto Rico's folklore.&lt;ref name=&quot;GB&quot;&gt;Guillermo A. Baralt, ''Slave revolts in Puerto Rico: conspiracies and uprisings, 1795-1873''; Markus Wiener Publishers. ISBN 1-55876-463-1, ISBN 978-1-55876-463-7&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 19th century, Puerto Rico had an Independence movement which, due to the harsh persecution by the Spanish authorities, met in the island of St. Thomas. The movement was largely inspired by the ideals of [[Simón Bolívar]] of establishing a [[United Provinces of New Granada]] which included Puerto Rico and Cuba. Among the influential members of this movement was Brigadier General [[Antonio Valero de Bernabe]], a Puerto Rican military leader known in Latin America as the &quot;Liberator from Puerto Rico&quot; who fought alongside Bolivar and [[María de las Mercedes Barbudo]], a businesswoman also known as the &quot;first Puerto Rican female freedom fighter&quot;. The movement was discovered and Governor [[Miguel de la Torre]] had its members imprisoned or exiled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.raquelrosario.net/Historias%20Claridad%20Mercedes%20Bar.pdf |title=María de las Mercedes Barbudo; Primera mujer independentista de Puerto Rico; CLARIDAD; December 1994; p. 19 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the increasingly rapid growth of independent former Spanish colonies in the South and Central American states in the first part of the century, Puerto Rico and Cuba continued to grow in strategic importance to the Spanish Crown. In a very deliberate move to increase its hold on its last two new world colonies, the Spanish Crown revived the [[Royal Decree of Graces of 1815]]. This time the decree was printed in three languages: Spanish, English and French. Its primary intent was to attract Europeans of who were not of Spanish origin, with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity and strength with increase of new loyalist settlers with strong sympathies to Spain. As a consequence, hundreds of families, mainly from [[Corsican immigration to Puerto Rico|Corsica]], [[French immigration to Puerto Rico|France]], [[German immigration to Puerto Rico|Germany]], [[Irish immigration to Puerto Rico|Ireland]], [[Italy]] and [[Scotland]], immigrated to the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graces&quot;/&gt; 

In 1858, [[Samuel Morse]] introduced wired communication to [[Latin America]] when he established a telegraph system in Puerto Rico. Morse's oldest daughter, Susan Walker Morse (1821–1885), would often visit her uncle Charles Pickering Walker, who owned the Hacienda Concordia in the town of [[Guayama, Puerto Rico|Guayama]]. Morse often spent winters at the Hacienda with his daughter and son-in-law, who lived and owned the Habienda Henriqueta, and he set a two-mile telegraph line connecting his son-in-law's hacienda to their house in Arroyo. The line was inaugurated on March 1, 1859 in a ceremony flanked by the Spanish and American flags.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elboricua.com/MiradorPuertorriquenoArchives.html |title=150th.

When you are linked with the other jewels of the Antilles in the necklace of the world's telegraph, yours will not shine less brilliantly in the crown of your Queen!&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As an incentive to immigrate and colonize, free land was offered to those who wanted to populate the two islands on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref name=&quot;Graces&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensayistas.org/antologia/XIXE/castelar/esclavitud/cedula.htm |title=Real Cédula de 1789 &quot;para el comercio de Negros&quot; |language={{es icon}} |publisher=Ensayistas.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was very successful and European immigration continued even after 1898. Puerto Rico today still receives Spanish and European immigration.
[[File:LARESFLAG2.jpg|thumb|left|The Original Lares Revolutionary Flag]]
Poverty and political estrangement with Spain led to a small but significant uprising in 1868 known as &quot;[[Grito de Lares]].&quot; It began in the rural town of Lares, but was subdued when rebels moved to the neighboring town of San Sebastián. Leaders of this independence movement included [[Ramón Emeterio Betances]], considered the &quot;father&quot; of the Puerto Rican independence movement, and other political figures such as [[Segundo Ruiz Belvis]].

[[File:Intentona de Yauco.jpg|right|thumb|Flag flown by Fidel Vélez and his men during the &quot;Intentona de Yauco&quot; revolt]]
Leaders of &quot;El Grito de Lares&quot;, who were in exile in New York City, joined the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee, founded on December 8, 1895, and continued their quest for Puerto Rican independence. In 1897, [[Antonio Mattei Lluberas]] and the local leaders of the independence movement of the town of Yauco organized another uprising, which became known as the &quot;[[Intentona de Yauco]]&quot;. This was the first time that the current Puerto Rican flag was unfurled on Puerto Rican soil. The local conservative political factions, which believed that such an attempt would be a threat to their struggle for (colonial) autonomy, opposed such an action. Rumors of the planned event spread to the local Spanish authorities who acted swiftly and put an end to what would be the last major uprising in the island to Spanish colonial rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;HMPR&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

In 1897, [[Luis Muñoz Rivera]] and others persuaded the liberal Spanish government to agree to Charters of Autonomy for Cuba and Puerto Rico. In 1898, Puerto Rico's first, but short-lived, autonomous government was organized as an &quot;overseas province&quot; of Spain. This bilaterally agreed-upon charter maintained a governor appointed by Spain, which held the power to annul any legislative decision, and a partially elected parliamentary structure. In February, Governor-General [[Manuel Macías y Casado|Manuel Macías]] inaugurated the new government under the Autonomous Charter. General elections were held in March and the autonomous government began to function on {{Nowrap|July 17}}, 1898.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.solboricua.com/history2.htm#usa |title=USA Seizes Puerto Rico |year=2000 |work=History of Puerto Rico |publisher=solboricua.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.topuertorico.org/history4.shtml |title=History |accessdate=October 1, 2007 |author=Magaly Rivera |publisher=topuertorico.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/1898/chronpr.html |title=Chronology of Puerto Rico in the Spanish-American War |work=The World of 1898: The Spanish-American War |publisher=Hispanic Division, Library of Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, Captain [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]], a member of the Navy War Board and leading U.S. strategic thinker, wrote a book titled ''[[The Influence of Sea Power upon History]]'' in which he argued for the creation of a large and powerful navy modeled after the British Royal Navy. Part of his strategy called for the acquisition of colonies in the [[Caribbean Sea]] which would serve as coaling and naval stations and which would serve as strategical points of defense upon the construction of a canal in the [[Isthmus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SP&quot;&gt;Jorge Rodriguez Beruff, ''Strategy as Politics'', Universidad de Puerto Rico: La Editorial; p. 7; ISBN 978-0-8477-0160-5&lt;/ref&gt;

This idea was not new, since [[William H. Seward]], the former Secretary of State under the administrations of various presidents, among them [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Ulysses Grant]], had stressed that a canal be built either in [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]] or [[Panama]] and that the United States annex the Dominican Republic and purchase Puerto Rico and Cuba. The idea of annexing the Dominican Republic failed to receive the approval of the U.S. Senate and Spain did not accept the {{Nowrap|160 million}} dollars that the U.S. offered for Puerto Rico and Cuba.&lt;ref name=&quot;SP&quot;/&gt;

Captain Mahan made the following statement to the War Department: &lt;blockquote&gt;Having therefore no foreign establishments either colonial or military, the ships of war of the United States, in war will be like land birds, unable to fly far from their own shores. To provide resting places for them where they can coal and repair, would be one of the first duties of a government proposing to itself the development of the power of the nation at sea&lt;ref&gt;A. T. Mahan, ''The Influence of Sea Power upon History (1660–1783)'', London: Sampson Low, Marston, Seale; p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since 1894, the [[Naval War College]] had been formulating [[contingency plan]]s for a war with Spain. By 1896, the Office of Naval Intelligence had prepared a plan which included military operations in Puerto Rican waters. This prewar planning did not contemplate major territorial acquisitions. Except for one 1895 plan which recommended annexation of the island then named ''Isle of Pines'' (later renamed as [[Isla de la Juventud]]), a recommendation dropped in later planning, plans developed for attacks on Spanish territories were intended as support operations against Spain's forces in and around Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=2f0Gf0DQfmUC&amp;pg=PA72 |title=David F.

On July 25, 1898, during the [[Spanish-American War]], Puerto Rico was invaded by the United States with a landing at [[Guánica, Puerto Rico|Guánica]]. As an outcome of the war, Spain ceded Puerto Rico, along with the [[Philippines]] and [[Guam]], that were under Spanish sovereignty, to the U.S. under the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]]. Spain relinquished sovereignty over Cuba, but did not cede it to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/19th_century/sp1898.asp |title=Treaty of Peace Between the United States and Spain |date=December 10, 1898 |work=The Avalon Project at the Yale Law School |publisher=Yale Law School, Lillian Goldman Law Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States and Puerto Rico thus began a long-standing relationship. Puerto Rico began the 20th century under the military rule of the U.S. with officials, including the governor, appointed by the [[President of the United States]]. The [[Foraker Act]] of 1900 gave Puerto Rico a certain amount of civilian popular government, including a popularly elected House of Representatives, also a judicial system following the [[Law of the United States|American legal system]] that includes both [[State court (United States)|state courts]] and [[United States federal courts|federal courts]] establishing a Puerto Rico Supreme Court and a [[United States territorial court|United State District Court]]; and a non-voting member of Congress, by the title of &quot;Resident Commissioner&quot;. In addition, this Act extended all U.S. laws &quot;not locally inapplicable&quot; to Puerto Rico, specifying specific exemption from U.S. Internal Revenue laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;status&quot;/&gt; The act empowered the civil government to legislate on &quot;all matters of legislative character not locally inapplicable&quot;, including the power to modify and repeal any laws then in existence in Puerto Rico, though the U.S. Congress retained the power to annul acts of the Puerto Rico legislature.&lt;ref name=&quot;status&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Efrén Rivera Ramos|title=American Colonialism in Puerto Rico: The Judicial and Social Legacy|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=J5l55R3_mPoC|year=2007|publisher=Markus Wiener Publishers|isbn=978-1-55876-410-1|pages=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=J5l55R3_mPoC&amp;pg=PA54 54–55]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During an address to the Puerto Rican legislature in 1906, President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] recommended that Puerto Ricans become U.S. citizens.&lt;ref name=&quot;status&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Porto Rico En Fete: President's Auto Tour Amid Shower of Roses: He Promises Citizenship |work= The Washington Post |page= 1 |date= November 22, 1906 |url= http://search.proquest.com/docview/144628701/137535EE2B32E7AAC9B/1?accountid=46320 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, Puerto Ricans were made U.S. citizens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Louisiana Purchase and American Expansion: 1803–1898 |first1= Sanford |last1= Levinson |first2= Bartholomew H. |last2= Sparrow |location= New York |publisher= Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers |year= 2005 |pages= 166, 178. |quote= U.S. citizenship was extended to residents of Puerto Rico by virtue of the Jones Act, chap. 190, 39 Stat. 951 (1971)(codified at 48 U.S.C. § 731 (1987) }}&lt;/ref&gt; via the [[Jones-Shafroth Act|Jones Act]]. The same Act also provided for a popularly elected Senate to complete a bicameral Legislative Assembly, a [[bill of rights]] and authorized the election of a Resident Commissioner to a four-year term. As a result of their new U.S. citizenship, many Puerto Ricans were drafted into [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]] and all subsequent wars with U.S. participation in which a national military draft was in effect.

The internal governance changed during the latter years of the [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]]–[[Harry S.

In 1947, the U.S. granted Puerto Ricans the right to elect democratically their own [[governor of Puerto Rico|governor]]. [[Luis Muñoz Marín]] was elected during the 1948 general elections, becoming the first popularly elected governor of Puerto Rico. 

A Bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and nationalist movements in the island. The Senate at the time was controlled by the PPD, and was presided over by Luis Muñoz Marín.&lt;ref&gt;[http://academiajurisprudenciapr.org/en/revistas/volumen-vii/ &quot;La obra jurídica del Profesor David M. Helfeld (1948-2008)'; by: Dr. Carmelo Delgado Cintrón]&lt;/ref&gt; The Bill, also known as the [[Puerto Rico's Gag Law|Gag Law]] (''Ley de la Mordaza'' in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) was approved by the legislature on May 21, 1948. It made it illegal to display a Puerto Rican flag, to sing a patriotic tune, to talk of independence, or to fight for the liberation of the island. The Bill, which resembled the anti-communist [[Smith Act|Smith Law]] passed in the United States, was signed and made into law on June 10, 1948, by the U.S. appointed governor of Puerto Rico, [[Jesús T.

Anyone accused and found guilty of disobeying the law could be sentenced to ten years of prison, be fined $10,000 dollars (US), or both. According to Dr. [[Leopoldo Figueroa]], a member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, the law was repressive, and was in violation of the First Amendment of the [[US Constitution]], which guarantees [[Freedom of Speech]]. He pointed out that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico.

On October 30, 1950, [[Pedro Albizu Campos]] and other nationalists led a 3-day revolt against the United States in various cities and towns of Puerto Rico in what is known as the [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s]]. The most notable occurred in [[Jayuya]] and [[Utuado]]. In the Jayuya revolt, known as the [[Jayuya Uprising]], the United States declared [[martial law]], and attacked Jayuya with infantry, artillery and bombers. The [[Utuado Uprising]] culminated in what is known as the Utuado massacre. On {{Nowrap|November 1}}, 1950, Puerto Rican nationalists [[Griselio Torresola]] and [[Oscar Collazo]] [[Truman assassination attempt|attempted to assassinate]] President [[Harry S Truman]]. Torresola was killed during the attack, but Collazo was captured. Collazo served 29 years in a federal prison, being released in 1979. Don Pedro Albizu Campos also served many years in a federal prison in [[Atlanta, Georgia]], for seditious conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. government in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = García |first = Marvin |url = http://www.nl.edu/academics/cas/ace/resources/campos.cfm |title = Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos|publisher=National-Louis University |accessdate =April 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of Puerto Rico]] was approved by a Constitutional Convention on {{Nowrap|February 6}}, 1952, ratified by the U.S. Congress, approved by President Truman on {{Nowrap|July 3}} of that year, and proclaimed by Gov. Muñoz Marín on {{Nowrap|July 25}}, 1952, on the anniversary of the {{Nowrap|July 25}}, 1898, landing of U.S. troops in the [[Puerto Rican Campaign]] of the [[Spanish-American War]], until then an annual Puerto Rico holiday. Puerto Rico adopted the name of ''Estado Libre Asociado'' (literally &quot;Free Associated State&quot;, officially translated into English as [[Commonwealth (United States insular area)|Commonwealth]]), for its [[body politic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lexjuris.com/lexprcont.htm |title=Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico – in Spanish |publisher=Lexjuris.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://topuertorico.org/constitu.shtml |title=Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico – (English translation) |publisher=Topuertorico.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Congress legislates over many fundamental aspects of Puerto Rican life, including citizenship, currency, postal service, [[foreign affairs]], military defense, communications, [[labor relations]], the environment, commerce, finance, health and welfare, and many others.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CRS RL32933&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL32933.pdf |title = Political Status of Puerto Rico: Options for Congress |accessdate =December 3, 2009 |date=April 23, 2010 |author=Keith Bea |author2=R.

During the 1950s, Puerto Rico experienced rapid industrialization, due in large part to ''Operación Manos a la Obra'' (&quot;[[Operation Bootstrap]]&quot;), an offshoot of FDR's New Deal, which aimed to transform Puerto Rico's economy from agriculture-based to manufacturing-based. Presently, Puerto Rico has become a major tourist destination, as well as a global center for pharmaceutical manufacturing.&lt;ref name=pharma&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pharmaceuticalonline.com/article.mvc/Puerto-Ricos-Pharmaceutical-Industry-40-Years-0003|title=Puerto Rico's Pharmaceutical Industry|date=September 20, 2006|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet it still struggles to define its political status. Three plebiscites have been held in recent decades to resolve the political status, but no changes have been attained. Support for the pro-statehood party, [[Partido Nuevo Progresista]] (PNP), and the pro-commonwealth party, [[Partido Popular Democrático]] (PPD), remains about equal. The only registered pro-independence party, the [[Puerto Rican Independence Party|Partido Independentista Puertorriqueño]] (PIP), usually receives 3–5% of the electoral votes.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

The government of Puerto Rico, based on the formal [[Republicanism in the United States|republican system]], is composed of three branches: executive, legislative, and judicial. The [[executive branch]] is headed by the [[Governor of Puerto Rico|Governor]], currently [[Luis Fortuño]]. The [[legislative branch]] consists of a [[bicameral]] [[Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico|Legislative Assembly]] made up of a [[Senate of Puerto Rico|Senate]] upper chamber and a [[House of Representatives of Puerto Rico|House of Representatives]] lower chamber. The Senate is headed by the President of the Senate, while the House of Representatives is headed by the Speaker of the House.

The [[judicial branch]] is headed by the Chief Justice of the [[Supreme Court of Puerto Rico]]. The legal system is a mix of the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and the [[common law]] systems. The governor and legislators are elected by popular vote every four years. Members of the Judicial branch are appointed by the governor with the &quot;advice and consent&quot; of the Senate.

Puerto Rico is represented in the United States Congress by a nonvoting delegate, formally called a [[Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico|Resident Commissioner]] (currently [[Pedro Pierluisi]]). Current legislation has returned the Commissioner's power to vote in the [[Committee of the Whole (United States House of Representatives)|Committee of the Whole]], but not on matters where the vote would represent a decisive participation.&lt;ref name=&quot;rhg&quot;&gt;[http://www.rules.house.gov/ruleprec/110th.pdf Rules of the House of Representatives]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Puerto Rican elections are governed by the [[Federal Election Commission]] and the [[State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pages/report_notices/State_Notices/prprim.shtml |title=Puerto Rico Primary Election Report Notice |publisher=Fec.gov |date=2008-02-02 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/2008pdates.pdf |title=2008 Presidential Primary Dates and Candidates Filling Datelines for Ballot Access |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; While residing in Puerto Rico, Puerto Ricans cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, but they can vote in [[US Presidential Primary|primaries]]. Puerto Ricans who become residents of a [[U.S. state]] can vote in presidential elections.

Puerto Rico is not an independent country and, as such, it hosts no [[Embassy|embassies]]. It is host, however, to [[Consul (representative)|consulates]] from 41 countries, mainly from the [[Americas]] and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linktopr.com/consulados.html Consulados. ''Link to Puerto Rico''].{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most consulates are located in San Juan. As an unincorporated territory of the United States, Puerto Rico does not have any first-order administrative divisions as defined by the U.S. government, but has 78 [[municipalities]] at the second level. [[Mona Island]] is not a municipality, but part of the municipality of [[Mayagüez, Puerto Rico|Mayagüez]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enciclopediapr.org/ing/article.cfm?ref=08021702 |title=Mayagüez. Enciclopedia de Puerto Rico |publisher=Enciclopediapr.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Municipalities are subdivided into wards or [[barrio]]s, and those into sectors. Each municipality has a [[mayor]] and a municipal legislature elected for a four year term. The municipality of [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]] (previously called &quot;town&quot;), was founded first, in 1521, [[San Germán]] in 1570, [[Coamo]] in 1579, [[Arecibo]] in 1614, [[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Aguada]] in 1692 and [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] in 1692. An increase of settlement saw the founding of 30 municipalities in the 18th century and 34 in the 19th. Six were founded in the 20th century; the last was [[Florida, Puerto Rico|Florida]] in 1971.&lt;ref name='fundacion'&gt;[http://www.linktopr.com/fundacion.html LinktoPR.com – Fundación de los Pueblos].{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1952 Puerto Rico has had three main political parties: the [[Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico|Popular Democratic Party]] (PPD), the [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico|New Progressive Party]] (PNP) and the [[Puerto Rican Independence Party]] (PIP). These three parties stood for three distinct future political status scenarios: the PPD seeks to maintain the island's &quot;association&quot; status with the U.S. as a commonwealth, and has won a plurality vote in referendums on the island's status held over the last six decades, the PNP seeks to have Puerto Rico become a [[51st state|U.S. state]], and the PIP seeks the establishment of a [[Sovereign state|sovereign]] and [[Puerto Rican independence movement|independent]] republic. 

In 2007, a fourth party, the [[Puerto Ricans for Puerto Rico Party]] (PPR), was registered. The PPR claims that it seeks to address the islands' problems from a status-neutral platform. However, it ceased to remain a registered political party when it failed to obtain the requisite number of votes in the 2008 general election.  Non-registered parties include the [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party]], the [[Socialist Workers Movement (Puerto Rico)|Socialist Workers Movement]], the [[Hostosian National Independence Movement]].

{{Main|Political status of Puerto Rico}}

The nature of Puerto Rico's political relationship with the U.S. is the subject of ongoing debate in Puerto Rico, the [[United States Congress]], and the [[United Nations]]. Specifically, the basic question is whether Puerto Rico should remain a [[Territories of the United States|U.S. territory]], become a [[U.S. state]], or become an independent country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL32933.pdf |title=Political Status of Puerto Rico: Background, Options, and Issues in the 109th Congress |date=May 25, 2005 |author=Keith Bea |publisher=Congressional Research Service |accessdate=October 1, 2007 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sdc&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title=Special committee on decolonization approves text calling on United States to expedite Puerto Rican self-determination process |date=June 13, 2006 |publisher=Department of Public Information, United Nations General Assembly |url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2006/gacol3138.doc.htm |accessdate=October 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Estado Libre Asociado'' ===
In 1950, the U.S. Congress granted Puerto Ricans the right to organize a [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]] via a referendum that gave them the option of voting their preference, &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;, on a proposed U.S. law that would organize Puerto Rico as a &quot;commonwealth&quot; that would continue United States sovereignty over Puerto Rico and its people. Puerto Rico's electorate expressed its support for this measure in 1951 with a second referendum to ratify the constitution. The [[Constitution of Puerto Rico]] was formally adopted on {{Nowrap|July 3}}, 1952. The Constitutional Convention specified the name by which the [[body politic]] would be known. 

On February 4, 1952, the convention approved Resolution 22 which chose in English the word ''[[Commonwealth (U.S. insular area)|Commonwealth]]'', meaning a &quot;politically organized community&quot; or &quot;state&quot;, which is simultaneously connected by a compact or treaty to another political system. Puerto Rico officially designates itself with the term &quot;Commonwealth of Puerto Rico&quot; in its constitution, as a translation into English of the term to &quot;Estado Libre Asociado&quot; (ELA). Literally translated into English the phrase ''Estado Libre Asociado'' means &quot;Associated Free State.&quot;  The preamble of the Commonwealth constitution in part reads:
	&quot;We, the people of Puerto Rico, in order to organise ourselves politically on a fully democratic basis, ...do ordain and establish this Constitution for the commonwealth which, in the exercise of our natural rights, we now create within our union with the [[United States|United States of America]].
In so doing, we declare:
	... We consider as determining factors in our life our citizenship of the United States of America and our aspiration continually to enrich our democratic heritage in the individual and collective enjoyment of its rights and privileges; our loyalty to the principles of the [[United States Constitution|Federal Constitution]];...&quot;

While the approval of the Commonwealth constitution by the people of Puerto Rico, the U.S. Congress and the U.S. President, marked a historic change in the civil government of Puerto Rico, neither it nor the public laws approved by Congress in 1950 and 1952 revoked statutory provisions concerning the legal relationship of Puerto Rico to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Dietz, James L.

Economic History of Puerto Rico:  Institutional Challenge and Capitalist Development.  Princeton University Press, 1986].&lt;/ref&gt; This relationship is based on the [[Territorial Clause]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]]. The statutory provisions that set forth the conditions of the relationship are commonly referred to as the Federal Relations Act (FRA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode48/usc_sup_01_48_10_4.html |title= Federal Relations Act (FRA) codified on U.S. Code Title 48, Chapter 4 |date=July 25, 1952 |publisher=Cornel University Law School|accessdate=January 18, 2010 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inclusive by Resolution number 34, approved by the Constitutional Convention and ratified in the Referendum held on November 4, 1952, the following new sentence was added to section 3 of article VII of the commonwealth constitution: &quot;Any amendment or revision of this constitution shall be consistent with the resolution enacted by the applicable provisions of the [[Constitution of the United States]], with the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act and with Public Law 600, [[81st United States Congress|Eighty-first Congress]], adopted in the nature of a compact&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://premium.caribe.net/~amvr/constitu.htm |title=Constitution of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico Article VII |publisher=Premium.caribe.net |accessdate=February 6, 2011}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The provisions of the Federal Relations Act as codified on the U.S. Code Title 48, Chapter 4 shall apply to the island of Puerto Rico and to the adjacent islands belonging to the United States and waters of those islands; and the name Puerto Rico, as used in the chapter, shall be held to include not only the island of that name, but all the adjacent islands as aforesaid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode48/usc_sec_48_00000731----000-.html|title= U.S. Code Title 48, Chapter 4, Subchapter I &gt; § 731|publisher=Cornell University Law School|accessdate=January 18, 2010 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; While specified subsections of the FRA were &quot;adopted in the nature of a compact&quot;, other provisions, by comparison, are excluded from the compact reference.

In 1967, Puerto Rico's Legislative Assembly polled the political preferences of the Puerto Rican electorate by passing a [[plebiscite]] act that provided for a vote on the status of Puerto Rico. This constituted the first plebiscite by the Legislature for a choice among three status options (commonwealth, statehood, and independence). Claiming &quot;foul play&quot; and dubbing the process as illegitimate and contrary to norms of international law regarding decolonization procedures, the plebiscite was boycotted by the major pro-statehood and pro-independence parties of the time, the [[Republican Party of Puerto Rico]] and the Puerto Rican Independence Party, respectively. The Commonwealth option, represented by the PDP, won with a majority of 60.4% of the votes. After the plebiscite, efforts in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and 2000s to enact legislation to address the status issue died in U.S. Congressional committees. In subsequent plebiscites organized by Puerto Rico held in 1993 and 1998 (without any formal commitment on the part of the U.S. Government to honor the results), the current political status failed to receive majority support. In 1993, Commonwealth status won by only a plurality of votes (48.6% versus 46.3% for statehood), while the &quot;none of the above&quot; option, which was the [[Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico|Popular Democratic Party]]-sponsored choice, won in 1998 with 50.3% of the votes (versus 46.5% for statehood). Disputes arose as to the definition of each of the ballot alternatives, and Commonwealth advocates, among others, reportedly urged a vote for &quot;none of the above&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL32933.pdf ''Political Status of Puerto Rico: Options for Congress.''

Constitutionally, Puerto Rico is subject to the Congress's plenary powers under the [[territorial clause]] of Article&amp;nbsp;IV, sec. 3, of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Const. art. IV, § 3, cl. 2 (&quot;The Congress shall have Power to dispose of and make all needful Rules and Regulations respecting the Territory or other Property belonging to the United States&amp;nbsp;...&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. federal law applies to Puerto Rico, even though Puerto Rico is not a [[U.S. State|state]] of the American Union and their residents have no voting representation in the U.S. Congress. Like the States of the American Union, Puerto Rico lacks &quot;the full sovereignty of an independent nation,&quot; for example, the power to manage its &quot;external relations with other nations,&quot; which was retained by the Federal Government.  The Supreme Court has indicated that once the Constitution has been extended to an area (by Congress or the Courts), its coverage is irrevocable.  To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they, not this Court, say &quot;what the law is.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[Downes v. Bidwell]], 182 U.S. 244, 261 (1901), commenting on an earlier Supreme Court decision, Loughborough v. Blake, 18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 317 (1820); Rasmussen v. United States, 197 U.S. 516, 529–530, 536 (1905)(concurring opinions of Justices Harlan and Brown), that once the Constitution has been extended to an area, its coverage is irrevocable; [[Boumediene v. Bush]] – That where the Constitution has been once formally extended by Congress to territories, neither Congress nor the territorial legislature can enact laws inconsistent therewith.  The Constitution grants Congress and the President the power to acquire, dispose of, and govern territory, not the power to decide when and where its terms apply.&lt;/ref&gt;

Puerto Ricans &quot;were collectively made [[U.S. citizenship#Birthright citizenship|U.S. citizens]]&quot; in 1917 as a result of the [[Jones-Shafroth Act]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Louisiana Purchase and American Expansion: 1803–1898''.

Since Puerto Rico is an [[Unincorporated territories of the United States|unincorporated territory]] (see above) and not a U.S. state, the [[United States Constitution]] does not fully [[enfranchise]] [[US citizen]]s residing in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Department of State&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Constitutional Topic: Citizenship&quot;&gt;{{Cite document |url=http://www.usconstitution.net/consttop_citi.html |title=Constitutional Topic: Citizenship |publisher=U.S. Constitution Online |accessdate=June 6, 2009 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;(''See also:'' &quot;[[Voting rights in Puerto Rico]]&quot;). Despite their American citizenship, however, only the &quot;[[fundamental right]]s&quot; under the federal constitution apply to Puerto Ricans. Various other U.S Supreme Court decisions have been held opinions on which rights apply in Puerto Rico and which ones do not. Puerto Ricans have a long history of service in the U.S. armed forces and, since 1917, they have been included in the U.S. [[compulsory draft]] whenever it has been in effect.

In 1992, President [[George H. W. Bush]] issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. This memorandum directs all federal departments, agencies, and officials to treat Puerto Rico administratively as if it were a state, insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations. Federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in Puerto Rico, just as in any state, including the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]], [[Transportation Security Administration]], [[Social Security Administration]], and others.  While Puerto Rico has its own Commonwealth judicial system similar to that of a U.S. state, there is also a federal district court in Puerto Rico, and Puerto Rican judges have served in that Court and in other federal courts on the mainland regardless of their residency status at the time of their appointment. Puerto Ricans are also regularly appointed to high-level federal positions, including serving as [[Ambassadors of the United States|United States Ambassadors]].

=== International status ===
On November 27, 1953, shortly after the establishment of the Commonwealth, the General Assembly of the [[United Nations]] approved [[UN General Assembly Resolution|Resolution 748]], removing Puerto Rico's classification as a [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories|non-self-governing territory]] under article 73(e) of the Charter from UN. But the General Assembly did not apply the full list of criteria which was enunciated in 1960 when it took favorable note of the cessation of transmission of information regarding the non-self-governing status of Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/086/13/IMG/NR008613.pdf?OpenElementGA resolution 740] (27 november 1953), &quot;''Cessation of transmission o the information under article 73 e of the Charter in respect of Puerto Rico''&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://daccess-dds-ny.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/153/15/IMG/NR015315.pdf?OpenElement GA Resolution 1541] ({{Nowrap|December 15}} 1960), &quot;''Principles which should guide Members in determining whether or not an obligation exists to transmit the information called for in article 73 e of the Charter. (See ANNEX).''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; According to the White House Task Force on Puerto Rico's Political Status in its {{Nowrap|December 21}}, 2007 report, the U.S., in its written submission to the UN in 1953, never represented that Congress could not change its relationship with Puerto Rico without the territory's consent.&lt;ref name=status2007 /&gt; It stated that the U.S. Justice Department in 1959 reiterated that Congress held power over Puerto Rico pursuant to the Territorial Clause&lt;ref name = &quot;Artice4&quot;&gt;Art. IV, Sec. 3, clause 2, U.S. Constitution.&lt;/ref&gt; of the U.S. Constitution.&lt;ref name=status2007 /&gt;

In 1993, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] stated that Congress may unilaterally repeal the Puerto Rican Constitution or the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act and replace them with any rules or regulations of its choice.&lt;ref name=&quot;ftp.resources.com&quot;/&gt;  In a 1996 report on a Puerto Rico status political bill, the [[United States House Committee on Natural Resources|U.S. House Committee on Resources]] stated, &quot;Puerto Rico's current status does not meet the criteria for any of the options for full self-government under Resolution 1541&quot; (the three established forms of full self-government being stated in the report as (1) national independence, (2) free association based on separate sovereignty, or (3) full integration with another nation on the basis of equality). The report concluded that Puerto Rico &quot;... remains an unincorporated territory and does not have the status of 'free association' with the United States as that status is defined under United States law or international practice&quot;, that the establishment of local self-government with the consent of the people can be unilaterally revoked by the U.S. Congress, and that U.S. Congress can also withdraw the U.S. citizenship of Puerto Rican residents of Puerto Rico at any time, for a legitimate Federal purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Recent developments ===
In 2005 and 2007, two reports were issued by the U.S. President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status.&lt;ref name=status&gt;{{cite web |url=http://charma.uprm.edu/~angel/Puerto_Rico/reporte_status.pdf |title= Report by the President's task force on Puerto Rico's Status |month=December |year=2005 |accessdate=October 1, 2007 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=status2007&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.primerahora.com/XStatic/primerahora/docs/espanol/whitehousestatusreport.pdf |title= Report by the President's task force on Puerto Rico's Status |month=December |year=2007 |accessdate=December 24, 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both reports conclude that Puerto Rico continues to be a territory of U.S. under the plenary powers of the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref name=status2007 /&gt; Reactions from Puerto Rico's two major political parties were mixed. The Popular Democratic Party (PPD) challenged the task force's report{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} and committed to validating the current status in all international forums, including the United Nations. It also rejected {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} any &quot;colonial or territorial status&quot; as a status option, and vowed to keep working for the enhanced Commonwealth status that was approved by the PPD in 1998, which included sovereignty, an association based on &quot;respect and dignity between both nations&quot;, and common citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.puertorico-herald.org/issues/vol2n11/indep-hearing-v2n11.html |title=Oversight Hearing on Issues Raised by Puerto Rico Separate Sovereignty and Independence |publisher=Puertorico-herald.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Progressive Party of Puerto Rico| New Progressive Party or New Party for Progress (PNP)]] supported{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} the White House Report's conclusions and supported bills to provide for a democratic referendum process among Puerto Rico voters.

A 2009 [[Congressional Research Service Report|CRS report]] suggested that action might be taken in the 111th Congress.
The reports issued in 2007 and 2005 by the [[President's Task Force on Puerto Rico's Status]] may be the basis for reconsideration of the existing commonwealth status, as legislative developments during the 109th and 110th Congresses suggested. Agreement on the process to be used in considering the status proposals has been as elusive as agreement on the end result. Congress would have a determinative role in any resolution of the issue. The four options that appear to be most frequently discussed include continuation of the commonwealth, modification of the current commonwealth agreement, statehood, or independence. If independence, or separate national sovereignty, were selected, Puerto Rican officials might seek to negotiate a compact of free association with the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |url= http://assets.opencrs.com/rpts/RL32933_20090804.pdf |title=Political Status of Puerto Rico: Options for Congress |publisher=Congressional Research Service |date=August 4, 2009 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 15, 2009, the [[Special Committee on Decolonization|United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization]] approved a draft resolution calling on the Government of the United States to expedite a process that would allow the Puerto Rican people to exercise fully their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2009/gacol3193.doc.htm |title=Members Hear Petitioners Speak up for Independence, Statehood, Free Association |publisher=General Assembly of the United Nations |date=June 15, 2009 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 2010, the U.S. House voted 223–169 to approve a measure for a federally sanctioned process for Puerto Rico's self-determination, allowing Puerto Rico to set a new referendum on whether to continue its present form of commonwealth political status or to have a different political status. If Puerto Ricans vote to continue to have their present form of political status, the Government of Puerto Rico is authorized to conduct additional plebiscites at intervals of every eight years from the date on which the results of the prior plebiscite are certified; if Puerto Ricans vote to have a different political status, a second referendum would determine whether Puerto Rico would become a U.S. state, an independent country, or a sovereign nation associated with the U.S. that would not be subject to the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;afp-referendum&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hbnA3Ucau6IF7lEjqdfo40sqVy3A |title=US lawmakers clear path for new Puerto Rico referendum|journal=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=April 29, 2010|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the House debate, a fourth option, to retain its present form of commonwealth ([[status quo]]) political status, was added as an option in the second plebiscite.&lt;ref name=&quot;afp-referendum&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-2499|title=Text of H.R. 2499: Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2010|journal=[[govtrack.us]] |date=April 29, 2010|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Senate hearing was held on May 19, 2010, for the purpose of gathering testimony on the bill. Among those offering testimony were [[Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico]], [[Pedro Pierluisi]]; [[Governor of Puerto Rico]], [[Luis Fortuño]]; President of the [[Popular Democratic Party of Puerto Rico]], [[Héctor Ferrer]]; and President of the [[Puerto Rican Independence Party]], [[Rubén Berríos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://energy.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?Fuseaction=Hearings.Hearing&amp;Hearing_ID=5fad861f-a654-fbaf-b014-786dc0cc4fae |title=Official Website of the U.S. Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources |publisher=Energy.senate.gov |date=May 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Senate Energy &amp; Natural Resources Committee leadership, the four options are the continuation of the current commonwealth status, subject to the territorial clause (under Article IV of the Constitution), statehood, independence, and free association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=casiano communications |url=http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news03.php?nt_id=51401&amp;ct_id=1 |title=Fortuño hails US senators’ status letter to Obama |publisher=Caribbeanbusinesspr.com |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news03.php?nt_id=51348&amp;ct_id=1&amp;ct_name=1 |title=US senators to Obama: Only 4 PR status options |publisher=Caribbeanbusinesspr.com  |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news03.php?nt_id=43994&amp;ct_id=1 |title=Senate committee co-chairs seek White House view on P.R. status |publisher=Caribbeanbusinesspr.com  |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 22, 2010, the 111th United States Congress adjourned without any Senate vote on H.R.2499, killing the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-2499|title=H.R. 2499: Puerto Rico Democracy Act of 2010 - Bill Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest Task Force report was released on March 11, 2011. The report suggests a two-plebiscite process, including a &quot;first plebiscite that requires the people of Puerto Rico to choose whether they wish to be part of the United States (either via Statehood or Commonwealth) or wish to be independent (via Independence or Free Association). If continuing to be part of the United States were chosen in the first plebiscite, a second vote would be taken between Statehood and Commonwealth.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;President Task Force Status Report 2011&quot;&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/Puerto_Rico_Task_Force_Report.pdf REPORT BY THE PRESIDENT’S TASK FORCE ON PUERTO RICO’S STATUS], March 11, 2011, [http://www.whitehouse.gov/ The White House]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization passed a resolution and adopted a consensus text introduced by Cuba's delegate on June 20, 2011, calling on the United States to expedite a process &quot;that would allow Puerto Ricans to fully exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;UN decolonization committee eyes PR&quot;/&gt;

In October 2011, Governor [[Luis Fortuño]] set August 12, 2012 to hold the first part of a two-step status plebiscite.  If a second status vote is required, it will take place on the same day as the general election in November 6, 2012, he added.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news03.php?nt_id=62931&amp;ct_id=1 ''Fortuño calls for status vote next August.''] John Marino.

The bill passed on December 28, 2011. Rather than hold two referendums for both questions, however, one referendum posing both questions will [[Puerto Rican status referendum, 2012|be held on a single ballot]] on November 6, 2012, simultaneous with the general elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oslpr.org/2009-2012/leyes/pdf/ley-283-28-Dic-2011.pdf ''Ley Numero 283 del 28 de diciembre de 2011.''] Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico.

The first referendum will ask voters whether they want to maintain the current status under the territorial clause of the U.S. Constitution or whether they prefer a nonterritorial option.  A second question on the same ballot will simultaneously give people three status options: statehood, independence or free association (this last one translated as &quot;Estado Libre Asociado Soberano&quot; or a state of sovereign free association) .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=casiano communications |url=http://www.caribbeanbusinesspr.com/news03.php?nt_id=62931&amp;ct_id=1 |title=Fortuño calls for status, legislative reform votes on August 12, 2012 |publisher=Caribbeanbusinesspr.com |date=2011-10-04 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Puerto Rico consists of the main island of Puerto Rico and various smaller islands, including [[Vieques, Puerto Rico|Vieques]], [[Culebra, Puerto Rico|Culebra]], [[Mona, Puerto Rico|Mona]], [[Desecheo Island|Desecheo]], and [[Caja de Muertos, Puerto Rico|Caja de Muertos]]. Of these last five, only Culebra and Vieques are inhabited year-round. Mona is uninhabited most of the year except for employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources. There are also many other even smaller islands including [[Monito Island|Monito]] and &quot;La Isleta de San Juan&quot; which includes [[Old San Juan]] and [[Puerta de Tierra]] and is connected to the main island by bridges.

The oldest rocks are approximately {{Nowrap|190 million}} years old ([[Jurassic]]) and are located at Sierra Bermeja in the southwest part of the island. They may represent part of the [[oceanic crust]] and are believed to come from the Pacific Ocean realm.

Puerto Rico lies at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American [[plate tectonics|plate]]s and is being deformed by the [[tectonics|tectonic]] stresses caused by their interaction. These stresses may cause [[earthquakes]] and [[tsunami]]s. These [[seismic]] events, along with [[landslide]]s, represent some of the most dangerous [[geologic hazards]] in the island and in the northeastern Caribbean. The [[1918 Puerto Rico Earthquake|most recent major earthquake]] occurred on {{Nowrap|October 11}}, 1918, and had an estimated magnitude of 7.5 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1918 quake&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/regional/world/puerto_rico/puerto_rico_history.php| title=Earthquake History of Puerto Rico |publisher=U.S. Geological Survey |accessdate=September 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It originated off the coast of [[Aguadilla]] and was accompanied by a tsunami.

Temperatures do not change drastically throughout the seasons. The temperature in the south is usually a few degrees higher than the north and temperatures in the central interior mountains are always cooler than the rest of the island. The [[List of Atlantic hurricane seasons|hurricane season]] spans from June to November. The all-time low in Puerto Rico has been {{convert|39|°F|°C|abbr=on}}, registered in [[Aibonito, Puerto Rico|Aibonito]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nowdata.rcc-acis.org/SJU/pubACIS_results |title=NOAA Online Weather Data – Puerto Rico |publisher=National Weather Service |accessdate=May 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average yearly precipitation is 1687mm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Daly2003&quot;&gt;Daly, Christopher, Eileen H.

Species [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to the archipelago are 239 plants, 16 birds and 39 [[amphibian]]s/[[reptile]]s, recognized as of 1998. Most of these (234, 12 and 33 respectively) are found on the main island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://islands.unep.ch/ISV.htm#459 |title=Island Directory |publisher=Islands.unep.ch |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recognizable endemic species and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride is the ''[[Coquí]]'', a small frog easily identified by the sound of its call, and from which it gets its name. Most ''Coquí'' species (13 of 17) live in the [[El Yunque National Forest]], a [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical rainforest]] in the northeast of the island previously known as the Caribbean National Forest. El Yunque is home to more than 240 plants, 26 of which are endemic to the island. It is also home to 50 bird species, including the critically endangered [[Puerto Rican Amazon]]. Across the island in the southwest, the {{convert|40|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of dry land at the Guánica Commonwealth Forest Reserve&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=5146 |title=Puerto Rico |publisher=Scholastic.com |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; contain over 600 uncommon species of plants and animals, including 48 endangered species and 16 endemic to Puerto Rico.

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Municipalities of Puerto Rico}}
[[File:USA Puerto Rico labeled.svg|thumb|500px|Puerto Rico's municipalities]]
As an unincorporated territory of the United States, Puerto Rico does not have any first order administrative divisions as defined by the [[U.S. Government]], but there are 78 [[Municipalities of Puerto Rico|municipalities]] at the secondary level which function as counties. Municipalities are further subdivided into ''[[barrio]]s'', and those into sectors. Each municipality has a [[mayor]] and a municipal legislature elected for four year terms.

The first municipality (previously called &quot;town&quot;) of Puerto Rico, [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], was founded in 1521. In the 16th century two more municipalities were established, [[San Germán]] (1570) and [[Coamo]] (1579). Three more municipalities were established in the 17th century. These were [[Arecibo]] (1614), [[Aguada, Puerto Rico|Aguada]] (1692) and [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] (1692). The 18th and 19th century saw an increase in settlement in Puerto Rico with 30 municipalities being established in the 18th century and 34 more in the 19th century. Only six municipalities were founded in the 20th century with the last, [[Florida, Puerto Rico|Florida]], being founded in 1971.&lt;ref name='fundacion'/&gt;

[[File:Milla-de-oro-min-2.jpg|thumb|[[Milla de Oro]] is a major financial center in Puerto Rico.]]
In the early 20th century the greatest contributor to Puerto Rico's economy was [[agriculture]] and its main crop was sugar. In the late 1940s a series of projects codenamed [[Operation Bootstrap]] encouraged a significant shift to manufacture via tax exemptions. Manufacturing quickly replaced agriculture as the main industry of the island. Puerto Rico is classified as a &quot;high income country&quot; by the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20421402~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html Data and Statistics of Country Groups] of the [[World Bank]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://devdata.worldbank.org/ict/pri_ict.pdf |title=Income report for Puerto Rico |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic conditions have improved dramatically since the [[Great Depression]] because of external investment in capital-intensive industries such as [[petrochemical]]s, [[pharmaceuticals industry|pharmaceuticals]] and [[technology]]. Once the beneficiary of special tax treatment from the U.S. government, today local industries must compete with those in more economically depressed parts of the world where wages are not subject to U.S. minimum wage legislation. In recent years, some U.S. and foreign owned factories have moved to lower wage countries in Latin America and Asia. Puerto Rico is subject to U.S. trade laws and restrictions.

Also, starting around 1950, there was heavy migration from Puerto Rico to the [[Continental United States]], particularly New York City, in search of better economic conditions. Puerto Rican migration to New York displayed an average yearly migration of 1,800 for the years 1930–1940, 31,000 for 1946–1950, 45,000 for 1951–1960, and a peak of 75,000 in 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://palante.org/History.htm |title=Latino/a Education Network Service, retrieved February&amp;nbsp;5, 2007 |publisher=Palante.org |date=March 17, 1917 |accessdate=August 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2003, the [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] estimates that more people of Puerto Rican birth or ancestry live in the U.S. than in Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prfaa.com/uploadedfiles/PRFAA_Atlas_12_06_04.pdf Anglelo Falcón, &quot;Atlas of Stateside Puerto Ricans&quot;, Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, published {{Nowrap|December 6}}, 2004, retrieved {{Nowrap|February 5}}, 2007]{{Dead link|date=August 2010|url=http://www.prfaa.com/uploadedfiles/PRFAA_Atlas_12_06_04.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 1, 2006, the Puerto Rican government faced significant [[2006 Puerto Rico budget crisis|shortages in cash flows]], which forced the closure of the local Department of Education and 42 other government agencies. All 1,536 public schools closed, and 95,762 people were furloughed in the first-ever partial shutdown of the government in the island's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Post Store |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/02/AR2006050200458.html |title=Puerto Rico Extends Government Shutdown.

On {{Nowrap|November 15}}, 2006, a 5.5% sales tax was implemented. Municipalities are required by law to apply a municipal sales tax of 1.5% bringing the total sales tax to 7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpa2biz.com/Content/media/PRODUCER_CONTENT/Newsletters/Articles_2008/CorpTax/navigate.jsp |title=Navigating Puerto Rico's New Sales-and-Use Tax.

[[File:La Concha.JPG|thumb|left|View of the [[La Concha Resort|La Concha]], one of the newly refurbished hotels, from the beach in [[Condado]]]]
[[Tourism in Puerto Rico|Tourism]] is an important component of Puerto Rican economy supplying an approximate {{Nowrap|$1.8 billion}}. In 1999, an estimated {{Nowrap|5 million}} tourists visited the island, most from the U.S. Nearly a third of these are [[cruise ship]] passengers. A steady increase in hotel registrations since 1998 and the construction of new hotels and new tourism projects, such as the [[Puerto Rico Convention Center]], indicate the current strength of the tourism industry. In 2009, tourism accounted for nearly 7% of the islands' gross national product.&lt;ref&gt;''Disfruta y Conoce tu Isla: Haz Turismo Interno.'' Jose A. Reyes Feliciano. La Perla del Sur. Ponce Puerto Rico. 7 October 2009. Page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Puerto Ricans had [[median household income]] of $18,314 for 2009, which makes Puerto Rico's economy comparable to the independent nations of [[Latvia]] or Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;factfinder.census.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=American FactFinder, United States Census Bureau |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/GRTTable?_bm=y&amp;-_box_head_nbr=R1901&amp;-ds_name=ACS_2009_1YR_G00_&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-format=US-30&amp;-CONTEXT=grt |title=R1901.

In November 2010, Gov. Fortuño proposed a tax reform plan that would be implemented in a six-year period, retroactive to {{Nowrap|January 1}}, 2010. The first phase, applicable to year 2010, reduces taxes to all individual taxpayers by 7–15%. By year 2016, average relief for individual taxpayers will represent a 50% tax cut and a 30% cut for corporate taxpayers, whose tax rate will be lowered from 41 to 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/antelalegislaturalareformacontributiva-823151.html |title=Ante la Legislatura la reforma contributiva – El Nuevo Día |publisher=Elnuevodia.com |accessdate=February 6, 2011}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Businesses and consumers in Puerto Rico are subjected to economic discrimination by many U.S. and multinational companies that limit access to products or offer them at higher prices to businesses and consumers located in Puerto Rico. For example, Apple does not include K-12 or post-secondary educational institutions in their national pricing program offering discounts to teachers and students and special pricing for institutional purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.apple.com/us-hed/findyourschool |title=Apple Education Store – Find Your School and Shop – Apple Store (U.S.) |publisher=Store.apple.com |date=September 7, 2010 |accessdate=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Likewise, Minneapolis-based [[Best Buy]] does not allow residents of Puerto Rico to purchase goods on their website, which may be purchased from the 50 states, Guam and the United States Virgin Islands, but invites potential customers to skirt their own rules: &quot;Now you can order items online and ship them to a U.S. address* – or pick them up at a U.S. store. International orders may be shipped to street addresses in the U.S., U.S. Virgin Islands and Guam, along with AFO/FPO mailing address.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bestbuy.com/ |title=Best Buy |publisher=Best Buy |accessdate=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the latest report by the President Task Force on Puerto Rico Status recognizes that the status question and the economy are intimately linked. Many participants in the forums conducted by the Task Force argued that uncertainty about status is holding Puerto Rico back in economic areas. And although there are a number of economic actions that should be taken immediately or in the short term, regardless of the ultimate outcome of the
status question, identifying the most effective means of assisting the Puerto Rican economy depends
on resolving the ultimate question of status. In short, the long-term economic well-being of Puerto Rico would be dramatically improved by an early decision on the status question.&lt;ref name=&quot;President Task Force Status Report 2011&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Real Cédula de Gracia.jpg|upright|thumb|Royal Decree of Graces, 1815]]
Continuous European immigration during the 19th century helped the population grow from 155,000 in 1800 to almost a million at the close of the century. A census conducted by royal decree on {{Nowrap|September 30}}, 1858 gives the following totals of the Puerto Rican population at this time: 341,015 as Free [[colored]]; 300,430 identified as [[Whites]]; and 41,736 were [[slaves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Van Middeldyk|first=R.A|title=The History of Puerto Rico|url=http://www.fullbooks.com/The-History-of-Puerto-Rico.html|accessdate=May 29, 2008|chapter=Part 4|chapterurl=http://www.fullbooks.com/The-History-of-Puerto-Rico4.html|isbn=0-405-06241-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 19th century hundreds of Corsican, French, [[Lebanon|Lebanese]], [[Chinese immigration to Puerto Rico|Chinese]], and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] families arrived in Puerto Rico, along with large numbers of immigrants from Spain (mainly from [[Catalonia]], [[Asturias]], [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], the [[Balearic Islands]], [[Andalusia]], and the [[Canary Islands]]) and numerous Spanish loyalists from Spain's former colonies in South America. Other settlers included [[Irish immigration to Puerto Rico|Irish]], [[Scotland|Scots]], [[German immigration to Puerto Rico|Germans]], [[Italian people|Italians]] and thousands others who were granted land by Spain during the ''Real Cedula de Gracias de 1815'' (&quot;[[Royal Decree of Graces of 1815]]&quot;), which allowed European Catholics to settle in the island with land allotments in the interior of the island, provided they agreed to pay taxes and continue to support the Catholic Church.

Between 1960 and 1990 the census questionnaire in Puerto Rico did not ask about race or color. However, the [[2000 United States Census]] included a racial self-identification question in Puerto Rico. According to the census, most Puerto Ricans self-identified as White and few declared themselves to be Black or some other race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=American FactFinder, United States Census Bureau |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/QTTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=04000US72&amp;-qr_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U_DP1&amp;-ds_name=DEC_2000_SF1_U |title=U.S Census |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent study conducted in Puerto Rico suggests that around 52.6% of the population possess Amerindian [[mtDNA]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11512677 Mitochondrial DNA analysis reveals substantial Native American ancestry in Puerto Rico]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Madrigal&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Lorena Madrigal|first=Madrigal|title=Human biology of Afro-Caribbean populations|publisher=Cambridge University Press, 2006 |page=121|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ddnkIaZRHxEC&amp;pg=PA121&amp;dq=Puerto+Rico+Amerindian+mtDNA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-521-81931-2|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigration and emigration ===
[[File:Population Density, PR, 2000 (sample).jpg|thumb|350px|left|Population density, Census 2000]]
Puerto Rico has recently become the permanent home of over 100,000 legal residents who immigrated from not only the [[Dominican immigration to Puerto Rico|Dominican Republic]], but from other Latin American countries. These include Cuba, [[Colombia]], and [[Venezuela]], as well as surrounding [[West Indies|Caribbean islands]], Haiti, [[Barbados]], and the U.S. Virgin Islands among them.

[[Emigration]] is a major part of contemporary Puerto Rican history. Starting soon after [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], poverty, cheap airfare, and promotion by the island government caused waves of Puerto Ricans to move to the United States, particularly to [[Puerto Rican migration to New York|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Florida]]. This trend continued even as Puerto Rico's economy improved and its birth rate declined, and Puerto Ricans continue to follow a pattern of &quot;circular migration&quot;.

=== Distribution ===

The most populous city is the capital, [[San Juan, Puerto Rico|San Juan]], with approximately 395,326 people. Other major cities include [[Bayamón, Puerto Rico|Bayamón]], [[Carolina, Puerto Rico|Carolina]], [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]], and [[Caguas, Puerto Rico|Caguas]]. Of the ten most populous cities on the island, eight are located within what is considered [[San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo metropolitan area|San Juan's metropolitan area]], while the other two are located in the south ([[Ponce metropolitan area|Ponce]]) and west ([[Mayagüez metropolitan area|Mayagüez]]) of the island.

=== Languages ===
The official languages are Spanish and English with Spanish being the primary language. English is taught as a second language in public and private schools from elementary levels to high school and at the university level.

====Spanish====
{{Main|Puerto Rican Spanish}}
The Spanish of Puerto Rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from the Spanish spoken elsewhere. While the Spanish spoken in all Iberian, Mediterranean and Atlantic Spanish Maritime Provinces was brought to the island over the centuries, the most profound regional impact on the Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico has been from that spoken in present-day Canary Islands.

As a result of the natural inclusion of indigenous vocabulary in all New World former European colonies (English, French, Spanish, Dutch, etc.), the Spanish of Puerto Rico also includes occasional Taíno words, typically in the context of vegetation, natural phenomenon or primitive musical instruments. Similarly, African-attributed words exist in the contexts of foods, music or dances, developed in coastal towns with concentrations of descendants of former Sub-Saharan slaves.

====English====

According to a study by the University of Puerto Rico, nine of every ten Puerto Ricans residing in Puerto Rico do not speak English at an advanced level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Prensa Asociada |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/latino/espanol/2009/02/25/2009-02-25_se_discrimina_al_usar_el_ingls_en_alguno-2.html |title=',¿Se discrimina al usar el inglés en algunos tribunales de Puerto Rico?', New York Daily News.

=== Religion ===
[[File:San Juan Cathedral.JPG|thumb|upright|Front entrance of the Roman Catholic Cathedral of San Juan Bautista: Many religious beliefs now are represented in the island]]
The [[Roman Catholicism in Puerto Rico|Roman Catholic Church]] has historically been the dominant religion in Puerto Rico. The first [[dioceses]] in the Americas, including the first diocese of Puerto Rico, were authorized by [[Pope Julius&amp;nbsp;II]] in 1511.&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Porto Rico}}&lt;/ref&gt; One Pope, [[John Paul&amp;nbsp;II]], visited Puerto Rico in October&amp;nbsp;1984. All [[Municipalities of Puerto Rico|municipalities]] in Puerto Rico have at least one Catholic church, most of which are located at the town center or &quot;''plaza''&quot;.

[[Protestantism]], which was suppressed under the Spanish regime, has spread under American rule, making modern Puerto Rico interconfessional. The first Protestant church, Holy Trinity Church in Ponce, was established by the Anglican diocese of Antigua in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://episcopalpr.org/sobre_nosotros/sobre_nosotros.html |title=Sobre Nosotros |publisher=Episcopalpr.org |accessdate=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1872, [[German immigration to Puerto Rico|German]] settlers in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]] founded the Iglesia Santísima Trinidad, an [[Anglican Church]], the first non-Roman Catholic Church in the entire [[Spanish Empire]] in [[the Americas]].&lt;ref&gt;Luis Fortuño Janeiro.

There is also an [[Eastern Orthodox]] community in Puerto Rico, The Dormition of the Most Holy Theotokos/ St. Spyridon's Church is located in Trujillo Alto, and serves the small Orthodox community. The congregation represents Greeks, Russians, Serbians, Bulgarians, Americans, Moldavians, and Puerto Ricans.&lt;ref&gt;http://parish.orthodoxtheologicalinstitute.org/Dormition_of_the_Theotokos/Welcome.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, [[Juanita Garcia Peraza]] founded the [[Mita Congregation]], the first religion of Puerto Rican origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webpub.allegheny.edu/group/LAS/LatinAmIssues/Articles/Vol13/LAI_vol_13_section_I.html |title=Latin American issues Vol. 3 |publisher=Webpub.allegheny.edu |accessdate=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Taíno people|Taíno religious practices]] have been rediscovered/reinvented to a degree by a handful of advocates. Various African religious practices have been present since the arrival of African slaves. In particular, the [[Yoruba religion|Yoruba]] beliefs of [[Santería]] and/or [[Ifá]], and the [[Kongo people|Kongo]]-derived [[Palo Mayombe]] find adherence among a few individuals who practice some form of [[African traditional religion]].

In 1952, a handful of American Jews established the island's first [[synagogue]] in the former residence of William Korber, a wealthy Puerto Rican of [[German immigration to Puerto Rico|German]] descent, which was designed and built by [[Czech people|Czech]] architect [[Antonin Nechodoma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EG&quot;&gt;Eduardo Giorgetti Y Su Mundo: La Aparente Paradoja De Un Millonario Genio Empresarial Y Su Noble Humanismo&quot;; by [[Delma S.

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of Puerto Rico}}
{{See also|Cuisine of Puerto Rico|Music of Puerto Rico}}
[[File:RickyMartin.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ricky Martin]], singer]]

Modern Puerto Rican culture is a unique mix of cultural antecedents, including African, [[Taíno people|Taíno]] (Amerindians), Spanish, and more recently, North American.

From the Spanish Puerto Rico received the Spanish language, the Catholic religion and the vast majority of their cultural and moral values and traditions. The United States added English language influence, the university system and the adoption of some holidays and practices. On {{Nowrap|March 12}} 1903, the [[University of Puerto Rico]] was officially founded, branching out from the &quot;Escuela Normal Industrial&quot;, a smaller organism that was founded in Fajardo three years before.
[[File:Kapok tree Honolulu.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kapok tree (''[[Ceiba]]''), the national tree of Puerto Rico]]
Much of Puerto Rican culture centers on the influence of music. Like the country as a whole, Puerto Rican music has been developed by mixing other cultures with local and traditional rhythms. Early in the history of Puerto Rican music, the influences of African and Spanish traditions were most noticeable. However, the cultural movements across the Caribbean and North America have played a vital role in the more recent musical influences that have reached Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;Giovannetti, Jorge L. &quot;Popular Music and Culture in Puerto Rico: Jamaican and Rap Music as Cross-Cultural Symbols.&quot; In ''Musical Migrations: Transnationalism and Cultural Hybridity in the Americas'', ed.

The official symbols of Puerto Rico are the ''Reinita mora'' or [[Puerto Rican Spindalis]] (a type of bird), the ''[[Thespesia grandiflora|Flor de Maga]]'' (a type of flower), and the ''Ceiba'' or [[Kapok]] (a type of tree). The unofficial animal and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride is the [[Common Coquí|Coquí]], a small frog. Other popular symbols of Puerto Rico are the &quot;[[jíbaro]]&quot;, the &quot;countryman&quot;, and the carite.

== Sports ==
{{Main|Sports in Puerto Rico}}

[[Baseball]] was one of the first sports to gain widespread popularity in Puerto Rico. The [[Puerto Rico Baseball League]] serves as the only active professional league, operating as a winter league.

== Education ==
{{Main|Education in Puerto Rico}}
The first school in Puerto Rico and the first school in the United States after Puerto Rico became a US territory, was the Escuela de Gramatica (Grammer School). The school was established by Bishop [[Alonso Manso]] in 1513, in the area where the Cathedral of San Juan was to be constructed. The school was free of charge and the courses taught were Latin language, literature, history, science, art, philosophy and theology.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Kanellos, &quot;Hispanic Firsts&quot;, Visible Ink Press (ISBN 0-7876-0519-0), p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;

Education in Puerto Rico is divided in three levels—Primary (elementary school grades 1–6), Secondary (intermediate and high school grades 7–12), and Higher Level (undergraduate and graduate studies). As of 2002, the literacy rate of the Puerto Rican population was 94.1%; by gender, it was 93.9% for males and 94.4% for females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/rq.html |title=CIA FactBook |publisher=Cia.gov |accessdate=February 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2000 Census, 60.0% of the population attained a high school degree or higher level of education, and 18.3% has a bachelor's degree or higher.

Instruction at the primary school level is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 18 and is enforced by the state. The Constitution of Puerto Rico grants the right to an education to every citizen on the island. To this end, public schools in Puerto Rico provide free and non-sectarian education at the elementary and secondary levels. At any of the three levels, students may attend either [[Public school (government funded)|public]] or [[Private School|private]] schools. As of 1999, there were 1532 public schools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.de.gobierno.pr/NR/rdonlyres/D3388419-2932-4654-9C59-FBC4585A9CF7/0/PRStateReportCard20022003.pdf |title=Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico |publisher=Departamento de Educación De Puerto Rico |accessdate=May 5, 2008|format=PDF |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080528060210/http://www.de.gobierno.pr/NR/rdonlyres/D3388419-2932-4654-9C59-FBC4585A9CF7/0/PRStateReportCard20022003.pdf |archivedate = May 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 569 private schools in the island.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

{{Main|Transportation in Puerto Rico}}

Cities and towns in Puerto Rico are interconnected by a system of roads, [[freeway]]s, [[limited-access road|expressway]]s, and [[highway]]s maintained by the Highways and Transportation Authority under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of Transportation, and patrolled by the [[Puerto Rico Police Department]]. The island's [[metropolitan area]] is served by a [[Autoridad Metropolitana de Autobuses|public bus transit system]] and a [[rapid transit|metro system]] called ''[[Tren Urbano]]'' (in English: Urban Train).
