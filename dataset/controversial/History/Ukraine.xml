According to a popular and well established theory, the medieval state of [[Kievan Rus]] was established by the [[Varangians]] in the 9th&amp;nbsp;century as the first historically recorded [[East Slavs|East Slavic]] state which emerged as a powerful nation in the [[Middle Ages]] until it disintegrated in the 12th&amp;nbsp;century. By the middle of the 14th century, Ukrainian territories were under the rule of three external powers—the [[Golden Horde]], the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]], and the [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/612921/Ukraine/214508/History |title=Ukraine :: History – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721) Ukraine was divided between a number of regional powers and, by the 19th&amp;nbsp;century, the largest part of Ukraine was integrated into the [[Russian Empire]] with the rest under [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] control. A [[Ukraine after the Russian Revolution|chaotic period]] of incessant warfare ensued, with several internationally recognized attempts at [[Ukrainian Peoples Republic|independence from 1917 to 1921]], following [[World War I]] and the [[Russian Civil War]]. Ukraine emerged from [[Ukrainian War of Independence|its own civil war]], and on December 30, 1922 [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] became one of the founding [[republics of the Soviet Union]]. The Ukrainian SSR's territory was enlarged westward during the civil war shortly before, and after [[World War II]], and further south in 1954 with the [[Crimea]] transfer. In 1945, the Ukrainian SSR became one of the founding members of the United Nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;un ukssr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/depts/dhl/unms/ukraine.shtml|title=Activities of the Member States – Ukraine|accessdate=January 17, 2011|work=United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ukraine became independent again when the [[History of the Soviet Union (1985–1991)|Soviet Union dissolved]] in 1991. This dissolution started a period of transition to a [[market economy]], in which Ukraine was stricken with an eight-year [[recession]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Macroindicators NBU&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bank.gov.ua/ENGL/Macro/index.htm|title=Macroeconomic Indicators|accessdate=December 16, 2007|work=[[National Bank of Ukraine]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071021232506/http://bank.gov.ua/Engl/Macro/index.htm &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=October 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, however, the economy has experienced a high increase in [[List of countries by GDP growth 2000–2007|GDP growth]].

Ukraine is a [[unitary state]] composed of 24 [[oblast]]s (provinces), one [[autonomous republic]] (Crimea), and two cities with special status: [[Kiev]], its capital and largest city, and [[Sevastopol]], which houses the Russian [[Black Sea Fleet]] under a [[leasing]] agreement. Ukraine is a republic under a [[semi-presidential system]] with separate [[legislative]], [[executive branch|executive]], and [[judicial]] branches. Since the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Ukraine continues to maintain the second largest [[Military of Ukraine|military]] in Europe, after that of Russia. The country is home to 46&amp;nbsp;million people, 77.8&amp;nbsp;percent of whom are ethnic [[Ukrainians]], with sizable minorities of [[Russians]] (17%), [[Belarusians]] and [[Romanians]]. [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] is the [[official language]] of Ukraine. Russian is also widely spoken. The dominant religion in the country is [[Eastern Orthodox Christian]]ity, which has heavily influenced [[Ukrainian architecture]], [[Ukrainian literature|literature]] and [[Music of Ukraine|music]].

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{Main|Name of Ukraine}}
The traditional view (mostly influenced by Russian and Polish historiography)&lt;ref&gt;Русанівський, В. М. Українська мова // Енциклопедія «Українська мова». — К., 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; on the etymology of Ukraine is that it came from the old [[Early East Slavs|Slavic]] term ''ukraina'' which meant &quot;border region&quot; or &quot;frontier&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://litopys.org.ua/rizne/nazva_eu.htm |title=З Енциклопедії Українознавства; Назва &quot;Україна&quot; |publisher=Litopys.org.ua |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus corresponded to the Western term [[March (territory)|march]]. The term can be often found in Eastern Slavic chronicles from 1187 on, but for a long time it referred not solely to the border lands in present-day Ukraine.&lt;ref name=&quot;gaida&quot;&gt;Ф.А. Гайда. От Рязани и Москвы до Закарпатья. Происхождение и употребление слова «украинцы» // Родина. 2011. № 1. С. 82–85. [http://www.edrus.org/content/view/22784/56/]&lt;/ref&gt; The plural term ''ukrainy'' was used as well in the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]] as in the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]]. In the 16th and 17th centuries, particularly the lands across the border to the nomad world ([[Crimean Khanate]]) were described by this word. Frequent raids from the steppe made life in such regions a special and dangerous challenge. With the migration of the [[Great Abatis Belt]] southwards, the application of the term switched to [[Sloboda Ukraine]] and then to Central Ukraine where in the course of the time it obtained ethnic meaning for the local [[Rus' (region)|South Rus']] ([[Little Russia]] in the ecclesiastic&lt;ref&gt;See works of [[Ivan Vyshenskyi]] [http://litopys.org.ua/old14_16/old14_19.htm] or [[Kievan Synopsis]] by [[Innokentiy Gizel]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Russian Empire|imperial Russian]] terminology).

Many contemporary Ukrainian historians translate the term &quot;u-kraine&quot; as &quot;in-land&quot;, &quot;home-land&quot; or &quot;our-country&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pivtorak&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://litopys.org.ua/pivtorak/pivt12.htm |title=Григорій Півторак. Походження українців, росіян, білорусів та їхніх мов |publisher=Litopys.org.ua |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This translation is in accordance with the original Ukrainian language meaning of preposition &quot;у-&quot; (u-) and noun &quot;країна&quot; (krayina).&lt;ref&gt;The Comprehensive Dictionary of the Contemporary Ukrainian Language.  Perun Publishers, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The accompanying claim that it always had a strictly separate meaning to &quot;borderland&quot; (ukraina vs. okraina)&lt;ref name=&quot;pivtorak&quot;/&gt; is considered inconsistent with a number of historical sources, often of not Ukrainian origin,&lt;ref name=&quot;gaida&quot;/&gt; while the translation as &quot;borderland&quot; agrees well with the traditional Russian language meaning of &quot;у-&quot; (u-) and &quot;краина&quot; (kraina).&lt;ref&gt;The Comprehensive Dictionary of the Contemporary Russian Language.  2006, T.F. Yefremova.&lt;/ref&gt;

Human settlement in Ukraine and its vicinity dates back to 32,000 BCE, with evidence of the [[Gravettian culture]] in the [[Crimean Mountains]].&lt;ref name=orig&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pone.0020834 | title = The Oldest Anatomically Modern Humans from Far Southeast Europe: Direct Dating, Culture and Behavior | first1 = Sandrine | last1= Prat | first2= Stéphane C. | last2= Péan | first3= Laurent | last3= Crépin | first4 =Dorothée G. |last4= Drucker | first5 =Simon J. | last5= Puaud | first6 =Hélène | last6=Valladas | first7= Martina |last7 =Lázničková-Galetová | first8 =Johannes | last8 =van der Plicht | first9= Alexander | last9= Yanevich |date = June 17, 2011 | publisher = plosone | accessdate =June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13846262 | title = Early human fossils unearthed in Ukraine | first = Jennifer | last = Carpenter |date = June 20, 2011 |publisher=BBC | accessdate =June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 4,500 BCE, the [[Neolithic]] [[Cucuteni-Trypillian culture|Cucuteni-Trypillian Culture]] flourished in a wide area that included parts of modern Ukraine including [[Trypillia]] and the entire [[Dnieper]]-[[Dniester]] region. During the [[Iron Age]], the land was inhabited by [[Cimmerians]], [[Scythians]], and [[Sarmatians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9066426|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070930012558/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9066426|archivedate=September 30, 2007|title=Scythian|accessdate=September 12, 2007|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (fee required)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 700&amp;nbsp;BC and 200&amp;nbsp;BC it was part of the Scythian Kingdom, or [[Scythia]].

Later, colonies of [[Ancient Greece]], [[Ancient Rome]], and the [[Byzantine Empire]], such as [[Tyras]], [[Olbia, Ukraine|Olbia]], and [[Hermonassa]], were founded, beginning in the 6th&amp;nbsp;century BC, on the northeastern shore of the [[Black Sea]], and thrived well into the 6th&amp;nbsp;century AD. The [[Goths]] stayed in the area but came under the sway of the [[Huns]] from the 370s AD. In the 7th&amp;nbsp;century AD, the territory of eastern Ukraine was the center of [[Old Great Bulgaria]]. At the end of the century, the majority of Bulgar tribes migrated in different directions, and the [[Khazars]] took over much of the land.

===Golden Age of Kiev===
&lt;!-- 800–1349 --&gt;
{{Main|Kievan Rus'}}
[[File:Vasnetsov Bapt Vladimir.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The Baptism of Grand Prince Vladimir, led to the adoption of Christianity in Kievan Rus']]

Kievan Rus' was founded by the [[Rus' people]], [[Varangians]] who first settled around [[Staraya Ladoga|Ladoga]] and [[Novgorod]], then gradually moved southward eventually reaching Kiev about 880. Kievan Rus' included the western part of modern Ukraine, Belarus, with larger part of it situated on the territory of modern Russia. According to the ''[[Primary Chronicle]]'' the Rus' elite initially consisted of [[Varangian]]s from [[Scandinavia]].

During the 10th and 11th&amp;nbsp;centuries, it became the largest and most powerful state in Europe.&lt;ref name=cia&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/up.html|title=Ukraine|accessdate=December 24, 2007|date=December 13, 2007|work=[[CIA World Factbook]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following centuries, it laid the foundation for the national identity of Ukrainians and Russians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=The Columbia Encyclopedia|edition=| year=2001–2005|article=Kievan Rus|url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/ki/KievanRu.html}}{{dead link|date=December 2010}} Retrieved on 2008-01-27.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kiev]], the capital of modern Ukraine, became the most important city of the Rus'.

During the Golden Age of Kiev, the lands of [[Kievan Rus'|Rus']] covered modern western, central and northern Ukraine, Belarus, and western Russia.  Modern eastern and southern Ukraine were inhabited by nomads and had a different history.]]
The Varangians later assimilated into the local Slavic population and became part of the Rus' first dynasty, the [[Rurik Dynasty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia&quot;/&gt; Kievan Rus' was composed of several [[principality|principalities]] ruled by the interrelated [[Rurikid]] [[Kniaz|Princes]]. The seat of Kiev, the most prestigious and influential of all principalities, became the subject of many rivalries among Rurikids as the most valuable prize in their quest for power.

The Golden Age of Kievan Rus' began with the reign of [[Vladimir the Great]] (980–1015), who [[Baptism of Kievan Rus'|turned Rus' toward Byzantine Christianity]]. During the reign of his son, [[Yaroslav the Wise]] (1019–1054), Kievan Rus' reached the zenith of its cultural development and military power.&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia&quot;/&gt; This was followed by the state's increasing fragmentation as the relative importance of regional powers rose again. After a final resurgence under the rule of [[Vladimir Monomakh]] (1113–1125) and his son [[Mstislav I of Kiev|Mstislav]] (1125–1132), Kievan Rus' finally disintegrated into separate principalities following Mstislav's death.

In the 11th and 12th centuries, constant incursions by nomadic [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribes, such as the [[Pechenegs]] and the [[Kipchaks]], caused a massive [[Human migration|migration]] of [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] populations to the safer, heavily forested regions of the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klyuch1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Klyuchevsky|first=Vasily|title=The course of the Russian history|location=v.1|url=http://www.kulichki.com/inkwell/text/special/history/kluch/kluch16.htm|isbn=5-244-00072-1|year=1987|publisher=&quot;Myslʹ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 13th&amp;nbsp;century [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion]] devastated Kievan Rus'.

===Foreign domination===
&lt;!-- 1349–1914 --&gt;
{{See also|Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Crown of the Kingdom of Poland|Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Russian Empire}}
[[File:Rzeczpospolita2nar.png|thumb|left|In the centuries following the [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Mongol invasion]], much of Ukraine was controlled by Lithuania (from the 14th&amp;nbsp;century on) and since the [[Union of Lublin]] (1569) by Poland, as seen at this outline of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] as of 1619]]

In the mid-14th&amp;nbsp;century, [[Casimir III of Poland]] gained control of Galicia-Volhynia, while the heartland of Rus', including Kiev, became the territory of the [[Gediminas]], of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, after the [[Battle on the Irpen' River]]. Following the 1386 [[Union of Krewo]], a [[dynastic union]] between Poland and Lithuania, much of what became northern Ukraine was ruled by the increasingly Slavicised local Lithuanian nobles as part of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania.

By 1569, the [[Union of Lublin]] formed the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, and a significant part of Ukrainian territory was moved from Lithuanian rule to the [[Crown of the Kingdom of Poland]], thus becoming Polish territory. Under the cultural and political pressure of [[Polonisation]], many upper-class people of Polish Ruthenia (another term for the land of Rus) converted to Catholicism and became indistinguishable from the [[Polish nobility]].&lt;ref&gt;Subtelny, p. 92–93&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the commoners, deprived of their native protectors among Rus nobility, turned for protection to the [[Cossacks]], who remained fiercely [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox]]. The Cossacks tended to turn to violence against those they perceived as enemies, particularly the Polish state and its representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-28237|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011213405/http://britannica.com/eb/article-28237|archivedate=October 11, 2007|title=Poland|accessdate=September 12, 2007|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (fee required)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-17th&amp;nbsp;century, a Cossack military quasi-state, the [[Zaporozhian Host]], was established by the [[Dnieper Cossacks]] and the Ruthenian peasants fleeing Polish [[serfdom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;zaporizhia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkPath=pages\Z\A\ZaporizhiaThe.htm|title=Zaporizhia, The|accessdate=December 16, 2007|author=Krupnytsky B. and Zhukovsky A.|work=[[Encyclopedia of Ukraine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poland had little real control of this land, yet they found the Cossacks to be a useful fighting force against the [[Ottoman Empire|Turks]] and [[Crimean Khanate|Tatars]],&lt;ref name=britcos/&gt; and at times the two allied in [[Ottoman wars in Europe|military campaigns]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.econ.hit-u.ac.jp/~areastd/mediterranean/mw/pdf/18/10.pdf The Crimean Tatars and their Russian-Captive Slaves]&quot; (PDF). Eizo Matsuki, ''Mediterranean Studies Group at Hitotsubashi University.''&lt;/ref&gt; However, the continued [[serf|enserfment]] of peasantry by the Polish nobility, emphasized by the Commonwealth's fierce exploitation of the workforce, and most importantly, the suppression of the Orthodox Church pushed the allegiances of Cossacks away from Poland.&lt;ref name=britcos&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30078/Ukraine|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071011213409/http://britannica.com/eb/article-30078/Ukraine|archivedate=October 11, 2007|title=Ukraine – The Cossacks|accessdate=September 12, 2007|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (fee required)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cossacks aspired to have representation in Polish [[Sejm#Sejm of the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth|Sejm]], recognition of Orthodox traditions and the gradual expansion of the [[Registered Cossacks|Cossack Registry]]. These were all vehemently rejected by the Polish nobility, who had power in the Sejm. The Cossacks eventually turned for protection to Orthodox [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]], a decision which would later lead towards the downfall of the Polish–Lithuanian state,&lt;ref name=&quot;zaporizhia&quot;/&gt; and the preservation of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] and in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;Magocsi, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1648, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]] led the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising|largest of the Cossack uprisings]] against the Commonwealth and the Polish king [[John II Casimir]].&lt;ref&gt;Subtelny, p. 123–124&lt;/ref&gt; [[Left-bank Ukraine]] was eventually integrated into Muscovite Russia as Rada faced the alternatives of subjection to Poland, allegiance to Turkey, or allegiance to Muscovy and chose the latter as the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] as recorded in the 1654 [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]].  There followed the [[Russo-Polish War (1654–1667)|Russo-Polish War]] which ended in 1667. After the [[partitions of Poland]] at the end of the 18th&amp;nbsp;century by [[Prussia]], [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg Austria]], and Russia, Western Ukrainian [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] was taken over by Austria.

[[File:Crimean Khanate 1600.gif|thumb|right|The [[Khanate of Crimea]] was one of the strongest powers in Eastern Europe until the end of the 17th century]]
The [[Crimean Khanate]] was one of the strongest powers in Eastern Europe until the 18th century; at one point it even succeeded, under the Crimean khan [[Devlet I Giray]], [[Crimean Tatars invasion into Russia in 1571|to devastate Moscow]]. The Russian population of the borderlands suffered annual Tatar invasions and tens of thousands of soldiers were required to protect the southern boundaries. From the beginning of the 16th century until the end of 17th century the Crimean Tatar raider bands made almost annual forays into agricultural Slavic
lands searching for captives to sell as [[Slavery (Ottoman Empire)|slaves]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://coursesa.matrix.msu.edu/~fisher/hst373/readings/inalcik6.html Halil Inalcik. &quot;Servile Labor in the Ottoman Empire&quot;] in A. Ascher, B. K. Kiraly, and T. Halasi-Kun (eds), The Mutual Effects of the Islamic and Judeo-Christian Worlds: The East European Pattern, Brooklyn College, 1979, pp. 25–43.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Orest Subtelny]], &quot;from 1450 to 1586, eighty-six [[Tatar invasions|Tatar raids]] were recorded, and from 1600 to 1647, seventy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Subtelny, Orest (1988). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=HNIs9O3EmtQC&amp;pg=PA106&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Ukraine: a history.]''&quot;. p 106&lt;/ref&gt; In 1688, Tatars captured a record number of 60,000 Ukrainians.&lt;ref&gt;Junius P. Rodriguez (1997). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=ATq5_6h2AT0C&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false The Historical encyclopedia of world slavery]''&quot;. ABC-CLIO. p.659. ISBN 0-87436-885-5&lt;/ref&gt; This was a heavy burden for the state, and slowed its social and economic development. Since Crimean Tatars did not permit settlement of Russians to southern regions where the soil is better and the season is long enough, Muscovy had to depend on poorer regions and labour-intensive agriculture. Poland-Lithuania, [[Moldavia]] and [[Wallachia]] were also subjected to extensive slave raiding. The Crimean Khanate was conquered by the Russian Empire in 1778, bringing an end to what remained of Mongol and Tatar rule in Europe.

===The Ruin===
In 1657–1686 came &quot;[[The Ruin (Ukrainian history)|The Ruin]],&quot; a devastating 30-year war amongst Russia, Poland, Turks and Cossacks for control of Ukraine, which occurred at about the same time as the [[Deluge (history)|Deluge]] of Poland. For three years, Khmelnytsky's armies controlled present-day western and central Ukraine, but, deserted by his Tatar allies, he suffered a crushing [[Battle of Berestechko|defeat at Berestechko]], and turned to the Russian tsar for help.

[[File:Marten's Poltava.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Battle of Poltava]] in 1709, as depicted by [[Denis Martens the Younger]], 1726]]
In 1654, Khmelnytsky signed the Treaty of Pereiaslav, forming a military and political alliance with Russia that acknowledged loyalty to the Czar.  The wars escalated in intensity with hundreds of thousands of deaths. Defeat came in 1686 as the &quot;[[Eternal Peace Treaty of 1686|Eternal Peace]]&quot; between Russia and Poland gave Kiev and the Cossack lands east of the Dnieper over to Russian rule and the Ukrainian lands west of the Dnieper to Poland.

In 1709 Cossack Hetman [[Ivan Mazepa]] (1687–1709) sided with Sweden against Russia in the [[Great Northern War]] (1700–1721).  Mazepa, a member of the Cossack nobility, received an excellent education abroad and proved to be a brilliant political and military leader enjoying good relations with the Romanov dynasty. After [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] became czar, Mazepa as hetman gave him more than twenty years of loyal military and diplomatic service and was well rewarded.

[[File:Kirill Razumovsky Tokke.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Kirill Razumovsky]], the last Hetman of left and right-bank Ukraine 1750–1764, was, in May 1763, the first person to ever declare Ukraine to be a sovereign state]]
Eventually Peter recognized that in order to consolidate and modernize Russia's political and economic power it was necessary to do away with the [[Cossack Hetmanate|hetmanate]] and Ukrainian and Cossack aspirations to autonomy. Mazepa accepted Polish invitations to join the Poles and Swedes against Russia. The move was disastrous for the hetmanate, Ukrainian autonomy, and Mazepa. He died in exile after fleeing from the [[Battle of Poltava]] (1709), where the Swedes and their Cossack allies suffered a catastrophic defeat at the hands of Peter's Russian forces.

The hetmanate was abolished in 1764; the [[Zaporizhian Sich|Zaporizhska Sich]] abolished in 1775, as Russia centralized control over its lands. As part of the [[Partitions of Poland|partitioning of Poland]] in 1772, 1793, and 1795, the Ukrainian lands west of the Dnieper were divided between Russia and Austria.  From 1737 to 1834, expansion into the northern Black Sea littoral and the eastern Danube valley was a cornerstone of Russian foreign policy.

Lithuanians and Poles controlled vast estates in Ukraine, and were a law unto themselves. Judicial rulings from Cracow were routinely flouted, while peasants were heavily taxed and practically tied to the land as serfs. Occasionally the landowners battled each other using armies of Ukrainian peasants. The Poles and Lithuanians were Roman Catholics and tried with some success to convert the Orthodox lesser nobility.  In 1596 they set up the &quot;Greek-Catholic&quot; or [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Uniate Church]], under the authority of the Pope but using Eastern rituals; it dominates western Ukraine to this day. Tensions between the Uniates and the Orthodox were never resolved, and the religious differentiation left the Ukrainian Orthodox peasants leaderless, as they were reluctant to follow the Ukrainian nobles.&lt;ref&gt;Reid (2000) p 27–30&lt;/ref&gt;

Cossacks led an uprising, called [[Koliyivschyna|Koliivshchyna]], starting in the Ukrainian borderlands of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1768. Ethnicity as one root cause of this revolt, which included Ukrainian [[Massacre of Uman|violence]] that killed tens of thousands of Poles and Jews. Religious warfare also broke out between Ukrainian groups. Increasing conflict between Uniate and Orthodox parishes along the newly reinforced Polish-Russian border on the Dnepr River in the time of [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine II]] set the stage for the uprising. As Uniate religious practices had become more Latinized, Orthodoxy in this region drew even closer into dependence on the Russian Orthodox Church. Confessional tensions also reflected opposing Polish and Russian political allegiances.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Skinner, &quot;Borderlands of Faith: Reconsidering the Origins of a Ukrainian Tragedy.&quot; ''Slavic Review'' 2005 64(1): 88–116.

After the Russians annexed the Crimean Khanate in 1783, the region was settled by migrants from other parts of Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/612921/Ukraine/30071/Ukraine-under-direct-imperial-Russian-rule Ukraine under direct imperial Russian rule]. ''Encyclopædia Britannica.''&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the promises of Ukrainian autonomy given by the Treaty of Pereyaslav, the Ukrainian elite and the Cossacks never received the freedoms and the autonomy they were expecting from Imperial Russia. However, within the Empire, Ukrainians rose to the highest Russian state and [[Russian Orthodox Church|church]] offices. {{Ref label|A|a|none}} At a later period, [[tsarist]]s established a policy of [[Russification]] of Ukrainian lands, suppressing the use of the Ukrainian language in print, and in public.&lt;ref name=censor&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3763/is_200703/ai_n19433957|title=Valuev Circular and Censorship of Ukrainian Publications in the Russian Empire (1863–1876)|accessdate=December 16, 2007|author=Remy, Johannes|date=March–June 2007|publisher=findarticles.com|work=Canadian Slavonic Papers}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century, World War I and revolution===
{{Main|Ukrainian War of Independence}}

[[File:Berezhany- (285) cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Symon Petliura]] led Ukraine's struggle for independence following the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]]; he is now recognised as having been the third [[President of Ukraine|President of independent Ukraine]]]]

In the 19th century, Ukraine was a rural area largely ignored by Russia and Austria. With growing urbanization and modernization, and a cultural trend toward [[romantic nationalism]], a Ukrainian intelligentsia committed to national rebirth and social justice emerged. The serf-turned-national-poet [[Taras Shevchenko]] (1814–1861) and the political theorist [[Mykhailo Drahomanov]] (1841–1895) led the growing nationalist movement.

After Ukraine and Crimea became aligned with the Russian Empire [[Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774)]], significant German immigration occurred after it was encouraged by Catherine the Great and her immediate successors.  Immigration was encouraged into Ukraine and especially the Crimea by Catherine in her proclamation of open migration to the Russian Empire.  Immigration was encouraged for [[History of Germans in Russia and the Soviet Union|Germans]] and other Europeans to thin the previously dominant Turk population and encourage more complete use of farmland.

Beginning in the 19th century, there was a continuous migration from Ukraine to settle the distant areas of the Russian Empire. According to the 1897 census, there were 223,000 ethnic Ukrainians in [[Siberia]] and 102,000 in Central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Rainer Münz, Rainer Ohliger (2003). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=xGV6gb0w914C&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Diasporas and ethnic migrants: German, Israel, and post-Soviet successor ]''&quot;. Routledge. p.164. ISBN 0-7146-5232-6&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1896 and 1906, after the construction of the trans-Siberian railway, a total of 1.6 million Ukrainians migrated eastward.&lt;ref&gt;Subtelny, Orest (2000). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=HNIs9O3EmtQC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Ukraine: a history.]''&quot;.

[[File:Voyaky unr.jpg|thumb|left|Soldiers of the [[Ukrainian People's Army]] listening to a blind [[kobzar]] [[bandura]] player]]
Nationalist and socialist parties developed in the late 19th century. Austrian [[Galicia (eastern Europe)|Galicia]], which enjoyed substantial political freedom under the relatively lenient rule of the [[Habsburgs]], became the center of the nationalist movement.

Ukrainians entered [[World War I]] on the side of both the [[Central Powers]], under Austria, and the [[Triple Entente]], under Russia. 3.5 million Ukrainians fought with the [[Military history of Imperial Russia|Imperial Russian Army]], while 250,000 fought for the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ukraine: A History|author=[[Orest Subtelny|Subtelny, Orest]]|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|year=2000|isbn=0-8020-8390-0|pages=340–344}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] authorities established the Ukrainian Legion to fight against the Russian Empire. This legion was the foundation of the [[Ukrainian Galician Army]] that fought against the Bolsheviks and Poles in the post World War I period (1919–23). Those suspected of Russophile sentiments in Austria were treated harshly. Up to 5,000 supporters of the Russian Empire from Galicia were detained and placed in Austrian internment camps in [[Talerhof]], [[Styria (state)|Styria]], and in a fortress at [[Terezín]] (now in the [[Czech Republic]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Horbal |first=Bogdan |title=Talerhof |url=http://www.rusyn.org/histalerhof.html|accessdate=January 20, 2008|publisher=The world academy of Rusyn culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When World War I ended, several empires collapsed; among them were the Russian and Austrian empires. The [[Russian Revolution of 1917]] ensued, and a Ukrainian national movement for self-determination reemerged, with heavy Communist/Socialist influence. During 1917–20, several separate Ukrainian states briefly emerged: the [[Ukrainian People's Republic]], the [[Ukrainian State|Hetmanate]], the [[Directorate of Ukraine|Directorate]] and the pro-Bolshevik [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic]] (or Soviet Ukraine) successively established territories in the former Russian Empire; while the [[West Ukrainian People's Republic]] and the [[Hutsul Republic]] emerged briefly in the former Austro-Hungarian territory. This led to civil war, and an anarchist movement called the [[The Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine|Black Army]] led by [[Nestor Makhno]] developed in Southern Ukraine during that war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkPath=pages\M\A\MakhnoNestor.htm |title=Makhno, Nestor|author=Cipko, Serge|accessdate=January 17, 2008|work=Encyclopedia of Ukraine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Children affected by famine in Berdyansk, Ukraine - 1922.jpg|thumb|Children affected by [[Droughts and famines in Russia and the USSR|famine]] in Soviet-administered southern Ukraine, [[Berdyansk]], 1922]]
However, Poland defeated Western Ukraine in the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]], but failed against the Bolsheviks in [[Kiev Offensive (1920)|an offensive against Kiev]]. According to the [[Peace of Riga]] concluded between the Soviets and [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]], western Ukraine was officially incorporated into Poland, who in turn recognised the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in March 1919. Ukraine became a founding member of the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] or the Soviet Union in December 1922.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

===Inter-war Polish Ukraine===
The war in Ukraine continued for another two years; by 1921, however, most of Ukraine had been taken over by the Soviet Union, while Galicia and Volhynia were incorporated into independent Poland.

A powerful underground Ukrainian nationalist movement rose in Poland in the 1920s and 1930s, led by the Ukrainian Military Organization and the [[Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists|Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN)]]. The movement attracted a militant following among students and harassed the Polish authorities. Legal Ukrainian parties, the Ukrainian Catholic Church, an active press, and a business sector also flourished in Poland. Economic conditions improved in the 1920s, but the region suffered from the Great Depression in the 1930s.

===Inter-war Soviet Ukraine===
&lt;!-- 1922–1939 --&gt;
[[File:Ukposter.jpg|left|thumb|Soviet recruitment poster featuring the Ukrainisation theme. The text reads: &quot;Son! Enroll in the school of [[Red Army|Red commanders]], and the defence of [[Soviet Ukraine]] will be ensured.&quot;]]

The civil war that eventually brought the Soviet government to power devastated Ukraine. It left over 1.5&amp;nbsp;million people dead and hundreds of thousands homeless. In addition, Soviet Ukraine had to face the [[Russian famine of 1921|famine of 1921]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/pages/F/A/Famine.htm Famine], ''Encyclopedia of Ukraine''&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing an exhausted Ukraine, the Soviet government remained very flexible during the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Subtelny, p. 380&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, under the aegis of the Ukrainization policy pursued by the national Communist leadership of [[Mykola Skrypnyk]], Soviet leadership encouraged a national renaissance in literature and the arts. The [[Culture of Ukraine|Ukrainian culture]] and [[Ukrainian language|language]] enjoyed a revival, as [[Ukrainisation]] became a local implementation of the Soviet-wide policy of [[Korenisation]] (literally ''indigenisation'') policy.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; The Bolsheviks were also committed to introducing [[universal health care]], education and social-security benefits, as well as the right to work and housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761572241_2/communism.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kx6hBveb|archivedate=November 1, 2009|title=Communism|accessdate=July 5, 2008|work=MSN Encarta}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Women's rights]] were greatly increased through new laws designed to wipe away centuries-old inequalities.&lt;ref&gt;Cliff, p. 138–39&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these policies were sharply reversed by the early 1930s after [[Joseph Stalin]] gradually consolidated power to become the ''de facto'' communist party leader.

The communists gave a privileged position to manual labor, the largest class in the cities, where Russians dominated. The typical worker was more attached to class identity than to ethnicity. Although there were incidents of ethnic friction among workers (in addition to Ukrainians and Russians there were significant numbers of Poles, Germans, Jews, and others in the Ukrainian workforce), industrial laborers had already adopted Russian culture and language to a significant extent. Workers whose ethnicity was Ukrainian were not attracted to campaigns of Ukrainianization or de-Russification in meaningful numbers, but remained loyal members of the Soviet working class. There was no significant antagonism between workers identifying themselves as Ukrainian or Russian.

Starting from the late 1920s, Ukraine was involved in the [[Industrialization in the USSR|Soviet industrialisation]] and the republic's industrial output quadrupled during the 1930s.&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt;

The industrialisation had a heavy cost for the peasantry, demographically a backbone of the Ukrainian nation. To satisfy the state's need for increased food supplies and to finance industrialisation, Stalin instituted a [[Collectivisation in the USSR|program of collectivisation]] of agriculture as the state combined the peasants' lands and animals into collective farms and enforced the policies by the regular troops and [[Cheka|secret police]].&lt;ref name=Britannica/&gt; Those who resisted were [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|arrested and deported]] and the increased production quotas were placed on the peasantry. The collectivisation had a devastating effect on agricultural productivity. As the members of the collective farms were not allowed to receive any grain until sometimes unrealistic quotas were met, [[starvation]] in the Soviet Union became more common. In 1932–33, millions starved to death in a [[Droughts and famines in Russia and the Soviet Union|famine]] known as [[Holodomor]] or &quot;Great Famine&quot;.{{Ref label|C|c|1}} Scholars are divided as to whether this famine fits the definition of [[genocide]], but the [[Ukrainian parliament]] and other countries recognise it as such.{{Ref label|C|c|2}}

[[File:DneproGES.jpg|thumb|left|[[Dnieper Hydroelectric Station|DniproHES]] hydroelectric power plant under construction circa 1930]]
The famine claimed up to 10 million of Ukrainian lives as peasants' food stocks were forcibly removed by the Soviet government by the [[NKVD]] secret police. Some explanations for the causes for the excess deaths in rural areas of Ukraine and Kazakhstan during 1931–34 has been given by dividing the causes into three groups: objective non-policy-related factors, like the drought of 1931 and poor weather in 1932; inadvertent result of policies with other objectives, like rapid industrialization, socialization of livestock, and neglected crop rotation patterns; and deaths caused intentionally by a starvation policy. The Communist leadership perceived famine not as a humanitarian catastrophe but as a means of class struggle and used starvation as a punishment tool to force peasants into collective farms.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Ellman, &quot;The Role of Leadership Perceptions and of Intent in the Soviet Famine of 1931–1934.&quot; ''Europe-Asia Studies'' 2005 57(6): 823–841. Issn: 0966-8136 Fulltext in [[Ebsco]]&lt;/ref&gt;
It was largely the same groups of individuals who were responsible for the mass killing operations during the civil war, collectivisation, and the [[Great Purge|Great Terror]]. These groups were associated with Efim Georgievich Evdokimov (1891–1939) and operated in Ukraine during the civil war, in the North Caucasus in the 1920s, and in the Secret Operational Division within General State Political Administration (OGPU) in 1929–31. Evdokimov transferred into Communist Party administration in 1934, when he became Party secretary for North Caucasus Krai. But he appears to have continued advising Joseph Stalin and [[Nikolai Yezhov]] on security matters, and the latter relied on Evdokimov's former colleagues to carry out the mass killing operations that are known as the Great Terror in 1937–38.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen G.

With Joseph Stalin's change of course in the late 1920s, however, Moscow's toleration of Ukrainian national identity came to an end. Systematic state terror of the 1930s destroyed Ukraine's writers, artists, and intellectuals; the Communist Party of Ukraine was purged of its &quot;nationalist deviationists&quot;.  Two waves of Stalinist political repression and persecution in the Soviet Union (1929–34 and 1936–38) resulted in the killing of some 681,692 people; this included four-fifths of the Ukrainian cultural elite and three-quarters of all the [[Red Army]]'s higher-ranking officers.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30078/Ukraine|title=Interwar Soviet Ukraine|accessdate=September 12, 2007|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (fee required)}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|B|b|none}}

===World War II===
&lt;!-- 1939–1945 --&gt;
{{See also|Eastern Front (World War II)}}
[[File:Ruined Kiev in WWII.jpg|thumb|left|[[Kiev]] suffered significant damage during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]], and was occupied by [[Nazi Germany]] from September 19, 1941 until November 6, 1943]]
Following the [[Invasion of Poland]] in September 1939, [[Nazi Germany|German]] and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] troops divided the territory of Poland. Thus, Eastern [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Volhynia]] with their Ukrainian population became reunited with the rest of Ukraine. The unification that Ukraine achieved for the first time in its history was a decisive event in the history of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Subtelny, p. 487&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, [[Romania]] ceded [[Bessarabia]] and northern [[Bukovina]] in response to [[June 1940 Soviet Ultimatum|Soviet demands]]. The Ukrainian SSR incorporated northern and southern districts of Bessarabia, northern Bukovina, and the [[Hertsa region]]. But it ceded the western part of the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]] to the newly created [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]]. All these territorial gains were internationally recognised by the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Paris peace treaties of 1947]].

[[File:Dayosh Kiev.jpg|thumb|right|[[Soviet Army|Soviet soldiers]] preparing rafts to cross the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] (the sign reads &quot;Give me Kiev!&quot;) in the 1943 [[Battle of the Dnieper]]]]
[[Wehrmacht|German armies]] [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] on June 22, 1941, thereby initiating four straight years of incessant [[total war]]. The [[Axis Powers|Axis]] allies initially advanced against desperate but unsuccessful efforts of the Red Army. In the encirclement battle of [[Kiev]], the city was acclaimed as a &quot;[[Hero City]]&quot;, because the [[Battle of Kiev (1941)|resistance]] by the Red Army and by the local population was fierce. More than 600,000 Soviet soldiers (or one-quarter of the [[Soviet Western Front|Western Front]]) were killed or [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|taken captive]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Roberts, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Boshyk, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Using [[guerilla war]] tactics, the insurgents targeted for assassination and terror those who they perceived as representing, or cooperating at any level with, the Soviet state.&lt;ref&gt;Piotrowski p. 352–54&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Weiner p.127–237&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time [[Ukrainian Liberation Army|another nationalist movement]] fought alongside the Nazis.

Initially, the Germans were even hailed as liberators by some western Ukrainians, who had only joined the Soviet Union in 1939. However, brutal German rule in the occupied territories eventually turned its supporters against the occupation. Nazi administrators of conquered Soviet territories made little attempt to exploit the population of Ukrainian territories' dissatisfaction with Stalinist political and economic policies.&lt;ref name=ww2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30082|title=Ukraine – World War II and its aftermath|accessdate=December 28, 2007|work=Encyclopædia Britannica (fee required)}}{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the Nazis preserved the collective-farm system, systematically carried out [[Mass graves in the Soviet Union|genocidal policies]] against [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Jews]], [[OST-Arbeiter|deported others to work in Germany]], and began a systematic depopulation of Ukraine (along with Poland) to prepare it for German colonisation,&lt;ref name=ww2/&gt; which included a food blockade on Kiev.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karel C.

In 1945, the Ukrainian SSR became one of the founding members of the [[United Nations]] organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;un ukssr&quot;/&gt; The first Soviet computer, [[MESM]], was built at the [[Kiev Institute of Electrotechnology]] and became operational in 1950.

Postwar [[ethnic cleansing]] occurred in the newly expanded Soviet Union.

Following the death of Stalin in 1953, [[Nikita Khrushchev]] became the new leader of the USSR. Having served as First Secretary of the [[Communist Party (Bolsheviks) of Ukraine|Communist Party of Ukrainian SSR]] in 1938–49, Khrushchev was intimately familiar with the republic; after taking power union-wide, he began to emphasize the friendship between the Ukrainian and Russian nations. In 1954, the 300th anniversary of the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] was widely celebrated, and in particular, [[Crimea]] was transferred from the [[Russian SFSR]] to the [[Ukrainian SSR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iccrimea.org/historical/crimeatransfer.html|title=The Transfer of Crimea to Ukraine|accessdate=March 25, 2007|year=2005|month=July|work=International Committee for Crimea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet Ukraine soon became a European leader in industrial production,&lt;ref&gt;Magocsi, p. 644&lt;/ref&gt; and  an important center of the Soviet [[arms industry]] and high-tech research. Such an important role resulted in a major influence of the local elite.

===Historical maps of Ukraine===
The Ukrainian state has occupied a number of territories since its initial foundation. Most of these territories have been located within Eastern Europe, however, as depicted in the maps in the gallery below, has also at times extended well into Eurasia and South-Eastern Europe.
At times there has also been a distinct lack of a Ukrainian state, as its territories were on a number of occasions, annexed by its more powerful neighbours.

At {{convert|603700|km2|sqmi}} and with a coastline of {{convert|2782|km|mi}}, Ukraine is the world's [[List of countries and outlying territories by area|44th-largest country]] (after the [[Central African Republic]], before [[Madagascar]]). It is the largest wholly European country and the [[Europe#Territories and regions|second largest country]] in Europe (after the European part of Russia, before [[metropolitan France]]).{{Ref label|I|i|none}}&lt;ref name=&quot;cia&quot;/&gt; It lies between latitudes [[44th parallel north|44°]] and [[53rd parallel north|53° N]], and longitudes [[22nd meridian east|22°]] and [[41st meridian east|41° E]].

The Ukrainian landscape consists mostly of fertile plains (or [[steppes]]) and plateaus, crossed by rivers such as the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]] ({{lang|uk-Latn|''Dnipro''}}), [[Seversky Donets]], [[Dniester]] and the [[Southern Bug|Southern Buh]] as they flow south into the [[Black Sea]] and the smaller [[Sea of Azov]]. To the southwest, the [[Danube Delta|delta]] of the [[Danube]] forms the border with Romania. Its various regions have diverse geographic features ranging from the highlands to the lowlands. The country's only mountains are the [[Carpathian Mountains]] in the west, of which the highest is the [[Hora Hoverla]] at {{convert|2061|m}}, and the [[Crimean Mountains]] on the [[Crimea]]n peninsula, in the extreme south along the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30093/Ukraine|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080115052701/http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30093/Ukraine|archivedate=January 15, 2008|title=Ukraine – Relief|accessdate=December 27, 2007|work=Encyclopædia Britannica (fee required)}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Ukraine also has a number of highland regions such as  the Volyn-Podillia Upland (in the west) and the Near-Dnipro Upland (on the right bank of Dnieper); to the east there are the south-western spurs of the Central Russian Uplands over which runs the border with Russia. Near the Sea of Azov can be found the Donets Ridge and the Near Azov Upland. The [[snow melt]] from the mountains feeds the rivers, and natural changes in altitude form a sudden drop in elevation and create many opportunities to form [[waterfalls of Ukraine|waterfalls]].

Significant natural resources in Ukraine include iron ore, coal, manganese, natural gas, oil, salt, sulfur, graphite, titanium, magnesium, kaolin, nickel, mercury, timber and an abundance of arable land. Despite this, the country faces a number of major environmental issues such as inadequate supplies of potable water; air and water pollution and deforestation, as well as radiation contamination in the north-east from the [[Chernobyl disaster|1986 accident at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]]. [[Hazardous Waste Recycling|Recycling toxic household waste]] is still in its infancy in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/118498/ Environment suffers from lack of recycling], [[Kyiv Post]] (December 9, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regionalism===
There are not only clear regional differences on questions of identity but historical cleavages remain evident at the level of individual social identification. Attitudes toward the most important political issue, relations with [[Russia]], differed strongly between [[Lviv]], identifying more with [[Ukrainian nationalism]] and the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], and [[Donetsk]], predominantly Russian orientated and favorable to the [[Soviet era]], while in central and southern Ukraine, as well as [[Kiev]], such divisions were less important and there was less antipathy toward people from other regions (a poll by the [[Research &amp; Branding Group]] held March 2010 showed that the attitude of the citizens of Donetsk to the citizens of Lviv was 79% positive and that the attitude of the citizens of Lviv to the citizens of Donetsk was 88% positive&lt;ref name=antipathy/&gt;). However, all were united by an overarching Ukrainian identity based on shared economic difficulties, showing that other attitudes are determined more by culture and politics than by demographic differences.&lt;ref name=antipathy&gt;[http://www.rb.com.ua/eng/politics/research/2010/4613.html UKRAINE.

===Biodiversity===
Ukraine is home to a very wide range of animals, fungi, micro-organisms and plants.

Ukraine is divided into two main zoological areas. One of these areas, in the west of the country, is made up of the borderlands of Europe, where there are species typical of mixed forests, the other is located in eastern Ukraine, where steppe-dwelling species thrive. In the forested areas of the country it is not uncommon to find lynxes, wolves, wild boar and martens, as well as many other similar species; this is especially true of the Carpathian mountains, where a large number of predatory mammals make their home, as well as a contingent of brown bears. Around Ukraine's lakes and rivers beavers, otters and mink make their home, whilst within, carp, bream and catfish are the most commonly found species of fish. In the central and eastern parts of the country, rodents such as hamsters and gophers are found in large numbers.

====Fungi====
More than 6600 species of fungi (including [[lichen]]-forming species) have been recorded from Ukraine.,&lt;ref&gt;D.W. Minter and Dudka, I.O. &quot;Fungi of Ukraine – a preliminary checklist&quot;.

The true total number of fungal species occurring in Ukraine, including species not yet recorded, is likely to be far higher, given the generally accepted estimate that only about 7% of all fungi worldwide have so far been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Kirk, P.M., Cannon, P.F., Minter, D.W. and Stalpers, J. &quot;Dictionary of the Fungi&quot;.

{{Main|Politics of Ukraine|Government of Ukraine|Elections in Ukraine}}
Ukraine is a republic under a mixed semi-parliamentary [[semi-presidential system]] with separate [[legislative branch|legislative]], [[executive branch|executive]], and [[judicial branch]]es.

===The Constitution of Ukraine===
{{Main|Constitution of Ukraine}}
With the proclamation of its independence on August 24, 1991, and adoption of a constitution on June 28, 1996, Ukraine became a semi-presidential republic. However, in 2004, deputies introduced changes to the Constitution, which tipped the balance of power in favour parliament. From 2004 to 2010, the legitimacy of the 2004 Constitutional amendments had official sanction, both with the Constitutional Court of Ukraine, and most major political parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;1oct&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Віталій Портников |url=http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/2174109.html |title=Vitaly Portnykov. &quot;Comment on the Constitutional Court of Ukraine on elimination of political reform in 2004 for Radio Liberty asked Nicholas Onischuk, former Justice Minister&amp;nbsp;...

The ruling on the 2004 Constitutional amendments has become a major topic of political discourse. Much of the concern has been due to the fact that neither the Constitution of 1996 nor the Constitution of 2004 provides the ability to &quot;undo the Constitution&quot;, as the decision of the Constitutional Court would have it, even though the 2004 constitution arguably has an exhaustive list of possible procedures for constitutional amendments (articles 154–159). In any case, the current Constitution can arguably be modified only by a vote in Parliament.&lt;ref name=&quot;1oct&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tymoshenko.ua/en/article/3o3zxoz9 |title=Address Tymoshenko to the people: &quot;October 1, 2010 – marks the end of Ukraine’s democracy and beginning of dictatorship&quot;.

[[File:Viktor Yanukovych portrait.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Viktor Yanukovych]], the president of Ukraine since 2010]]

Ukraine's legislative branch includes the 450-seat [[unicameral]] parliament, the [[Verkhovna Rada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.rada.gov.ua/|title=Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine|accessdate=December 24, 2007|work=[[Verkhovna Rada|Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine]] Official Web-site}}&lt;/ref&gt; The parliament is primarily responsible for the formation of the executive branch and the [[Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine|Cabinet of Ministers]], which is headed by the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine|Prime Minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Ukraine|title=Constitution of Ukraine|accessdate=December 24, 2007|work=[[Wikisource]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the President still retains the authority to nominate the Ministers of the Foreign Affairs and of Defence for parliamentary approval, as well as the power to appoint the [[Prosecutor General of Ukraine|Prosecutor General]] and the head of the [[Security Service of Ukraine|Security Service]].
[[File:Verkhovna Rada main session hall.jpg|thumb|The session chamber of the [[Verkhovna Rada]], the Parliament of Ukraine]]

Laws, acts of the parliament and the cabinet, presidential decrees, and acts of the [[Verkhovna Rada of Crimea|Crimean parliament]] may be abrogated by the [[Constitutional Court of Ukraine|Constitutional Court]], should they be found to violate the constitution. Other normative acts are subject to judicial review. The [[Supreme Court of Ukraine|Supreme Court]] is the main body in the system of courts of general jurisdiction.
Local self-government is officially guaranteed. Local councils and city mayors are popularly elected and exercise control over local budgets. The heads of regional and district administrations are appointed by the President in accordance with the proposals of the Prime-Minister. This system virtually requires an agreement between the President and the Prime-Minister, and has in the past led to problems, such as when President Yushchenko used a legally controversial ways to evade the law by appointing no actual governors or the local leaders, but so called 'temporarily acting' officers, thus evading the need to seek a compromise with the Prime-Minister. This practice was very controversial and required review by the Constitutional Court.

Ukraine has a large number of political parties, many of which have tiny memberships and are unknown to the general public. Small parties often join in multi-party coalitions (electoral blocs) for the purpose of participating in parliamentary elections.

===Courts and law enforcement===
{{Main|Judicial system of Ukraine|Law enforcement in Ukraine}}
The courts enjoy legal, financial and constitutional freedom guaranteed by measures adopted in Ukrainian law in 2002. Judges are largely well protected from dismissal (except in the instance of gross misconduct). Court justices are appointed by presidential decree for an initial period of five years, after which Ukraine's Supreme Council confirms their positions for life in an attempt to insulate them from politics. Although there are still problems with the performance of the system, it is considered to have been much improved since Ukraine's independence in 1991. The Supreme Court is regarded as being an independent and impartial body, and has on several occasions ruled against the Ukrainian government.

Law enforcement agencies in Ukraine are typically organised under the authority of the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs of Ukraine|Ministry of Internal Affairs]]. They consist primarily of the national police force ''(Мiлiцiя)'' and various specialised units and agencies such as the [[State Border Guard Service of Ukraine|State Border Guard]] and the [[Ukrainian Sea Guard|Coast Guard]] services. In recent years the law enforcement agencies, particularly the police, have faced criticism for their heavy handling of the 2004 [[Orange Revolution]], this criticism stems from the use by the [[Leonid Kuchma|Kuchma]] government's contemplated use of [[Berkut (Ukraine)|Berkut]] special operations units and [[Internal Troops of Ukraine|internal troops]] in a plan to put an end to demonstrations on [[Kiev]]'s [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]]. The actions of the government saw many thousands of police officers mobilised and stationed throughout the capital, primarily to dissuade protesters from challenging the state's authority but also to provide a quick reaction force in case of need; most officers were armed and another 10,000 were held in reserve nearby.&lt;ref name=NYTSBU&gt;C. J. Chivers, [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0913FF395C0C748DDDA80894DD404482 BACK CHANNELS: A Crackdown Averted; How Top Spies in Ukraine Changed the Nation's Path], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 17, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloodshed was only avoided when Lt. Gen. [[Sergei Popkov]] heeded his colleagues' calls to withdraw.

The Ministry of Internal Affairs is also responsible for the maintenance of the [[Security Service of Ukraine|State Security Service]]; Ukraine's domestic intelligence agency, which has on occasion been accused of acting like a [[secret police]] force serving to protect the country's political elite from media criticism. On the other hand however, it is widely accepted that members of the service provided vital information about government plans to the leaders of the Orange Revolution in order to prevent the collapse of the movement.

===Foreign relations===
{{Main|Foreign relations of Ukraine|International membership of Ukraine|Ukraine and the European Union}}
[[File:Yanukovych with Merkel.jpg|thumb|left|President [[Yanukovych]] meets German chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] in Berlin]]
In 1999–2001, Ukraine served as a non-permanent member of the [[UN Security Council]]. Historically, Soviet Ukraine joined the United Nations in 1945 as one of the original members following a Western compromise with the Soviet Union, which had asked for seats for all 15 of its union republics. Ukraine has consistently supported peaceful, negotiated settlements to disputes. It has participated in the quadripartite talks on the conflict in Moldova and promoted a peaceful resolution to conflict in the post-Soviet state of Georgia. Ukraine also has made a substantial contribution to UN [[peacekeeping]] operations since 1992.

[[Image:Komorowski&amp;Azarow.jpg|thumb|right|Prime minister [[Mykola Azarov]] (right) meets with President of Poland [[Bronisław Komorowski]] for talks in Warsaw]]
Ukraine currently considers Euro-Atlantic integration its primary foreign policy objective, but in practice balances its relationship with the European Union and the United States with strong ties to Russia. The [[European Union]]'s Partnership and Cooperation Agreement (PCA) with Ukraine went into force on March 1, 1998. The European Union (EU) has encouraged Ukraine to implement the PCA fully before discussions begin on an association agreement. The EU Common Strategy toward Ukraine, issued at the EU Summit in December 1999 in [[Helsinki]], recognizes Ukraine's long-term aspirations but does not discuss association. On January 31, 1992, Ukraine joined the then-Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe (now the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]]—OSCE), and on March 10, 1992, it became a member of the [[North Atlantic Cooperation Council]]. Ukraine also has a close relationship with [[NATO]] and had previously  declared interest in eventual membership, this however was removed from the government's foreign policy agenda, upon election of [[Viktor Yanukovych]] to the presidency, in 2010. It is the most active member of the [[Partnership for Peace]] (PfP). All major political parties in Ukraine support full eventual  integration into the European Union. The Association Agreement with the EU was expected to be signed into effect by the end of 2011, but the process has been suspended as of 2012 due to recent political developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/116043/ | title=Teixeira: Ukraine's EU integration suspended, association agreement unlikely to be signed | publisher=[[Interfax]] | date=2012-08-31 | accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ukraine maintains peaceful and constructive relations with all its neighbours; it has especially close ties with [[Russia]] and [[Poland]], although relations with the former are complicated by energy dependence and payment arrears.

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Administrative divisions of Ukraine|Ukrainian historical regions}}
The system of Ukrainian subdivisions reflects the country's status as a [[unitary state]] (as stated in the country's constitution) with unified legal and [[Local government|administrative]] regimes for each unit.

Ukraine is subdivided into twenty-four [[oblast]]s (provinces) and one [[autonomous republic]] ({{lang|uk-Latn|''avtonomna respublika''}}), [[Crimea]]. Additionally, the cities of [[Kiev]], the capital, and [[Sevastopol]], both have a special legal status. The 24 oblasts and Crimea are subdivided into 490 {{lang|uk-Latn|''[[raion]]s''}} (districts), or second-level administrative units. The average area of a Ukrainian raion is {{convert|1200|km2|sqmi}}; the average population of a raion is 52,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;oblasts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gska2.rada.gov.ua:7777/pls/z7502/a002|title=Regions of Ukraine and their divisions|accessdate=December 24, 2007|work=[[Verkhovna Rada|Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine]] Official Web-site|language=Ukrainian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Urban areas (cities) can either be subordinated to the state (as in the case of Kiev and Sevastopol), the oblast or {{lang|uk-Latn|''raion''}} administrations, depending on their population and socio-economic importance. Lower administrative units include [[urban-type settlement]]s, which are similar to rural communities, but are more urbanized, including industrial enterprises, educational facilities, and transport connections, and villages.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Ukraine inherited a 780,000-man military force on its territory, equipped with the third-largest [[nuclear weapons and Ukraine|nuclear weapons arsenal]] in the world.&lt;ref name=milgov/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/ukraine/index.html|title=Ukraine Special Weapons|accessdate=December 24, 2007|work=globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1992, Ukraine signed the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START) in which the country agreed to give up all nuclear weapons to Russia for disposal and to join the [[Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty]] as a non-nuclear weapon state. Ukraine ratified the treaty in 1994, and by 1996 the country became free of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=milgov&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mil.gov.ua/index.php?lang=en&amp;part=history&amp;sub=history|title=The history of the Armed Forces of Ukraine|accessdate=July 5, 2008|publisher=The [[Ministry of Defence of Ukraine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ukraine took consistent steps toward reduction of conventional weapons. It signed the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]], which called for reduction of tanks, artillery, and armoured vehicles (army forces were reduced to 300,000). The country plans to convert the current [[conscript]]-based military into a professional [[volunteer military]] not later than in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;wbook06&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mil.gov.ua/files/white_book_eng2006.pdf|title=White Book 2006|accessdate=December 24, 2007|format=PDF|work=Ministry of Defense of Ukraine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The total Ukrainian military deployment around the world is 562 servicemen.&lt;ref&gt;

Military units of other states participate in multinational military exercises with Ukrainian forces in Ukraine regularly, including [[U.S. military]] forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/politics/detail/67094 Parliament approves admission of military units of foreign states to Ukraine for exercises], Kyiv Post (May 18, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, the government was leaning towards NATO, and a deeper cooperation with the alliance was set by the NATO-Ukraine Action Plan signed in 2002.

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Ukraine}}

In Soviet times, the economy of Ukraine was the second largest in the Soviet Union, being an important industrial and agricultural component of the country’s [[planned economy]].&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; With the dissolution of the Soviet system, the country moved from a planned economy to a [[market economy]]. The transition process was difficult for the majority of the population which plunged into poverty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/966616.stm Child poverty soars in eastern Europe], BBC News, 11 October 2000. Retrieved on 12-01-2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Ukraine’s economy contracted severely following the years after the Soviet dissolution. Day to day life for the average person living in Ukraine was a struggle. A significant number of citizens in rural Ukraine survived by growing their own food, often working two or more jobs and buying the basic necessities through the [[barter economy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-30078/Ukraine|title=Independent Ukraine|accessdate=12 September 2007|work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] (fee required)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the government liberalised most prices to combat widespread product shortages, and was successful in overcoming the problem. At the same time, the government continued to subsidise state-run industries and agriculture by uncovered monetary emission. The loose monetary policies of the early 1990s pushed inflation to [[hyperinflation]]ary levels. For the year 1993, Ukraine holds the world record for inflation in one calendar year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mw.ua/2000/2040/54367/ Skolotiany, Yuriy, The past and the future of Ukrainian national currency], Interview with Anatoliy Halchynsky, ''[[Mirror Weekly]]'', #33(612), 2 – 8 September 2006.

Prices stabilised only after the introduction of new currency, the [[Ukrainian hryvnia|hryvnia]], in 1996.

The country was also slow in implementing structural reforms. Following independence, the government formed a legal framework for [[privatisation]]. However, widespread resistance to reforms within the government and from a significant part of the population soon stalled the reform efforts. A large number of state-owned enterprises were exempt from the privatisation process.

In the meantime, by 1999, the GDP had fallen to less than 40&amp;nbsp;percent of the 1991 level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/docs/factbook/print/up.html|title=CIA World Factbook – Ukraine. 2002 edition|accessdate=5 July 2008 |work=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; It recovered considerably in the following years, but still doesn't reach historical maximum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/ukraine/gdp#NY.GDP.MKTP.PP.KD|title=Ukraine - gdp|accessdate=15 July 2012|work=Index Mundi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s, the economy showed strong export-based growth of 5 to 10&amp;nbsp;percent, with industrial production growing more than 10&amp;nbsp;percent per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact2004/geos/up.html|title=CIA World Factbook – Ukraine. 2004 edition|accessdate=5 July 2008|work=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukraine was hit by the [[economic crisis of 2008]] and in November 2008, the IMF approved a stand-by loan of $16.5 billion for the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfax.com.ua/eng/main/3243/ Head of IMF’s Resident Representative Office in Ukraine to change his job], [[Interfax|Interfax-Ukraine]] (Retrieved on 17-12-2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ukraine is regarded as being a developing economy with high potential for future success, however such a development is thought to be likely only with new all-encompassing economic and legal reforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ascent-ag.ch/files/inside/ukraine/Growth%20Potential%20of%20the%20Ukrainian%20Economy%20-%20Derrer.pdf |title=waghid1neu |format=PDF |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Foreign Direct Investment]] in Ukraine has remained relatively strong ever since [[Early 1990s recession|recession of the early 1990s]], the country has had trouble maintaining stable economic growth. Issues relating to current corporate governance in Ukraine are primarily linked to the large scale monopolisation of traditional heavy industries by wealthy individuals such as [[Rinat Akhmetov]], the enduring failure to broaden the nation’s economic base and a lack of effective legal protection for investors and their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/89520/ |title=U.S. embassy: Ukraine could again be put on list of copyright violators |publisher=Kyivpost.com |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all this, Ukraine’s economy is still expected to grow by around 3.5% in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/business/bus_general/detail/55329/ |title=Ukraine’s economic growth to resume in 2010, unemployment to be high |publisher=Kyivpost.com |date=17 December 2009 |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Motorway Kharkive-Dnipropetrovs'k.jpg|left|thumb|The Kharkiv-Dnipropetrovsk motorway]]
Most of the Ukrainian road system has not been upgraded since the Soviet era, and is now outdated. The Ukrainian government has pledged to build some {{convert|4500|km|mi|abbr=on}} of motorways by 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mihir|last=Bose|title=The long road to Kiev|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/thereporters/mihirbose/2008/07/uefa_is_happy_with_the.html|publisher=BBC|date=7 July 2008|accessdate=29 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, Ukrainian paved roads stretch for {{convert|164732|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; The network of major routes, marked with the letter ‘M’ for ‘International’   ''([[Ukrainian Language|Ukrainian]]: Міжнародний''), extends nationwide and connects all the major cities of Ukraine as well as providing cross-border routes to the country’s neighbours. Currently there are only two true motorway standard highways in Ukraine; a 175&amp;nbsp;km stretch of motorway from [[Kharkiv]] to [[Dnipropetrovsk]], and a section of the M03 which extends {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} from [[Kiev]] to [[Boryspil]], where the city’s [[Boryspil Airport|international airport]] is located.

[[File:VL40U-1025-1-Odesa-Ukraine.jpg|thumb|[[Ukrainian Railways|Rail transport]] is heavily utilised in Ukraine]]
Rail transport in Ukraine plays the role of connecting all major urban areas, port facilities and [[industry|industrial centres]] with neighbouring countries. The heaviest concentration of [[railroad track]] is located in the [[Donbas]] region of Ukraine. Although the amount of [[freight]] transported by rail fell by 7.4&amp;nbsp;percent in 1995 in comparison with 1994, Ukraine is still one of the [[rail usage statistics by country|world’s highest rail users]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps3997/9510uktn.htm|title=Transportation in Ukraine|accessdate=22 December 2007|work= U.S. Government Printing Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total amount of railroad track in Ukraine extends for {{convert|22473|km|mi}}, of which {{convert|9250|km|mi}} is electrified.&lt;ref name=cia/&gt; Currently the state has a monopoly on the provision of passenger rail transport, and all trains, other than those with cooperation of other foreign companies on international routes, are operated by its company ‘[[Ukrainian Railways|Ukrzaliznytsia]]’.

The aviation section in Ukraine is developing very quickly, having recently established a visa-free program for EU nationals and citizens of a number of other Western nations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrconsul.org/visa/visa_drops.htm |title=Consulate General of Ukraine |publisher=Ukrconsul.org |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the nation’s aviation sector is handling a significantly increased number of travellers. Additionally, the granting of the [[Euro 2012]] football tournament to Poland and Ukraine as joint hosts has prompted the government to invest huge amounts of money into transport infrastructure, and in particular airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefaeuro2012/news/newsid=1520657.html |title=Kharkiv airport gets new terminal on |publisher=UEFA  |date=28 August 2010 |accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boryspil Terminal D.jpg|left|thumb|[[Boryspil International Airport|Kiev Boryspil Airport]]'s Terminal D]]
[[Boryspil International Airport|Kiev Boryspil]] is the county's largest international airport; it has a total of three main passenger terminals and is the base for both of Ukraine's national airlines. Other large airports in the country include those in [[Kharkiv International Airport|Kharkiv]], [[Lviv International Airport|Lviv]] and [[Donetsk International Airport|Donetsk]] - all of which have recently-constructed, modern terminals and aviation facilities, whilst those in [[Dnipropetrovsk International Airport|Dnipropetrovsk]] and [[Odessa International Airport|Odessa]] have plans for terminal upgrades in the near future. Ukraine has a number of airlines, the largest of which are the nation’s [[flag carrier]]s, [[Aerosvit]] and [[Ukraine International Airlines|UIA]]. [[Antonov Airlines]], a subsidiary of the [[Antonov|Antonov Aerospace Design Bureau]] is the only operator of the world’s largest fixed wing aircraft, the [[An-225]].

Maritime transport is mainly riverine, with passenger services mainly provided on the [[Dnieper]], [[Danube]] and [[Pripyat River|Pripyat]] rivers, as well as a number of their tributaries. Most large cities have a river port and cater for the embarkation and disembarkation of passengers as well as the loading and unloading of freight and raw materials. International maritime travel is mainly provided through the [[Port of Odessa]], from where ferries sail regularly to [[Istanbul]], [[Varna]] and [[Haifa]]. The largest ferry company presently operating these routes is Ukrferry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrferry.com/ |title=Судоходная компания Укрферри.

===Energy===
{{Main|Nuclear power in Ukraine}}
[[File:РАЭС туман Украина.jpg|right|thumb|[[Rivne Nuclear Power Plant|Rivne Nuclear Station]] in Western Ukraine]]
Ukraine is one of Europe’s largest [[Electricity|energy]] consumers; it consumes almost double the energy of Germany, per unit of GDP.&lt;ref name=eia&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Ukraine/Full.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080327092522/http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/cabs/Ukraine/Full.html|archivedate=27 March 2008|title=Ukraine|accessdate=22 December 2007|work=[[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA)|publisher=US government}}&lt;/ref&gt; A great share of energy supply in Ukraine comes from [[nuclear power]], with the country receiving most of its nuclear fuel from Russia. The remaining oil and [[natural gas|gas]], is also imported from the former Soviet Union. Ukraine is heavily dependent on its nuclear power. The largest [[nuclear power plant]] in Europe, the [[Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant]], is located in Ukraine.

In 2006, the government planned to build 11 new [[Nuclear reactor|reactors]] by the year 2030, in effect, almost doubling the current amount of nuclear power capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nuclear UA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://world-nuclear.org/info/inf46.html|title=Nuclear Power in Ukraine|accessdate=22 December 2007|publisher=World Nuclear Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ukraine’s power sector is the twelfth-largest in the world in terms of installed capacity, with 54&amp;nbsp;gigawatts (GW).&lt;ref name=eia/&gt; In 2007 47.4% of power came from coal and gas (approx 20% gas), 47.5% from nuclear (92.5 TWh) and 5% from hydro.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nuclear UA&quot;/&gt;

Currently the country has four active nuclear power stations, located in [[Rivne Nuclear Power Plant|Kuznetsovsk]], [[Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant|Enerhodar]], [[South Ukraine Nuclear Power Plant|Yuzhnoukrainsk]] and [[Khmelnitskiy Nuclear Power Plant|Netishyn]]. In addition to these active plants, a fifth [[Crimean Atomic Energy Station|reactor complex]] had been planned for the [[Crimea]], but construction was suspended indefinitely in the wake of the [[Chernobyl disaster]], a major nuclear incident which took place at the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant|Chernobyl Atomic Energy Station]], {{convert|110|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Kiev.

All of Ukraine’s RBMK reactors (the type involved in the Chernobyl disaster), were located at the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. All of the reactors there have been shut down leaving only VVER reactors operating in the country, which are much safer than RBMK units. Three of these new-type reactors were built since 1991 in the independent Ukraine (with the first one in 1995), whilst the other sixteen were inherited from the Soviet Union.

The Economic Bank for Reconstruction and Development estimates that Ukraine has great renewable energy potential: the technical potential for wind energy is estimated at 40 TWh/year, small hydro at 8.3 TWh/year, biomass at 120 TWh/year, and solar energy at 50 TWh/year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/business/bus_focus/detail/121743#ixzz1ltLHXGVb ]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Mykyta Konstantinov, director of the strategic policy, investment and nuclear energy complex department at the [[Ministry of Fuel and Energy (Ukraine)|Ministry of Energy and Coal Mining Industry of Ukraine]], said that the installed capacity of alternative and renewable energy sources will increase to 9% (about 6 GW) of the total electricity production in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=14:53 |url=http://www.ukrinform.ua/eng/news/9_of_electricity_will_be_received_from_renewable_sources_in_2030?goback=.gde_2326359_member_103982024 |title=9% of electricity will be received from renewable sources in 2030|publisher=Ukrinform.ua |date=2012-03-27 |accessdate=2012-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ukraine is a destination on the crossroads between [[central Europe|central]] and eastern Europe, between north and south. It has mountain ranges – the [[Carpathian Mountains]] suitable for [[skiing]], hiking, fishing and hunting. The coastline on the [[Black Sea]] is a popular summer destination for vacationers. [[Ukrainian wine|Ukraine has]] [[vineyard]]s where they produce native wines,  ruins of ancient castles, historical parks, Orthodox and Catholic churches as well as a few mosques and synagogues. [[Kiev]], the country’s capital city has many unique structures such as [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|Saint Sophia Cathedral]] and broad boulevards.  There are other cities well-known to tourists such as the harbour town [[Odessa]] and the old city of [[Lviv]] in the west.  The [[Crimea]], a little “continent” of its own, is a popular vacation destination for tourists for swimming or [[sun tanning]] on the Black Sea with its warm climate, rugged mountains, plateaus and ancient ruins. Cities there include: [[Sevastopol]] and [[Yalta]] – location of the [[Yalta Conference|peace conference]] at the end of [[World War II]]. Visitors can also take cruise tours by ship on [[Dnieper]] River from Kiev to the Black Sea coastline. [[Ukrainian cuisine]] has a long history and offers a wide variety of original dishes.

The [[Seven Wonders of Ukraine]] are the seven historical and cultural monuments of Ukraine; the sites were chosen by the general public through an internet-based vote.

===Demographic crisis===
Ukraine has been in a demographic crisis since the 1980s because of its high death rate and a low birth rate.  The population is shrinking by over 150,000 a year. The birth rate has recovered in recent years from a catastrophically low level around 2000, and is now comparable to the European average, but would need to increase by another 50% or so to stabilize the population.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

In 2007, the country's population was declining at the fourth fastest rate in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2002&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2002.html|title=Field Listing – Population growth rate|accessdate=July 5, 2008|work=CIA World Factbook}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Life expectancy is falling.  The nation suffers a high [[mortality rate]] from environmental pollution, poor diets, widespread smoking, extensive alcoholism, and deteriorating medical care.&lt;ref name=&quot;Starostenko1998&quot;&gt;Hanna H. Starostenko, [http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/wumag_old/archiv/2_98/economic.htm &quot;Economic and Ecological Factors of Transformations in Demographic Process in Ukraine&quot;], ''Uktraine Magazine'' No. 2, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbank1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/html/prddr/trans/julaug99/pgs3-4.htm|title=What Went Wrong with Foreign Advice in Ukraine?|accessdate=January 16, 2008|work=The World Bank Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years 2008 through 2010, more than 1.5 million children were born in Ukraine, compared to fewer than 1.2 million during 1999–2001 during the worst of the demographic crisis. Infant mortality rates have also dropped from 10.4 deaths to 8.9 per 1,000 children under one year of age. This is still high in comparison, however, to many other nations.&lt;ref name=Kids09&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/53726/ Ukraine’s children still have it rough], Kyiv Post (November 26, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the United Nations, [[poverty]] and poor [[Health care in Ukraine|health care]] are the two biggest problems Ukrainian children face.

The current birth rate in Ukraine, as of 2010, is 10.8 births/1,000 population, and the death rate is 15.2 deaths/1,000 population (see [[Demographics of Ukraine|demographic tables]])

The phenomenon of lowest-low fertility, defined as total fertility below 1.3, is emerging throughout Europe and is attributed by many to postponement of the initiation of childbearing. Ukraine, where total fertility (a very low 1.1 in 2001), was one of the world's lowest, shows that there is more than one pathway to lowest-low fertility. Although Ukraine has undergone immense political and economic transformations during 1991–2004, it has maintained a young age at first birth and nearly universal childbearing. Analysis of official national statistics and the Ukrainian Reproductive Health Survey show that fertility declined to very low levels without a transition to a later pattern of childbearing. Findings from focus group interviews suggest explanations of the early fertility pattern. These findings include the persistence of traditional norms for childbearing and the roles of men and women, concerns about medical complications and infertility at a later age, and the link between early fertility and early marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Perelli-Harris | first1 = Brienna  | year = 2005 | title = The Path to Lowest-low Fertility in Ukraine | journal = Population Studies | volume = 59 | issue = 1| pages = 55–70 | jstor = 30040436 | doi = 10.1080/0032472052000332700 | pmid = 15764134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To help mitigate the declining population, the government continues to increase child support payments. Thus it provides one-time payments of 12,250 Hryvnias for the first child, 25,000 Hryvnias for the second and 50,000 Hryvnias for the third and fourth, along with monthly payments of 154 Hryvnias per child.&lt;ref name=BohdanD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://me.kmu.gov.ua/control/en/publish/article?art_id=115924&amp;cat_id=38912|title=Bohdan Danylyshyn at the Economic ministry|accessdate=February 1, 2008|work=Economic Ministry}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/data/1_21296.html|title=President meets with business bosses|accessdate=February 1, 2008|work=Press office of President Victor Yushchenko |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071214153647/http://www.president.gov.ua/en/news/data/1_21296.html |archivedate = December 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The demographic trend is showing signs of improvement, as the birth rate has been steadily growing since 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{uk icon}} [http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/express/expr2009/1109/238.zip The demographic situation in Ukraine in January–September 2009], [[State Statistics Committee of Ukraine]]&lt;/ref&gt; Net population growth over the first nine months of 2007 was registered in five provinces of the country (out of 24), and population shrinkage was showing signs of stabilising nationwide.

According to the constitution, the [[official language|state language]] of Ukraine is Ukrainian. Russian, which was the ''de facto'' official language of the Soviet Union, is widely spoken, especially in eastern and southern Ukraine. According to the 2001 census, 67.5&amp;nbsp;percent of the population declared Ukrainian as their native language and 29.6&amp;nbsp;percent declared Russian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/language/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080105092304/http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua/eng/results/general/language/|archivedate=January 5, 2008|title=Linguistic composition of the population|accessdate=January 27, 2008|work=All-Ukrainian population census, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most native Ukrainian speakers know Russian as a second language.

These details result in a significant difference across different survey results, as even a small restating of a question switches responses of a significant group of people.{{Ref label|F|f|1}} Ukrainian is mainly spoken in western and central Ukraine. In western Ukraine, Ukrainian is also the dominant language in cities (such as [[Lviv]]). In central Ukraine, Ukrainian and Russian are both equally used in cities, with Russian being more common in [[Kiev]],{{Ref label|F|f|2}} while Ukrainian is the dominant language in rural communities. In eastern and southern Ukraine, Russian is primarily used in cities, and Ukrainian is used in rural areas.

For a large part of the Soviet era, the number of Ukrainian speakers declined from generation to generation, and by the mid-1980s, the usage of the Ukrainian language in public life had decreased significantly.&lt;ref name=Shamshur&gt;Shamshur, p. 159–168&lt;/ref&gt; Following independence, the government of Ukraine began restoring the image and usage of Ukrainian language through a policy of [[Ukrainisation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov.ua/Sections/Revolution_2004/UKL/photos.php?UKL302|title=Світова преса про вибори в Україні-2004 (Ukrainian Elections-2004 as mirrored in the World Press)|accessdate=January 7, 2008|work={{lang|uk|Архіви України}} (National Archives of Ukraine)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, all foreign films and TV programs, including Russian ones, are subbed or dubbed in Ukrainian.

A distant second by the number of the followers is the [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Rite]] [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]], which practices a similar [[liturgy|liturgical]] and spiritual tradition as Eastern Orthodoxy, but is in [[full communion|communion]] with the [[Holy See]] of the Roman Catholic Church and recognises the primacy of the Pope as head of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ugcc.org.ua/eng/ugcc_history/definition/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080226124455/http://www.ugcc.org.ua/eng/ugcc_history/definition/|archivedate=February 26, 2008|title=Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC)|accessdate=January 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, there are 863 [[Latin Rite]] Catholic communities, and 474 clergy members serving some one million Latin Rite Catholics in Ukraine.&lt;ref name=derzhkomrelig/&gt; The group forms some 2.19&amp;nbsp;percent of the population and consists mainly of ethnic [[Poles]] and [[Hungarians]], who live predominantly in the western regions of the country.

[[Protestantism|Protestant Christians]] also form around 2.19&amp;nbsp;percent of the population. Protestant numbers have grown greatly since Ukrainian independence. The [[Evangelical Baptist Union of Ukraine]] is the largest group, with more than 150,000 members and about 3000 clergy. The second largest Protestant church is the Ukrainian Church of Evangelical faith ([[Pentecostalism|Pentecostals]]) with 110000 members and over 1500 local churches and over 2000 clergy, but there also exist other Pentecostal groups and unions and together all Pentecostals are over 300,000, with over 3000 local churches. Also there are many Pentecostal high education schools such as the Lviv Theological Seminary and the Kiev Bible Institute. Other groups include [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]], [[Methodism|Methodists]] and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]].

The [[History of the Jews in Ukraine|Jewish]] population is a tiny fraction of what it was before [[World War II]]. (In Tsarist times, Ukraine had been part of the [[Pale of Settlement]], to which Jews were largely restricted in the Russian Empire.)

Hospitals in Ukraine are organised along the same lines as most European nations, according to the regional administrative structure; resultantly most towns have their own hospital ''(Міська Лікарня)'' and many also have district hospitals ''(Районна Лікарня)''. Larger and more specialised medical complexes tend only to be found in major cities, with some even more specialised units located only in the capital, [[Kiev]]. However, all [[Administrative divisions of Ukraine|Oblasts]] have their own network of general hospitals which are able to deal with almost all medical problems and are typically equipped with major trauma centres; such hospitals are called 'regional hospitals' ''(Обласна Лікарня)''.

Ukraine currently faces a number of major public health issues, and is considered to be in a demographic crisis due to its high death rate and  low birth rate (the current Ukrainian birth rate is 11 births/1,000 population, and the death rate is 16.3 deaths/1,000 population). A factor contributing to the relatively high death is a high [[mortality rate]] among working-age males from preventable causes such as [[alcohol poisoning]] and smoking.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbank1&quot;/&gt; In 2008, the country's population was one of the fastest declining in the world at −5% growth.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2002&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ukrstat.gov.ua/ State Statistics Committee of Ukraine] Retrieved on September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The UN warned that Ukraine's population could fall by as much as 10 million by 2050 if trends did not improve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esa.un.org/unpp/p2k0data.asp UN population estimates]{{dead link|date=October 2011}} UN Retrieved on September 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this obesity, systemic high blood pressure and the HIV endemic are all major challenges facing the contemporary Ukrainian healthcare system.

The first higher education institutions (HEIs) emerged in Ukraine during the late 16th and early 17th centuries. The first Ukrainian higher education institution was the [[Ostroh Academy|Ostrozka School]], or Ostrozkiy Greek-Slavic-Latin Collegium, similar to Western European higher education institutions of the time. Established in 1576 in the town of [[Ostroh|Ostrog]], the Collegium was the first higher education institution in the [[East Slavic peoples|Eastern Slavic]] territories. The oldest university was the [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kyiv Mohyla Academy]], first established in 1632 and in 1694 officially recognized by the government of [[Imperial Russia]] as a higher education institution. Among the oldest is also the [[Lviv University]], founded in 1661. More higher education institutions were set up in the 19th century, beginning with universities in [[Kharkiv University|Kharkiv]] (1805), [[Kiev University|Kiev]] (1834), [[Odessa University|Odessa]] (1865), and [[Chernivtsi University|Chernivtsi]] (1875) and a number of professional higher education institutions, e.g.: [[Nizhyn Pedagogical University|Nizhyn Historical and Philological Institute]] (originally established as the Gymnasium of Higher Sciences in 1805), a Veterinary Institute (1873) and a [[Kharkiv Polytechnical Institute|Technological Institute]] (1885) in [[Kharkiv]], a [[Kiev Polytechnic Institute|Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Kiev]] (1898) and a Higher Mining School (1899) in [[Dnipropetrovsk|Katerynoslav]]. Rapid growth followed in the [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet]] period. By 1988 a number of higher education institutions increased to 146 with over 850,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001465/146552e.pdf |title=Higher education in Ukraine; Monographs on higher education; 2006 |format=PDF |accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most HEIs established after 1990 are those owned by private organizations.

In the case of all grades being the highest (5), the scholarship is increased by 25%. For most students the level of government subsidy is not sufficient to cover their basic living expenses. Most universities provide subsidized housing for out-of-city students. Also, it is common for libraries to supply required books for all registered students. There are two degrees conferred by Ukrainian universities: the Bachelor's Degree (4&amp;nbsp;years) and the Master's Degree (5–6th&amp;nbsp;year). These degrees are introduced in accordance with [[Bologna process]], in which Ukraine is taking part. Historically, Specialist's Degree (usually 5 years) is still also granted; it was the only degree awarded by universities in the Soviet times.

The tradition of the [[Easter egg]], known as [[pysanky]], has long roots in Ukraine. These eggs were drawn on with wax to create a pattern; then, the dye was applied to give the eggs their pleasant colours, the dye did not affect the previously wax-coated parts of the egg. After the entire egg was dyed, the wax was removed leaving only the colourful pattern. This tradition is thousands of years old, and precedes the arrival of Christianity to Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.unc.edu/~yakowenk/pysanky/index.html|title=Pysanky – Ukrainian Easter Eggs

The 19th&amp;nbsp;century initiated a [[vernacular]] period in Ukraine, led by [[Ivan Kotliarevsky]]’s work {{lang|uk-Latn|''Eneyida''}}, the first publication written in modern Ukrainian. By the 1830s, Ukrainian [[romanticism]] began to develop, and the nation’s most renowned cultural figure, romanticist poet-painter [[Taras Shevchenko]] emerged. Where Ivan Kotliarevsky is considered to be the father of literature in the Ukrainian vernacular; Shevchenko is the father of a national revival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?AddButton=pages\L\I\Literature.htm|title=Literature|author=Struk, Danylo Husar |accessdate=January 17, 2008|work=Encyclopedia of Ukraine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, in 1863, use of the Ukrainian language in print was effectively [[Ems Ukaz|prohibited]] by the Russian Empire.&lt;ref name=censor/&gt; This severely curtained literary activity in the area, and Ukrainian writers were forced to either publish their works in Russian or release them in Austrian controlled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]]. The ban was never officially lifted, but it became obsolete after the revolution and the Bolsheviks’ coming to power.&lt;ref name=ualitmsn/&gt;

Ukrainian literature continued to flourish in the early Soviet years, when nearly all literary trends were approved. These policies faced a steep decline in the 1930s, when Stalin implemented his policy of [[socialist realism]]. The doctrine did not necessarily repress the Ukrainian language, but it required writers to follow a certain style in their works. Literary activities continued to be somewhat limited under the communist party, and it was not until Ukraine gained its independence in 1991 when writers were free to express themselves as they wished.&lt;ref name=ualit/&gt;{{Clear}}

===Architecture===
{{Main|Ukrainian architecture}}
[[File:2005-08-15 Pechersk Lavra seen from river Dnepr Kiev 311 cropped.jpeg|thumb|left|The various structures of the [[Kiev Pechersk Lavra]] date to different time periods, and through their styles offer an insight into the [[History of Ukraine]] and the rich craftsmanship that was developed in its long period]]
Ukrainian architecture is a term that describes the motifs and styles that are found in structures built in modern Ukraine, and by [[Ukrainians]] worldwide. These include initial roots which were established in the [[Eastern Slavs|Eastern Slavic]] state of [[Kievan Rus']]. After the [[Mongol invasion of Rus|12th century]], the distinct [[architectural history]] continued in the principalities of [[Galicia-Volhynia]]. During the epoch of the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]], a new style unique to Ukraine was developed under the western influences of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. After the union with the [[Tsardom of Russia]], architecture in Ukraine began to develop in different directions, with many structures in the larger eastern, Russian-ruled area built in the styles of [[Russian architecture]] of that period, whilst the western [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] was developed under [[Architecture of Austria|Austro-Hungarian architectural influences]], in both cases producing fine examples.&lt;!-- pov, but for now we can afford to leave it in --&gt; Ukrainian national motifs would finally be used during the period of the [[Soviet Union]] and in modern independent Ukraine.

The great [[Architecture of Kievan Rus|churches of the Rus']], built after the [[Baptism of Kievan Rus'|adoption of Christianity]] in 988, were the first examples of monumental architecture in the East Slavic lands. The architectural style of the Kievan state, which quickly established itself, was strongly influenced by the [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]]. Early [[Eastern Orthodox]] churches were mainly made of wood, with the simplest form of church becoming known as a [[cell church]]. Major cathedrals often featured scores of small domes, which led some art historians to take this as an indication of the appearance of pre-Christian pagan Slavic temples.

[[File:Lwów - Opera.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Lviv Theatre of Opera and Ballet|Lviv Opera and Ballet Theatre]]; the architecture of [[Western Ukraine]] has been greatly influenced by its long history as part of [[Austria-Hungary]] and [[Poland]]]]
Several examples of these churches survive to this day; however, during the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries, many were externally rebuilt in the [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style (see below). Examples include the grand [[Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev|St. Sophia of Kiev]] – the year 1017 is the earliest record of foundation laid, [[Church of the Saviour at Berestove]] – built from 1113 to 1125, and [[St. Cyril's Monastery|St. Cyril's Church]], circa 12th century. All can still be found in the Ukrainian capital. Several buildings were reconstructed during the late-19th century, including the [[:File:WladimirWolynsk Uspenski Cathedral.jpeg|Assumption Cathedral]] in [[Volodymyr-Volynskyi]], built in 1160 and reconstructed in 1896–1900, the [[:Image:AX Chernigiv Pyatnitska Church.jpg|Paraskevi church in Chernihiv]], built in 1201 with reconstruction done in the late 1940s, and the [[Golden Gate (Kiev)|Golden gates in Kiev]], built in 1037 and reconstructed in 1982. The latter's reconstruction was criticized by some art and architecture historians {{who|date=October 2011}} as a revivalist fantasy. Unfortunately little secular or [[vernacular architecture]] of [[Kievan Rus']] has survived.

[[File:Vorontsov South View.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Vorontsov's Palace (Alupka)|Vorontsov Palace]], nestled at the foot of the [[Crimean Mountains]], is an example of [[Gothic Revival architecture|gothic revival architecture]] in Ukraine]]
As Ukraine became increasingly integrated into the [[Russian Empire]], Russian architects had the opportunity to realize their projects in the picturesque landscape that many Ukrainian cities and regions offered. [[St. Andrew's Church of Kiev]] (1747–1754), built by [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]], is a notable example of [[Baroque]] architecture, and its location on top of the Kievan mountain made it a recognizable monument of the city. An equally notable contribution of Rasetrelli was the [[Mariyinsky Palace]], which was built to be a summer residence to Russian Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]]. During the reign of the last [[Hetmans of Ukrainian Cossacks|Hetman of Ukraine]], [[Kirill Razumovsky]], many of the [[Cossack Hetmanate]]'s towns such as [[Hlukhiv]], [[Baturyn]] and [[Koselets]] had grandiose projects built by the appointed ''architect of [[Little Russia]],'' [[Andrey Kvasov]]. Russia, winning successive wars over the [[Ottoman Empire]] and its vassal [[Crimean Khanate]], eventually annexed the whole south of Ukraine and Crimea. Renamed [[New Russia]], these lands were to be colonized, and new cities such as the [[Mykolayiv|Nikolayev]], [[Odessa]], [[Kherson]] and [[Sevastopol]] were founded. These would contain notable examples of Imperial Russian architecture.

In 1934, the capital of Soviet Ukraine moved from [[Kharkiv]] to [[Kiev]]. During the preceding years, the city was seen as only a regional centre, and hence received little attention. All of that was to change, but at a great price. By this point, the first examples of [[Stalinist architecture]] were already showing, and, in light of the official policy, a new city was to be built on top of the old one. This meant that much-admired examples such as the [[St. Michael's Golden-Domed Monastery]] were destroyed. Even the St. Sophia Cathedral was under threat. Also, the Second World War contributed to the wreckage. After the war, a new project for the reconstruction of central Kiev was unveiled. This transformed the [[Khreshchatyk]] avenue into one of the most notable examples of [[Stalinist Architecture|Stalinism in Architecture]]. However, by 1955, the new politics of architecture once again promptly stopped the project from fully being realised.
[[File:Europe Shopping center in Dnipropetrovsk.jpg|thumb|right|Europe mall in Dnipropetrovsk, an example of modern architecture in Ukraine]]
The task for modern Ukrainian architecture is diverse application of modern aesthetics, the search for an architect's own artistic style and inclusion of the existing historico-cultural environment. An example of modern Ukrainian architecture is the reconstruction and renewal of the [[Maidan Nezalezhnosti]] in central Kiev, despite the limit set by narrow space within the plaza, the engineers were able to blend together the uneven landscape and also use underground space to set a new shopping centre.

A major project, which may take up most of the 21st century, is the construction of the Kiev City-Centre on the [[Rybalskyi Peninsula]], which, when finished, will include a dense skyscraper park amid the picturesque landscape of the [[Dnieper River|Dnieper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archunion.com.ua/gradsovet_05_12_07.html|title=Project of reconstruction of the Rybalskyi Peninsula|work=archunion.com.ua|date=December 5, 2005|language=Russian}}{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Ukraine}}
[[File:Lysenko-u-foteli.gif|thumb|left|upright|[[Mykola Lysenko]] (photo before 1912) is widely believed to be the father of Ukrainian classical music]]
Music is a major part of Ukrainian culture, with a long history and many influences. From traditional [[folk music]], to [[classical music|classical]] and [[modern rock]], Ukraine has produced a long list of internationally recognized musical talent including [[Tchaikovsky]], [[Okean Elzy]] and [[Ruslana]]. Elements from traditional Ukrainian folk music made their way into Western music and even into modern [[jazz]].

Ukraine found itself at the crossroads of Asia and Europe and this is reflected within the music in a perplexing mix of exotic melismatic singing with chordal harmony which does not always easily fit the rules of traditional Western European harmony.
The most striking general characteristic of authentic ethnic Ukrainian folk music is the wide use of minor modes or keys which incorporate augmented 2nd intervals. This is an indication that the major-minor system developed in Western European music did not become as entrenched or as sophisticated in Ukraine.  However, during the Baroque period, music was an important discipline for those that had received a higher education in Ukraine. It had a place of considerable importance in the curriculum of the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]]. Much of the nobility was well versed in music with many Ukrainian Cossack leaders such as (Mazepa, Paliy, Holovatyj, Sirko) being accomplished players of the [[kobza]], [[bandura]] or [[torban]].

In the course of the 18th century in the Russian Empire court musicians were typically trained at the music academy in [[Hlukhiv]], and largely came from Ukraine. Notable performers of the era include [[Timofiy Bilohradsky|Tymofiy Bilohradsky]] who later studied [[lute]] under [[Sylvius Leopold Weiss]] in Dresden, his daughter Yelyzaveta who was a famous operatic soprano, and [[Alexey Razumovsky|Oleksiy Rozumovsky]], a court bandurist and the [[morganatic]] husband of Empress [[Elizabeth of Russia|Elizabeth]]. The first dedicated musical academy was set up in Hlukhiv, Ukraine in 1738 and students were taught to sing, play violin and bandura from manuscripts. As a result many of the earliest composers and performers within the Russian empire were ethnically Ukrainian, having been born or educated in Hlukhiv, or had been closely associated with this music school.
See: [[Dmytro Bortniansky]], [[Maksym Berezovsky]], [[Artemy Vedel|Artemiy Vedel]].

Ukrainian classical music falls into three distinct categories defined by whether the composer was of Ukrainian ethnicity living in Ukraine, a composer of non-Ukrainian ethnicity who was born or at some time was a citizen of Ukraine, or an ethnic Ukrainian living outside of Ukraine within the Ukrainian [[diaspora]]. The music of these three groups differs considerably, as do the audiences for whom they cater.

[[File:Okean-elzy-2008.jpg|thumb|[[Okean Elzy]] is one of the most popular modern-day Ukrainian rock bands]]
[[File:Okean elzy - Dyakuyu tobi.ogg|thumb|Dyuakuyu tobi (Дякую тобі) by [[Okean Elzy]]]]
The first category is closely tied with the Ukrainian national school of music spearheaded by [[Mykola Lysenko]]. It includes such composers as [[Kyrylo Stetsenko]], [[Mykola Leontovych]], [[Levko Revutsky]],  [[Borys Lyatoshynsky]], [[Mykola Vilinsky]]. Most of their music contains Ukrainian folk figures and are composed to Ukrainian texts. On the other hand, the second category is of particular importance and international visibility, because of the large percentage of ethnic minorities in urban Ukraine. This category includes such composers as [[Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart|Franz Xavier Mozart]], [[Isaak Dunayevsky]], [[Rheinhold Gliere]], [[Yuliy Meitus]] and [[Sergei Prokofiev]], performers [[Vladimir Horowitz|Volodymyr Horovyts]], [[David Oistrakh]], [[Sviatoslav Richter]] and [[Isaac Stern]]. The music of these composers rarely contains Ukrainian folk motives and more often is written to the texts of Russian or Polish poets. Whilst the third category includes a number of prominent individuals who are often not part of the mainstream Ukrainian culture but who have made a significant impact on music in Ukraine, while living outside of its borders. These include historic individuals such as: [[Dmytro Bortniansky|Bortniansky]], [[Maksym Berezovsky|Berezovsky]], [[Artemy Vedel|Vedel]], Tuptalo and [[Titov]]. It also contains &quot;Soviet&quot; composers such as [[Mykola Roslavets]], [[Isaak Dunayevsky]] who were born in Ukraine but who moved to other cultural centres within the Soviet Union. In North America we have Mykola Fomenko, [[Yuriy Oliynyk]], Zinoviy Lavryshyn and Wasyl Sydorenko.

Since the mid 1960s, Western-influenced pop music, in its various forms, that has been growing in popularity in Ukraine. One of the most important and truly original musicians to come out of Ukraine in recent years is the ultra avant-garde folk singer and harmonium player [[Mariana Sadovska]]. Ukrainian pop and folk music arose with the international popularity of groups like [[Vopli Vidoplyasova]], [[Viy (band)|Viy]], and [[Okean Elzy]].

'''e.'''{{Note label|E|E|none}} This figure excludes [[POW]] deaths.

'''f.'''{{note label|F|f|1}}{{note label|F|f|2}}{{note label|F|f|3}} According to the official [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 census]] data ([http://ukrcensus.gov.ua/results/general/nationality/city_kyiv/ by nationality]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}; [http://ukrcensus.gov.ua/results/general/language/city_kyiv/ by language]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}) about 75&amp;nbsp;percent of Kiev's population responded 'Ukrainian' to the native language (ridna mova) census question, and roughly 25&amp;nbsp;percent responded 'Russian'. On the other hand, when the question 'What language do you use in everyday life?' was asked in the 2003 sociological survey, the Kievans' answers were distributed as follows: 'mostly Russian': 52&amp;nbsp;percent, 'both Russian and Ukrainian in equal measure': 32&amp;nbsp;percent, 'mostly Ukrainian': 14&amp;nbsp;percent, 'exclusively Ukrainian': 4.3&amp;nbsp;percent.&lt;br /&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.wumag.kiev.ua/index2.php?param=pgs20032/72|title=What language is spoken in Ukraine?|publisher=Welcome to Ukraine|date=2003/2|accessdate=July 11, 2008 }}

'''g.'''{{Note label|G|g|none}} Such writings were also the base for Russian and Belarusian literature.

'''h.'''{{Note label|H|h|none}} Without the city of Inhulets.

'''i.'''{{Note label|I|i|none}} Russia and Khazakstan are the first and second largest but both these figures include European and Asian territories. Russia is the only country possessing European territories larger than Ukraine.
