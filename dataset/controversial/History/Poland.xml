'''Poland''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Poland.ogg|ˈ|p|oʊ|l|ə|n|d}} ({{lang-pl|Polska}}), officially the '''Republic of Poland''' ({{lang-pl|[[Rzeczpospolita]] Polska}}; {{lang-csb|Pòlskô Repùblika}}), is a country in [[Central Europe]], [[Borders of Poland|bordered]] by [[Germany]] to the west; the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] to the south; [[Ukraine]], [[Belarus]] and [[Lithuania]] to the east; and the [[Baltic Sea]] and [[Kaliningrad Oblast]], a [[Russia]]n [[Enclave and exclave|exclave]], to the north. The total [[area of Poland]] is {{convert|312679|km2|sqmi}},&lt;ref name=&quot;CSO_2008&quot;/&gt; making it the [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|69th largest country]] in the world and the 9th largest in Europe. Poland has a population of over 38.5&amp;nbsp;million people,&lt;ref name=&quot;CSO_2008&quot;/&gt; which makes it the [[List of countries by population|34th most populous country]] in the world&lt;ref name=&quot;nationmaster&quot;/&gt; and the sixth most populous [[Member State of the European Union|member of the European Union]], being its most populous [[post-communist]] member. Poland is a [[unitary state]] made up of 16 [[voivodeships]]. Poland is a member of the [[European Union]], [[NATO]], the [[United Nations]], the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), [[European Economic Area]], [[International Energy Agency]], [[Council of Europe]], [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]], [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], [[European Space Agency]], [[G6 (EU)|G6]], [[Council of the Baltic Sea States]], [[Visegrád Group]], [[Weimar Triangle]] and [[Schengen Agreement]]. 

The establishment of a Polish state is often identified with the adoption of [[Christianity]] by its ruler [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]] in 966,&lt;ref name=&quot;A Concise History of Poland&quot;/&gt; over the territory similar to that of present-day Poland. The [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|Kingdom of Poland]] was formed in 1025, and in 1569 it cemented [[Polish–Lithuanian union|a long association]] with the [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania]] by signing the [[Union of Lublin]], forming the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. The Commonwealth ceased to exist in 1795 as the [[Partitions of Poland|Polish lands were partitioned]] among the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], the [[Russian Empire]], and [[Habsburg Monarchy|Old Austria]]. [[History of Poland (1918–1939)|Poland regained its independence]] as the [[Second Polish Republic]] in 1918. Two decades later, in September 1939, [[World War II]] started with the [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Soviet Union]] invasion of Poland ([[Treaty of Non-Aggression between Germany and the Soviet Union|Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]]). Over six million Polish citizens died in the war. The [[People's Republic of Poland|People's Republic]] was declared in 1952 although Poland was a [[client state]] of the [[Soviet Union]] from the closing days of the war. During the [[Revolutions of 1989]], the [[communism|communist]] state was overthrown and democratic rule was re-established in the form of the current Poland, constitutionally known as the &quot;Third Polish Republic&quot;.

Despite [[Occupation of Poland (1939-1945)|the vast destruction the country experienced in World War II]], Poland managed to preserve much of its [[Culture of Poland|cultural wealth]]. There are currently 14 heritage sites inscribed on the [[UNESCO]] [[List of World Heritage Sites in Poland|World Heritage list in Poland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland – UNESCO World Heritage Centre&quot;/&gt; Since the end of the communist period, Poland has achieved a &quot;very high&quot; ranking in terms of [[Human Development Index|human development]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Development Index and its components&quot;/&gt;

{{main|Name of Poland}}
[[File:Denar rys chrobry1.png|thumb|left|[[Bolesław I Chrobry|Bolesław Chrobry]] [[Denarius]] of from XI century with Latin name Polonie.]]

The source of the name Poland&lt;ref name=&quot;merseburg&quot;/&gt; and the [[ethnonym]]s for the [[Poles]]&lt;ref name=&quot;canaparius&quot;/&gt; include [[Exonym and endonym|endonyms]] (the way Polish people refer to themselves and their country) and exonyms (the way other peoples refer to the Poles and their country). Endonyms and most exonyms for Poles and Poland derive from the name of the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] tribe of the [[Polans (western)|Polans]] (''Polanie'').

The origin of the name ''Polanie'' itself is uncertain. It may derive from such Polish words as ''pole'' (field).&lt;ref name=&quot;dictionary&quot;/&gt; The early tribal inhabitants denominated it from the nature of the country. Lowlands and low hills predominate throughout the vast region from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] shores to the foothills of the [[Carpathian Mountains]]. ''Inter Alpes Huniae et Oceanum est Polonia, sic dicta in eorum idiomate quasi Campania'' is the description by [[Gervase of Tilbury]] in his ''Otia imperialia'' (Recreation for the emperor, 1211). In some languages the exonyms for Poland derive from another tribal name, [[Lechites]] (''Lechici'').

==History==
{{main|History of Poland}}

===Prehistory===
{{main|Prehistory of Poland (until 966)}}
Historians have postulated that throughout [[Late Antiquity]], many distinct ethnic groups populated the regions of what is now known as Poland. The [[ethnic group|ethnicity]] and [[linguistics|linguistic]] affiliation of these groups have been hotly debated; the time and route of the original settlement of [[Slavic peoples]] in these regions have been the particular subjects of much controversy.

The most famous archeological find from the [[prehistory and protohistory of Poland]] is the [[Biskupin]] fortified settlement (now reconstructed as a museum), dating from the [[Lusatian culture]] of the early [[Iron Age]], around 700 BC. Before adopting Christianity in 960 AD, the people of Poland believed in [[Svetovid]], the Slavic god of war, fertility, and abundance. Many other Slavic nations had the same belief.

===Piast dynasty===
{{main|History of Poland (966–1385)}}
[[File:Zaprowadzenie chrzescijanstwa 965 Matejko.JPG|thumb|left|[[Baptism of Poland]] in 966 AD.]]
Poland began to form into a recognizable unitary and territorial entity around the middle of the 10th century under the [[Piast dynasty]]. [[List of Polish monarchs|Poland's first historically documented ruler]], [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], was [[baptism|baptized]] in 966, adopting [[Catholicism]] as the nation's new [[State religion|official religion]], to which the [[Baptism of Poland|bulk of the population converted]] in the course of the next few centuries. In 1000 [[Bolesław I Chrobry|Boleslaw the Brave]], continuing the policy of his father held a [[Congress of Gniezno]] and created a new [[diocese]]s ([[Gniezno]], [[Kraków]], [[Kołobrzeg]], [[Wrocław]]). In the 12th century, Poland fragmented into several smaller duchies when [[Bolesław III Wrymouth|Bolesław]] divided the nation amongst his sons. In 1226 [[Konrad I of Masovia]], one of the regional [[Piast]] dukes, invited the [[Teutonic Knights]] to help him fight the [[Balts|Baltic]] [[Old Prussians|Prussian]] pagans; a decision which would ultimately lead to centuries of warfare with the Knights. In the middle of 13th century Poland was almost united by Silesian branch of Piast dynasty ([[Henry I the Bearded]] and [[Henry II the Pious]]), when the country was devastated by the [[Mongols]] and the [[Battle of Legnica]] where Duke [[Henry II the Pious]] died. In 1320, after a number of earlier unsuccessful attempts by regional rulers at uniting the Polish dukedoms, [[Władysław I the Elbow-high|Władysław I]] consolidated his power, took the throne and became the first King of [[Kingdom of Poland (1025–1385)|a reunified Poland]]. His son, [[Casimir III the Great|Casimir III]], is remembered as one of the greatest Polish kings, who was widely recognized as a protector of trade. He extended his kingdom to 250% of its initial size. Casimir is also known for extending royal protection to [[Jews]] and providing the original impetus for the establishment of Poland's first university.
The [[Golden Liberty]] of the nobles began to develop under Casimir's rule, when in return for their [[Pospolite ruszenie|military support]], the king made serious concessions to the aristocrats, finally establishing their status as superior to that of the townsmen, and aiding their rise to power. When Casimir died in 1370 he left no legitimate male heir and, considering his other male descendants either too young or unsuitable, was laid to rest as the last of the nation's Piast rulers.

Poland was also a centre of migration of peoples. The Germans settled in the towns, the [[Jew]]ish community began to settle and flourish in Poland during this era (see [[History of the Jews in Poland]]); the same applies in smaller number to [[Armenians]]. The [[Black Death]] which affected most parts of Europe from 1347 to 1351 affected Poland to lesser extent.&lt;ref name=&quot;REF03&quot;/&gt;

===Jagiellon dynasty===
{{main|History of Poland (1385–1569)}}
[[File:Jan Matejko-Astronomer Copernicus-Conversation with God.jpg|thumb|left|[[Nicolaus Copernicus]] &quot;talking with God&quot;, who reveals to him the truth about the solar system. Painting by [[Jan Matejko]].]]
The rule of the [[Jagiellon dynasty]] spanned the late [[Middle Ages]] and early [[Modern history|Modern Era]] of Polish history. Beginning with the [[Grand Duke of Lithuania|Lithuanian Grand Duke]] [[Jogaila]] (Władysław II Jagiełło), the Jagiellon dynasty (1386–1572) formed the [[Polish–Lithuanian union]]. The partnership brought vast [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]]-controlled [[Rus' (people)|Rus' areas]] into Poland's sphere of influence and proved beneficial for the Poles and [[Lithuanians]], who coexisted and cooperated in one of the largest [[personal union|political entities]] in Europe for the next four centuries. In the Baltic Sea region Poland's struggle with the Teutonic Knights continued and included the [[Battle of Grunwald]] (1410), where a Polish-Lithuanian army inflicted a decisive defeat on the Teutonic Knights, both countries' main adversary, allowing Poland's and Lithuania's territorial expansion into the far north region of [[Livonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wyrozumski&quot;/&gt; In 1466, after the [[Thirteen Years' War (1454–66)|Thirteen Years' War]], King [[Casimir IV Jagiellon]] gave royal consent to the milestone [[Second Peace of Thorn (1466)|Peace of Thorn]], which created the future [[Duchy of Prussia]], a Polish vassal. The Jagiellons at one point also established dynastic control over the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Bohemia|Bohemia]] (1471 onwards) and [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Europe: a history&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt; In the south Poland confronted the [[Ottoman Empire]] and the [[Crimean Khanate|Crimean Tatars]] (by whom they were attacked on 75 separate occasions between 1474 and 1569),&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;/&gt; and in the east helped Lithuania fight the [[Grand Duchy of Moscow]]. Some historians estimate that Crimean Tatar slave-raiding cost Poland one million of its population from 1494 to 1694.&lt;ref name=&quot;hit-u&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Kraków - Wawel from Kopiec Krakusa.jpg|thumb|right|[[Wawel]], the seat of Polish kings. [[Kraków]] was the nation's capital from 1038 until the move to [[Warsaw]] in 1596]]
Poland was developing as a [[feudalism|feudal]] state, with a predominantly agricultural economy and an increasingly powerful [[landed nobility]]. The ''[[Nihil novi]]'' act adopted by the Polish [[General sejm|Sejm]] ([[parliament]]) in 1505, transferred most of the [[legislature|legislative power]] from the [[monarch]] to the Sejm, an event which marked the beginning of the period known as &quot;Golden Liberty&quot;, when the state was ruled by the &quot;free and equal&quot; [[szlachta|Polish nobility]]. [[Protestant Reformation]] movements made deep inroads into Polish Christianity, which resulted in the establishment of policies promoting [[religious toleration|religious tolerance]], unique in Europe at that time. It is believed that this tolerance allowed the country to avoid the religious turmoil that spread over Europe during the late Middle Ages. The European [[Renaissance]] evoked in late Jagiellon Poland (kings [[Sigismund I the Old]] and [[Sigismund II Augustus]]) a sense of urgency in the need to promote a [[Renaissance in Poland|cultural awakening]], and resultantly during this period Polish culture and the nation's economy flourished. In 1543 the Pole, [[Nicolaus Copernicus]], an astronomer from [[Toruń]], published his epochal works, ''[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]'' (''On the Revolutions of the Celestial Spheres''), and thus became the first proponent of a predictive mathematical model confirming [[Copernican heliocentrism|heliocentric theory]] which ultimately became the accepted basic model for the practice of modern astronomy. Another major figure associated with the era is classicist poet [[Jan Kochanowski]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gierowski&quot;/&gt;

===Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth===
{{main|History of Poland (1569–1795)}}
[[File:Rzeczpospolita 1600.png|thumb|right|The [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] at its greatest extent, after the [[Truce of Deulino]] (Dywilino) of 1619]]

The 1569 [[Union of Lublin]] established the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], a more closely unified federal state with an [[elective monarchy]], but which was governed largely by the nobility, through a system of [[sejmik|local assemblies]] with a central parliament. The establishment of the Commonwealth coincided with a period of great stability and prosperity in Poland, with the union soon thereafter becoming a great European power and a major cultural entity, occupying approximately one million square kilometres of central Europe, as well as an agent for the of the '[[Western culture]]' through [[Polonization]] in modern-day Ukraine, Belarus and Western Russia. [[Poland-Lithuania]] suffered from a number of dynastic crises during the reigns of the [[House of Vasa|Vasa]] kings [[Sigismund III Vasa|Sigismund III]] and [[Władysław IV Vasa|Władysław IV]] and found itself engaged in a major conflicts with [[Tsardom of Russia|Russia]], Sweden and the Ottoman Empire, as well as a series of minor [[Cossacks|Cossack]] uprisings.&lt;ref name=&quot;gierowski&quot;/&gt;

[[File:SiemiginowskiJerzy.1686.JanIIISobieskiPodWiedniem.jpg|upright|left|thumb|A stylised depiction of King [[John III Sobieski]], allied commander-in-chief and victor at the [[Battle of Vienna]]]]

From the middle of the 17th century, the nobles' [[democracy]], suffering from internal disorder, gradually declined, thus leaving the once powerful Commonwealth extremely vulnerable to foreign intervention.
From 1648, the [[Cossack]] [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] engulfed the south and east eventually leaving [[Ukraine]] divided, with the eastern part, lost by the Commonwealth, becoming a dependency of the Tsardom of Russia. This was soon followed by the [[Deluge (history)|'Deluge', a Swedish invasion]], which raged through the Polish heartlands and caused unprecedented damage to Poland's population, culture and infrastructure. Famines and epidemics followed hostilities, and the [[Historical demography of Poland|population]] dropped from roughly 11 to 7 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica1&quot;/&gt;
However, under [[John III Sobieski]] the Commonwealth's military prowess was re-established, and in 1683 Polish forces played a major part in [[Battle of Vienna|relieving Vienna]] of a major [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] siege which was being conducted by [[Kara Mustafa Pasha|Kara Mustafa]] in hope of eventually marching his troops further into Europe to spread [[Islam]].
Unfortunately, Sobieski's reign was to mark the end of the nation's golden-era, and soon, finding itself subjected to almost constant warfare and suffering enormous population losses as well as massive damage to its economy, the Commonwealth fell into decline. The government became ineffective as a result of large scale internal conflicts (e.g. [[Lubomirski's Rokosz]] against [[John II Casimir Vasa|John II Casimir]] and rebellious [[confederation (Poland)|confederations]]) and corrupted legislative processes. The nobility fell under the control of a handful of [[magnates]], and this, compounded with two relatively weak kings of the [[Electorate of Saxony|Saxon]] [[House of Wettin|Wettin dynasty]], [[Augustus II the Strong|Augustus II]] and [[Augustus III of Poland|Augustus III]], as well as the rise of [[Russian Empire|Russia]] and [[Prussia]] after the [[Great Northern War]] only served to worsen the Commonwealth's plight. Despite this The Commonwealth-Saxony [[personal union]] gave rise to the emergence of the Commonwealth's first reform movement, and laid the foundations for the [[Enlightenment in Poland|Polish Enlightenment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gierowski2&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Stanisław II August Poniatowski in coronation clothes.PNG|right|thumb|upright|[[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], the last King of Poland and Grand Duke of Lithuania acceded to the throne in 1764, reigning until his abdication on 25 November 1795]]

During the later part of the 18th century, the Commonwealth made attempts to implement fundamental internal reforms; with the second half of the century bringing a much improved economy, significant population growth and far-reaching progress in the areas of education, intellectual life, art, and especially toward the end of the period, evolution of the social and political system. The most populous capital city of [[Warsaw]] replaced [[Gdańsk]] (Danzig) as the leading centre of commerce, and the role of the more prosperous townsfolk soon increased. The [[Royal elections in Poland|royal election]] of 1764 resulted in the elevation of [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]], a refined and worldly aristocrat connected to a major [[magnate]] [[Czartoryski family|faction]], to the monarchy. However, a one-time lover of Empress [[Catherine II of Russia]], the new king spent much of his reign torn between his desire to implement reforms necessary to save his nation, and his perceived necessity to remain in a relationship with his Russian sponsor. This ultimately led to the formation of the 1768 [[Bar Confederation]]; a ''szlachta'' rebellion directed against Russia and the Polish king which fought to preserve Poland's independence and the ''szlachta'''s traditional privileges.
Attempts at reform provoked the union's neighbours, and in 1772 the [[First Partition of Poland|First Partition of the Commonwealth]] by Russia, Austria and Prussia took place; an act which the &quot;[[Partition Sejm]]&quot;, under considerable duress, eventually &quot;ratified&quot; ''fait accompli''.&lt;ref name=&quot;wydawnictwo&quot;/&gt; Disregarding this loss, in 1773 the king established the [[Commission of National Education]], the first government education authority in Europe.

The long-lasting [[Great Sejm]] convened by Stanisław August in 1788 successfully adopted the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791|May 3 Constitution]], the first set of modern supreme national laws in Europe. However, this document, accused by detractors of harbouring revolutionary sympathies, soon generated strong opposition from the Commonwealth's nobles and conservatives as well as from Catherine II, who, determined to prevent the rebirth of a strong Commonwealth set about planning the final dismemberment of the Polish-Lithuanian state. Russia was greatly aided in achieving its goal when the [[Targowica Confederation]], an organisation of Polish nobles, appealed to the Empress for help, and in May 1792 Russian forces crossed the Commonwealth's frontier, thus beginning the [[Polish–Russian War of 1792|Polish-Russian War]].
The defensive war fought by the Poles and Lithuanians ended prematurely when the King, convinced of the futility of resistance, capitulated and joined the Targowica Confederation. The Confederation then took over the government; Russia and Prussia, fearing the mere existence of a Polish state, arranged for, and subsequently in 1793, executed the [[Second Partition of Poland|Second Partition of the Commonwealth]], which left the country deprived of so much territory that it was practically incapable of independent existence. Eventually, in 1795, following the failed [[Kościuszko Uprising]], the Commonwealth was [[Third Partition of Poland|partitioned one last time]] by all three of its more powerful neighbours, and with this, effectively ceased to exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;gierowski3&quot;/&gt;

===The Age of Partitions===
{{main|History of Poland (1795–1918)}}
[[File:Smuglewicz Kosciuszko 2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tadeusz Kościuszko]] takes the oath to the King on the [[Main Market Square, Kraków|Rynek]] in [[Kraków]], 1794 ]]
Poles [[List of wars involving Poland|rebelled several times against the partitioners]], particularly near the end of the 18th century and the beginning of the 19th century. One of the most famous and successful attempts at securing renewed Polish independence took place in 1794, during the Kościuszko Uprising, at the [[Battle of Racławice|Racławice]] where [[Tadeusz Kosciuszko]], a popular and distinguished general who had served under [[George Washington|Washington]] in [[American Revolutionary War|America]], led [[peasants]] and some Polish regulars into battle against numerically superior Russian forces. In 1807, [[Napoleon I of France]] recreated a Polish state, the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], but after the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Poland was again divided by the victorious Allies at the [[Congress of Vienna]] of 1815. The eastern part was ruled by the Russian [[tsar]] as a [[Congress Poland|Congress Kingdom]] which possessed a very [[Constitution of the Kingdom of Poland|liberal constitution]]. However, the tsars soon reduced Polish freedoms, and Russia annexed the country in virtually all but name. Thus in the latter half of the 19th century, only Austrian-ruled [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], and particularly the [[Free City of Kraków]], created good environment for free Polish cultural life to flourish.

Throughout the period of the partitions, political and cultural repression of the Polish nation led to the organisation of a number of uprisings against the authorities of the occupying Russian, Prussian and Austrian governments. Notable amongst these are the [[November Uprising]] of 1830 and [[January Uprising]] of 1863, both of which were attempts to free Poland from the rule of tsarist Russia. The November uprising began on 29 November 1830 in [[Warsaw]] when, led by Lieutenant [[Piotr Wysocki]], young [[non-commissioned officer]]s at the [[Imperial Russian Army|Imperial Russian Army's]] [[military academy]] in that city revolted. They were soon joined by large segments of Polish society, and together forced Warsaw's Russian garrison to withdraw north of the city.
[[File:Starcie belwederczykow z kirasjerami rosyjskimi na moscie w Lazienkach.jpg|thumb|right|Polish insurgents and Russian [[cuirassier]]s clash on a bridge in Warsaw's [[Łazienki Park]] during the November Uprising, Painting by [[Wojciech Kossak]], 1898]]
Over the course of the next seven months, Polish forces successfully defeated the Russian armies of Field Marshal [[Hans Karl von Diebitsch]] and a number of other Russian commanders; however, finding themselves in a position unsupported by any other foreign powers, save distant France and the newborn United States, and with [[Prussia]] and [[Austria]] refusing to allow the import of military supplies through their territories, the Poles accepted that the uprising was doomed to failure. Upon the surrender of Warsaw to General [[Ivan Paskievich]], many Polish troops, feeling they could not go on, withdrew into Germany and there laid down their arms. Poles would have to wait another 32 years for another opportunity to free their homeland.

When in January 1863 a new Polish uprising against Russian rule began, it did so as a spontaneous protest by young Poles against [[conscription]] into the Imperial Russian Army. However, the insurrectionists, despite being joined by high-ranking Polish-Lithuanian officers and numerous politicians were still severely outnumbered and lacking in foreign support. They were forced to resort to [[guerrilla warfare]] tactics and ultimately failed to win any major military victories. Afterwards no major uprising was witnessed in the Russian controlled [[Congress Poland]] and Poles resorted instead to fostering economic and cultural self-improvement.

Despite the political unrest experienced during the partitions, Poland did benefit from large scale industrialisation and modernisation programs, instituted by the occupying powers, which helped it develop into a more economically coherent and viable entity. This was particularly true in the Greater Poland, Pomerania and Warmia annexed by Prussia (later becoming a part of the [[German Empire]]); an area which eventually, thanks largely to the [[Greater Poland Uprising (1918–1919)|Greater Poland Uprising]], was reconstituted as a part of the [[Second Polish Republic]] and became one of its most productive regions.

===Reconstitution of Poland===
{{main|History of Poland (1918–1939)}}
[[File:Jozef Pilsudski.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Naczelnik państwa|Chief of State]] Marshal [[Józef Piłsudski]]]]

During [[World War I]], all the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] agreed on the reconstitution of Poland that United States President [[Woodrow Wilson]] proclaimed in Point 13 of his [[Fourteen Points]]. A total of 2 million Polish troops fought with the armies of the three occupying powers, and 450,000 died.&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies&quot;/&gt; Shortly after the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice with Germany in November 1918]], Poland regained its independence as the [[Second Polish Republic]] (''II Rzeczpospolita Polska''). It reaffirmed its independence after [[List of wars involving Poland|a series of military conflicts]], the most notable being the [[Polish–Soviet War]] (1919–1921) when Poland inflicted a crushing defeat on the [[Red Army]] at the [[battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]], an event which is considered to have ultimately halted the advance of [[Communism]] into Europe and forced [[Vladimir Lenin]] to rethink his objective of achieving global [[socialism]]. Nowadays the event is often referred to as the 'Miracle at the Vistula'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Głos&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Rzeczpospolita 1939.svg|thumb|right|Poland between 1922 and 1938]]
During this period, Poland successfully managed to fuse the territories of the three former partitioning powers into a cohesive nation state. Railways were restructured to direct traffic towards [[Warsaw]] instead of the former imperial capitals, a new network of national roads was gradually built up and a [[Gdynia|major seaport]] was opened on the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] Coast, so as to allow Polish exports and imports to bypass the politically charged [[Free City of Danzig]].

The inter-war period heralded in a new era of Polish politics. Whilst Polish political activists had faced heavy censorship in the decades up until the [[First World War]], the country now found itself trying to establish a new political tradition. For this reason, many exiled Polish activists, such as [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Jan Paderewski]] (who would later become Prime Minister) returned home to help; a great number of them then went on to take key positions in the newly formed political and governmental structures. Tragedy struck in 1922 when [[Gabriel Narutowicz]], inaugural holder of the Presidency, was assassinated at the [[Zachęta|Zachęta Gallery]] in Warsaw by painter and right-wing nationalist [[Eligiusz Niewiadomski]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bitter&quot;/&gt;

The 1926 [[May Coup (Poland)|May Coup]] of [[Józef Piłsudski]] turned rule of the Second Polish Republic over to the [[Sanacja]] movement. By the 1930s Poland had become increasingly authoritarian; a number of 'undesirable' political parties, such as the Polish Communists, had been banned and following Piłsudski's death, the regime, unable to appoint a new leader, began to show its inherent internal weaknesses and unwillingness to cooperate in any way with other political parties.

===World War II===
{{main|History of Poland (1939–1945)|Polish contribution to World War II|World War II crimes in Poland}}

The Sanacja movement controlled Poland until the start of [[World War II]] in 1939, when [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Invasion of Poland (1939)]] on 1 September and the [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] on 17 September, which followed the breaking of the [[Soviet–Polish Non-Aggression Pact]], occurred. [[Siege of Warsaw (1939)|Warsaw capitulated]] on 28 September 1939. As agreed in the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]], Poland was split into two zones, [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|one occupied by Nazi Germany]] while the [[Kresy]], or Borderlands, fell under [[territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|the control of the Soviet Union]]. By 1941, the Soviets had moved hundreds of thousands of Poles into labor camps scattered across the Soviet Union, and the Soviet secret police, [[NKVD]], had executed thousands of Polish prisoners of war.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt;

[[File:10Dyw.JPG|thumb|right|Polish forces stationed abroad constituted the [[Polish contribution to World War II|fourth largest]] allied force of the war]]
Poland made the fourth-largest troop contribution to the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war effort, after the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]], the British and the Americans.{{Ref label|a|a|none}} Polish troops fought under the command of both the [[Polish Government in Exile]] in the [[Western Front (World War II)|theatre of war west of Germany]] and under Soviet leadership in the theatre of war east of Germany. The Polish expeditionary corps, which was controlled by the exiled pre-war government based in [[London]], played an important role in the [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italian]] and [[North African Campaign]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;tobruk&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;including&quot;/&gt; They are particularly well remembered for their conduct at the [[Battle of Monte Cassino]], a conflict which culminated in the raising of a Polish flag over the ruins of the mountain-top abbey by the 12th Podolian Uhlans. The Polish forces in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|theatre of war east of Germany]] were commanded by [[Władysław Anders|Lieutenant General Władysław Anders]] who had received his command from [[Prime Minister of Poland|Prime Minister]] of the [[Polish government-in-exile|exiled government]] [[Władysław Sikorski]]. On the east of Germany, the Soviet-backed [[First Polish Army (1944-1945)|Polish 1st Army]] distinguished itself in the battles for [[Battle of Berlin|Berlin]] and [[Warsaw Uprising|Warsaw]], although its actions in support of the latter have often been criticised.

[[File:Curzon line en.svg|thumb|left|At the end of World War II, the gray territories were transferred from Poland to the Soviet Union, and the pink territories from Germany to Poland]]
Polish servicemen were also active in the theatres of naval and air warfare; during the [[Battle of Britain]] Polish squadrons such as the [[No. 303 Polish Fighter Squadron|No. 303 &quot;Kościuszko&quot; fighter squadron]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Olson&quot;/&gt; achieved great success, and by the end of the war the [[Polish Air Forces in France and Great Britain|exiled Polish Air Forces]] could claim 769 confirmed kills. Meanwhile, the [[Polish Navy]] was active in the protection of convoys in the [[North Sea]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PN&quot;/&gt;

In addition to the organised units of the 1st Army and the Forces in the Nazi-occupied Europe, the domestic underground resistance movement, the [[Armia Krajowa]], or ''Home Army'', fought to free Poland from German occupation and establish an independent Polish state. The [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|wartime resistance movement]] in Poland was one of the three largest resistance movements of the entire war{{Ref label|b|b|none}} and encompassed an unusually broad range of clandestine activities, which essentially functioned as an [[Polish Underground State|underground state]] complete with [[Education in Poland during World War II|degree-awarding universities]] and [[Special Courts|a court system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Salm42&quot;/&gt; The resistance was, however, largely loyal to the exiled government and generally resented the idea of a communist Poland; for this reason, on 1 August 1944 they initiated [[Operation Tempest]] and thus began the [[Warsaw Uprising]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Soviets_and_AK&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google4&quot;/&gt; The objective of the uprising was to drive the German occupiers from the city and help with the larger fight against Germany and the [[Axis powers]], however secondary motives for the uprising sought to see Warsaw liberated before the Soviets could reach the capital, so as to underscore Polish [[sovereignty]] by empowering the Polish Underground State before the Soviet-backed [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] could assume control. However, a lack of available allied military aid and Stalin's reluctance to allow the 1st Army to help their fellow countrymen take the city, ultimately led to the uprising's failure and subsequent [[Planned destruction of Warsaw|planned destruction of the city]].

[[File:Polish Soldier's Grave Warsaw 1945.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Grave of Polish fighter killed during the [[Warsaw Uprising]]. The battle lasted 63 days, and resulted in the deaths of 200,000 people.]]
During the war, German forces, under direct order from [[Adolf Hitler]], set up six major [[extermination camp]]s, all of which were established on Polish territory; these included both the notorious [[Treblinka extermination camp|Treblinka]] and [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] camps. This allowed the Germans to transport the Jews living in the Third Reich outside of &quot;German&quot; territory, as well as to import Jews and other targeted groups from across occupied Europe to be &quot;liquidated,&quot; or killed, in the concentration camps set up in the [[General Government]]. Among such groups were Polish [[intelligentsia]], communists, [[Roma (Romani subgroup)|Roma peoples]] and [[Nazi crimes against Soviet POWs|Soviet Prisoners of War]]. However, since millions of Jews lived in pre-war Poland, Jewish victims make up the largest percentage of all victims of the Nazis' extermination program. It is estimated that, of pre-war Poland's Jewry, approximately 90% (or about 3 million members) were killed. Throughout the [[occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupation]], many members of the Armia Krajowa, supported by the [[Polish government in exile]], and millions of ordinary Poles — at great risk to themselves and their families — engaged in rescuing Jews from the Nazi Germans. Grouped by nationality, Poles represent the largest number of people who rescued Jews during the Holocaust.&lt;ref name=&quot;YV Stats&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lukas&quot;/&gt; To date, 6,135 Poles have been awarded the title of ''[[Righteous among the Nations]]'' by the State of [[Israel]]–more than any other nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;YV Stats&quot;/&gt; Some estimates put the number of Poles involved in rescue efforts at up to 3 million, and credit Poles with saving up to approximately 450,000 Jews from certain death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lukas&quot;/&gt;

At the war's conclusion, Poland's territory [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|was shifted westwards]], pushing the [[Kresy]] in accordance with the [[Curzon Line]]. Meanwhile, the western border moved to the [[Oder-Neisse line]]. As a result, Poland's territory was reduced by 20%, or {{convert|77500|km2|sqmi}}. The shift [[World War II evacuation and expulsion|forced the migration of millions of people]], most of whom were Poles, Germans, Ukrainians, and Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc5&quot;/&gt; [[World War II casualties|Of all the countries involved in the war]], Poland [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|lost the highest percentage of its citizens]]: over 6 million perished — nearly one-fifth of Poland's population — [[Holocaust in Poland|half of them]] Polish Jews. Over 90% of deaths were non-military in nature. Only in the 1970s did Poland again approach its prewar population levels.

===Postwar communist Poland===

At the insistence of [[Joseph Stalin]], the [[Yalta Conference]] sanctioned the formation of a new Polish provisional and pro-Communist coalition government in Moscow, which ignored the [[Polish government-in-exile]] based in London; a move which angered many Poles who considered it a [[Yalta betrayal|betrayal]] by the Allies. In 1944, Stalin had made guarantees to [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Roosevelt]] that he would maintain Poland's sovereignty and allow democratic elections to take place; however, upon achieving victory in 1945, the occupying Soviet authorities organised an election which constituted nothing more than a sham and was ultimately used to claim the 'legitimacy' of Soviet hegemony over Polish affairs. The Soviet Union instituted a new [[communist state|communist]] government in Poland, analogous to much of the rest of the [[Eastern Bloc]]. [[Eastern European Anti-Communist Insurgencies|As elsewhere in Communist Europe]] the Soviet occupation of Poland met with [[Cursed soldiers|armed resistance]] from the outset which continued into the fifties.

Despite widespread objections, the new Polish government accepted the Soviet annexation of the pre-war eastern regions of Poland&lt;ref name=&quot;indianapolis&quot;/&gt; (in particular the cities of [[Wilno]] and [[Lwów]]) and agreed to the permanent garrisoning of [[Red Army]] units on Poland's territory. Military alignment within the [[Warsaw Pact]] throughout the [[Cold War]] came about as a direct result of this change in Poland's political culture and in the European scene came to characterise the fully-fledged integration of Poland into the brotherhood of communist nations.

The [[People's Republic of Poland]] (''Polska Rzeczpospolita Ludowa'') [[Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland|was officially proclaimed in 1952]]. In 1956 after the death of [[Bolesław Bierut]], the régime of [[Władysław Gomułka]] became temporarily more liberal, freeing many people from prison and expanding some personal freedoms. A similar situation repeated itself in the 1970s under [[Edward Gierek]], but most of the time persecution of [[Anti-communist resistance in Poland|anti-communist opposition]] groups persisted. Despite this, Poland was at the time considered to be one of the least repressive states of the [[Soviet Bloc]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PWN_historia&quot;/&gt;

Labour turmoil in 1980 led to the formation of the independent [[trade union]] &quot;[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]&quot; (&quot;''Solidarność''&quot;), which over time became a political force. Despite persecution and imposition of [[Martial law in Poland|martial law in 1981]], it eroded the dominance of the [[Polish United Workers' Party|Communist Party]] and by 1989 had triumphed in Poland's first [[Contract Sejm|partially free and democratic parliamentary elections]] since the end of the Second World War. [[Lech Wałęsa]], a Solidarity candidate, eventually [[Polish presidential election, 1990|won the presidency in 1990]]. The Solidarity movement heralded the [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of communist regimes and parties across Europe]].

===Present-day Poland===
{{main|History of Poland (1989–present)}}
[[File:Flaga RP z UE.jpg|thumb|left|Poland joined [[NATO]] in 1999 and since 2004 has been a member of the [[European Union]].]]
A [[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]] programme, initiated by [[Leszek Balcerowicz]] in the early 1990s enabled the country to transform its socialist-style planned economy into a [[market economy]]. As with all other post-communist countries, Poland suffered temporary slumps in social and economic standards, but it became the first post-communist country to reach its pre-1989 [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] levels, which it achieved by 1995 largely thanks to its booming economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Real GDP growth in CEECs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WHY POLAND?&quot;/&gt;

Most visibly, there were numerous improvements in [[human rights]], such as the [[freedom of speech]], civil liberties (1st class) and political rights (1st class), according to Freedom House. In 1991, Poland became a member of the [[Visegrád Group]] and joined the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) alliance in 1999 along with the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Hungary]]. Poles then voted to join the [[European Union]] in [[Referendums in Poland|a referendum]] in June 2003, with Poland becoming a full member on 1 May 2004. Subsequently Poland joined the [[Schengen Area]] in 2007, as a result of which, [[Borders of Poland|the country's borders]] with other member states of the European Union have been dismantled, allowing for [[Freedom of movement#European Union|full freedom of movement]] within most of the EU.&lt;ref name=&quot;Europe's border-free zone expands&quot;/&gt; In contrast to this, the section of Poland's eastern border now comprising the external EU border with [[Belarus]], [[Russia]] and Ukraine, has become increasingly well protected, and has led in part to the coining of the phrase [[Fortress Europe#Modern times|'Fortress Europe']], in reference to the seeming 'impossibility' of gaining entry to the EU for citizens of the [[former Soviet Union]].

On April 10, 2010, the President of the Republic of Poland, [[Lech Kaczyński]], along with 89 other high-ranking Polish officials [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|died in a plane crash]] near [[Smolensk]], Russia.

==Geography==
{{main|Geography of Poland}}
[[File:Polen topo.jpg|thumb|right|Poland's [[topography]]]]

Poland's territory extends across several geographical regions, between latitudes [[49th parallel north|49°]] and [[55th parallel north|55° N]], and longitudes [[14th meridian east|14°]] and [[25th meridian east|25° E]]. In the north-west is the Baltic seacoast, which extends from the [[Bay of Pomerania]] to the [[Gdańsk Bay|Gulf of Gdańsk]]. This coast is marked by several [[spit (landform)|spits]], coastal lakes (former bays that have been cut off from the sea), and dunes. The largely straight coastline is indented by the [[Szczecin Lagoon]], the [[Bay of Puck]], and the [[Vistula Lagoon]]. The centre and parts of the north lie within the [[North European Plain]].

Rising gently above these lowlands is a geographical region comprising the four hilly districts of [[moraine]]s and [[moraine-dammed lake]]s formed during and after the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice age]]. These lake districts are the [[Pomerania]]n Lake District, the Greater Polish Lake District, the [[Kashubia]]n Lake District, and the [[Masurian Lake District]]. The Masurian Lake District is the largest of the four and covers much of north-eastern Poland. The lake districts form part of the Baltic Ridge, a series of moraine belts along the southern shore of the [[Baltic Sea]].

South of the [[Northern European Lowlands]] lie the regions of [[Silesia]] and [[Masovia]], which are marked by broad ice-age river valleys. Farther south lies the Polish mountain region, including the [[Sudetes]], the [[Kraków-Częstochowa Upland|Cracow-Częstochowa Upland]], the [[Świętokrzyskie Mountains]], and the [[Carpathian Mountains]], including the [[Beskids]]. The highest part of the Carpathians is the [[Tatra Mountains]], along Poland's southern border.

===Geology===
[[File:Śląskie Kamienie - Dívči Kameny.JPG|thumb|left|[[Granite]] [[outcrop]] [[Śląskie Kamienie|Silesian Rocks]] at [[Krkonoše|Karkonosze]] (Giant Mountains), south-western Poland]]

The geological structure of Poland has been shaped by the [[continental collision]] of Europe and Africa over the past 60&amp;nbsp;million years, on the one hand (and the other), by the [[Quaternary]] [[glacier|glaciations]] of northern Europe. Both processes shaped the Sudetes and the Carpathian Mountains. The moraine landscape of northern Poland contains soils made up mostly of sand or [[loam]], while the [[ice age]] [[river valley]]s of the south often contain [[loess]]. The [[Polish Jura|Cracow-Częstochowa Upland]], the [[Pieniny]], and the [[Western Tatras]] consist of [[limestone]], while the [[High Tatras]], the Beskids, and the [[Karkonosze]] are made up mainly of [[granite]] and [[basalt]]s. The [[Polish Jura Chain]] is one of the oldest [[mountain range]]s on earth.

[[File:Giewont z Zakopanego.jpg|thumb|[[Giewont]] in the [[Tatra Mountains]]; the mountainous south is a popular destination for hikers]]
Poland has 70 [[mountain]]s over 2,000&amp;nbsp;metres (6,600&amp;nbsp;ft) in [[elevation]], all in the [[Tatras]]. The Polish Tatras, which consist of the High Tatras and the Western Tatras, is the highest mountain group of Poland and of the entire Carpathian range. In the High Tatras lies Poland’s highest point, the north-western [[Summit (topography)|peak]] of [[Rysy]], {{convert|2499|m|ft|0}} in elevation. At its foot lies the mountain lakes of [[Czarny Staw pod Rysami]] (Black Lake below Mount Rysy), and [[Morskie Oko]] (the Marine Eye).

The second highest mountain group in Poland is the Beskids, whose highest peak is [[Babia Góra]], at {{convert|1725|m|ft|0}}. The next highest mountain groups is the [[Krkonoše|Karkonosze]] in the Sudetes, whose highest point is [[Sněžka|Śnieżka]], at {{convert|1602|m|ft|0}};  [[Śnieżnik Mountains]] whose highest point is [[Králický Sněžník|Śnieżnik]], at {{convert|1425|m|ft|0}}.

Tourists also frequent the [[Bieszczady Mountains]] in the far southeast of Poland, whose highest point in Poland is [[Tarnica]], with an elevation of {{convert|1346|m|ft|0}}, [[Gorce Mountains]] in [[Gorce National Park]], whose highest point is [[Turbacz]], with elevations {{convert|1310|m|ft|0}}, and the Pieniny in [[Pieniny National Park (Poland)|Pieniny National Park]], whose highest point is [[Wysokie Skałki]] (Wysoka), with elevations {{convert|1050|m|ft|0}}. The lowest point in Poland — at {{convert|2|m|ft|1}} below sea level — is at Raczki Elbląskie, near [[Elbląg]] in the Vistula Delta.

[[File:2 SPN 01.jpg|thumb|left|Dunes in [[Słowiński National Park]]]]

The only [[desert]] located in Poland stretches over the [[Zagłębie Dąbrowskie]] (the Coal Fields of [[Dąbrowa Górnicza|Dąbrowa]]) region. It is called the [[Błędów Desert]], located in the [[Silesian Voivodeship]] in southern Poland. It has a total area of {{convert|32|km2|sqmi|0}}. It is one of only five natural deserts in Europe. But also, it is the warmest desert that appears at this [[latitude]]. Błędów Desert was created thousands of years ago by a [[melting glacier]]. The specific geological structure has been of big importance. The average thickness of the sand layer is about {{convert|40|m|ft|0}}, with a maximum of {{convert|70|m|ft|0}}, which made the fast and deep [[drainage]] very easy.

The Baltic Sea activity in [[Słowiński National Park]] created [[sand dunes]] which in the course of time separated [[Gdańsk Bay|the bay]] from the sea. As waves and wind carry sand inland the dunes slowly move, at a speed of {{convert|3|to|10|m|ft|1}} meters per year. Some dunes are quite high – up to {{convert|30|m|ft|0}}. The highest peak of the park — Rowokol ({{convert|115|m|ft|0|disp=s}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]) — is also an excellent [[observation point]].

===Waters===
{{see also|Rivers of Poland|Category:Lakes of Poland}}
[[File:Modlin spichlerz.jpg|thumb|left|[[Vistula River]] in [[Modlin (Nowy Dwór Mazowiecki)|Modlin]]]]
The longest rivers are the [[Vistula River|Vistula]] ({{lang-pl|Wisła}}), {{convert|1047|km|mi}} long; the [[Oder River|Oder]] ({{lang-pl|Odra}}) which forms part of Poland’s western border, {{convert|854|km|mi}} long; its tributary, the [[Warta]], {{convert|808|km|mi}} long; and the [[Bug River|Bug]], a tributary of the Vistula, {{convert|772|km|mi}} long. The Vistula and the Oder flow into the Baltic Sea, as do numerous smaller rivers in Pomerania.

The [[Łyna River|Łyna]] and the [[Angrapa River|Angrapa]] flow by way of the [[Pregolya]] to the Baltic, and the [[Czarna Hańcza]] flows into the Baltic through the [[Neman River|Neman]]. While the great majority of Poland’s rivers drain into the Baltic Sea, Poland’s Beskids are the source of some of the upper tributaries of the [[Orava River|Orava]], which flows via the [[Váh]] and the [[Danube]] to the [[Black Sea]]. The eastern Beskids are also the source of some streams that drain through the [[Dniester]] to the Black Sea.

Poland’s rivers have been used since early times for navigation. The [[Viking]]s, for example, traveled up the Vistula and the Oder in their [[longship]]s. In the Middle Ages and in early modern times, when the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was the breadbasket of Europe; the shipment of grain and other agricultural products down the Vistula toward [[Gdańsk]] and onward to other parts of Europe took on great importance.

With almost ten thousand closed bodies of water covering more than {{convert|1|ha|acre|2}} each, Poland has one of the highest numbers of lakes in the world. In Europe, only [[Finland]] has a greater density of lakes. The largest lakes, covering more than {{convert|100|km2|sqmi|0}}, are [[Śniardwy|Lake Śniardwy]] and [[Lake Mamry]] in [[Masuria]], and [[Łebsko Lake|Lake Łebsko]] and [[Drawsko Lake|Lake Drawsko]] in [[Pomerania]].

In addition to the lake districts in the north (in Masuria, Pomerania, [[Kashubians|Kashubia]], Lubuskie, and [[Greater Poland]]), there is also a large number of mountain lakes in the Tatras, of which the Morskie Oko is the largest in area. The lake with the greatest depth—of more than {{convert|100|m|ft|0}}—is [[Hańcza|Lake Hańcza]] in the Wigry Lake District, east of Masuria in [[Podlaskie Voivodeship]].

[[File:Solina Poland.jpg|thumb|left|Holidaymakers relax at the [[Lake Solina]] near [[Lesko]] in southeastern Poland]]
Among the first lakes whose shores were settled are those in the Greater Polish Lake District. The [[stilt house]] settlement of [[Biskupin]], occupied by more than one thousand residents, was founded before the 7th century BC by people of the [[Lusatian culture]].

Lakes have always played an important role in Polish history and continue to be of great importance to today's modern Polish society. The ancestors of today’s Poles, the [[Polans (western)|Polanie]], built their first fortresses on islands in these lakes. The legendary Prince [[Popiel]] is supposed to have ruled from [[Kruszwica]] on [[Gopło|Lake Gopło]]. The first historically documented ruler of Poland, Duke [[Mieszko I of Poland|Mieszko I]], had his palace on an island in the Warta River in [[Poznań]]. Nowadays the Polish lakes provide an invaluable location for the pursuit of water sports such as [[yachting]] and [[wind-surfing]].

[[File:Zatoka Pucka - Bay of Puck (8).jpg|thumb|right|[[Bay of Puck]] ''(Zatoka Pucka)'' in Poland]]

The Polish Baltic coast is approximately {{convert|528|km|mi|0}} long and extends from [[Świnoujście]] on the islands of [[Usedom]] and [[Wolin]] in the west to [[Krynica Morska]] on the [[Vistula Spit]] in the east. For the most part, Poland has a smooth coastline, which has been shaped by the continual movement of sand by currents and winds. This continual [[erosion]] and [[deposition (geology)|deposition]] has formed cliffs, dunes, and spits, many of which have migrated landwards to close off former [[lagoon]]s, such as Łebsko Lake in Słowiński National Park.

Prior to the end of the [[Second World War]] and subsequent [[Territorial changes of Poland immediately after World War II|change in national borders]], Poland had only a very small coastline; this was situated at the end of the '[[Polish Corridor]]', the only internationally recognised Polish territory which afforded the country access to the sea. However after World War II, the redrawing of Poland's borders and resulting 'shift' of the country's borders left it with a greatly expanded coastline, thus allowing for far greater access to the sea than was ever previously possible. The significance of this event, and importance of it to Poland's future as a major industrialised nation, was allured to by the 1945 [[Poland's Wedding to the Sea|Wedding to the Sea]].

The largest spits are [[Hel Peninsula]] and the Vistula Spit. The largest Polish Baltic island is Wolin. The largest port cities are [[Gdynia]], [[Gdańsk]], [[Szczecin]], and Świnoujście. The main coastal resorts are [[Sopot]], [[Międzyzdroje]], [[Kołobrzeg]], [[Łeba]], [[Władysławowo]], and the Hel Peninsula.

===Land use===
[[File:Gora Cisowa 03.jpg|thumb|left|The patchwork landscape of [[Masuria]]]]

[[:Category:Forests of Poland|Forests]] cover 28.8% of Poland’s land area. More than half of the land is devoted to agriculture. While the total area under cultivation is declining, the remaining farmland is more intensively cultivated.

More than 1% of Poland’s territory, {{convert|3145|km2|sqmi}}, is protected within 23 [[List of national parks of Poland|Polish national parks]]. Three more national parks are projected for [[Masuria]], the [[Polish Jura Chain|Cracow-Częstochowa Upland]], and the eastern [[Beskids]]. In addition, [[wetland]]s along lakes and rivers in central Poland are legally protected, as are coastal areas in the north. There are over 120 areas designated as [[Landscape Park (Poland)|landscape parks]], along with numerous [[nature reserve]]s and other [[Protected areas of Poland|protected areas]].

Present day Poland is a country with great agricultural prospects; there are over two million private farms in the country, and Poland is the leading producer in Europe of [[potatoes]] and [[rye]] and is one of the world's largest producers of [[sugar beets]] and [[triticale]]. This has led Poland to be described on occasion as the future 'bread basket of the [[European Union]]'. However, despite employing around 16% of the workforce, agricultural output in Poland remains low and the industry is characterised as largely inefficient due to the large number of small, independent farms. This situation is likely to soon change for the better with the government debating agricultural reform and currently pursuing the option of auctioning off large tracts of state-owned agricultural land.

===Biodiversity===
[[File:WhiteStorkFamily.jpg|thumb|right|Family of [[White Stork]]. Poland hosts the largest White Stork population.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland.pl – White Stork – About White Stork&quot;/&gt;]]
[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Poland belongs to the Central European province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature]], the territory of Poland can be subdivided into three [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Baltic mixed forests]], [[Central European mixed forests]] and [[Carpathian montane conifer forests]].
[[File:Wisent.jpg|thumb|left|A [[wisent]] in the [[Białowieża Forest]]]]
Many animals that have since died out in other parts of Europe still survive in Poland, such as the [[wisent]] in the [[ancient woodland]] of the [[Białowieża Forest]] and in [[Podlaskie]]. Other such species include the [[brown bear]] in [[Białowieża]], in the Tatras, and in the Beskids, the [[gray wolf]] and the [[Eurasian Lynx]] in various forests, the [[moose]] in northern Poland, and the [[beaver]] in Masuria, Pomerania, and Podlaskie.

In the forests, one also encounters game animals, such as [[red deer]], [[roe deer]] and [[wild boar]]s. In eastern Poland there are a number of ancient woodlands, like [[Białowieża forest]], that have never been cleared by people. There are also large forested areas in the mountains, Masuria, Pomerania, [[Lubusz Land]] and [[Lower Silesia]].

Poland is the most important breeding ground for European [[migratory birds]]. Out of all of the migratory birds who come to Europe for the summer, one quarter breed in Poland, particularly in the lake districts and the wetlands along the [[Biebrza]], the [[Narew]], and the [[Warta]], which are part of nature reserves or national parks.

===Climate===
[[File:Plaża w Pucku - kitesurfers - beach in Puck (4).jpg|thumb|right|The average daytime [[summer]] temperature at sea level along the Baltic coast is {{convert|22|°C|°F|1}}&lt;ref name=&quot;zalewszczecinski&quot;/&gt;]]
The climate is mostly [[temperateness|temperate]] throughout the country. The climate is [[oceanic climate|oceanic]] in the north and west and becomes gradually warmer and [[continental climate|continental]] towards the south and east. Summers are generally warm, with average temperatures between {{convert|18|°C|°F}} and {{convert|30|°C|°F|1}} depending on a region. Winters are rather cold, with average temperatures around {{convert|3|°C|°F|1}} in the northwest and {{convert|-6|°C|°F}} in the northeast. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] falls throughout the year, although, especially in the east; winter is drier than summer.

The warmest region in Poland is [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Lower Silesian]] located in south-western Poland where temperatures in the summer average between {{convert|24|°C|°F|1}} and {{convert|32|°C|°F}} but can go as high as {{convert|34|°C|°F|1}} to {{convert|39|°C|°F|1}} on some days in the warmest month of July and August. The warmest cities in Poland are [[Tarnów]], which is situated in [[Lesser Poland Voivodeship|Lesser Poland]] and [[Wrocław]], which is located in Lower Silesian. The average temperatures in Wrocław are {{convert|20|°C|°F}} in the summer and {{convert|0|°C|°F|1}} in the winter, but [[Tarnów]] has the longest summer in all of Poland, which lasts for 115 days, from mid-May to mid-September. The coldest region of Poland is in the northeast in the [[Podlaskie Voivodeship]] near the border of Belarus. Usually the coldest city is [[Suwałki]]. The climate is affected by cold fronts which come from [[Scandinavia]] and [[Siberia]]. The average temperature in the winter in Podlaskie ranges from {{convert|-6|°C|°F}} to {{convert|-4|°C|°F}}.

==Politics==
{{main|Politics of Poland}}
[[File:Bronisław Komorowski rotcropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[President of the Republic of Poland|President of Poland]] [[Bronisław Komorowski]]]]

Poland is a [[democracy]], with a [[president of the Republic of Poland|president]] as a [[head of state]], whose current [[constitution of the Republic of Poland|constitution]] dates from 1997. The government structure centers on the [[Council of Ministers of the Republic of Poland|Council of Ministers]], led by a [[prime Minister of the Republic of Poland|prime minister]]. The president appoints the [[cabinet (government)|cabinet]] according to the proposals of the prime minister, typically from the majority coalition in the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|Sejm]]. The president is elected by popular vote every five years. The president is [[Bronisław Komorowski]]. Komorowski replaced President [[Lech Kaczyński]] following the latter's death in an April 10, 2010 [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash|air crash]]. The prime minister, [[Donald Tusk]], was appointed in 2007 after his [[Civic Platform]] party made significant gains in that year's [[Polish parliamentary election, 2007|parliamentary elections]]. In 2011, Tusk became the first Polish prime minister in history to be democratically re-elected for a consecutive term.

Polish voters elect a [[bicameralism|bicameral]] parliament consisting of a 460-member lower house (Sejm) and a 100-member Senate ([[Senate of the Republic of Poland|Senat]]). The Sejm is elected under [[proportional representation]] according to the [[d'Hondt method]], a method similar to that used in many parliamentary political systems. The Senat, on the other hand, is elected under the [[First-past-the-post voting|First-past-the-post voting method]], with one senator being returned from each of the 100 constituencies.

[[File:PL Sejm hall.jpg|thumb|right|The Sejm's session chamber in [[Warsaw]]]]
With the exception of ethnic minority parties, only candidates of [[List of political parties in Poland|political parties]] receiving at least 5% of the total national vote can enter the Sejm. When sitting in joint session, members of the Sejm and Senat form the [[National Assembly of the Republic of Poland|National Assembly]] (the ''Zgromadzenie Narodowe''). The National Assembly is formed on three occasions: when a new President takes the [[oath of office]]; when an indictment against the President of the Republic is brought to the State Tribunal (''Trybunał Stanu''); and when a president's permanent incapacity to exercise his duties because of the state of his health is declared. To date only the first instance has occurred.

The [[judiciary|judicial branch]] plays an important role in decision-making. Its major institutions include the [[Supreme Court of the Republic of Poland]] (''Sąd Najwyższy''); the [[Supreme Administrative Court of the Republic of Poland]] (''Naczelny Sąd Administracyjny''); the [[Constitutional Tribunal of the Republic of Poland]] (''Trybunał Konstytucyjny''); and the [[State Tribunal of the Republic of Poland]] (''Trybunał Stanu''). On the approval of the Senat, the Sejm also appoints the [[Polish Ombudsman|ombudsman]] or the Commissioner for Civil Rights Protection (''Rzecznik Praw Obywatelskich'') for a five-year term. The ombudsman has the duty of guarding the observance and implementation of the rights and liberties of Polish [[citizenship|citizens]] and [[residency (domicile)|residents]], of the law and of principles of community life and social justice.

In 2011, Poles elected [[Anna Grodzka]] as the first ever [[transsexual]] MP in European history,&lt;ref name=&quot;newpolandexpress&quot;/&gt; and the second [[transgender]] MP in European history, after the Italian [[Vladimir Luxuria]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Transgender woman poised for seat in Poland's new parliament&quot;/&gt;

===Law===
{{main|Law of Poland}}
[[File:Polishsupremecourt.JPEG|left|upright|thumb|The [[Supreme Court of Poland|Supreme Court]] building in [[Warsaw]]]]
[[File:Manuscript of the Constitution of the 3rd May 1791.PNG|right|thumb|upright|The [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]] has been called the first of its kind in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies 699&quot;/&gt;]]
The [[Constitution of Poland]] is the supreme law in contemporary Poland, and the Polish legal system is based on the principle of civil rights, governed by the code of Civil Law. Historically, the most famous Polish legal act is the [[Constitution of May 3, 1791]]. Historian [[Norman Davies]] describes it as the first of its kind in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies 699&quot;/&gt; The Constitution was instituted as a [[Government Act]] ({{lang-pl|Ustawa rządowa}}) and then adopted on May 3, 1791 by the [[Sejm]] of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. Primarily, it was designed to redress long-standing political defects of the [[federation|federative]] Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth and its [[Golden Liberty]]. Previously only the [[Henrican articles]] signed by each of Poland's elected kings could perform the function of a set of basic laws. The new Constitution introduced political equality between [[townspeople]] and the [[nobility]] (''[[szlachta]]''), and placed the [[peasant]]s under the protection of the government, thus mitigating the worst abuses of [[serfdom]]. The Constitution abolished pernicious parliamentary institutions such as the ''[[liberum veto]]'', which at one time had placed the [[sejm]] at the mercy of any deputy who might choose, or be [[bribery|bribed]] by an interest or foreign power, to have rescinded all the [[legislation]] that had been passed by that sejm. The May 3rd Constitution sought to supplant the existing anarchy fostered by some of the country's [[reactionary]] [[magnate]]s, with a more [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and [[democracy|democratic]] [[constitutional monarchy]].

Unfortunately, the adoption of such a liberal constitution was treated as a grave threat by Poland's more [[Autocrasy|autocratic]] neighbours. In response [[Prussia]], [[Austria]] and [[Russia]] formed an anti-Polish alliance and over the next decade collaborated with one another to [[Partitions of Poland|partition]] their weaker neighbour and ultimately destroy the Polish state. In the words of two of its co-authors, [[Ignacy Potocki]] and [[Hugo Kołłątaj]], the constitution represented &quot;the last will and testament of the expiring Fatherland.&quot; Despite this, its text influenced many later [[democratic movement]]s across the globe.

Poland's current constitution was adopted by the [[National Assembly of Poland]] on 2 April 1997, approved by a national [[referendum]] on 25 May 1997, and came into effect on 17 October 1997. It guarantees a multi-party state, the freedoms of religion, speech and assembly, and specifically casts off many [[Communist]] ideals to create a '[[free market]] [[economic system]]'. It requires public [[official]]s to pursue ecologically sound public policy and acknowledges the inviolability of the home, the right to form [[trade union]]s, and to [[Strike action|strike]], whilst at the same time prohibiting the practices of forced medical experimentation, [[torture]] and [[corporal punishment]].

===Foreign relations===
{{main|Foreign relations of Poland}}
[[File:Radoslaw Sikorski meets Secretary Hillary Clinton.jpg|left|thumb|Foreign Secretary [[Radosław Sikorski|Sikorski]] meets US Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]]]]

In recent years, Poland has extended its responsibilities and position in European and international affairs, supporting and establishing friendly relations with other European nations and a large number of 'developing' countries.

In 1994, Poland became an associate member of the European Union (EU) and its defensive arm, the [[Western European Union]] (WEU), having submitted preliminary documentation for full membership in 1996, it formally joined the European Union in May 2004, along with the other members of the [[Visegrád group]]. In 1996, Poland achieved full [[OECD]] membership, and at the 1997 Madrid Summit was invited to join the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) in the first wave of [[Enlargement of NATO|policy enlargement]] finally becoming a full member of NATO in March 1999.
[[File:Walesa and Tusk EPP.jpg|right|thumb|Prime Minister [[Donald Tusk]] (right) arrives with former President [[Lech Wałęsa]] for the [[European People's Party|EPP]] party congress in [[Warsaw]]]]
As changes since the fall of Communism in 1989 have redrawn the map of central Europe, Poland has tried to forge strong and mutually beneficial relationships with its seven new neighbours, this has notably included signing 'friendship treaties' to replace links severed by the collapse of the [[Warsaw Pact]]. The Poles have forged special relationships with [[Lithuania]] and particularly [[Ukraine]],&lt;ref name=&quot;grushenko&quot;/&gt; with whom they will co-host the UEFA [[Euro 2012]] football tournament, in an effort to firmly anchor these countries within the [[Western world]] and provide them with an alternative to aligning themselves with the [[Russian Federation]] respectively. Despite many positive developments in the region, Poland has found itself in a position where it must seek to defend the rights of ethnic Poles living in the [[former Soviet Union]]; this is particularly true of [[Belarus]], where in 2005 the [[Lukashenko]] regime launched a campaign against the Polish ethnic minority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bordering on madness: Belarus mistreats its Polish minority&quot;/&gt;

Poland is the sixth most populous member state of the European Union and, ever since joining in 2004, has pursued policies to increase its role in European affairs. Poland has a grand total of 51 representatives in the [[European Parliament]] and in addition to this, since 14 July 2009, former [[Prime Minister of Poland]] [[Jerzy Buzek]], has been [[President of the European Parliament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jerzy Buzek elected President of the European Parliament&quot;/&gt;

===Administrative divisions===
{{main|Administrative division of Poland}}

Poland's current [[Voivodeships of Poland|voivodeships]] (provinces) are largely based on the country's historic regions, whereas those of the past two decades (to 1998) had been centred on and named for individual cities. The new units range in area from less than {{convert|10000|km2|sqmi}} for Opole Voivodeship to more than {{convert|35000|km2|sqmi}} for Masovian Voivodeship. Administrative authority at voivodeship level is shared between a government-appointed [[voivode]] (governor), an elected regional assembly (''[[Voivodeship sejmik|sejmik]]'') and an executive elected by that assembly.

The voivodeships are subdivided into ''[[powiat]]s'' (often referred to in [[English language|English]] as counties), and these are further divided into ''[[gmina]]s'' (also known as communes or municipalities). Major cities normally have the status of both ''gmina'' and ''powiat''. Poland currently has 16 voivodeships, 379 powiats (including 65 cities with ''powiat'' status), and 2,478 ''gminas''.

===Military===
{{main|Polish Armed Forces}}
[[File:Krzesiny 8RB.JPG|thumb|right|[[Polish Air Force]] [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]]]]
The Polish armed forces are composed of four branches: [[Polish Land Forces|Land Forces]] (''Wojska Lądowe''), [[Polish Navy|Navy]] (''Marynarka Wojenna''), [[Polish Air Force|Air Force]] (''Siły Powietrzne'') and [[Special forces of Poland|Special Forces]] (''Wojska Specjalne''). The military is subordinate to the [[Ministry of National Defence of the Republic of Poland|Minister for National Defence]], however its sole commander in chief is the President of the Republic.

The Polish army currently consists of 65,000 active personnel, whilst the navy and air force respectively employ 14,300 and 26,126 servicemen and women. The Polish Navy is one of the larger navies on the Baltic Sea and is mostly involved in Baltic operations such as search and rescue provision for the section of the Baltic under Polish command, as well as hydrographic measurements and research; recently however, the Polish Navy played a more international role as part of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], providing logistical support for the [[United States Navy]]. The current position of the Polish Air Force is much the same; it has routinely taken part in [[Baltic Air Policing]] assignments, but otherwise, with the exception of a number of units serving in [[Afghanistan]], has seen no active combat since the end of the Second World War. In 2003, the [[F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16C]] Block 52 was chosen as the new general multi-role fighter for the air force, the first deliveries taking place in November 2006; it is expected (2010) that the Polish Air Force will create three squadrons of F-16s, which will all be fully operational by 2012.

[[File:Polish Army soldiers in Afghanistan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Polish Army]] vehicles and troops on patrol in [[Afghanistan]]]]

The most important mission of the armed forces is the defence of Polish territorial integrity and Polish interests abroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;mil&quot;/&gt; Poland's national security goal is to further integrate with [[NATO]] and European defence, economic, and political institutions through the modernisation and reorganisation of its military.&lt;ref name=&quot;mil&quot; /&gt;
Currently the armed forces is being re-organised according to NATO standards, and as of 1 January 2010, the transition to an entirely contract-based military has been completed. Previously male citizens were expected to complete a period of active service with the military; since 2007 up until the amendment of the law on conscription, the obligatory term of service was nine months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poland ends army conscription&quot;/&gt;

Polish military doctrine reflects the same defensive nature as that of its NATO partners. From 1953 to 2009 Poland was a large contributor to various [[United Nations]] peacekeeping missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;mil&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Polska zakończyła udział w misjach po auspicjami ONZ – Wiadomości z kraju i ze świata – Gazeta Prawna – Partner pracodawcy, narzędzie specjalisty&quot;/&gt; The Polish Armed Forces took part in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], deploying 2,500 soldiers in the south of that country and commanding the 17-nation [[Multinational force in Iraq]].

The military was temporarily, but severely, affected by the loss of many of its top commanders in the wake the [[2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash]] near Smolensk, Russia, which killed all 96 passengers and crew, including, amongst others, the Chief of the Polish Army's General Staff [[Franciszek Gągor]] and Polish Air Force commanding general [[Andrzej Błasik]]. They were en route from Warsaw to attend an event to mark the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre, whose site is commemorated approximately 19&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Smolensk]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Accident Database&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Senior Polish figures killed in plane crash&quot;/&gt;

===Law enforcement and emergency services===
[[File:Central Silesian Park - Mounted police 02.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Mounted officers of the [[Policja|State Police]] in [[Chorzów]]]]
{{main|Law enforcement in Poland|Emergency medical services in Poland}}

Poland has a highly developed system of law enforcement with a long history of effective policing by the [[Policja|State Police Service]]. The structure of law enforcement agencies within Poland is a multi-tier one, with the State Police providing criminal-investigative services, [[Municipal Police]] serving to maintain public order and a number of other specialised agencies, such as the [[Polish Border Guard]], acting to fulfil their assigned missions. In addition to these state services, private security companies are also common, although they possess no powers assigned to state agencies, such as, for example, the power to make an arrest or detain a suspect.

Emergency services in Poland consist of the [[Emergency medical services in Poland|Emergency Medical Services]], [[Search and rescue#Poland|Search and Rescue]] units of the [[Polish Armed Forces]] and [[Fire Service|State Fire Service]]. Emergency medical services in Poland are, unlike other services, provided for by local and regional government.

Since joining the [[European Union]] all of Poland's emergency services have been undergoing major restructuring and have, in the process, acquired large amounts of new equipment and staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;– 15 tys. zimowych mundurów trafi do jednostek&quot;/&gt; All emergency services personnel are now uniformed and can be easily recognised thanks to a number of innovative design features, such as reflective paint and printing, present throughout their service dress and vehicle liveries. In addition to this, in an effort to comply with EU standards and safety regulations, the police and other agencies have been steadily replacing and modernising their fleets of vehicles; this has left them with thousands of new automobiles, as well as many new aircraft, boats and helicopters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nowe radiowozy dla policji&quot;/&gt;

==Economy==
{{main|Economy of Poland}}
[[File:Warsaw7ob.jpg|thumb|Financial centre of [[Warsaw]]]]

Poland's high-income economy&lt;ref name=&quot;worldbank8&quot;/&gt; is considered to be one of the healthiest of the post-Communist countries and is currently one of the fastest growing within the EU. Having a strong domestic market, low private debt, flexible currency, and not being dependent on a single export sector, Poland is the only European economy to have avoided the [[late-2000s recession]].&lt;ref name=&quot;How Poland became only EU nation to avoid recession&quot;/&gt; Since the [[Revolutions of 1989|fall of the communist government]], Poland has steadfastly pursued a policy of [[neoliberalism|liberalising]] the economy and today stands out as a successful example of the transition from a [[planned economy|centrally planned economy]] to a primarily [[market economy|market-based economy]]. In 2009 Poland had the highest GDP growth in the EU. As of February 2012, the Polish economy has not entered a recession in the wake of the global financial crisis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Central Europe Risks Downgrades on Worsening Finances (Update1)&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zloty to Gain, Says LBBW, Most Accurate Forecaster (Update1)&quot;/&gt;

The [[privatization]] of small and medium state-owned companies and a liberal law on establishing new firms have allowed the development of an aggressive private sector. As a consequence, [[consumer protection|consumer rights]] organizations have also appeared.&lt;!--such as Urząd Ochrony Konkurencji i Konsumentów, Federacja Konsumentów, or Stowarzyszenie Konsumentów Polskich. --&gt; Restructuring and privatisation of &quot;sensitive sectors&quot; such as [[coal]], [[steel]], [[rail transport]] and energy has been continuing since 1990. Between 2007 and 2010, the government plans to float twenty public companies on the [[Warsaw Stock Exchange]], including parts of the coal industry. The biggest privatisations have been the sale of the national [[Telecommunication|telecoms]] firm [[Telekomunikacja Polska]] to [[France Télécom]] in 2000, and an issue of 30% of the shares in Poland's largest bank, [[PKO Bank Polski]], on the Polish stockmarket in 2004.

The Polish banking sector is the largest in [[Central Europe|central]] and [[eastern Europe]] as well being as the largest and the most highly developed sector of the country’s financial markets. It is regulated by the [[Polish Financial Supervision Authority]]. During the transformation to a market-oriented economy, the government privatized some banks, recapitalized the rest and introduced legal reforms that made the sector competitive. This has attracted a significant number of strategic foreign investors. Poland’s banking sector has approximately 5 domestic banks, a network of nearly 600 cooperative banks and 18 branches of foreign-owned banks. In addition, foreign investors have controlling stakes in nearly 40 commercial banks, which make up 68% of the banking capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;thomaswhite&quot;/&gt;

Poland has a large number of private farms in its [[agriculture|agricultural]] sector, with the potential to become a leading producer of food in the European Union. Structural reforms in [[health care]], [[education]], the [[pension]] system, and state administration have resulted in larger-than-expected fiscal pressures. Warsaw leads Central Europe in foreign investment.&lt;ref name=&quot;warsawvoice&quot;/&gt; [[Gross domestic product|GDP]] growth had been strong and steady from 1993 to 2000 with only a short slowdown from 2001 to 2002.

The economy had growth of 3.7% annually in 2003, a rise from 1.4% annually in 2002. In 2004, GDP growth equaled 5.4%, in 2005 3.3% and in 2006 6.2%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polish Information and Foreign Investment Agency. News&quot;/&gt; According to [[Eurostat]] data, Polish PPS GDP per capita stood at 61% of the EU average in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;GDP per capita in PPS&quot;/&gt;

Although the Polish economy is currently undergoing [[economic development]], there are many challenges ahead. The most notable task on the horizon is the preparation of the economy (through continuing deep structural reforms) to allow Poland to meet the strict economic criteria for entry into the [[Eurozone]]. According to the Polish foreign minister [[Radosław Sikorski]] the country could [[Enlargement of the eurozone|join the eurozone]] before 2016.&lt;ref name=&quot;businessweek&quot;/&gt; Some businesses may already accept the euro as payment. In addition, the ability to establish and conduct business easily has been cause for economic hardship as the World Economic Forum recently ranked Poland near the bottom of OECD countries in terms of the clarity, efficiency and neutrality of its legal framework for firm to settle disputes.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Global Competitiveness Report 2010-2011&quot;/&gt; A report concluded that on-going foreign business disputes issues may &quot;have damaged Poland’s reputation as an attractive location for FDI&quot; by reinforcing the impression of &quot;Poland’s substandard reputation for maintaining an efficient and neutral framework to settle business disputes involving multinational foreign investors.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Foreign Direct Investments in Developing Nations: Issues in Telecommunications and the Modernization of Poland&quot;/&gt; Ernst &amp; Young's 2010 European attractiveness survey reported that Poland saw a 52% decrease in FDI job creation and a 42% decrease in number of FDI projects since 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waking up to the new economy: Ernst &amp; Young's 2010 European attractiveness survey&quot;/&gt;

Average salaries in the enterprise sector in December 2010 were 3,848 PLN (1,012 euro or 1,374 US dollars)&lt;ref name=&quot;Communication on the average monthly salary in enterprise sector excluding payments from profit awards in December 2010&quot;/&gt; and growing sharply.&lt;ref name=&quot;OECD Economic Outlook No. 82 – Poland&quot;/&gt; Salaries vary between the regions: the [[median]] wage in the capital city Warsaw was 4,603 PLN (1,177 euro or 1,680 US dollars) while in [[Kielce]] it was only 3,083 PLN (788 euro or 1125 US dollars). Differences in salaries in various districts of Poland is even higher and range from 2,020 PLN (517 euro or 737 US dollars) in [[Kępno County]], which is located in [[Greater Poland Voivodeship]] to 5,616 (1,436 euro or 2,050 US dollars) in [[Lubin County]], which lies in [[Lower Silesian Voivodeship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Statistic Office of Poland(GUS)&quot;/&gt;

According to a [[Credit Suisse]] report, Poles are the second wealthiest (after [[Czech Republic|Czechs]]) of the Central European peoples.&lt;ref name=&quot;thenews&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;forsal&quot;/&gt; This makes Poland an attractive destination for many guest workers particularly from Ukraine, Belarus, Russia and Vietnam.&lt;ref name=&quot;cespi&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagotribune1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;egospodarka1&quot;/&gt; Even though Poland is rather an ethnically homogeneous country, the number of foreigners is growing every year.&lt;ref name=&quot;egospodarka1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;interia&quot;/&gt;

Since the [[United Kingdom]], [[Ireland]] and some other European countries opened their job markets for Poles, many workers, especially from rural regions, have left the country to seek a better wages abroad. However, there is a rapid growth of the salaries, booming economy, strong value of Polish currency, and quickly decreasing unemployment (from 14.2% in May 2006 to 6.7% in August 2008).&lt;ref name=&quot;archive&quot;/&gt;
Commodities produced in Poland include: electronics, cars ([[Arrinera]], [[Leopard (car)|Leopard]]), buses ([[Autosan]], [[Solaris Bus &amp; Coach|Solaris]], [[Solbus]]), helicopters ([[PZL|PZL Świdnik]]), transport equipment, locomotives, planes ([[PZL Mielec]]), ships, military engineering (including [[PT-91 Twardy|tanks]], [[PZA Loara|SPAAG systems]]), medicines (Polpharma, Polfa), food, clothes, glass, pottery ([[Bolesławiec]]), chemical products and others.

Poland is recognised as having an economy with significant development potential, overtaking the [[Netherlands]] in mid-2010 to become Europe's sixth largest economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;fDi: Poland Primed for Golden Decade&quot;/&gt; [[Foreign Direct Investment]] in Poland has remained strong ever since the country's re-democratisation following the [[Polish Round Table Agreement|Round Table Agreement]] in 1989. Despite this, problems do exist, and further progress in achieving success depends largely on the government's privatisation of Poland's remaining state industries and continuing development and modernisation of the economy.

Poland is a major part of the global tourism market and is currently experiencing an upward trend in its number of visitors; this began shortly after joining the European Union.&lt;ref name=&quot;Travel And Tourism in Poland&quot;/&gt; Tourism in Poland contributes to the country's overall economy and makes up a relatively large proportion of the country's service market. 

The most attractive urban destinations for tourists are [[Kraków]], [[Wrocław]], [[Gdańsk]], [[Warsaw]], [[Poznań]], [[Lublin]] and [[Toruń]]; in addition to these the historic site of the [[Auschwitz]] German concentration camp near [[Oświęcim]] is a noteworthy place of pilgrimage and a now constitutes a major monument to the prevention of war and suffering in Southern Poland. 

Popular areas of natural beauty include northeast Poland's [[Masurian Lake District]] and [[Białowieża Forest]], in southern [[Karkonosze]], [[Table Mountains]], [[Tatra Mountains]] and [[Bieszczady Mountains]]. 

Poland's main tourist offerings are thought to be based around city-sightseeing and extra-urban historical monuments, business trips, qualified tourism, agrotourism, mountain [[hiking]] and [[climbing]] among others.

Poland was the 17th [[World Tourism rankings|most visited country]] by foreign tourists in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot; turism&quot;/&gt;

===Energy===
[[File:Elektrownia Zeran.jpg|thumb|left|Żerań power station in [[Warsaw]]]]
{{main|Energy in Poland}}
The electricity generation sector in Poland is still largely [[fossil fuel|fossil-fuel]] based. Many power plants nationwide use Poland's position as a major European exporter of coal to their advantage by continuing to use coal as the primary raw material in production of their energy; in 2007, hard bituminous coal contributed 48% of energy generation, brown coal and gas 12% each and oil 23%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Use of renewable fuel in Central and Eastern Europe&quot;/&gt; Currently the three largest Polish coal mining firms (''[[Weglokoks]], [[Kompania Węglowa]] and [[Jastrzebska Spolka Weglowa|JSW]]'') extract around 100 million tonnes of coal annually; all three of these companies are key constituents of the [[Warsaw Stock Exchange]]'s lead economic indexes.

Renewable forms of energy currently only account for a small proportion of Poland's full energy generation capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;EU Commission – Energy factsheet P74&quot;/&gt; However, the national government has set targets for the development of renewable energy sources in Poland which should see the portion of power produced by renewable resources climb to 7.5% by 2010 and 15% by 2020. This is to be achieved mainly through the construction of [[wind farm]]s and a number of [[hydroelectric]] stations.

Poland is thought to have around 164,800,000,000 m³ of proven natural gas reserves and around 96,380,000 barrels of proven oil reserves. These reserves are currently attended to and exploited by energy supply companies such as [[PKN Orlen]] (''the only Polish company listed in the [[Fortune Global 500]]''). However, due to the small amounts of fossil fuels naturally occurring in Poland not being enough to satisfy the full energy consumption needs of the population and thus need to buy from abroad, the country is considered to be a net importer of oil and natural gas.

===Transport===

{{main|Transport in Poland}}
Today transport in Poland is provided by means of [[Rail transport in Poland|rail]], [[Roads and expressways in Poland|road]], [[Polish Merchant Navy|shipping]] and [[List of airports in Poland|air travel.]] Positioned in Central Europe and with an eastern border compromising the largest external border of the [[Schengen Area]] with the rest of [[East-Central Europe]], Poland has long been, and remains a key country through which imports to and exports from the European Union pass.

Since joining the EU in 2004, Poland has invested large amounts of money into the modernisation of its transport networks. The country now has a developing expressways network composed of motorways such as the [[A4 autostrada (Poland)|A4]] and express roads such as the [[Expressway S7 (Poland)|S7]]. In addition to these newly built roads, many local and regional roads are being rebuilt as part of a national programme to rebuild all roads in Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Road Rebuilding Program (Polish)&quot;/&gt;
[[File:A4 Krakow 20070815 1026.jpg|left|thumb|The [[A4 autostrada (Poland)|A4 Motorway]] near [[Kraków]]]]
Again, with regard to railways, much the same situation is taking place. The Polish authorities have begun a program by which they hope to increase operating speeds across the entire Polish rail network; this is particularly true of a number of national trunk routes which are expected to soon receive new rolling stock capable of speeds over 200&amp;nbsp;km/h. Finally, there is a plan to introduce [[High-speed rail in Poland|high speed rail to Poland]] from around 2014. The Polish government recently revealed that it intends to connect all major cities to a future high-speed rail network by 2020.&lt;ref name=&quot;dec23&quot;/&gt; Most intercity rail operations in Poland are operated by [[PKP Intercity]] whilst regional trains are run by a number of operators, the largest of which is [[Przewozy Regionalne]].

The air and maritime transport markets in Poland are largely well developed. Poland has a number of international airports; the largest of which is [[Warsaw Chopin Airport]], the primary global hub for [[LOT Polish Airlines]], which is the largest airline of [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and one of the world's oldest airlines still in operation today. Seaports exist all along Poland's Baltic coast, with most freight operations using either [[Port of Gdynia|Gdynia]] or [[Port of Gdańsk|Gdańsk]] as their base. Passenger ferries link Poland with [[Scandinavia]] all year round; these services are provided from Gdańsk by [[Polferries]], [[Stena Line]] from Gdynia and [[Unity Line]] from the [[Port of Świnoujście]].

According to Frost &amp; Sullivan's Country Industry Forecast the country is becoming an interesting location for [[research and development]] investments.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; Multinational companies such as: ABB, [[Delphi Corporation|Delphi]], [[GlaxoSmithKline]], [[Google]], [[Hewlett–Packard]], [[IBM]], [[Intel]], [[LG Electronics]], [[Microsoft]], [[Motorola]], [[Siemens]] and [[Samsung]] have set up research and development centres in Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; Over 40 research and development centers and 4,500 researchers make Poland the biggest research and development hub in Central and Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;chicagotribune1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt; Companies chose Poland because of the availability of highly qualified labour force, presence of universities, support of authorities, and the largest market in Central Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;
[[File:Warsaw Easter 2008 028.jpg|right|thumb|Warsaw's [[Staszic Palace]] is home to the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]]]
Today Poland's [[tertiary education]] institutions; traditional [[List of universities in Poland|universities]] (found in its major cities), as well as technical, medical, and economic institutions, employ around 61,000 researchers and members of staff. There are around 300 research and development institutes, with about 10,000 researchers. In total, there are around 91,000 scientists in Poland today. However, in the 19th and 20th centuries many Polish scientists worked abroad; one of the greatest of these exiles was [[Maria Skłodowska-Curie]], a physicist and chemist who lived much of her life in France. In the first half of the 20th century, Poland was a flourishing centre of mathematics. Outstanding Polish mathematicians formed the [[Lwów School of Mathematics]] (with [[Stefan Banach]], [[Hugo Steinhaus]], [[Stanisław Ulam]]) and [[Warsaw School of Mathematics]] (with [[Alfred Tarski]], [[Kazimierz Kuratowski]], [[Wacław Sierpiński]]). The events of [[World War II]] pushed many of them into exile. Such was the case of [[Benoît Mandelbrot]], whose family left Poland when he was still a child. An alumnus of the Warsaw School of Mathematics was [[Antoni Zygmund]], one of the shapers of 20th-century [[mathematical analysis]].

According to a KPMG report&lt;ref name=&quot;Why Poland?&quot;/&gt; 80% of Poland's current investors are content with their choice and willing to reinvest. In 2006, Intel decided to double the number of employees in its research and development centre in Gdańsk.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

===Communications===
{{main|Telecommunications in Poland}}
[[File:Poczta Główna Bydg od Brdy a.jpg|thumb|left|The Main Municipal Post Office of [[Bydgoszcz]]]]
The share of the telecom sector in the GDP is 4.4% (end of 2000 figure), compared to 2.5% in 1996. Nevertheless, despite high expenditures for telecom infrastructure (the coverage increased from 78 users per 1,000 inhabitants in 1989 to 282 in 2000).

The value of the telecommunication market is zl 38.2bn (2006), and it grew by 12.4% in 2007 PMR.&lt;ref name=&quot;Key data on IT and telecoms market in Poland, 2004–2006&quot;/&gt; The coverage mobile cellular is over 1000 users per 1000 people (2007). Telephones—mobile cellular: 38.7 million (Onet.pl &amp; GUS Report, 2007), telephones—main lines in use: 12.5 million (Telecom Team Report, 2005).
[[File:TPSA tower warsaw.JPG|thumb|upright|right|[[Telekomunikacja Polska|TP S.A.]] headquarters in [[Warsaw]]]]
With regard to internet access, the most popular [[ADSL]] services for home users in Poland are [[Neostrada]] provided by [[TPSA]], and Net24 provided by [[Netia]]. Business users as well as some home users use Internet DSL TP also offered by TPSA. According to Eurostat, OECD and others, Internet access in Poland is amidst the most expensive in Europe. This is mostly caused by the lack of competitiveness. New operators, such as Dialog and GTS Energis are making their own provider lines and offer more attractive and cheaper service. Recently, the Polish Office of Electronical Communication passed a bill forcing the TPSA to rent 51% of their ADSL lines to other ISPs for 60% lower prices. This move will definitely affect the prices of DSL in Poland.

The public [[Mail|postal service]] in Poland is operated by Poczta Polska (The Polish Post). It was created on October 18, 1558, when king [[Zygmunt August]] established a permanent postal route from [[Kraków]] to [[Venice]] (later also to [[Wilno]]) in order to manage affairs in [[Italy]] that arose after the death of [[Queen Bona]], his mother. Since then the service was dissolved on a number of occasions, most notably during the [[partitions of Poland]]. After regaining independence in 1918, the united territory of Poland was in need of a uniform network of communication. Thus, the interwar period saw the rapid development of the postal system as new services were introduced (e.g. [[Wire transfer|money transfers]], payment of pensions, delivery of magazines, [[airmail|air mail]]). Although during [[Polish uprisings|national uprisings]] and in the course of wars communication was provided mainly through field post, which was subject to military authority, postmen always took active part in the fight for independence by secretly delivering parcels and documents, or by providing vital information about the enemy. Many important events in the history of Poland involved the postal service, like the heroic [[Defense of the Polish Post Office in Danzig|Defence of the Polish Post Office in Gdańsk]] in 1939 and the participation of the Polish Scouts' Postal Service in the [[Warsaw Uprising]]. During the difficult times of the Second World War, the Polish Post in exile would lift up the spirits of compatriots by issuing postage stamps. Nowadays the service is a modern, functioning state-owned company which provides a number of standard and express delivery options, as well as operating the Polish postal home-delivery service. The postal service is currently expanding into the provision of logistical services.

==Demographics==
{{main|Demographics of Poland}}
Poland, with 38,116,000 inhabitants,&lt;ref name=&quot;CSO_2008&quot;/&gt; has the eighth-largest population in Europe and the sixth-largest in the [[European Union]]. It has a population density of 122 inhabitants per square kilometer (328 per square mile).

[[File:Gdańsk kamienice przy Długim Targu.jpg|thumb|left|[[Long Market]] in [[Gdańsk]] filled with picturesque [[Mannerist architecture and sculpture in Poland|Dutch style]] [[Kamienica (architecture)|tenements]] is a favourite [[meeting point|meeting place]] in the [[Kashubians|Kashubian]] capital.]]

Poland historically contained [[Historical demography of Poland|many languages, cultures and religions]] on its soil. The country had a particularly large Jewish population prior to [[World War II]], when the [[Nazism|Nazi Germany]]'s regime led to [[The Holocaust]]. It caused Poland's Jewish population, estimated at 3&amp;nbsp;million before the war, to drop to just 300,000. The outcome of the war, particularly the [[Territorial changes of Poland after World War II|shift of Poland's borders]] to the area between the [[Curzon Line]] and the [[Oder-Neisse line]], coupled with post-war [[World War II evacuation and expulsion|expulsion of minorities]], significantly reduced the country's ethnic diversity. Over 7 million Germans fled or were expelled from the Polish side of the Oder-Neisse boundary.&lt;ref name=&quot;cadmus&quot;/&gt;

According to the [[Polish census of 2002|2002 census]], 36,983,700 people, or 96.74% of the population, consider themselves [[Poles|Polish]], while 471,500 (1.23%) declared another nationality, and 774,900 (2.03%) did not declare any nationality. The largest minority nationalities and ethnic groups in Poland are [[Silesians]] (173,153 according to the census), [[German minority in Poland|Germans]] (152,897 according to the census, 92% in [[Opole Voivodeship]] and [[Silesian Voivodeship]]), [[Belarusians]] (c. 49,000), [[Ukrainians]] (c. 30,000), [[Lithuanian people|Lithuanians]], [[Russians]], [[Romani people|Roma]], [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jews]], [[Lemkos]], [[Slovaks]], [[Czechs]], and [[Lipka Tatars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tolerance and Cultural Diversity Discourses in Poland&quot;/&gt; Among foreign citizens, the [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] are the largest ethnic group, followed by [[Greeks]] and [[Armenians]].

[[File:Krakau Markt.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Main Market Square, Kraków|Main Market Square]] in [[Kraków]] is the heart of Poland's southern [[cultural capital]]]]

The [[Polish language]], part of the [[West Slavs|West Slavic]] branch of the [[Slavic languages]], functions as the [[official language]] of Poland. Until recent decades [[Russian language|Russian]] was commonly learned as a second language but has been replaced by English and German as the most common second languages studied and spoken.&lt;ref name=&quot;Poles return to Russian language&quot;/&gt;

In recent years, Poland's population has decreased because of an increase in emigration and a sharp drop in the birth rate. Since Poland's accession to the European Union, a significant number of Poles have emigrated, primarily to the United Kingdom, Germany and [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] in search of work and better work opportunities abroad. In April 2007, the Polish population of the United Kingdom had risen to approximately 300,000, and estimates place the Polish population in Ireland at 65,000. Some sources claim that the number of Polish citizens who emigrated to the UK after 2004 is as high as 2 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;UK lets in more Poles than there are in Warsaw&quot;/&gt;
This, however, is contrasted by a recent trend that shows that more Poles are entering the country than leaving it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tide turns as Poles end great migration&quot;/&gt;

Polish minorities are still present in the neighboring countries of Ukraine, Belarus, and Lithuania, as well as in other countries (see [[Poles]] for population numbers). Altogether, the number of ethnic Poles living abroad is estimated to be around 20&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polish Diaspora (Polonia) Worldwide&quot;/&gt; The largest number of [[Polish diaspora|Poles outside of Poland]] can be found in the [[Polish American|United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Centers of Polish Immigration in the World – USA and Germany&quot;/&gt;

Until [[World War II]], Poland was a religiously diverse society, in which substantial [[Judaism|Jewish]], [[Protestantism|Protestant]] and [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Christian Orthodox]] minorities coexisted with a [[Roman Catholic]] majority. As a result of the [[Holocaust]] and the post–World War II [[flight and expulsion of Germans from Poland during and after World War II|flight and expulsion of German]] and [[Operation Vistula|Ukrainian]] populations, Poland has become overwhelmingly Roman Catholic.

From 16 October 1978 until his death on 2 April 2005 Karol Józef Wojtyła (later Pope [[John Paul II]]), a natural born Pole, reigned as [[Pope|Supreme Pontiff]] of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic Church]] and Sovereign of [[Vatican City]]. His was the [[List of popes by length of reign|second-longest documented pontificate]]; only [[Pope Pius IX]] served longer. He has been the only [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Poles|Polish]] Pope to date, and was the first non-[[Italian people|Italian]] Pope since [[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[Pope Adrian VI]] in 1522.&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;/&gt; Additionally he is credited with having played a significant role in hastening the downfall of communism in Poland and throughout [[Central and Eastern Europe]]; he is famously quoted as having, at the height of communism in 1979, told Poles &quot;not be afraid&quot;, later praying: &quot;Let your Spirit descend and change the image of the land... this land&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Domínguez&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Communism&quot;/&gt; He is a deeply revered figure within Polish society, and his passing in 2005 was met with large-scale outpourings of national grief.

Religious minorities include [[Polish Orthodox Church|Polish Orthodox]] (about 506,800),&lt;ref name=&quot;CSO_2008&quot;/&gt; various Protestants (about 150,000),&lt;ref name=&quot;CSO_2008&quot;/&gt; [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] (126,827),&lt;ref name=&quot;CSO_2008&quot;/&gt; [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]], [[Mariavite Church|Mariavites]], [[Polish National Catholic Church|Polish Catholics]], [[History of the Jews in Poland|Jews]], and [[Islam in Poland|Muslims]] (including the [[Tatars]] of [[Białystok]]). Members of Protestant churches include about 77,500 in the largest [[Evangelical-Augsburg Church in Poland|Evangelical-Augsburg Church]],&lt;ref name=&quot;CSO_2008&quot;/&gt; and a similar number in smaller [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] and [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] churches.

Freedom of religion is now guaranteed by the 1989 statute of the Polish Constitution,&lt;ref name=&quot;Wyznania religijne&quot;/&gt; enabling the emergence of additional denominations.&lt;ref name=&quot;www10&quot;/&gt; However, because of pressure from the Polish [[Historical episcopate|Episcopate]], the exposition of [[doctrine]] has entered the public education system as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Borecki&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wiadomosci&quot;/&gt; According to a 2007 survey, 72% of respondents were not opposed to [[catechism|religious instruction]] in public schools; alternative courses in ethics are available only in one percent of the entire public educational system.&lt;ref name=&quot;gazeta11&quot;/&gt;

Famous sites of Christian pilgrimage in Poland include the [[Jasna Góra Monastery|Monastery of Jasna Góra]] in the southern Polish city of [[Częstochowa]], as well as the [[Holy Father John Paul II Family Home in Wadowice|Family home of John Paul II]] in [[Wadowice]] just outside of [[Kraków]].

===Health===
{{Main|Health in Poland}}
[[File:Poland Population Pyramid 2012.png|thumb|right|[[Population pyramid]] of Poland in 2012 from [[International Futures]]]]
Poland's healthcare system is based on an all-inclusive insurance system. State subsidised healthcare is available to all Polish citizens who are covered by this general health insurance program. However, it is not compulsory to be treated in a state-run hospital as a number of private medical complexes do exist nationwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;justlanded&quot;/&gt;

All medical service providers and hospitals in Poland are subordinate to the [[Ministry of Health of the Republic of Poland|Polish Ministry of Health]], which provides oversight and scrutiny of general medical practice as well as being responsible for the day to day administration of the healthcare system. In addition to these roles, the ministry is also tasked with the maintenance of standards of hygiene and patient-care.

[[File:MUG Hospital Bldg 1.jpg|thumb|left|Main clinical building of the [[Gdańsk Medical University|Gdańsk University Medical Centre]] in [[Wrzeszcz]]]]
Hospitals in Poland are organised according to the regional administrative structure, resultantly most towns have their own hospital ''(Szpital Miejski)''. Larger and more specialised medical complexes tend only to be found in major cities, with some even more specialised units located only in the capital, [[Warsaw]]. However, all [[voivodeship]]s have their own general hospital (most have more than one), all of which are obliged to have a trauma centre; these types of hospital, which are able to deal with almost all medical problems are called 'regional hospitals' ''(Szpital Wojewódzki)''. The last category of hospital in Poland is that of specialised medical centres, an example of which would be the [[Curie Institute, Warsaw|Skłodowska-Curie Institute of Oncology]], Poland's leading, and most highly specialised centre for the research and treatment of cancer.

The Polish health-care industry is currently undergoing a major transformation, with many hospitals being listed as top priorities for refurbishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Polish hospitals&quot;/&gt; As a result of this process, many hospitals have already been thoroughly modernised throughout and are now equipped with the latest in medical hardware. The overall quality of healthcare provision nationwide, as judged by European standards, is generally regarded as being very high.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Quality of Medical Treatment and Surgery in Poland&quot;/&gt; This is reflected in the nation's average life expectancy, which at 71 for males and 80 for females,&lt;ref name=&quot;who&quot;/&gt; has shown a marked increase from 63/68 in 2003, and now corresponds with the average figures for life expectancy in the European Union.

===Education===
{{main|Education in Poland}}
[[File:Collegium Maius 07.JPG|thumb|right|The ''[[Collegium Maius]]'' is the oldest building of the [[Jagiellonian University]] in [[Kraków]]]]
The education of Polish society was a goal of rulers as early as the 12th century, and Poland soon became one of the most educated countries in Europe. The library catalogue of the Cathedral Chapter of [[Kraków]] dating back to 1110 shows that in the early 12th century Polish intellectuals had access to European literature. The [[Jagiellonian University]], founded in 1364 by King [[Casimir III the Great|Casimir III]] in Kraków, is one of Europe's oldest universities. In 1773 King [[Stanisław August Poniatowski]] established the [[Commission of National Education]] (''Komisja Edukacji Narodowej''), the world's first state ministry of education.

[[File:Collegium Minus - UAM.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Adam Mickiewicz University]], [[Poznań]]]]
The first university in Poland, Kraków's Jagiellonian University, was established in 1364 by Casimir III the Great in Kraków. It is the oldest university in Poland. It is the second oldest university in Central Europe and one of the [[List of oldest universities in continuous operation|oldest universities in the world]]. Casimir III realized that the nation needed a class of educated people, especially lawyers, who could codify the country's laws and administer the courts and offices. His efforts to found an institution of higher learning in Poland were finally rewarded when [[Pope Urban V]] granted him permission to open the University of Krakow.

Since changes made in 2009 education in Poland starts at the age of five or six for the 0 class (Kindergarten) and six or seven years in the 1st class of [[primary school]] ([[Polish language|Polish]] ''szkoła podstawowa''). It is compulsory that children do one year of formal education before entering 1st class at no later than 7 years of age. 

[[File:Ryszard Kaczorowski 21 02 2008 (4).jpg|thumb|right|The wearing of traditional [[academic dress]] is an important feature of Polish educational ceremonies]]
At the end of 6th class when the students are 13, they take a compulsory exam that will determine to which lower secondary school (''gimnazjum, pronounced gheem-nah-sium'') (Middle School/Junior High) they will be accepted. They will attend this school for three years for classes, 7, 8, and 9. They then take another compulsory exam to determine the upper secondary level school they will attend. There are several alternatives, the most common being the three years in a ''liceum'' or four years in a [[technikum]]. Both end with a maturity examination ([[matura]], quite similar to French [[baccalauréat]]), and may be followed by several forms of upper education, leading to [[licencjat]] or inżynier (the Polish [[Bologna Process]] first cycle qualification), [[magister (degree)|magister]] (second cycle qualification) and eventually [[doktor]] (third cycle qualification).&lt;ref name=&quot;The impact of the 1999 education reform in Poland&quot;/&gt;

[[File:UniwersytetWrocławski.jpg|thumb|left|The [[University of Wrocław]] at night.]]	
There are currently 18 fully accredited traditional universities in Poland, these are then further supplemented by 20 technical universities, nine independent medical universities and five universities for the study of economics. In addition to these institutions there are then nine agricultural academies, three pedagogical universities, a theological academy and three maritime service universities. Poland's long history of promoting the arts has led to the establishment of a number of higher educational institutes dedicated to the teaching of the arts. Amongst these are the seven higher state academies of music. All of these institutions are further supplemented by a large number of private educational institutions and the four national military academies (two for the army and one for each of the other branches of service), bringing the total number of organisations for the pursuit of higher education to well over 500, one of the largest numbers in Europe. The [[Programme for International Student Assessment]], coordinated by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], currently ranks Poland's educational system as the 23rd best in the world, being neither significantly higher nor lower than the OECD average.&lt;ref name=&quot;Range of rank on PISA 2006 science scale&quot;/&gt;

==Culture==
{{main|Culture of Poland}}

The culture of Poland is closely connected with its intricate 1000 year [[History of Poland|history]]&lt;ref name=&quot;amazon&quot;/&gt; Its unique character developed as a result of its geography at the confluence of European cultures. With origins in the culture of the [[Proto-Slavs]], over time Polish culture has been profoundly influenced by its interweaving ties with the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], [[Latinate]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] worlds as well as in continual dialog with the many other ethnic groups and minorities living in Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;MFA&quot;/&gt; The people of Poland have traditionally been seen as hospitable to artists from abroad and eager to follow cultural and artistic trends popular in other countries. In the 19th and 20th centuries the Polish focus on cultural advancement often took precedence over political and economic activity. These factors have contributed to the versatile nature of Polish art, with all its complex nuances.&lt;ref name=&quot;MFA&quot; /&gt;

===Famous people===
[[File:Nikolaus Kopernikus.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mikołaj Kopernik]]&lt;br /&gt;([[Latin]]: ''Nicolaus Copernicus'')]]
Poland is the birthplace of many distinguished personalities (see. [[List of Polish people]]), among which are: [[Mikołaj Kopernik]],&lt;ref name=&quot;copernicus&quot;/&gt; [[Fryderyk Chopin]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Le petit Robert 2 : ( dictionnaire universel des noms propres, alphabétique et analogique )&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Concise Oxford dictionary of music&quot;/&gt; [[Maria Skłodowska Curie]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Maria Sklodowska. La jeunesse&quot;/&gt; [[Tadeusz Kościuszko]], [[Kazimierz Pułaski]], [[Józef Piłsudski]] and [[Pope John Paul II]]. Great Polish painter [[Jan Matejko]] devoted his monumental art to the most significant historical events on Polish lands, along with the playwright, painter and poet [[Stanisław Wyspiański]]. [[Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz|Stanisław Ignacy Witkiewicz (Witkacy)]] was an example of a Polish avant-garde philosopher and author of aesthetic theories.

[[Polish literature]] dates back to the 12th century&lt;ref name=&quot;LIT01&quot;/&gt; and includes many famous poets and writers such as [[Jan Kochanowski]], [[Adam Mickiewicz]], [[Bolesław Prus]], [[Juliusz Słowacki]], [[Witold Gombrowicz]], [[Stanisław Lem]] and, [[Ryszard Kapuściński]]. Writers [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]], [[Władysław Reymont]], [[Czesław Miłosz]], [[Wisława Szymborska]] have each won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]]. Also a renowned Polish novelist, who wrote in the [[English language]], was [[Joseph Conrad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Profiles – Joseph Conrad&quot;/&gt;

Many world famous [[Cinema of Poland|Polish movie directors]] include [[Academy Award]]s winners [[Roman Polanski|Roman Polański]], [[Andrzej Wajda]], [[Zbigniew Rybczyński]], [[Janusz Kamiński]], [[Krzysztof Kieślowski]], [[Agnieszka Holland]]. World renowned actresses were [[Helena Modjeska]] and [[Pola Negri]].

Poles have outstanding achievements in [[mountaineering]] in the [[Himalayas]], especially in the winter gathering [[Eight-thousander]]. The most famous Polish climbers are [[Jerzy Kukuczka]], [[Krzysztof Wielicki]], [[Piotr Pustelnik]], [[Andrzej Zawada]] and [[Wanda Rutkiewicz]].

===Society===
[[File:Grand Hotel Sopot.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Grand Hotel (Sopot)|Grand Hotel]] in [[Sopot]]. Poland's [[Baltic Sea]] resorts are very popular tourist destinations amongst Poles as well as foreign tourists]]
[[File:John Paul II Medal of Freedom 2004.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Pope John Paul II]] is considered to have been a great promoter of Poland around the world]]
Poland has a great, long standing tradition of tolerance towards minorities, as well as absence of discrimination on the grounds of religion, nationality or race. This is for historical reasons and that is ethnic minorities in Poland are very few. It has a high level of [[gender equality]], promotes [[disability rights movement]] and promotes equality. 
Poland is the first country in the world where [[corporal punishment]] was prohibited.&lt;ref name=&quot;coe&quot;/&gt;
Poland has, throughout most of its long history, experienced only very limited immigration from abroad; this trend can largely be attributed to Poland's lack of slavery and overseas colonies as well as its lack of existence as a state during much of the 19th and early 20th centuries. Despite this, the country has for a long time been regarded as having a very tolerant society, which affords equal rights to all people no matter what their ethnic background. This can be said to stem largely from the reign of King [[Casimir III the Great]] and his acceptance for Poland's [[Jewish community]], in a time when the most of Europe recessed [[antisemitic]] mood. The [[history of Jews in Poland]] shows peaceful co-existence of a nation and particular [[ethnic group]].

As many as 96.7% of Polish citizens declare to be [[Poles]], and 97.8% declare that they speak [[Polish language|Polish]] at home (Census 2002). The population of Poland became one of the most ethnically homogeneous in the world as a result of the radically altered borders after [[World War II]] and the subsequent migrations. This homogeneity is a result of post World War II deportations ordered by the Soviet authorities, who wished to remove the sizeable Polish minorities from Lithuania, Belarus and Ukraine and [[repatriation of Ukrainians from Poland to the Soviet Union]] (see [[territorial changes of Poland]] and [[historical demography of Poland]] for details). Unlike in many other countries, the [[minority rights]] in Poland are guaranteed directly in the [[Constitution of Poland]] (art. 35), and today there are, amongst others, sizeable [[German minority in Poland|German]], [[Ukrainian minority in Poland|Ukrainian]] and [[Belarusian minority in Poland|Belarusian]] minorities present in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;minelres&quot;/&gt;

[[Revolutions of 1989|After the formal collapse of Communism in 1989]], Poland greatly improved its image in the world and thus has received further support from the country's recent economic success and effective entry into the structures of the European Union. Polish citizens have obtained a good reputation as workers in the united Europe, mainly due to the broad range of jobs beyond the borders of their state, since 2004. The results of an [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] (OSCE) survey from 2004 showed that Poles work the second most hours per week of any nationality worldwide.

Poland remains one of the most peaceful countries in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;visionofhumanity&quot;/&gt;

===Music===
{{main|Music of Poland}}
[[File:Frederic Chopin photo.jpeg|upright|left|thumb|[[Frédéric Chopin|Fryderyk Chopin]], composer]]
Artists from Poland, including famous composers like [[Frédéric Chopin|Chopin]] or [[Krzysztof Penderecki|Penderecki]] and traditional, regionalized [[folk music]]ians, create a lively and diverse music scene, which even recognizes its own [[music genre]]s, such as [[poezja śpiewana]] and [[disco polo]]. As of 2006, Poland is one of the few countries in Europe where [[rock and roll|rock]] and [[hip hop music|hip hop]] dominate over [[pop music]], while all kinds of [[alternative music]] genres are encouraged.

The origins of Polish music can be traced as far back as the 13th century; manuscripts have been found in [[Stary Sącz]], containing [[polyphony|polyphonic]] compositions related to the Parisian [[Notre Dame School]]. Other early compositions, such as the melody of ''[[Bogurodzica]]'' and ''[[Bóg się rodzi]]'' (a coronation polonaise for Polish kings by an unknown composer), may also date back to this period, however, the first known notable composer, [[Mikołaj z Radomia]], was born and lived in the 15th century. During the 16th century, two main musical groups – both based in [[Kraków]] and belonging to the King and Archbishop of the Wawel – led to the rapid development of Polish music. Composers writing during this period include [[Wacław z Szamotuł]], [[Mikołaj Zieleński]], and [[Mikołaj Gomółka]]. [[Diomedes Cato]], a native-born Italian who lived in Kraków from about the age of five, became one of the most famous lutenists at the court of Sigismund III, and not only imported some of the musical styles from southern Europe, but blended them with native folk music.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Music Courts of the Polish Vasas&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Tomasz_Stanko-CP.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tomasz Stańko]] is a popular contemporary Polish jazz musician]]
At the end of the 18th century, Polish classical music evolved into national forms like the [[polonaise]]. In the 19th century the most popular composers were: [[Józef Elsner]] and his pupils [[Fryderyk Chopin]] and Ignacy Dobrzyński. Important opera composers of the era were [[Karol Kurpiński]] and [[Stanisław Moniuszko]] whilst the list of famous soloists and composers included [[Henryk Wieniawski]], [[Juliusz Zarębski]]. At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries the most promiment composers could said to have been [[Władysław Żeleński (musician)|Władysław Zeleński]] and [[Mieczysław Karłowicz]], with [[Karol Szymanowski]] gaining prominence prior to World War II. [[Alexandre Tansman]] lived in Paris but had strong connections with Poland. [[Henryk Górecki]] and [[Krzysztof Penderecki]] composed in Poland, [[Andrzej Panufnik]] emigrated.

Traditional Polish folk music has had a major effect on the works of many well-known Polish composers, and no more so than on Fryderyk Chopin, a widely recognised national hero of the arts. All of Chopin's [[List of compositions by Frédéric Chopin|works]] involve the piano and are technically demanding, emphasising nuance and expressive depth. As a great composer, Chopin invented the [[musical form]] known as the [[ballade (music)#Instrumental ballades|instrumental ballade]] and made major innovations to the [[piano sonata]], [[mazurka]], [[waltz]], [[nocturne]], [[polonaise]], [[étude]], [[impromptu]] and [[prelude (music)|prélude]], he was also the composer of a number of polonaises which borrowed heavily from traditional Polish folk music. It is largely thanks to him that the such pieces gained great popularity throughout Europe during the 19th century. Nowadays the most distinctive folk music can be heard in the towns and villages of the mountainous south, particularly in the region surrounding the winter resort town of [[Zakopane]].

Today Poland has a very active music scene, with the jazz and metal genres being particularly popular amongst the contemporary populace. Polish jazz musicians such as [[Krzysztof Komeda]], created a unique style, which was most famous in 1960s and 1970s and continues to be popular to this day. Since the fall of Communism, Poland has become a major venue for large-scale music festivals, chief among which are the [[Open'er Festival]], [[Opole Festival]] and [[Sopot Festival]].

===Media===
[[File:Moderne wolkenkrabber Warschau 0875.PNG|left|thumb|Headquarters of [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]] in Warsaw]]
Poland has instituted [[freedom of press]] since the fall of communism, a system under which the media was heavily politically controlled and censored. However, public TV and radio are still regulated by the government, this is exercised through an agency called ''[[Krajowa Rada Radiofonii i Telewizji]]'' (''The National Radio and Television Committee''), which is similar to television regulatory commissions in other developed nations.

Poland has a number of major media outlets, chief amongst which are the national television channels. [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]] is Poland's [[public broadcasting]] [[corporation]]; about a third of its income comes from a [[television licence|broadcast receiver licence]], while the rest is made through revenue from [[television advertisement|commercials]] and [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorships]]. State television operates two mainstream channels, TVP 1 and TVP 2, as well as regional programs ([[TVP Info]]) for each of the country's 16 [[voivodeship]]s. In addition to these general channels, TVP runs a number of genre-specific programmes such as [[TVP Sport]], [[TVP Historia]], [[TVP Kultura]] and [[TVP Seriale]]; there are currently plans to run channels dedicated to the coverage of political affairs (TVP Parlament) and entertainment (TVP Rozrywka).

[[File:Fakty TVP-studio Wroclaw 2008.jpg|right|thumb|Studio set of [[Telewizja Polska|TVP]] [[Wrocław]]'s 'Fakty' news program]]
Poland has a number of internationally broadcast and 24 hour news channels, chief amongst which are [[Polsat News]], [[TVN 24]], and [[TV Polonia]], the latter is a state-run channel dedicated to the transmission of Polish language television for the [[Polish diaspora]] abroad. There are a number of major private television outlets such as [[Polsat]] and the [[TVN (Poland)|TVN network]].

Poland has a highly developed printed news industry, with daily newspapers like [[Gazeta Wyborcza]] ''(The Electoral Gazette)'', [[Rzeczpospolita (newspaper)|Rzeczpospolita]] ''(The Republic)'' and [[Gazeta Polska Codziennie]] providing more traditional, intellectually stimulating reporting and tabloids such as [[Fakt]] providing more sensationalist writing which is less current affairs orientated. Rzeczpospolita is one of the nation's oldest publications still in operation today, founded in 1920, it has become a stalwart bastion of Polish reporting and in 2006 won a prestigious award for being, along with the [[Guardian (newspaper)|Guardian]] (a British daily), the best designed newspaper in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian wins design award&quot;/&gt; 

Major media outlets are experiencing an ongoing restructuring which is seeing many of them amalgamated into major media groups; a prime example of which is the German [[Axel Springer AG]] Publishing conglomerate's purchase of Fakt. International cooperation is also a growing trend within Polish media; TVP recently began cooperating with the French-German TV network [[ARTE]].

===Literature===
{{Main|Polish literature}}

Polish literature has a long and complicated history. During the Middle Ages most Polish authors and academics ([[Jan Długosz]]) wrote only in Latin, as at the time, this was the 'academic' language which linked Europe together; [[Jan Kochanowski]] broke this trend and became the first author to write the majority of his works in the Polish language. A number of Polish authors have won great renown in the past few centuries, however, this largely stems from the initial success of the works of [[Adam Mickiewicz]], who wrote the first Polish epic, [[Pan Tadeusz]], in 1834.
Influential authors of the late 19th and 20th centuries include [[Henryk Sienkiewicz]], [[Władysław Reymont]], [[Witold Gombrowicz]] and [[Czesław Miłosz]]. To date four Polish authors have won the [[Nobel Prize in Literature]], with Władysław Reymont being one of only nine writers to receive the prestigious award for one particular, outstanding literary work ''(awarded for the great national epic, '[[The Peasants]]' in 1924)'' rather than their career as a whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;Facts on the Nobel Prize in Literature&quot;/&gt; [[Ferdynand Antoni Ossendowski]] was an internationally popular writer.

&lt;/center&gt;

With regard to poetry, Poland has a long and distinguished history of producing world-class poets. Chief among these are the 'three bards' (trzej wieszcze), [[Adam Mickiewicz|Mickiewicz]], [[Zygmunt Krasiński|Krasiński]] and [[Juliusz Słowacki|Słowacki]]; the three [[national poets]] of [[Polish Romanticism|Polish Romantic literature]]. Incidentally, the Polish word ''Wieszcz'' means '[[prophet]]' or '[[Fortune-telling|soothsayer]]', a fitting reference for the three, as the bards were thought to not only voice Polish national sentiments but to frequently foresee the nation's future.

Today the traditions of Polish literature and poetry are being carried forward by a new generation of writers. Included within this group is [[Wisława Szymborska]], a best-selling author and recipient of the 1996 Nobel Prize in Literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;Szymborska's 'View': Small Truths Sharply Etched&quot;/&gt;

{{further2|[[:Category:Polish architecture]]}}
[[File:Ratusz2007.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Renaissance City Hall in [[Poznań]]]]

Polish cities and towns reflect the whole spectrum of European styles. [[Romanesque architecture]] is represented by [[St. Andrew]]'s Church in Kraków, and characteristic for Poland [[Brick Gothic]] by [[St. Mary's Church, Gdańsk|St. Mary's Church]] in Gdańsk. Richly decorated [[attic style|attics]] and [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]] [[loggia]]s are the common elements of the Polish Renaissance architecture,&lt;ref name=&quot;szydlowiec&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RENAISSANCE CULTURAL BACKGROUND&quot;/&gt; like in [[Poznań City Hall|City Hall]] in Poznań. For some time the late renaissance, so called [[mannerism]], most notably in [[Cracow Bishops' Palace in Kielce|Bishop’s Palace]] in [[Kielce]], coexisted with the early baroque like in Church of SS. Peter and Paul in Kraków.

[[File:Kościół parafialny p.w. Wniebowzięcia NMP (Mariacki), Kraków, Rynek Główny, A-3 01.jpg|thumb|left|180px|The Gothic [[St. Mary's Basilica, Kraków|St. Mary's Basilica]] on the [[Main Market Square, Kraków|Main Market Square]] in [[Kraków]]]]
History has not been kind to Poland's architectural monuments. Nonetheless, a number of ancient structures had survived: castles, churches, and stately buildings, often unique in the regional or European context. Some of them have been painstakingly restored, like [[Wawel Castle]], or completely reconstructed after being destroyed in the [[Second World War]], including the [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]] and [[Royal Castle in Warsaw]] and the Old Town of [[Gdańsk]]. The architecture of Gdańsk is mostly of the Hanseatic variety, a Gothic style common amongst the former trading cities along the Baltic sea and in the northern part of Central Europe. The architectural style of [[Wrocław]] is mainly representative of German architecture, since it was for centuries located within the German states. The centre of [[Kazimierz Dolny]] on the [[Vistula]] is a good example of a well-preserved medieval town. Poland's ancient capital, [[Kraków]], ranks among the best-preserved [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] and Renaissance urban complexes in Europe. Meanwhile, the legacy of the [[Kresy]] Marchlands of Poland's eastern regions, where Wilno and Lwów (now ''Vilnius'' and ''Lviv'') were recognised as two major centres for the arts, played a special role in the development of Polish architecture, with [[Catholic]] church architecture deserving special note.&lt;ref name=&quot;MFA&quot; /&gt;

The second half of the 17th century is marked by [[baroque]] architecture. Side towers, visible in [[Branicki Palace, Białystok|Branicki Palace]] in Białystok are typical for Polish baroque.

Polish cuisine has influenced the cuisines of its surrounding countries. For centuries the Polish kitchen has been the arena for competing with France and Italy. It is rich in meat, especially pork, chicken and beef, winter vegetables (cabbage in the dish [[bigos]]) and spices. Pasta is also featured in many Polish dishes, most notably are [[pierogi]]. Polish national cuisine shares some similarities with other European traditions. Generally speaking, Polish cuisine is hearty. The preparation of traditional cuisine generally is time intensive and Poles allow themselves a generous amount of time to prepare and enjoy their festive meals, with some meals (like [[Wigilia|Christmas Eve]] or [[Święconka|Easter breakfast]]) taking a number of days to prepare in their entirety. It is worth noting that most regions of Poland have their own local gastronomic traditions and distinctive flavours.&lt;ref name=&quot;kuchnia&quot;/&gt;

Notable foods in Polish cuisine include: soups – [[rosół]], [[barszcz]], [[Sour rye soup|żurek]], [[Krupnik (soup)|krupnik]], [[kapuśniak]], [[Tomato soup|zupa pomidorowa]], [[zupa ogórkowa]], [[zupa grzybowa]], [[flaczki]] (tripe soup); [[pierogi]], [[kiełbasa]], [[gołąbki]], [[oscypek]], [[kotlet schabowy]], [[Meatball|kotlet mielony]], [[bigos]], various potato dishes, [[Sandwich|kanapka]], [[zapiekanka]], and many more. Traditional Polish desserts include [[pączki]], [[Angel wings|faworki]], [[gingerbread]], [[Babka (cake)|babka]] and others.

Characteristic dishes are [[soured milk]], [[buttermilk]], [[kefir]], [[gherkin]], [[pickled cucumber]], [[sauerkraut]].

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
'''a''' {{Note label|a|a|none}} Numerous sources state that Polish Army was the Allies' fourth biggest fighting contingent. [[Steven J. Zaloga]] and [[Richard Hook]] write that &quot;by the war's end the Polish Army was the fourth largest contingent of the Allied coalition after the armed forces of the Soviet Union, the United States and the United Kingdom.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ZalogaHook1982&quot;/&gt; [[Jerzy Jan Lerski]] writes &quot;All in all, the Polish units, although divided and controlled by different political orientation, constituted the fourth largest Allied force, after the America, British and Soviet Armies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lerski1996&quot;/&gt; [[M. K. Dziewanowski]] has noted that &quot;if Polish forces fighting in the east and west were added to the resistance fighters, Poland had the fourth largest Allied army in the war (after the USSR, the U.S. and Britain)&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walters1988&quot;/&gt;

The claim of the fourth biggest Ally needs to be reconsidered, however. Throughout the war, Poland's position varied from the 2nd biggest Ally (after the [[fall of France]], when Polish army outnumbered the French) to perhaps the 5th at the end of it (after the USA, Soviet Union, China and Britain). Please, see the analysis in [[Polish contribution to World War II]].

'''b''' {{Note label|b|b|none}} Sources vary with regards to what was the largest resistance movement during World War II. The confusion often stems from the fact that as war progressed, some resistance movements grew larger – and other diminished. Polish territories were mostly freed from Nazi German control in the years 1944–1945, eliminating the need for their respective (anti-Nazi) partisan forces (in Poland (although the [[cursed soldiers]] continued to fight against the Soviets). Several sources note that Polish [[Armia Krajowa]] was the largest resistance movement in Nazi-occupied Europe. [[Norman Davies]] wrote: &quot;Armia Krajowa (Home Army), the AK, which could fairly claim to be the largest of European resistance&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;google12&quot;/&gt; [[Gregor Dallas]] wrote &quot;Home Army (Armia Krajowa or AK) in late 1943 numbered around 400000, making it the largest resistance organization in Europe&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;google13&quot;/&gt; [[Mark Wyman]] wrote &quot;Armia Krajowa was considered the largest underground resistance unit in wartime Europe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;google14&quot;/&gt; Certainly, Polish resistance was the largest resistance till German [[invasion of Yugoslavia]] and [[invasion of the Soviet Union]] in 1941. After that point, the numbers of [[Soviet partisans]] and [[Yugoslav partisans]] begun growing rapidly. The numbers of [[Soviet partisans]] quickly caught up and were very similar to that of the Polish resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;historiographical&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vukšić2003&quot;/&gt; The numbers of Tito's [[Yugoslav partisans]] were roughly similar to those of the Polish and Soviet partisans in the first years of the war (1941–1942), but grew rapidly in the latter years, outnumbering the Polish and Soviet partisans by 2:1 or more (estimates give Yugoslavian forces about 800,000 in 1945, to Polish and Soviet forces of 400,000 in 1944).&lt;ref name=&quot;Vukšić2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Velimir Vukšić|title=Tito's partisans 1941–45|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=SLix5hc4WRgC&amp;pg=PA11|accessdate=1 March 2011|date=23 July 2003|publisher=Osprey Publishing|isbn=978-1-84176-675-1|pages=11–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ac&quot;/&gt;
