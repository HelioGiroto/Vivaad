The '''Philippines''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-Philippines.ogg|ˈ|f|ɪ|l|ɨ|p|iː|n|z}} {{Respell|FI|lə-peenz}} ({{lang-fil|Pilipinas|}} {{IPA-tl|ˌpɪlɪˈpinɐs|}}), officially known as the '''Republic of the Philippines''' ({{lang-fil|Republika ng Pilipinas|}}), is a [[sovereign state]] in [[Southeast Asia]] in the western Pacific Ocean. To its north across the [[Luzon Strait]] lies [[Taiwan]]. West across the [[South China Sea]] sits [[Vietnam]]. The [[Sulu Sea]] to the southwest lies between the country and the island of [[Borneo]], and to the south the [[Celebes Sea]] separates it from other islands of [[Indonesia]]. It is bounded on the east by the [[Philippine Sea]]. Its location on the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]] and its tropical climate make the Philippines prone to earthquakes and typhoons but have also endowed the country with natural resources and made it one of the richest areas of biodiversity in the world. An archipelago comprising 7,107 islands, the Philippines is categorized broadly into three main geographical divisions: [[Luzon]], [[Visayas]], and [[Mindanao]]. Its capital city is [[Manila]].

With a population of more than 92 million&lt;ref name=&quot;2010 census&quot;/&gt; people, the Philippines is the [[List of Asian countries by population|7th most populated Asian country]] and the [[List of countries by population|12th most populated country in the world]]. An additional 12&amp;nbsp;million [[overseas Filipino|Filipinos live overseas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philstar.com/Article.aspx?articleId=801091&amp;publicationSubCategoryId=63 Global Pinoys to rally at Chinese consulates – The Philippine Star » News » Headlines]. Philstar.com (2012-04-27). Retrieved on 2012-07-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple [[Ethnic groups in the Philippines|ethnicities]] and cultures are found throughout the islands. In prehistoric times, [[Negrito]]s were some of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants. They were followed by [[Models of migration to the Philippines|successive waves]] of [[Austronesian peoples]] who brought with them influences from [[Malay people|Malay]], [[Hindu]], and [[Islamic]] societies. Trade and subsequent Chinese settlement eventually introduced [[Chinese culture|Chinese cultural]] influences which remain to this day.

The arrival of [[Ferdinand Magellan]] in 1521 marked the beginning of an era of [[Spain|Spanish]] interest and eventual colonization. In 1543, Spanish explorer [[Ruy López de Villalobos]] named the archipelago ''Las Islas Filipinas'' in honor of Philip II of Spain. [[Miguel López de Legazpi]] arrived in the Philippines in 1565 and consolidated Spanish rule in the islands, which remained a [[colony]] of Spain for more than 300 years.

Manila became the Asian hub of the [[Manila galleon|Manila–Acapulco galleon]] [[Spanish treasure fleet|fleet]]. As the 19th&amp;nbsp;century gave way to the 20th, there followed in quick succession the [[Philippine Revolution]], which spawned the short-lived [[First Philippine Republic]]; the [[Spanish-American War]]; and the [[Philippine–American War]]. In the aftermath, the [[United States]] emerged as the dominant power; aside from the period of [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines|Japanese occupation]], the United States retained sovereignty over the islands until the end of [[World War II]] when the Philippines gained [[Treaty of Manila (1946)|independence]]. Since then, the Philippines has had an often tumultuous experience with [[democracy]], with popular &quot;[[people power]]&quot; movements overthrowing [[History of the Philippines (1965–1986)#Martial Law (1972–1981)|a dictatorship]] in one instance but also underlining the institutional weaknesses of its [[constitutional republic]] in [[EDSA II#Criticism|others]].

==Etymology==
&lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{Main|Name of the Philippines}}

The name ''Philippines'' is derived from that of [[Philip II of Spain|King Philip&amp;nbsp;II of Spain]]. Spanish explorer [[Ruy López de Villalobos]] during his expedition in 1542 named the islands of [[Leyte]] and [[Samar]] ''Felipinas'' after the then [[Prince of Asturias]]. Eventually the name ''Las Islas Filipinas'' would be used to cover all the islands of the archipelago. Before that became commonplace, other names such as ''Islas del Poniente'' (Islands of the West) and Magellan's name for the islands ''San Lázaro'' were also used by the Spanish to refer to the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=15KZU-yMuisC|title=Barangay: Sixteenth-century Philippine Culture and Society|author=Scott, William Henry.|authorlink=William Henry Scott (historian)|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press

The official name of the Philippines has changed several times in the course of the country's history. During the [[Philippine Revolution]], the [[Malolos Congress]] proclaimed the establishment of the ''República Filipina'' or the ''[[First Philippine Republic|Philippine Republic]]''. From the period of the [[Spanish-American War]] and the [[Philippine–American War]] until the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|Commonwealth]] period, American colonial authorities referred to the country as the ''Philippine Islands'', a translation of the Spanish name. During the American period, the name ''Philippines'' began to appear and it has since become the country's common name.&lt;ref name =PhilIs&gt;[[Manuel Quezon III|Quezon, Manuel, III]]. (2005-03-28).

Retrieved 2009-12-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Since independence, the official name of the country has been the ''Republic of the Philippines''.

Trade between the maritime-oriented peoples and other Asian countries during the subsequent period brought influences from [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], and [[Islam]]. During this time there was no unifying political state encompassing the entire Philippine Archipelago. Instead, the islands were divided among competing [[Thalassocracy|thalassocracies]] ruled by various [[datu]]s, [[rajah]]s, or [[sultan]]s.

Spanish rule contributed significantly to bringing political unity to the archipelago. From 1565 to 1821, the Philippines was governed as a territory of the [[Viceroyalty of New Spain]] and then was administered directly from [[Madrid]] after the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. The [[Manila galleons]] linking Manila to [[Acapulco]] traveled once or twice a year between the 16th and 19th&amp;nbsp;centuries. Trade introduced foods such as [[maize|corn]], [[tomatoes]], [[potatoes]], [[chili peppers]], and [[pineapples]] from the Americas.&lt;ref name=&quot;JoaquinPhilBecoming&quot; /&gt; [[Roman Catholic]] missionaries converted most of the lowland inhabitants to [[Christianity]] and founded schools, a university, and hospitals.

In the 19th century, Philippine ports were opened to world trade and shifts were occurring within Philippine society. Many Spaniards born in the Philippines (''[[Criollo people|criollos]]'') and those of mixed ancestry (''[[mestizos]]'') became wealthy. The influx of Spanish and Latino settlers secularized churches and opened up government positions traditionally held by Spaniards born in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (''[[peninsulares]]''). The ideals of revolution also began to spread through the islands. ''Criollo'' dissatisfaction resulted in the [[Cavite Mutiny|revolt in Cavite El Viejo]] in 1872 that was a precursor to the Philippine Revolution.&lt;ref name=Agoncillo/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cavite Mutiny&quot;&gt;Nuguid, Nati.

Immediately after World War II, the Philippines faced a number of challenges. The country had to be rebuilt from the ravages of war. It also had to come to terms with Japanese collaborators. Meanwhile, disgruntled remnants of the [[Hukbalahap]] communist rebel army that had previously fought against and resisted the Japanese continued to roam the rural [[Regions of the Philippines|regions]]. This threat to the government was dealt with by Secretary of National Defense and later President [[Ramon Magsaysay]], but sporadic cases of communist insurgency continued to flare up long afterward.&lt;ref name=Chandler&gt;{{cite book

On August 21, 1983, Marcos' chief rival opposition leader [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Benigno &quot;Ninoy&quot; Aquino, Jr.]] ignored warnings and returned from exile in the United States. He was assassinated as he was taken off the plane at the Manila International Airport (now called the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]] in his memory). With political pressure building, Marcos eventually called for [[Philippine presidential election, 1986|snap presidential elections in 1986]].&lt;ref name=Chandler/&gt; [[Corazon Aquino]], Benigno's widow, was persuaded to become the presidential candidate and standard bearer of the opposition.

Relations with other nations are generally positive. Shared democratic values ease relations with Western and European countries while similar economic concerns help in relations with other developing countries. Historical ties and cultural similarities also serve as a bridge in relations with Spain and [[Latin America]]. Despite issues such as [[domestic abuse]] and war affecting overseas Filipino workers and obstacles posed by Islamic insurgency in Mindanao, relations with [[Middle East]]ern countries (including [[Egypt]], [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Libya]], [[Saudi Arabia]], and the [[United Arab Emirates]]) are friendly as seen in the continuous employment of more than two million overseas Filipinos living there.

With communism no longer the threat it once was, once hostile relations in the 1950s between the Philippines and the [[People's Republic of China]] have improved greatly. Issues involving Taiwan, the Spratly Islands, and concerns of expanding Chinese influence, however, still encourage a degree of carefulness.&lt;ref name=neighbors/&gt; Recent foreign policy has been mostly about economic relations with its Southeast Asian and Asia-Pacific neighbors.&lt;ref name = &quot;PhilState&quot; /&gt;

The island of [[Borneo]] is located a few hundred kilometers southwest and Taiwan is located directly to the north. The [[Moluccas]] and [[Sulawesi]] are located to the south-southwest and [[Palau]] is located to the east of the islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071022221129/http://www.gov.ph/aboutphil/general.asp General Information].

It measures up to 2,954&amp;nbsp;meters (9,692&amp;nbsp;feet) above sea level and is located on the island of Mindanao. The Galathea Depth in the [[Philippine Trench]] is the deepest point in the country and the [[List of submarine topographical features#List of oceanic trenches|third deepest in the world]]. The trench is located in the Philippine Sea. The longest river is the [[Cagayan River]] in northern Luzon. [[Manila Bay]], upon the shore of which the capital city of Manila lies, is connected to [[Laguna de Bay]], the largest lake in the Philippines, by the [[Pasig River]]. [[Subic Bay]], the [[Davao Gulf]], and the [[Moro Gulf]] are other important bays.

{{Main|Climate of the Philippines}}
The Philippines has a tropical maritime [[climate]] and is usually hot and humid. There are three seasons: ''tag-init'' or ''tag-araw'', the hot dry season or summer from March to May; ''tag-ulan'', the rainy season from June to November; and ''tag-lamig'', the cool dry season from December to February. The southwest [[monsoon]] (from May to October) is known as the Habagat, and the dry winds of the northeast monsoon (from November to April), the Amihan.&lt;ref name=climate/&gt; Temperatures usually range from 21°C (70°F) to 32°C (90°F) although it can get cooler or hotter depending on the season. The coolest month is January; the warmest is May.&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Lonely Planet]]. (n.d.).

One of the most visible Hispanic legacies is the prevalence of [[Catálogo Alfabético de Apellidos|Spanish names and surnames]] among Filipinos.

{{Main|Philippine cuisine}}
[[File:Halo halo1.jpg|thumb|The [[halo-halo]] is a dessert made of ice, milk, various fruits, and ice cream.]]

Philippine cuisine has evolved over several centuries from its [[Malayo-Polynesian]] origins to become a mixed cuisine with many [[Hispanic]], [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]], [[Cuisine of the United States|American]], and other [[Asian cuisine|Asian]] influences that have been adapted to local ingredients and the Filipino palate to create distinctively Filipino dishes. Dishes range from the very simple, like a meal of fried salted fish and rice, to the elaborate, such as the ''[[paella]]s'' and ''[[cozido|cocidos]]'' created for fiestas. Popular dishes include ''[[lechon|lechón]]'', ''[[Adobo (Filipino cuisine)|adobo]]'', ''[[sinigang]]'', ''[[kare-kare]]'', ''[[Tapa (Filipino cuisine)|tapa]]'', crispy ''pata'', ''[[pancit]]'', ''[[lumpia]]'', and ''[[halo-halo]]''. Some common local ingredients used in cooking are [[calamondin]]s, coconuts, ''[[Saba banana|saba]]'' (a kind of short wide [[plantain]]), [[mangoes]], [[milkfish]], and [[fish sauce]]. Filipino taste buds tend to favor robust flavors but the cuisine is not as spicy as those of its neighbors.&lt;ref name=Jollibee2/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zialcita&gt;

Unlike many of their Asian counterparts, Filipinos do not eat with chopsticks; they use Western cutlery. However, possibly due to rice being the primary staple food and the popularity of a large number of stews and main dishes with broth in Philippine cuisine, the main pairing of utensils seen at the Filipino dining table is that of spoon and fork, not knife and fork.&lt;ref name=&quot;lonelyplanet48&quot;&gt;

Philippine mythology has been handed down primarily through the traditional oral folk literature of the Filipino people. While each unique ethnic group has its own stories and myths to tell, Hindu and Spanish influences can nonetheless be detected in many cases. Many of the [[Philippine mythical creatures]] are creation stories or stories about supernatural creatures, such as the ''[[aswang]]'', the ''[[manananggal]]'', the ''[[diwata]]/[[engkanto]]'', and nature. Some popular figures from Philippine mythologies are [[Maria Makiling]], [[Biag ni Lam-Ang|Lam-Ang]], and the [[Sarimanok]].&lt;ref name=Lopez&gt;{{Cite book

Philippine literature comprises works usually written in Filipino, Spanish, or English. Some of the most known were created in the 19th&amp;nbsp;century. [[Francisco Balagtas]] the poet and playwright who wrote ''[[Florante at Laura]]'' is recognized as a preeminent writer in the Filipino language. [[José Rizal]] wrote the novels ''[[Noli Me Tangere (novel)|Noli Me Tangere]]'' (''Touch Me Not'') and ''[[El Filibusterismo]]'' (''The Filibustering'', also known as ''The Reign of Greed'') and is considered a national hero. His depiction of the injustices of Spanish rule, and his death by firing squad, inspired other Philippine revolutionaries to seek independence. In the 20th&amp;nbsp;century, among those officially recognized as [[National Artists of the Philippines]] in literature are [[N.V.M. Gonzalez]], [[Nick Joaquin]], [[F. Sionil Jose]], and [[Alejandro Roces]].&lt;ref name=Artists&gt;Republic of the Philippines. National Commission for Culture and the Arts.
