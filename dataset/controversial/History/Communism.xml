'''Communism''' (from [[Latin]] ''communis'' - common, universal) is a [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] movement to create a [[Classless society|classless]], moneyless, and [[stateless society|stateless]] [[social order]] [[Base and superstructure|structured]] upon [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]], as well as a [[social]], [[political]] and [[economy|economic]] ideology that aims at the establishment of this social order.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, Socialism: Utopian or Scientific by Friedrich Engels, chapter III, paragraph III: &quot;The proletariat seizes the public power, and by means of this transforms the socialized means of production, slipping from the hands of the bourgeoisie, into public property. By this act, the proletariat frees the means of production from the character of capital they have thus far borne, and gives their socialized character complete freedom to work itself out. Socialized production upon a predetermined plan becomes henceforth possible. The development of production makes the existence of different classes of society thenceforth an anachronism. In proportion as anarchy in social production vanishes, the political authority of the State dies out. Man, at last the master of his own form of social organization, becomes at the same time the lord over Nature, his own master — free.&quot; or the [[ABC of Communism]]: &quot;In a communist society there will be no classes. But if there will be no classes, this implies that in communist society there will likewise be no State.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;   This movement, in its [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]] interpretations, significantly influenced the history of the 20th century, which saw intense rivalry between the &quot;socialist world&quot; ([[socialist state]]s ruled by [[Communist party|communist parties]]) and the &quot;western world&quot; (countries with [[Capitalist economy|capitalist economies]]).

[[Marxism|Marxist theory]] holds that pure communism or full communism is a specific stage of historical development that inevitably emerges from the development of the [[productive forces]] that leads to a superabundance of material wealth, allowing for [[From each according to his ability, to each according to his need|distribution based on need]] and social relations based on [[Free association (communism and anarchism)|freely associated individuals]].&lt;ref&gt;''Critique of the Gotha Programme'', Karl Marx.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Full Communism: The Ultimate Goal'': http://www.economictheories.org/2009/05/full-communism-ultimate-goal.html {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/60XSuRhmT|date =2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exact definition of communism varies, and it is often mistakenly, in general political discourse, used interchangeably with [[socialism]]; however, Marxist theory contends that socialism is just a transitional stage on the road to communism. [[Leninism]] adds to Marxism the notion of a [[vanguard party]] to lead the proletarian revolution and to secure all political power after the revolution for the working class, for the development of universal [[class consciousness]] and [[participatory democracy|worker participation]], in a transitional stage between [[capitalism]] and socialism.

[[Council communist]]s and non-Marxist [[libertarian communist]]s and [[anarcho-communist]]s oppose the ideas of a vanguard party and a transition stage, and advocate for the construction of full communism to begin immediately upon the abolition of capitalism. There is a very wide range of theories amongst those particular communists in regards to how to build the types of institutions that would replace the various economic engines (such as food distribution, education, and hospitals) as they exist under capitalist systems—or even whether to do so at all. Some of these communists have specific plans for the types of administrative bodies that would replace the current ones, while always qualifying that these bodies would be [[decentralisation|decentralised]] and [[employee ownership|worker-owned]], just as they currently are within the activist movements themselves. Others have no concrete set of post-revolutionary blueprints at all, claiming instead that they simply trust that the world's workers and poor will figure out proper modes of distribution and wide-scale production, and also coordination, entirely on their own, without the need for any structured &quot;replacements&quot; for capitalist [[nation-state|state-based]] control.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

In the modern lexicon of what many sociologists and political commentators refer to as the &quot;political mainstream&quot;, communism is often used to refer to the policies of communist states, i.e., the ones totally controlled by [[communist party|communist parties]], regardless of the practical content of the actual [[economic system]] they may preside over. Examples of this include the policies of the [[Socialist Republic of Vietnam]] where the economic system incorporates &quot;[[doi moi]]&quot;, the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) where the economic system incorporates &quot;[[socialist market economy]]&quot;, and the economic system of the Soviet Union which was described as &quot;[[state capitalist]]&quot; by non-Leninist socialists and later by communists who increasingly opposed the post-Stalin era Soviet model as it progressed over the course of the 20th century (e.g., [[Maoist]]s, [[Trotskyist]]s and [[libertarian communist]]s)—and even at one point by [[Vladimir Lenin]] himself.&lt;ref&gt;Lenin's [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/cw/volume27.htm Collected Works Vol. 27], p. 293, quoted by [http://www.geocities.com/aufheben2/auf_6_ussr1.html Aufheben]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}  {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5knCuc4J3|date =2009-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology and terminology==
''Communism'' comes from the Latin word ''communis'', which means &quot;shared&quot; or &quot;belong to all&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title=Communism|encyclopedia=Britannica Encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/129104/communism}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''World Book'' 2008, p. 890.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the schema of [[historical materialism]], communism is the idea of a free society with no division or alienation, where the people are free from oppression and scarcity. A communist society would have no governments, countries, or class divisions. In [[Marxist philosophy|Marxist theory]], the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] is the intermediate system between [[capitalism]] and communism, when the government is in the process of changing the means of ownership from [[privatism]] to collective ownership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Critique of the Gotha Programme—IV |work=Critique of the Gotha Programme |url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1875/gotha/ch04.htm |accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[political science]], the term &quot;communism&quot; is sometimes used to refer to [[communist state]]s, a [[form of government]] in which the [[State (polity)|state]] operates under a [[single-party state|one-party system]] and declares allegiance to [[Marxism-Leninism]] or a derivative thereof.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

[[File:Hammer and Sickle Red Star with Glow.png|thumb|125px|left|The [[hammer and sickle]] and the [[red star]] are universal [[symbols of communism]].]]

In modern usage, the word &quot;communism&quot; is still often used to refer to the policies of self-declared socialist governments comprising [[one-party state]]s which were single legal political party systems operating under [[Planned economy|centrally planned economies]] and a state ownership of the [[means of production]], with the state, in turn, claiming that it represented the interests of the [[working class]]es. A significant sector of the modern communist movement alleges that these states never made an attempt to transition to a communist society, while others even argue that they never achieved a legitimate socialism. Most of these governments based their ideology on [[Marxism-Leninism]], but they did not call the system they had set up &quot;communism&quot;, nor did they even necessarily claim at all times that the ideology was the sole driving force behind their policies: [[Mao Zedong]], for example, pursued [[New Democracy]], and [[Vladimir Lenin]] in the early 1920s enacted [[war communism]]; later, the Vietnamese enacted [[doi moi]], and the Chinese switched to [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]]. The governments labeled by other governments as &quot;communist&quot; generally claimed that they had set up a ''transitional socialist'' system. This system is sometimes referred to as [[state socialism]] or by other similar names.

&quot;[[Pure communism]]&quot; is a term sometimes used to refer to the stage in history after socialism, although just as many communists use simply the term &quot;communism&quot; to refer to that stage; the term is synonymous with &quot;[[Full communism]]&quot;. The classless, stateless society that is meant to characterise this communism is one where decisions on what to produce and what policies to pursue are made in the best interests of the whole of society—a sort of 'of, by, and for the working class', rather than a rich class controlling the wealth and everyone else working for them on a wage basis. In this communism the interests of every member of society is given equal weight to the next, in the practical decision-making process in both the political and economic spheres of life. [[Karl Marx]], as well as some other communist philosophers, deliberately never provided a detailed description as to how communism would function as a social system, nor the precise ways in which the working class could or should rise up, nor any other material specifics of exactly how to get to communism from capitalism. In the ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'', Marx does lay out a 10-point plan advising the redistribution of land and production to begin the transition to communism, but he ensured that even this was very general and all-encompassing. It has always been presumed that Marx intended these theories to read this way specifically so that later theorists in specific situations could adapt communism to their own localities and conditions.

==Theory==
According to communist theory, the only way to abolish capitalist inequalities is to have the proletariat (working class), who collectively constitute the main producer of wealth in society, and who are perpetually exploited and marginalised by the [[bourgeoisie]] (wealthy class), to overthrow the capitalist system in a wide-ranging [[social revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lansford|2007|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revolution, in the theory of most individuals and groups espousing [[communist revolution]], usually involves an armed rebellion. The revolution espoused can be explained by theorists in many different ways, and usually depends on the environment in which the particular communism theory originates. For example, the [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] involved military combat between the [[Chinese Red Army|Chinese Red]] and the [[National Revolutionary Army|Chinese Nationalist Armies]], while the [[August Revolution|Vietnamese Revolution]] was characterised by [[guerrilla warfare]] between the heavily backed [[Vietnam People's Army]] and various Western armies, culminating in the [[Vietnam War]] which ended in 1975. Meanwhile, the [[Cuban Revolution]] was essentially a [[coup d'état|coup]] that did not involve intensive wide-scale military conflict between [[Fulgencio Batista]]'s soldiers and those of [[Fidel Castro]] and [[Che Guevara]]. In fact, Castro initially did not believe that a [[vanguard party]] was necessary in Cuba's case, a view boosted by Batista's unpopularity at the time of the actual armed conflict between the two sides. Regardless of the specific form a communist revolution takes, its aim is for the working class to replace the exploiter class as the ruling class to establish a society without class divisions, called socialism, as a prelude to attempting to achieve the final stage of communism.&lt;ref name=&quot;columbia&quot;&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/communism.aspx|title=Communism|encyclopedia = Columbia Encyclopedia| year = 2008|accessdate = 29 November 2009| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/60XStZz4L | archivedate = 2011-07-29| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Communism.svg|thumb|400px|Countries of the world now (red) or previously (orange) officially structured as [[socialist state]]s under communist (Marxist-Leninist) governments, often called [[communist state|&quot;communist states&quot;]] in the [[Western world|West]]. The exact label &quot;Communist&quot; is debatable, as many analysts say countries like [[The People's Republic of China]] have moved into [[state capitalism]] and can no longer be described under Marx's definition of a Communist state.]]
{{Main|History of communism}}
According to Karl Marx:

{{quote
|text= &quot;Communism differs from all previous movements in that it overturns the basis of all earlier relations of production and intercourse, and for the first time consciously treats all natural premises as the creatures of hitherto existing men, strips them of their natural character and subjugates them to the power of the united individuals.&quot;|sign= &amp;nbsp;[[Karl Marx]], ''[[The German Ideology]]'', 1845&lt;ref&gt;''[[The German Ideology]]'', Volume 1 of German Ideology &amp; Selections from Pts 2 &amp; 3, by [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Engels]], and Christopher John Arthur, International Publishers Co, 1970, ISBN 978-0-7178-0302-6, pg 86&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Early Communism===
{{Further|Primitive communism|Religious communism|Utopian socialism}}

The origins of communism are debatable, and there are various historical groups, as well as theorists, whose beliefs have been subsequently described as communist. [[List of German-language philosophers|German philosopher]] Karl Marx saw primitive communism as the original, [[hunter-gatherer]] state of humankind from which it arose. For Marx, only after humanity was capable of producing [[Economic surplus|surplus]], did private property develop. The idea of a classless society first emerged in [[Ancient Greece]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pipes&quot;&gt;[[Richard Pipes]] Communism: A History (2001) ISBN 978-0-8129-6864-4, pages 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Plato]] in his ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]'' described it as a state where people shared all their property, wives, and children: &quot;The private and individual is altogether banished from life and things which are by nature private, such as eyes and ears and hands, have become common, and in some way see and hear and act in common, and all men express praise and feel joy and sorrow on the same occasions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pipes&quot;/&gt;

In the [[History of Western philosophy|history of Western thought]], certain elements of the idea of a society based on common ownership of property can be traced back to [[Ancient history|ancient times]]. Examples include the [[Spartacus]] [[Slave rebellion|slave revolt]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vroma.org/~bmcmanus/spartacus.html |title=Historical Background for Spartacus |publisher=Vroma.org |date= |accessdate=2009-10-18| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/60XT6Fh2W | archivedate = 2011-07-29| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 5th century [[Mazdak]] movement in what is now [[Iran]] has been described as &quot;communistic&quot; for challenging the enormous privileges of the noble classes and the clergy, criticizing the institution of [[private property]] and for striving for an egalitarian society.&lt;ref&gt;''The Cambridge History of Iran'' Volume 3, [http://web.archive.org/web/20080611075040/http://www.derafsh-kaviyani.com/english/mazdak.html The Seleucid, Parthian and Sasanian Period], edited by [[Ehsan Yarshater]], Parts 1 and 2, p1019, [[Cambridge University Press]] (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

At one time or another, various small communist communities existed, generally under the inspiration of [[Scripture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lansford_pp24–25&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Lansford|2007|pp=24–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[Christian Church|Christian church]], for example, some [[Monasticism|monastic]] communities and [[religious order]]s shared their land and other property (see ''[[religious communism|Religious]]'' and ''[[Christian communism]]''). These groups often believed that concern with [[private property]] was a distraction from religious service to God and neighbour.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Communist thought has also been traced back to the work of 16th century English writer [[Thomas More]]. In his treatise ''[[Utopia (book)|Utopia]]'' (1516), More portrayed a society based on [[common ownership]] of property, whose rulers administered it through the application of reason.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} In the 17th century, communist thought surfaced again in England, where a [[Puritan]] [[Religious denomination|religious group]] known as the &quot;[[Diggers]]&quot; advocated the abolition of private ownership of land.&lt;ref name=&quot;diggers&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rogerlovejoy.co.uk/philosophy/diggers/diggers3.htm | title = Diggers' Manifesto | accessdate = 2011-07-19| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/60XT6NLIO | archivedate = 2011-07-29| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eduard Bernstein]], in his 1895 ''Cromwell and Communism''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bernstein/works/1895/cromwell/|title=Eduard Bernstein: Cromwell and Communism (1895)}}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that several groupings in the [[English Civil War]], especially the [[Diggers]] espoused clear communistic, agrarian ideals, and that [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s attitude to these groups was at best ambivalent and often hostile.&lt;ref&gt;Eduard Bernstein, (1895).

Dietz, Stuttgart. {{OCLC|36367345}} Sources available at [http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/bernstein/works/1895/cromwell/ Eduard Bernstein: Cromwell and Communism (1895)] at www.marxists.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Criticism of the idea of private property continued into the [[Age of Enlightenment]] of the 18th century, through such thinkers as [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] in France.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Later, following the upheaval of the [[French Revolution]], communism emerged as a political doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Communism&quot; ''A Dictionary of Sociology''. John Scott and [[Gordon Marshall (sociologist)|Gordon Marshall]]. Oxford University Press 2005. Oxford Reference Online. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[François-Noël Babeuf|François Noël Babeuf]], in particular, espoused the goals of common ownership of land and total economic and political equality among citizens.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Various social reformers in the early 19th century founded communities based on common ownership. But unlike many previous communist communities, they replaced the religious emphasis with a rational and philanthropic basis.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;&quot;Communism.&quot; ''Encyclopædia Britannica''. 2006. [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] Online.&lt;/ref&gt; Notable among them were [[Robert Owen]], who founded [[New Harmony, Indiana|New Harmony]] in Indiana (1825), and [[Charles Fourier]], whose followers organized other settlements in the United States such as [[Brook Farm]] (1841–47).&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt; Later in the 19th century, [[Karl Marx]] described these social reformers as &quot;[[utopian socialism|utopian socialists]]&quot; to contrast them with his program of &quot;[[scientific socialism]]&quot; (a term coined by [[Friedrich Engels]]). Other writers described by Marx as &quot;utopian socialists&quot; included [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]].

In its modern form, communism grew out of the socialist movement of 19th century Europe. As the [[Industrial Revolution]] advanced, socialist critics blamed capitalism for the misery of the [[proletariat]]—a new class of urban factory workers who laboured under often-hazardous conditions. Foremost among these critics were Marx and his associate Friedrich Engels. In 1848, Marx and Engels offered a new definition of communism and popularized the term in their famous pamphlet ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;/&gt; Engels, who lived in [[Manchester]], observed the organization of the [[Chartism|Chartist]] movement (''see [[History of British socialism]]''), while Marx departed from his university comrades to meet the proletariat in France and Germany.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

===Modern Communism===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2011}}
[[File:Soviet Union, Lenin (55).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Vladimir Lenin]] after his return to [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]].]]

In the late 19th century, Russian Marxism developed a distinct character. The first major figure of Russian Marxism was [[Georgi Plekhanov]]. Underlying the work of Plekhanov was the assumption that Russia, less urbanized and industrialized than Western Europe, had many years to go before society would be ready for proletarian revolution to occur, and a transitional period of a bourgeois democratic regime would be required to replace [[Tsar]]ism with a socialist and later communist society.&amp;nbsp;(EB){{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In Russia, the [[October Revolution|1917 October Revolution]] was the first time any party with an avowedly Marxist orientation, in this case the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Bolshevik Party]], seized state power. The assumption of state power by the Bolsheviks generated a great deal of practical and theoretical debate within the Marxist movement. Marx predicted that socialism and communism would be built upon foundations laid by the most advanced capitalist development. Russia, however, was one of the poorest countries in Europe with an enormous, largely illiterate peasantry and a minority of industrial workers. Marx had explicitly stated that Russia might be able to skip the stage of bourgeoisie capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Edelman, &quot;Late Marx and the Russian road: Marx and the 'Peripheries of Capitalism'&quot;—book reviews. ''Monthly Review'', Dec., 1984. [[Late Marx and the Russian road: Marx and the &quot;Peripheries of Capitalism.&quot;—book reviews Monthly Review]]&lt;/ref&gt; Other socialists also believed that a [[October Revolution|Russian revolution]] could be the precursor of workers' revolutions in the West.

The moderate [[Menshevik]]s opposed Lenin's Bolshevik plan for [[Communist revolution|socialist revolution]] before capitalism was more fully developed. The Bolsheviks' successful rise to power was based upon the slogans such as &quot;Peace, bread, and land&quot; which tapped the massive public desire for an end to Russian involvement in the [[World War I|First World War]], the peasants' demand for [[land reform]], and popular support for the [[Soviet (council)|Soviets]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hol09|Holmes 2009]], p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

The usage of the terms &quot;communism&quot; and &quot;socialism&quot; shifted after 1917, when the Bolsheviks changed their name to ''Communist Party'' and installed a [[single party state|single party]] regime devoted to the implementation of socialist policies under [[Leninism]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} The [[Second International]] had dissolved in 1916 over national divisions, as the separate national parties that composed it did not maintain a unified front against the [[World War I|war]], instead generally supporting their respective nation's role. Lenin thus created the [[Third International]] (Comintern) in 1919 and sent the [[Twenty-one Conditions]], which included [[democratic centralism]], to all European [[Democratic socialism|socialist parties]] willing to adhere. In France, for example, the majority of the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) party split in 1921 to form the [[French Communist Party|French Section of the Communist International]] (SFIC).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Henceforth, the term &quot;Communism&quot; was applied to the objective of the parties founded under the umbrella of the Comintern. Their program called for the uniting of workers of the world for revolution, which would be followed by the establishment of a [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] as well as the development of a [[Socialist economics|socialist economy]]. Ultimately, if their program held, there would develop a harmonious classless society, with the [[Stateless communism|withering away of the state]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

[[File:Sino-Soviet split 1980.svg|thumb|300px|left|Socialist countries within the Marxist-Leninist definition in 1980. Color-coding indicates political alignment, with either the Soviet Union (red) or the People's Republic of China (yellow), or non-alignment (black).]]

During the [[Russian Civil War]] (1918–1922), the Bolsheviks [[nationalization|nationalized]] all productive property and imposed a policy of [[war communism]], which put factories and railroads under strict government control, collected and rationed food, and introduced some bourgeois management of industry. After three years of war and the 1921 [[Kronstadt rebellion]], Lenin declared the [[New Economic Policy]] (NEP) in 1921, which was to give a &quot;limited place for a limited time to capitalism.&quot; The NEP lasted until 1928, when [[Joseph Stalin]] achieved party leadership, and the introduction of the first Five Year Plan spelled the end of it. Following the Russian Civil War, the Bolsheviks, in 1922, [[History of Soviet Russia and the Soviet Union (1917–1927)#Creation of the USSR|formed the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR), or Soviet Union, from the former [[Russian Empire]].

Following Lenin's democratic centralism, the communist parties were organized on a hierarchical basis, with active cells of members as the broad base; they were made up only of elite [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]] approved by higher members of the party as being reliable and completely subject to [[party discipline]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Norman Davies]]. &quot;Communism&quot; ''The Oxford Companion to World War II''. Ed. I. C. B. Dear and [[M. R. D. Foot]]. Oxford University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Purge]] of 1937–1938 was Stalin's attempt to destroy any possible opposition within the Communist Party. In the [[Moscow Trials]] many old Bolsheviks who had played prominent roles during the Russian Revolution of 1917, or in Lenin's Soviet government afterwards, including [[Lev Kamenev|Kamenev]], [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]], [[Alexei Rykov|Rykov]], and [[Nikolai Bukharin|Bukharin]], were accused, pleaded guilty, and executed.&lt;ref&gt;Sedov, Lev (1980).

Following [[World War II]], Communists consolidated power in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], and in 1949, the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC), led by [[Mao Zedong]], established the [[People's Republic of China]], which would follow its own ideological path of Communist development following the [[Sino-Soviet split]]. [[Cuba]], [[North Korea]], [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]], [[Cambodia]], [[Angola]], and [[Mozambique]] were among the other countries in the [[Third World]] that adopted or imposed a Communist government at some point. By the early 1980s almost one-third of the world's population lived in [[Communist state]]s, including the former Soviet Union and PRC.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Communist states such as the Soviet Union and PRC succeeded in becoming industrial and technological powers, challenging the capitalists' powers in the [[arms race]] and [[space race]].

{{Main|Cold War}}
By virtue of the Soviet Union's victory in the [[World War II|Second World War]] in 1945, the [[Red Army]] occupied nations not only in [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]], but also in [[East Asia]]; consequently, communism as a movement spread to many new countries. This expansion of communism both in Europe and Asia gave rise to a few different branches of its own, such as [[Maoism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;maoism&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/glossary/terms/m/a.htm#maoism|title=Glossary of Terms: Ma|work=[[Marxists Internet Archive]]|accessdate=3 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communism had been vastly strengthened by the winning of many new nations into the [[Soviet Empire|sphere of Soviet influence]] and strength in Central and Eastern Europe. Governments modelled on Soviet Communism took power with Soviet assistance in [[Bulgaria]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[East Germany]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]] and [[Romania]]. A Communist government was also created under [[Joseph Tito|Marshal Tito]] in [[Yugoslavia]], but Tito's independent policies led to the expulsion of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] from the [[Cominform]], which had replaced the [[Comintern]]. [[Titoism]], a new branch in the world Communist movement, was labelled &quot;[[deviationism|deviationist]]&quot;. [[Albania]] also became an independent Communist nation after World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;communistalbania&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/1880822|title=Kushtetuta e Republikës Popullore Socialiste të Shqipërisë : [miratuar nga Kuvendi Popullor më 28. 12. 1976]. – SearchWorks (SULAIR)|language=Albanian|accessdate=3 June 2011| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/60XT817wU | archivedate = 2011-07-29| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1950, the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] held all of [[Mainland China]], thus controlling the most populous nation in the world. Other areas where rising Communist strength provoked dissension and in some cases led to actual fighting through conventional and [[guerrilla warfare]] include the [[Korean War]], [[Laos]], many nations of the [[Middle East]] and [[Africa]], and notably succeeded in the case of the [[Vietnam War]] against the [[Armed forces|military power]] of the United States and its allies. With varying degrees of success, Communists attempted to unite with [[nationalism|nationalist]] and [[socialism|socialist]] forces against what they saw as [[Western world|Western]] [[imperialism]] in these poor countries.

{{Main|Red Scare}}
With the exception of the contribution in [[World War II]] by the Soviet Union, China, and the [[Italian resistance movement]], communism was seen as a rival, and a threat to western democracies and capitalism for most of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georgakas1992&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=The Hollywood Blacklist |last=Georgakas |first=Dan |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the American Left |publisher=University of Illinois Press |year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rivalry peaked during the [[Cold War]], as the world's two remaining superpowers, the United States and the Soviet Union, polarized most of the world into two camps of nations. This was characterized in the West as ''The Free World'' vs. ''Behind the Iron Curtain''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} It supported the spread of their respective economic and political systems (capitalism and communism) and strengthened their military powers. As a result, the camps developed new weapon systems, stockpiled [[nuclear weapon]]s, and competed in space exploration.

Near the beginning of the Cold War, on February 9, 1950, Senator [[Joseph McCarthy]] from [[Wisconsin]] accused 205 Americans working in the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] of being &quot;[[Card-carrying Communist|card-carrying communists]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Without Precedent |last=Adams |first=John G. |year=1983 |publisher=W.

Many famous actors and writers were placed on a blacklist from 1950 to 1954, which meant they would not be hired and would be subject to public disdain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Georgakas1992&quot; /&gt;

===After the collapse of the Soviet Union===
{{further|List of communist parties|List of communist and anti-capitalist parties with parliamentary representation}}
In 1985, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] became leader of the Soviet Union and relaxed central control, in accordance with reform policies of [[glasnost]] (openness) and [[perestroika]] (restructuring). The Soviet Union did not intervene as [[Poland]], [[East Germany]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]], and [[Hungary]] all abandoned Communist rule by 1990. In 1991, the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]].

By the beginning of the 21st century, states controlled by communist parties under a single-party system include the [[People's Republic of China]], [[Cuba]], [[Laos]], [[Vietnam]], and [[North Korea]]. Communist parties, or their descendant parties, remain politically important in a number of other countries. President [[Dimitris Christofias]] of [[Cyprus]] is a member of the [[Progressive Party of Working People]], but the country is not run under single-party rule. The [[South African Communist Party]] is a partner in the [[African National Congress]]-led government.

The People's Republic of China has reassessed many aspects of the Maoist legacy; it, along with Laos, Vietnam, and, to a lesser degree Cuba, has reduced state control of the economy in order to stimulate growth. [[Chinese economic reform]]s started in 1978 under the leadership of [[Deng Xiaoping]]; since then, China has managed to bring down the poverty rate from 53% in the Mao era to just 6% in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://econ.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/EXTDEC/EXTRESEARCH/0,,contentMDK:20634060~pagePK:64165401~piPK:64165026~theSitePK:469382,00.html Fighting Poverty: Findings and Lessons from China’s Success] (World Bank).

Theories within Marxism as to why communism in Central and Eastern Europe was not achieved after socialist revolutions pointed to such elements as the pressure of external capitalist states, the relative backwardness of the societies in which the revolutions occurred, and the emergence of a bureaucratic stratum or class that arrested or diverted the transition press in its own interests. (Scott and Marshall, 2005) Marxist critics of the Soviet Union, most notably Trotsky, referred to the [[Politics of the Soviet Union|Soviet system]], along with other Communist states, as &quot;[[degenerated workers' state|degenerated]]&quot; or &quot;[[deformed workers' state]]s&quot;, arguing that the Soviet system fell far short of Marx's communist ideal and he claimed the [[working class]] was politically dispossessed. The ruling stratum of the Soviet Union was held to be a bureaucratic [[caste]], but not a new [[ruling class]], despite their political control. Anarchists who adhere to [[Participatory economics]] claim that the Soviet Union became dominated by powerful intellectual elites who in a capitalist system crown the proletariat's labour on behalf of the bourgeoisie.

Non-Marxists, in contrast, have often applied the term to any society ruled by a communist party and to any party aspiring to create a society similar to such existing [[Nation state|nation-states]]. In the [[social sciences]], societies ruled by communist parties are distinct for their single party control and their socialist economic bases. While some social and [[List of political scientists|political scientists]] applied the concept of &quot;[[totalitarianism]]&quot; to these societies, others identified possibilities for independent political activity within them,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=H.

==Marxist Communism==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2011}}
{{main|List of communist ideologies}}

Variations to the communist movement have developed, each based upon the ideas of different political theorists, usually as additions or interpretations of various forms of [[Marxism]], the collective philosophies of the [[List of German-language philosophers|German philosophers]] [[Karl Marx]].&lt;ref name=Holmes_p1&gt;[[#Hol09|Holmes 2009]], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marxism-Leninism]] is the synthesis of [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s contributions to Marxism, such as how a revolutionary party should be organised;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lansford|2007|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trotskyism]] is [[Leon Trotsky]]'s conception of Marxism, influenced by Lenin, and meanwhile, [[Maoism]] is [[Mao Zedong]]'s interpretation of Marxism to suit the conditions of China at that time, and is fairly heavy on the need for [[agrarian]] worker support as the engine for the revolution, rather than workers in the urban areas, which were still very small at that point.

Self-identified communists hold a variety of views, including [[Marxism-Leninism]], Trotskyism, [[council communism]], [[Luxemburgism]], [[anarchist communism]], [[Christian communism]], and various currents of [[left communism]]. However, the offshoots of the [[Marxist-Leninist]] interpretations of Marxism are the best-known of these and had been a driving force in [[international relations]] during the last quarter of the 19th century and most of the 20th century up to around 1989 and what historians refer to as &quot;[[collapse of communism|the collapse of communism]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bartleby&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Communism |url=http://www.bartleby.com/65/co/communism.html |encyclopedia=[[The Columbia Encyclopedia]] |edition=6th |year=2007}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other forms of communism worldwide continue to exist in the ideologies of various individual [[labor movement]] [[trade union]]s worldwide, particularly in [[Europe]] and the [[Third World]], and also in [[communist party|communist parties]] that continue to espouse the ultimate need for [[communist revolution]].

Most communists today tend to agree that the remaining [[communist state]]s, such as China, Vietnam and especially [[North Korea]] (which has replaced Marxism-Leninism with [[Juche]] as its official ideology), have nothing to do with communism, whether as practised currently within leftist resistance movements and parties, or in terms of the ideologies and programmes held by those movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;chinaprivateproperty&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elsa.berkeley.edu/~yqian/how%20far%20across%20the%20river.pdf|title=China's Transition to a Market Economy: How Far Across the River?|work=Berkely.edu|accessdate=20 May 2011}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chinacapitalist&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.forbes.com/gadyepstein/2010/08/31/the-winners-and-losers-in-chinese-capitalism/|title=The Winners And Losers In Chinese Capitalism – Gady Epstein – Beijing Dispatch&amp;nbsp;– Forbes|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=20 May 2011| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/60XSxxeOn | archivedate = 2011-07-29| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chinacapitalist2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.forbes.com/greatspeculations/2010/03/22/communism-is-dead-but-state-capitalism-thrives/|title=Communism Is Dead, But State Capitalism Thrives&amp;nbsp;– Great Speculations&amp;nbsp;– Buys, holds, and hopes&amp;nbsp;– Forbes|work=[[Forbes]]|accessdate=20 May 2011| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/60XSyh7Tc | archivedate = 2011-07-29| deadurl=no| first=Vahan| last=Janjigian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chinacapitalist3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.eastday.com/e/ICS/u1a4035916.html|title=Eastday&amp;nbsp;– China is already a market economy&amp;nbsp;– Long Yongtu, Secretary General of Boao Forum for Asia|work=Eastday|accessdate=20 May 2011| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/60XSzp8ZX | archivedate = 2011-07-29| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A diverse range of theories persist amongst prominent globally known people such as [[Slavoj Zizek]], [[Michael Parenti]], [[Alain Badiou]] and other [[far left|radical left]] thinkers who proclaim themselves communists; they and others like them are examples of present-day well-known figures in the modern communist movement.

===Marxism===
[[File:communist-manifesto.png|thumb|upright|''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'']]
{{Main|Marxism}}
Like other socialists, [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] sought an end to capitalism and the systems which they perceived to be responsible for the exploitation of workers. Whereas earlier socialists often favored longer-term [[Reform movement|social reform]], Marx and Engels believed that popular revolution was all but inevitable, and the only path to socialism and communism.

According to the Marxist argument for communism, the main characteristic of human life in [[Social class|class society]] is [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]; and communism is desirable because it entails the full realization of [[Human Freedom|human freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Whitefield. &quot;Communism.&quot; ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Politics''. Ed. Iain McLean and Alistair McMillan. [[Oxford University Press]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx here follows [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] in conceiving freedom not merely as an absence of restraints but as action with content.&lt;ref name=&quot;mclean&quot;&gt;McLean and McMillan, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Marx, communism's outlook on freedom was based on an agent, obstacle, and goal. The agent is the common/working people; the obstacles are class divisions, economic inequalities, unequal [[Life chances|life-chances]], and [[false consciousness]]; and the goal is the fulfilment of human needs including satisfying work, and fair share of the product.&lt;ref&gt;Ball and Dagger 118&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terence Ball and Richard Dagger. &quot;Political Ideologies and the Democratic Ideal.&quot; [[Pearson Education]], Inc.:2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

They believed that communism allowed people to do what they want, but also put humans in such conditions and such relations with one another that they would not wish to exploit, or have any need to. Whereas for Hegel the unfolding of this ethical life in history is mainly driven by the realm of ideas, for Marx, communism emerged from material forces, particularly the development of the [[means of production]].&lt;ref name = &quot;mclean&quot;/&gt;

Marxism holds that a process of [[class conflict]] and revolutionary struggle will result in victory for the [[proletariat]] and the establishment of a [[communist society]] in which [[private property|private property and ownership]] is abolished over time and the means of production and subsistence belong to the community. (Private property and ownership, in this context, means ownerships of the [[means of production]], not private possessions).&lt;ref name=&quot;MarxEngels2005&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karl Marx|author2=Friedrich Engels|author3=Philip Gasper|title=The Communist manifesto: a road map to history's most important political document|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KP639MoNBMMC&amp;pg=PA60|accessdate=12 April 2011|date=1 October 2005|publisher=Haymarket Books|isbn=978-1-931859-25-7|pages=60–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marx himself wrote little about life under communism, giving only the most general indication as to what constituted a communist society. It is clear that it entails abundance in which there is little limit to the projects that humans may undertake.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} In the popular slogan that was adopted by the [[Communist Movement|communist movement]], communism was a world in which each gave according to their abilities, and received according to their needs. ''[[The German Ideology]]'' (1845) was one of Marx's few writings to elaborate on the communist future:

{{quote|&quot;In communist society, where nobody has one exclusive sphere of activity but each can become accomplished in any branch he wishes, society regulates the general production and thus makes it possible for me to do one thing today and another tomorrow, to hunt in the morning, fish in the afternoon, rear cattle in the evening, criticise after dinner, just as I have a mind, without ever becoming hunter, fisherman, herdsman or critic.&quot;|&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx, (1845). ''[[The German Ideology]]'', Marx-Engels Institute, Moscow. ISBN 978-1-57392-258-6. Sources available at [http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1845/german-ideology/ch01a.htm The German Ideology] at www.marxists.org.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Marx's lasting vision was to add this vision to a theory of how society was moving in a law-governed way towards communism, and, with some tension, a political theory that explained why revolutionary activity was required to bring it about.&lt;ref name=&quot;mclean&quot;/&gt;

In the late 19th century, the terms &quot;socialism&quot; and &quot;communism&quot; were often used interchangeably. However, Marx and Engels argued that communism would not emerge from capitalism in a fully [[Developed country|developed state]], but would pass through a &quot;first phase&quot; in which most productive property was owned in common, but with some class differences remaining. The &quot;first phase&quot; would eventually evolve into a &quot;higher phase&quot; in which class differences were eliminated, and a state was no longer needed. Lenin frequently used the term &quot;socialism&quot; to refer to Marx and Engels' supposed &quot;first phase&quot; of communism and used the term &quot;communism&quot; interchangeably with Marx and Engels' &quot;higher phase&quot; of communism.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/staterev/ch05.htm#s3 Chapter 5] of Vladimir Lenin's ''The State and Revolution&quot; (1917).&lt;/ref&gt;

These later aspects, particularly as developed by Vladimir Lenin, provided the underpinning for the mobilizing features of 20th century communist parties.

===Leninism and Marxism-Leninism===
{{Marxism–Leninism sidebar}}
{{Main|Leninism|Marxism-Leninism}}
Leninism is the political movement developed by [[Vladimir Lenin]], which has become the foundation for the organizational structure of most major communist parties. Leninists advocate the creation of a vanguard party led by dedicated revolutionaries in order to lead the working class revolution to victory. Leninists believe that socialism will not arise spontaneously through the natural decay of capitalism and that workers are unable to organize and develop socialist consciousness without the guidance of the Vanguard party. After taking power, Vanguard parties seek to create a socialist state continually led by the Vanguard party in order to direct social development and defend against counterrevolutionary insurrection. The mode of industrial organization championed by Leninism and Marxism-Leninism is the capitalist model of scientific management pioneered by [[Taylorism|Fredrick Taylor]].

Marxism-Leninism is a version of Leninism merged with [[classical Marxism]] adopted by the Soviet Union and most communist parties across the world today. It shaped the Soviet Union and influenced communist parties worldwide. It was heralded as a possibility of building communism via a massive program of [[industrialization]] and [[Collectivisation in the Soviet Union|collectivisation]]. Despite the fall of the Soviet Union and the 'Eastern Bloc' (meaning communist countries of Eastern and Central Europe), many communist parties of the world today still lay claim to uphold the Marxist-Leninist banner. Marxism-Leninism expands on Marxist thoughts by bringing the theories to what Lenin and other Communists considered, the age of capitalist imperialism, and a renewed focus on party building, the development of a [[socialist state]], and democratic centralism as an organisational principle.

Lenin's pamphlet ''[[What is to be Done? (pamphlet)|What is to be Done?]]'' (1902), proposed that the (urban) [[proletariat]] can successfully achieve revolutionary consciousness only under the leadership of a [[vanguard party]] of [[professional revolutionaries]]—who can achieve aims only with internal [[democratic centralism]] in the party; tactical and ideological policy decisions are agreed via democracy, and every member must support and promote the agreed party policy.

To wit, [[capitalism]] can be overthrown only with revolution—because attempts to ''reform'' capitalism from within ([[Fabianism]]) and from without ([[social democracy]]) will fail because of its inherent contradictions. The purpose of a Leninist revolutionary vanguard party is the forceful [[deposition (politics)|deposition]] of the incumbent government; assume power (as agent of the proletariat) and establish the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]]. Moreover, as the government, the vanguard party must educate the proletariat—to dispel the societal [[false consciousness]] of religion and nationalism that are culturally instilled by the [[bourgeoisie]] in facilitating exploitation, and to instil the [[materialism|material]] scientific outlook of the world and the sense of [[proletarian internationalism]]. The dictatorship of the proletariat is governed with a de-centralized [[direct democracy]] practised via [[soviet (council)|soviets]] (councils) where the workers exercise political power (cf. [[soviet democracy]]); the fifth chapter of ''State &amp; Revolution'', describes it:

{{quote|&quot;.... the dictatorship of the proletariat—i.e. the organisation of the vanguard of the oppressed as the ruling class for the purpose of crushing the oppressors.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. An immense expansion of democracy, which for the first time becomes democracy for the poor, democracy for the people, and not democracy for the rich:&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. and suppression by force, i.e. exclusion from democracy, for the exploiters and oppressors of the people—this is the change which democracy undergoes during the ''transition'' from capitalism to communism.&quot;|&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Christopher ''Lenin and the Russian Revolution'' (1971) Penguin Books:Londonp. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The post-[[October Revolution|revolutionary]] [[Bolshevik]] government was hostile to nationalism, especially to [[Russian nationalism]], the &quot;Great Russian chauvinism&quot;, which was seen as an obstacle to establishing the dictatorship of the proletariat.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, Neil (ed.) ''The State in Socialist Society'', second edition (1984) St. Antony's College: Oxford, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; However, under the regime of [[Joseph Stalin]], after the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] victory in the [[Great Patriotic War]], Russian nationalism became upheld as a force in shaping both the domestic and foreign policies of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brudny|first=Yitzhak|title=Re-Inventing Russia: Russian Nationalism and the Soviet State (1953 - 1991)|year=1998|isbn=0-674-00438-8|url=http://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=a-dbI7B6Vs0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=stalinism+russian+nationalism&amp;ots=abY482UpoS&amp;sig=TCCekEgcsnR2X-aSZGMP8dDg7QA#v=onepage&amp;q=stalinism%20russian%20nationalism&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The primary elements unique to Marxism-Leninism are: the revolutionary vanguard party, [[revolutionary socialism|revolution as a means to overthrow capitalism]], and democratic centralism.

===Stalinism===
{{Main|Stalinism}}
[[File:JStalin Secretary general CCCP 1942.jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Joseph Stalin]]]]
Stalinism was the [[political system]] of the Soviet Union and the countries within the [[Soviet sphere of influence]] during the leadership of [[Joseph Stalin]]. The term usually defines the style of a government rather than an ideology. The ideology was officially Marxism-Leninism theory, reflecting that Stalin himself was not a theoretician, in contrast to Marx and Lenin, and prided himself on maintaining the legacy of Lenin as a founding father for the Soviet Union and the future Socialist world. Stalinism is an interpretation of their ideas, and a certain political regime claiming to apply those ideas in ways fitting the changing needs of Soviet society, as with the transition from &quot;socialism at a snail's pace&quot; in the mid-twenties to the rapid industrialization of the [[Five-Year Plans for the National Economy of the Soviet Union|Five-Year Plans]].

The main contributions of Stalin to communist theory were:
* The groundwork for the Soviet policy concerning nationalities, laid in Stalin's 1913 work ''Marxism and the National Question'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1913/03.htm|title=Marxism and the National Question}}&lt;/ref&gt; praised by Lenin.
* [[Socialism in One Country]], stating that communists should attain socialism in their own country as a prelude to internationalising.
* The theory of [[aggravation of class struggle under socialism|aggravation of the class struggle along with the development of socialism]], a theoretical base supporting the repression of political opponents as necessary.

The legitimacy of Stalin's claim to the role of leadership in the Soviet Union (and thus the international communist movement as a whole) is a matter of some debate. Advocates of Stalinism cite both Lenin's praising of the early works of Stalin and the economic successes of the Five-Year Plans. Opponents, however, point out that certain aspects of Stalinism (socialism in one country, &quot;[[Left-wing_nationalism#Stalinism_and_.22revolutionary_patriotism.22|revolutionary patriotism]]&quot;, etc.) are not found in Leninism, and argue that some aspects are even contradictory to Marxism-Leninism. Also, in [[Lenin's Testament]],  a document written by Vladimir Lenin in the last weeks of 1922 and the first week of 1923 outlining his proposed changes to the structure of the Soviet governing bodies, Lenin suggested &quot;that the comrades think about a way of removing Stalin from [the Secretary-General] post and appointing another man in his stead who in all other respects differs from Comrade Stalin in having only one advantage, namely, that of being more tolerant, more loyal, more polite and more considerate to the comrades, less capricious, etc.&quot; Both sides of this debate identify as being ideologically orthodox to Leninism and criticise the other as being &quot;[[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]].&quot;

===Trotskyism===
{{Main|Trotskyism}}
[[File:Trotsky militant.jpg|thumb|right|250px|right|[[Leon Trotsky]] reading ''[[The Militant]]''.]]
Trotskyism is the branch of Marxism that was developed by [[Leon Trotsky]]. It supports the theory of [[permanent revolution]] and [[world revolution]] instead of the [[two stage theory]] and [[socialism in one country]]. It supported [[proletarian internationalism]] and another Communist revolution in the Soviet Union, which, under the leadership of Stalin, Trotsky claimed had become a [[degenerated worker's state]], rather than the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], in which class relations had re-emerged in a new form.

Trotsky and his supporters organized into the ''[[Left Opposition]]'' and their platform became known as Trotskyism. Stalin eventually succeeded in gaining control of the Soviet regime and Trotskyist attempts to remove Stalin from power resulted in Trotsky's exile from the Soviet Union in 1929. During Trotsky's exile, world communism fractured into two distinct branches: [[Marxism-Leninism]] and Trotskyism.&lt;ref name=&quot;columbia&quot;/&gt; Trotsky later founded the [[Fourth International]], a Trotskyist rival to the [[Comintern]], in 1938.

Trotskyist ideas have continually found a modest echo among [[political movement]]s in some countries in [[Latin America]] and [[Asia]], especially in [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. Many Trotskyist organizations are also active in more stable, developed countries in [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]]. Trotsky's politics differed sharply from those of Stalin and Mao, most importantly in declaring the need for an international proletarian revolution (rather than socialism in one country) and unwavering support for a true dictatorship of the proletariat based on democratic principles.

However, as a whole, Trotsky's theories and attitudes were never accepted in worldwide mainstream Communist circles after Trotsky's expulsion, either within or outside of the [[Eastern Bloc|Soviet bloc]]. This remained the case even after the [[Secret Speech]] and subsequent events which critics claim exposed the fallibility of Stalin.

Maoism is the Marxist-Leninist trend of Communism associated with [[Mao Zedong]] and was mostly practiced within China. [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s reforms heightened ideological differences between China and the Soviet Union, which became increasingly apparent in the 1960s. Parties and groups that supported the [[Communist Party of China]] (CPC) in their criticism against the new Soviet leadership proclaimed themselves as 'anti-revisionist' and denounced the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] and the parties aligned with it as [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] &quot;capitalist-roaders.&quot; The Sino-Soviet Split resulted in divisions amongst communist parties around the world. Notably, the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] sided with the [[People's Republic of China]]. Effectively, the CPC under Mao's leadership became the rallying forces of a parallel international Communist tendency.

Definitions of Maoism vary. Within the Chinese context, Maoism can refer to Mao's belief in the mobilization of the masses, particularly in large-scale political movements; it can also refer to the [[egalitarianism]] that was seen during Mao's era as opposed to the free-market ideology of [[Deng Xiaoping]]; some scholars additionally define [[personality cult]]s and political sloganeering as &quot;Maoist&quot; practices. Contemporary Maoists in China criticize the social inequalities created by a capitalist and 'revisionist' Communist party.{{clear left}}

===Prachanda Path===
{{See also|Marxism–Leninism–Maoism–Prachanda Path}}

Prachanda Path refers to the ideological line of the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)|Unified Communist Party of Nepal]]. This thought is an extension of Marxism, Leninism and Maoism, totally based on home-ground politics of [[Nepal]]. The doctrine came into existence after it was realized that the ideology of Marxism, Leninism and Maoism could not be practiced completely as it was done in the past. And an ideology suitable, based on the ground reality of Nepalese politics was adopted by the party.

===Hoxhaism===
{{Main|Hoxhaism}}
Another variant of [[anti-revisionist]] Marxism-Leninism appeared after the [[Sino-Albanian split|ideological row]] between the Communist Party of China and the [[Party of Labour of Albania]] in 1978. The Albanians rallied a new separate international tendency, which would demarcate itself by a strict defence of the legacy of Joseph Stalin and fierce criticism of virtually all other Communist groupings as [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionism]]. Critical of the [[United States]], the Soviet Union, and China, [[Enver Hoxha]] declared the latter two to be [[social-imperialist]] and condemned the [[Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia]] by withdrawing from the [[Warsaw Pact]] in response. Hoxha declared Albania to be the world's only Marxist-Leninist state after 1978. The Albanians were able to win over a large share of the Maoists, mainly in [[Latin America]] such as the [[Popular Liberation Army]], but also had a significant [[Party of Labour of Albania#External following|international following]] in general. This tendency has occasionally been labelled as 'Hoxhaism' after him.

After the fall of the Communist government in Albania, the pro-Albanian parties are grouped around an [[International Conference of Marxist-Leninist Parties and Organizations (Unity &amp; Struggle)|international conference]] and the publication 'Unity and Struggle'.

===Titoism===
{{Main|Titoism}}
Elements of Titoism are characterized by policies and practices based on the principle that in each country, the means of attaining ultimate communist goals must be dictated by the conditions of that particular country, rather than by a pattern set in another country. During Tito's era, this specifically meant that the communist goal should be pursued independently of (and often in opposition to) the policies of the Soviet Union. The term was originally meant as a [[pejorative]], and was labelled by Moscow as a heresy during the period of tensions between the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia known as the ''[[Informbiro]]'' period from 1948 to 1955.

Unlike the rest of Central and Eastern Europe, which fell under Stalin's influence post–World War II, [[SFRY|Yugoslavia]], due to the strong leadership of Marshal [[Josip Broz Tito]] and the fact that the [[Yugoslav Partisans]] liberated Yugoslavia with only limited help from the [[Red Army]], remained independent from Moscow. It became the only country in the [[Balkans]] to resist pressure from Moscow to join the [[Warsaw Pact]] and remained &quot;socialist, but independent&quot; until the collapse of Soviet socialism in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Throughout his time in office, Tito prided himself on Yugoslavia's independence from Russia, with Yugoslavia never accepting full membership of the [[Comecon]] and Tito's open rejection of many aspects of Stalinism as the most obvious manifestations of this.

===Eurocommunism===
{{Main|Eurocommunism}}
Eurocommunism was a trend in the 1970s and 1980s within various [[Western Europe]]an communist parties to develop a theory and practice of social transformation that was more relevant in a Western European democracy and less aligned to the influence or control of the Soviet Union. Parties such as the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI), the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF), and the [[Communist Party of Spain (main)|Communist Party of Spain]] (PCE), were politically active and electorally significant in their respective countries).{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

The main theoretical foundation of Eurocommunism was [[Antonio Gramsci]]'s writing about Marxist theory which questioned the sectarianism of the Left and encouraged communist parties to develop social alliances to win [[Cultural hegemony|''hegemonic'']] support for social reforms. Eurocommunist parties expressed their fidelity to democratic institutions more clearly than before and attempted to widen their appeal by embracing [[public sector]] [[middle-class]] workers, [[new social movements]] such as [[feminism]] and [[gay liberation]] and more publicly questioning the Soviet Union. Early inspirations can also be found in the [[Austromarxism]] and its seeking of a &quot;third&quot; democratic &quot;way&quot; to socialism.

===Libertarian Marxism===
{{Main|Libertarian Marxism}}
Libertarian Marxism refers to a broad scope of economic and political philosophies that emphasize the [[anti-authoritarian]] aspects of [[Marxism]]. Early currents of libertarian Marxism, known as [[left communism]],&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, Wayne.[http://www.utopianmag.com/files/in/1000000034/12___WayneLibMarx.pdf &quot;Libertarian Marxism's Relation to Anarchism&quot;] &quot;The Utopian&quot; 73-80.&lt;/ref&gt; emerged in opposition to [[Marxism–Leninism]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Herman Gorter]], [[Antonie Pannekoek|Anton Pannekoek]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]], Otto Ruhl ''Non-Leninist Marxism: Writings on the Workers Councils''.

Re-imposition of Work in Britain and the 'Social Europe'&quot;] &quot;Aufheben&quot; Issue #8 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian Marxist currents often draw from Marx and Engels' later works, specifically the ''[[Grundrisse]]'' and ''[[The Civil War in France]]'';&lt;ref&gt;Ernesto Screpanti, Libertarian communism: Marx Engels and the Political Economy of Freedom, Palgrave Macmillan, London, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasizing the Marxist belief in the ability of the [[working class]] to forge its own destiny without the need for a revolutionary party or [[State (polity)|state]] to mediate or aid its liberation.&lt;ref&gt;Draper, Hal.

[http://chomsky.info/audionvideo/19700216.mp3 &quot;Government In The Future&quot;] Poetry Center of the New York YM-YWHA. Lecture.&lt;/ref&gt;

Libertarian Marxism includes such currents as [[Luxemburgism]], [[council communism]], [[left communism]], ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]'', the [[Johnson-Forest tendency]], [[world socialism]], [[Lettrism]]/[[Situationist International|Situationism]] and  [[operaismo]]/[[autonomism]], and [[New Left]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/library/libertarian-marxist-tendency-map |title=A libertarian Marxist tendency map |publisher=libcom.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libertarian Marxism has often had a strong influence on both [[Post-left anarchism|post-left]] and [[Social anarchism|social anarchists]]. Notable theorists of libertarian Marxism have included [[Anton Pannekoek]], [[Raya Dunayevskaya]], [[CLR James]], [[Antonio Negri]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], [[Maurice Brinton]], [[Guy Debord]], [[Daniel Guérin]], [[Ernesto Screpanti]] and [[Raoul Vaneigem]].

===Council Communism===
{{Main|Council communism}}
Council communism is a [[far-left]] movement originating in [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]] in the 1920s. Its primary organization was the [[Communist Workers Party of Germany]] (KAPD). Council communism continues today as a theoretical and activist position within both left-wing Marxism and [[libertarian socialism]].

The central argument of council communism, in contrast to those of [[social democracy]] and Leninist Communism, is that democratic [[workers' councils]] arising in the factories and municipalities are the natural form of working class organisation and governmental power. This view is opposed to both the [[reformist]] and the Leninist [[ideology|ideologies]], with their stress on, respectively, parliaments and [[New institutionalism|institutional]] government (i.e., by applying social reforms), on the one hand, and [[vanguard party|vanguard parties]] and participative [[democratic centralism]] on the other).

The core principle of council communism is that the government and the [[economic system|economy]] should be managed by [[workers' councils]] composed of delegates elected at workplaces and [[recall election|recallable]] at any moment. As such, council communists oppose [[planned economy|state-run]] [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] &quot;[[State socialism]]&quot;/&quot;[[State capitalism]]&quot;. They also oppose the idea of a &quot;revolutionary party&quot;, since council communists believe that a revolution led by a party will necessarily produce a party dictatorship. Council communists support a worker's democracy, which they want to produce through a federation of workers' councils.
[[File:Rosa Luxemburg.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Rosa Luxemburg]], prominent left communist critic of Leninism]]

===Left Communism===
{{Main|Left communism}}
Left communism is the range of communist viewpoints held by the communist left, which criticizes the political ideas of the [[Bolshevik]]s at certain periods, from a position that is asserted to be more authentically Marxist and proletarian than the views of Leninism held by the [[Comintern|Communist International]] after its first and during its second congress.

Left Communists see themselves to the left of Leninists (whom they tend to see as 'left of capital', not socialists), [[Anarchist communism|anarchist communists]] (some of whom they consider internationalist socialists) as well as some other revolutionary socialist tendencies (for example [[De Leonism|De Leonists]], who they tend to see as being internationalist socialists only in limited instances).

Although she died before left communism became a distinct tendency, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] has heavily influenced most left communists, both politically and theoretically. Proponents of left communism have included [[Amadeo Bordiga]], [[Herman Gorter]], [[Antonie Pannekoek|Anton Pannekoek]], [[Otto Rühle]], [[Karl Korsch]], [[Sylvia Pankhurst]] and [[Paul Mattick]].

Prominent [[List of left-wing internationals|left communist groups existing today]] include the [[International Communist Party]], the [[International Communist Current]] and the [[Internationalist Communist Tendency]].

===Situationism===
{{Main|Situationist International}}
The Situationist International was a restricted group of international revolutionaries founded in 1957, and which had its peak in its influence on the unprecedented [[general strike|general]] [[wildcat strikes]] of [[May 1968 in France]].

With their ideas rooted in Marxism and the 20th century European artistic [[avant-garde]]s, they advocated experiences of life being alternative to those admitted by the [[capitalism|capitalist order]], for the fulfillment of human primitive desires and the pursuing of a superior passional quality. For this purpose they suggested and experimented with the ''construction of situations'', namely the setting up of environments favorable for the fulfillment of such desires. Using methods drawn from the arts, they developed a series of experimental fields of study for the construction of such situations, like [[unitary urbanism]] and [[psychogeography]].

They fought against the main obstacle on the fulfillment of such superior passional living, identified by them in [[advanced capitalism]]. Their theoretical work peaked on the highly influential book ''[[The Society of the Spectacle]]'' by [[Guy Debord]]. Debord argued in 1967 that spectacular features like [[mass media]] and advertising have a central role in an advanced capitalist society, which is to show a fake reality in order to mask the real capitalist degradation of human life. To overthrow such a system, the Situationist International supported the May 1968 revolts, and asked the workers to [[Council for Maintaining the Occupations|occupy the factories]] and to run them with [[direct democracy]], through [[workers' councils]] composed by instantly revocable delegates.

===Autonomism===
{{Main|Autonomism}}
[[File:AntonioNegri SeminarioInternacionalMundo.jpg|upright|thumb|left|[[Antonio Negri]], main theorist of Italian autonomism]]Autonomism refers to a set of [[left-wing]] political and social movements and theories close to the socialist movement. As an identifiable theoretical system it first emerged in [[History of Italy as a Republic|Italy in the 1960s]] from [[workerist]] (''[[operaismo]]'') communism. Later, [[Post-Marxism|post-Marxist]] and [[anarchist]] tendencies became significant after influence from the [[Situationist International|Situationists]], the failure of Italian [[far-left]] movements in the 1970s, and the emergence of a number of important theorists including [[Antonio Negri]], who had contributed to the 1969 founding of ''[[Potere Operaio]]'', Mario Tronti, [[Paolo Virno]], etc.

Through translations made available by Danilo Montaldi and others, the Italian autonomists drew upon previous activist research in the United States by the [[Johnson-Forest Tendency]] and in France by the group [[Socialisme ou Barbarie]].

It influenced the German and Dutch Autonomen, the worldwide [[Social Centre movement]], and today is influential in Italy, France, and to a lesser extent the English-speaking countries. Those who describe themselves as autonomists now vary from Marxists to [[post-structuralism|post-structuralists]] and anarchists. The Autonomist Marxist and ''Autonomen'' movements provided inspiration to some on the revolutionary left in English speaking countries, particularly among anarchists, many of whom have adopted autonomist tactics. Some English-speaking anarchists even describe themselves as ''Autonomists''. The Italian ''operaismo'' movement also influenced Marxist academics such as [[Harry Cleaver]], [[John Holloway (economist)|John Holloway]], Steve Wright, and [[Nick Dyer-Witheford]].{{clear left}}

==Non-Marxist Communism==
The dominant forms of communism are based on Marxism, but non-Marxist versions of communism (such as [[Christian communism]] and [[anarchist communism]]) also exist.

===Anarchist Communism===
{{Main|Anarchist communism}}
[[File:Kropotkin2.jpg|180px|thumb|[[Peter Kropotkin]], main theorist of [[anarcho-communism]]]]Anarchist communism (also known as libertarian communism) is a theory of [[anarchism]] which advocates the abolition of the [[State (polity)|state]], [[private property]], and [[capitalism]] in favour of [[common ownership]] of the [[means of production]],&lt;ref name=Mayne&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=6MkTz6Rq7wUC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;dq=Communist+anarchism+belives+in+collective+ownership |title=From Politics Past to Politics Future: An Integrated Analysis of Current and Emergent Paradigms Alan James Mayne Published 1999 Greenwood Publishing Group 316 pages ISBN 0-275-96151-6 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-09-20|isbn=978-0-275-96151-0|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=jeiudz5sBV4C&amp;pg=PA14 |title=Anarchism for Know-It-Alls|publisher=Filiquarian Publishing|year=2008|accessdate=2010-09-20|isbn=978-1-59986-218-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[direct democracy]] and a horizontal network of [[voluntary association]]s and [[workers' council]]s with production and consumption based on the guiding principle: &quot;[[from each according to his ability, to each according to his need]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fabbri, Luigi. &quot;Anarchism and Communism.&quot; Northeastern Anarchist #4. 1922. 13 October 2002. http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/worldwidemovements/fabbrianarandcom.html {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/60XT4dCPz|date =2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Makhno, Mett, Arshinov, Valevski, Linski (Dielo Trouda). &quot;The Organizational Platform of the Libertarian Communists&quot;. 1926.

Anarcho-communism differs from marxism rejecting its view about the need for a State Socialism phase before building communism. The main anarcho-communist theorist [[Peter Kropotkin]] argued &quot;that a revolutionary society should “transform itself immediately into a communist society,”, that is, should go immediately into what Marx had regarded as the “more advanced,” completed, phase of communism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;theanarchistlibrary.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Wayne_Price__What_is_Anarchist_Communism_.html|title=&quot;What is Anarchist Communism?&quot; by Wayne Price| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/60XT4wIPV | archivedate = 2011-07-29| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this way it tries to avoid the reappearence of &quot;class divisions and the need for a state to oversee everything&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;theanarchistlibrary.org&quot;/&gt;

Some forms of anarchist communism such as [[insurrectionary anarchism]] are [[egoist anarchism|egoist]] and strongly influenced by radical [[individualism]],&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Gray, ''Leaving the Twentieth Century'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;creativenothing&quot;&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Renzo_Novatore__Toward_the_Creative_Nothing.html &quot;Towards the creative Nothing&quot; by [[Renzo Novatore]] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/60XT5H7mi|date =2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Bob_Black__Nightmares_of_Reason.html#toc22|title=Bob Black.

To date in human history, the best known examples of an ''anarchist communist'' society, established around the ideas as they exist today, that received worldwide attention and knowledge in the historical canon, are the anarchist territories during the [[Spanish Revolution]] and the [[Free Territory]] during the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]]. Through the efforts and influence of the [[Spanish Anarchists]] during the [[Spanish Revolution]] within the [[Spanish Civil War]], starting in 1936 anarchist communism existed in most of Aragon, parts of the Levante and Andalusia, as well as in the stronghold of [[Anarchist Catalonia]] before being brutally crushed by the combined forces of [[Francoism|the authoritarian regime that won the war]], Hitler, Mussolini, Spanish Communist Party repression (backed by the USSR) as well as economic and armaments blockades from the capitalist countries and the Spanish Republic itself. During the Russian Revolution, anarchists such as [[Nestor Makhno]] worked to create and defend—through the [[Revolutionary Insurrectionary Army of Ukraine]]—anarchist communism in the [[Free Territory]] of the Ukraine from 1919 before being conquered by the Bolsheviks in 1921.

===Christian Communism===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
[[Christian communism]] is a form of religious communism centred on [[Christianity]]. It is a theological and political theory based upon the view that the [[Jesus|teachings of Jesus Christ]] urge Christians to support communism as the ideal [[Social structure|social system]]. Christian communists trace the origins of their practice to teachings in the [[New Testament]], such as the [[Acts of the Apostles]] at chapter 2 and verses 42, 44 and 45:
{{quote|{{sup|42}} ''And they continued steadfastly in the apostles' doctrine and in fellowship [[...]]'' {{sup|44}} ''And all that believed were together, and had all things in common;'' {{sup|45}} ''And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all men, as every man had need.''|[[Authorized King James Version|King James Version]]}}

Christian communism can be seen as a radical form of [[Christian socialism]]. Also, because many Christian communists have formed independent stateless communes in the past, there is a link between Christian communism and [[Christian anarchism]]. Christian communists may not agree with various parts of [[Marxism]], but they share some of the political goals of Marxists, for example replacing capitalism with [[socialism]], which should in turn be followed by communism at a later point in the future. However, Christian communists sometimes disagree with Marxists (and particularly with [[Leninism|Leninists]]) on the way a socialist or communist society should be organized.

Valentino. ''Final Solutions: Mass Killing and Genocide in the Twentieth Century.'' [[Cornell University Press]], 2004.

The [[Council of Europe]] in [[Council of Europe resolution 1481|Resolution 1481]] and international declarations such as the [[Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism]] and the [[Declaration on Crimes of Communism]] have condemned some of the actions that resulted in these deaths as crimes.

[[Stéphane Courtois]] argues that communism is responsible for the murder of almost 100 million people in the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Black Book of Communism: Crimes, Terror, Repression | editor1-last = Courtois | editor1-first = Stéphane | editor1-link = |coauthors= |year= 1999 |publisher= Harvard University Press |isbn= 978-0-674-07608-2 |page= 9 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but two of the main ''Black Book'''s contributors, Nicolas Werth and Jean-Louis Margolin, disagreed and publicly disassociated themselves from Courtois's statements.&lt;ref&gt;''Le Monde'', 14 November 1997&lt;/ref&gt;
