'''[[Trans World Airlines]] Flight 800''' ('''TWA 800'''), a [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-131]], exploded and crashed into the Atlantic Ocean near [[East Moriches, New York]], on July 17, 1996, at about 20:31 [[Eastern Daylight Time|EDT]], 12 minutes after takeoff from [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]], killing all 230 people on board. TWA 800 was the second-deadliest U.S. [[aviation accident]] after [[American Airlines Flight 191]] until [[American Airlines Flight 587]], which also took off from JFK Airport two months after the [[September 11 attacks]]. It remains the third-deadliest aviation accident to occur in U.S. territory. TWA 800 was a scheduled international passenger flight from New York to Rome, with a stopover in Paris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=National Transportation Safety Board | year=2000 | title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 | journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 | pages=p.1 | url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=April 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four-year NTSB investigation concluded with the approval of the Aircraft Accident Report on August 23, 2000, ending the most extensive, complex, and costly air disaster investigation in United States history.&lt;ref name=&quot;NTSB Board Meeting II-4&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www3.ntsb.gov/events/TWA800/Transcript_8_23_4.htm |title=NTSB Board Meeting on TWA 800&amp;nbsp;August&amp;nbsp;23, 2000, Part 4 |author=National Transportation Safety Board | accessdate=April 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CIA Report 14Aug08&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Tauss, Randolph M.| title= The Crash of TWA Flight 800 | date=August 14, 2008 | url=https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/2008-featured-story-archive/crash-of-twa-flight-800.html |accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report's conclusion was that the probable cause of the accident was an explosion of flammable fuel/air vapors in a fuel tank, and, although it could not be determined with certainty, the most likely cause of the explosion was a short circuit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.xvi&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=National Transportation Safety Board | year=2000 | title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 | journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 | pages=p.xvi | url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the investigation, new requirements were developed for aircraft to prevent future fuel tank explosions.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeattlePI 16Jul08&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Joan | last=Lowery | title=Jet fuel-tank protection ordered | url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/371075_airsafety17.html | agency=The Associated Press | newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | date=July 16, 2008| accessdate=April 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[TWA Flight 800 alternative theories]] exist, the most prevalent being that a missile strike from a terrorist or [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] vessel caused the crash, and is the subject of a government coverup.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 17Sep96&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Andrew C. | last=Revkin | title=Conspiracy Theories Rife On Demise of Flight 800 | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/17/nyregion/conspiracy-theories-rife-on-demise-of-flight-800.html | newspaper=The New York Times | date=September 17, 1996 | accessdate=April 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN 17Jul06&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=CNN | title='Pierre Salinger Syndrome' and the TWA 800 conspiracies | url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/07/12/twa.conspiracy/index.html | date=July 17, 2006 | accessdate=April 5, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident flight==
[[File:TWA Boeing 747-100 N93119 Marmet.jpg|thumb|N93119 seen at [[London Heathrow Airport]] in 1982.]]
:''All times in this article are [[Eastern Daylight Time|Eastern Daylight Time (EDT)]].''
The accident airplane, [[Aircraft registration|registration]] N93119, was manufactured by [[Boeing]] in July 1971, and purchased new by TWA. The aircraft had completed 16,869 flights with 93,303 hours of operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.6&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=National Transportation Safety Board | year=2000 | title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 | journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 | pages=p.6 | url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of the accident the airplane departed Athens, Greece, as TWA Flight 881, and arrived at the gate at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK)]] about 16:38. The aircraft was refueled, and there was a crew change; the new flight crew consisted of [[Pilot in command|Captain]] Ralph G. Kevorkian, Captain/Check Airman Steven E. Snyder and [[Flight Engineer]]/Check Airman Richard G. Campbell (all with more than 30 years  employment at TWA), and Flight Engineer Trainee Oliver Krick, who was starting the sixth leg of his initial operating experience training.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pp.4-5&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=National Transportation Safety Board | year=2000 | title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 | journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 | pages=pp.4–5 | url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TWA Press Release&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title=Passenger and crew list, TWA Flight 800 |url=http://www.avweb.com/other/twpx9629.html |publisher=Trans World Airlines |agency=Trans World Airlines |date=July 19, 1996 |accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of technical problems with the [[thrust reverser]] sensors during the landing of TWA 881 at JFK, prior to flight 800 the ground-maintenance crew locked-out the thrust reverser for engine #3 (treated as a [[minimum equipment list]] item). In addition, severed cables for the engine #3 thrust reverser were replaced.&lt;ref name=&quot;DCA-96-MA-070&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=National Transportation Safety Board | date=1997-09-30 | title=Airplane Performance Study - Attachment I: Boeing's TWA Flight 800 FDR Data Summary  | url=http://www.ntsb.gov/events/twa800/exhibits/ex_13a.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=November 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During refueling of the aircraft, the volumetric shutoff (VSO) control was believed to have been triggered before the tanks were full. To continue the pressure fueling, a TWA mechanic overrode the automatic VSO by pulling the volumetric fuse and an overflow circuit breaker. Maintenance records indicate that the airplane had numerous VSO-related maintenance writeups in the weeks before the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=National Transportation Safety Board | date=1997-09-30 | title=AIRCRAFT ACCIDENT REPORT: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 Boeing 747-131, N93119 (section 1.6.2)  | url=http://www.airdisaster.com/reports/ntsb/AAR00-03.pdf| format=PDF | accessdate=December 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TWA 800 was scheduled to depart JFK for Paris around 19:00, but the flight was delayed until 20:02
by a disabled piece of ground equipment and a passenger/baggage mismatch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.1&quot;/&gt; After the owner of the baggage in question was confirmed to be on board, the flight crew prepared for departure and the aircraft pushed back from gate 27 at the [[TWA Flight Center]].

TWA 800 then received a series of heading changes and generally increasing altitude assignments as it climbed to its intended cruising altitude.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.2&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=National Transportation Safety Board | year=2000 | title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 | journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 | pages=p.2 | url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weather in the area was light winds with scattered clouds,&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.256&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=National Transportation Safety Board | year=2000 | title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 | journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 | pages=p.256 | url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and there were dusk lighting conditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.4&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=National Transportation Safety Board | year=2000 | title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 | journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 | pages=p.4 | url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last radio transmission from the airplane occurred at 20:30 when the flight crew received and then acknowledged instructions from [[Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center|Boston Air Route Traffic Control Center (ARTCC)]] to climb to {{convert|15000|ft|m}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;CVR Report p.4&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=National Transportation Safety Board | year=2000 | title=Group Chairman's Factual Report of Investigation/Cockpit Voice Recorder | journal=Docket No. SA-516, Exhibit No. 12-A | pages=p.4 | url=http://www.ntsb.gov/events/TWA800/exhibits/Ex_12A.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last recorded radar [[Transponder (aviation)|transponder]] return from the airplane was recorded by the [[Federal Aviation Administration|Federal Aviation Administration (FAA)]] radar site at [[Trevose, Pennsylvania]] at 20:31:12.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.3&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=National Transportation Safety Board | year=2000 | title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 | journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 | pages=p.3 | url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty-eight seconds later, the captain of an [[Eastwind Airlines]] [[Boeing 737]] reported to Boston ARTCC that he &quot;just saw an explosion out here,&quot; adding, &quot;we
just saw an explosion up ahead of us here...about 16,000 feet [4,900m] or something like that, it just went down into the water.&quot; Subsequently, many [[air traffic control]] facilities in the New York/[[Long Island]] area received reports of an explosion from other pilots operating in the area. Many witnesses in the vicinity of the crash stated that they saw or heard explosions, accompanied by a large fireball or fireballs over the ocean, and observed debris, some of which was burning, falling into the water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.3&quot;/&gt;

Although individuals in various civilian, military and police vessels reached the crash site and searched for survivors within minutes of the initial water impact, no survivors were found,&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.86&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=National Transportation Safety Board | year=2000 | title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 | journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 | pages=p.86 | url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; making TWA 800 the second deadliest aircraft accident in the United States at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASN&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Aviation Safety Network | title=ASN Aircraft accident Boeing 747-131 N93119 East Moriches, NY | url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19960717-0 | journal=Aviation Safety Network (Web) | accessdate=January 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial investigation==
The NTSB was notified about 20:50 the day of the accident; a full [[National_Transportation_Safety_Board#Investigations|go-team]] was assembled in Washington, D.C. and arrived on scene early the next morning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.313&quot;/&gt; Meanwhile, initial witness descriptions led many to believe the cause of the crash was a bomb or missile attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN Initial&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=CNN | title=TWA 747 explodes off Long Island | url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9607/17/li.plane/index.11p.html | date=July 17, 1996 | accessdate=January 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT 19Jul96&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Lawrence | last=Malkin | author2=Brian Knowlton | title=No Survivors Among 228 In N.Y.

==Further investigation and analysis==

===Possible causes of the in-flight breakup===
Investigators considered several possible causes for the structural breakup: structural failure and [[Uncontrolled decompression|decompression]], detonation of a high-energy explosive device, such as a missile warhead exploding upon impact with the airplane or bomb exploding inside the airplane, or a fuel/air explosion in the center wing fuel tank.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.256&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.257&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=NTSB AAR-00/03 Final Report |pages=pg.257 |accessdate=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Structural failure and decompression====
Close examination of the wreckage revealed no evidence of structural faults such as [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]], corrosion or mechanical damage that could have caused the in-flight breakup.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.257&quot;/&gt; It was also suggested that the breakup could have been initiated by an in-flight separation of the forward cargo door; however, all evidence indicated that the door was closed and locked at impact.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.257&quot;/&gt; The NTSB concluded that &quot;the in-flight breakup of TWA flight 800 was not initiated by a preexisting condition resulting in a structural failure and decompression.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.257&quot;/&gt;

====Live missile or bomb detonation====
A review of recorded data from long-range and [[airport surveillance radar]]s revealed multiple contacts of airplanes/objects in TWA 800's vicinity at the time of the accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pp.87-89&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=NTSB AAR-00/03 Final Report |pages=pp.87–89 |accessdate=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these contacts intersected TWA 800's position at any time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.89&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=NTSB AAR-00/03 Final Report |pages=pg.89 |accessdate=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attention was drawn to data from the [[Islip (town), New York|Islip, New York]], [[New York Air Route Traffic Control Center|ARTCC facility]] that showed three tracks in the vicinity of TWA 800 that did not appear in any of the other radar data.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.93&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=NTSB AAR-00/03 Final Report |pages=pg.93 |accessdate=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of these sequences intersected TWA 800's position at any time either.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.93&quot;/&gt; All the reviewed radar data showed no radar returns consistent with a missile or other projectile traveling toward TWA 800.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.89&quot;/&gt;

The NTSB addressed allegations that the Islip radar data showed groups of military surface targets converging in a suspicious manner in an area around the accident, and that a 30-knot radar track, never identified and 3&amp;nbsp;nmi from the crash site, was involved in foul play, as evidenced by its failure to divert from its course and assist with the search and rescue operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.93&quot;/&gt; Military records examined by the NTSB showed no military surface vessels within 15&amp;nbsp;nmi of TWA 800 at the time of the accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.93&quot;/&gt; In addition, the records indicated that the closest area scheduled for military use and prohibited to civilian air traffic at the time of the accident, [[military operations area|warning area]] W-387A/B, was 160&amp;nbsp;nmi south.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.93&quot;/&gt;

The NTSB reviewed the 30-knot target track to try to determine why it did not divert from its course and proceed to the area where the TWA 800 wreckage had fallen. TWA 800 was behind the target, and with the likely forward-looking perspective of the target's occupant(s), the occupants would not have been in a position to observe the aircraft's breakup and/or subsequent explosions/fireball(s).&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.94&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=NTSB AAR-00/03 Final Report |pages=pg.94 |accessdate=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, it was unlikely that the occupants of the target track would have been able to hear the explosions over the sound of its engines and the noise of the hull traveling through water, even more so if the occupants were in an enclosed bridge or cabin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.94&quot;/&gt; Further, review of the Islip radar data for other similar summer days and nights in 1999 indicated that the 30-knot track was consistent with normal commercial fishing, recreational, and/or cargo vessel traffic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.94&quot;/&gt;

The NTSB considered the possibility that the explosive residue was due to contamination from the aircraft's use in 1991 transporting troops during the [[Gulf War]] or its use in a dog-training explosive detection exercise about one month before the accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pp.258-259&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=NTSB AAR-00/03 Final Report |pages=pp.258–259 |accessdate=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, testing conducted by the FAA's Technical Center indicated that residues of the type of explosives found on the wreckage would dissipate completely after 2 days of immersion in sea water (almost all recovered wreckage was immersed longer than 2 days).&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.259&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=NTSB AAR-00/03 Final Report |pages=pg.259 |accessdate=January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NTSB concluded that it was &quot;quite possible&quot; that the explosive residue detected was transferred from military ships or ground vehicles, or the clothing and boots of military personnel, onto the wreckage during or after the recovery operation and was not present when the aircraft crashed into the water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.259&quot;/&gt;

Although it was unable to determine the exact source of the trace amounts of explosive residue found on the wreckage, the lack of any other corroborating evidence associated with a high-energy explosion led the NTSB to conclude that &quot;the in-flight breakup of TWA flight 800 was not initiated by a bomb or missile strike.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.259&quot;/&gt;

Because there was no evidence that a high-energy explosive device detonated in this (or any other) area of the airplane, this overpressure event could only have been caused by a fuel/air explosion in the CWT.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.261&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 |pages=pp.261 |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although only a small amount of fuel was present in the CWT of TWA 800,{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} tests recreating the conditions of the flight showed the remaining fuel/air vapor to be flammable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.261&quot;/&gt; A major reason for the flammability of the fuel/air vapor in the CWT of the 747 was the large amount of heat generated and transferred to the CWT by air conditioning packs located directly below the tank;&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.298&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 |pages=pg.298 |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the CWT temperature raised to a sufficient level, a single ignition source could cause an explosion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.298&quot;/&gt;

In order to better determine whether a fuel/air vapor explosion in the CWT would generate sufficient pressure to break apart the fuel tank and lead to the destruction of the airplane, tests were conducted in July and August 1997, using a retired Air France 747 at [[Bruntingthorpe Aerodrome|Bruntingthorpe Airfield]], England. These tests simulated a fuel/air explosion in the CWT by igniting a propane/air mixture; this resulted in the failure of the tank structure due to overpressure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.261&quot;/&gt; While the NTSB acknowledged that the test conditions at Bruntingthorpe were not fully comparable to the conditions that existed on TWA 800 at the time of the accident,&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.261&quot;/&gt; previous fuel explosions in the CWTs of commercial airliners such as [[Avianca Flight 203]] and [[Philippine Airlines Flight 143]] confirmed that a CWT explosion could break apart the fuel tank and lead to the destruction of an airplane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.261&quot;/&gt;

Ultimately, based on &quot;the accident airplane's breakup sequence; wreckage damage characteristics; scientific tests and research on fuels, fuel tank explosions, and the conditions in the CWT at the time of the accident; and analysis of witness information,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.271&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 |pages=pg.271 |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the NTSB concluded that &quot;the TWA flight 800 in-flight breakup was initiated by a fuel/air explosion in the CWT.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.271&quot;/&gt;

Recovery locations of the wreckage from the ocean (the red, yellow, and green zones) clearly indicated that: (1) the red area pieces (from the forward portion of the wing center section and a ring of fuselage directly in front) were the earliest pieces to separate from the airplane; (2) the forward fuselage section departed simultaneously with or shortly after the red area pieces, landing relatively intact in the yellow zone; (3) the green area pieces (wings and the aft portion of the fuselage) remained intact for a period after the separation of the forward fuselage, and impacted the water in the green zone.&lt;ref name=&quot;NTSB Seq pp.3-4&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/events/TWA800/exhibits/Ex_18A.pdf |format=PDF|title=Metallurgy/Structures Group Chairman Factual Report Sequencing Study |journal=Docket No. 5A-516, Exhibit No. 18TWA800A |pages=pp.3–4 |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the investigation progressed, the NTSB decided to form a witness group to more fully address the accounts of witnesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Witness Report pg.7&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/events/TWA800/exhibits/Ex_4A.pdf |format=PDF |title=Witness Group Chairman's Factual Report |journal=Docket No. ?, Exhibit 4-A |pages=pg.7 |accessdate=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; From November 1996, through April 1997, this group reviewed witness documents on loan from the FBI (with personal information redacted), and conducted interviews with crewmembers from a [[New York Air National Guard]] [[HH-60]] helicopter and [[C-130]] airplane, as well as a U.S. Navy [[P-3 Orion|P-3]] airplane that were flying in the vicinity of TWA 800 at the time of the accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;Witness Report pp.7-8&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/events/TWA800/exhibits/Ex_4A.pdf |format=PDF |title=Witness Group Chairman's Factual Report |journal=Docket No. ?, Exhibit 4-A |pages=pp.7–8 |accessdate=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1998, the FBI, having closed its active investigation, agreed to fully release the witness documents to the NTSB.&lt;ref name=&quot;Witness Report pg.10&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/events/TWA800/exhibits/Ex_4A.pdf |format=PDF |title=Witness Group Chairman's Factual Report |journal=Docket No. ?, Exhibit 4-A |pages=pg.10 |accessdate=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With access to these documents no longer controlled by the FBI, the NTSB formed a second witness group to review the documents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Witness Report pg.10&quot;/&gt; Because of the amount of time that had elapsed (about 21 months) before the NTSB received information about the identity of the witnesses, the witness group chose not to re-interview most of the witnesses, but instead to rely on the original FBI documents as the best available evidence of the observations initially reported by the witnesses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.230&quot;/&gt; However, despite the two and a half years that had elapsed since the accident, the witness group did interview the captain of Eastwind Airlines flight 507, who was the first to report the explosion of TWA 800, because of his vantage point and experience as an airline pilot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Witness Report pg.12&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/events/TWA800/exhibits/Ex_4A.pdf |format=PDF |title=Witness Group Chairman's Factual Report |journal=Docket No. ?, Exhibit 4-A |pages=pg.12 |accessdate=January 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NTSB's review of the released witness documents determined that they contained 736 witness accounts, of which 258 were characterized as &quot;streak of light&quot; witnesses (&quot;an object moving in the sky...variously described [as] a point of light, fireworks, a flare, a shooting star, or something similar.&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.230&quot;/&gt; The NTSB Witness Group concluded that the streak of light reported by witnesses might have been the actual airplane during some stage of its flight before the fireball developed, noting that most of the 258 streak of light accounts were generally consistent with the calculated flightpath of the accident airplane after the CWT explosion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report p.262&quot;/&gt;

However, 38 witnesses described a streak of light that ascended vertically, or nearly so, and these accounts &quot;seem[ed] to be inconsistent with the accident airplane's flightpath.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.265&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 |pages=pg.265 |accessdate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, 18 witnesses reported seeing a streak of light that originated at the surface, or the horizon, which did not &quot;appear to be consistent with the airplane's calculated flightpath and other known aspects of the accident sequence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.265&quot;/&gt; Regarding these differing accounts, the NTSB noted that based on their experience in previous investigations &quot;witness reports are often inconsistent with the known facts or with other witnesses' reports of the same events.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.237&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 |pages=pg.237 |accessdate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interviews conducted by the FBI focused on the possibility of a missile attack; suggested interview questions given to FBI agents such as &quot;Where was the sun in relation to the aircraft and the missile launch point?&quot; and &quot;How long did the missile fly?&quot; could have biased interviewees' responses in some cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.266&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 |pages=pg.266 |accessdate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NTSB concluded that given the large number of witnesses in this case, they &quot;did not expect all of the documented witness observations to be consistent with one another.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.269&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 |pages=pg.269 |accessdate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;did not view these apparently anomalous witness reports as persuasive evidence that some witnesses might have observed a missile.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.270&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 |pages=pg.270 |accessdate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After missile visibility tests were conducted in April 2000, at [[Eglin Air Force Base]], [[Fort Walton Beach, Florida]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.254&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 |pages=pg.254 |accessdate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the NTSB determined that if witnesses had observed a missile attack they would have seen: (1) a light from the burning missile motor ascending very rapidly and steeply for about 8 seconds; (2) the light disappearing for up to 7 seconds; (3) upon the missile striking the aircraft and igniting the CWT another light, moving considerably more slowly and more laterally than the first, for about 30 seconds; (4) this light descending while simultaneously developing into a fireball falling toward the ocean.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.270&quot;/&gt; None of the witness documents described such a scenario.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.270&quot;/&gt;

Because of their unique vantage points and/or the level of precision and detail provided in their accounts, five witness accounts generated special interest:&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pp.242-243&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 |pages=pp. 242–243 |accessdate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the pilot of Eastwind Airlines flight 507, the crew members in the HH-60 helicopter, a streak-of-light witness aboard [[US Airways]] flight 217, a land witness on the Beach Lane Bridge in [[Westhampton Beach, New York]] as well as a witness on a boat near Great Gun Beach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pp.243-247&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 |pages=pp. 243–247 |accessdate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advocates of a missile-attack scenario asserted that some of these witnesses observed a missile;&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.264&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 |pages=pg.264 |accessdate=January 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, analysis demonstrated that the observations were not consistent with a missile attack on TWA 800, but instead were consistent with these witnesses having observed some part of the in-flight fire and breakup sequence after the CWT explosion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.264&quot;/&gt;

The NTSB concluded that &quot;the witness observations of a streak of light were not related to a missile and that the streak of light reported by most of these witnesses was burning fuel from the accident airplane in crippled flight during some portion of the post-explosion, preimpact breakup sequence&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.270&quot;/&gt; The NTSB further concluded that &quot;the witnesses' observations of one or more fireballs were of the airplane's burning wreckage falling toward the ocean&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.270&quot;/&gt;

===Possible ignition sources of the center wing fuel tank===
In an attempt to determine what ignited the inflammable fuel/air vapor in the CWT and caused the explosion, the NTSB evaluated numerous potential ignition sources. All but one were considered very unlikely to have been the source of ignition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.279&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 |pages=pg.279 |accessdate=January 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Missile fragment or small explosive charge====
Although the NTSB had already reached the conclusion that a missile strike did not cause the structural failure of the airplane, the possibility that a missile could have exploded close enough to TWA 800 for a missile fragment to have entered the CWT and ignited the fuel/air vapor, yet far enough away not to have left any damage characteristic of a missile strike was considered.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.272&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 |pages=pg.272 |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Computer simulations using missile performance data simulated a missile detonating in a location such that a fragment from the warhead could penetrate the CWT.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.273&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 |pages=pg.273 |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on these simulations the NTSB concluded that it was &quot;very unlikely&quot; that a warhead detonated in such a location where a fragment could penetrate the CWT, but no other fragments impact the surrounding airplane structure leaving distinctive impact marks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.273&quot;/&gt;

Similarly, the investigation considered the possibility that a small explosive charge placed on the CWT could have been the ignition source.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.273&quot;/&gt; Testing by the NTSB and the British [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] demonstrated that when metal of the same type and thickness of the CWT was penetrated by a small charge, there was petalling of the surface where the charge was placed, pitting on the adjacent surfaces, and visible hot gas washing damage in the surrounding area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pp.273-274&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 |pages=pp.273–274 |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since none of the recovered CWT wreckage exhibited these damage characteristics, and none of the areas of missing wreckage were large enough to encompass all the expected damage, the investigation concluded that this scenario was &quot;very unlikely.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.274&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 |pages=pg.274 |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other potential sources====
The NTSB also investigated whether the fuel/air mixture in the CWT could have been ignited by [[lightning strike]], [[meteor strike]], [[auto ignition|auto-ignition]] or hot surface ignition, a fire migrating to the CWT from another fuel tank via the vent system, an uncontained engine failure, a turbine burst in the air conditioning packs beneath the CWT, a malfunctioning CWT jettison/override pump, a malfunctioning CWT scavenger pump, or [[static electricity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pp.272-279&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 |pages=pp.272–279 |accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After analysis the investigation determined that these potential sources were &quot;very unlikely&quot; to have been the source of ignition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.279&quot;/&gt;

====Fuel quantity indication system====
The FAA and airplane manufacturers had assumed that a combustible fuel/air mixture would exist at all times in fuel tanks; consequently, airplane designers attempted to eliminate all possible sources of ignition in the fuel tanks. The primary means of ensuring this were to protect all devices from intrusion of vapor and to keep voltages and currents being used by the Fuel Quantity Indication System (FQIS) very small. In the case of the 747-100 series, the only wiring located inside the CWT was wiring associated with the FQIS.

In order for the FQIS to be the ignition source, a transfer of higher than normal voltage to the FQIS needed to have occurred, as well as some mechanism whereby the excess energy was released by the FQIS wiring into the CWT. While the NTSB determined that factors suggesting the likelihood of a short circuit event existed, they added that &quot;neither the release mechanism nor the location of the ignition inside the CWT could be determined from the available evidence.&quot; Nonetheless, the NTSB concluded that &quot;the ignition energy for the CWT explosion most likely entered the CWT through the FQIS wiring.&quot;

Though the FQIS itself was designed to prevent danger from its normal operation by minimizing voltages and currents, the innermost tube of the FQIS compensator showed damage similar to that of the compensator tube that was the ignition source for the surge tank fire that destroyed a 747 near Madrid in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF|title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=NTSB AAR-00/03 Final Report |pages=293–4 |accessdate=June 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was not considered &quot;proof&quot; of a source of ignition. There was evidence of arcing in a wire bundle that included FQIS wiring that connected with the Center Wing Tank.&lt;ref name=p288&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF|title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=NTSB AAR-00/03 Final Report |pages=288 |accessdate=June 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was also arcing evidenced on two wires sharing a cable raceway with FQIS wiring at station 955.&lt;ref name=p288 /&gt;

The Captain's Cockpit Voice Recorder channel showed two &quot;dropouts&quot; of background power harmonics in the second before the  recording ended (with the separation of the nose).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF|title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=NTSB AAR-00/03 Final Report |pages=289 |accessdate=June 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This might well be the signature of an arc on cockpit wiring adjacent to the FQIS wiring. The captain commented on the &quot;crazy&quot; readings of the number 4 engine fuel flow gauge about 2-1/2 minutes before the CVR recording ended.&lt;ref name=p290&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF|title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=NTSB AAR-00/03 Final Report |pages=290 |accessdate=June 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, the Center Wing Tank fuel quantity gauge was recovered and indicated 640&amp;nbsp;pounds instead of the 300&amp;nbsp;pounds that had been loaded into that tank.&lt;ref name=p290 /&gt; Experiments showed that applying power to a wire leading to the fuel quantity gauge can cause the digital display to change by several hundred pounds before the circuit breaker trips. Thus the gauge anomaly could have been caused by a short to the FQIS wiring.&lt;ref name=p290 /&gt; The NTSB concluded that the most likely source of sufficient voltage to cause ignition was a short from damaged wiring, or within electrical components of the FQIS. As not all components and wiring were recovered, it was not possible to pin-point the source of the necessary voltage.

==Conclusions==
The NTSB investigation ended with the adoption of its final report on August 23, 2000. In it the Board determined that the probable cause of the TWA 800 accident was:&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.308&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 |pages=pg.308 |accessdate=January 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|[An] explosion of the center wing fuel tank (CWT), resulting from ignition of the inflammable fuel/air mixture in the tank. The source of ignition energy for the explosion could not be determined with certainty, but, of the sources evaluated by the investigation, the most likely was a short circuit outside of the CWT that allowed excessive voltage to enter it through electrical wiring associated with the fuel quantity indication system.}}

In addition to the probable cause, the NTSB found the following contributing factors to the accident:&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pg.308&quot;/&gt;

* The design and certification concept that fuel tank explosions could be prevented solely by precluding all ignition sources
* The certification of the Boeing 747 with heat sources located beneath the CWT with no means to reduce the heat transferred into the CWT or to render the fuel tank vapor non-combustible.

During the course of its investigation, and in its final report, the NTSB issued fifteen safety recommendations, mostly covering fuel tank and wiring-related issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Final Report pp.309-312&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://www.ntsb.gov/doclib/reports/2000/AAR0003.pdf |format=PDF |title=Aircraft Accident Report: In-flight Breakup Over the Atlantic Ocean Trans World Airlines Flight 800 |journal=Ntsb/aar-00/03 |pages=pp.309–312 |accessdate=January 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the recommendations was that significant consideration should be given to the development of modifications such as [[Inerting system|nitrogen-inerting systems]] for new airplane designs and, where feasible, for existing airplanes.&lt;ref name=&quot;A-96-174-177&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=National Transportation Safety Board |url=http://ntsb.gov/recs/letters/1996/a96_174_177.pdf |format=PDF |title=National Transportation Safety Board Safety Recommendation |journal=A-96-174-177 |pages=pp.6 |accessdate=January 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alternative theories===
{{Main|TWA Flight 800 alternative theories}}
The NTSB's conclusions about the cause of the TWA 800 disaster took four years and one month to be published. The FBI's earliest investigations and interviews, later used by the NTSB, were performed under the assumption of a missile attack, a fact noted in the NTSB's final report. Six months into the investigation, the NTSB's chairman, Jim Hall, was quoted as saying, &quot;All three theories—a bomb, a missile or mechanical failure—remain.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn01172007&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9701/17/twa/index.html |title=Six months later, still no answer to the TWA Flight 800 mystery |publisher=CNN |date=January 17, 1997 |accessdate=June 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation was fueled in part by early descriptions, visuals, and eyewitness accounts of this jet disaster, including a sudden explosion and trails of fire in the sky; particularly, trails of fire moving in an upward direction.

The two most prevalent specific theories around TWA 800 are that of a terrorist bomb on board, or a missile striking the plane (attributed by some to American armed forces and by others to non-state actors). Those supporting these alternative explanations for the crash typically claim that the NTSB's explanation was created as a cover-up; that the NTSB did not investigate sufficiently; or that the NTSB did not have all the evidence it should have had to reach the correct conclusion.

==Aftermath==
Many users of the Internet responded to the incident. The resulting web traffic set records for Internet activity in 1996. [[CNN]]'s traffic quadrupled to 3.9&amp;nbsp;million hits per day. After the flight crashed, the website of ''[[The New York Times]]'' had its traffic increase to one and one half million hits per day, an increase by half of its previous rate. In 1996 few U.S. government websites were updated daily; the [[United States Navy]]'s website regarding the crash was constantly updated and had detailed information about the salvage of the crash site.&lt;ref&gt;Barboza, David. &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/08/06/nyregion/many-hits-some-misses-the-post-crash-web-rush.html Many Hits, Some Misses: The Post-Crash Web Rush].&quot; ''[[The New York Times]]''.

==International Memorial==

The TWA Flight 800 International Memorial was dedicated in a {{convert|2|acre|m2|sing=on}} parcel immediately adjoining the main pavilion at [[Smith Point County Park]] in [[Shirley, New York]], on July 14, 2004.  Funds for the memorial were raised by the Families of TWA Flight 800 Association. David Busch of Busch Associates PC [[Bay Shore, New York]] designed the memorial. The memorial includes landscaped grounds, flags from the 14 countries of the victims, and a curved black [[granite]] memorial with the names engraved on one side and an illustration on the other of a wave releasing 230 seagulls into the sky. In  July 2006 an abstract design of a {{convert|10|ft|m|sing=on}} high [[lighthouse]] in black [[granite]] designed by Harry Edward Seaman, who had lost his cousin in the crash, was added. The lighthouse sits above a tomb holding many of the victims' personal belongings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Thomas K |url=http://www.newsday.com/news/local/longisland/nyt-800memorial,0,7187445.story?coll=ny_news_local_xpromo |title=Remembering Flight 800 |publisher=Newsday |date=July 18, 2006 |accessdate=June 18, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080519014620/http://www.newsday.com/news/local/longisland/nyt-800memorial,0,7187445.story?coll=ny_news_local_xpromo |archivedate = May 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
