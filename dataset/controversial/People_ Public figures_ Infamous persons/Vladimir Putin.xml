'''Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin''' ({{lang-rus|Влади́мир Влади́мирович Пу́тин|p=vɫɐˈdʲimʲɪr vɫɐˈdʲimʲɪrəvʲɪtɕ ˈputʲɪn|a=Ru-Vladimir_Vladimirovich_Putin.ogg}}; born 7 October 1952) is a [[Russian people|Russian]] [[politician]] who has been the [[President of Russia]] since 7 May 2012 and the [[General Secretary of the United Russia]] since 1 January 2008. Putin previously served as President from 2000 to 2008, and as [[Prime Minister of Russia]] from 1999 to 2000 and again from 2008 to 2012. Putin was also previously the Chairman of [[United Russia]].

For sixteen years Putin was an officer in the [[KGB]], rising to the rank of [[Podpolkovnik|Lieutenant Colonel]], before he retired to enter politics in his native [[Saint Petersburg]] in 1991. He moved to [[Moscow]] in 1996 and joined President [[Boris Yeltsin]]'s administration where he rose quickly, becoming [[Acting President of the Russian Federation|Acting President]] on 31 December 1999 when Yeltsin resigned unexpectedly. Putin won the subsequent [[Russian presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]] and was [[Russian presidential election, 2004|re-elected in 2004]]. Because of [[Constitution of Russia|constitutionally mandated term limits]], Putin was ineligible to run for a third consecutive presidential term in 2008. [[Dmitry Medvedev]] won the [[Russian presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]] and appointed Putin as [[Prime Minister of Russia|Prime Minister]], beginning a period of so-called [[Duumvirate|&quot;tandemocracy&quot;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hale|first=Henry E.|coauthors=Timothy J.

He won the election in March 2012 and will serve an increased, six-year term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20120304/171708401.html Putin Hails Vote Victory, Opponents Cry Foul] [[RIAN]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworldreporter.com/2012/03/elections-in-russia-world-awaits-for.html|title=Elections in Russia: World Awaits for Putin to Reclaim the Kremlin|date=March 2012|publisher=The World Reporter|accessdate=2012-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putin has been widely credited for overseeing a return of political stability and economic progress to Russia, ending the [[History of Russia (1992–present)|crisis of the 1990s]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mcfaul_p72&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=McFaul |first1=Michael |last2=Stoner-Weiss |first2=Kathryn |editor1-first=Stephen |editor1-last=White |title=Developments in Russian Politics 7|year=2010 |publisher=Palgrave McMillan |location=New York |isbn=9780230224490 |chapter=Elections and Voters |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;derpräsident&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Krone-Schmalz|first=Gabriele|title=Was passiert in Russland?|publisher=F.A.

Development under Putin has included the construction of [[pipeline transport|pipeline]]s, the restoration of the [[satellite navigation]] system [[GLONASS]], and the building of infrastructure for international events.

In Russia, Putin's leadership has mostly enjoyed considerable popularity, with generally high approval ratings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levada.ru/indeksy Индексы] levada.ru&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of his actions have been characterised by the domestic opposition as undemocratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Treisman, D|title=Is Russia's Experiment with Democracy Over?|url=http://www.international.ucla.edu/article.asp?parentid=16294|publisher=UCLA International Institute|accessdate=31 Dec. 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western observers and organisations have also voiced criticism of Putin's leadership.

Putin publicly projects an adventurous, [[macho]] image via taking part in unusual or dangerous activities; some of these [[publicity stunt]]s have occasionally been criticised. A keen practitioner of [[martial arts]], Putin has played a major role in the development of [[sport in Russia]], notably, helping [[Sochi]] to win the bid for the [[2014 Winter Olympics]].

==Ancestry, early life and education==
[[File:Vladimir Putin with his mother.jpg|thumb|Putin with his mother, Maria Ivanovna, in July 1958]]
Putin was born on October 7, 1952, in [[Leningrad]], [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]] (now [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia|Russian Federation]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://premier.gov.ru/eng/premier/biography.html Biography at the Russia's Prime Minister web site], in Russian&lt;/ref&gt; to parents Vladimir Spiridonovich Putin (1911–1999) and Maria Ivanovna Putina (1911–1998). His mother was a factory worker, and his father was a [[conscription|conscript]] in the [[Soviet Navy]], where he served in the [[submarine]] fleet in the early 1930s.&lt;ref name=first-person&gt;{{cite book|title=First Person|coauthors=Vladimir Putin, Nataliya Gevorkyan, Natalya Timakova, Andrei Kolesnikov|others=trans. Catherine A. Fitzpatrick|year=2000|publisher=[[PublicAffairs]]|page=208|isbn=978-1-58648-018-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two elder brothers were born in the mid-1930s; one died within a few months of birth, while the second succumbed to [[diphtheria]] during the [[siege of Leningrad]] in World War II.

Vladimir Putin's paternal grandfather, Spiridon Ivanovich Putin (1879–1965), was employed at [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[dacha]] at [[Gorki Leninskiye|Gorki]] as a cook, and after Lenin's death in 1924, he continued to work for Lenin's wife, [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]]. He would later cook for [[Joseph Stalin]] when the [[Soviet leader]] visited one of his [[dachas]] in the [[Moscow]] region. Spiridon later was employed at a dacha belonging to the Moscow City Committee of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], at which the young Putin would visit him.&lt;ref name=sakwa_p2&gt;{{harv|Sakwa|2008|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ancestry of Vladimir Putin has been described as a mystery with no records surviving of any ancestors of any people with the surname &quot;Putin&quot; beyond his grandfather Spiridon Ivanovich. It has been suggested that the Putins are descended from the royal [[Grand Prince of Tver|Tverskoy]] family. The 'family book' of the [[Tver]] region where Spiridon was from mentions the name of ''Putyanin'' who it claims were a clan of Russian aristocrats descended from [[Mikhail of Tver]], the [[Grand Prince]] of [[Tver]] in the [[Middle Ages]]. It became common practice for family names associated with the former aristocracy to be abbreviated, e.g. [[Repnin]] becoming &quot;Pnin&quot; and, perhaps, Putyanin becoming &quot;Putin&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.pravda.ru/business/finance/05-11-2002/1528-putin-0/ Pravda, English Edition, 05.11.2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

His autobiography, ''Ot Pervogo Litsa'' (English: ''In the First Person''),&lt;ref name=first-person/&gt; which is based on Putin's interviews, speaks of humble beginnings, including early years in a communal apartment in Leningrad. On 1 September 1960, he started at School No. 193 at Baskov Lane, just across from his house. By fifth grade he was one of a few in a class of more than 45 pupils who was not yet a member of the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union|Pioneers]], largely because of his rowdy behavior. In sixth grade he started taking sport seriously in the form of [[sambo (martial art)|sambo]] and then [[judo]]. In his youth, Putin was eager to emulate the intelligence officer characters played on the [[Cinema of the Soviet Union|Soviet screen]] by actors such as [[Vyacheslav Tikhonov]] and [[Georgiy Zhzhonov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russia.rin.ru/guides_e/2637.html|title=Prime Minister|publisher=Russia.rin.ru|accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putin graduated from the International Law branch of the Law Department of the [[Saint Petersburg State University|Leningrad State University]] in 1975, writing his final thesis on [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;theme: {{lang-ru|«Принцип наиболее благоприятствуемой нации»}}[http://old.jurfak.spb.ru/student/graduate/default.asp?now=1975 Выпускники за 1975 год.] [[Saint Petersburg State University]]'s website. (&quot;The principle of [[most favoured nation|most favored nation]]&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt; His PhD thesis was titled &quot;The Strategic Planning of Regional Resources Under the Formation of Market Relations&quot; and it argued that Russian economic success would depend on creating national energy champions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/137615/ahmed-mehdi/putins-gazprom-problem |last= Mehdi |first= Ahmed |date= 6 May 2012 |title= Putin's Gazprom Problem |publisher= [[Foreign Affairs|ForeignAffairs.com]] |accessdate= 11 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While at university he became a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], and remained a member until the party was dissolved in December 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Владимир Путин. ''От Первого Лица''. [http://www.kremlin.ru/articles/bookchapter6.shtml Chapter 6]&lt;/ref&gt; Also at the University he met [[Anatoly Sobchak]] who later played an important role in Putin's career. Anatoly Sobchak was at the time an [[Assistant Professor]] and lectured Putin's class on [[Business Law]] (khozyaystvennoye pravo).&lt;ref name=Vlast&gt;{{cite book|last=Pribylovsky|first=Vladimir|title=Власть-2010 (60 биографий)|year=2010|publisher=Panorama|isbn=978-5-94420-038-9|pages=132–139|url=http://scilla.ru/works/knigi/vlast2010.pdf|authorlink=Vladimir Pribylovsky|location=Moscow|language=Russian|chapter=Valdimir Putin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==KGB career==
[[File:Vladimir Putin in KGB uniform.jpg|thumb|150px|Putin in [[KGB]] uniform]]

Putin joined the [[KGB]] in 1975 upon graduation, and underwent a year's training at the 401st KGB school in [[Okhta]], Leningrad. He then went on to work briefly in the Second Chief Directorate ([[counter-intelligence]]) before he was transferred to the [[First Chief Directorate]], where among his duties was the monitoring of foreigners and consular officials in Leningrad.&lt;ref name=sakwa_pp8-9&gt;{{harv|Sakwa|2008|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hoffman&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Hoffman|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/russiagov/putin.htm|title=Putin's Career Rooted in Russia's KGB|publisher=The Washington Post|date=2000-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==

===Saint Petersburg administration===
In May 1990, Putin was appointed Mayor Sobchak's advisor on international affairs. On 28 June 1991, he was appointed head of the [http://web.archive.org/web/20070221044544/http://kvs.spb.ru/en/ Committee for External Relations] of the [[Saint Petersburg City Administration|Saint Petersburg Mayor's Office]], with responsibility for promoting international relations and foreign investments. The Committee also registered business ventures in Saint Petersburg. Less than one year later, Putin was investigated by a commission of the city legislative council. Commission deputies [[Marina Salye]] and [[Yury Gladkov]] concluded that Putin understated prices and permitted the export of metals valued at $93 million, in exchange for foreign food aid that never arrived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sptimes.ru/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=1124|title=Uproar At Honor For Putin|last=Kovalev|first=Vladimir|date=2004-07-23|publisher=The Saint Petersburg Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/russiagov/putin.htm|title=Putin's Career Rooted in Russia's KGB|last=Hoffman|first=David|date=2000-01-30|publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the commission's recommendation that Putin be fired, Putin remained head of the Committee for External Relations until 1996.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070927010325/http://www.rusnet.nl/news/2003/05/19/print/report03.shtml Putin's Name Surfaces in German Probe] by Catherine Belton&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/magazine/story/0,11913,1157033,00.html The Man Who Wasn't There] by Nick Paton Walsh. The Observer, 29 February 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1994 to 1997, Putin was appointed to other positions in Saint Petersburg. In March 1994, he became first deputy head of the city administration. From 1995 through June 1997, he led the Saint Petersburg branch of the pro-government [[Our Home Is Russia]] political party.&lt;ref name=30bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gazeta.lenta.ru/daynews/09-08-1999/30bio.htm|title=Владимир Путин: от ассистента Собчака до и.о. премьера|publisher=GAZETA.RU|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1995 through June 1997 he was also the head of the Advisory Board of the JSC Newspaper [[Sankt-Peterburgskie Vedomosti]].&lt;ref name=30bio/&gt;

===Moscow career===
[[File:RIAN archive 100306 Vladimir Putin, Federal Security Service Director.jpg|thumb|150px|Putin as [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]] director, 1998]]
In 1996, [[Anatoly Sobchak]] lost the Saint Petersburg mayoral election to [[Vladimir Anatolyevich Yakovlev|Vladimir Yakovlev]]. Putin was called to Moscow and in June 1996 became a Deputy Chief of the Presidential Property Management Department headed by [[Pavel Borodin]]. He occupied this position until March 1997. During his tenure Putin was responsible for the foreign property of the state and organized transfer of the former assets of the Soviet Union and [[CPSU|Communist Party]] to the Russian Federation.&lt;ref name=Vlast/&gt;

On 26 March 1997, President [[Boris Yeltsin]] appointed Putin deputy chief of [[Russian presidential administration|Presidential Staff]], which he remained until May 1998, and chief of the Main Control Directorate of the Presidential Property Management Department (until June 1998). His predecessor on this position was [[Alexei Kudrin]] and the successor was [[Nikolai Patrushev]], both future prominent politicians and Putin's associates.&lt;ref name=Vlast/&gt;

On 27 June 1997, at the [[Saint Petersburg Mining Institute]], guided by rector [[Vladimir Litvinenko]], Putin defended his [[Candidate of Science]] dissertation in economics, titled &quot;The Strategic Planning of Regional Resources Under the Formation of Market Relations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zavtra.ru/cgi/veil/data/zavtra/00/338/32.html|title=ПУТИН&amp;nbsp;— КАНДИДАТ НАУК|date=2000-05-24|publisher=zavtra.ru|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Putin later became president, the dissertation became a target of [[List_of_plagiarism_incidents#Vladimir_Putin|plagiarism accusations]] by fellows at the [[Brookings Institution]]; though the allegedly plagiarised study was referenced to&lt;ref name=cdi.org&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.org/russia/johnson/2006-78-3a.cfm|title=It All Boils Down to Plagiarism|publisher=Cdi.org|date=2006-03-31|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kommersant-dissertation&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kommersant.com/pda/doc.asp?id=662935|title=The President as Candidate|authors=Maxim Shishkin, Dmitry Butrin; Mikhail Shevchuk|newspaper=Kommersant|accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the authors of the allegation felt sure it constituted plagiarism, though they were unsure as to whether it was &quot;intentional&quot;;&lt;ref name=cdi.org/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brookings Senior Fellow Clifford Gaddy: &quot;The dissertation itself has something like 180 pages of text.…About 16 pages of text come straight out of King and Cleland, with no footnotes, no quotation marks, and never in the text are the names King and Cleland ever mentioned. Moreover, this material that comes directly from King and Cleland is from the very first sentence of chapter two, the chapter on strategic planning, taken straight from the book. So there’s no original introduction by Mr. Putin that then gets into this. So clearly the reader assumes these are the thoughts, the ideas of the author of the dissertation. Speaking as a professor, you can’t do this; this is not the way you do it. This is plagiarism. If you want to include this much of a work, which is probably too much under any circumstances, you must put quotation marks around it, you must acknowledge that these authors did all this thinking. These are elementary steps that you must take. But it wasn’t done. So I think this would classify as plagiarism at any university around the world that’s adhering to international standards, commonly accepted standards. It’s definitely plagiarism. The next question of course is: was it intentional plagiarism, or what was it all about? And that’s always the question with plagiarism. In this case, I don’t think it was really intentional in the sense that if you had wanted to hide where the text came from you wouldn’t even list this work in the bibliography.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; the dissertation committee denied the accusations.&lt;ref name=kommersant-dissertation/&gt; In his dissertation,{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} and in a later article published in 1999, Putin advocated the idea of so-called [[National champions]], a concept that would later become central to his political thinking.

On 25 May 1998, Putin was appointed First Deputy Chief of [[Russian presidential administration|Presidential Staff]] for regions, replacing [[Viktoriya Mitina]]; and, on 15 July, the Head of the Commission for the preparation of agreements on the [[delimitation]] of power of regions and the federal center attached to the President, replacing [[Sergey Shakhray]]. After Putin's appointment, the commission completed no such agreements, although during Shakhray's term as the Head of the Commission there were 46 agreements signed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itogi.ru/Paper2006.nsf/Article/Itogi_2006_11_19_01_5543.html The Half-Decay Products] (in Russian) by Oleg Odnokolenko. Itogi, #47(545), 2.01.2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, after becoming President Putin canceled all those agreements.&lt;ref name=Vlast/&gt;

On 25 July 1998, Yeltsin appointed Vladimir Putin head of the [[Federalnaya Sluzhba Bezopasnosti|FSB]] (one of the successor agencies to the KGB), the position Putin occupied until August 1999. He became a permanent member of the [[Security Council of the Russian Federation]] on 1 October 1998 and its Secretary on 29 March 1999.

==First Premiership (1999–2000)==
On 9 August 1999, Vladimir Putin was appointed one of three First Deputy Prime Ministers, which enabled him later on that day, as the previous government led by [[Sergei Stepashin]] had been sacked, to be appointed acting Prime Minister of the Government of the Russian Federation by President [[Boris Yeltsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news..co.uk/1/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/415278.stm|title=Text of Yeltsin's speech in English|accessdate=2007-05-31|date=1999-08-09|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeltsin also announced that he wanted to see Putin as his successor. Later, that same day, Putin agreed to run for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/415087.stm Yeltsin redraws political map] BBC, 10 August 1999&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 August, the [[State Duma]] approved his appointment as Prime Minister with 233 votes in favour (vs. 84 against, 17 abstained),&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/422001.stm Yeltsin's man wins approval] BBC, 16 August 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; while a simple majority of 226 was required, making him Russia's fifth PM in fewer than eighteen months. On his appointment, few expected Putin, virtually unknown to the general public, to last any longer than his predecessors. He was initially regarded as a Yeltsin loyalist; like other prime ministers of Boris Yeltsin, Putin did not choose ministers himself, his cabinet being determined by the presidential administration.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Sakwa ''Putin: Russia's choice'', 2008. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeltsin's main opponents and would-be successors, Moscow Mayor [[Yuriy Luzhkov]] and former Chairman of the Russian Government [[Yevgeniy Primakov]], were already campaigning to replace the ailing president, and they fought hard to prevent Putin's emergence as a potential successor. Putin's [[law and order (politics)|law-and-order]] image and his unrelenting approach to the [[Second Chechen War|renewed crisis in the North Caucasus]], which started when the [[Islamic International Brigade]] based in Chechnya invaded a neighboring region starting the [[War in Dagestan]], soon combined to raise Putin's popularity and allowed him to overtake all rivals.

While not formally associated with any party, Putin pledged his support to the newly formed [[Unity Party of Russia|Unity Party]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nupi.no/cgi-win/Russland/polgrupp.exe?Unity Political groups and parties: Unity] Norsk Utenrikspolitisk Institutt&lt;/ref&gt; which won the second largest percentage of the popular vote (23.3%) in the December 1999 [[Duma]] elections, and in turn he was supported by it.

===Acting Presidency===
[[File:Putin in Su-27-1.jpg|thumb|Putin landing in Grozny in a [[Su-27]] fighter jet (20 March 2000)]]
On 31 December 1999, Yeltsin unexpectedly resigned and, according to the constitution, Putin became [[Acting President of the Russian Federation]]. On assuming this role, Putin went on a previously scheduled visit to Russian troops in Chechnya.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}

The first [[Decree of the President of Russia|Presidential Decree]] that Putin signed, on 31 December 1999, was titled &quot;On guarantees for former president of the Russian Federation and members of his family&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rg.ru/oficial/doc/ykazi/1763.htm УКАЗ от 31 декабря 1999 г. № 1763 ''О ГАРАНТИЯХ ПРЕЗИДЕНТУ РОССИЙСКОЙ ФЕДЕРАЦИИ, ПРЕКРАТИВШЕМУ ИСПОЛНЕНИЕ СВОИХ ПОЛНОМОЧИЙ, И ЧЛЕНАМ ЕГО СЕМЬИ''.] [[Rossiyskaya Gazeta]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newizv.ru/politics/2004-03-18/5273-razvrashenie-pervogo-lica.html «Развращение» первого лица.

While his opponents had been preparing for an election in June 2000, Yeltsin's resignation resulted in the [[Russian presidential election, 2000|Presidential elections]] being held within three months, on 26 March 2000; Putin won in the first round with 53% of the vote.&lt;ref name=elections-history&gt;[http://www.ria.ru/vybor2012_infographics/20120309/590825026.html History of Presidential Elections in Russia: Infographics] [[RIAN]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==First Presidency (2000–2004)==
Vladimir Putin was inaugurated president on 7 May 2000. He appointed [[Minister of Finance (Russia)|Minister of Finance]] [[Mikhail Kasyanov]] as his Prime minister. Having announced his intention to consolidate power in the country into a strict vertical, in May 2000 he issued a decree dividing 89 [[federal subjects of Russia]] between 7 [[federal districts of Russia|federal districts]] overseen by representatives of his in order to facilitate federal administration.

During his first term in office, he moved to curb the political ambitions of some of the Yeltsin-era ''[[business oligarchs|oligarchs]]'' such as former Kremlin insider [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]], who had &quot;helped Mr. Putin enter the family, and funded the party that formed Mr. Putin's parliamentary base&quot;, according to BBC profile.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6708103.stm Profile: Boris Berezovsky] [[BBC]] Retrieved on 1 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/russia/article/0,,1655229,00.html What a carve-up!] [[The Guardian]] Retrieved on 28 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, according to [[Vladimir Solovyov (journalist)|Vladimir Solovyev]], it was [[Alexey Kudrin]] who was instrumental in Putin's assignment to the [[Presidential Administration of Russia]] to work with [[Pavel Borodin]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Solovyov (journalist)|Solovyev V.

Путеводитель для неравнодушных.&quot; 2008.)&lt;/ref&gt; and according to Solovyev, Berezovsky was proposing [[Igor Ivanov]] rather than Putin as a new president.&lt;ref&gt;[[Vladimir Solovyov (journalist)|Solovyev]] 2008, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Fisher Investments on Emerging Markets''
 By Austin B. Fraser,  ([[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], 2009), page 92&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 2000-2004, and ending following the Yukos-affair, Putin apparently won a power-struggle with the oligarchs, reaching a 'grand-bargain' with them. This bargain allowed the oligarchs to maintain most of their powers, in exchange for their explicit support - and alignment with - his government.&lt;ref&gt;''Putin: Russia's Choice'', By Richard Sakwa, (Routledge, 2008) page 143-150&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Playing Russian Roulette: Putin in search of good governance'', by Andre Mommen, in ''Good Governance in the Era of Global Neoliberalism: Conflict and Depolitisation in Latin America, Eastern Europe, Asia, and Africa'', By Jolle Demmers, Alex E. Fernández Jilberto, Barbara Hogenboom (Routledge, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; 

A new [[Political groups during Vladimir Putin's presidency|group of business magnates]], such as [[Gennady Timchenko]], [[Vladimir Yakunin]], [[Yuriy Kovalchuk]], [[Sergey Chemezov]], with close personal ties to Putin, also emerged.

Russia's legal reform continued productively during Putin's first term. In particular, Putin succeeded in the codification of land law and tax law, where progress had been slow during Yeltsin's administration, because of Communist and oligarch opposition, respectively. Other legal reforms included new codes on labour, administrative, criminal, commercial and civil procedural law, as well as a major statute on the Bar.&lt;ref name=sharlet/&gt;

The first major challenge to Putin's popularity came in August 2000, when he was criticised for his alleged mishandling of the [[Russian submarine Kursk explosion|''Kursk'' submarine disaster]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1487112.stm Spectre of Kursk haunts Putin], [[BBC News]], 12 August 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2000, Putin sanctioned the law to change the [[National Anthem of Russia]]. At the time the Anthem had music by [[Mikhail Glinka|Glinka]] and no words. The change was to restore (with a minor modification) the music of the post-1944 [[Soviet anthem]] by [[Alexander Vasilyevich Alexandrov|Alexandrov]], while the new text was composed by [[Sergey Mikhalkov]], who previously had authored the lyrics of the two versions of the Soviet anthem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/europe/12/08/russia.anthem/ Duma approves old Soviet anthem] CNN, 8 December 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statesymbol.ru/russymbols/symbols/20050407/39593449.html National anthem of Russian Federation], StateSymbol.Ru&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vladimir Putin with Pope John Paul II-1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Putin with [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] at [[Vatican City]] (5 June 2000)]]

Many in the Russian press and in the international media warned that the death of some 130 hostages in the special forces' rescue operation during the 2002 [[Moscow theater hostage crisis]] would severely damage President Putin's popularity. However, shortly after the siege had ended, the Russian president was enjoying record public approval ratings – 83% of Russians declared themselves satisfied with Putin and his handling of the siege.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2565585.stm Moscow siege leaves dark memories], [[BBC News]], 16 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

A few months before the elections, Putin fired Kasyanov's cabinet and appointed [[Mikhail Fradkov]] to his place. [[Sergei Ivanov|Sergey Ivanov]] became the first civilian in Russia to take Defense Minister position.

In 2003, a referendum was held in Chechnya adopting a new constitution which declares the Republic as a part of Russia. Chechnya has been gradually stabilized with the establishment of the parliamentary elections and a regional government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article2331993.ece Can Grozny be groovy?] by [[The Independent]], 13 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20061121224006/http://www.hrw.org/campaigns/russia/chechnya/ Human Rights Watch Reports], on human rights abuses in Chechnya.

The [[Beslan school hostage crisis]] took place in September 2004, in which hundreds died. Among the administrative measures taken after that terrorist act, Putin launched an initiative to replace the direct election of the Governors and Presidents of the [[Federal subjects of Russia]] with a system whereby they would be nominated by the President and approved or disapproved by regional [[legislature]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Dov (2005).

The continued criminal prosecution of Russia's then richest man, President of [[YUKOS]] company [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]], for fraud and [[tax evasion]] was seen by the international press as a retaliation for Khodorkovsky's donations to both liberal and communist opponents of the Kremlin. The government said that Khodorkovsky was corrupting a large segment of the Duma to prevent tax code changes such as taxes on windfall profits and closing [[tax haven|offshore tax evasion vehicles]]. Khodorkovsky was arrested, Yukos was bunkrupted and the company's assets were auctioned at below-market value, with the largest share acquired by the state company [[Rosneft]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/opinion/article/how-to-steal-legally/302115.html How to Steal Legally] ''[[The Moscow Times]]'', 15 February 2008 (issue 3843, page 8).&lt;/ref&gt; The fate of Yukos was seen in the West as a sign of a broader shift of Russia towards a system of [[state capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/comment/gvosdev200311050739.asp ''Putin’s Gamble.

Putin was criticized in the West and also by Russian liberals for what many observers considered a wide-scale crackdown on [[media freedom in Russia]]. On 7 October 2006, [[Anna Politkovskaya]], a journalist who exposed corruption in the [[Russian Ground Forces|Russian army]] and its conduct in [[Chechnya]], was shot in the lobby of her apartment building. The death of Politkovskaya triggered an outcry in Western media, with accusations that, at best, Putin has failed to protect the country's new independent media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comment.independent.co.uk/columnists_m_z/joan_smith/article1822204.ece Putin's Russia failed to protect this brave woman], Joan Smith.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/10/09/1358259 Anna Politkovskaya, Prominent Russian Journalist, Putin Critic and Human Rights Activist, Murdered in Moscow], Democracy Now&lt;/ref&gt; When asked about the Politkovskaya murder in his interview with the German TV channel [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]], Putin said that her murder brings much more harm to the Russian authorities than her writing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://president.kremlin.ru/appears/2006/10/10/2300_type63379_112351.shtml Answers on questions asked during interview] to [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] TV channel (Germany), [[Dresden]], 10 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012 the performers of the murder were arrested and named [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]] and [[Akhmed Zakayev]] as a possible clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itar-tass.com/en/c142/354859.html |title=The accused of murder of Anna Politkovskaya name possible clients |language={{ru icon}} |publisher=Itar-tass.com |date=2012-02-29 |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 September 2007, Putin dissolved the government upon the request of Prime Minister [[Mikhail Fradkov]]. Fradkov commented that it was to give the President a &quot;free hand&quot; in the run-up to the parliamentary election. [[Viktor Zubkov]] was appointed the new prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,296505,00.html|title=Putin Dissolves Government, Nominates Viktor Zubkov as New Prime Minister|publisher=Foxnews.com|date=2007-09-12|accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second Premiership (2008–2012)==
{{Main|Vladimir Putin's Second Cabinet}}
[[File:Vladimir Putin 11 March 2008-1.jpg|thumb|Vladimir Putin with [[Dmitry Medvedev]]]]
Putin was barred from a third term by the Constitution. First Deputy Prime Minister [[Dmitry Medvedev]] was elected his successor. On 8 May 2008, only a day after handing the presidency to Medvedev, Putin was appointed [[Prime Minister of Russia]], maintaining his political dominance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/09/world/europe/09russia.html Putin Is Approved as Prime Minister] nytimes.com, 9 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2009 economic crisis|2008-2009 world crisis]] hit the Russian economy [[2008 Russian financial crisis|especially hard]], interrupting the flow of cheap Western credit and investments. This coincided with tension in relationships with the [[European Union|EU]] and the [[U.S.]] following the [[2008 South Ossetia war]], in which Russia defeated the U.S. and [[NATO]] ally [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].

However, the large financial reserves, accumulated in the [[Stabilization Fund of Russia]] in the previous period of high oil prices, alongside the strong management helped the country to cope with the crisis and resume economic growth since mid-2009. The Russian government's anti-crisis measures have been praised by the [[World Bank]], which said in its Russia Economic Report from November 2008: &quot;prudent fiscal management and substantial financial reserves have protected Russia from deeper consequences of this external shock. The government's policy response so far—swift, comprehensive, and coordinated—has helped limit the impact.&quot;&lt;ref name=worldbankreports&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/ECAEXT/RUSSIANFEDERATIONEXTN/0,,contentMDK:20888536~menuPK:2445695~pagePK:1497618~piPK:217854~theSitePK:305600,00.html|title=Russian Economic Reports|publisher=Web.worldbank.org|date=2009-11-10|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putin himself named the overcoming of consequences of the world economic crisis one of the two main achievements of his 2nd Premiership&lt;ref name=bbc-demography/&gt; (the other named achievement being the [[Demographics of Russia|stabilisation of the size of Russia's population]] between 2008-2011 following the long period of demographic collapse started in the 1990s).&lt;ref name=bbc-demography/&gt;

At the [[United Russia]] Congress in [[Moscow]] on 24 September 2011, Medvedev officially proposed that Putin stand for the Presidency in 2012; an offer which Putin accepted. Given United Russia's near-total dominance of Russian politics, many observers believed that Putin was all but assured of a third term. The move was expected to see Medvedev stand on the United Russia ticket in the parliamentary elections in December, with a goal of becoming Prime Minister at the end of his presidential term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15045816|title=Russia's Putin set to return as president in 2012|date=24 September 2011|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2011|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Russian legislative election, 2011|parliamentary elections]] on 4 December 2011, tens of thousands Russians engaged in [[2011 Russian protests|protests]] against alleged electoral fraud, the largest protests in Putin's time; protesters criticized Putin and [[United Russia]] and demanded annulment of the election results.&lt;ref name=GuardLive&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/global/2011/dec/10/russia-elections-putin-protest ''Russian election protests – follow live updates''], Guardian, retrieved 10 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However, those protests, organized by the leaders of the Russian &quot;non-systemic opposition&quot;, sparked the fear of a [[colour revolution]] in society, and a number of &quot;anti-Orange&quot; counter-protests (the name alludes to the [[Orange Revolution]] in [[Ukraine]]) and rallies of Putin supporters were carried out, surpassing in scale the opposition protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politonline.ru/comments/10432.html Как митинг на Поклонной собрал около 140 000 человек] politonline.ru {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rian-manezhnaya/&gt;&lt;ref name=rian-luzhniki/&gt;

On 4 March 2012, Putin won the [[Russian presidential election, 2012|2012 Russian presidential elections]] in the first round, with 63.6% of the vote.&lt;ref name=elections-history/&gt; While extraordinary measures were taken to make the elections transparent, including the usage of [[webcam]]s on the vast majority of polling stations, the vote was criticized by Russian opposition and some international bodies for perceived irregularities.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}.

==Policies==

===Domestic policies===
{{see also|Sovereign democracy|Putinism}}
Putin's domestic policies, especially early in his first presidency, were aimed at creating a strict &quot;vertical of power&quot;. On 13 May 2000, he issued a decree dividing the 89 [[federal subjects of Russia]] between 7 [[Federal districts of Russia|federal districts]] overseen by representatives named by himself in order to facilitate federal administration. Putin also pursued a policy of enlargement of federal subjects: their number was reduced from 89 in 2000 to the present 83 after the [[autonomous okrugs of Russia]] were merged with their parent subjects.

[[File:Map of Russian districts, 2010-01-19.svg|350px|thumb|On 13 May 2000, Putin divided Russia into 7 [[Federal districts of Russia|federal districts]]. On 19 January 2010, the new 8th North Caucasian Federal District (shown here in purple) was split from Southern Federal District.]]
According to Stephen White, Russia under the presidency of Putin made it clear that it had no intention of establishing a &quot;second edition&quot; of the American or British political system, but rather a system that was closer to Russia's own traditions and circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Stephen|editor1-first=Stephen|editor1-last=White|title=Developments in Russian Politics 7|year=2010|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|location=New York|isbn=978-0-230-22449-0|chapter=Classifying Russia's Politics}}&lt;/ref&gt; Putin's administration has often been described as a &quot;[[sovereign democracy]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. Sakwa, ''Putin: Russia's Choice'', 2008, p. 42-43&lt;/ref&gt; First proposed by [[Vladislav Surkov]] in February 2006, the term quickly gained currency within Russia and arguably unified various political elites around it. According to its proponents, the government's actions and policies ought above all to enjoy popular support within Russia itself and not be determined from outside the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20061208020210/http://www.edinros.ru/news.html?id=111148 Sovereignty is a Political Synonym of Competitiveness] [[Vladislav Surkov]], public appearance, 7 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20061105125847/http://www.edinros.ru/news.html?id=114108 Our Russian Model of Democracy is Titled «Sovereign Democracy»] [[Vladislav Surkov]], briefing, 28 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2000, according to a law proposed by him and approved by the [[Federal Assembly of Russia]], Putin gained the right to dismiss heads of the federal subjects. In 2004, the direct election of governors by popular vote was ended. This was seen by Putin as a necessary move to stop separatist tendencies and get rid of those governors who were connected with organised crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radiovesti.ru/articles/2011-12-15/fm/24575 |title='&amp;#39;Президентское фильтрование'&amp;#39; губернаторов оценили политики |publisher=Radiovesti.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measure proved to be temporary: in 2012, as proposed by Putin's successor Dmitry Medvedev, the direct election of governors was re-introduced.&lt;ref name=liberal-reforms&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20120228/171592651.html |title=State Duma Approves Liberal Political Reforms |publisher=En.rian.ru |date=2012-02-28 |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with the return of elected governors, Medvedev's reforms also simplified the registration of political parties and reduced the number of signatures required by non-parliamentary parties and independent candidates to participate in elections,&lt;ref name=liberal-reforms/&gt; thus reverting or further loosening the restrictions imposed by previous Putin-endorsed legislation. Notably, the tough electoral legislation has been among the government actions effected under Putin's presidency that have been criticised by many independent Russian media outlets and Western commentators as anti-democratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kramer|first=Andrew E.|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/world/europe/22russia.html?pagewanted=print|title=50% Good News Is the Bad News in Russian Radio|location=Russia|publisher=Nytimes.com|date=2007-04-22|accessdate=2011-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Masha&amp;nbsp;Lipman, Anders&amp;nbsp;Aslund|url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/events/index.cfm?fa=eventDetail&amp;id=745|title=Russian Media Criticism of Vladimir Putin: Evidence and Significance|publisher=Carnegieendowment.org|date=2004-12-02|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his first term in office, Putin moved to curb the political ambitions of some of the Yeltsin-era [[business oligarchs|oligarchs]], resulting in the exile or imprisonment of such people as [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]], [[Vladimir Gusinsky]], [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]]; other oligarchs soon joined Putin's camp.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

Putin presided over an intensified fight with [[Crime in Russia|organised crime]] and [[terrorism]] that resulted in two times lower murder rates by 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/2011/0453/barom02.php |title=Несмотря на двукратное снижение числа убийств, на фоне европейских показателей оно остается крайне высоким |publisher=Demoscope.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as significant reduction in the numbers of terrorist acts by the late 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.finmarket.ru/z/nws/hn.asp?id=722215&amp;nt=0&amp;p=2&amp;sec=0 |title=МВД рапортует: количество терактов снизилось в 15 раз |publisher=Finmarket.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putin succeeded in codifying land law and tax law and promulgated new codes on labour, administrative, criminal, commercial and civil procedural law.&lt;ref name=sharlet/&gt; Under Medvedev's presidency, Putin's government implemented some key reforms in the area of state security, the [[Russian police reform]] and the [[Russian military reform]].

A central concept in Putin's economic thinking was the creation of so-called [[National champions]], vertically integrated companies in strategic sectors that are expected not only to seek profit, but also to &quot;advance the interests of the nation&quot;. Examples of such companies include [[Gazprom]], [[Rosneft]] and [[United Aircraft Corporation]].&lt;ref name=marshall&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldman|first=Marshall I.|title=Petrostate: Putin, Power and the New Russia|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|chapter=Chapter 5|isbn=978-0-19-534073-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the Putin era, in 1998, over 60% of industrial turnover in Russia was based on barter and various monetary surrogates. The use of such alternatives to money has now fallen out of favour, boosting economic productivity significantly. Besides raising wages and consumption, Putin's government has received broad praise also for eliminating this problem.&lt;ref name=challenges_of_medv_era&gt;Iikka. Korhonen ''et al.''

Bank of Finland's Institute for Economies in Transition, 24 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some oil revenue went to the [[Stabilization Fund of the Russian Federation|stabilization fund]] established in 2004. The fund accumulated oil revenue, allowing Russia to repay all of the Soviet Union's debts by 2005. In early 2008, it was split into the Reserve Fund (designed to protect Russia from possible global financial shocks) and the National Welfare Fund, whose revenues will be used for a pension reform.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt;

[[Inflation]] remained a problem however, as between 1999–2007 it was kept at the forecast ceiling only twice, and in 2007 the inflation exceeded that of 2006, continuing an upward trend at the beginning of 2008.&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; The Russian economy is still commodity-driven despite its growth. Payments from the fuel and energy sector in the form of customs duties and taxes accounted for nearly half of the federal budget's revenues. The large majority of Russia's exports are made up of raw materials and fertilizers,&lt;ref name=stats/&gt; although exports as a whole accounted for only 8.7% of the GDP in 2007, compared to 20% in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kommersant.com/p882678/r_527/macroeconomics/ Rosstat Confirms Record GDP Growth] [[Kommersant]] Retrieved on 5 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, after 15 years of negotiations, Russia finally joined the [[World Trade Organisation]]. The accession to WTO was expected to be ratified by Russian Parliament in the spring of 2012.

To boost the market share of locally produced vehicles and support the [[Automotive industry in Russia|Russia's automotive industry]], the government under Putin implemented several protectionist measures and launched programs to attract foreign producers into the country. In late 2005, the government enacted legislation to create [[special economic zone]]s (SEZ) with the aim of encouraging investments by foreign automotive companies. The benefits of operating in the special economic zones include tax allowances, abolishment of asset and land taxes and protection against changes in the tax regime. Some regions also provide extensive support for large investors (over $100&amp;nbsp;million.) These include [[Saint Petersburg]]/[[Leningrad Oblast]], [[Kaluga Oblast]] and [[Kaliningrad Oblast]].&lt;ref name=eurobank&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ebrd.com/downloads/research/economics/auto.pdf|title=Automotive Industry in Russia: Impact of foreign investments in car assembly plants on suppliers’ entry|last1=Krkoska|first1=Libor|last2=Spencer|first1=Alan|publisher=European Bank for Reconstruction and Development|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Putin as President and Premier, most of the world's largest automotive companies opened plants in Russia, including [[Ford Motor Company]], [[Toyota]], [[General Motors]], [[Nissan]], [[Hyundai Motor]], [[Suzuki]], [[Magna International]], [[Scania]] and [[MAN SE]].

In 2005, Putin initiated an industry consolidation programme to bring the main aircraft producing companies under a single umbrella organization, the [[United Aircraft Corporation]] (UAC). The aim was optimize production lines and minimise losses. The programme was divided in three parts: reorganization and crisis management (2007–2010), evolution of existing projects (2010–2015) and further progress within the newly created structure (2015–2025).&lt;ref name=ato1&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ato.ru/content/state-sponsored-consolidation|title=State-sponsored consolidation|last1=Zvereva|first1=Polina|journal=Russia &amp; CIS Observer|issue=26|volume=3|date=2009-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UAC, one of the so-called [[national champions]] and comparable to [[EADS]] in [[Europe]], enjoyed considerable financial support from the Russian government, and injected money to the companies it had acquired to improve their financial standing. The deliveries of civilian aircraft increased to 6 in 2005, and in 2009 the industry delivered 15 civilian aircraft, worth 12.5 billion roubles, mostly to domestic customers.&lt;ref name=UAC2009&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uacrussia.ru/common/img/uploaded/disclosure/Annual_Report_2009e.pdf|title=Annual Report 2009|publisher=United Aircraft Corporation|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Russia has successfully tested the [[fifth generation jet fighter]], [[Sukhoi PAK FA]], and started the commercial production of the [[regional airliner]] [[Sukhoi Superjet 100]], as well as started developing a number of other major projects.

In a similar fashion, Putin created the [[United Shipbuilding Corporation]] in 2007, which led to the recovery{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} of [[shipbuilding in Russia]]. Since 2006, much efforts were put into consolidation and development of the [[Rosatom Nuclear Energy State Corporation]], which led to the renewed construction of [[nuclear power plants in Russia]] as well as a vast activity of Rosatom abroad, buying huge shares in world's leading [[uranium]] production companies and building nuclear power plants in in many countries, including [[Iran]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[Vietnam]] and [[Belarus]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}} In 2007, the [[Russian Nanotechnology Corporation]] was established, aimed to boost the [[science and technology in Russia|science and technology]] and high-tech industry in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704575304575296351402535266.html?KEYWORDS=Chubais Future Vision] [[Wall Street Journal]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy policy===

{{See also|Energy in Russia|Oil industry of Russia|Nuclear power in Russia}}
[[File:RF NG pipestoEU.gif|thumb|250px|Under Putin, Russia strengthened its position as a key [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] supplier to much of Europe.]]

In the 2000s Russia's oil and gas wealth was transformed into the country's well-being and international influence, and Russia was frequently been described in the media as an [[energy superpower]].&lt;ref name=online.wsj.com/&gt;&lt;ref name=businessinsider.com/&gt; Putin oversaw that the growing taxation of oil and gas exports filled in the Russian budget, while oil and gas prices, production, and exports all significantly grew.

Putin sought to [[Russia in the European energy sector|Russia's large share on the European energy market]] by building the submerged gas pipelines bypassing Ukraine and the [[New Europe]] (the countries which were often seen as non-reliable transit partners by Russia, especially following [[Russia-Ukraine gas disputes]] of the late 2000s). The pipeline projects backed by Putin include the [[Blue Stream]] from Russia to [[Turkey]] (build on the [[Black Sea]] bed), [[Nord Stream]] from Russia to Germany (the longest sub-sea pipeline in the world, built through the [[Baltic Sea]]) and the planned [[South Stream]] from Russia to the [[Balkans]] and [[Italy]] (via the Black Sea). Russia also undermined the rival pipeline project [[Nabucco pipeline|Nabucco]] by buying the [[Turkmenistan|Turkmen]] gas and redirecting it into Russian pipelines.

On the other hand Russia diversified its export markets by building the [[Trans-Siberian oil pipeline]] to the markets of China, Japan and Korea, as well as the [[Sakhalin–Khabarovsk–Vladivostok gas pipeline]] in the [[Russian Far East]]. Russia has built [[LNG]] plant on [[Sakhalin]] and is building another one in [[Primorye]], aiming to increase the overseas gas exports. Meanwhile, in the [[Gulf of Finland]] Russia has built a major [[Ust-Luga]] port connected to the [[Baltic Pipeline System-II]], which allowed to export oil without transit through the ports of the [[Baltic states]]. The share of processed oil slowly grows with major [[oil refineries]] being built in [[Tatarstan]] and other regions of Russia.

Putin also presided over resuming the construction of major hydropower plants, such as the [[Bureya Dam]] and the [[Boguchany Dam]], as well as the restoration of the [[nuclear energy in Russia|nuclear industry of Russia]], with some 1&amp;nbsp;trillion rubles ($42.7&amp;nbsp;billion) allocated from the federal budget to nuclear power and industry development before 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amur.kp.ru/daily/24458/620649/ Russia builds nuclear power stations all over the world] at amur.kp.ru&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of nuclear power stations and units are currently being constructed by the state corporation [[Rosatom]] in Russia and abroad.

The vast construction and restoration of churches, started in 1990s, continued under Putin, and the state allowed the teaching of religion in schools (parents are provided with a choice for their children to learn the basics of one of the traditional religions or secular ethics).

While from the early 2000s Russia started pumping more money into its military and defence industry, it was only in 2008 that the full-scale [[Russian military reform]] began, aimed to modernize Russian Armed Forces and made them significantly more effective. The reform was largely carried by Defense Minister [[Anatoly Serdyukov]] during Medvedev's Presidency, under supervision of both Putin, as the Head of Government, and Medvedev, as the Commander-in-Chief of the Russian Armed Forces.

Key elements of the reform included reducing the armed forces to a strength of one million; reducing the number of officers; centralising officer training from 65 military schools into 10 'systemic' military training centres; creating a professional [[Non-commissioned officer|NCO]] corps; reducing the size of the central command; introducing more civilian logistics and auxiliary staff; elimination of cadre-strength formations; reorganising the reserves; reorganising the army into a brigade system; reorganising air forces into an air base system instead of regiments.&lt;ref name=military-reform&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20081017/117787642.html |title=Military reform to change army structure.

The number of Russia's [[military district]]s was reduced to just 4. The term of draft service was reduced from two years to one, which put an end to the old [[dedovschina|harassment]] traditions in the army, since all conscripts became very close by draft age. The gradual transition to the majority professional army by the late 2010s was announced, and a large programme of supplying the Armed Forces with new military equipment and ships was started.

====Relations with NATO and the West====

{{main|NATO–Russia relations|Russia–United States relations}}
Putin's Russia relationships with NATO and the U.S. have passed several stages. When Putin first became President, the relations were cautious. After the [[9/11 attacks]] when Putin quickly supported U.S. in the [[War on Terror]], the opportunity for partnership appeared.&lt;ref name=Bi-Partisan&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-f-cohen/us-russia-policy_b_1307727.html America's Failed (Bi-Partisan) Russia Policy] by [[Stephen F. Cohen]], huffingtonpost.com&lt;/ref&gt; However, the U.S. responded by further expansion of [[NATO]] to Russia's borders and by unilateral withdrawal from the 1972 [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]].&lt;ref name=Bi-Partisan/&gt; Since 2003, when Russia did not support the [[Iraq War]] and when Putin became ever more distant from the West in his internal and external policies, the relations continued to deteriorate. According to Russia scholar [[Stephen F. Cohen]], the narrative of the mainstream U.S. media, following that of the [[White House]], became profoundly anti-Putin, full of accusations that Putin had caused problems which actually stem from the 1990s, and assertions that Putin was personally responsible for any murders of his Russian political opponents, such as the journalist [[Anna Politkovskaya]] and the supposed KGB defector in London, [[Aleksandr Litvinenko]].&lt;ref name=Bi-Partisan/&gt; In an interview with [[Michael Stürmer]], Putin was quoted saying that there were three questions which most concerned Russia and Eastern Europe; namely the status of Kosovo, the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty and American plans to build missile defence sites in Poland and the Czech Republic, and suggested that all three were some way linked.&lt;ref name=Sturmer&gt;{{cite book|last=Stuermer|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Stürmer|title=Putin and the Rise of Russia|year=2008|publisher=Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson|location=London|isbn=9780297855101|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=E6UsAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=11 June 2012|pages=55, 57 &amp; 192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Putin's view, concessions on one of these questions on the Western side might be met with concessions from Russia on another.&lt;ref name=Sturmer/&gt;  

[[File:Vladimir Putin in Italy 17-18 April 2008-4.jpg|thumb|left||200px|Putin with [[Prime Minister of Italy|Italian Prime Minister]] [[Silvio Berlusconi]] (2008)]]

In February 2007, at the annual [[Munich Conference on Security Policy]], Putin openly criticized what he called the United States' monopolistic dominance in global relations, and &quot;almost uncontained hyper use of force in international relations&quot;. He said the result of it is that &quot;no one feels safe! Because no one can feel that [[international law]] is like a stone wall that will protect them. Of course such a policy stimulates an arms race.&quot;&lt;ref name=Munich&gt;43rd [[Munich Conference on Security Policy]].

Gates [[Munich]], Germany 11 February 2007].&lt;/ref&gt;

Putin publicly opposed plans for the [[National missile defense|U.S. missile shield]] in Europe, and presented President [[George W. Bush]] with a counterproposal on 7 June 2007 of modernising and sharing the use of the Soviet-era [[Qabala|Gabala]] radar station in [[Azerbaijan]] rather than building a new system in the [[Czech Republic]]&lt;ref name=Sturmer/&gt; Putin proposed it would not be necessary to place interceptor missiles in Poland then, but interceptors could be placed in NATO member [[Turkey]] or [[Iraq]]. Putin suggested also equal involvement of interested European countries in the project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2007/06/08/2251_type82914type82915_133552.shtml Press Conference following the end of the G8 Summit], 8 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was declined.

====Relations with the U.K.====
{{main|Russia–United Kingdom relations}}
[[File:Vladimir Putin 13 June 2005-1.jpg|thumb|upright|200px|Putin, [[Koni (dog)|Koni]] and British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] in 2005]]
By mid-2000s, the crisis escalated in the [[Russia–United Kingdom relations|relations between Russia and the United Kingdom]] as originating with Britain's decision{{opinion|date=March 2012}} to grant Putin's former patron, [[Russian oligarch|oligarch]] [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]], political asylum in 2003.&lt;ref name=expul/&gt; Since then, located in London, Berezovsky often called for the overthrow of Putin&lt;ref name=expul/&gt; and allegedly directed anti-Putin activities in Russia. The United Kingdom also granted asylum to the Chechen rebel leader [[Akhmed Zakayev]] and other people who fled from Russia.

In 2006 it became known that Britain spied on Russia using a fake rock, which was located on a street and contained electronic equipment that allowed British diplomats to receive and transmit information.&lt;ref name=spy-rock&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-16614209 UK spied on Russians with fake rock] [[BBC]]&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian security service [[Federal Security Service (Russia)|FSB]] linked the rock with allegations that British were making secret payments to pro-democracy and human rights groups, and the same year President Putin introduced a law which restricted [[non-governmental organisation]]s (NGOs) from getting funding from foreign governments. This resulted in many NGOs closing.&lt;ref name=spy-rock/&gt; In 2006, the Russian liberal opposition met the media reports on &quot;spy rock&quot; with contempt, alleging that it was made-up by FSB,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1tv.ru/news/polit/197091 Британия признала наличие шпионского камня, существование которого считали фантазией спецслужб] 1tv.ru&lt;/ref&gt; but in 2012 [[Jonathan Powell (aide)|Jonathan Powell]], ex-chief of staff of the U.K. Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], confessed that the story with the rock was true.&lt;ref name=spy-rock/&gt;

The end of 2006 brought very strained relations in the wake of the death by [[polonium]] poisoning&lt;ref name=BBC02Feb12/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The version of poisoning by [[polonium]], widely publicized by the British media, was later questioned because of numerous disparities and because in fact no official certification had been issued as to the cause or manner of death.[http://rt.com/news/litvinenko-secret-files-declassify-019/ Litvinenko: MI5, MI6 death files ordered released] [[Russia Today]]&lt;/ref&gt;  of [[Alexander Litvinenko]] in London. Litvinenko's friends [[Andrei Nekrasov]] and [[Alexander Goldfarb (microbiologist)|Alex Goldfarb]] (the chairman of [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]]'s [[International Foundation for Civil Liberties]]), made contradicting claims that Litvinenko had either dictated a statement either to his lawyer or to Goldfarb, or agreed with a statement composed by Goldfarb, in which Putin was allegedly accused of directing the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/6180262.stm In full: Litvinenko statement], BBC News, 24 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://svobodanews.ru/Article/2006/11/28/20061128185243507.html An interview with Andrei Nekrasov by Yury Veksler], [[Radio Liberty]], 28 November 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jordan|first=Mary|title=Poisoned Russian Had Sought Entry to U.S., Book Says|publisher=Washington Post|date=10 June 2007|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/06/09/AR2007060901354_pf.html|accessdate=2008-11-13}} ([http://www.webcitation.org/5cIgCG0BR Archived] at [[WebCite]]).&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have doubted that Litvinenko is the true author of the released statement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.izvestia.ru/investigation/article3098756/?print Soviet Moonwalker is Guilty for Litvinenko Death?

In 2007, the crisis in relations involved expelling four Russian [[diplomat|envoys]] over Russia's refusal to extradite a former KGB bodyguard [[Andrei Lugovoi]] to face charges on the alleged murder of Litvinenko,&lt;ref name=expul&gt;{{cite news|title=Brown Defends Russian Expulsions, Decries Killings|author=Gonzalo Vina and Sebastian Alison|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601102&amp;sid=ajvS9NfMW2EE&amp;refer=uk|publisher=Bloomberg News|date=20 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the Russian constitution prohibits the extradition of Russian nationals to third countries. Mirroring the British actions, Russia expelled UK diplomats and announced that it would suspend issuing visas to UK officials and froze cooperation on counterterrorism in response to Britain suspending contacts with their [[Federal Security Service]].&lt;ref name=expul/&gt; Lugovi subsequently became an MP in the Russian [[Duma]], giving him immunity from prosecution within Russia. On 10 December 2007, the British Ambassador in Moscow, Tony Brenton, reacted by saying: &quot;It is a pity that a man wanted for murder gains political recognition.

During the 2011-2 [[Syrian civil war]], Russia threatened to veto any sanctions against the Syrian government,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2012/0119/Why-Russia-is-willing-to-sell-arms-to-Syria Why Russia is willing to sell arms to Syria - CSMonitor.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to supply arms to the regime.

Putin opposed any foreign intervention. On  1 June 1 2012, in [[Paris]], he rejected the statement of French [[President of France|President]] [[Francois Hollande]] who called on [[Bashar Al-Assad]] to step down. Putin echoed the argument of the Assad regime that anti-regime ’’militants’’ were responsible for much of the bloodshed, rather than the shelling by Syrian forces and the civilian killings attributed by survivors and Western governments toregime supporters. He asked &quot;But how many of peaceful people (sic) were killed by so-called militants? Did you count? There are also hundreds of victims.&quot; He also talked about previous NATO interventions and their results, and asked &quot;What is happening in Libya, in Iraq? Did they become safer? Where are they heading? Nobody has an answer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-06-01/hollande-clashes-with-putin-over-ouster-of-syria-s-assad Hollande Clashes With Putin Over Ouster of Syria’s Assad - Businessweek&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Relations with post-Soviet states====
{{main|Color revolutions|Russia–Ukraine gas disputes|Russia–Ukraine relations|Belarus–Russia relations|Georgia–Russia relations|Kyrgyzstan–Russia relations}}
A series of the so-called [[color revolution]]s in the [[post-Soviet states]], namely the [[Rose Revolution]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in 2003, the [[Orange Revolution]] in [[Ukraine]] in 2004 and the [[Tulip Revolution]] in [[Kyrgyzstan]] in 2005, led to frictions in the relations of those countries with Russia. In December 2004, Putin criticised the Rose and Orange Revolution, according to him: &quot;If you have permanent revolutions you risk plunging the post-Soviet space into endless conflict&quot;.&lt;ref name=blueandorange/&gt; During the [[protests following the 2011 Russian elections]] (in December 2011) Putin named the Orange Revolution an infamous foreknowledge for Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;some of our opposition members were in Ukraine&quot;&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/russia/detail/118993/ Putin calls 'color revolutions' an instrument of destabilization], [[Kyiv Post]] (15 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from a clash of nationalist rhetorics{{Clarify|date=March 2012}} with the common historical legacies of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Russian Empire]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}, a number of economic disputes erupted between Russia and some neighbours, such as the [[2006 Russian ban of Moldovan and Georgian wines|Russian import ban of Georgian wine]]. And in some cases, such as the [[Russia–Ukraine gas disputes]], the economic conflicts affected other European countries, for example when a [[2009 Russia–Ukraine gas dispute|January 2009 gas dispute with Ukraine]] led [[state owned|state-controlled]] Russian company [[Gazprom]] to halt its deliveries of [[natural gas]] to Ukraine,&lt;ref name=naturalgas&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7240462.stm Q&amp;A: Russia-Ukraine gas row], [[BBC News]] (20 January 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; which left a number of European states, to which Ukraine transits Russian gas, to have serious shortages of natural gas in January 2009.&lt;ref name=naturalgas/&gt; In an interview with the German historian [[Michael Stürmer]] about the Russian shut-down of gas to Ukraine in early 2005, Putin linked the shut-down to the Orange revolution, saying: &quot;This has a price [the Orange revolution]. In spite of so much frustration we have stablizied the situation. In old days we concluded agreements with Ukraine year after year, and then included transit fees. The West Europeans had no idea that their energy security was a cliffhanger. By now we have a five-year agreement for transit to the E.U. This is an important step in the direction of European energy security&quot;.&lt;ref name=Sturmer/&gt;

The disputes typically arose because of inabilities of Ukraine to pay higher prices for natural gas and pay debts in time. In 2009, the Russia–Ukraine dispute was resolved by a long-term agreement on price formula, agreed by Prime Ministers Vladimir Putin of Russia and [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]] [[Yulia Tymoshenko]]&lt;ref name=naturalgas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7839053.stm Russia opens gas taps to Europe], [[BBC News]] (20 January 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; (later, when the rising global oil prices prompted the rising gas prizes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mongabay.com/images/commodities/charts/chart-ngeu.html Natural gas, Europe price chart], [[Mongabay]]&lt;/ref&gt; the agreement turned very unfavourable for Ukraine; in October 2011 Tymoshenko was found guilty of [[abuse of office]] when brokering the 2009 deal and was sentenced to seven years in prison).&lt;ref name=BBCOct2011&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15250742 Ukraine ex-PM Yulia Tymoshenko jailed over gas deal], BBC News (11 October 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The plans of [[Georgia–NATO relations|Georgia]] and [[Ukraine–NATO relations|Ukraine]] to become members of [[NATO]] have caused some tensions between Russia and those states. In 2010, Ukraine did abandon these plans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/10229626.stm Ukraine's parliament votes to abandon Nato ambitions], [[BBC News]] (June 3, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Putin allegedly declared at a NATO-Russia summit in 2008 that if Ukraine joined NATO Russia could contend to annex the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian East]] and [[Crimea]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/91772/ &quot;After Russian Invasion of Georgia, Putin's Words Stir Fears about Ukraine&quot;], [[Kyiv Post]] (30 November 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; In public Putin has stated that Russia has no intention of annexing any country.&lt;ref name=blueandorange&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4122721.stm Polish head rejects Putin attack], [[BBC News]] (December 24, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, Georgian President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] attempted to restore control over the breakaway [[South Ossetia]], claiming this action was in response to Ossetian border attacks on Georgians and to alleged buildups of Russian non-peacekeeping forces. [[Joint Control Commission for Georgian–Ossetian Conflict Resolution|Russian peacekeepers]] stationed there came under attack during the invasion and fought alongside the South Ossetians as Georgian troops pushed into the province and seized most of the capital of [[Tskhinvali]]. However, the Georgian military was soon defeated in the resulting [[2008 South Ossetia War]] after regular Russian forces entered South Ossetia and then Georgia proper, and also opened a second front in the other Georgian breakaway province of [[Abkhazia]] together with Abkhazian forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/research/RussiaandEurasia/wm2017.cfm|title=Russia and Eurasia|publisher=Heritage.org|date=|accessdate=2009-05-10|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5h7JPwfdR|archivedate=2009-05-28|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7551576.stm|title=Day-by-day: Georgia-Russia crisis|publisher=BBC News|date=2008-08-21|accessdate=2009-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this conflict, according to high level [[France|French]] diplomat [[Jean-David Levitte]], Putin intended to depose the [[Georgian President]] [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] and declared: &quot;I am going to hang Saakashvili by the balls&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1085468/Putin-planned-topple-president-Georgia-hang-b---says-Nicolas-Sarkozys-chief-adviser.html|title=Putin planned to topple the president of Georgia and 'hang him by the b****', says Nicolas Sarkozy's chief adviser|publisher=[[Mail Online]]|date=14 November 2008|location=London|first=Ian|last=Sparks|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Putin blamed the 2008 war and the bad relations between Russia and Georgia as &quot;the result of the policy that the Georgian authorities conducted back then and still attempt to conduct now&quot;; he stated that Georgia is a &quot;brotherly nation that hopfully will finally understand that Russia is not an enemy, but is a friend and the relations will be restored&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/politics/russia-friendly-relations-georgia-953/ Putin warns US against rearming Georgia], [[RT (TV network)|RT]] (22 February 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; (one month before Georgian President Saakashvili had stated &quot;Putin has a problem with Georgian people, but not with Georgian government&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20120121/170877003.html Georgia’s Saakashvili Slams Putin for Nationalist Comment], [[RIA Novosti]] (21 January 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Putin stated in 2009 Georgia could have kept Abkhazia and South Ossetia &quot;within its territory&quot; if it had treated the residents of Abkhazia and South Ossetia &quot;with respect&quot; (he claims they did &quot;the opposite&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO2E94DT4-Q Putin on Georgia's territorial integrity], [[RT (TV network)|RT]] via [[YouTube]] (8 Augustus 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Eurasian policy====
{{Main|Eurasian Union}}
[[File:Customs Union of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan Globe No Borders.PNG|thumb|left|The proposed [[Eurasian Union]] with the most likely immediate members: [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Kyrgyzstan]].]]
Despite existing or past tensions between Russia and most of the post-Soviet states, Putin has followed the policy of Eurasian integration. The [[Customs Union of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia]] has already brought partial economic unity between the three states, and the proposed [[Eurasian Union]] is said to be a continuation of this [[customs union]]. A number of other regional organizations also provide the basis for further integration: the [[Union State]] of Russia and Belarus, the [[Eurasian Economic Community]] of Russia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, the [[Collective Security Treaty Organisation]], consisting of [[Armenia]], Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Tajikistan and [[Uzbekistan]], and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] comprising most of the post-Soviet countries.

On 18 November 2011, the presidents of Belarus, Kazakhstan and Russia signed an agreement, setting a target of establishing the Eurasian Union by 2015.&lt;ref name=bbc18Nov2011&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia sees union with Belarus and Kazakhstan by 2015|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-15790452|newspaper=BBC News|date=18 November 2011|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement included the roadmap for the future integration and established the Eurasian Commission (modelled on the [[European Commission]]) and the Eurasian Economic Space, which started work on 1 January 2012.&lt;ref name=bbc18Nov2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=tut.by&gt;{{cite news|title=Евразийские комиссары получат статус федеральных министров|url=http://news.tut.by/politics/259307.html|newspaper=[[Tut.By]]|language=Russian|date=17 November 2011|accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programmes==

===Long-term strategies===
[[File:Vladimir Putin 8 February 2008-3.jpg|thumb|Putin presents the &quot;Strategy 2020&quot; to the Extended Meeting of the [[State Council of the Russian Federation|State Council of Russia]] on 8 February 2008.]]
The 2007 election campaign of the [[United Russia]] party went under the slogan &quot;''Putin's Plan: Russia's Victory''&quot;. When asked on the &quot;[[:ru:План Путина|Putin's Plan]]&quot;, Vladimir Putin said that his last five Addresses to the Federal Assembly contained some key parts &quot;devoted to the state's medium-term development&quot;, and &quot;if all these key ideas were put together to build a coherent system, it can become the country's development plan in the medium-term.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2007/09/14/1801_type82917type84779_144106.shtml Meeting] with Members of the [[Valdai International Discussion Club]], September 2007, Kremlin.Ru&lt;/ref&gt;

Later the &quot;Putin's Plan&quot; was transformed into the [[Strategy 2020]], which set the key goals and target figures for Russia's development until 2020. The &quot;Strategy 2020&quot; was first presented by Putin on the Extended Meeting of the [[State Council of the Russian Federation|State Council]] on 8 February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.kremlin.ru/appears/2008/02/08/1542_type63374type63378type82634_159528.shtml Выступление на расширенном заседании Государственного совета «О стратегии развития России до 2020 года»] [[Kremlin.ru]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second long-term development strategy adopted by the Russian Federation, following the [[:ru:Стратегия 2010|Strategy 2010]], which had been made the basis for Russian government programmes in June 2000 and was largely fulfilled by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csr.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=269%3A-l-2010-r-1-2010-&amp;catid=37%3A2009-03-18-14-33-16&amp;lang=ru СМИ о конференции «Стратегия-2010: итоги реализации и новые вызовы» 1 июня 2010 года] csr.ru&lt;/ref&gt;

===Programme articles===
Putin has published articles in the Russian press on a number of occasions, in particularly before and during his [[Russian presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential campaign]]. Soon after the announcement that he would run for another Presidency on 24 September 2011, in his article called &quot;New Integration Project for Eurasia – A Future That Is Being Born Today&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.america-russia.net/eng/geopolitics/288470359 New Integration Project for Eurasia – A Future That Is Being Born Today] {{en}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''Новый интеграционный проект для Евразии – будущее, которое рождается сегодня''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.izvestia.ru/news/502761 Новый интеграционный проект для Евразии – будущее, которое рождается сегодня] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;), published by [[Izvestiya]] on 3 October, he brought to attention the idea of the [[Eurasian Union]], composed of [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Belarus]] and possibly other [[post-Soviet states]]&lt;ref name=yahoo-reuters&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia's Putin says wants to build &quot;Eurasian Union&quot;|first=Gleb|last=Bryanski|url=http://news.yahoo.com/russias-putin-says-wants-build-eurasian-union-222139037.html|newspaper=[[Yahoo!

{{Wikisource|Author:Vladimir Putin/Articles|Vladimir Putin/Articles}}
In the course of the [[Russian presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential campaign]], in order to present his election program, Putin published 7 articles in different Russian editions. In those articles, he presented his vision of the problems which Russia successfully solved in the last decade and the goals yet to be achieved. The topics of the articles were as follows: the general overview, the ethnicity issue, economic tasks, democracy and government efficiency, social policy, military, foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=п░п╡я┌п╬я─ п╫п╬п╡п╬я│я┌п╦: п÷п╟п╡п╣п╩ п⌡п╣п╫я┌я▐п╣п╡ |url=http://neprussia.ru/news/maximum/1170 |title=7 статей и джек-пот: Путин завершил серию публикаций |publisher=Neprussia.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speeches and catch phrases==

===Addresses to the Federal Assembly===
During his terms in office Putin has made eight annual addresses to the [[Federal Assembly of Russia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/sdocs/speeches.shtml?date_to=2008/05/06&amp;stype=70029|title=Addresses to the Federal Assembly|publisher=Kremlin.ru|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; speaking on the situation in Russia and on guidelines of the internal and foreign policy of the State (as prescribed in Article 84 of the Constitution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-05.htm|title=Article 84 of the Russian Constitution|publisher=Constitution.ru|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

===Speeches abroad===
[[File:Putin in Munchen.jpg|thumb|Putin making his [[:ru:Мюнхенская речь Путина|Munich speech]] in 2007.]]
One of the most important and widely publicized speeches of Putin made abroad was made on 10 February 2007 on the [[Munich Conference on Security Policy]], and hence became known as the [[:ru:Мюнхенская речь Путина|Munich speech]]. It was dubbed by the press to be &quot;the turning point of the Russian foreign policy&quot;, and western observers called it the most tough speech from a leader of Russia since the time of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref name=nr2-munich&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nr2.ru/policy/104025.html |title=СМИ: мюнхенская речь Путина – поворотная точка во внешней политике РФ |publisher=Nr2.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech was also seen as been made by Putin to openly assert the new (old) role of Russia in the international politics, the role close to that of the [[Soviet Union]] and the return to which role is seen as one of the achievements of Putin's Presidency.&lt;ref name=nr2-munich/&gt;

In the Munich speech Putin called to uphold the principle &quot;security for everyone is security for all&quot;, criticized the policies of the [[United States]] and [[NATO]], condemned the [[unipolarity|unipolar model]] of international relations as flawed and lacking moral basis, condemned the [[hypocrisy]] of countries trying to teach [[democracy]] to Russia, condemned the domination of [[hard power]] and enforcement by the U.S. of the Western norms and laws to other countries bypassing the [[international law]] and substituting the [[United Nations]] by NATO or the [[European Union|EU]].&lt;ref name=nr2-munich/&gt; Putin also called to stop the [[militarization of space]] and questioned the plans to deploy [[National missile defense|American missile defense]] in Europe as threatening strategic [[nuclear deterrence|nuclear balance]] and spurring new [[arms race]] (that's when the countries dubbed as [[rogue states]] by the West are in fact lacking any rocket weapons capable to threaten Europe or the U.S. and being unable to develop such weapons any time soon).&lt;ref name=nr2-munich/&gt; Putin criticized the attempts of the U.S. and NATO to encircle Russia with their military bases, as well as their refusal to ratify the [[Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe]] even when Russia was already fulfilling it (for which reason Russia had to suspend the treaty later in 2007).&lt;ref name=nr2-munich/&gt; His speech was criticized by some attendant delegates at the conference, including former NATO secretary [[Jaap de Hoop Scheffer]] who called it &quot;disappointing and not helpful.&quot;&lt;ref name=BBC/&gt;

On 4 July 2007 Putin made a full fluent English speech while addressing delegates at the 119th [[International Olympic Committee]] Session in [[Guatemala City]] on behalf of the successful bid of [[Sochi]] for the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], the first Winter Olympic Games in Russia.&lt;ref name=kremlin-2014/&gt;

===Outdoor speeches===

Notable Putin's outdoor speeches include his addresses during the [[Victory Day (9 May)|Victory Day]] [[:Template:Moscow Victory Parade|Moscow Military Parade]]s one every 9 May in the years between [[2000 Moscow Victory Day Parade|2000]] and 2007. Under Putin's presidency and premiership, the old Soviet tradition of 9 May Parades, which had been in decline in 1990s, was gradually restored in full grandeur. Since the [[2008 Moscow Victory Day Parade]] the [[armoured fighting vehicle]]s resumed regular taking part in the [[Red Square]] parades. Putin often used the Victory Day occasion to discuss Russia's military development and Russia's security and foreign affairs. For example, he said on 9 May 2007 that &quot;threats are not becoming fewer but are only transforming and changing their appearance. These new threats, just as under the [[Third Reich]], show the same contempt for human life and the same aspiration to establish an exclusive dictate over the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2007/05/09/1432_type82912type127286_127675.shtml Speech at the Military Parade Celebrating the 62nd Anniversary of Victory in the Great Patriotic War], Red Square, Moscow, 9 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his [[Russian presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential campaign]] Putin made a single outdoor public speech at the 100,000-strong rally of his supporters in the [[Luzhniki Stadium]] on 23 February, Russia's [[Defender of the Fatherland Day]].&lt;ref name=rian-luzhniki&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/video/20120223/171487865.html Putin Supporters Fill Moscow Stadium] [[RIAN]]&lt;/ref&gt; In the speech he called not to betray the [[Mother Russia|Motherland]], but to love her, to unite around Russia and to work together for the good, to overcome the existing problems.&lt;ref name=vz-luzhniki&gt;[http://vz.ru/news/2012/2/23/563536.html Путин: Главное, чтобы мы были вместе] vz.ru&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the foreign interference into Russian affairs should not be allowed, that Russia has its own free will. He compared the political situation at the moment (when fears were spread in the Russian society that [[2011–2012 Russian protests]] could instigate a [[color revolution]] directed from abroad) with the [[First Fatherland War]] of 1812, reminding that its 200th anniversary and the anniversary of the [[Battle of Borodino]] would be celebrated in 2012.Putin cited [[Lermontov]]'s poem ''[[Borodino (poem)|Borodino]]'' and ended the speech with [[Vyacheslav Molotov]]'s famous [[Great Patriotic War]] slogan &quot;The Victory Shall Be Ours!&quot; (''&quot;Победа будет за нами!&quot;'').&lt;ref name=rian-luzhniki/&gt;&lt;ref name=vz-luzhniki/&gt;

On the post-[[Russian presidential election, 2012|election]] celebration rally, while making an acceptance speech, Putin was for the first time ever seen with tears in his eyes (later he explained that &quot;it was windy&quot;). He said to a 110,000-strong audience: &quot;I told you we would win and we won!&quot;&lt;ref name=rian-manezhnaya&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/russia/20120304/171729884.html ‘We Won in Fair and Open Fight' – Putin] [[RIAN]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=— 04 March 2012 |url=http://www.setyoufreenews.com/2012/03/04/we-won-teary-eyed-putin-proclaims-victory/ |title=‘We won!’ Teary-eyed Putin proclaims victory |publisher=Setyoufreenews.com |date=2012-03-04 |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putin is known for his often tough and sharp language.&lt;ref name=putinisms/&gt; The examples of most popular putinisms include:&lt;ref name=rian-putinisms&gt;[http://ria.ru/politics/20080507/106744531.html 20 высказываний Путина, ставших афоризмами] [[RIAN]]&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Мочить в сортире'' – ''To bump off in a toilet''. One of the earliest &quot;putinisms&quot;, made in September 1999, when he promised to destroy terrorists wherever they were found, including in toilets.&lt;ref name=rian-putinisms/&gt; In 2010, Putin also promised to pluck out the remaining terrorists from the bottom of a sewer (''выковырять со дна канализации'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.izvestia.ru/news/360123 Премьер-министр Владимир Путин: Их нужно выковырять со дна канализации] izvestia.ru&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Она утонула'' – ''She sank''. Putin's short answer to a question from [[Larry King]] in September 2000 asking what happened to the [[Russian submarine K-141 Kursk]].&lt;ref name=rian-putinisms/&gt; Many criticized Putin for the cynicism perceived in this answer. This curt reply also spawned a new kind of joke based on giving one short, self-evident answer (including a verb in past tense) to a ''&quot;What has happened with..?&quot;'' question.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}
*''Пахал, как раб на галерах'' – literally, ''Ploughed like a slave on a galley'' (the Russian verb ''пахать'' also has the general meaning of &quot;to do hard work&quot;). This is how Putin described his work as President of Russia from 2000 to 2008 during a Q&amp;A conference in February 2008.&lt;ref name=putinisms/&gt; Not only did the phrase itself became popular, but a wrong reading of it—''как раб'' (&quot;like a slave&quot;) in Russian sounds almost identical to ''как краб'' (&quot;like a [[crab]]&quot;)—led to the appearance of a popular Internet nickname for Putin, &quot;Crabbe&quot; (Russian: ''Крабе''), while [[Dmitry Medvedev]] was (for some reason) similarly nicknamed Shmele (Russian: ''Шмеле'', a non-existent [[vocative]] form of ''шмель'', meaning &quot;[[bumblebee]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsland.ru/news/detail/id/844510/ |title=Почему Путин - краб, Ленин - гриб, Медведев - шмель? |publisher=Newsland.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Vladimir Putin-6.jpg|thumb|left|Putin during one of his annual Q&amp;A conferences, indicating with his pen.]]
*''От мертвого осла уши'' – ''Ears of a dead [[Donkey|ass]]''. According to Putin, that was what [[Latvia]] would receive instead of the western [[Pytalovsky District]] of Russia claimed by Latvia in a territorial dispute stemming from the [[Baltic states in the Soviet Union (1944–1991)#Resistance and deportations|Soviet border redrawing]].&lt;ref name=putinisms/&gt; On 27 March 2007 Russia and Latvia signed the treaty on state border, in which Latvia renounced its territorial claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utro.ru/articles/2007/03/27/636217.shtml |title=Россия и Латвия подписали договор о рубежах |publisher=Utro.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Шакалить у иностранных посольств'' – ''[[Jackal]]ing at foreign embassies''. Putin's view of the Russian &quot;non-systemic opposition&quot;: characterising them as having minimal support among the population, he says that they turn to asking for money and support from foreign governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/dw/article/0,,2960021,00.html |title=Путин: оппозиция &quot;шакалит&quot; у зарубежных фондов и правительств |publisher=Dw.de |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Как минимум государственный деятель должен иметь голову.'' – ''At the very least, a state leader should have a head''. Putin's response to [[Hillary Clinton]]'s claim that Putin has no soul. He also recommended that international relations be built without emotion and instead on the basis of the fundamental interests of the states involved.&lt;ref name=rian-putinisms/&gt;
*''Ручку верните'' – ''Return my pen''. A phrase said by Putin to the industrial oligarch [[Oleg Deripaska]], after Deripaska was forced by Putin to sign, using Putin's pen, an agreement aimed at resolving a socio-economic crisis in the [[monograd]] of [[Pikalyovo, Leningrad Oblast|Pikalyovo]] on 4 June 2009, which had escalated after the different owners of the [[aluminum oxide]] plant and connected enterprises in the town did not pay their workers' salaries and were unable to negotiate the terms on which the local industrial complex would work. Putin came to the scene personally to conduct the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw3d.de/dw/article/0,,4324131,00.html |title=Блогозрение: Волшебная ручка Путина |publisher=Dw3d.de |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Putin's painting ''&quot;Узор на заиндевевшем окне&quot;'' (''A Pattern on a Hoarfrost-Encrusted Window''), which he had painted during the Christmas Fair on 26 December 2008, became the top lot at the charity auction in Saint Petersburg and sold for 37 million rubles.&lt;ref name=putin-painting&gt;[http://ria.ru/society/20090117/159499680.html Картина Путина стала самым дорогим лотом на аукционе в Петербурге] [[RIAN]]&lt;/ref&gt; The picture was made for a series of other paintings by famous Russians.

Putin's picture depicted a hoarfrost pattern (Russian: Узор, illustrating the Cyrillic letter [[У]]) on a window with [[curtain]]s sewn with traditional [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] ornaments.&lt;ref name=putin-painting/&gt; The creation of the painting coincided with the [[2009 Russia-Ukraine gas dispute]], which left a number of European states without Russian gas and amid January frosts.&lt;ref name=naturalgas/&gt;

Putin also is a subject of [[Russian jokes]] and [[chastushka]]s, such as a popular chastushka song &quot;[Before Putin] There Was No [[Orgasm]]&quot; featured in the comedy film ''[[:ru:День выборов (фильм)|The Day of Elections]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sergeysv.net/songs/?id=ne-bylo-orgazma |title=Частушки (Не было оргазма) |publisher=Sergeysv.net |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a [[meta-joke]], that since the coming of Putin to power, [[Vovochka|all the classic jokes]] about a smart yet rude boy called ''Вовочка'' (''Vovochka'', diminutive from [[Vladimir]]) have suddenly become [[political joke]]s.

Putin features in the colouring book for children ''Vova and Dima'' (presented on his 59th birthday),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lenta.ru/photo/2011/10/06/vovaanddima/ Вова и Дима] [[Lenta.ru]]&lt;/ref&gt; where he and [[Dmitry Medvedev]] are drawn as good-behaving little boys, and in the ''Superputin'' online comics series, where Putin and Medvedev are portrayed first as [[superhero]]es,&lt;ref name=Superputin/&gt; and then as a [[Races and factions of Warcraft#Trolls|troll]] and an [[Races and factions of Warcraft#Orcs|orc]] in the [[World of Warcraft]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.superputin.ru/ Superputin] official site.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal wealth and residences===
Figures released during the [[Russian legislative election, 2007|legislative election of 2007]] put Putin's wealth at approximately 3.7 million [[Russian ruble|rubles]] ($150,000) in bank accounts, a private {{convert|77.4|m2|adj=on|sqft|sp=us}} apartment in Saint Petersburg, 260 [[shares]] of Bank Saint Petersburg (with a December 2007 market price $5.36 per share&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quote.ru/fterm/emitent.shtml?49/1249|title=Quote.Rbc.Ru :: Аюмй Яюмйр-Оерепаспц&amp;nbsp;— Юйжхх, Ярпсйрспю, Мнбнярх, Тхмюмяш|publisher=Quote.ru|accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and two 1960s-era [[Volga (automobile)#GAZ-21|Volga M21]] cars that he inherited from his father and does not [[vehicle registration|register]] for on-road use. In 2012 Putin reported an income of 3.6 million rubles ($113,000).

One of Putin's favorite sports is the [[martial art]] of [[judo]]. Putin began training in [[sambo (martial art)|sambo]] (a martial art that originated in the [[Soviet Union]]) at the age of 14, before switching to judo, which he continues to practice today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/news/specials/putin/nprinterview.html Vladimir Putin: the NPR interview] US radio station [[National Public Radio]] New York (15 November 2001)&lt;/ref&gt; Putin won competitions in his hometown of [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad (now Saint Petersburg)]], including the senior championships of Leningrad in both sambo and judo. He is the President of the [[Yawara Dojo]], the same Saint Petersburg [[dojo]] he practiced at when young. Putin co-authored a book on his favorite sport, published in Russian as ''Judo with Vladimir Putin'' and in English under the title ''[[Judo: History, Theory, Practice]] (2004).''&lt;ref name=putin-judo&gt;{{cite book|last=Putin|first=Vladimir V.|coauthors=Vasilii Shestakov, Alexey Levitsky, Aleksei Levitskii|year=2004|month=July|title=Judo: History, Theory, Practice|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=1-55643-445-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though he is not the first world leader to practice judo, Putin is the first leader to move forward into the advanced levels. Currently, Putin holds a 6th ''[[Dan (rank)|dan]]'' ([[Black belt (martial arts)|red/white belt]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaikoforum.com/30-Yamashita.pdf Black-Belt President Putin: A Man of Gentle Arts] by [[Yasuhiro Yamashita]]&lt;/ref&gt; and is best known for his [[Harai Goshi]] (sweeping hip throw). Putin earned [[Master of Sports]] (Soviet and Russian sport title) in judo in 1975 and in sambo in 1973. At a state visit to Japan, Putin was invited to the [[Kodokan Institute]], the judo headquarters, where he showed different judo techniques to the students and Japanese officials.

Putin also holds a 6th ''dan'' black belt in [[Kyokushin kaikan]] [[karate]]. He was presented the black belt in December 2009 by Japanese champion Kyokushin Karate-Do master [[Hatsuo Royama]].&lt;ref name=putin-karate&gt;[http://premier.gov.ru/eng/premier/press/ru/4447/ Moskovsky Komsomolets: “Putin becomes sixth-level black belt”] by Oleg Fochkin. premier.gov, re-publication of a [[Moskovsky Komsomolets]] article.&lt;/ref&gt;
