==Early life==
Barbara Joan Streisand (see [[Barbra Streisand#Name|name change]]) was born on April 24, 1942, in [[Brooklyn]], New York, the daughter of Diana (née Ida Rosen) and Emanuel Streisand. Her mother was at one time a singer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gavin |first=James |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/07/books/review/hello-gorgeous-becoming-barbra-streisand-by-william-j-mann.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 |title=‘Hello, Gorgeous - Becoming Barbra Streisand,’ by William J. Mann |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2012-10-05 |accessdate=2012-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her father was a respected high school teacher. Her family was Jewish; her paternal grandparents immigrated from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and her maternal grandparents from [[Russian Empire|Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Barbra: The Way She Is'', Christopher Andersen, 2006, p. 20-22&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen months after Streisand's birth, her father died of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] and the family fell into near-poverty.&lt;ref name=virtual&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/streisand.html |title=Barbra Streisand |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=2011-08-17| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110717051439/http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/streisand.html| archivedate= July 17, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has an older brother, Sheldon, and a half-sister, the singer [http://www.roslynkind.com/ Roslyn Kind],&lt;ref name=virtual/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez, Greg.[http://www.insidesocal.com/outinhollywood/2008/01/my-chat-wroslyn-kind-streisand.html &quot;My Chat w/Roslyn Kind: Streisand's sister is on the comeback trail...&quot;] insidesocal.com, January 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Goldfarb, Myra Yellin.[http://articles.mcall.com/1993-07-02/features/2939973_1_roslyn-kind-barbra-streisand-nightclub-performer &quot;What's Up&quot;] mcall.com, July 2, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; from her mother's re-marriage, to Louis Kind, in 1949.&lt;ref name=virtual/&gt; Kind is nine years younger than Barbra.&lt;ref name=las&gt;Fink, Jerry.[http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2008/nov/11/streisands-sister-has-come-terms-superstars-shadow/ &quot;Streisand’s sister has ‘come to terms’ with superstar’s shadow&quot;] lasvegassun.com, November 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

She wanted to be an actress and appeared in [[summer stock]] and in a number of [[Off-Off-Broadway]] productions, including ''Driftwood'' (1959), with then-unknown [[Joan Rivers]]. (In her autobiography, Rivers wrote that she played a lesbian with a crush on Streisand's character, but this was later denied by the play's author.)

Streisand's first television appearance was on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', then hosted by [[Jack Paar]], in 1961, singing [[Harold Arlen]]'s &quot;[[A Sleepin' Bee]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/27/arts/music/27tomm.html?scp=1&amp;sq=streisand%20arlen&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Streisand's Fine Instrument and Classic Instinct | first=Anthony | last=Tommasini | date=September 27, 2009 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orson Bean]], who substituted for Paar that night, had seen the singer perform at a gay bar and booked her for the telecast. (Her older brother Sheldon paid [[NBC]] for a [[kinescope]] film so she could use it in 1961 to promote herself. Decades later the film was preserved through [[digitizing]] and is available for viewing on a website.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DXvLD-pxms |title=YouTube clip of Streisand on Tonight Show with Orson Bean and Phyllis Diller, 1961 |publisher=Youtube.com |date=March 12, 2007 |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1961, Streisand became a semi-regular on ''[[PM East/PM West]]'', a talk/variety series. ''PM East'' was hosted by [[Mike Wallace (journalist)|Mike Wallace]] and [[Joyce Davidson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;barbra-archives1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barbra-archives.com/tv/60s/pm_east_streisand.html |title='P.M.

[[Westinghouse Broadcasting]], which aired the television show in a select few cities (Boston, New York, Baltimore, Washington DC, Pittsburgh, Cleveland, Chicago and San Francisco), [[wiped]] all the videotapes soon after broadcasting them.&lt;ref name=&quot;barbra-archives1&quot;/&gt; Audio segments from some episodes, which were saved by Streisand's fans, are part of the compilation CD ''Just for the Record'', which went platinum in 1991.

In 1962, after several appearances on ''PM East/PM West'', Streisand first appeared on Broadway, in the small but star-making role of Miss Marmelstein in the musical ''[[I Can Get It for You Wholesale]]''. Her first album, ''[[The Barbra Streisand Album]]'', won two [[Grammy Award]]s in 1963. Following her success in ''I Can Get It for You Wholesale'', Streisand made several appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' in 1962 and 1963. Topics covered in her interviews with host [[Johnny Carson]] included the [[Empire silhouette|empire-waisted]] dresses that she bought [[wholesale]] and her &quot;crazy&quot; reputation at Erasmus Hall High School.&lt;ref&gt;[http://barbra-archives.com/tv/60s/tonight_show_streisand.html Barbra Streisand Archives | Johnny Carson Tonight Show 1962–1963] barbra-archives.com&lt;/ref&gt; As is the case with Mike Wallace, only audio survives from small portions of her telecast conversations with Carson.  It was at about this time that Streisand entered into a long and successful professional relationship with [[Lee Solters]] and Sheldon Roskin as her publicists with the firm Solters/Roskin (later Solters/Roskin/Friedman).

Streisand returned to Broadway in 1964 with an acclaimed performance as entertainer [[Fanny Brice]] in ''[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]]'' at the [[Winter Garden Theatre]]. The show introduced two of her signature songs, &quot;People&quot; and &quot;Don't Rain on My Parade.&quot; Because of the play's overnight success, she appeared on the cover of ''Time.''  In 1966, she repeated her success with ''Funny Girl'' in London's West End at the [[Prince of Wales Theatre]].  From 1965 to 1967 she appeared in her first four solo television specials.

==Career==

===Singing===
Streisand has recorded 50 studio albums, almost all with [[Columbia Records]]. Her early works in the 1960s (her debut ''[[The Barbra Streisand Album]]'', ''[[The Second Barbra Streisand Album]]'', ''[[The Third Album (Barbra Streisand album)|The Third Album]]'', ''[[My Name Is Barbra]]'', etc.) are considered classic renditions of theater and cabaret standards, including her pensive version of the normally uptempo &quot;[[Happy Days Are Here Again]]&quot;. She performed this in a duet with Judy Garland on ''[[The Judy Garland Show]]''.  Garland referred to her on the air as one of the last great [[belt (music)|belters]].  They also sang &quot;[[There's No Business Like Show Business (song)|There's No Business Like Show Business]]&quot; with [[Ethel Merman]] joining them.

Beginning with ''My Name Is Barbra'', her early albums were often medley-filled keepsakes of her television specials. Starting in 1969, she began attempting more contemporary material, but like many talented singers of the day, she found herself out of her element with rock. Her vocal talents prevailed, and she gained newfound success with the pop and ballad-oriented [[Richard Perry]]-produced album ''Stoney End'' in 1971. The title track, written by [[Laura Nyro]], was a major hit for Streisand.

[[File:Barbara Streisand Allan Warren.jpg|thumb|left|1973]]
During the 1970s, she was also highly prominent on the pop charts, with Top 10 recordings such as &quot;[[The Way We Were (song)|The Way We Were]]&quot; (US No. 1), &quot;[[Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star Is Born)]]&quot; (US No. 1), &quot;[[No More Tears (Enough Is Enough)]]&quot; (1979, with [[Donna Summer]]), which as of 2010 is reportedly still the most commercially successful duet, (US No. 1), &quot;[[You Don't Bring Me Flowers]]&quot; (with [[Neil Diamond]]) (US No. 1) and &quot;The Main Event&quot; (US No. 3), some of which came from soundtrack recordings of her films. As the 1970s ended, Streisand was named the most successful female singer in the U.S. — only [[Elvis Presley]] and [[The Beatles]] had sold more albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.riaa.com/news/newsletter/press1999/111099.asp |title=''Recording Industry Association of America: Newsletter 1999'' |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070514091340/http://www.riaa.com/news/newsletter/press1999/111099.asp |archivedate=2007-05-14}}. RIAA.com.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, she released her best-selling effort to date, the [[Barry Gibb]]-produced ''[[Guilty (Barbra Streisand album)|Guilty]]''. The album contained the hits &quot;[[Woman in Love]]&quot; (which spent several weeks atop the pop charts in the Fall of 1980), &quot;[[Guilty (Barbra Streisand and Barry Gibb song)|Guilty]]&quot;, and &quot;[[What Kind of Fool]]&quot;.

After years of largely ignoring Broadway and traditional pop music in favor of more contemporary material, Streisand returned to her musical-theater roots with 1985's ''[[The Broadway Album]]'', which was unexpectedly successful, holding the coveted No. 1 Billboard position for three straight weeks, and being certified quadruple platinum. The album featured tunes by [[Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein]], [[George Gershwin]], [[Jerome Kern]], and [[Stephen Sondheim]], who was persuaded to rework some of his songs especially for this recording. ''[[The Broadway Album]]'' was met with acclaim, including a Grammy nomination for album of the year and, ultimately, handed Streisand her eighth Grammy as Best Female Vocalist. After releasing the live album ''[[One Voice (Barbra Streisand album)|One Voice]]'' in 1986, Streisand was set to take another musical journey along the Great White Way in 1988. She recorded several cuts for the album under the direction of [[Rupert Holmes]], including &quot;[[On My Own (Les Misérables)|On My Own]]&quot; (from ''[[Les Misérables (musical)|Les Misérables]]''), a medley of &quot;How Are Things in Glocca Morra?&quot; and &quot;Heather on the Hill&quot; (from ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'' and ''[[Brigadoon (musical)|Brigadoon]]'', respectively), &quot;[[All I Ask of You]]&quot; (from ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]''), &quot;Warm All Over&quot; (from ''[[The Most Happy Fella]]'') and an unusual solo version of &quot;[[Make Our Garden Grow]]&quot; (from ''[[Candide (operetta)|Candide]]''). Streisand was not happy with the direction of the project and it was ultimately scrapped. Only &quot;Warm All Over&quot; and a reworked, lite FM-friendly version of &quot;All I Ask of You&quot; were ever released, the latter appearing on Streisand's 1988 effort, ''[[Till I Loved You (album)|Till I Loved You]]''. At the beginning of the 1990s, Streisand started focusing on her film directorial efforts and became almost inactive in the recording studio. In 1991, a four-disc box set, ''Just for the Record'', was released. A compilation spanning Streisand's entire career to date, it featured over 70 tracks of live performances, greatest hits, rarities and previously unreleased material.

The following year, Streisand's concert fundraising events helped propel former [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] into the spotlight and into office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barbra-archives.com/bjs_library/90s/george_1996.html |title=Reprint of article in ''George Magazine''. November 1996 |publisher=Barbra-archives.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streisand later introduced Clinton at his inauguration in 1993. Streisand's music career, however, was largely on hold. A 1992 appearance at an APLA benefit as well as the aforementioned inaugural performance hinted that Streisand was becoming more receptive to the idea of live performances. A tour was suggested, though Streisand would not immediately commit to it, citing her well-known stage fright as well as security concerns. During this time, Streisand finally returned to the recording studio and released ''[[Back to Broadway]]'' in June 1993. The album was not as universally lauded as its predecessor, but it did debut at No. 1 on the pop charts (a rare feat for an artist of Streisand's age, especially given that it relegated [[Janet Jackson]]'s ''[[Janet (album)|Janet]]'' to the No. 2 spot). One of the album's highlights was a medley of &quot;[[I Have A Love/One Hand, One Heart|I Have A Love&quot; / &quot;One Hand, One Heart]]&quot;, a duet with [[Johnny Mathis]], who Streisand said is one of her favorite singers (this is stated in the CD's liner notes).{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 1993, ''New York Times'' music critic [[Stephen Holden]] wrote that Streisand &quot;enjoys a cultural status that only one other American entertainer, [[Frank Sinatra]], has achieved in the last half century.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/06/27/arts/recordings-view-barbra-streisand-mixes-star-power-and-high-concept.html?scp=1&amp;sq=streisand%20holden%20sinatra&amp;st=cse |title=Barbra Streisand Mixes Star Power And High Concept by Stephen Holden, New York Times, June 27, 1993 |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=June 27, 1993 |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 1993, Streisand announced her first public concert appearances in 27 years. What began as a two-night New Year's event at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] eventually led to a multi-city tour in the summer of 1994. Tickets to the tour were sold out in under one hour. Streisand also appeared on the covers of major magazines in anticipation of what ''Time magazine'' named &quot;The Music Event of the Century.&quot; The tour was one of the biggest all-media merchandise parlays in history. Ticket prices ranged from US$50 to US$1,500 – making Streisand the highest-paid concert performer in history. ''[[The Concert (Barbra Streisand album)|Barbra Streisand: The Concert]]'' went on to be the top-grossing concert of the year and earned five [[Emmy Awards]] and the [[Peabody Award]], while the taped broadcast on [[HBO]] is, to date, the highest-rated concert special in HBO's 30-year history.  Following the tour's conclusion, Streisand once again kept a low profile musically, instead focusing her efforts on acting and directing duties as well as a burgeoning romance with actor [[James Brolin]].

In 1997, she finally returned to the recording studio, releasing ''[[Higher Ground (Barbra Streisand album)|Higher Ground]]'', a collection of songs of a loosely-inspirational nature which also featured a duet with [[Céline Dion]]. The album received generally favorable reviews and, remarkably, once again debuted at No. 1 on the pop charts. Following her marriage to Brolin in 1998, Streisand recorded an album of love songs entitled ''[[A Love Like Ours]]'' the following year. Reviews were mixed, with many critics carping about the somewhat syrupy sentiments and overly-lush arrangements; however, it did produce a modest hit for Streisand in the country-tinged &quot;If You Ever Leave Me&quot;, a duet with [[Vince Gill]].

On New Year's Eve 1999, Streisand returned to the concert stage, with the highest-grossing single concert in Las Vegas history to date.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} At the end of the millennium, she was the number-one female singer in the U.S., with at least two No. 1 albums in each decade since she began performing. A two-disc live album of the concert entitled ''[[Timeless: Live in Concert]]'' was released in 2000. Streisand performed versions of the ''Timeless'' concert in Sydney and Melbourne, Australia, in early 2000. In advance of four concerts (two each in Los Angeles and New York) in September 2000, Streisand announced she was retiring from paying public concerts. Her performance of the song &quot;[[People (1964 song)|People]]&quot; was broadcast on the Internet via America Online.

Streisand's most-recent albums have been ''[[Christmas Memories]]'' (2001), a somewhat somber collection of holiday songs (which felt entirely —albeit unintentionally— appropriate in the early post-9/11 days), and ''[[The Movie Album]]'' (2003), featuring famous film themes and backed by a large symphony orchestra. ''[[Guilty Pleasures (Barbra Streisand album)|Guilty Pleasures]]'' (called ''Guilty Too'' in the UK), a collaboration with Barry Gibb and a sequel to their ''Guilty'', was released worldwide in 2005.

In February 2006, Streisand recorded the song &quot;Smile&quot; alongside [[Tony Bennett]] at Streisand's [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] home. The song is included on Tony Bennett's 80th birthday album, ''[[Duets (Barbra Streisand album)|Duets]]''. In September 2006, the pair filmed a live performance of the song for a special directed by [[Rob Marshall]] entitled ''Tony Bennett: An American Classic''. The special aired on NBC November 21, 2006, and was released on DVD the same day. Streisand's duet with Bennett opened the special. In 2006, Streisand announced her intent to tour again, in an effort to raise money and awareness for multiple issues. After four days of rehearsal at the [[Sovereign Bank Arena]] in [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]], New Jersey, the tour began on October 4 at the Wachovia Center in [[Philadelphia]], continued with a featured stop in [[Fort Lauderdale]], Florida, (this was the concert Streisand chose to film for a TV special), and concluded at Staples Center in Los Angeles on November 20, 2006. Special guests [[Il Divo]] were interwoven throughout the show. The show was known as ''[[Streisand: The Tour]]''.

Streisand's 20-concert tour set box-office records. At the age of 64, well past the prime of most performers, she grossed $92,457,062 and set house gross records in 14 of the 16 arenas played on the tour. She set the third-place record for her October 9, 2006, show at Madison Square Garden, the first- and second-place records of which are held by her two shows in September 2000. She set the second-place record at the [[MGM Grand Garden Arena]], with her December 31, 1999, show being the house record and the highest-grossing concert of all time. This led many people to openly criticize Streisand for [[price gouging]], as many tickets sold for upwards of $1,000.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

A collection of performances culled from different stops on this tour, ''[[Live in Concert 2006]]'', debuted at No. 7 on the [[Billboard 200]], making it Streisand's 29th Top 10 album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/news/chart-beat-chat-1003587796.story#/news/chart-beat-chat-1003587796.story |title=Chart Beat Chat |publisher=Billboard.com |date=2007-07-07 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 2007, Streisand gave concerts for the first time in continental Europe. The first concert took place in Zürich (June 18), then Vienna (June 22), Paris (June 26), Berlin (June 30), Stockholm (July 4, canceled), Manchester (July 10) and Celbridge, near Dublin (July 14), followed by three concerts in London (July 18, 22 and  25), the only European city where Streisand had performed before 2007. Tickets for the London dates cost between £100.00 and £1,500.00 and for the Ireland date between €118 and €500. The tour included a 58-piece orchestra.

In February 2008, ''[[Forbes]]'' listed Streisand as the No. 2 earning female musician, between June 2006 and June 2007, with earnings of about $60 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2008/01/28/music-madonna-hollywood-biz-cz_dp_0129musicwomen_slide_3.html?thisSpeed=15000 |title=In Pictures: The Top-Earning Women In Music - Forbes.com |publisher=Forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-02 |first=Dorothy |last=Pomerantz| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081027232611/http://www.forbes.com/2008/01/28/music-madonna-hollywood-biz-cz_dp_0129musicwomen_slide_3.html?thisSpeed=15000| archivedate= October 27, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Streisand's range has changed with time and her voice has deepened over the years, her vocal prowess has remained remarkably secure for a singer whose career has endured for nearly half a century.

This album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 and registered her biggest weekly sales since 1997, making Streisand the only artist in history to achieve No. 1 albums in five different decades.

On February 1, 2010, Streisand joined over 80 other artists in recording a new version of the 1985 charity single &quot;[[We Are the World]]&quot;. [[Quincy Jones]] and [[Lionel Richie]] planned to release the new version to mark the 25th anniversary of its original recording. These plans changed, however, in view of the devastating earthquake that hit Haiti on January 12, 2010, and on February 12, the song, now called &quot;[[We Are the World 25 for Haiti]]&quot;, made its debut as a charity single to support relief aid for the beleaguered island nation.

Streisand was joined onstage by trumpeter [[Chris Botti]], Italian operatic trio [[Il Volo]] and her son Jason Gould.

Streisand is one of many singers who use [[teleprompters]] during their live performances. Streisand has defended her choice in using teleprompters to display lyrics and, sometimes, banter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/streisands-stagefright-prompted-by-forgotten-lyrics_1117130 |title=Barbra Streisand &amp;#124; Streisand's Stagefright Prompted By Forgotten Lyrics |publisher=Contactmusic |date=September 25, 2009 |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her first film was a reprise of her Broadway hit, ''[[Funny Girl (film)|Funny Girl]]'' (1968), an artistic and commercial success directed by Hollywood veteran [[William Wyler]].  Streisand won the 1968 [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for the role,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Funny Girl (1968)|url=http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/25128/Funny-Girl/articles.html|work=|[[Turner Classic Movies|tcm]]|accessdate=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; sharing it with [[Katharine Hepburn]] (''[[The Lion in Winter (1968 film)|The Lion in Winter]]''), the only time there has been a tie in this [[Academy Awards|Oscar]] category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heinemann|first=Sue|title=Timelines of American Women's History|year=1996|publisher=Perigee Trade|isbn=978-0399519864|page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her next two movies were also based on musicals, [[Jerry Herman]]'s ''[[Hello, Dolly!

During the 1970s, Streisand starred in several [[screwball comedies]], including ''[[What's Up, Doc? (1972 film)|What's Up, Doc?]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Main Event (1979 film)|The Main Event]]'' (1979), both co-starring [[Ryan O'Neal]], and ''[[For Pete's Sake (film)|For Pete's Sake]]'' (1974) with [[Michael Sarrazin]].  One of her most famous roles during this period was in the drama ''[[The Way We Were]]'' (1973) with [[Robert Redford]], for which she received an [[Academy Award]] nomination as Best Actress. She earned her second [[Academy Award]] for [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Best Original Song]] as composer (together with lyricist [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]]) for the song &quot;[[Evergreen (Love Theme from A Star Is Born)|Evergreen]]&quot;, from ''[[A Star Is Born (1976 film)|A Star Is Born]]'' in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|title=A Star Is Born|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/a-star-is-born-mw0000196532|work=allmusic.com|accessdate=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Along with [[Paul Newman]], [[Sidney Poitier]] and later [[Steve McQueen]], Streisand formed First Artists Production Company in 1969, so the actors could secure properties and develop movie projects for themselves. Streisand's initial outing with First Artists was ''[[Up the Sandbox]]'' (1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Art Isn't Easy|url=http://barbratimeless.com/2009firstartists.htm|accessdate=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From a period beginning in 1969 and ending in 1980, Streisand appeared in the annual motion picture exhibitors poll of Top 10 Box Office attractions a total of 10 times, often as the only woman on the list. After the commercially disappointing ''[[All Night Long (1981 film)|All Night Long]]'' in 1981, Streisand's film output decreased considerably. She has acted in only six films since.

Streisand produced a number of her own films, setting up Barwood Films in 1972. For ''[[Yentl (film)|Yentl]]'' (1983), she was producer, director, and star, an experience she repeated for ''[[The Prince of Tides]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Mirror Has Two Faces]]'' (1996). There was controversy when ''Yentl'' received five Academy Award nominations, but none for the major categories of Best Picture, Actress, or Director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmsite.org/aa83.html ''1983 Academy Awards Winners and History'']. Filmsite.com.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Prince of Tides'' received even more Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, but the director was not nominated. Streisand also scripted ''Yentl'', something she is not always given credit for. According to New York Times Editorial Page Editor [[Andrew Rosenthal]] in an [http://wbgo-web.streamguys.net/audio/onDemand.php?podcastID=688 interview] (story begins at minute 16) with Allan Wolper, &quot;the one thing that makes Barbra Streisand crazy is when nobody gives her the credit for having written ''Yentl''.&quot;

In 2004, Streisand made a return to film acting, after an eight-year hiatus, in the comedy ''[[Meet the Fockers]]'' (a sequel to ''[[Meet the Parents]]''), playing opposite [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Ben Stiller]], [[Blythe Danner]] and [[Robert De Niro]].

In December 2010, Streisand appeared in ''[[Little Fockers]]'', the third film from the [[Meet the Parents|''Meet the Parents'' trilogy]].  She reprised the role of Roz Focker alongside [[Dustin Hoffman]].

On January 4, 2011, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that Streisand was in negotiations to produce, direct, and star in a new film version of ''[[Gypsy (musical)|Gypsy]]''. In an interview with the ''New York Post'', Arthur Laurents said: &quot;We've talked about it a lot, and she knows what she's doing. She has my approval.&quot; He said that he would not write the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;Riedel, Michael.

On January 28, 2011, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' announced that Paramount Pictures has given the road-trip comedy ''[[My Mother's Curse]]'' the green light to begin shooting, with Streisand and [[Seth Rogen]] playing mother and son. [[Anne Fletcher]] is slated to direct the project with a script by [[Dan Fogelman]]. [[Lorne Michaels]] and [[John Goldwyn]] will produce it with [[Evan Goldberg]]. Executive producers include Streisand, Rogen, Fogelman, and [[David Ellison]], whose Skydance will co-finance the pic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/barbra-streisand-seth-rogen-star-94217 |title=EXCLUSIVE: Barbra Streisand, Seth Rogen to Star in 'My Mother's Curse' for Paramount |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |date=2011-01-28 |accessdate=2012-07-26 |first=Matthew |last=Belloni}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shooting began in spring of 2011 and wrapped in July. In August the [[Internet Movie Database]] began listing the film with the new title ''Guilt Trip''.

==Personal life==

===Marriages and family===
Streisand has been married twice. Her first husband was actor [[Elliott Gould]], to whom she was married from 1963 until 1971. They had one child, [[Jason Gould]], who appeared as her on-screen son in ''[[The Prince of Tides]]''. Her second husband is actor [[James Brolin]], whom she married on July 1, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schindehette|first=Susan|title=The Way They Were|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20125806,00.html|work=[[people]]|date=July 20, 1998| accessdate=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; While they have no children together, Brolin has two children from his first marriage, including Academy Award-nominated actor [[Josh Brolin]], and one child from his second marriage.

[[Jon Peters]]' daughters, [[Caleigh Peters]] and Skye Peters, are her god-daughters.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Name===
Streisand changed her name from Barbara to Barbra because, she said, &quot;I hated the name, but I refused to change it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barbra-archives.com/bjs_library/60s/rogue_streisand.html|title=The Mouse That Wails|work=Rogue|publisher=Barbra |date=November 1963|accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Streisand further explained, &quot;Well, I was 18 and I wanted to be unique, but I didn't want to change my name because that was too false. You know, people were saying you could be Joanie Sands, or something like that. [My middle name is Joan.] And I said, 'No, let's see, if I take out the 'a,' it's still 'Barbara,' but it's unique.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/08/08/sunday/main6753884.shtml|title=Her name is Barbra|work=[[CBS News]]|date=September 27, 2010|accessdate=2010-08-26| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100825050655/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/08/08/sunday/main6753884.shtml| archivedate= August 25, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1967 biography with a concert program said, &quot;the spelling of her first name is an instance of partial rebellion: she was advised to change her last name and retaliated by dropping an “a” from the first instead.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://barbra-archives.com/live/60s/hollywood_bowl_67_streisand.html|title=An Evening With Barbra Streisand|publisher=Barbra Archives|date=July 9, 1967|accessdate=2010-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
Streisand has long been an active supporter of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and many of their causes. Streisand said, &quot;The Democrats have always been the party of working people and minorities. I've always identified with the minorities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/BourbonStreet/6011/aoltranscript.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091027135459/http://www.geocities.com/BourbonStreet/6011/aoltranscript.html |archivedate=2009-10-27 |title=Transcript of Streisand's November 2, 1998 live chat on AOL |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=October 27, 2009 |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971, Streisand was one of the celebrities listed on [[Richard M. Nixon|President Richard Nixon]]'s infamous [[Master list of Nixon's political opponents|Enemies List]]. She also was romantically and politically linked to [[Canadian]] Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Klassen |first=Nicholas |url=http://ballastmag.com/2012/09/longing-for-a-suave-prime-minister/|title=Longing for a Suave Prime Minister |publisher=Ballast|date=2012-09-27 |accessdate=2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Streisand is a supporter of gay rights, and in 2008 helped raise funds in an unsuccessful attempt to defeat [[Proposition 8]] in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Barbra Streisand among host of stars to support gay marriage campaign in California|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1078505/Barbra-Streisand-host-stars-support-gay-marriage-campaign-California.html|publisher=Daily Mail Reporter|accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Streisand donated $1 million to the [[William J.

The Giving Back Fund claimed Streisand donated $11 million, which The Streisand Foundation distributed.

At Julien’s Auctions in October 2009, Streisand, a long-time collector of art and furniture, sold 526 items with all the proceeds going to her foundation. Items included a costume from ''Funny Lady'' and a vintage dental cabinet purchased by the performer at 18 years old. The sale’s most valuable lot was a painting by Kees van Dongen.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas, Sarah. &quot;[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/32797/in-the-air-star-ambitions/ In the Air: Star Ambitions].&quot;''[[Art+Auction]]'', October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2011 she agreed to sing at a fundraising gala for Israel Defence Forces charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.artsjournal.com/slippeddisc/2011/12/streisand-to-sing-for-israeli-army-charities.html |title=Streisand to sing for Israeli army charities |publisher=Artsjournal.com |date=2011-12-06 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==References in popular culture==

===In television===
One memorable parody of Streisand's iconic status has been on the sketch comedy show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in the recurring skit ''[[Coffee Talk]]'' where character [[Linda Richman]], played by [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], hosts a talk show dedicated to, among other things, the adoration of Streisand.  Streisand, in turn, made an unannounced guest appearance on the show, surprising Myers and guests, [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Roseanne Barr]].  Mike Myers also appeared as the Linda Richman character on stage with Streisand at her 1994 MGM Grand concert, as well as a few of the 1994 Streisand tour shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gliatto |first=Tom |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20107779,00.html |title=Oy!

Streisand is mentioned in the sitcom ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'', particularly by the character [[Jack McFarland]].  Songs made famous by Streisand, such as &quot;[[Papa, Can You Hear Me?]]&quot; from ''[[Yentl]]'' and &quot;[[Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man]]&quot; from ''[[The Broadway Album]]'' are reproduced by characters in the show. Also, in the episode &quot;Fagmalion&quot;, [[Will Truman|Will]] and [[Jack McFarland|Jack]] who are making over their &quot;gay-in-training&quot; Barry, make him recite &quot;[[Judy Garland|Judy]], [[Liza Minnelli|Liza]], Barbra, [[Bette Midler|Bette]], these are names I shant forget&quot;, as part of his &quot;gay&quot; affirmations. 

At least four episodes of the animated sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]'' refer to Streisand. Outside Springfield Elementary School, announcing [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]]'s jazz concert and noting tickets have been sold out, is an advertisement for a Streisand concert in the same venue for the following day, with tickets still on sale. In &quot;[[Fear of Flying (The Simpsons)|Fear of Flying]]&quot;, after [[Marge Simpson|Marge]] undergoes therapy, she informs the therapist that whenever she hears the wind blow, she'll hear it saying &quot;Lowenstein&quot;, Streisand's therapist character in ''[[The Prince of Tides]]'', even though Marge's therapist is named Zweig. Another reference comes in &quot;[[Sleeping with the Enemy (The Simpsons)|Sleeping with the Enemy]]&quot; when [[Bart Simpson|Bart]] exclaims after seeing Lisa make a snow-angel in a cake on the kitchen table, &quot;At least she's not singing Streisand&quot;, in reference to [[Nelson Muntz]] singing &quot;Papa Can You Hear Me?&quot; from ''[[Yentl]]'' earlier in the episode. In &quot;[[Simple Simpson]]&quot;, a patriotic country singer says that Streisand is unpatriotic and could be pleased by spitting on the flag and strangling a bald eagle.

Another enduring satirical reference is in the animated series ''[[South Park]]'', most notably in the episode &quot;[[Mecha-Streisand]]&quot;, where Streisand is portrayed as a self-important, evil, gigantic robotic dinosaur with a terrible singing voice about to conquer the universe before being defeated by [[Robert Smith (musician)|Robert Smith]] of [[The Cure]]. On another occasion, the [[Halloween]] episode &quot;[[Spookyfish]]&quot; is promoted for a week as being done in &quot;Spooky-Vision&quot;, which involves Streisand's face seen at times during the episode in the four corners of the screen. At the end of the feature film ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut]],'' her name is used as a powerful curse word, a gag repeated in the episode &quot;[[Osama bin Laden Has Farty Pants]]&quot;. The Mecha-Streisand character made a return in the Season 14 episodes &quot;[[200 (South Park)|200]]&quot; and &quot;[[201 (South Park)|201]]&quot;, as one of several celebrities the show had lampooned over the years.

In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode &quot;[[Mind Over Murder]]&quot;, [[Lois Griffin|Lois]] sings a cabaret act with &quot;[[Don't Rain on My Parade]]&quot;—originally sung by Streisand in ''[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]]''—only slowed down and jazzier, as an act of defiance to [[Peter Griffin|Peter]].  In &quot;[[Stewie Kills Lois]]&quot;, Peter receives life insurance after Lois' apparent death, and claims that he has more money than Streisand. This was followed by a cut scene showing Streisand blowing money out of her nose. In &quot;[[Wasted Talent]]&quot;, Streisand and husband James Brolin are shown sitting together at the dinner table, with Streisand remarking &quot;I'm glad I married a regular person and not a celebrity&quot;.

Streisand is referenced frequently on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] TV musical series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''. The character Rachel ([[Lea Michele]]) mentions that Streisand refused to alter her nose in order to become famous in the show's third episode &quot;[[Acafellas]]&quot;. Also, in the [[Sectionals|mid-season finale]] of ''Glee'', Rachel sings the Streisand anthem &quot;Don't Rain on My Parade&quot;. In the episode &quot;[[Hell-O (Glee)|Hell-O]]&quot;, she says that she will be heartbroken for life, &quot;Like Barbra in ''[[The Way We Were]]''.&quot; In the same episode, Jesse St. James ([[Jonathan Groff]]) criticizes Rachel's performance of &quot;Don't Rain on My Parade&quot; by saying that she &quot;lacked Barbra's emotional depth.&quot; 

In the episode &quot;[[Theatricality]]&quot;, Rachel is spying on the opposing team's dance rehearsal when the director, Shelby Corcoran ([[Idina Menzel]]), expresses dissatisfaction at the team's routine. She demonstrates how it's done with the title song from ''[[Funny Girl (film)|Funny Girl]]'', and Rachel, sitting in the audience, whispers to her friend, &quot;Exactly what I would have done—Barbra. I could do it in my sleep.&quot;  In the episode &quot;[[Grilled Cheesus]]&quot; Rachel sings Barbra's famous song from the movie [[Yentl]]—[[Papa, Can You Hear Me?]]—to help support Kurt's ([[Chris Colfer]]) dad Burt after undergoing a heart attack.  Rachel sang it in a park with Finn sitting at her side/in Burt Hummel's hospital room.  She told Finn that she &quot;wanted nothing to come between her and God, and [[Yentl]] sang it outside in the movie.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/10/06/glee-cast-performs-papa-can-you-hear-me/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | title=‘Glee' Cast Performs ‘Papa, Can You Hear Me?' | date=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the episode Born This Way Barbara is mentioned when Rachel is debating whether or not to get a nose job, Kurt Hummel and the rest of the glee club set up a &quot;Barbra-vention&quot; of a flashmob to the popular hit &quot;Barbra Streisand&quot; by Duck Sauce. 

The characters of Kurt and Rachel also sang the &quot;[[Happy Days Are Here Again|Get Happy/Happy Days are Here Again]]&quot; duet originally heard during Streisand's 1963 appearance with [[Judy Garland]] on [[The Judy Garland Show|Garland's weekly TV series]]. In the season three episode &quot;[[I Am Unicorn]],&quot; [[Kurt Hummel|Kurt]] sings Barbra Streisand's &quot;[[I'm the Greatest Star]]&quot; from the musical ''[[Funny Girl (musical)|Funny Girl]]'', stating &quot;[He] has permission from the woman herself,&quot; actually meaning Rachel Berry. When ''Glee'' won the prize for &quot;Best TV Series-Comedy Or Musical&quot; at the [[2010 Golden Globe Awards]], creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] quipped on stage, &quot;Thank you to the [[Hollywood Foreign Press Association|Hollywood Foreign Press]] and Miss Barbra Streisand.&quot;

In the sitcom ''[[The Nanny]]'', Streisand is viewed as a divine figure by Fran Fine throughout the sitcom's run. When asked by her boss who she would save if her mother and Streisand were drowning, Fran replies &quot;I'd save Ma, Barbra can walk on water,&quot; Another example is in &quot;The Passed-Over Story,&quot; when Fran hears that Barbra Streisand and James Brolin will be arriving at the airport, Fran runs towards the door yelling &quot;It's the miracle of Passover, the Messiah is coming&quot;.

===On film===
In movies, Streisand is remembered as the favorite of the character Howard Brackett, played by [[Kevin Kline]], who finally admits to being gay while standing at the altar in the 1997 romantic comedy ''[[In &amp; Out]]''. His unfortunate bride-to-be, played by [[Joan Cusack]], cries out in frustration to family and friends present, &quot;Does anybody here KNOW how many times I've had to sit through ''[[Funny Lady]]''?&quot; In an earlier scene, Howard is taunted by a friend during an argument at a bar with a jeering, &quot;The studio thought that Barbra was too ol-l-ld to play ''[[Yentl]]''.&quot; The film also mentions the album ''[[Color Me Barbra]]''. Barbra's signature tune, &quot;People&quot;, is played by a school orchestra in honor of teacher Howard as the story wraps at the end of the credits.  This and similar references refer to her popularity among gay men.

In the 1996 comedy &quot;[[The Associate]]&quot;, [[Whoopi Goldberg]] plays a business woman, Laurel Ayers, who creates a business associate, Robert S. Cutty, who is said to have known and dated Streisand. In addition to having an autographed picture of Streisand in her office, Ayers also has a cross-dressing friend who dresses up to resemble Streisand throughout the film.

The characters Carla and Connie, as aspiring song-and-dance acts in the 2004 comedy ''[[Connie and Carla]]'', include four Streisand references.  They sing &quot;[[Papa, Can You Hear Me?]]&quot; and &quot;[[Memory (Cats song)|Memory]]&quot; at an airport lounge and &quot;[[Don't Rain on My Parade]]&quot; onstage in a gay bar, and talk about the plot of ''[[Yentl]]'' at the climax of the film after they ask how many in their audience have seen the movie (everyone raised their hands).

===In music===
Sound clips of Streisand's heated exchange with a supporter of former U.S. president [[George W. Bush]] were sampled in the 2009 [[Lucian Piane]] dance song &quot;[[Bale Out]]&quot;, making it sound as if she were arguing with actor [[Christian Bale]] (whose recorded outbursts during the filming of ''[[Christian Bale#Terminator Salvation incident|Terminator Salvation]]'' were the centerpiece of the song).&lt;ref name=&quot;lowe&quot;&gt;{{cite news   | last =Lowe  | first =Andy  | title =Christian Bale flips out on T4 set: Yes, yes.

&quot;[[Barbra Streisand (song)|Barbra Streisand]]&quot; is a disco house song by American-Canadian DJ duo [[Duck Sauce]]. It was released on September 10, 2010. The song peaked at number one in Poland, Belgium, the Netherlands, Finland, Switzerland and Austria. It became a top ten hit in Australia, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and the UK.

===On stage===
Daniel Stern's 2003 Off-Broadway play ''Barbra's Wedding'' was set against the backdrop of Streisand's 1998 wedding to James Brolin.

===&quot;Streisand effect&quot;===
{{main|Streisand effect}}
