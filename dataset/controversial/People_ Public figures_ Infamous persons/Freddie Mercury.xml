'''Freddie Mercury''' (born '''Farrokh Bulsara''' ([[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]: ફરોખ બલ્સારા‌); 5 September 1946 – 24 November 1991)&lt;ref name=&quot;mr-mercury.co.uk&quot;&gt;[http://mr-mercury.co.uk/Images/Birthcertificatefreddie.jpg Birth certificate] mr-mercury.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;inourstar.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inoutstar.com/news/Freddie-Mercury-real-name-Farrokh-Bulsara-1876.html |title=Freddie Mercury (real name Farrokh Bulsara) Biography |publisher=Inout Star |accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a British musician,&lt;!-- [[MOS:BIO]] – Nationality: the country of which the person was a citizen when the person became notable. Mercury, as is noted throughout the article, became notable as a British citizen/singer --&gt; singer and songwriter, best known as the lead vocalist and lyricist of the rock band [[Queen (band)|Queen]]. As a performer, he was known for his flamboyant stage persona and powerful vocals over a four-octave range.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Independent|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20110615085921/http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article675005.ece Dance: Deux the fandango] via Internet Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/6027/32782 ''RollingStone.com'' – 100 Greatest Singers of All Time].&lt;/ref&gt; As a songwriter, Mercury composed many hits for Queen, including &quot;[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]&quot;, &quot;[[Killer Queen]]&quot;, &quot;[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody to Love]]&quot;, &quot;[[Don't Stop Me Now]]&quot;, &quot;[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]&quot; and &quot;[[We Are the Champions]]&quot;. In addition to his work with Queen, he led a solo career, and also occasionally served as a producer and guest musician (piano or vocals) for other artists. He died of [[bronchopneumonia]] brought on by [[AIDS]] on 24 November 1991, only one day after publicly acknowledging he had the disease.

Mercury was a [[Parsi]] born in [[Zanzibar]] and grew up there and in India until his mid-teens. He has been referred to as &quot;[[British Asian|Britain's first Asian]] rock star&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Januszczak_1996&quot;/&gt; In 2002, Mercury was placed at number 58 in the BBC's poll of the [[100 Greatest Britons]], in 2006, ''[[Time Asia]]'' named him one of the most influential Asian heroes of the past 60 years,&lt;ref name = &quot;Fitzpatrick_2006&quot;/&gt; and he continues to be voted one of the greatest singers in the history of popular music. In 2005, a poll organised by ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' and [[MTV2]] saw Mercury voted the greatest male singer of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amiannoying.com/(S(wwb0os55dj4oeh45sg3hgt3g))/collection.aspx?collection=534 list] of ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]'' and [[MTV2|MTV2's]] &quot;22 Greatest Voices&quot; (archived at www.amiannoying.com).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' editors ranked him number 18 on their list of the 100 greatest singers of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone.com&quot;/&gt;  In 2009, a ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'' poll saw him voted the greatest rock singer of all time.&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock]]'', &quot;50 Greatest Singers in Rock&quot;, May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allmusic]] has characterised Mercury as &quot;one of rock's greatest all-time entertainers&quot;, who possessed &quot;one of the greatest voices in all of music&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Greg |first=Prato |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4899|pure_url=yes}} |title=Freddie Mercury biography |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Mercury was born in the [[British protectorate]] of [[Zanzibar]], East Africa (now part of [[Tanzania]]). His parents, Bomi and Jer Bulsara,{{Ref label|Bulsara|a|none}} were [[Parsi]]s from the [[Gujarat]] region of the then province of [[Bombay Presidency]] in [[British Raj|British India]].&lt;ref name = &quot;LindaB_2000&quot;/&gt;{{Ref label|Parsis|b|none}} The family surname is derived from the town of Bulsar (also known as [[Valsad]]) in southern [[Gujarat]]. As Parsis, Mercury and his family practised the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sky|1992|pp=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bulsara family had moved to Zanzibar so that his father could continue his job as a cashier at the [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|British Colonial Office]]. He had a younger sister, Kashmira.&lt;ref name=&quot;Das_2000&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Das|2000}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Freddie Mercury's birthplace.jpg|thumb|upright|The house in Zanzibar where Mercury lived in his early years]]

Mercury spent the bulk of his childhood in India and began taking piano lessons at the age of seven.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queenonline.com/history/35/ Queen Online – History: Freddie Mercury]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1954, at the age of eight, Mercury was sent to study at [[St. Peter's Boys School|St. Peter's School]], a British-style boarding school for boys in [[Panchgani]] near Bombay (now [[Mumbai]]), India.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones_1998&quot;  &gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his formative musical influences at the time was [[Bollywood]] singer [[Lata Mangeshkar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Liam|title=Farrokh Bulsara|url=http://www.time.com/time/asia/2006/heroes/at_bulsara.html|work=[[Time (magazine){{!}}Time]]|accessdate=28 April 2012|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110523230337/http://www.time.com/time/asia/2006/heroes/at_bulsara.html|archivedate=23 May 2011|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aged 12, he formed a school band, [[The Hectics]], and [[cover version|covered]] [[rock and roll]] artists such as [[Cliff Richard]] and [[Little Richard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodkinson_2004&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hodkinson|2004|pp=2,61}}.&lt;/ref&gt; A friend from the time recalls that he had &quot;an uncanny ability to listen to the radio and replay what he heard on piano&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Donnell_2005&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|O'Donnell|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was also at St. Peter's where he began to call himself &quot;Freddie&quot;. Mercury remained in India, living with his grandmother and aunt until he completed his education at [[St. Mary's School, Mumbai|St. Mary's School]], Bombay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nowpublic.com/culture/tribute-king-queen-freddie-mercury |title=Tribute to King of &quot;Queen&quot; Freddie Mercury &amp;#124; NowPublic News Coverage |publisher=Nowpublic.com |accessdate=22 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 17, Mercury and his family fled from Zanzibar for safety reasons due to the 1964 [[Zanzibar Revolution]],&lt;ref name = &quot;Januszczak_1996&quot;/&gt; in which thousands of Arabs and Indians were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Plekhanov|2004|p=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved into a small house in [[Feltham]], [[Middlesex]], England. Mercury enrolled at [[Isleworth]] Polytechnic (now [[West Thames College]]) in [[West (London sub region)|West London]] where he studied art. He ultimately earned a Diploma in Art and Graphic Design at [[Ealing Art College]], later using these skills to design the Queen crest. A British citizen at birth, Mercury remained so for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones_1998&quot;  &gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following graduation, Mercury joined a series of bands and sold second-hand clothes in the [[Kensington Market, London|Kensington Market]] in London. He also held a job at [[Heathrow Airport]]. Friends from the time remember him as a quiet and shy young man who showed a great deal of interest in music.&lt;ref name=student&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|1996|pp=1,10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969 he joined the band [[Ibex (band)|Ibex]], later renamed Wreckage. When this band failed to take off, he joined a second band called Sour Milk Sea. However, by early 1970 this group had broken up as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Skala_2006&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Skala|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1970, Mercury joined guitarist [[Brian May]] and drummer [[Roger Taylor (Queen drummer)|Roger Taylor]] who had previously been in a band called [[Smile (band)|Smile]]. Despite reservations from the other members, Mercury chose the name &quot;Queen&quot; for the new band. He later said about the band's name, &quot;I was certainly aware of the gay connotations, but that was just one facet of it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Highleyman_2005&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Highleyman|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At about the same time, he changed his surname, Bulsara, to Mercury.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|SutcliffeHinceMack|2009|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
=== Singer ===
[[File:FreddieMercurySinging1978.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Freddie Mercury in 1978]]
[[File:Freddie Mercury range.svg|thumb|right|100px|Freddie Mercury's vocal range]]
Although Mercury's speaking [[voice]] naturally fell in the [[baritone]] range, he delivered most songs in the [[tenor]] range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |author=Evans, David; Peter Freestone |title=Freddie Mercury: an intimate memoir by the man who knew him best |publisher=Omnibus |location=London |year=2001 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=AH8zZsbmB98C&amp;pg=PA108#v=onepage&amp;q|pages= 108–9 |isbn=0-7119-8674-6 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His vocal range extended from [[Bass (voice)|bass]] low F ([[Scientific pitch notation|F2]]) to [[soprano]] high F (F6).&lt;ref name=&quot;soto&quot;&gt;{{Citation|last=Soto-Morettini|first=D.|title=Popular Singing: A Practical Guide To: Pop, Jazz, Blues, Rock, Country and Gospel|year=2006|publisher=A &amp; C Black|isbn=978-0713672664}}&lt;/ref&gt; He could [[Belt (music)|belt]] up to [[tenor]] high F (F5).&lt;ref name=&quot;soto&quot;/&gt; Biographer [[David Bret]] described his voice as &quot;escalating within a few bars from a deep, throaty rock-growl to tender, vibrant tenor, then on to a high-pitched, perfect [[coloratura]], pure and crystalline in the upper reaches&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bret_1996_26&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bret|1996|p=26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Spanish [[soprano]] [[Montserrat Caballé]], with whom Mercury recorded an album, expressed her opinion that &quot;the difference between Freddie and almost all the other rock stars was that he was selling the voice&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cain_2006&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cain|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; She adds, &quot;His technique was astonishing. No problem of [[tempo]], he sung with an incisive sense of rhythm, his vocal placement was very good and he was able to glide effortlessly from a register to another. He also had a great musicality. His phrasing was subtle, delicate and sweet or energetic and slamming. He was able to find the right colouring or expressive nuance for each word.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;soto&quot;/&gt; As Queen's career progressed, he would increasingly alter the highest notes of their songs when live, often harmonising with seconds, thirds or fifths instead. Mercury was said to have &quot;the rawest [[vocal fold nodules]]&quot; and claimed never to have had any formal vocal training.&lt;ref name=Rush2&gt;{{harvnb|Rush|1977b}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Songwriter ===
Mercury wrote 10 of the 17 songs on Queen's ''[[Greatest Hits (Queen album)|Greatest Hits]]'' album: &quot;[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]&quot;, &quot;[[Seven Seas of Rhye]]&quot;, &quot;[[Killer Queen]]&quot;, &quot;[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody to Love]]&quot;, &quot;[[Good Old-Fashioned Lover Boy]]&quot;, &quot;[[We Are the Champions]]&quot;, &quot;[[Bicycle Race]]&quot;, &quot;[[Don't Stop Me Now]]&quot;, &quot;[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]&quot; and &quot;[[Play the Game (song)|Play the Game]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/album/greatest-hits-vols-1-2-r220568 Queen - Greatest Hits, Vols. 1] Allmusic.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable aspect of his songwriting involved the wide range of genres that he used, which included, among other styles, [[rockabilly]], [[progressive rock]], [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]], [[gospel music|gospel]] and [[disco]]. As he explained in a 1986 interview, &quot;I hate doing the same thing again and again and again. I like to see what's happening now in music, film and theatre and incorporate all of those things.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Wenner_2001&quot;/&gt; Compared to many popular songwriters, Mercury also tended to write musically complex material. For example, &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot; is acyclic in structure and comprises dozens of [[chord (music)|chords]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Queen_1992&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aledort_2003&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Aledort|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote six songs from ''[[Queen II]]'' which deal with multiple key changes and complex material. &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot;, on the other hand, contains only a few chords. Despite the fact that Mercury often wrote very intricate [[harmonies]], he also claimed that he could barely read music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coleman_1981&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Coleman|1981}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote most of his songs on the piano and used a wide variety of different key signatures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Queen_1992&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Queen|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Live performer ===

[[File:Queen 1984 0009.jpg|thumb|left|172px|Mercury performing live in 1984]]
Mercury was noted for his live performances, which were often delivered to stadium audiences around the world. He displayed a highly theatrical style that often evoked a great deal of participation from the crowd. A writer for ''[[The Spectator]]'' described him as &quot;a performer out to tease, shock and ultimately charm his audience with various extravagant versions of himself&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blaikie_1996&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Blaikie|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Bowie]], who performed at the [[Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert]] and recorded the song &quot;[[Under Pressure]]&quot; with Queen, praised Mercury's performance style, saying: &quot;Of all the more theatrical rock performers, Freddie took it further than the rest... he took it over the edge. And of course, I always admired a man who wears tights. I only saw him in concert once and as they say, he was definitely a man who could hold an audience in the palm of his hand.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ressner_1992&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Ressner|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen guitarist Brian May wrote that Mercury could make &quot;the last person at the back of the furthest stand in a stadium feel that he was connected.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/09/happy-birthday-freddie-mercury.html Happy birthday, Freddie Mercury]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Mercury's most notable performances with Queen took place at [[Live Aid]] in 1985, during which the entire stadium audience of 72,000 people clapped, sang and swayed in unison. Queen's performance at the event has since been voted by a group of music executives as the greatest live performance in the history of rock music. The results were aired on a television program called &quot;The World's Greatest Gigs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Minchin_2005&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Minchin|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_2005b&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|BBC News|2005b}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In reviewing Live Aid in 2005, one critic wrote, &quot;Those who compile lists of Great Rock Frontmen and award the top spots to [[Mick Jagger]], [[Robert Plant]], etc all are guilty of a terrible oversight. Freddie, as evidenced by his [[Dionysian]] Live Aid performance, was easily the most godlike of them all.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Harris_2005&quot;/&gt;

Over the course of his career, Mercury performed an estimated 700 concerts in countries around the world with Queen. A notable aspect of Queen concerts was the large scale involved.&lt;ref name = &quot;Wenner_2001&quot;/&gt; He once explained, &quot;We're the [[Cecil B. DeMille]] of rock and roll, always wanting to do things bigger and better.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wenner_2001&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Wenner|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The band was the first ever to play in South American stadiums, breaking worldwide records for concert attendance in the [[Morumbi Stadium]] in São Paulo in 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bret_1996_91&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bret|1996|p=91}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, Queen also played behind the [[Iron Curtain]] when they performed to a crowd of 80,000 in [[Budapest]], in what was one of the biggest rock concerts ever held in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=4SQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT85&amp;lpg=PT85&amp;dq=queen+80,000+budapest+1986 Billboard – 16 Aug 1986] Retrieved 17 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury's final live performance with Queen took place on 9 August 1986 at [[Knebworth Park]] in England and drew an attendance estimated as high as 300,000.&lt;ref name=knebworth&gt;{{harvnb|Jones|1999}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Instrumentalist ===
[[File:Queen 1984 012.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Freddie Mercury playing guitar during a live concert with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] in Frankfurt, Germany, 1984.]]

As a young boy in India, Mercury received formal piano training up to the age of nine. Later on, while living in London, he learned guitar. Much of the music he liked was guitar-oriented: his favourite artists at the time were [[The Who]], [[The Beatles]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[David Bowie]], and [[Led Zeppelin]]. He was often self-deprecating about his own skills on both instruments and from the early 1980s onward began extensively using guest keyboardists for both Queen and his solo career. Most notably, he enlisted [[Fred Mandel]] (a Canadian musician who also worked for [[Pink Floyd]], [[Elton John]] and [[Supertramp]]) for his first solo project, and from 1985 onward collaborated with [[Mike Moran (music producer)|Mike Moran]] (in the studio) and [[Spike Edney]] (in concert), leaving most of the keyboard work exclusively to them.

Mercury played the piano in many of Queen's most popular songs, including &quot;[[Killer Queen]]&quot;, &quot;[[Bohemian Rhapsody]]&quot;, &quot;[[Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy]]&quot;, &quot;[[We Are the Champions]]&quot;, &quot;[[Somebody to Love (Queen song)|Somebody To Love]]&quot; and &quot;[[Don't Stop Me Now]]&quot;. He used concert [[grand piano]]s and, occasionally, other keyboard instruments such as the [[harpsichord]]. From 1980 onward, he also made frequent use of synthesisers in the studio. Queen guitarist [[Brian May]] claims that Mercury was unimpressed with his own abilities at the piano and used the instrument less over time because he wanted to walk around onstage and entertain the audience.&lt;ref name = &quot;Longfellow_2006&quot;/&gt; Although he wrote many lines for the guitar, Mercury possessed only rudimentary skills on the instrument. Songs like &quot;[[Ogre Battle (song)|Ogre Battle]]&quot; and &quot;[[Crazy Little Thing Called Love]]&quot; were composed on the guitar; the latter featured Mercury playing [[acoustic guitar]] both onstage and in the studio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queenonline.com/en/the-band/interviews/queen/circus-1980/ Lights! Action! Sound! It's That Crazy Little Thing Called Queen] Circus Magazine. Retrieved 29 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Solo career ===
In addition to his work with Queen, Mercury put out two solo albums and several singles. Although his solo work was not as commercially successful as most Queen albums, the two off-Queen albums and several of the singles debuted in the top 10 of the [[UK Album Charts]]. His first solo effort involved his contribution to the [[Richard Wolf|Richard &quot;Wolfie&quot; Wolf]] mix of ''Love Kills'' on the 1984 album (the song also used as the end title theme for National Lampoon's &quot;Loaded Weapon&quot;) and new soundtrack to the 1926 [[Fritz Lang]] film ''[[Metropolis (film)|Metropolis]]''. The song, produced by [[Giorgio Moroder]], debuted at the number 10 position in the UK charts.&lt;ref name = &quot;ReesCrampton_1999_809&quot;/&gt;

Mercury's two full albums outside the band were ''[[Mr. Bad Guy]]'' (1985) and ''[[Barcelona (album)|Barcelona]]'' (1988). The former is a pop-oriented album that emphasises disco and dance music. &quot;Barcelona&quot; was recorded and performed with the opera singer [[Montserrat Caballé]], whom he had long admired. ''Mr. Bad Guy'' debuted in the top ten of the [[UK Album Charts]].&lt;ref name = &quot;ReesCrampton_1999_809&quot;/&gt; In 1993, a remix of &quot;[[Living on My Own]]&quot;, a single from the album, reached the No.1 position on the [[UK Singles Charts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReesCrampton_1999_811&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Rees|Crampton|1999|p=811}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The song also garnered Mercury a posthumous [[Ivor Novello Award]]. Allmusic critic Eduardo Rivadavia describes ''Mr. Bad Guy'' as &quot;outstanding from start to finish&quot; and expressed his view that Mercury &quot;did a commendable job of stretching into uncharted territory&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rivadavia_notdated&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Rivadavia|&amp;lt;not dated&amp;gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the album is heavily synthesiser-driven in a way that is not characteristic of previous Queen albums.

His second album, ''[[Barcelona (album)|Barcelona]]'', recorded with [[Spaniards|Spanish]] [[soprano]] [[Montserrat Caballé]], combines elements of popular music and opera. Many critics were uncertain what to make of the album; one referred to it as &quot;the most bizarre CD of the year&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradley_1992&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bradley|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The album was a commercial success,&lt;ref&gt;Larkin, Colin (1998) ''The encyclopedia of popular music: Louvin, Charlie – Paul, Clarence, Volume 5'' Page 3633.

In addition to the two solo albums, Mercury released several singles, including his own version of the hit [[The Great Pretender]] by [[The Platters]], which debuted at number five in the UK in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReesCrampton_1999_809&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Rees|Crampton|1999|p=809}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, a compilation album featuring Mercury's solo work was released in the UK in honour of what would have been his 60th birthday.

== Personal life ==
[[File:QueenPerforming1978.jpg‎|thumb|Queen in New Haven, Connecticut, US in November 1978.]]

=== Relationships ===
In the early 1970s Mercury had a long-term relationship with Mary Austin, whom he had met through guitarist [[Brian May]]. He lived with Austin for several years in [[West Kensington]]. By the mid-1970s, however, the singer had begun an affair with a male American record executive at [[Elektra Records]], which ultimately resulted in the end of his relationship with Austin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Teckman_2004_part2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Teckman|2004}}, part 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury and Austin nevertheless remained close friends through the years, with Mercury often referring to her as his only true friend. In a 1985 interview, Mercury said of Austin, &quot;All my lovers asked me why they couldn't replace Mary [Austin], but it's simply impossible. The only friend I've got is Mary and I don't want anybody else. To me, she was my common-law wife. To me, it was a marriage. We believe in each other, that's enough for me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hauptfuhrer_1977&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hauptfuhrer|1977}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote several songs about Austin, the most notable of which is &quot;[[Love of My Life (Queen song)|Love of My Life]]&quot;. In his will, Mercury left his London home to Austin, rather than his then partner Jim Hutton, saying, &quot;You would have been my wife and it would have been yours anyway&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Austin |first=Mary |subject=Freddie Mercury  |interviewer=Midge Ure |title=The Mysterious Mr Mercury  |url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0171x1k |program=[[BBC]] Radio 4  |date=12 November 2011 |accessdate=12 November 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mercury was also the godfather of Mary's oldest son, Richard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Longfellow_2006&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Longfellow|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early to mid '80s, he was romantically involved with [[Barbara Valentin]], an Austrian actress,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Freddie_Mercury_-_11-25-1991_-_The_Star_-_AIDS_Kills_The_King_of_Rock |title=The Star – AIDS Kills The King of Rock |publisher=Queenarchives.com |date=25 November 1991 |accessdate=9 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is featured in the video for &quot;[[It's a Hard Life]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Freddie's Loves (Channel 5) documentary&lt;/ref&gt; By 1985, he began another long-term relationship with hairdresser Jim Hutton (1949-2010). Hutton, who was tested HIV-positive in 1990,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hutton_1994&quot;/&gt; lived with Mercury for the last six years of his life, nursed him during his illness, and was present at his bedside when he died. Hutton claimed that Mercury died wearing a wedding band that Hutton had given him.&lt;ref name = &quot;Hutton_1994&quot;/&gt; Hutton died from cancer on 1 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/partner-of-queen-star-freddie-buried-1997689.html |title=Partner of Queen star Freddie buried | last = Sweeney | first = Ken | newspaper=Irish Independent | location = Dublin |date = 4 January 2010 | accessdate =27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sexual orientation ===
Mercury was an acknowledged bisexual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hodkinson_2004&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=otd/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Robert Urban|last=Robert Urban|title=Ragged Blade Reviews: Queen's Freddie Mercury and his Legacy|url=http://www.raggedblade.com/reviews/000329.html|accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some critics claimed he hid his sexual orientation from the public,&lt;ref name=&quot;Januszczak_1996&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Januszczak|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cain_2006&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Landesman_2006&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Landesman|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; others claimed he was &quot;openly gay&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Fitzpatrick_2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;BBC_2006&quot;/&gt; In December 1974, when asked directly, &quot;So how about being bent?&quot; by the ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'', Mercury replied, &quot;You're a crafty cow. Let's put it this way; there were times when I was young and green. It's a thing schoolboys go through. I've had my share of schoolboy pranks. I'm not going to elaborate further.&quot;  Homosexuality was legalised in the United Kingdom in 1967, only seven years earlier. In the 1980s, he would often distance himself from his partner, Jim Hutton, during public events.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hutton_1994&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hutton|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, John Marshall of ''[[Gay Times]]'' expressed the following opinion: &quot;[Mercury] was a 'scene-queen', not afraid to publicly express his gayness but unwilling to analyse or justify his 'lifestyle' ... It was as if Freddie Mercury was saying to the world, 'I am what I am. So what?' And that in itself for some was a statement.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{harvnb|Urban|&amp;nt;not dated&amp;gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; A writer for a gay online newspaper felt that audiences may have been overly naïve about the matter: &quot;While in many respects he was overtly [[queer]] his whole career (&quot;I am as gay as a [[Narcissus (plant)|daffodil]], my dear&quot; being one of his most famous quotes), his sexual orientation seemed to pass over the heads of scrutinising audiences and pundits (both gay and straight) for decades&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Urban_notdated&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Urban|&amp;lt;not dated&amp;gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personality ===
Although he cultivated a flamboyant stage personality, Mercury was a very shy and retiring man in person, particularly around people he did not know well.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Donnell_2005&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Cain_2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{harvnb|Das|2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He also granted very few interviews. Mercury once said of himself: &quot;When I'm performing I'm an [[extrovert]], yet inside I'm a completely different man.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Myers_1991&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Myers|1991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While on stage, Mercury basked in the love from the audience, which was famously noted by [[Kurt Cobain]], in his suicide note, when he wrote of how he both admired and envied Mercury for being able to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;RSBestSingers&quot;&gt;[http://www.rollingstone.com/music/photos/rolling-stone-readers-pick-the-best-lead-singers-of-all-time-20110412/2-freddie-mercury-0762142 Rolling Stone Readers Pick the Best Lead Singers of All Time (2.Freddie Mercury)] Rolling Stone.

== Criticism and controversy ==
=== HIV ===
Mercury did not disclose his HIV status to the public for several years, and it has been suggested that he could have made a contribution to AIDS awareness by speaking earlier about his situation and his fight against the disease.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{harvnb|Ressner|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sky_1992_163&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Sky|1992|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other controversies ===
Queen were widely criticised when they broke a United Nations [[Foreign relations of apartheid South Africa#Isolation|cultural boycott]] in 1984 by performing a series of shows at [[Sun City, North West|Sun City]], an entertainment complex in [[Bophuthatswana]], a [[bantustan|homeland]] of (then) [[apartheid]] South Africa. As a result of these shows, Queen was placed on a United Nations list of artists who broke the boycott and was widely criticised in magazines such as the ''[[NME]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harris_2005&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Harris|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A further controversy ensued in August 2006, when an organisation calling itself the Islamic Mobilization and Propagation petitioned the [[Zanzibar]] government's culture ministry, demanding that a large-scale celebration of what would have been Mercury's sixtieth birthday be cancelled. The organisation issued several complaints about the planned celebrations, including that Mercury was not a true Zanzibari and that he was gay, which is not in accordance with their interpretation of [[sharia]]. The organisation claimed that &quot;associating Mercury with Zanzibar degrades our island as a place of Islam&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC_2006&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|BBC News|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The planned celebration was cancelled.

== Illness and death == &lt;!-- ****NOTE**** Pay attention to how this article uses&lt;ref&gt; ****NOTE**** --&gt;
According to his partner Jim Hutton, Mercury was diagnosed with AIDS shortly after Easter of 1987.&lt;ref name = &quot;Teeman_2006&quot;/&gt; Around that time, Mercury claimed in an interview to have tested negative for HIV.&lt;ref name = &quot;Cain_2006&quot;/&gt; Despite the denials, the British press pursued the rampant rumours over the next few years, fuelled by Mercury's increasingly gaunt appearance, Queen's absence from touring, and reports from former lovers to various tabloid journals – by 1990 the rumours about Mercury's health were rife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bret_1996_138&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bret|1996|p=138}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[List of BRIT Awards ceremonies#1990|1990]] [[Brit Award]]s held at the [[Dominion Theatre]], London on 18 February, Mercury made his final public appearance on stage when he joined the rest of Queen to collect the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/events/brit_awards/freddy.htm The Highs and Lows of the Brit Awards].

However, Mercury and his inner circle of colleagues and friends, whom he felt he could trust, continually denied the stories, even after one front page article published on 29 April 1991, which showed Mercury appearing very haggard in what was by then a rare public appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cloudcuckooland.biz/mercurysun1991.jpg Tragic Face of Freddie Mercury] ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Brian May confirmed in a 1993 interview that Mercury had informed the band of his illness much earlier.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queenarchives.com/index.php?title=Brian_May_-_04-02-1993_-_Sacramento_Bee Heir Apparent With Freddie Mercury Dead And Queen Disbanded, Brian May Carries On The Tradition] Sacramento Bee.

After the conclusion of his work with Queen in June 1991, Mercury retired to his home in [[Kensington]]. His former partner, Mary Austin, had been a particular comfort in his final years, and in the last few weeks of his life made regular visits to his home to look after him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Austin&quot;/&gt; Near the end of his life, Mercury was starting to lose his sight, and his deterioration was so overpowering he could not get out of bed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Austin&quot;/&gt; Due to his worsening condition, Mercury decided to hasten his death by refusing to take his medication, and just continued taking pain killers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Austin&quot;&gt;[http://www.freddie.ru/e/archives/ok/ Mary Austin Shares Her Memories – March, 17th 2000] OK!

On 22 November 1991, Mercury called Queen's manager Jim Beach over to his Kensington home, to discuss a public statement. The next day, 23 November, the following announcement was made to the international press on behalf of Mercury:&lt;ref name=&quot;Bret_1996_179&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bret|1996|p=179}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his will, Mercury left the vast majority of his wealth, including his home and recording royalties, to Mary Austin, and the remainder to his parents and sister. He further left £500,000 to his chef Joe Fanelli, £500,000 to his personal assistant Peter Freestone, £100,000 to his driver Terry Giddings, and £500,000 to Jim Hutton.&lt;ref name = &quot;Wigg_2000&quot;/&gt;

== Legacy ==
=== Continued popularity ===
The extent to which Mercury's death may have enhanced Queen's popularity is not clear. In the United States, where Queen's popularity had lagged in the 1980s, sales of Queen albums went up dramatically in 1992, the year following his death.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA_2007&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|RIAA|2007}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 one American critic noted, &quot;What cynics call the 'dead star' factor had come into play—Queen is in the middle of a major resurgence&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown_1992&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The movie ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'', which featured &quot;Bohemian Rhapsody&quot;, also came out in 1992. According to the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], Queen have sold 34.5&amp;nbsp;million albums in the United States, about half of which have been sold since Mercury's death in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblTopArt |title=Gold &amp; Platinum – 22&amp;nbsp;November&amp;nbsp;2009 |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=22 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the first major rock star to die of AIDS, Mercury's death represented a very important event in the disease's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|National AIDS Trust|2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1992, the remaining members of Queen founded [[The Mercury Phoenix Trust]] and organised ''[[The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert|The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert for AIDS Awareness]]'' to celebrate the life and legacy of Mercury and raise money for AIDS research, which took place on 20 April 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stothard_1992&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stothard|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Mercury Phoenix Trust]] has since raised millions of pounds for various AIDS charities.

=== Appearances in lists of influential individuals ===
Several popularity polls conducted over the past decade indicate that Freddie Mercury's reputation may in fact have been enhanced since his death. For instance, in a 2002 vote to determine whom the UK public considers the greatest British people in history, Mercury was ranked number 58 in the list of the &quot;[[100 Greatest Britons]]&quot;, broadcast by the BBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2208671.stm |title=BBC – 100 great British heroes |publisher=BBC News  |date=21 August 2002 |accessdate=11 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was further listed at the 52nd spot in a 2007 Japanese national survey of the 100 most &quot;influential heroes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;James_2007&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|&quot;James&quot;|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that he had been criticised by gay activists for hiding his HIV status, author Paul Russell included Mercury in his book &quot;The Gay 100: A Ranking of the Most Influential Gay Men and Lesbians, Past and Present.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Russell_2002&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Russell|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other entertainers on Russell's list included [[Liberace]] and [[Rock Hudson]]. In 2006, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Asia]]'' magazine named him as one of the most influential Asian heroes of the past 60 years: The article credited Mercury with having &quot;duplicated in popular music what other Indians—such as [[Salman Rushdie]] and [[Vikram Seth]] – have done in literature: taking the coloniser's art form and representing it in a manner richer and more dazzling than many Anglophones thought possible.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Fitzpatrick_2006&quot;/&gt; In 2008, ''Rolling Stone'' magazine ranked Mercury No.18 in its list of the &quot;Top 100 Singers Of All Time&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone.com&quot;/&gt;
