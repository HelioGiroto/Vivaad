'''Pia Merete Kjærsgaard''' ({{IPA-da|ˈpiːæ ˈkæɐ̯ˀsɡɒːˀ}}; born February 23, 1947) is a [[Denmark|Danish]] politician. She is a co-founder and current leader of the [[Danish People's Party]], a [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]], [[national conservative]] political party in Denmark. She has become one of the best-known politicians in Denmark during recent years, both for her vocal and unwavering stance against [[multiculturalism]] and immigration, and for her parliamentary support for the center-right governments of [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] and [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]] from 2001 to 2011. Her success has been an inspiration for anti-immigration and anti-islamic movements through out Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Stanners|url=http://cphpost.dk/news/international/how-pia%E2%80%99s-influence-spread-across-europe|date=August 16, 2012 - 13:07|title=Pia Kjærsgaard’s impact extended far beyond the Danish borders that she fought so hard to keep closed|newspaper=Copenhagen post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 7 2012, Kjærsgaard announced her resignation from the leader position of the [[Danish People's Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Venderby|first=Christian|title=Pia Kjærdsgaard går af som partiformand|url=http://borsen.dk/nyheder/politik/artikel/1/238348/pia_kjaersgaard_gaar_af_som_partiformand.html|publisher=Børsen|accessdate=22 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appointed [[Kristian Thulesen Dahl]] as her successor, and he took office on September 12th 2012, promising to maintain the course laid out by Kjærsgaard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= NIKLAS REHN|title=Pia K.: »Det er vemodigt.

==Early life==
Kjærsgaard was born in [[Copenhagen]], to Poul Kjærsgaard, a paint merchant, and Inge Munch Jensen, a housewife. After completing [[Danish Folkeskole Education]] in 1963, she attended the Commercial School in Copenhagen (1963–1965). From 1963 to 1967, she worked as a home care assistant for the elderly in [[Gentofte]]. From 1978 to 1984, she was employed as an office assistant in connection with insurance and advertising activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Folketinget&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Biography of Pia Kjærsgaard| publisher=Danish Parliament| url =http://www.ft.dk/Folketinget/findMedlem/DFPIKJ.aspx| accessdate=13 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Kjærsgaard married Henrik Thorup, an insurance underwriter. Thorup went on to become a chairperson and regional council member in the DPP, and currently works as a government accountant.

==Political career==
===Parliament===
Kjærsgaard began her political career as the [[Progress Party (Denmark)|Progress Party's]] candidate in the Ryvang nomination district (1979–1981), followed by the [[Ballerup]] and [[Gladsaxe]] nomination district (1981–1983), the [[Hvidovre]] nomination district (1983–1984), and finally, the [[Middelfart]] nomination district (1984–1995).&lt;ref name=&quot;Folketinget&quot;/&gt;

In 1984, while still with the Progress Party, she secured her first seat in the [[Folketing]] (Danish parliament), representing the [[Copenhagen County]] constituency (10 January 1984&amp;nbsp;– 8 September 1987). She next represented the [[Funen County]] constituency (8 September 1987&amp;nbsp;– 6 October 1995).&lt;ref name=&quot;Folketinget&quot;/&gt;

In 1995, as things were growing increasingly chaotic and anarchic in the Progress Party, Kjærsgaard broke away to co-found the [[Danish People's Party]] (DPP). She stood as the DPP candidate in the [[Glostrup]] nomination district in 1997, followed by the [[Hellerup]] and Gentofte nomination district (1997–2005). As a DPP candidate, she won a seat in the Folketing, representing the Funen County constituency (6 October 1995&amp;nbsp;– 11 March 1998).&lt;ref name=&quot;Folketinget&quot;/&gt;

As support for the Progress Party subsequently dwindled away, the DPP grew. By 2001, it had become the third largest party in the Folketing, securing 12% of the vote. In the [[Danish parliamentary election, 2005|2005 election]], the DPP's share grew to 13.2%, with Kjærsgaard receiving 38,347 &quot;personal votes&quot;, second to only the [[Prime Minister of Denmark|Prime Minister]], [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]].

===The Danish People's Party===
The Danish People's Party advocates a primarily [[nationalism|nationalist]] and [[nativism (politics)|nativist]] platform,&lt;ref name=&quot;dppwebsite&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Danish Peoples Party Program of Principles | work = | publisher = Dansk Folkparti | date = | url = http://www.danskfolkeparti.dk/Principprogram.asp | format = | doi = | accessdate = 13 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is, in that regard, aligned ideologically with other European [[far right]] parties.&lt;ref name=CNN-far-right&gt;{{cite web|last=Lister|first=Tim|title=Europe's resurgent far right focuses on immigration, multiculturalism|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-07-24/world/europe.far.right_1_political-parties-multiculturalism-danish-people-s-party/2?_s=PM:WORLD|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DPP's platform also includes toughening the criminal code and supporting social welfare policies&lt;ref name=&quot;dppwebsite&quot; /&gt; that have traditionally been championed by the center-left [[Social Democrats (Denmark)|Social Democrats]].

The DPP achieved considerable success in the [[Danish parliamentary election, 2001|2001 elections]], becoming the third largest party in the [[Folketing]]. As such, the DPP was able to provide key parliamentary support for the center-right, [[Venstre (Denmark)|Liberal]]-[[Conservative_People's_Party_(Denmark)|Conservative ]][[minority government]] led by [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]]. In this capacity the DPP was able to push through many of its platform's policies.

In both the [[Danish parliamentary election, 2005|2005]] and the [[Danish parliamentary election, 2007|2007 election]] the DPP kept its position as third largest in the [[Folketing]] and was thus able to maintain its substantial role in policy-setting through both the remainder of [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]]'s Liberal-Conservative government and through that of successor [[Lars Løkke Rasmussen]].

===Views, positions, and goals===
Kjærsgaard's most outspoken political goals are to limit immigration to [[Denmark]], that society should take better care of the elderly, and that Denmark should maintain its sovereignty, especially with regards to the [[European Union]]. In the [[Danish euro referendum, 2000|euro referendum]] she campaigned successfully against the adoption of the [[Euro]].

Her view on immigration has often led to her being compared to politicians such as [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]] in France and [[Pim Fortuyn]] in The Netherlands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Extremes&quot;&gt;{{cite web| date=May 6, 2002 | url= http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2050790,00.html | title= “They Sometimes Go To Extremes” | publisher= ''TIME europe''| accessdate=2006-09-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is also known to be an ardent supporter of [[Political status of Taiwan|Taiwan]]'s bid to gain admission to the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[United Nations]] [http://www.taiwanembassy.org/ct.asp?xItem=59383&amp;ctNode=1062&amp;mp=142]

==Controversies and incidents==
In 1998, Kjærsgaard was assaulted by members of an angry mob during a demonstration by the far left [[Autonomism|autonome]] movement in the [[Nørrebro]] district of Copenhagen.&lt;ref name=&quot;video&quot;&gt;{{cite web| date=May 21, 1998| url= http://www.cphpost.dk/news/1-latest-news/33484.html| title= “Video tape must be surrendered”| publisher= ''The Copenhagen Post''| accessdate=2006-12-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, accusations of nepotism were levied against the DPP after it was revealed that Kjærsgaard's husband, Henrik Thorup, had been paid by the party as an independent consultant for over two years. The accusations came from parties on both sides of the political spectrum. The DPP refused to reveal Thorup's salary and defended its actions, claiming that Pia Kjærsgaard's husband was the right man for the job and that his employment had nothing to do with his marriage to the party leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;nepotism&quot;&gt;{{cite web| date=Jan 19, 2001| url=http://www.cphpost.dk/news/1-latest-news/33484.html?tmpl=component&amp;print=1&amp;page=| title= “Nepotism charge against Danish People's Party”| publisher=''The Copenhagen Post''| accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Kjærsgaard, in the DPP's weekly newsletter, referred to Muslims as people who &quot;...lie, cheat and deceive.&quot; Kjærsgaard was subsequently reported to the police by Denmark's Center for Racial Discrimination, for making racist remarks. Police declined to prosecute Kjærsgaard, stating that there was no reason to believe that her statement violated any laws regarding racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Racist&quot;&gt;{{cite web| date=Jan 19, 2001| url= http://www.cphpost.dk/get/61284.html| title= “Racist remark ok”| publisher= ''The Copenhagen Post''| accessdate=2008-11-20 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Kjærsgaard was fined [[Danish krone|DKK]] 3,000 for threatening a woman with [[pepper spray]], the use of which is illegal in Denmark. Kjærsgaard said she pulled out the spray after feeling 'intimidated and threatened' by the woman's behaviour. Kjærsgaard subsequently proclaimed her intention to lobby for a change in weapon possession legislation.&lt;ref name=&quot;MP fined&quot;&gt;{{cite web| date=March 3, 2003| url= http://www.cphpost.dk/get/66040.html| title= “MP fined”| publisher= ''The Copenhagen Post''| accessdate=2006-09-26 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070614000025/http://www.cphpost.dk/get/66040.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Kjærsgaard lost a [[libel]] suit in the [[Danish Supreme Court]] against Karen Sunds, an anti-EU activist, who had characterized Kjærsgaard's viewpoints as [[racist]]. The Court ruled that Sunds' remarks had only implied that Kjærsgaard had a negative opinion of immigrants, and were not properly interpreted as an accusation of espousing biologically-grounded racism or Nazi racial theory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Racism ruling&quot;&gt;{{cite web| date=June 20, 2003 | url= http://www.cphpost.dk/news/politics/90-politics/28918.html| title= “Racism ruling”| publisher= ''The Copenhagen Post''| accessdate=2006-12-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070609105235/http://www.cphpost.dk/get/66828.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, at the opening of Folketinget, Kjærsgaard claimed to have been verbally assaulted and blamed [[Youth of the Socialist People's Party|Socialist People's Party's youth group (SFU)]] for the incident, and demanded an apology from [[Villy Søvndal]] (leader of the party). A video of the incident shows no sign of SFU, but a group from [[Socialist Youth Front|Socialistisk Ungdoms Front]] (Socialist Youth Front) singing songs and throwing confetti.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}
