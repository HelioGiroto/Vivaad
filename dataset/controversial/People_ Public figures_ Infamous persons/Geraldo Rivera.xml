'''Geraldo Rivera''' (born '''Gerald Michael Riviera''';&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/media/celebrity/geraldo.asp Urban Legends Reference Pages: Geraldo Rivera and Jerry Rivers]. Snopes.com. Retrieved on 2011-12-17.&lt;/ref&gt; July 4, 1943) is an American attorney, journalist, author, reporter, and [[talk show]] host. Rivera hosts the [[newsmagazine]] program ''[[Geraldo at Large]]'' and appears regularly on [[Fox News Channel]]. He is also well known from his history as a reporter and TV personality, and as the host of the controversial talk show ''[[Geraldo (talk show)|Geraldo]]'' from 1987 to 1998.

==Early life==
Rivera was born at [[Beth Israel Medical Center]] in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City|New York]], the son of Lillian ([[married and maiden names|née]] Friedman), a [[waitress]], and the late Cruz &quot;Allen&quot; Rivera (October 1, 1915 – November 1987), a restaurant worker and cab driver.&lt;ref name=&quot;abcexcerpt&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/WaterCooler/story?id=4339477&amp;page=1 |title=Excerpt: &quot;His Panic&quot; – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/59/Geraldo-Rivera.html Geraldo Rivera Biography (1943–)].

He was raised &quot;mostly Jewish&quot; and had a [[Bar Mitzvah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0729273/bio/ Biography for Geraldo Rivera]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfaithfamily.com/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=ekLSK5MLIrG&amp;b=297403&amp;ct=415783 Do the Jews Need Geraldo]. Interfaithfamily.com. Retrieved on 2011-12-17.&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Brooklyn]] and [[West Babylon, New York]]. He has four siblings: Wilfredo, Sharon, Irene, and Craig.

Rivera is an alumnus of the [[University of Arizona]], where he played varsity [[lacrosse]] as goalie. From September 1961 to May 1963, he attended the [[State University of New York Maritime College]], where he was a member of the rowing team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geraldo.com/v5/Biographical/Sailing-Book-continues.gr – Sailing Book (continues)].

(1998-09-24) Retrieved on 2011-12-17.&lt;/ref&gt; He received his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from [[Brooklyn Law School]] in 1969, and did postgraduate work at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] that same year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/R/htmlR/riverageral/riverageral.htm Rivera, Geraldo]. Museum.tv. Retrieved on 2011-12-17.&lt;/ref&gt; 

After a brief career in law enforcement where he served the [[New York City Police Department]] as an investigator, Rivera returned to law and became a [[Attorney at law (United States)|lawyer]] for a New York Puerto Rican activist group, the [[Young Lords]], and attracted the attention of [[WABC-TV]] news director [[Al Primo]] when he was interviewed about the group's occupation of an [[East Harlem]] church in 1969. Primo offered Rivera a job as a reporter but was unhappy with the first name &quot;Gerald&quot; (he wanted something more identifiably [[Latin]]) so they agreed to go with the pronunciation used by the Puerto Rican side of Rivera's family: Geraldo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/media/celebrity/geraldo.asp |title=Urban Legend about Geraldo Rivera's name being changed from Jerry Rivers |publisher=Snopes.com |accessdate=March 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of [[Tau Delta Phi]] fraternity.

==Career==

===Early stages===
[[File:Geraldo Rivera circa 1970s.JPG|thumb|180px|left|Rivera in the mid 1970s.]]
Geraldo Rivera was hired by WABC-TV in 1970 as a reporter for ''[[Eyewitness News]]''. In 1972, he garnered national attention and won a [[Peabody Award]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Powers185&quot;&gt;{{cite book
|last1= Powers
|first1= Ron
|authorlink1= Ron Powers
|title=The Newscasters: The News Business as Show Business
|isbn= 0-312-5707-7
|year=1977
|publisher=St. Martin's Press
|location= New York
|page=185}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[List of Peabody Award winners (1970–1979)#1972]]&lt;/ref&gt; for his report on the neglect and abuse of [[mental retardation|mentally retarded]] patients at [[Staten Island]]'s [[Willowbrook State School]] and began to appear on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] national programs such as ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'' and ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]''. After [[John Lennon]] watched Rivera's report on the patients at Willowbrook, he and Rivera formed a benefit concert called &quot;One to One&quot; (released in 1986 as ''[[Live in New York City]]''.)  Rivera reported [[Death of John Lennon|Lennon's murder]] on ''Nightline'' on December 8, 1980. Rivera also appeared in ''[[The U.S. vs. John Lennon]]'', a movie about Lennon and [[Yoko Ono]]'s lives in New York City. The movie was released in 2007.

Around this time, Rivera also began hosting ABC's ''Good Night America''.  The show featured the famous refrain from [[Arlo Guthrie]]'s hit &quot;City Of New Orleans&quot; (written by [[Steve Goodman]]) as the theme. A 1975 episode of the program featuring [[Dick Gregory]] and [[Robert J. Groden]] showed the first national telecast of the historic [[Zapruder Film]].

From 1975 to 1977, Rivera was a correspondent for ABC's ''[[Good Morning America]]''. He gave special reports for the show.

After [[Elvis Presley]] died in 1977, various media mistakenly reported that he had died from a [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. Rivera then investigated Presley's [[prescription drug]] records and concluded that he had died from multiple drug intake. His conclusion caused [[Tennessee]] medical authorities to later revoke the medical license of Dr. [[George C. Nichopoulos]] for overprescribing.

In October 1985, ABC's [[Roone Arledge]] refused to air a report done by Sylvia Chase, for ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]'' on the relationship between [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[John F. Kennedy|John]] and [[Robert Kennedy]]. Rivera publicly criticized Arledge's journalistic integrity, claiming that Arledge's friendship with the [[Kennedy family]] (for example, [[Pierre Salinger]], a former Kennedy aide, worked for [[ABC News]] at the time) had caused him to spike the story; as a result, Rivera was fired. Sylvia Chase quit ''20/20'', although she returned to ABC News many years later. The report has never aired.

In April 1986, Rivera hosted the syndicated special ''[[The Mystery of Al Capone's Vault]]'', an ill-fated adventure where Rivera excavated what he had been told was the site of [[Al Capone]]'s buried treasure trove. Rivera broadcast live as the site was excavated, fully expecting to find a store of the former gangster's wealth. The show was heavily advertised, particularly on [[Chicago]]'s [[WGN-TV|WGN]] television station. A medical examiner was brought along for the excavation in case any dead bodies were excavated. The show was on air for several hours, displacing regularly scheduled programming, as Rivera's team penetrated the vault he was sure would yield the famed loot.  Ultimately, the vault was found to contain a few broken bottles. Rivera held one of these bottles aloft for the camera and excitedly stated that it had once contained &quot;bootleg [[moonshine]] [[gin]]&quot;.

===Talk shows and specials===
In 1987, Rivera began producing and hosting the daytime talk show ''[[Geraldo (talk show)|Geraldo]]'', which ran for 11 years. The show featured controversial guests and theatricality, which led to the characterization of his show as &quot;[[Trash TV]]&quot; by ''[[Newsweek]]'' and two [[United States Senate|United States senators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | agency = Associated Press | title = TWO DEMOCRATIC SENATORS JOIN BENNETT'S CRUSADE AGAINST `TRASH TV' | url = http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/20671503.html?dids=20671503:20671503&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT | format = newspaper | publisher = Chicago Tribune | page = 26 | date = December 8, 1995 | accessdate = March 2, 2009 | quote = Two Democratic senators are joining Friday with William Bennett... to criticize advertisers who support what critics call 'trash TV' talk shows.... In television and radio ads to begin airing Friday, Bennett and Sens. Joseph Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) urge companies to withdraw advertising dollars from... [shows including] 'Geraldo,'}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the early shows was titled &quot;Men in Lace Panties and the Women Who Love Them&quot;. His nose was broken in a [[Geraldo brawl|well-publicized brawl]] during a 1988 show, involving [[white supremacy|white supremacists]], [[Skinheads Against Racial Prejudice|anti-racist skinheads]], [[Black people|black]] activists, and [[Jew]]ish activists.

In 1987, he hosted the first of a series of [[prime time]] special reports dealing with an alleged epidemic of [[Satanic ritual abuse]]. He stated: 
:&quot;Estimates are that there are over 1 million [[Satanism|Satanists]] in this country ... The majority of them are linked in a highly organized, very secretive network. From small towns to large cities, they have attracted police and [[FBI]] attention to their Satanic [[child sexual abuse|sexual child abuse]], [[child pornography]] and grisly Satanic murders. The odds are that this is happening in your town.&quot;

More credible estimates are about 10,000 adult members of religious Satanic churches, temples and grottos as well as 10,000 solitary practitioners of Satanism; Rivera's claims of ritualistic abuse, conspiracy and criminal activity remain unsubstantiated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/geraldo.htm Geraldo Rivera'S Influence On The Satanic Ritual Abuse And Recovered Memory Hoaxes]. Religioustolerance.org. Retrieved on 2011-12-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, he began hosting nightly discussion of the news on [[CNBC]] called ''[[Rivera Live]]'' while continuing to host ''[[Geraldo]]''. The show was portrayed in the [[The Finale (Seinfeld)|final episode]] of ''[[Seinfeld]]'', with Rivera as himself reporting on the lengthy [[trial]] of the show's four main characters. In May 1994, he appeared on ''[[The Price Is Right]]''.

Later, he would take his talk show in a different direction, moving it from &quot;Trash TV&quot; to a more subdued, serious show, and changed its name from ''Geraldo'' to ''[[The Geraldo Rivera Show]]''. By this time, however, the show had run its course, and was cancelled in 1998.

In 1997, Rivera contracted with [[NBC]] to work as a reporter for six years for $30 million, including hosting ''Rivera Live'' on [[CNBC]]. During 1998 and 1999, he extensively covered the [[Clinton impeachment|impeachment]] of President [[Bill Clinton]].

===Fox News to present===
Following the [[September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attacks|terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001]], he accepted a pay cut and went to work for the [[Fox News|Fox News Channel]] as a war correspondent in November 2001. Rivera's brother Craig accompanied him as a cameraman on assignments in [[Afghanistan]].

In 2001, during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]], Rivera was derided for a report in which he claimed to be at the scene of a [[friendly fire]] incident; it was later revealed he was actually 300 miles away. Rivera blamed a minor misunderstanding for the discrepancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/afghanistan/1365910/Gun-toting-Geraldo-under-fire-for-the-story-that-never-was.html &quot;Gun-toting Geraldo under fire for the story that never was&quot;], [[telegraph.co.uk]], December 20, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Controversy arose in early 2003, while Rivera was traveling with the 101st Airborne Division in [[Iraq]]. During a Fox News broadcast, Rivera began to disclose an upcoming operation, even going so far as to draw a map in the sand for his audience. The military immediately issued a firm denunciation of his actions, saying it put the operation at risk, and nearly expelled Rivera from Iraq. Two days later, he announced that he would be reporting on the Iraq conflict from [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name=cnn-irq&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/03/31/sprj.irq.rivera/ &quot;Confusion surrounds Rivera's expulsion from Iraq&quot;], [[CNN]], April 1, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A0DE5DD1039F932A35757C0A9659C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=A NATION AT WAR: COVERAGE; Pentagon Says Geraldo Rivera Will Be Removed From Iraq | first=David | last=Carr | date=April 1, 2003 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Rivera engaged in a feud with ''[[The New York Times]]'' over their allegations that he pushed aside a member of a rescue team in order to be filmed &quot;assisting&quot; a woman in a wheelchair down some steps in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. The ensuing controversy caused Rivera to appear on television and demand a retraction from the ''Times''. He further threatened to sue the paper if one was not provided.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvsquad.com/2005/09/07/geraldo-rivera-might-sue-the-new-york-times/ Geraldo Rivera might sue The New York Times – TV Squad]. Tvsquad.com. Retrieved on 2011-12-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Rivera came out with a book called ''HisPanic: Why Americans fear Hispanics in the U.S.''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rivera |first=Geraldo |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87866811 |title=Rivera Takes on Anti-Immigrant Fervor in 'His Panic' |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivera himself is part Hispanic, his father coming from [[Puerto Rico]].

In 2007, Geraldo was involved in a dispute with fellow Fox colleague [[Michelle Malkin]], Malkin announced that she would not return to The ''O'Reilly Factor'', claiming that Fox News had mishandled a dispute over derogatory statements made about her by Geraldo in a ''[[Boston Globe]]'' interview. Rivera, while objecting to her views on [[immigration]], says, &quot;Michelle Malkin is the most vile, hateful commentator I've ever met in my life. She actually believes that neighbors should start snitching out neighbors, and we should be deporting people.&quot; He added, &quot;It's good she's in D.C., and I'm in New York. I'd spit on her if I saw her&quot;, Rivera later apologized for his comments.&lt;ref&gt;Shanahan, Mark.

On September 12, 2008, during the Fox News coverage of [[Hurricane Ike]], Rivera was knocked over by the storm surge debris while reporting live in [[Galveston]] near the 17 foot high sea wall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo; |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WLZ7lK7-G_A |title=Geraldo Rivera Takes a Spill! |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-09-12 |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 10, 2010, [[Oprah Winfrey]] invited Rivera, along with former talk show hosts [[Phil Donahue]], [[Sally Jessy Raphael]], [[Ricki Lake]] and [[Montel Williams]] as guests on her show. This was the first time that she had fellow talkers appear together since their programs left the air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oprah.com/showinfo/Talk-Show-Hosts-Together-for-the-First-Time_1 from Oprah.com (November 8, 2010)]. Oprah.com (2010-11-10). Retrieved on 2011-12-17.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Colbert]] has frequently lampooned Rivera on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', especially calling attention to his mustache. He has explained in interviews that Rivera was one of the inspirations for the &quot;man with a mission&quot; facet of Colbert's right-wing pundit [[Stephen Colbert (character)|character]]. &quot;That's the heart of [Rivera's] persona: that he ''really is'' changing the world with every interview he does — just slowly, syllable by syllable, he is changing the great ship of human destiny with his will toward justice.&quot; Colbert's character, in turn, &quot;thinks, 'We're gonna bust things wide open with this report,' when in fact he never has an idea of what he's talking about.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4583007 |title=Fake Newsman Stephen Colbert |publisher=NPR |date=2005-04-08 |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivera has since appeared on the show.

While hosting his show on Fox News on the night of May 1, 2011, Rivera broke the news that [[Death of Osama bin Laden|Osama bin Laden was killed by American special forces]] at 10:40 p.m. [[EST5EDT|EDT]].  When the news broke, Rivera proudly proclaimed &quot;this is the greatest night of my career&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/geraldo-riveras-finest-moment-how-the-much-maligned-anchor-broke-the-bin-laden-news-best/|title=Geraldo Rivera’s Finest Moment: How The Much Maligned Anchor Broke The Bin Laden News Best |publisher=FOX News |date=2011-05-02 |accessdate=2011-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 10, 2011, Rivera was filmed by [[Russia Today]] being jeered by the [[Occupy Wall Street]] protesters at Liberty Square. The crowd chanted, &quot;FOX News lies!&quot; until Rivera and his camera crew left the protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/10/geraldo-rivera-fox-news-lies-occupy-wall-street_n_1003523.html?ref=occupy-wall-street |title=Geraldo Rivera Met With Chants Of 'Fox News Lies' At Occupy Wall Street|publisher=Huffington Post |date=2011-10-10 |accessdate=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 3, 2012 Rivera began hosting a weekday radio talk show on [[WABC (AM)]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/12/11/geraldo-rivera-gets-talk-deal-on-wabc-radio/ Geraldo Rivera Gets Talk Deal on WABC Radio] Brian Stelter, New York Times, December 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On January 30, 2012 Rivera also began hosting a weekday radio talk show on [[KABC (AM)]] in Los Angeles from 10AM to 12PM PST.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jan/20/entertainment/la-et-geraldo-kabc-20120120/ Geraldo Rivera to debut radio talk show on KABC-AM] Steve Carney, Los Angeles Times, January 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He fills the 10 a.m. to noon slot between the syndicated [[Imus in the Morning]] and [[Rush Limbaugh]] programs.
