'''Adam John Walsh''' (November 14, 1974 – July 27, 1981) was an American boy who was [[kidnapping|abducted]] from a [[Sears, Roebuck and Company|Sears]] department store at the Hollywood Mall in [[Hollywood, Florida]], on July 27, 1981, and later found murdered and decapitated. Walsh's death earned national publicity. His story was made into the 1983 television film ''[[Adam (TV film)|Adam]]'', seen by 38 million people in its original airing.&lt;ref name=missingtotestimates&gt;{{Citation  | last = Divoky  | first = Diane  | title = Missing Tot Estimates Exaggerated  | newspaper = [[Lodi News-Sentinel]]  | pages = 2  | date = 18 February 1986  | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=dXBh7-90p_YC&amp;dat=19860218&amp;b_mode=2  | accessdate = &lt;!-----5 June 2010-----&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walsh's father, [[John Walsh]], became an [[advocate]] for victims of violent crimes and the host of the television program ''[[America's Most Wanted]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutWalsh&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Convicted [[serial killer]] [[Ottis Toole]] confessed to the boy's murder but was never tried for the crime due to loss of evidence and a recanted confession. Although no new evidence has come forth, on December 16, 2008, police announced that the Walsh case was now closed as they were satisfied that Toole was the murderer. Toole died of liver failure on September 15, 1996.&lt;ref name=solved/&gt;

==Kidnapping==
On July 27, 1981, Walsh's mother, Revé, let Adam watch several older boys play [[video game]]s at a Sears store in Hollywood, Florida, while she walked a few aisles away to shop for a lamp. When Revé returned to the video game section about seven minutes later, Adam and the other boys were gone.  As the result of a squabble between the older boys, a security guard had been called and had told them to leave the store.&lt;ref name=amw/&gt;  The security guard asked the older boys if their parents were in the store, and the boys said that they were not.&lt;ref name=amw/&gt;  It was later conjectured by Adam's parents that he was too shy to speak to the security officer, who presumed that he was in the company of the other boys, and put him out the same door.  Adam was then left alone near an exit of Sears that was unfamiliar to him.&lt;ref name=amw&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.amw.com/fugitives/brief.cfm?id=39789 |title=Ottis Toole on America's Most Wanted |accessdate=2008-12-16|work=[[America's Most Wanted]] |quote=Adam didn't tell the security guard his mother was in the lamp department; he followed the older boy out the west exit of Sears into the parking lot. John and Revé believe Adam didn't tell the security guard about his mother, because he was a timid child and mindful of authority. Knowing their son, they believe he may have been too scared to say anything.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/CRIME/12/16/walsh.case.closed/index.html |title=Police: Drifter killed Adam Walsh in 1981|quote=Police believe a 17-year-old security guard asked a handful of rowdy kids who were playing video games in the toy department to leave the store.

That was the last time he was seen. |accessdate=2008-12-16|work=[[CNN]] | date=December 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adam's severed head was found by two fishermen in a [[Vero Beach, Florida]], [[canal]] on August 10, 1981. The rest of his body was not recovered.&lt;ref name=solved/&gt; The coroner ruled that the cause of Adam's death was [[asphyxiation]] and that the decapitation had occurred later, perhaps to render his remains unidentifiable or the cause of his death indeterminable.{{citation needed|date = August 2012}}

Police eventually concluded that Adam was abducted by a drifter named Ottis Toole near the front exterior of the Sears store that afternoon, after being asked to leave by a store clerk. Toole lured Adam into his Cadillac with promises of toys and candy, then proceeded to drive north on Interstate 95 toward his home in Jacksonville. Adam, at first docile and compliant, began to cry and scream as the drive wore on. Toole responded by knocking Adam out with blows to the head and chest (and likely strangled him), then pulled off onto a deserted service road in Indian River County to decapitate the boy. Toole later claimed to have disposed of Adam's body by incinerating it in an old refrigerator when he returned to Jacksonville. Since Toole was a cannibal, there were reports that he dismembered the young boy's body and consumed it, but those reports were later ruled out.{{Citation needed|date = August 2012}}

==Aftermath==
Adam's kidnapping and murder prompted John Walsh to become an advocate  for victims rights and helped to spur the formation of the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]] (NCMEC). As a result of his advocacy, he was approached to host the [[television]] program ''[[America's Most Wanted]]''.{{citation needed|date = August 2012}}

The [[Code Adam]] program for helping lost children in department stores is named in Walsh's memory.{{Citation needed|date = August 2012}} 
The U.S. Congress passed the [[Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act]] on July 25, 2006, and [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] signed it into law on July 27, 2006. The signing ceremony took place on the South Lawn of the [[White House]], attended by John and Revé Walsh. The bill institutes a national database of convicted child molesters, and increases penalties for sexual and violent offenses against children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bush&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | quote=Fourth, the bill I sign today will help prevent child abuse by creating a National Child Abuse Registry, and requiring investigators to do background checks on adoptive and foster parents before they approve to take custody of a child. By giving child protective service professionals in all 50 states access to this critical information, we will improve their ability to investigate child abuse cases and help ensure that the vulnerable children are not put into situations of abuse or neglect.  | year = 2006 | url = http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/07/20060727-6.html | title = President Signs H.R. 4472, the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act of 2006 | publisher =[[White House]]| accessdate = 2007-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also creates a [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act|RICO]] cause of action for child predators and those who conspire with them.&lt;ref name=&quot;RICO&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act  | url=http://pasentencing.org/nasc/AdamWalshAct2006analysis.rtf|format=Rich Text Format| accessdate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suspects==
*John Walsh himself was considered by authorities as a prime suspect as the police investigation started to become exhausted. After about a week, he was later absolved of any foul play following a highly emotional press statement that was televised nationally.{{citation needed|date = August 2012}}
*[[Jeffrey Dahmer]], arrested in [[Wisconsin]] in 1991 after killing more than a dozen men and boys, was also named as a suspect in the Walsh murder. Some have suggested a Dahmer link to the case for many years, but the allegations earned widespread publicity only in early 2007. Dahmer was living in [[Miami Beach]] at the time Adam was murdered, and two [[Witness|eyewitnesses]] placed Dahmer at the shopping mall on the day Adam was abducted. One of the witnesses claimed to have seen a strange man walking into the Sears toy department where Adam was abducted. The other said that he saw a young, blond man with a protruding chin throw a struggling child into a blue van and speed off. Both witnesses recognized the man they had seen as Dahmer when pictures of him were released in the newspapers after his arrest. Recent reports have also shown that the delivery shop where Dahmer worked had a blue van at the time. Dahmer [[preyed]] on young men and boys (the youngest being eight years older than Adam), and his ''[[modus operandi]]'' included severing his victims' heads. Since this rumor surfaced, John Walsh has said that he has &quot;seen no evidence linking his son's unsolved kidnapping and slaying to serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=February 1, 2007| title=Did Dahmer Have One More Victim? Witnesses Say They Saw Dahmer In Mall Where Adam Walsh Disappeared| publisher=ABC News The Milwaukee Channel.com| url=http://www.wisn.com/news/10903529/detail.html| accessdate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ottis Toole repeatedly confessed and then retracted accounts of his involvement. Toole, allegedly a confidante of convicted serial killer [[Henry Lee Lucas]], was never charged in the Walsh case, even though he provided seemingly accurate descriptions as to how he committed the crime. Several witnesses also place Toole in the Hollywood area in the days leading up to Walsh's disappearance. Police investigated Toole for the Walsh murder but lost important evidence in the case, including the bloodstained carpet from Toole's Cadillac.&lt;ref name=solved/&gt; In September 1996, Toole died in prison, aged 49, of cirrhosis of the liver while serving a life sentence for other crimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;amw&quot; /&gt; Afterwards, Toole's niece told John Walsh that her uncle made a deathbed confession to the murder of Adam.&lt;ref name=amw&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.amw.com/fugitives/brief.cfm?id=39789 |title=Ottis Toole on America's Most Wanted |accessdate=2008-12-16|work=[[America's Most Wanted]] |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= |title=John Walsh's Tears of Rage tells the story of the Adam Walsh case |accessdate=2008-12-16|publisher=[[Washington Examiner]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toole's confession, however, had been viewed as reliable, since he and Henry Lucas confessed to or implicated themselves in more than 200 different homicides, most of which they accurately described details only the culprit would know.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYPost&quot;&gt;{{cite news|quote=But Toole also claimed he committed hundreds of murders, and cops determined he was telling the truth about them.|date=December 17, 2008| title=1981 Adam Slay Solved|work=[[New York Post]]|url=http://www.nypost.com/seven/12172008/news/nationalnews/1981_adam_slay_solved_144557.htm|accessdate=2008-12-17 | first1=Andy | last1=Soltis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Hollywood Police Chief Rick Stone conducted an exhaustive review of the Adam Walsh case after the release of John Walsh's book. At the time, Stone was a 22-year veteran of the Dallas, Texas, and Wichita, Kansas, police departments and had been appointed Hollywood's chief of police in the previous year.  Although the crime was decades old at the time of Chief Stone's review, he provided an analysis of the evidence, including reviewing taped interrogations of Ottis Toole by Hollywood Police Detective Mark Smith.  Stone says his review found evidence to prove &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; that Toole murdered Adam Walsh. Both Toole and his close friend, convicted serial killer Henry Lee Lucas, were notorious, Stone noted, for confessing to crimes they committed and recanting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,987265,00.html | work=Time | first=Tammerlin | last=Drummond | title=Books: An American Tragedy | date=October 27, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Case closed in 2008==
Although no new evidence was presented, on December 16, 2008, the Hollywood, Florida, Police Chief Chad Wagner announced, with John Walsh present, that the case was now closed. An external review of the case had been conducted and police announced that they were satisfied that Ottis Toole was the murderer.&lt;ref name=solved&gt;{{cite news |first= Yolanne|last= Almanzar|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Police Expected to Close Adam Walsh Case  |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/17/us/17adam.html?hp |quote=In October 1983, Mr. Toole told the police that he had abducted Adam from the mall and drove for about an hour to an isolated dirt road where he decapitated him (his body was never found). Investigators lifted bloodstained carpet from Mr. Toole’s white Cadillac. But DNA testing then was not as advanced as it now, and investigators could not tell if the blood was Adam’s. When a detective assigned to the case in 1994 went to order DNA testing on the bloodstained carpeting from Mr. Toole’s car, the carpeting and the car were found to be missing.|work=[[New York Times]] |date=December 16, 2008  |accessdate=2008-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYPost&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite news |author=John Holland | title=Adam Walsh case is closed after 27 years | url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-adam17-2008dec17,0,4962413.story | work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=December 17, 2008 | quote=Police simply took another look at 27 years of tips, psychic revelations, often-botched police work and a serial killer's chilling admissions and decided it was time.
