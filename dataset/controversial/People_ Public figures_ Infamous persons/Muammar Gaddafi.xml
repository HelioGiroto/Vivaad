&lt;!--Downfall/demise:--&gt;
In February 2011, following [[Arab Spring|revolutions in neighbouring Egypt and Tunisia]], protests against Gaddafi's rule began. These escalated into an uprising that spread across the country, with the forces opposing Gaddafi establishing a government, based in [[Benghazi]], named the [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC). This act led to [[Libyan civil war|a civil war]], which precipitated [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military intervention]] by a NATO-led coalition to enforce a [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973|UN Security Council Resolution 1973]] calling for a [[no-fly zone]] and protection of civilians in Libya. The assets of Gaddafi and his family were frozen, and both [[Interpol]] and the [[International Criminal Court]] issued arrest warrants on 27 June for Gaddafi, his son [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi|Saif al-Islam]], and his brother-in-law [[Abdullah Senussi]], concerning [[crimes against humanity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iccwarrant&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/video/2011-05/17/c_13878741.htm |title=ICC requests Gaddafi arrest warrant |work=Xinhua |date=17 May 2011 |accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Libya: ICC issues arrest warrant for Muammar Gaddafi | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13927208 |work=BBC News| date=27 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi and his forces lost the [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|Battle of Tripoli]] in August and on 16 September 2011 the NTC took Libya's seat at the UN, replacing Gaddafi.&lt;ref name=&quot;unga_144&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/news/ci_18910663|work=San Jose Mercury News|first=Edith|last=Lederer|title=UN approves Libya seat for former rebels|date=16 September 2011|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retained control over parts of Libya, most notably the city of [[Sirte]], to which it was presumed that he had fled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/01/world/africa/libya-war/ | work=CNN | title=Anti-Gadhafi tribes clash in two Libyan locales | date=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Gaddafi's forces initially held out in the [[Battle of Sirte (2011)|battle for Sirte]] against NATO's bombing attacks and the [[National Transitional Council|NTC]]'s advances, Gaddafi was captured alive in Sirte by members of the [[National Liberation Army (Libya)|Libyan National Liberation Army]] (NLA) after his convoy was attacked by [[NATO]] warplanes as Sirte fell on 20 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/confirmed-gaddafi-dead-colonel-gaddafi-275389 Confirmed Gaddafi dead: Colonel Gaddafi killed in cold blood begging for his life] (20 October 2011), Mirrir News.&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi was then killed by [[National Liberation Army (Libya)|NLA]] fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/VideoArticles/Video/Article.aspx?id=242548|title='Gaddafi was caught alive, later beaten, killed by rebels' |date=20 October 2011|work=The Jerusalem Post |agency=Reuters |accessdate=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 41-year leadership prior to the civil war made him the [[List of longest ruling non-royal national leaders|fourth-longest-serving non-royal leader]] since 1900, as well as the longest-serving Arab leader.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Féraud, &quot;Annales Tripolitaines&quot;, the Arabic version named &quot;Al Hawliyat Al Libiya&quot;, translated to Arabic by Mohammed Abdel Karim El Wafi, Dar el Ferjani, Tripoli, Libya, vol. 3, p.797.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to many biographies, he came from an [[Arab]] tribal family called the [[Qadhadhfa]]. At the time of his birth, Libya was an Italian colony.

In 1948, when he was six years old he was wounded and witnessed the death of two cousins when an old mine left by soldiers of the colonial Italian Royal Army exploded near Sirte.

Gaddafi attended a Muslim elementary school far from home in [[Sabha, Libya|Sabha]], during which time he was profoundly influenced by major events in the [[Arab world]] and the [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist movement]]. He admired Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] and looked to him as a hero during his rise to power in 1952. In 1956 Gaddafi took part in [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Israeli]] protests during the [[Suez Crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/434599.stm |title=Colonel Gaddafi: A maverick veteran |publisher=BBC News|date= 31 August 1999|accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Sabha he was briefly a member of [[Scouting]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Libya: Boy Scouts on the front line&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title =Libya: Boy Scouts on the front line|publisher=The Telegraph| date = 25 August 2011| url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/libya/8723352/Libya-Boy-Scouts-on-the-front-line.html| accessdate =27 September 2011| location=London| first=Andrew| last=Gilligan}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished his secondary school studies under a private tutor in [[Misrata]], concentrating on the study of history. In 1951, Libya gained independence under the Western-allied [[Idris of Libya|King Idris]].

Gaddafi entered the [[Royal Libyan Military Academy]] at [[Benghazi]] in 1961, and graduated in 1966. After graduating, Qaddafi steadily rose through the ranks of the military, and joined a group in hopes of deposing King Idris due to increasing dissatisfaction with his rule. Both towards the end of his course and after graduation, Gaddafi pursued further studies in Europe. False rumours have been propagated with regards to this part of his life, for example, that he attended the United Kingdom's [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.army.mod.uk/documents/general/rmasarchives.pdf| title= The Royal Military Academy Sandhurst's Archives| author=Ministry of Defence, United Kingdom| year= 2009| publisher=Ministry of Defence| page= 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He did in fact receive four months' further military training in the United Kingdom in advanced communications as a Signals officer, and spent four months in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1375227/Libya-Portrait-young-Gaddafi-shows-nutcase-loathed-ugly-British.html|title=Portrait of the young Gaddafi: A nutcase who loathed the 'ugly British' and was so unworldly he drank water from a finger bowl|work=Daily Mail|location=London |date=13 April 2011|accessdate=6 September 2011|first1=Sharon|last1=Churcher|first2=Robert|last2=Verkaik}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7594790.stm |publisher=BBC News| title=Profile: Muammar Gaddafi | date=28 August 2009 | accessdate=13 May 2010 | first=Aidan | last=Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, as a commissioned officer he joined the Engineers Corps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/biography/Qaddafi.html|title=Muammar Gaddafi|publisher=jewishvirtuallibrary.org|accessdate=6 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although often referred to as &quot;Colonel Gaddafi&quot;, he was in fact only a Lieutenant when he seized power in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anhri.net/en/reports/libya/ |title=The Long-Aged Dictatorship 40 Years of Qaddafi Rule in Libya |publisher=Anhri.net |accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He promoted himself to Colonel after his coup.

==Libyan revolution of 1969==
{{main|Libyan coup d'etat (1969)}}
[[File:Flag of Libyan Arab Republic 1969.svg|thumb|right|300px|[[Flag of Libya|Flag]] of the [[Libyan Arab Republic]] (1969-1977), the government established directly after the overthrow of the monarchy and lasting until the establishment of the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] in 1977]]

In Libya, as in a number of other Arab countries, admission to a military academy and a career as an army officer only became available to members of the lower economic strata after independence. A military career offered an opportunity for higher education, for upward economic and social mobility, and was for many the only available means of political action. For Gaddafi and many of his fellow officers, who were inspired by Nasser's brand of [[Arab nationalism]], a military career was a revolutionary vocation.

As a cadet, Gaddafi associated with the Free Officers Movement. Most of his future colleagues on the [[Libyan Revolutionary Command Council|Revolutionary Command Council]] (RCC) were fellow members of his graduating class at the military academy. The frustration and shame felt by Libyan officers by Israel's massive defeat of the Arab armies on three fronts in 1967 fuelled their determination to contribute to Arab unity by overthrowing the Libyan monarchy. As disaffection with King Idris grew, Gaddafi became involved with a movement of young officers to overthrow the king while a cadet.

On 1 September 1969, a small group of junior military officers led by Gaddafi successfully staged a bloodless coup d'état against [[Idris of Libya|King Idris]] while the king was in [[Turkey]] for medical treatment. Idris's nephew, Crown Prince [[Hasan as-Senussi|Sayyid Hasan ar-Rida al-Mahdi as-Sanussi]], was formally deposed by the revolutionary Gaddafi officers and put under [[house arrest]]; having overthrown and abolished the monarchy, they proclaimed the [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi#Libyan Arab Republic|Libyan Arab Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/september/1/newsid_3911000/3911587.stm|title=Bloodless coup in Libya|publisher=BBC News |date=20 December 2003|accessdate=14 February 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaddafi was named commander-in-chief of the armed forces and chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, Libya's new ruling body. At age 27, Gaddafi had become the ruler of Libya.

On gaining power he immediately ordered the shutdown of American and British military bases, including [[Wheelus Air Base]]. He told Western officials that he would expel their companies from Libya's oil fields unless they shared more revenue. In his warning, he alluded to consultation with Nasser. The oil companies complied with the demand, increasing Libya's share from 50 to 79 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yXBRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Aw8EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7216,2358896 |title='Shotgun Wedding' For the Companies |work=Lakeland Ledger|date=8 October 1972 |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1969, Egyptian intelligence thwarted a planned coup against Gaddafi from high-ranking members of his leadership. Many of the dissenters had grown uneasy with his growing relationship to Egypt.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathaba.net/gci/theory/gb3.htm#SOCIAL |title=The Green Book, Third Volume &quot;The Social Basis of the Third World Theory&quot;, The Social Basis of the Third World Theory |publisher=Mathabba.net |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gaddafi soon replaced country's official [[Gregorian calendar]] with an [[Islamic calendar]] and forbade the sale of [[alcohol]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newvision.co.ug/D/299/308/728826 |title=New Vision Online: A date with Gaddafi |publisher=Newvision.co.ug |date=14 August 2010 |accessdate=1 September 2011}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He renamed the months of the calendar. August, named for [[Augustus Caesar]], was renamed [[Hannibal]], and July, after [[Julius Caesar]], was renamed Nasser, for [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. Gaddafi increasingly devoted himself to &quot;contemplative exile&quot; over the months following an attempted assassination attempt,&lt;ref name=&quot;SalakLibya&quot;/&gt; writing a manifesto, [[The Green Book (Libya)|The Green Book]] (an allusion to [[Mao Zedong]]’s [[Quotations from Chairman Mao|Little Red Book]]), in which he denounced [[capitalism]] and [[communism]] as variations on &quot;slavery&quot; and spurned all political parties as forms of &quot;dictatorship&quot;. In the manifesto, he advocated direct rule by People’s Committees according to Islamic law. At this time, routine administrative tasks fell to Major [[Abdessalam Jalloud]], who became prime minister in place of Gaddafi in 1972. Two years later, Jallud assumed Gaddafi's remaining administrative and protocol duties, to allow Gaddafi to devote his time to revolutionary theorizing. Gaddafi remained the commander-in-chief of the armed forces and the effective head of state. The foreign press speculated about an eclipse of his authority within the RCC, but Gaddafi soon dispelled such theories by imposing measures to restructure Libyan society.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

In 1970, Gaddafi expelled the remaining [[Italian settlers in Libya|Italian settlers]] from Libya, and emphasized what he saw as the battle between Arab nationalism and western imperialism.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC NEWS 271005&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/4380360.stm Libya cuts ties to mark Italy era.].

The Revolutionary Committees occasionally kept tight control over internal dissent; reportedly, ten to twenty percent of Libyans worked as informants for these committees, with surveillance taking place in the government, in factories, and in the education sector.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mohamed Eljhami&quot;/&gt; During the 1970s, Libya executed members of the Islamist fundamentalist [[Hizb-ut Tahrir]] faction, and Gaddafi often personally presided over the executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sijill.tripod.com/victims/ |title=Libya: April Victims of Gaddafi Madness |publisher=Sijill.tripod.com |accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mark Almond |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1192494/More-make-hair-dye-40-virgin-bodyguards-Gaddafi-murderous-menace.html |title=More make-up (and hair dye) than his 40 virgin bodyguards, but Gaddafi is still a murderous menace|work=Daily Mail|location=London |date=12 June 2009 |accessdate=1 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early reforms and actions===

Gaddafi signed an agreement with Tunisian president [[Habib Bourguiba]] to [[Arab Islamic Republic|merge nations]] in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jXkyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=fbcFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5560,1523958 |title=Tunisia And Libya To Unite |work=The Palm Beach Post|date=13 January 1974 |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pact came as a surprise because Bouguiba had rebuked similar offers for over two years previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jacpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ouUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5871,9063966 |title=Tunisia will not be rushed |work=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=23 January 1974 |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weeks after the agreement, he postponed a referendum on the issue, effectively ending it weeks later. The idea of merging states was highly unpopular in Tunisia, and cost Bourguiba much of his people's respect. The agreement was said to allow Bourguiba the presidency while Gaddafi would be defence minister. A later [[Oujda|treaty]] with [[Morocco]]'s [[Hassan II]] in 1984 broke down in two years when Hassan II met with Israeli Prime Minister [[Shimon Peres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Washington's Closest Arab Ally Neutralizes Foes: Moroccan King a Success on Tightrope: U.S. Ties Warm Despite His Libya Pact | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1985-05-28/news/mn-16288_1_closest-arab-ally |work=LA Times | date=28 May 1985 | accessdate=27 March 2011 | first=David | last=Lamb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi said recognition of Israel was &quot;an act of treason&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Morocco cancelling treaty aimed at union with Libya | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/30/world/morocco-canceling-treaty-aimed-at-union-with-libya.html |work=The New York Times | date=30 September 1986 | accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Increase of revenue from oil====
From the beginning of his leadership, Gaddafi confronted foreign oil companies for increases in revenues. Immediately after assuming office, he demanded that oil companies pay 10 percent more taxes and an increased royalty of 44 cents per barrel. Gaddafi argued that Libyan oil was closer to Europe, and was cheaper to ship than oil from the Persian Gulf. Western companies refused his demands, and Gaddafi asserted himself by cutting the production of [[Occidental Petroleum]], an American company in Libya, from 800,000 to 500,000 that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;bare_url&quot;/&gt; Occidental Petroleum's President, [[Armand Hammer]], met with Gaddafi in Tripoli and had difficulty understanding exactly what he wanted at first. He said at one meeting, Prime Minister Abdessalam Jalloud finally took out his gun belt and left the loaded revolver in full view. Later, Hammer recalled that moment and said he felt then &quot;that Gaddafi was ready to negotiate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2oPi-iJIaJEC|title=The Power of a Good Fight|publisher=Literary Architects, LLC|date= 1 November 2006|accessdate=1 September 2011|isbn=978-1-933669-05-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/conflict-in-libya-us-oil-companies-sit-on-sidelines-as-gaddafi-maintains-hold/2011/06/03/AGJq2QPH_story.html |title=Conflict in Libya: U.S. oil companies sit on sidelines as Gaddafi maintains hold |work=The Washington Post |date=16 August 2011 |accessdate=1 September 2011 |first=Marjorie |last=Censer}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Age of Oil'', historians considered Gaddafi's success in 1970 to be the &quot;decisive spark that set off an unprecedented chain reaction&quot; in oil-producing nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=JWmx5uKA6gIC|title=The Age of Oil|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year= 2006|accessdate=1 September 2011|isbn=978-0-275-99008-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libya continued a winning streak against the oil companies throughout the [[1970s energy crisis]]; Later that year, the [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi|Shah of Iran]] raised his demands to match those of Gaddafi. [[OPEC]] nations began a game of &quot;leap frogging&quot; to win further concessions from the oil companies after following Gaddafi's lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;bare_url&quot; /&gt;

Gaddafi and the Shah of Iran both argued for quadrupling the cost of oil in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RIAsAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=Dc0EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5528,4519454 |title=Shah Wants An Increase |work=Herald-Journal|date=24 December 1975 |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, Gaddafi allegedly organized the [[OPEC siege|hostage incident at OPEC]] in Vienna, Austria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ion Mihai Pacepa |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/205932/berlins-new-anti-american-axis/ion-mihai-pacepa# |title=Berlin's New Anti-American Axis|publisher=National Review|accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Establishment of the Jamahiriya===
[[File:Flag of Libya (1977).svg|thumb|300px|[[Flag of Libya|Flag]] of the [[Great Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] (1977-2011)]]
From 1971 to 1977, Gaddafi approved the [[Arab Socialist Union (Libya)|Arab Socialist Union]], modeled on Egypt's [[Arab Socialist Union (Egypt)|Arab Socialist Union]], to function as a political party in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/home/world-news/article/16053514 |title=Gaddafi's Former Deputy Defects, Rebels Say |work=Sky News |location=UK|date= 20 August 2011|accessdate=21 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 the rank of [[Major General]] was conferred upon him by his own [[Arab Socialist Union (Libya)|Arab Socialist Union]]'s National Congress. Gaddafi accepted the honorary rank, but stated that he would continue to be known as &quot;Colonel&quot; and to wear the rank insignia of a Colonel when in uniform.&lt;ref name=Gaddafi-rank&gt;Library of Congress Country Study, 1988, [http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query2/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+ly0153%29 Uniforms, Ranks, and Insignia of the Armed Forces]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 March 1977, the GPC, at Gaddafi's behest, adopted the &quot;Declaration of the Establishment of the People's Authority&quot; and proclaimed the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. In the official political philosophy of Gaddafi's state, the &quot;Jamahiriya&quot; system was unique to the country, although it was presented as the materialization of the Third International Theory, proposed by Gaddafi to be applied to the entire Third World. From 1977 onward, the [[Libyan Arab Jamahiriya]] officially declared itself to be a [[direct democracy]] state in which the people ruled themselves through local popular councils and communes, named [[Basic People's Congress (political)|Basic People's Congress]]es, where all adult Libyans were allowed to participate and vote on national decisions.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_robbins&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters_oil&quot;/&gt; These people's congresses were, in principle, the country's highest authority, with major decisions proposed by government officials or Gaddafi himself requiring the consent of the people's congresses.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters_oil&quot;/&gt; Despite officially stepping down from power in 1977 and no longer holding any governmental position, Gaddafi continued to exert considerable influence over the country's affairs, with many of his critics insisting that the structure of Libya's direct democracy gave him &quot;the freedom to manipulate outcomes&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_robbins&quot;/&gt; comparing him to a [[demagogue]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes_green&quot;/&gt; The other surviving members of the [[Libyan Revolutionary Command Council]] remained with positions in office by virtue of leading the revolution and were thus not subject to election.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

Gaddafi's image in the Arab world was damaged severely in 1978 when Shia imam [[Musa al-Sadr]] disappeared ''en route'' to Libya.&lt;ref name=&quot;time.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Blanford |first=Nicholas |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2053630,00.html |title=Is the Missing Shi'ite Cleric Imam Musa Sadr Alive in Libya? |work=TIME |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Libyan government consistently denied responsibility, but Lebanon held Gaddafi responsible, and continues to do so. Allegedly, [[Yasser Arafat]] asked Gaddafi to eliminate al-Sadr because of his opposition to Palestinians in the [[Lebanese Civil War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;time.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;huffingtonpost.com&quot;/&gt; In 1981, Shia Lebanese vigilantes hijacked two Libyan aircraft, demanding information on al-Sadr's whereabouts. Shia Muslims across the Arab world continue to view Gaddafi negatively since this incident. His relations with Shia-populated Lebanon and Iran soured as a result (though he did support Iran later on during the [[Iran-Iraq War]], somewhat improving his image there).&lt;ref name=&quot;countrystudies.us&quot;/&gt; Lebanon formally indicted Gaddafi in 2008 for al-Sadr's disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Asharq Al-Awsat]]'', 27&amp;nbsp;August&amp;nbsp;2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7584557.stm |title=Gaddafi charged for cleric kidnap|publisher=BBC News |date=27 August 2008 |accessdate=14 February 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaddafi had offered a fully unified state where Sadat would be president and he would be defence minister. Sadat distrusted Gaddafi and refused. Gaddafi was further disappointed with Egypt's political system, as he spoke to Egypt's [[Arab Socialist Union (Egypt)|Arab Socialist Union]] and was suggested &quot;a partial merger, in order to allow time for thorough and careful study&quot;.

Although all Arab governments endorsed the idea in principle, most observed that conditions were not right for putting it into practice or that unity would come only at the end of a long process of historical evolution. But Qadhafi rejected these views. As he conceived it, Arab unity was not an ideal but a realistic goal. He agreed that achieving Arab unity was a process that required sequential and intermediate stages of development, but the challenge he posed to other Arab leaders was that the process had to begin somewhere. Qadhafi expressed his determination to make a contribution to the process and offered Libya as the leavening agent. Throughout 1970 Qadhafi consulted with Egyptian and Sudanese leaders about how to achieve some form of union. Nasser died in September 1970, but Egyptian participation in the unity talks continued under his successor, President Anwar as Sadat. It was the young Qadhafi, however, who moved to assume Nasser's mantle as the ideological leader of Arab nationalism.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi felt that the war wasted resources and manpower to chase limited objectives, and accused Sadat of trying to weaken the [[Federation of Arab Republics|FAR]] by launching the War. According to Gaddafi, Assad and Sadat were foolish to fight for small areas of Israeli-occupied territory when the entire land could be returned to the Palestinians outright. He said, &quot;I will participate only in a war if the aim is to oust the usurpers and send the Jews back to Europe from where they have come since 1948 to colonize an Arab land. Jews from Arab countries ...are our cousins... they will live amongst us in peace as they have done for the past centuries.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=s5wQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wZADAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6881,5735400 |title=Gaddafi stirs Arab leaders |work=The Age|date=24 October 1973 |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaddafi's relationship with Egypt further weakened because he opposed a cease-fire with Israel and called Sadat a coward for giving up after one Israeli counteroffensive. Gaddafi also believed that the Soviet Union and the United States would join forces with Israel, and would deploy troops on the [[demarcation line]]s to invade and &quot;colonize&quot; the Arab nations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated5&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.un.org/unpd/wpp/Excel-Data/mortality.htm |title=World Population Prospects, the 2010 Revision |publisher=United Nations |date=28 June 2011 |accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anwar Sadat was equally angry with Gaddafi and revealed that he was responsible for foiling a 1973 submarine attack Libya planned for sinking the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2]] during an Israeli cruise. Gaddafi fired back, saying the Arabs could have destroyed Israel within 12 hours if they had adopted a sound strategy. Gaddafi charged Egyptian reporters with the breakdown of Libyan-Egyptian relations in 1973, and said Sadat was partly to blame because he had &quot;no control&quot; of Egyptian information media.&lt;ref name=&quot;stannik&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=El Dorado Canyon: Reagan's undeclared war with Qaddafi | publisher=US Naval Institute Press | author=Stanik, Joseph T. | date=December 2002 | isbn=978-1-55750-983-3 | quote=In a speech delivered only hours after the assassination of Sadat, Qaddafi applauded the killing and remarked that 'the sound of the bullets that resounded firmly and courageously in the face of al-Sadat this morning was in fact saying this is the punishment of those who betray the Arab nation.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egypt's peace talks in 1977 led to the [[Steadfastness and Confrontation Front]], a group Gaddafi formed to reject the recognition of the Israeli state. Libya's relations with Egypt broke down entirely that year, leading to the short-lived [[Libyan–Egyptian War]]. During the war, Libya sent its military across the border, but Egyptian forces fought back and forced them to retreat. Gaddafi's animosity with Sadat was so high that in 1981, Gaddafi declared his death a national holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19811012&amp;id=SaErAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=dvwFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2216,2321976 |title=Libya celebrates death of Sadat |work=The Telegraph|date=12 October 1981 |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He called it a just &quot;punishment&quot; for his role in the [[Camp David Accords]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stannik&quot; /&gt;

After Nasser's death, Gaddafi attempted to become the leader of Arab nationalism. He wanted to create a &quot;Great Islamic State of the Sahel&quot;, unifying the Arab states of North Africa into one. As early as 1969, Gaddafi contributed to the Islamization of Sudan and Chad, granting military bases and support to the [[FROLINAT]] revolutionary forces.&lt;ref name=ambiggen/&gt; In 1971, when Muslims took power in Sudan, he offered to merge Libya with Sudan.&lt;ref&gt;Joffe, Lawrence (5 June 2009). &quot;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jun/05/obituary-jaafar-nimeiri Jaafar Nimeiri: Sudanese president who confirmed his land as 'Africa's most dysfunctional country']&quot;, ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gaafar Nimeiry]], the [[President of Sudan]], turned him down and angered Gaddafi by signing a [[Addis Ababa Agreement (1972)|peace settlement]] with the [[Christianity in Sudan|Sudanese Christians]].&lt;ref name=ambiggen&gt;{{cite book|author=Prunier, Gérard|title=Darfur: The Ambiguous Genocide|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2005|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2CV1upnEMmoC|ISBN=0-8014-4450-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi took matters into his own hands in 1972, organizing the [[Islamic Legion]], a paramilitary group, to arabize the region.&lt;ref name=prunier45&gt;G.

Through the 1970s and 1980s, Gaddafi led an armed conflict against Chad, and occupied the [[Aouzou strip]]. During the 1970s, two Muslim leaders, [[Goukouni Oueddei]] and Habre, were fighting against the Christian southerners for control of Chad. Gaddafi supported them, and when they seized control in 1979, he offered to merge with Chad. Goukouni turned him down, and Gaddafi withdrew Libyan troops in 1981 because of growing opposition from France and neighboring African nations. Gaddafi's withdrawal left Goukouni vulnerable in Chad, and in 1982, his former partner, Habre, led a coup to remove him from Chad. Gaddafi helped Goukouni regain territory in Chad, and fought with Habre's forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926091-4,00.html | work=Time | first1=William E. | last1=Smith | first2=Thomas A. | last2=Sancton | first3=John | last3=Borrell | title=Chad: One for Gaddafi | date=22 August 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a side note, Gaddafi's occupation of Chad led to the liberation of French archaeologist [[Françoise Claustre]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/csmonitor_historic/access/184339712.html?dids=184339712:184339712&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Feb+01%2C+1977&amp;author=By+Jim+Browning+Special+to+The+Christian+Science+Monitor&amp;pub=Christian+Science+Monitor&amp;desc=Libyans+the+liberators+in+%27Claustre+affair%27&amp;pqatl=google |title=Libyans the liberators in 'Claustre affair' |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=1 February 1977 |accessdate=1 September 2011 |first=Jim |last=Browning}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Gaddafi engaged in a full-out war with Chad, suffering a humiliating loss in 1987 during the [[Toyota War]].

He also promised to pay reparations for the damage done to Chad, and promised financial support to fight poverty.

During the early 1980s, the committees established by Gaddafi had considerable power and became a growing source of tension within the Jamihiriya,&lt;ref name=&quot;vandewalle_124&quot;/&gt; to the extent that Gaddafi sometimes criticized their effectiveness and excessive repression,&lt;ref name=&quot;ham_40_1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vandewalle_124&quot;/&gt; until the power of the Revolutionary Committees were eventually restricted in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;vandewalle_124&quot;/&gt; Libya faced internal opposition during the 1980s because of the highly unpopular [[Chadian–Libyan conflict|war with Chad]].

Gaddafi also sought close relations with the [[Soviet Union]] and purchased arms from the [[Soviet bloc]].

===Lockerbie bombing===
{{Main|Pan Am Flight 103}}
During Gaddafi's time in power, the Libyan government was implicated in the financing of many anti-western groups, including several terror plots. The [[Black Panther Party]], [[Nation of Islam]], and the [[Irish Republican Army]] all allegedly had links to Muammar Gaddafi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/people/muammar-al-qaddafi-39014 |title=Muammar al-Qaddafi Biography - Facts, Birthday, Life Story |publisher=Biography.com |date= |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due of Libya's links to Irish terrorism, the [[United Kingdom]] cut off diplomatic relations with Libya for more than a decade. However, in the most famous instance, Libya was implicated in the 1988 [[Pan Am Flight 103|Lockerbie bombing]]. During this event, the plane [[Pan Am Flight 103]], carrying 270 people exploded near [[Lockerbie, Scotland]], killing 270 people. On 22 February 2011 during the [[Libyan civil war]], the former Libyan Justice Minister [[Mustafa Abdul Jalil]] in an interview with the Swedish newspaper &quot;[[Expressen]]&quot;, claimed to have evidence that Muammar Gaddafi had personally ordered the bombing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Muammar Gaddafi ordered Lockerbie bombing, says Libyan minister|url=http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/muammar-gaddafi-ordered-lockerbie-bombing-says-libyan-minister/story-e6frfku0-1226011070628|accessdate=23 February 2011|newspaper=news.com.au|date=24 February 2011}} citing an original interview with Expressen in Sweden: {{Cite news|title=Khadaffi gav order om Lockerbie-attentatet [Gaddafi ordered the Lockerbie bombing]|url=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/1.2341356/khadaffi-gav-order-om-lockerbie-attentatet|accessdate=23 February 2011|date=23 February 2011}} [http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=sv&amp;u=http://www.expressen.se/nyheter/1.2341356/khadaffi-gav-order-om-lockerbie-attentatet&amp;ei=M1FlTc-NCsqBOqz6mJUG&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBQQ7gEwAA&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dhttp://www.expressen.se/nyheter/1.2341356/khadaffi-gav-order-om-lockerbie-attentatet%26num%3D100%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26client%3Dopera%26hs%3DsZz%26rls%3Den%26channel%3Dsuggest%26prmd%3Divns English translation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/3884974/Thats-for-Lockerbie-Gaddafi.html | location=London | work=The Sun | first=Virginia | last=Wheeler}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, U.S. warplanes carried out bombings in Libya, in a failed attempt to kill Gaddafi.

Despite backing pro-democracy causes in Africa, Gaddafi fuelled rebellions in countries such as [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]], as well as having a close relationship to [[Uganda]]'s infamous dictator [[Idi Amin]], whom he sponsored and advised. When Amin's government began to crumble, Gaddafi sent troops to [[Uganda–Tanzania War|fight against Tanzania]] on behalf of Amin, and 600 Libyan soldiers were killed during combat operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;stanik23&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=El Dorado Canyon: Reagan's undeclared war with Qaddafi|author=Joseph T. Stanik|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Ugandan President [[Yoweri Museveni]] who had played major role in overthrowing [[Idi Amin]] said in February, &quot;Muammar Gaddafi, whatever his faults, is a true nationalist. I prefer nationalists to puppets of foreign interests.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_africa&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Chothia|first=Farouk|title=What does Gaddafi's death mean for Africa?|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-15392189|accessdate=29 October 2011|date=21 October 2011|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Museveni also said &quot;Therefore, the independent-minded Gaddafi had some positive contribution to Libya, I believe, as well as Africa and the Third World [...] We should also remember, as part of that independent-mindedness, he expelled British and American military bases from Libya [after he took power].&quot;

Gaddafi ran a school near [[Benghazi]] called the World Revolutionary Center (WRC). A notable number of its graduates have seized power in African countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard for Tyrants&quot;/&gt; [[Blaise Compaoré]] of [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Idriss Déby]] of Chad were graduates of this school, and are currently in power in their respective countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;school for scoundrels&quot;/&gt; Gaddafi trained and supported [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]] of [[Liberia]], [[Foday Sankoh]], the founder of [[Sierra Leone]]'s [[Revolutionary United Front]], and [[Jean-Bédel Bokassa]], the Emperor of the [[Central African Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stanik23&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;leedavis16&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|1990|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi also financed [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]]'s military junta in Ethiopia, which was later convicted of one of the deadliest genocides in modern history.&lt;ref name=&quot;leedavis16&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Muammar al-Gaddafi-6-30112006.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Muammar Gaddafi at the podium the first Africa-Latin America summit, in 2006, in [[Abuja]] ([[Nigeria]]), speaking before the Commission Chairman of the African Union [[Alpha Oumar Konaré]] and President of Brazil [[Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva]]]]
In a BBC interview, Kenya's Foreign Minister [[Moses Wetangula]] said the Libyan leader sometimes showed a violent side at African Union meetings, saying &quot;He really suppressed Libyan people and vanquished them to the extent that in one of many AU meetings we saw him slap his foreign minister in our presence, which is something unexpected of any dignified and self-respecting head of state.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_africa&quot;/&gt; [[Robert Mugabe]], the President of Zimbabwe since 1980 having spearheaded Zimbabwe's independence struggle, remained a staunch ally of Col. Gaddafi until the Libyan ruler's death.

In Europe, Gaddafi had close ties with [[Serbia]]n and later [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] President [[Slobodan Milošević]], and with the controversial [[Austria]]n politician [[Jörg Haider]]. According to the [[Daily Mail]], Jörg Haider received tens of millions of dollars from both Gaddafi and Saddam Hussein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1300028/Did-Austrian-far-right-leader-Joerg-Haider-receive-funding-Saddam-Gaddafi.html|title=Did Austrian far-right leader receive hidden £40m fortune thanks to funding from Saddam and Gaddafi? |date=4 August 2010|publisher=The Mail Online|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi also aligned himself with the [[Orthodox Serbs]] against Muslims in [[Bosnia]] and [[Kosovo]], supporting Milošević even when he was charged with [[Operation Horseshoe|large-scale ethnic cleansing against Albanians in Kosovo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Radio Free Europe |title=Qaddafi's Serbian TV Interview Result Of Close Belgrade-Tripoli Ties |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/article/2323834.html |date=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Qaddafi's Yugoslav friends |date=25 February 2010 |work=The Economist |url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2011/02/libyas_balkan_connections}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaddafi developed an ongoing relationship with the revolutionary [[Colombia]]n [[Marxist–Leninist]] guerrilla group [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]], becoming acquainted with its leaders at meetings of revolutionary groups which were regularly hosted in Libya.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard for Tyrants&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2011/03/04/harvard_for_tyrants |title=Harvard for Tyrants |date=4 March 2011 |publisher=The Foreign Policy |author=Douglas Farah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;school for scoundrels&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/858166-revealed-colonel-gaddafis-school-for-scoundrels |author=James Day|title=Revealed: Colonel Gaddafi's school for scoundrels |publisher=Metro |date=15 March 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Falklands War]] Gaddafi provided the Argentinian regime with 20 launchers and 60 SA-7 missiles, as well as machine guns, mortars and mines. These were delivered in four trips by two Boeing 707 of the AAF, refuelled in [[Recife]] with the knowledge and consent of the Brazilian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diarioperfil.com.ar/edimp/0551/articulo.php?art=27476&amp;ed=0551 |title=episodio durante la guerra en mayo de 1982 - Kadafi fue un amigo solidario de la dictadura durante Malvinas |publisher=Diario Perfil |accessdate=4 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaddafi developed a friendship with [[Hugo Chávez]], and in March 2009, Libya's Olympics Committee named a stadium after the [[Venezuela]]n leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tripolipost.com/articledetail.asp?c=1&amp;i=2914 |title=Libya Names Stadium after Hugo Chavez |publisher=Tripolipost.com|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strategic analysis groups, along with Colombian president [[Juan Manuel Santos]] reported that both Chávez and Gaddafi supported the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC), which produces &quot;more than half of the world’s cocaine,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard for Tyrants&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The FARC Files: Venezuela, Ecuador and the Secret Archive of ‘Raúl Reyes’

Now we have to fight to build our own power.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{registration required|date=November 2011}}{{Cite news

After the 1979 [[Iranian Revolution]] that brought [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] to power, Gaddafi became one of the first leaders to congratulate and offer support to the then fledgling [[Islamic Republic]]. Gaddafi, who had long opposed the Shah for his support of American/British policies and his previous relations with King Idris, reversed many policies that had strained the relations between the two countries. While relations did substantially improve, the long term effect was that it alienated him from his previous pan-Arab beliefs and became more Islamist, such as recognizing the islands of [[Greater and Lesser Tunbs]] and [[Abu Musa]] as Iranian rather than Emirati and gave crucial military support to Iran during the [[Iran-Iraq War]]. He publicly stated his support to other Arab and Persian Gulf countries, urging them to stand beside their &quot;Islamic Brothers&quot;. However, fearing Shi'ite or Islamic Revolutions of their own should Saddam fall, they instead cut off relations with Gaddafi and supported Iraq (the only exception being [[Hafez Al-Assad]]). Although the disappearance of [[Musa Al-Sadr]] did sour relations, the Iranian government did not publicly implicate Gaddafi at the time and Iran continued to consider Libya (along with Syria) as its only reliable ally for many years. Only much later, after the end of the war, did Al-Sadr's disappearance reemerge as an issue between the two countries. Later on, Supreme Leader [[Ali Khamenei]] visited Libya, one of only times he left Iran as Supreme Leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2011/10/22/173060.html|work=Al Arabiya |accessdate=19 August 2012|title=Tehran switches gear in its relationship with Tripoli after Qaddafi’s death|date=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even during the Libyan Civil War, there were apparent divisions in the government on whether to support Gaddafi or not, between those who continued to view Gaddafi as a hero for his support of Iran during the war and those who viewed him as responsible for Al-Sadr's disappearance. Early in the conflict, Iran reiterated at the UN its support for &quot;the importance of respecting national sovereignties and disallowing certain powers to bypass international law and intervene under guises such as 'humanitarian intervention'&quot;. Later on however, did the state-run ''[[Kayhan]]'' newspaper condemn Gaddafi for his suppression of the rebels. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iranreview.org/content/Documents/Iran_in_a_Dilemma_over_Libya.htm|work=Iran Review|accessdate=19 August 2012|title=Iran in a Dilemma over Libya|date=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his support of Iran, Saddam Hussein broke off relations with Gaddafi in 1980 until 1991, when after the [[Persian Gulf War]] and the international Sanctions against Iraq, Gaddafi (who was facing sanctions of his own due to the Lockerbie bombing) once again came out in support of Saddam and helped assist the Iraqi Government in circumventing Import restrictions and offering limited military assistance. Libya was also one of the only countries to accept Iraqi Passports and have an embassy in Baghdad (and vice versa for Iraq). In 1999, Gaddafi awarded his [[Al-Gaddafi International Prize for Human Rights]] to the &quot;Children of Iraq&quot;. However, Saddam never forgot Gaddafi's support for Iran and while the relations were cordial, Gaddafi and Saddam would never meet from 1991 until the overthrow of Saddam in 2003.

===Focus on activities in Africa===

In the early 1980s, Gaddafi played a key role in the [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] in South Africa. His image as a revolutionary inspired many South Africans to fight for their liberation, and he was largely responsible for funding and arming the Anti-Apartheid Movement as it fought the [[Apartheid]] regime and [[White South African|white minority]] rule. As a result, Gaddafi began gaining considerable popularity in South Africa and other African countries. He was also responsible for supporting and funding [[Nelson Mandela]]'s election campaign. He continued to maintain a close friendship with Mandela, who named his grandson after Gaddafi. In turn, Mandela later played a key role in helping Gaddafi gain mainstream acceptance in the Western world later in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_africa&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mandela_speech&quot;&gt;&quot;It was pure expediency to call on democratic South Africa to turn its back on Libya and Qaddafi, who had assisted us in obtaining democracy at a time when those who now made that call were the friends of the enemies of democracy in South Africa.&quot; [http://www.info.gov.za/speeches/1999/990614123p1003.htm SPEECH BY PRESIDENT NELSON MANDELA AT A LUNCHEON IN HONOUR OF MUAMAR QADDAFI, LEADER OF THE REVOLUTION OF THE LIBYAN JAMAHARIYA, Cape Town, 13 June 1999] 
&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, Gaddafi would be seen as a hero in much of Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailytimes_ng&quot;/&gt; In 2008, after being declared &quot;King of Kings&quot; by African traditional rulers in Libya, Gaddafi said:

{{Cquote|We want an African military to defend Africa, we want a single African currency, we want one African passport to travel within Africa|author=Muammar Gaddafi&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_africa&quot;/&gt;}}

In 1998, Gaddafi turned his attention away from Arab nationalism. He eliminated a government office in charge of promoting pan-Arab ideas and told reporters &quot;I had been crying slogans of Arab Unity and brandishing standard of Arab nationalism for 40 years, but it was not realised. That means that I was talking in the desert. I have no more time to lose talking with Arabs...I am returning back to realism...I now talk about Pan-Africanism and African Unity. The Arab world is finished...Africa is a paradise...and it is full of natural resources like [[water]], [[uranium]], [[cobalt]], [[iron]], [[manganese]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oocities.org/~dagmawi/News/News_Sep17_Gadhafi.html |title=Libya's Gaddafi turns attention to black Africa |publisher=Oocities.org |date=16 September 1998 |accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Public television]] networks switched from Middle-Eastern soap operas to African themes involving slavery. The background of a unified Arab League that had been a staple of Libyan television for over two decades was replaced by a map of Africa. Gaddafi said, &quot;Libya is an African country. May [[God in Islam|Allah]] help the Arabs and keep them away from us. We don't want anything to do with them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_africa&quot;/&gt; Gaddafi sported a map of Africa on his outfits from then forward, and further stated that, &quot;I would like Libya to become a black country. Hence, I recommend to Libyan men to marry only black women and to Libyan women to marry black men.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libyanet.com/1098nwsc.htm |title=Libya: News and Views |publisher=Libyanet.com |accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/02/news/mn-28652 |title=Kadafi Lambastes Arab Allies' Stance in Pan Am Blast Case|work=The Los Angeles Times|date=2 October 1998 |accessdate=1 September 2011 |first=John |last=Daniszewski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to supporting African movements, such as the [[African National Congress]] in South Africa, Liberian rebels during the [[First Liberian Civil War]], and cetain factions in the [[Sierra Leone Civil War]],&lt;ref name=&quot;dailytimes_ng&quot;/&gt; his support also sometimes went to leaders described by the United Nations as dictators and warlords. Gaddafi used anti-Western rhetoric against the UN, and complained that the [[International Criminal Court]] was a &quot;new form of world terrorism&quot; that wanted to recolonize developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2009-03-30/gaddafi-slams-icc-as-new-form-of-world-terrorism/1634646 |title=Gaddafi slams ICC as 'new form of world terrorism' |date=30 March 2009|accessdate=21 January 2012 |work=Australian Broadcasting Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi opposed the ICC's arrest warrant for Sudan's president [[Omar al-Bashir]] and personally gave refuge to [[Idi Amin]] in Libya after his fall from rule in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Keatley |first=Patrick |title=Obituary: Idi Amin |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries |work=The Guardian|location=United Kingdom |date=18 August 2003 |accessdate=18 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Special Court for Sierra Leone]], [[Charles Taylor (Liberia)|Charles Taylor]]'s orders for &quot;The amputation of the arms and legs of men, women, and children as part of a scorched-earth campaign was designed to take over the region’s rich diamond fields and was backed by Gaddafi, who routinely reviewed their progress and supplied weapons&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;school for scoundrels&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;economistfall&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.economist.com/world/international/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9441341 |title= How the mighty are falling | accessdate=17 July 2007 | date=5 July 2007 |work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi intervened militarily in the [[Central African Republic]] in 2001 to protect his ally [[Ange-Félix Patassé]] from overthrow. Patassé signed a deal giving Libya a 99-year lease to exploit all of that country's natural resources, including [[uranium]], copper, diamonds, and oil.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard for Tyrants&quot;/&gt; Gaddafi acquired at least 20 luxurious properties after he went to rescue [[Robert Mugabe]] in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard for Tyrants&quot;/&gt;

Gaddafi's strong military support and finances gained him allies across the continent. He was bestowed with the title &quot;''King of Kings of Africa''&quot; in 2008, as he had remained in power longer than any African king. Gaddafi was celebrated in the presence of over 200 African traditional rulers and kings, although his views on African political and military unification received a lukewarm response from their governments.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc7588033&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7588033.stm |title=Gaddafi: Africa's king of kings |publisher=BBC News |date=29 August 2008|accessdate=14 February 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; His 2009 forum for African kings was canceled by the Ugandan hosts, who believed that traditional rulers discussing politics would lead to instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7825843.stm|title=''Uganda bars Gaddafi kings' forum'' |publisher=BBC News |date=13 January 2009 |accessdate=14 February 2010 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1&amp;nbsp;February&amp;nbsp;2009, a '[[coronation]] ceremony' in [[Addis Ababa]], Ethiopia, was held to coincide with the 53rd African Union Summit, at which he was elected head of the African Union for the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Malone|first=Barry|title=Gaddafi pushes for union after election to head AU|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/02/02/idUKL2210323|accessdate=2 September 2011|date=2 February 2009|agency=Reuters|work=Reuters UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; When his election was opposed by an African leader, Gaddafi arranged with [[Silvio Berlusconi]] to have two escorts sent to that leader to have him change his mind.

In 1986, 2000, and the months prior to the 2011 civil war, Gaddafi announced plans for a unified African [[gold dinar]] currency, to challenge the dominance of the US$ and Euro currencies. The African dinar would have been measured directly in terms of gold, which would mean a country’s wealth would depend on how much gold it had rather than how many dollars it traded, allowing a greater sharing of the wealth and self-determination in Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saving the world economy from Gaddafi|url=http://rt.com/news/economy-oil-gold-libya/|accessdate=29 October 2011|date=5 May 2011|work=[[RT (TV network)|Russia Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘High-class terrorists running US, UK and France’|url=http://rt.com/news/europe-usa-libya-gaddafi-425/|accessdate=29 October 2011|date=21 October 2011|work=[[RT (TV network)|Russia Today]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Gaddafi was overjoyed by the [[Maghreb Pact]] between Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia, Algeria, and Libya. Gaddafi saw the Pact as a first step towards the formation of &quot;one invincible Arab nation&quot; and shouted for a state &quot;from Marrakesh to Bahrain&quot;, pumping his fists in the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ozNAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=O1kMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5058,5224658 |title=Maghreb pact fulfils decades-old dream |work=The Glasgow Herald|date=18 February 1989 |accessdate=14 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 Gaddafi expelled 30,000 [[Palestinian refugee|Palestinian]]s living in Libya, a response to the peace negotiations that had commenced between Israel and the [[Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.mit.edu/V115/N40/arab.40w.html|title=Tech.mit.edu|publisher=Tech.mit.edu |date=12 September 1995 |accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1981, Gaddafi feared that the Reagan Administration would combat his leadership and sought to reduce his maverick image. He and his cabinet talked frequently about the pullout of American citizens from Libya. Gaddafi feared that the United States would be plotting economic sanctions or military action against his government.

For three years, he had refused to [[extradite]] two Libyan intelligence agents indicted for planting a bomb on [[Pan Am Flight 103]]. South African president [[Nelson Mandela]], who took special interest in the issue, negotiated with the United States on Gaddafi's behalf. Mandela and Gaddafi had forged a close friendship starting with his release from prison in 1990. Mandela persuaded Gaddafi to hand over the defendants to the [[Scottish Court in the Netherlands]], where they faced trial in 1999.

Gaddafi's government faced growing opposition from Islamic extremists during the 1990s, particularly the [[Libyan Islamic Fighting Group]], which nearly assassinated him in 1996. Gaddafi began giving counter-terrorism intelligence to MI6 and the CIA in the 1990s, and issued the first arrest warrant for [[Osama bin Laden]] in 1998, after he was linked to the killing of German anti-terrorism agents in Libya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/gaddafis-libya-reminds-us-it-issued-the-first-bin-laden-arrest-warrant/2011/05/04/AFLEJJqF_story.html |title=Gaddafi’s Libya reminds U.S. it issued the first bin Laden arrest warrant |work=The Washington Post |date= 5 May 2011|accessdate=1 September 2011 |first=Keith B. |last=Richburg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi also accused the United States of training and supporting bin Laden for war against the Soviet Union.

Intelligence links from Gaddafi's regime to the U.S. and the U.K. deepened during the George W. Bush administration; the CIA began bringing alleged terrorists to Libya for torture under the &quot;extraordinary rendition&quot; program. Some of those renditioned were Gaddafi's political enemies, including one current rebel leader in the 2011 NATO-backed war in Libya. The relationship was so close that the CIA provided &quot;talking points for Gaddafi, logistical details for [rendition] flights, and what seems to have been the bartering of Gaddafi’s opponents, some of whom had ties to Islamist groups, for his cooperation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/closeread/2011/09/eighty-nine-questions-what-did-libya-do-for-the-cia.html |title=Eighty-nine questions: What did Libya do for the CIA? |publisher=The New Yorker Online |date= 9 September 2011|accessdate=27 September 2011 |first=Amy |last=Davidson}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his speech, Gaddafi criticized the United Nations' inability to prevent wars, saying that &quot;sixty-five aggressive wars took place without any collective action by the United Nations to prevent them.” Gaddafi noted the Iraq war in particular as being the &quot;mother of all evils&quot; and suggested that those who caused the “mass murder” committed there be tried, and also defended the right of the [[Taliban]] to establish an Islamic emirate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neil MacFarquhar&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Neil MacFarquhar|location= New York |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/24/world/24nations.html |title=Libyan Leader Delivers a Scolding in U.N.

It may have been put together in a lab by the military…. We do sometimes make viruses in a laboratory and then they make viruses for capitalist companies who will make vaccinations and make money.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Neil MacFarquhar&quot;/&gt; Gaddafi also demanded a thorough re-investigation of the [[Assassination of John F.

Gaddafi main point was the inequality of the United Nations, which gives five permanent members of the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]] more power than the all the other nations that make up the General Assembly. Gaddafi criticized the Security Council, saying the council “is political feudalism for those who have a permanent seat [...] it should not be called the Security Council, it should be called the terror council. Permanent is something for God only. We are not fools to give the power of veto to great powers so they can use us and treat us as second-class citizens.”&lt;ref name=&quot;Neil MacFarquhar&quot;/&gt; At one point in his speech, Colonel Gaddafi waved a copy of the [[United Nations Charter]] and seemed to tear it, saying he did not recognize the authority of the document. He suggested that the United Nations headquarters be moved to Libya. Further, Gaddafi repeated his longstanding proposal that [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian territories]] be combined into one state called Isratine. While being critical of the United States and its foreign policy, Gaddafi praised the idea that the United States had elected [[Barack Obama]] president, whom Gaddafi referred to as a “son of Africa”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ed Pilkington&quot;/&gt; Gaddafi said, &quot;Obama is a glimpse in the darkness after four or eight years.

Government officials said that Muammar Gaddafi and his wife were visiting the home when it was struck, but both were unharmed. Gaddafi son's death came one day after the Libyan leader appeared on state television calling for talks with NATO to end the airstrikes which had been hitting Tripoli and other Gaddafi strongholds since the previous month. Gaddafi suggested there was room for negotiation, but he vowed to stay in Libya. Western officials remained divided over whether Gaddafi was a legitimate military target under the [[United Nations Security Council]] resolution that authorized the air campaign. [[U.S. Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert Gates]] said that NATO was &quot;not targeting Gaddafi specifically&quot; but that his command-and-control facilities were legitimate targets—including a facility inside his sprawling Tripoli compound that was hit with airstrikes 25 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first1=Simon|last1=Denyer|first2=Leila|last2=Fadel|title=Gaddafi’s youngest son killed in NATO airstrike; Russia condemns attack|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/gaddafi-calls-for-cease-fire-as-nato-strikes-tripoli/2011/04/30/AF1jZsNF_story.html|accessdate=21 January 2012|work=Washington Post|date=30 April 2011|location=Tripoli|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, an investigation carried out by [[Amnesty International]] found that many of the allegations against Gaddafi and the Libyan state turned out to either be false or lack any credible evidence, noting that rebels appeared to have knowingly made false claims or manufactured evidence. According to the Amnesty investigation, the number of casualties was heavily exaggerated, some of the protesters may have been armed, &quot;there is no proof of mass killing of civilians on the scale of Syria or Yemen,&quot; there is no evidence that aircraft or heavy anti-aircraft machine guns were used against crowds, and there is no evidence of African mercenaries being used, which it described as a &quot;myth&quot; that led to lynchings and executions of [[black people]] by rebel forces. It criticized the &quot;Western [[Media bias|media coverage]]&quot; which &quot;has from the outset presented a very one-sided view of the logic of events, portraying the protest movement as entirely peaceful and repeatedly suggesting that the regime's security forces were unaccountably massacring unarmed demonstrators who presented no security challenge.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AmnestyRape&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/amnesty-questions-claim-that-gaddafi-ordered-rape-as-weapon-of-war-2302037.html|title=Amnesty questions claim that Gaddafi ordered rape as weapon of war|date=24 June 2011|work=The Independent|location=London |accessdate=26 June 2011|first=Patrick|last=Cockburn}}&lt;/ref&gt;

And so I am announcing today that, until an interim authority is in place, the United States will recognize the TNC as the legitimate governing authority for Libya, and we will deal with it on that basis.&quot; Gaddafi responded to the announcement with a speech on Libyan national television, in which he said &quot;Trample on those recognitions, trample on them under your feet&amp;nbsp;... They are worthless&quot;.&lt;ref name=INDtncofficialgov/&gt;

On 25 August 2011, with most of Tripoli having fallen out of Gaddafi's control, the [[Arab League]] proclaimed the anti-Gaddafi National Transitional Council to be &quot;the legitimate representative of the Libyan state&quot;, on which basis Libya would resume its membership of the League.&lt;ref name=taipeitimmes20110826&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/front/archives/2011/08/26/2003511688 |title=Arab League gives its full backing to Libya's rebel council |work=The Taipei Times|date=26 August 2011 |accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 August 2011, after the capture of his stronghold of Bab al-Azizia by rebel forces, a photo album filled with pages of pictures of [[Condoleezza Rice]] was discovered inside the compound; the discovery was confirmed by an AP reporter, though it could not be confirmed that the album had belonged to Gaddafi. In a 2007 television interview, Gaddafi had previously praised Rice, saying &quot;I support my darling black African woman.

==Ideology==
{{main|Political ideology of Muammar Gaddafi}}
[[File:Green book.jpg|thumb|Parts 1 (English edition) and 3 (Russian edition) of Gaddafi's ''[[The Green Book (Libya)|Green Book]]'']]

On the Muslim prophet [[Muhammad]]'s birthday in 1973, Gaddafi delivered his famous &quot;Five-Point Address&quot; which officially implemented [[Sharia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mohamed Eljhami&quot;/&gt; Gaddafi's ideology was largely based on [[Nasserism]], blending [[Arab nationalism]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; aspects of the [[welfare state]], and what Gaddafi termed &quot;popular democracy&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathaba.net/gci/theory/gb1.htm#popular |title=The Green Book, First Volume &quot;The Solution of the Problem of Democracy&quot;, Popular Conferences and People's Committees. &quot;Popular Conferences are the only means to achieve popular democracy&quot; |publisher=Mathaba.net |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or more commonly &quot;direct, [[popular democracy]]&quot;. He called this system &quot;[[Islamic socialism]]&quot;, as he disfavored the [[atheism|atheistic]] quality of communism. While he permitted private control over small companies, the government controlled the larger ones. Welfare, &quot;liberation&quot; (or &quot;emancipation&quot; depending on the translation),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathaba.net/gci/theory/gb2.htm#DOMESTIC |title=The Green Book, Second Volume &quot;The Solution of the Economic Problem&quot;, Domestic Servants |publisher=Mathaba.net |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and education&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathaba.net/gci/theory/gb3.htm#EDUCATE |title=The Green Book, Third Volume &quot;The Social Basis of the Third World Theory&quot;, Education |publisher=Mathaba.net |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; were emphasized. He also imposed a system of Islamic morals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathaba.net/gci/theory/gb1.htm#law |title=The Green Book, First Volume &quot;The Solution of the Problem of Democracy&quot;, The Law of Society |publisher=Mathaba.net |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Constitutional Declaration of Libya, Article 2. «The Holy Qur'an is the social code in the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, since authority belongs solely to the people, by whom it is exercised through people's congresses, people's committees, trade unions, federations and professional associations (the General People's Congress, the working procedures of which are established by law).»&lt;/ref&gt; and outlawed imbibing alcohol and gambling. School holidays were cancelled to allow the teaching of Gaddafi's ideology in the summer of 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mohamed Eljhami&quot;/&gt;

From early in his rule he acquired a reputation for unpredictability and eccentricity. He once said that HIV was &quot;a peaceful virus, not an aggressive virus&quot; and assured attendees at the [[African Union]] that &quot;if you are [[heterosexuality|straight]] you have nothing to fear from AIDS&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rulebreaking&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb1402/is_2_25/ai_n29060112/ |title=The rule-breaking conduct of Qaddafi's Libya |date=November 2003 |publisher=Strategic Review for Southern Africa |work=Strategic Review for Southern Africa |first=Deon |last=Geldenhuys}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that the [[Influenza A virus subtype H1N1|H1N1]] [[influenza]] virus was a biological weapon manufactured by a foreign military, and he assured Africans that the [[tsetse fly]] and [[mosquito]] were &quot;God's armies which will protect us against colonialists&quot;. Should these 'enemies' come to Africa, &quot;they will get [[malaria]] and [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rulebreaking&quot;/&gt; On one occasion, he was reported to have said that the Christian Bible was a &quot;forgery&quot;.&lt;ref name=Thome&gt;{{cite web|last=Thome |first=Wolfgang H. |url=http://www.eturbonews.com/1880/gaddafi-causes-a-stir-opens-new-national-mosq |title=Libya Gaddafi causes a stir, opens new national mosque in Uganda |publisher=eTurboNews.com |date=25 March 2008 |accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gaddafi had also been labeled a proponent of Islamic socialism, a system of government adopted by some Muslim countries which marries the teachings of Islam with the economic principles of socialism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mahalo.com/islamic-socialism/ |title=islamic-socialism |publisher=Mahalo.com |accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support for the Nation of Islam ===
[[Nation of Islam]] leader [[Louis Farrakhan]] called Gaddafi a &quot;friend and Muslim brother who's lent the Nation of Islam movement $8 million over the years&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Farrakhan: Libya has lent Nation of Islam millions,&quot; Associated Press, 31 March 2011. http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20110401/ap_on_re_us/us_nation_of_islam_farrakhan&lt;/ref&gt; Farrakhan explained, &quot;I love Moammar Gadhafi, and I love our president. It grieves me to see my brother president set a policy that would remove this man not only from power, but from the earth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt; Farrakhan portrayed Gaddafi as a fellow revolutionary and longtime friend to the Nation of Islam, which reportedly used $3 million it borrowed from Libya in the 1970s to acquire the building and land which formerly housed the St. Constantine &amp; Helen Greek Orthodox Church on [[Chicago]]'s [[South Side, Chicago|South Side]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Years later, a $5 million loan was used to pay back taxes and costs for the home of the movement's former leader Elijah Muhammad.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Despite Gaddafi's connection to the Lockerbie Bombing, Farrakhan said, &quot;I don't care what Gadhafi has done wrong, he is not the 'mad dog of the Middle East.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; A song by Belgian electronic musicians [[Front 242]] entitled &quot;Funkahdafi&quot; begins with a clip of a speech in which Farrakhan is introducing Gaddafi to an assembly.

===Campaign against Berber culture===
Gaddafi often expressed an overt contempt for the culture of the [[Berber people|Berbers]], a non-Arab people of North Africa, and for [[Berber languages|their language]], maintaining that the very existence of Berbers in North Africa is a myth created by colonialists. He adopted new names for Berber towns, and on official Libyan maps, referred to the [[Nafusa Mountains]] as the &quot;Western mountains&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sherlock |first=Ruth |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/Rockets-and-rhetoric-from-proGaddafi.6799873.jp?articlepage=1 |title=Rockets and rhetoric from pro-Gaddafi PR offensive |work=The Scotsman|accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1985 speech, he said of the Berber language, &quot;If your mother transmits you this language, she nourishes you with the milk of the colonialist, she feeds you their poison&quot; (1985).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201103200010.html |title=Libya: Gaddafi Rails Against 'No Fly' Attacks and Berbers |date=20 March 2011 |publisher=allAfrica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Berber language was banned from schools and up until 2009, it was illegal for parents to name their children with Berber names.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shabablibya.org/news/april-2011/week-commencing-april-18-2011/libyan-man-says-gaddafi-crushing-berbers |title=Libyan man says Gaddafi crushing Berbers &quot; Shabab Libya |publisher=Shabablibya.org |accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berbers living in ancient mud-brick caravan towns such as [[Ghadames]] were forced out and moved into modern government-constructed apartments in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;SalakLibya&quot;/&gt; During the 2011 civil war, Berber towns rebelled against Gaddafi's rule and sought to reaffirm their ancient identity as Berbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ghaith Abdul-Ahad in Zentan |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/28/libya-amazigh-identity-tribes-gaddafi |title=Libya's Berbers join the revolution in fight to reclaim ancient identity|work=The Guardian|location=London |date= 28 February 2011|accessdate=1 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/2011/07/11/ancient-language-renewed-in-libyan-rebellion/ |title=Ancient language renewed in Libyan rebellion|work=National Post|accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laub |first=Karin |url=http://arabnews.com/middleeast/article481156.ece |title=With rebels in charge, life returns to Libyan town |publisher=Arab News |accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi's government strengthened anti-Berber sentiment among Libyan Arabs, weakening their opposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/4d2f617c-b090-11e0-a5a7-00144feab49a.html#axzz1U7rcs8EK |title=Anti-Gaddafi Berbers tune in to new freedom |work=Financial Times|date=17 July 2011 |accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the rising international oil prices began to raise Gaddafi's revenues in the 1970s, Gaddafi spent much of the revenues on arms purchases and on sponsoring his political projects abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/18239888 |title=Endgame in Tripoli |date=24 February 2011 |work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi's relatives adopted lavish lifestyles, including luxurious homes, Hollywood film investments and private parties with American pop stars.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/24/world/africa/24qaddafi.html?pagewanted=all | title=Shady Dealings Helped Qaddafi Build Fortune and Regime|work=The New York Times|date=24 March 2011|first1=Eric|last1=Lichtblau|first2=David|last2=Rohde|first3=James|last3=Risen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/blogs/democracyinamerica/2011/04/libya|title=One reason Qaddafi might fold|work=The Economist | date=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Economy of Libya]] was [[planned economy|centrally planned]] and followed Gaddafi's socialist ideals. It benefited greatly from revenues from the [[petroleum industry|petroleum sector]], which contributed most export earnings and 30% of its GDP. These oil revenues, combined with a small population and by far Africa's highest Education Index gave Libya the highest [[List of countries by GDP (nominal) per capita|nominal GDP per capita]] in [[Economy of Africa|Africa]]. Between 2000 and 2011, Libya recorded favourable growth rates with an estimated 10.6 percent growth of GDP in 2010, the highest of any state in Africa. Gaddafi had promised &quot;a home for all Libyans&quot; and during his rule, new residential areas rose in empty Saharan regions. Entire populations living in mud-brick caravan towns were moved into modern homes with running water, electricity, and satellite TV.&lt;ref name=&quot;SalakLibya&quot;/&gt;

At the time Gaddafi died, some of the worst economic conditions were in eastern Libya.&lt;ref name=&quot;econ470&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;econ9900&quot;/&gt; 97% of urban dwellers have access to &quot;improved sanitation facilities&quot; in Libya, this was 2% points lower than the [[OECD]] average, or 21% points above the world average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/topic/urban-development |title= In the first fifteen years of Gaddafi rule, the number of doctors per capita increased by seven times, with the number of hospital beds increasing by three times. |publisher=Data.worldbank.org |accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Gaddafi's rule, infant mortality rates went from 125 per 1000 live births, about average for Africa at the time, to 15 per 1000, the best rate in Africa.

On 4 March 2008, Gaddafi announced his proposal to dissolve the country's existing administrative structure and disburse oil revenue directly to the people. The plan included abolishing all ministries; except those of defence, internal security, and foreign affairs, and departments implementing strategic projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=19968&amp;prog=zgp&amp;proj=zdrl,zme#news |title=Libya: Ministries Abolished |publisher=Carnegieendowment.org |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His reason for this plan was because he believed that the ministries were failing to manage the country’s oil revenues.&lt;ref name=&quot;MEED 2008-03-03&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaddafi threatens to abolish government ministries|url=http://www.meed.com/sectors/economy/gaddafi-threatens-to-abolish-government-ministries/850614.article|accessdate=29 October 2011|date=3 March 2008|work=[[MEED]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi claimed he was planning to combat corruption in the state by proposing reforms where oil profits are handed out directly to the country's five million people&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters_handout&quot;/&gt; rather than to government bodies, stating that &quot;as long as money is administered by a government body, there would be theft and corruption.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_handout&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Gaddafi 'to hand out oil money'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7591458.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=23 October 2011|date=1 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi urged a sweeping reform of the government [[bureaucracy]], suggesting that most of the cabinet system should be dismantled to &quot;free Libyans from red tape&quot; and &quot;protect the state's budget from corruption.&quot; According to Western diplomats, this move appeared to be aimed at putting pressure on the government to speed up reforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters_handout&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Libya's Gaddafi tells govt to hand out oil money|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2008/05/08/libya-oil-gaddafi-idUKL0829452920080508|accessdate=30 October 2011|date=8 May 2008|agency=[[Reuters]]|work=Reuters UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaddafi claimed that the ministries were failing to manage the country’s oil revenues,&lt;ref name=&quot;MEED 2008-03-03&quot;/&gt; and that his &quot;dream during all these years was to give power and wealth directly to the people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters_oil&quot;/&gt;

A national vote on Gaddafi's plan to disband the government and give oil money directly to the people was held in 2009, where Libya's people's congresses, the country's highest authority, voted to delay implementation. The [[General People's Congress (Libya)|General People's Congress]] announced that, out of 468 [[Basic People's Congress (country subdivision)|Basic People's Congress]]es, 64 chose immediate implementation while 251 endorsed implementation &quot;but asked for (it) to be delayed until appropriate measures were put in place.&quot; This plan led to [[dissent]] from top government officials, who claimed it would &quot;wreak havoc&quot; in the economy by &quot;fanning inflation and spurring [[capital flight]].&quot; Gaddafi acknowledged that the scheme, which promised up to 30,000 [[Libyan dinar]]s ($23,000) annually to about a million of Libya's poorest, may &quot;cause chaos before it brought about prosperity,&quot; but claimed that &quot;Do not be afraid to experiment with a new form of government&quot; and that &quot;This plan is to offer a better future for Libya's children.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters_oil&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Libyan congresses delay Gaddafi's oil shareout plan|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2009/03/03/libya-oil-idUKL359112620090303|accessdate=30 October 2011|date=3 March 2009|agency=[[Reuters]]|work=Reuters UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Libya delays Gaddafi oil plan|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/africa/2009/03/200933183343913989.html|accessdate=30 October 2011|date=3 March 2009|publisher=Al Jazeera}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009, Gaddafi personally told government officials that Libya would soon experience a &quot;new political period&quot; and would have elections for important positions such as minister-level roles and the National Security Advisor position (a Prime Minister equivalent). He also promised to include international monitors to ensure fair elections. His speech was said to have caused quite a stir. These elections were planned to coincide with the Jamahiriya's usual periodic elections for members of the Popular Committees, [[General People's Committee|Basic People's Committees]], [[Basic People's Congress (political)|Basic People's Congress]]es, and [[General People's Congress (Libya)|General People's Congress]], in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/wikileaks-files/libya-wikileaks/8294906/AL-QADHAFI-SUGGESTS-LIBYAN-ELECTIONS-MAY-BE-IN-THE-OFFING.html |title=Al-Qadhafi Suggests Libyan Elections May Be In The Offing |work=Telegraph |date=31 January 2011 |accessdate=1 September 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2012.

==Assassination attempts and plots==
* In 1969, the British [[Special Air Service]] (S.A.S.) was contacted by the Libyan [[Idris of Libya|Royal Family]] and planned an assassination to restore the Libyan monarchy. The plan was dubbed the &quot;Hilton Assignment&quot;, named after a Libyan jail. The plan was to release 150 political prisoners from a jail in Tripoli as a catalyst for a general uprising. The prisoners would be recruited for a coup attempt, and the British agents would leave them to take over the nation. The plan was called off at a late stage by the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] because the United States government decided that Gaddafi was anti-[[Marxist]] and therefore acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geraghty|first=Tony|title=Who Dares Wins: The Story of the Special Air Service, 1950–1982 |year=1983 |publisher=Fontana |location=London|isbn=978-0-00-636678-2|pages=1–7, 124–125|edition=2nd|authorlink=Tony Geraghty}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Seale |first1=Patrick |authorlink1=Patrick Seale|title=The Hilton Assignment|year=1973|publisher=Temple Smith|location=London|isbn=978-0-85117-047-3|coauthors=McConville, Maureen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1976, Tunisia's state television reported that Gaddafi had been fired at by a lone assailant. None of the shots hit him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Shots fired at Gaddafi|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=kvhjAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WeYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6088,6116155|accessdate=31 August 2011|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=20 April 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1981, French president [[Valéry Giscard d'Estaing]] plotted an assassination with Egypt. His administration spoke with the Reagan administration for approval, but the United States did not support the measure. The plot was abandoned after Giscard d'Estaing's term in office ended.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|1990|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Paris 'had plan to kill Libyan leader'|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vzMRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wZQDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4674,340768|accessdate=29 August 2011|newspaper=The Age|date=17 November 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In 1986, the [[Bombing of Libya (1986)|United States bombed Libya]], including Gaddafi's family compound in the vast [[Bab al-Azizia]] Barracks in southern [[Tripoli]]. The [[U.S. Government]] consistently said that the bombings were &quot;surgical strikes&quot; and were not intended to kill Gaddafi. However, Lt Col. [[Oliver North]] did devise a plot at the time to lure Gaddafi into his compound using [[Terry Waite]]. The plot violated United States law, which prohibited assassinations, and was never put into action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=North wanted to use Waite as lure, claim reporters|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=5zNAAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=T1kMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1869,3440245|accessdate=31 August 2011|newspaper=[[The Herald (Glasgow)]]|date=13 June 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 April, Gaddafi and his family fled his compound in the [[Bab al-Azizia]] Barracks moments before it was bombed. He received a phone call the night of 15 April, warning him about an attack. The origin of the phone call remains under speculation, but Maltese Prime Minister [[Karmenu Mifsud Bonnici]] and Italian politician [[Bettino Craxi]] have been primary suspects.

The coup attempt was crushed by the [[Libyan Air Force (1951-2011)|Libyan Air Force]], which was entirely made of members of the [[Qadhadhfa]] tribe, which Gaddafi belonged to. The tribal tensions that resulted with the Warfalla and the [[Magariha]] caused Gaddafi to place his second-in-command, [[Abdessalam Jalloud]], a Magariha, under house arrest, and led to oppression of the Warfalla.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Libya – Tribal Rivalries|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6511/is_4_44/ai_n28948866/|accessdate=29 August 2011|publisher=[[BNET]]|date=14 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rebellion was largest in the city of [[Misrata]].

===Flight to Algeria===
As the [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|Battle for Tripoli]] reached a climax in mid-August 2011, the family was forced to abandon their fortified compound. With the [[National Transitional Council]] in almost complete control of the country, on 27 August it was reported by the [[Egypt]]ian news agency [[MENA (news)|Mena]] that Libyan rebel fighters had seen six armoured [[Mercedes-Benz]] sedans, possibly carrying top Gaddafi regime figures, cross the border at the south-western Libyan town of [[Ghadames]] towards [[Algeria]],&lt;ref name=Guard20110829/&gt; which at the time was denied by the Algerian authorities. 

On 29 August, the [[Algerian government]] officially announced that Safia together with daughter Ayesha and sons Muhammad and Hannibal, had crossed into Algeria early on Monday 29 August.&lt;ref name=Guard20110829&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/aug/29/gaddafi-family-escape-libya-algeria|title=Gaddafi's family escape Libya net to cross into Algeria|work=The Guardian|location=London |date=29 August 2011|accessdate=29 August 2011|first1=Luke|last1=Harding|first2=Martin|last2=Chulov|first3=Chris|last3=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14709896|title=Libya conflict: Gaddafi family 'flee to Algeria'|publisher=BBC News |date=29 August 2011|accessdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Algerian Foreign Ministry official said all the people in the convoy were now in [[Algiers]], and that none of them had been named in warrants issued by the [[International Criminal Court]] for possible war crimes charges. [[Mourad Benmehidi]], the Algerian permanent representative to the United Nations, later confirmed the details of the statement. The family had arrived at a [[Sahara desert]] entry point, in a Mercedes and a bus at 8:45&amp;nbsp;am local time. The exact number of people in the party was unconfirmed, but there were &quot;many children&quot; and they did not include Colonel Gaddafi. As a result, the group was allowed in on humanitarian grounds, and the Algerian government had since informed the head of the Libyan National Transitional Council, who as of yet has made no official request for their return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/30/world/africa/30libya.html|title=Qaddafi’s Wife and 3 of His Children Flee to Algeria|work=Washington Post|date=29 August 2011|accessdate=29 August 2011|first1=Kareem|last1=Fahim|first2=Neil|last2=MacFarquhar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==

Gaddafi held an [[Doctor honoris causa|honorary degree]] from [[Megatrend University]] in [[Belgrade]], which was conferred upon him by former Yugoslavian president [[Zoran Lilić]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://standartnews.com/en/article.php?d=2007-03-03&amp;article=3589| publisher=Standart News|language=Bulgarian|title=Impostor Defends Bulgarian Nurses before Gaddafi| date=3 March 2007 |accessdate=6 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal wealth==
Italian companies had a strong foothold in Libya. In January 2002 Gaddafi purchased a 7.5% share of Italian football club [[Juventus]] for US$21&amp;nbsp;million, through the Libyan Arab Foreign Investment Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/personal-finance/investing/471331-1.html |title=Lafico |publisher=Allbusiness.com |accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed a long-standing association with Italian industrialist [[Gianni Agnelli]] and car manufacturer Fiat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Muammar Gaddafi: the wise investor|publisher=Business Today|date=7 November 2001|url=http://www.businesstoday.com.mt/2001/1107/focus.html |accessdate=9 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gaddafi had an [[Airbus A340]] [[private jet]], which he bought from [[Al-Waleed bin Talal|Prince Al-Waleed bin Talal]] of [[Saudi Arabia]] for $120&amp;nbsp;million in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{registration required|date=November 2011}}{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/scotland/article6802746.ece|title=Lockerbie bomber’s private jet to freedom courtesy of Gaddafi|work=The Times|location= London |date=20 August 2009| accessdate=29 August 2011|first1= David| last1= Brown |first2= Charlene |last2= Sweeney |first3= Richard| last3= Kerbaj}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operated by [[Tripoli]]-based [[Afriqiyah Airways]] and decorated externally in their colours, it was used in 2009 to repatriate [[Lockerbie bomber]] [[Abdul Baset Ali al-Megrahi]], on his licensed release from prison in Scotland.

==Titles==
A Revolutionary Command Council was formed to rule the country, with Gaddafi as chairman. He added the title of [[Prime Minister of Libya|prime minister]] in 1970, but gave up this title in 1972. Unlike other military revolutionaries, Gaddafi did not promote himself to the rank of general upon seizing power, but rather accepted a ceremonial promotion from lieutenant to [[colonel]]&lt;ref&gt;Keith Haskell, a British diplomat, wrote in the ''Daily Telegraph'' on 26 August 2011 (page 29), that, before the 1969 revolution, Gaddafi was a lieutenant. After the revolution, Gaddafi took on the rank of colonel but he was never a captain. Haskell said the UK embassy office was 100 yards from Gaddafi's headquarters in September 1969 when the revolution started and Haskell met Gaddafi several times in that period. Gaddafi was a lieutenant and was due to be promoted to captain in August 1969 with the rest of his graduating class. However, he and one other were passed over because they were politically suspect. On the day of the revolution, Gaddafi wore a lieutenant's insignia. Gaddafi and other officers in the coup then removed their badges of rank but, from the pinholes in their uniforms, one could make out their former rank.&lt;/ref&gt; and remained at this rank. While at odds with Western military ranking, where a colonel would not rule a country or serve as [[commander-in-chief]] of its military, in Gaddafi's own words Libya's society is &quot;ruled by the people&quot;, so he did not need a more grandiose title or supreme military rank.&lt;ref name=&quot;SalakLibya&quot; /&gt;

==Public image==
In the 1970s, the Western media initially portrayed Gaddafi in a positive manner as a freedom fighter. A ''[[Readers Digest]]'' article at the time, for example, compared his freedom-fighting ideals to [[Che Guevara]] and noted his popularity among Libyans.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailytimes_ng&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Nwonwu|first=Fred|title=Remembering Gaddafi the hero|url=http://dailytimes.com.ng/blog/remembering-gaddafi-hero|accessdate=29 October 2011|newspaper=[[Daily Times of Nigeria]]|date=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This changed in the 1980s, when Gaddafi began being frequently portrayed a dictator and tyrant who was erratic, conceited, and mercurial in nature. During the Reagan administration, the United States regarded him as &quot;public enemy number one&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/03/04/134228864/for-reagan-gadhafi-was-a-frustrating-mad-dog |title=For Reagan, Gadhafi Was A Frustrating 'Mad Dog' |publisher=NPR |accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Reagan famously dubbed him the &quot;mad dog of the Middle East&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://middleeast.atspace.com/article_1786.html |title=The Makeover: Libya's Muammar Qaddafi |publisher=Middleeast.atspace.com |date=19 January 2003 |accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In keeping with the negative image of Gaddafi held by the West, writer [[Tahar Ben Jelloun]] was quoted as saying:

{{Cquote|Succeeding in forcing an entire people on its knees, making it endorse extravagant and irrational concepts, keeping it in ignorance and poverty: this is what this man, who has survived 42 years without ever hesitating to suffocate any attempt at opposition, has achieved.

However, some were more supportive of Gaddafi's regime and ideology. [[Yasser Arafat]], who aligned himself with Gaddafi for much of his career, said Gaddafi was the &quot;knight of revolutionary phrases&quot;. On Gaddafi's resistance to the 2011 uprising, [[Cuba]]'s [[Fidel Castro]] commented that, &quot;If he resists and does not yield to their demands, he will enter history as one of the great figures of the Arab nations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama.am/en/politics/2011/04/29/f-kastro/ |title=Fidel Castro: If Gaddafi resists he will enter history as one of the great figures of the Arab nations |publisher=Panorama.am |date=29 April 2011 |accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venezuelan President [[Hugo Chavez]] -- one of Gaddafi's few allies on the international stage—said that the former Libyan leader will be remembered “as a great fighter, a revolutionary and martyr&quot; on 20 October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/news/regions/americas/venezuela/chavez-speaks-out-gaddafi-death |title=Chavez speaks out on Gaddafi death |publisher=GlobalPost |date=20 October 2011 |accessdate=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manny Ansar, director of a popular annual music festival in [[Mali]], said:

He modeled many of his political ideals from the likes of [[Kwame Nkrumah]], [[Gamal Abdul Nasser]] and [[Mao Zedong]].

Gaddafi and his government helped finance [[Moustapha Akkad]]'s film ''[[Lion of the Desert]]'' (1981) starring [[Anthony Quinn]] as Libyan resistance leader [[Omar Mukhtar]].&lt;ref&gt;Alex von Tunzelmann, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2011/jun/30/lion-of-the-desert-libya-gaddafi Lion of the Desert roars for Libya's rebels], The Guardian Film Blog, 30 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Shakespeare, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookreviews/9176632/Unpicking-Gadaffi.html Book Reviews: Unpicking Gadaffi], Telegraph, 30 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gaddafi feminist.jpg|thumb|240px|Gaddafi with his [[Amazonian Guard]]]]
In contrast to his often negative image in the West, Gaddafi's image has mostly been positive in much of Africa, where he is often seen as a &quot;hero&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailytimes_ng&quot;/&gt; [[Nelson Mandela]], whose [[Anti-Apartheid Movement]] was supported and funded by Gaddafi, remained a close friend, named his grandson after Gaddafi, and helped him gain mainstream Western acceptance in the 1990s. Following Gaddafi's death, Mandela was quoted as saying, &quot;In the darkest moments of our struggle, when our backs were to the wall, Muammar Gaddafi stood with us.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_africa&quot;/&gt;

Gaddafi funded the construction of and supported two mosques in Africa. One is the largest mosque in Uganda, located on [[Kampala Mosque|Kampla Hill]] in the Old Kampala district of Kampala, Uganda.&lt;ref name=Thome /&gt; The other being the Freetown Central Mosque at Rokupa in the east-end of Freetown, Sierra Leon where a vigil was held when he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.sl/drwebsite/publish/article_200518994.shtml|title= Sierra Leone Muslims Plan Vigil for Gaddafi|author=Aruna Turay|publisher=Awareness Times Newspaper|location=Freetown, Sierra Leone|date=24 October 2011|accessdate=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his own estimation, Gaddafi considered himself an intellectual and philosopher.&lt;ref name=&quot;personalprofile&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12488278 |title=Profile: Muammar Gaddafi |publisher=BBC|date=27 June 2011 |accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His former aides said he was &quot;obsessive&quot; about his image. He gave gold watches with images of his face to his staff as gifts. In 2011, a Brazilian [[plastic surgery|plastic surgeon]] told the [[Associated Press]] that Gaddafi had been his patient in 1995 to avoid appearing old to the Libyan people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/03/25/gaddafi-plastic-surgery-_n_840480.html |title=Gaddafi's Plastic Surgery: Brazilian Surgeon Claims He Operated On Dictator |work=Huffington Post|accessdate=1 September 2011 |date=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for a flamboyant dress sense, ranging from [[safari suit]]s and sunglasses to more outlandish outfits apparently influenced by [[Liberace]] or Hollywood film characters.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC]] [[Newsnight]], 21 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He changed his clothing several times each day, and according to his former nurses, &quot;enjoy[ed] surrounding himself with beautiful things and people.&quot;

His inner circle stated that he could only stay on the ground floor of buildings, and that he could not climb more than 35 steps.

The Libyan postal service, [[General Posts and Telecommunications Company]] (GPTC), has issued numerous stamps, [[souvenir sheets]], [[postal stationery]], booklets, etc. relating to Gaddafi.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott catalogue]] n.583 – [[Michel catalog]] (block 18)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libyan-stamps.com |title=Libyan Stamps online |publisher=Libyan-stamps.com |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transcription of his Arabic name==
Because of the lack of standardization of [[Romanization of Arabic|transcribing written and regionally pronounced Arabic]], Gaddafi's name has been [[romanization|romanized]] in many different ways. Even though the Arabic spelling of a word does not change, the pronunciation may vary in different [[varieties of Arabic]], which may suggest a different romanization. In [[Literary Arabic]], the name {{lang|ar|مُعَمَّر القَذَّافِي}} can be pronounced {{IPA|/muˈʕammaru lqaðˈðaːfiː/}}. [[gemination|Geminated]] consonants can be simplified. In [[Libyan Arabic]], {{IPAslink|q}} ({{lang|ar|[[ق]]}}) is replaced with {{IPAblink|ɡ}}; and {{IPAslink|ð}} ({{lang|ar|[[ذ]]}}), as [[Th (digraph)#Voiced /ð/|&quot;th&quot; in &quot;this&quot;]], is replaced with {{IPAblink|d}}. Vowel {{IPAblink|u}} often alternates with {{IPAblink|o}} in pronunciation in other regions. Thus, {{IPA|/muˈʕammar alqaðˈðaːfiː/}} is normally pronounced in Libyan Arabic {{IPA|[muˈʕæmmɑrˤ əlɡædˈdæːfi]}}. The definite article [[al-]] ({{lang|ar|ال}}) is often omitted.

In August 2011, following the capture of Gaddafi's compound in Tripoli in the later stages of the [[Libyan civil war]], Gaddafi's diplomatic passport was discovered. The Latin transcription of his surname on the passport read &quot;Al-Gathafi&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/mysteries-solved-gaddafis-passport-suggests-an-unusual-spelling-of-his-name/ |title=Gaddafi Spelling &amp;#124; Gaddafi Passport &amp;#124; Gathafi &amp;#124; Real Spelling of Gaddafi |publisher=Mediaite |date=25 August 2011 |accessdate=25 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This spelling corresponds to the title of the homepage of ''algathafi.org'', which reads &quot;Welcome to the official site of Muammar Al Gathafi&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.algathafi.org/html-english/index.htm |title=Gaddafi's personal website |publisher=Algathafi.org |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

&quot;Muammar Gaddafi&quot; is the spelling used by ''Time'', ''[[Newsweek]]'', [[Reuters]], [[BBC News]], the majority of the British press, the English service of [[Al Jazeera]], and the [[English Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=31 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Associated Press]], [[MSNBC]], [[CNN]], [[NPR]], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]], and the majority of the Canadian press use &quot;Moammar Gadhafi&quot;. The [[Library of Congress]] uses &quot;Qaddafi, Muammar&quot; as the primary name. ''The [[Edinburgh Middle East Report]]'' uses &quot;Mu'ammar Qaddafi&quot; and the [[United States Department of State|U.S. Department of State]] uses &quot;Mu'ammar Al-Qadhafi&quot;, although the [[White House]] chooses to use &quot;Muammar el-Qaddafi&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jesse Lee |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2011/02/25/president-obama-libya-these-sanctions-therefore-target-qaddafi-government-while-prot?utm_source=wh.gov&amp;utm_medium=shorturl&amp;utm_campaign=shorturl |title=President Obama on Libya: &quot;These Sanctions Therefore Target the Qaddafi Government, While Protecting the Assets that Belong to the People of Libya&quot;, The White House |publisher=White House|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Xinhua News Agency]] uses &quot;Muammar Khaddafi&quot; in its English reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2009-02/04/content_10764270.htm |title=AU elects Khaddafi as chairman, no immediate forming of union gov't |publisher=Xinhua|date=4 February 2009 |accessdate=14 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' uses &quot;Muammar el-Qaddafi&quot;.

In 1986, Gaddafi reportedly responded to a [[Minnesota]] school's letter in English using the spelling &quot;Moammar El-Gadhafi&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Second-Graders Get Letter From Khadafy.&quot; [[Associated Press]], 16 May 1986: Domestic News.&lt;/ref&gt; Until that point, his name had been pronounced with an initial 'k' in English.

A 2007 interview with Gaddafi's son [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]] confirms that he uses the spelling &quot;Qadhafi&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/videos/2011/03/01/saif-gaddafi-on-how-to-spell-his-last-name.html |title=Saif Gaddafi on How to Spell His Last Name |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=1 March 2011 |accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Muhammad Gaddafi]]'s official passport uses the spelling &quot;Al-Gathafi&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=The Atlantic|title=Rebel Discovers Qaddafi Passport, Real Spelling of Leader's Name|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2011/08/rebel-discovers-qaddafi-passport-real-spelling-of-leaders-name/244077/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4g_8zBdwzk |title=Mohamed Al-Gaddafi's Passport August&amp;nbsp;24, 2011 |publisher=YouTube |date=24 August 2011 |accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published in the London ''[[Evening Standard]]'' in 2004 lists a total of 37 spellings of his name, while a 1986 column by ''[[The Straight Dope]]'' quotes a list of 32 spellings known from the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{Anchor|bracket_chart}}In short, the alternative spellings for each part of his name are shown in brackets:
&lt;center&gt;&lt;math&gt;{\color{OliveGreen}\text{M}
\begin{cases}\text{u}\\\text{o}\\\text{ou}\end{cases}
\begin{cases}\varnothing\\\text{'}\end{cases}
\begin{cases}\varnothing\\\text{a}\end{cases}
\begin{cases}\text{mm}\\\text{m}\end{cases}
\text{a}
\text{r}}
~~~~
{\color{MidnightBlue}\begin{cases}\text{Al}\\\text{al}\\\text{El}\\\text{el}\\\varnothing\end{cases}
\begin{cases}\text{-}\\\textvisiblespace\\\varnothing\end{cases}}
{\color{RedViolet}\begin{cases}\text{Q}\\\text{G}\\\text{K}\\\text{Kh}\end{cases}
\text{a}
\begin{cases}\text{d}\\\text{dh}\\\text{dd}\\\text{dhdh}\\\text{th}\\\text{zz}\end{cases}
\text{a}
\begin{cases}\text{f}\\\text{ff}\end{cases}
\begin{cases}\text{i}\\\text{y}\end{cases}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/center&gt;
Not all are possible, as some alternatives are most probably combined with others, or even impossible with others (for example, simplification of geminated {{IPA|/mm/}} usually implies simplification of {{IPA|/aː/}}).

The Arabic verb قَذَفَ ''qaðafa'' has various meanings centering on &quot;he threw&quot;.
