[[Richard Girnt Butler]] founded the group in the 1970s, as an arm of the [[Christian Identity]] organization [[Church of Jesus Christ–Christian]].

==History==
The origin of Aryan Nations is in the teachings of [[Wesley Swift]], a significant figure in the early [[Christian Identity]] movement. Swift combined [[British Israelism]], extreme [[antisemitism]] and political militancy. He founded his own church in California in the mid-1940s, and he had a daily radio broadcast in California during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1957, the name of his church was changed to the Church of Jesus Christ-Christian, which is used today by Aryan Nations churches.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADL-AryanN&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/Aryan_Nations.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=3&amp;item=an  | title=Extremism in America: Aryan Nations/Church of Jesus Christ Christian | publisher = [[Anti-Defamation League]] | year= 2007 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2007-07-18| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5x8bud3Xk| archivedate = 2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s until 2001, the Aryan Nations headquarters was in a 20-acre (81,000 m²) compound 1.8 miles north of [[Hayden Lake, Idaho|Hayden Lake]], [[Idaho]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ADL-AryanN&quot; /&gt; There were a number of state chapters, only loosely tied to the main organization. The group ran an annual World Congress of Aryan Nations at Hayden Lake for Aryan Nations members and members of similar groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADL-AryanN&quot; /&gt;

Until 1998, the leadership of Aryan Nations remained firmly in the hands of [[Richard Girnt Butler]]. By that time he was over 80 years old and had been in poor health for some time. At the annual Aryan Nations World Congress, Neuman Britton was appointed as the group's new leader. In August 2001, however, Butler appointed Harold Ray Redfeairn from Ohio, who had been agitating for control since the mid-1990s. Previously, Redfeairn brought in Dave Hall, a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] informant who exposed the group's illegal activities.&lt;ref&gt;Dave Hall, Tym Burkey, Katherine Ramsland. ''Into the Devil's Den'', 1st ed., (Ballantine Books, 2008) ISBN 0-345-49694-9 [http://www.intothedevilsden.com/listentointerviews.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Redfeairn was distrusted by some in the group. Redfeairn and [[August Kreis III]], propaganda minister of Aryan Nations, formed a splinter group, and as a result were expelled from the organization by Butler. A few months later, Redfeairn returned to form an alliance with Butler.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADL-AryanN&quot; /&gt;
Butler's World Congress in 2002 drew fewer than 100 people, and when he ran for mayor, he lost, garnering only 50 votes against over 2,100 votes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ButlerObit&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50D1EF93C540C7A8CDDA00894DC404482 | title=Richard G.

At the time of Butler's death, Aryan Nations had about 200 members actively participating in the group.

===Shooting and lawsuit===
&lt;!--linked from redirect [[Keenan v. Aryan Nations]]--&gt;
In September 2000, the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] won a $6.3 million judgment against Aryan Nations from an [[Idaho]] jury who awarded punitive and compensatory damages to plaintiffs Victoria Keenan and her son Jason. The two had been beaten with rifles by Aryan Nations security guards in [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho|Coeur d'Alene]], Idaho in July, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LAW/09/08/morris.dees.profile/ | title=Attorney Morris Dees pioneer in using 'damage litigation' to fight hate groups | publisher=[[CNN]] |date= 2000-09-08 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-08-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071008010401/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/LAW/09/08/morris.dees.profile/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AryanNations&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.splcenter.org/legal/docket/files.jsp?cdrID=30&amp;sortID=0 | title=Keenan v.

In the summer of 2004 the Aryan Nations moved to Sebring, Florida.

In February 2001, the group's Hayden Lake compound and intellectual property, including the names ''Aryan Nations'' and ''Church of Jesus Christ Christian,'' were transferred to the Keenans.&lt;ref name=&quot;AryanNations&quot;/&gt; The Keenans sold the property to Greg Carr, a Southeastern Idaho philanthropist who donated the land to [[North Idaho College]], which designated it as a peace park.&lt;ref name=&quot;ButlerObit&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AryanNations&quot;/&gt; The watchtower was demolished, and the church and meeting hall were burned to the ground during a firefighting exercise.

===Split and decline===
There are three main Aryan Nations factions. One is led by [[August Kreis III]] and Charles John Juba.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADL-AryanN&quot; /&gt; In 2002, Kreis' group was on a {{convert|10|acre|m2|sing=on}} compound in the rural town of [[Ulysses, Pennsylvania|Ulysses]] in [[Potter County, Pennsylvania|Potter County]], North central [[Pennsylvania]], which was host to the 2002 Aryan Nations World Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;2002wackoconference&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = 2007 | url = http://www.aryan-nations.org/about.htm | title = Aryan Nations&amp;nbsp;— About Us| work = | publisher = Aryan Nations | accessdate = 2007-01-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070116233939/http://www.aryan-nations.org/about.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juba resigned in March 2005, announcing Kreis as the group's new leader, with a headquarters in [[Lexington, South Carolina|Lexington]], [[South Carolina]]. In 2005, Kreis received media attention by seeking an Aryan Nations-[[al Qaeda]] alliance.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN2005&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/03/29/schuster.column  | title=An unholy alliance: Aryan Nation leader reaches out to al Qaeda | publisher=[[CNN]] |date= 2005-03-29  | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-09-25| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071106040710/http://www.cnn.com/2005/US/03/29/schuster.column| archivedate= 6 November 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the Holy Order of the [[Phinehas Priesthood]], formerly in association with the faction operated by Kreis, seceded and formed Aryan Nations Revival, based in New York, which was created in opposition to Kreis's acceptance of [[Wicca]], [[Islam]], and [[Odinism]]. The Holy Order viewed this as a deviation from the Christian Identity core belief of Aryan Nations, and this revival rapidly became the largest faction.

Aryan Nations Revival leaders were placed on the Congressional Record as domestic terrorists, and the Holy Order of the Brotherhood of the Phinehas Priesthood was determined to be the enforcement/terrorist wings of Aryan Nations. Aryan Nations Revival hosted a weekly radio broadcast titled &quot;The Aryan Nations Broadcast&quot;, which had more than  100,000 listeners.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Airing from 1979 to 2009, the radio program was authorized by Richard Butler. The broadcast promptly ended when the host, [[Hal Turner]], was arrested for threatening the lives of federal judges in the Chicago area. While incarcerated, Turner announced, through his attorney, that he was a federal informant, and that Aryan Nations was among those informed upon.

In 2009, Aryan Nations Revival based in Texas merged with Pastor Jerald O'Brien's Aryan Nations based in [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho]], since both parties were ardent Christian Identity adherents.&lt;ref name=ADL_Jan09&gt;{{Cite web

In early 2012, Kreis quit the Aryan Nations while in prison, passing leadership to Drew Bostwick.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quit&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.aryan-nations.org/content/desk-administration | title=From The Desk Of The AN Administration | publisher=Aryan Nations |year= 2012 | first= | last=  | accessdate =2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, [[Robert Jay Mathews]], who had visited the Aryan Nations compound many times, formed [[The Order (group)|The Order]], along with Aryan Nations members Dan Bauer, Randy Duey, Denver Parmenter and Bruce Pierce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Order's mission was to bring about a [[race war]], and they committed a number of violent crimes, including [[murder]], between 1983 and 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADL-AryanN&quot; /&gt;  Dennis McGiffen, who also had ties to Aryan Nations, formed a cell called The New Order, based on Mathews' group.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADL-AryanN&quot; /&gt; The members were arrested before they could follow through with their violent plans. [[Buford O.
