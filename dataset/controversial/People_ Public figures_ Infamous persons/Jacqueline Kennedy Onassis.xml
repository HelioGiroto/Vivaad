== Childhood==
'''Jacqueline Lee Bouvier''' was born in [[Southampton (village), New York|Southampton, New York]], to Wall Street stock broker [[John Vernou Bouvier III]] (also known as 'Black Jack Bouvier') and [[Janet Lee Bouvier|Janet Norton Lee]].  Jacqueline's younger sister [[Lee Radziwill|Caroline Lee]]—later known as Lee—was born in 1933. The Bouviers divorced in 1940. Janet Bouvier later married [[Standard Oil]] heir [[Hugh D. Auchincloss, Jr.]] in 1942, and had two more children: [[Janet Auchincloss Rutherfurd|Janet]] and James Auchincloss.

[[File:Jacqueline Bouvier by David Berne, 1935.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Jacqueline Bouvier in 1935.]]
Her mother had [[Irish people|Irish]] ancestry&lt;ref name=&quot;Pottker&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last= Pottker |first= Jan|title=Janet and Jackie: The Story of a Mother and Her Daughter, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|year=2002|publisher= [[St. Martin's Griffin]] |location= [[New York City]] | isbn = 978-0-312-30281-8 }}, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and her father's ancestry included [[French American|French]], [[Scottish American|Scottish]], and [[English People|English]].&lt;ref name=&quot;remarkable&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = Flaherty, Tina|title=What Jackie Taught Us: Lessons from the Remarkable Life of Jacqueline|url=http://books.google.com/?id=fRsJ1HNqp9wC&amp;pg=PT13&amp;lpg=PT13&amp;dq=John+Vernou+Bouvier+III+irish#v=onepage&amp;q=John%20Vernou%20Bouvier%20III%20irish&amp;f=false|accessdate= January 20, 2012|year=2004|publisher=Penguin Group|location=[[New York City]] | isbn = 978-1-101-49427-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her maternal great-grandfather emigrated from [[Cork (city)|Cork, Ireland]], and later became the Superintendent of the New York City Public Schools.  Michel Bouvier, Jacqueline's paternal great-great-grandfather, was born in France and was a contemporary of [[Joseph Bonaparte]] and [[Stephen Girard]]. He was a Philadelphia-based cabinetmaker, carpenter, merchant and real estate speculator.&lt;ref&gt;Pottker, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Michel's wife, Louise Vernou, was the daughter of John Vernou, a French [[émigré]] tobacconist, and Elizabeth Clifford Lindsay, an American-born woman. Jacqueline's grandfather, John Vernou Bouvier Jr., fabricated a more noble ancestry for his family in his vanity family history book, ''Our Forebears''. Recent scholarship and the research done by Jacqueline's cousin [[John H. Davis]] in his book, ''The Bouviers: Portrait of an American Family'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Davis, John H.|title=The Bouviers: Portrait of an American family |year=1995|publisher= National Press Books | isbn = 978-1-882605-19-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have disproved most of these fantasy lineages.

Bouvier spent her early years in [[New York City]] and [[East Hampton (village), New York|East Hampton, New York]], at the Bouvier family estate, &quot;[[Lasata]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;queen&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author = Bradford, Sarah|title=America's Queen: The life of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/books/beginnings/10/24/excerpt.queen.jackie/index.html|accessdate= May 31, 2010|year=2000|publisher=Viking|location=[[New York City]] | isbn = 978-0-670-89191-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following their parents' divorce, the Bouvier sisters divided their time between their mother's homes in [[McLean, Virginia]] and [[Newport, Rhode Island]], and their father's homes in New York City and [[Long Island]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JFKLibrary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/JFK+in+History/Jacqueline+Kennedy+in+the+White+House.htm|title=Jacqueline Kennedy in the White House|accessdate= September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bouvier attended the [[Chapin School (Manhattan)|Chapin School]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacqueline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Glueckstein|first=Fred|title=Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis: Equestrienne|url=http://www.usef.org/_staffIframes/pressbox/images/magazine/pdf/93017f0de13379e1a77c8b63dfa9554f.pdf|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

At a very early age, she became an enthusiastic [[Equestrianism|equestrienne]],&lt;ref name=&quot;JFKLibrary&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacqueline&quot;/&gt; and horse-riding remained a lifelong passion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moon|first=Vicky|title=The Private Passion of Jackie Kennedy Onassis: Portrait of a Rider|year=2005|publisher=Harper Design|isbn=978-0060524111}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and young adulthood ==
Bouvier attended the [[Holton-Arms School]], located in [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]], [[Maryland]], from 1942 to 1944 and [[Miss Porter's School]], located in [[Farmington, Connecticut|Farmington]], [[Connecticut]], from 1944 to 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pottker&quot; /&gt;

When she made her society debut in 1947, Hearst columnist [[Igor Cassini]] dubbed her &quot;[[Debutante#United States|debutante]] of the year.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IgorCassiniObit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/09/arts/igor-cassini-hearst-columnist-dies-at-86.html|title=Igor Cassini, Hearst Columnist, Dies at 86 | author = Severo, Richard|accessdate= January 9, 2002 | work= [[The New York Times]] | date=January 9, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1947, Bouvier spent her first two years of college at [[Vassar College]], located in [[Poughkeepsie (town), New York|Poughkeepsie]], New York, and then spent her junior year (1949-1950) in [[France]]&amp;nbsp;– at the [[University of Grenoble]], located in [[Grenoble]], and at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], located in [[Paris]]&amp;nbsp;– in a [[Student exchange program|study-abroad program]] through [[Smith College]], located in [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The First Ladies Fact Book&amp;nbsp;– The Childhoods, Courtships, Marriages, Campaigns, Accomplishments, and Legacies of Every First Lady from Martha Washington to Michelle Obama| author = Harris, Bill; Ross, Laura|year=2009| publisher = [[Workman Publishing Company|Black Dog and Leventhal Publishers]] | location = [[New York City]] | isbn = 978-1-57912-809-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning home to the U.S., she transferred to [[The George Washington University]], located in [[Washington, D.C.]], graduating in 1951 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[French literature]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstLadies&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.firstladies.org/biographies/firstladies.aspx?biography=36 | title = First Lady Biography: Jackie Kennedy | work = First Ladies' Biographical Information | accessdate = February 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bouvier's college graduation coincided with her sister's high school graduation, and the two spent the summer of 1951 on a trip through Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spoto&quot; /&gt; This trip was the subject of her only autobiographical book, ''One Special Summer,''&amp;nbsp;– co-authored with her sister, which is also the only one of her publications to feature her drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Onassis, Jacqueline Kennedy; [[Lee Radziwill|Radziwill, Lee Bouvier]] |title=One Special Summer|location=[[New York City]]|publisher=[[Delacorte Press]]|year=1974 | isbn = 978-0-440-06037-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following her graduation, Bouvier was hired as &quot;Inquiring Photographer&quot; for ''[[Washington Times-Herald|The Washington Times-Herald]]''. The position required her to pose witty questions to individuals chosen at random on the street and take their pictures to be published  in the newspaper alongside selected quotations from their responses. During this time, she was engaged to a young stock broker, [[John Husted]], for three months.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot; /&gt; Later on in life, Bouvier took continuing education classes in [[American History]] at [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstLadies&quot; /&gt;

== Kennedy marriage and family ==
[[File:Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis2.jpg|thumb|upright|Jacqueline Kennedy at [[Hammersmith Farm]] in Newport, Rhode Island on her wedding day, September 12, 1953.]]
Jacqueline Bouvier and then-[[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[John Kennedy]] belonged to the same social circle and often attended the same functions.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot; /&gt; They were formally introduced by a mutual friend journalist [[Charles L. Bartlett (journalist)|Charles L. Bartlett]], at a dinner party in May 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot; /&gt; Kennedy was then busy running for the [[US Senate]] but after his election in November, the relationship grew more serious and led to their [[engagement]], officially announced on June 25, 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spoto&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Donald|last=Spoto|title=Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis: A Life|year=2000 | isbn = 978-0-312-97707-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They were married on September 12, 1953, at [[St. Mary's Church Complex (Newport, Rhode Island)|St. Mary's Church]] in [[Newport, Rhode Island]], in a Mass celebrated by Boston's Archbishop [[Richard Cushing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=John and Jackie Kennedy's Wedding| work = [[Life (magazine)|Life]]|url=http://www.life.com/image/50476398/in-gallery/22929/john-and-jackie-kennedys-wedding|accessdate=October 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding was considered the social event of the season with an estimated 700 guests at the ceremony and 1,200 at the reception that followed at [[Hammersmith Farm]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfklibrary.org/JFK+Library+and+Museum/News+and+Press/Special+Exhibit+Celebrates+50th+Anniversary+of+the+Wedding+of+Jacqueline+Bouvier+and+John+F+Kennedy.htm jfklibrary.org], Special Exhibit Celebrates 50th Anniversary of the Wedding of Jacqueline Bouvier and John F. Kennedy.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wedding cake was created by Plourde's Bakery in [[Fall River, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Resolving 'Cake-Gate'| author = Bickelhaup, Susan |work = [[The Boston Globe]] | date=June 2, 1997|accessdate=July 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Wedding dress of Jacqueline Bouvier|wedding dress]], now housed in the [[Kennedy Library]] in [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], and the dresses of her attendants were created by designer [[Ann Lowe]] of New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Reed Miller, Rosemary E. |title=The Threads of Time|year=2007 | isbn = 978-0-9709713-0-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newlyweds honeymooned in [[Acapulco]], [[Mexico]], before settling in their new home [[Hickory Hill (McLean, Virginia)|Hickory Hill]] in [[McLean, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Smith, Sally Bedell |title=Grace and Power: The Private World of the Kennedy White House|year=2004 | isbn = 978-0-375-50449-5 |authorlink= Sally Bedell Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behind the glamour, however, the couple had to face several personal setbacks. John Kennedy had some serious health issues then unknown to the public. He suffered from [[Addison's Disease]] and from chronic and at times debilitating back pain due to a war injury. During the fall and winter of 1954, he underwent two delicate spinal operations which almost proved fatal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dallek&quot;&gt;Dallek, Robert. ''An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917 - 1963''. Back Bay Books (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Jacqueline Kennedy suffered a [[miscarriage]] in 1955 and gave birth to a stillborn baby girl in 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reference1A&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Big Year for the Clan|work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=April 26, 1963}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The couple ended up selling their estate Hickory Hill, to [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Kennedy]] and his wife [[Ethel Skakel Kennedy|Ethel]] and their growing family, and bought a townhouse on N Street in [[Georgetown, Washington, DC|Georgetown]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Pottker&quot; /&gt; Jacqueline Kennedy subsequently gave birth to a second daughter, Caroline, in 1957, and a son, John, in 1960, both via [[Caesarian section]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Reference1A&quot; /&gt; A second son, Patrick, was born prematurely in an emergency caesarean section on August 7, 1963 and died two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Beschloss, Michael. |title=Historical Conversations on Life with John F.

=== Campaign for Presidency ===
[[File:Jfk-appleton.jpg|thumb|right|Jacqueline Kennedy campaigning alongside her husband in [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], in March 1960]]
On January 3, 1960, John Kennedy announced his candidacy for the Presidency and launched his nationwide campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Barbara|last=Harrison|first2=Daniel|last2=Terris|title=A Twilight Struggle: The Life of John Fitzgerald Kennedy|year=1992 | isbn = 978-0-688-08830-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Though she had initially intended to take an active role in the campaign, Kennedy learned that she was pregnant shortly after the beginning of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Molly Meijer|last=Wertheime|title=Inventing a Voice: The Rhetoric of American First Ladies of the Twentieth Century|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to her previous difficult pregnancies, Kennedy's doctor instructed her to stay at home.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Carl Sferrazza|last=Anthony|title=As We Remember Her: Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis in the Words of Her Family and Friends|year=2003 | isbn = 978-0-06-017690-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; From Georgetown, Kennedy participated in her husband's campaign by answering letters, taping television commercials, giving televised and printed interviews, and writing a weekly syndicated newspaper column, &quot;Campaign Wife.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot; /&gt; She made rare personal appearances.

Kennedy was fluent in [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and during her husband's campaign for the Presidency, she spoke in [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Polish language|Polish]] in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Camelot's stylish first lady / What Jackie Kennedy wore in Washington influenced more than fashion during the '60s|publisher=Hearst Communications Inc.|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2002-04-03/news/17541815_1_john-f-kennedy-library-white-house-inauguration | first=Edward|last=Epstein|date=June 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the general election on November 8, 1960, John F. Kennedy narrowly beat Republican [[Richard Nixon]] in the [[U.S. presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;Looking Backward: A Reintroduction to American History, by Lloyd C. Gardner, William L.

Like any First Lady, Kennedy was thrust into the spotlight and while she did not mind giving interviews or being photographed, she preferred to maintain as much privacy as possible for herself and her children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/first_ladies/jacquelinekennedy |title=Jacqueline Kennedy biography |accessdate= September 30, 2009 |publisher= [[White House]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy is remembered for reorganizing entertainment for White House social events, restoring the interior of the presidential home, her taste in clothing worn during her husband's presidency, her popularity among foreign dignitaries, and leading the country in mourning after JFK's 1963 assassination.

Kennedy ranks among the most popular of First Ladies.&lt;ref name=&quot;GallupWomen&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/3415/most-admired-men-women-19481998.aspx |title=Gallup Most Admired Women, 1948–1998 |accessdate=August 18, 2009 |publisher=Gallup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Social success ===
As First Lady, Kennedy devoted much of her time to planning social events at the White House and other state properties. She often invited artists, writers, scientists, poets, and musicians to mingle with politicians, diplomats, and statesmen. She also began to let guests at The White House drink cocktails, to give the mansion a more relaxed feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Baldrige, Letitia|title=In the Kennedy Style&amp;nbsp;– Magical Evenings in the Kennedy White House|publisher= [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleda]]y|year=1998 | isbn = 978-0-385-48964-5 |authorlink= Letitia Baldrige}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps due to her skill at entertaining, Kennedy proved quite popular among international dignitaries. When [[Premier of the Soviet Union|Soviet Premier]] [[Nikita Khrushchev]] was asked to shake President Kennedy's hand for a photo, Khrushchev said, &quot;I'd like to shake her hand first.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Perry, Barbara A.|title=Jacqueline Kennedy: First Lady of the New Frontier|publisher=University Press of Kansas|year=2009 | isbn = 978-0-7006-1343-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy was well received in Paris, France, when she visited with her husband, and when she traveled with Lee to [[Pakistan]] and [[India]] in 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;KennedyMistique&quot; /&gt;

=== White House restoration ===
[[File:Charles Collingwood murrow27s boys.jpg|thumb|left|Jacqueline Kennedy with [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]] on the broadcast tour of the restored [[White House]] (1962).]]
[[File:BoudinBlueRoom.jpg|thumb|The [[Blue Room (White House)|Blue Room]] of the [[White House]] as redecorated by [[Stéphane Boudin]] in 1962. Boudin chose the period of the [[James Madison|Madison administration]], returning much of the original French Empire style furniture.]]

The restoration of the [[White House]] was Kennedy's first major project as First Lady. She was dismayed during her pre-inauguration tour of the White House to find little of historic significance in the house. The rooms were furnished with undistinguished pieces that she felt lacked a sense of history. Her first efforts, begun her first day in residence (with the help of society decorator [[Sister Parish]]), were to make the family quarters attractive and suitable for family life.  Among these changes was the addition of a kitchen on the family floor and rooms for her children. Upon almost immediately exhausting the funds appropriated for this effort, Kennedy established a fine arts committee to oversee and fund the restoration process and asked early American furniture expert [[Henry Francis du Pont|Henry du Pont]] to consult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cassidy|first=Tina|title=Jackie After O: One Remarkable Year When Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Defied Expectations and Rediscovered Her Dreams|year=2012|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eL_z6PD4ct0C&amp;pg=PT65&amp;dq=Henry+du+Pont+and+jackie+onassis&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=tV_jT-yDMYek8QT9nemGCA&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While her initial management of the project was hardly noted at the time, later accounts have noted that she managed the conflicting agendas of Parish, du Pont, and Boudin with seamless success;&lt;ref name=&quot;DesigningCamelot&quot; /&gt; she initiated publication of the first White House guidebook, whose sales further funded the restoration; she initiated a Congressional bill establishing that White House furnishings would be the property of the [[Smithsonian Institution]], rather than available to departing ex-presidents to claim as their own; and she wrote personal requests to those who owned pieces of historical interest that might be, and later were, donated to the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/428919/Jacqueline-Kennedy-Onassis|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On February 14, 1962, Kennedy took American television viewers on a tour of the White House with [[Charles Collingwood (journalist)|Charles Collingwood]] of [[CBS News]]. In the tour she said, &quot;I just feel that everything in the White House should be the best—the entertainment that's given here. If it's an American company you can help, I like to do that. If not—just as long as it's the best.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DesigningCamelot&quot; /&gt;  Working with [[Rachel Lambert Mellon]], she oversaw redesign and replanting of the [[White House Rose Garden]] and the East Garden, which was renamed the [[Jacqueline Kennedy Garden]] after her husband's assassination. Her efforts on behalf of restoration and preservation at the White House left a lasting legacy in the form of the [[White House Historical Association]], the [[Committee for the Preservation of the White House]] which was based upon her White House Furnishings Committee, a permanent [[Curator of the White House]], the [[White House Endowment Trust]], and the [[White House Acquisition Trust]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DesigningCamelot&quot; /&gt;

Broadcasting of the White House restoration greatly helped the Kennedy administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;DesigningCamelot&quot; /&gt; The U.S. government sought international support during the [[Cold War]], which it achieved by affecting public opinion. The First Lady's celebrity and high profile status made viewing the tour of the White House very desirable. The tour was filmed and distributed to 106 countries since there was a great demand to see the film. In 1962 at the 14th Annual [[Emmy Awards]] (NBC, May 22), [[Bob Newhart]] emceed from the [[Hollywood Palladium]]; [[Johnny Carson]] from the [[Hotel Astor (New York)|New York Astor Hotel]]; and NBC newsman [[David Brinkley]] hosted at the Sheraton Park Hotel in Washington D.C., and took the spotlight as a special [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences|Academy of Television Arts and Sciences]] Trustees Award was given to Jacqueline Kennedy for her CBS-TV tour of the White House. Lady Bird Johnson accepted for the camera-shy First Lady. The Emmy statuette is on display in the [[Kennedy Library]] located in [[Boston, Massachusetts]]. Focus and admiration for Jacqueline Kennedy took negative attention away from her husband. By attracting worldwide public attention, the First Lady gained allies for the White House and international support for the Kennedy administration and its Cold War policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1207/s15506878jobem4901_7 | author = Schwalbe, Carol B. | title=Jacqueline Kennedy and Cold War Propaganda | journal=Journal of Broadcasting and Electronic Media | volume=49 | issue=1 | year=2005 | pages=111–127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Foreign trips ===
[[File:Jacqueline Kennedy at the Taj Mahal, 15 March 1962.jpg|left|thumb|Jacqueline Kennedy at the [[Taj Mahal]], [[Agra]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[India]] on March 15, 1962.]]
Before the Kennedys visited France, a television special was shot in French with the First Lady on the White House lawn. After arriving in the country, she impressed the public with her ability to speak French fluently, as well as her extensive knowledge of French history.&lt;ref name=&quot;KennedyMistique&quot; /&gt; Kennedy had been aided in her learning of the French language by the prominent [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] educator [[María Teresa Babín Cortés]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ponce.inter.edu/cai/MariaTeresaBabin/inicio.html ''María Teresa Babín Cortés.'' InterAmerican University of Puerto Rico.]&lt;/ref&gt;  At the conclusion of the visit, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine seemed delighted with the First Lady and noted, &quot;There was also that fellow who came with her.&quot; Even President Kennedy joked, &quot;I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris&amp;nbsp;— and I have enjoyed it!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time060961&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,938093,00.html|title=Nation: La Presidente|date=June 9, 1961|work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=June 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the urging of [[John Kenneth Galbraith]], [[United States Ambassador to India|U.S. Ambassador to India]], she undertook a tour of India and [[Pakistan]], taking her sister [[Lee Radziwill]] along with her, which was amply documented in photojournalism of the time as well as in Galbraith's journals and memoirs. At the time, Ambassador Galbraith noted a considerable disjunction between Kennedy's widely-noted concern with clothes and other frivolity and, on personal acquaintance, her considerable intellect.&lt;ref name=&quot;KennedyMistique&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last2=Goodman|last=Sidey|first2=Jon|first=Hugh|coauthors=Letitia Baldrige|title=The Kennedy Mystique: Creating Camelot: Essays|publisher=[[National Geographic Books]]|year=2006|authorlink=Hugh Sidey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in [[Karachi]], Pakistan, she found some time to take a ride on a camel with her sister.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flickr.com/photos/pimu/482325327/in/set-72157594540455482/ Camel ride pic]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Lahore]], Pakistan, [[President of Pakistan|Pakistani President]] [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|Ayub Khan]] presented the First Lady with a much-photographed horse, [[Sardar]] (the [[Urdu]] term meaning &quot;leader&quot;). Subsequently this gift was widely misattributed to the king of [[Saudi Arabia]], including in the various recollections of the Kennedy White House years by President Kennedy's friend, journalist and editor [[Benjamin Bradlee]].  While at a reception in her honor at the [[Shalimar Gardens (Lahore)|Shalimar Gardens]], Kennedy told guests &quot;all my life I've dreamed of coming to the Shalimar Gardens. It's even lovelier than I'd dreamed. I only wish my husband could be with me.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,895946,00.html?promoid=googlep | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]| title=Foreign Relations: Benign Competition | date=March 30, 1962 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death of younger son ===
{{main|Patrick Bouvier Kennedy}}
Early in 1963, Kennedy became pregnant again and curtailed her official duties. She spent most of the summer at the Kennedys' rented home on Squaw Island, near the Kennedy family's [[Cape Cod]] compound at [[Hyannis Port]], where she went into preterm labor on August 7, 1963. She gave birth to a boy, [[Patrick Bouvier Kennedy]], via emergency Caesarian section at [[Otis Air Force Base]], five and a half weeks prematurely. His lungs were not fully developed, and he died at [[Boston Children's Hospital]] of hyaline membrane disease (now known as respiratory distress syndrome) on August 9, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Taraborrelli, J.

On November 21, 1963, the First Couple left the White House for a political trip to Texas, stopping in [[San Antonio]], [[Houston]], and [[Fort Worth]] that day. After a breakfast on November 22, the Kennedys flew from Fort Worth's [[Carswell Air Force Base]] to Dallas's [[Dallas Love Field|Love Field]] on [[VC-137C SAM 26000|Air Force One]], accompanied by Texas Governor [[John Connally]] and his wife [[Nellie Connally|Nellie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bugliosi&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bugliosi |first=Vincent |authorlink=Vincent Bugliosi |title=Four Days in November: The Assassination of John F.

The First Lady was seated next to her husband in the limousine, with the Governor and his wife seated in front of them. Vice President Johnson and his wife followed in another car in the motorcade.

After the motorcade turned the corner onto Elm Street in [[Dealey Plaza]], the First Lady heard what she thought to be a motorcycle [[Back-fire|backfiring]], and did not realize that it was a gunshot until she heard [[John Connally|Governor Connally]] scream.  Within 8.4 seconds, two more shots had rung out, and she leaned toward her husband.  The final shot struck the President in the head.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manchester&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author = Manchester, William |title=Death of a President|year=1967|location= [[New York City]]|publisher= [[Harper &amp; Row]] | isbn = 978-0-88365-956-4 |authorlink= William Manchester}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shocked, she climbed out of the back seat and crawled over the trunk of the car. Her Secret Service agent, [[Clint Hill]], later told the [[Warren Commission]] that he thought she had been reaching across the trunk for a piece of the President's skull that had been blown off.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manchester&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfklancer.com/CHill.html jfklancer.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Hill ran to the car and leapt onto it, directing her back to her seat.  The car rushed to Dallas's [[Parkland Hospital]], and on arrival there, the president's body was rushed into a trauma room. The First Lady, for the moment, remained in a room for relatives and friends of patients just outside.

A few minutes into her husband's treatment, accompanied by the President's doctor, Admiral George Burkley, she left her folding chair outside Trauma Room One and attempted to enter the operating room. Nurse Doris Nelson stopped her and attempted to bar the door to prevent her from entering. She persisted, and the President's doctor suggested that she take a sedative, which she refused. &quot;I want to be there when he dies,&quot; she told Burkley. He eventually persuaded Nelson to grant her access to Trauma Room One, saying &quot;It's her right, it's her prerogative.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Manchester&quot; /&gt;

Later, when the casket arrived, the widow removed her wedding ring and slipped it onto the President's finger.  She told aide [[Ken O'Donnell]], &quot;Now I have nothing left.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bugliosi&quot; /&gt;

[[File:JFK's family leaves Capitol after his funeral, 1963.jpg|thumb|left|Family members depart the [[U.S. Capitol]] after a lying-in-state ceremony for the President, November 24, 1963.]]

After the president's death, she refused to remove her blood-stained clothing, and regretted having washed the blood off her face and hands. She continued to wear the blood-stained pink suit as she went on board Air Force One and stood next to Johnson when he took the oath of office as President. She told [[Lady Bird Johnson]], &quot;I want them to see what they have done to Jack.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/ladybird/epicenter/epicenter_doc_diary.html | title= Selections from Lady Bird's Diary on the assassination: November 22, 1963 | work=Lady Bird Johnson: Portrait of a First Lady | publisher= [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]| accessdate= March 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy took an active role in planning the details of [[State funeral of John F. Kennedy|her husband's state funeral]], which was based on Abraham Lincoln's.  The funeral service was held at [[Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle]], Washington D.C., and the burial at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]; the widow led the procession there on foot and would light the eternal flame at the grave site, a flame that had been created at her request. [[Jeanne Campbell|Lady Jeanne Campbell]] reported back to ''[[The London Evening Standard]]'': &quot;Jacqueline Kennedy has given the American people... one thing they have always lacked: Majesty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Magic Majesty of Mrs. Kennedy|date=November 25, 1963|author = Campbell, Lady Jeanne|newspaper=[[The London Evening Standard]]|page=1|authorlink= Jeanne Campbell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the assassination and the media coverage which had focused intensely on her during and after the burial, Kennedy stepped back from official public view. She did, however, make a brief appearance in Washington to honor the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agent, [[Clint Hill]], who had climbed aboard the limousine in Dallas to try to shield her and the President.

In September 2011, audio tapes of Jackie Kennedy were released that had been recorded in 1964 after her husband's assassination. They were not supposed to be released until 50 years after her death in 1994. Approximately 8.5 hours in length, the tapes contain an interview with [[Arthur Schlesinger Jr]]. In it Jackie reveals her thoughts on the vice-president, [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], and civil rights leader, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]]. She discusses how she refused to leave her husband's side during the 1962 [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] when other officials had sent their wives away for their safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.npr.org/2011/09/15/140508717/jackie-o-tapes-offer-window-on-an-era-and-an-icon | title= Jackie Kennedy Tapes Offer View On An Era, And Icon | publisher=[[NPR]] | date=September 15, 2011 | accessdate= October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/therootdc/jacqueline-kennedy-book-historic-conversations-reveals-candid-first-lady/2011/09/14/gIQARTGFTK_story.html | title=Jacqueline Kennedy book, ‘Historic Conversations,’ reveals woman with strong views, political candor | publisher= [[The Washington Post]] | date=September 14, 2011 | accessdate= October 1, 2011 | first=Lori | last=Montgomery}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Life following the JFK assassination ===
[[File:Jacqueline Lee Bouvier Kennedy.gif|thumb|upright|left|Jackie Kennedy's official White House portrait by [[Aaron Shikler]].]]
A week after her husband's assassination, Kennedy was interviewed in [[Hyannis Port]], Massachusetts, on November 29 by [[Theodore H. White]] of ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine. In that session, she compared the Kennedy years in the White House to [[King Arthur]]'s mythical [[Camelot]], commenting that the President often played the title song of [[Lerner and Loewe]]'s musical recording before retiring to bed. She also quoted [[Guinevere|Queen Guinevere]] from the musical, trying to express how the loss felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Life (magazine)|Life]] |date=December 6, 1963|volume=55|issue=23 |issn=0024-3019|title=For President Kennedy, an Epilogue| author = White, Theodore H.|authorlink= Theodore H. White}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Upon leaving the [[White House]] for the last time, Kennedy asked her Secret Service drivers to arrange her trips so that she would never accidentally glimpse the old mansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historic Conversations on Life with John F. Kennedy| author = Beschloss, Michael | isbn = 978-1-4013-2425-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her steadiness and courage after her husband's assassination and funeral won her admiration around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bugliosi&quot; /&gt;  Following his death, Kennedy and her children remained in their quarters in the White House for two weeks, preparing to vacate. They spent the winter of 1964 in [[Averell Harriman]]'s home in the [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown section of Washington, D.C.]], before purchasing her own home on the same street. Later in 1964, in the hope of having more privacy for her children,&lt;ref name=&quot;Adler&quot; /&gt; Kennedy decided to buy an apartment located at 1040 Fifth Avenue in New York City and sold her new Georgetown house and the country home in Atoka, Virginia, where she and her husband had intended to retire. She spent a year in mourning,&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTObit&quot; /&gt; making few public appearances; during this time, Caroline told one of her teachers that her mother cried frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Legacy: The Story of John &amp; Caroline Kennedy| author = Heymann, Clemens David | isbn = 978-0-7434-9738-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sweet Caroline: Last Child of Camelot| author = Andersen, Christopher P. | isbn = 978-0-06-103225-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Kennedy and [[Queen Elizabeth II]] dedicated Great Britain's official memorial to President Kennedy at Runnymede, England. The memorial included several acres of meadowland given in perpetuity from Britain to the U.S., near where the Magna Carta had been signed by King John in 1215.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u-s-history.com/pages/h3915.html|title=Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis|work=www.u-s-history.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy perpetuated her husband's memory by attending selected memorial dedications. These included the 1967 christening of the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[aircraft carrier]] {{USS|John F. Kennedy|CV-67}} (decommissioned in 2007), in Newport News, Virginia, and a memorial in Hyannisport.  They also included the dedication of the United Kingdom's official memorial to President Kennedy at [[Runnymede]], [[England]], and the dedication of a park near [[New Ross]], [[Ireland]]. She oversaw plans for the establishment of the [[John F. Kennedy Library]], which is the repository for official papers of the Kennedy Administration. Original plans to have the library situated in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts, near [[Harvard University]], proved problematic for various reasons, so it is situated in Boston. The finished library, designed by [[I.M. Pei]], includes a museum and was dedicated in Boston in 1979 by President [[Jimmy Carter]].

In November 1967, during the midst of the [[Vietnam War]], ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine recognized Kennedy as &quot;America's unofficial roving ambassador&quot; during her visit to [[Cambodia]] when she met with Chief of State [[Norodom Sihanouk]]. During the visit, Kennedy joined Sihanouk on a visit to [[Angkor Wat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devata.org/2010/01/angkor-wat-dreams-jacqueline-kennedys-1967-visit-to-cambodia/ Jacqueline Kennedy Visits Angkor Wat] November 1967&lt;/ref&gt; At that point, diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cambodia had been broken since May 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2732.htm US Department of State]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Onassis marriage ==
In June 1968 when her brother-in-law [[Robert F. Kennedy]] was assassinated, she came to fear for her life and that of her children, saying &quot;If they're killing Kennedys, then my children are targets...I want to get out of this country.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jfkjr&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/07/19/us/john-f-kennedy-jr-heir-to-a-formidable-dynasty.html?pagewanted=all|title=John F.

The wedding took place on [[Skorpios]], Onassis's private island in the [[Ionian Sea]], Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spoto|first=Donald|title=Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis: A Life|year=2000|publisher=St. Martin's Paperbacks|isbn=978-0312977078|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following her marriage, Kennedy-Onassis lost her right to Secret Service protection and her [[franking#Franking privilege|franking privilege]], both of which are entitlements to a widow of U.S. president. The marriage brought her considerable adverse publicity and she became the target of [[paparazzi]] who followed her everywhere and was nicknamed &quot;Jackie O&quot; by the press.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tracy|first=Kathleen|title=Everything Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Book: A portrait of an American icon|year=2010|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Then tragedy struck again, as Aristotle Onassis's only son [[Alexander Onassis|Alexander]] died in a plane crash in January 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Spoto|first=Donald|title=Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis: A Life|year=2000|publisher=St. Martin's Paperbacks|isbn=978-0312977078|page=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Onassis's health began deteriorating rapidly and he died in Paris, on March 15, 1975. Kennedy-Onassis' financial legacy was severely limited under Greek law, which dictated how much a non-Greek surviving spouse could inherit. After two years of legal battle, she eventually accepted from [[Christina Onassis]], Onassis's daughter and sole heir, a settlement of $26 million, waiving all other claims to the Onassis estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tracy|first=Kathleen|title=Everything Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Book: A portrait of an American icon|year=2010|page=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During their 7 year marriage the couple resided in 5 different residences: her New York City 15 room Fifth Ave. apartment, her horse farm in New Jersey, his Avenue Foch apartment in Paris, his private island in Greece named Skorpios, or his 325&amp;nbsp;ft yacht &quot;The Christina.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cheslow, Jerry (August 7, 1994).

== Later years ==
Onassis's death in 1975 made Kennedy-Onassis, then nearly 46, a widow for the second time. Now that her children were older, she decided to find work that would be fulfilling to her. Since she had always enjoyed writing and literature, in 1975 she accepted a job offer as an editor at [[Viking Press]].  But, in 1978, the President of Viking Press, [[Thomas H. Guinzburg]], authorized the purchase of the Jeffrey Archer novel ''[[Shall We Tell the President?]]'', which was set in a fictional future presidency of [[Edward M.

Although Guinzburg cleared the book purchase and publication with Onassis, upon the publication of a negative ''New York Times'' review which asserted that Onassis held some responsibility for its publication, she abruptly resigned from Viking Press the next day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Time of Their Lives| author = Silverman, Al |pages=171–172|publisher= [[St. Martin's Press]] |year=2008|location=New York | isbn = 978-0-312-35003-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She then moved to [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] as an associate editor under an old friend, [[John Turner Sargent, Sr.|John Sargent]], living in New York City, [[Martha's Vineyard]] and the [[Kennedy Compound]] in [[Hyannis, Massachusetts]]. From the mid 1970s until her death, her companion was [[Maurice Tempelsman]], a Belgian-born industrialist and [[diamond]] merchant who was long separated from his wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/jbk.htm Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis] at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

She also continued to be the subject of much press attention, most notoriously involving the photographer [[Ron Galella]]. He followed her around and photographed her as she went about her day-to-day activities, obtaining candid photos of her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A32885&amp;page_number=3&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1 MoMa collection photo]&lt;/ref&gt; She ultimately obtained a restraining order against him and the situation brought attention to [[paparazzi]]-style photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/01/02/nyregion/02folo.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;pagewanted=print&amp;position=|work= [[The New York Times]]|title=Ambush Photographer Leaves the Bushes|date=January 2, 2005| author = Fried, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, John F. Kennedy Jr. allowed Galella to photograph him at public events.

Among the many books Kennedy-Onassis edited was [[Larry Gonick]]'s ''[[The Cartoon History of the Universe]]''. He expressed his gratitude in the acknowledgments in Volume 2.

Kennedy-Onassis also appreciated the contributions of African-American writers to the American literary canon. She encouraged [[Dorothy West]], her neighbor on [[Martha's Vineyard]] and the last surviving member of the [[Harlem Renaissance]], to complete the novel ''The Wedding'' (1995), a multi-generational story about race, class, wealth, and power in the U.S.; West acknowledged Onassis's encouragement in the foreword.  The novel, which received literary acclaim when it was published by Doubleday,&lt;ref&gt;Database (undated).  [http://www.worldcat.org/title/wedding/oclc/30739147&amp;referer=brief_results &quot;''The Wedding''&quot;].  [[WorldCat]].  Retrieved May 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; was later adapted into a television [[miniseries]] [[The Wedding (TV miniseries)|of the same name]] (1998) starring [[Halle Berry]].&lt;ref&gt;Database (undated).

She also worked to preserve and protect America's cultural heritage. The notable results of her hard work include [[President's Park|Lafayette Square]] in Washington, D.C, and [[Grand Central Terminal]], New York City's historic railroad station.&lt;ref name=&quot;DesigningCamelot&quot; /&gt; While she was First Lady, she helped to stop the destruction of historic homes in Lafayette Square, because she felt that these buildings were an important part of the nation's capital and played an essential role in its history.&lt;ref name=&quot;DesigningCamelot&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author = Abbott, James; Rice, Elaine |title=Designing Camelot: The Kennedy White House Restoration|publisher= [[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |year=1997 | isbn = 978-0-442-02532-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in New York City, she led a historic preservation campaign to save from demolition and renovate Grand Central Terminal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adler&quot; /&gt; A plaque inside the terminal acknowledges her prominent role in its preservation. In the 1980s, she was a major figure in protests against a planned skyscraper at [[Columbus Circle]] which would have cast large shadows on [[Central Park]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Adler&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Eloquent Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis&amp;nbsp;– A Portrait in Her Own Words|volume=1| author = Adler, Bill | isbn = 978-0-06-073282-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the project was cancelled, but a large twin-towered skyscraper would later fill in that spot in 2003, the [[Time Warner Center]].

From her apartment windows in New York City she had a splendid view of a glass enclosed wing of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] which displays the [[Temple of Dendur]]. This was a gift from [[Egypt]] to the U.S. in gratitude for the generosity of the [[Kennedy administration]], who had been instrumental in saving several temples and objects of Egyptian antiquity that would otherwise have been flooded after the construction of the [[Aswan Dam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;queen&quot; /&gt;

[[File:OnassisGrave.jpg|thumb|Grave of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis at [[Arlington National Cemetery]] (2006)]]
In January 1994, Onassis was diagnosed with [[non-Hodgkin's lymphoma]], a form of [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Altman

By April, the cancer had spread, and she made her last trip home from [[New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center]] on May 18, 1994. A large crowd of well-wishers, tourists, and reporters gathered on the street outside her apartment.  Onassis died in her sleep at 10:15&amp;nbsp;pm on Thursday, May 19, two and a half months before her 65th birthday. In announcing her death, Kennedy-Onassis' son, [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.]], stated, &quot;My mother died surrounded by her friends and her family and her books, and the people and the things that she loved. She did it in her own way, and on her own terms, and we all feel lucky for that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nicholas A.

Onassis' funeral was held on May 23 at [[Church of St. Ignatius Loyola (New York City)|Saint Ignatius Loyola Church]] in Manhattan&amp;nbsp;— the church where she was baptized in 1929, and confirmed as a teenager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/24/us/death-of-a-first-lady-the-overview-jacqueline-kennedy-onassis-is-buried.html?pagewanted=print|page=A1|title = Death of a First Lady:  The Overview; Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis Is Buried|date=May 24, 1994| author = Apple, Jr., R.W.| work = [[The New York Times]]|authorlink= R.

During her husband's presidency, Jacqueline Kennedy became a symbol of fashion for women all over the world. She retained French-born American fashion designer and Kennedy family friend [[Oleg Cassini]] in the fall of 1960 to create an original wardrobe for her as First Lady. From 1961 to late 1963, Cassini dressed her in many of her most iconic ensembles, including her Inauguration Day fawn coat and Inaugural gala gown as well as many outfits for her visits to Europe, India and Pakistan. In her first year in the White House, Kennedy spent $45,446 more on fashion than the $100,000 annual salary her husband earned as president. Her clean [[suit (clothing)|suit]]s with a skirt hem down to middle of the knee, three-quarter sleeves on notch-collar jackets, sleeveless [[A-line]] dresses, above-the-elbow gloves, low-heel pumps, and famous [[pillbox hat]]s were an overnight success around the world that quickly became known as the &quot;Jackie&quot; look.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Return of the Jackie Look&amp;nbsp;– Sort of Fashion from A-Line Dresses to Fitted Jackets |work = [[Newsweek]] |url=http://www.newsweek.com/1994/08/28/return-of-the-jackie-look-sort-of-fashion-from-a-line-dresses-to-fitted-jackets.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Cassini was her primary designer, she also wore ensembles by French fashion legends such as [[Chanel]], [[Givenchy]], and [[Dior]].  More than any other First Lady her style was copied by commercial manufacturers and a large segment of young women.&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstLadies&quot; /&gt;

In the years after the White House, her style changed dramatically. Gone were the modest &quot;campaign wife&quot; clothes. Wide-leg pantsuits, large lapel jackets, gypsy skirts, silk [[Hermès]] head scarves and large, round, dark sunglasses were her new look. She often chose to wear brighter colors and patterns and even began wearing jeans in public.&lt;ref name=&quot;LIFE&quot;&gt;{{cite news  |title = Jackie Kennedy: Post-Camelot Style | work = [[Life (magazine)|Life]] |url = http://www.life.com/image/first/in-gallery/31382/jackie-kennedy-postcamelot-style |accessdate = October 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beltless, white [[jeans]] with a black [[turtleneck]], never tucked in, but pulled down over the hips, also was a fashion trend that she set.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jackie Kennedy Style|publisher=Famous Women and Beauty|url=http://www.famous-women-and-beauty.com/jackie-kennedy-style.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout her lifetime, Kennedy acquired a large collection of exquisite and priceless [[jewelry]]. Her triple-strand [[Pearl#Pearls in jewelry|pearl necklace]] designed by American jeweler [[Kenneth Jay Lane]] became her signature piece of jewelry during her time as First Lady in the White House. Often referred to as the &quot;berry brooch,&quot; the two fruit cluster brooch of strawberries made of rubies with stems and leaves of diamonds, designed by French jeweler [[Jean Schlumberger (jewelry designer)|Jean Schlumberger]] for [[Tiffany &amp; Co.]], was personally selected and given to her by her husband several days prior to his inauguration in January 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treasures of the Kennedy Library|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/NR/rdonlyres/5CE1EDAD-4E84-4DE6-AE2A-E01C47655B32/22759/TreasuresExhibit.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schlumberger's gold and enamel bracelets were worn by Kennedy so frequently in the early and mid-1960s that the press called them &quot;Jackie bracelets&quot;. His white enamel and gold &quot;banana&quot; earrings were also favored by her. Kennedy wore jewelry designed by [[Van Cleef &amp; Arpels]] throughout the 1950s,&lt;ref name=&quot;jackiesjewelry.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Jacqueline Kennedy Collection by Camrose &amp; Kross|url=http://jackiesjewelry.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1960s&lt;ref name=&quot;jackiesjewelry.com&quot; /&gt; and 1970s. Her sentimental favorite was the wedding ring given to her by President Kennedy, also from Van Cleef &amp; Arpels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jacqueline Kennedy Jewelry|publisher=Famous Women and Beauty|url=http://www.famous-women-and-beauty.com/jacqueline-kennedy-jewelry.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
