'''Alan Stuart &quot;Al&quot; Franken''' (born May 21, 1951) is the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|junior]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Minnesota]]. He first achieved fame as a writer and performer for the television show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' from its conception in 1975 before moving to writing and acting in films and television. He then became a [[political commentator]], author of five books, and hosted his nationally syndicated radio talk show ''[[The Al Franken Show]]'' on the [[Air America Radio]] network.

He is a member of the [[Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party]], which affiliates with the national [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], and in 2008, he narrowly defeated incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Norm Coleman]] by 312 votes. After the results of a statewide manual recount and subsequent lawsuit by Coleman,&lt;ref name=mn_sc_appeal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.twincities.com/ci_12187779 |title=Coleman asks high court to look again at rejected votes|author=Jason Hoppin|publisher=St. Paul Pioneer Press| date=April 20, 2009|accessdate=April 22, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090509084306/http://www.twincities.com/ci_12187779?| archivedate= May 9, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Minnesota Supreme Court]] unanimously upheld Franken's victory on June 30, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://us.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/06/30/franken.ruling/index.html|title=Coleman concedes Minnesota Senate race after court decision|agency=CNN|date=June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he was sworn into the Senate on July 7, 2009.&lt;ref name = &quot;NYT-Huls-2009-07-07&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;AP-Time-Bakst-2009-07-07&quot;/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Franken was born in [[New York City]] to his mother, Phoebe G. (née Kunst), a homemaker and [[real estate]] agent, and his father, Joseph P. Franken, a printing salesman. The family first moved to [[Albert Lea, Minnesota]] in 1955, when he was four, then to [[St. Louis Park, Minnesota]], a [[suburb]] near [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slphistory.org/history/frankenal.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/91/Al-Franken.html |title=Al Franken Biography (1951?-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franken had a Jewish upbringing.&lt;ref name=&quot;waldman&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/News/Politics/2003/09/Why-Would-The-Anti-Christ-Write-Chorus-Line.aspx?p=3 |title=Beliefnet's interview with Al Franken, author of Lies &amp; the Lying Liars about Bush, Hannity, O'Reilly and other conservatives |publisher=Beliefnet.com |date= |accessdate=July 9, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090716173203/http://www.beliefnet.com/News/Politics/2003/09/Why-Would-The-Anti-Christ-Write-Chorus-Line.aspx?p=3| archivedate= July 16, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandparents were immigrants from [[Germany]], and his mother's family was from [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wargs.com/other/franken.html&lt;/ref&gt; His older brother Owen is a [[photojournalist]], and [[MSNBC]]'s [[Bob Franken]] is his cousin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last= |first= |title=CNN Newsnight Aaron Brown |url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0204/29/asb.00.html |publisher=CNN |date=April 29, 2002 |accessdate=November 5, 2008 |postscript= &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franken graduated in 1969 from [[The Blake School (Minneapolis, Minnesota)|The Blake School]], while there was on the wrestling team. He attended [[Harvard College]] and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] ''[[cum laude]]'' in 1973 in [[political science]].&lt;ref name=about.com&gt;{{cite web|url= http://usliberals.about.com/od/senatecandidatesin2008/p/AlFranken.htm|accessdate=January 30, 2009|publisher=About.com| title=Profile of Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota|author=Deborah White}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Saturday Night Live''==
Franken began his performing career in high school at The Blake School, where he and his long-time writing partner [[Tom Davis (comedian)|Tom Davis]] were known for their humor. Franken honed his writing and performing skills at Minneapolis' [[Dudley Riggs]]' [[Brave New Workshop]] theater, specializing in [[political satire]]. He and Davis soon found themselves in &quot;a life of near-total failure on the fringes of show business in Los Angeles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hill, Doug and Weingrad, Jeff, ''Saturday Night: A Backstage History of Saturday Night Live'' (Vintage Books, 1987) ISBN 0-394-75053-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franken and Davis were recruited as two of the original writers (and occasional performers) on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' (''SNL'') (1975–1980, 1985–1995). In the latter period, only Franken returned as a performer. In Season 1 of ''SNL,'' as apprentice writers, the two shared a salary of $350 per week. Franken, who received seven [[Emmy Award|Emmy nominations]] and three Awards for his television writing and producing, created such characters as [[self-help]] guru [[Stuart Smalley]] and such routines as proclaiming the 1980s to be the &quot;Al Franken Decade&quot;. Franken was associated with ''SNL'' for over 15 years and, in 2002, interviewed former [[Vice President]] [[Al Gore]] while in character as Smalley. Franken and Davis wrote the script to the 1986 comedy film ''[[One More Saturday Night (film)|One More Saturday Night]],'' appearing in it as rock singers in a band called &quot;Bad Mouth&quot;. They also appeared in minor roles in ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'' and in the [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Dan Aykroyd]] film ''[[Trading Places]]''.

Franken's most notorious ''SNL'' performance may have been &quot;A Limo for the Lame-O&quot;, a commentary he delivered near the end of the 1979–80 season during a [[Weekend Update]] segment. Franken mocked controversial [[NBC]] president [[Fred Silverman]] as &quot;a total unequivocal failure&quot; and displayed a chart showing the poor ratings of NBC programs. Franken proclaimed that Silverman did not deserve a limousine. As a result of this sketch, Silverman refused [[Lorne Michaels]]' request that Franken succeed him as ''SNL'''s head producer, prompting Franken to leave the show when Michaels did, at the end of the 1979–80 season.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tom Shales|Shales, Tom]] (2003). ''Live From New York'', p. 191. Back Bay Books.&lt;/ref&gt; Franken later returned to the show in 1985, mostly as a writer, but also as an occasional performer, best known for the Stuart Smalley character. He acknowledged using [[cocaine]] while working for ''Saturday Night Live'' but says he no longer uses illegal drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last =Cox| first =Ana Marie| title =Don't Laugh at Al Franken| publisher=CNN/Time| date =April 5, 2007| url =http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1607252,00.html| accessdate =August 19, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070919191241/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1607252,00.html| archivedate= September 19, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franken left the show in 1995 in protest over losing the role of Weekend Update anchor to [[Norm Macdonald]].&lt;ref&gt;Shales, pp. 433–444.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-''SNL''==
Franken is the author of five ''[[New York Times]]'' best-selling books, three of which reached #1, including ''[[Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations]]''.

===USO service===
[[File:Al Franken at Rammstein Air Force Base, Dec 2000.JPEG|thumb|right|Franken entertaining at [[Ramstein Air Base]] in December 2000]]
Franken has served as a volunteer with the [[United Service Organizations]] since he first visited [[Kosovo]] in 1999. Franken has conducted several overseas tours to both [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]], in addition to participating in numerous celebrity handshake tours at military hospitals to visit wounded soldiers.  He has done seven USO tours in total, four of which were to Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Al Franken website, &quot;Meet Al&quot;|url=http://www.alfranken.com/pages/meet_al/}}&lt;/ref&gt; His readiness to perform on USO tours was noted favorably by fellow USO performer, Wayne Newton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=kasindorf|first=Martin, and Steven Komarow|title=USO cheers troops, but Iraq gigs tough to book|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2005-12-22-uso-cover_x.htm|newspaper=USA TODAY|date=December 22, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 25, 2009, Franken was presented with the USO's Merit Award for his 10 years of service to the organization through visiting injured and deployed service members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first= |last= |coauthors= |title=USO of Metropolitan Washington Salutes &quot;Our Nation’s Heroes&quot; at the USO-Metro Annual Awards Dinner|curly=y |url=http://www.usometrodc.org/page.php?p=42&amp;n=42 |work=USO-Metro website|publisher=USO-Metro|date=March 26, 2009 |accessdate=March 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fox News lawsuit===
{{Main|Fox v. Franken}}
In 2003, [[Penguin Books]] published Franken's book ''[[Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right]]'', which included a cover photo of [[Fox News]] commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and a chapter accusing O'Reilly of lying. In August of that year, [[Fox v. Franken|Fox News sued]], claiming [[Trademark infringement|infringement]] of its registered [[trademark]] phrase &quot;Fair and Balanced&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | year =2005 | title =Video: &quot;Never get into a pissing contest with a skunk&quot; (2005) | url =http://www.archive.org/details/openmind_ep1641 | publisher =[[The Open Mind (TV series)]] | accessdate =February 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A federal judge found the [[lawsuit]] to be &quot;wholly without merit&quot;. The incident with Fox focused media attention on Franken's book and, according to Franken, greatly increased its sales through the [[Streisand effect]].&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{Cite news| last = Saulny | first = Susan | authorlink = | date = August 23, 2003 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/23/nyregion/23FRAN.html | title = In Courtroom, Laughter at Fox and a Victory for Al Franken | work=The New York Times | publisher=The New York Times Company | accessdate =October 5, 2005 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050922092705/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/23/nyregion/23FRAN.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 22, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = | first =  | authorlink = | date = September 3, 2003 | url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1419191 | title =Comedian and Political Commentator Al Franken | work=[[National Public Radio]] | publisher=| accessdate =October 5, 2005| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20050911192611/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1419191| archivedate= September 11, 2005 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio show===
{{Main|The Al Franken Show}}
Franken signed a one-year contract in early 2004 to host a talk show for [[Air America Radio]]'s flagship program with co-host [[Katherine Lanpher]], who remained with the show until October 2005. The network was launched March 31, 2004. Originally named ''The O'Franken Factor'' but renamed ''[[The Al Franken Show]]'' on July 12, 2004, the show aired three hours a day, five days a week for three years. The stated goal of the show was to provide the public airwaves with more progressive views to counter what Franken perceived to be the dominance of conservative syndicated commentary on the radio: &quot;I'm doing this because I want to use my energies to get [[George W. Bush|Bush]] unelected,&quot; he told a ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Shorto |first=Russell |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C03E6DA1731F932A15750C0A9629C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=8 |title=Al Franken, Seriously So&amp;nbsp;— |work=New York Times |date=March 21, 2004 |accessdate=July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franken's last radio show on Air America Radio was on February 14, 2007, at the end of which Franken announced his candidacy for the [[United States Senate]].

===Other projects===
Franken wrote the original screenplay and starred in the film ''[[Stuart Saves His Family]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/opa/newsr/05-11-08-01.all.html|title=The Al Franken Show from Woolsey Hall|date=November 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was panned by critics, receiving a rating of 29% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. He also co-wrote the film ''[[When a Man Loves a Woman (film)|When a Man Loves a Woman]]''. He co-created and starred in the NBC sitcom ''[[LateLine]]'' until it was canceled in Season 2, and appeared in the [[The Manchurian Candidate (2004 film)|2004 remake]] of ''[[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|The Manchurian Candidate]]''.

In 2003, Franken served as a Fellow with Harvard's [[Kennedy School of Government]] at the [[Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://harvardmagazine.com/2012/03/you-can-call-me-senator|title=Al Franken: You Can Call Me Senator|publisher=''[[Harvard Magazine]]'' |first=Jesse|last=Kornbluth|date= March-April 2012|accessdate=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2005, Franken has been a contributing blogger at ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/al-franken/|title=''[[The Huffington Post]]''; Al Franken|accessdate=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franken has long been associated with the [[Independent Order of Odd Fellows]] (Manchester Unity),&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., http://www.sidereel.com/Al_Franken, http://www.wildriverreview.com/young/?p=26 or http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/diachronic/2009/07/an-odd-omission-concerning-an.php?ref=reccafe&lt;/ref&gt; but in September 2009, his spokesperson said he is not a member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minnesotaindependent.com/43963/al-franken-is-not-an-odd-fellow-no-matter-what-wikipedia-says|title=Al Franken is no Odd Fellow|publisher=Minnesota Independent|accessdate=February 15, 2010|date=September 8, 2009|author=Chris Steller| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100217083843/http://minnesotaindependent.com/43963/al-franken-is-not-an-odd-fellow-no-matter-what-wikipedia-says| archivedate= February 17, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activism prior to election==
[[File:AlFranken2009.JPG|thumb|Franken giving a political speech]]
According to an article by [[Richard Corliss]] published in ''[[Time magazine|Time]]'', &quot;In a way, Franken has been running for office since the late '70s.&quot; Corliss also hinted at Franken's &quot;possibly ironic role as a relentless self-promoter&quot; in proclaiming the 1980s &quot;the Al Franken Decade&quot; and saying, &quot;Vote for me, Al Franken. You'll be glad you did!&quot;&lt;ref name=Corliss&gt;{{Cite news|last=Corliss |first=Richard |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1590138,00.html |title=Vote for Me, Al Franken |work=TIME |date=February 14, 2007 |accessdate=July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Franken released a parody book, ''[[Why Not Me? (novel)|Why Not Me?]],'' detailing his campaign for the Presidency in 2000. He had been a strong supporter of Minnesota [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Paul Wellstone]] and was deeply affected by the Senator's death in a plane crash shortly before the [[United States Senate elections, 2002|2002 Senate election]]. After the funeral, [[Rush Limbaugh]] and several other commentators identified by Franken as &quot;rightwing bloggers&quot; and &quot;Republicans&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;huffingtonpost2006&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/al-franken/reflections-on-the-wellst_b_15459.html |title=Al Franken: Reflections on the Wellstone Memorial and the King Funeral |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date=February 11, 2006 |accessdate=July 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; accused the organizers and participants of Wellstone's remembrance ceremony of using the tragedy for political purposes. Conservative columnists [[Peggy Noonan]] and [[Chris Caldwell]] asserted that 20,000 people [[Booing|booed]] [[Trent Lott]]. Franken, who attended, denied there was widespread jeering: &quot;Along with everyone else, I cried, I laughed, I cheered. It was, to my mind, a beautiful four-hour memorial. I didn't boo. Neither did 22,800 of the some 23,000 people there.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;huffingtonpost2006&quot;/&gt; In ''Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them'', Franken wrote that Noonan and Caldwell had later told him that they had not personally been at the memorial service.&lt;ref&gt;''Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them'', pp. 202–209.&lt;/ref&gt;  Franken felt that &quot;the right wing line on the Wellstone Memorial&quot; was accepted by some &quot;mainstream&quot; journalists such as [[Howard Kurtz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;huffingtonpost2006&quot;/&gt;

Franken said he learned that 21% of Americans received most of their news from [[talk radio]], an almost exclusively conservative medium.&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt; Said Franken, &quot;I didn't want to sit on the sidelines, and I believed Air America could make a difference.&quot;&lt;ref name=Corliss/&gt; In November 2003, Franken talked about moving to his home state of Minnesota to run for the Senate. The seat once held by Wellstone, then occupied by Republican [[Norm Coleman]], was to be contested in the 2008 election. In 2005, Franken announced his move to Minnesota: &quot;I can tell you honestly, I don't know if I'm going to run, but I'm doing the stuff I need to do in order to do it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Kuhn | first = David Paul | title = Senator Franken? | url = http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2005/04/28/franken/ | date = April 28, 2005 | accessdate =February 15, 2007 | publisher=[[Salon.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2005, Franken started his own [[political action committee]], called [[Midwest Values PAC]]. By early 2007, the PAC raised more than $1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/thefix/2007/02/al_franken_minnesota.html?nav=rss_blog| author=Cilizza, Chris |work=Washington Post |date=February 5, 2007| accessdate=August 8, 2007| title=Minnesota Senate: Is Franken the Dems' Dream Candidate?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.motherjones.com/news/outfront/2007/09/doggone-it-people-like-him.html| publisher=Mother Jones| date=September 1, 2007| accessdate=September 1, 2007| title=Doggone It, People Like Him| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071012161000/http://motherjones.com/news/outfront/2007/09/doggone-it-people-like-him.html| archivedate= October 12, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Franken was the subject of the 2006 documentary film ''[[Al Franken: God Spoke]]'', which premiered in April 2006 at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] in New York City. It was released nationally on September 13 that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0799916|title=Al Franken: God Spoke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views===
Franken had initially supported the [[Iraq War]] but opposed the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|2007 troop surge]]. In an interview with [[MSNBC]]’s [[Joe Scarborough]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10381687/|title=Transcript, &quot;Scarborough Country&quot;|publisher=MSNBC|date=December 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franken said that he &quot;believed [[Colin Powell]]&quot;, whose presentation at the [[United Nations]] convinced him that the war was necessary. However, since then he had come to believe that &quot;we were misled into the war&quot; and urged the Democratically-controlled Congress to refuse to pass appropriations bills to fund the war if they don't include timetables for leaving Iraq. In an interview with [[Josh Marshall]], Franken said of the Democrats, &quot;I think we've gotta make [President [[George W.

Preliminary reports on election night November 4 had Coleman ahead by over 700 votes; but the official results certified on by November 18, 2008, had Coleman leading by only 215 votes. As the two candidates were separated by less than 0.5 percent, the [[Secretary of State of Minnesota]] [[Mark Ritchie]], authorized an automatic recount stipulated in Minnesota election law. In the recount, ballots and certifying materials were examined by hand, and candidates could file challenges to the legality of ballots or materials for inclusion or exclusion with regard to the recount. On January 5, 2009, the [[Elections in Minnesota#Minnesota State Canvassing Board|Minnesota State Canvassing Board]] certified the recounted vote totals, with Franken ahead by 225 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Friedlander |first=Beau |url=http://airamerica.com/blog/2009/jan/05/al-franken-certified-winner |title=Al Franken Certified Winner &amp;#124; Air America Media |publisher=Airamerica.com |date= |accessdate=July 9, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Franken proposed a financial reform legislation amendment which would create a board to select which [[credit rating agency]] would evaluate a given security; currently any companies issuing a security may select which company evaluates the security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Corkery |first=Michael |title=Al Franken’s Credit Rating Amendment is No Joke |work=Wall Street Journal |date=May 13, 2010  |url = http://blogs.wsj.com/deals/2010/05/13/al-frankens-credit-rating-amendment-is-no-joke/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment was passed; however, the financial industry lobbied to have Franken's amendment removed from the final bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Larnder |first=James |title=Reckoning day for the raters |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=June 14, 2010 |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-a-budget/102995-reckoning-day-for-the-raters}}&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations between the Senate and [[US House of Representatives|House]], whose version of financial reform did not include such a provision,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Crittenden |first=Michael |title=US Sen Franken Confident Credit Rating Measure Has Support |work=Wall Street Journal |date = June 2, 2010 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20100602-710930.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; resulted in the amendment's being watered down to require only a series of studies being done upon the issue for two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Davidoff |first=Steven |title= Finding a Good Financial Bill in 2,300 Pages|work=New York Times |date = July 16, 2010 |url= http://dealbook.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/15/finding-a-good-financial-bill-in-2300-pages/?src=mv}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the studies, if the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] has not implemented another solution to the conflict of interest problem, Franken's solution will go into effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newsweekinteractive.com/2010/07/05/al-franken-gets-serious.html|title=Al Franken Gets Serious |author=Michael Hirsh |date=July 5, 2010 |accessdate=July 20, 2010 |publisher=Newsweek| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100709192649/http://www.newsweekinteractive.com/2010/07/05/al-franken-gets-serious.html?| archivedate= July 9, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE66E45J20100715|title= Factbox: Long to-do list ahead for financial regulators|publisher=Reuters|author=Rachelle Younglai, Roberta Rampton, Kim Dixon and Mark Felsenthal |date=July 15, 2010 |accessdate=July 20, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100719211849/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE66E45J20100715| archivedate= July 19, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
