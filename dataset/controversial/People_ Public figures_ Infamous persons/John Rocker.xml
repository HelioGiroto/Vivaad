'''John Loy Rocker''' (born October 17, 1974) is a retired [[United States|American]] [[Major League Baseball]] [[relief pitcher]] who played for the [[Atlanta Braves]], the [[Cleveland Indians]], the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], and the [[Tampa Bay Rays|Tampa Bay Devil Rays]] as well as the [[Long Island Ducks]] of the independent [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball]]. He threw left-handed and batted right-handed.

Rocker is a native of [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and lives in [[Atlanta]].

==Baseball career==
John Rocker was a star pitcher for [[First Presbyterian Day School]] in [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AT&amp;p_theme=at&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EADA4B8C9804B13&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM &quot;Call this school Rockerville: BATTLE OF THE DECADE: BRAVES VS. YANKEES ], ''[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'', October 26, 1999. Accessed November 8, 2007. &quot;In Jim Turner's worn leather wallet is a ticket stub from John Rocker's first game in a Braves uniform, from spring training on March 1, 1998. &quot;I carry it around just to remind me that dreams can happen,&quot; says Turner, Rocker's old high school baseball coach at First Presbyterian Day School.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Rocker threw three [[no-hitter]]s during his high school career. He was soon drafted by the Atlanta Braves.

The next year, he was promoted to the major league club and named their [[closer (baseball)|closer]] after an injury to regular closer [[Kerry Ligtenberg]].In Rocker's first season in the Major Leagues, he was 1–3 with a 2.13 ERA in 38 innings pitched. The following year, an injury put Atlanta closer [[Kerry Ligtenberg]] on the [[disabled list|DL]], moving Rocker into the role, where he was 4–5 with 38 saves and a 2.49 ERA. In 2000, he was 1–2 with 24 saves, posting a 2.89 ERA, but in June 2000, Rocker was demoted for threatening a reporter.&lt;ref name=BB&gt;{{cite book|last=Horvitz|first=Joachim|title=The Big Book of Jewish Baseball, p. 277|publisher=SP Books|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9ZzxydPInwgC&amp;pg=PA277&amp;lpg=PA277&amp;dq=%22jason+marquis%22+%22danville%22|year=2001|accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Atlanta Braves|Braves]] fans were initially willing to support him; however, as Rocker received intense taunting from opposing teams' fans his pitching performance declined. On June 23, 2001, Rocker was traded to the [[Cleveland Indians]], with whom he played in the 2001 ALDS against the [[Seattle Mariners]]. Rocker was traded for right-handed relievers [[Steve Karsay]] and [[Steve Reed (baseball)|Steve Reed]] and cash in exchange for Rocker and minor-league infielder Troy Cameron, Atlanta's first-round draft pick in 1997. In Cleveland, his record was 3–7 with a 5.45 ERA and four saves. The Indians chose not to retain him, and traded him to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] for pitcher [[David Elder]]. In Texas he refused designation to the minor leagues.  In 2002, he again struggled at 2–3 with a 6.66 ERA, and was released. In 2003, Rocker signed with Tampa Bay but was released after two appearances, with an ERA of 9.00.

He took the {{by|2004}} season off to recover from surgery on his left shoulder. In {{by|2005}}, he signed with the [[Long Island Ducks]] of the independent [[Atlantic League of Professional Baseball|Atlantic League]] after training with the [[Chattahoochee High School]] Cougars in [[Alpharetta, Georgia]]. The Cougars later went on to win the 5A State Championship. In April 2005, he asked New Yorkers to &quot;bury the hatchet.&quot;  After going 0–2 with a 6.50 ERA in 23 games, he was released on June 27, 2005.

==Controversy==
===Controversial statements===
For a story published in the December 27, 1999 issue of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', Rocker made a number of allegations stemming from his experiences in [[New York City]] and answering a question about whether he would ever play for the [[New York Yankees]] or the [[New York Mets]].  Rocker's response was considered [[Racism|racist]], [[Homophobia|homophobic]], and [[Sexism|sexist]]:

{{cquote|I'd retire first.  It's the most hectic, nerve-racking city. Imagine having to take the [[7 (New York City Subway service)|7 Train]] to the ballpark looking like you're riding through [[Beirut]] next to some kid with purple hair, next to some [[Homosexuality|queer]] with [[AIDS]], right next to some dude who just got out of jail for the fourth time, right next to some 20-year-old mom with four kids. It's depressing... The biggest thing I don't like about [[New York City|New York]] are the foreigners. You can walk an entire block in [[Times Square]] and not hear anybody speaking [[English language|English]]. [[Asian people|Asians]] and [[Korea]]ns and [[Vietnam]]ese and [[India]]ns and [[Russia]]ns and [[Spain|Spanish]] people and everything up there. How the hell did they get in this country? &lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/features/cover/news/1999/12/22/rocker/ Rocker spews hate in this week&amp;#039;s SI - Thursday  December  23, 1999 ]&lt;/ref&gt;}}  
During the interview, he also spoke of his opinion of the [[New York Mets]] and their fans:

{{cquote|Nowhere else in the country do people spit at you, throw bottles at you, throw quarters at you, throw batteries at you and say, 'Hey, I did your mother last night &amp;mdash; she's a whore.' I talked about what degenerates they were and they proved me right.}}

The interview was conducted while driving to a speaking engagement in [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]].  The reporter wrote that during the interview session, Rocker spat on a [[Georgia State Route 400|Georgia 400]] toll machine and mocked Asian women. Also, he supposedly referred to [[African American|black]] teammate [[Randall Simon]] as a &quot;fat [[Ethnic slur |monkey]]&quot;{{fact|date=April 2012}}.

Although Rocker later apologized after speaking with Braves legend and [[National Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]]r [[Hank Aaron]] and former [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]] mayor and [[United States House of Representatives|congressman]] [[Andrew Young]], he continued to make controversial remarks.&lt;ref&gt;ESPN.com: [http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/news/2000/0627/607141.html &quot;Rocker rankles fans, retires Mets.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; For his comments, he was suspended without pay for the remainder of spring training and the first 28 games of the 2000 season, which on appeal was reduced to 14 games (without a spring-training suspension).

During the debacle, on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', [[Jay Leno]] had guests take baseball bats and whack a John Rocker dummy. ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' also lampooned the affair.

In 2002, while with the Rangers, Rocker again made national headlines for his views after directing slurs towards patrons of a Dallas restaurant at which he was dining, located in the heavily [[LGBT]]-populated neighborhood of [[Oak Lawn, Dallas|Oak Lawn]] in [[Uptown Dallas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2002/aug/06/sports/sp-bbnotes6 LA Times: &quot;Rocker Sorry for Remarks&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/08/06/national/main517634.shtml CBS News: &quot;Rocker Rocks The Boat Again&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, Rocker defended the [[freedom of speech|right of free speech]] of former teammate [[Ozzie Guillen]], at the time the manager of the ''[[Chicago White Sox]]'', for referring to ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' sports columnist [[Jay Mariotti]] as a &quot;fag&quot;. Guillen, a native of [[Venezuela]], claimed it was not a derogatory term and that, in Venezuela, the term only questions another man's courage rather than his sexual orientation.

&quot;This is a free country. If he wants to use a [[lewd]] term, he should be able to use a lewd term&quot;, Rocker told the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. &quot;Can't you use a lewd term in America if you want&quot;?&lt;ref&gt;ESPN.com: [http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2499926 &quot;Report: Rocker calls sensitivity training a 'farce'&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to [[sensitivity training]], he was quoted as saying: &quot;It was a farce, a way for the scared little man, [[Bud Selig]], to get people off his ass&quot;. He claimed that when he attended mandatory sensitivity training he would seldom remain longer than 15 minutes. He also claimed he never paid the $500 fine that was levied against him.

In late 2006, Rocker was interviewed by the popular sports blog, [[Deadspin]] along with girlfriend Alicia Marie. In the interview, Rocker discussed his &quot;Speak English&quot; campaign, as well as his upcoming book (which was eventually published in 2011.) Rocker stated that the book will not be used to try to repair his reputation, but will rather be &quot;more [[conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] rantings.&quot; Also during the interview, Rocker lambasted [[John Schuerholz]], his former general manager with the Braves, calling him &quot;a piece of shit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Deadspin]]: [http://deadspin.com/sports/baseball/our-interview-with-john-rocker-221509.php &quot;John Rocker interview&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steroid use===
In March 2007, Rocker was implicated in a steroid ring that included Applied Pharmacy of [[Mobile, Alabama]]. He was listed on the client list along with 1996 Olympic wrestling gold medalist [[Kurt Angle]].&lt;ref&gt;ESPN.com: [http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/news/story?id=2789825 &quot;Two more arraigned in nationwide steroids probe&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 12 December 2011 New York Baseball Digest article written by Mike Silva, Rocker readily admitted to using steroids, “Yeah, of course I was [using steroids]. I mean who wasn’t? Let’s be honest here, who wasn’t?” &lt;ref&gt;http://nybaseballdigest.com/?p=41966&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movie and television appearances==
Rocker made his screen-acting debut in the [[2002 in film|2002]] horror comedy ''The Greenskeeper'' as a murderous golf-club groundskeeper.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0311231/combined The Greenskeeper (2002)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[2006 in television|2006]], Rocker appeared on the [[Spike TV]] network's ''[[Pros vs. Joes]]'', a program that pits retired professional athletes against amateurs.

Rocker is set to appear in the 2012 film ''Trouble With The Curve'' starring Clint Eastwood.

==Other media activity==
Rocker recently{{when|date=July 2012}} released his [[autobiography]] -- ''Scars and Strikes'' -- and he's also currently writing a column for ''[[World Net Daily]]'', a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] political site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0712/78555.html | title=John Rocker is still throwing heat | work=[[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]] | date=July 16, 2012 | accessdate=July 17, 2012 | author=Gavin, Patrick}}&lt;/ref&gt;
