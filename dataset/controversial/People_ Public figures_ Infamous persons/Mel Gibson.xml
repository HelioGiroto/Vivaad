'''Mel Colm-Cille Gerard Gibson''', [[Officer of the Order of Australia|AO]] (born 3 January 1956) is an American actor, film director, producer and screenwriter. He was born in [[Peekskill, New York|Peekskill]], New York, moved with his parents to [[Sydney]], Australia, when he was 12 years old, and later studied acting at the Australian [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]].

After appearing in the ''[[Mad Max]]'' and ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'' series, Gibson went on to direct and star in the [[Academy Award]]-winning ''[[Braveheart]]''. In 2004, he directed and produced ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', a film portraying the last hours in the life of [[Jesus]].

==Early life==
Gibson was born in [[Peekskill, New York]], the sixth of eleven children, and the second son of [[Hutton Gibson]] and Irish-born Anne Patricia (née Reilly, died 1990).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2008/0208/gibsonm.html |title=Mel Gibson to be honoured at IFTA ceremony&amp;nbsp;– RTÉ Ten |publisher=Rte.ie |accessdate=12 July 2010 |date=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lawrence Donegan |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2004/feb/29/religion.world |title=Observer profile |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 29 February 2004|accessdate=12 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandmother was opera contralto [[Eva Mylott]] (1875–1920), who was born in Australia to Irish parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/gibson.html |title=Ancestry of Mel Gibson |publisher=Wargs.com |accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Gibson's younger brothers, [[Donal Gibson|Donal]], is also an actor. Gibson's first name comes from [[Saint Mel]], fifth-century Irish saint, and founder of Gibson's mother's native [[diocese]], [[bishop of Ardagh|Ardagh]], while his second name, [[Columba|Colm-Cille]],&lt;ref name=&quot;filed&quot; /&gt; is also shared by an Irish saint&lt;ref&gt;Michael Dwyer, ''[[The Irish Times]]'' film critic, interviewed on [[RTÉ]] Radio 1's ''This week'' programme, 6 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and is the name of the parish in [[County Longford]] where Gibson's mother was born and raised. Because of his mother, Gibson holds dual Irish and American citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20178694,00.html| title=Jonathan Rhys Meyers Crowned Best Actor in Ireland| author=Stephen M. Silverman | publisher=People Magazine| accessdate=2 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after being awarded US$145,000 in a work-related-injury lawsuit against [[New York Central Railroad]] on 14 February 1968, Hutton Gibson relocated his family to [[West Pymble]], Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mel Gibson: Living Dangerously|first=Wensley|last=Clarkson|publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|location=New York|year=1993|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mel Gibson was 12 years old at the time. The move to Hutton's mother's native Australia was for economic reasons, and because Hutton thought the [[Australian Defence Forces]] would reject his oldest son for the [[Conscription in Australia#Vietnam War|draft]] during the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Grossman&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/2003-07-31/news/is-the-pope-catholic/| title=Is the Pope Catholic?| author=Wendy Grossman | publisher=Dallas Observer | accessdate=20 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson was educated by members of the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers]] at [[St Leo's Catholic College]] in [[Wahroonga]], New South Wales, during his high school years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,207348,00.html |title=Mel Gibson's Biography/Filmography&amp;nbsp;– Celebrity Gossip, Entertainment News, Arts And Entertainment |publisher=Fox News |date=8 August 2006 |accessdate=13 July 2010 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/03/01/1078117354823.html |title=A son's dangerous passion, in the name of the father&amp;nbsp;– OpinionGerardHenderson |publisher=www.smh.com.au |date=2 March 2004 |accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Gibson gained very favorable notices from film critics when he first entered the cinematic scene, as well as comparisons to several classic movie stars. In 1982, [[Vincent Canby]] wrote that &quot;Mr. Gibson recalls the young [[Steve McQueen]]... I can't define &quot;star quality,&quot; but whatever it is, Mr. Gibson has it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = New Faces Brighten a Mixed Batch of Movies | author=Vincent Canby |work=The New York Times| date = 29 August 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson has also been likened to &quot;a combination [[Clark Gable]] and [[Humphrey Bogart]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Mel Gibson: Australia's new hunk | author=Vernon Scott | publisher=[[U.P.I.]] | date = 24 February 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson's roles in the &quot;Mad Max&quot; series of films, [[Peter Weir]]'s ''[[Gallipoli (1981 film)|Gallipoli]]'', and the &quot;Lethal Weapon&quot; series of films earned him the label of &quot;action hero&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cagle&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,998731-1,00.html|title=Cinema: A Softer Side of Mel|last=Cagle|first=Jess|date=11 December 2000|work=TIME|accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Gibson expanded into a variety of acting projects including human dramas such as ''[[Hamlet]]'', and comedic roles such as those in ''[[Maverick (film)|Maverick]]'' and ''[[What Women Want]]''. He expanded beyond acting into directing and producing, with: ''[[The Man Without a Face]]'', in 1993; ''[[Braveheart]]'', in 1995; ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', in 2004; and ''[[Apocalypto]]'', in 2006. Jess Cagle of ''TIME'' has compared Gibson to [[Cary Grant]], [[Sean Connery]], and [[Robert Redford]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cagle&quot; /&gt; Connery once suggested Gibson should play the next [[James Bond]] to Connery's [[M (James Bond)|''M'']]. Gibson turned down the role, reportedly because he feared being [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mel Gibson: Living Dangerously|first=Wensley|last=Clarkson|publisher=Thunder's Mouth Press|location=New York|year=1993|pages=170–171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stage===
Gibson studied at the [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] (NIDA) in Sydney. The students at NIDA were [[History of theater#Western theatre history|classically]] trained in the British-theater tradition rather than in preparation for [[film|screen]] acting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,23746638-16947,00.html | title = Youth with stars in their eyes | author=Graeme Blundell|authorlink=Graeme Blundell|work=The Australian | date = 24 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As students, Gibson and actress [[Judy Davis]] played the [[leading actor|leads]] in ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', and Gibson played the role of [[Titania|Queen Titania]] in an [[experimental theatre|experimental]] production of ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]].''&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Night on Mount Edna,&quot; 15 December 1990&lt;/ref&gt; After graduation in 1977,&lt;ref name=&quot;Huong&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saigon-gpdaily.com.vn/Entertainment/Movies/2006/8/50652/|title=Mel Gibson Convicted on Drink-driving|last=Huong|first=Nhu|date=18 August 2006|work=[[Sài Gòn Giải Phóng]]|accessdate=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson immediately began work on the filming of ''[[Mad Max]]'', but continued to work as a stage actor, and joined the [[State Theatre Company of South Australia]] in [[Adelaide]]. Gibson’s theatrical credits include the character [[Estragon]] (opposite [[Geoffrey Rush]]) in ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', and the role of Biff Loman in a 1982 production of ''[[Death of a Salesman]]'' in Sydney. Gibson’s most recent theatrical performance, opposite [[Sissy Spacek]], was the 1993 production of ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]'' by [[A. R. Gurney]], in [[Telluride, Colorado|Telluride]], Colorado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Welcome to Telluride&amp;nbsp;– Now Go Away | author=Robert Weller | agency=Associated Press | date = 17 July 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian television and cinema===
While a student at [[National Institute of Dramatic Art|NIDA]], Gibson made his film debut in the 1977 film ''[[Summer City]]'', for which he was paid $400.&lt;ref name=&quot;SunTSA&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/article73313.ece|title=Gibson blushes as first screen kiss surfaces|date=10 July 2005|work=[[The Sunday Times (South Africa)|The Sunday Times]]|accessdate=20 July 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson then played the title character in the film ''[[Mad Max]]'' (1979). He was paid $15000 for this role.&lt;ref name=&quot;SunTSA&quot; /&gt; Shortly after making the film he did a season with the [[State Theatre Company of South Australia|South Australian Theatre Company]]. During this period he shared a $30 a week apartment in [[Adelaide, South Australia|Adelaide]] with his future wife Robyn. After ''Mad Max'' Gibson also played a mentally slow youth in the film ''[[Tim (film)|Tim]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atterton, Margot 1984. p 86&quot;&gt;Atterton, Margot. (Ed.) ''The Illustrated Encyclopaedia of Australian Showbiz'', Sunshine Books, 1984. ISBN 0-86777-057-0 p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period Gibson also appeared in Australian television series guest roles. He appeared in serial ''[[The Sullivans]]'' as naval lieutenant Ray Henderson,&lt;ref&gt;Mercado, Andrew. ''Super Aussie Soaps'', Pluto Press Australia, 2004. ISBN 1-86403-191-3 p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; in [[police procedural]] ''[[Cop Shop]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Atterton, Margot 1984. p 86&quot; /&gt; and in the pilot episode of prison serial ''[[Punishment (TV series)|Punishment]]'' which was produced in 1980, screened 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Mercado, Andrew.

ISBN 0-642-18462-3 pp. 371–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson joined the cast of the [[World War II]] action film ''[[Attack Force Z]]'', which was not released until 1982 when Gibson had become a bigger star. Director [[Peter Weir]] cast Gibson as one of the leads in the critically acclaimed [[World War I]] drama ''[[Gallipoli (1981 film)|Gallipoli]]'', which earned Gibson another Best Actor Award from the [[Australian Film Institute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;The Australian Film Institute. [http://www.afi.org.au/Past_Winners2/AM/ContentManagerNet/ContentDisplay.aspx?ContentID=6460&amp;Section=Past_Winners Past Winners]&lt;/ref&gt; The film ''[[Gallipoli (1981 film)|Gallipoli]]'' also helped to earn Gibson the reputation of a serious, versatile actor and gained him the Hollywood agent [[Ed Limato]]. The sequel ''[[Mad Max 2]]'' was his first hit in America (released as ''The Road Warrior''). In 1982 Gibson again attracted critical acclaim in [[Peter Weir]]’s romantic thriller ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously]]''. Following a year hiatus from film acting after the birth of his twin sons, Gibson took on the role of [[Fletcher Christian]] in ''[[The Bounty]]'' in 1984. Playing [[Max Rockatansky]] for the third time in ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome]]'', in 1985, earned Gibson his first million dollar salary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Valdez |title=Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome (1985) |url=http://thisdistractedglobe.com/2007/12/20/mad-max-beyond-thunderdome-1985/ |work=This Distracted Globe |date=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mel Gibson's first American film was [[Mark Rydell]]’s 1984 drama ''[[The River (1984 film)|The River]]'', in which he and [[Sissy Spacek]] played struggling [[Tennessee]] farmers.

He and [[Matthew Modine]] played condemned convict brothers opposite [[Diane Keaton]] as the warden's wife who visits them to read the Bible. In 1985, after working on four films in a row, Gibson took almost two years off at his Australian [[cattle station]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2000/jul/16/comment.features|title=Mel Gibson: Proud or prejudiced?|last=Morris|first=Mark|date=16 July 2000|work=The Observer |location=UK |accessdate=19 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to play the role of [[Martin Riggs]] in ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'', a film which helped to cement his status as a Hollywood &quot;leading man&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adler&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1547464/20061206/story.jhtml|title=From 'Mad Max' To His Infamous Rant: Mel Gibson's Highs And Lows|last=Adler|first=Shawn|date=7 December 2006|work=MTV|accessdate=19 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson's next film was [[Robert Towne]]’s ''[[Tequila Sunrise (film)|Tequila Sunrise]]'', followed by ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]'', in 1989.

===Director===
Mel Gibson has credited his directors, particularly [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]], [[Peter Weir]], and [[Richard Donner]], with teaching him the craft of filmmaking and influencing him as a director. According to [[Robert Downey, Jr.]], studio executives encouraged Gibson in 1989 to try directing, an idea he rebuffed at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/story/0,23739,23622562-5003420,00.html | title = Robert Downey Jr. has irons in the fire | author=Erin McWhirter| publisher=The Courier Mail | date = 1 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson made his directorial debut in 1993 with ''[[The Man Without a Face]]'', followed two years later by ''[[Braveheart]]'', which earned Gibson the [[Academy Award for Best Director]]. Gibson had long planned to direct a remake of ''[[Fahrenheit 451 (1966 film)|Fahrenheit 451]]'', but in 1999 the project was indefinitely postponed because of scheduling conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117490809.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 | title = Gibson in talks for 'Patriot' | author=Dan Cox and Michael Fleming| publisher=[[Daily Variety]] | date = 1 February 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson was scheduled to direct [[Robert Downey, Jr.]] in a Los Angeles stage production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' in January 2001, but Downey's drug relapse ended the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/935383.stm| title = Gibson Downey Jr becomes Hamlet |publisher=BBC | date = 21 September 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, while promoting ''[[We Were Soldiers]]'' and ''[[Signs (film)|Signs]]'' to the press, Gibson mentioned that he was planning to pare back on acting and return to directing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-and-tv/features/mel-gibson-i-think-im-mellowing-in-my-old-age-642396.html | title = Mel Gibson: 'I think I'm mellowing in my old age' | author=Tiffany Rose |work=The Independent |location=UK | date = 8 September 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2002, Gibson announced that he would direct a film called ''[[The Passion of the Christ|The Passion]]'' in [[Aramaic]] and [[Latin]] with no subtitles because he hoped to &quot;transcend language barriers with filmic storytelling.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/?q=node/13351 |title=Jesus Christ!!

In 2006, he directed the action-adventure film ''[[Apocalypto]]'', his second film to feature sparse dialogue in a non-English language.

===''Mad Max'' series===
{{Main|Mad Max (franchise)}}
Gibson got his breakthrough role as the leather-clad post-apocalyptic survivor in [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]]'s ''[[Mad Max]]''. The independently financed blockbuster helped to make him an international star everywhere but in the United States, where the actors' Australian accents were dubbed with American accents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gilbey&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=201887|title=Been to hear any good films lately?|last=Gilbey|first=Ryan|date=25 July 2001|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original film spawned two sequels: ''[[Mad Max 2]]'' (known in North America as ''The Road Warrior''), and ''[[Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome|Mad Max 3]]'' (known in North America as ''Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome''). A fourth movie, ''[[Mad Max 4: Fury Road]]'', is in development, but both Gibson and [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]] have indicated that the starring role would go to a younger actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===''Gallipoli''===
{{Main|Gallipoli (1981)}}
The 1981 [[Peter Weir]] film, ''Gallipoli'' is about a group of young men from rural [[Western Australia]] who enlist in the [[First Australian Imperial Force|Australian Imperial Force]] during [[World War I]]. They are sent to invade the [[Ottoman Empire]], where they take part in the 1915 [[Gallipoli Campaign]]. During the course of the movie, the young men slowly lose their innocence about the war. The climax of the movie centers around the catastrophic AIF offensive known as the [[Battle of the Nek]]. 

[[Peter Weir]] cast Gibson in the role of Frank Dunne, an [[Irish-Australian]] drifter with an intense [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] about fighting for the [[British Empire]]. Newcomer [[Mark Lee (actor)|Mark Lee]] was recruited to play the idealistic Archy Hamilton after participating in a photo session for the director.  Gibson later recalled:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I'd auditioned for an earlier film and he told me right up front, ‘I'm not going to cast you for this part. You're not old enough. But thanks for coming in, I just wanted to meet you.’ He told me he wanted me for ''Gallipoli'' a couple of years later because I wasn't the archetypal Australian. He had [[Mark Lee (actor)|Mark Lee]], the angelic-looking, ideal Australian kid, and he wanted something of a modern sensibility. He thought the audience needed someone to relate to&lt;!-- OK here: don't correct it--&gt; of their own time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Mel’s Movies | author = Michael Fleming | publisher = Movieline |date=July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gibson later said that ''Gallipolli'' is, &quot;Not really a war movie. That's just the backdrop. It's really the story of two young men.&quot;

The critically acclaimed film helped to further launch Gibson's career.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, Greg.

===''The Year of Living Dangerously''===
{{Main|The Year of Living Dangerously}}
Gibson played a naïve but ambitious journalist opposite [[Sigourney Weaver]] and [[Linda Hunt]] in [[Peter Weir]]’s atmospheric 1982 film ''[[The Year of Living Dangerously]]'', based on the novel of the same name by [[Christopher Koch]]. The movie was both a critical and commercial success, and the upcoming Australian actor was heavily marketed by [[MGM]] studio. In his review of the film, Vincent Canby of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, &quot;If this film doesn't make an international star of Mr. Gibson, then nothing will. He possesses both the necessary talent and the screen presence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Year of Living Dangerously | author=Vincent Canby |work=The New York Times| date = 21 January 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to John Hiscock of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', the film did, indeed, establish Gibson as an international talent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hiscock&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/7044121/Mel-Gibson-interview.html|title=Mel Gibson interview|last=Hiscock|first=John|date=21 January 2010|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |accessdate=20 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson was initially reluctant to accept the role of Guy Hamilton. &quot;I didn't necessarily see my role as a great challenge. My character was, like the film suggests, a puppet. And I went with that. It wasn't some star thing, even though they advertised it that way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Mel's Movies | author=Michael Fleming | publisher=Movieline |date=July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson saw some similarities between himself and the character of Guy. &quot;He's not a silver-tongued devil. He's kind of immature and he has some rough edges and I guess you could say the same for me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt; Gibson has cited this screen performance as his personal favorite.{{When|date=March 2010}}

===''The Bounty''===
{{Main|The Bounty}}
Gibson followed the footsteps of [[Errol Flynn]], [[Clark Gable]], and [[Marlon Brando]] by starring as [[Fletcher Christian]] in a cinematic retelling of the [[mutiny on the Bounty]]. The resulting 1984 film ''[[The Bounty]]'' is considered to be the most historically accurate version. However, Gibson has expressed a belief that the film's revisionism did not go far enough. He has stated that his character should have been portrayed as the film's [[antagonist]]. He has further praised [[Anthony Hopkins]]'s performance as Lieutenant [[William Bligh]] as the best aspect of the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot; /&gt;

===''Lethal Weapon'' series===
{{Main|Lethal Weapon (film series)}}
Gibson moved into more mainstream commercial filmmaking with the popular [[buddy cop]] ''Lethal Weapon'' series, which began with the 1987 original. In the films he played [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Detective [[Martin Riggs]], a recently widowed [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] veteran with a death wish and a penchant for violence and gunplay. In the films, he is partnered with a reserved family man named [[Roger Murtaugh]] ([[Danny Glover]]). Following the success of ''[[Lethal Weapon]]'', director [[Richard Donner]] and principal cast revisited the characters in three sequels, ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]'' (1989), ''[[Lethal Weapon 3]]'' (1993), and ''[[Lethal Weapon 4]]'' (1998). With its fourth installment, the ''Lethal Weapon'' series embodied &quot;the quintessence of the [[Buddy cop film|buddy cop pic]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Klady&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117477677.html?categoryid=31&amp;cs=1|title=Lethal Weapon 4 Review|last=Klady|first=Leonard|date=8 July 1998|work=Variety |accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Hamlet''===
{{Main|Hamlet (1990 film)}}
Gibson made the unusual transition from the action to classical genres, playing the melancholic Danish prince in [[Franco Zeffirelli]]'s [[Hamlet (1990 film)|''Hamlet'']]. Gibson was cast alongside such experienced [[Shakespearean]] actors as [[Ian Holm]], [[Alan Bates]], and [[Paul Scofield]]. He described working with his fellow cast members as similar to being &quot;thrown into the ring with [[Mike Tyson]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1582308/Paul-Scofields-career-highlights.html Paul Scofield's career highlights], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 20 March 2008.

===''Braveheart''===
{{Main|Braveheart}}
[[Image:Brave mel.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Mel Gibson as William Wallace wearing [[Isatis tinctoria|woad]].]]
In 1995, Mel Gibson directed, produced, and starred in ''[[Braveheart]]'', a [[biopic]] of Sir [[William Wallace]], a Scottish nationalist who was executed in 1305 for, &quot;[[high treason]],&quot; against King [[Edward I of England]]. Gibson received two [[Academy Award]]s, [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] and [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], for his second directorial effort. In winning the Academy Award for Best Director, Gibson became only the sixth actor-turned-filmmaker to do so.&lt;ref name=AW95&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmsite.org/aa95.html |title=1995 Academy Awards |publisher=Filmsite.org |accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Braveheart]]'' influenced the Scottish nationalist movement and helped to revive the film genre of the historical epic; the [[Battle of Stirling Bridge]] sequence is considered by critics to be one of the all-time-best-directed battle scenes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/29/movie.battles/] The best&amp;nbsp;– and worst&amp;nbsp;– movie battle scenes 2 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's depiction of the [[Edward II of England|Prince of Wales]] as an effeminate [[homosexual]] caused the film to be attacked by the Gay Alliance. The Gay Alliance was especially enraged by a scene in which King Edward I murders his son's male lover by throwing him out a castle window.

Gibson replied, &quot;The fact that King Edward throws this character out a window has nothing to do with him being gay ... He's terrible to his son, to everybody.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

{{quote|We cut a scene out, unfortunately . . . where you really got to know that character (Edward II) and to understand his plight and his pain. . . .

===''The Passion of the Christ''===
{{Main|The Passion of the Christ}}
Gibson directed, produced, co-wrote, and funded the 2004 film ''[[The Passion of the Christ]],'' which chronicled the [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]] and death of [[Jesus]] ([[Jim Caviezel]]). The film was shot exclusively in [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]], [[Latin]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]. Although Gibson originally intended to release the film without subtitles; he eventually relented for theatrical exhibition. The film sparked divergent reviews, ranging from high praise to criticism of the violence.

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] further accused Gibson of [[anti-semitism]] over the film's unflattering depiction of [[Caiaphas]] and the [[Sanhedrin]]. Among those to defend Gibson were [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jewish]] Rabbi [[Daniel Lapin]] and radio personality [[Michael Medved]]. Referring to ADL National Director [[Abraham Foxman]], Rabbi Lapin said that by calling ''The Passion of the Christ'' [[antisemitism|anti-Semitic]], &quot;what he is saying is that the only way (for Christians) to escape the wrath of Foxman is to repudiate (their own) faith.&quot;

In an interview with the ''[[Globe and Mail]]'', Gibson stated, &quot;If anyone has distorted Gospel passages to rationalize cruelty towards Jews or anyone, it's in defiance of repeated Papal condemnation. The [[Papacy]] has condemned [[racism]] in any form... Jesus died for the sins of all times, and I'll be the first on the line for culpability&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Mel Gibson Interview | publisher=Globe and Mail|date=14 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the continued media attacks began to anger Gibson. After his father's Holocaust denial was sharply criticized in print by ''The New York Times'' writer [[Frank Rich]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |http://url=www.nytimes.com/2003/08/03/arts/03RICH.html |title=Mel Gibson's Martyrdom Complex |author=Frank Rich |date=3 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson retorted, &quot;I want to kill him.

Gibson's [[Traditionalist Catholic]] upbringing was also the target of criticism. In a 2006 interview with [[Diane Sawyer]], Gibson stated that he feels that his &quot;human rights were violated&quot; by the often vitriolic attacks on his person, his family, and his religious beliefs which were sparked by ''The Passion''.&lt;ref name=2004prime /&gt;

Gibson himself has stated that the film is an attempt at making a deliberate point about great civilizations and what causes them to decline and disintegrate. Gibson said, &quot;People think that modern man is so enlightened, but we're susceptible to the same forces – and we are also capable of the same heroism and transcendence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wildaboutmovies&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildaboutmovies.com/movies/ApocalyptoMovieTrailerPosterMelGibson.php |title=''Apocalypto'' First Look |publisher=WildAboutMovies}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15001985/ |title=Mel Gibson criticizes Iraq war at film fest – Troubled filmmaker draws parallels to collapsing Mayan civilization |agency=Associated Press |date=25 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This theme is further explored by a quote from [[Will Durant]], which is superimposed at the very beginning of the film: &quot;A great civilization is not conquered from without until it has destroyed itself from within.&quot;

In 2005, the film ''Sam and George'' was announced as the seventh collaboration between director [[Richard Donner]] and Gibson. In February 2009, Donner said that this [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] project was &quot;dead,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedigitalbits.com/articles/interviews/richarddonner/donnerinterview.html|title= Inside Man: Richard Donner on Inside Moves |author=Adam Jahnke |date= 27 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but that he and Gibson were planning another film based on an original script by [[Brian Helgeland]] for production in fall 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aintitcool.com/node/40175|title= Richard Donner And Mr. Beaks Talk INSIDE MOVES! |publisher=Aint It Cool News |author=Mr. Beaks |date= 19 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, it was announced that Gibson had commissioned a [[screenplay]] from [[Joe Eszterhas]] about the [[Maccabees]]. The film is to be distributed by [[Warner Brothers Pictures]]. The announcement generated significant controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.yahoo.com/news/jewish-leaders-slam-mel-gibson--warner-bros--for-judah-maccabee-movie--exclusive-.html Jewish Leaders Slam Mel Gibson and Warner Brothers for Judah Maccabee Movie].&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2012, Eszterhas wrote a letter to Gibson accusing him of sabotaging their movie about the Maccabees because he &quot;hates Jews&quot;, and citing a series of private incidents during which he allegedly heard Gibson express extremely racist views. Although written as a private letter, it was subsequently published on a film industry website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Eszterhas open letter to Mel Gibson|last=Eszterhas|first=Joe|url=http://www.thewrap.com/movies/article/joe-eszterhas-letter-mel-gibson-36949}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, however, Gibson stated that he still intends to make the movie, but will not base it upon Eszterhas' script, which he called substandard.

In a 2012 interview, Gibson explained that the Maccabees film was still in preparation. He explained he was drawn to the Biblical account the uprising due to its similarity to the [[Western (genre)|Western genre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;herocomplex.latimes.com&quot;/&gt;

==Personal life==

===Family===
Gibson met Robyn Denise Moore in the late 1970s soon after filming ''[[Mad Max]]'' when they were both tenants at a house in [[Adelaide]].

In April 2011, Gibson finally broke his silence about the incident in question. In an interview with [[Deadline.com]], Gibson expressed gratitude to longtime friends [[Whoopi Goldberg]] and [[Jodie Foster]], both of whom had spoken publicly in his defense. About the recordings, Gibson said, {{quote|I’ve never treated anyone badly or in a discriminatory way based on their gender, race, religion or sexuality – period. I don’t blame some people for thinking that though, from the garbage they heard on those leaked tapes, which have been edited. You have to put it all in the proper context of being in an irrationally, heated discussion at the height of a breakdown, trying to get out of a really unhealthy relationship. It’s one terribly, awful moment in time, said to one person, in the span of one day and doesn’t represent what I truly believe or how I’ve treated people my entire life.&lt;ref name=&quot;deadline.com&quot; /&gt;}}

In the same interview, Gibson stated, {{quote|I was allowed to end the case and still maintain my innocence. It’s called a [[Nolo contendere#California|West Plea]]&lt;ref&gt;The People of the State of California v. Dale West, 3 Cal. 3d 595; 477 P.2d 409 (California Supreme Court, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt; and it’s not something that prosecutors normally allow. But in my case, the prosecutors and the judge agreed that it was the right thing to do. I could have continued to fight this for years and it probably would have come out fine. But I ended it for my children and my family. This was going to be such a circus. You don’t drag other people in your life through this sewer needlessly, so I’ll take the hit and move on.&lt;ref name=&quot;deadline.com&quot; /&gt;}}

===Prankster===
Gibson has a reputation for practical jokes, puns, [[The Three Stooges|Stooge]]-inspired physical comedy, and doing outrageous things to shock people. As a director he sometimes breaks the tension on set by having his actors perform serious scenes wearing a red clown nose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101030127-409570,00.html The Passion of Mel Gibson] 19 January 2003, Time.com Accessed 9 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Helena Bonham Carter]], who appeared alongside him in ''[[Hamlet (1990 film)|Hamlet]]'', said of him, &quot;He has a very basic sense of humor.

In a 2011 interview, Gibson said of his philanthropic works, &quot;It gives you perspective. It’s one of my faults, you tend to focus on yourself a lot.

==Religious and political views==

===Faith===
Gibson was raised a [[traditionalist Catholic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Grossman&quot; /&gt; When asked about the Catholic doctrine of &quot;''[[Extra Ecclesiam nulla salus]]''&quot;, Gibson replied, &quot;There is no salvation for those outside the Church ... I believe it. Put it this way. My wife is a saint. She's a much better person than I am. Honestly. She's... Episcopalian, Church of England. She prays, she believes in God, she knows Jesus, she believes in that stuff. And it's just not fair if she doesn't make it, she's better than I am. But that is a pronouncement from the chair. I go with it.&quot;&lt;ref name=gibsonquotes&gt;{{cite news |title= Mel Gibson: 'I Am Deeply Ashamed' |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20059176,00.html |first=Allison |last=Adato |work=People |date=14 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pboyer&gt;Boyer, Peter J.

===Politics===
Gibson has been described as &quot;ultraconservative&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;time.com-Apocalytpo&quot;&gt;Padgett/Veracruz, Tim. [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1174684-2,00.html &quot;Apocalypto Now.&quot;] ''Time''. 19 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson complimented filmmaker [[Michael Moore]] and his documentary ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'' when he and Moore were recognized at the 2005 [[People's Choice Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,143924,00.html &quot;Moore, Gibson: I Love His Work.&quot;] Fox News. 10 January 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson's [[Icon Productions]] originally agreed to finance Moore's film, but later sold the rights to [[Miramax Films]]. Moore said that his agent [[Ari Emanuel]] claimed that &quot;top Republicans&quot; called Mel Gibson to tell him, &quot;don’t expect to get more invitations to the White House&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Keough, Peter.

In a July 1995 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, Gibson said President [[Bill Clinton]] was a &quot;low-level opportunist&quot; and someone was &quot;telling him what to do&quot;. He said that the [[Rhodes Scholarship]] was established for young men and women who want to strive for a &quot;[[new World Order (conspiracy theory)|new world order]]&quot; and this was a campaign for Marxism.&lt;ref name=pb&gt;Grobel, Lawrence. &quot;Interview: Mel Gibson&quot;. ''[[Playboy]]''. July 1995. Vol. 42, No. 7, Pg. 51.

In 2004, he publicly spoke out against taxpayer-funded [[Stem cell|embryonic stem-cell research]] that involves the cloning and destruction of human embryos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalreview.com/interrogatory/gibson200411010950.asp &quot;Braveheart Stands Athwart a Brave New World.&quot;] ''National Review''. 1 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005, he condemned the outcome of the [[Terri Schiavo case]], referring to Schiavo's death as &quot;state-sanctioned murder&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/10/opinion/10rich.html?pagewanted=all&amp;position=|title=A Culture of Death, Not Life|last=Rich|first=Frank|date=10 April 2005|work=New York Times|accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson questioned the [[Iraq War]] in March 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/03/18/1079199319258.html &quot;Mel Gibson joins stars to question Iraq war.&quot;] ''Sydney Morning Herald''. 18 March 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, Gibson said that the &quot;fearmongering&quot; depicted in his film ''Apocalypto'' &quot;reminds me a little of President Bush and his guys.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;time.com-Apocalytpo&quot; /&gt;

In a 2011 interview, Gibson stated, &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The whole notion of politics is they always present you with this or this or this. I’ll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why do you have to adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they’re all in a box. And you watch [[Fox News|Fox]] claw [[CNN]], and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I’m not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it’s a whole other world. Once you’ve been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you know the facts and see how they’re presented, it’s mind-boggling. It’s a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It’s kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It’s always disappointing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;deadline.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Controversial remarks==

===Accusations of homophobia===
{{See also|Braveheart#Portrayal of Prince Edward}}
The [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD) accused Gibson of [[homophobia]] after a December 1991 interview in the Spanish newspaper ''[[El País]]'' in which he made derogatory comments about [[homosexual]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;deangelis&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfbay&quot;&gt;Wockner, Rex. [http://www.sfbaytimes.com/index.php?sec=article&amp;article_id=5399 &quot;Mel Gibson, Circa 1992, &quot;Refuses to Apologize to Gays&quot;.&quot;] ''San Francisco Bay Times''. 17 August 2006. Quote: Asked what he thought of gay people, he said, &quot;They take it up the ass.&quot; Gibson then proceeded to point at his posterior and said: &quot;This is only for taking a shit.&quot; When reminded that he had worked closely with gay people at drama school, Gibson said, &quot;They were good people, kind, I like them. But their thing is not my thing.&quot; When the interviewer asked if Gibson was afraid that people would think he is gay because he's an actor, Gibson replied, &quot;Do I sound like a homosexual? Do I talk like them? Do I move like them? What happens is when you're an actor, they stick that label on you.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson later defended his comments&lt;ref name=&quot;sfbay&quot; /&gt; and rejected calls to apologize.&lt;ref name=pb /&gt; However, Gibson joined GLAAD in hosting 10 [[lesbian]] and gay filmmakers for an on-location seminar on the set of the movie ''[[Conspiracy Theory (film)|Conspiracy Theory]]'' in January 1997.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glaad.org/media/archive_detail.php?id=181 &quot;Mel Gibson to Meet Up-and-Coming Lesbian and Gay Filmmakers.&quot;]{{dead link|date=July 2011}} glaad.org.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 when asked about the comments to ''El País'', Gibson said, &quot;I shouldn't have said it, but I was tickling a bit of [[vodka]] during that interview, and the quote came back to bite me on the ass.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NutTeKoha&quot; /&gt;

===Alleged anti-semitism in ''The Passion of the Christ''===
{{Main|The Passion of the Christ#Allegations of anti-Semitism}}
Gibson's 2004 film ''The Passion of the Christ'' sparked a fierce debate over alleged antisemitic imagery and overtones. Gibson denied that the film was antisemitic, but critics remained divided. Some agreed that the film was consistent with the [[Gospel]]s and traditional Catholic teachings, while others argued that it reflected a selective reading of the Gospels.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.bc.edu/research/cjl/meta-elements/texts/cjrelations/resources/education/dramatizing_the_death.htm Some criticism of The Passion]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[James Carroll (novelist)|James Carroll]], in ''[[Constantine's Sword: The Church and the Jews]]'', states that the Catholic Church traditionally blames the Jews for the death of Jesus; [[John Dominic Crossan]]'s ''Who Killed Jesus'' points out that the traditional Jewish method of execution was [[stoning]]; [[crucifixion]] was a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] method. Crossan also looks at the record of [[Pontius Pilate]], who never hesitated to use extreme measures against unruly Jews.

===Allegations of domestic violence===
In July 2010, it was alleged that Gibson had been recorded during a phone call with Oksana Grigorieva suggesting that if she got &quot;raped by a pack of niggers,&quot; she would be to blame.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianjuly2&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first = Ed | last = Pilkington | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2010/jul/02/mel-gibson-racist-rant | title = Mel Gibson faces flak again after alleged racist rant | date = 2 July 2010 |work=The Guardian |location=UK | accessdate =2 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraphjuly15&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/celebritynews/7891640/Mel-Gibson-threatens-to-burn-house-down-in-new-tape.html | title = Mel Gibson 'threatens to burn house down in new tape' | date = 15 July 2010 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | accessdate =15 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hitting&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first = Anthony | last = McCartney | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/07/12/AR2010071202673.html | title = Gibson tape mentions alleged hitting of girlfriend | date = 12 July 2010 | agency=Associated Press | publisher=Washington Post |accessdate =12 July 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radaronline.com/exclusives/2010/07/world-exclusive-audio-mel-gibsons-explosive-racist-rant-listen-it-here |title=Original Internet posting of Gibson's alleged words |publisher=Radaronline.com|date=12 July 2010|accessdate=24 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson was barred from coming near Grigorieva or her daughter due to a [[domestic violence]]-related [[restraining order]].&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianjuly2&quot; /&gt; The Los Angeles County Sheriff’s Department has launched a domestic violence investigation against Gibson.&lt;ref name=&quot;abuseinvestigation2&quot; /&gt; The investigation was dropped when Gibson pled no contest to a midemeanor battery charge.

===Accusations of racism===
On 8 July 2010, Gibson was alleged to have used the term &quot;[[wetback (slur)|wetbacks]]&quot; as he suggested turning in one of his employees to the [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;recordingspostedandtalentagency&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/ktla-mel-gibson-domestic-violence,0,4501825.story | title = Website Posts Recording of Gibson's Racist Rant, Actor Dropped by Talent Agency | date = 9 July 2010 |work=Los Angeles Times | accessdate =9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alcohol abuse and legal issues==
Gibson has said that he started drinking at the age of thirteen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,21062683-5005961,00.html &quot;Rant aftermath a gift, says Gibson.&quot;]{{dead link|date=July 2011}} ''Herald Sun''. 15 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2002 interview about his time at [[National Institute of Dramatic Art|NIDA]], Gibson said, &quot;I had really good highs but some very low lows. I found out recently I'm [[bipolar disorder|manic depressive]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/stay-in-touch/mel-gibson-talks-about-bipolar-struggle/2008/05/14/1210444527205.html| title=Mel opens up, but ever so fleetingly | author=Murray, Elicia and Garry Maddox|work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date=15 May 2008| accessdate=15 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gibson was banned from driving in Ontario for three months in 1984, after rear-ending a car in Toronto while under the influence of alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mel Gibson talks about Braveheart, movie stardom, and media treachery |url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/Issues/1995-05-25/film/film_3.html |author=Seitz, Matt Zoller |work=Dallas Observer |date=25 May 1995 |accessdate=29 July 2006}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He retreated to his Australian farm for over a year to recover, but he continued to struggle with drinking. Despite this problem, Gibson gained a reputation in Hollywood for professionalism and punctuality such that ''[[Lethal Weapon 2]]'' director [[Richard Donner]] was shocked when Gibson confided that he was drinking five pints of beer for breakfast.&lt;ref name=2004prime /&gt; Reflecting in 2003 and 2004, Gibson said that despair in his mid-30s led him to contemplate suicide, and he meditated on [[Christ's Passion]] to heal his wounds.&lt;ref name=2004prime /&gt;&lt;ref name=pboyer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://archives.starbulletin.com/2004/02/22/news/index2.html |title=Mel Gibson's Passion |author=Ryan, Tim |work=Honolulu Star-Bulletin |date=22 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took more time off acting in 1991 and sought professional help.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wright&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/people/youre-not-a-jew-are-you/2006/08/04/1154198332750.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap2|title=You're not a Jew, are you?|last=Wright|first=Gerard|date=5 August 2006|work=The Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Gibson's attorneys were unsuccessful at blocking the ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' from publishing what Gibson shared at [[Alcoholics Anonymous|AA]] meetings.&lt;ref&gt;''The Advertiser''. 22 September 1991&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=February 2009}} In 1992, Gibson provided financial support to Hollywood's Recovery Center, saying, &quot;Alcoholism is something that runs in my family. It's something that's close to me. People do come back from it, and it's a miracle.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Higgins, Bill. ''Los Angeles Times''. 14 December 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mel Gibson taken July-28-2006.jpg|thumb|upright|Mugshot of Mel Gibson taken on 28 July 2006.]]
On 28 July 2006, Gibson was arrested for [[driving under the influence]] (DUI) while speeding in his vehicle with an open container of alcohol, which is illegal in much of the [[United States]]. According to a 2011 article in ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', Gibson first told the arresting officer, &quot;My life is over. I’m fucked. Robyn’s going to leave me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vanity Fair, March 2011&quot;&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/features/2011/03/mel-gibson-201103#gotopage3 Vanity Fair, March 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the arrest report, Gibson then exploded into an angry tirade at the arresting officer. Gibson climaxed with the words, &quot;Fucking Jews... the Jews are responsible for all the wars in the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/30/us/30gibson.html?_r=1&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22jews%20are%20responsible%22%20gibson&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | title=Mel Gibson Apologizes for Tirade After Arrest | date=30 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tmz&gt;''[http://www.tmz.com/2006/07/28/gibsons-anti-semitic-tirade-alleged-cover-up/] Gibson's Anti-Semitic Tirade&amp;nbsp;– Alleged Cover Up''; [[TMZ.com]]; 28 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

After the arrest report was leaked on [[TMZ.com]], Gibson issued two apologies through his publicist,&lt;ref name=&quot;apology2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/14135592/ |title=Gibson's statement about anti-Semitic remarks |publisher=MSNBC |date=8 January 2006 |accessdate=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/n/a/2006/07/29/entertainment/e133616D89.DTL |title=Mel Gibson's Statement on His DUI Arrest |work=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=12 July 2010 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in a televised interview with Diane Sawyer, he affirmed the accuracy of the quotations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1545484,00.html| title = Mel Gibson Admits He Drank After Arrest| author=Stephen M.

On 17 August 2006, Gibson pleaded no contest to a misdemeanor drunken-driving charge and was sentenced to three years probation.&lt;ref name=&quot;first role&quot; /&gt; He was ordered to attend self-help meetings five times a week for four and a half months and three times a week for the remainder of the first year of his probation. He was also ordered to attend a First Offenders Program, was fined $1,300, and his license was restricted for 90 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;first role&quot; /&gt;

At a May 2007 progress hearing, Gibson was praised for his compliance with the terms of his probation and his extensive participation in a self-help program beyond what was required.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/5/11/153226.shtml &quot;Mel Gibson Praised for Progress in Alcohol Rehab.&quot;] ''Newsmax''. 12 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a friend interviewed on condition of anonymity, &quot;It is my belief he felt that he had just absolutely failed as a human being. Mel was trying to invite [[suicide by cop|death by cop]]. I don’t think this was about being anti-Semitic. I think he was trying to rile that guy into pulling out a gun and shooting him. Before he left the restaurant that night, he went to every single table and said good-bye. Why would you say good-bye to every table unless you think you’re never going to see them again? I believe that what was going on that night was a farewell.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Vanity Fair, March 2011&quot;/&gt;
