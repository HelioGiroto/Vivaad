'''Mary Bono Mack''' (born October 24, 1961) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|CA|45}}, and previously the 44th, serving since 1998. She is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The district is based in [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] and includes most of central and eastern [[Riverside County]]. Bono Mack sits on the [[Energy and Commerce Committee]], and is Chairwoman for the Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing and Trade. Bono Mack is the only Republican woman in California's congressional delegation.

==Early life and career==
Bono Mack was born '''Mary Whitaker''' in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], to Clay Whitaker, a physician and World War II veteran, and Karen Whitaker, a chemist. In 1963, in her second year, she moved with her parents to [[South Pasadena, California]].&lt;ref&gt;Mary Bono Mack: &quot;About Mary&quot;. From official web site. Retrieved from http://bono.house.gov/biography.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bono Mack worked her way through the [[University of Southern California]], graduating in 1984 with a bachelor of arts in art history. She was an accomplished [[gymnastics|gymnast]] in her youth.{{fact|date=September 2012}}

In 1986, Bono Mack married singer and actor [[Sonny Bono]] and moved to Palm Springs. Soon after, Sonny Bono became interested in politics, serving as [[Mayor of Palm Springs]] from 1988 to 1992 before being elected to Congress in 1994. Because of Sonny Bono's commitment to [[Scientology]] at the time, Bono Mack took some Scientology courses together with her husband, but soon decided it was not for her.&lt;ref name=&quot;bardach&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Proud Mary Bono |work=[[George (magazine)|George Magazine]] |date=August 1999 |last=Bardach |first=Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sonny Bono died in a skiing accident on January 5, 1998. Subsequently, Bono Mack won the Republican nomination for the special election to succeed him. She then won in the special election held on April 7, 1998. She won a full term later that same year, in November 1998, and she has been re-elected continuously since.{{fact|date=September 2012}}

As of 2007, Bono Mack was one of eight representatives to have been elected to their seats following the deaths of their husbands: [[Lindy Boggs]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Louisiana|LA]]); [[Frances Payne Bolton]] (R-[[Ohio|OH]]); [[Jo Ann Emerson]] (R-[[Missouri|MO]]); [[Lois Capps]] (D-[[California|CA]]); [[Doris Matsui]] (D-CA); [[Beverly Byron]] (D-MD); and [[Sala Burton]] (D-CA).{{fact|date=September 2012}}

==Congressional career==
The 45th had been a Republican stronghold, but has become much more Democratic in recent years; it currently has a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of R+3. While [[Moreno Valley]] and Palm Springs have a slight Democratic tilt, [[Palm Desert]] is strongly conservative. Her district includes the highest percentage of gays and lesbians of any district represented by a Republican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/publications/SameSexCouplesandGLBpopACS.pdf | title = Same-sex Couples and the Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual Population: New Estimates from the American Community Survey | publisher = The Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation Law and Public Policy, [[UCLA School of Law]] | date = October, 2006 | accessdate = February 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bono Mack followed the Republican Party line 89% of the time according to ''[[Congressional Quarterly]]''. In 2004, she received an 84% approval rating from the [[Christian Coalition of America]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cc.org/2004scorecard.pdf ]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this fell to 33% in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cc.org/files/3/2008_Scorecard_8_5x11.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, she voted in favor of the Largent Amendment,&lt;ref&gt;http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1999/roll346.xml&lt;/ref&gt; to ban [[adoption by same-sex couples]] in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.commondreams.org/pressreleases/july99/072999f.htm |title=Human Rights Campaign |publisher=Commondreams.org |date=1999-07-29 |accessdate=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bono Mack has, however, voted against the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] twice. In 1998, Bono Mack was added to the House Judiciary Committee by the Republican leadership in anticipation of the consideration of impeachment proceedings against then President Bill Clinton, thus becoming the only Republican woman on the committee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/judiciary082198.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Bono Mack proceeded to vote along party lines on all four motions for impeachment, which were decided 21 to 16.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/impeachvote121198.htm&lt;/ref&gt; During the full House floor consideration of the four impeachment motions, Bono Mack voted for impeachment on all four articles while some moderate Republican House members voted against Articles II, III, and IV.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/housevote/ca.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the congresswoman's legislative history includes a bill that calls for country-of-origin labeling for fresh fruits and vegetables, as well as several energy-saving bills to reward companies for utilizing clean burning fuel technologies and increase the energy-efficiency of federal buildings. In 2000, Bono Mack helped pass legislation that established the [[Santa Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains National Monument]] in the [[Palm Springs]] region. The House of Representatives passed her [[Cyber-security regulation#Proposed regulation|'''S'''ecurely '''P'''rotect '''Y'''ourself '''A'''gainst '''C'''yber '''T'''respass]] (SPY ACT), which would protect an individual's personal information on the Web. Also, Bono Mack has sponsored legislation that provides funding for obesity studies and improved nutrition programs nationwide, autism research, and Federal funding under the Ryan White HIV/AIDS Act.&lt;ref name=&quot;bono.house.gov&quot;&gt;[http://bono.house.gov/Biography/] Congresswoman Mary Bono Mack: Biography&lt;/ref&gt;

Bono Mack was a leading proponent of the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]] of 1998, the so-called Mickey Mouse Law, which extended the terms of copyright. Giving a speech on the floor of Congress in favor of the bill, Bono Mack said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Actually, Sonny wanted the term of copyright protection to last forever. I am informed by staff that such a change would violate the Constitution.... As you know, there is also [Motion Picture Association of America president] Jack Valenti's proposal for the term to last forever less one day. Perhaps the Committee may look at that next Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frwebgate1.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/waisgate.cgi?WAISdocID=151115310684+0+0+0&amp;WAISaction=retrieve 144 Congressional Record H9952]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She won her sixth term in 2008 with 58% of the vote,&lt;ref&gt;Riverside County Registrar of Voters&lt;/ref&gt; down slightly from 60.7% in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marybono.com/news.php?id=113 Bono Election Day Schedule]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2006_general/congress.pdf |title=sov_detail_congress.xls |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, Bono Mack was one of fifteen Republican House members to vote in favor of repealing the [[United States military]]'s &quot;[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]&quot; ban on [[Coming out|openly homosexual]] service members.&lt;ref name=metro_weekly_20101215&gt;Chris Geidner, [http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2010/12/breaking-house-passes-dadt-rep.html House Passes DADT Repeal Bill], ''[[Metro Weekly]]'' (December 15, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes_20101215&gt;[http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/111/house/2/638 House Vote 638 – Repeals 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell'], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (December 15, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

Bono Mack has received numerous awards from such organizations as [[Americans for Tax Reform]], [[National Federation of Independent Businesses]], the [[National Association of Manufacturers]], and the [[SunLine Transit Agency]] for her support of alternative fuel technologies.&lt;ref name=&quot;bono.house.gov&quot;/&gt; She is also a signer of the Taxpayer Protection Pledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atr.org/current-taxpayer-protection-pledge-signers-th-a2851 |title=Current Taxpayer Protection Pledge Signers |publisher=Atr.org |date= |accessdate=2010-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Bono Mack voted for the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ibtimes.com/ndaa-bill-how-did-your-congress-member-vote-384362&lt;/ref&gt;
