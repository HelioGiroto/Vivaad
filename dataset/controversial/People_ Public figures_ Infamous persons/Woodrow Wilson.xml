'''Thomas Woodrow Wilson''' (December 28, 1856 – February 3, 1924) was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|28th]] [[President of the United States]], from 1913 to 1921. A leader of the [[Progressive Movement]], he served as [[President of Princeton University|President]] of [[Princeton University]] from 1902 to 1910, and then as the [[Governor of New Jersey]] from 1911 to 1913. Running against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[William Howard Taft]] and [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive (&quot;Bull Moose&quot;) Party]] candidate [[Theodore Roosevelt]], a former President, Wilson was [[United States presidential election, 1912|elected]] President as a [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] in 1912. 

In his first term as President Wilson persuaded a Democratic [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass major progressive reforms. Historian [[John M. Cooper]] argues that, in his first term, Wilson successfully pushed a legislative agenda that few presidents have equaled, and remained unmatched up until the [[New Deal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated201&quot;&gt;Cooper, John Milton. &quot;Woodrow Wilson: A Biography&quot;. p201&lt;/ref&gt; This agenda included the [[Federal Reserve Act]], [[Federal Trade Commission Act]], the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]], the [[Federal Farm Loan Act]] and an [[Income Tax in the United States|income tax]]. [[Child labor]] was curtailed by the [[Keating–Owen Act]] of 1916, but the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] declared it unconstitutional in 1918. He also had Congress pass the [[Adamson Act]], which imposed an 8-hour workday for railroads.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated550&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |first=K. Austin |last=Kerr |title=Decision For Federal Control: Wilson, McAdoo, and the Railroads, 1917 |jstor=2937406 |journal=Journal of American History |volume=54 |issue=3 |year=1967 |pages=550–560 |doi=10.2307/2937406 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson, after first sidestepping the issue, became a major advocate for the [[Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|women's suffrage]]. Although Wilson promised African Americans 'fair dealing...in advancing the interests of their race in the United States&quot; the Wilson administration implemented a policy of racial segregation for federal employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weiss|first=Nancy J. |title=The Negro and the New Freedom: Fighting Wilsonian Segregation |journal=Political Science Quarterly |volume=84 |year=1969 |page=63}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Narrowly [[United States presidential election, 1916|re-elected]] in 1916, he had full control of [[American entry into World War I]], and his second term centered on World War I and the subsequent peace treaty negotiations in Paris. He based his re-election campaign around the slogan, &quot;He kept us out of war&quot;, but U.S. neutrality was challenged in early 1917 when the [[German Empire]] began unrestricted submarine warfare despite repeated strong warnings and tried to [[Zimmermann Telegram|enlist Mexico as an ally]]. In April 1917, Wilson asked Congress to [[Declaration of war|declare war]]. During the war, Wilson focused on diplomacy and financial considerations, leaving the waging of the war itself primarily in the hands of the Army. On the home front in 1917, he began the United States' first [[Military draft|draft]] since the [[American Civil War]], borrowed billions of dollars in war funding through the newly established [[Federal Reserve Bank]] and [[Liberty Bonds]], set up the [[War Industries Board]], promoted [[Labor history of the United States|labor union]] cooperation, supervised agriculture and food production through the [[Food and Fuel Control Act|Lever Act]], took over control of the railroads,  and suppressed [[anti-war movement]]s. During his term in office, Wilson gave a well-known Flag Day speech that fueled the wave of [[German American#World War I anti-German sentiment|anti-German sentiment]] sweeping the country in 1917–18.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick C. Luebke, ''Bonds of Loyalty: German Americans and World War I'' (DeKalb, Ill.: Northern Illinois University Press, 1974), 234–235.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late stages of the war, Wilson took personal control of negotiations with Germany, including the [[Armistice with Germany (Compiègne)|armistice]]. In 1918, he issued his ''[[Fourteen Points]]'', his view of a post-war world that could avoid another terrible conflict. In 1919, he went to Paris to create the [[League of Nations]] and shape the [[Treaty of Versailles]], with special attention on creating new nations out of defunct empires. In 1919, Wilson engaged in an intense fight with [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] and the Republican-controlled Senate over giving the League of Nations power to force the U.S. into a war. Wilson collapsed with a debilitating stroke that left his wife in control until he left office in March 1921. The Senate rejected the Treaty of Versailles, the U.S. never joined the League, and the Republicans won [[United States presidential election, 1920|a landslide in 1920]] by denouncing Wilson's policies. 

An intellectual with very high writing standards, Wilson was a highly effective partisan campaigner as well as legislative strategist. A Presbyterian of deep religious faith, Wilson appealed to a gospel of service and infused a profound sense of moralism into his idealistic [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]], now referred to as &quot;[[Wilsonian]]&quot;. Wilsonianism calls for the United States to enter the world arena to fight for democracy, and has been a contentious position in [[Foreign policy of the United States|American foreign policy]].&lt;ref&gt;John Morton Blum, ''Woodrow Wilson and the Politics of Morality'' (1956); Richard M. Gamble, &quot;Savior Nation: Woodrow Wilson and the Gospel of Service&quot;, ''Humanitas'' Volume: 14. Issue: 1. 2001. pp 4+; Cooper, ''Woodrow Wilson'' (2009) p 560.&lt;/ref&gt; For his sponsorship of the League of Nations, Wilson was awarded the 1919 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nobelprize1919&quot;&gt;[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1919/index.html Woodrow Wilson bio sketch] from NobelFoundation.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Wilson was born in [[Staunton, Virginia]] on December 28, 1856 as the third of four children of [[Joseph Ruggles Wilson]] (1822–1903) and Jessie Janet Woodrow (1826–1888).&lt;ref&gt;John Milton Cooper, ''Woodrow Wilson: A Biography'' (2009) pp 13–19&lt;/ref&gt; His ancestry was Scottish and [[Ulster Scots people|Scots-Irish]]. His paternal grandparents immigrated to the United States from [[Strabane]], [[County Tyrone]], Ireland (now [[Northern Ireland]]), in 1807. His mother was born in [[Carlisle, Cumbria|Carlisle]], [[Cumberland]], England, the daughter of Rev. Dr. Thomas Woodrow, born in [[Paisley]], Scotland and Marion Williamson from [[Glasgow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/igm.cgi?op=AHN&amp;db=woodrow_wilson&amp;id=I0001 |title=Genealogy of President Woodrow Wilson |publisher=Wc.rootsweb.ancestry.com |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandparents' whitewashed house has become a tourist attraction in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref name=GeographiaTyrone&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Woodrow Wilson cabinet card 1876-86.jpg|thumb|Wilson c. 1880s]]
Wilson's father was originally from [[Steubenville, Ohio]], where his grandfather published a newspaper, ''The Western Herald and Gazette'', which was [[tariff|pro-tariff]] and [[abolitionist|anti-slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Walworth|1958}} p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson's parents moved south in 1851 and identified with the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]]. His father defended slavery, owned slaves and set up a Sunday school for them. They cared for wounded soldiers at their church. The father also briefly served as a chaplain to the [[Confederate Army]].&lt;ref name=PresidentialAvenue&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidentialavenue.com/ww.cfm
|title=Woodrow Wilson – 28th President, 1913–1921
|publisher=PresidentialAvenue.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodrow Wilson's earliest memory, from the age of three, was of hearing that [[Abraham Lincoln]] had been elected and that a war was coming. Wilson would forever recall standing for a moment at [[Robert E. Lee]]'s side and looking up into his face.&lt;ref name=PresidentialAvenue/&gt;

Wilson's father was one of the founders of the Southern [[Presbyterian Church in the United States]] (PCUS) after it split from the northern Presbyterians in 1861. Joseph R. Wilson served as the first permanent clerk of the southern church's General Assembly, was Stated Clerk from 1865 to 1898 and was Moderator of the PCUS General Assembly in 1879. Wilson spent the majority of his childhood, up to age 14, in [[Augusta, Georgia]], where his father was minister of the First Presbyterian Church.&lt;ref name=White_Ch2&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=pXYqVxLyRrwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Woodrow+Wilson:+The+Man,+His+Times+and+His+Task#PPA28,M1

Wilson was over ten years of age before he learned to read. His difficulty reading may have indicated [[dyslexia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wilson: A Portrait |publisher=American Experience, PBS Television |year=2001 |accessdate=January 19, 2009 |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/wilson/portrait/wp_wilson.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as a teenager he taught himself [[shorthand]] to compensate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Woodrow Wilson, Episode One: He Was a Quiet Man (transcript) |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/wilson/filmmore/fm_trans1.html |publisher=American Experience, PBS Television |year=2001 |accessdate=January 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was able to achieve academically through determination and self-discipline. He studied at home under his father's guidance and took classes in a small school in Augusta.&lt;ref&gt;Link ''Road to the White House'' pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;
During [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], Wilson lived in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], the state capital, from 1870 to 1874, where his father was professor at the [[Columbia Theological Seminary]].&lt;ref&gt;Walworth ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson attended [[Davidson College]] in North Carolina for the 1873–1874 school year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Woodrow Wilson|url=http://sites.davidson.edu/archives/encyclopedia/woodrow-wilson/|publisher=[[Davidson College]]|accessdate=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After medical ailments kept him from returning for a second year, he transferred to [[Princeton University|Princeton]] as a freshman when his father took a teaching position at the university. Graduating in 1879, Wilson became a member of [[Phi Kappa Psi]] fraternity. Beginning in his second year, he read widely in political philosophy and history. Wilson credited the British parliamentary sketch-writer [[Henry Lucy]] as his inspiration to enter public life. He was active in the undergraduate [[American Whig-Cliosophic Society]] literary and debating society, serving as speaker of the Whig Party and writing for the [[Nassau Literary Review]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theprince.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/cgi-bin/princetonperiodicals?a=d&amp;d=Princetonian19670615-01.2.81&amp;srpos=2&amp;e=-------en-20--1--txt-IN-ellsworth+%22debate%22----# |title=Princeton Periodicals — Daily Princetonian Special Class of 1971, Volume 91, Number 72, Issue 15 June 1967 |publisher=Theprince.princeton.edu |date=1967-06-15 |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized a separate Liberal Debating Society,&lt;ref&gt;Link, ''Wilson'' I:5–6; Wilson Papers I: 130, 245, 314&lt;/ref&gt; and later coached the Whig-Clio [[Princeton Debate Panel|Debate Panel]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00335633009360910&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theprince.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/cgi-bin/princetonperiodicals?a=d&amp;d=Princetonian18951205-01.2.5&amp;srpos=17&amp;e=-------en-20--1-byDA-txt-IN----- |title=Princeton Periodicals — Daily Princetonian 5 December 1895 |publisher=Theprince.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, Wilson attended law school at the [[University of Virginia School of Law|University of Virginia]] for one year. Although he never graduated, during his time at the university he was heavily involved in the [[Virginia Glee Club]] and the [[Jefferson Literary and Debating Society]], serving as the society's president.&lt;ref name=&quot;worldswork&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The World's Work: A History of our Time, Volume IV: November 1911 – April 1912|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|year=1912|pages=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; His frail health dictated withdrawal, and he went home to [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]], North Carolina where he continued his studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cranston|1945}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1882, Wilson started a law practice in [[Atlanta]]. One of his [[University of Virginia]] classmates, Edward Ireland Renick, invited him to join his new law practice as partner and Wilson joined him in May 1882. He passed the Georgia Bar. On October 19, 1882, he appeared in court before Judge [[George Hillyer]] to take his examination for the bar, which he passed easily. Competition was fierce in the city with 143 other lawyers, and he found few cases to keep him occupied.&lt;ref name=Mulder1978_pp71-72&gt;{{cite book|author=Mulder, John H. |title=Woodrow Wilson: The Years of Preparation|publisher=Princeton |year=1978|pages=71–72}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he found staying current with the law obstructed his plans to study government to achieve his long-term plans for a political career. In April 1883, Wilson applied to the [[Johns Hopkins University]] to study for a doctorate in history and political science and began his studies there in the fall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mulder1978_pp71-72&quot;/&gt;

==Personal life==
Wilson's mother was possibly a [[hypochondriac]] and Wilson himself seemed to think that he was often in poorer health than he really was. He suffered from [[hypertension]] at a relatively early age and may have suffered his first stroke when he was 39.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodrowwilsonhouse.org/index.asp?section=timeline&amp;file=timelinesearch_day&amp;id=302 |title=Health of Woodrow Wilson |publisher=Woodrowwilsonhouse.org |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885, he married [[Ellen Axson Wilson|Ellen Louise Axson]], the daughter of a minister from [[Savannah, Georgia]] during a visit to her relatives in [[Rome, Georgia]]. They had three daughters: [[Margaret Woodrow Wilson]] (1886–1944); [[Jessie Wilson]] (1887–1933); and [[Eleanor R. Wilson]] (1889–1967).&lt;ref&gt;Cooper (2009) pp. 57–62&lt;/ref&gt; Axson died in 1914, and in 1915 Wilson married [[Edith Galt]], a direct descendant of the Native American woman [[Pocahontas]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper (2009) p 281&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson is one of only three presidents to be widowed while in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Presidents' Wives: Reassessing the Office of First Lady |last=Watson |first=Robert P. |publisher= Lynne Rienner Publishers |year=2000 |isbn=1-55587-948-9 |page=261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:wilsonspiercearrow.jpg|thumb|left|Wilson's Pierce Arrow, which is on display in his hometown of Staunton, Virginia.]]
Wilson was an early automobile enthusiast, and he took daily rides while he was President. His favorite car was a 1919 [[Pierce-Arrow]], in which he preferred to ride with the top down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.woodrowwilson.org/visit_sub/visit_sub_show.htm?doc_id=321148 &quot;The Pierce Arrow Limousine&quot;], Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library&lt;/ref&gt; His enjoyment of motoring made him an advocate of funding for public [[National Highway System (United States)|highways]].&lt;ref&gt;Weingroff, Richard F., [http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/infrastructure/rw96b.htm#6 &quot;President Woodrow Wilson – Motorist Extraordinaire&quot;], Federal Highway Administration&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson was an avid baseball fan. In 1915, he became the first sitting president to attend a [[World Series]] game. Wilson had been a [[center fielder]] during his Davidson College days. When he transferred to Princeton he was unable to make the varsity team and so became the team's assistant manager. He was the first President to throw out a first ball at a World Series game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/statitudes/news/2002/10/16/worldseries_btn/ &quot;By the Numbers&quot; – 1915], ''[[CNNSI]]'', October 17, 2002. Retrieved February 27, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

He cycled regularly, including several cycling vacations in the English [[Lake District]].&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Andrew (1996), ''A President's Love Affair with the Lake District: Woodrow Wilson's 'Second Home'', Lakeland Press Agency&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to cycle around Washington, D.C. as President, Wilson took to playing golf, although he played with more enthusiasm than skill.&lt;ref name=&quot;president golf&quot;&gt;Van Natta, Don Jr. (2003), ''First Off the Tee: Presidential Hackers, Duffers, and Cheaters from Taft to Bush'' PublicAffairs&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson holds the record of all the presidents for the most rounds of golf,&lt;ref name=&quot;president golf&quot;/&gt; over 1,000, or almost one every other day. During the winter, the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] would paint golf balls with black paint so Wilson could hit them around in the snow on the [[White House]] lawn.&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Edwin A. (1981), ''Woodrow Wilson: A Medical and Psychological Biography'', Princeton&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Wilson began his graduate studies at [[Johns Hopkins University]] in 1883 and three years later completed his doctoral dissertation, &quot;Congressional Government: A Study in American Politics&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Internet Archive: [http://www.archive.org/details/congressionalgov00wilsa &quot;Congressional government : a study in American politics (1885)&quot;], accessed January 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and received a PhD in history and political science. For his doctorate, Wilson had to [[List of Presidents of the United States by languages spoken|learn German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pestritto|first=Ronald|title=Woodrow Wilson and the Roots of Modern Liberalism|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|location=Lanham, Maryland|year=2005|isbn=0-7425-1517-6|url=http://books.google.com/?id=B_5xhT1CvXAC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=Woodrow+Wilson+German+language&amp;q=|accessdate=March 22, 2010|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the academic year 1886–1887, Wilson was a visiting lecturer at [[Cornell University]], but failed to gain a permanent position. However, he was tapped into the [[The Irving Literary Society (Cornell University)|Irving Literary Society]] by the brothers of his fraternity, [[Phi Kappa Psi]]. He joined the faculty of [[Bryn Mawr College]] (1885–88) and then [[Wesleyan University]] (1888–90),&lt;ref name=PrincetonCompanion1978_Link_PhDquote&gt;{{cite book|accessdate=October 29, 2008

}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he also coached the [[American football|football]] team and founded the debate team – still called the T. Woodrow Wilson debate team. 

In 1890, Wilson joined the [[Princeton University|Princeton]] faculty as professor of [[jurisprudence]] and [[political economy]]. While there, he was one of the faculty members of the short-lived coordinate college, [[Evelyn College for Women]]. Additionally, Wilson became the first lecturer of Constitutional Law at [[New York Law School]] where he taught with [[Charles Evans Hughes]].&lt;ref&gt;Walworth, v. 1; Link (1947)&lt;/ref&gt; Representing the [[American Whig-Cliosophic Society|American Whig Society]], Wilson delivered an oration at Princeton's sesquicentennial celebration (1896) entitled &quot;Princeton in the Nation's Service&quot;. This phrase became the motto of the University, later expanded to &quot;Princeton in the Nation's Service and in the Service of All Nations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeton.edu/~compub/pwb/98/0622/speech.html &quot;Beyond FitzRandolph Gates&quot;], ''Princeton Weekly Bulletin'' June 22, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theprince.princeton.edu/princetonperiodicals/cgi-bin/princetonperiodicals?a=d&amp;d=Princetonian18961022-02.2.2&amp;srpos=8&amp;e=-------en-20--1-byDA-txt-IN- |title=Princeton Periodicals — Alumni Princetonian 22 October 1896 |publisher=Theprince.princeton.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this speech, he outlined his vision of the university in a democratic nation, calling on institutions of higher learning &quot;to illuminate duty by every lesson that can be drawn out of the past&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infoshare1.princeton.edu/libraries/firestone/rbsc/mudd/online_ex/wilsonline/indn8nsvc.html |title=&quot;Princeton in the Nation's Service&quot; Commemorative Address delivered October&amp;nbsp;21, 1896 |publisher=Infoshare1.princeton.edu |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson was annoyed that Princeton was not living up to its potential, complaining &quot;There's a little college down in Kentucky which in 60 years has graduated more men who have acquired prominence and fame than has Princeton in her 150 years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The college he was referring to was [[Centre College]]. Link (1947)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings on government and politics==

===Government systems===
Under the influence of [[Walter Bagehot]]'s ''The English Constitution'', Wilson saw the [[United States Constitution]] as pre-modern, cumbersome, and open to corruption. An admirer of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]], Wilson favored a [[parliamentary system]] for the United States. Writing in the early 1880s:&lt;ref&gt;''The Politics of Woodrow Wilson'', 41–48&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{quote|I ask you to put this question to yourselves, should we not draw the Executive and Legislature closer together? Should we not, on the one hand, give the individual leaders of opinion in Congress a better chance to have an intimate party in determining who should be president, and the president, on the other hand, a better chance to approve himself a statesman, and his advisers capable men of affairs, in the guidance of Congress}}

Wilson started ''Congressional Government'', his best-known political work, as an argument for a parliamentary system, but he was impressed by [[Grover Cleveland]], and ''Congressional Government'' emerged as a critical description of America's system, with frequent negative comparisons to [[Westminster system|Westminster]]. He said, &quot;I am pointing out facts—diagnosing, not prescribing remedies.&quot;&lt;ref name=PhD_p205&gt;Wilson ''Congressional Government'' 1885, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;and see [[Walter Lippmann]]'s Introduction to the 1956 reprint of ''Congressional Government'' on Wilson's omission of Cabinet Government on the British model due to the emergence of Cleveland.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson believed that America's intricate system of [[checks and balances]] was the cause of the problems in American governance. He said that the divided power made it impossible for voters to see who was accountable. If government behaved badly, Wilson asked:&lt;ref name=PhD_pp186-187&gt;Wilson ''Congressional Government'' 1885, pp. 186–187.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|How is the schoolmaster, the nation, to know which boy needs the whipping? ... Power and strict accountability for its use are the essential constituents of good government... It is, therefore, manifestly a radical defect in our federal system that it parcels out power and confuses responsibility as it does. The main purpose of the Convention of 1787 seems to have been to accomplish this grievous mistake. The &quot;literary theory&quot; of checks and balances is simply a consistent account of what our Constitution makers tried to do; and those checks and balances have proved mischievous just to the extent which they have succeeded in establishing themselves.}}

Wilson singled out the [[United States House of Representatives]] for particular criticism:&lt;ref name=PhD_p76&gt;Wilson ''Congressional Government'' 1885, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|... divided up, as it were, into forty-seven seignories, in each of which a Standing Committee is the court-baron and its chairman lord-proprietor. These petty barons, some of them not a little powerful, but none of them within reach [of] the full powers of rule, may at will exercise an almost despotic sway within their own shires, and may sometimes threaten to convulse even the realm itself.}}

Wilson said that the Congressional committee system was fundamentally undemocratic in that committee chairs, who ruled by seniority, determined national policy although they were responsible to no one except their constituents; and that it facilitated corruption.&lt;ref name=PhD_p132&gt;Wilson ''Congressional Government'' 1885, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[William Jennings Bryan]] captured the Democratic nomination from Cleveland's supporters in 1896, Wilson refused to support the ticket. Instead, he cast his ballot for [[John M. Palmer (politician)|John M. Palmer]], the presidential candidate of the [[National Democratic Party (United States)|National Democratic Party]], or Gold Democrats, a short-lived party that supported a gold standard, low tariffs, and limited government.&lt;ref&gt;David T. Beito and Linda Royster Beito, [http://www.independent.org/publications/tir/article.asp?issueID=22&amp;articleID=261 &quot;Gold Democrats and the Decline of Classical Liberalism, 1896–1900&quot;], Independent Review 4 (Spring 2000), 555–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his last scholarly work in 1908, ''Constitutional Government of the United States'', Wilson said that the presidency &quot;will be as big as and as influential as the man who occupies it&quot;. By the time of his presidency, Wilson hoped that Presidents could be party leaders in the same way British prime ministers were. Wilson also hoped that the parties could be reorganized along ideological, not geographic, lines. He wrote, &quot;Eight words contain the sum of the present degradation of our political parties: No leaders, no principles; no principles, no parties.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Frozen Republic'', 145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public administration===
Wilson also studied public administration, which he called &quot;government in action; it is the executive, the operative, the most visible side of government, and is of course as old as government itself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 3&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that by studying public administration governmental efficiency could be increased.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Study of Administration&quot; in ''Political Science Quarterly'', June 1887&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wilson was concerned with the implementation of government. He faulted political leaders who focused on philosophical issues and the nature of government and dismissed the critical issues of government administration as mere &quot;practical detail&quot;. He thought such attitudes represented the requirements of smaller countries and populations. By his day, he thought, &quot;it is getting to be harder to run a constitution than to frame one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 4&lt;/ref&gt; He thought it time &quot;to straighten the paths of government, to make its business less unbusinesslike, to strengthen and purify its organization, and it to crown its dutifulness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 5&lt;/ref&gt; He complained that studies of administration drew principally on the history of Continental Europe and an American equivalent was required. He summarized the growth of such foreign states as Prussia, France, and England, highlighting the events that led to advances in administration.

By contrast, he thought the United States required greater compromise because of the diversity of public opinion and the difficulty of forming a majority opinion. Thus practical reform to the government is necessarily slow. Yet Wilson insisted that &quot;administration lies outside the proper sphere of politics&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 10&lt;/ref&gt; and that &quot;general laws which direct these things to be done are as obviously outside of and above administration.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 11&lt;/ref&gt; He likens administration to a machine that functions independent of the changing mood of its leaders. Such a line of demarcation is intended to focus responsibility for actions taken on the people or persons in charge. As Wilson put it, &quot;public attention must be easily directed, in each case of good or bad administration, to just the man deserving of praise or blame. There is no danger in power, if only it be not irresponsible. If it be divided, dealt out in share to many, it is obscured...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, 12&lt;/ref&gt; Essentially, the items under the discretion of administration must be limited in scope, as to not block, nullify, obfuscate, or modify the implementation of governmental decree made by the executive branch.

==President of Princeton University==
[[File:Pu-prospect-house.JPG|thumb|Prospect House, located in the center of [[Princeton University|Princeton's]] campus, was Wilson's home during his term as president of the university.]]
The trustees promoted Professor Wilson to president of Princeton in 1902, replacing [[Francis Landey Patton]], whom the Trustees perceived to be an inefficient administrator. Although the school's endowment was barely $4&amp;nbsp;million, Wilson sought $2&amp;nbsp;million for a preceptorial system of teaching, $1&amp;nbsp;million for a school of science, and nearly $3&amp;nbsp;million for new buildings and salary increases. As a long-term objective, Wilson sought $3&amp;nbsp;million for a graduate school and $2.5&amp;nbsp;million for schools of jurisprudence and [[electrical engineering]], as well as a museum of natural history.&lt;ref&gt;Walworth v. 1&lt;/ref&gt; He was also able to increase the faculty from 112 to 174, most of whom he selected himself on the basis of their records as outstanding teachers. The curriculum guidelines he developed proved important progressive innovations in the field of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Walworth v. 1; Bragdon, ''Woodrow Wilson: The Academic Years'' (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

To emphasize the development of expertise, Wilson instituted academic departments and a system of core requirements where students met in groups of six with preceptors, followed by two years of concentration in a selected major. He tried to raise admission standards and to replace the &quot;gentleman's C&quot; with serious study. Wilson aspired, as he told alumni, &quot;to transform thoughtless boys performing tasks into thinking men&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bragdon, ''Woodrow Wilson: The Academic Years''; Walworth v. 1; Link (1947)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906–10, he attempted to curtail the influence of social elites by abolishing the upper-class [[eating club]]s and moving the students into colleges, also known as quadrangles. Wilson's Quad Plan was met with fierce opposition from Princeton's alumni, most importantly [[Moses Taylor Pyne]], the most powerful of Princeton's Trustees. Wilson held his position, saying that giving in &quot;would be to temporize with evil&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Walworth 1:109&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1907, due to the intensity of alumni opposition, the Board of Trustees withdrew its support for the Quad Plan and instructed Wilson to withdraw it.&lt;ref&gt;Bragdon, ''Woodrow Wilson: The Academic Years'', 326–327.&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in his tenure, Wilson confronted Andrew Fleming West, Dean of the graduate school, and West's ally former President [[Grover Cleveland]] who was a trustee. Wilson wanted to integrate the proposed graduate building into the same area with the undergraduate colleges. West wanted them to remain separate. The trustees rejected Wilson's plan for colleges in 1908, and then endorsed West's alternative in 1909. The national press covered the confrontation as a battle of the [[elites]] represented by West versus democracy represented by Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;Around 1910 Wilson engaged in long meetings in Bermuda with socialite Mary Hulbert Peck. Historians are unsure whether there was an affair. There is no evidence but Wilson did send very personal letters, and ugly rumors were circulated by his political enemies in 1912. Cooper (2009) pp. 99–101.&lt;/ref&gt; It was this confrontation that led to his decision to leave Princeton for politics. He later commented that politics was less brutal than university administration.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, John Milton. &quot;Woodrow Wilson: A Biography&quot;. p107&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson was elected president of the [[American Political Science Association]] in 1910, but soon decided to leave his Princeton post and enter New Jersey [[Politics of New Jersey|state politics]].&lt;ref&gt;Walworth, v 1 ch 6, 7, 8&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian John Cooper, Wilson's tenure set Princeton on the path to become one of America's great universities.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, John Milton. &quot;Woodrow Wilson: A Biography&quot;. p119&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governor of New Jersey==
In 1910 Wilson ran for [[Governor of New Jersey]] against the Republican candidate [[Vivian M. Lewis]], the State Commissioner of Banking and Insurance. Wilson's campaign focused on his independence from machine politics, and he promised that if elected he would not be beholden to party bosses. Wilson soundly defeated Lewis in the general election by a margin of more than 49,000 votes, although Republican [[William Howard Taft]] had carried New Jersey in the [[United States presidential election, 1908|1908 presidential election]] by more than 80,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njstatelib.org/NJ_Information/Digital_Collections/Governors_of_New_Jersey/GWILS.pdf Biography of Woodrow Wilson (PDF)], [[New Jersey State Library]].&lt;/ref&gt; Historian and [[Teddy Roosevelt]] biographer [[Edmund Morris (writer)|Edmund Morris]] called Wilson in the Governor's race a &quot;dark horse&quot; and attributed his and others' success against the Taft Republicans in 1910 in part to the emergent national [[Progressivism|progressive]] message enunciated by Roosevelt in his post-presidency.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Edmund, [http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/01/opinion/01morris.html?_r=1&amp;hp &quot;The Tea Party Last Time], [[Op-ed]], ''The New York Times'', October 31, 2010 (November 1, 2010 p. A33 NY ed.). Retrieved November 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1910 election the Democrats also took control of the [[New Jersey General Assembly|General Assembly]]. The [[New Jersey Senate|State Senate]], however, remained in Republican control by a slim margin. After taking office, Wilson set in place his reformist agenda, ignoring the demands of party machinery. While governor, in a period spanning six months, Wilson established state primaries. This all but took the party bosses out of the presidential election process in the state. He also revamped the public utility commission, and introduced [[worker's compensation]].&lt;ref&gt;Shenkman, Richard. p. 275. ''Presidential Ambition''. New York, New York. Harper Collins Publishing, 1999. First Edition. 0-06-018373-X&lt;/ref&gt;

==Election of 1912==
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1912}}
Wilson's popularity as governor and his status in the national media gave impetus to his presidential campaign in 1912. He chose Indiana Governor [[Thomas R. Marshall]] as his running mate&lt;ref&gt;Cooper (2009), 163–68&lt;/ref&gt; and selected [[William F. McCombs|William Frank McCombs]], a New York lawyer and a friend from college days, to manage his campaign. Much of Wilson's support came from the South, especially from young progressives in that region, especially intellectuals, editors and lawyers. Wilson managed to maneuver through the complexities of local politics. For example, in Tennessee the Democratic Party was divided on the issue of prohibition. Wilson was progressive and sober, but not a dry, and appealed to both sides. They united behind him to win the presidential election in the state, but divided over state politics and lost the gubernatorial election.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur S. Link, &quot;Democratic Politics and the Presidential Campaign of 1912 in Tennessee&quot;, ''East Tennessee Historical Society's Publications'' 1979 51: 114–137&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention deadlocked for more than 40 ballots as no candidate could reach the two-thirds vote required to win the nomination. A leading contender was House Speaker [[Champ Clark]], a prominent progressive strongest in the border states. Other contenders were Governor [[Judson Harmon]] of Ohio, and Representative [[Oscar Underwood]] of Alabama. They lacked Wilson's charisma and dynamism. Publisher [[William Randolph Hearst]], a leader of the left wing of the party, supported Clark. [[William Jennings Bryan]], the nominee in 1896, 1900 and 1908, played a critical role in opposition to any candidate who had the support of &quot;the financiers of Wall Street&quot;. He finally announced for Wilson, who won on the 46th ballot.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur S. Link, &quot;The Baltimore Convention of 1912&quot;, ''American Historical Review'' 1945 50(4): 691–713 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/1842698 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the campaign Wilson promoted the &quot;New Freedom&quot;, emphasizing limited federal government and opposition to monopoly powers, often after consultation with his chief advisor [[Louis D. Brandeis]]. In the contest for the Republican nomination, President [[William Howard Taft]] defeated former president [[Theodore Roosevelt]], who then ran as a [[Bull Moose Party]] candidate, which assisted in Wilson's success in the electoral college. Wilson took 41.8% of the popular vote and won 435 electoral votes from 40 states.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis L. Gould, ''Four Hats in the Ring: The 1912 Election and the Birth of Modern American Politics'' (2008), p. ??&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear if Roosevelt cost fellow Republican Taft, or fellow progressive Wilson more support.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, John Milton. &quot;Woodrow Wilson: A Biography&quot;. p187&lt;/ref&gt;

==Presidency, 1913–1921==

===First term, 1913–1917===
[[File:WilsonFirstInauguration.jpg|left|thumb|Woodrow Wilson sworn in as the 28th President of the United States March 4, 1913]]
Wilson was the first Southerner in the White House since 1869 and worked closely with Southern leaders. Since 1856 he and [[Grover Cleveland]] were the only Democrats elected president, so he felt a need to appoint Democrats to all federal positions.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur S. Link, &quot;Woodrow Wilson: The American as Southerner&quot;, ''Journal of Southern History,'' Vol. 36, No. 1 (1970), pp. 3–17 [http://www.jstor.org/stable/2206599 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;   

[[File:Woodrow Wilson addressing Congress (LOC).jpg|thumb|Wilson addressing the U.S. Congress, April 8, 1913]]
In resolving economic policy issues, he had to manage the conflict between two wings of his party, the agrarian wing led by Bryan and the pro-business wing. With large Democratic majorities in Congress and a healthy economy, he promptly seized the opportunity to implement his agenda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Link 1972&quot;&gt;Link (1972)&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson experienced early success by implementing his &quot;[[The New Freedom|New Freedom]]&quot; pledges of [[antitrust]] modification, tariff revision, and reform in banking and currency matters.&lt;ref&gt;Clements, ''Presidency'' ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He held the first modern presidential press conference, on March 15, 1913, in which reporters were allowed to ask him questions.&lt;ref name=&quot;american chronicle&quot;&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/6883 |publisher=American Chronicle|date=March 15, 2006 |title=Happy Anniversary to the first scheduled presidential press conference – 93 years young! |first=Robert |last=Rouse}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913 he also became the first president to deliver the [[State of the Union address]] in person since 1801 when [[Thomas Jefferson]] discontinued this practice.   

Wilson's first wife [[Ellen Axson Wilson|Ellen]] died on August 6, 1914, casting him into a deep [[clinical depression|depression]]. In 1915, he met Edith Galt. They married later that year on December 18.

====Federal Reserve 1913====
Wilson secured passage of the [[Federal Reserve Act]] in late 1913. Wilson had tried to find a middle ground between conservative Republicans, led by Senator [[Nelson W. Aldrich]], and the powerful left wing of the Democratic party, led by [[William Jennings Bryan]], who strenuously denounced private banks and [[Wall Street]]. The latter group wanted a government-owned [[central bank]] that could print paper money as Congress required. The compromise, based on the Aldrich Plan but sponsored by Democratic Congressmen [[Carter Glass]] and [[Robert L. Owen|Robert Owen]], allowed the private banks to control the 12 regional [[Federal Reserve Bank]]s, but appeased the agrarians by placing controlling interest in the System in a central board appointed by the president with Senate approval. Moreover, Wilson convinced Bryan's supporters that because Federal Reserve notes were obligations of the government, the plan met their demands for an elastic currency. Having 12 regional banks was meant to weaken the influence of the powerful New York banks, a key demand of Bryan's allies in the South and West. This decentralization was a key factor in winning Glass' support.&lt;ref&gt;Link (1954) pp 43–53&lt;/ref&gt;  The final plan passed in December 1913. Some bankers felt it gave too much control to Washington, and some reformers felt it allowed bankers to maintain too much power. Several Congressmen claimed that New York bankers feigned their disapproval.&lt;ref&gt;Clements, ''Presidency'', pp. 40–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson named [[Paul Warburg]] and other prominent bankers to direct the new system. While power was supposed to be decentralized, the New York branch dominated the Fed as the &quot;first among equals&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jecreport&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.house.gov/jec/fed/fed/fed-impt.htm|title= The Importance of the Federal Reserve |author= Keleher, Robert|date=1997-03|work= Joint Economic Committee |publisher= U.S. House of Representatives}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new system began operations in 1915 and played a major role in financing the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] and American war effort.&lt;ref&gt;Link, ''Wilson: The New Freedom'' (1956) pp. 199–240&lt;/ref&gt; The strengthening of the Federal Reserve was later a major accomplishment of the [[New Deal]].&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, John Milton. &quot;Woodrow Wilson: A Biography&quot;. p195&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economic legislation====
The Democrats lowered tariffs with the [[Revenue Act of 1913|Underwood Tariff]] in 1913, though its effects were soon overwhelmed by the changes in trade caused by World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur S. Link, '&quot;Wilson: The New Freedom'' (1956) pp 177–98&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson proved especially effective in mobilizing public opinion behind tariff changes by denouncing corporate lobbyists, addressing Congress in person in highly dramatic fashion, and staging an elaborate ceremony when he signed the bill into law.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent W. Howard, &quot;Woodrow Wilson, The Press, and Presidential Leadership: Another Look at the Passage of the Underwood Tariff, 1913,&quot; ''CR: The Centennial Review,'' 1980, Vol. 24 Issue 2, pp 167–184&lt;/ref&gt; The revenue lost by a lower tariff was replaced by a new federal income tax, authorized by the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|16th Amendment]]. He managed to bring all sides together on the issues of money and banking by the creation in 1913 of the [[Federal Reserve System]], a complex business-government partnership that to this day dominates the financial world.&lt;ref&gt;Link, '&quot;Wilson: The New Freedom'' pp 199–240&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson helped end the long battles over the trusts with the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]] of 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Link, '&quot;Wilson: The New Freedom'' pp 417–44&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reaching out to new constituencies, a series of programs were targeted at farmers. The [[Smith–Lever Act of 1914]] created the modern system of agricultural extension agents sponsored by the state agricultural colleges. The agents taught new techniques to farmers. The 1916 [[Federal Farm Loan Act]] provided for issuance of low-cost long-term mortgages to farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Clements, ''Presidency'', ch 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Child labor]] was curtailed by the [[Keating–Owen Act]] of 1916, but the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] declared it unconstitutional in 1918. No major child labor prohibition would take effect until the 1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2002&quot;&gt;H.D. Hindman ''Child labor: an American history'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The railroad brotherhoods threatened in summer 1916 to shut down the national transportation system. Wilson tried to bring labor and management together, but when management refused, he had Congress pass the [[Adamson Act]] in September 1916, which avoided the strike by imposing an 8-hour workday in the industry (at the same pay as before). It helped Wilson gain union support for his reelection; the act was approved by the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated550&quot;/&gt; Much of this agenda would later serve as an example or a basis of support for the New Deal.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated201&quot;/&gt; 

[[File:Pump1913.jpg|thumb|Wilson uses tariff, currency and anti-trust laws to prime the pump and get the economy working in a 1913 political cartoon]]

====Antitrust====
Wilson broke with the big lawsuit tradition of his predecessors Taft and Roosevelt as [[trust-busting|Trustbusters]], finding a new approach to encouraging competition through the [[Federal Trade Commission]], which stopped perceived unfair trade practices. In addition, he pushed through Congress the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]] making certain business practices illegal (such as [[price discrimination]], agreements prohibiting retailers from handling other companies' products, and directorates and agreements to control other companies). The power of this legislation was greater than previous [[anti-trust]] laws, because individual officers of corporations could be held responsible if their companies violated the laws. More importantly, the new laws set out clear guidelines that corporations could follow, a dramatic improvement over the previous uncertainties. This law was considered the &quot;[[Magna Carta]]&quot; of labor by [[Samuel Gompers]] because it ended union liability antitrust laws. In 1916, under threat of a national railroad strike, he approved legislation that increased wages and cut working hours of railroad employees; there was no strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Carlos D. |last=Ramírez |first2=Christian |last2=Eigen-Zucchi |title=Understanding the Clayton Act of 1914: An Analysis of the Interest Group Hypothesis |journal=Public Choice |volume=106 |issue=1–2 |year=2001 |pages=157–181 |doi=10.1023/A:1005201409149 |ref=harv |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====War policy – World War I====
{{main|American entry into World War I}}
Wilson spent 1914 through to the beginning of 1917 trying to keep America out of the [[World War I|war in Europe]]. He offered to be a mediator, but neither the [[Allies]] nor the [[Central Powers]] took his requests seriously. Republicans, led by [[Theodore Roosevelt]], strongly criticized Wilson's refusal to build up the [[U.S. Army]] in anticipation of the threat of war. Wilson won the support of the peace element (especially women and churches) by arguing that an army buildup would provoke war. Secretary of State [[William Jennings Bryan]], whose pacifist recommendations were ignored by Wilson, resigned in 1915.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clements, Presidency ch. 7&quot;&gt;Clements, ''Presidency'', ch. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 18, 1916, Wilson unsuccessfully offered to mediate peace. As a preliminary he asked both sides to state their minimum terms necessary for future security. The [[Central Powers]] replied that victory was certain, and the Allies required the dismemberment of their enemies' empires. No desire for peace or common ground existed, and the offer lapsed.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, ''Woodrow Wilson'' (2009) pp 362–76&lt;/ref&gt;

While German submarines were killing sailors and civilian passengers Wilson demanded that Germany stop, but he kept the U.S. out of the war. [[United Kingdom|Britain]] had declared a blockade of Germany to prevent neutral ships from carrying contraband goods to Germany. Wilson protested some British violation of neutral rights, where no one was killed. His protests were mild, and the British knew America would not see it as a ''[[casus belli]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clements, Presidency ch. 7&quot;/&gt;

===Election of 1916===
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1916}}
Renominated in 1916, Wilson used as a major campaign slogan &quot;He kept us out of war&quot;, referring to his administration's avoiding open conflict with Germany or Mexico while maintaining a firm national policy. Wilson, however, never promised to keep out of war regardless of provocation. In his acceptance speech on September 2, 1916, Wilson pointedly warned Germany that submarine warfare that took American lives would not be tolerated, saying &quot;The nation that violates these essential rights must expect to be checked and called to account by direct challenge and resistance. It at once makes the quarrel in part our own.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=65393 |title=Woodrow Wilson: Speech of Acceptance |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |date=September 2, 1916 |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson narrowly won [[U.S. presidential election, 1916|the election]], defeating Republican candidate [[Charles Evans Hughes]]. As governor of New York from 1907 to 1910, Hughes had a progressive record strikingly similar to Wilson's as governor of New Jersey. Theodore Roosevelt would comment that the only thing different between Hughes and Wilson was a shave. However, Hughes had to try to hold together a coalition of conservative Taft supporters and progressive Roosevelt partisans and so his campaign never seemed to take a definite form. Wilson ran on his record and ignored Hughes, reserving his attacks for Roosevelt. When asked why he did not attack Hughes directly, Wilson told a friend to &quot;Never murder a man who is committing suicide.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/3489 The American Presidency Project] Wilson quote&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was exceptionally close and the outcome was in doubt for several days. The vote came down to several close states. Wilson won California by 3,773 votes out of almost a million votes cast and New Hampshire by 54 votes. Hughes won [[Minnesota]] by 393 votes out of over 358,000. In the final count, Wilson had 277 electoral votes vs. Hughes 254. Wilson was able to win by picking up many votes that had gone to Teddy Roosevelt or [[Eugene V. Debs]] in 1912.&lt;ref&gt;William M.

===Second term, 1917–1921===
{{main|American entry into World War I}}

====Decision for war, 1917====
The U.S. had made a declaration of neutrality in 1914. Wilson warned citizens not to take sides in the war for fear of endangering wider U.S. policy. In his address to Congress in 1914, Wilson stated, &quot;Such divisions amongst us would be fatal to our peace of mind and might seriously stand in the way of the proper performance of our duty as the one great nation at peace, the one people holding itself ready to play a part of impartial mediation and speak the counsels of peace and accommodation, not as a partisan, but as a friend.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/usneutrality.htm &quot;Primary Documents: U.S. Declaration of Neutrality, August 19, 1914&quot;], accessed January 7, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The U.S. maintained neutrality despite increasing pressure placed on Wilson after the sinking of the British passenger liner [[RMS Lusitania]] with American citizens on board. Wilson found it increasingly difficult to maintain U.S. neutrality after Germany, despite its promises in the [[Arabic pledge]] and the [[Sussex pledge]], initiated a program of [[unrestricted submarine warfare]] early in 1917 that threatened U.S. commercial shipping. Following the revelation of the [[Zimmermann Telegram]], Germany's attempt to enlist Mexico as an ally against the U.S., Wilson took America into World War I to make &quot;the world safe for democracy.&quot; The U.S. did not sign a formal alliance with the United Kingdom or France but operated as an &quot;associated&quot; power. The U.S. raised a massive army through [[conscription]] and Wilson gave command to General [[John J. Pershing]], allowing Pershing a free hand as to tactics, strategy and even diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Edward M. Coffman, ''The War to End All Wars'' (1968) ch. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson had decided by then that the war had become a real threat to humanity. Unless the U.S. threw its weight into the war, as he stated in his declaration of war speech on April 2, 1917,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Michael Duffy |url=http://www.firstworldwar.com/source/usawardeclaration.htm |title=Declaration of war speech |publisher=FirstWorldWar.com |date=August 22, 2009 |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; western civilization itself could be destroyed. His statement announcing a &quot;[[The war to end war|war to end war]]&quot; meant that he wanted to build a basis for peace that would prevent future catastrophic wars and needless death and destruction. This provided the basis of Wilson's [[Fourteen Points]], which were intended to resolve territorial disputes, ensure free trade and commerce, and establish a peacemaking organization. Included in these fourteen points was the proposal for the [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Clements, ''Presidency'', ch 7–8&lt;/ref&gt;

====War Message====
[[File:President Woodrow Wilson asking Congress to declare war on Germany, 2 April 1917.jpg|thumb|President Wilson delivering his war message before Congress. April 2, 1917.]]
Woodrow Wilson delivered his ''War Message'' to Congress on the evening of April 2, 1917. Introduced to great applause, he remained intense and almost motionless for the entire speech, only raising one arm as his only bodily movement.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Ray Stannard, ''Woodrow Wilson Life and Letters'' (Garden City, NY, 1937)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson announced that his previous position of &quot;armed neutrality&quot; was no longer tenable now that the Imperial German Government had announced that it would use its submarines to sink any vessel approaching the ports of [[Great Britain]], Ireland or any of the Western Coasts of Europe. He advised Congress to declare that the recent course of action taken by the Imperial German Government constituted an act of war. He proposed that the United States enter the war to &quot;vindicate principles of peace and justice in the life of the world as against selfish and autocratic power&quot;. He also charged that Germany had &quot;filled our unsuspecting communities and even our offices of government with spies and set criminal intrigues everywhere afoot against our national unity of counsel, our peace within and without our industries and our commerce&quot;. Furthermore, the United States had intercepted [[Zimmermann Telegram|a telegram sent to the German ambassador in Mexico City]] that evidenced Germany's attempt to instigate a Mexican attack upon the U.S. The German government, Wilson said, &quot;means to stir up enemies against us at our very doors&quot;.  He then warned that &quot;if there should be disloyalty, it will be dealt with a firm hand of repression.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;COOP&quot;&gt;Cooper, John Milton, ''Reconsidering Woodrow Wilson: Progressivism, Internationalism, War, and Peace'', Baltimore MD: Johns Hopkins University Press, ISBN 978-0-8018-9074-1 (2008), p. 190: Wilson insisted that those who refused to support the nation in time of war surrendered their civil liberties.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilson closed with the statement that the world must be again safe for democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/ww18.htm |title=Woodrow Wilson's War Message |publisher=Mtholyoke.edu |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With 50 Representatives and 6 Senators in opposition, the [[declaration of war by the United States]] against Germany was passed by the Congress on April 4, 1917, and was approved by the President on April 6, 1917.

In a speech to Congress on January 8, 1918, Wilson articulated America's war aims. It was the clearest expression of intention made by any of the belligerent nations. The speech, authored principally by [[Walter Lippmann]], expressed Wilson's progressive domestic policies into comparably idealistic equivalents for the international arena: self-determination, open agreements, international cooperation. Promptly dubbed the ''Fourteen Points'', Wilson attempted to make them the basis for the treaty that would mark the end of the war. They ranged from the most generic principles like the prohibition of secret treaties to such detailed outcomes as the creation of an independent Poland with access to the sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwi.lib.byu.edu/index.php/President_Wilson%27s_Fourteen_Points |title=President Wilson's Fourteen Points |publisher=Wwi.lib.byu.edu |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Home front====
{{main|United States home front during World War I}}
To counter opposition to the war at home, Wilson pushed the [[Espionage Act of 1917]] and the [[Sedition Act of 1918]] through Congress to suppress anti-British, pro-German, or anti-war opinions.&lt;ref name=&quot;COOP&quot;/&gt;  While he welcomed socialists who supported the war, he pushed at the same time to arrest and deport foreign-born radicals.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVR&quot;&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, ISBN 0-691-02604-1, ISBN 978-0-691-02604-6 (1991), pp. 93–94, 124, 127, 130–133&lt;/ref&gt;  Citing the Espionage Act, the U.S. Post Office, following the instructions of the Justice Department, refused to carry any written materials that could be deemed critical of the U.S. war effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVR&quot;/&gt;  Some sixty newspapers judged to have revolutionary or antiwar content were deprived of their second-class mailing rights and effectively banned from the U.S. mails.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Clements, Presidency ch 8&quot;&gt;Clements, ''Presidency'' ch 8&lt;/ref&gt;  Mere criticism of the Wilson administration and its war policy became grounds for arrest and imprisonment.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVR&quot;/&gt;  A Jewish immigrant from Germany, Robert Goldstein, was sentenced to ten years in prison for producing ''[[The Spirit of '76 (1917 film)|The Spirit of '76]]'', a film that portrayed the British, now an ally, in an unfavorable light.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOE&quot;&gt;Loewen, James W., ''Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong'', Touchstone Books (1995), p. 20, 22, 24&lt;/ref&gt;    

Wilson's domestic economic policies were strongly pro-labor, but this favorable treatment was extended only to unions that supported the U.S. war effort, such as the [[American Federation of Labor]] (AFL).&lt;ref name=&quot;LOE&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.history.com/audio/gompers-pledges-labors-support-for-wwi Gompers Pledges Labor's Support for WWI]'', History Channel Online, retrieved July 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Antiwar groups, anarchists, [[Communist Party USA|communists]], [[I.W.W.]] members, and other radical labor movements were regularly targeted by agents of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]; many of their leaders were arrested on grounds of incitement to violence, espionage, or [[sedition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AVR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McElroy, Wendy, ''[http://www.fff.org/freedom/fd0204f.asp World War I and the Suppression of Dissent, Parts 1 and 2]'', Freedom Daily, The Future of Freedom Foundation (April 2002), retrieved July 20, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  By 1918 the ranks of those arrested included [[Eugene Debs]], the mild-mannered Socialist Party leader and labor activist, after he gave a speech opposing the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;AVR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;COOP2&quot;&gt;Cooper, John Milton, ''Reconsidering Woodrow Wilson: Progressivism, Internationalism, War, and Peace'', Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University Press, ISBN 978-0-8018-9074-1 (2008), p. 201, 209&lt;/ref&gt;  Debs' opposition to the Wilson administration and the war earned the undying enmity of President Wilson, who later called Debs a &quot;traitor to his country&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LOE&quot;/&gt;  Many recent foreign immigrants, [[resident aliens]] who opposed America's participation in World War I were eventually deported to Soviet Russia or other nations under the sweeping powers granted in the [[Immigration Act of 1918]], which had actually been drafted by Wilson administration officials at the Department of Justice and the [[Bureau of Immigration]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AVR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;COOP2&quot;/&gt;  Even after the war ended in November 1918, the Wilson administration's attempts to silence radical political opponents continued, culminating in the [[Palmer Raids]], a mass arrest and roundup of some 10,000 anarchists and labor activists led by Wilson's Attorney General, [[A. Mitchell Palmer]].&lt;ref&gt;Norton, Mary Beth, ''A People and a Nation: A History of the United States Since 1865: Vol 2'', Wadsworth Publishing, ISBN 0-618-39177-0, ISBN 978-0-618-39177-6 (2006), p. 681&lt;/ref&gt;  The investigations and prosecutions of antiwar activists by the Department of Justice were heavily criticized by prominent lawyers and law professors of the day, including [[Felix Frankfurter]] and [[Roscoe Pound]].&lt;ref&gt;On May 28, 1920, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) published ''A Report of the Illegal Practices of the United States Department of Justice'' which documented the activities of the Justice Department under Attorney Generals [[Thomas Watt Gregory]] and [[A. Mitchell Palmer]] in arresting suspected radicals, illegal entrapment by agent provocateurs, and unlawful incommunicado detention.  The report was signed by prominent lawyers and law professors, including Felix Frankfurter, Roscoe Pound and [[Ernst Freund]].&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Palmer Raids'' were eventually stymied in June 1920 by Massachusetts District Court Judge [[George Weston Anderson|George Anderson]], who ordered the discharge of 17 arrested aliens and publicly denounced the Department of Justice's actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;MUR&quot;&gt;Murray, Robert K., ''Red Scare: A Study in National Hysteria, 1919–1920'', Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, ISBN 0-8166-5833-1, ISBN 978-0-8166-5833-6 (1955), pp. 250–251&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;POS&quot;&gt;Post, Louis F., ''The Deportations Delirium of Nineteen-twenty: A Personal Narrative of an Historic Official Experience '', New York: C.H.

During the war, Wilson worked closely with [[Samuel Gompers]] and the AFL, the railroad brotherhoods, and other 'moderate' unions, which saw enormous growth in membership and wages during Wilson's administration.  As there was no rationing, consumer prices soared. As income taxes increased, [[white-collar worker]]s suffered.  Despite this, appeals to buy [[war bond]]s were highly successful.  The purchase of wartime bonds had the result of shifting the cost of the war to the affluent 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clements, Presidency ch 8&quot;/&gt;

Wilson set up the first western propaganda office, the United States [[Committee on Public Information]], headed by [[George Creel]] (thus its popular name, ''Creel Commission''), which filled the country with patriotic anti-German appeals and conducted various forms of censorship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.gov/research/guide-fed-records/groups/063.html Records of the Committee on Public Information] from the [[National Archives]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917, Congress authorized ex-President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] to raise four divisions of volunteers to fight in France- [[Roosevelt's World War I volunteers]]; Wilson refused to accept this offer from his political enemy. Other areas of the war effort were incorporated into the government along with propaganda. The [[War Industries Board]] headed by [[Bernard Baruch]] set war goals and policies for American factories. Future President [[Herbert Hoover]] was appointed to head the [[United States Food Administration|Food Administration]] which encouraged Americans to participate in &quot;Meatless Mondays&quot; and &quot;Wheatless Wednesdays&quot; to conserve food for the troops overseas. The [[Federal Fuel Administration]] run by Henry Garfield introduced [[daylight savings time]] and rationed fuel supplies such as coal and oil to keep the U.S. military supplied. These and many other boards and administrations were headed by businessmen recruited by Wilson for a dollar a day salary to make the government more efficient in the war effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clements, Presidency ch 8&quot;/&gt;

In an effort of reform and to shake up his [[World War I]] Mobilization program, President Wilson removed the chief of Army Signal Corps and the Chairman of the Council's Aircraft Production Board on April 18, 1918.&lt;ref&gt;Leuchtenburg (1974), pp. 255–256&lt;/ref&gt; On May 16, President Wilson launched an investigation headed by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Charles Evans Hughes]] into the War Department and the Council of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;Leuchtenburg (1974), p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; The Hughes report released on October 31, found no major corruption violations or theft in President Wilson's Mobilization program, although the report found incompetence in the aircraft program.&lt;ref&gt;Leuchgenburg (1974), pp. 256–257; U.S. Department of Justice (1918), ''Report on the Aircraft Inquiry, Washington D.C.; Pusey, ''Hughes'', I, pp. 378–382&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other foreign affairs====
In anticipation of the opening of the [[Panama Canal]], Britain protested that U.S. plans to exempt U.S. vessels traveling between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the U.S. from tolls, in accordance with the Panama Canal Act of 1912, violated the [[Hay-Pauncefote Treaty]]. On March 5, 1914, Wilson sent a message to Congress strongly urging the repeal of the exemption. He regarded the exemption as a plain breach of the Treaty and proposed a &quot;voluntary withdrawal from a position everywhere questioned and misunderstood.&quot; In spite of strong opposition within his own party, he forced Democrats in Congress to support a repeal of the exemption.&lt;ref&gt;John Milton Cooper, Jr.,'' Woodrow Wilson: A Biography'' (NY, 2009), 249–50&lt;/ref&gt;

In principal Wilson wanted to avoid the aggressive stance Theodore Roosevelt had taken toward Latin America. For example, he negotiated a treaty with Colombia in which the U.S. apologized for its role in the Panama Revolution of 1903–1904.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, ''Woodrow Wilson'' (2009), 381&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, he did not shrink from intervention on behalf of American values, saying in 1913: &quot;I am going to teach the South American republics to elect good men.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Horgan, ''Great River: the Rio Grande in North American History'' (Middletown, CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1984), 913&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1914 and 1918, the United States intervened in Latin America, particularly in Mexico, [[Haiti]], Cuba, and [[Panama]]. The U.S. maintained troops in [[Nicaragua]] throughout the Wilson administration and used them to select the president of Nicaragua and then to force Nicaragua to pass the [[Bryan-Chamorro Treaty]]. American troops in Haiti, under the command of the federal government, forced the Haitian legislature to choose the candidate Wilson selected as Haitian president. American troops occupied Haiti between 1915 and 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Clements, ''Presidency'' 103–6&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson ordered the military occupation of the [[Dominican Republic]] shortly after the resignation of its President [[Juan Isidro Jimenes Pereyra]] in 1916. The U.S. military worked in concert with wealthy Dominican landowners to suppress the ''gavilleros'', a ''[[Peasant|campesino]]'' [[guerrilla]] force fighting the occupation. The occupation lasted until 1924, and was notorious for its brutality against those in the resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |title=Culture and Customs of the Dominican Republic |last=Brown |first=Isabel Zakrzewski |publisher=Greenwood Press |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|American Expeditionary Force Siberia|Polar Bear Expedition}}
After Russia left the war following the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] of 1917, the Allies sent troops there to prevent a German or [[Bolshevik]] takeover of allied-provided weapons, munitions and other supplies, previously shipped as aid to the pre-revolutionary government.&lt;ref&gt;[[George F. Kennan]], ''Russia Leaves the War'', p. 472, ''et passim''. 1956, repr. 1989, ISBN 0-691-00841-8.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson sent armed forces to assist the withdrawal of [[Czechoslovak Legions]] along the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], hold key port cities at [[Arkhangelsk|Arkangel]] and [[Vladivostok]]. Though not sent to engage the Bolsheviks, the U.S. forces engaged in several armed conflicts against forces of the new Russian government. Despite the apparent innocuousness of Wilson's motives, revolutionaries in Russia resented the American intrusion. As Robert Maddox puts it, &quot;The immediate effect of the intervention was to prolong a bloody civil war, thereby costing thousands of additional lives and wreaking enormous destruction on an already battered society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Maddox, ''The Unknown War with Russia'' (San Rafael, CA: Presidio Press, 1977), 137.&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson withdrew most of the soldiers on April 1, 1920, though some remained until as late as 1922.

In 1919 Wilson guided American foreign policy to &quot;acquiesce&quot; in the [[Balfour Declaration of 1917|Balfour Declaration]] without supporting Zionism in an official way. Wilson expressed sympathy for the plight of Jews, especially in Poland and in France.&lt;ref&gt;Walworth (1986) 473–83, esp. p. 481; Melvin I. Urofsky, ''American Zionism from Herzl to the Holocaust,'' (1995) ch. 6; Frank W. Brecher, ''Reluctant Ally: United States Foreign Policy toward the Jews from Wilson to Roosevelt.'' (1991) ch 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1920, Wilson finally sent a long-deferred proposal to Congress to have the U.S. accept a [[League of Nations mandates|mandate from the League of Nations]] to take over [[Democratic Republic of Armenia|Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Balakian]] (2003). ''The Burning Tigris: The Armenian Genocide and America's Response''. New York: HarperCollins.&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey notes that the scheme was strongly opposed by American public opinion,&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, ''Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal'' (1945) pp. 295–96.&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Richard G. Hovannisian]] states that Wilson &quot;made all the wrong arguments&quot; for the mandate and focused less on the immediate policy than on how history would judge his actions: &quot;[he] wished to place it clearly on the record that the abandonment of Armenia was not his doing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Hovannisian| first =Richard G. |authorlink=Richard G.

====Peace Conference 1919====
{{Main|Paris Peace Conference, 1919}}
After World War I, Wilson participated in negotiations with the stated aim of assuring statehood for formerly oppressed nations and an equitable peace. On January 8, 1918, Wilson made his famous ''[[Fourteen Points]]'' address, introducing the idea of a [[League of Nations]], an organization with a stated goal of helping to preserve territorial integrity and political independence among large and small nations alike.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, ''Woodrow Wilson,'' pp 420–453&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson intended the Fourteen Points as a means toward ending the war and achieving an equitable peace for all the nations. He spent six months in Paris for the Peace Conference (making him the first U.S. president to travel to Europe while in office). He worked tirelessly to promote his plan. The charter of the proposed League of Nations was incorporated into the conference's [[Treaty of Versailles]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold M. Rice, John A. Krout, ''United States History From 1865'', (HarperCollins, 1991), p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan proposed that the Covenant include a [[Racial Equality Proposal, 1919|racial equality clause]]. Wilson was indifferent to the issue, but acceded to strong opposition from Australia and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Naoko Shimazu, ''Japan, Race, and Equality: The Racial Equality Proposal of 1919'' (NY: Routledge, 1998), 154ff, [http://books.google.com/books?id=YwHbgnSi_sQC&amp;pg=PA154&amp; available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

When Wilson traveled to Europe to settle the peace terms, he visited Pope [[Benedict XV]] in Rome, making Wilson the first American President to visit the Pope while in office.

[[File:WoodrowWilsonVersailles.jpg|upright|thumb|Wilson returning from the Versailles Peace Conference, 1919.]]
For his peace-making efforts, Wilson was awarded the 1919 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nobelprize1919&quot;/&gt;

====Treaty fight, 1919====
The next question was whether the United States Senate would approve the treaty by the required two-thirds vote. On September 3, 1919, Wilson embarked on a cross-country speaking tour in an attempt to rally the nation to his support, despite the intense opposition from Irish Catholics and Germans, most of them Democrats. Wilson had a series of debilitating strokes and had to cancel his trip on September 26, 1919. He became an invalid in the White House, closely monitored or controlled by his wife. Republicans under Senator Lodge controlled both houses of Congress after the 1918 elections. The key point of disagreement was whether the League would diminish the power of Congress to declare war.

The Senate was divided into a crazy quilt of positions on the Versailles question.&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, ''Woodrow Wilson,'' 507–560&lt;/ref&gt; It proved possible to build a majority coalition, but impossible to build the two-thirds coalition needed to pass a treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Bailey, ''Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal'' (1945)&lt;/ref&gt; One block of Democrats strongly supported the Versailles Treaty. A second group of Democrats supported the Treaty but followed Wilson in opposing any amendments or reservations. The largest bloc, led by Senator Lodge, comprised a majority of the Republicans. They wanted a treaty with reservations, especially on Article X, which involved the power of the League Nations to make war without a vote by the United States Congress. Finally, a bipartisan group of 13 &quot;[[irreconcilables]]&quot; opposed a treaty in any form.&lt;ref&gt;Ralph A. Stone (1970). ''The Irreconcilables: The Fight Against the League of Nations''. Lexington: University Press of Kentucky.&lt;/ref&gt; The closest the Treaty came to passage came in mid-November 1919 when Lodge and his Republicans formed a coalition with the pro-Treaty Democrats, and were close to a two-thirds majority for a Treaty with reservations, but Wilson rejected this compromise and enough Democrats followed his lead to permanently end the chances for ratification. Cooper and Bailey suggest that Wilson's stroke on September 25, 1919, had so altered his personality that he was unable to effectively negotiate with Lodge. Cooper says, the psychological effects of a stroke were profound: &quot;Wilson's emotions were unbalanced, and his judgment was warped....Worse, his denial of illness and limitations was starting to border on delusion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, ''Woodrow Wilson,'' 544, 557–560; Bailey calls Wilson's rejection, &quot;The Supreme Infanticide,&quot; ''Woodrow Wilson and the Great Betrayal'' (1945) p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, Wilson became less trustful of the press and stopped holding press conferences for them, preferring to use his propaganda unit, the Committee for Public Information, instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;american chronicle&quot;/&gt; A poll of historians in 2006 cited Wilson's failure to compromise with the Republicans on U.S. entry into the League as one of the 10 largest errors on the part of an American president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Wayback|url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/World/20060218/presidential_errors_060218/|title=2006 Historian Poll|date=20110604151434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Post war: 1919–1920====
Wilson's administration did not plan for the process of demobilization at the war's end. Though some advisers tried to engage the President's attention to what they called &quot;reconstruction&quot;, his tepid support for a federal commission evaporated with the election of 1918. Republican gains in the Senate meant that his opposition would have to consent to the appointment of commission members. Instead, Wilson favored the prompt dismantling of wartime boards and regulatory agencies.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Kennedy, ''Over Here: The First Wold War and American Society'' (NY: Oxford University Press, 2004) 249–50&lt;/ref&gt;

Demobilization proved chaotic and violent. Four million soldiers were sent home with little planning, little money, and few benefits.

&lt;!-- we lack coverage of Wilson and domestic scene during these years, but he didn't order Palmer to get radicals and his role in strikes was slight --&gt;

As the election of 1920 approached, Wilson imagined that a deadlocked Democratic convention might turn to him as the only candidate who would make U.S. participation in the League of Nations the dominant issue. He imagined and sometimes pretended he was healthy enough for the effort, but several times admitted that he knew he could not survive a campaign. No one around the President dared tell him that he was incapable and that the campaign for the League was already lost. At the Convention in late June 1920, some Wilson partisans made efforts on his behalf and sent Wilson hopeful reports, but they were quashed by Wilson's wiser friends.&lt;ref&gt;David Pietrusza, ''1920: The Year of Six Presidents'' (NY: Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers, 2007), 191–2, 198–200, 253&lt;/ref&gt;

====Incapacity==== &lt;!-- needs to be condensed --&gt;

Wilson suffered from a bout of [[1918 flu pandemic|influenza]] early in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virus.stanford.edu/uda/ |title=The 1918 Influenza Pandemic |publisher=Virus.stanford.edu |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The immediate cause of his incapacitation was the physical strain of the public speaking tour he undertook to obtain support for ratification of the Covenant of the League of Nations.

During his presidency, he had repeated episodes of unexplained arm and hand weakness, and his [[retinal]] arteries were said to be abnormal on fundoscopic examination.[http://www.doctorzebra.com/prez/g28.htm The Health &amp; Medical History of President Woodrow Wilson], accessed November 9, 2009. He developed severe headaches, diplopia (double vision), and evanescent weakness of the left arm and leg. In retrospect, those problems likely represented the effects of cerebral [[transient ischemic attack]]s. Weinstein EA, ''Woodrow Wilson: A Medical &amp; Psychological Biography'' (Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ, 1981), pp. 260–270&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, on October 2, 1919, he suffered a serious stroke that almost totally incapacitated him, leaving him paralyzed on his left side and blind in his left eye.&lt;ref&gt;This was a cataclysmic &quot;cerebrovascular accident&quot; (stroke) that left him with a dense and permanent [[paralysis]] of the left side of his body ([[hemiplegia]]), as well as [[hemianopsia]]. Park BE, ''The Impact of Illness of World Leaders'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, Philadelphia, 1986), pp. 3–76&lt;/ref&gt; He was confined to bed for weeks, sequestered from nearly everyone except his wife and his physician, Dr. [[Cary Grayson]].&lt;ref&gt;Grayson CT, ''Woodrow Wilson: An Intimate Memoir'' (NY: Holt, Rhinehart, &amp; Winston, 1960), pp. 96–110&lt;/ref&gt; For at least a few months, he used a wheelchair. Later, he could walk only with the assistance of a cane.

With few exceptions, Wilson was kept out of the presence of Vice President [[Thomas R. Marshall]], his [[United States Cabinet|cabinet]], and Congressional visitors to the [[White House]] for the remainder of his term. His wife served as his steward, selecting issues for his attention and delegating other issues to his cabinet heads. Eventually, Wilson resumed his attendance at cabinet meetings, but his input there was perfunctory at best.&lt;ref&gt;Hoover H., ''The Ordeal of Woodrow Wilson'' (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1958), pp. 271–278&lt;/ref&gt; This was one of the most serious cases of presidential disability in American history and was later cited as an argument for the [[Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|25th Amendment]].&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Brownell, Jr., &quot;Presidential Disability: The Need for a Constitutional Amendment,&quot; ''Yale Law Journal'', vol. 68, no. 2 (December 1958), 194–5; Ruth C. Silva, &quot;Presidential Succession and Disability,&quot; ''Law and Contemporary Problems'', vol. 21, no. 4 (Autumn 1956), 651–3&lt;/ref&gt; The full extent of his disability was kept from the public until after his death on February 3, 1924.

===Administration and Cabinet===
Wilson's chief of staff (&quot;Secretary&quot;) was [[Joseph Patrick Tumulty]] 1913–1921, but he was largely upstaged after 1916 when Wilson's second wife, Edith Bolling Galt Wilson, assumed full control of Wilson's schedule. The most important foreign policy advisor and confidant was &quot;Colonel&quot; [[Edward M. House]] until Wilson broke with him in early 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Walworth, &quot;Considerations on Woodrow Wilson and Edward M. House&quot;, ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 1994 24(1): 79–86.

===Supreme Court appointments===
Wilson appointed the following Justices to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]:
* [[James Clark McReynolds]] in 1914. He served more than 26 years and established a consistent record in opposition to [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]]'s [[New Deal]] programs, including the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], the [[National Industrial Recovery Act]], and the [[Social Security Act]].
* [[Louis Brandeis|Louis Dembitz Brandeis]] in 1916. He served almost 23 years and wrote landmark opinions in cases respecting free speech and the right to privacy.
* [[John Hessin Clarke]] in 1916. He served just 6 years on the Court before resigning. He thoroughly disliked his work as an Associate Justice.

==Retirement, death and personal affairs==
[[File:Woodrow Wilson tomb 2.jpg|thumb|left|The final resting place of Woodrow Wilson at the [[Washington National Cathedral]]]]
In 1921, Wilson and his wife Edith retired from the White House to an elegant 1915 town house in the [[Embassy Row]] ([[Kalorama, Washington, D.C.|Kalorama]]) section of Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/presidents/site16.htm |title=CR.NPS.gov |publisher=CR.NPS.gov |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson continued going for daily drives, and attended Keith's [[vaudeville]] theatre on Saturday nights. Wilson was one of only two Presidents ([[Theodore Roosevelt]] was the first) to have served as president of the [[American Historical Association]].&lt;ref&gt;David Henry Burton. ''Theodore Roosevelt, American Politician'', p.146. Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1997, ISBN 0-8386-3727-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson attended only two state occasions in his retirement: the ceremonies preceding the burial of the [[Tomb of the Unknowns|Unknown Soldier]] in [[Arlington National Cemetery]], in [[Arlington, Virginia]], on [[Armistice Day]] (November 11), 1921, and President [[Warren G. Harding]]'s state funeral in the [[U.S. Capitol]], on August 8, 1923. On November 10, 1923, Wilson made a short Armistice Day radio speech from the library of his home, his last national address. The following day, Armistice Day itself, he spoke briefly from the front steps to more than 20,000 well wishers gathered outside the house.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/nr/twhp/wwwlps/lessons/14wilson/14facts3.htm |title=NPS.gov |publisher=NPS.gov |date=November 10, 1923 |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodrowwilsonhouse.org/index.asp?section=timeline&amp;file=timelinesearch_day&amp;id=612 |title=Woodrowwilsonhouse.org |publisher=Woodrowwilsonhouse.org |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson died in his S Street home on February 3, 1924. He was buried in [[Washington National Cathedral]], the only president buried in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;John Whitcomb, Claire Whitcomb. ''Real Life at the White House'', p.262. Routledge, 2002, ISBN 0-415-93951-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Mrs. Wilson stayed in the home another 37 years, dying there on December 28, 1961, the day she was to be the guest of honor at the opening of the [[Woodrow Wilson Bridge]] across the [[Potomac River]] near and in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;This Interstate Highway drawbridge (on I-95 and I-495) crosses the southern tip of the District of Columbia as well as portions of Maryland and Virginia.&lt;/ref&gt;  She died with her favorite dog, Rooter, at her bedside.

Mrs. Wilson left the home and much of the contents to the [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]] to be made into a museum honoring her husband. The [[Woodrow Wilson House (Washington, D.C.)|Woodrow Wilson House]] opened to the public in 1963, was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1964, and listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/Presidents/site16.htm &quot;Woodrow Wilson House&quot;], National Park Service Website, accessed January 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson wrote his one page [[will (law)|will]] on May 31, 1917, and appointed his wife Edith as his executrix. He left his daughter [[Margaret Woodrow Wilson|Margaret]] an annuity of $2,500 annually for as long as she remained unmarried, and left what had been his first wife's personal property to his daughters. The rest he left to Edith as a life estate with the provision that at her death his daughters would divide the estate among themselves. In the event that Edith had a child, her children would inherit on an equal footing with his daughters. As the second Mrs. Wilson had no children from either of her marriages, he was thus providing for the child of a possible subsequent third marriage on her part.&lt;ref&gt;''Wills of the U.S. Presidents'', edited by Herbert R Collins and David B Weaver (New York: Communication Channels Inc., 1976) 176–177, ISBN 0-916164-01-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===African Americans===

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- p. 158--&gt; of African Americans left the Republican Party to cast their vote for Wilson, a Democrat. They were encouraged by his promises of support for minorities. However, once in office, Wilson's cabinet members expanded racially [[racial segregation|segregationist]] policies. Black leaders who had supported Wilson in the 1912 election were angered when Wilson placed segregationist white Southerners in charge of many executive departments,&lt;ref name=JNH_Wolgemuth/&gt;&lt;ref name=weiss&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Nancy J. |last=Weiss |title=The Negro and the New Freedom: Fighting Wilsonian Segregation |jstor=2147047 |journal=Political Science Quarterly |year=1969 |volume=84 |issue=1 |pages=61–79 |doi=10.2307/2147047 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the administration acted to reduce the already-meager number of African-Americans in political-appointee positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foner&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=weiss/&gt; Wilson's cabinet officials, with the president's blessing, proceeded to establish official segregation in most federal government offices – in some departments for the first time since 1863.&lt;ref name=JNH_Wolgemuth&gt;{{cite journal |title=Woodrow Wilson and Federal Segregation |first=Kathleen L. |jstor=2716036 |last=Wolgemuth |journal=The Journal of Negro History |volume=44 |issue=2 |year=1959 |pages=158–173 |doi=10.2307/2716036 |issn=0022-2992 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New facilities were designed to keep the races working there separated. 

Historian [[Eric Foner]] says, &quot;&lt;nowiki&gt;[Wilson's]&lt;/nowiki&gt; administration imposed full racial segregation in Washington and hounded from office considerable numbers of black federal employees.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Foner&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umich.edu/%7eurel/admissions/legal/expert/foner.html |author=Foner, Eric| work=The Compelling Need for Diversity in Higher Education |title= Expert Report Of Eric Foner| publisher=University of Michigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation was also quickly implemented at the Post Office Department headquarters in Washington, D.C. Many African American employees were downgraded and even fired. The segregation implemented in the Department of Treasury and the Post Office Department involved not only screened-off working spaces, but separate lunchrooms and toilets.

Some segregationist federal workplace policies introduced by the Wilson administration would remain until the [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] Administration in the 1940s.&lt;ref name =EO9980_04_26_1948&gt;Executive Order 9980, July 26, 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

Other steps were taken by the Wilson Administration to make obtaining a civil service job more difficult for blacks. Primary among these was the requirement, implemented in 1914 and continued until 1940, that all candidates for civil service jobs attach a photograph to their application further allowing for discrimination in the hiring process.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.postalmuseum.si.edu/AfricanAmericanHistory/p5.html Smithsonian National Postal Museum&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wolgemuth |first=Kathleen L. |title=Woodrow Wilson and Federal Segregation |journal=Journal of Negro History |volume=44 |year=1959 |page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these policies, Wilson was criticized by such hard-line segregationists as Georgia's [[Thomas E. Watson]], for not going far enough in restricting black employment in the federal government.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

Wilson did not interfere with the well-established system of [[Jim Crow]] and backed the demands of Southern Democrats that their states be left alone to deal with issues of race and black voting without interference from Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas A. Blackmon, ''Slavery by Another Name: The Re-Enslavement of Black Americans from the Civil War to World War II'', Anchor Books 2009, pp. 357–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1914, Wilson told ''[[The New York Times]]'', &quot;If the colored people made a mistake in voting for me, they ought to correct it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=President Resents Negro's Criticism | url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9C01E0DC1738E633A25750C1A9679D946596D6CF |work=The New York Times | page= 1 | date=November 13, 1914 | accessdate=February 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson drafted hundreds of thousands of blacks into the army, giving them equal pay with whites, but kept them in all-black units with white officers, and kept the great majority out of combat.&lt;ref&gt;James J. Cooke, ''The All-Americans at War: The 82nd Division in the Great War, 1917–1918'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; When a delegation of blacks protested the discriminatory actions, Wilson told them &quot;segregation is not a humiliation but a benefit, and ought to be so regarded by you gentlemen.&quot; [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], a leader of the [[NAACP]] who had campaigned for Wilson was in 1918 offered an Army commission in charge of dealing with race relations; DuBois accepted, but he failed his Army physical and did not serve.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Ellis, &quot;'Closing Ranks' and 'Seeking Honors': W. E. B. Du Bois in World War I&quot; ''Journal of American History'', 1992 79(1): 96–124. [http://www.jstor.org/pss/2078469 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wilson's segregationist stance as president should perhaps not have come as a surprise; while president of [[Princeton University]], Wilson had discouraged blacks from even applying for admission, preferring to keep the peace among white students than have black students admitted.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Link, ''Wilson:The Road to the White House'' (Princeton University Press, 1947) 502&lt;/ref&gt; Wilson's ''History of the American People'' (1901) charitably explained the [[Ku Klux Klan]] of the late 1860s as the natural outgrowth of [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], a lawless reaction to a lawless period. Wilson wrote that the Klan &quot;began to attempt by intimidation what they were not allowed to attempt by the ballot or by any ordered course of public action&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of the American People|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Y3wQAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=history+of+the+american+people&amp;q=attempt%20by%20intimidation|first=Woodrow|last=Wilson|year=1918|publisher=[[Harper and Brothers]]|location=New York|page=59|volume=IX|separator=,|accessdate=July 6, 2010|origyear=1901}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===White ethnic groups===
Wilson had harsh words to say about immigrants in his history books, but after he entered politics in 1910, Wilson worked to integrate immigrants into the Democratic party, the army, and American life. During the war, he demanded in return that they repudiate any loyalty to enemy nations. [[Irish Americans]] were powerful in the Democratic party and opposed going to war as allies of their traditional enemy Britain, especially after the violent suppression of the [[Easter Rebellion]] of 1916. Wilson won them over in 1917 by promising to ask Britain to give Ireland its [[Irish republicanism|independence]]. At Versailles, however, he reneged because he saw the Irish situation purely as an internal UK matter and did not perceive the dispute and the unrest in Ireland as comparable to the plight of the various nationalities in Europe as a fall-out from World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kennedy |first=Billy |url=http://www.ulstervirginia.com/woodrowwilson.asp |title=Woodrow Wilson |publisher=Ulstervirginia.com |accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result much of the Irish-American community vehemently denounced him. Wilson, in turn, blamed the Irish Americans and [[German American]]s for lack of popular support for the [[League of Nations]], saying:&lt;ref&gt;American Rhetoric, [http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/wilsonleagueofnations.htm &quot;Final Address in Support of the League of Nations&quot;], Woodrow Wilson, delivered September 25, 1919 in Pueblo, Colorado.

On December 28, 1925, less than two years after Wilson's death, the [[U.S. Post Office]] issued the 17-cent stamp in his honor. On January 10, 1956, the 7¢ [[Liberty Issue]] postage stamp honoring Wilson was also issued.

The [[USS Woodrow Wilson (SSBN-624)|USS ''Woodrow Wilson'' (SSBN-624)]], a Lafayette-class ballistic missile submarine, was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Wilson. She later was converted into an attack submarine and redesignated SSN-624.

The [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]] was founded at Princeton in 1930, created in the spirit of Wilson's interest in preparing students for leadership in public and international affairs.

The college has placed a marker on the building, renamed Woodrow Wilson Hall, commemorating the home. It was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1985.

In 1929, Wilson's image appeared on the [[Large denominations of United States currency|$100,000 bill]]. The bill, now out of print but still [[legal tender]], was only used to transfer money between [[Federal Reserve]] banks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ask.yahoo.com/20051110.html Ask Yahoo!] November 10, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frbsf.org/currency/world/nocirc/m2.html The $100,000 bill] Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1944, [[Darryl F. Zanuck]] of [[20th Century Fox]] produced a film titled ''[[Wilson (film)|Wilson]]''. It looked back with nostalgia to Wilson's presidency, especially concerning his role as commander-in-chief during World War I.

A section of the Rambla of [[Montevideo, Uruguay]], is named [[Rambla Presidente Wilson]]. A street in the 16th ''arondissement'' in Paris, running from [[Trocadéro]] to the Place de l'Alma, is named the Avenue du Président Wilson. The Pont Wilson crosses the Rhône river in the center of [[Lyon, France]]. The Boulevard du Président Wilson extends from the main train station of [[Strasbourg]], and connects to the Boulevard Clemenceau. In [[Bordeaux]], the Boulevard du Président Wilson links to the Boulevard George V. The Quai du Président Wilson forms part of the port of [[Marseille]].  [[Praha hlavní nádraží]], the main railway station of [[Prague]] has, for much of its history, been known as the &quot;Wilson Station&quot; ([[Czech language|Czech]]: Wilsonovo nádraží).

In 2010, Wilson was inducted into the [[New Jersey Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=[[The Newark Star Ledger]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books and Writing==

The publications of Wilson's authorship are quite extensive. &lt;http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Author:Woodrow_Wilson#Books_by_Wilson&gt;  

Of the books published under his authorship, &quot;The New Freedom&quot; contains many controversial yet still relevant assertions. &quot;Our Government has been for the past few years under the control of the heads of great allied corporations with special interests.&quot;   &quot;The Government has not controlled these interests ... it has submitted itself to their control&quot;. - p25, &quot;We vote : we are offered the platform we want ;  we elect the men who stand on that platform, and we get absolutely nothing.&quot; -p27, &quot;We know that the machines of both parties are subsidised by the same persons, and therefore it is useless to turn in either direction.&quot; -p27.
