'''Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev''', or '''Gorbachov''' (more accurately reflecting the pronunciation of his name) ({{lang-rus|Михаи́л Серге́евич Горбачёв|r=Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachyov|p=mʲɪxɐˈil sʲɪrˈɡʲejəvʲɪtɕ ɡərbɐˈtɕof|a=ru-Mikhail Sergeyevich Gorbachev.ogg}}; born 2 March 1931), is a former Soviet statesman, having served as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union#List of General Secretaries|General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] from 1985 until 1991, and as the last head of state of the [[Soviet Union]], having served from 1988 until [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|its dissolution]] in 1991. He was the only general secretary in the history of the Soviet Union to have been born during the Communist rule.

Gorbachev was born in [[Stavropol Krai]] into a peasant [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]–[[Russians|Russian]] family, and in his teens operated [[combine harvester]]s on [[collective farm]]s. He graduated from [[Moscow State University]] in 1955 with a degree in law. While he was at the university, he joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], and soon became very active within it. In 1970, he was appointed the First Party Secretary of the Stavropol Kraikom, First Secretary to the Supreme Soviet in 1974, and appointed a member of the [[Politburo]] in 1979. Within three years of the deaths of Soviet Leaders [[Leonid Brezhnev]], [[Yuri Andropov]], and [[Konstantin Chernenko]], Gorbachev was elected General Secretary by the Politburo in 1985. Before he reached the post, he had occasionally been mentioned in western newspapers as a likely next leader and a man of the younger generation at the top level.

Gorbachev's attempts at reform as well as summit conferences with United States President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his reorientation of Soviet strategic aims contributed to the end of the [[Cold War]], ended the political supremacy of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), and led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. For these efforts, he was awarded the [[Otto Hahn Peace Medal]] in 1989, the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1990 and the [[Harvey Prize]] in 1992 as well as [[Honorary Doctorate]]s from University of Calgary&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucalgary.ca/&lt;/ref&gt; in 1993, &lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcollections.ucalgary.ca/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/arctime&amp;CISOPTR=99&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=2}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Durham University]] in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/committees/Council/1995-11-28m |title=Minutes of the Council Meeting|publisher=Durham University |accessdate=8 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trinity College, Dublin|Trinity College]] in 2002&lt;ref name=&quot;Tcd.ie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcd.ie/Secretary/Communications/Press_Releases/PRArchive/PR0102/PRGorbachev.html |title=Trinity College Honours Mikhail Gorbachev |publisher=Tcd.ie |accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[University of Münster]] in 2005,&lt;ref name=&quot;Deutsche Welle&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,1619484,00.html|title = Reunification Politicians Accept Prize|publisher=Deutsche Welle|accessdate =22 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Eureka College]] in 2009.

==Early life==
{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}

Gorbachev was born on 2 March 1931 in [[Stavropol]], [[Russian SFSR]], [[Soviet Union]], into a  mixed Russian-Ukrainian family&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Sergeevich Gorbachev, Daisaku Ikeda (2005). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=-fKiVBBHB-0C&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Moral lessons of twentieth century: Gorbachev and Ikeda on Buddhism and Communism]''&quot;. I.B.Tauris. p. 11. ISBN 1-85043-976-1&lt;/ref&gt; of migrants from [[Voronezh]] and [[Chernigov]] [[Governorates]]. As a child, Gorbachev experienced the [[Soviet famine of 1932–1933]]. Gorbachev recalled in a memoir that &quot;In that terrible year [in 1933] nearly half the population of my native village, Privolnoye, starved to death, including two sisters and one brother of my father.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mikhail Sergeevich Gorbachev (2006). &quot;''[http://books.google.com/books?id=JLQ2RZRtOFkC&amp;pg=&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Manifesto for the Earth: action now for peace, global justice and a sustainable future]''&quot;. CLAIRVIEW BOOKS. p.10. ISBN 1-905570-02-3&lt;/ref&gt; Both of his grandfathers were [[Political repression in the Soviet Union|arrested]] on false charges in the 1930s; his paternal grandfather was sent to exile in Siberia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gorbachev: On My Country and the World|isbn=978-0-231-11515-5|author=Mikhail Gorbachev|year=2000|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|page=20|others=George Shriver (Translator)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gorbifund&quot; /&gt;

His father was a combine harvester operator and [[World War II]] veteran, named Sergey Andreyevich Gorbachev. His mother, Maria Panteleyevna Gorbacheva (née Gopkalo), was a [[kolkhoz]] worker.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gorbifund&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gorby.ru/en/gorbachev/biography/ | title=Biography of Mikhail Gorbachev | accessdate=13 January 2012 | publisher=[[The Gorbachev Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his teens, he operated combine harvesters on collective farms. He graduated from Moscow State University in 1955 with a degree in law. In 1967 he qualified as an agricultural economist via a correspondence masters degree at the Stavropol Institute of Agriculture. While at the university, he joined the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and soon became very active within the party.

==Marriage and family==
{{Expand section|date=March 2012}}
Gorbachev met his future wife, [[Raisa Gorbachova|Raisa Titarenko]], at Moscow State University. They married in September 1953 and moved to Stavropol upon graduation. She gave birth to their only child, daughter Irina Mikhailovna Virganskaya (Ири́на Миха́йловна Вирга́нская), in 1957. Raisa Gorbacheva died of [[leukemia]] in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gorby.ru/en/gorbacheva/biography/|title=Raisa Gorbachyova's Biography on the Gorbachyov Foundation website}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorbachev has two granddaughters (Ksenia and Anastasia) and one great granddaughter (Aleksandra).

==Rise in the Communist Party==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1986-1126-307, LPG Golßen, Besuch durch KPdSU Delegation.jpg|thumb|left|Gorbachev visiting a pig farm in [[East Germany]], 10 June 1966]]
Gorbachev attended the important [[22nd Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|twenty-second Party Congress]] in October 1961, where [[Nikita Khrushchev]] announced a plan to surpass the U.S. in per capita production within twenty years. At this point in his life, Gorbachev would rise in the Communist League hierarchy and worked his way up through territorial leagues of the party. He was promoted to Head of the Department of Party Organs in the Stavropol Agricultural Kraikom in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;Current Biography 1985&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Current Biography, 1985|publisher=The H. W. Wilson Co.|location = New York |year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, he was appointed First Party Secretary of the Stavropol Kraikom, a body of the CPSU, becoming one of the youngest provincial party chiefs in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Current Biography 1985&quot;/&gt; In this position he helped reorganise the collective farms, improve workers' living conditions, expand the size of their private plots, and gave them a greater voice in planning.&lt;ref name=&quot;Current Biography 1985&quot;/&gt;

He was soon made a member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party Central Committee]] in 1971. Three years later, in 1974, he was made a Deputy to the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]] and Chairman of the Standing Commission on Youth Affairs. He was subsequently appointed to the Central Committee's Secretariat for Agriculture in 1978, replacing [[Fyodor Kulakov]], who had supported Gorbachev's appointment, after Kulakov died of a heart attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;Current Biography 1985&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Memoirs&gt;Gorbachev, M. S., ''Memoirs'', 1996 (London: Bantam Books)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, Gorbachev was promoted to the Politburo, the highest authority in the country, and received full membership in 1980. Gorbachev owed his steady rise to power to the patronage of [[Mikhail Suslov]], the powerful chief ideologist of the CPSU.&lt;ref name=&quot;brit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/nobelprize/article-9037405|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=2 April 2009|title=Mikhail Gorbachev}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Yuri Andropov's tenure as General Secretary (1982–1984), Gorbachev became one of the Politburo's most visible and active members.&lt;ref name=&quot;brit&quot;/&gt; With responsibility over personnel, working together with Andropov, 20 percent of the top echelon of government ministers and regional governors were replaced, often with younger men. During this time [[Grigory Romanov]], [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]], and [[Yegor Ligachev]] were elevated, the latter two working closely with Gorbachev, Ryzhkov on economics, Ligachev on personnel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first= Angus| last= Roxburgh| year= 1991| title= The Second Russian Revolution: The Struggle for Power in the Kremlin| publisher=BBC Books| location= London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}

Gorbachev's positions within the CPSU created more opportunities to travel abroad, and this would profoundly affect his political and social views in the future as leader of the country. In 1972, he headed a Soviet delegation to Belgium,&lt;ref name=&quot;Current Biography 1985&quot;/&gt; and three years later he led a delegation to West Germany; in 1983 he headed a delegation to Canada to meet with Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]] and members of the [[Canadian House of Commons|Commons]] and [[Canadian Senate|Senate]]. In 1984, he travelled to the United Kingdom, where he met British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]].

Upon Andropov's death in 1984, the aged Konstantin Chernenko took power; after his death the following year, it became clear to the party hierarchy that younger leadership was needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=American Academy of Achievement|accessdate=2 April 2009|title=Mikhail Gorbachev Biography: Glasnost, Perestroika, and Leadership|date=1 February 2005|url=http://www.achievement.org/autodoc/page/gor0bio-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorbachev was elected General Secretary by the Politburo on 11 March 1985, only three hours after Chernenko's death. Upon his accession at age 54, he was the youngest member of the Politburo.&lt;ref name=&quot;brit&quot;/&gt;

==General Secretary of the CPSU==

Mikhail Gorbachev was the Party's first leader to have been born after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Revolution]]. As de facto ruler of the USSR, he tried to reform the stagnating Party and the state economy by introducing ''[[glasnost]]'' (&quot;openness&quot;), ''[[perestroika]]'' (&quot;restructuring&quot;), ''[[Democratisation in the Soviet Union|demokratizatsiya]]'' (&quot;democratization&quot;), and ''[[uskoreniye]]'' (&quot;acceleration&quot; of economic development), which were launched at the 27th Congress of the CPSU in February 1986.

Gorbachev's primary goal as General Secretary was to revive the [[Soviet economy]] after the stagnant Brezhnev years.&lt;ref name=&quot;brit&quot;/&gt; In 1985, he announced that the Soviet economy was stalled and that reorganization was needed. Gorbachev proposed a &quot;vague programme of reform&quot;, which was adopted at the April Plenum of the Central Committee.&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt; He called for fast-paced technological modernization and increased industrial and agricultural productivity, and he attempted to reform the Soviet bureaucracy to be more efficient and prosperous.&lt;ref name=&quot;brit&quot;/&gt;

Gorbachev soon realized that fixing the Soviet economy would be nearly impossible without reforming the political and social structure of the Communist nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/ussr/ussr_state/gorbachev.php|title=Михаил Сергеевич Горбачёв (Mikhail Sergeyevičh Gorbačhëv)|accessdate=3 April 2009|date=27 March 2009|publisher=Archontology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorbachev also initiated the concept of ''[[gospriyomka]]'' (state acceptance of production) during his time as leader,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink=Giulietto Chiesa |last=Chiesa |first=Giulietto |year=1991 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=tSSbOxweazoC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=Gospriyomka+gorbachev&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nVEFJGcYkZ&amp;sig=YJfX2OWKd2OiMKPNV9jGFcaKjG0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pga6SoXLJJuQ6APF5bCdAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Gospriyomka%20gorbachev&amp;f=false |title=Time of change: an insider's view of Russia's transformation |publisher=I.B.Tauris |page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which represented state approval of goods in an effort to maintain quality control and combat inferior manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |authorlink=Geoffrey Hosking |first=Geoffrey Alan |last=Hosking |year=1991 |url=http://books.google.com.au/books?id=bFQ6VO1sFGsC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=Gospriyomka+gorbachev&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WW4wBdy4fV&amp;sig=xaYwfzlVh7PI-MJ4nZnP9J6Sro8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=pga6SoXLJJuQ6APF5bCdAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=Gospriyomka%20gorbachev&amp;f=false |title=The awakening of the Soviet Union |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He made a speech in May 1985 in Leningrad (now [[St. Petersburg]]) advocating widespread reforms. The reforms began in personnel changes; the most notable change was the replacement of [[Andrei Gromyko]] as Minister of Foreign Affairs with [[Eduard Shevardnadze]]. Gromyko, disparaged as &quot;Mr Nyet&quot; in the West, had served for 28 years as Minister of Foreign Affairs and was considered an 'old thinker'. Robert D. English notes that, despite Shevardnadze's diplomatic inexperience, Gorbachev &quot;shared with him an outlook&quot; and experience in managing an agricultural region of the Soviet Union ([[Georgian SSR|Georgia]]), which meant that both had weak links to the powerful [[military-industrial complex]].&lt;ref name=RDEnglish&gt;English, R., D, ''Russia and the Idea of the West: Gorbachev, Intellectuals and the End of the Cold War'', 2000 (Columbia University Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of reformist ideas were discussed by Politburo members. One of the first reforms Gorbachev introduced was the anti-alcohol campaign, begun in May 1985, which was designed to fight widespread alcoholism in the Soviet Union. Prices of vodka, wine, and beer were raised, and their sales were restricted. It was pursued vigorously and cut both alcohol sales and government revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;jfh124125&quot;&gt;Hough, Jerry F. (1997), pp. 124–125&lt;/ref&gt; It was a serious blow to the state budget—a loss of approximately 100&amp;nbsp;billion rubles according to [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]]—after alcohol production migrated to the [[black market]] economy. The program proved to be a useful symbol for change in the country, however.&lt;ref name=&quot;jfh124125&quot;/&gt;

The purpose of reform, however, was to prop up the [[Planned economy|centrally planned economy]], not transition to [[market socialism]]. Speaking in late summer 1985 to the secretaries for economic affairs of the central committees of the East European communist parties, Gorbachev said: &quot;Many of you see the solution to your problems in resorting to market mechanisms in place of direct planning. Some of you look at the market as a lifesaver for your economies. But, comrades, you should not think about lifesavers but about the ship, and the ship is socialism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bialer, Seweryn, and Joan Afferica. &quot;The Genesis of Gorbachev's World.&quot; ''Foreign Affairs'' 64, no. 3 (1985): 605–644.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Perestroika''====
{{main|Perestroika}}
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1986-0416-418, Berlin, Michail Gorbatschow an der Mauer.jpg|thumb|Gorbachev at the [[Brandenburg Gate]] in 1986 during a visit to [[East Germany]]]]
Gorbachev initiated his new policy of ''perestroika'' and its attendant radical reforms in 1986; they were sketched, but not fully spelled out, at the [[Congress of the CPSU|XXVIIth Party Congress]] in February–March 1986. The new policy of &quot;reconstruction&quot; was introduced in an attempt to overcome the economic stagnation by creating a dependable and effective mechanism for accelerating economic and social progress.&lt;ref name=&quot;mk322&quot;&gt;Kishlansky, Mark (2001), p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Gorbachev, ''perestroika'' was the &quot;conference of development of democracy, socialist self-government, encouragement of initiative and creative endeavor, improved order and disciple{{Verify source|should this be &quot;discipline&quot;?|date=September 2010}}, more glasnost, criticism and self-criticism in all spheres of our society. It is utmost respect for the individual and consideration for personal dignity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mk322&quot;/&gt;

Domestic changes continued apace. In a bombshell speech during [[Armenian SSR]]'s Central Committee Plenum of the Communist Party, the young First Secretary of Armenia's Hrazdan Regional Communist Party, [[Hayk Kotanjian]], criticised rampant corruption in the Armenian Communist Party's highest echelons, implicating Armenian SSR Communist Party First Secretary [[Karen Demirchyan]] and calling for his resignation. Symbolically, intellectual [[Andrei Sakharov]] was invited to return to Moscow by Gorbachev in December 1986 after six years of internal exile in [[Nizhny Novgorod|Gorky]]. During the same month, however, signs of the nationalities problem that would haunt the later years of the Soviet Union surfaced as riots, named [[Jeltoqsan]], occurred in Kazakhstan after [[Dinmukhamed Kunayev]] was replaced as First Secretary of the [[Communist Party of Kazakhstan]].

The Central Committee Plenum in January 1987 would see the crystallisation of Gorbachev's political reforms, including proposals for multi-candidate elections and the appointment of non-Party members to government positions. He also first raised the idea of expanding co-operatives at the plenum. Economic reforms took up much of the rest of 1987, as a new law giving enterprises more independence was passed in June and Gorbachev released a book, ''Perestroika: New Thinking for Our Country and the World'', in November, elucidating his main ideas for reform. In 1987 he rehabilitated many opponents of [[Joseph Stalin]], another part of the [[History of the Soviet Union (1953–1985)|De-Stalinization]], which began in 1956, when [[Lenin's Testament]] was published.

====''Glasnost''====
{{main|Glasnost}}

1988 would see Gorbachev's introduction of ''glasnost'', which gave new freedoms to the Soviet people, including greater freedom of speech. This was a radical change, as control of speech and suppression of government criticism had previously been a central part of the Soviet system.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} The press became far less controlled, and thousands of political prisoners and many dissidents were released. Gorbachev's goal in undertaking ''glasnost'' was to pressure conservatives within the CPSU who opposed his policies of economic restructuring, and he also hoped that through different ranges of openness, debate and participation, the Soviet people would support his reform initiatives. At the same time, he opened himself and his reforms up for more public criticism, evident in [[Nina Andreyeva]]'s critical letter in a March edition of ''[[Sovetskaya Rossiya]]''.&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt; Gorbachev acknowledged that his liberalising policies of ''glasnost'' and ''perestroika'' owed a great deal to [[Alexander Dubček]]'s &quot;Socialism with a human face&quot;.

The [[Law on Cooperatives]] enacted in May 1988 was perhaps the most radical of the economic reforms during the early part of the Gorbachev era. For the first time since [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s [[New Economic Policy]], the law permitted private ownership of businesses in the service, manufacturing, and foreign-trade sectors. The law initially imposed high taxes and employment restrictions, although these were ignored by some SSRs. Later the restrictions were revised to avoid discouraging private-sector activity. Under the provision for private ownership, cooperative restaurants, shops, and manufacturers became part of the Soviet scene. Under the new law, the restructuring of large 'All-Union' industrial organisations also began. [[Aeroflot]] was split up, eventually becoming several independent airlines. These newly autonomous business organisations were encouraged to seek foreign investment.

In June 1988, at the CPSU's Party Conference, Gorbachev launched radical reforms meant to reduce party control of the government apparatus. He proposed a new executive in the form of a presidential system, as well as a new legislative element, to be called the [[Congress of People's Deputies]].&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt; Elections to the Congress of People's Deputies were held throughout the Soviet Union in March and April 1989. This was the first free election in the Soviet Union since 1917. Gorbachev became [[List of leaders of the Soviet Union|Chairman of the Supreme Soviet]] (or head of state) on 25 May 1989.

===Presidency of the USSR===
On 15 March 1990, Gorbachev was elected as the first executive [[President of the Soviet Union]]&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt; with 59% of the Deputies' votes being an unopposed candidate. The Congress met for the first time on 25 May in order to elect representatives from Congress to sit on the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. Nonetheless, the Congress posed problems for Gorbachev; its sessions were televised, airing more criticism and encouraging people to expect ever more rapid reform. In the elections, many Party candidates were defeated. Furthermore, [[Boris Yeltsin]] was elected in Moscow and returned to political prominence to become an increasingly vocal critic of Gorbachev.&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;

====Foreign engagements====
[[File:Ceausescu &amp; Gorbachev 1985.jpg|thumb|Gorbachev meets Romanian leader [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], 1985]]
In contrast to his controversial domestic reforms, Gorbachev was largely hailed in the West for his 'New Thinking' in foreign affairs. During his tenure, he sought to improve relations and trade with the West by reducing Cold War tensions. He established close relationships with several Western leaders, such as West German Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]], U.S. President Ronald Reagan, and British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]—who famously remarked: &quot;I like Mr. Gorbachev; we can do business together.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

Gorbachev understood the link between achieving international détente and domestic reform and thus began extending 'New Thinking' abroad immediately. On 8 April 1985, he announced the suspension of the deployment of [[RT-21M Pioneer|SS-20s]] in Europe as a move towards resolving intermediate-range nuclear weapons (INF) issues. Later that year, in September, Gorbachev proposed that the Soviets and Americans both cut their nuclear arsenals in half. He went to France on his first trip abroad as Soviet leader in October. November saw the [[Geneva Summit (1985)|Geneva Summit]] between Gorbachev and Ronald Reagan. Though no concrete agreement was made, Gorbachev and Reagan struck a personal relationship and decided to hold further meetings.&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;

January 1986 would see Gorbachev make his boldest international move so far, when he announced his proposal for the elimination of intermediate-range [[nuclear weapons]] in Europe and his strategy for eliminating all nuclear weapons by the year 2000 (often referred to as the 'January Proposal'). He also began the process of withdrawing troops from [[Democratic Republic of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] and [[People's Republic of Mongolia|Mongolia]] on 28 July.&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt; Nonetheless, many observers, such as [[Jack F. Matlock, Jr.|Jack F. Matlock Jr.]] (despite generally praising Gorbachev as well as Reagan), have criticized Gorbachev for taking too long to achieve withdrawal from the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Afghanistan War]], citing it as an example of lingering elements of 'old thinking' in Gorbachev.&lt;ref name=Matlock&gt;Matlock, J. F. Jr., ''Reagan and Gorbachev: How the Cold War Ended'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as [[The Heritage Foundation|Heritage Foundation]] foreign policy analyst Michael Johns, criticized Gorbachev's military support for the [[Ethiopia]]n regime of [[Mengistu Haile Mariam]], which Johns argued was a contributing factor to Ethiopia's mass famine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unz.org/Pub/PolicyRev-1988q3-00074 &quot;Gorbachev's Holocaust: Soviet Complicity in Ethiopia's Famine&quot;], by Michael Johns, ''Policy Review'', The Heritage Foundation, Summer 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 October 1986, Gorbachev and Reagan met in [[Reykjavík]], Iceland at [[Höfði]] to discuss reducing intermediate-range nuclear weapons in Europe. To the immense surprise of both men's advisers, the two agreed in principle to removing INF systems from Europe and to equal global limits of 100 INF missile warheads. They also essentially agreed in principle to eliminate all nuclear weapons in 10 years (by 1996), instead of by the year 2000 as in Gorbachev's original outline.&lt;ref name=Matlock/&gt; Continuing trust issues, particularly over reciprocity and Reagan's [[Strategic Defense Initiative|Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI)]], meant that the summit is often regarded as a failure for not producing a concrete agreement immediately, or for leading to a staged elimination of nuclear weapons. In the long term, nevertheless, this would culminate in the signing of the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty]] in 1987, after Gorbachev had proposed this elimination on 22 July 1987 (and it was subsequently agreed on in Geneva on 24 November).&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;

In February 1988, Gorbachev announced the full withdrawal of Soviet forces from Afghanistan. The withdrawal was completed the following year, although the civil war continued as the [[Mujahedin]] pushed to overthrow the pro-Soviet [[Mohammad Najibullah|Najibullah]] government.  An estimated 28,000 Soviets were killed between 1979 and 1989 as a result of the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Afghanistan War]].
[[File:Reagan and Gorbachev hold discussions.jpg|thumb|Gorbachev in one-on-one discussions with [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]]]
Also during 1988, Gorbachev announced that the Soviet Union would abandon the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], and allow the [[Eastern bloc]] nations to freely determine their own internal affairs. Jokingly dubbed the &quot;[[Sinatra Doctrine]]&quot; by Gorbachev's Foreign Ministry spokesman [[Gennadi Gerasimov]], this policy of non-intervention in the affairs of the other [[Warsaw Pact]] states proved to be the most momentous of Gorbachev's foreign policy reforms. In his 6 July 1989 speech arguing for a &quot;[[common European home]]&quot; before the [[Council of Europe]] in [[Strasbourg]], France, Gorbachev declared: &quot;The social and political order in some countries changed in the past, and it can change in the future too, but this is entirely a matter for each people to decide. Any interference in the internal affairs, or any attempt to limit the sovereignty of another state, friend, ally, or another, would be inadmissible.&quot; A month earlier, on 4 June 1989, elections had taken place in Poland and the communist government had already been deposed.

Moscow's abandonment of the Brezhnev Doctrine allowed the rise of popular upheavals in Eastern Europe throughout 1989, in which Communism was overthrown. By the end of 1989, revolts had spread from one Eastern European capital to another, ousting the regimes built in Eastern Europe after World War II. With the exception of Romania, the popular upheavals against the pro-Soviet Communist regimes were all peaceful ones (''see [[Revolutions of 1989]]''). The loosening of Soviet hegemony over Eastern Europe effectively ended the Cold War, and for this, Gorbachev was awarded the [[Otto Hahn Peace Medal|Otto Hahn Peace Medal in Gold]] in 1989 and the Nobel Peace Prize on 15 October 1990.

The rest of 1989 was taken up by the increasingly problematic nationalities question and the dramatic fragmentation of the Eastern Bloc. Despite international détente reaching unprecedented levels, with the Soviet withdrawal from [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] completed in January and U.S.-Soviet talks continuing between Gorbachev and [[George H. W. Bush]], domestic reforms were suffering from increasing divergence between reformists, who criticised the pace of change, and conservatives, who criticized the extent of change. Gorbachev states that he tried to find the middle ground between both groups, but this would draw more criticism towards him.&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt; The story from this point on moves away from reforms and becomes one of the nationalities question and the eventual dissolution of the Soviet Union.

On 9 November, people in the German Democratic Republic ([[East Germany]]/GDR) were suddenly allowed to cross through the [[Berlin Wall]] into West Berlin, following a peaceful protest against the country's dictatorial administration, including a demonstration by some one million people in [[East Berlin]] on 4 November. Unlike earlier riots which were ended by military force with the help of USSR, Gorbachev, who came to be lovingly called &quot;Gorby&quot; in West Germany, now decided not to interfere with the process in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSTRE5A23TB20091103|title=Reuters, Moscow could have started WW3 over Berlin Wall: Gorbachev by Guy Faulconbridge|date=3 November 2009|publisher=Reuters |accessdate=11 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that German reunification was an internal German matter.

[[File:Gorbachev Bush 19900601.jpg|thumb|Gorbachev and [[George H. W. Bush]], 1990]]
[[Coit D. Blacker]] wrote in 1990 that the Soviet leadership &quot;appeared to have believed that whatever loss of authority the Soviet Union might suffer in Eastern Europe would be more than offset by a net increase in its influence in Western Europe.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fa90&quot;&gt;Coit D. Blacker. &quot;The Collapse of Soviet Power in Europe.&quot; ''Foreign Affairs.'' 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Gorbachev ever intended for the complete dismantling of Communism in the Warsaw Pact countries. Rather, he assumed that the Communist parties of Eastern Europe could be reformed in a similar way to the reforms he hoped to achieve in the CPSU. Just as ''perestroika'' was aimed at making the USSR more efficient economically and politically, Gorbachev believed that the [[Comecon]] and Warsaw Pact could be reformed into more effective entities. Alexander Yakovlev, a close advisor to Gorbachev, would later state that it would have been &quot;absurd to keep the system&quot; in Eastern Europe. In contrast to Gorbachev, Yakovlev had come to the conclusion that the Soviet-dominated Comecon was inherently unworkable and that the Warsaw Pact had &quot;no relevance to real life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Steele&quot;&gt;Steele, Jonathan. Eternal Russia: Yeltsin, Gorbachev and the Mirage of Democracy. Boston: Faber, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dissolution of the Soviet Union====
{{Main|Dissolution of the Soviet Union}}

While Gorbachev's political initiatives were positive for [[Freedom (political)|freedom]] and democracy in the Soviet Union and its Eastern bloc allies, the economic policy of his government gradually brought the country close to disaster.  By the end of the 1980s, severe shortages of basic food supplies (meat, sugar) led to the reintroduction of the war-time system of distribution using food cards that limited each citizen to a certain amount of product per month. Compared to 1985, the state deficit grew from 0 to 109&amp;nbsp;billion rubles; gold funds decreased from 2,000 to 200 tons; and external debt grew from 0 to 120&amp;nbsp;billion dollars.

Furthermore, the [[Democratisation in the Soviet Union|democratisation]] of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe had irreparably undermined the power of the CPSU and Gorbachev himself. The relaxation of censorship and attempts to create more political openness had the unintended effect of re-awakening long-suppressed nationalist and anti-Russian feelings in the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Soviet republics]]. Calls for greater independence from Moscow's rule grew louder, especially in the Baltic republics of Lithuania, Latvia, and Estonia which had been annexed into the Soviet Union by Joseph Stalin in 1940. Nationalist feeling also took hold in Georgia, Ukraine, Armenia and Azerbaijan.

In December 1986, the first signs of the nationalities problem that would haunt the later years of the Soviet Union's existence surfaced as riots, named Jeltoqsan, occurred in [[Almaty|Alma Ata]] and other areas of Kazakhstan after Dinmukhamed Kunayev was replaced as First Secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan. Nationalism would then surface in Russia in May 1987, as 600 members of [[Pamyat]], a nascent Russian nationalist group, demonstrated in Moscow and were becoming increasingly linked to Boris Yeltsin, who received their representatives at a meeting.&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;

Glasnost hastened awareness of the national sovereignty problem. The free flow of information had been so completely suppressed for so long in the Soviet Union that many of the ruling class had all but forgotten that the Soviet Union was an empire conquered through military force and consolidated by the persecution of millions of people, and not a union voluntarily entered into by local populations. Thus, the extremity of local desire for independent control of their own affairs took these leaders by surprise, and the leaders were unprepared for the depth of the long pent-up feelings that were released.

Violence erupted in Nagorno-Karabakh—an Armenian-populated enclave of Azerbaijan—between February and April, when Armenians living in the area began a new wave of demands to transfer of [[NKAO]] from Azerbaijan to Armenia which eventually led to full scale [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;karabagh&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/am.html |title= CIA&amp;nbsp;– The World Factbook&amp;nbsp;– Armenia |accessdate=27 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorbachev imposed a temporary solution, but it did not last, as fresh trouble arose in Nagorno-Karabakh between June and July. Turmoil would once again return in late 1988, this time in Armenia itself, when the [[Leninakan Earthquake]] hit the region on 7 December. Poor local infrastructure magnified the hazard and some 25,000 people died.&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt; Gorbachev was forced to break off his trip to the U.S. and cancel planned travels to Cuba and Britain.&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;

In [[Soviet Union legislative election, 1989|March and April 1989 elections]] to the Congress of People's Deputies took place throughout the Soviet Union. This returned many pro-independence republicans, as many CPSU candidates were rejected. The televised Congress debates allowed the dissemination of pro-independence propositions. Indeed, 1989 would see numerous nationalistic protests; for example, beginning with the Baltic republics in January, laws were passed in most non-Russian republics giving precedence for the local language over Russian.

[[9 April tragedy|9 April]] would see the crackdown of nationalist demonstrations by Soviet troops in [[Tbilisi]]. There would be further bloody protests in Uzbekistan in June, where Uzbeks and Meskhetian Turks clashed in Fergana. Apart from this violence, three major events that altered the face of the nationalities issue occurred in 1989. [[Estonian Sovereignty Declaration|Estonia had declared its sovereignty]] on 16 November 1988, to be followed by Lithuania in May 1989 and by Latvia in July (the [[Communist Party of Lithuania]] would also declare its independence from the CPSU in December). This brought the Union and the republics into clear confrontation and would form a precedent for other republics.

Around the fiftieth anniversary of the signing of the 1939 [[Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]] in July 1989, the Soviet government formally acknowledged that the plan had included the inclusion of the Baltic states into the Soviet sphere of influence, which preceded and paved the way for their annexation into the USSR in 1940. The revelation supported the long-denied proposition that the Baltic states had been involuntarily brought into the Soviet Union and substantially boosted the Baltic aspirations to re-establish their independence. Finally, the Eastern bloc fragmented in the autumn of 1989, raising hopes that Gorbachev would extend his non-interventionist doctrine to the internal workings of the USSR.&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;

=====Crisis of the Union: 1990–1991=====
[[File:Gorbachev (cropped) 186420.jpg|thumb|Gorbachev in 1990]]
1990 began with nationalist turmoil in January. Azerbaijanis rioted and troops were sent in to restore order; many [[Moldova]]ns demonstrated in favour of unification with post-Communist Romania; and Lithuanian demonstrations continued. The same month, in a hugely significant move, Armenia asserted its right to veto laws coming from the All-Union level, thus intensifying the 'war of laws' between republics and Moscow.&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;

Soon after, the CPSU, which had already lost much of its control, began to lose even more power as Gorbachev deepened political reform. The February Central Committee Plenum advocated multi-party elections; local elections held between February and March returned a large number of pro-independence candidates. The Congress of People's Deputies then amended the Soviet Constitution in March, removing Article 6, which guaranteed the monopoly of the CPSU. The process of political reform was therefore coming from above and below, and was gaining a momentum that would augment republican nationalism. Soon after the constitutional amendment, Lithuania declared independence and elected [[Vytautas Landsbergis]] as Chairman of the [[Lithuanian Supreme Council|Supreme Council]] (head of state).&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;

On 15 March, Gorbachev himself was elected as the only President of the Soviet Union by the Congress of People's Deputies and chose a [[Presidential Council (USSR)|Presidential Council]] of 15 politicians. Gorbachev was essentially creating his own political support base independent of CPSU conservatives and radical reformers. The new Executive was designed to be a powerful position to guide the spiraling reform process, and the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union and Congress of People's Deputies had already given Gorbachev increasingly presidential powers in February. This would be again a source of criticism from reformers. Despite the apparent increase in Gorbachev's power, he was unable to stop the process of nationalistic assertion. Further embarrassing facts about Soviet history were revealed in April, when the government admitted that the [[NKVD]] had carried out the infamous [[Katyn Massacre]] of Polish army officers during World War II; previously, the USSR had blamed [[National Socialist German Workers Party|Nazi Germany]]. More significantly for Gorbachev's position, Boris Yeltsin was reaching a new level of prominence, as he was elected [[Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR]] in May, effectively making him the de jure leader of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]]. Problems for Gorbachev would once more come from the Russian parliament in June, when it declared the precedence of Russian laws over All-Union level legislation.&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;

Gorbachev's personal position continued changing. At the [[28th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|28th CPSU Congress]] in July, Gorbachev was re-elected General Secretary but this position was now completely independent of Soviet government, and the Politburo had no say in the ruling of the country. Gorbachev further reduced Party power in the same month, when he issued a decree abolishing Party control of all areas of the media and broadcasting. At the same time, Gorbachev was working to consolidate his presidential position, culminating in the Supreme Soviet granting him special powers to rule by decree in September in order to pass a much-needed plan for transition to a market economy. However, the Supreme Soviet could not agree on which program to adopt. Gorbachev pressed on with political reform, his proposal for setting up a new Soviet government, with a Soviet of the Federation consisting of representatives from all 15 republics, was passed through the Supreme Soviet in November. In December, Gorbachev was once more granted increased executive power by the Supreme Soviet, arguing that such moves were necessary to counter &quot;the dark forces of nationalism&quot;. Such moves led to Eduard Shevardnadze's resignation; Gorbachev's former ally warned of an impending dictatorship. This move was a serious blow to Gorbachev personally and to his efforts for reform.&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;

Meanwhile, Gorbachev was losing further ground to nationalists. October 1990 saw the founding of [[Democratic Russia|DemRossiya]], the Russian pro-reform coalition; a few days later, both Ukraine and Russia declared their laws completely sovereign over Soviet level laws. The 'war of laws' had become an open battle, with the Supreme Soviet refusing to recognise the actions of the two republics. Gorbachev would publish the draft of a new union treaty in November, which envisioned a continued union called the [[Union of Sovereign States|Union of Sovereign Soviet Republics]], but, going into 1991, the actions of Gorbachev were steadily being overtaken by the centrifugal secessionist forces.&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;

[[File:MSPyGorbachov.jpg|thumb|right|Gorbachev with the Spanish Prime Minister [[Felipe Gonzalez]], 1990]]
January and February would see a new level of turmoil in the [[Baltic republics]]. On 10 January 1991 Gorbachev issued an ultimatum-like request&lt;ref&gt;DR Radio reported 12/01 in its news broadcast on P3 at 13:00 hrs that the Ultimatum required a reply within 3 days&lt;/ref&gt; addressing the Lithuanian Supreme Council demanding the restoration of the validity of the constitution of the Soviet Union in Lithuania and the revoking of all anti-constitutional laws. In his ''Memoirs'', Gorbachev asserts that, on 12 January, he convened the Council of the Federation and political measures to prevent bloodshed were agreed, including sending representatives of the Council of the Federation on a &quot;fact-finding mission&quot; to [[Vilnius]]. However, before the delegation arrived, the local branches of the [[KGB]] and armed forces had worked together to seize the TV tower in Vilnius; Gorbachev asked the heads of the KGB and military if they had approved such action, and there is no evidence that they, or Gorbachev, ever approved this move. Gorbachev cites documents found in the RSFSR Prokuratura after the August coup, which only mentioned that &quot;some 'authorities'&quot; had sanctioned the actions.&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;

A book called ''Alpha&amp;nbsp;– the KGB's Top Secret Unit'' also suggests that a &quot;KGB operation co-ordinated with the military&quot; was undertaken by the KGB [[Alpha Group]].&lt;ref name=Alpha&gt;Boltunov, M., ''Alfa&amp;nbsp;– Sverkhsekretnyi Otryad KGB [Alpha&amp;nbsp;– The KGB's Top-Secret Unit]'', 1992, (Moscow: Kedr)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archie Brown]], in ''The Gorbachev Factor'', uses the memoirs of many people around Gorbachev and in the upper echelons of the Soviet political landscape, to implicate General [[Valentin Varennikov]], a member of the August coup plotters, and General [[Viktor Achalov]], another August coup conspirator. These persons were characterised as individuals &quot;who were prepared to remove Gorbachev from his presidential office unconstitutionally&quot; and &quot;were more than capable of using unauthorised violence against nationalist separatists some months earlier&quot;. [[Archie Brown|Brown]] criticises Gorbachev for &quot;a conscious tilt in the direction of the conservative forces he was trying to keep within an increasingly fragile coalition&quot; who would later betray him; he also criticises Gorbachev &quot;for his tougher line and heightened rhetoric against the Lithuanians in the days preceding the attack and for his slowness in condemning the killings&quot; but notes that Gorbachev did not approve any action and was seeking political solutions.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;Brown, A., ''The Gorbachev Factor'', 1996, (New York: Oxford University Press).   ISBN 0-19-288052-7&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of continued violence, at least 14 civilians were killed and more than 600 injured from 11–13 January 1991 in Vilnius, Lithuania. The strong Western reaction and the actions of Russian democratic forces put the president and government of the Soviet Union into an awkward situation, as news of support for Lithuanians from Western democracies started to appear. Further problems surfaced in [[Riga]], Latvia, on 20 and 21 January, where OMON (special Ministry of the Interior) troops killed 4 people. Archie Brown suggests that Gorbachev's response this time was better, condemning the rogue action, sending his condolences and suggesting that secession could take place if it went through the procedures outlined in the Soviet constitution. According to Gorbachev's aide, Shakhnazarov (quoted by Archie Brown), Gorbachev was finally beginning to accept the inevitability of &quot;losing&quot; the Baltic republics, although he would try all political means to preserve the Union. Brown believes that this put him in &quot;imminent danger&quot; of being overthrown by hard-liners against the secession.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt;

Gorbachev thus continued to draw up a new treaty of union which would have created a truly voluntary federation in an increasingly democratised Soviet Union. The new treaty was strongly supported by the Central Asian republics, who needed the economic power and markets of the Soviet Union to prosper. However, the more radical reformists, such as Russian SFSR President Boris Yeltsin, were increasingly convinced that a rapid transition to a market economy was required and were more than happy to contemplate the disintegration of the Soviet Union if that was required to achieve their aims. Nevertheless, a referendum on the future of the Soviet Union was held in March (with a referendum in Russia on the creation of a presidency), which returned an average of 76.4% in the nine republics where it was taken, with a turn-out of 80% of the adult population.&lt;ref name=Brown/&gt; Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Armenia, Georgia and Moldova did not participate. Following this, an April meeting at [[Novo-Ogarevo]] between Gorbachev and the heads of the nine republics issued a statement on speeding up the creation of a new Union treaty.

In May, a hardline newspaper published “[[Architect amidst the Ruins]]”, an [[open letter]] criticizing Yakovlev (often referred to as the Architect of Perestroika) which was signed by [[Gennady Zyuganov]]. Many also saw this publication as the start of a campaign to oust Gorbachev.

Meanwhile, on 12 June 1991 Boris Yeltsin was elected [[President of the Russian Federation]] by 57.3% of the vote (with a turnout of 74%).&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;

=====The August 1991 coup=====
{{Main|Soviet coup attempt of 1991}}
In contrast to the reformers' moderate approach to the new treaty, the hard-line [[apparatchik]]s, still strong within the CPSU and military establishment, were completely opposed to anything which might lead to the break-up of the Soviet Union. On the eve of the treaty's signing,
hardliners in the Soviet leadership, calling themselves the '[[Soviet coup attempt of 1991#The August Coup|State Emergency Committee]]', launched the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|August coup]] in 1991 in an attempt to remove Gorbachev from power and prevent the signing of the new union treaty. During this time, Gorbachev spent three days (19, 20 and 21 August) under house arrest at a [[dacha]] in the [[Crimea]] before being freed and restored to power. However, upon his return, Gorbachev found that neither union nor Russian power structures heeded his commands as support had swung over to Yeltsin, whose defiance had led to the coup's collapse.

Furthermore, Gorbachev was forced to fire large numbers of his Politburo and, in several cases, arrest them. Those arrested for high treason included the &quot;[[Gang of Eight (Soviet Union)|Gang of Eight]]&quot; that had led the coup, including [[Vladimir Kryuchkov|Kryuchkov]], [[Dmitriy Yazov|Yazov]], [[Valentin Pavlov|Pavlov]] and [[Gennady Yanayev|Yanayev]]. [[Boris Pugo|Pugo]] was found shot; and [[Sergei Akhromeyev|Akhromeyev]], who had offered his assistance but was never implicated, was found hanging in his Kremlin office. Most of these men had been former allies of Gorbachev's or promoted by him, which drew fresh criticism.

=====Aftermath of the coup and the final collapse=====
For all intents and purposes, the coup was the end politically for Gorbachev.  On 24 August, Gorbachev advised the Central Committee to dissolve, resigned as General Secretary and disbanded all party units within the government.  Shortly afterward, the Supreme Soviet suspended all Party activities on Soviet territory.  In effect, Communist rule in the Soviet Union had ended--thus eliminating the only unifying force left in the country.

Gorbachev's hopes of a new Union were further hit when the Congress of People's Deputies dissolved itself on 5 September. Though Gorbachev and the representatives of eight republics (excluding Azerbaijan, Georgia, Moldova, Ukraine, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia) signed an agreement on forming a new economic community on 18 October, events were overtaking Gorbachev.&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;  The Soviet Union collapsed with dramatic speed during the fall of 1991, as one republic after another declared independence.  By the start of fall, Gorbachev could no longer influence events outside of Moscow, and he was challenged even there by Yeltsin.  Following the coup, Yeltsin suspended all CPSU activities on Russian territory and closed the [[Central Committee]] building at [[Staraya Square]]. He also ordered the [[Flag of Russia|Russian flag]] raised alongside the Soviet flag at the [[Kremlin]].  As the fall of 1991 wore on, Russia began taking over what remained of the Soviet government, including the Kremlin.

With the country in a rapid state of deterioration, the final blow to Gorbachev's vision was effectively dealt by a [[Ukrainian independence referendum, 1991|Ukrainian referendum]] on 1 December, where the Ukrainian people voted for independence.  Ukraine had been the second most powerful republic in the Soviet Union after Russia, and its secession ended any realistic chance of the Soviet Union staying united even on a limited scale. The presidents of Russia, Ukraine and Belarus met in [[Belovezh Forest]], near [[Brest, Belarus]], on 8 December, founding the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] and declaring the end of the Soviet Union in the [[Belavezha Accords]]. Gorbachev initially denounced this move as illegal.  However, on 17 December, he accepted the ''fait accompli'' and reluctantly agreed with Yeltsin to dissolve the Soviet Union. Gorbachev resigned on 25 December and the Soviet Union was formally dissolved the following day. Two days after Gorbachev left office, on 27 December, Yeltsin moved into Gorbachev's old office.&lt;ref name=Memoirs/&gt;

Gorbachev had aimed to maintain the CPSU as a united party but move it in the direction of [[social democracy]]. But when the CPSU was proscribed after the August coup, Gorbachev was left with no effective power base beyond the armed forces. In the aftermath of the coup, his rival Yeltsin quickly worked to consolidate his hold on the Russian government as well as the remants of the Soviet armed forces, paving the way for Gorbachev's downfall.

==Post-Presidency==

Minister [[Brian Mulroney]] and former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher at the [[Death and State funeral of Ronald Reagan|funeral of Ronald Reagan]], 11 June 2004]]
Following his resignation and the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Gorbachev remained active in Russian politics. During the early years of the post-Soviet era, he expressed criticism at the reforms carried out by Russian president Boris Yeltsin. When Yeltsin called a referendum for 25 April 1993 in an attempt to achieve even greater powers as president, Gorbachev did not vote and instead called for new presidential elections.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maurizio Giuliano]], ''Müssen schnell wählen'' (interview), [[Profil (magazine)|Profil]], nr. 19. 10 May 1993, page 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a failed run for the presidency in 1996, Gorbachev established the Social Democratic Party of Russia, a union between several Russian social democratic parties. He resigned as party leader in May 2004 following a disagreement with the party's chairman over the direction taken in the [[Russian legislative election, 2003|2003 election campaign]]. The party was later banned in 2007 by the [[Supreme Court of the Russian Federation]] due to its failure to establish local offices with at least 500 members in the majority of Russian regions, which is required by Russian law for a political organization to be listed as a party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mosnews.com/news/2007/04/13/nogorbyparty.shtml Mosnews.com]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Gorbachev founded a new political party, called the Union of Social-Democrats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gorbachev sets up Russia movement&quot;/&gt; In June 2004, Gorbachev represented Russia at the [[State funeral of Ronald Reagan|funeral of Ronald Reagan]].

Gorbachev has also appeared in numerous media channels since his resignation from office. In 1993, Gorbachev appeared as himself in the [[Wim Wenders]] film ''[[Faraway, So Close!]]'', the sequel to ''[[Wings of Desire]]''. In 1997, Gorbachev appeared with his granddaughter Anastasia in an internationally screened television commercial for [[Pizza Hut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=“” |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C9lvzzH0STw |title=Pizza Hut&amp;nbsp;– Gorbachev |publisher=YouTube |date=1 April 2006 |accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. corporation's payment for the 60-second ad went to Gorbachev's not-for-profit [[Gorbachev Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=27472 ''Mikhail Gorbachev appears in Pizza Hut advertising campaign'', PRNewswire, 23 December 1997]. Retrieved 3 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, French luxury brand [[Louis Vuitton]] announced that Gorbachev would be shown in an ad campaign for their signature luggage.

Following Boris Yeltsin's death on 23 April 2007, Gorbachev released a eulogy for him, stating that Yeltsin was to be commended for assuming the &quot;difficult task of leading the nation into the post-Soviet era&quot;, and &quot;on whose shoulders are both great deeds for the country and serious errors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/04/23/world/main2716114.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Ex-Russian Leader Boris Yeltsin Dies | date=23 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 June 2009, Gorbachev announced that he had recorded an album of old Russian romantic ballads entitled ''Songs for Raisa'' to raise money for a charity dedicated to his late wife. On the album, he sings the songs himself accompanied by Russian musician [[Andrei Makarevich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Alexandra|last=Odynova|title=Former Soviet Leader Gorbachev Records Album|date=19 June 2009|url =http://www.sptimesrussia.com/index.php?action_id=2&amp;story_id=29283|work=The Saint Petersburg Times|accessdate =20 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his resignation, Gorbachev has remained involved in world affairs. He founded the [[Gorbachev Foundation]] in 1992, headquartered in San Francisco. He later founded [[Green Cross International]], with which he was one of three major sponsors of the [[Earth Charter]]. He also became a member of the [[Club of Rome]] and the [[Club of Madrid]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clubmadrid.org The Club of Madrid] is an independent non-profit organization composed of 81 democratic former presidents and Prime Ministers from 57 different countries. It constitutes the world´s largest forum of former Heads of State and Government, who have come together to respond to a growing demand for support among leaders in democratic leadership, governance, crisis and post-crisis situations. All lines of work share the common goal of building functional and inclusive societies, where the leadership experience of the members is most valuable.&lt;/ref&gt; an independent non-profit organization composed of 81 democratic former presidents and Prime Ministers from 57 different countries.

In the decade that followed the Cold War, Gorbachev opposed both the U.S.-led [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]] in 1999 and the U.S.-led [[Iraq War]] in 2003. On 27 July 2007, Gorbachev criticized [[American foreign policy|U.S. foreign policy]]: “What has followed are unilateral actions, what has followed are wars, what has followed is ignoring the UN Security Council, ignoring international law and ignoring the will of the people, even the American people,” he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19994563/|title = Gorbachev says U.S. is sowing world ‘disorder’|publisher=MSNBC|accessdate =4 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he visited [[New Orleans]], a city hard-hit by [[Hurricane Katrina]], and promised he would return in 2011 to personally lead a local revolution if the U.S. government had not repaired the levees by that time. He said that revolutionary action should be a last resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2007/10/09/gorbachev-vows-revolution_n_67679.html|title = Gorbachev Vows Revolution If New Orleans Levees Don't Improve|work=The Huffington Post| accessdate =14 September 2007|first=Nico|last=Pitney}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Barack Obama &amp; Joe Biden with Mikhail Gorbachev 3-20.09.jpg|thumb|right|Gorbachev (right) being introduced to [[Barack Obama]] by [[Joe Biden]], 20 March 2009]]
Concerning the [[2008 South Ossetia war]], in a 12 August 2008 op-ed essay in ''[[The Washington Post]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/08/11/AR2008081101372.html|title=A Path to Peace in the Caucasus|work=Washington Post|date=12 August 2008|accessdate=12 August 2008|first=Mikhail|last=Gorbachev}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorbachev criticized the U.S. support for Georgian President [[Mikheil Saakashvili]] and for moving to bring the [[Caucasus]] into the sphere of its national interest. He later said the following:

{{quote|Russia did not want this crisis. The Russian leadership is in a strong enough position domestically; it did not need a little victorious war. Russia was dragged into the fray by the recklessness of the Georgian president, Mikheil Saakashvili.... The decision by the Russian president, [[Dmitri Medvedev]], to now cease hostilities was the right move by a responsible leader. The Russian president acted calmly, confidently and firmly... The planners of this campaign clearly wanted to make sure that, whatever the outcome, Russia would be blamed for worsening the situation. The West then mounted a propaganda attack against Russia, with the American news media leading the way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gorbachev, Mikhail.

In September 2008 Gorbachev announced he would make a comeback to Russian politics along with a former KGB officer, Alexander Lebedev.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Blomfield |first=Adrian |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/3104623/Mikhail-Gorbachev-returns-to-Russian-politics.html |title=Mikhail Gorbachev returns to Russian politics |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=29 September 2008 |accessdate=3 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their party is known as the Independent Democratic Party of Russia. He also is part owner of the opposition newspaper ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.grani.ru/Society/Media/m.106813.html |title=Лебедев и Горбачев стали совладельцами Новой газеты |publisher=grani.ru |date=7 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 March 2009, Gorbachev met with United States President [[Barack Obama]] and Vice President [[Joe Biden]] in efforts to &quot;reset&quot; strained relations between Russia and the United States.

On 27 March 2009, Gorbachev visited [[Eureka College]], Illinois, which is the alma mater of former U.S.  president Ronald W. Reagan with whom he negotiated historic nuclear arms reduction treaties. Gorbachev toured the Reagan Museum on campus, met with students, and spoke at a convocation in the Reagan Center; he then traveled to the nearby Peoria Civic Center in [[Peoria, Illinois]] as the keynote speaker at the combined George Washington/Ronald Reagan Day Dinner where college president Dr. J. David Arnold named him an Honorary Reagan Fellow of Eureka College.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.centralillinoisnewscenter.com/news/local/42019457.html |accessdate=24 March 2009 |title=Gorbachev Visits Eureka College |first=Gina |last=Morss |work=WEEK News 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]], Gorbachev accompanied former Polish leader [[Lech Wałęsa]] and German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] at a celebration in Berlin on 9 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/10/world/europe/10germany.html |title=Leaders in Berlin Retrace the Walk West |newspaper=New York Times |date=9 November 2009 |first=Nicholas |last=Kulish |first2=Judy |last2=Dempsey |lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2010, Gorbachev gave an interview before an &quot;almost an annual pilgrimage&quot; to London for a summer gala  to raise money for The Raisa Gorbachev Foundation, which funds cancer care for children. The clinic in St. Petersburg can house 80 child patients.
From the Interview:
&quot;Her death, after several years of ill-health, left Gorbachev bereft. He lives in Moscow, has not remarried and finds solace with his daughter and grand-daughters.
He would not be coaxed to talk about Raisa, except fleetingly in the context of the charity. &quot;

===Criticism of Vladimir Putin===
Although he has credited [[Vladimir Putin]] for stabilizing Russia in the aftermath of the initial and turbulent years of the post-Soviet era, Gorbachev has become critical of both Putin and his successor (and predecessor) [[Dmitry Medvedev]] since at least March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Latest-News-Wires/2011/0302/Mikhail-Gorbachev-says-Putin-should-not-run-for-Russian-presidency-again Mikhail Gorbachev says Putin should not run for Russian presidency again]. CSMonitor.com (2 March 2011). Retrieved on 9 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; His main grievances about the &quot;tandem&quot; are backsliding on democracy, corruption and the dominance of security officers. Gorbachev is also dissatisfied by the fact that he has not been allowed to register his social democratic party.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svobodanews.ru/content/article/2310014.html Михаил Горбачев – про &quot;дуумвират&quot; и &quot;штаны мотней назад&quot; (видео). Радио Свобода. 15.02.2011]. Svobodanews.ru. Retrieved on 9 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

When being interviewed by the BBC to reflect on the 20th anniversary of the [[August Coup]], Gorbachev again announced his dissatisfaction with the policies and rule of Putin. Speaking of the status of democracy in the Russian Federation, he proclaimed: &quot;The electoral system we had was nothing remarkable but they have literally castrated it.&quot; Gorbachev also stated that he believes Putin should not seek a third term as the Russian president in 2012.&lt;ref name=BBCGorbachevInterview&gt;{{cite news|title=Gorbachev says Putin 'castrated' democracy in Russia|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-14580709|publisher=BBC News |accessdate=18 August 2011|date=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the [[2011 Russian protests]] as a result of [[United Russia]]'s controversial victory in the [[Russian legislative election, 2011]], he called on the authorities to hold a new election, citing electoral irregularities and ballot box stuffing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/12/07/russia-update-1-tv-pix-idUSL5E7N73K320111207 UPDATE 1-Russian police block new anti-Putin rally]. Reuters (5 December 2011). Retrieved on 9 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Call for global restructuring==
Gorbachev calls for a kind of perestroika or restructuring of societies around the world, starting in particular with that of the United States, because he is of the view that the [[late-2000s financial crisis]] shows that the [[Washington Consensus]] economic model is a failure that will sooner or later have to be replaced. According to Gorbachev, countries that have rejected the Washington consensus and the [[International Monetary Fund]] approach to economic development, such as Brazil and China, have done far better economically on the whole and achieved far more fair results for the average citizen, than countries that have accepted it.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, 7 June 2009,  &quot;We Had Our Perestroika. It's High Time for Yours&quot; Op-ed piece by Mikhail Gorbachev&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorbachev is also a member of the Club de Madrid, a group of more than 80 former leaders of democratic countries, which works to strengthen democratic governance and leadership.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.clubmadrid.org/en/miembro/mikhail_gorbachev/programas&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religious affiliation==
Gorbachev was baptised in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] as a child.

At the end of a November 1996 interview on CSPAN's Booknotes, Gorbachev described his plans for future books. He made the following reference to God: &quot;I don't know how many years God will be giving me, [or] what His plans are.&quot;

In 2005, he said that Pope [[John Paul II]]'s &quot;devotion to his followers is a remarkable example to all of us&quot; following the pontiff's death. &quot;What can I say—it must have been the will of God. He acted really courageously.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/04/03/pope.gorbachev/ |title=Gorbachev: Pope was 'example to all of us' |publisher=CNN  |date=4 April 2005 |accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1989 meeting, he had told him &quot;We appreciate your mission on this high pulpit, we are convinced that it will leave a great mark on history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wilsoncenter.org/cwihp/documentreaders/eotcw/891201a.pdf |title=Record of Conversation between M.S.

Gorbachev was the recipient of the Athenagoras Humanitarian Award of the [[Archons of the Ecumenical Patriarchate|Order of St. Andrew Archons]] of the [[Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople]] on 20 November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goarch.org/news/goa.news1476 Athenagoras humanitarian award to Nobel peace prize laureate Mikhail Gorbachev]. goarch.org. 2 November 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 March 2008, during a surprise visit to pray at the tomb of [[St Francis of Assisi|Saint Francis]] in [[Assisi, Italy|Assisi]], Italy, Gorbachev made an announcement which has been interpreted to the effect that he was a Christian. Gorbachev stated that &quot;St Francis is, for me, the ''[[alter Christus]]'', another Christ. His story fascinates me and has played a fundamental role in my life.&quot; He added, &quot;It was through St Francis that I arrived at the Church, so it was important that I came to visit his tomb.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Mikhail Gorbachev admits he is a Christian|work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London|date = 19 March 2008|url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/03/19/wgorbachev119.xml|accessdate =24 March 2008|first=Malcolm|last=Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, a few days later, he reportedly told the Russian news agency [[Interfax]], &quot;Over the last few days some media have been disseminating fantasies—I can't use any other word—about my secret Catholicism, [...] To sum up and avoid any misunderstandings, let me say that I have been and remain an atheist.&quot;&lt;ref name=ChiTrib2008-03-23&gt;{{Cite news|title = Gorbachev a closet Christian?|work=Chicago Tribune |date = 23 March 2008 |

He is still on his way to Christianity. If he arrives, we will welcome him.&quot;&lt;ref name=ChiTrib2008-03-23/&gt;

==Naevus flammeus==

Though some suggested that he might have his prominent [[naevus flammeus|port wine birthmark]] surgically removed, Gorbachev opted not to, as once he was publicly known to have the mark, he believed it would be perceived as his being more concerned with his appearance than other more important issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;dr2&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode|title= den 11. time|url = http://www.dr.dk/odp/player.aspx?guid=D7C084E0-19DB-4131-8FB0-347755C011A7&amp;surl=http%3A//www.dr.dk/Forms/Published/PlaylistGen.aspx%3Fqid%3D523179%26odp%3Dtrue&amp;mt=programstab&amp;furl=default.aspx%3Ftemplate%3Dprogramserie%26guid%3D3975AA2F-D06B-4A99-BD9B-99BE197DB000%26autoplay%3D1%26back%3Ddefault.aspx%253ftemplate%253dprogrammer&amp;skin=default&amp;template=se_seneste&amp;guid=3975AA2F-D06B-4A99-BD9B-99BE197DB000
