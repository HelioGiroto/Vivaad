The '''Spice Girls''' are a British pop [[girl group]] formed in 1994. The group comprised five members, who each later adopted nicknames initially ascribed to them: [[Melanie Chisholm]] (&quot;Sporty Spice&quot;), [[Emma Bunton]] (&quot;Baby Spice&quot;), [[Melanie Brown]] (&quot;Scary Spice&quot;), [[Victoria Beckham]] (née Adams) (&quot;Posh Spice&quot;), and [[Geri Halliwell]] (&quot;Ginger Spice&quot;). They were signed to [[Virgin Records]] and released their debut single, &quot;[[Wannabe (song)|Wannabe]]&quot; in 1996, which hit number-one in more than 30 countries and helped establish the group as a global phenomenon. Credited for being the pioneers that paved the way for the commercial breakthrough of [[teen pop]] in the late 1990s, their debut album, ''[[Spice (album)|Spice]]'', sold more than 28 million copies worldwide,&lt;ref name=bbcnews2&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/talking_point/2771605.stm|title=Spice Girls reunion: Is a comeback possible?|publisher=BBC News|date=18 February 2003|accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Houston&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-162022/Spice-Girls-plan-reunion.html|title=Spice Girls Plan Reunion|publisher=Dailymail|accessdate=23 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the best-selling album by a female group in music history.

Measures of their success include international record sales, a [[Return of the Spice Girls|2007–2008 reunion tour]], merchandising, record-breaking achievements, iconic symbolism such as Halliwell's [[Union Jack dress]], representing &quot;[[Girl power|Girl Power]]&quot;, a box-office film, ''[[Spice World (film)|Spice World]]'', and their internationally recognised nicknames. The group became one of the most successful marketing engines ever,&lt;ref name=&quot;ewspice&quot; /&gt; with their global grosses estimated at $500–800 million between 1996 and 1998&lt;ref name=&quot;ewspice&quot; /&gt; and the group earning up to $75 million per year.&lt;ref name=&quot;gerirolling&quot;/&gt; Under the guidance of their mentor and manager [[Simon Fuller]], the group embraced merchandising and became a regular feature of the British and global press.

In 1996, ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' [[Top of the Pops (magazine)|magazine]] gave each member of the group [[Pseudonym|aliases]], which were adopted by the group and media. According to ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' journalist and biographer David Sinclair, &quot;Scary, Baby, Ginger, Posh and Sporty were the most widely recognised group of individuals since [[The Beatles|John, Paul, George, and Ringo]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; They were the biggest popular cultural icons of the 1990s, according to a survey carried out by ''[[Trivial Pursuit]]'', winning by 80 percent in a poll of 1,000 people, stating that &quot;Girl Power&quot; defined the decade. They are cited as part of the 'second wave' '90s British Invasion of the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wong |first=Sterling |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1661905/adele-mumford-and-sons-british-invasion.jhtml |title=Are Adele, Mumford And Sons Sign Of A New British Invasion? – Music, Celebrity, Artist News |publisher=MTV |date=13 April 2011 |accessdate=1 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1994–1996: Formation and early years===
[[File:Spice Girls Ad Crop.jpg|thumb| [[The Stage]] classified advertisement]]
In the mid-1990s, family management team [[Bob Herbert (manager)|Bob Herbert]], [[Chris Herbert]] and Lindsey Casbon set about creating a girl group to compete with popular [[boy band]]s that dominated the pop music scene in the mid- to late-1990s: &quot;The whole teen-band scene at the time was saturated by boy bands like [[Take That]] and [[East 17]]. That was all a bit of a yawn for me, and only appealed to female audiences...I felt if you could appeal to the boys as well, you'd be laughing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;?&quot;&gt;Spice Girls Official. [http://www.thespicegirls.com/facts/timeline Timeline]. Retrieved 16 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1994, Heart Management – which comprised the Herberts together with financier Chic Murphy – placed an advertisement in ''[[The Stage]]'' trade magazine asking &quot;''WANTED: R.U. 18–23 with the ability to sing/dance? R.U. streetwise, outgoing, ambitious, and dedicated? Heart Management Ltd. are a widely successful music industry management consortium currently forming a choreographed, singing/dancing, all-female pop act for a recording deal. Open audition.

[http://www.thespicegirls.com/facts/timeline Timeline]. Retrieved 16 March 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; About 400 women who answered the ad went to Dance Works studios. There, they were put into groups of 10 and danced a routine to &quot;Stay&quot; by [[Eternal (band)|Eternal]]. After that, the selection continued and the girls had to sing solo songs. Victoria Adams sang &quot;Mein Herr&quot;, Melanie Brown sang &quot;[[Greatest Love of All]]&quot;,  Melanie Chisholm sang &quot;[[I'm So Excited]]&quot;, [[Michelle Stephenson]] sang &quot;[[Don't Be a Stranger]]&quot;. After the auditions, the women returned home and waited for some weeks. Geri Halliwell had seen the ad but went skiing in Spain and missed the audition because her face got sunburnt.&lt;ref name=&quot;forums.denden.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forums.denden.co.uk/viewtopic.php?f=4&amp;t=158641 |title=Touch (Spice Girls) Auditions – Timeline |publisher=Forums.denden.co.uk |date=3 March 2008 |accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1994, the women got a call and were down to the last 12. They went to Nomis Studios, Shepherd's Bush. The women chosen were Suzanne Tinker (who did not attend), Melanie Laccohee, Lianne Morgan, Tracey Shield, Michelle Stephenson, Melanie Brown, Melanie Chisholm (who did not attend), Victoria Adams, and a few others. Geri Halliwell saw the ad after two months, and decided to call. The management let her in to the last 12, so she was one of them. After arriving, the women had a little solo interview, in which Halliwell sang &quot;I Wanna Be a Nightclub Queen&quot;. After the interviews, they were divided into 3 groups of four women and they created a routine for &quot;[[Just a Step from Heaven]]&quot; by Eternal. In one group there was Adams, Brown, Stephenson and Morgan. After a dance, Halliwell joined and she was taught their dance. Later, they sang solo songs and Brown sang &quot;[[Queen of the Night (song)|Queen of the Night]]&quot;. Those five were told they had been picked while they were having a cup of tea. After the auditions, the women returned home and waited a couple of weeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;forums.denden.co.uk&quot;/&gt; Tinker passed the first audition, but could not attend the second because her train was delayed due to a bomb scare, and she did not want to go in late. Chisholm passed the first audition, but could not attend the second because she had problems with her tonsils. Her mother called the management to ask for another chance and they told her they had whittled their choice down to ten women, including Chisholm. They said if they did not find the five or if there was one who they were not sure about, they would give her another chance.&lt;ref name=&quot;forums.denden.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

One week later, the women were called and asked to attend a recall. They were not sure how many women they wanted. If they had wanted four, one of them would have been picked out. They met again in Nomis Studios. Morgan received a letter and she was told she looked too old for the other women, and was replaced with Chisholm. The women had learned &quot;Signed, Sealed, Delivered&quot; and sang it on their own and in a group. They were finally selected and told they were going to be a band. Sunday of that week, they spent a week on a guest house in Surrey. The first afternoon, they went to Trinity Studios to learn &quot;Take Me Away&quot;. Pepi Lemer trained them for the week. After that week, they did a showcase for Murphy. Dressed in black and white in different combinations, they sang the song they had prepared &quot;Take Me Away&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;forums.denden.co.uk&quot;/&gt; The group was given the name Touch,&lt;ref name=&quot;?&quot;/&gt; and moved into a house together in [[Maidenhead]], Berkshire, (owned by Murphy) where they were subsidised by Heart Management. They spent the spring and summer rehearsing at a house in Boyn Hill Road, Maidenhead. Chisholm and Brown shared rooms, Adams and Stephenson shared a second bedroom and Halliwell had a small room to herself.

During the first two months the group worked on [[Demo (music)|demos]] at South Hill Park Recording Studios in Bracknell, Berkshire with producer/studio owner Michael Sparkes and song writer/arranger Tim Hawes. Most notably recording a track called Sugar and Spice, written by Tim Hawes and the source of their final band name. They also worked on various dance routines at the Trinity Studios in [[Knaphill]], near [[Woking]], Surrey. According to Stephenson the material the group was given was &quot;very, very young pop&quot; and included the song &quot;We're Gonna Make It Happen&quot;, a record that never came to light.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; It soon became apparent that Stephenson did not have the drive and belief that the rest of the group had, so the decision was made to fire her from the group. Bob Herbert stated that &quot;she just wasn't fitting in... she would never have gelled with it and I had to tell her to go&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stephenson stated that it was her decision to leave the group, because of the illness of her mother, who was diagnosed with [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;forums.denden.co.uk&quot;/&gt; Adams later dismissed this claim, saying she &quot;just couldn't be arsed&quot; to put in the work the rest of the group was doing.&lt;ref name=sinclair31&gt;Sinclair, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; The Herberts searched for a replacement and first came across Abigail Kis,she just sang a soul song to the management and two days later she was selected. However, she decided not to be on the band because she was too young and didn't want to have problems with her boyfriend having to live with the girls for months and then were led to eighteen-year-old Emma Bunton at the suggestion of vocal coach Pepe Lemer. Bunton instantly impressed the Herberts and was invited to meet the group in July 1994, who welcomed her with open arms: &quot;Straight away I knew she was the one&quot;, stated Halliwell.&lt;ref name=sinclair31 /&gt; During the Summer and Autumn, the group kept on rehearsing and they wrote their first song together: &quot;It's Just One of Those Days&quot;. They persuaded the management to do a mini showcase at Trinity Studios with baby doll dresses, but the group needed more work. After some months, they changed their name to Spice and another showcase was planned in early November in Nomis Studios.&lt;ref name=&quot;forums.denden.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

The group felt insecure about the lack of a contract and was frustrated by the direction in which Heart Management was steering them. In October 1994, armed with a catalogue of demos and dance routines, the group began touring management agencies. They persuaded Bob Herbert to set up a showcase performance for the group in front of industry writers, producers and [[A&amp;R]] men in December 1994 at the Nomis Studios in [[Shepherds Bush]] where they received an &quot;overwhelmingly positive&quot; reaction.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the large interest in the group, the Herberts quickly set about creating a binding contract for the group. Encouraged by the reaction they had received at the Nomis showcase, all five members delayed signing contracts on the legal advice from, amongst others, Adams's father Anthony Adams. In March 1995, because of the group's frustration at their management's unwillingness to listen to their visions and ideas, they parted from Heart Management. In order to ensure they kept control of their own work, the group allegedly stole the master recordings of their discography from the management offices.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; That same day the group tracked down [[Sheffield]]-based producer [[Eliot Kennedy]], who had been present at the showcase, and persuaded him to work with them.
The group was introduced to record producers [[Absolute (production team)|Absolute]], who in turn brought them to the attention of Simon Fuller of [[19 Entertainment]]. The group began a relationship with Fuller and finally signed with him in March 1995. During the summer of that year the group toured record labels in London and Los Angeles with Fuller and finally signed a deal with Virgin Records in September 1995. From this point on, up to the summer of 1996, the group continued to write and record tracks for their debut album while extensively touring the west coast of the United States, where they had signed a publishing deal with Windswept Pacific.

On 7 June 1996, the Spice Girls released their debut single &quot;[[Wannabe (song)|Wannabe]]&quot; in the United Kingdom. In the weeks leading up to the release, the [[music video|video]] for &quot;Wannabe&quot; (directed by Swedish commercials director Desta Rank and shot in April at [[St Pancras Station|St Pancras Chambers]] in London), got a trial airing on [[The Box (UK TV channel)|The Box]] music channel. The video was an instant hit, and was played 502 times a week. After the video was released, the Spice Girls had their first live TV slot on broadcast on LWT's Surprise Surprise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_19970810/ai_n14468963/|title=IT'S A SPICE WORLD | work=Sunday Mirror | first=Ian | last=Hyland | date=10 August 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first music press interview appears in ''[[Music Week]]''. In July 1996, the group conducted their first interview with Paul Gorman, the contributing editor of music paper ''Music Week'', at Virgin Records' Paris headquarters. His piece recognised that the Spice Girls were about to institute a change in the charts away from Britpop and towards out-and-out pop. He wrote: &quot;JUST WHEN BOYS with guitars threaten to rule pop life – Damon's all over Smash Hits, Ash are big in Big! and Liam can't move for tabloid frenzy – an all-girl, in-yer-face pop group have arrived with enough sass to burst that rockist bubble.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gorman [http://www.rocksbackpages.com/article.html?ArticleID=4619 &quot;Taking On The Britboys: Spice Girls&quot;] Retrieved 11 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The song entered the charts at number 3 before moving up to number 1 the following week and staying there for seven weeks. The song proved to be a global hit, hitting number 1 in 31 countries&lt;ref&gt;McGibbon, 1997. pp. 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt; and becoming not only the biggest selling debut single by an all-female group but also the biggest-selling single by an all-female group of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1434516/19971001/spice_girls.jhtml|title=Spice Girls, PMS On The Money|date=1 October 1997|publisher=[[MTV Networks]]|accessdate=21 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Riding a wave of publicity and hype, the group released their next singles in UK and Europe; in October &quot;[[Say You'll Be There]]&quot; was released topping the charts at number one for two weeks. In December &quot;2 Become 1&quot; was released, becoming their first [[List of UK Singles Chart Christmas number ones|Christmas Number 1]] and selling 430,000 copies in its first week which made it the fastest selling single of the year.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Matthew (20 December 1996). &quot;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61284854.html Jingle Belles; Spice Girls hit No 1 for Xmas]&quot;.

The single, written by the Spice Girls, [[Richard Stannard (songwriter)|Richard Stannard]], and Matt Rowe also proved to be a catalyst in helping the Spice Girls break into the notoriously difficult U.S. market when it debuted on the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] Chart at number 11.

Further singles released from the album included &quot;[[Viva Forever]]&quot;, was scheduled to be released as a double A-side with &quot;Never Give Up on the Good Times&quot;, but these plans were scrapped due to Halliwell's departure from the group in May 1998. The song became the seventh number one, and the video includes scenes of Halliwell stop motion animation.

In early 1998, the Spice Girls embarked upon the world tour that Fuller had set up for them covering Europe and North America. The [[Spiceworld Tour]] kicked off in [[Dublin]], Ireland on 24 February 1998 before moving on to mainland Europe and then returning to Britain for two gigs at [[Wembley Arena]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/174271.stm Girl Power coming to Wembley].

It was here that recordings were made for a planned live album, which was confirmed by the group: &quot;We've shown everyone we can do the business on stage, so now we want to do a live album for fans&quot;. Despite masters of the recording being made, the idea was eventually dropped. Later that year, the Spice Girls were invited to sing on the official [[England national football team|England]] World Cup song &quot;How Does It Feel (To Be on Top of the World)&quot;, however, it was derided by England football fans in favour of a re-release of the [[Lightning Seeds]] anthem &quot;[[Three Lions]]&quot;, which comfortably beat it to No.&amp;nbsp;1 in the Singles Charts. This was also the last song the group recorded with Geri's vocals until 2007.

===1998–2000: Halliwell's departure, ''Forever'', and hiatus===
{{Main|Forever (Spice Girls album)|l1=Forever}}
On 31 May 1998, Halliwell announced her departure from the Spice Girls. Through her solicitor (i.e. attorney) she stated: &quot;''Sadly I would like to confirm that I have left the Spice Girls. This is because of differences between us. I'm sure the group will continue to be successful and I wish them all the best''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Geri departure&quot;&gt;BBC News.

Retrieved 17 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Halliwell claimed that she was suffering from exhaustion and wanted to take a break. Halliwell's departure from the group shocked fans, in the middle of rumours of fight with Mel B, the news of Halliwell's departure was covered as a major news story by media around the world, it made the covers of the most important tabloid&lt;ref name=gerileaves/&gt; and became one of the biggest entertainment news stories of the year,&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard geri&quot;&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=946313 Spice Girls Break-Up Shook Up 1998].

The four remaining members were adamant that the group would carry on and that their approaching North American tour would continue as normal, however, Halliwell's departure threw most of the group's plans into disarray. It also meant that most of the material the group had recorded throughout the first half of 1998 at [[Dublin]]'s Windmill Lane Studios with long-time collaborators [[Richard Stannard (songwriter)|Richard Stannard]] and Matt Rowe, was eventually scrapped. A rumoured animated venture by [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Disney]] also failed to materialise. Finally, Halliwell's departure was the subject of a lawsuit by [[Aprilia]] World Service BV, a manufacturer of motorcycles and scooters. On 9 March 1998, Halliwell informed the other members of the group of her intention to withdraw from the group, yet the girls signed an agreement with AWS on 24 March and again on 30 April and participated in a commercial photo shoot on 4 May in Milan, eventually concluding a contract with AWS on 6 May 1998. The [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]] held that their conduct constituted a [[Misrepresentation in English law|misrepresentation]], allowing AWS to rescind their contract with the Spice Girls.

&quot;[[Viva Forever]]&quot; was the last single taken off ''Spiceworld''. The video for the single was made before Geri's departure and features the girls in animated form – a decision made because there was no time to produce a video due to the heavy world tour schedule. Originally planned as a [[A-side and B-side|double A-side]] with &quot;Never Give Up on the Good Times&quot;, the idea was dropped for several reasons, mainly due to time restraints (since there was no time to re-record and edit out Halliwell's vocals or make a video for the track). The North American tour was a big success, began in West Palm Beach on 15 June, and grossed $60 million in 40-date sold-out.&lt;ref name=&quot;gerirolling&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/ginger-spices-departure-marks-end-of-the-beginning-19980602 |title=Ginger Spice's Departure Marks &quot;End Of The Beginning&quot;|work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=26 May 2012 |format=DOC}}&lt;/ref&gt; While on tour in the United-States, the group continued to record new material and they released a new song, &quot;[[Goodbye (Spice Girls song)|Goodbye]]&quot;, before Christmas in 1998. The song was seen as a tribute to Geri and when it topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] it became their third consecutive [[Christmas number-one singles in the UK|Christmas number-one]] – equalling the record previously set by The Beatles. The song also became one of the most successful songs of the 1990s in Canada, where it stayed at number one for sixteen weeks. Later in 1998, Bunton and Mel C appeared at the 1998 MTV Europe Music Awards without their other band members, and the group won two awards: &quot;Best Pop Act&quot; and &quot;Best Group&quot; for a second time.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/213410.stm Entertainment: ''Spice Girls take MTV crown'']. Mel C shouted:''&quot;We've done it again&quot;''.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1998, Brown and Adams announced they were both pregnant at the time, the former also got married to dancer Jimmy Gulzer and became known as Mel G for a brief period. She gave birth to daughter Phoenix Chi in February 1999. One month later Adams gave birth to son Brooklyn. Later that year she married his father, [[Manchester United]] player [[David Beckham]] in a highly publicised wedding in [[Ireland]]. From here onwards she would become known professionally as Victoria Beckham.

The Spice Girls returned to the studio in August 1999, after an 8 month recording break to start work on their third album. The album's sound took a mature direction when American producers like [[Rodney Jerkins]], [[Jimmy Jam]], and [[Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis|Terry Lewis]] came on to collaborate with the group. In December 1999 they performed live for a UK-only tour, named [[Christmas in Spiceworld]], in London and [[Manchester]], also showcasing new songs from the third album. During 1999, the group recorded the character Amneris' song &quot;My Strongest Suit&quot; in [[Elton John and Tim Rice's Aida]], a concept album which would later go on to fuel the musical version of Verdi's [[Aida (musical)|Aida]]. The band performed again at the 2000 [[The Brit Awards|BRIT Awards]], and it was announced that they had received the Outstanding Achievement in Music Award. Despite being at the event, Halliwell did not join her former bandmates on stage. In November 2000, the group released ''Forever''. Sporting a new edgier [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] sound, the album received a lukewarm response&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, James.

Retrieved 11 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; and achieved only a fraction of the success of its two best-selling predecessors, selling five million copies.

In an attempt to cover more ground, the group split up and covered different countries separately; for example Victoria Beckham and Emma Bunton headed to North America while Melanie B and Melanie C concentrated on Europe. In the US, the album peaked at number thirty-nine on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart. In the UK, the album was released the same week as [[Westlife]]'s '[[Coast to Coast (Westlife album)|Coast to Coast]]' album and the chart battle was widely reported by the media, where Westlife won the battle reaching number one in the UK, leaving the Spice Girls at number 2. The lead single from ''Forever'', the double A-side &quot;[[Holler (Spice Girls song)|Holler]]&quot;/&quot;[[Let Love Lead the Way]]&quot;, did enjoy some success – it became the group's ninth number one single in the UK. However the song failed to break onto the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 singles chart stateside, instead peaking at number seven on the [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles]]. &quot;Holler&quot; did peak at number thirty-one on the [[Hot Dance Club Songs|Hot Dance Music/Club Play]] chart in 2001.

The only major performance of the lead single came at the MTV Europe Music Awards in November 2000. With their few TV performances aside, the group did little meaningful promotion, where their last performance came in December 2000. Promo singles of &quot;Tell Me Why&quot;, &quot;Weekend Love&quot;, and &quot;If You Wanna Have Some Fun&quot; came into circulation, but to fans' dismay the ''Forever'' project was abandoned as each group member began to concentrate on solo careers. In December 2000, the group unofficially announced that they were beginning an indefinite hiatus and would be concentrating on their solo careers in regards to their foreseeable future, although they pointed out that the group was not splitting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2774437.stm Spice Girls dismiss comeback plan] BBC.

==Cultural impact and legacy==
===British music scene===

The image of the Spice Girls was deliberately aimed at young girls, an audience of formidable size and potential; reinforcing the range of appeal within the target demographic were the bandmates' five distinctive personalities, which encouraged fans to identify with one member or another. This marketing was helped in no small way by the aliases assigned to each member of the group, similar to the marketing ploy used in children's [[serial literature]] of including several different character types in the storyline. Shortly after &quot;Wannabe&quot;'s release, the group appeared in ''[[Top of the Pops (magazine)|Top of the Pops]]'' magazine where each member was given a nickname based upon her image: Adams became &quot;Posh Spice&quot;, Bunton became &quot;Baby Spice&quot;, Brown became &quot;Scary Spice&quot;, Halliwell became &quot;Ginger Spice&quot;, and Chisholm became &quot;Sporty Spice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;nicknames&quot;, Halliwell, Geri (1999).

===&quot;Girl Power&quot;===
{{Main|Girl power}}
&quot;[[Girl power]]&quot; has put a name to a social phenomenon,&lt;ref name=&quot;girl power article&quot; /&gt; but the slogan was met with mixed reactions. The phrase was a label for the particular facet of post classical neo-feminist empowerment embraced by the band: that a sensual, feminine appearance and equality between the sexes need not be mutually exclusive. This concept was by no means original in the pop world; both [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] and [[Bananarama]] had employed similar outlooks. The phrase, whilst coined by Welsh indie band [[Helen Love]] in 1993{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} and was the title of an album by British pop duo [[Shampoo (band)|Shampoo]] in 1995, was in fact attempted to be used by a London UK 'capella' all girl group called Mint Juleps in 1987. Who, with the production might of [[Trevor Horn]] behind them, released a track called 'Girl to the Power of 6'. The format of the song, whilst having an obvious '80's' sound, had a similar format to the Spice Girl's 'Wannabe', where each girl presented a distinct personality trait. The phrases 'Girl to the Power' and 'Girl Power' are mentioned several times, as well as strong overtones of female empowerment, unity and loyalty. However the formula did not work, perhaps being too far ahead of its time. It was not until the emergence of the Spice Girls in 1996 with Wannabe (over 9 years after Mint Juleps), that the concept of 'Girl power' exploded onto the common consciousness. The Spice Girls' version was distinctive. Its message of empowerment appealed to young girls, adolescents and adult women,&lt;ref name=&quot;girl power article&quot; /&gt; and it emphasised the importance of strong and loyal friendship among females.

In all, the focused, consistent presentation of &quot;girl power&quot; formed the centrepiece of their appeal as a band.&lt;ref name=&quot;girl power article&quot;&gt;BBC News. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/38786.stm Article on the impact of &quot;Girl Power&quot;]. [[The British Broadcasting Corporation]]. 30 December 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics dismissed it as no more than a shallow marketing tactic, while others took issue with the emphasis on physical appearance, concerned about the potential impact on self-conscious and/or impressionable youngsters. Regardless, the phrase became a cultural phenomenon,&lt;ref name=&quot;girl power article&quot; /&gt; adopted as the mantra for millions of girls&lt;ref name=&quot;girl power article&quot; /&gt; and even making it into the [[Oxford English Dictionary]].&lt;ref name=&quot;girl power dictionary&quot;&gt;BBC News. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1765706.stm Article on &quot;Girl Power&quot; being added to the Oxford English Dictionary]. [[The British Broadcasting Corporation]]. 17 January 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
In summation of the concept, author Ryan Dawson said, &quot;The Spice Girls changed British culture enough for Girl Power to now seem completely unremarkable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spice-Beatles comparison&quot;&gt;Dawson, Ryan.

===&quot;Cool Britannia&quot;===
The term &quot;[[Cool Britannia]]&quot; became prominent in the media and represented the new political and social climate that was emerging with the advances made by [[New Labour]] and [[Tony Blair]]. Coming out of a period of 18 years of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government, Tony Blair and New Labour were seen as young, cool and very appealing, a main driving force in making Britain look fashionable again. Although by no means responsible for the onset of &quot;Cool Britannia&quot;, the arrival of the Spice Girls added to the new image and re-branding of Britain, and underlined the growing world popularity of British, rather than U.S., pop music. This fact was underlined at the [[BRIT Awards]] in 1997. The group won two awards&lt;ref name=&quot;brit 1997&quot;&gt;Awards. [http://web.archive.org/web/20060418203744/http://brits.co.uk/shows/1997/ Winners 1997]. BRIT Awards. Retrieved 11 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was Halliwell's Union Jack dress that appeared in media coverage over the world and eventually became a symbol of &quot;Cool Britannia&quot;.

===1990s iconic status===
The ''Union Jack'' dress that Halliwell wore has been identified with iconic status, becoming one of the most prominent symbols of 1990s pop culture... The dress was sold at a charity auction to [[Hard Rock Cafe]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] for a record £41,320, giving Halliwell the [[Guinness World Record]] for the most expensive piece of pop star clothing ever sold&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philbrodieband.com/muso-world-record-holders.htm |title=Pop World Records, Music World Records, Record Breaking Achievements |publisher=Philbrodieband.com |accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; after interest from a frenzy of bidders.&lt;ref name=&quot;sells&quot;&gt;BBC News.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/172717.stm Ginger Spice sells out].

The iconic symbolism of the Spice Girls in the 1990s is also attributed to their merchandising and willingness to be a part of a media-driven world. They advertised for many brands and even parodied themselves in the video for the song &quot;Spice Up Your Life&quot;, in which the band fly in a space ship surrounded by billboards and adverts featuring them. Because of their regular appearances in ads and the media, the band solidified themselves as a phenomenon – an icon of the decade and for British music. The Spice Girls ranked No. 10 in ''The 101 Reasons the '90s Ruled'', special for TV channel [[E!]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/e!s-101/reasons-the-90s-ruled-20---1/episode/315329/summary.html |title=Reasons the '90s Ruled 20 – 1 |publisher=Tv.com |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some sources revere the Spice Girls as &quot;gay icons&quot;, especially those in the United Kingdom. In a survey in which more than 5,000 male and female homosexually-oriented individuals from the UK had voted, Victoria Beckham placed 12th and Geri Halliwell placed 43rd in the Top 50 gay icons of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Top 50 gay icons&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080125023010/http://www.femin.co.uk/?PageID=116&amp;NewsID=636 Top 50 gay icons]. femin.co.uk.

During an interview, Emma Bunton explained why the Spice Girls have so many gay fans: &quot;We were really flattered with having such a huge gay fan base because they know about fashion and they know about songs ...

===Spicy Crispy Chicks===
In 1997, [[Jack in the Box]], an American fast-food chain restaurant, sought to capitalize on Spice Girl Mania in America, by launching a major [[advertising campaign]] using a [[fictional musical group]] called the 'Spicy Crispy Chicks' (a take off of the Spice Girls). The comedic national television commercials were used to promote the new 'Spicy Crispy Sandwich,' with the girls mimicking the Spice Girls, dancing in &quot;the Jack groove.&quot; The Spicy Crispy Chicks concept was used as a model for another successful advertising campaign called the 'Meaty Cheesy Boys.'&lt;ref&gt;

===Fashion trends and nicknames===
As the girls become more popular, their images became as important as their music. In their early days of the band, the girls had a laid back and casual look, and maintained an image of everyday British young females. As their career progressed into a worldwide phenomenon, the girls and their manager Simon Fuller became more aware of the impact their images had. The Spice Girls soon became noticeable just by their clothes and hairstyles, and soon became icons of late 1990s fashion. In a summer 1996 issue of [[Top of the Pops]] magazine, editor Peter Loraine (later to become head of [[Polydor]]'s pop label [[Fascination Records]]) gave them nicknames for their images and personalities, and this soon had an impact on their fashion. In contrast to their early career, the girls soon began to differ their images from each other, and each girl had a unique look.
