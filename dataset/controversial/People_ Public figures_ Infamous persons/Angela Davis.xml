'''Angela Davis''' (born January 26, 1944) is an American [[Activism|political activist]], scholar, and author. Davis emerged as a nationally prominent activist and radical in the 1960s, as a leader of the [[Communist Party USA]] and was in close relations to the [[Black Panther Party]], but was never an official member of the party, and through her association with the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Prisoner rights have been among her continuing interests; she is the founder of &quot;[[Critical Resistance]]&quot;, an organization working to abolish the [[prison-industrial complex]]. She is a retired professor with the [[History of Consciousness]] Department at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]] and is the former director of the university's [[Feminist Studies]] department.&lt;ref name=&quot;BookTV&quot; /&gt; Her research interests are in feminism, [[African American studies]], [[critical theory]], [[Marxism]], [[popular music]] and [[social consciousness]], and the philosophy and history of punishment and prisons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://histcon.ucsc.edu/faculty/index.html Histcon.ucsc.edu]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her membership in the Communist Party led to [[Ronald Reagan]]'s request in 1969 to have her barred from teaching at any university in the State of California. She was tried and acquitted of suspected involvement in the [[Soledad brothers]]' August 1970 abduction and murder of Judge [[Harold Haley]] in [[Marin County, California]].

She was twice a candidate for [[U.S. Vice President|Vice President]] on the Communist Party USA ticket during the 1980s.

==Early life==
Davis was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Her father, Frank Davis, was a graduate of [[St. Augustine's College (Raleigh)|St. Augustine's College]], a [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black college]] in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], and was briefly a high school history teacher. Her father later owned and operated a [[filling station|service station]] in the [[African American|black]] section of Birmingham. Her mother, Sallye Davis, a graduate of [[Miles College]] in Birmingham, was an elementary school teacher.

The family lived in the &quot;Dynamite Hill&quot; neighborhood, which was marked by racial conflict. Davis was occasionally able to spend time on her uncle's farm and with friends in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davis |first=Angela Yvonne |title=Angela Davis: An Autobiography |year=1989 |month=March |publisher=International Publishers |location=New York City |isbn=0-7178-0667-7 |chapter=Rocks }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother, [[Ben Davis (American football)|Ben Davis]], played [[defensive back]] for the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Detroit Lions]] in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Davis also has another brother, Reginald Davis, and sister, Fania Davis Jordan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aptheker-1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aptheker |first1=Bettina |authorlink1=Bettina Aptheker |last2= |first2= |others= |title=The Morning Breaks: The Trial of Angela Davis |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yA9vwr6g8cMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= |edition=2nd |volume= |date= |year=1999 |month= |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, New York |isbn= |doi= |page= |pages= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis attended Carrie A. Tuggle School, a black elementary school; later she attended Parker Annex, a [[middle-school]] branch of [[A. H. Parker High School|Parker High School]] in Birmingham. During this time Davis’ mother was a national officer and leading organizer of the Southern Negro Congress, an organization heavily influenced by the Communist Party. Consequently Davis grew up surrounded by communist organizers and thinkers who significantly influenced her intellectual development growing up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview-Angela Davis&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kum-Kum Bhavnani|first=Bhavnani|coauthors=Davis,Angela|title=Complexity, Activism, Optimism: An Interview with Angela Y. Davis|journal=Feminist Review|date=Spring 1989|year=1989|issue=31|pages=66–81|jstor=1395091}}&lt;/ref&gt; By her [[junior year]], she had applied to and was accepted at an [[American Friends Service Committee]] program that placed black students from the South in [[Racial integration|integrated]] schools in the North. She chose [[Elisabeth Irwin High School]] in [[Greenwich Village]] in New York City. There she was introduced to socialism and communism and was recruited by a Communist youth group, Advance. She also met children of some of the leaders of the Communist Party USA, including her lifelong friend, [[Bettina Aptheker]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Horowitz&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Horowitz |first=David |author=David Horowitz |authorlink=David Horowitz |coauthors= |date=November 10, 2006 |year= |month= |title=The Political Is Personal |journal=Front Page Magazine |volume= |issue= |page= |pages= |publisher= |isbn= |pmid= |pmc= |bibcode= |doi= |accessdate=February 11, 2011 |url=http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=1608 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
===Brandeis University===
Davis was awarded a scholarship to [[Brandeis University]] in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]], where she was one of three black students in her freshman class. She initially felt alienated by the isolation of the campus (at that time she was interested in [[Albert Camus]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]), but she soon made friends with foreign students. She encountered the [[Frankfurt School]] philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]] at a rally during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and then became his student. In a television interview, she said &quot;Herbert Marcuse taught me that it was possible to be an academic, an activist, a scholar, and a revolutionary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2007/aug/23/bourgeois-marxist/ |title=Sandiegoreader.com |publisher=Sandiegoreader.com |date=2007-08-23 |accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; She worked part-time to earn enough money to travel to France and [[Switzerland]] before she went on to attend the eighth [[World Festival of Youth and Students]] in [[Helsinki, Finland]]. She returned home in 1963 to a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] interview about her attendance at the Communist-sponsored festival.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waters&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davis |first=Angela Yvonne |title=Angela Davis: An Autobiography |year=1989 |month=March |publisher=International Publishers |location=New York City |isbn=0-7178-0667-7 |chapter=Waters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her second year at Brandeis, she decided to major in French and continued her intensive study of Sartre. Davis was accepted by the [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] Junior Year in France Program and, she wrote in her autobiography, she managed to talk Brandeis into extending financial support via her scholarship. Classes were initially at [[Biarritz]] and later at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]]. In Paris, she and other students lived with a French family. It was at Biarritz that she received news of the 1963 [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|Birmingham church bombing]], committed by the members of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], an occasion that deeply affected her, because, she wrote, she was personally acquainted with the young victims.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waters&quot;/&gt;

Nearing completion of her [[French Studies|degree in French]], Davis realized her major interest was in philosophy. She became particularly interested in the ideas of Herbert Marcuse and on her return to Brandeis she sat in on his course. Marcuse, she wrote, turned out to be approachable and helpful. Davis began making plans to attend the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]] for [[Graduate school|graduate work]] in philosophy. In 1965 she graduated [[magna cum laude]], a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Waters&quot; /&gt;

===University of Frankfurt===
In Germany, with a stipend of just $100 a month, she first lived with a German family. Later, she moved with a group of students into a [[loft]] in an old factory. After visiting [[East Berlin]] during the annual May Day celebration, she felt that the [[East Germany|East German]] government was dealing better with the residual effects of fascism than were the [[West Germany|West Germans]]. Many of her roommates were active in the radical [[Sozialistischer Deutscher Studentenbund|Socialist German Student Union (SDS)]], and Davis participated in SDS actions, but events unfolding in the United States – the formation of the [[Black Panther Party]] and transformation of [[Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee|SNCC]], for example – impelled her to return to the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waters&quot; /&gt;

===Postgraduate work===
{{Expand section|date=October 2009}}
Marcuse, in the meantime, had moved to the [[University of California, San Diego]], and Davis followed him there after her two years in [[Frankfurt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Waters&quot; /&gt;

Returning to the United States, Davis stopped in London to attend a conference on &quot;The [[Dialectics]] of Liberation.&quot; The black contingent at the conference included the American [[Stokely Carmichael]] and the British [[Michael X]]. Although moved by Carmichael's fiery rhetoric, she was disappointed by her colleagues' [[black nationalism|black nationalist]] sentiments and their rejection of communism as a &quot;white man's thing.&quot; She held the view that any nationalism was a barrier to grappling with the underlying issue, capitalist domination of working people of all races.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davis |first=Angela Yvonne |title=Angela Davis: An Autobiography |year=1989 |month=March |publisher=International Publishers |location=New York City |isbn=0-7178-0667-7 |chapter=Flames}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis earned her master's degree from the San Diego campus and her doctorate in philosophy from [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Humboldt University]] in East Berlin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.cortland.edu/nagelm/papers_for_web/davis_assata06.htm |title=&quot;Women Outlaws: Politics of Gender and Resistance in the US Criminal Justice System&quot;, ''SUNY Cortland'', Mechthild Nagel |publisher=Web.cortland.edu |date=2005-05-02 |accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==University of California, Los Angeles==
Davis was an acting assistant professor in the [[UCLA Department of Philosophy|philosophy department]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA), beginning in 1969. Although both [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Swarthmore College|Swarthmore]] had expressed interest in having her join their respective philosophy departments, she opted for UCLA because of its urban location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1427|title=Encyclopedia of Alabama |publisher=Auburn University |date=2008-01-08 |accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, she also was known as a [[radical feminist]] and activist, a member of the Communist Party USA and an associate of the [[Black Panther Party]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BookTV&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = Interview with Angela Davis | episodelink = | series = BookTV | serieslink = | airdate = 2004-10-03 | season = | number = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Regents of the University of California|Board of Regents]] of the [[University of California]], urged by then-[[Governor of California|California Governor]] [[Ronald Reagan]], fired her from her $10,000 a year post in 1969 because of her membership in the Communist Party. Black students and several professors, however, claimed that they fired her because of her race. The Board of Regents was [[censure]]d by the [[American Association of University Professors]] for their failure to reappoint Davis after her teaching contract expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=rrEDAAAAMBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Google Books |publisher=Google Books |date=1972-05-25 |accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 20 when California judge, Perry Pacht, ruled that the Regents could not fire Davis because of her affiliation with the Communist Party, Davis resumed her post at the University. The Regents, unhappy with the decision, continued to search for ways to release Davis from her position at UCLA. They finally accomplished this on June 20, 1970 when they fired Davis on account of the “inflammatory language” she had used on four different speeches. “We deem particularly offensive,” the report said, “such utterances as her statement that the regents ‘killed, brutalized (and) murdered’ the People’s Park demonstrators, and her repeated characterizations of the police as ‘pigs.’”&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis Ousted&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Davies|first=Lawrence|title=U.C.L.A Teacher is Ousted as Red|accessdate=April 24, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Regents/UCLA&gt;{{cite news|last=Turner|first=Wallace|title=California Regents Drop Communist From Faculty|accessdate=April 24, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Judge- Against Reagents&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=UCLA Barred from Pressing Red's Ouster|accessdate=April 19, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and trial==
{{See also|Marin County courthouse incident}}
On August 7, 1970 [[Jonathan P. Jackson|Jonathan Jackson]], a heavily armed, 17-year-old African American high school student, gained control over a courtroom in [[Marin County, California]]. Once in the courtroom, Jackson armed the black defendants and took Judge Harold Haley, the prosecutor, and three female jurors as hostages.&lt;ref name=Trial-1&gt;{{cite book|last=Aptheker|first=Bettina|title=The Morning Breaks: The Trial of Angela Davis|year=1997|publisher=Cornell University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Register-Guard&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|author = Associated Press | title = Search broadens for Angela Davis | newspaper = Eugene Register-Guard | date = August 17, 1970 | url = http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4BkRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NuEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6482%2C3554926 | accessdate = September 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Jackson transported the hostages and two black convicts away from the courtroom, the police began shooting at the vehicle. The judge, one of the jurors, the prosecutor, and the three black men were killed in the melee. Davis had purchased the firearms used in the attack, including the shotgun used to kill Haley, which had been purchased two days prior and [[sawed-off shotgun|sawed off]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Register-Guard&quot;/&gt; She had also written numerous letters found in the prison cell of one of the murderers. Since California considers “all persons concerned in the commission of a crime, whether they directly commit the act constituting the offense… principals in any crime so committed,” San Marin County Superior Judge Peter Allen Smith charged Davis with “aggravated kidnapping and first degree murder in the death of Judge Harold Haley” and issued a warrant for her arrest. Hours after the judge issued the warrant on August 14, 1970 a massive attempt to arrest Angela Davis began. On August 18, 1970, four days after the initial warrant was issued, the FBI director J. Edgar Hoover made Angela Davis the third woman and the 309th person to appear on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|FBI’s Ten Most Wanted Fugitive List]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Trial-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = |coauthors = | title =Biography | work =Davis (Angela) Legal Defense Collection, 1970–1972 | publisher = | date = | url =http://digilib.nypl.org/dynaweb/ead/scm/scmdavisa/@Generic __BookTextView/135;pt=125 | doi = | accessdate =2007-06-21}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after, Davis became a fugitive and fled California. According to her autobiography, during this time she hid in friends’ homes and moved from place to place at night. On October 13, 1970, FBI agents found her at the Howard Johnson Motor Lodge in New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Hotel&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Charleton|first=Linda|title=F.B.I Seizes Angela Davisin Motel Here|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/08/home/davis-fbi.html?-r=1|accessdate=April 26, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Richard M. Nixon congratulated the FBI on its “capture of the dangerous terrorist, Angela Davis.&quot; On January 5, 1971, after several months in jail, Angela Davis appeared at the Marin County Superior Court and declared her innocence before the court and nation: &quot;I now declare publicly before the court, before the people of this country that I am innocent of all charges which have been leveled against me by the state of California.&quot; [[John Abt]], [[general counsel]] of the [[Communist Party USA]], was one of the first attorneys to represent Davis for her alleged involvement in the shootings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Abt |first1=John |authorlink1=John Abt |last2=Myerson |first2=Michael |others= |title=Advocate and Activist: Memoirs of an American Communist Lawyer |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9REaIPPh4k4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate= |edition= |volume= |date= |year=1993 |month= |publisher=University of Illinois Press |location=Urbana, Illinois |isbn=0-252-02030-8, 9780252020308 |doi= |page= |pages= |bibcode= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While being held in the Women's Detention Center there, she was initially segregated from the general population&lt;!-- racially segregated or something else? --&gt;, but with the help of her legal team soon obtained a federal [[court order]] to get out of the segregated area.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Davis |first=Angela Yvonne |title=Angela Davis: An Autobiography |year=1989 |month=March |publisher=International Publishers |location=New York City |isbn=0-7178-0667-7 |chapter=Nets}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-L0911-029, Berlin, Erich Honecker empfängt Angela Davis.jpg|thumb|Angela Davis and [[Erich Honecker]] in [[GDR]], 1972]]
Across the nation, the thousands of people who agreed with her declaration began organizing a liberation movement. In New York City, black writers formed a committee called the Black People in Defense of Angela Davis. By February 1971 more than 200 local committees in the United States, and 67 in foreign countries worked to liberate Angela Davis from prison. Thanks, in part, to this support, in 1972 the state released her from prison.&lt;ref name=Trial-1 /&gt; After spending 18 months behind bars, Davis was acquitted of all charges by an all-white jury.

On February 23, 1972, Rodger McAfee, a dairy farmer from [[Caruthers, California]] with the help of Steve Sparacino, a wealthy business owner, paid her $100,000 bail. Portions of her legal defense expenses were paid for by the [[United Presbyterian Church in the United States of America|Presbyterian Church]] (UPCNA).&lt;ref name=Trial-1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/08/home/davis-campaign.html| title=The Campaign to Free Angela Davis and Ruchell Magee | work=The New York Times| date=June 27, 1971| author= Sol Stern }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, she was tried and the jury returned a verdict of [[Acquittal|not guilty]]. The fact that she owned the guns used in the crime was judged not sufficient to establish her responsibility for the plot. Her experience as a prisoner in the US played a key role in convincing her to fight against the “prison industrial complex” that she claims exists in the US.&lt;ref name=Trial-1 /&gt; [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] recorded their song &quot;Angela&quot; on their 1972 album ''[[Some Time in New York City]]'' in support. The Jazz musician [[Todd Cochran]], also known as Bayete, recorded his song &quot;Free Angela (Thoughts...and all I've got to say)&quot; that same year. The [[Rolling Stones]] recorded the song &quot;[[Sweet Black Angel]]&quot; on their 1972 album ''[[Exile on Main Street]]''.&lt;ref name=Caldwell&gt;Caldwell, Earl. Also in 1972,Tribe Records co-founder [[Phil Ranelin]] released a song dedicated to Davis intitled &quot;[[Angela's Dilemma]]&quot; on &quot;[[Message From The Tribe]]&quot; a Spiritual Jazz collectable. Miss Davis received a copy of the record from Ranelin at a Detroit rally shortly after her release from prison that year.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Message From The Tribe&quot; Tribe Records AR 2506. [http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/08/home/davis-acquit.html &quot;Angela Davis Acquitted on All Charges&quot;] ''[[The New York Times]]''. June 5, 1972. Retrieved on 2008-07-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Cuba==
After her release, Davis visited Cuba.  In doing so she followed the precedents set by her fellow [[Civil rights activist|activists]] [[Huey Newton]], [[Stokely Carmichael]], and [[Assata Shakur]]. Her reception by [[Afro-Cuban]]s at a mass rally was so enthusiastic that she was reportedly barely able to speak.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last =Gott | first =Richard | authorlink =Richard Gott | coauthors = | title =Cuba: A New History | publisher =Yale University Press | year =2004 | location =New Haven, Connecticut | page =230 | url = | doi = | isbn =0-300-10411-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her stay in Cuba Davis witnessed what she perceived to be a racism-free country.  This led her to believe that “only under socialism could the fight against racism be successfully executed.”  When she returned to the United States her socialist leanings increasingly influenced her understanding of race struggles within the US.&lt;ref name=Cuba&gt;{{cite book|last=Sawyer|first=Mark|title=Racial politics in Post-Revolutionary Cuba|year=2006|publisher=University of California|location=Los Angeles|pages=95–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn==
In a New York City speech on July 9, 1975, Russian dissident and [[Nobel Laureate]] [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] told an [[AFL-CIO]] meeting that Davis was derelict in supporting prisoners in various socialist countries around the world, given her stark opposition to the U.S. prison system. In particular, Solzhenitsyn claimed that a group of Czech prisoners appealed to Davis for support, which he said she refused to offer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last =Solzhenitsyn

Specifically Solzhenitsyn stated, &quot;Little children in school were told to sign petitions in defense of Angela Davis. Although she didn’t have too difficult a time in this country’s jails, she came to recuperate in Soviet resorts. Some Soviet dissidents–but more important, a group of Czech dissidents–addressed an appeal to her: `Comrade Davis, you were in prison. You know how unpleasant it is to sit in prison, especially when you consider yourself innocent. You have such great authority now. Could you help our Czech prisoners? Could you stand up for those people in Czechoslovakia who are being persecuted by the state?’ Angela Davis answered: `They deserve what they get. Let them remain in prison.’ That is the face of Communism. That is the heart of Communism for you.”

==Activism==
In 1980 and 1984, Angela Davis ran for Vice-President along with the veteran party leader of the Communist Party, [[Gus Hall]]. However, given that the Communist Party lacked support within the US, Davis urged radicals to amass support for the Democratic Party. ''Revolutionaries must be realists,'' said Davis in a telephone interview from San Francisco where she was campaigning. During both of the campaigns she was Professor of [[Ethnic Studies]] at the [[San Francisco State University]].&lt;ref name=President&gt;{{cite news|last=Brooke|first=James|title=Other Women Seeking Number 2 Spot Speak Out|url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/98/03/08/home/davis-vp.html?_r=2|accessdate=April 26, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 29, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979 she was also awarded with the [[Lenin Peace Prize]] from the [[Soviet Union]] for her civil rights activism. She visited Moscow in July of that year to collect the prize. [[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-M0804-0717, Berlin, 10. Weltfestspiel, Demonstration, Ehrentribüne.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Angela Davis as honorary guest of the [[World Festival of Youth and Students]] in 1973]]

Davis has continued a career of activism, and has written several books. A principal focus of her current activism is the state of prisons within the United States. She considers herself an [[Prison abolition movement|abolitionist]], not a &quot;prison reformer,&quot; and has referred to the [[United States prison system]] as the &quot;prison-industrial complex&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |date=September 10, 1998 |url=http://www.colorlines.com/archives/1998/09/masked_racism_reflections_on_the_prison_industrial_complex.html |first=Angela |last=Davis |publisher=Color Lines |title=Masked racism: reflections on the prison industrial complex }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis suggested focusing social efforts on education and building &quot;engaged communities&quot; to solve various social problems now handled through state punishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;BookTV&quot; /&gt; Davis was one of the primary founders of Critical Resistance, a national [[grassroots]] organization dedicated to building a movement to abolish the prison system.

In recent work, Angela Davis argues that the prison system in the United States more closely resembles a new form of slavery than a criminal justice system. According to Davis, between the late 19th century and the mid-20th century the number of prisons in the US sharply increased while crime rates continued to rise. During this time, the African American population also became disproportionally represented in prisons. &quot;What is effective or just about this &quot;justice&quot; system?&quot; she urged people to question.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prison Abolishment&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Angela|title=Are prisons Obsolete?|year=2003|publisher=Open Media Series|location=Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; To encourage people to critically think about the criminal justice system and its racist history, Davis has also spent years lecturing in schools, parks, and other public places to the American public.

She has lectured at [[San Francisco State University]], [[Stanford University]], [[Bryn Mawr College]], [[Brown University]], [[Syracuse University]], and other schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;BookTV&quot; /&gt; She states that in her teaching, which is mostly at the graduate level, she concentrates more on posing questions that encourage development of [[critical thinking]] than on imparting knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;BookTV&quot; /&gt; In 1997, she declared herself to be a lesbian in ''[[Out (magazine)|Out]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | coauthors = | title =Angela Davis | work = | publisher =Notable name database | date = | url =http://www.nndb.com/people/185/000024113/ | doi = | accessdate =2007-07-21| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070621134342/http://www.nndb.com/people/185/000024113/| archivedate= June 21, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1969 Davis began publicly speaking, voicing her opposition to the [[Vietnam War]], racism, sexism, and the prison industrial complex, and her support of gay rights and other social justice movements. In 1969 she blamed imperialism for the troubles suffered by oppressed populations. “We are facing a common enemy and that enemy is Yankee Imperialism, which is killing us both here and abroad. Now I think anyone who would try to separate those struggles, anyone who would say that in order to consolidate an anti-war movement, we have to leave all of these other outlying issues out of the picture, is playing right into the hands of the enemy,” Davis declared.&lt;ref name=Speech-Vietnam&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Angela|title=Speech by Angela Davis at a Black Panther Rally in Bobby Hutton Park|url=http://www.indybay.org/newsitems/2009/04/15/18589458.php|work=Speech|accessdate=April 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 she publicly spoke against the war on terror, the prison industrial complex, and the broken immigration system and told people that if they wanted to solve social justice issues they had to “hone their critical skills, develop them and implement them.&quot; Later, after the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, she declared, the “horrendous situation in New Orleans,” is due to the structures of racism, capitalism, and imperialism with which our leaders run this country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JKENb33U4E|work=Speech|title=YouTube – Angela Davis (public speech) – LIVE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis spoke out against the 1995 [[Million Man March]], arguing that the exclusion of women from this event necessarily promoted [[male chauvinism]] and that the organizers, including [[Louis Farrakhan]], preferred women to take subordinate roles in society. Together with [[Kimberlé Crenshaw]] and others, she formed the African American Agenda 2000, an alliance of [[Black Feminism|Black feminists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MLz7jo09yiAC&amp;pg=PA78&amp;dq=angela+davis+African+American+Agenda+2000,#v=onepage&amp;q=angela%20davis%20African%20American%20Agenda%202000%2C&amp;f=false| title=Dark continent of our bodies: black feminism and the politics of respectability| author= E. Frances White | publisher= Temple University Press| year= 2001 | isbn=978-1-56639-880-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis is no longer a member of the Communist Party, leaving it to help found the [[Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism]], which broke from the Communist Party USA because of the latter's support of the [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Battleground: Women, Gender, and Sexuality |last=Lind |first=Amy |authorlink= |coauthors=Stephanie Brzuzy |year=2008 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Connecticut |isbn=0-313-34038-2 |page=406 |pages= |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CdoIS5YdygkC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA406#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=February 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She remains on the Advisory Board of the Committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | coauthors = | title =Advisory board | work =Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism website | publisher =Committees of Correspondence for Democracy and Socialism | date =2007-07-20 | url =http://www.cc-ds.org/advisory_bd.html | doi = | accessdate =2007-07-20| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070709061621/http://www.cc-ds.org/advisory_bd.html| archivedate= July 9, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Angela-Davis-Mar-28-2006.jpg|thumb|right|Davis at the University of Alberta, March 28, 2006.]]
Davis has continued to speak out against the death penalty. In 2003, she lectured at [[Agnes Scott College]], a liberal arts women's college in Atlanta, on prison reform, minority issues, and the ills of the criminal justice system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agnesscott.edu/spotlightDetails.aspx?Channel=%2FChannels%2FAdmissions%2FAdmissions+Content&amp;WorkflowItemID=91360c59-8fdf-4a2c-871e-2a520121de7d |title=ASC Spotlight – Africana Studies |publisher=Agnesscott.edu |date= |accessdate=October 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
