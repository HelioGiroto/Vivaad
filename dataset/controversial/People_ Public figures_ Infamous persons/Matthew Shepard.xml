'''Matthew Wayne Shepard''' (December 1, 1976 – October 12, 1998) was a student at the [[University of Wyoming]] who was [[torture]]d and [[murder]]ed near [[Laramie, Wyoming]], U.S.A., in October 1998.  He was attacked on the night of October 6–7, and died at [[Poudre Valley Hospital]] in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]], on October 12 from severe head injuries.

During a pre-trial hearing, a Laramie police officer testified that the violence against Shepard was due to how the attacker &quot;[felt] about [[sexual orientation|gay]]s,&quot; per an interview of the attacker's girlfriend who said she received that explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/21/us/witnesses-trace-brutal-killing-of-gay-student.html?pagewanted=all |title=Witnesses Trace Brutal Killing of Gay Student |first=James |last=Brooke |date=November 21, 1998 |work=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shepard's murder brought national and international attention to the contention of [[hate crime]] legislation at the state and federal levels.&lt;ref name=life&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.matthewshepard.org/site/PageServer |title=Matthew Shepard Foundation webpage |accessdate=4 October 2009 |publisher=Matthew Shepard Foundation |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080729005923/http://www.matthewshepard.org/site/PageServer |archivedate = July 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, his mother [[Judy Shepard]] authored a book ''The Meaning of Matthew: My Son's Murder in Laramie, and a World Transformed''. On October 22, 2009, the United States Congress passed the [[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd, Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]] (Matthew Shepard Act for short), and on October 28, 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] signed the legislation into law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/theoval/post/2009/10/620000629/1 |title=Obama signs hate-crimes law rooted in crimes of 1998 |work=[[USA Today]] |date=October 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Shepard was born in [[Casper, Wyoming]], the first of two sons born to [[Judy Shepard|Judy Peck]] and Dennis Shepard. His younger brother Logan was born in 1981. He attended [[Natrona County School District|Crest Hill Elementary School]], [[Dean Morgan Junior High School]], and [[Natrona County High School]] for his freshman through junior years. [[Saudi Aramco]] hired his father in the summer of 1994, and his parents subsequently resided at the [[Saudi Aramco Residential Camp in Dhahran]]. During that time, Shepard attended [[The American School In Switzerland]] (TASIS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Matthew Shepard's Mother Aims to Speak With His Voice |author=Julie Cart |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=September 14, 1999 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/sep/14/news/mn-9950?pg=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from which he graduated in May 1995. Shepard then attended [[Catawba College]] in North Carolina and [[Casper College]] in Wyoming, before settling in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. Shepard became a first-year [[political science]] major at the [[University of Wyoming]] in Laramie, and was chosen as the student representative for the Wyoming Environmental Council.&lt;ref name=life/&gt;

He was described by his father as &quot;an optimistic and accepting young man who had a special gift of relating to almost everyone. He was the type of person who was very approachable and always looked to new challenges. Matthew had a great passion for equality and always stood up for the acceptance of people's differences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.muhlenbergweekly.com/judy-shepard-speaks-out-against-anti-gay-violence-1.2497979#.TwZrlJhz045 |title=Judy Shepard speaks out against anti-gay violence |first1=Jillian |last1=Bevacqua |first2=Torie |last2=Paone |date=July 5, 2011 |work=Muhlenberg Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1995, during a high school trip to [[Morocco]], Shepard was beaten and raped, causing him to experience depression and panic attacks, according to his mother. One of Shepard's friends feared that his depression had driven him to become involved with drugs during his time in college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=277685&amp;page=1&amp;singlePage=true#.TxnxPpg9RCc |title=New Details Emerge in Matthew Shepard Murder |date=November 26, 2004 |work=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murder==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Hendersonmckinney.jpg|thumb|Shepard's murderers, Russell Arthur Henderson and Aaron James McKinney, awaiting testimony in court (1998)]] --&gt;

Shortly after midnight on October 7, 1998, Shepard met Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson for the first time at the Fireside Lounge in [[Laramie, Wyoming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Details Emerge in Matthew Shepard Murder|url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/story?id=277685&amp;page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was decided that McKinney and Henderson would give Shepard a ride home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Killer: Shepard Didn't Make Advances|url=http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/1999/11/06/witness/index.html|publisher=[[Salon.com]]|accessdate=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKinney and Henderson subsequently drove the car to a remote, [[rural]] area and proceeded to rob, [[Pistol-whipping|pistol-whip]], and [[torture]] Shepard, tying him to a fence and leaving him to die. According to their court testimony, McKinney and Henderson also discovered his address and intended to steal from his home. Still tied to the fence, Shepard, who was still alive but in a coma, was discovered 18 hours later by Aaron Kreifels, a cyclist who initially mistook Shepard for a [[scarecrow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jim|last=Hughes|title=Wyo. cyclist recalls tragic discovery|url=http://www.texasdude.com/related.htm|publisher=The Denver Post|newspaper=The Denver Post|location=Denver|date=15 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shepard had suffered [[fractures]] to the back of his head and in front of his right ear. He experienced severe [[brainstem]] damage, which affected his body's ability to regulate [[heart rate]], [[body temperature]], and other [[Vital signs|vital functions]]. There also were about a dozen small [[lacerations]] around his head, face, and neck. His injuries were deemed too severe for doctors to operate. Shepard never regained consciousness and remained on full [[life support]]. While he lay in [[Intensive care medicine|intensive care]], candlelight vigils were held by the people of Laramie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Wyoming Matthew Shepard Resource Site|url=http://www.uwyo.edu/News/shepard/|publisher=[[University of Wyoming]]|accessdate=2006-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shepard was pronounced dead at 12:53 a.m. on October 12, 1998, at [[Poudre Valley Hospital]], in [[Fort Collins, Colorado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CNN Coverage of Matthew Shepard|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9810/12/wyoming.attack.03/index.html|work=[[CNN]]|title=Murder charges planned in beating death of gay student|accessdate=2006-11-01

===Funeral protests===
[[Fred Phelps]], leader of the [[Westboro Baptist Church]] in Topeka, Kansas, took his church's &quot;God Hates Fags&quot; message to the funeral of Matthew Shepard, held in Casper, Wyoming, on Saturday, October 17, 1998. Two of his picket signs read: &quot;No Tears for Queers&quot; and &quot;Fag Matt in Hell.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaytoday.com/garchive/events/101498ev.htm |title=Top Story |publisher=Gay Today |date= |accessdate=2012-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrests and trial==
Police arrested Aaron McKinney and Russell Henderson shortly after the attack, finding the bloody gun and Shepard's shoes and wallet in their truck.&lt;ref name=&quot;abcnews&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/Story?id=277685&amp;page=1|title=New Details Emerge in Matthew Shepard Murder|publisher=ABC News Internet Ventures|accessdate=2009-06-07|date=November 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henderson and McKinney later tried to persuade their girlfriends to provide alibis for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9810/13/wyoming.attack.02/index.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080508011253/http://www.cnn.com/US/9810/13/wyoming.attack.02/index.html |archivedate=2008-05-08 |title=New details emerge about suspects in gay attack |accessdate=21 January 2007 |work=CNN.com |publisher=[[Cable News Network]] |date=13 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At trial, McKinney offered various rationales to justify his actions. He originally pleaded the [[gay panic defense]], arguing that he and Henderson were driven to [[insanity defense|temporary insanity]] by [[homosexual panic|alleged sexual advances]] by Shepard. At another point, McKinney's lawyer stated that they had wanted to rob Shepard but never intended to kill him.&lt;ref name=&quot;abcnews&quot;/&gt;

The prosecutor in the case alleged that McKinney and Henderson pretended to be gay in order to gain Shepard's trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20081201140327/http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/henderson/040599_pm_ctv.html |archivedate=December 1, 2008 |url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/henderson/040599_pm_ctv.html|title=Henderson pleads guilty to felony murder in Matthew Shepard case|accessdate=2006-04-06|author=Tuma, Clara, and [[The Associated Press]]|publisher=[[Court TV]]|date=April 5, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial, Kristen Price, girlfriend of McKinney, testified that Henderson and McKinney had &quot;pretended they were gay to get [Shepard] in the truck and rob him&quot;.&lt;ref name=trutv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/criminal_mind/forensics/welner/3.html?print=yes |title=Psychiatry, the Law, and Depravity: Profile of Michael Welner, M.D. Chairman, The Forensic Panel |first=Katherine |last=Ramsland |publisher=[[truTV]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.salon.com/1999/11/01/gay_panic/singleton/ |title=Quiet bombshell in Matthew Shepard trial |first=Dave |last=Cullen |date=November 1, 1999 |accessdate=February 19, 2012 |newspaper=Salon}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKinney and Henderson went to the Fireside Lounge and selected Shepard after he arrived. McKinney alleged that Shepard asked them for a ride home.&lt;ref name=trutv/&gt;

After befriending him, they took him to a remote area outside of [[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]] where they robbed him, assaulted him severely, and tied him to a fence with a rope from McKinney's truck while Shepard pleaded for his life. Media reports often contained the graphic account of the pistol whipping and his fractured skull. It was reported that Shepard was beaten so brutally that his face was completely covered in blood, except where it had been partially washed clean by his tears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Losing Matt Shepard: life and politics in the aftermath of anti-gay murder |last=Loffreda |first=Beth |year=2000 |publisher=Columbia University Press |location=New York |isbn=0-231-11858-9 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/first/l/loffreda-shepard.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chiasson |first=Lloyd |title=Illusive Shadows: Justice, Media, and Socially Significant American Trials |publisher=Praeger |date=November 30, 2003 |page=183 |isbn=978-0-275-97507-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both girlfriends also testified that neither McKinney nor Henderson were under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homes.thedailycamera.com/extra/shepard/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080424091724/http://homes.thedailycamera.com/extra/shepard/|archivedate=2008-04-24|title=The Daily Camera:Matthew Shepard Murder|accessdate=2006-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://homes.thedailycamera.com/extra/shepard/29bshep.html|title=Girlfriend: McKinney told of killing|last=Black|first=Robert W.|work=The Daily Camera|date=October 29, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henderson pleaded guilty on April 5, 1999 and agreed to testify against McKinney to avoid the [[death penalty]]; he received two consecutive [[life sentence]]s. The jury in McKinney's trial found him guilty of [[felony murder rule|felony murder]]. As they began to deliberate on the [[death penalty]], Shepard's parents brokered a deal, resulting in McKinney receiving two consecutive life terms without the possibility of parole.&lt;ref name=cart&gt;{{cite news|last=Cart|first=Julie|title=Killer of Gay Student Is Spared Death Penalty; Courts: Matthew Shepard's father says life in prison shows 'mercy to someone who refused to show any mercy.'|date=November 5, 1999|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|page=A1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henderson and McKinney were [[incarcerated]] in the Wyoming State Penitentiary in [[Rawlins, Wyoming|Rawlins]], later being transferred to other prisons because of overcrowding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jean |last=Torkelson |title=Mother's mission: Matthew Shepard's death changes things |curly=y |url=http://m.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/oct/03/10-years-later-matthew-shepard-hasnt-been-forgotte/ |work=Rocky Mountain News |publisher=The E.W.

==Hate crime legislation==

{{See also|Hate crime laws in the United States}}

Henderson and McKinney were not charged with a [[hate crime]], because no Wyoming criminal statute provided for such a charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.timesdispatch.com/lifestyles/2009/jun/13/i-hate0531_20090611-212807-ar-40471/ |title=Hate-crimes bill would expand federal jurisdiction |first=Emily |last=Kimball |work=[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]] |date=June 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of Shepard's murder led to requests for new legislation addressing hate crime, urged particularly by those who believed that Shepard was targeted on the basis of his sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mother of Hate-Crime Victim to Speak at Colby|author=[[Colby College]]|date=March 7, 2006|url=http://www.colby.edu/news/detail/612/|accessdate=2006-04-06}} Press release.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1009867|title=Open phones|accessdate=2006-04-06|work=[[Talk of the Nation]]|publisher=[[National Public Radio]]|date=October 12, 1998}} &quot;Denounced nationwide as a hate crime&quot; at 1:40 elapsed time.&lt;/ref&gt; Under then [[United States]] federal law&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fbi.gov/hq/cid/civilrights/hate.htm|accessdate=2006-04-06|title=Investigative Programs: Civil Rights: Hate Crimes|publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wyoming]] state law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/99hatecrime/provisions.asp|accessdate=2006-04-06|title=Map of State Statutes|publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; crimes committed on the basis of sexual orientation were not prosecutable as hate crimes.

In the following session of the Wyoming Legislature, a bill was introduced defining certain attacks motivated by victim identity as hate crimes, however the measure failed on a 30-30 tie in the [[Wyoming House of Representatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The &quot;Hate State&quot; Myth|last=Blanchard|first=Robert O.|url=http://reason.com/9905/fe.rb.the.shtml|accessdate=2006-04-06|date=May 1999|work=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]]|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060405031833/http://reason.com/9905/fe.rb.the.shtml |archivedate = April 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the federal level, then-President [[Bill Clinton]] renewed attempts to extend federal [[hate crime]] legislation to include [[homosexual]] individuals, women, and people with [[disability|disabilities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/09/13/hate.crimes/index.html|accessdate=2006-04-07|author=Barrett, Ted, and [[The Associated Press]]|title=President Clinton urges Congress to pass hate crimes bill: GOP aides predict legislation will pass House, but will not become law|publisher=CNN|date=September 13, 2000 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080526040218/http://transcripts.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/09/13/hate.crimes/index.html |archivedate = May 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These efforts were rejected by the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1999.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} In September 2000, both houses of [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed such legislation; however it was stripped out in [[United States congressional conference committee|conference committee]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Office of House Democratic Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]]|date=October 7, 2004|url=http://democraticleader.house.gov/press/releases.cfm?pressReleaseID=718|accessdate=2006-04-07|title=House Democrats Condemn GOP Rejection of Hate Crimes Legislation |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060401180910/http://democraticleader.house.gov/press/releases.cfm?pressReleaseID=718 |archivedate = April 1, 2006}} Press release.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 20, 2007, the [[Matthew Shepard Act]] ({{USBill|110|HR|1592}}) was introduced as federal bipartisan legislation in the [[U.S. Congress]], sponsored by Democrat [[John Conyers]] with 171 co-sponsors. Shepard's parents were present at the introduction ceremony. The bill passed the House of Representatives on May 3, 2007. Similar legislation passed in the [[United States Senate|Senate]] on September 27, 2007&lt;ref&gt;Simon, R.

Retrieved 2007-05-03.&lt;/ref&gt; The amendment was dropped by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] leadership because of opposition from conservative groups and President George Bush, and due to the measure being attached to a defense bill there was a lack of support from [[antiwar]] Democrats.&lt;ref name=&quot;windy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/gay/lesbian/news/ARTICLE.php?AID=17078|title=Congress Drops Hate-Crimes Bill|first=Amy|last=Wooten|date=January 1, 2008|accessdate=2008-07-31|work=[[Windy City Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 10, 2007, congressional powers attached bipartisan hate crimes legislation to a Department of Defense Authorization bill, though failed to get it passed. [[Nancy Pelosi]], Speaker of the House, said she &quot;is still committed to getting the Matthew Shepard Act passed.&quot; Pelosi planned to get the bill passed in early 2008&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt2&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/10/opinion/10mon3.html?ref=opinion Caving in on Hate Crimes], [[New York Times]], 2007-12-10.

The U.S. House of Representatives debated expansion of hate crimes legislation on April 29, 2009. During the debate, Representative [[Virginia Foxx]] of [[North Carolina]] called the &quot;hate crime&quot; labeling of Shepard's murder a &quot;hoax&quot;. Shepard's mother was said to be in the House gallery when the congresswoman made this comment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Grim |first=Ryan |title=Virginia Foxx: Story of Matthew Shepard's Murder A &quot;Hoax&quot; |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/04/29/virginia-foxx-story-of-ma_n_192971.html |date=April 29, 2009 |publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=2009-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Foxx later called her comments &quot;a poor choice of words&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Congresswoman calls gay death case a `hoax' |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wtvd/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6788587 |accessdate=2009-04-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The House passed the act, designated {{USBill|111|HR|1913}}, by a vote of 249 to 175.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/29/house-passes-hate-crimes-bill/|title=House Passes Hate-Crimes Bill|last=Stout|first=David|date=April 29, 2009|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was introduced in the Senate on April 28 by [[Ted Kennedy]], [[Patrick Leahy]], and a bipartisan coalition;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feminist.org/news/newsbyte/uswirestory.asp?id=11668 |title=Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act Introduced in Senate |publisher=Feminist.org |date=2009-04-29 |accessdate=2010-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; it had 43 cosponsors as of June 17, 2009.

==Public reaction and aftermath==
{{See also|Cultural depictions of Matthew Shepard}}

[[Romaine Patterson]], a friend of Shepard, organized a group of individuals who assembled in a circle around an anti-gay group, wearing white robes and gigantic wings (resembling [[angel]]s) that blocked the protesters. Police had to create a human barrier between the two protest groups.&lt;ref name = &quot;CNN-pleads&quot;/&gt;

While the organization had no name in the initial demonstration, it has since been ascribed various titles, including 'Angels of Peace' and 'Angel Action'.&lt;ref name = &quot;CNN-pleads&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Suspect pleads guilty in beating death of gay college student|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9904/05/gay.attack.trail.02/|date=April 5, 1999|accessdate=2007-01-18|publisher=CNN |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070102094210/http://www.cnn.com/US/9904/05/gay.attack.trail.02/ |archivedate = January 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;TWWWW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Whole World Was Watching|url=http://www.paraview.com/patterson/index.htm|accessdate=2007-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fence to which Shepard was tied and left to die became an impromptu shrine for visitors, who left notes, flowers, and other mementos. It has since been removed by the land owner.

The murder continued to attract public attention and media coverage long after the trial was over.
When [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] ''[[20/20 (U.S. television show)|20/20]]'' ran a story in 2004 suggesting that Shepard had been [[HIV]] positive and quoting claims by McKinney, Henderson, and Kristen Price, and the prosecutor in the case that the murder had not been motivated by Shepard's sexuality but rather was a robbery gone violent amongst drug users (the suggestion being that Shepard was a heavy [[methamphetamine]] user)'&lt;ref name=&quot;abcnews&quot;/&gt; it received considerable attention and criticism.

Retired Laramie Police Chief Dave O'Malley stated that the murderers' claims were not credible, but the prosecutor in the case stated that there was ample evidence that drugs were at least a factor in the murder.&lt;ref name=OMalley&gt;{{cite web |last=Knittel |first=Shaun |url=http://www.sgn.org/sgnnews37_20/mobile/page1.cfm |title=The Matthew Shepard paradox: How one U.S. Representative opened hate's old wounds |accessdate=October 29, 2009 |work=sgn.org |publisher=Seattle Gay News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other coverage focused on how these more recent statements contradicted those made at and near the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://journalism.nyu.edu/publishing/archives/recount/article/95/|work=Recount|publisher=[[New York University]]|title=Rewriting the Motives Behind Matthew Shepard’s Murder|accessdate=2007-05-06|date=December 8, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cultural depictions of Matthew Shepard#Songs|Many musicians]] have written and recorded songs about the murder, including [[Elton John]], whose 2001 album ''[[Songs from the West Coast]]'' included &quot;American Triangle&quot; (originally titled &quot;American Tragedy&quot;), a song about Shepard's murder. The American metal band [[Trivium (band)|Trivium]] also composed and recorded &quot;And Sadness Will Sear&quot; in their third album [[The Crusade (album)|The Crusade]] in honor of Matthew Shepard and in protest to closed-mindedness and prejudice.  Beejae, American recording artist better known as Johnny Saint-Lethal from the indie rock group THE SHOW, wrote and performed &quot;Hate Crimes&quot;, where a verse and chorus is dedicated in satire to Matthew Shepard. It appeared on his only solo album, 2006's &quot;It Was What It Was&quot;

The American [[rock music|rock]] band [[Thursday (band)|Thursday]] recorded a song named after Shepard, &quot;M. Shepard&quot;, on their 2003 album ''[[War All the Time (Thursday album)|War All the Time]]''. [[Lady Gaga]] performed [[John Lennon]]'s '[[Imagine (song)|Imagine]]' at the 2009 HRC Dinner and changed the lyrics from &quot;above us only sky&quot; to &quot;with only Matthew in the sky&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Carter, Nicole (2009-12-10). &quot;Lady Gaga performs her version of 'Imagine' at the Human Rights Campaign dinner in Washington D.C.&quot;. ''Daily News''. News Corporation. Retrieved 2010-06-12.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Melissa Etheridge]], whose 1999 album &quot;[[Breakdown (Melissa Etheridge album)|Breakdown]]&quot; contained &quot;[[Scarecrow (Melissa Etheridge song)|Scarecrow]]&quot;, a song dedicated to Shepard and his family and friends.

A play, three narrative films, and a documentary were made about Shepard: ''[[The Laramie Project]]'', ''[[The Matthew Shepard Story]]'', ''Anatomy of a Hate Crime'', and ''[[Laramie Inside Out]]'', and ''Moral Obligations'', a fictionalized account of the night of the murder. ''The Laramie Project'' (a play, later turned into a film by [[HBO]]) compiles dozens of interviews with citizens of the town of Laramie ranging from a few months after the attack to a few years after. The play is designed to display the town's reaction to the crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chapelhillnews.com/news/story/25210.html |title=The Laramie Project|accessdate=2009-02-20 |last=Hart |first=Dave |date=November 12, 2008 |work=The Chapel Hill News |publisher=The News &amp; Observer Publishing Company }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/index.ssf/2008/02/kalamazoo_a_group_has.html |title=Gay-themed high school play draws protest, support |accessdate=2009-02-20 |last=Hugenberg |first=Jenny |date=February 14, 2008 |publisher=Kalamazoo Gazette }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten years later, The Laramie Project created a second play, based on interviews with members of the town, Shepard's mother, and his incarcerated murderer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefastertimes.com/theatertalk/2009/10/04/333/ |title=Remembering a Cruel Murder: Laramie Revisited |publisher=Thefastertimes.com |date=2009-10-04 |accessdate=2010-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''October Mourning'' by [[Lesléa Newman]], a novel in verse about Matthew's murder, was published in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/leslea-newman/october-mourning-a-song-for-matthew-shepard_b_1909595.html|title=Writing October Mourning: A Song for Matthew Shepard: An 11-Year Journey|accessdate=2012-26-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
In the years following Shepard's death, his mother [[Judy Shepard]] has become a well-known advocate for [[LGBT rights]], particularly issues relating to gay youth.

===Matthew Shepard Foundation===
His mother is a prime force behind the [[Matthew Shepard Foundation]], which supports diversity and tolerance in youth organizations. The group was founded in December 1998 by Dennis and Judy Shepard in memory of Matthew.

The Foundation focuses on three primary areas: erasing what it considers to be hate in society; putting lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) youth first; and ensuring equality for all LGBT Americans.

===Book: ''The Meaning of Matthew''===
''The Meaning of Matthew'', full title ''The Meaning of Matthew: My Son's Murder in Laramie, and a World Transformed'' is a 2009 biographical book by Judy Shepard about her son Matthew Shepard. Judy Shepard speaks about her loss, her family memories of Matthew, and the tragic event that changed the Shepards' lives and America. ''The Meaning of Matthew'' follows the Shepard family in the days immediately after the crime to see their incapacitated son, kept alive by life support machines; how the Shepards learned of the big response, candlelit vigils and memorial services for their child; how they struggled to navigate the legal system as Matthew's murderers were on trial.

In the book, Judy Shepard explains why she became a gay rights activist, and the challenges and rewards of raising a gay child in America today.
