}}
'''Donald Henry Rumsfeld''' (born July 9, 1932) is an [[United States|American]] politician and businessman. Rumsfeld served as the 13th [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] from 1975 to 1977 under President [[Gerald Ford]], and as the 21st Secretary of Defense from 2001 to 2006 under President [[George W. Bush]]. He is both the youngest and the oldest person to have served as Secretary of Defense. Additionally, Rumsfeld was a four-term [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Congressman]] from [[Illinois]] (1962–1969), Director of the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] (1969–1970), Counsellor &lt;!-- This is the correct spelling per Rumsfeld's 2011 memoir --&gt; to the President (1969–1973), the [[United States Permanent Representative to NATO]] (1973–1974), and [[White House Chief of Staff]] (1974–1975).

Born in Illinois, Rumsfeld attended [[Princeton University]], graduating in 1954 with a degree in [[political science]]. After serving in the [[United States Navy|Navy]] for three years, he mounted a campaign for Congress in Illinois' 13th Congressional District, winning in 1962 at the age of 30. Reelected four times, he was a leading co-sponsor of the [[Freedom of Information Act]]. Rumsfeld was reluctantly appointed by President [[Richard Nixon]] to head the Office of Economic Opportunity in 1969; appointed Counselor by Nixon and entitled to Cabinet-level status, he would also head up the [[Economic Stabilization Act of 1970|Economic Stabilization Program]] before being appointed Ambassador to NATO. Called back to Washington in August 1974, Rumsfeld was appointed Chief of Staff by President Ford, recruiting a young one-time staffer of his, [[Dick Cheney]], to succeed him when Ford nominated Rumsfeld Secretary of Defense in 1975.

When Ford lost the 1976 election, Rumsfeld returned to private business life, and was named president of [[G. D. Searle &amp; Company]], a noted pharmaceutical company, during which time he led the legalization of [[Aspartame]]. He was later named CEO of [[General Instrument]] from 1990 to 1993, and chairman of [[Gilead Sciences]] from 1997 to 2001. 

Rumsfeld was recommended for the position of Defense Secretary by incoming Vice President Dick Cheney in late 2000, and was appointed in January 2001 by President George W. Bush. His tenure has been noted to be one of the most pivotal in recent history; as one of the key individuals responsible for the restructuring of the military in the new 21st century, Rumsfeld was crucial in planning the United States' response to the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], which included two wars in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]]. Highly popular with the media for his outspokenness and candor, he gradually lost political support as the wars continued and resigned in late 2006. He has since published his autobiography ''[[Known and Unknown: A Memoir]]''.

==Early life==
Donald Henry Rumsfeld was born on July 9, 1932, in [[Evanston, Illinois]], to George Donald Rumsfeld and Jeannette (née Husted).&lt;ref name=&quot;autobio&quot;&gt;[http://library.rumsfeld.com/doclib/sp/83/1946-01-11%20Autobiography%20%28II-304%29.pdf My autobiography], Donald Rumsfeld, 1946&lt;/ref&gt; His father came from a [[Swiss American]] family that had emigrated in the 1870s, and young Donald was sometimes ribbed about looking like a &quot;tough Swiss&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley Graham, ''By His Own Rules'' (2009) pp 16, 31&lt;/ref&gt;  Growing up in [[Winnetka, Illinois]], Rumsfeld became an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] in 1949 and is the recipient of both the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] from the [[Boy Scouts of America]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = | first = | title = Speakers Highlight Scouting's Core Values| journal = Scouting | volume = 94 | issue = 4 | pages = 35 | id = | url = http://www.scoutingmagazine.org/issues/0609/a-chrt.html Scouting magazine | format = | year = | month = }} September 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[Silver Buffalo Award]] in 2006. From 1943-1945, Rumsfeld lived in [[Coronado, California]] while his father was stationed on an aircraft carrier in the Pacific in World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense.gov/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=3771 Radio Interview with Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld on KOGO Radio San Diego with Mark Larson]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a camp counselor at the Northeast Illinois Council's Camp Ma-Ka-Ja-Wan in the late 1940s and a ranger at [[Philmont Scout Ranch]] in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/2005/tr20050829-secdef3801.html Secretary Rumsfeld's Remarks at the White House Conference on Cooperative Conservation — U.S. Department of Defense News Transcript — August 29, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rumsfeld1954 princeton yearbook.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Rumsfeld's 1954 yearbook portrait from [[Princeton University|Princeton]], where he played [[American football|football]] and [[Collegiate wrestling|wrestled]].]]

Rumsfeld attended [[Baker Demonstration School]], a private middle school, and later graduated&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Habermehl| first = Kris| date = 2007-01-25| title = Fire Breaks Out At Prestigious High School| url = http://cbs2chicago.com/local/New.Trier.High.2.334860.html| accessdate = 2008-06-28}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[New Trier High School]]. He attended [[Princeton University]] on academic and [[Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps|NROTC]] partial scholarships (A.B., &lt;!-- Princeton University uses the Latin form: Artium Baccalaureus --&gt;1954). During his time at Princeton, he was an accomplished amateur wrestler, becoming captain of the wrestling team, and captain of the [[Lightweight Football]] team playing [[defensive back]]. His Princeton University senior thesis was titled &quot;The [[Steel Seizure Case]] of 1952 and Its Effects on Presidential Powers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://libweb5.princeton.edu/theses/thesesid.asp?ID=31175 Princeton University Senior Theses Full Record: Donald Henry Rumsfeld]&lt;/ref&gt; While at Princeton he roomed with another future Secretary of Defense, [[Frank Carlucci]]. 

Rumsfeld married his high school sweetheart Joyce H. Pierson on December 27, 1954. They have three children and six grandchildren. He attempted to get his law degree in 1956, and attended [[Georgetown University Law Center]], but did not graduate.

Rumsfeld served in the [[United States Navy]] during peacetime, from 1954 to 1957, as a [[naval aviator]] and flight instructor. His initial training was in the [[North American Aviation|North American]] [[T-6 Texan|SNJ Texan]] basic trainer after which he transitioned to flying the [[Grumman]] [[F9F Panther]] fighter. In 1957, he transferred to the [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]] and continued his naval service in flying and administrative assignments as a drilling reservist. On 1 July 1958, he was assigned to Anti-submarine Squadron 662 at [[Naval Air Station Anacostia]], [[District of Columbia]], as a selective reservist.&lt;ref name=&quot;airforcetimes.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.airforcetimes.com/legacy/new/0-AIRPAPER-1610997.php Air Force News | News from Afghanistan &amp; Iraq - Air Force Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Rumsfeld was designated aircraft commander of Anti-submarine Squadron 731 on 1 October 1960, at [[Naval Air Station Grosse Ile]], Michigan, where he flew the [[S2F Tracker]].&lt;ref name=&quot;airforcetimes.com&quot;/&gt; He transferred to the [[Individual Ready Reserve]] when he became Secretary of Defense in 1975 and retired with the rank of [[Captain (U.S. Navy)|captain]] in 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;defenselink1&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/specials/secdef_histories/bios/rumsfeld.htm DefenseLink's Rumsfeld Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in government (1962-1977)==

===Member of Congress===
In 1957, during the [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] administration, Rumsfeld served as Administrative Assistant to [[David S. Dennison, Jr.]], a Congressman representing the 11th district of Ohio. In 1959, he moved on to become a staff assistant to Congressman [[Robert P. Griffin]] of [[Michigan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bioguide&quot;&gt;[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=R000508 RUMSFELD, Donald Henry] on ''Biographical Directory of the United States Congress''.

Becker]], from 1960 to 1962,&lt;ref name=&quot;questforpresidency&quot;&gt;[http://quest.cjonline.com/stories/122900/gen_1229007572.shtml Donald Rumsfeld] biography from the [[Associated Press]]. Accessed April 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Rumsfeld would instead set his sights on becoming a member of [[United States Congress|Congress]].

He was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] for [[Illinois' 13th congressional district]] in 1962, at the age of 30, and was re-elected by large majorities in 1964, 1966, and 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse&quot;&gt;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/government/rumsfeld-bio.html Donald Rumsfeld] biography from Whitehouse.gov. Accessed April 22, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; While in Congress, he served on the Joint Economic Committee, the Committee on Science and Aeronautics, and the Government Operations Committee, as well as on the Subcommittees on Military and Foreign Operations. He was also a co-founder of the Japanese-American Inter-Parliamentary Council&lt;ref name=&quot;utexas&quot;&gt;[http://www.ford.utexas.edu/LIBRARY/exhibits/cabinet/rumsfeld.htm Donald Rumsfeld] biography from White House press release dated November 3, 1975.

As a young Congressman, Rumsfeld attended seminars at the [[University of Chicago]], an experience he credits with introducing him to the idea of an [[Volunteer military|all volunteer military]], and to the economist [[Milton Friedman]] and the [[Chicago School of Economics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.defenselink.mil/speeches/speech.aspx?speechid=216| title=Secretary of Defense Donald H.

===Nixon Administration===
[[File:Richard Nixon and Donald Rumsfeld with son Nick.jpg|thumb|right|Rumsfeld with his son, Nick, in the Oval Office with President Nixon, 1973]]
Rumsfeld resigned from Congress in 1969 — his fourth term — to serve President [[Richard Nixon]] in his administration, and he would serve in a variety of executive branch positions throughout the Nixon presidency. In 1969, Nixon sought to reform and reorganize the [[United States Office of Economic Opportunity]], an organization created during the [[Kennedy administration]] and greatly expanded as a part of [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s [[Great Society]] programs, rather than eliminate it outright. He appointed Rumsfeld Director of the organization. Rumsfeld had voted against the creation of OEO when he was in Congress, and initially rejected Nixon's offer, citing his own inherent belief that the OEO did more harm than good, and he felt that he was not the right person for the job.&lt;ref&gt;Rumsfeld, Donald (2011), pp. 119-121&lt;/ref&gt; He only accepted after a personal plea from the president.

While Director of OEO, Rumsfeld sought to reorganize OEO to serve as &quot;a laboratory for experimental programs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dr125&quot;&gt;Rumsfeld, Donald (2011), p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; Several beneficial anti-poverty programs were saved by allocated funds to them from other less-successful government programs. During this time, he hired Frank Carlucci and Dick Cheney to serve under him. 

He was the subject of one of legendary writer [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]]'s columns, alleging that &quot;anti-poverty czar&quot; Rumsfeld had cut programs to aid the poor while spending thousands to redecorate his office. Rumsfeld dictated a four page response to Anderson, labeling the accusations as falsehoods, and invited Anderson to tour his office. Despite the tour, Anderson did not retract his claims, and would only later admit that his column was a mistake.&lt;ref name=&quot;dr125&quot;/&gt;

When he left OEO in December 1970, Nixon named Rumsfeld Counsellor to the President, a general advisory position that earned him Cabinet-status.&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''By His Own Rules'' p 75&lt;/ref&gt; He was given an office in the West Wing and now regularly interacted with the Nixon administration hierarchy. He was named Director of the [[Economic Stabilization Act of 1970|Economic Stabilization Program]] in 1970 as well, and headed up the [[ACCRA Cost of Living Index|Cost of Living Council]]. In 1971 Nixon was recorded saying about Rumsfeld &quot;at least Rummy is tough enough&quot; and &quot;He's a ruthless little bastard. You can be sure of that.&quot;&lt;ref name=rummy1&gt;[http://tapes.millercenter.virginia.edu/clips/rmn_rumsfeld.html Nixon White House conversation 464-12]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Alexander Cockburn]], ''Rumsfeld: His Rise, Fall, and Catastrophic Legacy'', Simon and Schuster, 2007, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Craig Unger]], ''The Fall of the House of Bush: The Untold Story of how a Band of True Believers Seized the Executive Branch, Started the Iraq War, and Still Imperils America's Future'', Simon and Schuster, 2007, page 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Craig Unger, ''American Armageddon: How the Delusions of the Neoconservatives and the Christian Right Triggered the Descent of America--and Still Imperil Our Future'', Simon and Schuster, 2008, page 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Naomi Klein]], ''The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism'', Metropolitan Books/Henry Holt, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1973, Rumsfeld left Washington to serve as [[Ambassadors from the United States|U.S. Ambassador]] to the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) in [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]]. He served as the United States' Permanent Representative to the North Atlantic Council and the Defense Planning Committee, and the Nuclear Planning Group. In this capacity, he represented the United States in wide-ranging military and diplomatic matters, and was asked to help mediate a conflict on behalf of the United States between [[Cyprus]] and [[Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;Rumsfeld, Donald (2011), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ford Administration===
[[File:Ford meets with Rumsfeld and Cheney, April 28, 1975.jpg|thumb|right|Chief of Staff Rumsfeld (left) and Deputy-Chief of Staff [[Dick Cheney]] (right) meet with President Ford, April 1975]]

In August 1974, Rumsfeld was called back to Washington to serve as transition chairman for the new president, [[Gerald R. Ford]]. He had been Ford's confidant since their days in the House when Ford was House minority leader. As the new president became settled in, Ford appointed Rumsfeld [[White House Chief of Staff]], where he served from 1974 to 1975. 

[[File:Ford-rumsfeld.jpg|thumb|left|Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld shares a laugh with President Ford in a Cabinet meeting, 1975]]

In October 1975, Ford reshuffled his cabinet in the [[Halloween Massacre]]. He named Rumsfeld to become the 13th U.S. Secretary of Defense; [[George H. W. Bush]] became [[Director of Central Intelligence]]. According to [[Bob Woodward]]'s 2002 book ''[[Bush at War]]'', a rivalry developed between the two men and &quot;Bush senior was convinced that Rumsfeld was pushing him out to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] to end his political career.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last =Woodward|first =Bob|title =Bush At War|publisher =Simon and Schuster|year =2002|url =http://books.google.com/?id=BRzVPPstf3EC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;lpg=PA21&amp;dq=rumsfeld+ford+bush+cia+director|pages =21–22|isbn = 0-7432-4461-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]], Rumsfeld oversaw the transition to an all-volunteer military. He sought to reverse the gradual decline in the defense budget and to build up U.S. strategic and conventional forces, skillfully undermining [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Henry Kissinger]] at the [[SALT]] talks.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTInfighter&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9406EFD8153AF93BA35752C0A9679C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2|title= Defense Choice Made a Name As an Infighter|coauthors=Elaine Sciolino and Eric Schmitt|date=2001-01-08|work=New York Times|accessdate=2008-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He asserted, along with [[Team B]] (which he helped to set up),&lt;ref&gt;[http://hnn.us/articles/18668.html The Long March of Dick Cheney&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that trends in comparative U.S.-[[Soviet armed forces|Soviet]] military strength had not favored the United States for 15 to 20 years and that, if continued, they &quot;would have the effect of injecting a fundamental instability in the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;defenselink1&quot; /&gt; For this reason, he oversaw the development of [[cruise missile]]s, the [[B-1 Lancer|B-1 bomber]], and a major naval shipbuilding program.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTInfighter&quot;/&gt;

In 1977, Rumsfeld was awarded the nation's highest civilian award, the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;defenselink2&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/bios/secdef_bio.html DefenseLink's Secretary of Defense Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; Kissinger, his bureaucratic adversary, would later pay him a different sort of compliment, pronouncing him &quot;a special Washington phenomenon: the skilled full-time politician-bureaucrat in whom ambition, ability, and substance fuse seamlessly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200310u/int2003-10-08|title=Rumsfeld's Roots|last=Mann|first=James|date=2003-10-08|work=The Atlantic|accessdate=2008-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to the private sector (1977–2000)==

===Business career===
In early 1977 Rumsfeld briefly lectured at Princeton's [[Woodrow Wilson School]] and Northwestern's [[Kellogg School of Management]], located in Chicago, Illinois near his home town of Evanston. His sights instead turned to business, and from 1977 to 1985 Rumsfeld served as Chief Executive Officer, President, and then Chairman of [[G. D. Searle &amp; Company]], a worldwide pharmaceutical company based in [[Skokie, Illinois]]. During his tenure at Searle, Rumsfeld led the company's financial turnaround, thereby earning awards as the Outstanding Chief Executive Officer in the Pharmaceutical Industry from the ''Wall Street Transcript'' (1980) and ''Financial World'' (1981). In 1985, Searle was sold to [[Monsanto Company]]. Rumsfeld is believed to have earned around $12 million from this sale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beltway lion&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Winter comes for a Beltway lion; Rumsfeld rose and fell with his conviction intact | author= | work=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=2006-11-12 | page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumsfeld served as Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of [[General Instrument Corporation]] from 1990 to 1993. A leader in broadband transmission, distribution, and access control technologies for cable, satellite and terrestrial broadcasting applications, the company pioneered the development of the first all-digital [[high-definition television]] ([[High-definition television|HDTV]]) technology. After taking the company public and returning it to profitability, Rumsfeld returned to private business in late 1993.

From January 1997 until being sworn in as the 21st Secretary of Defense in January 2001, Rumsfeld served as Chairman of [[Gilead Sciences|Gilead Sciences, Inc.]] [[Gilead Sciences]] is the developer of Tamiflu ([[Oseltamivir]]), which is used in the treatment of [[H5N1|bird flu]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gilead.com/wt/sec/pr_933190157/ Press Releases: Gilead&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Rumsfeld's holdings in the company grew significantly when avian flu became a subject of popular anxiety during his later term as Secretary of Defense. Following standard practice, Rumsfeld [[recusal|recused]] himself from any decisions involving Gilead, and he directed the Pentagon's [[General Counsel]] to issue instructions outlining what he could and could not be involved in if there were an avian flu pandemic and the Pentagon had to respond.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2005-11-16-tamiflu-usat_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Roche, Gilead Sciences resolve Tamiflu conflict | first1=Julie | last1=Schmit | date=November 17, 2005 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://money.cnn.com/2005/10/31/news/newsmakers/fortune_rumsfeld/ | work=CNN | title=Rumsfeld's growing stake in Tamiflu | date=October 31, 2005 | accessdate=May 1, 2010 | first1=Nelson D. | last1=Schwartz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='GR'&gt;{{Cite news| first=[[William Engdahl]] | last= | coauthors= | title=Bird Flu: A Corporate Bonanza for the Biotech Industry | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=viewArticle&amp;code=ENG20051106&amp;articleId=1190 | work =GlobalResearch.ca | pages = | accessdate = 2008-05-24 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part-time public service===
During his business career, Rumsfeld continued part-time public service in various posts. In November 1983, Rumsfeld was appointed Special Envoy to the Middle East by President [[Ronald Reagan]], at a turbulent time in modern Middle Eastern history when Iraq was fighting Iran in the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. The United States wished for the conflict to end, and Rumsfeld was sent to the Middle East to serve as a mediator on behalf of the President.

[[File:Saddam rumsfeld.jpg|thumb|right|As President Reagan's Special Envoy to the [[Middle East]], Rumsfeld met with [[Saddam Hussein]] during a visit to [[Baghdad]] in December 1983, during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] (see video [[:File:Shakinghands high.OGG|here]]).]]

When Rumsfeld visited [[Baghdad]] on December 20, 1983, he met Saddam Hussein at Saddam's palace and had a 90-minute discussion. They largely agreed on opposing Syria's occupation of [[Lebanon]]; preventing Syrian and Iranian expansion; and preventing arms sales to Iran. Rumsfeld suggested that if U.S.-Iraq relations could improve the U.S. might support a new [[oil pipeline]] across [[Jordan]], which Iraq had opposed but was now willing to reconsider. Rumsfeld also informed Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister and [[Foreign relations of Iraq|Foreign Minister]] [[Tariq Aziz]] that &quot;Our efforts to assist were inhibited by certain things that made it difficult for us ... citing the use of chemical weapons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Graham, ''By His Own Rules'' (2009)  pp 159-60&lt;/ref&gt; 

Rumsfeld wrote in his memoir ''Known and Unknown'' that his meeting with Hussein &quot;has been the subject of gossip, rumors, and crackpot conspiracy theories for more than a quarter of a century... Supposedly I had been sent to see Saddam by President Reagan either to negotiate a secret oil deal, to help arm Iraq, or to make Iraq an American [[client state]]. The truth is that our encounter was more straightforward and less dramatic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rumsfeld, Donald (2011), p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to taking the position of Middle East envoy, Rumsfeld served as a member of the [[President's General Advisory Committee on Arms Control]] (1982–1986); President Reagan's Special Envoy on the [[Law of the Sea Treaty]] (1982–1983); a senior adviser to President Reagan's [[Panel on Strategic Systems]] (1983–1984); a member of the [[Joint Advisory Commission on U.S./Japan Relations]] (1983–1984); a member of the [[National Commission on the Public Service]] (1987–1990); a member of the [[National Economic Commission]] (1988–1989); a member of the Board of Visitors of the [[National Defense University]] (1988–1992); a member of the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]]'s [[High Definition Television Advisory Committee]] (1992–1993); a member of the [[U.S. Trade Deficit Review Commission]] (1999–2000); a member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]]; and Chairman of the [[U.S. Commission to Assess National Security Space Management and Organization]] (2000). Among his most noteworthy positions was Chairman of the nine-member [[Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States]] from January to July 1998. In its findings, the commission concluded that Iraq, Iran, and North Korea could develop intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities in five to ten years and that U.S. intelligence would have little warning before such systems were deployed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/threat/missile/rumsfeld/ Report of the Commission to Assess the Ballistic Missile Threat to the United States]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, Rumsfeld became a member of the [[National Academy of Public Administration (United States)|National Academy of Public Administration]], and was named a member of the boards of trustees of the [[Gerald R. Ford Foundation]], the [[Eisenhower Exchange Fellowships]], the [[Hoover Institution]] at [[Stanford University]] and the [[National Park Foundation]]. He was also a member of the [[U.S./Russia Business Forum]] and Chairman of the Congressional Leadership's National Security Advisory Group.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} Rumsfeld was a founder and active member of the [[Project for the New American Century]], a [[neo-conservative]] think-tank dedicated to maintaining U.S. primacy. In addition, he served as [[United Way of America|United Way]] Inter-governmental Affairs Director in [[Washington, D.C.]] from 1986 to 1989 and was asked to serve the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] as a foreign policy consultant from 1990 to 1993. He also sat on European Engineering giant [[Asea Brown Boveri]]'s board from 1990 to 2001, a company which sold two light-water nuclear reactors to the [[Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization]] for installation in [[North Korea]], as part of the [[Agreed Framework between the United States of America and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea|1994 agreed framework]] reached under President [[Bill Clinton]]. Rumsfeld's office said that he did not &quot;recall it being brought before the board at any time&quot; though ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine reported that &quot;board members were informed about this project.&quot;&lt;ref name=rummy2&gt;{{Cite news| title=Rummy's North Korea Connection; What did Donald Rumsfeld know about ABB's deal to build nuclear reactors there? And why won't he talk about it?| work=Fortune | date=2003-05-12 | page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To honor his foreign policy work, Rumsfeld was named honorary Vice-Chancellor of Yale University in 2001.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

===Presidential and vice presidential aspirations===
During [[1976 Republican National Convention]], Rumsfeld received one vote for [[Vice President of the United States]], although he did not seek the office, and the nomination was easily won by Ford's choice, Senator [[Bob Dole]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=59886 OurCampaigns]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[1980 Republican National Convention]] he also received one vote for Vice President.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=59877 OurCampaigns]&lt;/ref&gt; Economist [[Milton Friedman]] later noted that he, Friedman, regarded Reagan's pick of Bush as &quot;the worst decision not only of his campaign but of his presidency,&quot; and that Rumsfeld was instead his preference. &quot;Had he been chosen,&quot; Friedman said, &quot;I believe he would have succeeded Reagan as president and the sorry Bush-Clinton period would never have occurred.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Two Lucky People: Memoirs&quot; by Milton Friedman and Rose Friedman. 1998. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press): p. 391&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumsfeld briefly sought the Presidential nomination [[United States presidential election, 1988|in 1988]], but withdrew from the race before [[primary election|primaries]] began.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=55211 OurCampaigns]&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 election]] he initially formed a [[presidential exploratory committee]], but declined to formally enter the race. He was instead named national chairman for Republican nominee [[Bob Dole]]'s campaign.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Dole-Kemp Campaign names former Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld as its national chairman,&quot; Press Release by Dole-Kemp 1996, August 27, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to government (2001–2006)==
[[File:Rumsfeld is sworn-in as Secretary of Defense, January 20, 2001.jpg|thumb|right|Rumsfeld is administered the oath of office as the 21st Secretary of Defense on January 20, 2001 by [[Director of Administration and Management (DoD)|Director of Administration and Management]] [[David O. Cooke]] (left), as Joyce Rumsfeld holds the Bible in a ceremony at the [[Eisenhower Executive Office Building]]]]
Rumsfeld was named Secretary of Defense soon after President [[George W. Bush]] took office in 2001 despite Rumsfeld's past rivalry with the previous President Bush. Bush's first choice, [[FedEx]] founder [[Frederick W. Smith|Fred Smith]], was unavailable and Vice President-elect Cheney recommended Rumsfeld for the job.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, George W. (2010), pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumsfeld's second tenure as Secretary of Defense cemented him as the most powerful Pentagon chief since [[Robert McNamara]] and one of the most influential Cabinet members in the Bush administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2002-12-09-1a-cover_x.htm|work=USA Today|accessdate=2011-11-17|date=December 9, 2002|author=Moniz, Dave|title=Rumsfeld's abrasive style sparks conflict}}&lt;/ref&gt; His tenure would prove to be a pivotal and rocky one which led the United States military into the 21st century. Following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], Rumsfeld led the military planning and execution of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|U.S. invasion of Afghanistan]] and the subsequent [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. He pushed hard to send as small a force as possible to both conflicts, a concept codified as the [[Rumsfeld Doctrine]].

Throughout his time as Defense Secretary, Rumsfeld was noted for his candor and quick wit when giving weekly press conferences or speaking with the press.&lt;ref name=&quot;candor&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/01/20/opinion/rumsfeld-s-moment.html|accessdate=2011-11-17|date=January 20, 2002|work=The New York Times|author=Wright, Robert|title=Rumsfeld's Moment}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''U.S. News &amp; World Report'' called him &quot;a straight-talking Midwesterner&quot; who &quot;routinely has the press corps doubled over in fits of laughter.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;candor&quot;/&gt;  By the same token, his leadership was exposed to much criticism through provocative books covering the Iraq conflict, like Bob Woodward's ''State of Denial'', Thomas E. Ricks' ''Fiasco'', and Seymour Hersh's ''Chain of Command''.

===Modernizing the military===
Rumsfeld's initial task, as outlined by President Bush, was to modernize the military and transform it into a lighter fighting force. Once in office, Rumsfeld immediately announced a series of sweeping reviews intended to accomplish this, and developed a new strategy for defense more relevant to the 21st century. One of his proposals was to reorganize the DOD's global command structure of [[Unified Combatant Command]]s. [[United States Space Command]] was deactivated and [[United States Northern Command]] was created. This plan was approved by President Bush and implemented under the oversight of Rumsfeld.&lt;ref name=&quot;defenselink1&quot;/&gt;

===September 11, 2001===
[[File:The Pentagon is functioning.jpg|thumb|&quot;The Pentagon is functioning&quot; was the message Rumsfeld stressed during a press conference in the Pentagon briefing room barely eight hours after terrorists crashed a hijacked commercial jetliner into the Pentagon.

[[File:Rumsfeld and Giuliani at Ground Zero.jpg|thumb|Rumsfeld and [[New York City|New York]] [[Mayor]] [[Rudy Giuliani]] speak at the site of the World Trade Center attacks in [[Lower Manhattan]] on November 14, 2001]]

The [[September 11, 2001 attacks|United States was attacked on September 11, 2001]] by [[al Qaeda]] terrorists who hijacked commercial airliners and crashed them in coordinated strikes into both towers of the [[World Trade Center]] in [[Lower Manhattan]], [[New York City]] and the Pentagon in Washington, D.C. The fourth plane crashed into a field in [[Shanksville, Pennsylvania]], and its target was likely a prominent building in Washington, D.C., most probably either the Capitol Building or the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14778963/|title=9/11 mystery: What was Flight 93's target?|accessdate=2011-11-13|date=September 12, 2006|author=Shuster, David|publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within three hours of the start of the first hijacking and two hours after [[American Airlines Flight 11]] struck the World Trade Center, Rumsfeld raised the defense condition signaling of the United States offensive readiness to [[DEFCON|DEFCON 3]], the highest it had been since the [[Yom Kippur War|Arab-Israeli war in 1973]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.911commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf The 9/11 Commission Report&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of 9/11, Rumsfeld spoke at a Pentagon breakfast meeting. According to his later description to Larry King, he stated at the meeting that &quot;sometime in the next two, four, six, eight, ten, twelve months there would be an event that would occur in the world that would be sufficiently shocking that it would remind people again how important it is to have a strong healthy defense department that contributes to... that underpins peace and stability in our world. And that is what underpins peace and stability.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;defenselink.mil&quot;&gt;http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=2603&lt;/ref&gt;

After the strike on the Pentagon by [[American Airlines Flight 77]], Rumsfeld went out to the parking lot to assist with rescue efforts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.911commission.gov/report/911Report.pdf, p.54&lt;/ref&gt; He later recalled that &quot;I wanted to see what had happened. I wanted to see if people needed help. I went downstairs and helped for a bit with some people on stretchers. Then I came back up here and started — I realized I had to get back up here and get at it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;defenselink.mil&quot;/&gt;

===Military decisions in the wake of 9/11===

On the afternoon of September 11, Rumsfeld issued rapid orders to his aides to look for evidence of possible Iraqi involvement in regard to what had just occurred, according to notes taken by senior policy official [[Stephen Cambone]]. &quot;Best info fast.

That evening, after President Bush spoke to the nation from the Oval Office, Rumsfeld recalled musing about the President's intended response to attack terrorists from whatever territory they planned and operated. He reported questioning whether that would include attacking American allies, and suggested that the problem be magnified and viewed from a broader scope. He recommended that state-sponsors of terror, including Sudan, Libya, Iraq and Iran, be considered as possible places of sanctuary if the U.S. were to attack Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;Rumsfeld, Donald (2011), p. 346&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumsfeld wrote in ''Known and Unknown'', &quot;Much has been written about the Bush administration's focus on Iraq after 9/11. Commentators have suggested that it was strange or obsessive for the President and his advisers to have raised questions about whether Saddam Hussein was somehow behind the attack. I have never understood the controversy. I had no idea if Iraq was or was not involved, but it would have been irresponsible for any administration not to have asked the question.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rumsfeld, Donald (2011), p. 347&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Looking back on the weeks following 9/11,&quot; he wrote, &quot;Some accounts suggest an administration that seemed to have a preordained response to the attacks. From my vantage point, however, quite the opposite was the case. It was a time of discovery&amp;ndash;of seeking elusive, imperfect solutions for new problems that would not be solved quickly. There was no guidebook or road map for us to follow.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rumsfeld, Donald (2011), p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;

===Afghanistan and Iraq===
After the war in Afghanistan was launched, Rumsfeld participated in a meeting in regard to the review of the Department of Defense's Contingency Plan in the event of a war with Iraq. The plan, as it was then conceived, contemplated troop levels of up to 500,000, which Rumsfeld felt was far too many. Gordon and Trainor wrote:

{{quote|As [General] Newbold outlined the plan ... it was clear that Rumsfeld was growing increasingly irritated. For Rumsfeld, the plan required too many troops and supplies and took far too long to execute. It was, Rumsfeld declared, the &quot;product of old thinking and the embodiment of everything that was wrong with the military.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;inside&quot;&gt;Id.Gordon, Michael R. and Bernard E. Trainor, Cobra II: The Inside Story of the Invasion and Occupation of Iraq, 2006. Book excerpt from the Denver Post&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Rumsfeld's plan resulted in a lightning invasion that took Baghdad in well under a month with very few American casualties. Many government buildings, plus major museums, electrical generation infrastructure, and even oil equipment were looted and vandalized during the transition from the fall of Saddam Hussein's regime to the establishment of the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]]. A violent [[Iraqi insurgency|insurrection]] began shortly after the military operation started. After the [[Germany|German]] and [[France|French]] governments voiced opposition to invading Iraq, Rumsfeld labeled these countries as part of &quot;[[Old Europe (politics)|Old Europe]]&quot;, implying that countries that supported the war were part of a newer, modern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2687403.stm | work=BBC News | title=Outrage at 'old Europe' remarks | date=January 23, 2003 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result, Rumsfeld stirred controversy as to whether the forces that did invade Iraq were enough in size.&lt;ref name=&quot;inside&quot;/&gt; In a September 2007 interview with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', General [[Mike Jackson]], the head of the [[British army]] during the invasion, criticized Rumsfeld's plans for the invasion of Iraq as &quot;intellectually bankrupt,&quot; adding that Rumsfeld is &quot;one of those most responsible for the current situation in Iraq,&quot; and that he felt that &quot;the US approach to combating global terrorism is 'inadequate' and too focused on military might rather than [[nation building]] and diplomacy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/09/01/wirq601.xml &quot;Gen Sir Mike Jackson's attack draws US ire&quot;], ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' (online), September 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Rumsfeld responded to a question by [[Brit Hume]] of Fox News as to whether he pressed General [[Tommy Franks]] to lower his request for 400,000 troops for the war:

{{quote|Absolutely not. That's a mythology {{sic}}. This town [Washington, D.C] is filled with this kind of nonsense. The people who decide the levels of forces on the ground are not the Secretary of Defense or the President. We hear recommendations, but the recommendations are made by the combatant commanders and by members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and there hasn't been a minute in the last six years when we have not had the number of troops that the combatant commanders have requested.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/video2/player06.html?121406/121406_sr_rumsfeld&amp;Special_Report&amp;Final%20Interview&amp;acc&amp;Politics&amp;-1&amp;News&amp;486&amp;&amp;&amp;new Special Report with Brit Hume December 14, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Rumsfeld told Hume that Franks ultimately decided against such a troop level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/13/us/13cnd-army.html?pagewanted=1&amp;hp | work=The New York Times | title=Blunt Talk About Iraq at Army School | first=Elisabeth | last=Bumiller | date=October 13, 2007 | accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also controversy between Rumsfeld at the Pentagon and the CIA over who had the authority to fire [[Hellfire missiles]] from [[RQ-1 Predator|Predator drones]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gpo&quot;&gt;[http://www.gpoaccess.gov/911/pdf/sec6.pdf] (pp. 189–90, 211–214)&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the drones were not ready for deployment until 2002,&lt;ref name=&quot;gpo&quot;/&gt; [[Daniel Benjamin]] and [[Steven Simon]] have argued that &quot;these quarrels kept the Predator from being used against al Qaeda.... One individual who was at the center of the action called this episode 'typical' and complained that 'Rumsfeld never missed an opportunity to fail to cooperate. The fact is, the Secretary of Defense is an obstacle. He has helped the terrorists.'&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Benjamin and Steven Simon, ''The Next Attack'' (New York: Times Books, 2005) ISBN 0-8050-7941-6 p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Iraq invasion, U.S. troops were criticized for not protecting the historical artifacts and treasures located at the [[National Museum of Iraq]]. When asked at the time why U.S. troops did not actively seek to stop the lawlessness, Rumsfeld replied, &quot;Stuff happens... and it's untidy and freedom's untidy, and free people are free to make mistakes and commit crimes and do bad things. They're also free to live their lives and do wonderful things. And that's what's going to happen here.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;StuffHappens&quot;&gt;[http://www.defense.gov/Transcripts/Transcript.aspx?TranscriptID=2367 &quot;D Rumsfelt - Stuff Happens&quot;], April 11, 2003 2:00 PM EDT&lt;/ref&gt; He further commented that, &quot;The images you are seeing on television you are seeing over, and over, and over, and it's the same picture of some person walking out of some building with a vase, and you see it 20 times, and you think, &quot;My goodness, were there that many vases?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;StuffHappens&quot;/&gt;

Rumsfeld and General [[Richard Myers]], [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]], gave reporters an operational update on Operation Iraqi Freedom on October 2, 2003.]]
Throughout his tenure, Rumsfeld sought to remind the American people of the 9/11 attacks and threats against Americans, noting at one time in a 2006 memo to &quot;[m]ake the American people realize they are surrounded in the world by violent extremists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=MCJYFVHYHCMGNQFIQMGSFGGAVCBQWIV0?xml=/news/2007/11/02/wgulf402.xml &quot;Rumsfeld 'kept up fear of terror attacks''], Daily Telegraph UK, March 11, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FromDesk&quot;/&gt;

As Secretary of Defense, Rumsfeld was deliberate in crafting the public message from the Department of Defense. People will &quot;rally&quot; to the word &quot;sacrifice&quot;, Rumsfeld noted after a meeting. &quot;They are looking for leadership. Sacrifice = Victory.&quot; In May 2004, Rumsfeld considered whether to redefine the war on terrorism as a fight against &quot;worldwide insurgency.&quot; He advised aides &quot;to test what the results could be&quot; if the war on terrorism were renamed.&lt;ref name=&quot;FromDesk&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/31/AR2007103103095.html?hpid=topnews &quot;From the Desk of Donald Rumsfeld ...&quot;], Washington Post, November 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Rumsfeld also ordered specific public Pentagon attacks on and responses to U.S. newspaper columns that reported the negative aspects of the war, which he often personally reviewed before they were sent.&lt;ref name=&quot;FromDesk&quot;/&gt;

In October 2003, Rumsfeld personally approved a secret Pentagon &quot;roadmap&quot; on public relations, calling for &quot;boundaries&quot; between information operations abroad and the news media at home. The Roadmap advances a policy according to which as long as the U.S. government does not intentionally target the American public, it does not matter that [[psychological operations]], reach the American public.&lt;ref&gt;National Security Archive, &quot;Rumsfeld's Roadmap to Propaganda,&quot; National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 177, January 26, 2006, http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB177/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prisoner abuse and enhanced interrogation techniques===
The Department of Defense's preliminary concerns for holding, housing, and interrogating captured prisoners on the battlefield were raised during the military build-up prior to the Iraq War. Because Saddam Hussein’s military forces surrendered when faced with military action, many within the DOD, including Rumsfeld and United States Central Command General Tommy Franks, decided it was in the best interest of all to hand these prisoners over to their respective countries. Additionally, it was determined that maintaining a large holding facility was, at the time, unrealistic. Instead, the use of many facilities such as [[Abu Ghraib]] would be utilized to house prisoners prior to handing them over and Rumsfeld defended the Bush administration's decision to detain [[enemy combatants]] without protection under the [[Third Geneva Convention]]. Because of this, critics, including the [[U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee]], would hold Rumsfeld responsible for the ensuing [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] scandal. Rumsfeld himself said: &quot;These events occurred on my watch as Secretary of Defense. I am accountable for them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/05/09/iraq.abuse.main.int/ &quot;Rumsfeld 'the best'&quot; — CNN]&lt;/ref&gt; He offered his resignation to President Bush in the wake of the scandal, but it was not accepted.&lt;ref&gt;Bush, George W.

Including his time serving as the 13th Secretary of Defense under Ford from 1975 to 1977, Rumsfeld is the second-longest-serving Secretary of Defense in history, falling nine days short of the term of the longest-serving Pentagon chief, the Vietnam-era Secretary of Defense, [[Robert McNamara]].
