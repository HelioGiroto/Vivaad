Raúl Castro was a rebel commander during the 1950s; after his older brother, [[Fidel Castro]], took power, Raúl Castro was one of the most important figures in the new regime, serving as Minister of the Armed Forces from 1959 to 2008. As President, he is [[Commander in Chief]] of the [[Cuban Revolutionary Armed Forces|Armed Forces]] (Army, Navy, and Air Force) and has also been [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba|First Secretary of the Central Committee]] of the [[Communist Party of Cuba]] (PCC) since 2011. 

On 31 July 2006, Raúl Castro was designated as the [[President of the Council of State of Cuba|President of the Council of State]] in a temporary [[2006 Cuban transfer of power|transfer of power]] due to Fidel Castro's illness. According to the [[Constitution of Cuba#1976 Constitution|Cuban Constitution of 1976]], Article 94, the First Vice President of the Council of State assumes presidential duties upon the illness or death of the president.

Raúl Castro was officially elected as President by the [[National Assembly of People's Power|National Assembly]] on 24 February 2008, after Fidel Castro, who was still ailing, announced his intention not to stand for President again on 19 February 2008.&lt;ref name=BBC7252109/&gt;

Raúl Castro was elected as First Secretary of the Communist Party at its Sixth Congress on April 19, 2011, having previously served as Second Secretary under his brother for 46 years.

== Pre-1960 ==
The son of a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] immigrant father, [[Ángel Castro y Argiz|Ángel Castro]], and a Cuban mother of mixed ancestry, Lina Ruz, Raúl is the youngest of the three Castro brothers, Ramón, Fidel, and Raúl. He also has four sisters, Angela, [[Juanita Castro|Juanita]], Emma, and Agustina, and two half siblings, Lidia and Pedro Emilio, who were raised by Ángel Castro's first wife.

As youngsters, the Castro brothers were expelled from the first school they attended. Like Fidel, Raúl later attended the Jesuit School of Colegio Dolores in [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]] and [[Belen Jesuit Preparatory School|Colegio Belén]] in [[Havana]]. Raúl, as an undergraduate, studied social sciences. Whereas Fidel excelled as a student, Raúl's performance was mostly mediocre.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Raul Castro's travels and contact with Soviet KGB agent [[Nikolai Leonov]]—whom he met in 1953 during a trip to the Soviet-bloc nations and again in 1955 during his exile in Mexico City—facilitated Cuba's close ties with the Soviets after the triumph of the Revolution. Leonov would later be the USSR's KGB man in Havana.&lt;ref name=hpub /&gt; 

In 1953, Raúl was a member of the  [[26th of July Movement]] that attacked the [[Moncada Barracks]], and he spent 22 months in prison as a result of this action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Rojas | first = Marta | date = 4 September 2006 | url=http://www.granma.cu/ingles/2006/agosto/vier4/33raulmon-i.html | title =  When Raúl Castro assumed responsibility for the assault on the Moncada Garrison}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Faria| first =Miguel| title =Fidel Castro and the 26th of July Movement| url =http://haciendapublishing.com/articles/fidel-castro-and-26th-july-movement| accessdate =2004-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his exile in [[Mexico]], he participated in the preparations of the expedition of the boat ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]],'' landing in Cuba on 2 December 1956.

== A Commander in the Cuban Revolution ==
[[File:Raulche2.jpg|left|thumb|220px|Raúl Castro (left), with his arm around second-in-command, [[Ernesto &quot;Che&quot; Guevara]], in their Sierra de Cristal Mountain stronghold in Oriente Province Cuba, 1958.]]

Raúl was one of the few survivors of the Granma landing. He was part of the tiny group of survivors who managed to reach a safe haven in the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains (see the [[Cuban Revolution]]). As Fidel's brother and trusted right-hand man, and given his proven leadership abilities during and after the Moncada attack, he was given progressively bigger commands. On February 27, 1958, Raúl was made ''comandante'' and assigned the mission to cross the old province of [[Oriente Province|Oriente]] leading a column of guerrillas to open, to the northeast of that territory, the &quot;[[Frank País]] Eastern Front.&quot;

As a result of Raúl's &quot;Eastern Front&quot; operations he was not involved in the pivotal [[Operation Verano]] (which came close to destroying the main body of fighters but ended up a spectacular victory for Fidel). However, Raúl's forces remained active and grew over time.

By October 1958, after being reinforced by Fidel, the two brothers had about 2,000 fighters and they were operating freely throughout Oriente province. In December, while Che Guevara and [[Camilo Cienfuegos]] were operating around [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]], Fidel and Raúl's army laid siege to Maffo (capturing it on December 30). Their victorious army then headed to [[Santiago de Cuba]], the capital of Oriente province.

In response to the victory by [[Che Guevara]] at the [[Battle of Santa Clara]], the [[U.S.]]-backed President [[Fulgencio Batista]] fled Cuba in the early morning of 1 January 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Audio: [http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=98937598 Cuba Marks 50 Years Since 'Triumphant Revolution'] by Jason Beaubien, ''NPR All Things Considered'', 1 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The two Castro brothers with their army arrived on the outskirts of Santiago de Cuba and said their forces would storm the city at 6&amp;nbsp;PM January 1 if it did not first surrender. The commander (Colonel Rego Rubido) surrendered Santiago de Cuba without a fight. The war was over and Fidel was able to take power in Havana when he arrived on 8 January 1959.

Raúl's abilities as a military leader during the revolution are hard to see clearly. Unlike Che Guevara or Cienfuegos, Raúl had no significant victories he could claim credit for on his own. The last operations (which were clearly successful) were conducted with his older brother Fidel present (and in command).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/report/1984/BLJ.htm The Spirit Of Moncada: Fidel Castro's Rise To Power, 1953 - 1959]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Batista's fall, Raúl was responsible for overseeing the summary [[firing squad|execution]] of scores of soldiers loyal to deposed president Batista.&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;{{cite news

== Post-1959 ==
Raúl Castro Ruz was a member of the National Leadership of the Integrated Revolutionary PO Organizations (established July 1961; dissolved March 1962) and of the United Party of the Socialist Revolution of Cuba (established March 1962; dissolved October 1965). He has been a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Cuba and the Second Secretary of its Politburo since the Party's formation in October 1965; also, the First Vice President of the [[Cuban Council of State]], of the [[Cuban National Assembly|National Assembly of the Popular Power]] and of the [[Council of Ministers of Cuba|Council of Ministers]] since these were created in 1976. He was appointed Minister of the Revolutionary Armed Forces when the Ministry was founded in October 1959 and served in that capacity until February 2008; he is also the nation's highest ranking general.

== Temporary assumption of Presidential duties ==
:{{See also|2006 Cuban transfer of duties}}
On 31 July 2006, Fidel Castro's personal secretary Carlos Valenciaga announced on state-run television that Fidel Castro would provisionally hand over the duties of [[President of the Council of State of Cuba]], President of the [[Council of Ministers of Cuba]], [[First Secretary of the Communist Party of Cuba]] and [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the Armed Forces to Raúl Castro while Fidel underwent and recovered from intestinal surgery to repair [[gastrointestinal bleeding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Many commentators consider Raúl Castro to be a political hardliner who will maintain the Communist Party of Cuba's influence in the country. However, there are others who believe that he is more pragmatic than his older brother and willing to institute some market-oriented economic policies. It is speculated that he favours a variant of the current Chinese political and economic model for Cuba in the hopes of preserving some elements of the socialist system.&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;/&gt; However, none of these speculations has ever been confirmed by Raúl himself.

Raúl is considered by some to be less charismatic than his brother [[Fidel Castro]], who remained largely out of public view during the transfer of duty period.&lt;ref name=reuters-09-03&gt;{{cite news|title=Castro recovering and giving orders: Chavez|date=3 September 2006 |publisher=Reuters |url=http://today.reuters.com/news/articlenews.aspx?type=topNews&amp;storyID=2006-09-03T213241Z_01_N03251032_RTRUKOC_0_US-CUBA-CASTR0-VENEZUELA.xml&amp;archived=False}}&lt;/ref&gt; His few public appearances included hosting a gathering of leaders of the [[Non-Aligned Movement|Non-Aligned nations]] in September 2006, and leading the national commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the ''[[Granma (yacht)|Granma]]'' boat landing, which also became Fidel's belated 80th birthday celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;NPR &quot;Weekend Edition, Saturday&quot;, report of Gary Marx, 2 December 2006 http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6569909&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Raul Castro greets Chávez on Fidel's 80th birthday | url=http://www.turkishpress.com/news.asp?id=137334 | accessdate = 2008-02-20 | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech to university students, Raúl stated that a communist system in Cuba would remain, and that &quot;Fidel is irreplaceable, unless we all replace him together.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =  Raul Castro 'not imitating Fidel' | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6199369.stm | accessdate = 2008-02-20 | year = 2008  | work=BBC News | date=21 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 2007, Raúl presided over the [[May Day]] celebrations in Havana. According to ''[[Granma (newspaper)|Granma]] ''the crowd reached over one million participants, with delegations from over 225 organizations and 52 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = granma.cu - Millions of Cubans demand imprisonment for terrorist Posada Carriles  | url=http://granma.cu/ingles/2007/mayo/mar1/18desfile-i.html | accessdate = 2008-02-20 | year = 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080305023140/http%3A//granma.cu/ingles/2007/mayo/mar1/18desfile-i.html |archivedate = March 5, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raúl is known for his businesslike, unanimated delivery of speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Raul offers Cuba a quieter Castro voice - CNN.com | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/02/19/raul.castro.ap/index.html Raul offers Cuba a quieter Castro voice | accessdate = 2008-02-20 | year = 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080229044442/http%3A//edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/02/19/raul.castro.ap/index.html |archivedate = February 29, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==President of Cuba==
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev in Cuba 28 November 2008-4.jpg|thumbnail|300px|right|Castro with [[President of Russia|Russian president]] [[Dmitry Medvedev]].]]

After assuming temporary control over the presidency, Raúl Castro was elected as the new president during a legislative session held at Cuba's Palace of Conventions in Havana. The 597 deputies unanimously elected a 31-member Council of State for a term of five years, which in turn elected Raul as president.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-02/25/content_7662257.htm&lt;/ref&gt; His administration has since announced several economic reforms. In March 2008, the government removed restrictions against the purchase of numerous products not available under Fidel Castro's administration including DVD-players, computers, rice cookers and microwaves.&lt;ref name=Neill&gt;{{cite news | title = Raul Castro pushes change for Cubans |first=Morgan|last=Neill| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/americas/04/26/raul.castro/ | accessdate = 2008-04-26 | work=CNN | date=26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to boost food production, the government turned over unused state-owned land to private farmers and cooperatives and moved much of the decision-making process regarding land use from the national level to the municipal level.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Frank, &quot;Raúl Castro Overhauls Cuba's Farm Bureaucracy&quot;, ''Reuters News'', 1 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2008, the government overhauled the salary structure of all state-run companies so that harder-working employees could be rewarded with higher wages.&lt;ref&gt;Frances Robles, &quot;Cubans Who Work More Will Get Higher Salaries&quot;, ''Miami Herald'', 12 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the government has removed restrictions against the use of cell phones and is investigating travel restrictions on Cubans.&lt;ref name=Neill/&gt;

In regards to relations with the U.S., Raúl Castro said in an interview:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The American people are among our closest neighbors. We should respect each other. We have never held anything against the American people. Good relations would be mutually advantageous. Perhaps we cannot solve all of our problems, but we can solve a good many of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;thenation.com&quot;&gt;http://www.thenation.com/article/conversations-chaacutevez-and-castro?page=0,2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 2009, [[2009 Cuban government dismissals|Raúl Castro dismissed some officials]].

In April 2011 Raúl announced a plan of 300 economic reforms similar to the Chinese economic model, among them are the limitation of presidential mandates including himself, encouraging private initiative, reducing state spending, encouraging foreign investment and agrarian reforms.

==Public and personal life==
Castro married [[Vilma Espín]], a former [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] [[chemical engineering]] student and the daughter of a wealthy [[rum]] distiller, on 26 January 1959.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mathaba.net/news/?x=614847 &quot;Raul Castro Visited New Housing Project in Santiago de Cuba&quot; ''Cuban News Agency'' via ''Cuban Radio''].

In an interview in 2006, following his assumption of presidential duties, Raúl Castro commented on his public profile stating: &quot;I am not used to making frequent appearances in public, except at times when it is required ... I have always been discreet, that is my way, and in passing I will clarify that I am thinking of continuing in that way&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Fidel Castro mystery - Sentinel &amp; Enterprise | url=http://www.sentinelandenterprise.com/ci_4249757 | accessdate = 2008-02-20 | year = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
