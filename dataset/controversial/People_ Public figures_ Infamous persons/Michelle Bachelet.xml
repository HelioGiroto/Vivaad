'''Verónica Michelle Bachelet Jeria''' ({{IPA-es|miˈtʃel vatʃeˈlet}}; born September 29, 1951) is a [[Socialist Party of Chile|Social Democrat]] politician who was [[President of Chile]] from 11 March 2006 to 11 March 2010. She was the first female president of her country. In September 2010 Bachelet was appointed as the head of [[UN Women]] by [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]].

Bachelet won the [[Chilean presidential election, 2005-2006|2006 presidential election]] in a runoff, beating center-right businessman and former senator [[Sebastián Piñera]] (who eventually succeeded Bachelet as President) with 53.5% of the vote. She campaigned on a platform of continuing Chile's [[free-market]] policies, while increasing [[social security|social benefits]] to help reduce the gap between rich and poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;ft&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/2af1a9be-6b14-11dc-9410-0000779fd2ac.html#axzz1XRDFjYu9 |title=/ Life &amp; Arts - First among unequals: Chile’s president |publisher=Ft.com |date=2007-09-29 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bachelet, a [[pediatrics|pediatrician]] and [[epidemiologist]] with studies in [[military strategy]], served as Health Minister and Defense Minister under her predecessor, President [[Ricardo Lagos]]. She is a [[legal separation|separated]] mother of three and describes herself as an [[agnosticism|agnostic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Family background==

Bachelet is the second child of archaeologist Ángela Jeria Gómez and [[Chilean Air Force|Air Force]] [[Brigadier General]] [[Alberto Bachelet|Alberto Bachelet Martínez]]. Her paternal great-great-grandfather, Louis-Joseph Bachelet Lapierre, was a [[French Chilean|French]] wine merchant from [[Chassagne-Montrachet]] who emigrated to Chile with his [[Paris]]ian wife, Françoise Jeanne Beault, in 1860 hired as a wine-making expert by the Subercaseaux vineyards in southern [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]]. Bachelet Lapierre's son, Germán—Michelle Bachelet's great-grandfather—was born in Santiago, Chile, in 1862, and married in 1891 to Luisa Brandt Cadot, a Chilean of French-[[Swiss Chilean|Swiss]] origin, giving birth in 1894 to Michelle Bachelet's grandfather Alberto Bachelet Brandt. Her maternal great-grandfather, [[Máximo Jeria|Máximo Jeria Chacón]], of alleged [[Greek Chilean|Greek]] heritage, was the first person to receive a degree in [[agronomy|agronomic engineering]] in Chile and founded several agronomy schools in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;cidob&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Lely Johnson, the daughter of an English physician working in Chile. Their son, Máximo Jeria Johnson, married Angela Gómez Zamora. Their union produced five children, the fourth of whom became Michelle Bachelet's mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genealog.cl/Chile/J/Jeria/#JeriaJohnson,Maximo |title=Familia Jeria (Geria) |publisher=Genealog.cl |date= |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
===Childhood years===

Bachelet was born in [[Santiago, Chile|Santiago]], and spent many of her childhood years traveling around her native Chile, moving with her family from one [[military base]] to another. She lived and attended primary school in [[Quintero]], Cerro Moreno, [[Antofagasta]] and [[San Bernardo]]. In 1962 she moved with her family to the [[United States]], where her father was assigned to the military mission at the Chilean Embassy in [[Washington, DC]], USA. Her family lived for almost two years in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], where she attended Western Junior High School (now  [[Westland Middle School]]) and learned to speak English fluently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Returning to Chile in 1964, she graduated from high school in 1969 at Liceo Nº 1 Javiera Carrera, a prestigious girls' public school, finishing near the top of her class.&lt;ref name=&quot;lavidade&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;notasyPAA&quot;&gt;{{cite web

She entered medical school at the [[Universidad de Chile|University of Chile]] in 1970, after obtaining one of the highest national scores in the university admission test.&lt;ref name=&quot;lavidade&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;notasyPAA&quot; /&gt; She originally wanted to study [[sociology]] or [[economics]], but was prevailed upon by her father to study medicine instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Detention and exile===

Facing growing food shortages, the government of [[Salvador Allende]] placed Bachelet's father in charge of the Food Distribution Office. When General [[Augusto Pinochet]] came to power in the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|11 September 1973 coup]], General Bachelet, refusing exile, was detained at the Air War Academy under charges of [[treason]]. Following months of daily torture at Santiago's Public Prison on 12 March 1974, he suffered a [[cardiac arrest]] that resulted in his death.&lt;!--''''''Bachelet's then-boyfriend, Jaime López, was also detained and tortured before his'''''' [[forced disappearance]].--&gt; On 10 January 1975, Bachelet and her mother were detained at their apartment by two [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]] agents, who blindfolded them and drove them to [[Villa Grimaldi]], a notorious secret detention center in Santiago, where they were separated and subjected to interrogation and torture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some days later they were transferred to [[List of concentration and internment camps#Chile|Cuatro Álamos (&quot;Four Poplars&quot;) detention center]], where they were held until the end of January. Later in 1975, thanks to sympathetic connections in the military, both were exiled to [[Australia]], where Bachelet's older brother Alberto had moved in 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;lavidade&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1975, Bachelet left Australia and later moved to [[East Germany]], to an apartment assigned to her by the German Democratic Republic (GDR) government in [[Am Stern]], [[Potsdam]]; her mother joined her a month later, living separately in [[Leipzig]]. In October 1976 she began working at a communal clinic in the [[Babelsberg]] neighborhood, as a preparation step to continue her medical studies at an East German university. During this period she met architect Jorge Leopoldo Dávalos Cartes, another Chilean exile, whom she married in 1977. In January 1978 she went to Leipzig to learn [[German language|German]] at the Karl Marx University's [[Herder Institute]] (now the [[University of Leipzig]]). Her first child with Dávalos, Jorge Alberto Sebastián, was born there in June 1978. She returned to Potsdam in September 1978 to continue her medical studies at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] for two years. Five months after enrolling as a student, however, she obtained authorization to return to her country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Return to Chile===

In February 1979, Bachelet returned to Chile from East Germany. Her medical school credits from the GDR were not transferred, forcing her to resume her studies from where she had left off before fleeing the country. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} She graduated as M.D. on January 7, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webhosting.superdesalud.cl/bases/prestadoresindividuales.nsf/WebRegistro?OpenFrameSet Registro Nacional de Prestadores Individuales de Salud], Superintendencia de Salud.&lt;/ref&gt; She wished to work in the public sector wherever attention was most needed, applying for a position as [[general practitioner]]; her petition was, however, rejected by the military government on &quot;political grounds.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;govbio&quot; /&gt; Instead, because of her academic performance and published papers, she earned a scholarship to specialize in [[pediatrics]] and [[public health]] at Roberto del Río Children's Hospital (1983&amp;ndash;1986). During this time she also worked at [[PIDEE]] (Protection of Children Injured by States of Emergency Foundation), a [[non-governmental organization]] helping children of the tortured and missing in Santiago and [[Chillán]]. She was head of the foundation's Medical Department between 1986 and 1990. Some time after her second child with Dávalos, Francisca Valentina, was born in February 1984, she and her husband legally separated. Between 1985 and 1987, Bachelet had a romantic relationship with Alex Vojkovic Trier,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This affair turned into a minor issue during her presidential campaign, during which she argued that she never supported any of Vojkovic's activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;cidob&quot; /&gt;

In 1990, after [[Chilean transition to democracy|democracy was restored in Chile]], Bachelet worked for the Ministry of Health's West Santiago Health Service and was a consultant for the [[Pan-American Health Organization]], the [[World Health Organization]] and the [[Deutsche Gesellschaft für Technische Zusammenarbeit|German Corporation for Technical Cooperation]]. While working for the National AIDS Commission (Conasida) she became romantically involved with Aníbal Hernán Henríquez Marich, a fellow [[physician]]—and right-wing Pinochet supporter—who fathered her third child, Sofía Catalina, in December 1992; their relationship ended, however, a few years later. Between March 1994 and July 1997, Bachelet worked as Senior Assistant to the Deputy Health Minister. Driven by an interest in civil-military relations, in 1996 Bachelet began studies in [[military strategy]] at the [[National Academy of Political and Strategic Studies]] (ANEPE) in Chile, obtaining first place in her class.&lt;ref name=&quot;govbio&quot; /&gt; Her student achievement earned her a presidential scholarship, permitting her to continue her studies in the [[United States]] at the [[Inter-American Defense College]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], completing a Continental Defense Course in 1998. That same year she returned to Chile to work for the Defense Ministry as Senior Assistant to the Defense Minister. She subsequently graduated from a [[Master's degree|Master's]] program in [[military science]] at the [[Military of Chile|Chilean Army]]'s War Academy.

==Political life==
===Involvement in politics===

In her first year as a university student (1970), Bachelet became a member of the [[Socialist Youth]] (then presided by future deputy and later [[forced disappearance|disappeared]] physician [[Carlos Lorca]], who has been cited as her political mentor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the immediate aftermath of the coup, she and her mother worked as couriers for the underground [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]] directorate that was trying to organize a [[resistance movement]]; eventually almost all of them were captured and [[Forced disappearance|disappeared]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| language=Spanish
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following her return from exile she became politically active during the second half of the 1980s, fighting—though not on the front line—for the re-establishment of democracy in Chile.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} In 1995 she became part of the party's Central Committee, and from 1998 until 2000 she was an active member of the Political Commission.

In 1996 Bachelet ran against future presidential adversary [[Joaquín Lavín]] for the mayorship of [[Las Condes]], a wealthy Santiago suburb and a right-wing stronghold. Lavín won the 22-candidate election with nearly 78% of the vote, while she finished fourth with 2.35%. At the 1999 presidential primary of the [[Concert of Parties for Democracy]] (CPD), Chile's governing coalition from 1990 to 2010, she worked for Ricardo Lagos's nomination, heading the Santiago electoral zone.

===Work as minister===
[[Image:BacheletRumsfeld.jpg|thumb|Bachelet, as [[Minister of Defense]], meeting with U.S. [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] in 2002]]

On March 11, 2000 Bachelet—virtually unknown at the time—was appointed [[Minister of Health]] by President Ricardo Lagos. She began an in-depth study of the public health-care system that led to the AUGE plan a few years later. She was also given the task of eliminating waiting lists in the saturated public hospital system within the first 100 days of Lagos's government. She reduced waiting lists by 90%, but was unable to eliminate them completely&lt;ref name=&quot;cidob&quot;/&gt; and offered her resignation, which was promptly rejected by the President. Controversially, she allowed free distribution of the [[morning-after pill]] for victims of [[sexual abuse]].

On January 7, 2002 Bachelet was appointed Defense Minister, becoming the first woman to hold this post in a Latin American country and one of the few in the world. While Minister of Defense she promoted reconciliatory gestures between the military and victims of the dictatorship, culminating in the historic 2003 declaration by General [[Juan Emilio Cheyre]], head of the army, that &quot;never again&quot; would the military subvert democracy in Chile. She also oversaw a reform of the military pension system and continued with the process of modernization of the Chilean armed forces with the purchasing of new military equipment, while engaging in international peace operations.

A moment which has been cited as key to Bachelet's chances to the presidency came in mid-2002 during a flood in northern Santiago where she, as Defense Minister, led a rescue operation on top of an [[Amphibious vehicle|amphibious tank]], wearing a cloak and military cap.&lt;ref name=&quot;cidob&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cerc.cl/Publicaciones/Huneeus%20y%20Lopez%20Libro%20Las%20Elecciones%20Chilenas.pdf ]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lanacionbsas&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/788220-asumio-bachelet-e-hizo-historia |title=Asumió Bachelet e hizo historia - 12.03.2006 - lanacion.com |publisher=Lanacion.com.ar |date= |accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential candidacy===

[[File:Debate televisivo Canal 13 CNN (Bachelet).jpg|thumb|right|Bachelet during a television debate in 2005.]]

In late 2004, following a surge of her popularity in opinion polls, Bachelet was established as the only CPD figure able to defeat Lavín, and she was asked to become the Socialists' candidate for the presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

On January 28, 2005 she was named the Socialist Party's candidate for president.

An [[open primary]] scheduled for July 2005 to define the sole presidential candidate of the CPD was canceled after Bachelet's only rival, [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrat]] [[Soledad Alvear]], a cabinet member in the first three CPD administrations, pulled out early due to a lack of support within her own party and in opinion polls.

At the December 2005 election, Bachelet faced the center-right candidate [[Sebastián Piñera]] ([[National Renewal (Chile)|RN]]), the right-wing candidate [[Joaquín Lavín]] ([[Independent Democratic Union|UDI]]) and the leftist candidate [[Tomás Hirsch]] ([[Juntos Podemos Más|JPM]]). As predicted by opinion polls, she failed to obtain the [[absolute majority]] needed to win the election outright, winning 46% of the vote. In the runoff election on January 15, 2006, Bachelet faced Piñera, and won the presidency with 53.5% of the vote, thus becoming her country's [[List of women heads of state|first female elected president]] and the first woman who was not the wife of a previous head of state or political leader to reach the presidency of a [[Latin America]]n nation in a [[direct election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Barrionuevo |first=Alexei |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/michelle_bachelet/index.html |title=Michelle Bachelet - The New York Times |publisher=Topics.nytimes.com |date=2010-03-11 |accessdate=2011-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 30, 2006, after being declared President-elect by the Elections Qualifying Court (Tricel), Bachelet announced her cabinet of ministers, which was unprecedentedly composed of an equal number of men and women, as was promised during her campaign. In keeping with the coalition's internal [[balance of power (parliament)|balance of power]] she named seven ministers from the [[Christian Democrat Party of Chile|Christian Democrat Party]] (PDC), five from the [[Party for Democracy]] (PPD), four from the [[Socialist Party of Chile|Socialist Party]] (PS), one from the [[Social Democrat Radical Party]] (PRSD) and three without party affiliation. In the days that followed, she named the group of deputy ministers and regional intendants, following the same rule of &quot;gender parity.&quot;{{Clear}}

===First days===

Bachelet was sworn in as President of the Republic of Chile on March 11, 2006 in a ceremony held in a plenary session of the [[National Congress of Chile|National Congress]] in [[Valparaíso]] which was attended by many foreign heads of states and delegates.&lt;ref name=&quot;lanacionbsas&quot;/&gt;

Most of Bachelet's first three months as president were spent working on 36 measures she had promised during her campaign to implement during her first 100 days in office. They ranged from simple presidential decrees, such as providing free health care for older patients, to complex bills to reform the social security system and the electoral system.

For her first [[state visit]], Bachelet chose [[Argentina]], arriving in [[Buenos Aires]] on 21 March. There she met with president [[Néstor Kirchner]], with whom she signed strategic agreements in energy and infrastructure, including the possibility of launching a bidding process to operate the [[Transandine Railway]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/internacional/2006/03/21/214249/presidentes-bachelet-y-kirchner-firmaron-acuerdo-estrategico.html |title=Presidentes Bachelet y Kirchner firmaron acuerdo estratégico |publisher=Emol.com |date=2006-03-21 |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestic affairs===
====Social policies====

In March 2006 Bachelet created an advisory committee to reform the pension system, which was headed by former budget director Mario Marcel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://economia.terra.cl/noticias/noticia.aspx?idNoticia=200603131723_INV_29130464 |title=Comisión Reforma Previsional será encabezada por Mario Marcel - Terra |publisher=Economia.terra.cl |date= |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commission issued its final report in July 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2006/07/06/224273/comision-marcel-propone-equiparar-edad-de-jubilacion-de-hombres-y-mujeres.html |title=Comisión Marcel propone equiparar edad de jubilación de hombres y mujeres |publisher=Emol.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2008 Bachelet signed the bill into law. The new legislation established a Basic Solidarity Pension (PBS) and a Solidarity Pension Contribution (APS), guaranteeing a minimum pension for the 60% poorest segment of the population, regardless of their contribution history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nip-lac.org/uploads/Incentives_under_the_New_Solidarity_Pillar_in_Chile.pdf Incentives under the New Pension Solidarity Pillar in Chile], Eduardo Fajnzylber.

In October 2006 Bachelet enacted legislation to protect [[subcontracting|subcontracted employees]], which would benefit an estimated 1.2 million workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/prontus_nots/site/artic/20061016/pags/20061016121658.html |title=Presidenta Bachelet promulgó la ley de Subcontratación |publisher=Cooperativa.cl |date=2006-10-16 |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009 she introduced [[Equal pay for women|pay equality legislation]], guaranteeing equal pay for equal work in the private sector, regardless of gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias_v2/site/artic/20090602/pags/20090602121046.html |title=nacion.cl - Bachelet promulgĂł ley sobre igualdad de sueldos entre hombres y mujeres |publisher=Lanacion.cl |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2011-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2009 Bachelet signed the &quot;Chile Grows with You&quot; plan into law, providing comprehensive social services to vulnerable children from ages zero to six. That law also established a social welfare management framework called the &quot;Intersectoral Social Protection System&quot;, made up of subsystems, such as &quot;Chile Solidario&quot; and &quot;Chile Grows with You&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idLey=20379 Law 20,379], Chile Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2008 and 2010 the Bachelet administration delivered a so-called &quot;literary briefcase&quot; (a box of books including encyclopedias, dictionaries, poetry works and books for both children and adults) to the 400 thousand poorest families with children attending primary school from first to fourth grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Publicado por Cauquenesnet.com |url=http://dianoticias.cauquenesnet.com/2008/04/bachelet-comenz-la-entrega-del-maletn.html |title=Cauquenesnet.com - Día-Noticias: Bachelet comenzó la entrega del Maletín Literario |publisher=Dianoticias.cauquenesnet.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, Bachelet launched the &quot;I Choose my PC&quot; program, awarding free computers to poor seventh graders with excellent academic performance attending government-subsidized schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enlaces.cl/index.php?t=44&amp;i=2&amp;cc=686.218&amp;tm=3 |title=Enlaces - CET - Ministerio de Educación |publisher=Enlaces.cl |date= |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2009 and 2010 Bachelet delivered [[layette]]s to all babies born in public hospitals, which are about 80% of total births.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BioBioChile |url=http://www.biobiochile.cl/2009/09/30/presidenta-michelle-bachelet-inicia-entrega-de-ajuares-a-recien-nacidos.shtml |title=BioBioChile - Presidenta Michelle Bachelet inicia entrega de ajuares a reciĂŠn nacidos |publisher=Biobiochile.cl |date= |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3tv.cl/index.php?m=video&amp;v=6888 |title=3TV - Bachelet inició entrega de ajuares para recién nacidos (01/10/09) |publisher=3tv.cl |date= |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, Bachelet promulgated a law allowing the distribution of [[Emergency contraception|emergency contraception pills]] in public and private health centers, including to persons under 14, without parental consent. The law also requires [[high school]]s to add a [[sexual education]] program to their curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leychile.cl/Navegar?idLey=20418 Law 20,418], Chile Library of Congress.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Student protests====

Bachelet's first political crisis came in late April 2006, when massive [[2006 student protests in Chile|high school student demonstrations]]—unseen in three decades—broke out throughout the country, demanding a rise of quality levels in public education. In June Bachelet sought to dampen the student protests by setting up an 81-member advisor committee, including education experts from all political backgrounds, representatives of ethnic groups, parents, teachers, students, school owners, university rectors, people from diverse religious denominations, etc. Its purpose was to propose changes to the country's educational system and serve as a forum to share ideas and views. The committee issued its final report in December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.cl/prontus_noticias/site/artic/20061211/pags/20061211124623.html |title=nacion.cl - Bachelet recibe informe de educaciĂłn agradeciendo labor del Consejo |publisher=Lanacion.cl |date=2006-12-11 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009 Bachelet signed the education reform bill into law, which created two new regulatory bodies: a Superintendency on Education and a Quality Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/bachelet-promulgo-la-nueva-ley-general-de-educacion/prontus_nots/2009-08-17/131658.html |title=Bachelet promulgó la nueva Ley General de Educación |publisher=Cooperativa.cl |date= |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transantiago====

During her presidency Bachelet opened 18 new subway stations in Santiago, nine in 2006, one in 2009 and eight in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2006/08/16/228249/bachelet-inaugura-linea-4-a-de-metro-de-santiago.html |title=Bachelet inaugura Línea 4 A de Metro de Santiago |publisher=Emol.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtt.gob.cl/prontus_mtt/site/artic/20070130/pags/20070130181013.html |title=Ministerio de Transportes y Telecomunicaciones - Gobierno de Chile &amp;#124; PRESIDENTA MICHELLE BACHELET INAUGURÓ EXTENSIÓN DE LA LÍNEA 2 NORTE DEL METRO QUE BENEFICIA A MÁS DE 670.000 PERSONAS |publisher=Mtt.gob.cl |date=2007-01-30 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009 Bachelet announced the construction of a new subway line in Santiago, to be operational in 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2009/12/29/391418/bachelet-anuncia-construccion-de-nueva-linea-del-metro.html |title=Bachelet anuncia construcción de nueva línea del Metro |publisher=Emol.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the date was later changed to mid-2016&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cooperativa.cl/prontus_nots/site/artic/20110713/asocfile/20110713083004/hes_2011070105671_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;).

In February 2007 Santiago's [[transport system]] was radically altered with the introduction of [[Transantiago]], designed under the previous administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;/&gt; The system was nearly unanimously condemned by the media, the users and the opposition, significantly damaging her popularity, and leading to the sacking of her Transport minister. On her decision not to abort the plan's start, she said in April 2007 she was given erroneous information which caused her to act against her &quot;instincts.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In September 2008 Chile's Constitutional Court declared a US$400 million loan by the [[Inter-American Development Bank]] to fund the transport system unconstitutional. Bachelet —who had been forced to ask for the loan after Congress had refused to approve funds for the beleaguered program in November 2007— made use of an emergency clause in the [[Constitution of Chile|Constitution]] that grants funds equivalent to 2% of the fiscal budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forexdaily.org.ru/Dow_Jones/page.htm?id=231796 |title=UPDATE: Chile Govt To Use Emergency Funding For Transit System |publisher=Forexdaily.org.ru |date=2008-09-05 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008 she invoked the emergency clause again after Congress once again denied funds for the system for 2009.

Bachelet and the government were criticized for a &quot;slow response&quot; to the disaster, which hit on a Saturday at 3:34 in the morning&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;/&gt; and left most of the country without electricity, phone or Internet access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peru.com/noticias/portada20100301/83678/Ya-son-723-los-muertos-por-el-fuerte-terremoto-de-88-grados-que-destruyo-gran-parte-de-Chile |title=Ya son 723 los muertos por el fuerte terremoto de 8.8 grados que destruyó gran parte de Chile |publisher=Peru.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/8540289.stm |title=Massive earthquake strikes Chile |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-02-28 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Barrionuevo |first=Alexei |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/02/world/americas/02chile.html |title=Chile Officials Call for Aid as Devastation Sinks In |location=Chile |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2010-03-01 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachelet declared a &quot;[[State of Emergency|state of catastrophe]]&quot; and on Sunday afternoon sent military troops to the most affected areas in an effort to quell scenes of looting and arson.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;/&gt; She also imposed night [[curfew]]s in the most affected cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hough |first=Andrew |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/southamerica/chile/7361122/Chile-earthquake-President-Michelle-Bachelet-failed-to-grasp-scale-of-devastation.html |title=Chile earthquake: President Michelle Bachelet 'failed to grasp scale of devastation' |publisher=Telegraph |date= 2010-03-03|accessdate=2011-09-10 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was criticized for not deploying the troops fast enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=124285980 |title=Chile's Leader Faces Criticism Over Quake Response |publisher=NPR |date=2010-03-03 |accessdate=2011-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Por Editor EA en Marzo 7, 2010 |url=http://informe21.com/actualidad/chile-michelle-bachelet-impresionada-objetos-saqueados-terremoto |title=Chile: Michelle Bachelet impresionada con objetos saqueados tras terremoto |publisher=Informe21.com |date=2010-03-07 |accessdate=2011-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Human rights====

In January 2009 Bachelet opened the Museum of Memory in Santiago, documenting the horrors of Pinochet's 16-and-a-half year dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2010/03/31/the-art-of-darkness.html |title=The Politics of Memory Museums |publisher=The Daily Beast |date=2010-03-31 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November she promulgated a law (submitted to Congress during the previous administration) creating the National Institute for Human Rights, with the goal protecting and promoting [[human rights]] in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BioBioChile |url=http://www.biobiochile.cl/2009/11/24/presidenta-bachelet-promulga-ley-que-crea-el-instituto-nacional-de-derechos-humanos.shtml |title=BioBioChile - Presidenta Bachelet promulga ley que crea el Instituto Nacional de Derechos Humanos |publisher=Biobiochile.cl |date= |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law also allowed for the reopening of the [[Rettig Report|Rettig]] and [[Valech Report|Valech commissions]] for 18 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=post |url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/politica/2011/08/674-387056-9-mandatario-recibio-en-la-moneda-el-segundo-informe-de-la-comision-valech.shtml |title=Mandatario recibió en La Moneda el segundo informe de la Comisión Valech &amp;#124; Política |publisher=La Tercera |date= |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other legislation passed====

In August 2008 Bachelet signed a [[freedom of information legislation|freedom of information]] bill into law, which became effective in April 2009.

In January 2010 Bachelet enacted a law creating the Ministry for the Environment. The new legislation also created the Environmental Evaluation Service and the Superintendency for the Environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latercera.com/contenido/680_216969_9.shtml |title=Bachelet promulgó ley que crea ministerio de Medio Ambiente &amp;#124; NACIONAL |publisher=latercera.com |date=2010-07-31 |accessdate=2011-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loc.gov/lawweb/servlet/lloc_news?disp3_l205401817_text |title=Chile: New Law Creates Ministry for the Environment, Other Environmental Agencies - Global Legal Monitor - Law Library of Congress (Library of Congress) |publisher=Loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Economy====

Bachelet was widely credited for resisting calls from politicians from her own coalition to spend the huge copper revenues to close the country's income gap.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rohter |first=Larry |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/world/americas/07chile.html |title=Chile Copper Windfall Forces Hard Choices on Spending - New York Times |location=Chile |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2007-01-07 |accessdate=2011-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead in 2007 she created the Economic and Social Stabilization Fund, a [[sovereign wealth fund]] which accumulates fiscal surpluses which are above 1% of [[GDP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swfinstitute.org/fund/chile.php |title=Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute - Social and Economic Stabilisation Fund - Chile |publisher=Swfinstitute.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy allowed her to finance new social policies and provide economic stimulus packages when the 2008 financial crisis hit the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;/&gt;

During Bachelet's four years in office the economy grew at an average of 3.3% (2.1% in per capita terms), with a high of 5.8% in 2006 and a negative growth of 0.9% in 2009, due to the global financial crisis. The [[minimum wage]] was increased at an average of 2% per year in real terms (the lowest of any president since 1990), while unemployment hovered between seven and eight percent during her first three years and rose to nearly 11% during 2009. Inflation averaged 4.5% during her term, reaching close to 9% during 2008, due to an increase in food prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2012/01/weodata/weorept.aspx?pr.x=19&amp;pr.y=9&amp;sy=2005&amp;ey=2009&amp;scsm=1&amp;ssd=1&amp;sort=country&amp;ds=.&amp;br=1&amp;c=228&amp;s=NGDP_R%2CNGDPRPC%2CPCPI%2CLUR&amp;grp=0&amp;a=|title=Report for Selected Countries and Subjects|work=World Economic Outlook Database, April 2012

====Political issues====

Bachelet began her term with an unprecedented [[absolute majority]] in both chambers of Congress—before appointed senators were eliminated in the 2005 constitutional reforms the CPD never had a majority in the Senate—but she was soon faced with internal opposition coming from a number of dissatisfied lawmakers from both chambers of Congress, the so-called ''díscolos'' (&quot;disobedient,&quot; &quot;ungovernable&quot;), which jeopardized the coalition's narrow—and historic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibliojuridica.org/libros/6/2527/10.pdf|title=REFORMA ELECTORAL EN CHILE|author=Carlos Huneeus|page=374}}&lt;/ref&gt;—Congress majority on a number of key executive-sponsored bills during much of her first half in office, and forced her to negotiate with a right-wing opposition she saw as being obstructionist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of 2007 the CPD lost its absolute majority in both chambers of Congress, as several senators and deputies from that coalition became independent.

In December 2006 former dictator Augusto Pinochet died. Bachelet decided not to grant him a [[state funeral]], an honour bestowed upon constitutionally elected Chilean presidents, but a [[military funeral]] as former [[commander-in-chief]] of the Army appointed by President Salvador Allende. She also refused to declare an official [[national day of mourning]], but did authorize flags at military barracks to fly at [[half staff]]. Pinochet's coffin was also allowed to be draped in a Chilean flag. Bachelet did not attend his funeral saying it would be &quot;a violation of [her] conscience&quot; and sent Defense Minister, [[Vivianne Blanlot]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Clashes Break out after Pinochet's death&quot;, Yahoo!

[[Image:Michelle Bachelet Néstor Kirchner7.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Bachelet with former Argentine president [[Néstor Kirchner]].]]

====Argentina====
During her first year in office Bachelet faced continuing problems from neighbors [[Argentina]] and [[Peru]]. In July 2006 she sent a [[letter of protest]] to [[President of Argentina|Argentine president]] [[Néstor Kirchner]] after his government issued a decree increasing export tariffs of [[natural gas]] to Chile, which was considered by Bachelet to be a violation of a tacit bilateral agreement. A month later a long-standing [[Territorial dispute|border dispute]] resurfaced after Argentina published some tourist maps showing contested territory in the south—the [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]] (''Campo de Hielo Patagónico Sur'')—as Argentine, violating an agreement not to define a border over the area.

====Peru====
In early 2007 Peru accused Chile of unilaterally redefining their shared sea boundary in a law, passed by Congress, which detailed the borders of the new administrative region of [[Arica and Parinacota Region|Arica and Parinacota]]. The impasse was resolved by the Chilean Constitutional Tribunal, which declared the particular section of the law unconstitutional. In March 2007, the Chilean state-owned—but editorially independent—television channel [[Televisión Nacional de Chile|TVN]] cancelled the broadcast of a documentary about the [[War of the Pacific]] after a cautionary call was made to the stations' board of directors by Chilean Foreign Relations Minister [[Alejandro Foxley]], apparently acting on demands made by the Peruvian ambassador to Chile;{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} the show was finally broadcast in late May of that year. In August 2007 the Chilean government filed a formal diplomatic protest to Peru and summoned home its ambassador, after Peru published an official map claiming a part of the [[Pacific Ocean]] that Chile considers its sovereign territory. Peru said this was just another step in its plans to bring the dispute to the [[International Court of Justice]] in [[The Hague]]. In January 2008 Peru asked the court to consider the dispute, prompting Bachelet to summon home the Chilean ambassador in [[Lima]] for consultations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7194854.stm |title=Americas &amp;#124; Chile-Peru spat over sea border |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-01-17 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====UN voting deadlock====
Chile's [[2006 United Nations Security Council election|October 16, 2006 vote in the United Nations Security Council election]]—with [[Venezuela]] and [[Guatemala]] deadlocked in a bid for the two-year, non-permanent Latin American and Caribbean seat on the [[United Nations Security Council|Security Council]]—developed into a major ideological issue in the country and was seen as a test for Bachelet. The governing coalition was divided between the Socialists, who supported a vote for Venezuela, and the Christian Democrats, who strongly opposed it. The day before the vote the president announced (through her spokesman) that Chile would abstain, citing as reason a lack of regional consensus over a single candidate, ending months of speculation. In March 2007 Chile's ambassador to Venezuela, [[Claudio Huepe]], revealed in an interview with [[teleSUR]] that Bachelet personally told him that she initially wanted to vote for Venezuela, but then &quot;there were a series of circumstances that forced me to abstain.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government quickly recalled Huepe and accepted his resignation.

[[Image:Unasul 29.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Bachelet with [[Evo Morales]] and [[Lula da Silva]] at a [[Union of South American Nations]] summit in 2008.]]

====Unasur====
In May 2008 Bachelet became the first [[President pro tempore of the Union of South American Nations]] (Unasur) and in September she called for an urgent summit, after Bolivian President [[Evo Morales]] warned of a possible [[2008 unrest in Bolivia|coup attempt]] against him. The presidents of Bolivia, Ecuador, Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay, Brasil and Colombia, and the Secretary-General of the [[Organization of American States]], met with Bachelet at the [[La Moneda Palace]] in Santiago, where they agreed to send two commissions to Bolivia: one to mediate between the executive and the opposition, and another to investigate the killings in [[Pando Department]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=La Jornada |url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/09/17/index.php?section=mundo&amp;article=037n1mun |title=La cumbre de Unasur &quot;abortó&quot; un golpe contra Evo Morales, afirma Hugo Chávez - La Jornada |publisher=Jornada.unam.mx |date=2008-09-17 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cuba visit====
In February 2009 Bachelet visited [[Cuba]] and met with [[Fidel Castro]]. There she urged the United States to put an end to the [[Cuban embargo|embargo]]. No Chilean head of state had visited the country in 37 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.argentinaindependent.com/currentaffairs/newsroundups/roundupslatinamerica/bachelet-condemns-us-embargo-on-cuba-/ |title=Bachelet condemns US embargo on Cuba &amp;#124; The Argentina Independent |publisher=Argentinaindependent.com |date=2009-02-12 |accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting with Castro backfired after the Cuban leader wrote, a day later, that the &quot;fascist and vengeful Chilean oligarchy is the same which more than 100 years ago robbed Bolivia of its access to the Pacific and of copper-rich lands in a humiliating war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Redacción BBC Mundo |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_7888000/7888118.stm |title=BBC Mundo &amp;#124; América Latina &amp;#124; Bachelet se reunió con Fidel Castro |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-02-13 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=14:04 |url=http://peru21.pe/noticia/246566/fidel-castro-critico-oligarquia-chilena |title=Fidel Castro criticĂł a la â€œoligarquĂ­a chilenaâ€?&amp;#124; PerĂş21 |publisher=Peru21.pe |date= |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.larepublica.pe/impresa/fidel-castro-afirma-que-oligarquia-chilena-le-arrebato-mar-bolivia-en-guerra-de-1879-2009-02-14 |title=Fidel Castro afirma que oligarquia chilena le arrebato mar a Bolivia en guerra de 1879 |publisher=Larepublica.pe |date= |accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Progressive Leaders summit====
In March 2009, Bachelet hosted in [[Viña del Mar]], the &quot;Progressive Leaders Summit&quot;, meeting with U.S. Vice President [[Joe Biden]], British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]], Spanish Prime Minister [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]] and Presidents [[Tabaré Vázquez]] of Uruguay, [[Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva]] of Brazil and [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] of Argentina. The reunion garnered some media interest because it took place six days before the highly-anticipated [[2009 G-20 London Summit|G-20 Summit]] in [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2009/03/28/351089/cumbre-de-lideres-progresistas-finaliza-hoy-en-vina-del-mar.html |title=Cumbre de líderes progresistas finaliza hoy en Viña del Mar |publisher=Emol.com |date=2009-03-28 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Conway |first=Edmund |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/g20-summit/4963944/G20-ministers-set-for-clash-over-economic-crisis-solutions.html |title=G20 ministers set for clash over economic crisis solutions |publisher=Telegraph |date=2009-03-09 |accessdate=2011-09-13 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Trade====
Continuing the coalition's free-trade strategy, in August 2006 Bachelet promulgated a [[free trade agreement]] with the [[People's Republic of China]] (signed under the previous administration of Ricardo Lagos), the first Chinese free-trade agreement with a Latin American nation; similar deals with Japan and India were promulgated in August 2007. In October 2006, Bachelet promulgated a multilateral trade deal with [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]] and [[Brunei]], the [[Trans-Pacific Strategic Economic Partnership]] (P4), also signed under Lagos' presidency. She also held free-trade talks with other countries, including [[Australia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Turkey]] and [[Malaysia]]. Regionally, she signed bilateral free trade agreements with [[Panama]], [[Peru]] and [[Colombia]].

====Other policy====
In October 2007 Bachelet granted an amnesty to [[illegal immigration|undocumented migrants]] from other Latin American countries. The measure was expected to benefit around 15,000 Peruvians and 2,000 Bolivians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/spanish/latin_america/newsid_7057000/7057528.stm |title=BBC Mundo &amp;#124; América Latina &amp;#124; Chile anuncia amnistía a inmigrantes |publisher=BBC News |date=2007-10-23 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007 Bachelet signed in [[Bolivia]] a trilateral agreement with the presidents of [[Brazil]] and Bolivia to complete and improve a 4,700&amp;nbsp;km road to connect the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, via [[Arica]] and [[Iquique]] in Chile and [[Santos, Brazil|Santos]] in Brazil. In May 2008, following months of intense lobbying, Chile was elected as member of the [[United Nations Human Rights Council]], obtaining the largest vote among Latin American countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mer.cl/modulos/generacion/mobileASP/detailNew.asp?strNamePage=MERSTNA001CC2205.jpg&amp;codCuerpo=715&amp;strFecha=2008-05-22&amp;resolucion=&amp;tipoPantalla=&amp;iPage=1&amp;iNumPag=01&amp;iFirstPage=0&amp;codRev=&amp;source=thumb Chile obtiene cupo en Consejo de Derechos Humanos de la ONU], [[El Mercurio]], May 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009 Chile became the first country in [[South America]] and second in Latin America after [[Mexico]] to receive an invitation to join the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/document/2/0,3343,en_2649_201185_44267356_1_1_1_1,00.html |title=Chile invited to become a member of the OECD |publisher=Oecd.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bachelet signed the accession agreement in January 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/business/2010/01/100112_chile_oecd_biz.shtml |title=BBC World Service - Business - Chile joins the OECD's economic club |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2010-01-12 |accessdate=2011-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it formally became a member in May 2010, after she had left office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Bachelet enjoyed an approval rating above 50% for her first three months in office, during the so-called &quot;honeymoon period.&quot; Her popularity fell during the students protests that year, hovering in the mid 40s. In July she had a disastrous public relations incident when a group of residents she was visiting in the southern city of [[Chiguayante]] who were affected by a landslide berated her publicly on television, accusing her of using their tragedy to boost her falling popularity. One woman demanded that she leave the scene so rescue efforts could continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2006/07/12/224973/damnificados-de-chiguayante-acusan-a-bachelet-de-abusar-de-la-tragedia.html |title=Damnificados de Chiguayante acusan a Bachelet de abusar de la tragedia |publisher=Emol.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/p4_noticias/site/artic/20060712/pags/20060712142230.html |title=Bachelet debió enfrentar la rabia de afectados por temporal en Chiguayante |publisher=Cooperativa.cl |date=2006-07-12 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July, after only four months in office, Bachelet was forced to reshuffle her cabinet, in what was the fastest ministerial adjustment since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ignacio Nieto |url=http://www.emol.com/especiales/michelle_bachelet_2007/conflictos.html |title=Especiales Emol - Michelle Bachelet, a un año de su llegada a la Moneda |publisher=Emol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bachelet's popularity dipped further in her second year, reaching a low of 35% approval, 46% disapproval in September 2007. This fall was mainly attributed to the Transantiago fiasco.&lt;ref name=&quot;ft&quot;/&gt; That same month she had a second negative incident when a group of earthquake and [[tsunami]] victims she was visiting in the southern region of [[Aisén Region|Aisén]] received her bearing black flags, and accused her of showing up late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/detalle/detallenoticias.asp?idnoticia=253435 |title=Con banderas negras protestan en Puerto Aisén por llegada de Bachelet |publisher=Emol.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/p4_noticias/site/artic/20070423/pags/20070423081108.html |title=Alcalde de Puerto Aysén: La Presidenta &quot;se puede ir a la punta del cerro&quot; |publisher=Cooperativa.cl |date=2007-04-23 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city mayor, who told Bachelet to &quot;go to hell&quot;, later apologized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/alcalde-insistio-que-bachelet-le-falto-el-respeto-a-la-gente-de-aysen/prontus_nots/2007-04-24/190710.html |title=Alcalde insistió que Bachelet &quot;le faltó el respeto&quot; a la gente de Aysén |publisher=Cooperativa.cl |date=2007-04-24 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooperativa.cl/alcalde-de-aysen-ofrecio-disculpas-publicas-a-bachelet/prontus_nots/2007-06-18/132756.html |title=Alcalde de Aysén ofreció disculpas públicas a Bachelet |publisher=Cooperativa.cl |date=2007-06-18 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the next 12 months her approval ratings did not improve.

At the onset of the crisis in [[Global financial crisis in September 2008|September 2008]] Bachelet's popularity was at a low 42%, but gradually her job approval ratings began to rise. When she left office in March 2010 her popular support was at a record 84%, according to conservative polling institute Adimark GfK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Washington |first=The |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/mar/12/more-quakes-hit-chile-as-new-president-takes-offic/ |title=More quakes hit Chile as new president takes office |publisher=Washington Times |date=2010-03-12 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitution of Chile|Chilean Constitution]] does not allow a president to serve two consecutive terms&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;/&gt; and Bachelet endorsed CPD candidate [[Eduardo Frei Ruiz-Tagle]] for the December 2009 election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.cl/noticias/site/artic/20090706/pags/20090706092539.html |title=nacion.cl - Bachelet: &quot;Inequí­vocamente apoyo a Frei como candidato&quot; |publisher=Lanacion.cl |date=2009-07-06 |accessdate=2011-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-presidential career==

In April 2010, Bachelet inaugurated her own [[think-tank]], &quot;Fundación Dialoga&quot;. Its headquarters are located in [[Providencia, Chile|Providencia]], a suburb of Santiago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BioBioChile |url=http://www.biobiochile.cl/2010/04/16/bachelet-inaugura-fundacion-dialoga-en-contrapeso-a-la-concentracion-de-poderes-existente-en-chile.shtml |title=biobiochile - Bachelet inaugura Fundación Dialoga en contrapeso a la concentración de poderes existente en Chile |publisher=Biobiochile.cl |date=2011-08-16 |accessdate=2011-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 September 2010, Bachelet was appointed as head of the newly created body [[UN Women]] by [[UN Secretary-General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]]. She took office on 19 September 2010.

Bachelet is a member of the [[Club of Madrid]], the world’s largest forum of former heads of state and government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clubmadrid.org/en/miembro/michelle_bachelet |title=Michelle Bachelet &amp;#124; Club de Madrid |publisher=Clubmadrid.org |date= |accessdate=2011-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bachelet has not ruled out a return to the presidency at the next elections in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AlJazeeraEnglish |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VW9kEcgXW20 |title=Frost over the World - Michelle Bachelet - 25 Sep 09 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2011-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The well-respected CEP poll, released in May 2012, suggested 51% of voters want her to become the next president, head and shoulders above any other would-be candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emol.com/noticias/nacional/2012/05/10/539836/encuesta-cep.html|publisher=EMOL|accessdate=2012-05-14|date=2012-05-10|title=Encuesta CEP: Bachelet lidera por lejos la carrera presidencial con 51% de las preferencias|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;
