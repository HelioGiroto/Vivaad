'''{{Audio|De-Erika Steinbach.ogg|Erika Steinbach}}''' (born 25 July 1943) is a [[Germany|German]] conservative [[politician]] and president of the [[Federation of Expellees]]. She has been representing the [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]] (CDU) and the [[Hesse|state of Hesse]] as a member of the [[Parliament]] of Germany, the [[Bundestag]], since 1990. She is one of two MPs representing the constituency of [[Frankfurt]], and she is  the spokeswoman of the [[CDU/CSU]] parliamentary group on [[human rights]] and [[humanitarian aid]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cducsu.de/Titel__arbeitsgruppen/TabID__13/SubTabID__15//InhaltTypID__1/Arbeitsgruppen.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

Erika Steinbach studied music and was a member of concert orchestras before becoming a politician.

==Early life==
Steinbach's father, Wilhelm Karl Hermann, was born in [[Hanau]] ([[Hesse]], western-central [[German Empire|Germany]]) but his family had come from [[Province of Lower Silesia|Lower Silesia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;welt2&quot;&gt;{{de icon}}{{cite web | title= Erika Steinbach bestreitet Sinneswandel | work= Die Welt| url= http://www2.welt.de/data/2005/11/03/798145.html?s=2 | accessdate=2005-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1941 he was stationed within [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany|Nazi occupied Poland]] in the town of [[Rumia]] ({{lang-de|Rahmel}}),.&lt;ref name=rbb&gt;[[Rundfunk Berlin Brandenburg]] online [http://www.deutsche-und-polen.de/_/personen/person_jsp/key=erika_steinbach.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Wilhelm Karl Hermann served there as an airfield technician with the rank of a [[Luftwaffe]] ''[[Feldwebel]]''. Steinbach's mother, Erika Hermann (née Grote), was ordered to work in the town after the annexation.&lt;ref name=rbb/&gt; Steinbach was born there as '''Erika Hermann'''.

In January 1944, her father was deployed to the [[Eastern Front (WWII)|Eastern Front]]. In January 1945 during [[East Prussian Offensive]] of the [[Soviet Army]], Steinbach's mother together with her children, fled to [[Schleswig-Holstein]] in northwestern Germany.&lt;ref name=rbb/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IPN&quot;&gt;{{pl icon}} {{cite journal | first = Piotr | last = Szubarczyk | authorlink =Piotr Szubarczyk | coauthors =Piotr Semków | year = 2004 | month = May | title = Erika z Rumi | journal = Biuletyn [[Institute of National Remembrance|IPN]] | volume = 50 | issue = 4 | pages = 49–53 | id =|url = http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/getdocument.aspx?logid=5&amp;id=28907138-3A87-4B20-B95E-8E8B41BA9C5D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ntv&gt;[[n-tv]] [http://www.n-tv.de/1113954.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948 the family moved to [[Berlin]], where Steinbach's grandfather had become mayor of one of the districts.

In 1949, Wilhelm Karl Hermann returned from Soviet captivity. In 1950, the family moved to Hanau, Hesse where Steinbach finished her education and started studying the violin.&lt;ref name=rbb/&gt;&lt;ref name=ntv/&gt; In 1967 she abandoned her music career due to an ill finger.&lt;ref name=rbb/&gt;&lt;ref name=ntv/&gt; In 1972, she married Helmut Steinbach, the conductor of a local youth symphonic orchestra. Steinbach graduated from a school of civil administration and moved to [[Frankfurt am Main|Frankfurt]], where she started working for a Communal Evaluation Office.&lt;ref name=rbb/&gt;&lt;ref name=ntv/&gt;

==Political career==
===Career in the CDU, Member of Parliament===
In 1974 she joined the Frankfurt branch of the CDU.&lt;ref name=rbb/&gt; In 1977 she was elected a member of the [[Frankfurt City Council]] and held that post until 1990.

She was elected a member of the [[Bundestag]] in 1990, one of two representatives of the constituency of [[Frankfurt]]&lt;ref name=ntv/&gt; In 1990 she voted against the [[German–Polish Border Treaty (1990)]].&lt;ref name=rbb/&gt; In 1997 she criticized the approval of the Czech-German Declaration of Reconciliation.&lt;ref name=rbb/&gt;

Since 2005, she has been a member of the German parliamentary committee for human rights and humanitarian aid and spokesperson for [[human rights]] and humanitarian aid of the CDU/[[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] fraction. She is also a deputy member of the parliamentary Committee for the Interior. Since 2000, she has been a member of the [[national board of the CDU]] (German, ''CDU-Bundesvorstand'').

In 2009, she was offered the position of Secretary of State in the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Federal Ministry of Education and Research]], but declined.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jungefreiheit.de/Single-News-Display.154+M5d2f0100871.0.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Federation of Expellees ===
&lt;!-- Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Merkel-steinbach.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] is greeted by Erika Steinbach at the annual reception of the Bund der Vertriebenen in Berlin in February 2006]] --&gt;

Steinbach joined the German Federation of Expellees in 1994. In May 1998 she was elected President of the organization, and was re-elected in 2000, 2002,&lt;ref name=rbb/&gt; 2004,&lt;ref name=&quot;BdV&quot;&gt;{{de icon}}{{cite web | author = | year = 2004 | url = http://www2.bund-der-vertriebenen.de/presse/index.php3?id=94 | title = BdV-Präsidentin Erika Steinbach mit überwältigender Mehrheit wiedergewählt | format = | work = Bund der Vertriebenen website | publisher = BdV | accessdate = May 8, 2004 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20040518021354/http://www.bund-der-vertriebenen.de/presse/index.php3?id=94 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = May 18, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2006, 2008 and 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;2010bestaetigt&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Federation of Expellees claims to have 1.3 million members.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bund-der-vertriebenen.de/derbdv/struktur-1.php3&lt;/ref&gt; This figure was disputed in January 2010 by the German news service DDP, which reported an actual membership of 550,000.&lt;ref&gt;Reported by ARD News service in January 2010 (The figure of 550,000 does not include the State of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]]). The news report mentioned that an expert in the area of expellees, Prof. Matthias Stickler of Würzburg University as saying that a decline in Federation of Expellees membership is understandable because it “mirrors the death of the generation of that era&quot;[http://www.tagesschau.de/inland/bdvmitglieder100.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The German [[Federal Expellee Law]] of 1953 defines as expellee all [[German citizenship|German nationals]] and [[ethnic Germans]] with a primary residence outside [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|post-war Germany]], who lost this residence in the course of the [[Expulsion of Germans after World War II|World War II-related flight and expulsions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Law&quot;&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite web|author = [[Bundestag]] | year = 1953 | url = http://bundesrecht.juris.de/bvfg/index.html | title = Gesetz über die Angelegenheiten der Vertriebenen und Flüchtlinge | work = Juris.de | publisher = German Ministry of Justice | accessdate = February 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinbach has distanced herself from the [[Prussian Trust]], that aggressively seeks restitution of German properties in Poland.&lt;ref name=&quot;3sat.de&quot;&gt;http://www.3sat.de/dynamic/sitegen/bin/sitegen.php?tab=2&amp;source=/ard/buehler/97984/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinbach represents the Federation of Expellees on the board of the national broadcasting company [[ZDF]].[http://www.unternehmen.zdf.de/index.php?id=306]

=== Centre Against Expulsions ===
Erika Steinbach is the founder, along with [[Peter Glotz]], of the foundation [[Centre Against Expulsions]] ({{lang-de|Zentrum gegen Vertreibungen}}), which is working to establish a museum for the victims of &quot;Flight, displacements, forced resettlements and deportations all over the world in the past century&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.z-g-v.de/english/aktuelles/?id=52 Centre against Expulsions]&lt;/ref&gt; a project of the German federal government on initiative and with participation of the [[Federation of Expellees]]. The museum will contain a permanent exhibition to document expulsions including the [[expulsion of Germans after World War II]].

The federal government established the federal foundation &quot;Flucht, Vertreibung, Versöhnung&quot; which is intended to be the basis of a future museum. The Federation of Expellees is entitled to appoint some of the board member, although they need to be confirmed by the cabinet.

On 4 March 2009 the Federation of Expellees decided not to nominate Steinbach to the council and instead left one seat unoccupied, after the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD) threatened to veto Steinbach's appointment to the board.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,611206,00.html Spiegel.de, Vertriebenenbund zieht Steinbachs Nominierung zurück]&lt;/ref&gt; On October 19, 2009, after the SPD was ousted from government and replaced by a liberal-conservative coalition dominated by Steinbach's party, Steinbach announced her intention to take the seat at the board.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rp.pl/artykul/379628_Kolejny_ruch__Eriki_Steinbach__.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, objections against her were subsequently also raised by the new foreign minister [[Guido Westerwelle]] of the liberal [[Free Demokratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;''Der Spiegel'': &quot;Merkel wird den Fall Steinbach nicht los&quot;. 17 November 2009. [http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,661738,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Steinbach is supported by her own party and the CSU, both of which have called upon Westerwelle to give up his resistance, and have cited earlier statements by Westerwelle where he had praised Steinbach a few years ago.&lt;ref&gt;http://nachrichten.rp-online.de/article/politik/CDU-Generalsekretaer-Steinbach-hat-das-volle-Vertrauen-der-Partei/59085&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bild.de/BILD/politik/2009/11/21/vertriebenen-chefin-erika-steinbach/aussenminister-guido-westerwelle-soll-sich-mit-ihr-versoehnen.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 she was involved in an exhibition on the expulsions in Europe in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2135984,00.html http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,2144,2129971,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition deals with expulsions of German, Armenians, Poles, Turks, Greeks, Latvians, Karelians, Ukrainians, Italians and other peoples - topics many Europeans are unfamiliar with. The last item of the exhibition was a reconciliatory suitcase from Poland dedicated to a peaceful Polish, German and Ukrainian future generation {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}.

===International human rights activism===

As the CDU/CSU spokeswoman for human rights, Erika Steinbach is involved in a number of activities promoting human rights worldwide.

She was an expert speaker at the International Cuba Conference of the [[International Society for Human Rights]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ishr.org/index.php?id=836&lt;/ref&gt;

===Franz Werfel Human Rights Award===
Together with [[Peter Glotz]], she was the primary initiator of the [[Franz Werfel Human Rights Award]], and serves as a jury member together with [[Otto von Habsburg]], [[Klaus Hänsch]] and [[Otto Graf Lambsdorff]] among others. It has been awarded every second year since 2003 in the Frankfurt [[Paulskirche, Frankfurt|Paulskirche]]. The 2009 recipient was [[Herta Müller]].

===Interest in language===
Steinbach was member of the [[Goethe-Institut]] from 1994 to 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Munzinger Online, s.v. Erika Steinbach, accessed 2010-09-12&lt;/ref&gt; She is also member of the [[Verein Deutsche Sprache]].[http://www.vds-ev.de/bekanntemitglieder]

==Political positions==

Erika Steinbach is considered conservative within the CDU in most fields of policy, belonging to the initiators of the [[Berliner Kreis]]. Her work as a member of parliament focuses on human rights, and she is a strong critic of human rights violations in communist countries around the world. She is also a strong supporter of the process of European integration.

Steinbach endorses the ''[[Charta of the German expellees]]'' of August 1950.&lt;ref name=HA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abendblatt.de/politik/deutschland/article157312/Erika-Steinbach-ist-keine-Revanchistin.html|title=Erika Steinbach ist keine Revanchistin|first=Ralph|last=Giordano|publisher=Hamburger Abendblatt 2009-02-27|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social policy===
Erika Steinbach holds conservative views on social policy and opposes [[abortion]] and [[same-sex marriage]], which sometimes has caused controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;3sat.de&quot;/&gt;

==Perception==
Erika Steinbach is much more widely known in [[Poland]] and the [[Czech Republic]] than in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=CordellWolff149&gt;{{cite book|title=Routledge advances in European politics. Volume 28. Germany's foreign policy towards Poland and the Czech Republic: Ostpolitik revisited|first1=Karl|last1=Cordell|first2=Stefan|last2=Wolff|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=0-415-36974-6|page=149|url=http://books.google.com/?id=WCjxIMz0o8QC&amp;pg=PA149|accessdate=2009-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cordell and Wolff (2005), the political importance the [[Federation of Expellees]] has in German politics is overestimated in Poland and the Czech Republic because of its unproportional media presence in these countries and campaigns of &quot;aggressively nationalist politicians&quot;.&lt;ref name=CordellWolff149/&gt;

===Criticism===
Steinbach's public pronouncements have been criticized for causing a deterioration in [[German-Polish relations]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,444037,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Steinbach has a negative reputation in Poland, where she and the [[Centre against Expulsions]] are sometimes associated with Nazism. One example of this was a 2003 cover montage of Polish newsmagazine ''[[Wprost]]'' that depicted her riding Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] while wearing an [[SS uniform]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spiegel.de/img/0,1020,721659,00.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 ''[[Gazeta Wyborcza]]'', a popular newspaper in Poland, reproduced a leaflet&lt;ref&gt;[http://bi.gazeta.pl/im/1/4383/z4383661X.jpg polish leaflet of 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; presenting Steinbach in the succession of the [[Teutonic Knights]] and the Nazis, and reminded of the full compensations never paid &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ceeol.com/aspx/issuedetails.aspx?issueid=ea5cd0b7-e759-445d-a85e-268a8f4415bc&amp;articleId=80eb3e50-fa12-4da7-b2c7-b8f680bae54c&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://remember.org/educate/dingell.html&lt;/ref&gt; to Poland for losses caused by Nazi Germany.&lt;ref&gt;http://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/Wiadomosci/1,80273,4383674.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Polish ambassador to Germany, Marek Prawda, Poland's Foreign Minister [[Radosław Sikorski]] and Polish Prime Minister [[Donald Tusk]] expressed unease with Steinbach's appointment to the board of the [[Center against Expulsions]] in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,,4057645,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Władysław Bartoszewski]], an [[Auschwitz]] survivor who is Poland’s commissioner on relations with Germany, said that giving Mrs Steinbach a seat on the board would be akin to the Vatican appointing a Holocaust denier like [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]] to manage relations with Israel.&lt;ref name=&quot;thenational.ae&quot;&gt;http://www.thenational.ae/article/20090223/FOREIGN/422245904/1013/NEWS&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 September 2010, Steinbach attested Bartoszewski &quot;a bad character&quot; on German TV.[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,717858,00.html]

The Polish foreign minister, Radosław Sikorski, privately warned Berlin that allowing Mrs Steinbach’s appointment would shake German-Polish relations “to their foundations”.&lt;ref name=&quot;thenational.ae&quot;/&gt;
&quot;Do people whose families lived there for generations want to be identified with a person like Mrs. Steinbach, who came to our country with [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] and had to leave it with Hitler too?&quot; Sikorski said in Brussels on Feb. 23 2009, referring to Steinbach’s father having moved to German occupied Poland during the war&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601100&amp;sid=aVlnY6l646Ag&amp;refer=germany | work=Bloomberg | title=Merkel, Tusk Meeting Overshadowed by Postwar German Expulsion | date=27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and asked her to follow the example of President Horst Köhler, who was born within family of wartime German settlers in Poland and never considered himself an expellee.&lt;ref&gt;http://wyborcza.pl/1,86871,6315910,Erika_Steinbach_Reconciles.html&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that Steinbach represents a person born to a German officer stationed in occupied Poland has been described as one of the essential issues for Poles.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rp.pl/artykul/9133,269112_Semka__Polska___Niemcy__Czas_niezrozumienia_.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Steinbach visited Poland for the third time, where she laid a floral wreath at the commemoral site of the victims of Nazism in [[Piasnica]], and visited a church of Gdynia, where German expellee victims are commemorated.

[[Vaclav Havel]], the former president of the Czech Republic, anti-communist dissident has been said to refuse to speak to Steinbach due to the positions taken by the Federation of Expellees under her leadership.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;

In Germany the Polish criticism is considered to be part of an [[Anti-German sentiment|anti-German]] campaign in which Steinbach became the enemy stereotype&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ksta.de/html/artikel/1233584090458.shtml Feindbild Erika Steinbach] [[Kölner Stadt-Anzeiger]], 1 March 2009 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and demonization of Steinbach a kind of reason of state.&lt;ref name=sued&gt;[http://www.sueddeutsche.de/politik/causa-erika-steinbach-wahn-und-raserei-1.70087 Wahn und Raserei] [[Sueddeutsche Zeitung]], 8 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The way she is portrayed in Polish public is described as having rather &quot;hysteric features&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taz.de/!30939/ Merkels Eiertanz um Erika Steinbach] [[Die Tageszeitung]], 24 February 2009 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a &quot;psychosis&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rp-online.de/politik/deutschland/Die-Steinbach-Psychose-der-Polen_aid_680061.html Die &quot;Steinbach-Psychose&quot; der Polen] [[Rheinische Post]] 3 March 2009 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Especially conservative nationalists in the [[Law and Justice]] are blamed to have used her as a bogey in internal politics to counter [[Donald Tusk]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.derwesten.de/nachrichten/politik/Ein-Popanz-namens-Erika-Steinbach-id810478.html Ein Popanz namens Erika Steinbach] [[WAZ-Mediengruppe|Der Westen]], 25 February 2009 {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; ignoring Steinbach's real views.&lt;ref name=sued/&gt;

===Lecture controversy===
In May 2008 Steinbach started a series of lectures about the &quot;[[History of German settlement in Eastern Europe|German settlement in Eastern Central Europe]]&quot; at the [[University of Potsdam]]. However demonstrations by students who protested against Steinbach's allegedly revisionist views on German history by throwing waterfilled balloons and blocking the entrances compelled her to cancel the further lectures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.welt.de/politik/article2061642/Erika_Steinbach_sagt_Vortraege_nach_Protesten_ab.html#vote_2061963, Die Welt, Steinbach sagt Vortraege ab]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/unispiegel/studium/0,1518,556128,00.html Spiegel, Studium abgesagt]&lt;/ref&gt; On June 11, 2008, a full meeting of the students council decided (with 146 against 7 votes) to protect the right of freedom of opinion and speech and invited Steinbach again, if necessary under police protection. The local Mayor, supported by several political parties, expressed his displeasure about the incident and requested that the university council invite Steinbach again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maerkischeallgemeine.de/cms/beitrag/11224669/60709/Oberbuergermeister_fordert_Universitaet_auf_sich_dem_Konflikt_zu.html Märkische Allgemeine, Oberbürgermeister fordert Universität auf sich dem Konflikt zu stellen]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resignation===
On September 2010, Steinbach resigned from the leadership of the CDU/CSU after controversial statements about the [[German invasion of Poland]]. Steinbach, in support of other members of her expellee organization, claimed that Hitler's attack on Poland was just a response to Poland's mobilization. According to mainstream historians, Poland's mobilization was itself a response to Hitler's armament program and threat of war from Germany. The statements angered Germany's Central Council of Jews.&lt;ref name=ind&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/merkel-ally-quits-after-claiming-nazis-didnt-start-war-2076379.html | work=The Independent | first=Tony | last=Paterson | date=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinbach's resignation  was met with mixed feelings within the CDU/CSU. Some members were worried that her departure could cause a split, and a formation of a new right wing party in Germany. However, others believed that Steinbach's departure strengthened the position of Merkel for whom Steinbach had been an uncomfortable presence, due to her unashamedly revanchist politics,{{or|date=January 2012}} in the past, particularly since opinion polls in Germany indicate little support for the Federation of Expellees.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;
