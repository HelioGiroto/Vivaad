A [[Physical chemistry|physical chemist]] by professional background, Merkel entered politics in the wake of the [[Revolutions of 1989]] and briefly served as the deputy spokesperson for [[Lothar de Maizière]]'s democratically elected [[East Germany|East German]] government prior to the [[German reunification]]. Following reunification in 1990, she was elected to the [[Bundestag]], where she has represented the state of [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]] since. She served as [[Federal Ministry of Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth|Federal Minister for Women and Youth]] 1991–1994 and as [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety|Federal Minister for the Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety]] 1994–1998 in [[Helmut Kohl]]'s [[Cabinet Kohl IV|fourth]] and [[Cabinet Kohl V|fifth cabinet]]s. She was Secretary General of the CDU 1998–2000, and was elected chairperson in 2000. From 2002 to 2005, she was also chair of the [[CDU/CSU]] parliamentary coalition.

After her election as Chancellor following the [[German federal election, 2005|2005 federal election]], she led a [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] consisting of her own CDU party, its Bavarian sister party, the [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] (CSU), and the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SPD), until 2009. In the [[German federal election, 2009|2009 federal election]], the CDU obtained the largest share of the votes, and formed a coalition government with the CSU and the liberal [[Freie Demokratische Partei|Free Democratic Party]] (FDP).&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCnewterm2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8329490.stm|title=Germany's Merkel begins new term|accessdate=2009-11-01|date=2009-10-28|publisher=BBC|archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091031061627/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8329490.stm|archivedate=31 October 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Merkel was [[President of the European Council]] and chaired the [[G8]], the second woman (after [[Margaret Thatcher]]) to do so. She played a central role in the negotiation of the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] and the [[Berlin Declaration (2007)|Berlin Declaration]]. One of her priorities was also to strengthen transatlantic economic relations by signing the agreement for the [[Transatlantic Economic Council]] on 30 April 2007. Merkel is seen as playing a crucial role in managing the [[Late-2000s financial crisis|financial crisis]] at the European and international level, and has been referred to as &quot;the decider.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/2011/12/08/143292255/can-angela-merkel-save-europe |title=Can Angela Merkel Fix Europe's Economic Crisis?|publisher=NPR|accessdate=2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In domestic policy, [[health care reform]] and problems concerning future [[energy development]] have been major issues of her tenure.

Angela Merkel has been described as &quot;the ''[[de facto]]'' leader of the [[European Union]]&quot; and is currently [[Forbes Magazine's List of The World's Most Powerful People|ranked]] as the world's fourth most powerful person by the ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine, the highest ranking ever achieved by a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/germany/8720698/Angela-Merkel-worlds-most-powerful-woman.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Angela Merkel 'world's most powerful woman'|date=24 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/profile/angela-merkel/|title=Profile Angela Merkel|publisher=Forbes|date=2012-04-18|accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Merkel was born '''Angela Dorothea Kasner''' in [[Hamburg]], [[West Germany]], the daughter of [[Horst Kasner]] (1926–2011),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsecho.de/news/ticker/Sa6pk0PGTGs/merkels_vater_gestorben_termine_abgesagt|title=Merkels Vater gestorben - Termine abgesagt|language=German|publisher=newsecho.de|date=2011-09-03|accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; native of Berlin, and his wife Herlind, born in 1928 in [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]] (now [[Gdańsk]], Poland) as Herlind Jentzsch, a teacher of [[English language|English]] and [[Latin]]. Her mother was once a member of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Was an Angela Merkels Mutter vorbildlich ist| language = German | trans_title = | url = http://www.welt.de/politik/article2496274/Was-an-Angela-Merkels-Mutter-vorbildlich-ist.html| work = Welt Online| date = 26 September 2008 | accessdate = 31 July 2010 | quote = 'Nein, in der SPD bin ich nicht mehr.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an interview with ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' in 2000, Merkel stated that she was one quarter [[Poles|Polish]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-18124491.html |title=Mut zu Zwischentönen| language=German |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=2000-12-25 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Preußische Allgemeine Zeitung]], attempting to establish if this referred to her grandparents on her mother's side, Willi Jentzsch and Gertrud Drange, reported that, according to their researches, they were both of German descent and lived in Danzig where Willi Jentzsch was a [[Gymnasium (Germany)|Gymnasium]] teacher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webarchiv-server.de/pin/archiv11/0320110122paz06.htm |title=Politik in den preußischen Genen? / »Bin zu einem Viertel polnisch«: Nicht nur Elbinger Taxifahrer fragen nach Angela Merkels Wurzeln |trans_title=Politics in the Prussian genes? /” Are you a quarter Polish“: It's not only Elbinger cab drivers asking about Angela Merkel's roots (please can a native speaker check translation)|language=German|publisher=Webarchiv-server.de |date=22 January 2011 |accessdate=2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has a brother, Marcus (born 7 July 1957), and a sister, Irene (born 19 August 1964).

Merkel's father studied [[theology]] in [[Heidelberg]] and, afterwards, in Hamburg. In 1954 her father received a pastorate at the church in [[Quitzow]] (near [[Perleberg]] in [[Brandenburg]]), which then was in [[East Germany]], and the family moved to [[Templin]]. Thus Merkel grew up in the countryside {{convert|80|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Berlin]]. [[Gerd Langguth]], a former senior member of Merkel's Christian Democratic Union, states in his book&lt;ref name=&quot;Langguth&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = Langguth  | first = Gerd  | title = Angela Merkel  | origyear = 2005 | publisher = dtv | location = Munich | language = German| isbn =3-423-24485-2  | year = 2005| month = August}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the family's ability to travel freely from East to West Germany during the following years, as well as their possession of two automobiles, leads to the conclusion that Merkel's father had a &quot;sympathetic&quot; relationship with the communist regime, since such freedom and perquisites for a Christian pastor and his family would have been otherwise impossible in East Germany.

Like most pupils, Merkel was a member of the official, [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist]]-led youth movement [[Free German Youth|Free German Youth (FDJ)]]. However, she did not take part in the [[secular]] [[coming of age]] ceremony [[Jugendweihe]], which was common in East Germany, and was [[Confirmation (sacrament)#Lutheran view|confirmed]] instead.  Later, at the Academy of Sciences, she became a member of the FDJ district board and secretary for &quot;[[Agitprop]]&quot; (Agitation and Propaganda).  Merkel herself claimed that she was secretary for culture. When Merkel's onetime FDJ district chairman contradicted her, she insisted that: &quot;According to my memory, I was secretary for culture. But what do I know? I believe I won't know anything when I'm 80.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-67682698.html |title=Die Schläferin |language=[[German language|German]] |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=2009-11-09 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Merkel's progress in the compulsory Marxism-Leninism course was graded only ''genügend'' (sufficient, passing grade) in 1983 and 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,675061,00.html |title=Glänzend in Physik, mäßig in der Ideologie |language=[[German language|German]] |publisher=[[Der Spiegel]] |date=2010-01-31 |quote=&quot;Nach meiner Erinnerung war ich Kultursekretärin. Aber was weiß ich denn? Ich glaube, wenn ich 80 bin, weiß ich gar nichts mehr&quot;, sagt sie.  |accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At school, she learned to speak [[Russian language|Russian]] fluently, and was awarded prizes for her proficiency in Russian and Mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Langguth | first = Gerd | authorlink = Gerd Langguth | title = Angela Merkel | year = 2005 | month = August | publisher = DTV | language = German | isbn = 3-423-24485-2 | page = 50 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkel was educated in Templin and at the [[University of Leipzig]], where she studied [[physics]] from 1973 to 1978. While a student, she participated in the reconstruction of the ruin of the [[Moritzbastei]], a project students initiated to create their own club and recreation facility on campus. Such an initiative was unprecedented in the [[East Germany|GDR]] of that period, and initially resisted by the [[University of Leipzig]]. However, with backing of the local leadership of the [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|SED]] party, the project was allowed to proceed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/static/authoralbumbackground/3852/drogenwahn_auf_der_baustelle.html |title=Drogenwahn auf der Dauerbaustelle|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online |date=2009-03-27 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkel worked and studied at the Central Institute for [[Physical chemistry|Physical Chemistry]] of the [[German Academy of Sciences Berlin|Academy of Sciences]] in [[Adlershof|Berlin-Adlershof]] from 1978 to 1990.  After being awarded a [[doctorate]] (''[[Dr. rer. nat.]]'') for her thesis on [[quantum chemistry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Merkel | first = Angela

In 1989, Merkel got involved in the growing [[democracy]] movement after the [[fall of the Berlin Wall]], joining the new party [[Demokratischer Aufbruch|Democratic Awakening]]. Following the [[East German general election, 1990|first (and only) democratic election]] of the East German state, she became the deputy spokesperson of the new pre-[[German reunification|unification]] caretaker government under [[Lothar de Maizière]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Langguth112&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | last = Langguth  | first = Gerd  | title = Angela Merkel  | origyear = 2005 | publisher = dtv | location = Munich | language = German| isbn =3-423-24485-2 | pages = 112–137  | year = 2005| month = August}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Member of Bundestag and cabinet minister==
At the [[German federal election, 1990|first post-reunification general election]] in December 1990, she was elected to the Bundestag from the [[constituency]] [[Stralsund – Nordvorpommern – Rügen (electoral district)|Stralsund – Nordvorpommern – Rügen]], which is coextensive with the [[Districts of Germany|district]] of [[Vorpommern-Rügen]]. This has remained her electoral district until today. Her party merged with the west German CDU&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2010-10/kohl-in-berlin|title=Des Altkanzlers mahnende Worte|language=German|publisher=Zeit Online|date=2010-10-01|accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she became Minister for Women and Youth in [[Helmut Kohl]]'s 3rd cabinet. In 1994, she was made [[Federal Ministry for Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety|Minister for the Environment and Nuclear Safety]], which gave her greater political visibility and a platform on which to build her political career. As one of Kohl's protégées and his youngest cabinet minister, she was referred to by Kohl as &quot;''mein Mädchen''&quot; (&quot;my girl&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,357997,00.html|title=Kohls unterschätztes Mädchen|language=German|publisher=Spiegel Online|date=2005-05-30|accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leader of the opposition==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-1990-0803-017, Lothar de Maiziere und Angela Merkel.jpg|thumb|left|Merkel as deputy government spokesperson together with [[Lothar de Maizière]], August 1990]]
When the Kohl government was [[German federal election, 1998|defeated in the 1998 general election]], Merkel was named Secretary-General of the CDU. In this position, Merkel oversaw a string of Christian Democrat election victories in six out of seven state elections in 1999 alone, breaking the SPD-Green coalition's hold on the [[Bundesrat of Germany|Bundesrat]], the legislative body representing the [[States of Germany|states]]. Following [[1999 CDU contributions scandal|a party financing scandal]], which compromised many leading figures of the CDU (most notably Kohl himself, who refused to reveal the donor of DM 2,000,000 claiming he had given his word of honour and the then party chairman [[Wolfgang Schäuble]], Kohl's hand-picked successor, who wasn't cooperative either), Merkel criticized her former mentor, Kohl, and advocated a fresh start for the party without him. She was elected to replace Schäuble, becoming the first female chair of her party, on 10 April 2000. Her election surprised many observers, as her personality offered a contrast to the party she had been chosen to lead; Merkel is a [[Protestant]], originating from predominantly Protestant northern Germany, while the CDU is a male-dominated, [[social conservative|socially conservative]] party with strongholds in western and southern Germany, and the Bavarian sister party, the CSU, has deep [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] roots.

Following Merkel's election as CDU leader, she enjoyed considerable popularity among the German population and was favoured by many Germans to become Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s challenger in the [[German federal election, 2002|2002 election]]. However, she did not receive enough support in her own party and particularly its sister party (the [[Bavaria]]n [[Christian Social Union in Bavaria|Christian Social Union]], or CSU), and was subsequently outmanoeuvred politically by CSU leader [[Edmund Stoiber]], to whom she eventually ceded the privilege of challenging Schröder; however, he squandered a large lead in the opinion polls to lose the election by a razor-thin margin. After Stoiber's defeat in 2002, in addition to her role as CDU chairwoman, Merkel became leader of the conservative opposition in the lower house of the German parliament, the [[Bundestag]]. Her rival, [[Friedrich Merz]], who had held the post of parliamentary leader prior to the 2002 election, was eased out to make way for Merkel.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Merkel supported a substantial [[reform movement|reform]] agenda concerning [[Germany]]'s economic and social system and was considered to be more pro-[[market]] than her own party (the CDU); she advocated changes to German labour law, specifically removing barriers to laying off employees and increasing the allowed number of work hours in a week, arguing that existing laws made the country less competitive because companies cannot easily control labour costs at times when business is slow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/0,1518,249207,00.html |title=Merkel fordert längere Arbeitszeit|language=German|publisher=[[Der Spiegel]]|date=2003-05-18|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merkel argued for Germany's [[nuclear power]] to be phased out less quickly than the Schröder administration had planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP_Merkel_Nuclear_phase_out_is_wrong_1006081.html |title=Merkel: Nuclear phase-out is wrong|publisher=World Nuclear News|date=2008-06-10|accessdate=2011-08-27| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110714055807/http://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NP_Merkel_Nuclear_phase_out_is_wrong_1006081.html| archivedate= 14 July 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merkel advocated a strong transatlantic partnership and German-American friendship. In the spring of 2003, defying strong public opposition, Merkel came out in favour of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. invasion of Iraq]], describing it as &quot;unavoidable&quot; and accusing Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] of [[anti-Americanism]].  She criticised the government's support for the [[accession of Turkey to the European Union]] and favoured a &quot;[[privileged partnership]]&quot; instead. In doing so, she reflected public opinion that grew more hostile toward Turkish membership of the European Union.&lt;ref&gt;Marlies Casier and Joost Jongerden, eds. ''Nationalisms and Politics in Turkey'' (2010) p 110&lt;/ref&gt;

===Path to election===
On 30 May 2005, Merkel won the CDU/CSU nomination as challenger to Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] of the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] in the [[German federal election, 2005|2005 national elections]]. Her party began the campaign with a 21 point lead over the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] in national [[opinion poll]]s, although her personal popularity lagged behind that of the [[incumbent]]. However, the CDU/CSU campaign suffered{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} when Merkel, having made economic competence central to the CDU's platform, confused [[gross income|gross]] and [[net income]] twice during a televised debate. She regained some momentum after she announced that she would appoint [[Paul Kirchhof]], a former judge at the German Constitutional Court and leading fiscal policy expert, as Minister of Finance.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Merkel and the CDU lost ground after Kirchhof proposed the introduction of a [[flat tax]] in Germany, again undermining the party's broad appeal on economic affairs and convincing many voters that the CDU's platform of deregulation was designed to benefit only the rich. This was compounded by Merkel proposing to increase [[VAT]] to reduce Germany's deficit and fill the gap in revenue from a flat tax. The SPD were able to increase their support simply by pledging not to introduce flat taxes or increase VAT. Although Merkel's standing recovered after she distanced herself from Kirchhof's proposals, she remained considerably less popular than Schröder, and the CDU's lead was down to 9% on the eve of the election.

On 18 September 2005, Merkel's CDU/CSU and Schröder's SPD went head-to-head in the national elections, with the CDU/CSU winning 35.3% (CDU 27.8%/CSU 7.5%) of the second votes to the SPD's 34.2%. Neither the SPD-Green coalition nor the CDU/CSU and its preferred coalition partners, the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democratic Party]], held enough seats to form a majority in the Bundestag, and both Schröder and Merkel claimed victory. A [[grand coalition]] between the CDU/CSU and SPD faced the challenge that both parties demanded the chancellorship. However, after three weeks of [[negotiation (process)|negotiations]], the two parties reached a deal whereby Merkel would become Chancellor and the SPD would hold 8 of the 16 seats in the cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4325600.stm |title=Merkel named as German chancellor|publisher=BBC News|date=2005-10-10|accessdate=2011-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/10/13/germany.government.ap/ CNN.com] {{Dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition deal was approved by both parties at party conferences on 14 November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4434812.stm |title=German parties back new coalition |date=November 14, 2005 |work=BBC News |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkel was elected Chancellor by the majority of delegates (397 to 217) in the newly assembled Bundestag on 22 November 2005, but 51 members of the governing coalition voted against her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4458430.stm |title=Merkel becomes German chancellor |work=BBC News |date=November 22, 2005 |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reports had indicated that the grand coalition would pursue a mix of policies, some of which differ from Merkel's political platform as leader of the opposition and candidate for Chancellor. The coalition's intent was to cut public spending whilst increasing [[VAT]] (from 16 to 19%), [[social insurance]] contributions and the top rate of [[income tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4429518.stm |title=German coalition poised for power |date=November 11, 2005 |work=BBC News |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Merkel had stated that the main aim of her government would be to reduce unemployment, and that it is this issue on which her government will be judged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4431262.stm |title=Merkel defends German reform plan |work=BBC News |date=November 12, 2005 |publisher=[[BBC News Online]] |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chancellor of Germany==
{{Wikisource|Angela Merkel's 2007 Speech to the European Parliament}}

On 22 November 2005, Merkel assumed the office of Chancellor of Germany following a [[German federal election, 2005|stalemate election]] that resulted in a [[Grand coalition (Germany)|grand coalition]] with the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]].  She was [[German federal election, 2009|re-elected in 2009]] with a larger majority and was able to form a governing coalition with the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|FDP]].

===Foreign policy===
[[File:President and First Lady Obama with Chancellor Merkel.jpg|right|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] and Michelle Obama in 2009 went to visit German Chancellor Angela Merkel and her husband, professor [[Joachim Sauer]], to Rathaus in [[Baden-Baden]], Germany.]]
On 25 September 2007, Merkel met the [[14th Dalai Lama]] for &quot;''private and informal talks''&quot; in Berlin in the [[German Chancellery|Chancellery]] amid protest from [[China]]. China afterwards cancelled separate talks with German officials, including talks with Justice Minister [[Brigitte Zypries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euronews.net/index.php?page=info&amp;article=444371&amp;lng=1 |title=Euronews.net, Merkel meets with the Dalai Lama |publisher=Euronews.net |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of her priorities was to strengthen transatlantic economic relations by signing at the White House the agreement for the Transatlantic Economic Council on 30 April 2007. The Council is co-chaired by an EU and US official, and aims at removing barriers to trade in a further integrated transatlantic free trade area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/international/files/tec_framework_en.pdf |title=Enterprise policies |publisher=European Council |date= |accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project has been described as ultra-liberal by the French left-wing politician [[Jean-Luc Mélenchon]], fearing a transfer of sovereignty from citizens to multinationals and an alignment of the European Union on the American foreign policy and institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/x9203t_jean-luc-melenchon-le-futur-grand-m_news |title=Jean-Luc Mélenchon: &quot;Le futur grand marché transatlantique&quot; |publisher=Dailymotion |date=2009-04-21 |accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xpvina_intervention-de-jean-luc-melenchon-sur-la-defense_news |title=Intervention de Jean-Luc Mélenchon sur la Défense |publisher=Dailymotion |date=2012-04-04 |accessdate=2012-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Der Spiegel'' reported that tensions between Chancellor Merkel and U.S. President Barack Obama&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,632026,00.html |title='They're Not Getting any Warmer': Merkel Faces Difficult Talks in Washington|publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; were eased during a meeting between the two leaders in June 2009.  Commenting on a White House Press Conference held after the meeting, ''Spiegel'' stated, &quot;Of course the rather more reserved chancellor couldn't really keep up with [Obama's]...[[charm offensive]],&quot; but to reciprocate for Obama's &quot;good natured&quot; diplomacy, &quot;she gave it a go...by mentioning the experiences of Obama's sister in Heidelberg, making it clear that she had read his autobiography&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,632961,00.html |title=A Trans-Atlantic Show of Friendship: Obama Praises His 'Friend Chancellor Merkel'|publisher=Spiegel.de |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vladimir Putin 8 March 2008-3.jpg|thumb|left|Merkel and [[Vladimir Putin]], then Prime Minister of Russia, holding a joint press conference, March 8, 2008.]]
In 2006 Merkel expressed concern for [[Russia in the European energy sector|overreliance on Russian energy]], but she received little support from others in [[Berlin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/2008/0306/p06s01-wogn.html|title=Dependence on Russian gas worries some – but not all – European countries|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|date=2008-03-06|accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israel====
On 16 March 2008, Merkel arrived in Israel to mark the 60th [[Yom Ha'atzmaut|anniversary of the Jewish state]]. She was greeted at the airport by Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]], an honor guard and many of the country's political and religious leaders, including most of the Israeli Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/03/16/news/mideast.php|title=Chancellor of Germany goes to Israel|publisher=The New York Times|date=2008-03-16|accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until then, US President [[George W.

Merkel has supported Israeli diplomatic initiatives, opposing the Palestinian bid for membership at the UN. However, Merkel was offended when settlement building continued beyond the Green Line,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishfederations.org/page.aspx?id=202704 |title=Merkel: Israel Must Stop Settlement Building |publisher=Jewishfederations.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and felt personally betrayed by the Israeli government's behavior. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keinon |first=Herb |url=http://www.jpost.com/DiplomacyAndPolitics/Article.aspx?id=206071 |title=PM, Merkel disagree openly on settlements - Diplomacy &amp; Politics  |publisher=Jpost.com |date=2011-01-31 |accessdate=2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--
===Economic and financial policy===
--&gt;

====Liquidity crisis====
Following [[Liquidity crisis of September 2008|major falls in worldwide stock markets in September 2008]], the German government stepped in to assist the [[mortgage loan|mortgage]] company [[Hypo Real Estate]] with a bailout which was agreed on October 6, with German banks to contribute €30 billion and the [[Deutsche Bundesbank|Bundesbank]] €20 billion to a credit line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=amxJTktF7JMs&amp;refer=home|title=Hypo Real Gets EU50 Billion Government-Led Bailout|last=Parkin|first=Brian|coauthors=Suess, Oliver|date=6 October 2008|work=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 October 2008, a Saturday, following the [[Government of Ireland|Irish Government's]] decision to guarantee all deposits in private savings accounts, a move she strongly criticized,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2008/10/05/ap5510085.html|title=Germany guarantees all private bank accounts|publisher=Forbes.com|accessdate=2008-10-06|deadurl=yes| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081006124948/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2008/10/05/ap5510085.html| archivedate= 6 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merkel said there were no plans for the German Government to do the same. The following day, Merkel stated that the government would guarantee private savings account deposits, after all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/10/05/AR2008100500816.html?hpid=sec-business|title=Germany to guarantee Private Bank Accounts|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=2008-10-06 | first=Craig | last=Whitlock | date=2008-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, two days later, on 6 October 2008, it emerged that the pledge was simply a political move that would not be backed by legislation.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot; /&gt; Other European governments eventually either raised the limits or promised to guarantee savings in full.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7654182.stm|title=Bank uncertainty hits UK shares|publisher=BBC| accessdate=2008-10-06 | date=2008-10-06| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081007064831/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7654182.stm| archivedate= 7 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====India====
Merkel and [[India]]n Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]] made a  ‘Joint Declaration’ emphasising the Indo-German strategic partnership in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;india&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.india.diplo.de/Vertretung/indien/en/09__Politics/Bilaterals/Bilateral__Relations.html|title=Germany and India - Celebrating 60 Years of Diplomatic relations|work=india.diplo.de|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It turned the focus of future cooperation onto the fields of energy, science and technology, and defence. A similar Declaration, signed during Merkel’s visit to [[India]] in 2007, noted the substantial progress made in Indo-German relations and set ambitious goals for their development in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;india&quot;/&gt; The relationship with India on the basis of cooperation and partnership was further strengthened with Merkel's visit to India in 2011. At the invitation of the Indian government, the two countries held their first intergovernmental consultations in [[New Delhi]]. These consultations set a new standard in the implementation of the strategic partnership, as India became only the third non-European country with which Germany has had this nature of comprehensive consultations.&lt;ref name=&quot;india&quot;/&gt; India became the first [[Asia]]n country to hold a joint cabinet meeting with Germany during Merkel's state visit.&lt;ref name=&quot;timesofindia.indiatimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Angela-Merkel-in-India-for-joint-cabinet-meet/articleshow/8659994.cms|title=Angela Merkel in India for joint cabinet meet|publisher=The Times of India|date=2011-05-31|accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Indian government presented the [[Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding]] for the year 2009 to Merkel. A statement issued by the Government of India stated that the award “recognises her personal devotion and enormous efforts for sustainable and equitable development, for good governance and understanding and for the creation of a world better positioned to handle the emerging challenges of the 21st century.”&lt;ref name=&quot;india&quot;/&gt;

===Failure of multiculturalism===
In October 2010 Merkel told a meeting of younger members of her conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party at [[Potsdam]] that attempts to build a [[Multiculturalism|multicultural]] society in Germany had &quot;utterly failed&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11559451 | work=BBC News | title=Merkel says German multicultural society has failed | date=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; stating: &quot;The concept that we are now living side by side and are happy about it does not work&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20101017/wl_afp/germanymuslimreligionimmigration ]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that &quot;we feel attached to the Christian concept of mankind, that is what defines us.

===Approval===
Midway through her second term, Merkel's approval plummeted in the country, resulting in heavy losses in state elections for her party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/21/angela-merkel-crushed-hamburg-polls|title=Angela Merkel's party crushed in Hamburg poll|publisher=The Guardian|date=2011-02-21|accessdate=2011-08-23|location=London|first=Helen|last=Pidd}}&lt;/ref&gt; A poll in August 2011 found her coalition with only 36% support compared to a rival coalition which had 51%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/Chancellor+Angela+Merkel/articles/tvb0mRYv0RF/German+opposition+hits+11+year+high+polls|title=German opposition hits 11-year high in polls|publisher=France24|date=2011-08-05|accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she scored well on her handling of the recent euro crisis (69% rated her performance as good rather than poor), and her approval rating reached an all-time high of 77% in February 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stern.de/politik/deutschland/union-dank-merkel-im-umfrage-aufwind-1784909.html|title=Union dank Merkel im Umfrage-Aufwind|publisher=Stern.de|date=2012-02-10|accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cabinets==

The [[Cabinet Merkel I|first cabinet of Angela Merkel]] was sworn in at 16:00 [[Central European Time|CET]], on 22 November 2005.

On 31 October 2005, after the defeat of his favoured candidate for the position of Secretary General of the SPD, [[Franz Müntefering]] indicated that he would resign as Chairman of the party in November, which he did. Ostensibly responding to this, [[Edmund Stoiber]] (CSU), who was originally nominated for the Economics and Technology post, announced his withdrawal on 1 November 2005. While this was initially seen as a blow to Merkel's attempt at forming a viable coalition and cabinet, the manner in which Stoiber withdrew earned him much ridicule and severely undermined his position as a Merkel rival. Separate conferences of the CDU, CSU, and SPD approved the proposed Cabinet on 14 November 2005

The [[Cabinet Merkel II|second cabinet of Angela Merkel]] was sworn in on 28 October 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;cabinet2009&quot;&gt;Penfold, Chuck (2009-10-30). Merkel's new cabinet sworn in.

==Honours==

In 2006, Angela Merkel was awarded the [[Vision for Europe Award]] for her contribution toward greater European integration. In 2007, Merkel was awarded an [[honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afhu.org/site/press_releases/news_merkel.htm American Friends of the Hebrew University]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.huji.ac.il/htbin/hon_doc/doc_search.pl |title=Honorary Doctorates – The Hebrew University of Jerusalem |publisher=.huji.ac.il |date= |accessdate=2010-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2006, the Italian President of the Republic gave the German Chancellor the recognition of ''Dama di Gran Croce Ordine al Merito della Repubblica Italiana''.

==Comparisons==
As a female politician from a [[centre right]] party who is also a scientist, Merkel has been compared by many in the English-language press to former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]]. Some have referred to her as &quot;[[Iron Lady]]&quot;, &quot;Iron Girl&quot;, and even &quot;The Iron Frau&quot; (all alluding to Thatcher, whose nickname was &quot;The Iron Lady&quot;—Thatcher also has a science degree: an Oxford University degree in chemistry). Political commentators have debated the precise extent to which their agendas are similar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2122001/ |title=Is Angela Merkel the next Maggie Thatcher? |work=Slate |date=July 5, 2005 |last=Risen |first=Clay |publisher=[[Slate (magazine)]] |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in her tenure, Merkel acquired the [[nickname]] &quot;''Mutti''&quot; (from a German familiar form of 'mother'), said by ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' to refer to an idealised mother figure from the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,659018,00.html |title=Merkel's Dream of a Place in the History Books |last=Kurbjuweit |first=Dirk |date=11 March 2009 |publisher=Spiegel Online International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to being the first female German chancellor, the first to represent a Federal Republic of Germany that included the former East Germany (though she was born in the West and moved to the East a few weeks after her birth, when her father decided to return to East Germany as  a Lutheran pastor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Langguth | first = Gerd | title = Angela Merkel | year = 2005 | month = August | publisher = DTV | location = Munich | language = German | isbn = 3-423-24485-2 |page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the youngest German chancellor since the Second World War, Merkel is also the first born after World War II, and the first chancellor of the Federal Republic with a background in natural sciences. She studied physics; her predecessors studied law, business or history or were military officers, among others.

[[Forbes]] has named her the fourth most powerful person in the world as of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/powerful-people/list/|title=The World's Most Powerful People|publisher=Forbes|date=|accessdate=2012-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Merkel has been criticised for being personally present and involved at the M100 Media Award handover&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://in.reuters.com/article/idINIndia-51367120100908 | work=Reuters | title=Merkel honours Mohammad cartoonist at press award | date=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Danish [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|cartoonist]] [[Kurt Westergaard]]. This happened at a time of fierce emotional debate in Germany over disparaging remarks about Muslim immigrants made by the former [[Deutsche Bundesbank]] executive [[Thilo Sarrazin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,714643-2,00.html The Sarrazin Debate: Germany Is Becoming Islamophobic].

A ZMD spokesman, Aiman Mazyek, told public broadcaster Deutschlandradio that the Chancellor was honouring someone &quot;who in our eyes kicked our prophet, and therefore kicked all Muslims&quot;. He said giving Mr Westergaard the prize in a &quot;highly charged and heated time&quot; was &quot;highly problematic&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11236158 | work=BBC News | title=Merkel honours Danish Muhammad cartoonist Westergaard | date=2010-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the left party&lt;ref&gt;[http://die-linke.de/nc/die_linke/nachrichten/detail/artikel/merkels-affront-gegen-muslime/ DIE LINKE: Merkels Affront gegen Muslime].

It was true that the right to freedom of expression also applies to cartoons, she said. &quot;But if a chancellor also makes a speech on top of that, it serves to heat up the debate.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,716503,00.html Award for Danish Muhammad Cartoonist: Merkel Defends Press Freedom, Condemns Koran-Burning].

The ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' newspaper wrote: &quot;This will probably be the most explosive appointment of her chancellorship so far.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/s/Rub9B4326FE2669456BAC0CF17E0C7E9105/Doc~E6762D4CF046141829F1A9533368C843E~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html Ehrung des Mohammed-Karikaturisten: Angela Merkels Risiko – Integration – Feuilleton].

In September 2010, concerning a debate on integration, Merkel said to the Frankfurter Allgemeine that &quot;Germans will see more mosques&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} [http://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article9716872/Merkel-Deutsche-werden-mehr-Moscheen-sehen.html Islam: Merkel – Deutsche werden mehr Moscheen sehen – Nachrichten Politik – Deutschland – WELT ONLINE].
