'''Yvonne Ridley''' (born 23 April 1958, [[Stanley, County Durham]], England) is a British journalist, [[war correspondent]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/the-women-in-the-war-zone-748290.html &quot;The women in the war zone – Yvonne Ridley, who is under Taliban arrest, is one of a whole new breed of female war correspondent&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[RESPECT The Unity Coalition|Respect Party]] activist best known for her capture by the [[Taliban]] and subsequent conversion to Islam after release, her outspoken opposition to [[Zionism]], and her criticism of Western media portrayals of the [[War on Terror]]. Ridley currently works for [[Press TV]], the [[Iran]]ian-funded English language news channel.

==Biography==
As a young girl, she already had an ambition for professional reporting. Stimulated at 14 by the publication of a letter she sent to the ''[[Evening Chronicle]]'' in Newcastle, she was determined to become a journalist. At 16, she wrote to every newspaper group in the UK and subsequently she attended a journalism course at the [[London College of Printing]]. Since then she has written for ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', ''[[The Independent on Sunday]]'', ''[[The Observer]]'', ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'' and the ''[[News of the World]]'' and she was deputy editor of ''[[Wales on Sunday]]''. She was chief reporter when the ''[[Sunday Express]]'', sent her to Afghanistan after [[11 September attacks|9/11]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kate Kellaway |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2001/nov/18/katekellaway.featuresreview |title=Hit by friendly fire – Yvonne Ridley's attempt to sneak into Afghanistan was a disaster, but that doesn't make her a bad mother, as some critics suggested. Her real crime, she says, was being a tabloid reporter |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=23 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has also worked as a broadcaster, producer and presenter on programmes for [[BBC TV]] and radio, [[CNN]], [[ITN]] and [[Carlton TV]] travelling to Afghanistan, Iraq, Gaza and the West Bank. A founder member of Women in Journalism, she was also a promoter of women’s rights, although after she converted to Islam, she publicly criticised some aspects of the 'sisterhood' promoted by Western feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10337942 |title=Muslim sisterhood eclipses feminism, says Brit convert |work=The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=2011-10-28 |first=Julie |last=Middleton |date=28 July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also a founder member of the [[Stop The War Coalition]] and the RESPECT political party.

In her spare time Ridley travels throughout the UK and across the globe promoting peace and the anti-war message.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}  She has also delivered lectures on issues relating to Iraq, Israel, Afghanistan, Chechnya, Kashmir and Uzbekistan, Women in Islam, the War on Terror and journalism at universities across the US, Australia, South Africa and the Middle East. Ridley is a founder member of the Friends of Islam, an All Party Parliamentary Group and Women in Journalism. In addition she is a member of the [[National Union of Journalists]], the [[International Federation of Journalists]], a founder of Women in Journalism, and is also a member of the [[Society of Authors]]. She has written two books called &quot;In The Hands of the Taliban&quot;&lt;ref&gt;review [http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2001/dec/15/digestedread &quot;In the Hands of the Taliban by Yvonne Ridley&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Ticket to Paradise&quot; and is currently writing and researching for two other titles including a biography of [[Osama bin Laden]]. Ridley is a patron of the UK-based pressure groups [[Cageprisoners]] and Hhugs. She also devotes much of her time to humanitarian work and charities.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

===Personal life===
Ridley has married twice.&lt;ref&gt;Observer Woman, July 2008 no.31&lt;/ref&gt; Her first husband was Daoud Zaaroura, a former [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] officer. Zaaroura was a PLO colonel when Ridley met him in [[Cyprus]], where she was working on an assignment for the Newcastle-based ''[[Sunday Sun]]''. They had one daughter called Daisy who was born in 1992.
Her second husband was a detective with Northumbria Police.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2001/09/29/wrid29.xml &quot;British journalist is seized by Taliban&quot;], By David Blair in Peshawar, Tom Leonard and Paul Stokes, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' (online), 29 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt; During her time on the Sunday Sun newsdesk, she told colleagues she was an officer in the Territorial Army, based on Teesside, specialising in intelligence. She had also told the same to colleagues on the Northern Echo.

===Capture by the Taliban===
Yvonne Ridley came to prominence on 28 September 2001, when she was captured by the Taliban in [[Afghanistan]] whilst working for the ''Sunday Express''. Repeatedly refused an entrance visa, she decided to follow the example of BBC reporter [[John Simpson (journalist)|John Simpson]], who had crossed the border anonymously in a [[burqa]].

Colleagues said Ridley responded to text messages from friends until 26 September 2001, after having told them she would attempt to cross the border from Pakistan into Afghanistan. It became clear that she had been discovered without passport or visa, and was held by the authorities after being arrested with her guides, the [[Afghan]] refugee Nagibullah Muhmand and Pakistani Jan Ali, in a village in the Dour Daba district near the eastern city of [[Jalalabad]] in [[Nangahar]], close to the border with [[Pakistan]]. She was dressed like an Afghan, but it is believed she was caught after attempting to take photographs, an illegal activity under the Taliban. She was spotted two days later, on 28 September, after slipping across the border by local people who pointed her out to security forces, who took her to Jalalabad for further investigation on possible espionage charges, that carried the death penalty. Shortly before, the Taliban had asked all foreigners to leave the country and had said they would not issue visas to journalists. They threatened that anyone found using a satellite phone would be executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Luke Harding and Rory McCarthy in Islamabad |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/oct/05/pressandpublishing.warinafghanistan2001 |title=British journalist to face trial, say Taliban – Captive Ridley on spy charge after using camera |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=5 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/taliban-plans-to-put-journalist-on-trial-630226.html &quot;Taliban plans to put journalist on trial – War on terrorism: Detainee&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

She would at least be prosecuted for entering the country illegally, reported the Afghan Islamic Press agency, quoting the Taliban's deputy foreign minister, [[Mullah Abdur Rahman Zahid]].&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian2001&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Jessica Hodgson |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/oct/04/pressandpublishing.afghanistan |title=Taliban dash hopes of Ridley's early release |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=4 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Qudratullah Jamal]], the Taliban's information minister, expressed the suspicion that Ridley was possibly a member of a military &quot;special forces&quot; unit like the British [[Special Air Service|SAS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jessica Hodgson |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/oct/03/pressandpublishing.afghanistan |title=Ridley 'committed serious crime', say Taliban |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=3 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jessica Hodgson |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/oct/04/pressandpublishing.afghanistan1 |title=Foreign Office urges fair trial for Ridley |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=4 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Rory McCarthy in Islamabad and Stuart Millar |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/oct/04/afghanistan.world1 |title=Taliban raise stakes against British reporter |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=4 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also suggested that she and other westerners could be kept by the Taliban as hostages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/the-westerners-whose-fate-is-in-the-talibans-hands-671434.html &quot;The Westerners whose fate is in the Taliban's hands – War on Terrorism: Prisoners&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The British high commissioner to [[Pakistan]], [[Hilary Synnott]], met the Taliban-ambassador in [[Islamabad]], [[Mullah Abdul Salam Zaeef]] and opened negotiations intended at a quick release of Ridley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/british-diplomat-in-talks-with-taliban-to-release-journalist-630124.html &quot;British diplomat in talks with Taliban to release journalist – War on terrorism: Detainee&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jessica Hodgson |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/oct/01/terrorismandthemedia.pressandpublishing |title=Ridley decision 'within 24 hours' |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=1 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Claire Cozens |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/oct/02/pressandpublishing.terrorismandthemedia |title=High commissioner pushes for journalist's release |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=2 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the press in Britain speculated about the reason of her arrest and the seriousness of the suspicion,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/fate-of-captured-reporter-to-be-decided-very-soon-630009.html &quot;Fate of captured reporter to be decided 'very soon' – War on terrorism: Detainee&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/yvonne-will-be-getting-her-own-way-during-this-says-journalists-mother-671431.html &quot;'Yvonne will be getting her own way during this,' says journalist's mother – War on Terrorism: The Family&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/oct/04/gender.uk1 |title=Just doing her job – Helen Carter on her friend Yvonne Ridley, who is being held captive by the Taliban |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=4 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; she was kept in solitary confinement for seven days and then moved to a prison in Kabul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Claire Cozens |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/oct/08/pressandpublishing.warinafghanistan20011 |title=Ridley release delayed |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=8 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the prison in Kabul she met the Christian missionary [[Heather Mercer]], who was also kept by the Taliban and was unaware of the latest developments&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Dee O'Connell |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theobserver/2004/apr/25/features.magazine67 |title=What happened next |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=25 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the release of Ridley, her guides Jan Ali and Nagibullah Muhmand, as well as Basmena, the five-year-old daughter of the latter, were kept by the Taliban in a prison in Kabul, according to [[Reporters sans Frontières]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Steven Morris and Rory Carroll |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/oct/27/afghanistan.terrorism4 |title=Daughter of Ridley's guide in Taliban jail |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=27 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jason Burke, Charsadda |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/oct/21/terrorism.september11 |title=Family of British reporter's guide flung into jail in Taliban purge |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=31 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conversion to Islam===
According her own account after her release, during her captivity she was asked by one of her captors to convert to Islam; she refused, but gave her word she would read the [[Qur'an]] after her release.

In freedom, she kept this promise, as she said partly to find out why the Taliban treated women as they do.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=elliberdator |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkN6P8Bp7jE |title=Yvonne Ridley on the Taliban (MSU) |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said it changed her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Eloise Napier |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2004/feb/24/pressandpublishing.afghanistan |title=Articles of faith – Yvonne Ridley was a hard-drinking, hard-nosed news reporter until her capture by the Taliban and subsequent conversion to Islam. She tells Eloise Napier how the Koran changed her life |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=24 February 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Qur'an, she says describing the holy book of Islam, is a &quot;[[magna carta]] for women&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/3663771.stm |work=BBC News  | title=A Muslim in the family | date=1 May 2004 | first=Roger | last=Childs}}&lt;/ref&gt; She converted to Islam in the summer of 2003, stating that her new faith has helped put behind her broken marriages and a reputation as the &quot;[[Patsy Stone]] of [[Fleet Street]].&quot; When comparing her treatment to female prisoners' held in American custody, such as [[Aafia Siddiqui]], she said that in Taliban's custody she was given her full privacy as a woman, and was handed the key to the door of her cell to lock from the inside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvHcgww2xGQ&amp;feature=PlayList&amp;p=BDDC7ACADA21CB6F&amp;index=3 &quot;yvonne ridley, the plight of Dr. Aafia Sidiqui part 3&quot;]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, she described her journey of faith for the BBC's religion site (see [http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/conversion/family.shtml A Muslim in the Family]), as well as in other publications and on other occasions in which she emerged as a ''&quot;fierce critic of the West&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/jul/06/women.features4  &quot;Free radical – She was the British journalist captured by the Taliban trying to get into Afghanistan wearing a burka.

===Subsequent career===
Ridley's memoir detailing the 11 days she was held captive, ''In the Hands of the Taliban: Her Extraordinary Story''. ''Ticket to Paradise'' (Dandelion Books, LLC 2003), a novel based on the backdrop of 9/11,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/friday-fell-off-donkey-captured-by-taliban-v-scary-619880.html &quot;Friday. Fell off donkey. Captured by Taliban. V. scary&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; was written before she converted to Islam; friends say it was never published in the UK because she was too embarrassed by its risque content.

In December 2001 she expressed worries that officers from [[Mossad]], the Israeli secret service, or from other intelligence agencies were plotting to have her killed, in an effort to boost public support for the war in Afghanistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Julia Day |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/dec/13/pressandpublishing.terrorismandthemedia |title=Ridley fears for her life |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=13 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/media/intelligence-services-wanted-me-killed-says-journalist-619619.html &quot;Intelligence services wanted me killed, says journalist – Yvonne Ridley makes astonishing claim in book about her days of captivity with the Taliban&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

She announced a return to Afghanistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Owen Gibson |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2001/dec/07/pressandpublishing.afghanistan |title=Ridley to return to Afghanistan |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=7 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; which she did with her daughter Daisy, who also had a great deal of media attention during the captivity of her mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Yvonne Ridley |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/travel/2002/may/05/observerescapesection |title=Daisy (and Yvonne)'s big adventure – After her kidnap ordeal at the hands of the Taliban last autumn, journalist Yvonne Ridley decided to take her nine-year-old daughter on a month's tour around the world – via Afghanistan |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=22 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2003 saw Yvonne Ridley employed by the [[Qatar]]-based media organisation [[Al Jazeera]], where, as a senior editor, she helped launch the English language version of their website.  On 12 November of that year she was fired because Al Jazeera found her &quot;overly-vocal and argumentative style&quot; was incompatible with the station’s programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/homeground/archive/2004/yvonne_ridley.shtml &quot;Yvonne Ridley – in the line of fire&quot;], ''BBC Two'' (online), 23 March 2004&lt;/ref&gt; After her departure from Qatar, she published an article about her experiences there.

She won her case for [[unfair dismissal]] against the organisation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.journalism.co.uk/news/story1331.shtml &quot;Crusading journalist wins case against Al-Jazeera&quot;], ''journalism.co.uk'' (online), 6 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; but was asked to return in May 2006 when it lodged an appeal against the Qatari court decision. Ridley won the appeal and the judge ordered her original award be doubled. However Al Jazeera once again lodged an appeal with the case going to the Supreme Court for a final hearing. She won that case through lawyers Gebran Majdalany in December 2007 and was awarded 100,000 [[Qatari riyal]]s, which equates to around £13,885, damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Leigh Holmwood |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/mar/06/television |title=Yvonne Ridley wins al-Jazeera damages |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Yvonne Ridley |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2008/mar/10/medialaw.television |title=The fine line between victory and defeat – After a four-year legal battle, the former Express journalist has finally won her case against al-Jazeera English, but at a heavy cost |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=10 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, when she stood again in the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|May 2005 general election]], her share of the vote dropped to 6.4%. In the local government elections in 2006 she stood unsuccessfully for a seat on [[Westminster Council]].

She began presenting ''The Agenda With Yvonne Ridley'', the [[Islam Channel]]'s politics and current affairs show, in October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.islamchannel.tv/ProgramDetail.aspx?id=5&amp;date=10/13/2005&lt;/ref&gt; However, the show and Ridley were axed from the channel after she refused to shake the hand of a [[Saudi royal family|Saudi prince]] at a post-[[Hajj]] feast.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} The channel blamed [[Ofcom]] for exerting pressure, which that organisation denies. According to several published reports, Saudi pressure was brought to bear upon the channel head over the hand-shaking incident.

Ridley works as a freelance journalist/presenter and for several years, until 30 March 2013 regularly worked for [[Press TV]], the Iranian English language 24-hour news channel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Oliver Burkeman, Helen Pidd and Robert Tait in Tehran |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/jul/03/iran.television |title='An antidote to Fox': Iran launches English TV channel – Report of Glasgow attack says event staged by Britain to discredit Muslims |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=3 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; hosting many talk shows among them ''The Agenda''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.presstv.com/Programs/#1&lt;/ref&gt; being the major one. She also writes a column for the New York-based ''Daily Muslims''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muslimsweekly.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=blogcategory&amp;id=85&amp;Itemid=241 ]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other publications. In May 2008, in an assignment by Press TV, she and the film-maker David Miller shot a documentary based on Guantanamo Bay after being given unprecedented access to the now defunct Camp X-Ray and the operational Camp Delta, by the US military which operates the naval base in Cuba where hundreds of men, defined as enemy combatants, have been detained since January 2002. Their film Guantanamo: Inside the Wire was nominated in the 2009 Roma TV Film Festival in Italy and in the Al Jazeera Film Festival in Doha 2010. Another of her films, In Search of Prisoner 650 was also nominated in 2010 at the Al Jazeera Film Festival.

Since first August 2008, Yvonne Ridley has joined the ''Free Gaza Movement''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freegaza.org/index.php?language=EN&amp;module=boat_updates |title=News section |publisher=Freegaza |accessdate=2011-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Cyprus as it heads for Gaza to challenge the Israeli siege. Press TV is following the progress of the movement and Yvonne Ridley, who will be on board with Indy film-maker Haq Nawaz, and is publishing her blogs to Press TV's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=66820&amp;sectionid=3510304 |title=No Operation |publisher=Presstv.com |accessdate=2011-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The SS Free Gaza and the SS Free Liberty both arrived without incident in Gaza on 23 August. During their brief stay Prime Minister Ismael Haniyeh gave  a rare interview to Yvonne Ridley which was later broadcast on Press TV. As the free Gaza Movement activists departed four days later Gaza PM Haniyeh issued genuine Palestinian passports with diplomatic status to the majority describing them as Ambassadors for Palestine. The film To Gaza with Love by Nawaz and Ridley has been shown in several film festivals and was nominated for an award at a London film festival in 2009.

In November 2008 she and the young award-winning film maker and journalist [[Hassan Ghani|Hassan al Banna Ghani]] headed for Afghanistan in the Spring of 2009 to produce a documentary about female prisoners being held by the US. In Search of Prisoner 650 which was broadcast by Press TV. During the making of the film the two came under fire amid a clash between the Taliban and Afghan police on the road to Ghazni. The drama was filmed and used in their documentary.

In March 2009 Ridley and [[George Galloway]], then a RESPECT MP, founded the organisation [[Viva Palestina]] and took a convoy of more than 100 vehicles bearing aid across North Africa to Gaza via the Rafah border. Again collaborating with film-maker Ghani, Ridley made a documentary about the 25-day journey called Three Uncles go to Gaza. The film was highly acclaimed by critics at the Istanbul Human Rights film festival in December 2009.

In a column by [[Dominic Lawson]] in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' on 5 July 2009 Ridley along with other journalists was accused of being a stooge for the Iranian regime.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;''Iran's British stooges are staring right at you''&quot;, Sunday Times 5 July 2009. Retrieved 5 July 2009 [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/dominic_lawson/article6638036.ece]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011 Ridley made a 40 minute exclusive interview with Mona Thwany, widow of the [[2010 Stockholm bombings|2010 Stockholm suicide bomber]]. Swedish journalists were critical of the interview, saying she asked very few critical questions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nyheterna.se/1.1967600/ Få kritiska frågor till terroristfru], Nyheterna.se, TV4 Group, 4 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Ridley said later, this was &quot;sour grapes&quot; as she was the only journalist given access to the widow.

==Her views==
Her vocal support for causes involving [[Palestine]], Iraq, [[Afghanistan]], [[Kashmir]], [[Chechnya]], [[Xinjiang]] and [[Uzbekistan]] have made her a popular speaker in anti-war circles.&lt;ref&gt;''e.g.'' [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2002/nov/01/september11.immigrationpolicy &quot;Anti-war protesters in Halloween day of action&quot;] [http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2004/jan/23/iraq.iraq1 &quot;Anti-war coalition looks to the future – Full interview with Salma Yaqoob&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; During  a February 2006 meeting at [[Imperial College London]]&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Morgan  [http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=26365 &quot;Europe's Islamist-Leftist Alliance&quot;], Frontpage magazine, 1 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Ridley described [[Israel]] as &quot;that disgusting little watchdog of America that is festering in the Middle East&quot; and further that her party, the [[Respect – The Unity Coalition|Respect Party]], &quot;is a [[Zionism|Zionist]]-free party ... if there was any Zionism in the Respect Party they would be hunted down and kicked out.

At the &quot;Muslimer i Dialog&quot; conference in [[Copenhagen]] in September 2005, Ridley was asked if she didn't see it as a problem that militant [[Islamists]] distribute recruiting videos of [[Iraqi insurgents]] killing hostages. She replied that it was necessary for Muslims to have these videos at home as an alternative form of news to what she perceived as the propaganda of Western media. At the same meeting she compared British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] with [[Pol Pot]]. Since then Ridley has said that the Danish record and translation of her speech was incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://viking-observer.blogspot.com/2005/10/place-blame-everywhere-but-where-it-is.html &quot;Place blame everywhere but where it is due&quot;], ''Viking Observer'', 29 October 2005.

Critics have accused her of defending the late [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] and his campaign of violence in Iraq and [[Jordan]], describing the victims of the 9 November [[2005 Amman bombings]] in Jordan, which saw 60 persons killed and 115 injured, as Iraqi collaborators, Saudi, Indonesian and Chinese intelligence officers and the upper echelons of society. The outpouring of public outrage manifested in spontaneous demonstration she described as staged and the work of &quot;Jordanian troops out of uniform&quot; and &quot;government lackeys&quot; together with &quot;Christian and Muslim Bedouins&quot; who had all been commandeered or paid to demonstrate by the Jordanian government and the [[CIA]]. Al-Zarqawi was denounced by his family after the bombings, a move that Ridley thought &quot;cowardly.&quot; She said of al-Zarqawi himself that she would &quot;rather put up with a brother like Abu Musab al-Zarqawi any day than have a traitor or sell-out for a father, son or grandfather&quot; – a reference to the Jordanian royal family.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Something Rather Repugnant&quot; by Yvonne Ridley, ''Tajdeed'', 23 November 2005.)&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting of the Respect party on 6 June 2006, following the [[2 June 2006 Forest Gate raid|Forest Gate raid]], Ridley urged all Muslims in Britain to &quot;boycott the police and refuse to co-operate with them in any way, shape or form until the boys are released,&quot; attacking [[Sami Yusuf]] including &quot;asking the community copper for directions to passing the time of day with a beat officer.&quot; Her comments were labelled as &quot;sheer, undiluted madness&quot; by Shadow Home Secretary [[David Davis (British politician)|David Davis]], who added that &quot;To not co-operate would be of no benefit to the Muslim community; no benefit to the police; and no benefit to the security of our country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Churcher |first=Joe |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/respect-urges-muslims-to-end-police-cooperation-481413.html |title=Respect urges Muslims to end police co-operation |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=7 June 2006 |accessdate=19 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/jun/07/terrorism.immigrationpolicy |title=Muslims urged to end Met cooperation |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=19 November 2011 |date=7 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5054600.stm Call to UK Muslims over police help], ''BBC News'', 7 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; But at the time [[George Galloway]], leader of the RESPECT Coalition to which Ridley belongs also distanced himself from her comments, saying &quot;Our policy is not that we should withdraw co-operation from the police.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5062264.stm Galloway disowns police boycott], ''BBC News'', 8 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The two men were subsequently released without charge and an official apology was later issued to the family by the Metropolitan Police Force.

To start with, Ridley strongly opposed the Western intervention in the [[Libyan civil war]], and  spoke in a rally opposing it held in Central London. However, after talking with Libyan friends who asked her to &quot;come and see for herself&quot;, she traveled to rebel-held [[Benghazi]] where she became a wholehearted supporter of the Libyan rebels' cause and accepted that they had no choice by to ask for the Western powers' help. This was expressed in an article entitled ''&quot;I was wrong to oppose military intervention in Libya – wrong, wrong, wrong&quot;'' ([http://www.redress.cc/global/yridley20110430]) which she wrote in Benghazi on 30 April 2011.
In February 2012 she expressed her strong support for the end of secret evidence used in the SIAC case against the controversial Jordanian cleric, Abu Qatada, and her opposition to Theresa May's plans to deport him on the basis of the secret evidence from the UK. http://themuslim.ca/2012/02/17/british-justice-in-dock-over-abu-qatada/
