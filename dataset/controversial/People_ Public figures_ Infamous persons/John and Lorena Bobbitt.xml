'''John Wayne Bobbitt''' (born March 23, 1967 in [[Buffalo, New York]]) and '''Lorena Bobbitt''' ([[née]] '''Gallo''', born October 31, 1970 in [[Bucay, Ecuador]]) were an American couple, married on June 18, 1989, whose difficult relationship gained worldwide notoriety for an incident in 1993 when Lorena [[Removal of penis|severed]] John's [[penis]] with a knife. The penis was subsequently surgically re-attached.

==Incident==
During the night of June 23, 1993, John Wayne Bobbitt arrived at the couple's apartment in [[Manassas, Virginia]], allegedly intoxicated after a night of partying. According to testimony given by Lorena Bobbitt in a 1994 court hearing, he then [[rape]]d her. (In 1994 he was tried for and acquitted of [[spousal rape]], prosecuted by the same [[district attorney]] who prosecuted Lorena for attacking her husband.) Afterwards, Lorena Bobbitt got out of bed and went to the kitchen for a drink of water. Grabbing the knife, Lorena Bobbitt entered the bedroom where John was sleeping and proceeded to cut off nearly half of his [[penis]].&lt;ref name=crimelibrary&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/sexual_assault/severed_penis/index.html|title=Crimes Below the Belt: Penile Removal and Castration (Chapter 1)|last=Bell|first=Rachael|accessdate=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After assaulting her husband, Lorena left the apartment with the severed penis, drove a short while, then rolled down the car window and threw the penis into a field. Realizing the severity of the incident, she stopped and called [[9-1-1|911]]. After an exhaustive search, the penis was located, packed in ice, and taken to the hospital where John Bobbitt was being treated.

The penis was reattached by Doctors James T. Sehn and David Berman during a nine-and-a-half-hour operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/72192851.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Oct+7%2C+1993&amp;author=Joel+Achenbach&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=C.01&amp;desc=A+STITCH+IN+TIME%3B+%60My+Wife+Cut+Me%2C%27+John+Bobbitt+Said.+For+Two+Doctors%2C+It+Was+a+Night+To+Remember.|title=A Stitch in Time:`My Wife Cut Me' John Bobbitt Said. For Two Doctors, It Was a Night To Remember.|first=Joel|last=Achenbach|accessdate=2009-12-14|date=1993-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrest and trial==
[[File:BobbittTrial.jpg|thumb|left|Dr. James T. Sehn presenting evidence of the wounding.]]
Lorena Bobbitt was taken into custody. During the trial, the couple revealed details of their volatile relationship and the events leading up to the assault. She stated that her husband sexually, physically, and emotionally abused her during their marriage. She added that her husband flaunted his [[infidelity|infidelities]], and had forced her to have an [[abortion]]. Several witnesses provided testimony supporting her claims. Her defense attorneys maintained that John's constant abuse caused Lorena to eventually &quot;snap&quot; as she was suffering from [[clinical depression]] and a possible bout of [[post traumatic stress disorder]] due to the abuse.&lt;ref name=crimelibrary2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/criminal_mind/sexual_assault/severed_penis/index.html|title=Crimes Below the Belt: Penile Removal and Castration (Chapter 2)|author=Bell, Rachael|accessdate=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when Lorena was arrested the night of June 23, she told the police, &quot;He always have orgasm [sic], and he doesn't wait for me to have orgasm. He's selfish.&quot;&lt;ref name=timesswiftsword&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979640,00.html|title=TIME Magazine-Swift Sword of Justice|author=Smolowe, Jill &amp; Peterzell, Jay|accessdate=2010-06-23|work=Time|date=1993-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Bobbitt denied the allegations of abuse; however, when he was [[Cross-examination|cross-examined]], his statements often conflicted with known facts, severely weakening the prosecution's case.&lt;ref name=crimelibrary2 /&gt;

After seven hours of deliberation, the jury found Lorena not guilty due to [[insanity defense|insanity]] causing an [[irresistible impulse]] to sexually wound her husband. As a result, she could not be held [[Legal liability|liable]] for her actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.courttv.com/archive/casefiles/verdicts/bobbitt.html Virginia Vs. Lorena Bobbitt, Court TV]. Courttv.com. Retrieved on 2012-10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=May 2012}} Under state law, the judge ordered Lorena to undergo a 45-day evaluation period at Central State Hospital, located in Petersburg, Virginia, after which she would be released.

In 1995, after six years of marriage, Lorena and John divorced.

==After the incident==

===John===
[[File:Bobbitt Uncut.jpg|thumb|150px|DVD Cover of ''John Wayne Bobbitt: Uncut'']]
After the incident, John Wayne Bobbitt attempted to generate money from his notoriety in a number of ways. He formed a band, The Severed Parts, to pay his mounting medical and legal bills, though the band was unsuccessful and failed to generate enough money.&lt;ref name=jwbbio&gt;[[IMDb]]: [http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001956/bio John Wayne Bobbitt – Biography]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, John appeared in the [[Pornographic film|adult film]] ''John Wayne Bobbitt: Uncut'', in another attempt to make money. In 1996, he appeared in another adult film, ''Frankenpenis'' (also known as ''John Wayne Bobbitt's Frankenpenis'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001956/ John Wayne Bobbitt] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998 he appeared on the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]]'s ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]'' television program alongside the porn star character [[Sean Morley|Val Venis]] who at the time &quot;almost&quot;{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} had his penis cut off by a fellow WWE contender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Wrestlecrap: The Very Worst of Pro Wrestling|last=Reynolds|first=R.D.|author=RD Reynolds|year=2003|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|location=[[Toronto, Ontario]]|isbn=1-55022-584-7|pages=222–223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wrestlecrap: The Val Venis Castration|url=http://www.wrestlecrap.com/classic37.html|work=wrestlecrap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after, he moved to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]], where he worked as a bartender, limousine driver, mover, pizza delivery driver, and tow truck operator. He also had a stint serving at a wedding chapel as a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] of a [[Universal Life Church]] in Las Vegas.&lt;ref name=crimelibrary2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Wayne and Lorena Bobbitt Trials: 1993 &amp; 1994 – John Bobbitt's Troubles Continue|url=http://law.jrank.org/pages/3595/John-Wayne-Lorena-Bobbitt-Trials-1993-1994-John-Bobbitt-s-Troubles-Continue.html|author=Bernard Ryan, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the divorce, John continued to have run-ins with the law. He was reportedly arrested seven times for offenses ranging from assault to [[grand larceny]].&lt;ref name=crimelibrary2 /&gt; In 1994, he was convicted of misdemeanor [[Battery (crime)|domestic battery]] against his former fiancée, Kristina Elliott, and sentenced to 15 days in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9906EFDA1738F932A3575AC0A962958260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fB%2fBobbitt%2c%20John%20Wayne|title=Jail for John Bobbitt|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2007-10-14|date=1994-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1999, he was sentenced to five years probation for his role in the theft of more than $140,000 in clothing from a store in [[Fallon, Nevada]], and ordered to pay $5,000 [[restitution]] and serve 100 hours of [[community service]].&lt;ref name=jwbbio /&gt;

After two trials for domestic abuse against Joanna Ferrell, his third wife, in 2004&amp;nbsp;— one ending in conviction for John Bobbitt and the other in acquittal&amp;nbsp;— he was arrested for a third offense in September 2005. Days after the third incident, he filed for a divorce. On February 8, 2006, a municipal judge found him not guilty because of insufficient evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/Feb-08-Wed-2006/news/5773116.html|title=Bobbitt not guilty of domestic battery charges, judge says: Estranged wife says she was pushed to ground|last=McGrath Schwartz|first=David|accessdate=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lorena===
After the trial, Lorena Bobbitt attempted to keep a low profile and reverted to the use of her maiden name, Gallo. In December 1997, Gallo made news when she was charged with [[assault]] for punching her mother, Elvia Gallo, as they watched television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=health&amp;res=9C00E1DA163CF93BA35751C1A961958260|title=Bobbitt's Ex-Wife Charged in Assault|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2007-10-14|date=1997-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was eventually found not guilty of assault and her mother continued to live with her. In 2007, she was working at a beauty salon in the [[Washington, D.C.]] area&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=235414|title=''Lorena Bobbitt Biography''|author=Biography.com|accessdate=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the same year founded Lorena's Red Wagon organization, which helps prevent domestic violence through family oriented activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oprah&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/article/oprahshow/20090409-tows-lorena-bobbitt|title=Lorena Bobbitt's Unforgettable Story|publisher=[[Oprah Winfrey|Oprah.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2008, Gallo appeared on the [[CBS News]] program ''[[The Early Show]]'' where she talked about her life since the incident. In the interview, she said that she was in a long-term relationship with Dave Bellinger and that they had a two-and-a-half-year-old daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/06/25/earlyshow/leisure/celebspot/main4207517.shtml|title=Lorena Bobbitt, 15 Years Later|accessdate=2008-07-28|work=CBS News|date=2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 appearance on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'', Gallo said that if she could take anything back she would never have married John Wayne Bobbitt.

===Joint public appearance===
Although Lorena told [[Oprah Winfrey]] in April 2009 that she had no interest in talking to John,&lt;ref name=&quot;Oprah&quot;/&gt; John and Lorena appeared together on the show ''[[The Insider (TV series)|The Insider]]'' in May 2009. It was their first meeting since their divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinsider.com/news/2098643_John_Lorena_The_Shocking_Bobbitt_Reunion|title=John &amp;amp; Lorena: The Shocking Bobbitt Reunion at The Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=May 2012}} On the show John apologized to Lorena for the way he treated her during their marriage, and Lorena claimed that John still loved her because he continued to send her [[Valentine's Day]] cards and flowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John Bobbitt still loves Lorena 16 years after she hacked off his penis|url=http://buzz7.com/world/john-bobbitt-still-loves-lorena-16-yrs-after-she-hacked-off-his-penis.html|date=May 5, 2009|publisher=[[Asian News International|ANI]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=May 2012}}

==Cultural impact==
The Bobbitt case was one of the first cases that brought public attention to the subject of [[Spousal rape|marital rape]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cultureculture.wordpress.com/2006/01|title=Culture Culture: Conversations in Cultural Criticis|author=Jackson, Danielle|accessdate=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=May 2012}} The case also brought attention to the issue of [[domestic violence]] and the realization that men as well as women can be the victims of such violence. Within days of the incident, domestic violence and feminist groups rallied around Lorena, citing the alleged continuous abuse she suffered at the hands of her husband that caused her to attack him, albeit in an unusual and violent manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/08/us/battle-of-sexes-joined-in-case-of-a-mutilation.html |title=Battle of Sexes Joined in Case Of a Mutilation |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2007-10-14 |date=1993-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Media attention surrounding the case resulted in national debate and also sparked a flurry of jokes, [[Limerick (poetry)|limericks]], [[Slogan|T-shirt slogans]], [[Gimmick|advertising gimmicks]], and an [[urban legend]] that Lorena had later been killed in a car accident because &quot;some prick cut her off&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst;jsessionid=HTGXj49B0KjTkC2LLY1JFF2vbGQvTlmp1xBfyjhth1rh4C2JFxzS!-1287907597?docId=96536733 |title= His Wife Seized His Prize and Cut It to Size: Folk and Popular Commentary on Lorena Bobbitt |author=Pershing, Linda|accessdate=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was quickly adapted/parodied as a low-budget feature film called ''Attack of the 5'2&quot; Women'' starring [[Julie Brown]] as &quot;Lenora Babbitt&quot; along with an adaptation of the [[Tonya Harding]] case. In the film ''[[Fight Club (film)|Fight Club]],'' the character Tyler Durden comments that although the main character's house has been blown up, &quot;You know man...it could be worse, a woman could cut off your penis while you're sleeping and toss it out the window of a moving car&quot;, referencing the Bobbitt case. The incident is also mentioned in the [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic]] single &quot;[[Headline News (song)|Headline News]]&quot;.

Shortly after the incident, episodes of &quot;Bobbittmania&quot;, or [[copycat crimes]], were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19950110/ai_n9629503 |title=Bobbittmania takes a grip on psyche of Latin lover |author=Gumbel, Andrew |accessdate=2007-10-14 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071021012519/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_19950110/ai_n9629503 |archivedate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name Lorena Bobbitt eventually became synonymous with penis removal. The terms &quot;Bobbittised punishment&quot; and &quot;Bobbitt Procedure&quot; gained social recognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icfmt.org/vol2no3/critical.htm |title=A Critical Review of Post-phase Period of Lorena Bobbitt's Indictment |author=Husain, M., Rizvi, S.J., Usmani, J.A. |accessdate=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=May 2012}}

&quot;Mayhem&quot;, a [[Law &amp; Order (season 4)|season 4]] episode of ''[[Law &amp; Order]]'', was partially inspired by this case.

The San-Francisco-based punk band [[Tribe 8]] wrote the song &quot;Castration Song #22&quot; as an homage to Lorena Bobbitt as an unsung feminist hero.

The Canadian punk band [[Ballast]]{{disambiguation needed|date=August 2012}} wrote a song called &quot;Lorena Bobbitt&quot;, which appeared on their record Sound Asleep.

Rapper Lil Wayne has even made cultural reference to the Bobbitt incident in the 2011 song &quot;So Special&quot; by singing &quot; She crazy bout that d*ick, Lorena Bobbitt&quot;. 

[[The Young Dubliners]] wrote a song called &quot;Shame&quot; that reference the incident in the lyric ''And you really put a stop to all my sleeping // When you said that Mrs. Bobbit had it right''

Rapper Kreayshawn has a track on her debut studio album titled &quot;Left Ey3&quot; in which she references the case in the lyric &quot; I'm Lorena Bobbitt and I'm chillin' in my bed. I'm Britney Spears on hella drugs and I just shaved my head&quot;.
