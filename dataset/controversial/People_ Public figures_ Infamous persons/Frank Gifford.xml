'''Francis Newton &quot;Frank&quot; Gifford''' (born August 16, 1930) is a former [[American football]] player and [[United States|American]] [[sportscaster]].

==Early life==
Gifford was born in [[Santa Monica, California]], the son of Lola Mae (née Hawkins) and Weldon Gifford, an oil driller.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/41/Frank-Gifford.html &quot;Frank Gifford Biography (1930-)&quot;], ''filmreference.com''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Gifford &amp; Richmond, ''The Glory Game'', 2008, p.12-13, &amp; various.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from [[Bakersfield High School]], Gifford was unable to gain an athletic scholarship to the [[University of Southern California]] (USC) due to his low [[grade point average]]. Undeterred, he played a season for [[Bakersfield College|Bakersfield Junior College]], making the Junior College All-American team while making the grades needed to enroll at USC.&lt;ref name=espn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/classic/biography/s/Gifford_Frank.html |title=Gifford was star in backfield, booth |author=Mike Puma |publisher=ESPN Classic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GG13&quot;&gt;Cf. Gifford &amp; Richmond, ''The Glory Game'', 2008, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt; 

At USC, Gifford was named an [[All-American]] athlete and player and graduated in the class of 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;GG13&quot;/&gt;  In 1951 he ran for 841 yards on 195 carries.&lt;ref&gt;http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/usc/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/2011-footbl-media-guide.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==NFL career==
He began his [[National Football League|NFL]] career with the [[New York Giants]] by playing both offense and defense, a rarity when platoon football became popular after [[World War II]]. He made eight [[Pro Bowl]] appearances and had five trips to the NFL Championship Game. Gifford's biggest season may have been [[1956 NFL season|1956]], when he won the Most Valuable Player award of the NFL, and led the Giants to the NFL title over the [[1956 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]].

He lost 18 months in the prime of his career when he was laid out by a hard tackle. During a [[1960 NFL season|1960]] game against the [[1960 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]], he was knocked out by [[Chuck Bednarik]] on a passing play, suffering a severe head injury that led him to retire from football.  However, Gifford returned to the Giants in [[1962 NFL season|1962]], changing positions from [[running back]] to [[wide receiver]] (then known as [[Flanker (American football)|flanker]]). Despite his long layoff and having to learn a new position, he became a star once again. 

His Pro Bowl selections came at three different positions&amp;mdash;[[defensive back]], running back, and wide receiver. He retired again, this time for good, in [[1964 NFL season|1964]], after making the [[1965 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] as a receiver. 

During his 12 seasons with the New York Giants (136 regular season games) Frank Gifford had 3,609 rushing yards and 34 touchdowns in 840 carries, he also had 367 receptions for 5,434 yards and 43 touchdowns. Gifford completed 29 of the 63 passes he threw for 823 yards and 14 touchdowns with 6 interceptions. The 6 interceptions is tied with [[Walter Payton]] for most interceptions thrown by a non-quarterback in NFL history, while the 14 touchdowns is also the most among any non-quarterback in NFL history&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pro-football-reference.com/friv/nonqb.htm &quot;Non-Quarterback Passing: This list only includes players who played during or after the 1960 season&quot;] ''pro-football-reference.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

Gifford once appeared as himself as a guest star on the television series, [[Hazel (TV series)|Hazel]], in the episode, &quot;Hazel and the Halfback&quot;, which originally aired December 26, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0598502/ IMDb.com page referring specific episode] Retrieved 2011-02-28&lt;/ref&gt; In the story, Gifford is interested in investing in a local [[bowling alley]].

Gifford was officially inducted into the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] on July 30, 1977.

Gifford is a Board Member for the [[Lott Trophy|Lott IMPACT Trophy]], which is named after [[Ronnie Lott]] and is given annually to college football's Defensive IMPACT Player of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lottimpacttrophy.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasting career==
After his playing days ended, Gifford became a [[sports commentator|commentator]] mainly for [[NFL on CBS|NFL]] games on [[CBS Sports|CBS]]. His big break came in [[1971 NFL season|1971]] when he replaced [[Keith Jackson]] as [[play-by-play]] announcer on [[ESPN on ABC|ABC]]'s ''[[Monday Night Football]]'', joining [[Howard Cosell]] and [[Don Meredith]], and would continue on as a commentator until [[1997 NFL season|1997]], amid controversy regarding an affair he had with airline stewardess [[Suzen Johnson]]. In [[1998 NFL season|1998]], he was given a reduced role on the pregame show. After that, Gifford left ''Monday Night Football''. During the 1980s, Gifford would fill-in for [[Al Michaels]] (who had replaced Gifford on play-by-play in [[1986 NFL season|1986]]) on play-by-play whenever Michaels went on baseball assignments for the League Championship Series ([[1986 American League Championship Series|1986]] and [[1988 National League Championship Series|1988]]) or World Series ([[1987 World Series|1987]] and [[1989 World Series|1989]]). Gifford was also host of British TV network [[Channel 4]]'s NFL coverage with British born former [[New England Patriots]] kicker [[John Smith (American football)|John Smith]] in 1986-1987.

Gifford also served as a reporter and commentator on other ABC programs, such as their coverage of the [[Olympics on ABC|Olympic Games]] (perhaps most notably, the [[Basketball_at_the_1972_Summer_Olympics#Gold_Medal_Match_controversy|controversial men's basketball Gold Medal Match]] between the [[United States men's national basketball team|United States]] and [[Soviet Union national basketball team|Soviet Union]] at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Rudi-Sedlmayer-Halle|Munich]]), [[skiing]], and [[PGA Tour on ABC|golf]], and has guest hosted ''[[Good Morning America]]'' on occasion. He met his wife Kathie Lee while filling in as ''GMA'' host. In [[1995 NFL season|1995]], he was given the [[Pete Rozelle Award]] by the Pro Football Hall of Fame for his NFL television work.

He also announced [[Evel Knievel]]'s jumps for ABC's ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'' in the 1970s, including when Knievel failed to clear 13 buses at [[Wembley Stadium (1924)|Wembley Stadium]] in 1975.

==Family==
Gifford and his wife, [[television host]] [[Kathie Lee Gifford]], were married on October 18, 1986, and live in [[Greenwich, Connecticut]], with their son and daughter, Cody Newton Gifford (b. March 22, 1990) and Cassidy Erin Gifford (b. August 2, 1993).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Gifford &amp; Richmond, ''The Glory Game'', 2008, p.291&lt;/ref&gt; The couple shares the same birthday, August 16. They appeared together as hosts for the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in [[Calgary]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Gifford and his first wife, Maxine Avis Ewart, have three children, Jeff, Kyle and Victoria, and five grandchildren.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Victoria married [[Michael LeMoyne Kennedy]], a member of the [[Kennedy Family]]. Gifford has an older sister and younger brother, Winona and Waine.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

== Affair ==
In 1997, ''[[The Globe (tabloid)|The Globe]]'' arranged to have Gifford secretly videotaped being seduced by former [[flight attendant]] [[Suzen Johnson]] in a [[New York City]] hotel room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Furse|first=Jane|title=Gifford Fling Bombshell Sleuth: I Was Asked To Tape Tryst|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1997-05-17/news/18028398_1_globe-officials-hotel-room-suzen-johnson|accessdate=August 26, 2012|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=May 17, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; They published photos and stories. [[ESPN]] reported that the tabloid paid Johnson $75,000 to lure Gifford to the room,&lt;ref name=espn/&gt; while ''The Atlantic'' said it was $125,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatlantic.com/issues/99aug/9908tabloids.htm |title=&quot;CREEPING TABLOIDISM!&quot; LAWYER CLAIMS |publisher=The Atlantic Online |date=August 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
