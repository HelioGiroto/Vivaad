==Career==
===1990s===
After sitting for early graduation exams at 16, Ledger left school to pursue an acting career.&lt;ref name=Lipsky/&gt; With Trevor DiCarlo, his best friend since he was three years old, Ledger drove across Australia from Perth to Sydney, returning to Perth to take a small role in ''[[Clowning Around]]'' (1992), the first part of a two-part television series, and to work on the TV series ''[[Sweat (TV series)|Sweat]]'' (1996), in which he played a gay cyclist.&lt;ref name=Wills/&gt; From 1993 to 1997, Ledger also had parts in the Perth television series ''[[Ship to Shore (TV Series)|Ship to Shore]]'' (1993); in the short-lived [[Fox Broadcasting Company]] fantasy-drama ''[[Roar (TV series)|Roar]]'' (1997); in ''[[Home and Away]]'' (1997), one of Australia's most successful television shows; and in the Australian film ''[[Blackrock (film)|Blackrock]]'' (1997), his feature film debut.&lt;ref name=Wills/&gt; In 1999, he starred in the teen comedy ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]'' and in the acclaimed Australian crime film ''[[Two Hands (1999 film)|Two Hands]]'', directed by [[Gregor Jordan]].&lt;ref name=Wills/&gt;

From 2000 to 2005, he starred in supporting roles as Gabriel Martin, the eldest son of Benjamin Martin ([[Mel Gibson]]), in ''[[The Patriot (2000 film)|The Patriot]]'' (2000), and as Sonny Grotowski, the son of Hank Grotowski ([[Billy Bob Thornton]]), in ''[[Monster's Ball]]'' (2000); and in leading or title roles in ''[[A Knight's Tale (film)|A Knight's Tale]]'' (2001), ''[[The Four Feathers (2002 film)|The Four Feathers]]'' (2002), ''[[The Order (2003 film)|The Order]]'' (2003), ''[[Ned Kelly (2003 film)|Ned Kelly]]'' (2003), ''[[Casanova (2005 film)|Casanova]]'' (2005), ''[[The Brothers Grimm (film)|The Brothers Grimm]]'' (2005), and ''[[Lords of Dogtown]]'' (2005).&lt;ref name=filmography/&gt; In 2001, he won a [[National Association of Theatre Owners|ShoWest]] Award as &quot;Male Star of Tomorrow&quot;.&lt;ref name=Showest&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.showest.com/filmexpo/showest/general/past_winners.jsp |title=Showest Awards: Past Award Winners|work=showest.com|publisher=[[National Association of Theatre Owners|ShoWest]] ([[Nielsen Company|Nielsen Business Media Film Group]])|accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ledger received &quot;Best Actor of 2005&quot; awards from both the [[New York Film Critics Circle]] and the [[San Francisco Film Critics Circle]] for his performance in ''[[Brokeback Mountain]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/SHOWBIZ/Movies/12/13/golden.globes/|title='Brokeback Mountain' leads Golden Globe nominations|accessdate=17 July 2008|date=13 December 2005|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sffcc.splicedwire.com/2005awards.html|title=The San Francisco Film Critics Circle|accessdate=17 July 2008|date=12 December 2005|work=San Francisco Film |publisher=splicedwire.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he plays [[Wyoming]] ranch hand [[Ennis Del Mar]], who has a love affair with aspiring rodeo rider [[Jack Twist]], played by [[Jake Gyllenhaal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jen Chaney|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/15/AR2005121500491_pf.html|title='Mountain' Man Ledger's Steady Climb to the Top|work=Washington Post |date=15 December 2005|accessdate=17 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also received a nomination for [[Golden Globe]] Best Actor in a Drama and a nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for this performance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/30863|title=HFPA – Awards Search|work=[[Golden Globes]] Official Website |publisher=goldenglobes.org |accessdate=17 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/DisplayMain.jsp?curTime=1216319365795 |title=Results Page – Academy Awards Database |accessdate=17 July 2008|publisher=Awards Database}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him, at age 26, the [[List of oldest and youngest Academy Award winners and nominees#Youngest nominees 2|ninth-youngest nominee]] for a Best Actor Oscar. In ''[[The New York Times]]'' review of the film, critic [[Stephen Holden]] writes: &quot;Both Mr. Ledger and Mr. Gyllenhaal make this anguished love story physically palpable. Mr. Ledger magically and mysteriously disappears beneath the skin of his lean, sinewy character. It is a great screen performance, as good as the best of [[Marlon Brando]] and [[Sean Penn]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Holden, Stephen|title=Film Review – Brokeback Mountain – Riding the High Country, Finding and Losing Love |url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/2005/12/09/movies/09brok.html |work=The New York Times |page=1 |date=9 December 2005 |accessdate=17 August 2007 |authorlink=Stephen Holden}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a review in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', [[Peter Travers]] states: &quot;Ledger's magnificent performance is an acting miracle. He seems to tear it from his insides. Ledger doesn't just know how Ennis moves, speaks and listens; he knows how he breathes. To see him inhale the scent of a shirt hanging in Jack's closet is to take measure of the pain of love lost.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Travers, Peter|title=Review: Brokeback Mountain |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/6169704/review/8878365/brokeback_mountain |work=Rolling Stone |date=1 December 2005 |accessdate=27 April 2008 |authorlink=Peter Travers}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Brokeback Mountain,'' Ledger costarred with fellow Australian [[Abbie Cornish]] in the 2006 Australian film ''[[Candy (2006 film)|Candy]],'' an adaptation of the 1998 novel ''[[Candy: A Novel of Love and Addiction]],'' as young heroin addicts in love attempting to break free of their addiction, whose mentor is played by [[Geoffrey Rush]]; for his performance as sometime poet Dan, Ledger was nominated for three &quot;Best Actor&quot; awards, including one of the [[Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards 2006|Film Critics Circle of Australia Awards]], which both Cornish and Rush won in their categories. Shortly after the release of ''Candy,'' Ledger was invited to join the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Academy of Motion Picture Arts, Sciences invites 120 new members |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-07-05-academy_x.htm |date=5 July 2006 |work=USA Today |accessdate=23 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of six actors embodying different aspects of the life of [[Bob Dylan]] in the 2007 film ''[[I'm Not There]],'' directed by [[Todd Haynes]], Ledger &quot;won praise for his portrayal of 'Robbie [Clark],' a moody, counter-culture actor who represents the romanticist side of Dylan, but says accolades are never his motivation.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stevens&gt;{{cite news|author=Honie Stevens|title=Squaring the Ledger |url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,22763328-5006011,00.html |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=Australia |date=18 November 2007 |accessdate=24 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Posthumously, on 23 February 2008, he shared the [[Independent Spirit Awards 2007#Robert Altman Award|2007 Independent Spirit Robert Altman Award]] with the rest of the film's ensemble cast, its director, and its casting director.&lt;ref name=Haynes/&gt;

In his next to last film performance, Ledger played the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'', directed by [[Christopher Nolan]], first released, in Australia, on 16 July 2008, nearly six months after his death. While working on the film in London, Ledger told [[Sarah Lyall]], in their ''New York Times'' interview, that he viewed ''The Dark Knight'''s [[The Dark Knight (film)#Cast|Joker]] as a &quot;[[psychopathy|psychopathic]], [[mass murder]]ing, [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] [[clown]] with zero [[empathy]].&quot;&lt;ref name=Lyall&gt;{{cite news |author=Lyall, Sarah |title=Movies: In Stetson or Wig, He's Hard to Pin Down |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/04/movies/moviesspecial/04lyal.html |work=The New York Times  |date=4 November 2007 |accessdate=18 August 2008 |authorlink=Sarah Lyall}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prepare for the role, Ledger told ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'', 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I sat around in a hotel room in London for about a month, locked myself away, formed a little diary and experimented with voices – it was important to try to find a somewhat iconic voice and laugh. I ended up landing more in the realm of a psychopath – someone with very little to no conscience towards his acts&quot;; after reiterating his view of the character as &quot;just an absolute [[Antisocial personality disorder|sociopath]], a cold-blooded, mass-murdering clown&quot;, he added that Nolan had given him &quot;free rein&quot; to create the role, which he found &quot;fun, because there are no real boundaries to what the Joker would say or do. Nothing intimidates him, and everything is a big joke.&quot;&lt;ref name=Jolin1&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dan Jolin|title=Fear Has a Face |url=http://www.empireonline.com/magazine/covers/image.asp?id=24227&amp;gallery=1365&amp;caption=%23223%20%28January%202008%29 |journal=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]] |volume=223 |date=January 2008 |pages=87–88 |accessdate=8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;For his work in ''The Dark Knight,'' Ledger won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], his family accepting it on his behalf, as well as numerous other posthumous awards including the [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture|Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor]], which Christopher Nolan accepted for him.&lt;ref name=accolades/&gt;&lt;ref name=Posthumous/&gt;

At the time of his death, on 22 January 2008, Ledger had completed about half of the work for his final film performance as Tony in [[Terry Gilliam]]'s ''[[The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus]]''.&lt;ref name=Halbfinger&gt;{{cite news |author=David M.

==Health issues==
In their ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' interview, published on 4 November 2007, Ledger told [[Sarah Lyall]] that his recently completed roles in ''[[I'm Not There]]'' (2007) and ''[[The Dark Knight (film)|The Dark Knight]]'' (2008) had taken a toll on his ability to sleep: &quot;Last week I probably slept an average of two hours a night. ...

Prior to his return to New York from his last film assignment, in London, in January 2008, while he was apparently suffering from some kind of [[respiratory illness]], he reportedly complained to his co-star from ''The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus'', [[Christopher Plummer]], that he was continuing to have difficulty sleeping and taking pills to help with that problem: &quot;Confirming earlier reports that Ledger hadn't been feeling well on set, Plummer says, 'we all caught colds because we were shooting outside on horrible, damp nights. But Heath's went on and I don't think he dealt with it immediately with the [[antibiotic]]s.... I think what he did have was the [[Atypical pneumonia|walking pneumonia]].' [...] On top of that, 'He was saying all the time, 'dammit, I can't sleep'... and he was taking all these pills to help him.'&amp;nbsp;&quot;&lt;ref name=Stoynoff/&gt;

In talking with ''[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]]'' magazine after his death Ledger's former fiancée [[Michelle Williams (actress)|Michelle Williams]] also confirmed reports the actor had experienced trouble sleeping. &quot;For as long as I'd known him, he had bouts with insomnia.

At about 2:45&amp;nbsp;p.m. ([[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]), on 22 January 2008, Ledger was found unconscious in his bed by his [[Housekeeper (servant)|housekeeper]], Teresa Solomon, and his [[massage|masseuse]], Diana Wolozin, in his fourth-floor loft apartment at 421 Broome Street in the [[SoHo]] neighborhood of Manhattan.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTBarron/&gt;

According to the police, Wolozin, who had arrived early for a 3:00&amp;nbsp;pm appointment with Ledger, called Ledger's friend, actress [[Mary-Kate Olsen]], for help. Olsen, who was in California, directed a New York City private security guard to go to the scene. At 3:26&amp;nbsp;pm, &quot;[fewer] than 15 minutes after Wolozin first saw him in bed and only a few moments&quot; after first calling Olsen and then calling her a second time to express her fears that Ledger was dead, Wolozin telephoned [[9-1-1]] &quot;to say that Mr. Ledger was not breathing.&quot; At the urging of the 9-1-1 operator, Wolozin administered [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]], which was unsuccessful in reviving him.&lt;ref name=NewmanBaker&gt;{{cite news |author=Andy Newman and Al Baker|title=Autopsy on Actor Is Inconclusive As Calls for Help Are Revealed|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/24/nyregion/24celeb.htm |work=The New York Times |date=24 January 2008|accessdate=18 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autopsy and toxicology report===
After two weeks of intense media speculation about possible causes of Ledger's death, on 6 February 2008, the [[Coroner|Office of the Chief Medical Examiner of New York]] released its conclusions, based on an initial [[autopsy]] of 23 January 2008, and a subsequent complete [[toxicology|toxicological analysis]].&lt;ref name=Chan/&gt;&lt;ref name=CNNLedger&gt;{{cite news |title=Ledger's Death Caused by Accidental Overdose |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Movies/02/06/heath.ledger/index.html |work=SHOWBIZ, Movies|publisher=CNN |date=6 February 2008|accessdate=7 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LKLLedger&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Larry King]]|url=http://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/bestoftv/2008/02/06/lkl.heath.ledger.death.cnn |title=Video: Larry King Live: Ledger Death|work=[[Larry King Live]] |format=[[Video clip]]|publisher=CNN|date=6 February 2008|accessdate=5 February 2008|quote=CNN's Larry King talks to guests about the finding that actor Heath Ledger died from an accidental drug overdose.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report concludes, in part, &quot;Mr. Heath Ledger died as the result of [[Combined drug intoxication|acute intoxication]] by the combined effects of [[oxycodone]], [[hydrocodone]],  [[diazepam]], [[temazepam]], [[alprazolam]] and [[doxylamine]].&quot;&lt;ref name=Chan/&gt;&lt;ref name=APMSNBC/&gt; It states definitively: &quot;We have concluded that the manner of death is accident, resulting from the [[drug abuse|abuse of prescription medications]].&quot;&lt;ref name=Chan/&gt;&lt;ref name=APMSNBC/&gt; While the medications found in the toxicological analysis may be prescribed in the United States for [[insomnia]], [[anxiety]], [[pain]], or [[common cold]] (doxylamine) symptoms, the vast majority of physicians in U.S. are extremely reluctant to prescribe multiple [[benzodiazepine]]s to a single patient e.g. diazepam, alprazolam, and temazepam, let alone prescribe the same to a patient already taking a mix OxyContin and Vicodin.

===Federal investigation===
Late in February 2008, a [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] investigation of medical professionals relating to Ledger's death exonerated two American physicians, who practise in Los Angeles and [[Houston]], of any wrongdoing, determining that &quot;the doctors in question had prescribed Ledger other medications – not the pills that killed him.&quot;&lt;ref name=WENN2&gt;{{cite news|author=WENN (World Entertainment News Network)|title=Heath Ledger Doctors Cleared |url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Heath_Ledger_Doctors_Cleared/5091865|work=Hollywood.com|date=29 February 2008|accessdate=5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Egan&gt;{{cite news |author=Nicole Weisensee Egan|title=Report: Doctors Cleared in Ledger Investigation|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20181179,00.html|work=People|work=People |date=28 February 2008|accessdate=5 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 August 2008, citing unnamed sources, Murray Weiss, of the ''[[New York Post]]'', first reported that [[Mary-Kate Olsen]] had &quot;refused [through her attorney, Michael C. Miller] to be interviewed by federal investigators probing the accidental drug death of her close friend Heath Ledger ... [without] ...

After a flurry of further media speculation, on 6 August 2008, the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. Attorney's Office]] in Manhattan closed its investigation into Ledger's death without filing any charges and rendering [[Mootness|moot]] its [[subpoena]] of Olsen.&lt;ref name=Egan2&gt;{{cite news|author=Nicole Weisensee Egan|title=Source: Feds Officially Close Heath Ledger Investigation|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20217421,00.html|work=People |date=6 August 2008 |accessdate=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AdlerLedger&gt;{{cite news|author=Shawn Adler|title=Heath Ledger Investigation Reportedly Closed; Mary-Kate Olsen Won't Have to Testify: U.S. Attorney's Office Filed No Charges Before Closing Probe into Actor's Overdose Death |url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1592309/story.jhtml|work=MTV|date=6 August 2008|accessdate=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the clearing of the two doctors and Olsen, and the closing of the investigation because the prosecutors in the Manhattan U.S. Attorney's Office &quot;don't believe there's a viable target,&quot; it is still not known how Ledger obtained the [[oxycodone]] and [[hydrocodone]] in the [[Combined drug intoxication|lethal drug combination]] that killed him.&lt;ref name=AdlerLedger/&gt;&lt;ref name=FoxAP&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=Investigation into Heath Ledger's Death Closed|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,399081,00.html|work=Fox News |date=6 August 2008 |accessdate=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking of editing ''The Dark Knight,'' on which Ledger had completed his work in October 2007, Nolan recalled, &quot;It was tremendously emotional, right when he passed, having to go back in and look at him every day. ...
