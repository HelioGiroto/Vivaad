'''Robert Francis '''&quot;'''Bobby'''&quot;''' Kennedy''' (November 20, 1925 – June 6, 1968), also referred to by his initials '''RFK''', was an American politician, a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Senate|senator]] from New York, and a noted [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|civil rights]] activist. An icon of [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]] and member of the [[Kennedy family]], he was a younger brother of [[President John F. Kennedy]] and acted as one of his advisors during his [[President of the United States|presidency]]. From 1961 to 1964, he was the [[U.S. Attorney General]].

Following his brother [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|John's assassination]] on November 22, 1963, Kennedy continued to serve as Attorney General under President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] for nine months. In September 1964, Kennedy resigned to seek the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seat from New York, which he won in November. Within a few years, he publicly split with Johnson over the [[Vietnam War]].

In March [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]], Kennedy began a campaign for the presidency and was a front-running candidate of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. In the California [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary]] on June 4, Kennedy defeated [[Eugene McCarthy]], a U.S. Senator from [[Minnesota]]. Following a brief victory speech delivered just past midnight on June 5 at the [[Ambassador Hotel (Los Angeles)|Ambassador Hotel]] in Los Angeles, [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Kennedy was shot]] by [[Sirhan Sirhan]], a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian Arab]], because Kennedy in a campaign speech promised jet fighters to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kameel B. Nasr|title=Arab and Israeli Terrorism: The Causes and Effects of Political Violence, 1936-1993|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QRXURzwdXS4C&amp;pg=PA49|year= 2007|publisher=McFarland|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortally wounded, he survived for nearly 26 hours, dying early in the morning of June 6.

==Early life, education, and military service==
Kennedy was born on November 20, 1925, in [[Brookline, Massachusetts|Brookline]], Massachusetts, the seventh child of [[Joseph P. Kennedy]] and [[Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy|Rose E. Fitzgerald]].

In September 1927, the [[Kennedy family]] moved to [[Riverdale, New York|Riverdale]], New York, a neighborhood in the [[Bronx]], then two years later, moved {{convert|5|mi|km}} northeast to [[Bronxville, New York|Bronxville]], New York. Kennedy spent summers with his family at their home in [[Hyannis, Massachusetts#Hyannis Port|Hyannis Port]], Massachusetts, and Christmas and Easter holidays with his family at their winter home in [[Palm Beach, Florida|Palm Beach]], Florida, purchased in 1933. He attended public elementary school in Riverdale from kindergarten through second grade; then [[Bronxville Union Free School District|Bronxville School]], the public school in Bronxville, from third through fifth grade, repeating the third grade;&lt;ref name=&quot;oppenheimer307&quot;&gt;Oppenheimer, Jerry. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=pLFNINq53NUC&amp;lpg=PA307&amp;dq=kennedy%20repeated%20third%20grade&amp;pg=PA307#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Other Mrs. Kennedy]'', p. 307.&lt;/ref&gt; then [[Riverdale Country School]], a private school for boys in Riverdale, for sixth grade.

In March 1938, when he was 12, Kennedy sailed aboard the {{SS|Manhattan|1931|6}} with his mother and his four youngest siblings to England, where his father had begun serving as [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom|U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom]]. Kennedy attended the private [[Gibbs School for Boys]] at 134 [[Sloane Street]] in London for seventh grade, returning to the U.S. just before the outbreak of World War II in Europe.

In September 1939, for eighth grade, Kennedy was sent {{convert|200|mi|km}} away from home to [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire),|St. Paul's School]], an elite private [[university-preparatory school|preparatory]] school for boys in [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]], New Hampshire. However, he did not like it and his mother thought it too [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]]. It was for these reasons that—after two months at St. Paul's—Kennedy transferred to [[Portsmouth Abbey School|Portsmouth Priory School]], a [[Benedictine]] boarding school for boys in [[Portsmouth, Rhode Island|Portsmouth]], Rhode Island, for eighth through tenth grades. In September 1942, Kennedy transferred to [[Milton Academy]], a third boarding school in [[Milton, Massachusetts|Milton]], Massachusetts, for eleventh and twelfth grades.

Six weeks before his eighteenth birthday, Kennedy enlisted in the [[United States Navy Reserve|U.S. Naval Reserve]] as an [[Seaman Apprentice|apprentice seaman]], released from active duty until March 1944 when he left Milton Academy early to report to the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] at [[Harvard College]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts. His V-12 training was at Harvard (March–November 1944); [[Bates College]] in [[Lewiston, Maine]] (November 1944 – June 1945); and Harvard (June 1945 – January 1946). On December 15, 1945, the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] commissioned the [[destroyer]] [[USS Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr. (DD-850)|USS ''Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.'']], and shortly thereafter granted Kennedy's request to be released from naval-officer training to serve starting on February 1, 1946, as an apprentice seaman on the ship's [[shakedown cruise]] in the [[Caribbean Sea|Caribbean]]. On May 30, 1946, he received his [[honorable discharge]] from the Navy.

In September 1946, Kennedy entered Harvard as a junior, having received credit for his two and a half years in the V-12 program. Kennedy worked hard to make the Harvard [[varsity team|varsity]] [[American football|football]] team as an [[end (American football)|end]], was a [[starting lineup|starter]] and scored a [[touchdown]] in the first game of his senior year before breaking his leg in practice, earning his [[varsity letter]] when his coach sent him in for the last minutes of the [[Harvard-Yale football games (The Game)|Harvard-Yale game]] wearing a cast. Kennedy graduated from Harvard with a bachelor's degree in [[political science|government]] in March 1948 and immediately sailed off on {{RMS|Queen Mary}} with a college friend for a six-month tour of Europe and the Middle East, accredited as a correspondent of the ''[[Boston Post]]'', for which he filed six stories. Four of these stories, filed from [[Palestine]] shortly before the end of the [[British Mandate of Palestine|British Mandate]], [[Robert F. Kennedy's 1948 visit to Palestine|provided a first-hand view of the tensions]]. He was critical of the British policy in Palestine. Further, he praised the Jewish people he met there &quot;as hardy and tough&quot;. Kennedy held out some hope after seeing Arabs and Jews working side by side but, in the end felt the &quot;hate&quot; in Palestine was too strong and would lead to a war.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger 2002 (reprint), pp. 73–77.&lt;/ref&gt; His prediction came to pass with the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]].

In September 1948, Kennedy enrolled at the [[University of Virginia School of Law]] in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]]. On June 17, 1950, Kennedy married [[Ethel Kennedy|Ethel Skakel]] at St. Mary's Catholic Church in [[Greenwich, Connecticut|Greenwich]], Connecticut. Kennedy graduated from law school in June 1951 and flew with Ethel to Greenwich to stay in his father-in-law's guest house. Kennedy's first child, [[Kathleen Kennedy Townsend|Kathleen]], was born on July 4, 1951, and Kennedy spent the summer studying for the Massachusetts [[bar exam]].

In September 1951, Kennedy went to San Francisco as a correspondent of the ''Boston Post'' to cover the convention concluding the [[Treaty of San Francisco|Treaty of Peace with Japan]]. In October 1951, Kennedy embarked on a seven-week Asian trip with his brother John (then [[Massachusetts's 11th congressional district|Massachusetts 11th district]] [[United States House of Representatives|congressman]]) and his sister [[Patricia Kennedy Lawford|Patricia]] to Israel, India, Vietnam, and Japan. Because of their eight-year separation in age, the two brothers had previously seen little of each other. This {{convert|25000|mi|km|sing=on}} trip was the first extended time they had spent together and served to deepen their relationship.

==Early career until 1960==
In November 1951, Kennedy moved with his wife and daughter to a townhouse in [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]] in Washington, D.C., and started work as a lawyer in the Internal Security Section (which investigated suspected Soviet agents) of the [[United States Department of Justice Criminal Division|Criminal Division]] of the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]]. In February 1952, he was transferred to the [[Eastern District of New York]] in [[Brooklyn]] to prosecute fraud cases. On June 6, 1952, Kennedy resigned to manage his brother John's successful [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1952|1952 U.S. Senate campaign]] in [[Massachusetts]].

In December 1952, at the behest of his father, he was appointed by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[Joe McCarthy]] as assistant counsel of the [[United States Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]].&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (1978) p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned in July 1953, but &quot;[[Joseph McCarthy#Support from Catholics and Kennedy family|retained a fondness for McCarthy]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (1978) p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; After a period as an assistant to his father on the [[Hoover Commission]], Kennedy rejoined the Senate committee staff as chief counsel for the Democratic minority in February 1954.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (1978) p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; When the Democrats gained the majority in January 1955, he became chief counsel. Kennedy was a background figure in the televised [[Army-McCarthy Hearings|McCarthy Hearings]] of 1954 into the conduct of McCarthy.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (1978) p. 113, 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy worked as an aide to [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] during the [[United States presidential election, 1956|1956 presidential election]] to learn for a future national campaign by John. The candidate did not impress Kennedy, however, and he voted for incumbent [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].&lt;ref name=&quot;leamer2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=The Kennedy Men: 1901–1963 | publisher=HarperCollins | author=Leamer, Laurence | year=2001 | isbn=0-688-16315-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|416–417}} Kennedy soon made a name for himself as the chief counsel of the 1957–59 [[United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management|Senate Labor Rackets Committee]] under chairman [[John L. McClellan]]. In a dramatic scene, Kennedy squared off with [[Teamsters]] union President [[Jimmy Hoffa]] during the antagonistic argument that marked Hoffa's testimony.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (1978) pp. 137–91&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy left the Rackets Committee in late 1959 in order to run his brother John's successful presidential campaign.

In 1960, he published the book ''The Enemy Within'', describing the corrupt practices within the Teamsters and other unions that he had helped investigate; the book sold very well.

==Attorney General of the United States (1961–1964)==
[[File:Robert Kennedy CORE rally speech2.jpg|thumb|right|Kennedy speaking to a civil rights crowd in front of the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] on June 14, 1963.]]
John F. Kennedy's choice of Robert Kennedy as Attorney General following his election victory in 1960 was controversial, with ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The New Republic]]'' calling him inexperienced and unqualified.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlesinger&quot;/&gt; He had no experience in any state or federal court,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlesinger&quot;/&gt; causing the President to joke, &quot;I can't see that it's wrong to give him a little legal experience before he goes out to practice law.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;All He Asked&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= New Administration: All He Asked|date=February 3, 1961|work=TIME|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,872026,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was precedent, however, in an Attorney General being appointed because of his role as a close adviser to the President,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlesinger&quot;/&gt; and Kennedy had significant experience in handling organized crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlesinger&quot;/&gt; After performing well in the Senate hearing he easily won confirmation in January 1961.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlesinger&quot;/&gt; To compensate for his deficiencies Kennedy chose an &quot;outstanding&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlesinger&quot;/&gt; group of deputy and assistant attorneys general, including [[Byron White]] and [[Nicholas Katzenbach]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlesinger&quot;/&gt;

{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2012}}&lt;!-- These following 3 paragraphs seem like a cut/paste from a UK source; not (yet) calling this a [[WP:COPYVIO]], due to heavy [[WP:CIRCULAR]] --&gt;

Robert Kennedy's tenure as Attorney General was easily the period of greatest power for the office; no previous United States Attorney General had enjoyed such clear influence on all areas of policy during an administration. To a great extent, President Kennedy sought the advice and counsel of his younger brother, resulting in Robert Kennedy remaining the President's closest political adviser. Kennedy was relied upon as both the President's primary source of administrative information and as a general counsel with whom trust was implicit, given the familial ties of the two men.

President Kennedy once remarked about his brother that, &quot;If I want something done and done immediately I rely on the Attorney General. He is very much the doer in this administration, and has an organizational gift I have rarely if ever seen surpassed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Duncan Watts|title=Dictionary of American Government and Politics|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ul7V4hkVPKQC&amp;pg=PA166|year=2010|publisher=Edinburgh U.P.|page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet Robert Kennedy believed strongly in the [[separation of powers]] and thus would often forward enquiries, which were not directly related to his office, to the President or to an officer of the administration better suited to offer counsel.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

=== Berlin ===
As one of President Kennedy's closest White House advisers, RFK played a crucial role in the events surrounding the [[Berlin Crisis of 1961]].  Operating mainly through a private backchannel connection to Soviet spy [[Georgi Bolshakov]], RFK relayed important diplomatic communications between the US and Soviet governments.  Most significantly, this connection helped the US set up the Vienna Summit in June 1961 and later defuse the tank standoff with the Soviets at Berlin's [[Checkpoint Charlie]] in October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kempe|first=Frederick|title=Berlin 1961|year=2011|publisher=Penguin Group (USA)|isbn=0-399-15729-8|pages=478–479}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organized crime and the Teamsters===
As Attorney General, Kennedy pursued a relentless crusade against [[organized crime]] and the [[American Mafia|mafia]], sometimes disagreeing on strategy with [[J. Edgar Hoover]], Director of the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI). Convictions against organized-crime figures rose by 800 percent during his term.&lt;ref name=jfklib&gt;{{cite web|title=Robert F. Kennedy|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Biographies+and+Profiles/Biographies/bio_kennedy_Robert_F.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy was relentless in his pursuit of [[Teamsters]] union President [[Jimmy Hoffa]], resulting from widespread knowledge of Hoffa's corruption in financial and electoral actions, both personally and organizationally. The enmity between the two men was intense, with accusations of personal vendetta being exchanged between Kennedy and Hoffa. In 1964 Hoffa was imprisoned for jury tampering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dan E. Moldea|title=The Hoffa Wars: The Rise and Fall of Jimmy Hoffa|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LjTUONpZpDIC&amp;pg=PA147|year=1992|publisher=SP Books|page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil rights===

====As Attorney General====
Kennedy expressed the administration's commitment to civil rights during a 1961 speech at the [[University of Georgia Law School]]: {{quote|We will not stand by or be aloof—we will move. I happen to believe that [[Brown v. Board of Education| the 1954 [Supreme Court school desegregation] decision]] was right. But my belief does not matter. It is now the law. Some of you may believe the decision was wrong. That does not matter. It is the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/rfkgeorgialawschool.htm Kennedy, Robert F. &quot;Law Day Address at the University of Georgia Law School&quot;] (speech, University of Georgia, Athens, GA, May 6, 1961), American Rhetoric Online Speech Bank. Accessed May 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1963, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover, who hated civil-rights leader [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and viewed him as an upstart troublemaker,&lt;ref name=&quot;american public radio&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= The FBI's War on King|publisher= American Public Radio|url= http://americanradioworks.publicradio.org/features/king/d1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; presented Kennedy with allegations that some of King's close confidants and advisers were [[Communist#Cold War years|communists]]. Concerned that the allegations, if made public, would derail the Administration's civil rights initiatives, Kennedy warned King to discontinue the suspect associations, and later felt compelled to issue a written directive authorizing the FBI to wiretap King and other leaders of the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]], King's civil rights organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 41&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 41|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of King's phones &quot;on a trial basis, for a month or so&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Herst, Burton (2007). Bobby and J. Edger, Carroll &amp; Graf: New York, New York. ISBN 0-7867-1982-6. p. 372&lt;/ref&gt; Hoover extended the clearance so his men were &quot;unshackled&quot; to look for evidence in any areas of King's life they deemed worthy.&lt;ref&gt;Herst, Burton, (2007) pp 372–374&lt;/ref&gt; The wire tapping continued through June 1966 and was revealed in 1968, days before Kennedy's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;the atlantic&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= The FBI and Martin Luther King|last= Garrow|first= David J.|authorlink= David Garrow|date= 2002-07/08|publisher= The Atlantic Monthly|url= http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200207/garrow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy remained committed to civil rights enforcement to such a degree that he commented, in 1962, that it seemed to envelop almost every area of his public and private life—from prosecuting corrupt southern electoral officials to answering late night calls from [[Coretta Scott King]] concerning the imprisonment of her husband for demonstrations in Alabama. During his tenure as Attorney General, he undertook the most energetic and persistent desegregation of the administration that Capitol Hill had ever experienced. He demanded that every area of government begin recruiting realistic levels of black and other ethnic workers, going so far as to criticize Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] for his failure to desegregate his own office staff.

Although it has become commonplace to assert the phrase &quot;[[Presidency of John F. Kennedy|The Kennedy Administration]]&quot; or even &quot;President Kennedy&quot; when discussing the legislative and executive support of the civil rights movement, between 1960 and 1963, a great many of the initiatives that occurred during President Kennedy's tenure were as a result of the passion and determination of an emboldened Robert Kennedy, who through his rapid education in the realities of Southern racism, underwent a thorough conversion of purpose as Attorney General. Asked in an interview in May 1962, &quot;What do you see as the big problem ahead for you, is it Crime or Internal Security?&quot; Robert Kennedy replied, &quot;Civil Rights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bob Spivack, Interview of the Attorney General, May 12, 1962; published in &quot;Robert Kennedy and His Times,&quot; by Arthur M.

Robert Kennedy played a large role in the Freedom Riders protests. Kennedy acted after the Anniston bus bombings to protect the Riders in continuing their journey. Kennedy sent John Seigenthaler, his administrative assistant, to Alabama to attempt to secure the riders' safety there. He also forced the Greyhound bus company to provide the Freedom Riders with a bus driver to ensure they could continue their journey.&lt;ref&gt;Rucker, Walter, Upton James (2007). Encyclopedia of American Race Riots. Greenwood Publishing Press, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, during the attack and burning by a white mob of the First Baptist Church in Montgomery Alabama, at which Martin Luther King Jr. and some 1,500 sympathizers were in attendance, the Attorney General telephoned King to ask his assurance that they would not leave the building until the force of [[United States Marshals Service|U.S. Marshals]] and [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] he sent had secured the area. King proceeded to berate Kennedy for &quot;allowing the situation to continue&quot;. King later publicly thanked Robert Kennedy for his commanding of the force dispatched to break up an attack that might otherwise have ended King's life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlesinger&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ayers, Edward. Gould, Lewis. Oshinsky, David. (2008). American Passages: A History of the United States: Since 1865, Vol. 2, Cengage Learning, p. 853.&lt;/ref&gt;
    
Kennedy then negotiated the safe passage of the Freedom Riders from the First Baptist Church to Jackson Mississippi, where they were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Arsenault, Raymond (2006). Freedom Riders: 1961 and the Struggle for Racial Justice. Oxford UP. ISBN 978-0-19-513674-6.&lt;/ref&gt; He offered to bail the Freedom Riders out of jail, but they refused. This upset Kennedy, who went as far to call any bandwagoners of the original freedom rides &quot;honkers&quot;.

Kennedy's attempts to end the Freedom Rides early were in many ways tied to an upcoming summit with Khrushchev and De Gaulle, believing the continued international publicity of race riots would tarnish the President heading into international negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, Arthur (2002). Robert Kennedy and His Times, Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt; This reluctance to protect and advance the Freedom Rides alienated many of the Civil Rights leaders at the time who perceived him as intolerant and narrow minded.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Evan (2002). Robert Kennedy: His Life, Simon and Schuster, p. 298.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1962, he sent U.S. Marshals to [[Oxford, Mississippi]], to enforce a federal court order allowing the admittance of the first African American student, [[James Meredith]], to the [[University of Mississippi]]. Kennedy had hoped that legal means, along with the escort of U.S. Marshals, would be enough to force the Governor to allow the school admission. He also was very concerned there might be a &quot;mini-civil war&quot; between the U.S. Army troops and armed protesters.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger 2002 (reprint), pp. 317–320.&lt;/ref&gt; President John F. Kennedy reluctantly sent federal troops after the situation on campus turned violent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Bryant |first= Nick |year= 2006 |month= Autumn |title= Black Man Who Was Crazy Enough to Apply to Ole Miss |journal= [[The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education]] |issue= 53 |page= 71 |url= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ensuing [[Ole Miss riot of 1962|riots]] during the period of Meredith's admittance resulted in hundreds of injuries and two deaths. Yet Kennedy remained adamant concerning the rights of black students to enjoy the benefits of all levels of the educational system. The Office of Civil Rights also hired its first African-American lawyer and began to work cautiously with leaders of the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|civil rights movement]]. Robert Kennedy saw voting as the key to racial justice, and collaborated with Presidents Kennedy and Johnson to create the landmark [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which helped bring an end to [[Jim Crow laws]].

====As U.S. senator and presidential candidate====
He was to maintain his commitment to racial equality into his own presidential campaign, extending his firm sense of social justice to all areas of national life and into matters of foreign and economic policy. During a speech at [[Ball State University]] in [[Muncie, Indiana]] on April 4, 1968, Kennedy questioned the student body on what kind of life America wished for herself; whether privileged Americans had earned the great luxury they enjoyed and whether such Americans had an obligation to those, in U.S. society and across the world, who had so little by comparison. It has been argued that although this speech has been largely overlooked and ignored, because of the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr, it was one of most powerful and heartfelt speeches Kennedy delivered.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Thurston (2008). The last campaign: Robert F. Kennedy and 82 days that inspired America. New York: Henry Holt and Company. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the assassination of President Kennedy, Robert Kennedy undertook a 1966 tour of South Africa in which he championed the cause of the anti-[[apartheid]] movement. The tour was greeted with international praise at a time when few politicians dared to entangle themselves in the politics of South Africa. Kennedy spoke out against the oppression of the native population and was welcomed by the black population as though a visiting head of state. In an interview with ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look Magazine]]'' he had this to say:

{{quote|At the [[University of Natal]] in [[Durban]], I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve. 'But suppose God is black', I replied. 'What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?' There was no answer. Only silence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfksa.org/magazines/magazine.php?id=6 Ripple of Hope in the Land of Apartheid: Robert Kennedy in South Africa, June 1966]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In South Africa, a group of foreign press representatives chartered an aircraft, after the [[National Union of South African Students]] failed to make sufficient travel arrangements. Kennedy not only accommodated a suspected [[Special Branch]] policeman on board, but took with good grace the discovery that the aircraft had once belonged to [[Fidel Castro]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Flying with Bobby K&quot;, [[Empire (SA magazine)|''Empire'']] volume 1, issue 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil liberties===
Kennedy also used the power of federal agencies to influence [[U.S. Steel]] not to institute a price increase.&lt;ref name=&quot;time steel&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Smiting the Foe|date=April 20, 1962|work=TIME|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,873526-3,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote that the administration had set prices of steel &quot;by naked power, by threats, by agents of the state security police.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jfk bio&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= John F.

===Death penalty issues===
During the John F. Kennedy administration, the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] carried out its last pre-[[Furman v. Georgia|''Furman'']] federal execution ([[Victor Feguer]] in [[Iowa]], 1963)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.bestweb.net/~rg/execution/DATA%20FEDERAL.htm |title=Federal Executions, 1790 to 1963 |accessdate=May 5, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Robert Kennedy, as Attorney General, represented the Government in this case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/feguer3.html The Smoking Gun: Archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Kennedy expressed his strong willingness to support a bill then under consideration for the abolition of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/Robert+F.+Kennedy+Miscellaneous+Information.htm|date=January 17, 2006|accessdate=May 3, 2009|title=Robert F. Kennedy Miscellaneous Information|publisher=[[John F. Kennedy Presidential Library]]|author=Parise, Theresa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuba===
As his brother's confidant, Kennedy oversaw the CIA's anti-[[Fidel Castro|Castro]] activities after the failed [[Bay of Pigs invasion]]. He also helped develop the strategy to blockade Cuba during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] instead of initiating a military strike that might have led to nuclear war. Kennedy had initially been among the more hawkish elements of the administration on matters concerning Cuban insurrectionary aid. His initial strong support for covert actions in Cuba soon changed to a position of removal from further involvement once he became aware of the CIA's tendency to draw out initiatives and provide itself with almost unchecked authority in matters of foreign covert operations.

Allegations that the Kennedys knew of plans by the CIA to kill [[Fidel Castro]], or approved of such plans, have been debated by historians over the years. John F. Kennedy's friend and associate, historian [[Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr.]], for example, expressed the opinion that operatives linked to the CIA were among the most reckless individuals to have operated during the period—providing themselves with unscrutinized freedoms to threaten the lives of Castro and other members of the Cuban revolutionary government regardless of the legislative apparatus in Washington—freedoms that, unbeknownst to those at the White House attempting to prevent a nuclear war, placed the entire U.S.–Soviet relationship in perilous danger.

The &quot;[[Family Jewels (Central Intelligence Agency)|Family Jewels]]&quot; documents, declassified by the CIA in 2007, suggest that before the Bay of Pigs invasion Robert Kennedy personally authorized one such assassination attempt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/family_jewels_wh2.pdf January 4, 1975, memorandum of conversation] between President [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Henry Kissinger]], made available by the [[National Security Archive]], June 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/06/23/wcia123.xml CIA's 'family jewels' on show], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', June 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
However, ample evidence exists disputing that fact, specifically that Robert Kennedy was only informed of an earlier plot involving CIA's use of [[Mafia]] bosses [[Santo Trafficante, Jr.]] and [[John Roselli]] during a briefing on May 7, 1962, and in fact directed the CIA to halt any existing efforts directed at Castro's assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger 2002 (reprint), pp. 493–494.&lt;/ref&gt; Concurrently, Kennedy served as his brother's personal representative in [[Operation Mongoose]], the post-Bay of Pigs covert operations program established in November 1961 by President Kennedy. Mongoose was meant to incite a revolution within Cuba that would result in the downfall of Castro, not Castro's assassination.

During the Cuban Missile Crisis Kennedy proved himself to be a gifted politician, with an ability to obtain compromises tempering aggressive positions of key figures in the hawk camp. The trust the President placed in him on matters of negotiation was such that Robert Kennedy's role in the crisis is today seen as having been of vital importance in securing a blockade, which averted a full military engagement between the United States and Soviet Russia. His clandestine meetings with members of the Soviet government continued to provide a key link to [[Nikita Khrushchev]] during even the darkest moments of the Crisis, in which the threat of nuclear strikes was considered a very present reality.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, &quot;The Cuban Connection&quot;, Robert Kennedy and His Times&lt;/ref&gt;

On the last night of the Cuban Missile Crisis, President Kennedy was so grateful for his brother's work in averting nuclear war that he summed it up by saying, &quot;Thank God for Bobby&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1316/is_10_32/ai_66495286 Clarity Through Complexity], October 2000, [http://findarticles.com FindArticles.com], Retrieved 2007-6-10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination of his brother, President John F. Kennedy==
[[File:JFK's family leaves Capitol after his funeral, 1963.jpg|thumb|Robert Kennedy at the funeral of John F. Kennedy, November 25, 1963.]]
The [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President Kennedy]] on November 22, 1963, was a brutal shock to the world, the nation and, of course, Robert and the rest of the Kennedy family. Robert was absolutely devastated, and was described by many as being a completely different man after his brother's death.

In the days following the assassination, Kennedy wrote letters to his two eldest children, Kathleen and Joseph II, saying that as the oldest Kennedy family members of their generation, they had a special responsibility to remember what their uncle had started and to love and serve their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Make Gentle the Life of This World: The Vision of Robert F.

Kennedy was asked by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] leaders to introduce a film about his late brother John F. Kennedy at [[1964 Democratic National Convention|the 1964 party convention]]. When he was introduced, the crowd—including party bosses, elected officials and delegates—applauded thunderously and tearfully for a full 22 minutes before they would let him speak.&lt;ref&gt;Grubin, David. ''RFK''. American Experience, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; He was close to breaking down before he spoke about his brother's vision for both the party and the nation, and recited a quote from Shakespeare's ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' (3.2) that Jacqueline Kennedy had given him:
{{cquote|[...] and when [he] shall die&lt;br/&gt;Take him and cut him out in little stars,&lt;br/&gt;And he will make the face of heaven so fine&lt;br/&gt;That all the world will be in love with night&lt;br/&gt;And pay no worship to the garish sun.}}

==Senator from New York==

{{See also|United States Senate election in New York, 1964}}
Nine months after President John F. Kennedy's assassination, Robert Kennedy left the Cabinet to run for a seat in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]], representing New York.

President Johnson and Robert Kennedy were often at severe odds with each other, both politically and personally, yet Johnson gave considerable support to Robert Kennedy's campaign, as he was later to recall in his memoir of the [[White House]] years.

His opponent in the [[United States Senate election, 1964|1964 race]] was [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] incumbent [[Kenneth Keating]], who attempted to portray Kennedy as an arrogant [[carpetbagger]]. Kennedy emerged victorious in the November election, helped in part by Johnson's huge victory margin in New York.

In 1965 Robert Kennedy became the first person to summit [[Mount Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=jfklib/&gt; At the time it was the highest mountain in Canada that had not yet been climbed. It was named in honor of his brother John Kennedy after his assassination.

In June 1966, Kennedy visited [[History of South Africa in the apartheid era|apartheid-ruled South Africa]] accompanied by his wife, [[Ethel Kennedy]], and a small number of aides. At the [[University of Cape Town]] he [[Day of Affirmation speech|delivered the Annual Day of Affirmation speech]]. A quote from this address appears on his memorial at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]. (&quot;Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope....&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfksa.org/contents/overview.php Robert F. Kennedy in South Africa.org—Overview]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Immigration Bill Signing - A1421-33a - 10-03-1965.jpg|thumb|President Lyndon B. Johnson signs the [[Immigration Act of 1965]] as Sen. Edward Kennedy, Sen. Robert Kennedy, and others look on.]]
During his years as a senator, Kennedy also helped to start a successful redevelopment project in poverty-stricken [[Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn]] in New York City, visited the [[Mississippi Delta]] as a member of the Senate committee reviewing the effectiveness of 'War on Poverty' programs and, reversing his prior stance, called for a halt in further escalation of the [[Vietnam War]].

As Senator, Kennedy endeared himself to African Americans, and other minorities such as Native Americans and immigrant groups. He spoke forcefully in favor of what he called the &quot;disaffected,&quot; the impoverished, and &quot;the excluded,&quot; thereby aligning himself with leaders of the civil rights struggle and social justice campaigners, leading the Democratic party in a pursuit of a more aggressive agenda to eliminate perceived discrimination on all levels. Kennedy supported [[desegregation busing]], integration of all public facilities, the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]] and anti-poverty social programs to increase education, offer opportunities for employment, and provide health care for African-Americans.

The administration of President Kennedy had backed U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world in the frame of the Cold War. While Robert Kennedy vigorously supported President Kennedy's earlier efforts, like his brother he never publicly advocated commitment of ground troops. Senator Kennedy had cautioned President Johnson against commitment of U.S. ground troops as early as 1965, but Lyndon Johnson chose to commit ground troops on recommendation of the rest of President Kennedy's still intact staff of advisers. Robert Kennedy did not strongly advocate withdrawal from Vietnam until 1967, within a week of Martin Luther King taking the same public stand. Consistent with President Kennedy's [[Alliance for Progress]], Robert Kennedy placed increasing emphasis on human rights as a central focus of U.S. foreign policy.

==Presidential candidate==

[[File:RWRMay1968RFKspeaksm.jpg|thumb|right|Tired, but still intense in the last days before his Oregon defeat, Robert Kennedy speaks from the platform of a campaign train.]]
In 1968, President Johnson began to run for reelection. In January 1968, faced with what was widely considered an unrealistic race against an incumbent President, Senator Kennedy stated he would not seek the presidency. After the [[Tet Offensive]] in Vietnam, in early February 1968, Kennedy received a letter from writer [[Pete Hamill]] that said that poor people kept pictures of President Kennedy on their walls and that Robert Kennedy had an &quot;obligation of staying true to whatever it was that put those pictures on those walls&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger (1978) p. 845&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy traveled to California, to meet with civil rights activist [[César Chávez]] who was on a hunger strike. The weekend before the New Hampshire primary, Kennedy announced to several aides that he would attempt to persuade little-known Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] of [[Minnesota]] to withdraw from the presidential race. Johnson won a narrow victory in the New Hampshire primary on March 12, 1968, against McCarthy, which boosted McCarthy's standing in the race.

After much speculation and reports leaking out about his plans,&lt;ref name=&quot;decides&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10911F83E541A7493C4A81788D85F4C8685F9 | title=Kennedy decides to run; will discuss plans today| location=paid archive| last=Witkin|first=Richard|date=March 16, 1968|work=The New York Times|pages=1, 14|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seeing in McCarthy's success that Johnson's hold on the job was not as strong as originally thought, Kennedy declared his candidacy on March 16, 1968, in the Caucus Room of the old Senate office building—the same room where his brother declared his own candidacy eight years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;caucus&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB071EF73F541B7B93C5A81788D85F4C8685F9 |title=SCENE IS THE SAME, BUT 8 YEARS LATER; Kennedy Brothers Declared for Race In Same Room |last=HERBERS |first=JOHN |date= March 17, 1968|work=The New York Times | location=paid archive| pages=68 |accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated, &quot;I do not run for the Presidency merely to oppose any man, but to propose new policies. I run because I am convinced that this country is on a perilous course and because I have such strong feelings about what must be done, and I feel that I'm obliged to do all I can.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;announcement&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F4071EF73F541B7B93C5A81788D85F4C8685F9 |title=Kennedy's Statement and Excerpts From News Conference|last=Kennedy | first=Robert F. | date=March 16, 1968|work=The New York Times | location=paid archive| pages=68 | accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCarthy supporters angrily denounced Kennedy as an opportunist, and thus the anti-war movement was split between McCarthy and Kennedy. On March 31, 1968, Johnson stunned the nation by dropping out of the race. Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]], long a champion of labor unions and civil rights, entered the race with the support of the party &quot;establishment&quot;, including most members of Congress, mayors, governors and labor unions. He entered the race too late to enter any primaries, but had the support of the president and many Democratic insiders. Robert Kennedy, like his brother before him, planned to win the nomination through popular support in the primaries.

Kennedy stood on a platform of racial and economic justice, non-aggression in foreign policy, decentralization of power and social improvement. A crucial element to his campaign was an engagement with the young, whom he identified as being the future of a reinvigorated American society based on partnership and equality. A good idea of his proposals come from the following extract of a speech given at the University of Kansas.

{{cquote|If we believe that we, as Americans, are bound together by a common concern for each other, then an urgent national priority is upon us. We must begin to end the disgrace of this other America. And this is one of the great tasks of leadership for us, as individuals and citizens this year. But even if we act to erase material poverty, there is another greater task, it is to confront the poverty of satisfaction—purpose and dignity—that afflicts us all. Too much and for too long, we seemed to have surrendered personal excellence and community values in the mere accumulation of material things. Our [[Gross National Product]], now, is over $800 billion dollars a year, but that Gross National Product—if we judge the United States of America by that—that Gross National Product counts air pollution and cigarette advertising, and ambulances to clear our highways of carnage. It counts special locks for our doors and the jails for the people who break them. It counts the destruction of the redwood and the loss of our natural wonder in chaotic sprawl. It counts napalm and counts nuclear warheads and armored cars for the police to fight the riots in our cities. It counts [[Charles Whitman|Whitman]]'s rifle and [[Richard Speck|Speck]]'s knife, and the television programs that glorify violence in order to sell toys to our children. Yet the gross national product does not allow for the health of our children, the quality of their education or the joy of their play. It does not include the beauty of our poetry or the strength of our marriages, the intelligence of our public debate or the integrity of our public officials. It measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country, it measures everything in short, except that which makes life worthwhile. And it can tell us everything about America except why we are proud that we are Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/Speeches/RFK/RFKSpeech68Mar18UKansas.htm Remarks of Robert F. Kennedy at the University of Kansas], March 18, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kennedy's policy objectives did not sit well with the business world, in which he was viewed as something of a fiscal liability, opposed as they were to the tax increases necessary to fund such programs of social improvement. At one of his university speeches (Indiana University Medical School) he was asked, &quot;Where are we going to get the money to pay for all these new programs you're proposing?&quot; Kennedy replied to the medical students, about to enter lucrative careers, &quot;From you.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlesinger&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Newfield, Jack. (1969;1988). Robert Kennedy: A Memoir. Plume&lt;/ref&gt; It was this intense and frank mode of dialogue with which Kennedy was to continue to engage those whom he viewed as not being traditional allies of Democratic ideals or initiatives. He aroused rabid animosity in some quarters, with J. Edgar Hoover's Deputy [[Clyde Tolson]] reported as saying, &quot;I hope that someone shoots and kills the son of a bitch.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Clyde Tolson, qu. in: Thurston Clarke, 'The Last Good Campaign', Vanity Fair, No. 574, June, 2008, p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rkennedy01.jpg|thumb|left|190px|Robert Kennedy campaigns in Los Angeles (photo by [[Evan Freed]])]]
It has been widely commented that Robert Kennedy's campaign for the American presidency far outstripped, in its vision of social improvement, that of President Kennedy; Robert Kennedy's bid for the presidency saw not only a continuation of the programs he and his brother had undertaken during the President's term in office, but also an extension of these programs through what Robert Kennedy viewed as an honest questioning of the historic progress that had been made by President Johnson in the 5 years of his presidency. Kennedy openly challenged young people who supported the war while benefiting from draft deferments, visited numerous small towns, and made himself available to the masses by participating in long motorcades and street-corner stump speeches (often in troubled inner-cities). Kennedy made urban poverty a chief concern of his campaign, which in part led to enormous crowds that would attend his events in poor urban areas or rural parts of [[Appalachia]].

==Personal life==
{{See also|Kennedy family}}

===Family===
[[File:Kennedy bros.jpg|thumb|right|The Kennedy brothers: [[John F. Kennedy|John (Jack)]], Robert (Bobby) and [[Ted Kennedy|Edward (Ted)]]]]
In 1950, he married [[Ethel Skakel Kennedy|Ethel Skakel]]. Together, they had eleven children:
#[[Kathleen Kennedy Townsend|Kathleen Hartington]] (b.1951)
#[[Joseph Patrick Kennedy II|Joseph Patrick II]] (b.1952)
#[[Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.|Robert Francis, Jr.]] (b.1954)
#[[David Kennedy|David Anthony]] (1955–1984)
#[[Courtney Kennedy Hill|Mary Courtney]] (b.1956)
#[[Michael LeMoyne Kennedy|Michael LeMoyne]] (1958–1997)
#[[Kerry Kennedy|Mary Kerry]] (b.1959)
#[[Christopher G. Kennedy|Christopher George]] (b.1963)
#[[Max Kennedy|Matthew Maxwell Taylor]] (b.1965)
#[[Douglas Harriman Kennedy|Douglas Harriman]] (b.1967)
#[[Rory Kennedy|Rory Elizabeth Katherine]] (b.1968)
The last child, Rory, was born six months after her father's assassination.

Kennedy owned a home at the well-known [[Kennedy Compound]] on [[Cape Cod]] in [[Hyannis Port]], but spent most of his time at his estate in [[McLean, Virginia|McLean]], Virginia, known as [[Hickory Hill (McLean, Virginia)|Hickory Hill]], located west of Washington, D.C. His widow Ethel and their children continued to live at Hickory Hill after his death. She now lives full-time at the Hyannis Port home.

===Attitudes and approach===
Despite the fact that his father's most ambitious dreams centered around his older brothers,&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlesinger&quot;/&gt; Robert maintained the code of personal loyalty that seemed to infuse the life of the Kennedy family as a whole. His competitiveness was admired by his father and elder brothers, while his loyalty bound them more affectionately close. A rather timid child, Robert was often the target of his father's dominating temperament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlesinger&quot;/&gt;

Working on the campaigns of John Kennedy, Robert was more involved, passionate and tenacious than the candidate himself, obsessed with every detail, fighting out every battle and taking workers to task. Robert had, all his life, been closer to older brother John than the other members of the Kennedy family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlesinger&quot;/&gt;

RFK's opponents on Capitol Hill maintained that his collegiate magnanimity was sometimes hindered by a tenacious and somewhat impatient manner. His professional life was dominated by the selfsame attitudes that governed his family life—a certainty that good humor and leisure must be balanced by service and accomplishment. Schlesinger comments that Kennedy could be both the most ruthlessly diligent and yet generously adaptable of politicians—at once both temperamental and yet forgiving. In this, Kennedy was very much his father's son; lacking truly lasting emotional independence and yet possessing a great desire to contribute. He lacked the innate self-confidence of his contemporaries and yet found a greater self-assurance in the experience of married life, an experience that he stated had given him a base of self-belief from which to continue his efforts in the public arena.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlesinger&quot;/&gt;

Upon hearing yet again the assertion that he was &quot;ruthless&quot;, Kennedy once joked to a reporter, &quot;If I find out who has called me ruthless I will destroy him.&quot; And yet he also openly confessed to possessing a bad temper that required self-control: &quot;My biggest problem as counsel, is to keep my temper. I think we all feel that when a witness comes before the United States Senate he has an obligation to speak frankly and tell the truth. To see people sit in front of us and lie and evade makes me boil inside. But you can't lose your temper—if you do, the witness has gotten the best of you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious faith===
Central to Kennedy's politics and personal attitude to life and its purpose was his Catholicism, which he inherited from his family. Throughout his life, Kennedy made reference to his faith, how it informed every area of his life, and how it gave him the strength to re-enter politics following the assassination of his elder brother. His was not an unresponsive and staid faith, but the faith of a Catholic Radical—perhaps the first successful Catholic Radical in American political history.&lt;ref&gt;Schlesinger, p. 191 Cf. Murray Kempton, The Progressive, Sept 1960.&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Kennedy was easily the most religious of his brothers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlesinger&quot;/&gt; Whereas John maintained an aloof sense of his faith, Robert approached his duties with a Catholic [[worldview]]. In the last years of his life, he found great solace in the metaphysical poets of ancient Greece, especially the writings of [[Aeschylus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlesinger&quot;/&gt; In his Indianapolis speech on April 4, 1968, following the assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr., Kennedy misquoted&lt;ref&gt;[http://morec.com/rfk.htm RFK's version compared to 2 by [[Edith Hamilton]] ]&lt;/ref&gt; these lines from Aeschylus:

Numerous roads, public schools and other facilities across the United States were named in memory of Robert F. Kennedy in the months and years after his death. The [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Center for Human Rights|Robert F. Kennedy Memorial organization]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfkmemorial.org/home/ RFK Memorial]&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1968, with an international award program to recognize human rights activists. It is now known as the [[Robert F. Kennedy Center for Justice and Human Rights]]. In a further effort to not just remember the late Senator, but continue his work helping disadvantaged, a small group of private citizens launched the Robert F. Kennedy Children's Action Corps in 1969, which today helps more than 800 abused and neglected children each year. A bust of Kennedy resides in the library of the University of Virginia School of Law, from where he obtained his law degree.

On June 4, 2008, on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the assassination of Kennedy, the New York State Assembly voted to rename the [[Robert F. Kennedy Bridge|Triborough Bridge]] in New York City the [[Robert F. Kennedy Bridge|Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Bridge]] in honor of the former New York Senator.

Several public institutions jointly honor Robert F. Kennedy and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]

*In 1969, the former Woodrow Wilson Junior College, a two-year institution and a constituent campus of the [[City Colleges of Chicago]], was renamed [[Kennedy–King College]].

*In 1994, the City of Indianapolis erected the [[Landmark for Peace Memorial]] in Kennedy's honor near the space made famous by his oration from the back of a pickup truck the night King died. The monument in Martin Luther King, Jr. Memorial Park depicts a sculpture of Kennedy reaching out from a large metal slab to a sculpture of King, who is part of a similar slab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Landmark for Peace: A tribute to Dr. Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy|url=http://www.in.gov/visitindiana/blog/index.php/2011/01/14/landmark-for-peace-a-tribute-to-dr-martin-luther-king-and-robert-kennedy/|date=January 14, 2011|last=Nwiltrout|publisher=Indiana Office of Tourism Development|accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is meant to symbolize their attempts in life to bridge the gaps between the races—an attempt that united them even in death.

==Quotations==
*&quot;Only those who dare to fail greatly can ever achieve greatly.&quot;&lt;ref name=jfklib/&gt;
*&quot;Few men are willing to brave the disapproval of their fellows, the censure of their colleagues, the wrath of society. Moral courage is a rarer commodity than bravery in battle or great intelligence. Yet it is the one essential, vital, quality for those who seek to change a world which yields most painfully to change.&quot;{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}
*&quot;The sharpest criticism often goes hand in hand with the deepest idealism and love of country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Address, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, February 24, 1967, [http://www.jfklibrary.org/Historical+Resources/Archives/Reference+Desk/Quotations+of+Robert+F.+Kennedy.htm JFK Library] Quotations of Robert F. Kennedy&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;Men without hope, resigned to despair and oppression, do not make revolutions. It is when expectation replaces submission, when despair is touched with the awareness of possibility, that the forces of human desire and the passion for justice are unloosed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Berkeley, October 22, 1966)&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;There are those who look at things the way they are, and ask why... I dream of things that never were and ask why not.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;(Robert F. Kennedy paraphrasing Irish playwright [[George Bernard Shaw]])&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;Few will have the greatness to bend history; but each of us can work to change a small portion of events, and in the total of all those acts will be written the history of this generation ... It is from numberless diverse acts of courage and belief that human history is thus shaped. Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and crossing each other from a million different centers of energy and daring, those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert F.

*&quot;At the University of Natal in Durban, I was told the church to which most of the white population belongs teaches apartheid as a moral necessity. A questioner declared that few churches allow black Africans to pray with the white because the Bible says that is the way it should be, because God created Negroes to serve. &quot;But suppose God is black&quot;, I replied. &quot;What if we go to Heaven and we, all our lives, have treated the Negro as an inferior, and God is there, and we look up and He is not white? What then is our response?&quot; There was no answer. Only silence.&quot; South Africa, June 1966&lt;ref&gt;(Article for LOOK Magazine following visit to South Africa, 1966) [http://www.rfksa.org/magazines/magazine.php?id=6 Ripple of Hope in the Land of Apartheid: Robert Kennedy in South Africa, June 1966]&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;What we need in the United States is not division; what we need in the United States is not hatred; what we need in the United States is not violence and lawlessness, but is love, and wisdom, and compassion toward one another, and a feeling of justice toward those who still suffer within our country, whether they be white or whether they be black.&quot; Indianapolis, Indiana, April 4, 1968, announcing to the crowd that Martin Luther King Jr. had been assassinated.&lt;ref&gt;Boomhower, p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt;

*&quot;Laws can embody standards; governments can enforce laws—but the final task is not a task for government. It is a task for each and every one of us. Every time we turn our heads the other way when we see the law flouted—when we tolerate what we know to be wrong—when we close our eyes and ears to the corrupt because we are too busy, or too frightened—when we fail to speak up and speak out—we strike a blow against freedom and decency and justice.&quot; June 21, 1961&lt;ref&gt;(Robert F. Kennedy, attorney general, remarks before the Joint Defense Appeal of the American Jewish Committee and the Anti-Defamation League of the B'nai B'rith, Chicago, Illinois)&lt;/ref&gt;
*&quot;...We must recognize the full human equality of all our people-before God, before the law, and in the councils of government. We must do this, not because it is economically advantageous-although it is; not because the laws of God and man command it-although they do command it; not because people in other lands wish it so. We must do it for the single and fundamental reason that it is the right thing to do.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rfkcenter.org/lifeandvision/selectedquotes (Address, Day of Affirmation, University of Cape Town, June 6, 1966)]&lt;/ref&gt;
