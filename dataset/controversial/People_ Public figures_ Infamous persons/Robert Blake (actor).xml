'''Robert Blake''' (born 18 September 1933), is an American actor most known for starring in the film ''[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/04/movies/04bmovi.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title='In Cold Blood'|author=Scott, A.

In 2005, Blake was [[Trial (law)#Criminal_trial|tried]] and [[acquittal|acquitted]] of the 2001 murder of his wife,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/05/national/05blake.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Actor's Trial, Complete With Pulp Novel Characters, Draws to a Close|author=LeDuff, Charles|date=2005-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/03/17/national/17blake.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|title='Baretta' Star Acquitted of Murder in Wife's Death|author=LeDuff, Charles|date=2005-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on 18 November 2005, Blake was found liable in a [[California]] civil court for her wrongful death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/19/national/19blake.html?fta=y|work=[[The New York Times]]|title=Actor Is Ordered to Pay $30 Million in Killing|date=2005-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Blake was born Michael James Vincenzo Gubitosi in [[Nutley, New Jersey]]. His mother, Elizabeth Cafone (b. 1910), was married to Giacomo (James) Gubitosi (1906–1956), however according to Blake in an interview with [[Piers Morgan]], his biological father was actually Giacomo's brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmorgt&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Robert Blake Interview|date=July 11, 2012|work=Piers Morgan Tonight|publisher=CNN|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, he said his parents were cold and distant towards him, and that his mother had actually attempted to abort him unsuccessfully in the same manner she had terminated two prior pregnancies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmorgt&quot;/&gt; He had two elder siblings, brother James Gubitosi (1930–1995) and sister Giovanna Gubitosi (1932–1985).

His father was born in [[Italy]], arriving in the United States in 1907, and his mother was an [[Italian-American]] born in New Jersey.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} They married in 1929.{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} In 1930, James worked as a die setter for a can manufacturer. Eventually, James and Elizabeth began a song-and-dance act. In 1936, the three children began performing, billed as &quot;The Three Little Hillbillies.&quot; They moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], in 1938, where the children began working as [[film|movie]] [[Extra (actor)|extra]]s.

==Child actor==
[[File:RobtBlake1944.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Robert Blake in 1944]]
Then known as Mickey Gubitosi, Blake began his acting [[career]] as Toto in the [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]] movie ''[[Bridal Suite]]'' ([[1939 in film|1939]]) starring [[Annabella (actress)|Annabella]] and [[Robert Young (actor)|Robert Young]]. Gubitosi then began appearing in MGM's ''[[Our Gang]]'' [[short subjects]] (aka The Little Rascals) under his real name, replacing [[Eugene Gordon Lee|Eugene &quot;Porky&quot; Lee]]. He appeared in 40 of the shorts between 1939 and 1944, eventually becoming the series' final lead character. James and Giovanna Gubitosi also made appearances in the series as extras.

In ''Our Gang'', Gubitosi's character, Mickey, was often called upon to cry, for which he was criticized for being unconvincing. He was also criticized for being obnoxious and whiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maltin |first=Leonard |authorlink=Leonard Maltin |coauthors=Richard W. Bann |title=The Little Rascals: The Life &amp; Times of Our Gang |origyear=1977 |edition=Rev. ed. |year=1992 |publisher=Crown Publishing/Three Rivers Press |isbn=0-517-58325-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1942, he acquired the [[stage name]] Bobby Blake and his character in the series was renamed &quot;Mickey Blake.&quot; In 1944, MGM discontinued ''Our Gang'', releasing the final short in the series ''[[Dancing Romeo]]''.  In 1995, Blake was honored by the [[Young Artist Award|Young Artist Foundation]] with its [[Young Artist Former Child Star Lifetime Achievement Award|Former Child Star &quot;Lifetime Achievement&quot; Award]] for his role in ''Our Gang''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Young Artist Awards 16&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youngartistawards.org/pastnoms16.htm|title=16th Annual Youth in Film Awards|accessdate=2011-03-31|work=YoungArtistAwards.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is one of the few living actors from the original series. Others include [[Dickie Moore (actor)|Dickie Moore]], [[Jean Darling]], [[Sidney Kibrick]], [[Jerry Tucker]], and [[Jackie Lynn Taylor]].  

[[File:Robert Blake 1975.JPG|thumb|150px|Blake as Little Beaver.]]In [[1944 in film|1944]], Blake began playing a Native American boy, &quot;Little Beaver,&quot; in the [[Red Ryder]] [[Western movie|Western]] series at the studios of Republic Pictures (now CBS Radford Studios), appearing in twenty-three of the movies until [[1947 in film|1947]]. He also had roles in one of [[Laurel and Hardy]]'s later films ''[[The Big Noise]]'' ([[1944 in film|1944]]), and the [[Warner Bros.]] movies ''[[Humoresque]]'' ([[1946 in film|1946]]), playing [[John Garfield]]'s character as a child, and ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' (1948), playing the [[Mexico|Mexican]] boy who sells [[Humphrey Bogart]] a winning lottery ticket and gets a glass of water thrown in his face by Bogart in the process. 

Blake had an unhappy childhood and was allegedly abused by his alcoholic father. When he entered public school at age ten, he was bullied and had fights, which led to his expulsion. When he was fourteen, he ran away from home, leading to several more difficult years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Gary C. |last=King |title=Robert Blake and the Murder of Bonny Lee Bakley |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/family/bakley/15.html |page=15 |publisher=Tru TV |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- {{clear}} --&gt;

==Career as an adult==
In 1950, Blake joined the [[United States Army|Army]]. After returning to [[Southern California]], he entered [[Jeff Corey]]'s acting class and began working on improving both his personal and professional lives. He eventually became a seasoned [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] actor, playing notable dramatic roles in movies and on [[television]]. In 1956, he was billed as Robert Blake for the first time.

In 1959, he turned down the role of [[Little Joe (character)|Little Joe Cartwright]], a character ultimately portrayed by [[Michael Landon]], in [[NBC]]'s [[Western (genre)|western]] [[television program|television series]] ''[[Bonanza]].'' Blake did appear that year as Tobe Hackett in the episode &quot;Trade Me Deadly&quot; of the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] western series ''[[26 Men]],'' which dramatized true stories of the [[Arizona Rangers]]. Blake also appeared twice as &quot;Alfredo&quot; in the syndicated western ''[[The Cisco Kid (TV series)|The Cisco Kid]]'' and starred in &quot;The White Hat&quot; episode of ''[[Men of Annapolis]],'' another syndicated series. Blake appeared in various roles in the series ''[[Have Gun Will Travel]]'' and also guest starred on [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]]'s NBC western ''[[The Restless Gun]]''.

Blake performed in numerous motion pictures as an adult, including the starring role in ''[[The Purple Gang]]'' ([[1960 in film|1960]]), a gangster movie, and featured roles in ''[[Pork Chop Hill]]'' in 1959 and, as one of four US soldiers participating in a gang rape in [[occupied Germany]], in ''[[Town Without Pity]]'' in 1961. He was also in ''[[Ensign Pulver]]'' ([[1964 in film|1964]]), ''[[The Greatest Story Ever Told]]'' ([[1965 in film|1965]]) and other films. In [[1967 in film|1967]], he played real-life murderer [[Perry Smith (murderer)|Perry Smith]] in ''[[In Cold Blood (film)|In Cold Blood]]''; [[Richard Brooks]] directed, adapting [[Truman Capote]]'s non-fiction book for the film.
[[File:Robert Blake Baretta and Fred 1976.JPG|thumb|left|200px|As Baretta with Fred.]]
Blake played an Indian fugitive in ''[[Tell Them Willie Boy Is Here]]'' ([[1969 in film|1969]]), a TV movie adaptation of ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' (1981), and a motorcycle highway patrolman in ''[[Electra Glide in Blue]]'' ([[1973 in film|1973]]). He played a small-town stock car driver with ambitions to join the [[NASCAR]] circuit in ''[[Corky (film)|Corky]]'' which MGM produced in 1972. The film featured real NASCAR drivers, including [[Richard Petty]] and [[Cale Yarborough]].

Blake may be best known for his [[Emmy Award]]-winning role of Tony Baretta in the popular television series ''[[Baretta (television)|Baretta]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;PM&quot;/&gt; (1975 to 1978), playing an undercover police detective who specialized in disguises. The show's trademarks included Baretta's pet [[cockatoo]] &quot;Fred,&quot; his signature phrases&amp;nbsp;— notably &quot;That's the name of that tune&quot; and &quot;You can take that to the bank&quot;&amp;nbsp;— and a memorable theme song, &quot;Keep Your Eye on the Sparrow,&quot; written by [[Dave Grusin]] and Morgan Ames and performed by [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]]

After ''Baretta'' ended, [[NBC]] offered to produce several pilot episodes of a proposed series called ''[[Joe Dancer]]'', in which Blake would play the eponymous role of a hard-boiled private detective. In addition to starring, Blake also was credited as the executive producer and creator. Four episodes aired to poor reviews in 1981 and 1983, and the series never ultimately sold.

He continued to act through the 1980s and 1990s, mostly in television, in such roles as [[Jimmy Hoffa]] in the miniseries ''[[Blood Feud (1983 film)|Blood Feud]]'' (1983) and as [[John List]] in the murder drama ''Judgment Day: The John List Story'' (1993), which earned him a third Emmy nomination. He also had character parts in the theatrical movies ''[[Money Train]]'' ([[1995 in film|1995]]) and ''[[Lost Highway (film)|Lost Highway]]'' (1997). In addition, Blake starred in the television series ''[[Hell Town (TV series)|Hell Town]]'', playing a priest working in a tough neighborhood.

==Personal life==
[[File:Robert Blake Baretta 1977.JPG|thumb|left|Blake in 1977]]
He and actress [[Sondra Kerr]] were married in 1961 and divorced in 1983. They had two children, actor [[Noah Blake]] (born 1965) and Delinah Blake (born 1966).

In 1999, Blake met [[Bonnie Lee Bakley]], formerly of [[Wharton, New Jersey]], who reportedly had a history of exploiting older men for money, especially celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/07/25/48hours/main516379.shtml |title = A Question Of Guilt: The Bakley Murder: Who Killed Bonny Lee Bakley? &lt;!-- article is titled what it is, if there is a spelling error, it's CBS's fault --&gt; |publisher=[[CBS]] |date=2002-08-05 |accessdate = 2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was dating [[Christian Brando]], son of [[Marlon Brando]], during her relationship with Blake. Bakley became pregnant and told both Brando and Blake that they were the father. Initially, Bakley named the baby &quot;Christian Shannon Brando&quot; and stated that Brando was the father of her child.&lt;ref name=&quot;tru5&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Gary C. |last=King |title=Robert Blake and the Muder of Bonny Lee Bakley |publisher=Tru TV |page=5 |url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/family/bakley/5.html |accessdate=2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakley wrote letters describing her dubious motives to Blake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/blake/docs/letters.html?page=2 |title=Excerpts from letters written by victim found in defendant's home |accessdate=2007-04-02 |date=2003-03-06 |work=Court TV Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blake insisted that she take a DNA test to prove the paternity.&lt;ref name=&quot;tru5&quot;/&gt; Blake and Bakley married November 19, 2000 after [[DNA]] tests proved Blake to be the biological father of her child, renamed Rose. It was his second marriage, her tenth. 

Although they were married, Bakley lived in a small guest house behind her husband's house in the [[Studio City, Los Angeles, California|Studio City]] area of the [[San Fernando Valley]].

On May 4, 2001, Blake took Bakley to Vitello's Restaurant on Tujunga Avenue in Studio City. Afterward, Bakley was killed by a gunshot to the head while sitting in the car, which was parked around the corner from the restaurant. Blake told the police he had gone back inside the restaurant to get a gun he left at the table and was there when the shooting occurred. The gun, a .38 caliber pistol, was tested and found not to be the gun that killed Bakley, which was determined to be a 9&amp;nbsp;mm pistol. Though witnesses in the restaurant testified that Blake indeed returned to the restaurant once, claiming that his wife had been shot, no witnesses claim to have seen him return prior to that, supposedly to retrieve the gun he left at the table where he and Bakley ate.

As of 2012, Blake was living in a modest Sherman Oaks apartment complex and promoting his autobiography [[Tales of a Rascal]] on talk shows like CNN's [[Piers Morgan Tonight]] and [[Dr. Phil]].

==Legal history==

===Arrest and trial for murder===
Almost one year later, on April 18, 2002, Blake was arrested and charged in connection with the murder of his wife. His longtime bodyguard, Earle Caldwell, was also arrested and charged with conspiracy in connection with murder. A key event that gave the LAPD the confidence to arrest Blake came when a retired stuntman, Ronald &quot;Duffy&quot; Hambleton, agreed to testify against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/news/2002/0425/blake_ap.html |title=Stuntmen key witnesses vs. Blake |accessdate=2007-04-02 |date=2002-04-25 |work=Court TV Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hambleton alleged that Blake tried to hire him to kill Bonnie Lee Bakley. Another retired stuntman and an associate of Hambleton's, Gary McLarty, came forward with a similar story. 

According to author Miles Corwin, Hambleton agreed to testify against Blake only after being told he would be subject to a [[grand jury]] subpoena and a pending misdemeanor charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.courttv.com/trials/blake/011905_ctv.html |title=Author: Police suspected Robert Blake hours after wife was slain |accessdate=2007-04-02 |last=Sweetingham |first=Lisa |date=2005-01-20 |work = Court TV Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hambleton's motives for testifying were called into question by Blake's defense team during the criminal trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sweetingham |first=Lisa |url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/blake/020105_ctv.html|title=Scene is set in Blake case; cue stuntmen  |accessdate=2007-04-02 |date=2005-02-01 |work=Court TV Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 22, 2002, Blake was charged with one count of murder with special circumstances, an offense eligible for the death penalty. He was also charged with two counts of solicitation of murder and one count of murder conspiracy. Blake pleaded not guilty to all charges. Caldwell was charged with a single count of murder conspiracy and also pleaded not guilty. Three days later, the Los Angeles [[District attorney (county)|District Attorney]]'s office announced they would not seek the death penalty against Blake should he be convicted, but prosecutors would seek a sentence of life in prison without parole.

After Blake posted US$1 million bail, Caldwell was released, but a judge denied bail for Blake. On March 13, 2003, after almost a year in jail, Blake was granted bail, which was set at US$1.5 million, and he was allowed to go free to await trial.  Blake was placed on house arrest during this time. 

====Murder trial and acquittal====
Blake's criminal trial for murder began on December 20, 2004 with opening statements by the prosecution and then the defense the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The State v. Robert Blake |url=http://www.bakleymurder.com/part8.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the contention of the prosecution that Blake intentionally murdered Bonnie Lee Bakley to free himself from a loveless marriage, while the defense challenged all of the evidence claiming that Blake was an innocent victim of circumstantial and fabricated evidence.

Prosecution testimony began with various witnesses detailing the night of the murder and the murder weapon used. Bakley was shot twice while sitting in the passenger side of the parked car and the passenger window was rolled down, indicating she may have been familiar with her assailant. The murder weapon was revealed to be a semi-automatic Walther P-38 pistol, which was found in a dumpster a few yards away from the parked car where the shooting took place. 

On February 7, 2005, Gary McLarty claimed that in March 2001, Blake attempted to contract him to murder his wife; McLarty allegedly declined. McLarty's testimony was pulled apart under intense cross-examination, including a history of mental problems and his inability to remember any key details of the alleged contract offer. On February 9, testimony came from Ronald 'Duffy' Hambleton, who also claimed that Blake tried to solicit him to murder his wife. His testimony was also called into question during cross-examination when his past criminal record of various petty crimes for drug and gun possession were made known. 

The prosecution rested its case on February 14. The defense began its case with a series of witnesses who poked holes in various parts of the prosecution's case—including relatives of Gary McLarty. On February 19, testimony was heard about the effects of chronic drug use on the mind - specifically the minds of the two key prosecution witnesses, Ronald &quot;Duffy&quot; Hambleton and Gary McLarty, who were noted drug users during their stuntman careers. The lack of gunshot residue on Blake's hands was also a key part of the defense's case that Blake was not the shooter. Robert Blake chose not to testify. The defense rested its case on February 23, and after closing arguments were made on March 2–3, the jury retired to deliberate on March 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The State v. Robert Blake |url=http://www.bakleymurder.com/part9.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 16, 2005, Blake was found not guilty of the murder of Bonnie Lee Bakley and of one of the two counts of solicitation of murder. The other count, the solicitation of Gary McLarty, was dropped after it was revealed that the jury was deadlocked 11-1 in favor of an acquittal. Los Angeles District Attorney [[Steve Cooley]], commenting on this ruling, called Blake a &quot;miserable human being&quot; and the jurors &quot;incredibly stupid.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blake jurors want apology from D.A. |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7284990 |accessdate=2009-07-09 |date=2005-03-25 |work=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blake's defense team, led by attorney [[M. Gerald Schwartzbach]], and members of the jury responded that the prosecution had failed to prove its case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Little motive, plenty doubt |url=http://www.newsday.com/topic/ny-liside0317,0,7463765.story |accessdate=2007-04-02 |last=Riley |first=John |date=2005-03-17 |work=[[Newsday]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trial analysts also agreed with the jury's verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blake's Hollywood Ending: Legal Analyst Andrew Cohen Breaks Down Acquittals|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/16/opinion/courtwatch/main681064.shtml |accessdate=2007-04-02 |date=2005-03-16 |publisher=[[CBS]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of his acquittal several fans celebrated at Blake's favorite haunt, Vitello's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fans Flock to Vitello's to Celebrate Verdict |work=Los Angeles Daily News |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/FANS+FLOCK+TO+VITELLO'S+TO+CELEBRATE+VERDICT.(News)-a0130499360 |accessdate=2009-01-16 |date=2005-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil case===
Bakley's three children filed a [[civil suit]] against Blake, asserting that he was responsible for their mother's death. On November 18, 2005, the jury found Blake liable for the [[wrongful death claim|wrongful death]] of his wife and ordered him to pay US$30 million. On February 3, 2006, Blake filed for [[bankruptcy]]. Expressing disbelief that Blake was found liable by the jury in the civil trial, Schwartzbach (Blake's attorney in the criminal trial) vowed to appeal the jury verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Linda |last=Deutsch |title=Blake to Appeal Wrongful-Death Verdict |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/08/AR2006050801098.html |work=[[Washington Post]] |date=2006-05-08 |accessdate=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Civil trial verdict appeal====
According to the Associated Press, Schwartzbach filed the appeal brief on February 28, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Linda |last=Deutsch |title=Robert Blake appeals $30M civil verdict |url=http://www.montereyherald.com/mld/montereyherald/entertainment/16805298.htm |work=[[Monterey County Herald]] |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Blake appeal brief |url=http://hosted.ap.org/specials/interactives/_documents/blake_appeal.pdf |accessdate=2007-04-02 |date=2007-02-28 |format=pdf |work=[[Associated Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AP also reported that an LAPD Internal Affairs investigation has been opened regarding the lead detective in the murder case, Detective Ron Ito. The complaint, filed by Schwartzbach and civil trial witness Brian Allan Fiebelkorn, alleged that the detective failed to investigate leads that persons other than Robert Blake could have been responsible for the murder of Bonnie Lee Bakley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Linda |last=Deutsch |title=Lawyer, witness claim police neglected evidence in Blake murder case |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/state/20070119-1130-blake-wifeslain.html |work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |date=2007-01-19 |accessdate = 2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiebelkorn testified that associates of [[Christian Brando]] may have been responsible for the murder of Ms. Bakley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Linda |last=Deutsch |title=Blake trial witness: Detectives discounted alternative theory |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20051101/news_1n1blake.html |work=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |date=2005-11-01 |accessdate=2007-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A defense theory of who may have been involved in the conspiracy to kill Bonnie Lee Bakley was laid out in a defense motion filed during the criminal trial proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Defense motion |publisher=[[Court TV]] |url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/blake/docs/thirdparty.pdf |date=2004-12-01 |accessdate=2007-04-02 |format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Verdict upheld====
On April 26, 2008, an appeals court upheld the civil case verdict, but cut Blake's penalty assessment in half.  Blake's attorneys had protested that jurors improperly discussed the [[Michael Jackson]] and [[O.J. Simpson]] verdicts during deliberations of his case, but the appeals judge ruled that such discussions were not improper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-04-27 |title=Actor Blake loses US court appeal |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7369978.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement and 2010 tax lien===
Blake has maintained a very low profile since his acquittal and his filing for bankruptcy with debts of $3,000,000 for unpaid legal fees and state and federal taxes after the criminal and civil trials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.detnews.com/apps/blogs/taxingdetroitblog/index.php?blogid=295 DETNEWS | Weblogs | Tax Watchdog&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Having retired from acting years before the murder of Bonnie Lee Bakley, and because of his legal issues, Blake has expressed that he might return to acting someday to help himself financially.&lt;ref name=welkos&gt;{{cite web|last=Welkos|first=Robert W.|title=An Act 2 for Robert Blake?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/mar/25/entertainment/et-blake25|work=Los Angeles Times|publisher=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=7 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 9 April 2010, the state of [[California]] filed a tax lien against Blake for $1,110,878 with the [[Los Angeles County]] recorder of Deeds for unpaid back taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webcpa.com/news/Robert-Blake-Tax-Lien-54728-1.html |title=Actor Robert Blake Hit with $1.1 Million Tax Lien |publisher=Webcpa.com |date=2010-06-23 |accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011, Blake appeared on ''[[Tavis Smiley (TV series)|Tavis Smiley]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/tavissmiley/interviews/actor-robert-blake-part-1/|title=The Tavis Smiley Show|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2012-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 July 2012, Blake was interviewed on ''[[Piers Morgan Tonight]]''. During the interview, Blake was asked by Morgan about the night of the murder of Blake's wife, Bonnie. The line of questioning quickly led to Blake becoming defensive and angry. Blake said he resented Morgan's questioning and felt he was being interrogated. Morgan disagreed with Blake's assessment of the questioning saying he was only asking questions he felt people were anxious to have answers to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2012/07/11/robert-blake-on-his-murdered-wife-bonnie-lee-bakley-i-think-she-was-a-con-artist/?hpt=pm_mid|title=Robert Blake on his murdered wife Bonnie Lee Bakley|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2012-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blake told interviewers and wrote in his autobiography that he hoped he would be offered one more great acting role.
