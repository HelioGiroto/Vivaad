'''Clarence Thomas''' (born June 23, 1948) is an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States]]. Succeeding [[Thurgood Marshall]], Thomas is the second [[African American]] to serve on the Court.

Thomas grew up in [[Savannah, Georgia]] and was educated at the [[College of the Holy Cross]] and at [[Yale Law School]]. In 1974, he was appointed an [[Missouri Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General]] in [[Missouri]] and subsequently practiced law there in the private sector. In 1979, he became a [[legislative assistant]] to Senator [[John Danforth]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Missouri|MO]]) and in 1981 was appointed Assistant Secretary for Civil Rights at the [[U.S. Department of Education]]. In 1982, President [[Ronald Reagan]] appointed Thomas Chairman of the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC); he served in that position until 1990, when President [[George H. W. Bush]] nominated him for a seat on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]].

On July 1, 1991, after 16 months of service as a judge, Thomas was nominated by Bush to fill Marshall's seat on the [[United States Supreme Court]]. [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|Thomas's confirmation hearings]] were bitter and intensely fought, centering on an accusation that he had made unwelcome sexual comments to attorney [[Anita Hill]], a subordinate at the Department of Education and subsequently at the EEOC. The [[U.S. Senate]] ultimately confirmed Thomas by a vote of 52–48.

Since joining the Court, Thomas has taken a [[textualist]] approach, seeking to uphold what he sees as the [[original meaning]] of the [[United States Constitution]] and statutes. He is generally viewed as among the most [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] members of the Court. Thomas has often approached [[federalism]] issues in a way that limits the power of the [[federal government of the United States|federal government]] and expands power of state and [[Local government in the United States|local]] governments. At the same time, Thomas's opinions have generally supported a strong [[United States Executive Branch|executive branch]] within the federal government.

==Early life and education==
Clarence Thomas was born in 1948 in [[Pin Point, Georgia]], a small, predominantly black community founded by [[freedmen]] after the [[American Civil War]]. When he was a child, the town lacked a sewage system and paved roads. He was the second of three children born to M.C. Thomas, a farm worker, and Leola Williams, a domestic worker.&lt;ref name=&quot;oyez.org&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;businessweek2&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | title = The Holy Cross Fraternity | author=Brady, Diane | work=[[BusinessWeek]] | date = March 12, 2007 | url = http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_11/b4025079.htm | accessdate =October 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were descendants of American [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]], and the family spoke [[Gullah language|Gullah]] as a first language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gullah&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/14/politics/14TWOR.html &quot;In His Own Words: Justice Clarence Thomas&quot;], ''New York Times'', Dec 14, 2000, accessed Mar 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas's first-known ancestors were slaves named Sandy and Peggy who were born around the end of the 18th century and owned by wealthy [[Liberty County, Georgia]] planter Josiah Wilson.{{sfn|Foskett|2004|pp=22–23}} M.C. Thomas left his family when Thomas was two years old. Thomas's mother worked hard but was sometimes paid only pennies per day. She had difficulty putting food on the table and was forced to rely on charity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wash_Post_Mag_2002&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last = Merida | first = Kevin | last2 = Fletcher | first2 = Michael A. | title = Supreme Discomfort | newspaper=[[Washington Post Magazine]] | pages = W08 | date = August 4, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After a house fire left them [[homeless]], Thomas and his younger brother Myers were taken to live with his mother's parents in [[Savannah, Georgia]]. Thomas was seven when the family moved in with his maternal grandfather, Myers Anderson, and Anderson's wife, Christine (née Hargrove), in Savannah.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc news3&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | title = Anger Still Fresh in Clarence Thomas's Memoir | first = Monica | last = Dolin | publisher=[[ABC News]] | date = October 3, 2007| url = http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/Story?id=3682886&amp;page=1 | accessdate =October 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Living with his grandparents, Thomas enjoyed amenities such as indoor plumbing and regular meals for the first time in his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;oyez.org&quot; /&gt; His grandfather Myers Anderson had little formal education, but had built a thriving [[fuel oil]] business that also sold ice. Thomas calls his grandfather &quot;the greatest man I have ever known.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;abc news3&quot;/&gt; When Thomas was 10, Anderson started taking the family to help at a farm every day from sunrise to sunset.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc news3&quot;/&gt; His grandfather believed in hard work and self-reliance; he would counsel Thomas to &quot;never let the sun catch you in bed.&quot; Thomas's grandfather also impressed upon his grandsons the importance of getting a good education.&lt;ref name=&quot;oyez.org&quot; /&gt;

Thomas was the only black person at his high school in Savannah, where he was an honor student.&lt;ref name=&quot;businessweek&quot;&gt;Brady, Diane. [http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_11/b4025080.htm &quot;Clarence Thomas Speaks Out&quot;], ''BusinessWeek'' (March 12, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised Roman Catholic. (He later attended an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] church with his first wife but returned to the Catholic Church in the late 1990s.) He considered entering the [[priesthood]] at the age of 16, and became the first black student to attend [[Jean-Marie Vianney|St. John Vianney's]] Minor Seminary (Savannah) on the [[Isle of Hope]].&lt;ref name=&quot;abc news3&quot;/&gt; He also briefly attended [[Conception Seminary College]], a Roman Catholic [[seminary]] in [[Missouri]]. No one in Thomas's family had attended college. Thomas has said that during his first year in seminary, he was one of only &quot;three or four&quot; blacks attending the school.&lt;ref name=&quot;businessweek&quot;/&gt; Thomas told interviewers that he left the seminary in the aftermath of the [[assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.]] He had overheard another student say after the shooting, &quot;Good, I hope the son of a bitch died.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;businessweek2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | title = Judge Portrayed as a Product Of Ideals Clashing With Life | first = David | last = Margolick | newspaper=New York Times | date = July 3, 1991 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE4DE143FF930A35754C0A967958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | accessdate =October 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did not think the church did enough to combat racism.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc news3&quot;/&gt;

At a nun's suggestion, Thomas attended the [[College of the Holy Cross]] in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]. While there, Thomas helped found the Black Student Union. Once he walked out after an incident in which black students were punished while white students went undisciplined for committing the same violation, and some of the priests negotiated with the protesting black students to re-enter the school.&lt;ref name=&quot;businessweek&quot;/&gt;

Having spoken the [[Gullah language]] as a child, Thomas realized in college that he still sounded unpolished despite having been drilled in grammar at school, and he chose to major in English literature &quot;to conquer the language&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sotomayor and Thomas&quot;/&gt; At Holy Cross, he was also a member of [[Alpha Sigma Nu]] and the Purple Key Society.&lt;ref name=&quot;FindLaw&quot;/&gt; Thomas graduated from Holy Cross in 1971 with an A.B. ''[[cum laude]]'' in [[English literature]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sotomayor and Thomas&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/07/us/politics/07affirm.html?pagewanted=all|title=For Sotomayor and Thomas, Paths Diverge at Race |last=Kantor|first=Jody|coauthors=Gonzalez, David|date=June 6, 2009|newspaper=New York Times|accessdate=April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FindLaw&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://supreme.lp.findlaw.com/supreme_court/justices/thomas.html|title=Clarence Thomas|publisher=[[FindLaw]]|accessdate=April 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas had a series of deferments from the [[Conscription in the United States|military draft]] while in college at Holy Cross. Upon graduation, he was classified as [[Class 1-A|1-A]] and received a low lottery number, indicating he might be drafted to serve in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]. Thomas failed his medical exam, due to [[scoliosis|curvature of the spine]], and was not drafted.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek-mystery&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|work=Newsweek|title=Supreme Mystery|date=September 15, 1991|accessdate=November 1, 2011|first=Martin|last=Simon|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/126939/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas entered [[Yale Law School]], from which he received a [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) degree in 1974, graduating towards the middle of his class.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbsnews.com&quot;&gt;[[Steve Kroft|Kroft, Steve]], [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/27/60minutes/main3305443_page5.shtml (Sept. 30, 2007) ''Clarence Thomas: The Justice Nobody Knows – Supreme Court Justice Gives First Television Interview To] [[60 Minutes]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas has recollected that his Yale law degree was not taken seriously by law firms to which he applied after graduating. He said that potential employers assumed he obtained it because of [[affirmative action]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.townhall.com/TalkRadio/Show.aspx?RadioShowID=3&amp;ContentGuid=8b54ead4-9c5c-4dff-acba-aedc11a408db |title=Talk Radio Online::Radio Show |publisher=[[Townhall.com]]|date= |accessdate=December 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thomas, he was &quot;asked pointed questions, unsubtly suggesting that they doubted I was as smart as my grades indicated.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek&quot;&gt;[[Dahlia Lithwick|Lithwick, Dahlia]]. [http://www.newsweek.com/id/161228 &quot;From Clarence Thomas to Palin&quot;] (Opinion Column), ''[[Newsweek]]'' (September 27, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influences==
In 1975, when Thomas read ''[[Race and Economics]]'' by economist [[Thomas Sowell]], he found an intellectual foundation for his philosophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wash_Post_Mag_2002&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;la times&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

==Career==
===Early career===
[[File:Thomaseeoc.jpg|right|thumb|Official Equal Employment Opportunity Commission portrait of Thomas]]
Thomas was admitted to the Missouri bar on September 13, 1974.{{sfn|Foskett|2004|p=139}} From 1974 to 1977, Thomas was an Assistant Attorney General of Missouri under then State Attorney General [[John Danforth]], who met Thomas at Yale Law School. Thomas was the only black member of Danforth's staff.{{sfn|Foskett|2004|p=138}} As Assistant Attorney General, Thomas first worked at the criminal appeals division of Danforth's office and moved on to the revenue and taxation division.{{sfn|Foskett|2004|pp=139–140}} Retrospectively, Thomas considers Assistant Attorney General the best job he has ever had.{{sfn|Foskett|2004|p=147}} When Danforth was elected to the U.S. Senate in 1976, Thomas left to become an attorney with the [[Monsanto Company]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].{{sfn|Foskett|2004|pp=147, 149}} He moved to Washington, D.C. and returned to work for Danforth from 1979 to 1981 as a Legislative Assistant handling energy issues for the [[Senate Commerce Committee]].{{sfn|Foskett|2004|p=149}} The two men shared a common bond in that they had studied to be ordained (although in different [[Christian denomination|denominations]]). Danforth was to be instrumental in championing Thomas for the Supreme Court.

In 1981, he joined the Reagan administration. From 1981 to 1982, he served as [[Assistant Secretary of Education for the Office for Civil Rights]] in the [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]]. From 1982 to 1990, he was Chairman of the US [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (&quot;EEOC&quot;). Journalist [[Evan Thomas]] characterized Thomas as &quot;openly ambitious for higher office&quot; during his tenure at the EEOC. As Chairman, he promoted a doctrine of self-reliance, and halted the usual EEOC approach of filing [[class-action]] discrimination lawsuits, instead pursuing acts of individual discrimination.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek-thomas-1991&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|work=Newsweek | date = July 15, 1991 | accessdate =April 20, 2009 | first = Evan | last = Thomas | authorlink = Evan Thomas | title = Where Does He Stand? | url = http://www.newsweek.com/1991/07/14/where-does-he-stand.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also asserted in 1984 that black leaders were &quot;watching the destruction of our race&quot; as they &quot;bitch, bitch, bitch&quot; about President Reagan instead of working with the Reagan administration to alleviate [[teenage pregnancy]], unemployment and [[illiteracy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Williams | first = Juan | authorlink = Juan Williams | url =http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/125860002.html?dids=125860002:125860002&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Oct+25%2C+1984&amp;author=By+Juan+Williams+Washington+Post+Staff+Writer&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post++(1974-Current+file)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A7&amp;desc=EEOC+Chairman+Blasts+Black+Leaders | title = EEOC Chairman Blasts Black Leaders |work=The Washington Post | date = October 25, 1984 | accessdate =April 20, 2009 | quote= The chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission says that black leaders are 'watching the destruction of our race' as they 'bitch, bitch, bitch' about President Reagan but fail to work with the administration to solve problems.

Black spokesmen should be working with the administration to solve such problems as teen-age pregnancy, unemployment or illiteracy instead of working against Reagan, Thomas said.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal judge===
On October 30, 1989, Thomas was nominated by President [[George H. W. Bush]] to a seat on the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] vacated by [[Robert Bork]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/t/clarence_thomas/index.html |title=Clarence Thomas |work=The New York Times |date=March 28, 2012 |accessdate=May 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite Thomas's initial protestations that he would not like to be a judge.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc news&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | title = Clarence Thomas: A Silent Justice Speaks Out | author=[[Jan Crawford Greenburg|Greenburg, Jan Crawford]] | publisher=[[ABC News]] | date = September 30, 2007 | url = http://abcnews.go.com/TheLaw/story?id=3664944&amp;page=1 | accessdate =October 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas gained the support of other African Americans such as former Transportation Secretary [[William Thaddeus Coleman, Jr.|William Coleman]], but said that when meeting white [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] staffers in the [[United States Senate]], he was &quot;struck by how easy it had become for sanctimonious whites to accuse a black man of not caring about [[civil rights]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;abc news&quot;/&gt;

Thomas's confirmation hearing was uneventful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thomas.loc.gov/home/nomis.html The Library of Congress Presidential Nominations], Look up of Nomination: PN838-101. February 6, 1990 – Committee on Judiciary, hearings held. February 22, 1990 – Committee on Judiciary, ordered to be reported favorably, placed on Senate Executive Calendar. March 6, 1990 – floor action, confirmed by the Senate by voice vote.&lt;/ref&gt; He was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on March 6, 1990, and received his commission the same day. He developed warm relationships during his 19 months on the federal court, including with fellow federal judge [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;abc news&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjc.gov/servlet/nGetInfo?jid=2362 Profile] at the [[Biographical Directory of Federal Judges]], a [[Public domain]] publication of the [[Federal Judicial Center]].

===Supreme Court nomination and confirmation===
{{Main|Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination}}
Justice [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William Brennan]] stepped down from the Supreme Court in July 1990. Thomas was one of five candidates on Bush's shortlist, and Bush's favorite of the five. Ultimately, after consulting with his advisors, Bush decided to hold off on nominating Thomas, and nominated Judge [[David Souter]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit|First Circuit]] instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc news&quot;/&gt; 

Less than a year later, on July 1, 1991 President Bush nominated Clarence Thomas to replace Thurgood Marshall, who had just announced his retirement and had been the only African-American justice on the Court.&lt;ref&gt;[[Maureen Dowd|Dowd, Maureen]].

In those days, U.S. presidents submitted lists of potential federal court nominees to the [[American Bar Association]] (ABA) for a [[American Bar Association#Rating of_judicial_nominees|confidential rating]] of their judicial temperament, competence and integrity on a three-level scale of well qualified, qualified or unqualified.&lt;ref name=&quot;hall&quot;&gt;Hall, Kermit and McGuire, Kevin.

She testified that Thomas had subjected her to comments of a sexual nature, which she felt constituted sexual harassment or at least &quot;behavior that is unbefitting an individual who will be a member of the Court.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/12/us/the-thomas-nomination-excerpts-from-senate-s-hearings-on-the-thomas-nomination.html?pagewanted=12 &quot;The Thomas Nomination; Excerpts From Senate's Hearings on the Thomas Nomination&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'' (1991-10-12):&lt;br /&gt;&quot;Q: Professor Hill, there's a big difference between your articulating your version of events, contrasted with your statement that Judge Thomas sexually harassed you. And in the transcript of your October 7 interview, you responded to a question saying that it was sexual harassment.&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;A: In my opinion, based on my reading of the law, yes, it was. But later on, immediately following that response, I noted to the press that I did not raise a claim of sexual harassment in this complaint. It seems to me that the behavior has to be evaluated on its own with regard to the fitness of this individual to act as an Associate Justice. It seems to me that even if it does not rise to the level of sexual harassment, it is behavior that is unbefitting an individual who will be a member of the Court.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Rita Braver|Braver, Rita]].

''Subject to Debate: Sense and Dissents on Women, Politics, and Culture'', page 161 (2001): &quot;The question Hill's testimony placed before us was not whether Thomas was guilty of a legally actionable offense (she herself was unsure if his behavior added up to sexual harassment) but whether he belonged on the Supreme Court.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Travis, Carol.

===Early years on the Court===

==Public perception==
Thomas has rarely given media interviews during his time on the Court. He said in 2007: &quot;One of the reasons I don't do media interviews is, in the past, the media often has its own script.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;businessweek&quot;/&gt; In 2007, Thomas received a $1.5&amp;nbsp;million advance for writing his memoir, ''[[My Grandfather's Son]]''; it became a bestseller.&lt;ref name=&quot;wash post3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garner, Dwight. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E3D81F3BF932A15753C1A9619C8B63 &quot;TBR; TBR: Inside the List&quot;], ''[[New York Times]]'' (October 21, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas biographer Scott Douglas Gerber has opined that attacks against Thomas from critics such as Jeffrey Toobin have been unusually vitriolic, which Gerber attributes in part to liberals’ disappointment that Thomas has departed so much from the jurisprudence of the African American whom he succeeded, Thurgood Marshall.&lt;ref name=Gerber&gt;Gerber, Scott Douglas. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=LESvhXkbtBwC&amp;pg=PA30&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;dq=%22scott+douglas+gerber%22+Toobin&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=86P63OtkP5&amp;sig=5gaBDwU0fRVds8T2GihIWoEFVzI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bDrwS8C5BYG88gaC0fT9Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false First principles: the jurisprudence of Clarence Thomas]'', pages 30–33 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; Additional possible causes for the harsh criticism of Thomas may be the inherently explosive nature of sexual misconduct accusations, the suspicion among some people that Thomas was less than forthcoming during his confirmation hearings, and the belief in some circles that Thomas has benefited from affirmative action programs like ones he has criticized as a judge.&lt;ref name=Gerber /&gt;

In 2006, Thomas had a 48% favorable, 36% unfavorable rating, according to Rasmussen Reports.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/favorables/major_political_figures &quot;Major Political Figures&quot;], Rasmussen Reports.

[http://www.wcl.American.edu/journal/genderlaw/10/10-2marzulla.PDF?rd=1 &quot;The Textualism of Clarence Thomas: Anchoring the Supreme Court's Property Rights Jurisprudence to the Constitution&quot;], ''Journal of Gender, Social Policy &amp; The Law'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; According to the same commentator, Thomas generally declines to engage in what he sees as judicial lawmaking, and instead views the constitutional role of the Court as being the interpretation of law, rather than the making of law.&lt;ref name=Marzulla /&gt;

===Voting alignment===
On average, from 1994 to 2004, Scalia and Thomas had an 86.7% voting alignment, the highest on the Court, followed by Ginsburg and Souter (85.6%).&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard&quot;&gt;[http://hlr.rubystudio.com/media/pdf/nine_justices_ten_years.pdf &quot;Nine Justices, Ten Years: A Statistical Retrospective&quot;], ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', volume 118, page 510, 519 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; Scalia and Thomas's agreement rate peaked in 1996, at 97.7%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard&quot;&gt;[http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/118/Nov04/Nine_Justices_Ten_YearsFTX.pdf &quot;Nine Justices, Ten Years: A Statistical Retrospective&quot;], ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', volume 118, page 513 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt; By 2004, however, other pairs of justices were observed to be more closely aligned than Scalia and Thomas.&lt;ref&gt;Baude, Will. Brothers in Law, ''[[The New Republic]]'' Online, (June 30, 2004): &quot;Justices Souter and Ginsburg were in complete agreement in 85 percent of the Court's decisions. Chief Justice Rehnquist agreed with Justice O'Connor in 79 percent and Justice Kennedy in 77 percent. Justices Stevens and Souter agreed 77 percent of the time; so did Justices Ginsburg and Breyer. Thomas and Scalia agreed in only 73 percent of the cases. Thomas regularly breaks with Scalia, disagreeing on points of doctrine, finding a more measured and judicial tone, and calling for the elimination of bad law. Unless he is simply a very bad yes-man, Clarence Thomas is a more independent voice than most people give him credit for.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The conventional wisdom that Thomas's votes follow [[Antonin Scalia]]'s is reflected by Linda Greenhouse's observation that Thomas voted with Scalia 91 percent of the time during October Term 2006, and with Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] the least, 36% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;Greenhouse, Linda. [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/01/washington/01scotus.html &quot;In Steps Big and Small, Supreme Court, Moved Right&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jan Crawford Greenburg]] asserts that to some extent, this is true in the other direction as well, that Scalia often joins Thomas instead of Thomas joining Scalia.{{sfn|Greenburg|2007|pp=115-126}} Statistics compiled annually by Tom Goldstein of [[SCOTUSblog]] demonstrate that Greenhouse's count is methodology-specific, counting non-unanimous cases where Scalia and Thomas voted for the same litigant, regardless of whether they got there by the same reasoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/NonUnanAgreementOT06.pdf |title=EAST-#7825019-v1-OT06_Non-Unan_Agreement.XLS |date= |accessdate=June 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldstein's statistics show that the two agreed in full only 74% of the time, and that the frequency of agreement between Scalia and Thomas is not as outstanding as is often implied by pieces aimed at lay audiences. For example, in that same term, Souter and Ginsburg voted together 81% of the time by the method of counting that yields a 74% agreement between Thomas and Scalia. By the metric that produces the 91% Scalia/Thomas figure, Ginsburg and Breyer agreed 90% of the time. Roberts and Alito agreed 94% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/movabletype/archives/AgreementFinalOT06.pdf |title=EAST-#7824858-v1-OT06_Agreement_2.XLS |date= |accessdate=June 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal correspondent [[Jan Crawford Greenburg]] wrote in her book on the Supreme Court that Thomas's forceful views moved &quot;moderates like &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Sandra Day O'Connor]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; further to the left&quot;,{{sfn|Greenburg|2007|p=166}} but frequently attracted votes from Rehnquist and Scalia.{{sfn|Greenburg|2007|pp=114-137}} [[Mark Tushnet]] and Jeffrey Toobin both observe that Rehnquist rarely assigned important majority opinions to Thomas, because the latter's views made it difficult for him to persuade a majority of justices to join him.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Tushnet, A Court Divided 85-6 (2006); Jeffrey Toobin, The Nine 119 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Number of dissenting opinions===
From 1994 to 2004, on average, Thomas was the third most frequent dissenter on the Court, behind Stevens and Scalia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard&quot; /&gt; Four other justices dissented as frequently in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stats07&quot;&gt;[http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/121/nov07/statistics07.pdf &quot;The Statistics&quot;], ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', volume 121, page 439 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Three other justices dissented as frequently in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stats06&quot;&gt;[http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/120/nov06/statistics06.pdf &quot;The Statistics&quot;], ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', volume 120, page 372 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; One other justice dissented as frequently in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stats05&quot;&gt;[http://www.harvardlawreview.org/issues/119/Nov05/Statistics.pdf &quot;The Statistics&quot;], ''[[Harvard Law Review]]'', volume 119, page 415 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stare decisis===
{{See also|Stare decisis#U.S. legal system|l1=Stare decisis in the U.S. legal system}}
Thomas spoke favorably about the concept of [[stare decisis]] during his confirmation hearings, stating that &quot;stare decisis provides continuity to our system, it provides predictability, and in our process of case-by-case decision making, I think it is a very important and critical concept.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wash post2&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A31117-2004Oct13.html &quot;A Big Question About Clarence Thomas&quot;], ''The Washington Post'', October 14, 2004. Accessed May 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to [[Antonin Scalia]], Thomas &quot;doesn’t believe in stare decisis, period.&quot;&lt;ref name=NYTimes22Oct2011&gt;{{cite news| last=Caplan| first=Lincoln| title=Clarence Thomas’s Brand of Judicial Logic|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/23/opinion/sunday/clarence-thomass-brand-of-judicial-logic.html|accessdate=1 July 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=22 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This assessment is consistent with Thomas's record on the bench: factoring in length of tenure, Thomas urged overruling and joined in overruling precedents more frequently than any other justice during the Rehnquist Court.&lt;ref name=&quot;over&quot;&gt;Gerhardt, Michael. ''The Power of Precedent'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=HOgeAC0T0aEC&amp;pg=PA247 pages 249 (ranked eleventh for overturning precedent)] and [http://books.google.com/books?id=hNcfgzuSTS4C&amp;pg=PA12 12 (most frequently urged overturning)] (Oxford University Press 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Also according to Scalia, Thomas is more willing than himself to overrule constitutional cases: &quot;If a constitutional line of authority is wrong, he would say let's get it right. I wouldn't do that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ringel, Jonathan. [http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1090180289132 &quot;The Bombshell in the Clarence Thomas Biography&quot;], [http://www.dailyreportonline.com/ Daily Report] via Law.com (August 5, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  But, law professor Michael J. Gerhardt says that Scalia's characterization of Thomas may be incorrect, given that Thomas has supported leaving a broad spectrum of constitutional decisions intact.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhardt, Michael.  &quot;The Power of Precedent&quot;, [http://books.google.com/books?id=HOgeAC0T0aEC&amp;pg=PA188 page 188] (Oxford University Press 2008): &quot;I am not sure Justice Scalia is even right about Justice Thomas, who does not, at least statistically, urge more than three overrulings per term, thus indicating his willingness to leave a fairly broad spectrum of constitutional decisions intact.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Thomas's belief in originalism is strong; he has said, &quot;When faced with a clash of constitutional principle and a line of unreasoned cases wholly divorced from the text, history, and structure of our founding document, we should not hesitate to resolve the tension in favor of the Constitution's original meaning.&quot;{{sfn|Toobin|2007|p=120}} Thomas believes that an erroneous decision can and should be overturned, no matter how old it is.{{sfn|Toobin|2007|p=120}}

Law professor Amy Barrett maintains that Thomas supports statutory stare decisis.  Her cited examples include Thomas's concurring opinion in ''[[Fogerty v. Fantasy]]'', {{ussc|510|517|1994}}.&lt;ref&gt;Barrett, Amy. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=670521 &quot;Statutory Stare Decisis in the Courts of Appeals&quot;], ''[[George Washington Law Review]]'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commerce Clause===
Thomas has consistently supported narrowing the Court's interpretation of the Constitution's [[Interstate Commerce Clause]] (which is often simply called the &quot;Commerce Clause&quot;) to limit federal power. At the same time, Thomas has broadly interpreted states' [[sovereign immunity]] from lawsuits under the Commerce Clause.&lt;ref&gt;''E.g.'', ''[[Seminole Tribe v. Florida]]'' [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=517&amp;page=44 517 U.S. 44 (1996). Full text of opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[United States v. Lopez]]'' and ''[[United States v. Morrison]]'', the Court held that Congress lacked power under the Commerce Clause to regulate non-commercial activities. In these cases, Thomas wrote a separate concurring opinion arguing for the original meaning of the Commerce Clause. Subsequently, in ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'', the Court interpreted the Interstate Commerce Clause combined with the [[Necessary and Proper Clause]] to empower the federal government to arrest, [[prosecute]], and [[imprison]] patients who used marijuana grown at home for medicinal purposes, even where the activity is legal in that particular state. Thomas dissented in ''Raich'', again arguing for the original meaning of the Commerce Clause.

Thomas and Scalia have rejected the notion of a [[Dormant Commerce Clause]], also known as the &quot;Negative Commerce Clause&quot;. That doctrine bars state commercial regulation even if Congress has not yet acted on the matter.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United Haulers Assn. v. Oneida-Herkimer Solid Waste Mgmt. Auth.]]'' [http://www2.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-1345.ZS.html 550 U.S. 330 (2007).] Full text opinion courtesy of [[Cornell University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Lopez,'' Thomas expressed his view that federal regulation of either manufacturing or agriculture is unconstitutional; he sees both as outside the scope of the Commerce Clause.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Lopez]]'' [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/u10287.html 514 U.S. 549 (1995).] Full text of opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Toobin|2007|p=100}} He believes federal legislators have overextended the Commerce Clause, while some of his critics argue that Thomas's position on Congressional authority would invalidate much of the contemporary work of the federal government.{{sfn|Toobin|2007|p=100}} According to Thomas, it is not the Court's job to update the Constitution. Proponents of broad national power such as Professor [[Michael C. Dorf|Michael Dorf]] deny that they are trying to update the Constitution. Instead, they argue that they are merely addressing a set of economic facts that did not exist when the Constitution was framed.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael C. Dorf|Dorf, Michael]]. [http://writ.news.findlaw.com/dorf/20080729.html &quot;What California's Trans Fat Ban Teaches Us About Federalism&quot;], ''[[Writ (website)|Findlaw's Writ]]'' (July 29, 2008): &quot;Proponents of broad national power like myself do not say that the Court should update the Constitution to keep it in tune with the times. Rather, we argue —- or at least some of us argue —- that the growth of a national, indeed, global, economy, means that activities that might have been carried out in relatively discrete local markets in 1789 are now undoubtedly part of interstate and international commerce.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federalism===
[[Federalism]] was a central part of the Rehnquist Court's constitutional agenda.&lt;ref name=&quot;agenda&quot; /&gt; Thomas consistently voted for outcomes that promoted state-governmental authority, in cases involving federalism-based limits on Congress's enumerated powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;agenda&quot;&gt;Joondeph, Bradley [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1019648 &quot;Federalism, the Rehnquist Court, and the Modern Republican Party&quot;], ''[[University of Oregon School of Law|Oregon Law Review]]'', Volume 87 (2008): &quot;Most scholars agree that federalism was central to the Rehnquist Court's constitutional agenda.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; According to law professor [[Ann Althouse]], the Court has yet to move toward &quot;the broader, more principled version of federalism propounded by Justice Thomas.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Althouse&quot;&gt;[[Ann Althouse|Althouse, Ann]]. [http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?51+Duke+L.+J.+363+pdf &quot;Why Talking About States' Rights Cannot Avoid the Need for Normative Federalism Analysis: A Response to Professors Baker and Young&quot;], ''[[Duke Law Journal]]'', Volume 51, page 363 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Foucha v. Louisiana]]'', Thomas dissented from the majority opinion that required the removal from a mental institution of a prisoner who had become sane.{{sfn|Greenburg|2007|p=117}} The Court held that a Louisiana statute violated the [[Due Process Clause]] &quot;because it allows an insanity acquittee to be committed to a mental institution until he is able to demonstrate that he is not dangerous to himself and others, even though he does not suffer from any mental illness.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Foucha&quot;&gt;''[[Foucha v. Louisiana]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/504/71.html 504 U.S. 71 (1992). Full text of opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com.]&lt;/ref&gt; Dissenting, Thomas cast the issue as a matter of federalism.{{sfn|Greenburg|2007|p=117}} &quot;Removing sane insanity acquittees from mental institutions may make eminent sense as a policy matter,&quot; he concluded, &quot;but the Due Process Clause does not require the States to conform to the policy preferences of federal judges.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Foucha&quot; /&gt; In ''[[United States v. Comstock]]'', Thomas' dissent argued for the release of a former federal prisoner from [[civil commitment]], again on the basis of federalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;scotuspdf&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1224.pdf |title=08-1224 United States v. Comstock (05/17/2010) |format=PDF |publisher=Supremecourt.gov|accessdate=2010-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privileges, immunities, and firearms===
Thomas agreed with the judgment in ''[[McDonald v. Chicago]]'' (2010) that the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|right to keep and bear arms]] is applicable to state and local governments, but Thomas wrote a separate concurrence finding that an individual's right to bear arms is fundamental as a privilege of American citizenship under the [[Privileges or Immunities Clause]] rather than as a fundamental right under the [[due process|due process clause]]. The four justices in the [[plurality opinion]] specifically rejected incorporation under the privileges or immunities clause, &quot;declin[ing] to disturb&quot; the holding in the ''[[Slaughter-House Cases]]'', which, according to the plurality, had held that the clause applied only to federal matters.&lt;ref&gt;Ost, Harriet. &quot;[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/US/2010/06/28/US-Supreme-Court-Chicagos-gun-ban-struck-down/UPI-18071277761369 U.S. Supreme Court: Chicago's gun ban struck down]&quot;, [[United Press International]] (June 28, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/09pdf/08-1521.pdf McDonald v. Chicago slip opinion from the U.S. Supreme Court]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Executive power===
Thomas has argued that the [[executive branch]] has broad authority under the Constitution and federal statutes. In ''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]],'' he was the only justice who agreed with the Fourth Circuit that Congress had power to authorize the President's detention of US citizens who are enemy combatants. Thomas granted the federal government the &quot;strongest presumptions&quot; and said &quot;due process requires nothing more than a good-faith executive determination&quot; to justify the imprisonment of Hamdi, a US citizen.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hamdi v. Rumsfeld]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=542&amp;page=507 542 U.S. 507 (2004). Full text of opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas also was one of three justices who dissented in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'', which held that the [[Guantanamo military commission|military commissions]] set up by the Bush administration to try detainees at [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp|Guantanamo Bay]] required explicit congressional authorization, and held that the commissions conflicted with both the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice|Uniform Code of Military Justice (UCMJ)]] and &quot;at least&quot; Common Article 3 of the [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'', [http://supreme.vlex.com/vid/hamdan-v-rumsfeld-320635 548 U.S. 557 (2006).]&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas argued that Hamdan was an [[illegal combatant]] and therefore not protected by the Geneva Convention, and he agreed with Justice Scalia that the Court was &quot;patently erroneous&quot; in its declaration of jurisdiction in this case.

===Free speech===
Among the nine justices, Thomas was the second most likely to uphold [[free speech]] claims (tied with [[David Souter]]), as of 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugene Volokh|Volokh, Eugene]]. [http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/howvoted.htm &quot;How the Justices Voted in Free Speech Cases, 1994–2000&quot;] (Updated), 48 UCLA L. Rev. 1191 (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; He has voted in favor of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] claims in cases involving a wide variety of issues, including pornography, [[campaign finance|campaign contributions]], political leafleting, religious speech, and [[commercial speech]].

On occasion, however, he has disagreed with free speech claimants. For example, he dissented in ''[[Virginia v. Black]]'', a case that struck down part of a Virginia statute that banned [[cross burning]]. Concurring in ''[[Morse v. Frederick]]'', he argued that students' free speech rights in [[public school (government funded)|public schools]] are limited.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morse&quot;&gt;''[[Morse v. Frederick]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/06-278.html 551 U.S. 393 (2007). Full text of opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas authored the decision in ''[[American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft (2002)|ACLU v. Ashcroft]]'', which held that the [[Child Online Protection Act]] might (or might not) be constitutional. The government was enjoined from enforcing it, pending further proceedings in the lower courts.&lt;ref&gt;''[[American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft (2002)|American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/00-1293.html 535 U.S. 564 (2002)], full text courtesy of Findlaw.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas wrote a concurrence in ''[[McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Commission]]'', [[Case citation|514 U.S. 334]] (1995).&lt;ref name=findlaw&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=CASE&amp;court=US&amp;vol=514&amp;page=334 514 U.S. 334] Full text of the opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth Amendment===
In cases regarding the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]], which prohibits unreasonable [[search and seizure|searches and seizures]], Thomas often favors police over [[defendant]]s. For example, his opinion for the Court in ''[[Board of Education v. Earls]]'' upheld drug testing for students involved in extracurricular activities, and he wrote again for the Court in ''[[Samson v. California]]'', permitting random searches on [[parole]]es. He dissented in the case ''[[Georgia v. Randolph]]'', which prohibited warrantless searches that one resident approves and the other opposes, arguing that the case was controlled by the Court's decision in ''[[Coolidge v. New Hampshire]]''. In ''[[Indianapolis v. Edmond]]'', Thomas described the Court's extant case law as having held that &quot;suspicionless roadblock seizures are constitutionally permissible if conducted according to a plan that limits the discretion of the officers conducting the stops.&quot; Although he expressed doubt that those cases were correctly decided, he concluded that since the litigants in the case at bar had not briefed or argued that the earlier cases be overruled, he believed that the Court should assume their validity and rule accordingly.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Indianapolis v. Edmond]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/99-1030.html 531 U.S. 32 (2000)]. Full text of opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com.&lt;/ref&gt; There are counterexamples, however: he was in the majority in ''[[Kyllo v. United States]]'', which held that the use of thermal imaging technology to probe a suspect's home, without a warrant, violated the Fourth Amendment.

In cases involving schools, Thomas has advocated greater respect for the doctrine of [[in loco parentis]], which he defines as &quot;parents delegat[ing] to teachers their authority to discipline and maintain order.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Safford&quot; /&gt; His dissent in ''[[Safford Unified School District v. Redding]]'' illustrates his application of this postulate in the Fourth Amendment context. School officials in the ''Safford'' case had a reasonable suspicion that 13-year-old Savana Redding was illegally distributing prescription-only drugs. All the justices concurred that it was therefore reasonable for the school officials to search Redding, and the main issue before the Court was only whether the search went too far by becoming a [[strip search]] or the like.&lt;ref name=&quot;Safford&quot;&gt;''[[Safford Unified School District v. Redding]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/08-479.html 557 U. S. __ (2009). Full text of opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com.]&lt;/ref&gt; All justices but Thomas concluded that this search violated the Fourth Amendment. The majority required a finding of danger or reason to believe drugs were hidden in a student's underwear in order to justify a strip search. In contrast, Thomas said, &quot;It is a mistake for judges to assume the responsibility for deciding which school rules are important enough to allow for invasive searches and which rules are not&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=105896007&amp;sc=fb&amp;cc=fp &quot;Court Says Strip Search of Ariz. Teenager Illegal&quot;], [[Associated Press]] via [[National Public Radio|NPR]] (June 25, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; and that &quot;reasonable suspicion that Redding was in possession of drugs in violation of these policies, therefore, justified a search extending to any area where small pills could be concealed.&quot; Thomas said, &quot;There can be no doubt that a parent would have had the authority to conduct the search.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Safford&quot;/&gt;

===Sixth Amendment===
In ''[[Doggett v. United States]]'', the defendant had technically been a fugitive from the time he was indicted in 1980 until his arrest in 1988. The Court held that the delay between indictment and arrest violated Doggett's [[Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Sixth Amendment]] right to a [[speedy trial]], finding that the government had been negligent in pursuing him and that he was unaware of the indictment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doggett&quot;&gt;''[[Doggett v. United States]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/505/647.html 505 U.S. 647 (1992)]. Full text of opinion courtesy of Findlaw.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas dissented, arguing that the purpose of the Speedy Trial Clause was to prevent &quot;'undue and oppressive incarceration' and the 'anxiety and concern accompanying public accusation'&quot; and that the case implicated neither.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doggett&quot; /&gt; He cast the case as instead &quot;present[ing] the question [of] whether, independent of these core concerns, the Speedy Trial Clause protects an accused from two additional harms: (1) prejudice to his ability to defend himself caused by the passage of time; and (2) disruption of his life years after the alleged commission of his crime.&quot; Thomas dissented from the Court's decision to, as he saw it, answer the former in the affirmative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doggett&quot; /&gt; Thomas wrote that dismissing the conviction &quot;invites the Nation's judges to indulge in ad hoc and result-driven second guessing of the government's investigatory efforts. Our Constitution neither contemplates nor tolerates such a role.&quot;{{sfn|Greenburg|2007|p=123}}

===Eighth Amendment and capital punishment===
Thomas was among the dissenters in ''[[Atkins v. Virginia]]'' and ''[[Roper v. Simmons]]'', which held that the [[Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] prohibits the application of the death penalty to certain classes of persons. In ''[[Kansas v. Marsh]]'', his opinion for the Court indicated a belief that the Constitution affords states broad procedural latitude in imposing the death penalty, provided they remain within the limits of ''[[Furman v. Georgia]]'' and ''[[Gregg v. Georgia]]'', the 1976 case in which the Court had reversed its 1972 ban on death sentences if states followed procedural guidelines.

In ''[[Hudson v. McMillian]]'', a prisoner had been beaten, garnering a cracked lip, broken dental plate, loosened teeth, and cuts and bruises. Although these were not &quot;serious injuries&quot;, the Court believed, it held that &quot;the use of excessive physical force against a prisoner may constitute cruel and unusual punishment even though the inmate does not suffer serious injury.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hudson&quot;&gt;''[[Hudson v. McMillian]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?navby=case&amp;court=us&amp;vol=503&amp;page=1 503 U.S. 1 (1992)].&lt;/ref&gt; Dissenting, Thomas wrote that, in his view, &quot;a use of force that causes only insignificant harm to a prisoner may be immoral, it may be tortious, it may be criminal, and it may even be remediable under other provisions of the Federal Constitution, but it is not 'cruel and unusual punishment'. In concluding to the contrary, the Court today goes far beyond our precedents.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hudson&quot; /&gt; Thomas's vote – in one of his first cases after joining the Court – was an early example of his willingness to be the sole dissenter (Scalia later joined the opinion).{{sfn|Greenburg|2007|p=119}} Thomas's opinion was criticized by the 7-member majority of the Court, which wrote that by comparing physical assault to other prison conditions such as poor prison food, Thomas's opinion ignored &quot;the concepts of dignity, civilized standards, humanity, and decency that animate the Eighth Amendment&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hudson&quot; /&gt; According to historian [[David Garrow]], Thomas's dissent in ''Hudson'' was a &quot;classic call for federal judicial restraint, reminiscent of views that were held by [[Felix Frankfurter]] and John M. Harlan II a generation earlier, but editorial criticism rained down on him&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrow&quot;&gt;[[David Garrow|Garrow, David]] (October 25, 2004), [http://www.davidgarrow-com.hb2hosting.net/File/DJG%202004%20TNRCTFoskettReview.pdf &quot;Saving Thomas&quot;], ''[[The New Republic]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas would later respond to the accusation &quot;that I supported the beating of prisoners in that case. Well, one must either be illiterate or fraught with malice to reach that conclusion ... no honest reading can reach such a conclusion.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Garrow&quot; /&gt;

In ''[[United States v. Bajakajian]]'', Thomas joined with the Court's more liberal bloc to write the majority opinion declaring a fine unconstitutional under the Eighth Amendment. The fine was for failing to declare over $300,000 in a suitcase on an international flight. Under a federal statute, {{usc|18|982}}(a)(1), the passenger would have had to forfeit the entire amount. Thomas noted that the case required a distinction to be made between civil forfeiture and a fine exacted with the intention of punishing the respondent. He found that the forfeiture in this case was clearly intended as a punishment at least in part, was &quot;grossly disproportional&quot;, and a violation of the Excessive Fines Clause.&lt;ref&gt;''[[United States v. Bajakajian]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=96-1487 524 U.S. 321] (1998).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church and state===
Law professor and former Thomas clerk [[John Yoo]] says Thomas supports allowing religious groups more participation in public life.&lt;ref name=&quot;online.wsj.com&quot;&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119189308788652936.html Yoo, John, Opinion (October 9, 2007) ''The Real Clarence Thomas''] [[Wall Street Journal]].&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas says the [[Establishment Clause]] (&quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion&quot;) &quot;is best understood as a federalism provision –- it protects state establishments from federal interference but does not protect any individual right.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Elk&quot; /&gt;

In ''[[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;Elk&quot;&gt;''[[Elk Grove Unified School District v. Newdow]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/02-1624.html 542 U.S. 1] (2004). Thomas wrote: &quot;It may well be the case that anything that would violate the [[Incorporation (Bill of Rights)|incorporated]] Establishment Clause would actually violate the Free Exercise Clause, further calling into doubt the utility of incorporating the Establishment Clause.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Cutter v. Wilkinson]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Cutter&quot;&gt;''[[Cutter v. Wilkinson]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/03-9877.html 544 U.S. 709] (2005). Thomas wrote: &quot;I note, however, that a state law that would violate the incorporated Establishment Clause might also violate the Free Exercise Clause.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas wrote that he supported incorporation of the [[Free Exercise Clause]], which he says &quot;clearly protects an individual right.&quot; He said that any law that would violate the Establishment Clause might also violate the Free Exercise Clause.

Thomas says &quot;it makes little sense to incorporate the [[Establishment Clause]]&quot; ''vis-à-vis'' the states by the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Elk&quot; /&gt; And in ''Cutter'', he wrote: &quot;The text and history of the Clause may well support the view that the Clause is not incorporated against the States precisely because the Clause shielded state establishments from congressional interference.&quot;

===Equal protection and affirmative action===
Thomas believes that the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the Fourteenth Amendment forbids consideration of race, such as race-based affirmative action or preferential treatment. In ''[[Adarand Constructors v. Peña]]'', for example, he wrote &quot;there is a 'moral [and] constitutional equivalence' between laws designed to subjugate a race and those that distribute benefits on the basis of race in order to foster some current notion of equality. Government cannot make us equal; it can only recognize, respect, and protect us as equal before the law. That [affirmative action] programs may have been motivated, in part, by good intentions cannot provide refuge from the principle that under our Constitution, the government may not make distinctions on the basis of race.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Adarand Constructors, Inc. v. Peña]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=u10252 515 U.S. 200] (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]'', Thomas said that, in his view, &quot;a State's use of racial discrimination in higher education admissions is categorically prohibited by the Equal Protection Clause.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gratz v. Bollinger]]'', [http://supreme.justia.com/us/539/244/case.html 539 U.S. 244] (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1]]'', Thomas joined the opinion of [[Chief Justice Roberts]], who concluded that &quot;[t]he way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Parents&quot;&gt;''[[Parents Involved in Community Schools v. Seattle School District No. 1]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/05-908.html 551 U.S. 701] (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Concurring, Thomas wrote that &quot;if our history has taught us anything, it has taught us to beware of elites bearing racial theories,&quot; and charged that the dissent carried &quot;similarities&quot; to the arguments of the segregationist litigants in ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parents&quot; /&gt; In ''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'', he approvingly quoted Justice Harlan's ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'' dissent: &quot;Our Constitution is color-blind, and neither knows nor tolerates classes among citizens.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Grutter v. Bollinger]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=000&amp;invol=02-241 539 U.S. 306] (2003).&lt;/ref&gt; In a concurrence in ''[[Missouri v. Jenkins]]'' (1995), he wrote that the Missouri District Court &quot;has read our cases to support the theory that black students suffer an unspecified psychological harm from segregation that retards their mental and educational development. This approach not only relies upon questionable social science research rather than constitutional principle, but it also rests on an assumption of black inferiority.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MissouriVJenkins&quot;&gt;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/93-1823.ZC1.html Thomas concurring opinion, Missouri v Jenkins]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abortion===
Thomas has contended that the constitution does not address the issue of abortion.&lt;ref name=&quot;online.wsj.com&quot;/&gt; In ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'' (1992), the Court reaffirmed ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''. Thomas along with Justice [[Byron White]] joined the dissenting opinions of [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]] and Justice [[Antonin Scalia]]. Rehnquist wrote that &quot;[w]e believe ''Roe'' was wrongly decided, and that it can and should be overruled consistently with our traditional approach to ''stare decisis'' in constitutional cases.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Casey&quot;&gt;''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/505/833.html 505 U.S. 833] (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; Scalia's opinion concluded that the right to obtain an abortion is not &quot;a liberty protected by the Constitution of the United States.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Casey&quot; /&gt; &quot;[T]he Constitution says absolutely nothing about it,&quot; Scalia wrote, &quot;and [ ] the longstanding traditions of American society have permitted it to be legally proscribed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Casey&quot; /&gt;

In ''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'' (2000), the Court struck down a state ban on [[partial-birth abortion]], concluding that it failed the &quot;undue burden&quot; test established in ''Casey''. Thomas dissented, writing: &quot;Although a State ''may'' permit abortion, nothing in the Constitution dictates that a State ''must'' do so.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cornell&quot;&gt;''[[Stenberg v. Carhart]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/99-830.html 530 U.S. 914] (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to criticize the reasoning of the ''Casey'' and ''Stenberg'' majorities: &quot;The majority's insistence on a health exception is a fig leaf barely covering its hostility to any abortion regulation by the States – a hostility that ''Casey'' purported to reject.&quot;

In ''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'' (2007), the Court rejected a [[facial challenge]] to a federal ban on [[partial-birth abortion]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Carhart&quot;&gt;''[[Gonzales v. Carhart]]'', [http://laws.findlaw.com/us/000/05-380.html 550 U.S. 124] (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Concurring, Thomas asserted that the Court's abortion jurisprudence had no basis in the Constitution, but that the Court had accurately applied that jurisprudence in rejecting the challenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carhart&quot; /&gt; Thomas added that the Court was not deciding the question of whether Congress had the power to outlaw partial birth abortions: [W]hether the Act constitutes a permissible exercise of Congress' power under the Commerce Clause is not before the Court [in this case] ... the parties did not raise or brief that issue; it is outside the question presented; and the lower courts did not address it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carhart&quot; /&gt;

===Gay rights===
In ''[[Lawrence v. Texas]]'' (2003), Thomas issued a one-page dissent where he called the Texas anti-gay sodomy statute &quot;uncommonly silly.&quot; He then said that if he were a member of the Texas legislature he would vote to repeal the law. Since he was not a member of the state legislature, but instead a federal judge, and the Due Process Clause did not (in his view) touch on the subject, he could not vote to strike it down. Accordingly, Thomas saw the issue as a matter for the states to decide for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=Lawrence v. Texas|vol=539|reporter=U.S.|opinion=558|pinpoint=605|court=|year=2003|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/539/558/case.html#605}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Romer v. Evans]]'' (1996), Thomas joined Scalia's dissenting opinion arguing that Amendment 2 to the Colorado State Constitution did not violate the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] to the U. S. Constitution. The Colorado amendment forbade any judicial, legislative, or executive action designed to protect persons from discrimination based on &quot;homosexual, lesbian, or bisexual orientation, conduct, practices or relationships.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oyez.org/cases/1990-1999/1995/1995_94_1039 |title=Romer v. Evans |date= |publisher=The Oyez Project |accessdate=April 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judicial review of federal laws===
Thomas is the justice most willing to exercise [[judicial review]] of federal laws. According to a ''New York Times'' editorial, &quot;from 1994 to 2005 ... Justice Thomas voted to overturn federal laws in 34 cases and Justice Scalia in 31, compared with just 15 for Justice Stephen Breyer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/11/opinion/11mon2.html?_r=2&amp;n=Top%2FOpinion%2FEditorials%20and%20Op-Ed%2FEditorials &quot;Activism Is in the Eye of the Ideologist&quot;] (Editorial), ''[[New York Times]]'' (September 11, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009's ''[[Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District No. 1 v. Holder]]'', Thomas was the sole dissenter, voting in favor of throwing out Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Section 5 requires states with a history of racial voter discrimination—mostly states from the old South—to get Justice Department clearance when revising election procedures. Though Congress had reauthorized Section 5 in 2006 for another 25 years, Thomas said the law was no longer necessary, pointing out that the rate of black voting in seven Section 5 states was higher than the national average. Thomas said &quot;the violence, intimidation and subterfuge that led Congress to pass Section 5 and this court to uphold it no longer remains.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/08-322.ZX.html Opinion of Thomas, J. NORTHWEST AUSTIN MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT NUMBER ONE v. ERIC H. HOLDER, Jr., ATTORNEY GENERAL (June 22, 2009) Full text courtesy of] [[Cornell University Law School]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Approach to oral arguments==
Thomas is well known for his reticence during oral argument. {{As of|2012|3|20|df=US}}&lt;!--- last time he asked a question was February 22, 2006 ---&gt;, he had not asked a question from the bench in 6 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;liptak-nyt&quot;&gt;Liptak, Adam [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/us/13thomas.html?_r=1&amp;hp &quot;No Argument: Thomas Keeps 5-Year Silence&quot;], ''The New York Times'', February 12, 2011, accessed February 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He has given many reasons for his silence, including self-consciousness about how he speaks, a preference for listening to those arguing the case, and difficulty getting in a word.&lt;ref name=liptak-nyt /&gt; In 2000, he told a group of high school students that &quot;if you wait long enough, someone will ask your question.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/14/politics/14TWOR.html?ex=1190952000&amp;en=24434907b359c2fd&amp;ei=5070 |title=Justice Clarence Thomas|work=The New York Times |date=December 14, 2000 |accessdate=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2007, he told an audience at [[Hillsdale College]]: &quot;My colleagues should shut up!&quot; He later explained, &quot;I don't think that for judging, and for what we are doing, all those questions are necessary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bedard, Paul (November 29, 2007). [http://www.usnews.com/blogs/washington-whispers/2007/11/29/this-is-not-perry-mason.html &quot;This Is Not Perry Mason&quot;]. ''Washington Whispers''. ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas's speaking and listening habits may have also been influenced by his [[Gullah]] upbringing, during which time his English was relatively unpolished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gullah&quot;&gt;Thomas, Clarence (December 14, 2000), [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01EFD91E3FF937A25751C1A9669C8B63 &quot;The 43rd President; In His Own Words&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]''.

According to Amber Porter of [[ABC News]], one of the most notable examples of a rare instance in which Thomas asked a question was in 2002, during oral arguments for [[Virginia v. Black]], when he expressed concern to Michael Dreeben, who had been speaking on behalf of the U.S. Department of Justice, that he was &quot;actually understating the symbolism...and the effect of...the burning cross&quot; and its use as a symbol of the &quot;reign of terror&quot; of &quot;100 years of lynching and activity in the South by the Knights of Camellia...and the Ku Klux Klan&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;porter-abc&quot;&gt;Porter, Amber [http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/03/545532/ &quot;Six Years of Silence for Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas&quot;], ''ABC News'', March 27, 2012, accessed April 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas is not the first quiet justice. In the 1970s and 1980s, [[William J. Brennan, Jr.|William J. Brennan]], [[Thurgood Marshall]], and [[Harry Blackmun]] were likewise generally quiet.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Garrow|Garrow, David]] (October 6, 1996).

''[[New York Times Magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Toobin|2007|pp=106–107}} However, Thomas's silence stood out in the 1990s as the other eight justices engaged in active questioning.{{sfn|Toobin|2007|p=106–107}}

==Personal life==
In 1971, Thomas married college sweetheart Kathy Grace Ambush. They had one child, Jamal Adeen. In 1981 they separated and in 1984 divorced.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc news2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|work=The Washington Post | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/21/AR2007042101475.html | title = Justice Thomas's Life A Tangle of Poverty, Privilege and Race | first = Kevin | last = Merida | first2= Michael A.|last2=Fletcher | date = April 22, 2007 | accessdate =April 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, Thomas married [[Virginia Lamp Thomas|Virginia Lamp]], a [[lobbyist]] and aide to Republican Congressman [[Dick Armey]].{{sfn|Toobin|2007|pp=111–112}} In 1997, they took in Thomas's then six-year-old great nephew, Mark Martin, Jr.,&lt;ref name=&quot;marches&quot;&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/sept01/2001-09-03-thomas.htm &quot;Justice Thomas marches to own tune&quot;], ''USA Today'', Associated Press, September 3, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; who had lived with his mother in Savannah public housing.{{sfn|Foskett|2004|p=303}}

Thomas's wife remained active in [[conservatism in the United States|conservative politics]], serving as a consultant to the [[Heritage Foundation]], a conservative [[think tank]], and as founder and president of [[Liberty Central]], an advocacy group associated with the [[Tea Party movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-na-thomas14-2010mar14,0,6505384.story|title=Justice's wife launches 'tea party' group|last=Hennessey|first=Kathleen|date=March 14, 2010|work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=March 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, Thomas's wife stepped down from Liberty Central to open a conservative [[lobbying|lobbying firm]] touting her &quot;experience and connections&quot;, meeting with newly elected Republican congressmen, and describing herself as an &quot;ambassador to the tea party&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;politico-lobbying&quot;&gt;{{cite news | work=[[Politico (newspapaer)|Politico]] | title = Justice Thomas's wife Virginia Thomas now a lobbyist | url = http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0211/48812.html | first = Kenneth | last = Vogel | first2= Marin|last2=Cogan| first3=John|last3=Bresnahan | date = February 4, 2011 | accessdate =February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-lobbying&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=The New York Times | title = Justice Thomas's Wife Sets Up a Conservative Lobbying Shop | first = Eric | last = Lichtblau | date = February 4, 2011 | accessdate =February 4, 2011 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/05/us/politics/05thomas.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas was reconciled to the Catholic Church in the mid-1990s.

Thomas has a reputation as an affable, good-humored man who is extremely personally popular with his friends and colleagues. According to writer [[Jeffrey Toobin]], &quot;Fellow justices, law clerks, police officers, cafeteria workers, janitors – all basked in Thomas's effusive good nature.
