'''Brigitte Anne-Marie Bardot'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rateyourmusic.com/artist/brigitte_bardot|title=Films and Music by Brigitte Bardot|publisher=Rate Your Music|accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailycelebrations.com/092800.htm|title=Daily Celebrations ~ Brigitte Bardot, Cat Transformed ~ 25 August ~ Ideas to motivate, educate, and inspire|publisher=Dailycelebrations.com|accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|b|r|ɪ|dʒ|ɨ|t|_|b|ɑr|ˈ|d|oʊ}}; {{IPA-fr|bʁiʒit baʁdo|lang}}; born 28 September 1934) is a former French fashion model, actress, singer and animal rights activist. She was one of the best-known [[sex symbol]]s of the 1960s. Starting in 1969, Bardot's features became the official face of [[Marianne]] (who had previously been anonymous) to represent the liberty of France.&lt;ref name=Sohn&gt;Anne-Marie Sohn (teacher at the [[École Normale Supérieure|ENS]]-Lyon), [http://hist-geo.ac-rouen.fr/doc/bls/2004/marian.htm Marianne ou l'histoire de l'idée républicaine aux XIXe et XXe siècles à la lumière de ses représentations] (résumé of Maurice Agulhon's three books, ''Marianne au combat'', ''Marianne au pouvoir'' and ''Les métamorphoses de Marianne'') {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bardot was an aspiring [[ballet]] dancer in early life. She started her acting career in 1952 and, after appearing in 16 films, became world-famous due to her role in her then-husband [[Roger Vadim]]'s controversial film ''[[And God Created Woman (1956 film)|And God Created Woman]]''. She later starred in [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s 1963 film ''[[Contempt (film)|Le Mépris]]''. Bardot was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role|BAFTA Award for Best Foreign Actress]] for her role in [[Louis Malle]]'s 1965 film ''[[Viva Maria!]]''. Bardot caught the attention of French intellectuals. She was the subject of [[Simone de Beauvoir]]'s 1959 essay, ''The Lolita Syndrome'', which described Bardot as a &quot;locomotive of women's history&quot; and built upon [[existentialist]] themes to declare her the first and most liberated woman of post-war France.&lt;ref name=guardot/&gt;

Bardot retired from the [[entertainment industry]] in 1973. During her career in [[show business]], Bardot starred in 47 films, performed in numerous musical shows, and recorded 80 songs. She was awarded the [[Legion of Honour]] in 1985, but refused to receive it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-big-question-how-does-the-french-honours-system-work-and-why-has-kylie-been-decorated-822752.html The Big Question: How does the French honours system work, and why has Kylie been decorated?] The Independent. 8 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; After her retirement, Bardot established herself as an [[animal rights]] activist. During the 1990s, she generated controversy by criticizing immigration, [[Islamization]] and [[Islam in France]], and has been fined five times for &quot;[[Incitement to ethnic or racial hatred|inciting racial hatred]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;race fine&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Bardot fine for stoking race hate|date=3 June 2008|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/7434193.stm|accessdate=3 June 2008|publisher=BBC News|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bardot fined for racist remarks|date=16 June 2000|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/793390.stm|accessdate=4 June 2008|publisher=BBC News|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Brigitte Bardot was born in [[Paris]] to Anne-Marie 'Toty' Mucel (1912–1978) and Louis 'Pilou' Bardot (1896–1975). Her father had an engineering degree and worked with his own father (Charles Bardot) in the family business. Toty was sixteen years younger and they married in 1933. Bardot grew up in a middle-class observant Roman Catholic family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tribune.ie/article/2009/sep/27/profile-brigitte-bardot-and-god-created-bardot|title=Profile: Brigitte Bardot – And God created Bardot|publisher=[[Sunday Tribune]]|date=27 September 2009|accessdate=19 September 2010|first=Valerie|last=Shanley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brigitte's mother enrolled Brigitte and her sister Marie-Jeanne (born 5 May 1938) in dance. Marie-Jeanne eventually gave up dancing lessons to complete her education, whereas Brigitte decided to concentrate on a ballet career.

In 1947, Bardot was accepted to the [[Conservatoire de Paris]], and for three years she attended the ballet classes of Russian choreographer Boris Knyazev. (One of her classmates was [[Leslie Caron]]; fellow ballerinas nicknamed Bardot: Bichette [Little Doe]).&lt;ref&gt;Caron, Leslie, ''Thank Heaven'', Plume Publishing (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

At the invitation of an acquaintance of her mother, she modelled in a fashion show in 1949. In the same year, she modelled for a fashion magazine &quot;''Jardin des Modes''&quot; managed by journalist Hélène Lazareff. Aged 15, she appeared on an 8 March 1950 cover of [[ELLE]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/830:112/1/Brigitte_Bardot.htm|title=Brigitte Bardot Biography|publisher=The Biography Channel|accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was noticed by a young film director, [[Roger Vadim]], while babysitting. He showed an issue of the magazine to director and screenwriter [[Marc Allégret]] who offered Bardot the opportunity to audition for &quot;''Les lauriers sont coupés''&quot; thereafter. Although Bardot got the role, the film was cancelled, but it made her consider becoming an actress. Moreover, her acquaintance with Vadim, who attended the audition, influenced her further life and career.&lt;ref name=&quot;InitialsBB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;twolives&quot;/&gt;

==Career==
Although the [[European cinema|European film industry]] was then in its ascendancy, Bardot was one of the few European actresses to have the mass media's attention in the United States, an interest which she did not reciprocate by rarely, if ever, going to Hollywood. She debuted in a 1952 [[comedy film]] ''Le Trou Normand'' (English title: ''Crazy for Love''). From 1952-56, she appeared in seventeen films; in 1953 she played a role in [[Jean Anouilh]]'s stageplay ''L'Invitation au château'' (''Invitation to the Castle''). She received media attention when she attended the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in April 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;twolives&quot;/&gt;[[File:Brigitte Bardot - Mexico - 1965.JPG|thumb|170px|BB in [[Mexico]], 1965.]]

Her films of the early and mid 1950s were generally lightweight romantic dramas, some historical, in which she was cast as [[Ingenue (stock character)|ingénue]] or [[siren]], often in varying states of undress. She played bit parts in three English-language films, the British comedy ''[[Doctor at Sea (film)|Doctor at Sea]]'' (1955) with [[Dirk Bogarde]], ''[[Helen of Troy (film)|Helen of Troy]]'' (1954), in which she was understudy for the [[Helen of Troy|title role]] but appears only as Helen's handmaid, and ''Act of Love'' (1954) with [[Kirk Douglas]]. Her French-language films were dubbed for international release.[[File:Et Dieu.jpg|thumb|170px|Cover film [[And God Created Woman (1956 film)|And God created woman]] (1956).]]

[[Roger Vadim]] (her husband at the time) was not content with this light fare. The [[French New Wave|New Wave]] of [[French cinema|French]] and [[Italian cinema|Italian]] art directors and their stars were riding high internationally, and he felt Bardot was being undersold. Looking for something more like an art film to push her as a serious actress, he showcased her in ''[[And God Created Woman (1956 film)|And God Created Woman]]'' (1956) with [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]]. The film, about an immoral teenager in a respectable small-town setting, was an international success.&lt;ref name=&quot;twolives&quot;/&gt;

In Bardot's early career, professional photographer Sam Lévin's photos contributed to her image of sensuality. One photo shows Brigitte from behind, dressed in a white corset. British photographer [[Cornel Lucas]] made iconic images of Bardot in the 1950s and 1960s that have become representative of her public persona. She divorced Vadim in 1957 and in 1959 married actor [[Jacques Charrier]], with whom she starred in ''Babette Goes to War''. The paparazzi preyed upon her marriage, while she and her husband clashed over the direction of her career.

''[[A Very Private Affair|Vie privée]]'' (1962), directed by [[Louis Malle]] has more than an element of her life story in it.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} The scene in which, returning to her apartment, Bardot's character is harangued in the elevator by a middle-aged cleaning lady calling her offensive names, was based on an actual incident, and is a resonant image of celebrity in the mid-20th century.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Bardot was awarded a [[David di Donatello|David di Donatello Award]] for Best Foreign actress for the role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000003/awards Awards for Brigitte Bardot info at IMDb]; Retrieved 21 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ivo Bardot.jpg|thumb|left|Brigitte Bardot, 1958.]]In May 1958, Bardot withdrew to the seclusion of [[Southern France]] where she had bought the house ''La Madrague'' in [[Saint-Tropez]]. In 1963, she starred in [[Jean-Luc Godard]]'s critically acclaimed film ''[[Contempt (film)|Le Mépris]]''. Bardot was featured in many other films along with notable actors such as [[Alain Delon]] (''Famous Love Affairs''; ''[[Spirits of the Dead]]''); [[Jean Gabin]] (''[[In Case of Adversity]]''); [[Sean Connery]] (''[[Shalako (film)|Shalako]]''); [[Jean Marais]] (''[[Royal Affairs in Versailles]]''; ''School for Love''); [[Lino Ventura]] (''Rum Runners''); [[Annie Girardot]] (''The Novices''); [[Claudia Cardinale]] (''[[The Legend of Frenchie King]]''); [[Jeanne Moreau]] (''[[Viva Maria!]]''); [[Jane Birkin]] (''[[Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman]]'').

In 1973, Bardot announced that she was retiring from acting as &quot;a way to get out elegantly&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Modesto Bee-7 June 1973&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Brigitte Bardot Gives Up Films At Age Of 39|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=d-EpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AYEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3388%2C1836097|agency=UPI|newspaper=The Modesto Bee|location=Modesto, California|date=7 June 1973|page=A-8|accessdate=17 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She participated in various musical shows and recorded many popular songs in the 1960s and 1970s, mostly in collaboration with [[Serge Gainsbourg]], Bob Zagury and [[Sacha Distel]], including &quot;Harley Davidson&quot;; &quot;Je Me Donne A Qui Me Plaît&quot;; &quot;Bubble gum&quot;; &quot;Contact&quot;; &quot;Je Reviendrais Toujours Vers Toi&quot;; &quot;L'Appareil À Sous&quot;; &quot;La Madrague&quot;; &quot;On Déménage&quot;; &quot;Sidonie&quot;; &quot;Tu Veux, Ou Tu Veux Pas?&quot;; &quot;Le Soleil De Ma Vie&quot; (the cover of [[Stevie Wonder]]'s &quot;[[You Are the Sunshine of My Life]]&quot;); and the notorious &quot;[[Je t'aime... moi non plus]]&quot;.

Bardot pleaded with Gainsbourg not to release this duet and he complied with her wishes; the following year, he re-recorded a version with British-born model and actress [[Jane Birkin]], which became a massive hit all over Europe. The version with Bardot was issued in 1986 and became a popular download hit in 2006 when [[Universal Records]] made its back catalogue available to purchase online, with this version of the song ranking as the third most popular download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6058742.stm|title=Bardot revived as download star|date=17 October 2006|work=BBC News|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:BBardo St Trop 1963t.jpg|thumb|170px|Brigitte Bardot and [[Sami Frey]] in [[Saint-Tropez]],1963.]]On 21 December 1952, aged 18, Bardot was married to director [[Roger Vadim]]. In order to receive permission from Bardot's parents to marry her, Vadim, originally a [[Russian Orthodox]] Christian, was urged to convert to Catholicism, although it is not clear if he ever did so. They divorced five years later, but remained friends and collaborated in later work. Bardot had an affair with her ''And God Created Woman'' co-star [[Jean-Louis Trintignant]] (married at the time to actress [[Stéphane Audran]]) before her divorce from Vadim.&lt;ref name=&quot;InitialsBB&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Brigitte|last=Bardot|title=Initiales B.B.|publisher=[[Grasset &amp; Fasquelle]]|year=1996|isbn=2-246-52601-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;twolives&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Jeffrey Robinson{{!}}Robinson, Jeffrey]]|title=Bardot&amp;nbsp;— Two Lives|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] (London)|First British Edition|year=1994|id=ASIN: B000KK1LBM}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two lived together for about two years. Their relationship was complicated by Trintignant's frequent absence due to [[military service]] and Bardot's affair with musician [[Gilbert Bécaud]], and they eventually separated.&lt;ref name=&quot;InitialsBB&quot;/&gt;

===Suicide allegations===

The 9 February 1958 edition of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reported on the front page that Bardot was recovering in Italy from a reported nervous breakdown. A suicide attempt with sleeping pills two days earlier was denied by her public relations manager.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimesblog&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedailymirror/files/1958_0209_cover.jpg|title=LA times 1958|date=|accessdate=21 August 2010|work=The Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the episode of [[BBC Radio 4]]'s chat show [[Loose Ends (radio)|Loose Ends]] transmitted on 20 October 2012, [[Honor Blackman]] told interviewer [[Clive Anderson]] that, when she'd worked alongside Bardot, Bardot could not be left alone because she'd recently made two suicide attempts. Blackman did not state when this was. (Blackman and Bardot both acted in the film [[Shalako (film)|Shalako]].)

==Family==
On 18 June 1959, she married actor Jacques Charrier, by whom she had her only child, a son, Nicolas-Jacques Charrier (born 11 January 1960). After she and Charrier divorced in 1962, Nicolas was raised in the Charrier family and did not maintain close contact with Bardot until his adulthood.&lt;ref name=&quot;InitialsBB&quot;/&gt;

Bardot's other husbands were German millionaire playboy [[Gunter Sachs]] (14 July 1966 – 1 October 1969) and Bernard d'Ormale (16 August 1992 – present).&lt;ref name=&quot;InitialsBB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;twolives&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8503379/Gunter-Sachs.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Gunter Sachs|date=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1950s she shared an exchange which was called &quot;la croisée de deux sillages&quot; (&quot;the crossing of two wakes&quot;) with actor and true-crime author [[John Gilmore (writer)|John Gilmore]], then an actor in France who was working on a New Wave film with [[Jean Seberg]]. Gilmore told ''[[Paris Match]]'': ''&quot;I felt a beautiful warmth with Bardot but found it difficult to discuss things in any depth whatsoever.&quot;''

In the 1970s, Bardot lived with sculptor Miroslav Brozek and posed for some of his sculptures. In 1974, Bardot appeared in a nude photo shoot in ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, which celebrated her 40th birthday.

==Animal welfare activism==
In 1973, before her 39th birthday, Bardot announced her retirement. After appearing in more than forty motion pictures and recording several music albums, most notably with [[Serge Gainsbourg]], she chose to use her fame to promote [[animal rights]].

In 1986, she established the Brigitte Bardot Foundation for the Welfare and Protection of Animals.&lt;ref name=foundationhistory&gt;

Retrieved 2 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; and raised three million francs to fund the foundation by auctioning off jewellery and many personal belongings.&lt;ref name=foundationhistory/&gt; Today she is a strong animal rights activist and a major opponent of the consumption of [[horse meat]]. In support of animal protection, she condemned [[Seal hunting#Canada|seal hunting in Canada]] during a visit to that country with [[Paul Watson]] of the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HARDLINE&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10619393 |title=Hardline warrior in war to save the whale |date=11 January 2010 |work= The New Zealand Herald |accessdate=22 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She sought to discuss the issue with [[Stephen Harper]], [[Prime Minister of Canada]], but her request for a meeting was reportedly denied.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} On 25 May 2011 the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society renamed its fast interceptor vessel, MV ''Gojira'', as [[MV Brigitte Bardot|MV ''Brigitte Bardot'']] in appreciation of her support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/news-110525-1.html Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

She once had a neighbour's donkey castrated while looking after it, on the grounds of its &quot;sexual harassment&quot; of her own donkey and mare, for which she was taken to court by the donkey's owner in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photoicon.com/online_features/8|title=PHOTOICON ONLINE FEATURES: Andy Martin: Brigitte Bardot|publisher=Photoicon.com|accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrpophistory.com/popculturefiles/askmrpophistory_q359.htm|title=Mr Pop History|publisher=Mr Pop History|accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bardot wrote a 1999 letter to Chinese President [[Jiang Zemin]], published in French magazine VSD, in which she accused the Chinese of &quot;torturing bears and killing the world's last tigers and rhinos to make [[aphrodisiac]]s&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/424734.stm|title=Bardot savages Chirac and China|publisher=BBC News|date=19 August 1999|accessdate=13 March 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has donated more than $140,000 over two years for a mass [[animal sterilization|sterilization]] and adoption program for [[Bucharest]]'s [[Free-ranging urban dog|stray dogs]], estimated to number 300,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1196712.stm |title=Bardot 'saves' Bucharest's dogs|publisher=BBC News|date=2 March 2001accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is planning to house many of these stray animals in a new animal rescue facility that she is having built on her property.

In August 2010, Bardot addressed a letter to the Queen of Denmark, [[Margrethe II of Denmark]], appealing for the sovereign to halt the [[Whaling in the Faroe Islands|killing of dolphins]] in the [[Faroe Islands]]. In the letter, Bardot describes the activity as a &quot;macabre spectacle&quot; that &quot;is a shame for Denmark and the Faroe Islands ... This is not a hunt but a mass slaughter ... an outmoded tradition that has no acceptable justification in today's world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hp3_Cignx_N58PNXB4Qirma6ofdQ Brigitte Bardot pleads to Denmark in dolphin 'slaughter'] AFP. 19 August 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 April 2011, French culture minister Frédéric Mitterrand officially inscribed bullfighting on a list enumerating the country's cultural heritage, a decision which Bardot is currently publicly contesting. &quot;French culture is a culture of enlightenment and has nothing to do with bloody things like bullfighting,&quot; she wrote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/37567/animal-lover-brigitte-bardot-lowers-her-horns-as-french-culture-ministry-embraces-bullfighting/ Animal Lover Brigitte Bardot Lowers Her Horns as French Culture Ministry Embraces Bullfighting] ARTINFO.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 1999 book ''Le Carré de Pluton'' (&quot;''Pluto's Square''&quot;), Bardot criticizes the procedure used in the [[ritual slaughter]] of sheep during the Muslim festival of [[Eid al-Adha]]. Additionally, in a section in the book entitled, &quot;Open Letter to My Lost France&quot;, Bardot writes that &quot;my country, France, my homeland, my land is again invaded by an overpopulation of foreigners, especially Muslims&quot;. For this comment, a French court fined her 30,000 [[franc]]s in June 2000. She had been fined in 1997 for the original publication of this open letter in [[Le Figaro]] and again 1998 for making similar remarks.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/793390.stm|title=Bardot fined for racist remarks|publisher=BBC News|date=16 June 2000|accessdate=13 March 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC News Bardot racism conviction upheld|date=11 May 2001|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1324707.stm|accessdate=17 January 2008|publisher=BBC News|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc4&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Bardot anti-Muslim comments draw fire|date=14 May 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3027955.stm|accessdate=17 January 2008|publisher=BBC News|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 2003 book, ''Un cri dans le silence'' (&quot;''A Scream in the Silence''&quot;), she warned of an “[[Islamicization]] of France”, and said of Muslim immigration:{{quote|Over the last twenty years, we have given in to a subterranean, dangerous, and uncontrolled infiltration, which not only resists adjusting to our laws and customs but which will, as the years pass, attempt to impose its own.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orland&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Brigitte Bardot's Cry In The Silence|date=2 September 2003|url=http://vdare.com/misc/orland_silence.htm|accessdate=14 January 2008|publisher=By David Orland}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In May 2003 the [[MRAP (French NGO)|Movement Against Racism and for Friendship between Peoples]] (MRAP) announced they would sue Bardot for the comments.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} The &quot;[[Human Rights League (French-speaking Belgium)|Ligue des droits de l'homme]]&quot; ([[Human Rights League (French-speaking Belgium)|Human Rights League]]) announced they were considering similar legal proceedings.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc4&quot;/&gt;

In the book, she also made comparisons of her close gay friends to today's homosexuals, who &quot;jiggle their bottoms, put their little fingers in the air and with their little castrato voices moan about what those ghastly [[heterosexuality|heteros]] put them through&quot; and that some contemporary homosexuals behave like &quot;fairground freaks&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/may/15/france.davidhearst|title= Anti-gay, anti-Islam Bardot to be sued|last=Webster|first=Paul|coauthors=David Hearst|date=5 May 2003|work=The Guardian|location=UK|accessdate=3 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her own defence, Bardot wrote in a letter to a French gay magazine: &quot;Apart from my husband—who maybe will cross over one day as well—I am entirely surrounded by homos.

On 10 June 2004, Bardot was again convicted by a French court for &quot;inciting racial hatred&quot; and fined €5,000, the fourth such conviction and fine from a French court.&lt;ref name=&quot;indybay&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Larent|first=Shermy|url=http://www.indybay.org/news/2003/05/1610376.php|title=Brigitte Bardot unleashes colourful diatribe against Muslims and modern France|publisher=Indybay|date=12 May 2003|accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bardot denied the racial hatred charge and apologized in court, saying: &quot;I never knowingly wanted to hurt anybody. It is not in my character.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc5&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Bardot denies 'race hate' charge|date=7 May 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/3692965.stm|accessdate=17 January 2008|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Bardot was convicted of inciting racial/religious hatred in relation to a letter she wrote, a copy of which she sent to [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] when he was [[Interior Minister of France]]. The letter stated her objections to Muslims in France [[Dhabihah|ritually slaughtering sheep]] by slitting their throats without anesthetizing them first but also said, in reference to Muslims, that she was &quot;fed up with being under the thumb of this population which is destroying us, destroying our country and imposing its habits&quot;. The trial&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brusselsjournal.com/node/3177|title=Brigitte Bardot: Heroine of Free Speech|publisher=Brusselsjournal.com|accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded on 3 June 2008, with a conviction and fine of €15,000, the largest of her fines to date. The prosecutor stated that she was tired of charging Bardot with offences related to racial hatred.&lt;ref name=&quot;race fine&quot;/&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election]], she branded the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] vice-presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]] as &quot;stupid&quot; and a &quot;disgrace to women&quot;. She criticized the former governor of [[Alaska]] for her stance on [[global warming]] and [[gun control]]. She was also offended by Palin's support for Arctic oil exploration and for her lack of consideration in protecting [[polar bears]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/sarah-palin/3158058/Brigitte-Bardot-calls-Sarah-Palin-a-disgrace-to-women.html &quot;Brigitte Bardot calls Sarah Palin a 'disgrace to women'&quot;] ''The Telegraph'' (8 October 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 August 2010, Bardot lashed out at director [[Kyle Newman]] regarding his plans to make a biographical film on her life. Her response was, &quot;Wait until I'm dead before you make a movie about my life!&quot;. Bardot warned Newman that if the project progresses &quot;sparks will fly&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;spy210115&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.showbizspy.com/article/210115/brigitte-bardot-wait-until-im-dead-before-you-make-a-movie-about-my-life.html|title=BRIGITTE BARDOT: ‘WAIT UNTIL I’M DEAD BEFORE YOU MAKE BIOPIC’|publisher=Showbiz Spy|date=14 August 2010|accessdate=21 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
[[File:Bb buzios.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Brigitte Bardot in [[Armação dos Búzios|Buzios]], Brazil]]
In fashion, the Bardot neckline (a wide open neck that exposes both shoulders) is named after her. Bardot popularized this style which is especially used for knitted sweaters or jumpers although it is also used for other tops and dresses.

Bardot is recognized for popularizing [[bikini]] swimwear in early films such as ''[[Manina, the Girl in the Bikini|Manina]]'' (''Woman without a Veil'', 1952), in her appearances at [[Cannes]] and in many photo shoots.

Bardot also brought into fashion the ''[[choucroute]]'' (&quot;Sauerkraut&quot;) hairstyle (a sort of [[beehive (hairstyle)|beehive hair style]]) and [[gingham]] clothes after wearing a checkered pink dress, designed by Jacques Esterel, at her wedding to Charrier.&lt;ref name=femstyle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.femminastyle.com/index.php?main_page=page&amp;id=9|title=Style Icon: Brigitte Bardot|publisher=Femminastyle.com|accessdate=13 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the subject for an [[Andy Warhol]] painting.

In addition to popularizing the bikini swimming suit, Bardot has also been credited with popularizing the city of [[St. Tropez]] and the town of [[Armação dos Búzios]] in Brazil, which she visited in 1964 with her boyfriend at the time, Brazilian musician [[Bob Zagury]].&lt;ref name=buzios&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buziosonline.com.br/indexe.htm |title=BuziosOnline., Character and stories.

Bardot was idolized by young [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MilesPage69&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Barry Miles{{!}}Miles, Barry]]|title=[[Many Years From Now]]|publisher=[[Vintage (publisher)|Vintage]]–[[Random House]]|year=1998|isbn=0-7493-8658-4}} pg. 69&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzp171&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Bob Spitz{{!}}Spitz, Bob]]|title=The Beatles: The Biography| publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]] (New York)| year=2005|isbn=1-84513-160-6}} pg. 171&lt;/ref&gt; They made plans to shoot a film featuring [[The Beatles]] and Bardot, similar to ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'', but the plans were never fulfilled.&lt;ref name=&quot;twolives&quot;/&gt; Lennon's first wife [[Cynthia Powell]] lightened her hair color to more closely resemble Bardot, while [[George Harrison]] made comparisons between Bardot and his first wife [[Pattie Boyd]], as Cynthia wrote later in ''A Twist of Lennon''. Lennon and Bardot met in person once, in 1968 at the Mayfair Hotel, introduced by Beatles press agent [[Derek Taylor]]; a nervous Lennon took [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]] before arriving, and neither star impressed the other. (Lennon recalled in a memoir, &quot;I was on acid, and she was on her way out.&quot;)&lt;ref name=&quot;LennonPage24&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=[[John Lennon{{!}}Lennon, John]]|title=[[Skywriting by Word of Mouth]]|publisher=[[Harper Collins]]|year=1986|isbn=0-06-015656-2}} pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt; According to the liner notes of his first (self-titled) album, musician [[Bob Dylan]] dedicated the first song he ever wrote to Bardot. He also mentioned her by name in &quot;I Shall Be Free&quot;, which appeared on his second album, ''[[The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan]]''.

She dabbled in pop music and played the role of a [[glamour model]]. In 1965, she appeared as herself in the Hollywood production ''[[Dear Brigitte]]'' (1965) starring [[James Stewart]], one of the few American films in which she appeared. She refused to travel to Hollywood to film her scene, requiring the needed cast and crew members to travel to film in Paris. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1970, sculptor [[Aslan (pin up)|Alain Gourdon]] used Bardot as the model for a bust of [[Marianne]], the French national emblem. In 2007, she was named among ''[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]'' magazine's 100 Sexiest Film Stars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empireonline.com/100sexiest/default.asp?star=98 Empireonline.com]; Retrieved 19 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The first-ever official exhibition spotlighting Bardot's influence and legacy opened in Paris on 29 September 2009 – a day after her 75th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.connexionfrance.com/expatriate-news-article.php?art=375 Brigitte Bardot at 75: the exhibition], ''The Connexion'' (September 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ms. Bardot is mentioned in The Who's Endless Wire album on a song called &quot;It's Not Enough.&quot;  The words are:
           
             Like Brigitte Bardot in Godard's Les Mepris
             I can't love you enough to make you complete
             You appear in my dreams with some new cortier
             You need me there to see
             What you need to convey, it's not enough
