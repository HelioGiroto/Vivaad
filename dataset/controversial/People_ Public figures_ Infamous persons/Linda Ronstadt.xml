==Early life==
Linda Ronstadt was born in [[Tucson, Arizona]], in 1946 to Gilbert Ronstadt (1911–1995), a prosperous machinery merchant who ran the F. Ronstadt Co.,&lt;ref name=fredronstadt&gt;{{cite web | title=Borderman: Memoirs of Federico José María Ronstadt | url=http://www.uapress.arizona.edu/BOOKS/bid1482.htm | publisher= University of Arizona Press | year=2003 | accessdate = 2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ruth Mary Copeman Ronstadt (1914–1982), a homemaker .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Linda Ronstadt: It's So Easy |last=Bego |first=Mark |year=1990 |publisher=Eakin Press |isbn=0-89015-775-8 |pages=9–11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronstadt was raised on the family's {{convert|10|acre|ha|sing=on}} ranch with siblings Peter (who served as Tucson's [[Chief of Police]] for ten years, 1981–1991), Michael J. and Gretchen (Suzi). The family was featured in ''[[Family Circle]]'' magazine in 1953.&lt;ref name=family&gt;{{cite web | title= Gilbert Ronstadt was born in 1911 | author=Deborah J.

Linda's father Gilbert came from a [[settler|pioneering]] Arizona ranching family&lt;ref name=&quot;tiptheirhat&quot;/&gt; and was of [[German American|German]] and [[English American]] descent, with some [[Mexican people|Mexican]] ancestry.&lt;ref name=tucsonsronstadtfamilyhistory&gt;{{cite web | title=Tucson's Ronstadt Family | work=The Arizona Library | url=http://parentseyes.arizona.edu/ronstadtfamily/ | accessdate = 2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their influence and contributions to Arizona's history, including wagon making, commerce, pharmacies and music, is chronicled in the library of the [[University of Arizona]].&lt;ref name=tucsonsronstadtfamily&gt;{{cite web | title= The Ronstadt Family | work=The University of Arizona Archives | url=http://www.library.arizona.edu/exhibits/ronstadt/index.html | accessdate = 2007-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linda Ronstadt's great-grandfather, graduate engineer Friedrich August Ronstadt (who went by the name Federico Augusto Ronstadt) immigrated to the [[Western United States|West]] (then a part of [[Mexico]]) in the 1840s from [[Hanover]], Germany, and married a Mexican citizen, and eventually settled in Tucson.&lt;ref name=helmut&gt;{{cite web | title=The People | work=Early Pioneers of Tucson | url=http://72.14.253.104/search?q=cache:pN4aVEzrblEJ:www.emat-tucson.org/Germany/People.html+%22Ronstadt+Transit+Center+%22+LINDA&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=8&amp;gl=us|date=September 2011| accessdate = 2007-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lindar1&gt;{{cite web | title=Songs From Her Heart | author=Don McLeese | work=Ford Times | date=June 1992 | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/fordtimes.htm | accessdate = 2006-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the City of Tucson opened its central transit terminal on March 16 and dedicated it to Linda's grandfather, local pioneer businessman [[Federico José María Ronstadt]]. Ronstadt was a wagon maker whose early contribution to the city's mobility included six mule-drawn streetcars delivered in 1903–04.&lt;ref name=fredronstadt2&gt;{{cite web | title=Tucson Opens Ronstadt Transit Center | url=http://tris.trb.org/view.aspx?type=CO&amp;id=358937 | date=August 1991 | author=Bluestein, T | accessdate = 2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her mother Ruth Mary, of German, English, and Dutch descent, was raised in the [[Flint, Michigan]], area.  She was the daughter of [[Lloyd Groff Copeman]], a prolific inventor and holder of many patents.  Lloyd, with nearly 700 patents to his name, invented an early form of the [[toaster]], many refrigerator devices, the grease gun, the first [[electric stove]], and an early form of the [[microwave oven]]. His flexible rubber [[ice cube|ice cube tray]] earned him millions of dollars in royalties.&lt;ref name=LloydCopeman&gt;{{cite web | title=LloydCopeman.com – prolific U.S. inventor | work=LloydCopeman.com | url=http://www.lloydcopeman.com/ | accessdate = 2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Establishing her professional career in the mid-1960s at the forefront of California's emerging [[folk rock]] and [[country rock]] movements, genres which later defined post-60s rock music, Linda Ronstadt joined forces with [[Bobby Kimmel]] and [[Kenny Edwards]] and became the lead singer of a successful folk rock trio, [[The Stone Poneys]]. Later, as a solo artist, she released ''[[Hand Sown ... Home Grown]]'' in 1969, which has been described as the first [[alternative country]] record by a female recording artist.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlternativeCountry&quot;&gt;{{cite web | work=Dirty Linen Issue#106| title=Linda Ronstadt Silver Threads &amp; Golden Needles | author=T.

However, with the successful release of chart-topping albums such as ''[[Heart Like a Wheel]]'', ''[[Simple Dreams]]'', and ''[[Living in the USA]]'', coupled with the fact that Ronstadt became the first female &quot;arena class&quot; rock star, setting records as one of the top-grossing concert artists of the decade, Ronstadt became a celebrity and an illustrious star of the highest magnitude&lt;ref name=&quot;doubleplatinum&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=AlternativeCountry /&gt; and the most successful female artist of her era.&lt;ref name=RocksVenusSuccess&gt;{{cite news | title=Rock's Venus takes control of her affairs. | author=Peter Herbst | work=Rolling Stone | date=October 19, 1978 | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/rolling78.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hamill&gt;{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt, Pirate Queen | work=New York Magazine | date=July 21, 1980 | author=Pete Hamill | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artny80.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070320235914/http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artny80.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = March 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rockwell&gt;{{cite book | title= Stranded—Rock and Roll for a Desert Island | editor=Greil Marcus | contribution=Living in the USA | last=Rockwell | first=John | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/desertisle.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recognized as the &quot;First Lady of Rock&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tiptheirhat&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Playboy Interview: Linda Ronstadt | author=Jean Vallely | date=April 1980 | work=Playboy | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/playboy80.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the &quot;Queen of Rock&quot;, Ronstadt was voted the Top Female Pop Singer of the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;tiptheirhat&quot;/&gt; Her rock and roll image was equally as famous as her music, appearing six times on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', as well as ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' covers. In the 1980s, Ronstadt went to Broadway, garnered a Tony nomination, teamed with composer [[Philip Glass]], recorded traditional music, and collaborated with famed conductor [[Nelson Riddle]], an event at that time viewed as an original and unorthodox move for a rock and roll artist. This venture paid off,&lt;ref name=gambleoff&gt;{{cite news | title=Ronstadt: The Gamble Pays Off Big | author=Mary Ellin Bruns | date=January 8, 1984 | newspaper=Family Weekly | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/famwkly.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ronstadt remained one of the music industry's best-selling acts throughout the 1980s with multi-platinum selling albums such as ''[[What's New (Linda Ronstadt album)|What's New]]'', ''[[Canciones de Mi Padre]]'' and ''[[Cry Like a Rainstorm, Howl Like the Wind]]''. Ronstadt has continued to successfully tour, collaborate, and record celebrated albums, such as ''[[Winter Light (Linda Ronstadt album)|Winter Light]]'', and ''[[Hummin' to Myself (Linda Ronstadt album)|Hummin' to Myself]]''. Ronstadt's thirty-plus album catalog continue to be best-sellers, with the vast majority of them certified [[Music recording sales certification|gold]], [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] and [[Music recording sales certification|multiplatinum]].&lt;ref name=certifications&gt;{{cite web | title=Joel Whitburn's The Billboard Albums | work=Linda Ronstadt's Top Pop Albums | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/toppopa.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having sold in excess of 100 million records worldwide&lt;ref name=worldwidesales&gt;{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt Record Sales Page | work= Linda Ronstadt Web Site | url=http://lindaronstadt.de/facts.htm | accessdate = 2010-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and setting records as one of the top-grossing concert performers for over a decade, Linda Ronstadt was the most successful female singer of the 1970s and stands as one of the most successful female recording artists in United States history. A consummate American artist, Ronstadt opened many doors for women in rock and roll and other musical genres by championing songwriters and musicians, pioneering her chart success onto the concert circuit, and being at the [[Avant-garde|vanguard]] of many musical movements.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlternativeCountry&quot; /&gt;

Linda Ronstadt's early family life was filled with music and tradition, which influenced the stylistic and musical choices she later made in her career. Growing up, she listened to many types of music, including [[Music of Mexico|Mexican music]], which was sung by her entire family and was a staple in her childhood.&lt;ref name=Ronstadtinterview&gt;{{cite web | title=AARP Segunda Juventud Online | work=Linda Ronstadt, The music legend opens up to AARP Segunda Juventud Online: by Anita Mabante Leach, August 2007| url=http://www.aarpsegundajuventud.org/english/entertainment/2007-AS/07AS_ronstadt.html {{dead link|date=September 2011}} | accessdate = 2007-09-16}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronstadt has remarked that everything she has recorded on her own records—rock 'n' roll, jazz, rhythm and blues, gospel, opera, country, choral, and mariachi—is all music she heard her family sing in their living room, or heard played on the radio, by the age of 10. She credits her mother for her appreciation of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] and her father for introducing her to the [[traditional pop]] and [[Great American Songbook]] repertoire that she would, in turn, help reintroduce to an entire generation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asheralbumsales&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt Interview 17 June 1998 at Linda's home in Tucson, Arizona | author=Debbie Kruger | work=debbiekruger.com | date=June 17, 1998 | url=http://www.debbiekruger.com/writer/freelance/ronstadt_transcript.html | accessdate = 2007-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=starbulletin/&gt; Early on, her singing style had been influenced by singers such as [[Lola Beltrán]] and [[Édith Piaf]]; she has called their singing and rhythms &quot;more like Greek music ...

===Beginning of professional career===
At 14, Ronstadt formed a folk trio with her brother Peter and sister Suzy. The group played coffeehouses, fraternity houses, and other small venues, billing themselves as &quot;The Union City Ramblers&quot; and &quot;The Three Ronstadts&quot;, and they even recorded themselves at a Tucson studio under the name &quot;The New Union Ramblers&quot;.&lt;ref name=producer1/&gt; Their repertoire included the music they grew up on—folk, country, bluegrass, and Mexican.&lt;ref name=ramblers&gt;{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt: The Queen of Rock &amp; Roll is also a Queen of Country Music | work=Country Music Magazine | date=October 1978 | author=Russ Barnard | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artcm78.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; But increasingly, Ronstadt wanted to make a union of folk music and rock 'n' roll,&lt;ref name=hamill /&gt; and in 1964, after a semester at college (sources differ between Tucson's [[University of Arizona]]&lt;ref name=Time /&gt; and Arizona State University&lt;ref name=ramblers /&gt;), the 17 year old decided to move to Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=LATimes&gt;{{cite journal |author=Randy Lewis |date=August 20, 2010 |title=Linda Ronstadt remembers Kenny Edwards: 'A beacon to me' |journal=Los Angeles Times |publisher=Tribune Company |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/08/linda-ronstadt-kenny-edwards.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soulful&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Claire&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Linda Ronstadt |last=Claire |first=Vivian |year=1978 |publisher=Flash Books |location=33 West 60th Street, New York 10023 |isbn=0-8256-3918-2 |page=10 |pages=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Stone Poneys===
{{Main|Stone Poneys}}
Linda visited a friend from Tucson, [[Bobby Kimmel]], in Los Angeles during Easter break from college in 1964, and later that year, shortly before her eighteenth birthday,&lt;ref name=LATimes/&gt; decided to move there permanently to form a band with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soulful&quot;/&gt; Kimmel had already begun co-writing folk-rock songs with guitarist-songwriter [[Kenny Edwards]], and eventually the three of them were signed by [[Nik Venet]] to [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] in the summer of 1966 as &quot;[[The Stone Poneys]]&quot;. The trio released three albums in a 15-month period in 1967–68: ''[[The Stone Poneys (album)|The Stone Poneys]]''; ''[[Evergreen, Volume 2]]''; and ''[[Linda Ronstadt, Stone Poneys and Friends, Vol. III]]''. The band is best known for their hit single &quot;[[Different Drum]]&quot; (written and composed by [[Michael Nesmith]] prior to his joining [[the Monkees]]), which reached No. 13 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart as well as No. 12 in ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' magazine. More than 40 years later, the song remains one of Ronstadt's most popular recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt | publisher=Rhapsody | url=http://www.rhapsody.com/#/artist/linda-ronstadt | accessdate = 2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides recording one of her most enduring songs, Linda Ronstadt was already showcasing her highly expressive performance of an eclectic mix of songs, often from under-appreciated songwriters, utilizing a wide array of backing musicians. Additionally, many of her songs, including &quot;Different Drum&quot;, were written and composed by male songwriters and had minimal lyric changes, allowing Ronstadt to toy with [[gender roles]] that were in ferment in the 1960s and 1970s. While the Stone Poneys broke up before the release of their third album, Kenny Edwards recorded and toured with Ronstadt from the mid-1970s to the mid-1980s.

(In 2008—as a testament to the continuing interest in Ronstadt's early work with this band—Australia's [[Raven Records]] released a compilation CD titled ''The Stone Poneys''. The disc features all tracks from the first two Stone Poneys albums and four tracks from the third album.)

===Solo career===
[[File:Silk23.jpg|thumb|190px|left|Linda Ronstadt, ca. 1970, on the back cover of the album ''[[Silk Purse]]''.]]
Still contractually obligated to Capitol Records, Ronstadt released her first solo album, ''[[Hand Sown ... Home Grown]]'', in 1969. It has been called the first [[alternative country]] record by a female recording artist.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlternativeCountry&quot;/&gt; During this same period, she contributed to the ''[[Music From Free Creek]]'' &quot;super session&quot; project.

Ronstadt provided the vocals for some commercials during this period, including one for [[Remington Products|Remington]] electric [[razors]], in which a multitracked Ronstadt and [[Frank Zappa]] claimed that the electric razor &quot;cleans you, thrills you ... may even keep you from getting busted&quot;.&lt;ref name=Remington&gt;{{cite web | work= The Linda Ronstadt Download Center | title= Remington Electric Razor | url=http://home.comcast.net/~westhamptonpg/razor.html | accessdate = 2007-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronstadt's second solo album, ''[[Silk Purse]]'', was released in March 1970. Recorded entirely in Nashville, it was produced by [[Elliot Mazer]], whom Ronstadt chose on the advice of [[Janis Joplin]], who had worked with him on her ''Cheap Thrills'' album.&lt;ref name=Capitol&gt;{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt's 1969–1974 Capitol Records Solo Output Presented in New 2-CD Collection, 'The Best Of Linda Ronstadt: The Capitol Years' | work=Press Release News Wire | date=November 8, 2005 | url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/11-08-2005/0004211041&amp;EDATE= | accessdate = 2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Silk Purse'' album cover showed Ronstadt in a muddy pigpen, while the back and inside cover depicted her onstage wearing bright red. Ronstadt has stated that she was not pleased with the album, although it provided her with her first solo hit, the multi-format single &quot;Long Long Time&quot;, and earned her first Grammy nomination (for Best Contemporary Vocal Performance/Female).

Several years before Ronstadt became what author Gerri Hirshey called the first &quot;arena-class rock diva&quot;, with &quot;hugely anticipated tours&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;doubleplatinum&quot;/&gt; she began her solo career touring the North American concert circuit. But being on the road took its toll both emotionally and professionally. There were few &quot;girl singers&quot; on the Rock circuit at the time, and those that were, were relegated to &quot;groupie level when in a crowd of a bunch of rock and roll guys&quot;, a status Ronstadt avoided.&lt;ref name=groupie&gt;{{cite web | work=Fusion | title= Female Rocker Roundup: Linda Ronstadt, Lynn Carey, Lydia Pense, Nansi Nevins | date=December 26, 1969 | author=Pete Senoff | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/intfus1.htm | accessdate = 2007-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relating to men on a professional level as fellow musicians led to competition, insecurity, bad romances, and a series of boyfriend-managers.

Soon after she went solo in the late 1960s, one of her first backing bands was the pioneering country-rock band [[Swampwater]], famous for synthesizing [[Cajun music|Cajun]] and swamp-rock elements into their music. Its members included Cajun [[fiddler]] [[Gib Guilbeau]] and John Beland, who later joined [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]],&lt;ref name=swamprock&gt;{{cite web | work=The Rising Storm | title= Swampwater &quot;Swampwater&quot; | author=jason | date=May 20, 2007 | url=http://therisingstorm.net/swampwater-swampwater/ | accessdate = 2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Stan Pratt, Thad Maxwell and Eric White, brother of [[Clarence White]] of [[The Byrds]].

Another backing band featured players [[Don Henley]], [[Glenn Frey]], [[Bernie Leadon]] and [[Randy Meisner]], who went on to form the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]]. They toured with her for a short period in 1971 and played on ''[[Linda Ronstadt (album)|Linda Ronstadt]]'', her self-titled third album, from which the failed single, Ronstadt's version of Browne's &quot;[[Rock Me On the Water]] was drawn. At this stage, Ronstadt began working with producer and boyfriend [[John Boylan (record producer)|John Boylan]]. She said, &quot;As soon as I started working with John Boylan, I started co-producing myself. I was always a part of my productions. But I always needed a producer who would carry out my whims.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mixmag&quot;/&gt;

====Her collaborations with Peter Asher====

|source=''[[Peter Asher]] on collaborating with Ronstadt&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldmine, No. 589, February 21, 2003&quot;/&gt;}}
Ronstadt began her fourth solo album, ''[[Don't Cry Now]]'', in 1973, with Boylan (who had negotiated her contract with [[Asylum Records]]) and [[J. D. Souther|John David &quot;J.D.&quot; Souther]] producing most of the album's tracks. But needing someone willing to work with her as an equal, Ronstadt asked [[Peter Asher]], who came highly recommended to her by [[James Taylor]]'s sister [[Kate Taylor]], to help her produce two of them: &quot;Sail Away&quot; and &quot;I Believe in You.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;producer3&quot;/&gt; The album featured Linda's first Country hit, &quot;[[Silver Threads and Golden Needles]]&quot;, which she had first recorded on ''Hand Sown ... Home Grown''; this time hitting the Country Top 20. With the release of ''Don't Cry Now'', Ronstadt took on her biggest gig to date as the opening act on [[Neil Young]]'s ''Time Fades Away'' tour, playing for larger crowds than ever before. Backstage at a concert in Texas, [[Chris Hillman]] introduced her to [[Emmylou Harris]], telling them, &quot;You two could be good friends&quot;,&lt;ref name=goldmine&gt;{{cite web | title=And then there were two...

Meanwhile, the album became Ronstadt's most successful up to this time, selling 300,000 copies by the end of 1974.&lt;ref name=producer3&gt;{{cite web | title=Rolling Stone| work=Linda Ronstadt, Heartbreak on Wheels, by Ben Fong-Torres, March 27, 1975 | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artrs75.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Asher turned out to be more collaborative, and more on the same page with her musically, than any producer she had worked with previously.&lt;ref name=producer1&gt;{{cite web | title=MIX, Magazine| work=Linda Ronstadt December 1, 2000, by Dan Daley| url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_linda_ronstadt/index.html | accessdate = 2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronstadt's professional relationship with Asher allowed her to take command and effectively delegate responsibilities in the recording studio.&lt;ref name=&quot;producer3&quot;/&gt; Although hesitant at first to work with her because of her reputation for being a &quot;woman of strong opinions (who) knew what she wanted to do (with her career)&quot;, he nonetheless agreed to become her full-time producer,&lt;ref name=&quot;negativequalities&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Peter Asher Interview by Caroline Ryder | work= [[Swindle (magazine)|''Swindle'' magazine]]| url=http://swindlemagazine.com/issueicons/peter-asher/ | accessdate = 2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and remained in that role through the late 1980s. Asher attributed the long-term success of his working relationship with Ronstadt to the fact that he was the first person to manage and produce her with whom there was a solely professional relationship. &quot;It must be a lot harder to have objective conversations about someone's career when it's someone you sleep with&quot;, he said.&lt;ref name=&quot;producer3&quot;/&gt;

Asher executive produced a tribute CD called ''[[Listen to Me: Buddy Holly]]'', released September 6, 2011, on which Ronstadt's 1976 version of [[Buddy Holly]]'s &quot;[[That'll Be The Day]]&quot; appears among newly-recorded versions of Holly's songs by various artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hangout.altsounds.com/news/132169-listen-buddy-holly-tribute-cd-sept-6th.html |title=Listen To Me: Buddy Holly Tribute CD Out Sept. 6th |date=July 26, 2011 |work=AltSounds.com |accessdate=July 26, 2011}}

Ronstadt captured the sounds of [[country music]] and the rhythms of [[ranchera]] music—which she likened in 1968 to ''&quot;Mexican bluegrass&quot;''--and redirected them into her rock 'n' roll and some of her pop music. Many of these rhythms and sounds were part of her [[Southwestern United States|Southwestern]] roots.&lt;ref name=Soulful&gt;{{cite web | title=Cleveland Scene | work=Gypsy Eyes, Interview 1968| url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artdis.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a country sound and style, a fusing of country music and rock 'n' roll called [[Country rock]], started to exert its influence on mainstream pop music around the late 1960s, and it became an emerging movement Ronstadt helped form and commercialize. However, as early as 1970, Ronstadt was being criticized by music &quot;purists&quot; for her &quot;brand of music&quot; which crossed many genres. ''Country Western Stars'' magazine wrote in 1970 that &quot;Rock people thought she was too gentle, folk people thought she was too pop, and pop people didn't quite understand where she was at, but Country people really loved Linda.&quot; She never categorized herself and stuck to her genre-crossing brand of music.

====Interpretive singer====
Ronstadt is considered an &quot;interpreter of her times&quot;,&lt;ref name=interpreter4/&gt; and has earned praise for her courage to put her own unique &quot;stamp&quot; on many of these songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeanofRock&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Chicago Sun-Times | work=`Courageous' singer plunges back into pop-music mainstream | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-3975133.html| accessdate = 2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although many of her hits were criticized for being [[cover song]]s, they were the songs the record companies elected to cull and release off the albums. More importantly, Linda Ronstadt became a highly successful &quot;Albums Artist&quot;, some of which contain material written by her.&lt;ref name=RonstadtCoProducerwhims&gt;{{cite web | title=MIX, Magazine on professional audio and music production Audio| work=Linda Ronstadt December 1, 2000, by Dan Daley| url=http://mixonline.com/mag/audio_linda_ronstadt/index.html | accessdate = 2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronstadt's natural vocal range spans several octaves from [[contralto]] to [[soprano]], and occasionally she will showcase this entire range within a single work. Ronstadt was the first female artist in popular music history to accumulate four consecutive [[platinum]] albums (fourteen certified million selling, to date). As for the singles, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' Magazine pointed out that a whole generation, &quot;but for her, might never have heard the work of artists such as [[Buddy Holly]], [[Elvis Costello]], and [[Chuck Berry]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;interpreter6&quot;/&gt;

Others have argued that Ronstadt had the same generational effect with her [[Great American Songbook]] music, exposing a whole new generation to the music of the 1920s and '30s—music which, ironically, was pushed aside because of the advent of rock 'n' roll. When interpreting, Ronstadt said she &quot;sticks to what the music demands&quot;, in terms of lyrics.&lt;ref name=Demands1&gt;{{cite web | title=Songbird Sisters: South Louisiana's Ann Savoy teams up with pop icon Linda Ronstadt for their new CD, Adieu False Heart | author=Joshua Clegg Caffery | date=July 26, 2006 | work=The Independent Weekly | url=http://www.theind.com/cover2.asp?CID=-1710469275 | accessdate = 2007-05-13 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928000105/http://www.theind.com/cover2.asp?CID=-1710469275 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining that rock and roll music is part of her culture, she says that the songs she sang after her rock and roll hits were part of her soul. &quot;The (Mariachi music) was my father's side of the soul&quot;, she was quoted as saying in a 1998 interview she gave at her Tucson home. &quot;My mother's side of my soul was the Nelson Riddle stuff.

In the 1974 book ''Rock 'N' Roll Woman'', author Katherine Orloff writes that Ronstadt's &quot;own musical preferences run strongly to rhythm and blues, the type of music she most frequently chooses to listen to ... (and) her goal is to ... be soulful too. With this in mind, Ronstadt fuses country and rock into a special union.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Soulful&quot;/&gt;

By this stage of her career, Ronstadt had established her niche in the field of country-rock. Along with other musicians such as [[The Flying Burrito Brothers]], [[Emmylou Harris]], [[Gram Parsons]], [[Swampwater]], [[Neil Young]], and the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], she helped free country music from stereotypes and showed rockers that country was OK. However, she stated that she was being pushed hard into singing more [[Rock and roll|Rock &amp; Roll]].&lt;ref name=goldmine/&gt;

====Most successful female singer of the 1970s====

In many instances, her own interpretations were more successful than the original recordings and many times new songwriters were discovered by a larger audience as a result of Ronstadt interpreting and recording their songs. Interestingly, Ronstadt had major success interpreting songs from a diverse spectrum of artists. This skill would eventually serve her later in her career, as a noted master song interpreter.

''Heart Like A Wheel''{{'s}} first single release was &quot;[[You're No Good]]&quot;—a rockified version of an R&amp;B song written by [[Clint Ballard, Jr.]] that Ronstadt had initially resisted because Andrew Gold's guitar tracks sounded too much like a &quot;Beatles song&quot; to her&lt;ref name=&quot;producer3&quot;/&gt;—climbed to No. 1 on both the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and [[Cash Box]] Pop singles charts.&lt;ref name=bronson&gt;The Billboard Book of Number 1 Hits: by Fred Bronson. ISBN 0-8230-7677-6&lt;/ref&gt; The album's second single release was &quot;[[When Will I Be Loved (song)|When Will I Be Loved]]&quot;—an uptempo Country Rock version of a Top 10 [[Everly Brothers]] song—hit No. 1 in [[Cash Box]] and No. 2 in Billboard.&lt;ref name=bronson/&gt; The song was also Linda's first No. 1 Country hit.&lt;ref name=bronson/&gt;

The album showed a physically attractive Ronstadt on the cover but, more importantly, its critical and commercial success was due to a fine presentation of country and rock with ''Heart Like A Wheel'', her first of many major commercial successes that would set her on the path to being one of the best-selling female artists of all time. Ronstadt won her first [[Grammy]] Award&lt;ref name = 1stgrammy&gt;{{cite web | title=''Grammy.com: Grammy Award Winners''| work=1975–18th Annual GRAMMY Awards| url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx | accessdate = 2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance|Best Country Vocal Performance/Female]] for &quot;I Can't Help It (If I'm Still In Love With You)&quot; which was originally a 1940s hit by [[Hank Williams]]. Ronstadt's interpretation peaked at No. 2 on the Country charts. The album itself was nominated for the Album of the Year Grammy as well as the Best Pop Vocal Performance/Female trophy.

''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine put Linda on its cover in March 1975. This was the first of six ''Rolling Stone'' magazine covers shot by photographer [[Annie Leibovitz]]. It included her as the featured artist with a full photo layout and an article by [[Ben Fong-Torres]], discussing Ronstadt's many struggling years in rock n roll, as well as her home life and what it was like to be a woman on tour in a decidedly all-male environment.

In September 1975, Linda's album ''[[Prisoner In Disguise]]'' was released. It quickly climbed into the Top Five on the Billboard Album Chart and sold over a million copies.&lt;ref name = RIAAsearch/&gt; It became her second in a row to go platinum, &quot;a grand slam&quot; in the same year (Ronstadt would eventually be the first female artist in popular music history to have three consecutive platinum albums and would ultimately go on to have eight consecutive platinum albums, and then another six between 1983 and 1990).&lt;ref name=people75/&gt; The disc's first single release was &quot;[[Love Is A Rose]]&quot;. It was climbing the Pop and Country charts but [[(Love is Like a) Heat Wave|Heat Wave]], a rockified version of the 1963 hit by [[Martha and the Vandellas]], was receiving considerable airplay. Asylum pulled the &quot;Love Is A Rose&quot; single and issued &quot;Heat Wave&quot; with &quot;Love Is A Rose&quot; on the B-side. &quot;Heat Wave&quot; hit the Top Five on Billboard's Hot 100 while &quot;Love Is A Rose&quot; hit the Top Five on Billboard's Country chart.

In 1976, Ronstadt reached the Top 3 of Billboard's Album Chart and won her second career Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for her third consecutive platinum&lt;ref name = RIAAsearch/&gt; album ''[[Hasten Down The Wind]]''. The album featured a sexy, revealing cover shot and showcased Ronstadt the singer-songwriter, who composed two of its songs, &quot;Try Me Again&quot; and &quot;Lo Siento Mi Vida&quot;. It also included an interpretation of Willie Nelson's classic &quot;Crazy&quot;, which became a Top 10 Country hit for Ronstadt in early 1977.

At the end of 1977, Ronstadt surpassed the success of ''Heart Like A Wheel'' with her album ''[[Simple Dreams]]'', which held the No. 1 position for five consecutive weeks on the Billboard Album Chart. It also knocked [[Elvis Presley]] out of No. 1 on Billboard's Country Albums chart. It sold over 3½ million copies in less than a year in the U.S. alone. The album was released in September 1977, and by December it had replaced [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s long running No. 1 album ''Rumours'' in the top spot. ''Simple Dreams'' spawned a string of hit singles on numerous charts. Among them were the [[RIAA]] platinum-certified single &quot;[[Blue Bayou]]&quot;, a Country Rock interpretation of a [[Roy Orbison]] song, &quot;It's So Easy&quot;—previously sung by Buddy Holly—and &quot;[[Poor Poor Pitiful Me]]&quot;, a song written by [[Warren Zevon]], an up and coming songwriter of the time whom Ronstadt elected to highlight and record. The album garnered several Grammy Award nominations—including Record of the Year and Best Pop Vocal Performance/Female for &quot;Blue Bayou&quot;—and won its art director, [[Kosh (art director)|Kosh]], a Grammy Award for Best Album Cover, the first of three Grammy Awards he would win for designing Ronstadt album covers.

''Simple Dreams'' became one of the singer's most successful international selling albums as well, reaching No. 1 on the Australian and Canadian Pop and Country Albums charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;international&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Ronstadt Facts, Investigative International Sales | work=Linda Ronstadt Record Sales Information Page (German Site) | url=http://lindaronstadt.de/facts.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Simple Dreams'' also made Ronstadt the most successful international female touring artist as well. The same year, she completed a highly successful concert tour around Europe. As ''Country Music Magazine'' wrote in October 1978, ''Simple Dreams'' solidified Ronstadt's role as &quot;easily the most successful female rock and roll ''and'' country star at this time.&quot;&lt;ref name=ramblers /&gt;

Also in 1977, she was asked by the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] to sing the [[U.S. National Anthem]] at game three of the [[World Series]] against the [[New York Yankees]].&lt;ref name=nationalanthem&gt;{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt Singing the National Anthem at Game three of World Series | work=YouTube | url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2DxYYwE_ezE | accessdate = 2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Time'' Magazine and Linda's 'Rock Chick' image====
Ronstadt has remarked that she felt as though she was &quot;artificially encouraged to kinda cop a really tough attitude (and be tough) because [[Rock and roll|Rock &amp; Roll]] is kind of tough (business),&quot; which she felt wasn't worn quite [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authentically]].&lt;ref name=identitycrisis&gt;{{cite web | title=Not My Job: Linda Ronstadt | publisher=NPR | url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9888452 | accessdate = 2007-05-10 | date=April 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female rock artists like her and [[Janis Joplin]], whom she described as lovely, shy and very literate in real life and the [[antithesis]] of the &quot;red hot mamma&quot; she was artificially encouraged to project, went through an [[identity crisis (psychology)|identity crisis]].&lt;ref name=identitycrisis /&gt;

[[File:RonstadtTime.jpg|thumb|190px|right|Linda Ronstadt, on the cover of the February 28, 1977, issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.]]
Eventually, Ronstadt's [[Rock and roll|Rock &amp; Roll]] image became just as famous as her music by the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldmine, No. 589, February 21, 2003&quot;/&gt; The 1977 appearance on the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine under the banner &quot;[[torch song|Torchy]] Rock&quot; was controversial for Ronstadt, considering what the image appeared to project about the most famous woman in rock.&lt;ref name=rockwell /&gt;&lt;ref name=identitycrisis /&gt; At a time in the industry when men still told women what to sing and what to wear,&lt;ref name=Asherscomment&gt;{{cite web | title=M O J O, the Rock'n'Roll Magazine| work= Homecoming Queen, April 1995| url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artmojo.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronstadt hated the image of her that was projected to the world on that cover,&lt;ref name=identitycrisis /&gt; and she noted recently how the photographer kept forcing her to wear a dress, which was an image she did not want to project&lt;ref name=identitycrisis /&gt; (although she wore a rather revealing dress for the cover of ''Hasten Down the Wind'', which projected an image of her not all that different from the Time magazine cover). In 2004, she was interviewed for [[CBS This Morning]]&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt | work=CBS News Sunday Morning December 5, 2004
Interview| url=http://www.lindaronstadt.com/files/CBSNSM/CBS_SundayAM.html | accessdate = 2007-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that this image was not her because she didn't sit like that. Asher noted, &quot;Anyone who's met Linda for 10 seconds will know that I couldn't possibly have been her [[Svengali]]. She's an extremely determined woman, in every area. To me, she was everything that feminism's about.&quot;&lt;ref name=Asherscomment/&gt; Qualities which, Asher has stated, were considered a &quot;negative (in a woman at that time), whereas in a man they were perceived as being masterful and bold&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;negativequalities&quot;/&gt; Since her solo career began, Ronstadt has fought hard to be recognized as a solo female singer in the world of rock, and her portrayal on the ''Time'' cover didn't appear to help the situation.&lt;ref name=backupband2/&gt; It was in 1976 that ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine published in its cover story an alluring collection of photographs taken by [[Annie Leibovitz]], which helped to further the image that Ronstadt later said she wasn't pleased with. Ronstadt and Asher claim to have viewed the photos prior to publication and, when their request that the photos be removed was denied, they unceremoniously threw Leibovitz out of the house.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} 

In 1978 ''Rolling Stone'' magazine declared Ronstadt, &quot;by far America's best-known female rock singer.&quot;&lt;ref name=RocksVenusSuccess/&gt; She scored a third No. 1 album on the Billboard Album Chart – unsurpassed by any female artist at this point in time – with ''[[Living In The USA]]''. Linda achieved a major hit single with &quot;[[Ooh Baby Baby]],&quot; with her rendition hitting all four major singles charts (Pop, AC, Country and R&amp;B). ''Living In The USA'' was the first album by any recording act in music history to ship double-platinum (over 2 million advance copies).&lt;ref name=&quot;doubleplatinum&quot;/&gt; The album eventually sold 3 million U.S. copies.

[[File:Living in the USAconcert.jpg|180px|thumb|left|Linda Ronstadt's promotional poster, for the 1978 ''[[Living In The USA]]'' album and concert]]

At the end of that year, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine crowned Linda Ronstadt with three No. 1 Awards for the Year: No. 1 Pop Female Singles Artist of the Year, No. 1 Pop Female Album Artist of the Year, and No. 1 Female Artist of the Year (overall).&lt;ref name=TopFemale&gt;{{cite web | work=Billboard | title=Congratulations | date=December 23, 1978 | url=http://www.lindaronstadt.com/files/pwoi/BB_23Dec1978_Congrats.html | accessdate = 2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Living In The USA'' showed the singer on roller skates with a newly short, permed hairdo on the album cover. Ronstadt continued this theme on concert tour promotional posters with photos of her on roller skates in a dramatic pose with a large [[American flag]] in the background. By this stage of her career, she was using posters to promote every album&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldmine, No. 589, February 21, 2003&quot;/&gt; and concert – which at the time were recorded live on radio or TV. Ronstadt was also featured in the 1978 film ''[[FM (film)|FM]]'', where the plot involved disc jockeys attempting to broadcast a Linda Ronstadt concert live, without a competing station's knowledge. The movie also showed Ronstadt performing the songs &quot;Poor, Poor Pitiful Me,&quot; &quot;Love Me Tender,&quot; and &quot;[[Tumbling Dice]]&quot;. Ronstadt was persuaded to record &quot;Tumbling Dice&quot; after [[Mick Jagger]] came backstage when she was at a concert and said, &quot;You do too many ballads, you should do more rock and roll songs.&quot;&lt;ref name=MickJagger&gt;{{cite web | work=The Hit Parader Interview | title=TOUR REFLECTIONS AND SIMPLE DREAMS | date=March 1978 | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/arthp78.htm | accessdate = 2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the success of ''Living in the USA'', Ronstadt conducted successful album promotional tours and concerts. Ronstadt made a guest appearance onstage with [[The Rolling Stones]] at the Tucson Community Center on July 21, 1978, in her hometown of Tucson, where Ronstadt and [[Mick Jagger]] sang &quot;Tumbling Dice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Ronstadt and Rolling Stones, July 21, 1978| work=Photos| url=http://www.iorr.org/talk/read.php?1,1222215,1222980| accessdate = 2010-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Ronstadt Rolling Stones, July 21, 1978 | work= Rolling Stone tour dates 21/07/1978 Community Center&amp;nbsp;— Tucson

I didn't have a trace of stage fright. I'm scared to death all the way through my own shows. But it was too much fun to get scared. He's so silly onstage, he knocks you over.

By the end of 1978, Ronstadt had solidified her role as one of rock and pop's most successful solo female acts, and owing to her consistent platinum album success, and her ability as the first-ever woman to sell out concerts in arenas and stadiums hosting tens of thousands of fans,&lt;ref name=&quot;tiptheirhat&quot;/&gt; Ronstadt became the &quot;highest paid woman in rock&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;doubleplatinum&quot;/&gt;{{dead link|date=May 2012}} She had six platinum certified albums, three of which went to No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' album chart, and numerous charted Pop singles.

As ''Rolling Stone'' magazine dubbed her &quot;Rock's Venus&quot;,&lt;ref name=RocksVenusSuccess/&gt; her record sales continued to multiply and set ''records'' themselves. By 1979, Ronstadt had collected eight [[Gold album|gold]], six platinum and four multi-platinum certifications for her albums, an unprecedented feat at the time. Her 1976 ''[[Greatest Hits (Linda Ronstadt)|Greatest Hits]]'' album would sell consistently for the next 25 years and in 2001 was certified by the [[RIAA]] for 7 times platinum&lt;ref name=RIAAsearch/&gt; (over 7 million U.S. copies sold). In 1980, ''[[Greatest Hits (Linda Ronstadt)|Greatest Hits Volume II]]'' was released and certified platinum.&lt;ref name=RIAAsearch/&gt;

In 1979, Ronstadt went on a successful international tour, playing in arenas across Australia to Japan, including the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] in [[Melbourne, Australia]] and the [[Nippon Budokan|Budokan]] in [[Tokyo, Japan]]. She also participated in a benefit concert for her friend [[Lowell George]], held at [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]], in Los Angeles.

By the end of the decade, Ronstadt had outsold her female competition; no other female artist to date had five straight platinum LPs: ''[[Hasten Down the Wind]]'', and ''[[Heart Like a Wheel]]'' among them.&lt;ref name=PeopleMagazine&gt;{{cite web | title=People | work= On the Charts and in Men's Hearts Linda Ronstadt is  No. 1 With a Bullet | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artpeo77.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''US Magazine'' reported in 1978, that Linda Ronstadt, [[Stevie Nicks]], [[Carly Simon]] and [[Joni Mitchell]] had become &quot;The Queens of Rock&quot;&lt;ref name=USRonstadt/&gt; and 'Rock is no longer exclusively male. There is a new royalty ruling today's record charts'.&lt;ref name=USRonstadt/&gt;

She would go on to parlay her mass commercial appeal with major success in interpreting [[The Great American Songbook]], made famous a generation before by [[Frank Sinatra]], and [[Ella Fitzgerald]] and later the Mexican folk songs of her childhood.

|quote=&quot;Rampant eclecticism is my middle name. &quot;|source=Linda Ronstadt&lt;ref name=Windy/&gt;}}In 1980 Ronstadt recorded ''[[Mad Love (Linda Ronstadt album)|Mad Love]]'', her seventh consecutive platinum selling album. ''[[Mad Love (Linda Ronstadt album)|Mad Love]]'' is a straightforward [[Rock and roll|Rock &amp; Roll]] album with post-punk, new wave influences, including tracks by songwriters such as Elvis Costello, [[The Cretones]], and musician Mark Goldenberg who played on the record himself. She also made the cover of ''Rolling Stone Magazine'' for a record-setting sixth time. ''[[Mad Love (Linda Ronstadt album)|Mad Love]]'' entered the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Album Chart in the Top Five its first week (a record at that time) and climbed to the No. 3 position. The project continued her streak of Top 10 hits with &quot;How Do I Make You?&quot;, originally recorded by [[Billy Thermal]], and &quot;Hurt So Bad&quot;, originally a Top 10 hit for [[Little Anthony &amp; the Imperials]]. The album earned Ronstadt a 1980 [[Grammy Award]] nomination for Best Rock Vocal Performance/Female (although she lost to [[Pat Benatar]]'s ''[[Crimes of Passion]]'' album). Benatar praised Linda Ronstadt by stating, &quot;There are a lot of good female singers around. How could I be the best?

[[File:Pirates-of-penzance-DVDcover.jpg|thumb|140px|right|[[Rex Smith]], Linda Ronstadt and Kevin Kline, ca. 1980, from the Central Park production of ''The Pirates of Penzance''.]]

In the summer of 1980 Ronstadt began rehearsals for the first of several leads in Broadway musicals. [[Joseph Papp]] cast her as the lead in the [[New York Shakespeare Festival]] production of [[Gilbert and Sullivan]]'s ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'', alongside [[Kevin Kline]].&lt;ref name=Pirates&gt;{{cite web | title=Hit Parader | work=Rock Queen Conquers Broadway And Lives Happily Ever After, September 1981|url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/arthp81.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She said singing ''Gilbert and Sullivan'' was a natural choice for her, since her grandfather Fred Ronstadt was credited with having created [[Tucson]]'s first orchestra, the ''Club Filarmonico Tucsonense'', and had once created an arrangement of ''The Pirates of Penzance''.&lt;ref name=GilbertandSullivan&gt;{{cite web | title=AARP Segunda Juventud Online | work=Linda Ronstadt, The music legend opens up to AARP Segunda Juventud Online, By Anita Mabante Leach, August 2007| url=http://www.aarpsegundajuventud.org/english/entertainment/2007-AS/07AS_ronstadt.html | accessdate = 2007-09-16}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Pirates of Penzance'' opened for a limited engagement in New York City's [[Central Park]], eventually moving its production to Broadway, where it became a major hit, running from January 8, 1981, to November 28, 1982.&lt;ref name=imbd&gt;{{cite web | title=IBDB Internet Broadway Database, an official database presented by The League of American Theatres and Producers, Inc.

Ronstadt received a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for the role in the movie version. She garnered a [[Tony Award]] nomination for [[Tony Award for Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical|Best Performance by a Leading Actress in a Musical]] and ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' won several Tony Awards, including a [[Tony Award for Best Revival]].

As a child, Ronstadt had discovered ''[[La Bohème]]'' through the silent movie with [[Lillian Gish]] and was determined to someday play the part of Mimi. When she met the late opera superstar [[Beverly Sills]], she was told, ''&quot;My dear, ''every'' soprano in the world wants to play Mimi!&quot;'' In 1984 Ronstadt was cast in the role at Joseph Papp's Public Theatre. However, the production was a critical and commercial disaster, closing after only a few nights.&lt;ref name=Mimi&gt;{{cite web | title=Newsweek | work=A Pop Star Goes Puccini by Jack Kroll, December 10, 1984|url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artnw84.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988 Ronstadt would return to Broadway for a limited-run engagement in the musical show adaptation of her album celebrating her Mexican heritage, ''Canciones De Mi Padre—A Romantic Evening In Old Mexico''.&lt;ref name=imbd2&gt;{{cite web | title=IBDB Internet Broadway Database| work=Linda Ronstadt's Canciones|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.asp?ID=4514| accessdate = 2007-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982 Ronstadt released ''[[Get Closer (Linda Ronstadt album)|Get Closer]]''—a primarily rock album with some country and pop music as well. It remains her only album between 1975 and 1990 not to be officially certified Platinum. It peaked at No. 31 on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Album Chart. The release continued her streak of Top 40 hits with &quot;Get Closer&quot; and &quot;[[I Knew You When]]&quot;—a 1965 hit by [[Billy Joe Royal]]—while the Jimmy Webb song &quot;Easy For You To Say&quot; was a surprise Top 10 Adult Contemporary hit in the spring of 1983. &quot;Sometimes You Just Can't Win&quot; was released to country radio, and made it to No. 27 on that listing. Linda also filmed several music videos for this album which became popular on the fledgling MTV cable channel. The album earned Ronstadt two [[Grammy]] Award nominations: one for Best Rock Vocal Performance/Female for the title track and another for Best Pop Vocal Performance/Female for the album. The artwork won its art director, [[Kosh (art director)|Kosh]], his second Grammy Award for [[Grammy Award for Best Recording Package|Best Album Package]].

Along with the release of her ''Get Closer'' album, Ronstadt embarked on a very successful North American tour, remaining one of the top rock concert draws that summer and fall. On November 25, 1982, Linda's 'Happy Thanksgiving Day' concert was held at the [[Reunion Arena]] in Dallas and broadcast live via satellite on radio stations across the United States.&lt;ref name=dallas&gt;{{cite web | title=Billboard Magazine| work=Linda Ronstadt's promo ad for live Dallas radio concert broadcast|url=http://www.lindaronstadt.com/files/scans/1982_dallas_radio_concert.jpg| accessdate=November 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Artistic aspirations===
Ronstadt has remarked that in the beginning of her career &quot;(she) ... was so focused on folk, rock and country that..(she) got a bit bored and started to branch out, and ...

Ronstadt eventually tired of playing arenas.&lt;ref name=identitycrisis/&gt; She had ceased to feel that arenas, where people milled around smoking marijuana cigarettes and drinking beer, were &quot;appropriate places for music.&quot; She wanted ''&quot;angels in the architecture&quot;''—a reference to a lyric in the [[Paul Simon]] song &quot;[[You Can Call Me Al]]&quot; from the 1986 album ''[[Graceland (album)|Graceland]]''. (Ronstadt sang harmony with Simon on a different ''Graceland'' track, &quot;Under African Skies.&quot; The lyrics pay tribute to Ronstadt: &quot;Take this child, Lord, from Tucson, Arizona....&quot;) Ronstadt has said she wants to sing in places similar to the [[Theatre of ancient Greece]], where the attention is focused on the stage and performer.&lt;ref name=angels&gt;{{cite web | title= The Gazette |work=Great musicians and their legions of paying fans deserve a great venue| url=http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=3d66e8e0-b5c8-4106-a56b-95d023c067c3 | accessdate = 2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronstadt's recording output in the 1980s proved to be just as commercially and critically successful as her 1970s recordings. Between 1983 and 1990 Ronstadt scored six additional platinum albums; two of these have been certified triple platinum (each with over 3 million U.S. copies sold); one has been certified double platinum (over two million copies sold); and one has earned additional certification as a Gold (over 500,000 U.S. copies sold) double disc album.&lt;ref name=&quot;certifications&quot;/&gt;

By recording [[Traditional pop]], [[Old-time music|Traditional country]], [[Latin American music|Traditional Latin roots]], and [[Adult Contemporary]], Ronstadt resonated with a different fan base and diversified her appeal.

====Jazz/pop trilogy====
In 1981 Linda Ronstadt produced and recorded an album of jazz and pop standards (later marketed in [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] form) titled ''Keeping Out of Mischief'' with the assistance of producer [[Jerry Wexler]]. However, Ronstadt's displeasure with the final result led her, with regrets, to scrap the project. &quot;Doing that killed me&quot;, she said in a ''Time'' magazine interview.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time interview&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Time magazine | work=Linda Leads The Band

 | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artdb85.htm| accessdate = 2008-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Ronstadt had to somehow convince her reticent record company, [[Elektra Records]], to [[greenlight]] this type of album under her contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;lindaronstadtwithnelsonrddle&quot; /&gt;

By 1983 Ronstadt had enlisted the help of 62-year-old conductor and master of jazz/traditional pop orchestration, [[Nelson Riddle]]. The two embarked on an unorthodox and original approach to rehabilitating the [[Great American Songbook]], recording a trilogy of highly successful [[jazz]]/ [[traditional pop]] albums: ''[[What's New (Linda Ronstadt album)|What's New]]'' (1983—U.S. 3.7 million as of 2010); ''[[Lush Life (Linda Ronstadt album)|Lush Life]]'' (1984—U.S. 1.7 million as of 2010); and ''[[For Sentimental Reasons (Linda Ronstadt album)|For Sentimental Reasons]]'' (1986—U.S. 1.3 million as of 2010). The three albums have a combined sales total of nearly 7 million copies in the United States alone.

The album design for ''What's New'' by designer [[Kosh (art director)|Kosh]] was unlike any of her previous disc covers. It showed Ronstadt in a vintage dress lying on shimmering satin sheets with a [[Walkman]] headset. At the time, Ronstadt received some chiding for both the album cover and her venture into what was then considered &quot;elevator music&quot; by cynics, but remained determined to record with Nelson Riddle, and ''What's New'' became a hit. The album was released in September 1983, it spent 81 weeks on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Album Chart and held the No. 3 position for a month and a half (held out of the top spot by [[Michael Jackson]]'s '[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]' and Lionel Richie's 'Can't Slow Down') and the [[RIAA]] [[certified]] it triple platinum&lt;ref name = RIAAsearch/&gt; (over 3 million U.S. copies sold alone). The album earned Ronstadt another [[Grammy]] nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, and critical raves, with ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine calling it &quot;one of the gutsiest, most unorthodox and unexpected albums of the year&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeWhatsNewReview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=

Ronstadt faced considerable pressure not to record ''What's New'' or record with Riddle. According to [[jazz]] historian [[Peter Levinson]], author of the book ''[[September In The Rain]]—a Biography on Nelson Riddle'', Joe Smith, president of [[Elektra Records]], was terrified that the Nelson Riddle album would turn off Ronstadt's rock audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;lindaronstadtwithnelsonrddle&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Jerry Jazz Musician | work=The Peter Levinson Interview | url=http://www.jerryjazzmusician.com/mainHTML.cfm?page=levinson.html | accessdate = 2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linda did not completely turn her back on her rock and roll past, however; the video for the title track featured [[Danny Kortchmar]] as the old beau that she bumped into during a rainstorm.

''What's New'' brought Nelson Riddle to a younger audience. According to Levinson, &quot;the younger audience hated what Riddle had done with [[Frank Sinatra]],&lt;ref name=nelsonriddle&gt;{{cite web | title=''Id'' | work=Interview | url=http://www.jerryjazzmusician.com/mainHTML.cfm?page=levinson.html | accessdate = 2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; which in 1983 was considered 'Vintage Pop.'&quot; Working with Ronstadt, Riddle brought his career back into focus in the last three years of his life.&lt;ref name=nelsonriddle/&gt; Stephen Holden of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, ''What's New'' &quot;isn't the first album by a rock singer to pay tribute to the golden age of the pop, but is ... the best and most serious attempt to rehabilitate an idea of pop that [[Beatlemania]] and the mass marketing of rock LPs for teenagers undid in the mid-60s.... In the decade prior to Beatlemania, most of the great band singers and crooners of the 40s and 50s codified a half-century of American pop standards on dozens of albums ... many of them now long out-of-print.&quot;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=The New York Times | title=Linda Ronstadt Celebrate the Golden Age of Pop | author=Stephen Holden | date=September 4, 1983 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/04/arts/linda-ronstadt-celebrates-the-golden-age-of-pop.html | accessdate = 2007-05-10 | date=February 7, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''What's New'' is the first album by a rock singer to have major commercial success in rehabilitating the [[Great American Songbook]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

In 1984 Ronstadt and Nelson Riddle performed these songs live, in [[concert halls]] throughout Australia, Japan and the United States, including multi-night performances at historic venues [[Carnegie Hall]], [[Radio City Music Hall]] and [[Pine Knob]].

In 2004 Ronstadt released ''[[Hummin' to Myself (Linda Ronstadt album)|Hummin' to Myself]]'', her album for [[Verve Records]]. It was her first foray into [[traditional jazz]] since her sessions with Jerry Wexler and her records with the Nelson Riddle Orchestra, but this time with an intimate [[jazz]] [[musical ensemble|combo]]. The album was a quiet affair for Ronstadt, giving few interviews and making only one television performance as promotion. It reached No. 2 on Billboard's Top Jazz Albums chart but peaked at No. 166 on the main Billboard album chart. Not having the mass distribution that [[Warner Music]] gave her, ''Hummin' To Myself'' had sold over 75,000 copies in the U.S. as of 2010—which is quite successful for a small record label like Verve Records. It also achieved some critical acclaim from the jazz cognoscenti.&lt;ref name=&quot;JazzTimes2&quot;/&gt;

====&quot;Trio&quot; recordings====

In 1978, Ronstadt, [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Emmylou Harris]], friends and admirers of one another's work (Ronstadt had included a cover of Parton's &quot;[[I Will Always Love You]]&quot; on ''Prisoner in Disguise'') attempted to collaborate on a ''Trio'' album. Unfortunately, the attempt was not successful. Ronstadt later remarked that not too many people were in control at the time and everyone was too involved with their own careers. (Though the efforts to complete the album were abandoned, a number of the more successful recordings were included on the singers' respective solo recordings over the next few years.) This concept album was put on the back burner for almost ten years.

In January 1986, the three eventually did make their way into the recording studio, where they spent the next several months working. The result, ''[[Trio (Dolly Parton, Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris album)|Trio]]'', which they had conceived ten years earlier, was released in March 1987. It was a considerable hit, holding the No. 1 position on Billboard's Country Albums chart for five weeks running and hitting the Top 10 on the Pop side also. Selling over three million U.S. copies and winning them a Grammy Award for Best Country Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal, it produced four Top Ten Country singles including &quot;To Know Him Is To Love Him&quot; which hit No.&amp;nbsp;1. The album was also a nominee for overall Album of the Year, in the company of Michael Jackson, U2, Prince, and Whitney Houston.

In 1994, the three performers recorded a follow-up to ''Trio''. As was the case with their aborted 1978 effort, conflicting schedules and competing priorities delayed the album's release indefinitely. Ronstadt, who had already paid for studio time—and owed her record company a finished album—removed Dolly's individual tracks at her request, kept Emmylou's vocals on, and produced a number of the recordings, which she subsequently released on her 1995 return to Country Rock, ''Feels Like Home''.

However, in 1999, Ronstadt, Parton and Harris agreed to release the ''[[Trio II]]'' album, as was originally recorded in 1994. It included an ethereal cover of [[Neil Young]]'s &quot;After The Gold Rush&quot; which became a popular music video. The effort was certified Gold (over 500,000 copies sold) and won them a Grammy Award for Best Country Collaboration with Vocals for the track. Ronstadt co-produced the album with [[George Massenburg]] and the three ladies also received a Grammy Nomination for Best Country Album.

====Canciones—songs of the Ronstadt family====
At the end of 1987, Ronstadt released an album of traditional Mexican folk songs, or what she describes as ''&quot;world class songs&quot;'', titled ''[[Canciones de Mi Padre]]''. Keeping with the Ronstadt history theme, her cover art was dramatic, bold, and colorful. For ''Canciones De Mi Padre'', Ronstadt was in full Mexican regalia, and her musical arranger was famed Mariachi musician [[Rubén Fuentes]].

These ''canciones'' were a big part of Ronstadt's family tradition and musical roots. For example, the history of this album goes back half a century. In January 1946, the [[University of Arizona]] published a booklet by Luisa Espinel entitled ''Canciones de mi Padre''.&lt;ref name=MyFathersSongs&gt;{{cite web | title=Tucson'sRonstadtFamily | work=The
Arizona Library | url=http://parentseyes.arizona.edu/ronstadtfamily/music/cancintr.html | accessdate = 2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luisa Espinel, Ronstadt's aunt, was herself an international singer in the 1920s and 1930s. Ms. Espinel's father was Fred Ronstadt, Linda's grandfather, and the songs she had learned, transcribed and published were some of the ones he had brought with him from [[Sonora]]. Ronstadt researched and extracted from the favorites she had learned from her father Gilbert and she called her album by the same name as her aunt's booklet and as a tribute to her father and his family. Though not fully bilingual, she has a fairly good command of the Spanish language, allowing her to sing Latin American songs with little discernible Anglo accent; Ronstadt has often identified herself as Mexican-American.&lt;ref name=MexAm&gt;{{cite web | title=American Way | work=Linda Ronstadt's New Old Flame- Mexican Music| url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artamway.htm| accessdate = 2007-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her formative years were spent with her father's side of the family.&lt;ref name=rollingstone&gt;{{cite web | title=Rolling Stone | work=The

Also, Ronstadt has credited Mexican singer [[Lola Beltrán]] as an influence in her own singing style, and she recalls how a frequent guest to the Ronstadt home, [[Lalo Guerrero|Eduardo &quot;Lalo&quot; Guerrero]], father of [[Chicano]] music, would often [[serenade]] her as a child.&lt;ref name=&quot;GilbertandSullivan&quot;/&gt;

This album won Ronstadt a Grammy Award for Best Mexican-American Performance. The real achievement, however, is the disc's [[RIAA]] double-platinum&lt;ref name=RIAAsearch/&gt; (over 2 million U.S. copies sold) certification—making it the biggest-selling non-English language album in U.S. music history. Another achievement is that the album and later theatrical stage show, served as a benchmark of Latin cultural renaissance in North America.

Ronstadt produced and performed a theatrical stage show in [[concert halls]] across the United States and Latin America to both Hispanic and non-Hispanic audiences, including on the [[Great White Way]]. She called the stage show by the same name ''Canciones de mi Padre''. These performances were released on DVD. Ronstadt elected to return to the Broadway stage, 4 years after she performed in ''La Bohème'', for a limited run engagement. [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] Great Performances aired the celebrated stage show during its annual fund drives and the show was a hit with audiences, earning Ronstadt an [[Emmy Award]] for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Individual Performance In A Variety Or Music Program|Individual Performance In A Variety Or Music Program]].

Linda later recorded two additional discs of Latin music in the early 1990s. Although their promotion, like most of her albums in the 1990s, were a quieter affair for Ronstadt, where she appeared to do the &quot;bare minimum&quot; to promote them. They were not nearly as successful as ''Canciones De Mi Padre'', but were critically acclaimed in some circles. In 1991 she released ''[[Mas Canciones]]'', a follow up to the first ''Canciones''. For this effort she won a Grammy award for [[Grammy Award for Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album|Best Mexican/Mexican-American Album]]. The following year she stepped outside of the Mariachi genre and decided to record well known &quot;afro-Cuban&quot; songs. This disc was titled ''[[Frenesí (album)|Frenesí]]''. Like her two previous Latin recordings ventures, this third Latin album won Ronstadt another Grammy award, this time for [[Grammy Award for Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album|Best Traditional Tropical Latin Album]].

In 1991 Ronstadt acted in the lead role of arch angel San Miguel in ''La Pastorela'', or ''A Shephard's Tale'', a musical filmed at ''San Juan Bautista''. It was written and directed by Luis Valdez. The production was part of the PBS &quot;Great Performances&quot; series.

====Returning to the contemporary music scene====
By the late 1980s, while enjoying the success of her big band jazz collaborations with Nelson Riddle and her surprise hit Mariachi recordings, Linda Ronstadt elected to return to recording mainstream pop music once again. In 1987 she made a return to the top of ''Billboard'' Hot 100 singles chart with &quot;[[Somewhere Out There (James Horner song)|Somewhere Out There]]&quot;, which peaked at No. 2 in March.&lt;ref name=bronson/&gt; Featured in the animated film ''[[An American Tail]]'', the sentimental duet with [[James Ingram]] was nominated for several Grammy Awards, ultimately winning &quot;Song of the Year.&quot; It also received an [[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Motion Picture song and achieved high sales, earning a million-selling Gold single in the U.S.—one of the last 45s ever to do so. It was also accompanied by a popular music video. On the heels of this success, [[Steven Spielberg]] asked Ronstadt to record the theme song for the animated sequel titled ''[[An American Tail: Fievel Goes West]]'', which was titled &quot;Dreams To Dream.&quot; Although &quot;Dreams To Dream&quot; failed to achieve the success of &quot;Somewhere Out There&quot;, the song did give Ronstadt an Adult Contemporary hit in 1991.

In 1989, Ronstadt released a mainstream pop album and several popular singles. This effort, titled ''[[Cry Like A Rainstorm, Howl Like The Wind]]'', became one of the singer's most successful albums—in terms of production, arrangements, chart sales, and critical acclaim. It became Ronstadt's ''tenth'' Top 10 album on the Billboard chart, reaching the No. 7 position and being certified triple-platinum&lt;ref name=RIAAsearch/&gt; (over 3 million U.S. copies sold). The album also garnered critical acclaim, receiving numerous Grammy nominations and being praised by [[Amazon.com]] as &quot;an album that defines virtually everything that is right about adult contemporary pop.&quot;&lt;ref name=CryReview&gt;{{cite web |title=Review | work=Amazon.com essential recording |url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002H7E | accessdate = 2008-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linda featured New Orleans soul singer [[Aaron Neville]] on several of the twelve disc cuts.

Ronstadt incorporated the sounds of the Oakland Interfaith Gospel Choir, [[Tower of Power]] horns, the [[Skywalker Symphony]] and numerous musicians. It had duets, including &quot;[[Don't Know Much]]&quot; (''Billboard'' Hot 100 No. 2 hit—Christmas 1989&lt;ref name=bronson/&gt;) and &quot;[[All My Life (Linda Ronstadt song)|All My Life]]&quot; (Billboard Hot 100 No. 11 hit), both of which were long-running No. 1 Adult Contemporary hits. These duets with [[Aaron Neville]] received much critical acclaim, earning several Grammy nominations. The duo won both the 1989 and 1990 Best Pop Vocal Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal awards. Linda's last known live Grammy Award appearance was in 1990 when she and Neville performed &quot;Don't Know Much&quot; together on the telecast.&lt;ref name=kqed/&gt; (&quot;Whenever I sing with a different artist, I can get things out of my voice that I can't do by myself&quot;, Ronstadt reflected in 2007. &quot;I can do things with Aaron that I can't do alone.&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Home grown&quot; by Ron Thibodeaux, The Times-Picayune, New Orleans, La., Feb. 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1990, Linda Ronstadt participated in a concert held at the [[Tokyo Dome]] to commemorate [[John Lennon]]'s 50th birthday, and to raise awareness of environmental issues. Other participants included [[Miles Davis]], [[Lenny Kravitz]], [[Hall &amp; Oates]], [[Natalie Cole]], Japanese artists, [[Yoko Ono]] and [[Sean Lennon]]. A CD resulted, titled ''Happy Birthday, John''.&lt;ref name=Lennon&gt;{{cite web | title=Tokyo Dome | work=Concert to commemorate John Lennon's 50th birthday | url=http://www.jeclique.com/onoweb/dreampower2001.html | accessdate = 2007-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A return to roots music===
Continuing with her crafted approach to more mainstream-oriented material, Ronstadt released the highly acclaimed ''[[Winter Light (Linda Ronstadt album)|Winter Light]]'' album at the end of 1993. It included New Age arrangements such as the lead single &quot;Heartbeats Accelerating&quot; as well as the self-penned title track and featured the unique glass armonica instrument. But alas, it was Linda's first commercial failure since 1972, and peaked at a disappointing No. 92 in Billboard, whereas 1995's ''[[Feels Like Home (Linda Ronstadt album)|Feels Like Home]]'' was Ronstadt's much heralded return to Country-Rock and included her version of [[Tom Petty]]'s classic hit &quot;[[The Waiting (song)|The Waiting]].&quot; The single's rollicking, fiddle-infused flip side, &quot;Walk On&quot;, returned Linda to the Country Singles chart for the first time since 1983. An album track entitled &quot;The Blue Train&quot; charted 10 weeks in Billboard's Adult Contemporary Top 40. This album fared slightly better than its predecessor, reaching No.&amp;nbsp;75. Both albums were later deleted from the Elektra/Asylum catalog.

In 1996 Ronstadt produced ''[[Dedicated to the One I Love (album)|Dedicated to the One I Love]]'', an album of classic [[Rock and Roll|rock 'n roll]] songs reinvented as [[lullabies]]. The disc reached No. 78 in Billboard. Ronstadt was awarded a Grammy in the [[Grammy Award for Best Musical Album for Children|Best Musical Album for Children]] category.

In 1998 Ronstadt released ''[[We Ran]]'', her first album in over two years. The disc harkened back to Ronstadt's country-rock and folk-rock heyday. She returned to her ''rock 'n' roll'' roots with vivid interpretations of songs by [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[Doc Pomus]], [[Bob Dylan]] and [[John Hiatt]]. The recording was produced by [[Glyn Johns]]. A commercial failure, the album stands—at 60,000 copies sold at the time of its deletion in 2008—as the poorest selling studio album in Linda's Elektra/Asylum catalogue. ''We Ran'' did not chart any singles but it was well received by critics.

Despite the lack of success of ''We Ran'', Ronstadt kept towards this adult rock exploration. She released ''[[Western Wall: The Tucson Sessions]]'' in the summer of 1999—a folk-rock oriented project with EmmyLou Harris. It earned a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary Folk Album, and made the Top 10 of Billboard's Country Albums chart (#73 on the main Billboard album chart). However, it would sell roughly half the number of copies that ''[[Trio II]]'' sold and had gone out of print as of December 2010.

Also in 1999, Ronstadt went back to her concert roots, when she performed with the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]] and [[Jackson Browne]] at [[Staples Center]]'s 1999 New Year's Eve celebration kicking off the December 31 end-of-the-[[millennium]] festivities. As Staples Center Senior Vice President and General Manager Bobby Goldwater said, &quot;It was our goal to present a spectacular event as a sendoff to the 20th century&quot;, and &quot;Eagles, Jackson Browne, and Linda Ronstadt are three of the most popular acts of the century. Their performances will constitute a singular and historic night of entertainment for New Year's Eve in Los Angeles.&quot;&lt;ref name=NewYearsEve&gt;{{cite web | title=Eagles to Perform at Staples Center | work=New Year's Eve| url=http://www.staplescenter.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=103445&amp;itype=&amp;iCategoryID=0| accessdate = 2007-06-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928135754/http://www.staplescenter.com/news/fullstory.sps?iNewsid=103445&amp;itype=&amp;iCategoryID=0 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 Linda Ronstadt completed her long contractual relationship with the [[Elektra Records|Elektra/Asylum]] Records label. The fulfillment of this contract commenced with the release of ''[[A Merry Little Christmas (Linda Ronstadt album)|A Merry Little Christmas]]'', Linda's first holiday collection, which included rare choral works, the somber [[Joni Mitchell]] song &quot;River&quot;, and a rare recorded duet with the late [[Rosemary Clooney]] on her (Clooney's) signature song, &quot;[[White Christmas (song)|White Christmas]]&quot;.
Since leaving Warner Music, Ronstadt has gone on to release one album each under the [[Verve Records|Verve]] and [[Vanguard Records|Vanguard]] Record labels.

In 2006, recording as the ZoZo Sisters, Ronstadt teamed with her then-new friend, musician and musical scholar [[Ann Savoy]], to record ''[[Adieu False Heart]]''. It was an album of roots music incorporating pop, Cajun, and early 20th century music and released on the [[Vanguard Records]] label. But ''[[Adieu False Heart]]'' was a commercial failure, peaking at No. 146 in the U.S., and stands as the latest Linda Ronstadt album as of 2012.

''Adieu False Heart'', recorded in [[Louisiana]], features a cast of local musicians, including Chas Justus, Eric Frey and Kevin Wimmer of the Red Stick Ramblers, Sam Broussard of The Mamou Playboys, Dirk Powell and Joel Savoy, as well as an array of Nashville musicians: fiddler Stuart Duncan, mandolinist Sam Bush and guitarist Bryan Sutton. The recording earned two Grammy nominations: Best Traditional Folk Album and Best Engineered Album, Non-Classical.

In 2007 Ronstadt could be heard on the compilation LP ''[[We All Love Ella: Celebrating the First Lady of Song]]''--a tribute album to jazz music's all-time most heralded artist—on the track &quot;Miss Otis Regrets.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-r/lindaronstadt.htm Rock On The Net—Linda Ronstadt]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the summer of 2007 Ronstadt headlined the [[Newport Folk Festival]], making her debut at this prestigious event, where she incorporated jazz, rock and folk music into her repertoire.

==Personal life==
Beginning in the mid-1970s, Linda Ronstadt's private life was given major publicity. It was fueled by a relationship with then-Governor of California [[Jerry Brown]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[presidential candidate]]. They shared a ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine cover in April 1979.&lt;ref name=Newsweek&gt;{{cite web | title=Newsweek | work=The Pop Politics of Jerry Brown| url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/newsweek79.htm| accessdate = 2006-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also made the cover of ''[[Us Weekly]]'' magazine. Ronstadt and Brown took a trip to Africa which became fodder for the international press, and they made the cover of ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine. In the mid-1980s, Ronstadt was engaged to ''[[Star Wars]]'' director [[George Lucas]].&lt;ref name=Engaged&gt;{{cite web | title=US Magazine| work= Linda Ronstadt Checking in with the ex-flower child at home in Tucson: by Jonathan Schwartz | url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artus00.htm| accessdate = 2007-05-05 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071008113244/http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/artus00.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1990, she adopted an infant daughter, Mary Clementine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fink|first=Mitchell|title=The Insider|journal=People Weekly|date=September 16, 1991|volume=1991|issue=33|page=33|quote=Singer Linda Ronstadt quietly became a single parent earlier this year.

In the early 1980s, Ronstadt was criticized by some (mainly rock critics) for playing two concerts, as a replacement for [[Frank Sinatra]], in [[South Africa under apartheid]], at a time when [[Ray Charles]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[Tina Turner]], Sinatra, [[Shirley Bassey]] and [[Cher]] were also performing there.

In 2009, in honor of Linda Ronstadt, the [[C. F. Martin &amp; Company|Martin Guitar Company]] made a 00–42 model &quot;Linda Ronstadt Limited Edition&quot; acoustic guitar. Ronstadt appointed the [[Land Institute]] as recipient of all proceeds from her signature guitar.&lt;ref name=martinguitar&gt;{{cite web | title= CF Martin &amp; Company Website| work=Linda Ronstadt Signature Guitar | url=http://www.martinguitar.com/artists/display_artist.php?d=387 | accessdate = 2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2011, [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] announced they would publish Ronstadt's autobiography. To be titled ''Heart Like A Wheel'', the memoir is scheduled to be released in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-quick-20110729,0,447297.story |title=Quick Takes: Linda Ronstadt plans memoir |date=July 29, 2011 |work= L.A.

===Political activism===
Major criticism and praise involving Ronstadt's politics arose during a July 17, 2004, performance at the [[Aladdin Theatre for the Performing Arts]] in [[Las Vegas Strip|Las Vegas]]. Toward the end of her performance, as she had done across the country, Ronstadt spoke to the audience, praising ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', [[Michael Moore]]'s documentary film about the [[Iraq War]], and dedicated the song &quot;Desperado&quot; to Moore.&lt;ref name=aladdin2&gt;{{cite web | title=The Progressive | work=Linda Ronstadt Gets the Hook at Aladdin: by Matthew Rothschild July 21, 2004

Aladdin casino president Bill Timmins and Michael Moore each made public statements on the controversy.&lt;ref name=aladdin1&gt;{{cite web | title=Michael Moore | work=Open Letter to Bill Timmins, President Aladdin Casino and Hotels| url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/message/index.php?messageDate=2004-07-19 | accessdate = 2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident prompted international headlines and debate on an entertainer's right to express a political opinion from the stage, and made the editorial section of ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=Desperadoes&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The New York Times| title=Desperadoes | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/21/opinion/21wed4.html | accessdate = 2007-05-12 | date=July 21, 2004}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the incident, many friends of Ronstadt's, including the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]], immediately canceled their engagements at the Aladdin.&lt;ref name=kqed/&gt; Ronstadt also received telegrams of support from her rock 'n' roll friends around the world, such as [[The Rolling Stones]], The Eagles, and [[Elton John]]. Amid reports of mixed public response, Ronstadt continued in her praise of Moore and his film throughout her 2004 and 2006 summer concerts across North America. At a 2006 concert in Canada, Ronstadt told the ''[[Calgary Sun]]'' that she was &quot;embarrassed [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] (was) from the United States.... He's an idiot.... He's enormously incompetent on both the domestic and international scenes.... Now the fact that we were lied to about the reasons for entering into war against Iraq and thousands of people have died – it's just as immoral as racism.&quot; Her remarks drew international headlines. In an August 14, 2007, interview, she commented on all her well-publicized, outspoken views, in particular the Aladdin incident by noting, &quot;If I had it to do over I would be much more gracious to everyone ... you can be as outspoken as you want if you are very, very respectful. Show some grace&quot;.&lt;ref name=grace&gt;{{cite web | title=Interview: Linda Ronstadt, Written by Nancy Dunham | work=Blogcritics Magazine | url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2007/08/14/085901.php| accessdate = 2007-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, Ronstadt, in a well-publicized interview to [[Planet Out|PlanetOut Inc.]] titled &quot;Linda Ronstadt's Gay Mission&quot;, championed gay rights, same sex marriage and stated that &quot;homophobia is anti-family values. Period, end of story.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=LINDA RONSTADT'S GAY MISSION Author=Jenny Stewart| publisher=Planet Out| url=http://www.gay.net/entertainment/2009/08/legend-linda-ronstadt-gay-lesbian-mission.html| accessdate = 2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 16, 2010, Ronstadt converged with thousands of other activists in a &quot;National Day of Action&quot;. Ronstadt stated that her &quot;dog in the fight&quot; was—as a native Arizonan and coming from a law enforcement family—the treatment of illegal aliens and Arizona's enforcement of its anti-immigrant law, especially Maricopa County Sheriff [[Joe Arpaio]]'s immigration efforts.&lt;ref name=NDAProtest&gt;{{cite web | work=Phoenix New Times| title= Linda Ronstadt Calls Joe Arpaio &quot;a Sadistic Man&quot;, Will Participate in Anti-Arpaio Human Rights March Saturday, January 16| url=http://blogs.phoenixnewtimes.com/bastard/2009/12/linda_ronstadt_call_joe_arpaio.php| accessdate = 2010-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 29, 2010, Ronstadt began a campaign, including joining a lawsuit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Linda Ronstadt joins group filing suit against Arizona law| work=Christian Science Monitor| url=http://www.csmonitor.com/From-the-news-wires/2010/0430/Linda-Ronstadt-joins-group-filing-suit-against-Arizona-law |accessdate = 2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; against Arizona's new illegal-immigration law [[SB 1070]] calling it a &quot;devastating blow to law enforcement...the police don't protect us in a democracy with brute force&quot;, something she said she learned from her brother, Peter, who was Chief of Police in Tucson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=lawsuits challenge Arizona's immigration law| work=Arizona Daily Star| url=http://azstarnet.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/article_5f4f524e-53e0-11df-b705-001cc4c03286.html| accessdate = 2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ronstadt has also been outspoken on environmental and community issues. Ronstadt is a major supporter and admirer of sustainable agriculture pioneer [[Wes Jackson]], saying in 2000 that &quot;the work he's doing right now is the most important work there is in the (United States)&quot;,&lt;ref name=WesJackson&gt;{{cite web | title=''Id''| url=http://www.ronstadt-linda.com/US2000.htm| accessdate = 2007-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dedicating the rock [[anthem]] &quot;Desperado&quot; to him at an August 2007 concert in [[Kansas City, Kansas]] .&lt;ref name=WesJackson1&gt;{{cite web | title=Ex-Interior Department secretary says The Land Institute on right track | work= Salina Journal Online | url=http://www.saljournal.com/rdnews/story/Prairie100107| accessdate = 2007-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Ronstadt resided in the San Francisco area, while also maintaining her home in [[Tucson, Arizona]].&lt;ref name=sfchronicle&gt;{{cite news | work=San Francisco Chronicle | title=Linda Ronstadt, at 60, is back in San Francisco, raising kids, and singing what she wants to sing | url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/07/28/DDG2PK61T81.DTL | accessdate = 2006-11-12 | first=Joel | last=Selvin}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year she drew criticism and praise&lt;ref name=azstar1&gt;{{cite web | title= Linda Ronstadt draws readers' ire | work=Arizona Star | url=http://www.azstarnet.com/allheadlines/186398 | accessdate = 2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Tucsonans for commenting that the local city council's failings, developers' [[strip mall]] mentality, greed and growing [[dust]] problem had rendered the city unrecognizable and poorly developed.&lt;ref name=azstar&gt;{{cite web | title= Ronstadt: Dust drove me away | work=Arizona Star | url=http://www.azstarnet.com/metro/185781 | accessdate = 2007-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, the Grammy Award site&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grammy.com/nominees/search?artist=ronstadt&amp;title=&amp;year=All&amp;genre=All Grammy Awards—Official Site] Past Winners Searchable database&lt;/ref&gt; shows Ronstadt the recipient of only 10 Awards, and 17 additional nominations. However, the official Grammy Awards site does show Ronstadt as a recipient for the Grammy winning Musical Album for Children.
