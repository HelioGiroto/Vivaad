&lt;!--Please See naming conventions at WP:MOSBIO, do not add details like &quot;Dr.&quot; or &quot;PhD&quot;--&gt;'''Condoleezza Rice''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|k|ɒ|n|d|ə|ˈ|l|iː|z|ə}}; born November 14, 1954) is an American political scientist and diplomat. She served as the [[List of Secretaries of State of the United States#List of Secretaries of State|66th]]  [[United States Secretary of State]], and was the second person to hold that office in the administration of [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]. Rice was the first female African-American secretary of state, as well as the [[List of African American United States Cabinet Secretaries|second African American]] (after [[Colin Powell]]), and the [[List of female United States Cabinet Secretaries|second woman]] (after [[Madeleine Albright]]). Rice was President Bush's [[United States National Security Advisor|National Security Advisor]] during his first term, making her the first woman to serve in that position. Before joining the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]], she was a professor of [[political science]] at [[Stanford University]] where she served as [[Provost (education)|Provost]] from 1993 to 1999. Rice also served on the [[National Security Council]] as the [[Soviet bloc|Soviet and Eastern Europe]] Affairs Advisor to President [[George H.W. Bush]] during the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] and [[German reunification]].

Following her confirmation as Secretary of State, Rice pioneered the policy of [[Transformational Diplomacy]], with a focus on democracy in the [[Greater Middle East]]. Her emphasis on supporting democratically elected governments faced challenges as [[Hamas]] captured a popular majority in [[Palestine|Palestinian]] elections, and influential countries including [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Egypt]] maintained authoritarian systems with U.S. support. While [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], she chaired the [[Millennium Challenge Account|Millennium Challenge Corporation]]'s board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;

In March 2009, Rice returned to [[Stanford University]] as a political science professor and the Thomas and Barbara Stephenson Senior Fellow on Public Policy at the [[Hoover Institution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fsi.stanford.edu/people/condoleezzarice/ |title=Condi Rice website at Stanford University |publisher=Fsi.stanford.edu |date= |accessdate=May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Condoleezza Rice |url=http://www.hoover.org/bios/rice.html |title=Condi Rice website at the Hoover Institution |publisher=Hoover.org |date= |accessdate=May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, Rice became a faculty member of the [[Stanford Graduate School of Business]] and a director of its Global Center for Business and the Economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;BW1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Gloeckler|first=Geoff|title= Getting In Condoleezza Rice To Join Stanford B-School Faculty In September|url=http://www.businessweek.com/bschools/blogs/mba_admissions/archives/2010/08/condoleezza_rice_to_join_stanford_gsb_faculty_in_september.html|work=Business Week|publisher=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=September 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rice was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]], the only child of Angelena (née Ray) Rice, a high school science, music, and oratory teacher, and John Wesley Rice, Jr., a high school guidance counselor and Presbyterian minister.&lt;ref name=notablebio&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of World Biography |title=Condoleezza Rice |url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Ow-Sh/Rice-Condoleezza.html |accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2003/009/1.42.html|title=The Unflappable Condi Rice|accessdate=8 March 2012|date=1 September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her name, Condoleezza, derives from the [[classical music|music]]-related term, ''[[con dolcezza]]'', which in Italian means, &quot;with sweetness&quot;. Rice has roots in the [[American South]] going back to the pre-[[American Civil War|Civil War]] era, and some of her ancestors worked as sharecroppers for a time after emancipation. Rice discovered on the [[PBS]] series ''[[Finding Your Roots]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/news/ancestry-testing-goes-for-pinpoint-accuracy-1.10785&lt;/ref&gt; that she is of 51% African, 40% European and 9% Native American or Asian genetic descent, while her [[mtDNA]] is traced back to the [[Tikar people]] of [[Cameroon]].&lt;ref name=YGG&gt;Your Genetic Genealogist, [http://www.yourgeneticgenealogist.com/2012/04/finding-your-roots-with-henry-louis_30.html &quot;Finding Your Roots with Henry Louis Gates, Jr.&quot; - DNA in the Seventh Episode]: &quot;Dr. Gates' team also ordered an admixture test for Condoleeza. This DNA analysis revealed that her genetic makeup is 51% African, 40% European and 9% Native American or Asian. &quot; and &quot;Condoleezza was surprised to learn that her mtDNA traced back to the Tikar people of Cameroon&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Rice grew up in the [[Titusville, Birmingham, Alabama|Titusville]]{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} neighborhood at a time when the South was racially segregated.

===Early education===
[[Image:Condi as a College Student.jpg|thumb|right|Condoleezza Rice as an undergraduate student at the University of Denver]]
Rice began to learn French, music, figure skating and ballet at the age of three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hawkins |first=B. Denise |date=September/October 2002 |title=Condoleezza Rice's Secret Weapon |journal=Today's Christian |url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/tc/2002/005/1.18.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080109235721/http://www.christianitytoday.com/tc/2002/005/1.18.html |archivedate=January 9, 2008 |accessdate=October 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of fifteen, she began piano classes with the goal of becoming a concert [[pianist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;episode&quot;&gt;{{cite episode |title=Condoleezza Rice |url=http://www.wnyc.org/stream/ram.py?file=madaboutmusic/mam010204.ra |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051111091533/http://www.wnyc.org/stream/ram.py?file=madaboutmusic/mam010204.ra |archivedate=November 11, 2005 |series=Mad About Music |station=[[WNYC]] |airdate=2005-01-02 |transcripturl=http://www.wnyc.org/shows/mam/episodes/2005/01/02 |accessdate=October 26, 2008}}{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Rice ultimately did not become a professional pianist, she still practices often and plays with a chamber music group. She accompanied [[cello|cellist]] [[Yo-Yo Ma]] playing [[Johannes Brahms|Brahms's]] [[Violin Sonata No. 3 (Brahms)|Violin Sonata in D Minor]] at [[Constitution Hall]] in April 2002 for the [[National Medal of Arts]] Awards.&lt;ref name=tommasini&gt;{{cite news |first=Anthony |last=Tommasini |authorlink=Anthony Tommasini |title=Condoleezza Rice on Piano |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/09/arts/music/09tomm.html?_r=1 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 9, 2006 |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High school and university education===
In 1967, the family moved to [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. She attended [[St. Mary's Academy (Cherry Hills Village)|St. Mary's Academy]], an all-girls Catholic high school in [[Cherry Hills Village, Colorado|Cherry Hills Village]], [[Colorado]], graduating in 1971. After studying piano at the [[Aspen Music Festival and School]], Rice enrolled at the [[University of Denver]], where her father was then serving as an assistant dean.

Rice's initial college major was piano, but after realizing she did not have the talent to play professionally, she began to consider an alternative major.&lt;ref name=&quot;episode&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.du.edu/today/magazine/facing-forward-looking-back|first=Tamara |last=Chapman |title=Facing Forward, Looking Back |work=University of Denver Magazine |date=Summer 2010|accessdate= September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended an international politics course taught by [[Josef Korbel]], which sparked her interest in the [[Soviet Union]] and [[international relations]]. Rice later described Korbel (who was the father of [[Madeleine Albright]], a future U.S. Secretary of State), as a central figure in her life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Dobbs |authorlink=Michael Dobbs |title=Josef Korbel's Enduring Foreign Policy Legacy; Professor Mentored Daughter Albright and Student Rice |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-552426.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=December 28, 2000 |accessdate=November 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, at age 19, Rice was inducted into the honor society [[Phi Beta Kappa Society|Phi Beta Kappa]], and was awarded a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], ''[[cum laude]]'', in [[political science]] by the University of Denver. While at the University of Denver she was a member of [[Alpha Chi Omega]], Gamma Delta chapter.&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.uscaxo.com/dynamic/?Action=show_custom_content&amp;pageid=1688], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt; She obtained a [[master's degree]] in [[political science]] from the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1975. She first worked in the [[State Department]] in 1977, during the [[Carter administration]], as an intern in the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. In 1981, at the age of 26, she received her [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in political science from the [[Josef Korbel School of International Studies]] at the University of Denver. Her dissertation centered on military policy and politics in what was then the [[communist]] state of [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Condoleezza |last=Rice |title=The Politics of Client Command: Party-Military Relations in Czechoslovakia, 1948–1975. |series=PhD dissertation |publisher=University of Denver |year=1981 |url=http://130.253.4.23/record=b2587932~S3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early political views===
Rice was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] until 1982, when she changed her political affiliation to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], in part because she disagreed with the foreign policy of Democratic President [[Jimmy Carter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Balz | first = Dan | title = The Republicans Showcase a Rising Star; Foreign Policy Fueled Rice's Party Switch and Her Climb to Prominence | work = Washington Post | date = August 1, 2000 |url =http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-544048.html | accessdate = April 21, 2009 | unused_data = The same article can be accessed in the Chicago Sun-Times, December 17, 2000 edition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Maki |last=Becker |title=20 Things You Probably Didn't Know About |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2004/04/04/2004-04-04_20_things_you_probably_didn_.html |work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |date=April 4, 2004 |accessdate=November 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and because of the influence of her father, who was Republican. As she told the [[2000 Republican National Convention]], &quot;My father joined our party because the Democrats in [[Jim Crow]] Alabama of 1952 would not register him to vote. The Republicans did.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rice at rnc&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Rice |last=Condoleezza |title=Text: Condoleezza Rice at the Republican National Convention |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/onpolitics/elections/ricetext080100.htm |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=August 1, 2000 |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
[[Image:condi rice.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Condoleezza Rice during a 2005 interview on ITV in London]]
Rice was hired by [[Stanford University]] as an [[assistant professor]] of [[political science]] (1981–1987). She was promoted to [[associate professor]] in 1987, a post she held until 1993. She was a specialist on the [[Soviet Union]] and gave lectures on the subject for the Berkeley-Stanford joint program led by [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]] Professor George Breslauer in the mid-1980s.

At a 1985 meeting of arms control experts at Stanford, Rice's performance drew the attention of [[Brent Scowcroft]], who had served as [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] under [[Gerald Ford]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Baker, 20080403&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the election of [[George H. W. Bush]], Scowcroft returned to the White House as National Security Adviser in 1989, and he asked Rice to become his Soviet expert on the [[United States National Security Council]]. According to [[R. Nicholas Burns]], President Bush was &quot;captivated&quot; by Rice, and relied heavily on her advice in his dealings with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[Boris Yeltsin]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Baker, 20080403&quot;/&gt;

Because she would have been ineligible for tenure at Stanford if she had been absent for more than two years, she returned there in 1991. She was taken under the wing of [[George P. Shultz]] ([[Ronald Reagan]]'s [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] from 1982–1989), who was a fellow at the [[Hoover Institution]]. Shultz included Rice in a &quot;luncheon club&quot; of intellectuals who met every few weeks to discuss foreign affairs.&lt;ref name = &quot;Baker, 20080403&quot;/&gt; In 1992, Shultz, who was a board member of [[Chevron Corporation]], recommended Rice for a spot on the Chevron board. Chevron was pursuing a $10 billion development project in [[Kazakhstan]] and, as a Soviet specialist, Rice knew the [[President of Kazakhstan]], [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]]. She traveled to Kazakhstan on Chevron's behalf and, in honor of her work, in 1993, Chevron named a 129,000-ton supertanker SS ''Condoleezza Rice''.&lt;ref name = &quot;Baker, 20080403&quot;/&gt; During this period, Rice was also appointed to the boards of [[Transamerica Corporation]] (1991) and [[Hewlett-Packard]] (1992).

At Stanford, in 1992, Rice volunteered to serve on the search committee to replace outgoing president [[Donald Kennedy]]. The committee ultimately recommended [[Gerhard Casper]], the Provost of the University of Chicago. Casper met Rice during this search, and was so impressed that in 1993, he appointed her as Stanford's [[Provost (education)|Provost]], the chief budget and academic officer of the university in 1993&lt;ref name = &quot;Baker, 20080403&quot;/&gt; and she also was granted [[tenure]] and became full [[professor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Condoleezza Rice |url=http://www.forbes.com/2001/10/15/crice.html |publisher=[[Forbes]] |date=October 18, 2001 |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice was the first female, first minority, and youngest Provost in Stanford history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Condoleezza Rice: U.S. national security adviser |url=http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2002/black.history/stories/13.rice/index.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20020223173824/http://edition.cnn.com/SPECIALS/2002/black.history/stories/13.rice/index.html|archivedate=Feb. 23, 2002|publisher=CNN |date=February 2002 |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also named a [[senior fellow]] of the [[Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies|Institute for International Studies]], and a senior fellow (by courtesy) of the [[Hoover Institution]].

===Provost promotion===
Former Stanford President Gerhard Casper said the university was &quot;most fortunate in persuading someone of Professor Rice's exceptional talents and proven ability in critical situations to take on this task. Everything she has done, she has done well; I have every confidence that she will continue that record as provost.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Casper selects Condoleezza Rice to be next Stanford provost |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |date=May 19, 1993 |url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/pr/93/930519Arc3267.html |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledging Rice's unique character, Casper told the New Yorker in 2002 that it &quot;would be disingenuous for me to say that the fact that she was a woman, the fact that she was black and the fact that she was young weren't in my mind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=October 14, 2002|publisher=New Yorker|title=Condoleezza Rice|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balancing school budget===
As Stanford's Provost, Rice was responsible for managing the university's multi-billion dollar budget. The school at that time was running a deficit of $20 million. When Rice took office, she promised that the budget deficit would be balanced within &quot;two years.&quot; Coit Blacker, Stanford's deputy director of the Institute for International Studies, said there &quot;was a sort of conventional wisdom that said it couldn't be done... that [the deficit] was structural, that we just had to live with it.&quot; Two years later, Rice announced that the deficit had been eliminated and the university was holding a record surplus of over $14.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Robinson |first=James |date=June 9, 1999 |title=Velvet-glove forcefulness: Seven years of provostial challenges and achievements |journal=Stanford Report |publisher=[[Stanford University]] |url=http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/1999/june9/rice-69.html |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special interest issues===
Rice drew protests when, as provost, she departed from the practice of applying affirmative action to tenure decisions and unsuccessfully sought to consolidate the university's ethnic community centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark Z. |last=Barabak |title=Not Always Diplomatic in Her First Major Post; Condoleezza Rice, about to become secretary of State, was a divisive figure while at Stanford |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/779273571.html?dids=779273571:779273571&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+16%2C+2005&amp;author=Mark+Z.+Barabak&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.1&amp;desc=Not+Always+Diplomatic+in+Her+First+Major+Post |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page=A1 |date=January 16, 2005 |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Return to Stanford===
During a farewell interview in early December 2008, Rice indicated she would return to Stanford and the [[Hoover Institution]], &quot;back west of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] where I belong,&quot; but beyond writing and teaching did not specify what her role would be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=[[George (magazine)|George]]|last=[[Stephanopoulos]]|date=December 7, 2008|title=[[This Week (ABC TV series)]]|publisher=[[ABC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice's plans for a return to campus were elaborated in an interview with the Stanford Report in January 2009.&lt;ref name='stanford_report_2009-01-28'&gt;[http://news-service.stanford.edu/news/2009/january28/condiweb-012809.html Condoleezza Rice on returning to campus].

Rice is an accomplished pianist and has performed in public since she was a young girl. At the age of 15, she played Mozart with the [[Denver Symphony Orchestra|Denver Symphony]], and while Secretary of State she played regularly with a chamber music group in Washington.&lt;ref name=tommasini/&gt; She does not play professionally, but has performed at diplomatic events at embassies, including a performance for [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/theroyalfamily/3540634/Condoleezza-Rice-plays-piano-for-the-Queen.html Condoleezza Rice plays piano for the Queen], [[Daily Telegraph]], December 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7759872.stm Rice performs recital for the Queen], [[BBC News]], December 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and she has performed in public with cellist [[Yo-Yo Ma]] and singer [[Aretha Franklin]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Washington Post]]''.

She has stated that her favorite composer is [[Johannes Brahms]], because she thinks Brahms's music is &quot;passionate but not sentimental.&quot; On a complementary note, on Friday, April 10, 2009 on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' with [[Jay Leno]], she stated that her favorite band is [[Led Zeppelin]].

As Secretary of State, Rice was ''ex officio'' a member of the [[John_F._Kennedy_Center_for_the_Performing_Arts#Board_of_Trustees|Board of Trustees]] of the [[John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts]]. As the end of their tenures approached in January 2009, outgoing President Bush appointed her to a six-year term as a general trustee, filling a vacancy on the board.

==Private sector==
Rice headed Chevron's committee on public policy until she resigned on January 15, 2001, to become [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] to President [[George W. Bush]]. Chevron, for unspecified reasons, honored Rice by naming an [[Petroleum tanker|oil tanker]] ''Condoleezza Rice'' after her, but controversy led to its being renamed ''Altair Voyager.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Carla |last=Marinucci |authorlink=Carla Marinucci |title=Chevron redubs ship named for Bush aide |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/05/05/MN223743.DTL |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=May 5, 2001 |accessdate=October 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also served on the [[board of directors]] for the [[Carnegie Corporation]], the [[Charles Schwab Corporation]], the [[Chevron Corporation]], [[Hewlett Packard]], the [[Rand Corporation]], the [[Transamerica Corporation]], and other organizations.

In 1992, Rice founded the Center for New Generation, an after-school program created to raise the high school graduation numbers of [[East Palo Alto]] and eastern [[Menlo Park, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Condoleezza Rice to visit program she started |url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/show_story.php?id=5083 |work=Palo Alto Online News |date=May 22, 2007 |accessdate=October 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her tenure as secretary of state, Rice was approached in February 2009 to fill an open position as a [[Pac-10]] Commissioner,&lt;ref name=AP_20090203&gt;{{cite news

|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; but chose instead to return to [[Stanford University]] as a political science professor and the Thomas and Barbara Stephenson Senior Fellow on Public Policy at the [[Hoover Institution]].

==Early political career==
In 1986, while an international affairs fellow of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], Rice served as Special Assistant to the Director of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]].

From 1989 through March 1991 (the period of the fall of [[Berlin Wall]] and the final days of the [[Soviet Union]]), she served in President [[George H. W. Bush|George H.W. Bush's]] administration as Director, and then Senior Director, of Soviet and East European Affairs in the [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]], and a Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs. In this position, Rice helped develop Bush's and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[James Baker]]'s policies in favor of [[German reunification]]. She impressed Bush, who later introduced her to Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], as the one who &quot;tells me everything I know about the Soviet Union.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Kettmann |authorlink=Steve Kettmann |title=Bush's secret weapon |url=http://archive.salon.com/politics2000/feature/2000/03/20/rice/index.html |work=[[Salon.com]] |date=May 20, 2000 |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Rice returned to her teaching position at Stanford, although she continued to serve as a consultant on the former Soviet Bloc for numerous clients in both the public and private sectors. Late that year, [[California Governor]] [[Pete Wilson]] appointed her to a bipartisan committee that had been formed to draw new state legislative and congressional districts in the state.

In 1997, she sat on the Federal Advisory Committee on Gender-Integrated Training in the Military.

During George W. Bush's [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]] campaign, Rice took a one-year leave of absence from [[Stanford University]] to help work as his foreign policy advisor. The group of advisors she led called itself [[The Vulcans]] in honor of the monumental [[Vulcan statue]], which sits on a hill overlooking her hometown of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]]. Rice would later go on to give a [[s:Remarks by Condoleezza Rice at the 2000 Republican National Convention|noteworthy speech]] at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]]. The speech asserted that &quot;...America's armed forces are not a global police force. They are not the world's 911.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rice at rnc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Time 20070221 CwT&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Exclusive Interview: Conversation with Terror |url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,174550,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=January 11, 1999 |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Security Advisor (2001–2005)==

Bush]] speak about the Middle East on June 24, 2002]]

On December 17, 2000, Rice was named as [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] and stepped down from her position at Stanford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kuempel |first=George |coauthors=Dodge, Robert |title=Bush selects three key staff members |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-122113753/bush-selects-three-key.html |publisher=The Dallas Morning News |date=December 17, 2000 |accessdate=February 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first woman to occupy the post. Rice earned the nickname of &quot;Warrior Princess,&quot; reflecting strong nerve and delicate manners.&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2005/11/MTNG.html |title=#1 Condoleezza Rice |accessdate=November 3, 2008 |work=The Most Powerful Women |publisher=[[Forbes]] |first=Tatiana |last=Serafin |year=2005 |month=November}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 18, 2003, the ''[[Washington Post]]'' reported that Rice was involved in crafting Bush's position on race-based preferences. Rice has stated that &quot;while race-neutral means are preferable,&quot; race can be taken into account as &quot;one factor among others&quot; in university admissions policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rice says race can be 'one factor' in considering admissions |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/01/17/rice.action/ |publisher=CNN |date=January 18, 2003 |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terrorism===
During the summer of 2001, Rice met with [[CIA]] Director [[George Tenet]] to discuss the possibilities and prevention of terrorist attacks on American targets. On July 10, 2001, Rice met with Tenet in what he referred to as an &quot;emergency meeting&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;NYTimes-20061002 Tenet&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Philip |last=Shenon |coauthors=Mark Mazzetti |title=Records Show Tenet Briefed Rice on Al Qaeda Threat |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/02/washington/03ricecnd.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 2, 2006 |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; held at the White House at Tenet's request to brief Rice and the NSC staff about the potential threat of an impending [[al Qaeda]] attack. Rice responded by asking Tenet to give a presentation on the matter to Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]] and [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jonathan S. |last=Landay |coauthors=Warren P. Strobel, John Walcott, Matt Stearns and Drew Brown |title=Rumsfeld, Ashcroft said to have received warning of attack |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2006/10/02/14890/rumsfeld-ashcroft-said-to-have.html |publisher=[[The McClatchy Company]] |date=October 2, 2006 |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 11, 2001, Rice was scheduled to outline a new national security policy that included missile defense as a cornerstone and played down the threat of stateless terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top Focus Before 9/11 Wasn't on Terrorism|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A40697-2004Mar31|date=April 1, 2004 | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=August 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about the meeting in 2006, Rice asserted she did not recall the specific meeting, commenting that she had met ''repeatedly'' with Tenet that summer about terrorist threats. Moreover, she stated that it was &quot;incomprehensible&quot; to her that she had ignored terrorist threats two months before the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref name = &quot;NYTimes-20061002 Tenet&quot;/&gt;

In August, 2010, Rice received the U.S. Air Force Academy's 2009 Thomas D. White National Defense Award for contributions to the defense and security of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usafa.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123219657, retrieved  12/12/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subpoenas===
In March 2004, Rice declined to testify before the [[National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States]] (the [[9/11 Commission]]). The [[White House]] claimed [[executive privilege]] under constitutional [[separation of powers]] and cited past tradition. Under pressure, Bush agreed to allow her to testify&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Transcript of Rice's 9/11 commission statement |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/04/08/rice.transcript/ |publisher=CNN |date=May 19, 2004 |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; so long as it did not create a precedent of presidential staff being required to appear before [[United States Congress]] when so requested. Her appearance before the commission on April 8, 2004, was accepted by the Bush administration in part because she was not appearing directly before Congress. She thus became the first sitting National Security Advisor to testify on matters of policy.

In April 2007, Rice rejected, on grounds of executive privilege, a House subpoena regarding the prewar claim that Iraq sought [[yellowcake uranium]] from Niger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rice says Saddam questions answered |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2007/apr/26/20070426-120513-8451r/ |work=[[The Washington Times]] |date=April 26, 2007 |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq===
Rice was a proponent of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. After [[Iraq]] delivered its declaration of [[weapons of mass destruction]] to the [[United Nations]] on December 8, 2002, Rice wrote an [[editorial]] for ''[[The New York Times]]'' entitled &quot;Why We Know Iraq Is Lying&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Condoleezza |last=Rice |title=Why We Know Iraq Is Lying |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E01E5DF1E30F930A15752C0A9659C8B63 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=January 23, 2003 |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2003, Rice was named to run the ''Iraq Stabilization Group,'' to “quell violence in Iraq and Afghanistan and to speed the reconstruction of both countries.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David E. |last=Sanger |authorlink=David E. Sanger |title= White House to Overhaul Iraq and Afghan Missions |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFD7133CF935A35753C1A9659C8B63 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=October 6, 2003 |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By May 2004, the Washington Post reported that the council had become virtually nonexistent.&lt;ref&gt;Dana Milbank, ''Stabilization Is Its Middle Name'', Washington Post, May 18, 2004, p. A17&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading up to the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], Rice became the first National Security Advisor to campaign for an incumbent president. She stated that while: &quot;Saddam Hussein had nothing to do with the actual attacks on America, Saddam Hussein's Iraq was a part of the Middle East that was festering and unstable, [and] was part of the circumstances that created the problem on September 11.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Rice defends decision to go to war in Iraq |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/22/rice.speech.ap/ |publisher=CNN |date=October 22, 2004 |accessdate=November 3, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20041117054631/http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/10/22/rice.speech.ap/ |archivedate=November 17, 2004}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weapons of mass destruction===
In a January 10, 2003 interview with CNN's [[Wolf Blitzer]], Rice made headlines by stating regarding Iraqi [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]]: &quot;The problem here is that there will always be some uncertainty about how quickly he can acquire nuclear weapons. But we don't want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Wolf |last=Blitzer |authorlink=Wolf Blitzer |title=Search for the 'smoking gun' |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/US/01/10/wbr.smoking.gun/ |publisher=CNN |date=January 10, 2003 |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the invasion, when it became clear that Iraq did not have nuclear WMD capability, critics called Rice's claims a &quot;hoax,&quot; &quot;deception&quot; and &quot;demagogic scare tactic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Report: No WMD stockpiles in Iraq |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/10/06/iraq.wmd.report/ |publisher=CNN |date=October 7, 2004 |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morris |first=Roger |authorlink=Roger Morris (American writer) |date=July 27, 2005 |title=Condoleezza Rice at the Center of the Plame Scandal |journal=[[CounterPunch]] |url=http://www.counterpunch.org/morris07272005.html |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot;Either she missed or overlooked numerous warnings from intelligence agencies seeking to put caveats on claims about Iraq's nuclear weapons program, or she made public claims that she knew to be false,&quot; wrote Dana Milbank and Mike Allen in the Washington Post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Dana |last=Milbank |authorlink=Dana Milbank |coauthors=Mike Allen |title=Iraq Flap Shakes Rice's Image |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A51224-2003Jul26 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |page=A0 |date=July 27, 2003 |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice characterized the August 6, 2001 [[President's Daily Brief]] ''[[Bin Ladin Determined To Strike in US]]'' as historical information. Rice indicated &quot;It was information based on old reporting.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB116/testimony.htm |title=Excerpts from April 8, 2004 Testimony of Dr. Condoleezza Rice Before the 9/11 Commission Pertaining to The President's Daily Brief of August 6, 2001 |accessdate=November 3, 2008 |publisher=[[National Security Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sean Wilentz of [[Salon magazine]] suggested that the PDB contained current information based on continuing investigations, including that Bin Laden wanted to &quot;bring the fighting to America.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Wilentz |authorlink=Sean Wilentz |title=Don't know much about history |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/opinion/feature/2004/04/13/rice/index.html |work=[[Salon.com]] |date=April 13, 2004 |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in authorizing use of torture techniques===
A [[Senate Intelligence Committee]] reported that on July 17, 2002, Rice met with CIA director [[George Tenet]] to personally convey the Bush administration's approval of the proposed [[waterboarding]] of alleged Al Qaeda leader [[Abu Zubaydah]]. &quot;Days after Dr Rice gave Mr Tenet her approval, the Justice Department approved the use of waterboarding in a top secret August 1 memo.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;TheTimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Nico |last=Hines |title=Condoleezza Rice gave nod for 'torture' techniques |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/5208701/Condoleezza-Rice-approved-torture-techniques.html |work=[[The Times]] |date=April 23, 2009 |accessdate=April 33, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waterboarding is considered to be torture by a wide range of authorities, including legal experts,&lt;ref name='HRW open letter WB'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hrw.org/en/news/2006/04/05/open-letter-attorney-general-alberto-gonzales |title=Open Letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales |accessdate=April 17, 2009 |date=April 5, 2006 |publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='JuristPittWB_100807'&gt;{{cite news |first=Benjamin |last=Davis |authorlink=Benjamin G.

In 2003 Rice, Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] and Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] met with the CIA again and were briefed on the use of waterboarding and other methods including week-long [[sleep deprivation]], forced nudity and the use of stress positions. The Senate report says that the Bush administration officials &quot;reaffirmed that the CIA program was lawful and reflected administration policy&quot;.&lt;ref name=TheTimes/&gt;

The Senate report also &quot;suggests Miss Rice played a more significant role than she acknowledged in written testimony to the Senate Armed Services Committee submitted in the autumn.&quot;&lt;ref name=TheTimes/&gt; At that time, she had acknowledged attending meetings to discuss the CIA interrogations, but she claimed that she could not recall the details, and she &quot;omitted her direct role in approving the programme in her written statement to the committee.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rice Gave OK&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last = Associated Press| title = As Bush Adviser, Rice Gave OK to Waterboard| publisher = Fox News| date = April 22, 2009| url = http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/22/bush-adviser-rice-gave-ok-waterboard/| accessdate = May 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a conversation with a student at [[Stanford University]] in April 2009, Rice stated that she did not authorize the CIA to use the ''[[enhanced interrogation techniques]]''. Rice said, &quot;I didn't authorize anything. I conveyed the authorization of the administration to the agency that they had policy authorization, subject to the Justice Department's clearance. That's what I did.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kess&quot;&gt;Kessler, Glenn, &quot;[http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2009/04/30/rice_defends_enhanced_interrog.html?hpid=news-col-blog Rice Defends Use Of Enhanced Techniques]&quot;, ''[[Washington Post]]'', May 1, 2009, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; She added, “We were told, nothing that violates our obligations under the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture|Convention Against Torture]].

On November 16, 2004, Bush nominated Rice to be [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. On January 26, 2005, the Senate confirmed her nomination by a vote of 85–13. The negative votes, the most cast against any nomination for Secretary of State since 1825, came from Senators who, according to Senator [[Barbara Boxer]], wanted &quot;to hold Dr. Rice and the Bush administration accountable for their failures in Iraq and in the war on terrorism.&quot; Their reasoning was that Rice had acted irresponsibly in equating Saddam's regime with [[Islamism|Islamist]] terrorism and some could not accept her previous record. Senator [[Robert Byrd]] voted against Rice's appointment, indicating that she &quot;has asserted that the President holds far more of the war power than the Constitution grants him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Standing for the Founding Principles of the Republic: Voting No on the Nomination of Dr. Rice as Secretary of State |publisher=[[Robert Byrd]] |date=January 25, 2005 |url=http://byrd.senate.gov/speeches/byrd_speeches_2005_january/byrd_speeches_2005_january_lis/byrd_speeches_2005_january_lis_0.html |accessdate=November 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], Rice championed the expansion of democratic governments. Rice stated that the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001 were rooted in &quot;oppression and despair&quot; and so, the US must advance democratic reform and support basic rights throughout the greater Middle East.&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{cite press release |title=Princeton University's Celebration of the 75th Anniversary Of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |date=September 30, 2005 |url=http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/54176.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080708212932/http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/54176.htm |archivedate=July 8, 2008 |accessdate=November 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rice also reformed and restructured the department, as well as US diplomacy as a whole. &quot;[[Transformational Diplomacy]]&quot; is the goal that Rice describes as &quot;work[ing] with our many partners around the world...

As Secretary of State, Rice traveled widely and initiated many diplomatic efforts on behalf of the Bush administration. Her diplomacy relied on strong presidential support and is considered to be the continuation of style defined by former Republican secretaries of state [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[James Baker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redorbit.com/news/general/326857/rice_travel_diplomacy_year__up_close_and_personal/ |title=Rice travel diplomacy year&amp;nbsp;– up close and personal |publisher=Reuters |date=October 11, 2005 |accessdate=September 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Rice and Putin.jpg|thumb|right|Condoleezza Rice speaks with [[Vladimir Putin]] during her April 2005 trip to Russia.]]

==Post-Bush Administration==
After the end of the Bush Administration, Rice returned to academia and joined the [[Council on Foreign Relations]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfr.org/about/membership/roster.html?letter=R Council on Foreign Relations Roster]&lt;/ref&gt;

She appeared as herself in 2011 on the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[30 Rock]]'' in the [[30 Rock (season 5)|fifth-season]] episode &quot;[[Everything Sunny All the Time Always]],&quot; in which she engages in a classical-music duel with [[Jack Donaghy]] ([[Alec Baldwin]]). Fictionally, Donaghy had had a relationship with Rice at an unspecified point in the past.

===Speculation on 2008 presidential campaign, views on successor===
There had been previous speculation that Rice would run for the Republican nomination in the 2008 primaries, which she ruled out on ''[[Meet the Press]]''. On February 22, 2008, Rice played down any suggestion that she may be on the Republican vice presidential ticket, saying, &quot;I have always said that the one thing that I have not seen myself doing is running for elected office in the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rice says has no plan to run for vice president |date=February 22, 2008 |work=Reuters |accessdate=March 28, 2008 |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2262518020080222?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=politicsNews&amp;rpc=22&amp;sp=true |quote=I have always said that the one thing that I have not seen myself doing is running for elected office. }}&lt;/ref&gt; During an interview with the editorial board of the ''[[Washington Times]]'' on March 27, 2008, Rice said she was &quot;not interested&quot; in running for vice president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Transcript of Secretary Condoleezza Rice's Interview with the Washington Times Editorial Board |work=The Washington Times |publisher=United States Department of State |date=March 28, 2008 |accessdate=March 28, 2008 |url=http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2008/03/102757.htm |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080329060825/http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2008/03/102757.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = March 29, 2008}}Question: &quot;And would you consider vice president?&quot; Rice: &quot;Not interested.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Gallup poll]] from March 24 to 27, 2008, Rice was mentioned by eight percent of Republican respondents to be their first choice to be [[John McCain|Senator John McCain's]] Republican Vice-Presidential running mate, slightly behind [[Mike Huckabee]] and [[Mitt Romney]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video_log/2008/04/gallup_polls_on_gop_vp_prefere.html Gallup Polls on GOP VP Preferences]&quot;, ''Gallup'', 2008-04-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

Republican strategist [[Dan Senor]] said on ABC's ''[[This Week (ABC TV series)|This Week]]'' on April 6, 2008, that &quot;Condi Rice has been actively, actually in recent weeks, campaigning for&quot; the vice presidential nomination. He based this assessment on her attendance of [[Grover Norquist]]'s [[Americans for Tax Reform]] conservative leader's meeting on March 26, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dan Senor: Condoleezza Rice Is Pursuing the VP Spot |work=ABC News |date=April 6, 2008 |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalradar/2008/04/dan-senor-condo.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Senor's comments, Rice's spokesperson denied that Rice is seeking the vice presidential nomination, saying, &quot;If she is actively seeking the vice presidency, then she's the last one to know about it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Glenn |last=Kessler |authorlink=Glenn Kessler (journalist) |title=Rice: Still Not Running for VP |url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/44/2008/04/07/rice_still_not_running_for_vp.html |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=April 7, 2008 |accessdate=November 3, 2008 |quote=[[Sean McCormack|McCormack]] dismissed both as perfectly ordinary.

In August 2008, the speculation about a potential McCain-Rice ticket finally ended when then-Governor [[Sarah Palin]] of Alaska was selected as McCain's running-mate.

In early December 2008, Rice praised President-elect [[Barack Obama]]'s selection of New York [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Hillary Clinton]] to succeed her as Secretary of State, saying &quot;she's terrific&quot;. Rice, who has spoken to Clinton since her selection, said Clinton &quot;is someone of intelligence and she'll do a great job&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/george/2008/12/rice-on-hillary.html|title=Rice on Hillary: 'She's Terrific'|publisher=[[ABC News]]|first=George|last=[[Stephanopoulos]]|date=December 7, 2008|accessdate=December 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political positions==
===Terrorist activity===
Rice's policy as [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] viewed [[counter-terrorism]] as a matter of being preventative, and not merely punitive. In an interview on December 18, 2005, Rice stated: &quot;We have to remember that in this war on terrorism, we're not talking about criminal activity where you can allow somebody to commit the crime and then you go back and you arrest them and you question them. If they succeed in committing their crime, then hundreds or indeed thousands of people die. That's why you have to prevent, and intelligence is the long pole in the tent in preventing attacks.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. State Department [http://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/58232.htm Interview on Fox News Sunday With Chris Wallace]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}. December 18, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rangin Dadfar Spanta et Condoleezza Rice.jpg|thumb|left|Rice meets with Afghan Foreign Minister [[Rangin Dadfar Spanta]] to discuss anti-terrorism efforts]]
Rice has also been a frequent critic of the intelligence community's inability to cooperate and share information, which she believes is an integral part of preventing terrorism. In 2000, one year after Osama bin Laden told Time “[h]ostility toward America is a religious duty,&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Time 20070221 CwT&quot;/&gt; and a year before the [[September 11 terrorist attacks]], Rice warned on
[[WJR]] [[Detroit]]: &quot;You really have to get the intelligence agencies better organized to deal with the terrorist threat to the United States itself. One of the problems that we have is a kind of split responsibility, of course, between the [[CIA]] and foreign intelligence and the [[FBI]] and domestic intelligence.&quot; She then added: &quot;There needs to be better cooperation because we don't want to wake up one day and find out that [[Osama bin Laden]] has been successful on our own territory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2004/3/24/120740.shtml Rice Quotes Contradict Clarke Account]. NewsMax. March 24, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice also has promoted the idea that counterterrorism involves not only confronting the governments and organizations that promote and condone terrorism, but also the ideologies that fuel terrorism. In a speech given on July 29, 2005, Rice asserted that &quot;[s]ecuring America from terrorist attack is more than a matter of law enforcement. We must also confront the ideology of hatred in foreign societies by supporting the universal hope of liberty and the inherent appeal of democracy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. State Department [http://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/50375.htm Remarks With Senator Richard Lugar on the U.S. Department of State and the Challenges of the 21st century] July 29, 2005. Retrieved June 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2005, during Bush's [[Inauguration Day|second inaugural ceremonies]], Rice first used the term &quot;[[outposts of tyranny]]&quot; to refer to countries felt to threaten world peace and human rights. This term has been called a descendant of Bush's phrase, &quot;[[Axis of Evil]]&quot;, used to describe [[Iraq]], [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]]. She identified six such &quot;outposts&quot; in which she said the United States has a duty to foster freedom: [[Cuba]], [[Zimbabwe]], [[Burma]] and [[Belarus]], as well as Iran and North Korea.

===Abortion===
Rice said &quot;If you go back to 2000 when I helped the president in the campaign. I said that I was, in effect, kind of [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] on this issue. And meaning by that, that I have been concerned about a government role in this issue. I am a strong proponent of parental choice—of parental notification. I am a strong proponent of a ban on late-term abortion. These are all things that I think unite people and I think that that's where we should be. I've called myself at times mildly pro-choice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A30282-2005Mar12.html |title=Washington Post, March 2005 |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=March 13, 2005 |accessdate=May 27, 2009 | first=Mike | last=Allen}}&lt;/ref&gt; She would not want the federal government &quot;forcing its views on one side or the other.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;4Condi2005&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2005/mar/11/20050311-115948-2015r/print/ 2008 run, abortion engage her politically] Washington Post, March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice said she believes President Bush &quot;has been in exactly the right place&quot; on abortion, &quot;which is we have to respect the culture of life and we have to try and bring people to have respect for it and make this as rare a circumstance as possible&quot; However, she added that she has been &quot;concerned about a government role&quot; but has &quot;tended to agree with those who do not favor federal funding for abortion, because I believe that those who hold a strong moral view on the other side should not be forced to fund&quot; the procedure.&lt;ref name = &quot;4Condi2005&quot;/&gt;

==Discrimination==
Rice experienced firsthand the injustices of Birmingham's discriminatory laws and attitudes. She was instructed to walk proudly in public and to use the facilities at home rather than subject herself to the indignity of &quot;colored&quot; facilities in town. As Rice recalls of her parents and their peers, &quot;they refused to allow the limits and injustices of their time to limit our horizons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Birmingham native Condoleezza Rice confirmation vote delayed as next U.S. Secretary of State&quot; ''Birmingham Times'' January 20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Rice recalls various times in which she suffered discrimination on account of her race, which included being relegated to a storage room at a department store instead of a regular dressing room, being barred from going to the circus or the local amusement park, being denied hotel rooms, and even being given bad food at restaurants.&lt;ref name=ice&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/people/shows/rice/timeline.html|title=CNN Programs: People in the News|accessdate=June 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, while Rice was mostly kept by her parents from areas where she might face discrimination, she was very aware of the civil rights struggle and the problems of [[Jim Crow laws]] in Birmingham. A neighbor, Juliemma Smith, described how &quot;[Condi] used to call me and say things like, 'Did you see what [[Bull Connor]] did today?' She was just a little girl and she did that all the time. I would have to read the newspaper thoroughly because I wouldn't know what she was going to talk about.&quot;&lt;ref name=ice /&gt; Rice herself said of the segregation era: &quot;Those terrible events burned into my consciousness. I missed many days at my segregated school because of the frequent bomb threats.&quot;&lt;ref name=ice /&gt;

During the violent days of the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights Movement]], Reverend Rice armed himself and kept guard over the house while Condoleezza practiced the piano inside.

==Public perception and criticism==
[[Image:Rice at Boston College.jpg|thumb|left|Rice makes an appearance at Boston College, where she is greeted by Father [[William P. Leahy|William Leahy]].]]
Rice has been criticized both in the U.S. and abroad for her involvement in the [[George W. Bush administration]]. Protesters have sought to exclude her from appearing at schools such as [[Princeton University]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Juel-Larsen.

===''Time'' and ''Forbes'' magazines===
Rice has appeared four times on the [[Time 100]], [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]]'s list of the world's 100 most influential people. Rice is one of only nine people in the world whose influence has been considered enduring enough to have made the list—first compiled in 1999 as a retrospective of the 20th century and made an annual feature in 2004—so frequently. However, the list contains people who have the influence to change for better or for worse, and ''Time'' has also accused her of squandering her influence, stating on February 1, 2007, that her &quot;accomplishments as Secretary of State have been modest, and even those have begun to fade&quot; and that she &quot;has been slow to recognize the extent to which the U.S.'s prestige has declined.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1584810,00.html &quot;Rice's Toughest Mission&quot;], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', February 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In its March 19, 2007 issue it followed up stating that Rice was &quot;executing an unmistakable course correction in U.S. foreign policy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1597226,00.html &quot;Cheney In Twilight&quot;], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', March 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 and 2005, she was ranked as the most powerful woman in the world by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine and number two in 2006 (following the [[Chancellor of Germany (Federal Republic)|Chancellor of Germany]], [[Angela Merkel]]).&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, Elizabeth and Chana R.

===Criticism from Senator Barbara Boxer===
[[California]] Democratic Senator [[Barbara Boxer]] has also criticized Rice in relation to the [[war in Iraq]]: &quot;I personally believe—this is my personal view—that your loyalty to the mission you were given, to sell the war, overwhelmed your respect for the truth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27818-2005Jan21.html &quot;Why the Crass Remarks About Rice?&quot;]. ''[[The Washington Post]]'', January 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 11, 2007, Boxer, in a debate over the [[war in Iraq]], said, &quot;Now, the issue is who pays the price, who pays the price? I'm not going to pay a personal price. My kids are too old, and my grandchild is too young. You're not going to pay a particular price, as I understand it, within immediate family. So who pays the price? The American military and their families, and I just want to bring us back to that fact.&quot;

The ''[[New York Post]]'' and [[White House Press Secretary]] [[Tony Snow]] called Boxer's statement an attack on Rice's status as a single, childless female and referred to Boxer's comments as &quot;a great leap backward for feminism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nochildren&quot;&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,243359,00.html &quot;White House Spokesman Blasts Sen.

I'm saying, she's like me, we do not have families who are in the military.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/12/washington/12cnd-rice.html?ex=1176350400&amp;en=b000ac5ebcd6d164&amp;ei=5070 &quot;Exchange Turns Into Political Flashpoint&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conservative criticism===
According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in late July 2008, former Undersecretary of State and U.N. Ambassador [[John R. Bolton]] was referring to Rice and her allies in the Bush Administration whom he believes have abandoned earlier hard-line principles when he said: &quot;Once the collapse begins, adversaries have a real opportunity to gain advantage. In terms of the Bush presidency, this many reversals this close to the end destroys credibility... It appears there is no depth to which this administration will not sink in its last days.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Eggen, WashingtonPost2008&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Former [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] repeatedly criticized Rice after their terms in office ended. In his book ''[[Known and Unknown: A Memoir]]'', he portrayed her as a young, inexperienced academic who didn’t know her place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2011/02/14/rummys-still-swinging/|title=Rumsfeld lashes out at John McCain, Condoleezza Rice, and others.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 she finally responded, saying that Rumsfeld &quot;Doesn't know what he's talking about.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In his book ''In My Time'', [[Dick Cheney]] suggested that Rice had misled the president about nuclear diplomacy with North Korea, saying she was naïve. He called her advice on the issue “utterly misleading.&quot; 

He also chided Rice for clashing with White House advisers on the tone of the president's speeches on Iraq and said that she, as the Secretary of State, ruefully conceded to him that the Bush administration should not have apologized for a claim the president made in his 2003 State of the Union address, on Saddam's supposed search for yellowcake uranium. She “came into my office, sat down in the chair next to my desk, and tearfully admitted I had been right,&quot; Cheney wrote. 

Rice responded: &quot;It certainly doesn't sound like me, now, does it?&quot;, saying that she viewed the book as an “attack on my integrity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;www.csmonitor.com, September 1, 2011, Condi Rice fires back at Dick Cheney by Husna Haq, [http://www.csmonitor.com/Books/chapter-and-verse/2011/0901/Condi-Rice-fires-back-at-Dick-Cheney]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rice has also been criticized by other conservatives. Stephen Hayes of the ''Weekly Standard'' accused her of jettisoning the [[Bush Doctrine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Stephen F. |last=Hayes |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/015/145jmmdg.asp |title=In the Driver's Seat |journal=[[Weekly Standard]] |volume=13 |issue=36 |date=October 9, 2006 |accessdate=May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other conservatives criticized her for her approach to Russia policy and other issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Claudia |last=Rosett |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/366040/georgia-and-the-american-cowboy/claudia-rosett |title=Georgia and the American Cowboy |work=[[National Review]] |date=August 12, 2008 |accessdate=May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many criticize Rice in particular for her opposition to the change of strategy in Iraq and surge in U.S. forces that began in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Scott |last=Johnson |url=http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2008/05/020591.php |title=Fried Rice |work=[[Power Line]] |date=May 24, 2008 |accessdate=May 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Views within the black community===
[[Image:RiceRatings.png|thumb|right|Rice's [[approval rating]]s from January 2005 to September 2006]]

Rice's ratings decreased following a heated battle for her confirmation as Secretary of State and following [[Hurricane Katrina]] in August 2005. Rice's rise within the [[George W. Bush administration]] initially drew a largely positive response from many in the black community. In a 2002 survey, then National Security Advisor Rice was viewed favorably by 41% of black respondents, but another 40% did not know Rice well enough to rate her and her profile remained comparatively obscure.&lt;ref name=Tilove&gt;Jonathon Tilove. [http://jonathantilove.com/black-america-powell-rice/ For Black America, The Thrill of Powell and Rice Is Gone]. Newhouse News Service, March 11, 2004. Retrieved June 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; As her role increased, some black commentators began to express doubts concerning Rice's stances and statements on various issues. In 2005, ''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist [[Eugene Robinson (journalist)|Eugene Robinson]] asked, &quot;How did [Rice] come to a worldview so radically different from that of most black Americans?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Robinson. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/24/AR2005102401370.html What Rice Can't See]. [[The Washington Post]], October 25, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rice and Downer at the Reagan Library May 23, 2007.jpg|thumb|left|Rice and Australian Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]] participate in a news conference at the [[Ronald Reagan Presidential Library]] in [[Simi Valley]], [[California]], May 23, 2007.]]

Other writers have also noted what they perceive to be a distance between Rice and the black community. ''The Black Commentator'' magazine described sentiments given in a speech by Rice at a black gathering as &quot;more than strange—they were evidence of profound personal disorientation. A black woman who doesn't know how to talk to black people is of limited political use to an administration that has few black allies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackcommentator.com/84/84_cover_condi.html Condoleezza's Crimes]. ''[[The Black Commentator]]'', April 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; When Rice invoked the [[civil rights movement]] to clarify her position on the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]], Margaret Kimberley, another writer for ''The Black Commentator'', felt that her use of the rhetoric was &quot;offensive.&quot; Stan Correy, an interviewer from the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], characterized many blacks involved with civil rights and politics as viewing this rhetoric as &quot;cynical.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stan Correy. [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/bbing/stories/s1338813.htm Condoleezza, Condoleezza]. ABC Radio National, April 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Rice was also described by Bill Fletcher, Jr., the former leader of the [[TransAfrica Forum]], a [[foreign policy]] [[lobbying]] organization in [[Washington, D.C.]], as &quot;very cold and distant and only black by accident.&quot;&lt;ref name=Tilove /&gt; In August 2005, American musician, actor, and [[social activist]] [[Harry Belafonte]], who serves on the Board of TransAfrica, referred to blacks in the Bush administration as &quot;black tyrants.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Marc Merano. [http://web.archive.org/web/20080417052022/http://www.cnsnews.com/ViewSpecialReports.asp?Page=%5cSpecialReports%5carchive%5c200508%5cSPE20050808a.html Harry Belafonte Calls Black Republicans 'Tyrants']. Cybercast News Service, August 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Belafonte's comments received mixed reactions.&lt;ref name=Tilove /&gt;

Rice has defended herself from such criticism on several occasions. During a September 14, 2005 interview, she said, &quot;Why would I worry about something like that? ... The fact of the matter is I've been black all my life. Nobody needs to tell me how to be black.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://2001-2009.state.gov/secretary/rm/2005/53155.htm Interview with Bill O'Reilly of the O'Reilly Factor on Fox News] September 14, 2005.

Notable black commentators have defended Rice, including [[Mike Espy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080303100627/http://www.mmegi.bw/2005/October/Tuesday25/825547845951.html Mrs President].

==Family and personal life==
In the 1970s, Condoleezza Rice dated and was briefly engaged to American football player [[Rick Upchurch]].  She left him because, according to her biographer Marcus Mabry, “She knew the relationship wasn't going to work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Mabry| first = Marcus| title =Twice As Good: Condoleezza Rice and Her Path to Power | publisher = Modern Times| date = May 1, 2007| isbn =1-59486-362-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her mother, Angelena Rice, died of breast cancer in August 1985, aged 61.&lt;ref&gt;Reitwiesner, William Addams.[http://www.wargs.com/political/rice.html ''The Ancestors of Condoleezza Rice'']&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1989, Condoleezza's father, John Wesley Rice, married Clara Bailey,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/29/us/john-wesley-rice-jr-77-father-of-bush-adviser.html John Wesley Rice Jr., 77, Father of Bush Adviser] New York Times.
