'''Timothy James''' &quot;'''Tim'''&quot; '''McVeigh''' (April 23, 1968&amp;nbsp;– June 11, 2001) was an [[United States|American]] [[domestic terrorist]] who detonated a truck bomb in front of the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] in [[Oklahoma City]] on April 19, 1995. Commonly referred to as the [[Oklahoma City bombing|Oklahoma City Bombing]], the attack killed 168 people and injured over 800.&lt;ref name=&quot;OSDH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Shariat|first=Sheryll|coauthors=Sue Mallonee and Shelli Stephens-Stidham|title=Summary of Reportable Injuries in Oklahoma|publisher=Oklahoma State Department of Health|url=http://www.health.state.ok.us/PROGRAM/injury/Summary/bomb/OKCbomb.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080110063748/http://www.health.state.ok.us/PROGRAM/injury/Summary/bomb/OKCbomb.htm|archivedate=January&amp;nbsp;10, 2008|date=December&amp;nbsp;1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the deadliest act of [[terrorism]] within the United States prior to the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OSDH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Shariat|first=Sheryll|coauthors=Sue Mallonee and Shelli Stephens-Stidham|title=Summary of Reportable Injuries in Oklahoma|publisher=Oklahoma State Department of Health|url=http://www.health.state.ok.us/PROGRAM/injury/Summary/bomb/OKCbomb.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080110063748/http://www.health.state.ok.us/PROGRAM/injury/Summary/bomb/OKCbomb.htm|archivedate=January&amp;nbsp;10, 2008|date=December&amp;nbsp;1998|accessdate=June&amp;nbsp;5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McVeigh, a [[militia movement]] sympathizer, sought revenge against the federal government for its handling of the [[Waco Siege]], which had ended in the deaths of 76 people exactly two years prior to the bombing, as well as for the [[Ruby Ridge]] incident in 1992. McVeigh hoped to inspire a revolt against what he considered to be a tyrannical federal government. He was [[conviction (law)|convicted]] of 11 federal offenses and sentenced to death. His [[Capital punishment in the United States|execution]] took place on June 11, 2001 at the [[Federal Correctional Complex, Terre Haute|Federal Correctional Complex in Terre Haute, Indiana]]. [[Terry Nichols]] and [[Michael and Lori Fortier|Michael Fortier]] were also convicted as conspirators in the plot.

==Childhood==
McVeigh was born in [[Lockport (city), New York|Lockport, New York]], the only son and the second of three children of William and Mildred &quot;Mickey&quot; McVeigh. His parents divorced when he was 10 years old and he was raised by his father in [[Pendleton, New York]].&lt;ref name=washingtonpost/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/mcveigh.html |title=Ancestry of Tim McVeigh |publisher=Wargs.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McVeigh claimed to have been a target of [[bullying]] at school and that he took refuge in a fantasy world where he imagined retaliating against those bullies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/forum/1378651.stm | work=BBC News | title=McVeigh author Dan Herbeck quizzed | date=June 11, 2001 | accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of his life he would state his belief that the [[United States government]] is the ultimate bully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/1382540.stm | work=BBC News | title=Inside McVeigh's mind | date=June 11, 2001 | accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most who knew McVeigh remember him as being withdrawn, with a few describing him as an outgoing and playful child who withdrew as an adolescent. McVeigh is said to have had one girlfriend during his childhood, later stating to journalists he did not know how to impress girls.&lt;ref name=bbcprofile/&gt; According to his authorized biography, &quot;his only sustaining relief from his unsatisfied sex drive was his even stronger desire to die.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou and Herbeck, Dan|page=371|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in high school, McVeigh became interested in computers and hacked into government computer systems on his [[Commodore 64]], under a handle – &quot;The Wanderer&quot; – borrowed from the [[The Wanderer (Dion song)|song by Dion DiMucci]]. In his [[senior year]], McVeigh was named [[Starpoint Central School District|Starpoint Central High School]]'s &quot;most promising computer programmer,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou and Herbeck, Dan|pages=31–32|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; but maintained relatively poor grades up until his 1986 graduation.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost/&gt;

McVeigh was introduced to firearms by his grandfather, and told people he wanted to be a gun shop owner and sometimes took firearms to school to impress his classmates. McVeigh became intensely interested in [[gun rights]] after he graduated from high school, as well as the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution]], and read magazines such as ''[[Soldier of Fortune (magazine)|Soldier of Fortune]]''. He briefly attended [[Bryant &amp; Stratton College]] before dropping out.&lt;ref name=&quot;a mind&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=A Mind for Murder|last=Chase|first= Alston|page=370|isbn=0-393-32556-3}} found at [http://books.google.com/books?id=av5iRXPoXZYC&amp;pg=PA370&amp;lpg=PA370&amp;dq=%22Timothy+McVeigh%22+%2B+%22Bryant+and+Stratton%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=d4gRX0OvTS&amp;sig=1OcBGLOoeMELKFCFCukC4VVodYM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=VixnSvmMD52itgeQoPXxDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1 Google Books].

==Military life==
In May 1988, McVeigh graduated from U.S. Army Combat Engineer School, at age 20.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas O. Linder, [http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mcveigh/mcveighaccount.html &quot;The Oklahoma City Bombing &amp; The Trial of Timothy McVeigh,&quot;], online posting, [[University of Missouri–Kansas City]], Law School faculty projects, 2006, accessed August 7, 2006 feb 17; cf. ''[http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0106/09/pitn.00.html People in the News: Timothy McVeigh: The Path to Death Row]'', transcript of program broadcast on [[CNN]], June 9, 2001, 11:30 p.m. ET. [Specific citations to both of these sources and other unidentified sources are still needed throughout the above article.]&lt;/ref&gt; While in the military, McVeigh used much of his spare time to read about firearms, [[Sniper#Tactics|sniper tactics]], and explosives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou and Herbeck, Dan|page=61|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; McVeigh was reprimanded by the military for purchasing a &quot;[[White nationalism|White Power]]&quot; T-shirt at a [[Ku Klux Klan]] protest against black servicemen who wore what he viewed as &quot;[[Black Power]]&quot; T-shirts around the army base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou and Herbeck, Dan|pages=87–88|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McVeigh was awarded a [[Bronze Star Medal|Bronze Star]] for his service in the first [[Gulf War]]. He had been a top-scoring gunner with the 25mm cannon of the [[M2/M3 Bradley Fighting Vehicle|Bradley Fighting Vehicles]] used by the [[U.S. 1st Infantry Division]] to which he was assigned. He served at [[Fort Riley, Kansas]], before [[Operation Desert Storm]]. At Fort Riley, McVeigh completed the [[Primary Leadership Development Course]] (PLDC). McVeigh later would say that the Army taught him how to switch off his emotions.&lt;ref name=bbcprofile&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1321244.stm | work=BBC News | title=Profile: Timothy McVeigh | date=May 11, 2001 | accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had special lifesaving training and may have saved the life of a comrade who had life-threatening shrapnel wounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|page=73|author=Michel, Lou and Herbeck, Dan|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McVeigh aspired to join the [[United States Army Special Forces]] (SF). After returning from the Gulf War, he entered the selection program to become an SF soldier, but he quit after his psychological profile categorized him as very unsuitable for SF.&lt;ref&gt;Chosen Soldier: The Making of a Special Forces Warrior, Dick Couch / Crown Publishers, NY 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, McVeigh decided to leave the Army. He was discharged on December 31, 1991.&lt;ref&gt;See Hoffman, [http://www.constitution.org/ocbpt/ocbpt_02.htm &quot;'The Face of Terror'&quot;]; Hoffman finds many speculations published in the media about this episode in McVeigh's life as a soldier inaccurate and based on false information.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-military life ==
After leaving the army in 1992, McVeigh grew increasingly transient. At first he worked briefly near his hometown of Pendleton as a security guard, where he sounded off daily to his co-worker Carl Lebron, Jr. about his loathing for government. Deciding the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] area was too liberal, he left his job and began driving around America, seeking out his old friends from the Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;trutv5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/mcveigh/misfortune_5.html|title=Soldiers of Misfortune|last=Ottley|first=Ted|work=Timothy McVeigh &amp; Terry Nichols: Oklahoma Bombing|publisher=TruTv|accessdate=April 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McVeigh wrote letters to local newspapers complaining about taxes:{{quote|Taxes are a joke. Regardless of what a political candidate &quot;promises,&quot; they will increase. More taxes are always the answer to government mismanagement. They mess up. We suffer. Taxes are reaching cataclysmic levels, with no slowdown in sight. [...] Is a Civil War Imminent? Do we have to shed blood to reform the current system? I hope it doesn't come to that. But it might.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/OKC/faces/Suspects/McVeigh/1st-letter6-15/index.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080119111020/http://www.cnn.com/US/OKC/faces/Suspects/McVeigh/1st-letter6-15/index.html|archivedate=2008-01-19|title=McVeigh 1st letter|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

McVeigh also wrote to Representative [[John J. LaFalce]] ((D) New York){{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}, complaining about the arrest of a woman for carrying [[Mace (spray)|mace]]: {{quote|It is a lie if we tell ourselves that the police can protect us everywhere at all times. Firearms restrictions are bad enough, but now a woman can't even carry Mace in her purse?}}

It is claimed that while visiting friends in [[Decker, Michigan]], McVeigh complained that the Army had implanted a [[Microchip implant (human)|microchip]] into his buttocks so that the government could keep track of him.&lt;ref name=washingtonpost/&gt;

The long hours in a [[dead-end job]], the feeling that he did not have a home and his failure to establish a relationship with a woman brought McVeigh to the breaking point. He sought romance, but was rejected by a co-worker and still felt nervous around women. He felt he brought too much pain to his loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou and Herbeck, Dan|page=102|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew angry and [[Sexual frustration|frustrated]] at his difficulties in finding a girlfriend and took up [[obsessive gambling]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou and Herbeck, Dan|page=114|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unable to pay back gambling debts, he took a cash advance and then defaulted on his repayments. He then began looking for a state without heavy government regulation or high taxes. He became enraged when the government informed him that he had been overpaid $1,058 while in the army and he would need to pay back the money. He wrote an angry letter to the government inviting them to:{{quote|Go ahead, take everything I own; take my dignity. Feel good as you grow fat and rich at my expense; sucking my tax dollars and property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou and Herbeck, Dan|pages=117–118|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

McVeigh introduced his sister to anti-government literature, but his father had little interest in these views. He moved out of his father's house and into an apartment that had no telephone, which had the advantage of making it impossible for his employer to contact him for overtime assignments. He also quit the NRA, viewing its stance on gun rights to be too weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou and Herbeck, Dan|page=111|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1993 Waco siege and gun shows ===
In 1993, he drove to [[Waco, Texas]] during the [[Waco Siege]] to show his support. At the scene, he distributed pro-[[gun rights]] literature and bumper stickers, such as &quot;When guns are outlawed, I will become an outlaw.&quot; He told a student reporter: {{quote|The government is afraid of the guns people have because they have to have control of the people at all times. Once you take away the guns, you can do anything to the people. You give them an inch and they take a mile. I believe we are slowly turning into a socialist government. The government is continually growing bigger and more powerful and the people need to prepare to defend themselves against government control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eyeonhate.com/mcveigh/mcveigh6.html |title=Domestic Terrorism 101 – Timothy James McVeigh |publisher=Eyeonhate.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

For the five months following the Waco Siege, McVeigh worked at [[gun show]]s and handed out free cards printed up with [[Lon Horiuchi]]'s name and address, &quot;in the hope that somebody in the [[Patriot movement]] would assassinate the sharpshooter.&quot; (Horiuchi is an FBI sniper and some of his official actions have drawn controversy- specifically his shooting and killing of Randy Weaver's wife while she held an infant child.) He wrote [[hate mail]] to the sniper, suggesting that &quot;what goes around, comes around,&quot; and later considered putting aside his plan to target the Murrah Building to target Horiuchi, or a member of his family instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;amter&quot;&gt;Michel, Lou. &quot;American Terrorist&quot;, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

McVeigh spent more time on the [[gun show]] circuit,{{When|date=August 2010}} traveling to 40 of the 50 states and visiting about 80 gun shows in all. McVeigh found that the further west he went, the more anti-government sentiment he encountered, at least until he got to what he called &quot;The People's Socialist Republic of California.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou and Herbeck, Dan|page=121|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; McVeigh sold survival items and copies of ''[[The Turner Diaries]].'' One author said: {{quote|In the gun show culture, McVeigh found a home. Though he remained skeptical of some of the most extreme ideas being bandied around, he liked talking to people there about the [[United Nations]], the federal government and possible threats to American liberty.&lt;ref&gt;Handlin, Sam (2001) [http://www.courttv.com/news/mcveigh_special/profile_ctv.html &quot;Profile of a Mass Murderer: Who Is Timothy McVeigh?] Court TV Online.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Arizona with Fortiers ==
McVeigh had a road atlas with hand-drawn designations of the most likely places for nuclear attacks and considered buying property in [[Seligman, Arizona]], which he determined to be in a &quot;nuclear-free zone.&quot; McVeigh lived with [[Michael and Lori Fortier|Michael Fortier]] in [[Kingman, Arizona]], for a spell and grew so close to him that he served as [[best man]] at Fortier's wedding. McVeigh experimented with cannabis and [[methamphetamine]], after first researching their effects in an encyclopedia;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E3DA1438F937A25752C1A961958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Jury Hears of McVeigh Remarks About Nichols and Bomb Making | first=Jo | last=Thomas | date=November 14, 1997 | accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was not as interested in drugs as Fortier. One of the reasons they parted ways was McVeigh's boredom with Fortier's drug habits.&lt;ref name=&quot;trutv6&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/mcveigh/transit_6.html|title=Tim In Transit
|last=Ottley|first=Ted|work=Timothy McVeigh &amp; Terry Nichols: Oklahoma Bombing|publisher=TruTv|accessdate=April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McVeigh defended the practice of owning multiple guns, saying it was like the common practice of keeping an assortment of screwdrivers in one's toolbox; one needed to be sure of having the right tool for the job. He said that six particular guns were essential: a [[semi-automatic rifle|semiautomatic]], [[magazine-fed rifle]] (for defending against large mobs); a [[bolt-action]] hunting/[[sniper rifle]] (for killing [[Game (food)|large game]] or defending against an entrenched marauder); a [[shotgun]] (for fowl hunting); a [[.22 Long Rifle|.22 caliber rifle]] (to hone shooting skills and bag small game); and a [[Handgun|pistol]] (for close-in self-defense). He viewed guns as the first tool of freedom, necessary to protect supplies in the event America fell into chaos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou and Herbeck, Dan|pages=125–126|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== With Nichols, Waco siege, radicalisation and first explosives devices ==
In April 1993, McVeigh headed for a farm where co-conspirator [[Terry Nichols]] lived. In between watching coverage of the Waco siege on TV, Nichols and his brother began teaching McVeigh how to make explosives out of readily available materials; specifically, they combined household chemicals in plastic jugs. The destruction of the Waco compound enraged McVeigh and convinced him that it was time to take action. The government's use of [[CS gas]] on women and children angered McVeigh; he had been exposed to the gas as part of his military training and thus was familiar with its effects. The disappearance of certain evidence,&lt;ref name=&quot;missingdoor&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2000-08-18/pols_feature9.html | title = Prying Open the Case of the Missing Door | author = Robert Bryce | work = [[The Austin Chronicle]] | date = 2000-08-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the bullet-riddled steel-reinforced front door to the complex, led him to suspect a cover-up.

McVeigh's anti-government rhetoric became more radical. He began to sell [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]] hats riddled with bullet holes and a flare gun, which, he said, could shoot down an &quot;ATF helicopter.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn 3-29-01&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Editors (2000) [http://www.vpc.org/studies/tupfive.htm &quot;Gun Shows in America.&quot;] Violence Policy Center.&lt;/ref&gt; He produced videos detailing the government's actions at Waco and handed out pamphlets with titles like &quot;U.S. Government Initiates Open Warfare Against American People&quot; and &quot;Waco Shootout Evokes Memory of [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising|Warsaw '43]].&quot; He began changing his answering machine greeting every couple of weeks to various quotes by [[Patrick Henry]] such as &quot;Give me liberty or give me death.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou and Herbeck, Dan|pages=136–140|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began experimenting with [[pipe bomb]]s and other small explosive devices for the first time. The government also imposed new firearms restrictions in 1994 that McVeigh believed threatened his livelihood.&lt;ref name=&quot;trutv6&quot;/&gt;

McVeigh dissociated himself from his boyhood friend, Steve Hodge, by sending a 23-page farewell letter to him. He proclaimed his devotion to the [[United States Declaration of Independence]], explaining in detail what each sentence meant to him. McVeigh declared that: {{quote|Those who betray or subvert the Constitution are guilty of sedition and/or treason, are domestic enemies and should and will be punished accordingly.
&lt;p&gt;It also stands to reason that anyone who sympathizes with the enemy or gives aid or comfort to said enemy is likewise guilty.

McVeigh felt the need to personally reconnoiter sites of rumored conspiracies. He visited [[Area 51]] in order to defy government restrictions on photography and went to [[Gulfport, Mississippi]] to determine the veracity of rumors about [[United Nations]] operations. These turned out to be false; the Russian vehicles on the site were being configured for use in U.N.-sponsored humanitarian aid efforts. Around this time, McVeigh and Nichols also began making bulk purchases of [[ammonium nitrate]], an [[agriculture|agricultural]] [[fertilizer]], for resale to survivalists, since rumors were circulating that the government was preparing to ban it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou and Herbeck, Dan|pages=156–158|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plan against federal building or individuals ==
McVeigh told Fortier of his plans to blow up a federal building, but Fortier declined to participate. Fortier also told his wife about the plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou and Herbeck, Dan|pages=161–162|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; McVeigh composed two letters to the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms]], the first titled &quot;Constitutional Defenders&quot; and the second &quot;ATF Read.&quot; He denounced government officials as &quot;fascist tyrants&quot; and &quot;storm troopers&quot; and warned: {{quote|ATF, all you tyrannical people will swing in the wind one day for your treasonous actions against the Constitution of the United States. Remember the [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg War Trials]].&lt;ref name=&quot;trutv7&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/serial_killers/notorious/mcveigh/turner_7.html|title=Imitating Turner|last=Ottley|first=Ted|work=Timothy McVeigh &amp; Terry Nichols: Oklahoma Bombing|publisher=TruTv|accessdate=April 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

McVeigh also wrote a letter of recruitment to a customer named Steve Colbern: {{quote|A man with nothing left to lose is a very dangerous man and his energy/anger can be focused toward a common/righteous goal. What I'm asking you to do, then, is sit back and be honest with yourself. Do you have kids/wife? Would you back out at the last minute to care for the family? Are you interested in keeping your firearms for their current/future monetary value, or would you drag that '06 through rock, swamp and cactus...to get off the needed shot? In short, I'm not looking for talkers, I'm looking for fighters...And if you are a fed, think twice. Think twice about the Constitution you are supposedly enforcing (isn't &quot;enforcing freedom&quot; an oxymoron?) and think twice about catching us with our guard down&amp;nbsp;– you will lose just like [[William F.

McVeigh began announcing that he had progressed from the &quot;propaganda&quot; phase to the &quot;action&quot; phase. He wrote to his Michigan friend Gwenda Strider, &quot;I have certain other 'militant' talents that are in short supply and greatly demanded.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|author=Michel, Lou and Herbeck, Dan|page=195|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McVeigh later said he considered &quot;a campaign of individual assassination,&quot; with &quot;eligible&quot; targets including Attorney-General [[Janet Reno]], Judge [[Walter S. Smith Jr.]] of [[Federal District Court]], who handled the [[Branch Davidian]] trial, and [[Lon Horiuchi]], a member of the FBI hostage-rescue team who shot and killed Vicki Weaver in a standoff at a remote cabin at [[Ruby Ridge, Idaho]], in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digital-exp.com/doco/TimothyMcVeigh.html|title=Timothy McVeigh's Letter to Fox News|publisher=Digital-Exp.com|accessdate=April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he wanted Reno to accept &quot;full responsibility in deed, not just words.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kuna.net.kw/newsagenciespublicsite/ArticleDetails.aspx?Language=en&amp;id=1160520|title=McVeigh Considered Assassinating Reno, Other Officials|date=April 27, 2001|publisher=Kuwait News Agency|accessdate=April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such an assassination seemed too difficult,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1317593/McVeigh-'wanted-to-kill-US-attorney-general'.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=McVeigh 'wanted to kill US attorney general' | date=April 28, 2001 | accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he decided that since federal agents had become soldiers, it was necessary to strike against them at their command centers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E2DC1339F934A15757C0A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title=McVeigh Says He Considered Killing Reno | first=Susan | last=Saulny | date=April 27, 2001 | accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, according to ''American Terrorist'', ultimately he decided that he would make the loudest statement by bombing a federal building. After the bombing, he would come to have some ambivalence about his act, as expressed in letters to his hometown newspaper that he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations against police and government officials instead.&lt;ref name=Oklahoman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsok.com/article/700006/ |title=Ready for execution, McVeigh says he's sorry for deaths |publisher=Newsok.com |date=2001-06-09 |accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oklahoma City bombing==
{{Main|Oklahoma City bombing}}
[[File:TimothyMcVeighPerryOKApr2195.jpg|thumb|Timothy McVeigh about to be led out of a Perry, Oklahoma courthouse two days after the Oklahoma City bombing]]
Working at a lakeside campground near McVeigh's old Army post, he and Nichols constructed an [[ANFO|ANNM]] [[explosive device]] mounted in the back of a rented Ryder truck. This site was regarded as suitable because a moving truck would not seem out of place, given the transient population of the area.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} The bomb consisted of about 5,000 pounds (2,300&amp;nbsp;kg) of ammonium nitrate and [[nitromethane]], a motor-racing fuel.

On April 19, 1995, McVeigh drove the truck to the front of the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]] just as its offices opened for the day. Before arriving, he stopped to light a 2 minute fuse. At 09:02, a large explosion destroyed the north half of the building. The explosion killed 168 people, including 19 children in the day care center on the second floor, and injured 450 others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://209.232.239.37/gtd1/ViewIncident.aspx?id=6621 Global Terrorism Database]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Romano, Lois and Tom Kenworthy.[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/oklahoma/stories/ok042597.htm &quot;Prosecutor Paints McVeigh As 'Twisted' U.S. Terrorist&quot;], ''The Washington Post'', April 25, 1997, Page A01&lt;/ref&gt;

McVeigh noted that he had no knowledge that the federal offices also ran a daycare center on the second floor of the building, and noted that he might have chosen a different target if he had known about the daycare center.&lt;ref&gt;See Michel and Herbeck; cf. Walsh:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vidal&quot;/&gt; According to Michel and Herbeck, McVeigh claimed not to have known there was a daycare center in the Murrah Building and said that if he had known it, in his own words: {{quote|It might have given me pause to switch targets. That's a large amount of collateral damage.}}
Michel and Herbeck quote McVeigh, with whom they spoke for some 75 hours, on his attitude to the victims: {{quote|To these people in Oklahoma who have lost a loved one, I'm sorry but it happens every day. You're not the first mother to lose a kid, or the first grandparent to lose a grandson or a granddaughter. It happens every day, somewhere in the world. I'm not going to go into that courtroom, curl into a fetal ball and cry just because the victims want me to do that.}}

According to the Oklahoma City Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism (MIPT), more than 300 buildings were damaged. More than 12,000 volunteers and rescue workers took part in the rescue, recovery and support operations following the bombing. In reference to theories that he had assistance from others, McVeigh responded: {{quote|You can't handle the truth! Because the truth is, I blew up the Murrah Building and isn't it kind of scary that one man could wreak this kind of hell?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01E3DB173FF93AA15750C0A9679C8B63 | work=The New York Times | title='No Sympathy' for Dead Children, McVeigh Says | first=Jo | last=Thomas | date=March 29, 2001 | accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Arrest, trial, conviction and sentencing==
By tracing the [[Vehicle Identification Number]] (VIN) of a rear axle found in the wreckage, the [[FBI]] identified the vehicle as a [[Ryder]] Rental box truck rented from [[Junction City, Kansas]]. Workers at the agency assisted an FBI artist in creating a sketch of the renter, who had used the alias &quot;Robert Kling&quot;. The sketch was shown in the area. Lea McGown, manager of the local Dreamland Hotel, identified the sketch as Timothy McVeigh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,986240-5,00.html|title=Oklahoma City: The Weight Of Evidence|last=Collins|first=James|coauthors=Patrick E.

Shortly after the bombing, while driving on [[I-35]] in [[Noble County, Oklahoma|Noble County]], near [[Perry, Oklahoma]], McVeigh was stopped by [[Oklahoma Highway Patrol|Oklahoma State Trooper]] Charles J. Hanger from [[Pawnee, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.nleomf.com/TheFund/programs/OOM/hanger_oct01.htm &quot;Officer of the Month – October 2001:] Second Lieutenant Charles J. Hanger, Oklahoma Highway Patrol,&quot; ''National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund'', copyright 2004–2006. Retrieved August 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Hanger had passed McVeigh's yellow 1977 [[Mercury Marquis]] and noticed that it had no license plate. McVeigh admitted to the police officer (who noticed a bulge under his jacket) that he had a gun and McVeigh was subsequently arrested for having driven without plates and illegal firearm possession; McVeigh's [[concealed weapon]] permit was not legal in Oklahoma. McVeigh was wearing a T-shirt at that time with a picture of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the motto: ''[[sic semper tyrannis]]'' ('Thus always to tyrants'), the state motto of Virginia and also the words shouted by [[John Wilkes Booth]] after he shot Lincoln.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/notorious/mcveigh/turner_7.html |title=The Timothy McVeigh Story: The Oklahoma Bomber |accessdate=2007-07-12 |publisher=Crime Library }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the back, it had a tree with a picture of three blood droplets and the [[Thomas Jefferson]] quote, &quot;The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9704/28/okc/ | work=CNN | title='Turner Diaries' introduced in McVeigh trial | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, while still in jail, McVeigh was identified as the subject of the nationwide manhunt.

On August 10, 1995, McVeigh was indicted on 11 federal counts, including conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, use of a weapon of mass destruction, destruction by explosives and eight counts of first-degree murder.&lt;ref&gt;*Count 1 was &quot;conspiracy to detonate a weapon of mass destruction&quot; in violation of 18 USC § 2332a, culminating in the deaths of 168 people and destruction of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma.
* Count 2 was &quot;use of a weapon of mass destruction&quot; in violation of 18 USC § 2332a (2)(a) &amp; (b).
* Count 3 was &quot;destruction by explosives resulting in death&quot;, in violation of 18 USC § 844(f)(2)(a) &amp; (b).
* Counts 4 through 11 were first-degree murder in violation of 18 USC § 1111, 1114, &amp; 2 and 28 CFR § 64.2(h), each count in connection to one of the 8 law enforcement officers who were killed during the attack.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 20, 1996, the Court granted a [[change of venue]] and ordered that the case be transferred from [[Oklahoma City]] to the U.S. District Court in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], to be presided over by U.S. District Judge [[Richard Paul Matsch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/oklahoma/stories/judge.htm|title=Richard Matsch Has a Firm Grip on His Gavel in the Oklahoma City Bombing Trial|last=Romano|first=Lois|date=May 12, 1997|work=National Special Report: Oklahoma Bombing Trial|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McVeigh instructed his lawyers to use a [[necessity|necessity defense]], but they ended up not doing so,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0106/09/pitn.00.html | work=CNN | date=February 7, 2001 | accessdate=May 25, 2010 | title=People In The News}}&lt;/ref&gt; because they would have had to prove that McVeigh was in &quot;imminent danger&quot; from the government. (McVeigh himself argued that &quot;imminent&quot; did not necessarily mean &quot;immediate.&quot;) They would have argued that his bombing of the Murrah building was a justifiable response to what McVeigh believed were the crimes of the U.S. government at [[Waco Siege|Waco]], Texas. The 51-day siege of the [[Branch Davidian]] complex resulted in the deaths of 76 Branch Davidians.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas O.

On June 2, 1997, McVeigh was found guilty on all 11 counts of the federal indictment.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Eddy, George Lane, Howard Pankratz and Steven Wilmsen, [http://extras.denverpost.com/bomb/bombv1.htm &quot;Guilty on Every Count,&quot;] ''Denver Post Online'' June 3, 1997, accessed August 7, 2006:

:Although 168 people, including 19 children, were killed in the April 19, 1995, bombing, murder charges were brought against McVeigh only for the eight federal agents who were on duty when the bomb destroyed much of the Murrah Building.

:Along with the eight counts of murder, McVeigh was charged with conspiracy to use a weapon of mass destruction, using a weapon of mass destruction and destroying a federal building.

:Oklahoma City District Attorney Bob Macy said he would file state charges in the other 160 murders after McVeigh's co-defendant, Terry Nichols, was tried.&lt;/ref&gt;

McVeigh tried to calm his mother by saying, &quot;Think of it this way. When I was in the Army, you didn't see me for years. Think of me that way now, like I'm away in the Army again, on an assignment for the military.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|page=347|author=Michel, Lou and Herbeck, Dan|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because McVeigh was convicted and sentenced to death, the State of Oklahoma did not file murder charges against McVeigh for the other 160 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0106/09/pitn.00.html People in the News: Timothy McVeigh: The Path to Death Row]'', transcript of program broadcast on [[CNN]], June 9, 2001, 11:30 p.m. ET.&lt;/ref&gt; Before the sentence was formally pronounced by Judge Matsch, McVeigh addressed the court for the first time and said simply:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.outpost-of-freedom.com/mcveigh/okc0814mv.htm|title=What did Timothy McVeigh really say?|last=Hunt|first=Gary|publisher=Outpost of Freedom|accessdate=April 12, 2010&lt;!--reliable source??--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  {{quote|If the Court please, I wish to use the words of [[Louis Brandeis|Justice Brandeis]] dissenting in [[Olmstead v.

==Motivations for the bombing==
{{rquote|right|&quot;Why? McVeigh told us at eloquent length, but our rulers and their media preferred to depict him as a sadistic, crazed monster ... who had done it for the kicks&quot;.|[[Gore Vidal]], 2002&lt;ref name=&quot;vidal&quot;/&gt;}}
McVeigh claimed that the bombing was revenge for &quot;what the U.S. government did at [[Waco Siege|Waco]] and [[Ruby Ridge]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.rickross.com/reference/mcveigh/mcveigh6.html &quot;McVeigh Remorseless About Bombing,&quot;] newswire release, [[Associated Press]], March 29, 2001, reposted on rickross.com. Retrieved August 8, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  McVeigh visited Waco during the standoff. While there, he was interviewed by student reporter Michelle Rauch, a senior journalism major at [[Southern Methodist University|SMU]] who was writing for the school paper. McVeigh expressed his objections over what was happening there.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rauch's Waco testimony&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mcveigh/mcveighwaco.html|title=Timothy McVeigh in Waco|date=|publisher=UMKC.edu|accessdate=August 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McVeigh frequently quoted and alluded to the novel ''[[The Turner Diaries]]''; while rejecting the book's racism,&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn 3-29-01&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/03/29/profile.mcveigh/|title=Timothy McVeigh: Convicted Oklahoma City Bomber|date=March 29, 2001|publisher=CNN|accessdate=April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vidal&quot;&gt;[[Gore Vidal]], &quot;Perpetual War for Perpetual Peace&quot;, pages 1 &amp; 81&lt;/ref&gt; he claimed to appreciate its interest in firearms. Photocopies of pages sixty-one and sixty-two of ''The Turner Diaries'' were found in an envelope inside McVeigh's car. These pages depicted a fictitious mortar attack upon the U.S. Capitol in Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Michel and Herbeck; cf. Walsh.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1,200-word essay &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McVeigh|first=Timothy J.|title=An Essay on Hypocrisy|journal=Media Bypass magazine|year=1998|month=June}}&lt;/ref&gt; dated March 1998, from the federal maximum-security prison at Florence, Colo., McVeigh claimed that the terrorist bombing was “morally equivalent” to U.S. military actions against Iraq and other foreign lands.

{{quote|The administration has said that Iraq has no right to stockpile chemical or biological weapons (“weapons of mass destruction”) — mainly because they have used them in the past.

Well, if that’s the standard by which these matters are decided, then the U.S. is the nation that set the precedent. The U.S. has stockpiled these same weapons (and more) for over 40 years. The U.S. claims this was done for deterrent purposes during its “Cold War” with the Soviet Union. Why, then, it is invalid for Iraq to claim the same reason (deterrence) with respect to Iraq’s (real) war with, and the continued threat of, its neighbor Iran?

The administration claims that Iraq has used these weapons in the past. We’ve all seen the pictures that show a Kurdish woman and child frozen in death from the use of chemical weapons. But, have you ever seen those pictures juxtaposed next to pictures from Hiroshima or Nagasaki?

I suggest that one study the histories of World War I, World War II and other “regional conflicts” that the U.S. has been involved in to familiarize themselves with the use of “weapons of mass destruction.”

Remember Dresden? How about Hanoi? Tripoli? Baghdad? What about the big ones — Hiroshima and Nagasaki? (At these two locations, the U.S. killed at least 150,000 non-combatants — mostly women and children — in the blink of an eye. Thousands more took hours, days, weeks or months to die).

If Saddam is such a demon, and people are calling for war crimes charges and trials against him and his nation, why do we not hear the same cry for blood directed at those responsible for even greater amounts of “mass destruction” — like those responsible and involved in dropping bombs on the cities mentioned above?

The truth is, the U.S. has set the standard when it comes to the stockpiling and use of weapons of mass destruction.}}

The handwritten essay, submitted to and published by the alternative national news magazine Media Bypass, was distributed worldwide by The Associated Press on May 29, 1998. Ironically, it made global headlines alongside reports that Pakistan, following the suit of its neighbor and bitter rival India, had just detonated a nuclear device.

The essay, which marked the first time that McVeigh publicly discussed the Oklahoma City bombing, continued:

{{quote|Hypocrisy when it comes to the death of children? In Oklahoma City, it was family convenience that explained the presence of a day-care center placed between street level and the law enforcement agencies which occupied the upper floors of the building. Yet, when discussion shifts to Iraq, any day-care center in a government building instantly becomes “a shield.” Think about it.

(Actually, there is a difference here. The administration has admitted to knowledge of the presence of children in or near Iraqi government buildings, yet they still proceed with their plans to bomb —saying that they cannot be held responsible if children die. There is no such proof, however, that knowledge of the presence of children existed in relation to the Oklahoma City bombing.)

When considering morality and “mens rea” [criminal intent], in light of these facts, I ask: Who are the true barbarians? ...

I find it ironic, to say the least, that one of the aircraft used to drop such a bomb on Iraq is dubbed “The Spirit of Oklahoma.” This leads me to a final, and unspoken, moral hypocrisy regarding the use of weapons of mass destruction.

When a U.S. plane or cruise missile is used to bring destruction to a foreign people, this nation rewards the bombers with applause and praise. What a convenient way to absolve these killers of any responsibility for the destruction they leave in their wake.

Unfortunately, the morality of killing is not so superficial. The truth is, the use of a truck, a plane or a missile for the delivery of a weapon of mass destruction does not alter the nature of the act itself.

These are weapons of mass destruction — and the method of delivery matters little to those on the receiving end of such weapons.

Whether you wish to admit it or not, when you approve, morally, of the bombing of foreign targets by the U.S. military, you are approving of acts morally equivalent to the bombing in Oklahoma City ...}}

McVeigh included photocopies of a famous Vietnam War-era picture showing terrified children fleeing napalm bombs, and of nuclear devastation in Japan. He said in a preface that the essay was intended to “provoke thought — and was not written with malevolent intent.”

In interviews before his execution, documented in ''[[American Terrorist]]'', McVeigh stated he decapitated an Iraqi soldier with cannon fire on his first day in the war and celebrated.  But he said he later was shocked to be ordered to execute surrendering prisoners and to see [[Highway of Death|carnage on the road]] leaving [[Kuwait City]] after U.S. troops routed the Iraqi army. In interviews following the Oklahoma City bombing, McVeigh said he began harboring anti-government feelings during the [[Gulf War]].

On April 26, 2001, he wrote a letter to Fox News, ''I Explain Herein Why I Bombed the Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City'', which explicitly laid out his reasons for the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,17500,00.html|title=McVeigh's Apr. 26 Letter to Fox News|date=April 26, 2001|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=April 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; McVeigh read ''[[Unintended Consequences (novel)|Unintended Consequences]]'' and noted that if it had come out a few years earlier, he would have given serious consideration to using sniper attacks in a [[Attrition warfare|war of attrition]] against the government instead of bombing a federal building:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=American Terrorist|page=304|author=Michel, Lou and Herbeck, Dan|isbn=0-06-039407-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accomplices==
In addition to McVeigh, [[Terry Nichols]] was convicted and sentenced in federal court to life in prison for his role in the crime. At Nichols' trial, evidence was presented indicating that others may have been involved. Several residents of central Kansas, including real estate agent Georgia Rucker and a retired Army NCO, testified at Terry Nichols' federal trial that they had seen two trucks at Geary Lake State Park, where prosecutors alleged the bomb was assembled. The retired NCO said he visited the lake on April 18, 1995, but left after a group of surly men looked at him aggressively. The operator of the Dreamland Motel testified that two Ryder trucks had been parked outside her Grandview Plaza motel where McVeigh stayed in Room 26 the weekend before the bombing. Terry Nichols is currently incarcerated at the [[United States Penitentiary, Florence ADX|Federal Supermax Prison]] in Florence, Colorado.

An ATF informant, Carolyn Howe, told reporters that shortly before the bombing she had warned her handlers that guests of [[Elohim City, Oklahoma]] were planning a major bombing attack.  McVeigh was issued a speeding ticket there at the same time. Other than this speeding ticket, there is no evidence of a connection between McVeigh and members of the [[Midwest Bank Robbers]] at Elohim City.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

In February 2004, the FBI announced it would review its investigation after learning that agents in the investigation of the Midwest Bank Robbers (an alleged [[Aryan]]-oriented gang) had turned up explosive caps of the same type that were used to trigger the Oklahoma City bomb. Agents expressed surprise that bombing investigators had not been provided information from the Midwest Bank Robbers investigation.

McVeigh declined further delays and maintained until his death that he had acted alone in the bombing.
