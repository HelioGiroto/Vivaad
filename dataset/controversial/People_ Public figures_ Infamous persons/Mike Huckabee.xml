'''Michael Dale &quot;Mike&quot; Huckabee''' (born August 24, 1955) is an American politician who served as the [[List of Governors of Arkansas|44th]] [[Governor of Arkansas|Governor]] of [[Arkansas]] (1996–2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/02/25/jindal.reaction/index.html | work=CNN | title=Jindal earns bad reviews in national debut – CNN.com | date=February 26, 2009 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ANB&quot;&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Arkansas News Bureau |url=http://www.arkansasnews.com/archive/2005/11/03/News/330343.html |title=Huckabee remains the highest-rated political figure in the state |date=2005-11-03 |accessdate=2007-10-26 |last=Sadler |first=Aaron |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071014223541/http://arkansasnews.com/archive/2005/11/03/News/330343.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a candidate in the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 United States Republican presidential primaries]], finishing second in delegate count and third in both popular vote and number of states won (behind both [[John McCain]] and [[Mitt Romney]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/national.php?year=2008&amp;minper=0&amp;f=0&amp;off=0&amp;elect=2 |title=Final GOP delegate count.

==Early life==
Huckabee was born in [[Hope, Arkansas]],&lt;ref name = &quot;Barone 136–137&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Almanac of American Politics|last=Barone|first=Michael|coauthors=Grant Ujifusa|year=1999|publisher=National Journal|location=Washington, DC |isbn=0-8129-3194-7|pages=136–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; to Mae (née Elder; 1925–1999) and Dorsey Wiles Huckabee (1923–1996), conservative Southern Democrats. He has cited his working-class upbringing as the reason for his de-centralized populist conservative political views;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/vote2008/blog/2008/01/in_close_contest_huckabee_hits.html|title=Online NewsHour: Reporters' Blog &amp;#124; In Close Contest, Huckabee Hits States Rights, Populist Themes &amp;#124; January 19, 2008|publisher=PBS|date=2008-01-19|accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; his father worked as a fireman and mechanic, and his mother worked as a clerk at a gas company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=ABC News|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WN/WhoIs/story?id=3746628&amp;page=1|title=Get to Know Mike Huckabee;Former Arkansas Governor Hopes to Go From the Pulpit to the Oval Office|date=2007-10-18|accessdate=2007-11-17|last=Wiener|first=Jared}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

His first job, at 14, was working at a radio station where he read the news and weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Huckabee |first=Mike |title=Character Is The Issue |publisher=Broadman &amp; Holman |year=1997 |location=Nashville |page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was elected Governor of Arkansas by his chapter of the [[American Legion]]-sponsored [[Boys State]] program in 1972&lt;ref name=&quot;Barone 136–137&quot;/&gt; and is a [[Hugh O'Brian Youth Leadership Foundation]] alumnus. He was student council vice president at [[Hope High School (Arkansas)|Hope High School]] during the 1971–72 school year. He was student council president at [[Hope High School (Arkansas)|Hope High School]] during the 1972–1973 school year.&lt;ref name=&quot;scottparks&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Parks |first=Scott |date=February 9, 1997 |title=Huckabee's not preaching to choir;Arkansas governor leads largely Democratic state |work=[[Dallas Morning News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has one sister, Mrs. Pat Harris, a middle school teacher.&lt;ref name=&quot;brianlamb&quot;&gt;{{cite news |publisher=CSPAN |url=http://www.q-and-a.org/Transcript/?ProgramID=1010&amp;QueryText=Huckabee |title=Q&amp;A by Brian Lamb interview with Mike Huckabee |date=February 13, 2005 |accessdate=November 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huckabee married his wife, Janet, on May 25, 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;brianlamb&quot; /&gt; He graduated ''[[Latin honors|magna cum laude]]'' from [[Ouachita Baptist University]], completing his [[bachelor's degree]] in Religion in 2½ years before attending [[Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]. He dropped out of the seminary after one year in order to take a job in Christian broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Montanaro|first=Domenico|coauthors=Lauren Appelbaum|title=Huck on 'Theology' degree|publisher=MSNBC|date=2007-12-14|url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/12/14/518108.aspx|accessdate=2007-12-16}}

==Pastoral career==
At 21, Huckabee was a staffer for [[James Robison (televangelist)|James Robison]], a [[Televangelism|television evangelist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;scottparks&quot;/&gt; Robison commented, &quot;His convictions shape his character and his character will shape his policies. His whole life has been shaped by moral absolutes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;scottparks&quot;/&gt; Huckabee has stated, &quot;Politics are totally directed by worldview. That's why when people say, 'We ought to separate politics from religion,' I say to separate the two is absolutely impossible&quot;.{{cn|date=September 2012}}

Prior to his political career, Huckabee served as pastor at Immanuel Baptist Church in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]] from 1980 to 1986 and the Beech Street Baptist Church in [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]] from 1986 to 1992. In both Texarkana and Pine Bluff Huckabee started 24-hour television stations &quot;where he produced documentaries and hosted a program called ''Positive Alternatives''.&lt;ref name = &quot;Barone 136–137&quot;/&gt; He encouraged the all-white Immanuel Baptist Church to accept black members in the mid 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;scottparks&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Isikoff&quot;/&gt; He served as president of a religion-oriented television station.

In 1989 Huckabee ran against the Rev. Dr. [[Ronnie Floyd]] of Springdale for the presidency of the Arkansas Baptist State Convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Scudder |first=James |title=Southern Baptists face crucial week //Baptist fuss is taking its toll |publisher=Arkansas Democrat-gazette |date=1990-06-11}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Huckabee won and served as president from 1989 to 1991.

==Early political career==
In 1992, in Huckabee's first political race, he lost to [[incumbent]] Senator and [[conservative Democrat]] [[Dale Bumpers]], receiving 40 percent of the vote in the [[general election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5DE163FF936A35752C1A964958260|title=THE 1992 ELECTIONS: STATE BY STATE; SOUTH|date=November 5, 1992|publisher=The New York Times | first1=John H. | last1=Cushman Jr | first2=James | last2=Dao | first3=Jason | last3=DeParle | first4=Clifford | last4=Krauss | first5=Stephen | last5=Labaton | first6=Neil A. | last6=Lewis | first7=David | last7=Margolick | first8=Maria | last8=Newman | first9=Martin | last9=Tolchin | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same election saw Arkansas Governor [[Bill Clinton]] ascend to the Presidency, making Lieutenant Governor [[Jim Guy Tucker]] the new Governor. In 1993, Republican state chairman [[Asa Hutchinson]] urged Huckabee to run in the [[special election]] for lieutenant governor held on July 27. Realizing his loss came among key conservative Democrats, Huckabee ran a decidedly conservative campaign appealing to several important conservative groups such as the [[Council of Conservative Citizens]] (CofCC). In the subsequent general election, he defeated [[Nate Coulter]], who had been Bumpers' campaign manager the previous year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_n5_v14/ai_14558214/pg_2 |title=GOP wins one in Arkansas – Republican Party; Mike Huckabee &amp;#124; Campaigns &amp; Elections &amp;#124; Find Articles at BNET.com&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt; |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-16 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080107151043/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m2519/is_n5_v14/ai_14558214/pg_2 |archivedate = January 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 51–49 percent.&lt;ref name = &quot;Barone 136–137&quot;/&gt; Huckabee became only the second Republican since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] to serve as Arkansas lieutenant governor, the first having been [[Maurice Britt]] from 1967 to 1971.

In his autobiography ''From Hope to Higher Ground'', Huckabee recalled the chilly reception that he received from the Arkansas Democratic establishment on his election as lieutenant governor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The doors to my office were spitefully nailed shut from the inside, office furniture and equipment were removed, and the budget spent down to almost nothing prior to our arriving. After fifty-nine days of public outcry, the doors were finally opened for me to occupy the actual office I had been elected to hold two months earlier.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Huckabee, ''From Hope to Higher Ground'', pp. 6–7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Dick Morris]], who had previously worked for [[Bill Clinton]], advised Huckabee on his races in 1993, 1994 and 1998.&lt;ref name = &quot;RexNelson&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=Rex|date=1995-07-02|title=Clinton's Hired Gun Gives Huckabee Hand: Lieutenant Governor Shooting for Senate|publisher=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huckabee commented that Morris was a &quot;personal friend&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;RexNelson&quot;/&gt; A newspaper article reported on Huckabee's 1993 win: &quot;Morris said the mistake Republicans always make is that they are too much of a country club set. What we wanted to do was run a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] campaign that would appeal to all Arkansans.'&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;RexNelson&quot;/&gt;

Morris elaborated, &quot;So we opened the campaign with ads that characterized Mike as more of a [[moderate]] whose values were the same as those of other Arkansans.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;RexNelson&quot;/&gt; Consequently, he abandoned his earlier support for the CofCC when in April 1994 following an adverse media campaign against the CofCC, Huckabee withdrew from a speaking engagement before their national convention. He repeated the accusations made by various media and left-wing organizations such as the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] recalling his past association with the CofCC saying, &quot;I will not participate in any program that has [[racism|racist]] overtones. I've spent a lifetime fighting [against] racism and [[anti-Semitism]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Duhart |first=Bill |coauthors= |title=Huckabee won't appear with racist. |work= |pages= |language= |publisher=Philadelphia Tribune |date=1994-04-12 |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Huckabee was re-elected to a full term as lieutenant governor, beating Democratic candidate Charlie Cole Chaffin with nearly 59 percent of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=3929|title=1994 AR Lt.

(says &quot;Last Modified: Site Builder July 13, 2005 11:50pm,&quot; but it's for a poll that happened in 1994!)--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the amount of money spent by Huckabee on the campaign gave cause to accusations of possible corruption. In subsequent investigations it was revealed that while Lieutenant Governor, Huckabee accepted $71,500 in speaking fees and traveling expenses from a [[nonprofit]] group, Action America. [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company|R. J. Reynolds]] was the group's largest contributor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Isikoff&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Bailey |first=Holly |coauthors=Michael Isikoff |title=A Pastor's True Calling: Huckabee's success is due, in part, to right-time, right-place luck.

In October 1995, [[David Pryor]] announced that he was retiring from the [[United States Senate]]. Huckabee then announced he was running for the open seat and moved well ahead in the polls.&lt;ref name = &quot;Barone 136–137&quot;/&gt; He won the Republican nomination unopposed.&lt;ref name=&quot;KevinSack&quot; /&gt;

During his campaign, Huckabee opposed in December then-Governor Tucker's plan for a constitutional convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Neal |first=Rachel |coauthors=Caldwell, Elizabeth |title=OBSERVERS SAY ARKANSANS: Arkansas voters didn't like the idea of allowing 26 appointed legislators to serve as delegates to a proposed constitutional convention. |publisher=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette |date=1995-12-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was defeated by voters, 80–20 percent, in a [[special election]]. In January 1996, Huckabee campaigned in televised ads paid for by the [[Republican National Committee]] and the [[Republican Party of Arkansas|Arkansas Republican Party]] against a highway referendum. Tucker supported the referendum, which included tax increases and a bond program, to improve {{convert|1300|mi|km}} of highway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oneal&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=O'Neal |first=Rachel |title=ROAD VOTE |publisher=Arkansas Democrat-Gazette |date=1996-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the referendum, the bond question, which included a sales tax increase and a gas tax increase, lost 87–13 percent. A second question, a five-cent increase on [[Diesel fuel|diesel]] tax, lost 86–14 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oneal&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CharacterBook&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Huckabee |first=Mike |title=Character Is The Issue |publisher=Broadman&amp;Holman |year=1997 |location=Nashville |pages=65–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huckabee also opposed Tucker's plan for school consolidation.&lt;ref name=&quot;CharacterBook&quot; /&gt;

In May 1996, Tucker, involved in the [[Whitewater scandal]], was convicted &quot;on one count of arranging nearly $3 million in fraudulent loans&quot; and he promised to resign by July 15.&lt;ref name = &quot;Barone 136–137&quot;/&gt; Huckabee then announced he would quit the Senate race and instead fill the unexpired term of Tucker.&lt;ref name=&quot;KevinSack&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9905EEDB1E39F932A05756C0A960958260 |title=Arkansan Quits Senate Race to Lead State |work=[[The New York Times]] |last=Sack |first=Kevin |date=1996-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governor of Arkansas==
{{Main|Governorship of Mike Huckabee}}
In 1996, incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] governor [[Jim Guy Tucker]] was convicted of fraud. The [[Arkansas Constitution]], like nearly all state constitutions in the United States, does not allow convicted felons to hold office, so Tucker was forced to resign. However, Tucker, insisting he had a strong case for appeal,&lt;ref name=&quot;Barone 44&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Almanac of American Politics |last=Barone |first=Michael |authorlink= |coauthors=Grant Ujifusa |year=1999 |publisher=National Journal |location=Washington, DC |isbn=0-8129-3194-7 |page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; rescinded his resignation as Huckabee was preparing to be sworn in on July 15. Within a few hours, Tucker reinstated his resignation after Huckabee threatened to initiate [[impeachment]] proceedings against Tucker.&lt;ref name=&quot;scottparks&quot;/&gt; Huckabee was sworn in as [[Governor of Arkansas]] on July 15, 1996. In November 1998, Huckabee was elected to a full four-year term by defeating retired Colonel Gene McVay in the primary and Jonesboro attorney Bill Bristow in the [[general election]], becoming the state's third elected Republican Governor since Reconstruction. In November 2002, Huckabee was reelected to his second four-year term by defeating State Treasurer [[Jimmie Lou Fisher]], garnering 53 percent of the vote. By the end of his term, Huckabee owned the third-longest tenure of any Arkansas Governor. Only Democrats [[Orval Faubus]], who served six consecutive two-year terms (1955–1967), and [[Bill Clinton]], who served 11 years, 11 months (1979–1981; 1983–1992), had longer tenures.

Huckabee said that his experience as a minister afforded him special insight in being governor:

&quot;My experience dealing every day with real people who were genuinely affected by policies created by government gave me a deep understanding of the fragility of the human spirit and vulnerability of so many families who struggled from week to week. I was in the ICU at 2 a.m. with families faced with the decision to disconnect a respirator on their loved one; I counseled fifteen-year-old pregnant girls who were afraid to tell their parents about their condition; I spent hours hearing the grief of women who had been physically and emotionally clobbered by an abusive husband; I saw the anguish in the faces of an elderly couple when their declining health forced them to sell their home, give up their independence, and move into a long-term-care facility; I listened to countless young couples pour out their souls as they struggled to get their marriages into survival mode when confronted with overextended debt . . . &quot;&lt;ref&gt;Huckabee, ''From Hope to Higher Ground'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 29, 2008, Huckabee finished in fourth place in the Florida primary, behind [[Rudy Giuliani]] in third, [[Mitt Romney]] in second, and [[John McCain]] in first place.

On February 5, 2008, Huckabee won the first contest of &quot;[[Super Tuesday]]&quot;, the [[West Virginia]] GOP state [[Political convention|convention]], but only after the McCain campaign provided their delegates thereby giving Huckabee 52% of the electorate to [[Mitt Romney]]'s 47%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/jonathanmartin/0208/Romney_loses_West_Virginia_.html |title=Romney Loses West Virginia! |publisher=Politico |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backers of rival [[John McCain]] said they threw Huckabee their support to prevent Mitt Romney from capturing the winner-take-all GOP state convention vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5iF8wKRfboqefXRDnYOmCOhaCdrSAD8UKC8OG1 Huckabee Wins W.Va.

This was also the first contest to be held without [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2008|Mitt Romney]], who was said to be splitting the conservative vote with Huckabee and some pundits suggested it was the reason for Huckabee's landslide victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=From Bill Schneider CNN |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/02/05/super.exit/?iref=mpstoryview |title=Romney, Huckabee splitting conservative vote |publisher=CNN |date=2008-02-06 |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huckabee also won the [[Louisiana Republican primary, 2008|Louisiana Republican Primary]] with 44% of the vote to John McCain's 43% in second. Although Huckabee won the primary he was not awarded any delegates, because of the state party rules that state a candidate must pass the 50% threshold to receive the state's pledged delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/primaries/results/state/#val=LA |title=Huckabee wins Louisiana |publisher=CNN |date= |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 4, 2008, Huckabee withdrew from seeking the candidacy as it became apparent he would lose in Texas, where he had hoped to win and that [[John McCain]] would get the 1191 delegates required to win the Republican nomination.

===After the presidential campaign===
Even though Huckabee had signed a television contract and a book deal with a pressing deadline, he was mentioned by most to be on then-presumptive Republican presidential nominee [[John McCain]]'s short list for his [[Vice President of the United States|Vice Presidential]] [[running mate]]. Huckabee was eventually passed over for [[Sarah Palin]]. The late pundit [[Tim Russert]] even referred to Huckabee as &quot;Vice President Huckabee&quot; several times when he appeared on ''[[Meet The Press]]'' on May 18, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/24693653/page/7/ |title=Russert: Vice President Huckabee |publisher=MSNBC |date=2008-05-18 |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huckabee hosts a weekend show, ''[[Huckabee]]'', on Fox News Channel, which premiered Saturday September 27, 2008, at 8 PM EST.

On April 2, 2012, Huckabee launched a long-form daily talk show on Cumulus Media Networks, who provide the call-in guests. The show, which is targeted at second-tier broadcast stations, features long-form interviews and discussions and  airs in the noon to 3 p.m. time slot, directly opposite the market leader in talk radio, ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stelter, Brian (February 10, 2012).

====Reports of staged caller on The Huckabee Show====

The very first caller to the ''The Huckabee Show'' was &quot;Mike from San Francisco&quot;, who was actually Mike McVay – Senior Vice President of Programming at Cumulus Media Networks; McVay's identity and affiliation with ''The Huckabee Show'' was not disclosed to listeners while McVay praised Huckabee's new radio show across national airwaves, this according to an April 10, 2012 article by [[Jeff_Lord|Jeffrey Lord]].&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Jeffrey. &quot;The American Spectator : Huckabee Show Opens With Staged Caller.&quot; The American Spectator. N.p., n.d. Web. 11 Apr. 2012. &lt;http://spectator.org/archives/2012/04/10/huckabee-show-opens-with-stage&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Mike McVay's call to The Huckabee Show was received just seconds after the phone number for The Huckabee Show was given to listeners for the first time. 

Before publishing his article in the ''American Spectator'', Jeffrey Lord e-mailed McVay asking  why he didn't identify himself as a Cumulus executive and if Mike Huckabee knew Mike was actually Mike from the network? Lord received no response from McVay. Lord then e-mailed executives Lew and John Dickey at Cumulus Media; Lord inquired about the wisdom of using a staged questioner and asked if Huckabee knew it was Mike McVay calling. John replied as follows:

''Jeff:''

''Thanks for listening to the show. To your question a colleague in the companywas excited about the new show and arranged to call in with the first questionwithout Governor Huckabee's knowledge. When I learned of this I began the process of reminding my colleagues in the company that we should reserve air-time for our listeners and refrain from calling in to our own shows.''

Cumulus Media Networks did not respond if Huckabee recognized the voice of McVay, also no response whose idea it was to stage the first caller on The Huckabee Show, also no response if this call from McVay compromises the honest reputation of Mike Huckabee.&lt;ref&gt;Lord, Jeffrey. &quot;The American Spectator : Huckabee Show Opens With Staged Caller.&quot; The American Spectator.

Clemmons had committed burglary without a weapon, and his 60-year sentence was commuted by Huckabee to 47 years, making him eligible for parole if approved by the parole board. The prosecuting attorney of Pulaski County, Arkansas vehemently objected to the commutation. As factors in his decision, Huckabee cited the unusually long sentence of 108 years for Clemmons, who was 17 at the time, that Clemmons had already served 11 years of jail time, the unanimous decision by the bipartisan state pardon board in Clemmons's favor, and the original trial judge's support for clemency. When Clemmons received the 60-year sentence, he already was serving 48 years on five felony convictions and facing up to 95 more years on charges of robbery, theft and possessing a handgun on school property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sterling |first=Amanda |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/12/01/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry5854298.shtml |title=Huckabee Calls Criticisms Over Clemency &quot;Disgusting&quot; – Political Hotsheet |publisher=CBS News |date=2009-12-01 |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ST1129&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=Suspect let out of Pierce County jail one week ago|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|location=[[Seattle, Washington]]|date=2009-11-29|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2010386501_clemmons30m.html|accessdate=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his release in 2000 Clemmons was arrested a number of times for multiple offenses including [[child molestation]] and [[aggravated assault]], but was released after prosecutors declined to file charges.

In 2003, Eugene Fields received a six year prison sentence after his fourth conviction of driving while intoxicated in five years. Gov. Huckabee granted clemency over the objections of the local prosecutor and sheriff, the Arkansas Prosecuting Attorneys Association and [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD)]]. A spokeswoman for Mr. Huckabee, Charmaine Yoest, said that Mr. Fields' political donations [to the Arkansas Republican Party] and connections played no role in his clemency. About two years after Mr. Fields' sentence was cut to 11 months, he was arrested again for driving while intoxicated as his truck crossed the center line directly into the path of an oncoming police car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=The Long Run: Charming and Aloof, Huckabee Changed State |work=[[The New York Times]] |location=[[Little Rock, AR]]|date=December 22, 2007 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/22/us/politics/22commute.html?_r=2&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1198343576-wqXZD02A72A4LL3ZAHATxw |accessdate=November 30, 2009 |first=David |last=Barstow}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In comments made March 4, 2011, on the ''[[Michael Medved Show]]'', Huckabee spoke about pregnant, unwed actress [[Natalie Portman]] saying &quot;...it's unfortunate we glorify and glamorize the idea of out of wedlock children.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=AOLnews.com |date=March 4, 2011 |title=Mike Huckabee Disses Natalie Portman; Over Out of Wedlock Pregnancy Why Not Bristol Palin? |first=Steven |last=Hoffer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huckabee denies he defamed Portman.

In April, he was criticized for a remark he made, &quot;I almost wish that there would be a simultaneous telecast and all Americans would be forced, at gunpoint, to listen to every David Barton message,&quot; in praise of [[David Barton (author)|David Barton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;barton&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestatecolumn.com/articles/mike-huckabee-americans-to-be-indoctrinated-at-gunpoint/|title=Mike Huckabee: Americans to be indoctrinated at gunpoint}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Possible 2012 presidential campaign====
{{See also|United States presidential election, 2012}}
In a November 19, 2008, article by the [[Associated Press]], Huckabee addressed the possibility of running for President in 2012. He said, &quot;I'm not ruling anything out for the future, but I'm not making any specific plans&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5gKBzuu0SKZM0-4wwpJ3xfxZmH4XwD94I7SE00 |title=Huckabee won't rule out 2012 run for President |last=Ohlemacher |first=Stephen |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=2008-12-05 |date=November 19, 2008}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amid speculation about a future run for the Presidency, a [[CNN]] poll in December 2008 found Huckabee at the top of the list of 2012 GOP contenders, along with former [[Alaska]]n [[List of Governors of Alaska|Governor]] [[Sarah Palin]], fellow 2008 Presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]], and former [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Newt Gingrich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/12/05/huckabee-and-palin-top-early-2012-list/ |title=Huckabee and Palin top early 2012 list |work=[[CNN|CNN.com]] |accessdate=2008-12-06 date=December 5, 2008 |date=December 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 3, 2008, local [[NBC]] news station WLWT asked Huckabee about the prospect of running, to which he said, &quot;I'm pretty sure I'll be out there. Whether it's for myself or somebody else I may decide will be a better standard bearer, that remains to be seen.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;WLWT website http://www.wlwt.com/politics/18192964/detail.html (retrieved on 2/4/2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

A June 2009 [[CNN]]/[[Opinion Research Corporation]] national poll showed Huckabee as the 2012 presidential co-favorite of the Republican electorate along with Palin and Romney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/06/02/cnn-poll-no-frontrunner-in-gop-2012-presidential-race/ | title=CNN Poll: No frontrunner in GOP 2012 presidential race | publisher=CNN | date=June 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An October 2009 poll of Republicans by [[Rasmussen Reports]] put Huckabee in the lead with 29%, followed by Romney on 24% and Palin on 18%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections2/election_2012/gop_2012_huckabee_29_romney_24_palin_18 |date=October 16, 2009 |accessdate=October 17, 2009 |work=Rasmussen Reports |title=GOP 2012: Huckabee 29% Romney 24% Palin 18%}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 2009 [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]] poll, Huckabee was shown as the leading Republican contender for 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gallup.com/poll/124097/huckabee-romney-palin-see-most-republican-support-12.aspx|title= Huckabee, Romney, Palin See Most Republican Support for '12|date= November 5, 2009|publisher= Gallup|accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010 [[CNN]] projected in a poll that Huckabee would defeat Barack Obama in a hypothetical 2012 contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2010/pollcenter/individual/index.html#1823 |title= Huckabee would defeat Obama in a hypothetical 2012 contest|date= November 7, 2010|publisher= CNN|accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a Rasmussen poll taken January 11–14, 2011, Huckabee was even with Obama: 43% – 43%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/elections/election_2012/romney_huckabee_even_with_obama_other_gop_hopefuls_trail |title= Romney, Huckabee Even With Obama, Other GOP Hopefuls Trail|date= February, 6 2011|publisher= Rasmussen Poll|accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 2011, Huckabee announced on his Fox News television show that he would not be a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012. Despite his high national poll numbers and being seen by many as the front runner, Huckabee declined to run, saying, &quot;All the factors say 'go', but my heart says 'no'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Cillizza |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Mike Huckabee won’t run for president in 2012 |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/mike-huckabee-wont-run-for-president-in-2012/2011/05/14/AFGcpk3G_blog.html |work= |publisher=Washington Post |date=2011-05-14 |accessdate=2011-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weight loss and health advocacy===
[[File:Paige, Huckabee, Rockefeller, and Hutchinson with large check, August 2002.jpg|thumb|left|Huckabee (second from left) in August 2002 before his weight loss.]]
When elected governor of Arkansas, Huckabee was [[obesity|obese]]. In 2003, physicians diagnosed him with [[type 2 diabetes]], and informed him that he would not live more than 10 years if he did not lose weight. Huckabee acknowledges that he has weighed as much as 300 pounds (135&amp;nbsp;kg). Prompted by this diagnosis (as well as the subsequent death of former Governor [[Frank D. White]], whose obesity contributed to a fatal [[myocardial infarction|heart attack]]), Huckabee began eating a healthier diet and exercising. He subsequently lost over 110 pounds (50&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7752179/site/newsweek/|title=MSNBC article|accessdate=2007-02-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061214093849/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7752179/site/newsweek/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/01/16/AR2006011601380.html|title=Washington Post article|accessdate=2007-02-10 | work=The Washington Post | first=Mark | last=Leibovich | date=January 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/bmi-calculator/NU00597|title=BMI Calculator from the Mayo Clinic|accessdate=2008-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Times]]'' called the weight loss so rapid that &quot;it was as if he simply unzipped a fat suit and stepped out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/10/us/10weight.html|title=New York Times article|accessdate=2007-02-10 | work=The New York Times | first=Shaila | last=Dewan | date=September 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Huckabee has stated that he never smoked nor drank,&lt;ref name=&quot;brianlamb&quot;/&gt; he declared himself a &quot;recovering foodaholic&quot;. Huckabee has publicly recounted his previous burdens as an obese man: the steps of the Arkansas capitol from the entrance of the building up to the Governor's office were so long and steep that he would be out of breath and exhausted by the time he reached the top of the stairs. He once joked that he would be interviewed by media at the top of the steps, and that he would be too out of breath to respond.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.state.ar.us/governor/media/radio/text/r07242004.html]{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Huckabee has discussed his weight loss and used [[health care]] reform as a major focus of his governorship.&lt;ref&gt;[[Brian Wansink]] and Mike Huckabee (2005), &quot;De-Marketing Obesity,&quot; ''California Management Review'', 47:4 (Summer), 6–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

At an August 2007 forum on cancer hosted by [[Lance Armstrong]], Huckabee said he would support a federal smoking ban, but has stated that he believes the issue is best addressed by state and local governments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/huckabee-about-face-on-smoking-2008-01-16.html|publisher=The Hill|date=January 16, 2008|author=Jeffrey Young|title=Huckabee about-face on smoking}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huckabee has completed several marathons: the 2005 [[Marine Corps Marathon]], the 2005 and 2006 [[Little Rock Marathon]] and the 2006 [[New York City Marathon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejournalnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061105/SPORTS01/611050390/1271/SPORTS|publisher=The Journal News|date=November 5, 2006|author=Jane McManus|title=At NYC Marathon, there's no telling who you may run into}}{{Dead link|date=October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The 2005 Little Rock Marathon featured an impromptu challenge between Huckabee and [[Iowa]] Governor [[Tom Vilsack]]. Huckabee completed the marathon in 4:38:31, defeating Vilsack by 50 minutes. He wrote a book chronicling his weight-loss experience, ''[[Quit Digging Your Grave with a Knife and Fork]]''. Huckabee was one of 10 recipients of a 2006 [[AARP]] Impact Award acknowledging his work as a &quot;health crusader.&quot; 

In 2009 Huckabee acknowledged that he had gained back a fourth of his weight due to a foot condition that prevented him from running.&lt;ref&gt;

===Organizations===
Huckabee was made the chair of the [[Southern Governors' Association]] in 1999 and served in capacity through 2000. He has chaired the Southern Growth Policies Board, the Southern Region Education Board, the Southern Technology Council, the Interstate Oil and Gas Compact Commission, and the [[Education Commission of the States]]. He is also a member of the [[Republican Governors Association]] and former chairman of the [[National Governors Association]]. Huckabee is presently the chairman of conservative [[Political action committee|PACs]] called the [[Vertical Politics Institute]] and [[Huck PAC]].
