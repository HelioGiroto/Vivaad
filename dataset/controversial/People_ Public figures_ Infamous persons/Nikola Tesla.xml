Laplante, Comprehensive Dictionary of Electrical Engineering 1999, page 635]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tesla started working in the [[telephony]] and electrical fields before immigrating to the [[United States]] in 1884 to work for [[Thomas Edison]]. He soon struck out on his own with financial backers, setting up laboratories/companies to develop a range of electrical devices. His patented AC [[induction motor]] and transformer were licensed by [[George Westinghouse]], who also hired Tesla as a consultant to help develop an [[alternating current]] system. Tesla is also known for his high-voltage, high-frequency power experiments in New York and Colorado Springs which included patented devices and theoretical work used in the invention of [[radio]] communication,&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=IyVFweSZu0cC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=tesla+patents+basis+radio&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xrdr5vvEu7&amp;sig=h00r4C13uesNsvE1EdwUtSQat90&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=tesla%20patents%20basis%20radio&amp;f=false George Constable, Bob Somerville, A Century of Innovation: Twenty Engineering Achievements That Transformed Our Lives, page 70]&lt;/ref&gt; for his X-ray experiments, and for his ill-fated attempt at intercontinental wireless transmission in his unfinished [[Wardenclyffe Tower]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Tower in Shoreham Long Island (1901–1917) meant to be the &quot;World Wireless&quot; Broadcasting system|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/teslatower.htm|publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of New York|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla's achievements and his abilities as a showman demonstrating his seemingly miraculous inventions made him world-famous.&lt;ref&gt;Tim O'Shei, Marconi and Tesla: Pioneers of Radio Communication, page 106&lt;/ref&gt; Although he made a great deal of money from his patents, he spent a lot on numerous experiments over the years. In the last few decades of his life, he ended up living in diminished circumstances as a recluse in Room 3327 of [[New Yorker Hotel]], occasionally making unusual statements to the press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=P0CSxB2aHMcC&amp;pg=PT38&amp;lpg=PT38&amp;dq=tesla+patents+money+poverty&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=UnHu4If2dQ&amp;sig=hymMycq77lmUz1ViA54CsRpEed8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g8NQUOXuMOjk0QHppoHwAw&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=tesla%20patents%20money%20poverty&amp;f=false Clifford A.

[[File:Nikola Tesla birth certificate.png|thumb|upright|Tesla's baptismal record, c. 28 June 1856.]]

Nikola Tesla was born on 10 July &lt;small&gt;([[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]] 28 June)&lt;/small&gt; 1856 to Serbian parents in the village of Smiljan, [[Austrian Empire]] (modern-day Croatia). His father, Milutin Tesla, was a priest of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neuronet.pitt.edu/~bogdan/tesla/bio.htm |title=Tesla, Nikola |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=neuronet.pitt.edu |accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla's mother, Đuka Tesla (''née'' Mandić), whose father was also a Serbian Orthodox priest,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; had a talent for making home craft tools and for memorizing many [[Serbian epic poetry|Serbian epic poems]], even though she had never learned how to read.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seifer 2001 7&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Seifer|2001|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla's progenitors were from Western [[Serbia]], near [[Montenegro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nikola was the fourth of five children, an older brother, Dane, who was killed in a horse-riding accident when Nikola was five, and three sisters, Milka, Angelina and Marica.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cheney|Uth|Glenn|1999| p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;teslauniverse1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1861-dane-tesla-dies|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some accounts claim that Tesla had caused the accident by frightening the horse.&lt;ref name=&quot;teslauniverse1&quot; /&gt;

In 1861, Nikola attended the Krajina &quot;Lower&quot; or &quot;Primary&quot; School in Smiljan, Austrian Empire, where he studied German, arithmetic, and religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1856-birth-of-tesla#goto-1861|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1862, the Tesla family moved to [[Gospić]], Austrian Empire, where Nikola's father worked as a pastor. Nikola completed Krajina &quot;Lower&quot; or &quot;Primary&quot; School, followed by the &quot;Lower Real Gymnasium&quot; or &quot;Normal School&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1862-tesla-moves-to-gospic|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1870, Tesla moved to [[Karlovac]], Croatia to attend school at [[Gymnasium Karlovac|Higher Real Gymnasium]], where he was profoundly influenced by a math teacher, Martin Sekulić.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1861-dane-tesla-dies#goto-1870|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla was able to perform integral calculus in his head, which prompted his teachers to believe that he was cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Life and Legacy&amp;nbsp;– Tesla's Early Years|url=http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_early.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished a four-year term in just three years, graduating in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, after he graduated from Higher Real Gymnasium, Tesla returned to his hometown, Smiljan, Croatia. Shortly after he arrived, Tesla contracted [[cholera]]; he was bedridden for nine months and was near death multiple times. Nikola's father, in a moment of despair, promised to send him to the best engineering school if he recovered from the illness&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1861-dane-tesla-dies#goto-1873|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tesla1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Tesla|first=Nikola|title=My Inventions The Autobiography of Nikola Tesla|url=http://www.lucidcafe.com/library/96jul/teslaautobio.html|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (his father had originally wanted him to enter the priesthood).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Glenn|first=edited by Jim|title=The complete patents of Nikola Tesla|year=1994|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble Books|location=New York|isbn=1566192668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874, Tesla evaded being drafted into the army in Smiljan&lt;ref name=autogenerated6&gt;{{Cite book|last=Seifer|first=Marc J.|title=Wizard : the life and times of Nikola Tesla : biography of a genius|year=1998|publisher=Carol Pub.|location=Secaucus, N.J.|isbn=0806519606|edition=Carol Pub. Group ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; by running away to [[Tomingaj]], near [[Gračac]]. In Tominga, he explored the mountains, dressed in hunter's garb. Tesla claimed that this contact with nature made him stronger, both physically and mentally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1861-dane-tesla-dies#goto-1874|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He read many books while in Tomingaj, and later claimed that [[Mark Twain|Mark Twain's]] works had helped him to miraculously recover from his earlier illness.&lt;ref name=&quot;tesla1&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Teslacirca1880(2).png|thumb|upright|left|Tesla wearing the [[Serbian national costume]], c.1880.]]

In 1875, Tesla enrolled at [[Graz University of Technology|Austrian Polytechnic]] in [[Graz]], [[Austria]] on a Military Border scholarship. During his first year Tesla never missed a lecture, earned the highest grades possible, passed nine exams&lt;ref name=&quot;tesla1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;teslauniverse2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1861-dane-tesla-dies#goto-1875|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (nearly twice as many required&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=O'Neill|first=John J.|title=Prodigal genius : the life of Nikola Tesla|year=1996|publisher=Brotherhood of Life|location=New Mexico|isbn=0914732331|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigal_Genius:_The_Life_of_Nikola_Tesla}}&lt;/ref&gt;), started a Serbian culture club,&lt;ref name=&quot;teslauniverse2&quot; /&gt; and even received a letter of commendation from the dean of the technical faculty to his father, which stated, &quot;Your son is a star of first rank.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=O'Neill|first=John J.|title=Prodigal genius : the life of Nikola Tesla|year=1996|publisher=Brotherhood of Life|location=New Mexico|isbn=0914732331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla claimed that he worked from 3 A.M. to 11 P.M., no Sundays or holidays excepted.&lt;ref name=&quot;tesla1&quot; /&gt; He was &quot;mortified when [his] father made light of [those] hard won honors.&quot; After his father's death in 1879,&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; Tesla found a package of letters from his professors to his father, warning that unless he were removed from the school, Tesla would be killed through overwork.&lt;ref name=&quot;tesla1&quot; /&gt; During his second year, Tesla came into conflict with Professor Poeschl over the Gramme dynamo when Tesla suggested that commutators weren't necessary. At the end of his second year, Tesla lost his scholarship and became addicted to gambling.&lt;ref name=&quot;tesla1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;teslauniverse2&quot; /&gt; During his third year, Tesla gambled away his allowance and his tuition money, later gambling back his initial losses and returning the balance to his family. Tesla claimed that he &quot;conquered [his] passion then and there&quot;, but he was known to play billiards in the U.S.. When exam time came, Tesla was unprepared and asked for an extension to study, but was denied. He never graduated from the university and did not receive grades for the last semester.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt;

In December 1878, Tesla left Graz and severed all relations with his family. He didn't want his parents to know that he had dropped out of school.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; His friends thought that he had drowned in the [[Mur River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Seifer|2001|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla went to [[Maribor]] (now in [[Slovenia]]), where he worked as a draftsman for 60 florins a month. He spent his spare time playing cards with local men on the streets.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; In March 1879, Milutin Tesla went to Maribor to beg his son to return home, but Nikola refused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1862-tesla-moves-to-gospic#goto-1878|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nikola suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] at around the same time.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;
{{double image|right|Tesla young.jpg|120|Putovnica Nikola Tesla 01082.JPG|120|Nikola Tesla c. 1879 at age 23, and his passport from 1883}}

On 24 March 1879, Tesla was returned to Gospić under police guard for not having a residence permit. On 17 April 1879, Milutin Tesla died at the age of 60 after contracting an unspecified illness. During that year, Nikola taught a large class of students in his old school, Higher Real Gymnasium, in Gospić.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1862-tesla-moves-to-gospic#goto-1879|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1880, two of Tesla's uncles put together enough money to help him leave Gospicc{{Clarify|date=August 2012}} for [[Prague]] where he was to study. Unfortunately, Tesla arrived too late to matriculate in [[Charles University in Prague|Charles-Ferdinand University]] because he arrived too tardy to enroll; he never studied Greek, a required subject; and he was illiterate in [[Czech (language)|Czech]], another required subject. Tesla did, however, attend lectures at the university, although, as an auditor, he did not receive grades for the courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1862-tesla-moves-to-gospic#goto-1880|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=16 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mrkich|first=D.|title=Nikola Tesla : the european years|year=2003|publisher=Commoner's Publishing|location=Ottawa|isbn=088970113X|edition=1st ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=NYHOTEL|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/nyhotel.htm|publisher=Tesla Society of NY|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, Tesla moved to [[Budapest]] to work under Ferenc Puskas at a [[Telegraphy|telegraph]] company, the Budapest Telephone Exchange. Upon arrival, Tesla realized that the company, then under construction, was not functional, so he worked as a draftsman in the Central Telegraph Office, instead. Within a few months, the Budapest Telephone Exchange became functional and Tesla was allocated the chief electrician position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1880-tesla-arrives-in-prague#goto-1881|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his employment, Tesla made many improvements to the Central Station equipment and claimed to have perfected a telephone [[repeater]] or [[amplifier]], which was never patented or publicly described.&lt;ref name=&quot;tesla1&quot; /&gt;

=== Working for Edison ===

In 1882, Tesla began working for the ''Continental Edison Company'' in France, designing and making improvements to electrical equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://topdocumentaryfilms.com/nikola-tesla-the-genius/|title=Nikola Tesla: The Genius Who Lit the World|publisher=Top Documentary Films}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In June 1884, Tesla relocated to [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_america.html |title=Coming to America |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]] |accessdate=14 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his trip across the Atlantic, his ticket, money, and some of his luggage were stolen, and he was nearly thrown overboard after a mutiny broke out on the ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1884-tesla-arrives-in-new-york|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived with only four cents in his pocket, a letter of recommendation, a few poems, and the remainder of his belongings.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

In the letter of recommendation from [[Charles Batchelor]], a former employer, to [[Thomas Edison]], it is claimed that Batchelor wrote, &quot;I know two great men and you are one of them; the other is this young man.&quot; (the exact contents of the letter is disputed in McNichol's book). Edison hired Tesla to work for his ''Edison Machine Works''. Tesla's work for Edison began with simple electrical engineering and quickly progressed to solving some of the company's most difficult problems. Tesla was even offered the task of completely redesigning the Edison Company's [[direct current]] [[electrical generator|generators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=American inventors, entrepreneurs &amp; business visionaries |last=Carey |first=Charles W. |year=1989 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=0-8160-4559-3 |page=337 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=XKiGgl36bkgC |accessdate=27 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1885, Tesla claimed that he could redesign Edison's inefficient motor and generators, making an improvement in both service and economy. According to Tesla, Edison remarked, &quot;''There's fifty thousand dollars in it for you—if you can do it''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheney 2001 54–57&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cheney|2001|pp=54–57}}&lt;/ref&gt;—this has been noted as an odd statement from an Edison whose company was stingy with pay and who did not have that sort of cash on hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Jonnes|2004|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; After months of work, Tesla fulfilled the task and inquired about payment. Edison, claiming that he was only joking, replied, &quot;Tesla, you don't understand our [[American humor]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Strange brains and genius: the secret lives of eccentric scientists and madmen |last=Pickover |first=Clifford A. |year=1999 |publisher=Harper Perennial |isbn=0-688-16894-9 |page=14 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=P0CSxB2aHMcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Strange+Brains+and+Genius:+The+Secret+Lives+of+Eccentric+Scientists+and+Madmen#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Edison offered a US$10 a week raise over Tesla's US$18 per week salary; Tesla refused the offer and immediately resigned.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheney 2001 54–57&quot; /&gt;

== Middle years (1886-1899) ==

In 1886, Tesla formed his own company, ''[[Tesla Electric Light &amp; Manufacturing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1886-the-winter-of-suffering#goto-1885|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company installed electrical [[Arc lamp|arc light]] based illumination systems designed by Tesla and also had designs for dynamo electric machine commutators, the first patents issued to Tesla in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2_58p3Z69bIC&amp;pg=PT109&amp;lpg=PT109&amp;dq=tesla+electric+light+%26+manufacturing&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6T_4H-oitX&amp;sig=ZLZGDwqqe2QbOLWTnWhEAiKR43w&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X4ozUPSVC-X30gGM1YDQAQ&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tesla%20electric%20light%20%26%20manufacturing&amp;f=false |title=Jill Jonnes, Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RMFpatent.PNG|thumb|left|upright|Drawing from {{US patent|381,968}}, illustrating principle of Tesla's alternating current motor]]
In 1885, Tesla proposed that the company should go on to develop his ideas for alternating current transmission systems and motors. The investors disagreed and eventually fired him, leaving him penniless; Tesla was forced to work as a ditch digger for US$2 per day. Tesla considered the winter of 1886/1887 as a time of &quot;terrible headaches and bitter tears&quot;. During this time, he questioned the value of his education.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1886-the-winter-of-suffering#goto-1886|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1887, Tesla started a company, the Tesla Electric Company, with the backing of New York attorney Charles F. Peck and Alfred S. Brown, the director of [[Western Union]]. They set up a laboratory for Tesla at 89 Liberty St. in Manhattan so he could work on his alternating current motor and other devices for power distribution, with an agreement that they share fifty-fifty with Tesla any profits generated from patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1887-szigeti-comes-to-america |title=Tesla Timeline, Year: 1887 |publisher=Teslauniverse.com |date= |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was here in 1887 that Tesla constructed a [[brush (electric)|brushless]] alternating current [[induction motor]], based on a [[rotating magnetic field]] principle he claimed to have conceived of in 1882.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=‪Networks of power‬: ‪electrification in Western society, 1880-1930‬‬|publisher=JHU Press|page=117|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=g07Q9M4agp4C&amp;pg=PA117&amp;dq=Galileo+Ferraris+and+rotating+magnetic+field&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=NMp0T_bXL6Gc2AXt7e3ODg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Galileo%20Ferraris%20and%20rotating%20magnetic%20field&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a US patent for the motor in May 1888.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Timeline of Nikola Tesla|url=http://www.teslasociety.org/timeline.html|publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of NY|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time many inventors were trying to develop workable AC motors&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=2_58p3Z69bIC&amp;pg=PT162&amp;lpg=PT162&amp;dq=tesla+%22motors+were+in+the+air%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=6T_6E2qmuT&amp;sig=8YDP2sdzVB13V-KtO0xxdm0_Ae4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lflNUMLUH6Tw0gHLlYCIDA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=tesla%20%22motors%20were%20in%20the%20air%22&amp;f=false |title=Jill Jonnes, Empires of Light: Edison, Tesla, Westinghouse, and the Race to Electrify the World, 2003 - 416 pages - Google eBook - Preview |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; because AC's advantages in long distance [[high voltage]] transmission were counterbalanced by the inability to operate motors on AC.

In 1888, the editor of ''Electrical World'' magazine, [[Thomas Commerford Martin]] (a friend and publicist), arranged for Tesla to demonstrate his alternating current system, including his induction motor, at the ''American Institute of Electrical Engineers'' (now [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers|IEEE]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8j5bJ5OkGpgC&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=Westinghouse+tesla++Electrical+Engineers&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5nHK8Hlhi1&amp;sig=7NmfQ2iGm7IznasuUyl8Ce58bNQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1-xNUNb6Aonw0gGWv4H4Cg&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=Westinghouse%20tesla%20%20Electrical%20Engineers&amp;f=false |title=Fritz E.

In July 1888 Brown and Peck negotiated a licensing deal with George Westinghouse for Tesla's polyphase induction motor and transformer designs for $60,000 in cash and stock and a royalty of $2.50 per AC horsepower produced by each motor. Westinghouse also hired Tesla for one year for the large fee of $2,000 a month to be a consultant at the Westinghouse Electric &amp; Manufacturing Company's [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] labs.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=WKuG-VIwID8C&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;dq=tesla+hired+by+westinghouse&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=KDI0aTz0EK&amp;sig=oct2jnPyWkQ3qvUR-JmstK9F0FI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jRwxUKK3LtS80QHjxoGYAg&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=tesla%20hired%20by%20westinghouse&amp;f=false |title=John W.

During that year, Tesla worked in Pittsburgh, helping to create an alternating current system to power the city's streetcars. He found the time there frustrating because of conflicts between him and the other Westinghouse engineers over how to best implement AC power. Between them they settled on a 60-cycle AC current system Tesla proposed (to match the working frequency of Tesla's motor), although they soon found that, since Tesla's induction motor could only run at a constant speed, it would not work for street cars. They ended up using a DC [[traction motor]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Harris |first=William |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/nikola-tesla2.htm |title=William Harris, How did Nikola Tesla change the way we use energy?, page 3 |publisher=Science.howstuffworks.com |date=14 July 2008 |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American citizenship ===

On 30 July 1891, at the age of 35, Tesla became a [[Naturalization|naturalized citizen]] of the United States. He told many of his companions that he valued the citizenship more than any scientific honors that he had acquired.&lt;ref name=&quot;teslauniverse3&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1891-tesla-granted-citizenship|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, Tesla established his South [[Fifth Avenue (Manhattan)|Fifth Avenue]] laboratory in New York. Later, he established his Houston Street laboratory in New York at 46 E. [[Houston Street]]. He lit electric lamps wirelessly at both of the New York locations, providing evidence for the potential of wireless power transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krumme |first1=Katherine |last2= |first2= |year=2000 |title=Mark Twain and Nikola Tesla: Thunder and Lightning |publisher=University of California, Berkeley |url=http://www.genevolution.net/documents/twain%20and%20tesla.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892, Nikola spent a few months in Europe visiting other scientists. He later went to visit his hometown,&lt;ref name=autogenerated10&gt;{{Cite book|last=Burgan|first=Michael|title=Nikola Tesla : physicist, inventor, electrical engineer|year=2009|publisher=Compass Point Books|location=Minneapolis, Minn.|isbn=0756540860}}&lt;/ref&gt; arriving from Paris hours before his mother's death.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1892-tesla-looses-his-mother|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stayed at her side until he was exhausted. Nikola was awakened from a dream, in which an angel bearing resemblance to his mother appeared. He wrote: &quot;I was wakened up by an indescribably sweet song of many voices.&quot; He believed that the dream was a sign that his mother had died; he later confirmed this.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; Her last words to him were: &quot;You've arrived, Nidžo, my pride.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt; At first, Tesla believed that the dream was a message from the supernatural; however, after a few months of research, he concluded that his dream was caused by a painting of angels that he had seen before going to bed and that the singing voices had been from a nearby church.&lt;ref name=autogenerated10 /&gt; 

After the death of his mother, Nikola became ill and spent two to three weeks recovering in Gospić and Tomingaj.&lt;ref name=autogenerated8 /&gt;

From 1892 to 1894, Tesla served as the vice president of the [[American Institute of Electrical Engineers]], the forerunner (along with the [[Institute of Radio Engineers]]) of the modern-day IEEE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla’s Connection to Columbia University *|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/columbia.pdf|publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of NY|accessdate=5 July 2012|author=Kenneth L. Corum and James F. Corum, Ph.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tesla investigated harvesting energy in space. He believed that it was merely a question of time until men would succeed in attaching their machinery to the very wheelwork of nature, stating: &quot;Ere many generations pass, our machinery will be driven by a power obtainable at any point of the universe.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated9 /&gt;

In 1893, Westinghouse won the bid to electrify the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in Chicago with alternating current. This [[Worlds Fair|World's Fair]] devoted a building to electrical exhibits.

As a result of the &quot;[[War of Currents]]&quot;, Edison and Westinghouse went nearly bankrupt. Edison had lost control of his company to J. P. Morgan and Morgan was refusing to loan more money to Westinghouse due to the financial strain of the Tesla AC patents&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Parke Hughes, Networks of power: electrification in Western society, 1880-1930 (1983), page 119&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hans Camenzind, Much Ado About Almost Nothing: Man's Encounter With the Electron, (2007), page 107&lt;/ref&gt; (at that point Westinghouse had paid out an estimated $200,000 in licenses and royalties to Tesla, Brown, and Peck&lt;ref&gt;Seifer, Marc J.

In 1897 Westinghouse explained his financial difficulties to Tesla in stark terms, saying that if things continue the way they were he would no longer be in control of Westinghouse Electric and Tesla would have to &quot;deal with the bankers&quot; to try to collect future royalties.

=== X-ray experimentation ===
[[File:Teslaxrayhand.jpeg|right|thumbnail|X-ray of Tesla's hand—one of the earliest x-ray photographs.]]

Starting in 1894, Tesla began investigating what he referred to as radiant energy of &quot;invisible&quot; kinds that he had noticed damaged film in his lab in previous experiments&lt;ref&gt;[http://radiographics.rsna.org/content/28/4/1189.full Maja Hrabak et al., &quot;Nikola Tesla and the Discovery of X-rays,&quot; in ''RadioGraphics'', vol. 28, July 2008, 1189-92].

His early experiments were with [[Crookes tube]]s, a [[cold cathode]] electrical discharge tube. Tesla may have been the first person in North America to accidentally capture an X-ray image&lt;ref&gt;According to an account by Edward R. Hewitt - Margaret Cheney, Tesla: Man Out of Time, page 134&lt;/ref&gt; when he tried to photograph Mark Twain illuminated by an earlier type of gas discharge tube [[Geissler tube]] in 1895. The only thing captured in the image was the metal locking screw on the camera lens. Soon after, much of Tesla's early research—hundreds of invention models, plans, notes, laboratory data, tools, photographs, valued at $50,000—was lost in the 5th Avenue laboratory fire of March 1895. Tesla is quoted by [[The New York Times]] as saying, &quot;I am in too much grief to talk. What can I say?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1895-tesla-looses-fifth-ave-lab-to-fire|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1896, after hearing of [[Wilhelm Röntgen]]'s discovery of X-ray and X-ray imaging ([[radiography]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=South |first=Nanette |url=http://anengineersaspect.blogspot.com/2011/07/nikola-tesla-radiography-experiments.html |title=Nikola Tesla - Radiography Experiments - Clips from the &quot;The Constitution, Atlanta, Georgia, page 9. Friday, March 13, 1896&quot; |publisher=Anengineersaspect.blogspot.com |date=23 July 2011 |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla proceeded to do his own experiments in X-ray imaging, developing a high energy single terminal [[vacuum tube]] of his own design that had no target electrode and that worked from the output of the Tesla Coil (the modern term for the phenomenon produced by this device is ''[[bremsstrahlung]]'' (or ''braking radiation''). In his research, Tesla devised several experimental setups to produce X-rays. Tesla held that, with his circuits, the &quot;instrument will [... enable one to] generate Roentgen rays of much greater power than obtainable with ordinary apparatus&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;N. Tesla, [http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1898-11-17.htm &quot;High Frequency Oscillators for Electro-Therapeutic and Other Purposes&quot;], in ''Proceedings of the American Electro-Therapeutic Association'', American Electro-Therapeutic Association. Page&amp;nbsp;25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla noted the hazards of working with his circuit and single-node X-ray-producing devices. In his many notes on the early investigation of this phenomenon, he attributed the skin damage to various causes. He believed early on that damage to the skin was not caused by the Roentgen rays, but by the [[ozone]] generated in contact with the skin, and to a lesser extent, by [[nitrous acid]]. Tesla incorrectly believed that X-rays were longitudinal waves, such as those produced in [[waves in plasma]]. These plasma waves can occur in [[force-free magnetic field]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Griffiths, David J. ''Introduction to Electrodynamics'', ISBN 0-13-805326-X and Jackson, John D.

On 11 July 1934, the New York Herald Tribune published an article on Tesla, in which he recalled an event that would occasionally take place while experimenting with his single-electrode vacuum tubes; a minute particle would break off the cathode, pass out of the tube, and physically strike him. “[[Tesla]] said he could feel a sharp stinging pain where it entered his body, and again at the place where it passed out.” In comparing these particles with the bits of metal projected by his “electric gun”, Tesla said, “The particles in the beam of force ... will travel much faster than such particles . .. and they will travel in concentrations.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated22&gt;{{Cite book|last=editor|first=Leland Anderson,|title=Nikola Tesla's teleforce &amp; telegeodynamics proposals|year=1998|publisher=Twenty First Century Books|location=Breckenridge, Colo.|isbn=0963601288}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===

Tesla's theories on the possibility of the transmission by radio waves go back as far lectures and demonstrations in 1893 in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Missouri, the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania, and the [[National Electric Light Association]].&lt;ref name=Orton&gt;{{Cite book|last=Orton|first=John|title=The Story of Semiconductors|year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|pages=53}}{{Subscription required|via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla's demonstrations and principles were written about widely through various media outlets.&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;{{cite book |title=Experiments with alternate currents of high potential and high frequency |last=Tesla |first=Nikola |year=1892 |isbn= |page=58 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kNhCQPbYIsgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many devices such as the Tesla Coil were used in the further developement of radio.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt; 

Tesla's radio wave experiments in 1896 were conducted in Gerlach Hotel (later renamed The Radio Wave building), where he resided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Beautiful New York City where Tesla spent 60 years of his life|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/beautifulnyc.htm|publisher=Tesla Society of NY|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1900, Tesla was granted patents for &quot;system of transmitting electrical energy&quot; and &quot;an electrical transmitter&quot;. When [[Guglielmo Marconi]] made his famous first ever transatlantic radio transmission in 1901, Tesla quipped that it was done with 17 Tesla patents. This was the beginning of years of patent battles over radio with Tesla's patents being upheld in 1903, followed by a reverse decision in favor of Marconi in 1904. In 1943, a [[Supreme Court of the United States]] decision restored the prior patents of Tesla, [[Oliver Lodge]], and [[John Stone Stone|John Stone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;LQsxMxEUC page 3&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=c92LQsxMxEUC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=British+Court+tesla+radio&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9enh3iv6Ri&amp;sig=_cZbUxJcBpahYAzA9esD9bb_Tj0&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=British%20Court%20tesla%20radio&amp;f=false Jean-Michel Redouté, Michiel Steyaert, EMC of Analog Integrated Circuits, page 3]&lt;/ref&gt; The court declared that their decision had no bearing on Marconi's claim as the first to achieve radio transmission, just that since Marconi's claim to certain patents were questionable, he could not claim infringement on those same patents&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=SdGaiV6iup0C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;lpg=PA3&amp;dq=supreme+court+1943+radio+marconi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rKt8D5C3xg&amp;sig=XuISBITcZzpFApoFE-IROq9qns0&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=supreme%20court%201943%20radio%20marconi&amp;f=false Robert Sobot, Wireless Communication Electronics:Introduction to RF Circuits and Design Techniques, page 4]&lt;/ref&gt; (there are claims the high court was trying to nullify a World War I claim against the U.S. government by the Marconi Company via simply restoring Tesla's prior patent).&lt;ref name=&quot;LQsxMxEUC page 3&quot;/&gt;

=== Other inventions ===

In 1898, Tesla devised an &quot;electric igniter&quot; or [[spark plug]] for [[Internal combustion engine|internal combustion]] gasoline engines. He was awarded {{US patent|609,250}}, &quot;Electrical Igniter for Gas Engines&quot;, for this [[ignition system|mechanical ignition system]].

Tesla invented an electro-mechanical oscillator—[[Tesla's oscillator]]—a steam-powered mechanical oscillator. At his Houston Street lab, while experimenting with mechanical oscillators, Tesla allegedly generated a resonance of several buildings, causing complaints to the police. As the speed grew, it is said that the machine oscillated at the resonance frequency of his own building and, belatedly realizing the danger, he was forced to use a sledge hammer to terminate the experiment, just as the police arrived.&lt;ref&gt;''Prodigal Genius'', John J. O'Neill, pp. 162–164&lt;/ref&gt; In February 1912, an article—“Nikola Tesla, Dreamer” by Allan L. Benson—was published in World Today, in which an artist's illustration appears showing the entire earth cracking in half with the caption, “Tesla claims that in a few weeks he could set the earth's crust into such a state of vibration that it would rise and fall hundreds of feet and practically destroy civilization. A continuation of this process would, he says, eventually split the earth in two.”&lt;ref name=autogenerated22 /&gt; 

On 13 May 1899, while on his way to Colorado Springs, Colorado, Tesla stopped by a meeting of the Commercial Club in Chicago, Illinois for his &quot;Teleautomatics&quot; address/demonstration.&lt;ref name=&quot;teslauniverse4&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1856-birth-of-tesla#goto-1899|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June 1899, Tesla performed his first experiments at his Colorado Springs lab; he recorded his initial spark length at five inches long, but very thick and noisy.&lt;ref name=&quot;teslauniverse4&quot;/&gt;

Tesla investigated [[atmospheric electricity]], observing lightning signals via his receivers. Reproductions of Tesla's receivers and coherer circuits show an unpredicted level of complexity: [[Distributed element model|distributed]] [[Q factor|high-''Q'']] [[Helix|helical]] [[cavity resonator|resonators]], [[radio frequency]] [[feedback]], crude [[heterodyne]] effects, and [[Regenerative circuit|regeneration techniques]].&lt;ref&gt;Corum, K. L., J. F. Corum, and A. H. Aidinejad, &quot;''Atmospheric Fields, Tesla's Receivers and Regenerative Detectors''&quot;. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla stated that he observed [[stationary wave]]s during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Corum, K. L., J. F. Corum, &quot;''Nikola Tesla, Lightning Observations, and Stationary Waves''&quot;. 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla's [[Colorado Springs Notes, 1899–1900|diary]] contains explanations of his experiments concerning the [[ionosphere]] and the ground's [[telluric current]]s via [[transverse wave]]s and longitudinal waves.&lt;ref&gt;Tesla, Nikola, &quot;The True Wireless&quot;. ''Electrical Experimenter'', May 1919. ([http://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art06.html also at pbs.org])&lt;/ref&gt; He researched ways to transmit energy wirelessly over long distances (via transverse waves, to a lesser extent, and, more readily, longitudinal waves). He transmitted [[Extremely low frequency|extremely low frequencies]] through the ground as well as between the earth's surface and the [[Kennelly–Heaviside layer]]. Tesla received {{US patent|645,576}} for wireless transceivers that developed standing waves by this method. In his experiments, he made mathematical calculations and computations based on his experiments and discovered that the [[resonant frequency]] of the earth was approximately 8 hertz (Hz)&lt;ref&gt;Valone, Thomas, &lt;u&gt;Harnessing the Wheelwork of Nature&lt;/u&gt;.

At his lab, Tesla proved that the earth was a conductor.

People walking along the street observed sparks jumping between their feet and the ground. Electricity sprang from a tap whenever someone turned them on. Lightbulbs within 100 feet of the lab glowed even when turned off. Horses in a livery stable bolted from their stalls after receiving shocks through their metal shoes. Butterflies were electrified, swirling in circles with blue halos of [[St. Elmo's fire]] around their wings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Childress|first=Nikola Tesla &amp; David H.|title=The fantastic inventions of Nikola Tesla|year=1993|publisher=Adventures Unlimited|location=Stelle, Ill.|isbn=0932813194}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

While experimenting, Tesla accidentally short-circuited the generator, causing a [[power outage]]. In August 1917, Tesla explained what had happened in The Electrical Experimenter: &quot;As an example of what has been done with several hundred kilowatts of high frequency energy liberated, it was found that the dynamos in a power house six miles away were repeatedly burned out, due to the powerful high frequency currents set up in them, and which caused heavy sparks to jump thru the windings and destroy the insulation!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=SECOR|first=H.

At his lab, Tesla observed unusual signals (which he interpreted as 1—2—3—4), which he later believed were [[Extraterrestrial life|extraterrestrial]] radio wave communications coming from [[Mars]]. He noticed repetitive signals from his receiver which were substantially different from the signals that he had noted from noise of storms and the earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=http://www.teslasociety.com/mars.pdf|title=Nikola Tesla and the Planetary Radio Signals|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/mars.pdf|accessdate=9 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, he later recalled that the signals appeared in groups of one, two, three, and four clicks together.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} Tesla was highly criticized upon revealing his finding.&lt;ref name=&quot;teslauniverse4&quot;/&gt; Tesla had mentioned that he thought his inventions could be used to talk with other planets.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} It is debatable what type of signals Tesla received or whether he picked up anything at all.

In 1899, [[John Jacob Astor IV]] invested $100,000 for Tesla to further develop and produce a new lighting system. Instead, Tesla used the money to fund his Colorado Springs experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1912-john-jacob-astor-dies|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January 1900, Tesla left [[Colorado Springs]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} His lab was torn down ca. 1905 and its contents were sold to satisfy a debt.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The Colorado experiments had prepared Tesla for the establishment of the trans-Atlantic wireless telecommunications facility known as Wardenclyffe near Shoreham, Long Island.&lt;ref name=&quot;seifer542&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Seifer|first=Marc|title=Wizard, the Life and Times of Nikola Tesla|year=1998|publisher=Citadel Press|isbn=0806519606|page=542|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wizard,_the_Life_and_Times_of_Nikola_Tesla}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Tesla was granted {{US patent|685,012}} for the means of increasing the intensity of electrical oscillations.

[[File:Tesla_Broadcast_Tower_1904.jpeg|thumb|right|Tesla's Wardenclyffe plant on Long Island in 1904. From this facility, Tesla hoped to demonstrate wireless transmission of electrical energy across the Atlantic.]]

In 1900, with US$150,000 (more than $3 million today; 51% from [[J. Pierpont Morgan]]), Tesla began planning the ''[[Wardenclyffe Tower]]'' facility.&lt;ref name=&quot;broad1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Broad|first=William J|title=A Battle to Preserve a Visionary’s Bold Failure|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/05/science/05tesla.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=18 July 2012|newspaper=NYTimes|date=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla later approached Morgan to ask for more funds to build a more powerful transmitter. When asked where all the money had gone, Tesla responded by saying that he was affected by the [[Panic of 1901]], which he (Morgan) had caused. Morgan was shocked by the reminder of his part in the stock market crash and by Tesla's breach of contract by asking for more funds. Tesla wrote another plea to Morgan, but it was also fruitless. Morgan still owed Tesla money on the original agreement, and Tesla had been facing foreclosure even before construction of the tower began.&lt;ref name=&quot;seifer2006&quot; /&gt;

In December 1901, Marconi successfully transmitted the letter S from England to [[Newfoundland and Labrador#colony|Newfoundland]], terminating Tesla's relationship with Morgan. Over the next 5 years, Tesla wrote over 50 letters to Morgan, pleading for and demanding additional funding to complete the construction of Wardenclyffe. Tesla continued his project for another nine months. The tower was raised to its full 187 feet.&lt;ref name=&quot;seifer2006&quot; /&gt; In July 1903, Tesla wrote to Morgan that in addition to wireless communication,
Wardenclyffe would be capable of wireless transmission of electric power.&lt;ref name=&quot;bold&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first= William J.|last= Broad|title=A Battle to Preserve a Visionary's Bold Failure |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/05/science/05tesla.html?hp |quote=He eventually sold Wardenclyffe to satisfy $20,000 (today about $400,000) in bills at the Waldorf}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 October 1904, Morgan finally replied through his secretary, stating, &quot;It will be impossible for [me/ Morgan] to do anything in the matter&quot;, after Tesla had written to Morgan when the financier was meeting with the Archbishop of Canterbury in an attempt to appeal to his Christian spirit.&lt;ref name=&quot;seifer2006&quot; /&gt;

In June 1902, Tesla's lab operations were moved to Wardenclyffe from Houston Street.&lt;ref name=&quot;bold&quot; /&gt;

On his 50th birthday in 1906, Tesla demonstrated his 200&amp;nbsp;[[horsepower|hp]] (150&amp;nbsp;kW) 16,000&amp;nbsp;rpm [[Tesla turbine|bladeless turbine]]. During 1910–1911 at the ''Waterside Power Station'' in New York, several of his bladeless turbine engines were tested at 100–5,000&amp;nbsp;hp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Timeline|url=http://www.teslasociety.org/timeline.html|publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of NY|accessdate=3 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Wardenclyffe, Tesla built the [[Telefunken]] Wireless Station in Sayville, Long Island. Some of what he wanted to achieve at Wardenclyffe was accomplished with the Telefunken Wireless.&lt;ref name=&quot;Page, R.M. 1962&quot;&gt;Page, R.M., &quot;''The Early History of RADAR''&quot;, [[Proceedings of the IRE]], Volume 50, Number 5, May 1962, (special 50th Anniversary Issue).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1917 the tower was seized and blown up with [[dynamite]] for scrap by the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], owing to fears that German spies were using it and that it could be used as a landmark for German [[submarine]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Page, R.M. 1962&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;demol&quot;&gt;See [http://earlyradiohistory.us/1917tes.htm U.S. Blows Up Tesla Radio Tower (1917)] (citing page 293 of the September 1917 issue of ''[[The Electrical Experimenter]]''): &quot;SUSPECTING that German spies were using the big wireless tower erected at Shoreham, L.

Before World War I (1914–1918), Tesla looked overseas for investors to fund his research. When the war started, Tesla lost the funding he was receiving from his patents in European countries.

During this time, Tesla was staying at [[The Waldorf-Astoria Hotel|Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]],&lt;ref name=&quot;broad1&quot; /&gt; renting in an arrangement for deferred payments.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Eventually, the Wardenclyffe deed was turned over to [[George Boldt]], proprietor of the Waldorf-Astoria, to pay a US$20,000 debt (about $400,000 today).&lt;ref name=&quot;bold&quot; /&gt; In 1917, around the time that the Wardenclyffe Tower was demolished by Boldt to make the land a more viable real estate asset, Tesla received AIEE's highest honor, the [[Edison Medal]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

In August 1917, Tesla first established the principles of frequency and power level for the first primitive [[radar]] units.&lt;ref name=&quot;Page, R.M. 1962&quot; /&gt;

== Nobel Prize rumors ==

On 6 November 1915, a [[Reuters|Reuters news agency]] report from London had the 1915 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] awarded to Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla; however, on 15 November, a Reuters story from Stockholm stated the prize that year was being awarded to Sir William Henry Bragg and William Lawrence Bragg &quot;for their services in the analysis of crystal structure by means of X-rays&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Nobel Prize in Physics 1915|url=http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1915/|publisher=nobelprize.org|accessdate=29 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google245&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8b-Dp_2KmJoC&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=Tesla+had+declined+to+accept+the+Nobel+Prize&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yZsVUOjSIqaQ0QHu_oHQCg&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Tesla%20had%20declined%20to%20accept%20the%20Nobel%20Prize&amp;f=false |title=Margaret Cheney, Tesla: Man Out of Time, page 245 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Cheney, Robert Uth, Jim Glenn, Tesla, master of lightning, page 120&lt;/ref&gt; There were unsubstantiated rumors at the time that Tesla and/or Edison had refused the prize.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Cheney, Tesla: Man Out of Time, page 245&lt;/ref&gt; The Nobel Foundation declined to comment on the rumors other than saying, &quot;Any rumor that a person has not been given a Nobel Prize because he has made known his intention to refuse the reward is ridiculous&quot;, a recipient could only decline a Nobel Prize after he is announced a winner.&lt;ref name=&quot;google245&quot; /&gt; 

There have been subsequent claims by Tesla biographers that Edison and Tesla were the original recipients and that neither were given the award because of their animosity toward each other; that each sought to minimize the other's achievements and right to win the award; that both refused ever to accept the award if the other received it first; that both rejected any possibility of sharing it; and even that a wealthy Edison refused it to keep Tesla from getting the $20,000 prize money.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seifer 2001 7&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google245&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nikola Tesla Research |last=Research |first=Health |publisher=|isbn=0-7873-0404-2 |page=9 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=N0gD7HxMfsUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=28 November 2010 |date=1996-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the years after these rumors, neither Tesla nor Edison won the prize (although Edison did receive one of 38 possible bids in 1915 and Tesla did receive one bid out of 38 possible bids in 1937).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Seifer|2001|pp=378–380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, Tesla received his last patent, {{US patent|1,655,114}}, for a [[biplane]] capable of taking off vertically ([[vertical take-off and landing|VTOL]] aircraft) and then be &quot;''gradually tilted through manipulation of the elevator devices''&quot; in flight until it was flying like a conventional plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Tesla|first=Nikola|title=TESLA PATENT 1,655,114 APPARATUS FOR AERIAL TRANSPORTATION.|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-patents-1,655,114-aerial-transportation|publisher=UNITED STATES PATENT OFFICE.|accessdate=20 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla stated it would weigh 800 pounds and would sell at $1,000 for both military and consumer uses.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Although the aircraft was probably impractical, it may be the earliest known design for what became the [[tiltrotor]]/tilt-wing concept as well as the earliest proposal for the use of turbine engines in rotor aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.airspacemag.com/history-of-flight/OldandOdd-AS06.html |title=A.J.S.

In 1934, Tesla moved to the Hotel New Yorker after he had reached a settlement with the Westinghouse Corporation, in which Tesla was granted a consulting rate of US$125 per month along paid monthly renting expenses. Tesla never satisfied the debt owed to Hotel Governor Clinton.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Timeline|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-timeline-1934-tesla-moves-to-hotel-new-yorker|publisher=Tesla Universe|accessdate=17 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1934, Tesla wrote to Consul Janković of his homeland.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} The letter contained a message of gratitude to [[Mihajlo Pupin]] who had initiated a donation scheme by which American companies could support Tesla.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} Tesla refused the assistance, choosing instead to live on a modest pension received from Yugoslavia, and to continue his research.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In 1935, in an annual birthday celebration interview, Tesla announced a method of transmitting mechanical energy with minimal loss over any terrestrial distance, a related new means of communication, and a method of accurately determining the location of underground mineral deposits.&lt;ref name=autogenerated22 /&gt; 

In 1936, Tesla replied to a birthday telegram from [[Vladko Maček]], saying that he was &quot;equally proud&quot; of his &quot;Serbian origin and Croatian homeland&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;slobodna-2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.slobodnadalmacija.hr/Spektar/tabid/94/articleType/ArticleView/articleId/129763/Default.aspx | language = Croatian | title = Kako je Hrvatska naglo ‘otkrila’ velikog izumitelja iz Smiljana | trans_title = How Croatia suddenly 'discovered' a great inventor from Smiljan | date = 19 February 2011 | accessdate =8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a phrase often paraphrased in conciliatory context at modern-day joint Croatian-Serbian Tesla celebrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.predsjednik.hr/Default.aspx?art=12900&amp;sec=810 | language = Croatian | title = 150. obljetnica rođenja Nikole Tesle | trans_title = 150th anniversary of the birth of Nikola Tesla | agency = [[HINA]] | publisher = [[Office of the President of Croatia]] | date = 10 July 2006 | accessdate =8 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in the same telegram, Tesla wrote &quot;Long live all Yugoslavs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tesla Village&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Village|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/teslavillage.htm|publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of New York|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; When others tried to co-opt him into ethnic and other conflicts in Yugoslavia, Tesla replied: &quot;If your hate could be turned into electricity, it would light up the whole world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;slobodna-2011&quot; /&gt;

In the fall of 1937, after midnight one night, Tesla left the Hotel New Yorker to make his regular commute to the cathedral and the library to feed the pigeons. While crossing a street a couple of blocks from the hotel, Tesla was unable to dodge a moving taxicab and was thrown heavily to the ground. Tesla's back was severely wrenched and three of his ribs were broken in the accident (the full extent of his injuries will never be known; Tesla refused to consult a doctor—an almost lifelong custom). Tesla didn't raise any question as to who was at fault and refused medical aid, only asking be taken to his hotel via cab. Tesla was bedridden for some months and was unable to continue feeding pigeons from his window; soon, they failed to come. In the spring of 1938, Tesla was able to get up. He at once resumed the pigeons—feeding walks on a much more limited scale, but frequently had a messenger act for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=O'Neill|first=John J.|title=Prodigal genius : the life of Nikola Tesla|year=2006|publisher=Cosimo|location=New York|isbn=1596057130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Directed-energy weapon ===

{{Main|Teleforce}}

Later in life, Tesla made claims concerning a &quot;[[teleforce]]&quot; weapon after studying the [[Van de Graaff generator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Tesla's Ray |work=Time |date= 23 July 1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;seifer1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Seifer|first=Marc|title=Tesla's &quot;Death Ray&quot; Machine|url=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/tesla/esp_tesla_2.htm|publisher=bibliotecapleyades.net|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press called it a &quot;peace ray&quot; or [[death ray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Tesla, at 78, Bares New 'Death-Beam' |work=New York Times |date= 11 July 1934 |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0817FD3E5B107A93C3A8178CD85F408385F9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Tesla Invents Peace Ray |work=New York Sun |date= 10 July 1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla described the weapon as being able to be used against ground based infantry or for antiaircraft purposes.

Tesla gives the following description concerning the [[Charged particle beam|particle gun]]'s operation: {{cquote|[The nozzle would] send concentrated beams of particles through the free air, of such tremendous energy that they will bring down a fleet of 10,000 enemy airplanes at a distance of 200 miles from a defending nation's border and will cause armies to drop dead in their tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Beam to Kill Army at 200 Miles, Tesla's Claim on 78th Birthday |work=New York Times |date= 11 July 1934 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= 'Death Ray' for Planes |work=New York Times |date= 22 September 1940 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In total, the components and methods included:

* An apparatus for producing manifestations of energy in free air instead of in a [[Vacuum|high vacuum]] as in the past.
* A mechanism for generating tremendous electrical force.
* A means of intensifying and amplifying the force developed by the second mechanism.
* A new method for producing a tremendous electrical repelling force. This would be the projector, or gun, of the invention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Death-Ray Machine Described | work=New York Sun |date= 11 July 1934 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Machine to End War&quot;. Feb. 1935.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla claimed to have worked on plans for a [[directed-energy weapon]] from the early 1900s until his death.&lt;!-- Following refs cover 1920-1934 --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://patimg2.uspto.gov/.piw?Docid=01329559&amp;homeurl=http%3A%2F%2Fpatft.uspto.gov%2Fnetacgi%2Fnph-Parser%3FSect1%3DPTO1%2526Sect2%3DHITOFF%2526d%3DPALL%2526p%3D1%2526u%3D%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsrchnum.htm%2526r%3D1%2526f%3DG%2526l%3D50%2526s1%3D1329559.PN.%2526OS%3DPN%2F1329559%2526RS%3DPN%2F1329559&amp;PageNum=&amp;Rtype=&amp;SectionNum=&amp;idkey=NONE&amp;Input=View+first+page &quot;United States Patent Office Nikola Tesla,of New York, N.Y.

In 1937, at a luncheon in his honor concerning the death ray, Tesla stated, &quot;But it is not an experiment... I have built, demonstrated and used it. Only a little time will pass before I can give it to the world.&quot; His records indicate that the device is based on a narrow stream of small [[tungsten]] pellets that are accelerated via high voltage (by means akin to his [[Magnifying transmitter|magnifying transformer]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;seifer1&quot;/&gt;

During the same year, Tesla wrote a treatise, &quot;''The Art of Projecting Concentrated Non-dispersive Energy through the Natural Media''&quot;, concerning [[charged particle beam]] weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seifer454&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Seifer|2001|p=454}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla published the document in an attempt to expound on the technical description of a &quot;[[superweapon]] that would put an end to all war.&quot; This treatise is currently in the [[Nikola Tesla Museum]] archive in [[Belgrade]]. It describes an open-ended vacuum tube with a gas jet seal that allows particles to exit, a method of charging particles to millions of volts, and a method of creating and directing non-dispersive particle streams (through [[electrostatic]] repulsion).&lt;ref name=&quot;Seifer454&quot; /&gt; Tesla tried to interest the [[United States Department of Defense|US War Department]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Aerial Defense 'Death-Beam' Offered to U.S. By Tesla&quot; 12 July 1940&lt;/ref&gt;, the United Kingdom, the Soviet Union, and Yugoslavia in the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Seifer|first=Marc J.|title=Tesla's &quot;death ray&quot; machine|url=http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/tesla/esp_tesla_2.htm|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

During the period in which the negotiations were being carried on, Tesla claimed that efforts had been made to steal the invention. His room had been entered and his papers had been scrutinized, but the thieves, or spies, left empty-handed. He said that there was no danger that his invention could be stolen for he had at no time committed any part of it to paper. The blueprint for the teleforce weapon was all in his mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last1= O'Neill |first1= John J. |url=http://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art12.html |title=Tesla Tries To Prevent World War II (unpublished Chapter 34 of Prodigal Genius) |work=PBS }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 January, Tesla, 86, died alone in Room 3327 of the [[New Yorker Hotel]]. His corpse was later found by maid Alice Monaghan after she had entered Tesla's room, ignoring the &quot;do not disturb&quot; sign that Tesla had had placed on his door two days prior to his death. Assistant medical examiner, H. W.

A few days after Tesla's death, the information center of the Yugoslav royal government-in-exile released a statement, giving a short review of Tesla's achievements and the schedule for his memorial service and funeral.{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}} 

On 10 January 1943, New York City mayor, [[Fiorello La Guardia]] read a eulogy written by Croatian author, [[Louis Adamić]], live over the WNYC radio. Violin pieces, &quot;Ave Maria&quot; and &quot;Tamo Daleko&quot;, were played in the background.&lt;ref name=autogenerated21 /&gt; 

On 12 January, Tesla was given a state funeral at the [[Cathedral of Saint John the Divine]], the largest Gothic cathedral in the world, in New York City. 2,000 people attended. The funeral service was opened by Episcopal Bishop William T. Manning and concluded by the venerable Reverend Dushan J. Shukletovich, rector of the Serbian Orthodox Church of St. Sava. After the funeral, Tesla's corpse was taken to the [[Ferncliff Cemetery]] in Ardsley, New York, where it was later cremated.&lt;ref name=autogenerated21 /&gt;

Tesla worked every day from 9 A.M. until 6 P.M. or later, with dinner from exactly 8 to 10 pm, at [[Delmonico's]] restaurant and later the [[Waldorf-Astoria Hotel]]. Tesla would telephone his dinner order to the headwaiter, who also could be the only one to serve him. &quot;The meal was required to be ready at eight o'clock... He dined alone, except on the rare occasions when he would give a dinner to a group to meet his social obligations. Tesla would then resume his work, often until 3 am.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|2007|pp=283, 286}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For exercise, Tesla walked 8 to 10 miles per day. He squished his toes one hundred times for each foot every night, claiming that it stimulated his brain cells.&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;{{Cite book|last=Seifer|first=Marc J.|title=Wizard : the life and times of Nikola Tesla : biography of a genius|year=1998|publisher=Carol Pub.|location=Secaucus, N.J.|isbn=0806519606|page=413|edition=Carol Pub. Group ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In an interview with [[Arthur Brisbane]], a newspaper editor for The World, Tesla said that he did not believe in telepathy, stating, &quot;Suppose I made up my mind to murder you,&quot; he said, &quot;In a second you would know it. Now, isn't that wonderful? By what process does the mind get at all this?&quot; In the same interview, Tesla said that he believed that all fundamental laws could be reduced to one.&lt;ref name=&quot;brisbane1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Brisbane|first=Arthur|title=OUR FOREMOST ELECTRICIAN.|accessdate=5 September 2012|newspaper=The World|date=22 July 1894.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Tesla opposed war and believed that war could not be avoided until its cause was removed, he concluded that some wars might be justifiable.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2012}}

Near the end of his life, Tesla showed signs of encroaching senility, walking to the park every day to feed the pigeons and even bringing injured ones into his hotel room to nurse back to health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=About Nikola Tesla|url=http://www.teslasociety.org/about.html|publisher=Tesla Memorial Society of NY|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Life and Legacy&amp;nbsp;– Poet and Visionary|url=http://www.pbs.org/tesla/ll/ll_poevis.html|publisher=PBS|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that he had been visited by a specific injured white pigeon daily. Tesla spent over US$2,000, including building a device that comfortably supported her so her bones could heal, to fix her broken wing and leg.&lt;ref name=autogenerated6 /&gt; Tesla stated, &quot;I have been feeding pigeons, thousands of them for years. But there was one, a beautiful bird, pure white with light grey tips on its wings; that one was different. It was a female. I had only to wish and call her and she would come flying to me. I loved that pigeon as a man loves a woman, and she loved me. As long as I had her, there was a purpose to my life.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tesla Quotes|url=http://www.teslauniverse.com/nikola-tesla-quote-13|publisher=Tesla universe|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=About Nikola Tesla|url=About Nikola Tesla|publisher=Tesla Society of USA and Canada|accessdate=5 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla became a vegetarian in his later years, living on only milk, bread, honey, and vegetable juices.&lt;ref name=&quot;seifer1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=GITELMAN|first=LISA|title=Reconciling the Visionary with the Inventor Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/business/11619/|publisher=technology review (MIT)|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his final years, Tesla suffered from extreme sensitivity to light, sound and other influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From Edison to Enron: The Business of Power and What It Means for the Future of Electricity |last=Munson |first=Richard |year=2008 |publisher=Praeger |isbn=0-275-98740-X |page=37 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=MNCea_BbzQcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=24 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Appearance ===
[[File:Blue Portrait of Nikola Tesla.jpg|thumbnail|right|Tesla's portrait—Blue Portrait—from 1916, painted by then-Hungarian princess, [[Vilma Lwoff-Parlaghy]].]]
[[File:N.Tesla.JPG|thumbnail|right|Tesla, aged 40. c. 1896]]

Tesla was {{height|precision=2|ft=6|in=2}} tall and weighed {{convert|142|lb|kg}}, with almost no weight variance from 1888 to about 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;oneill292&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an elegant, stylish figure in New York City, meticulous in his grooming, clothing, and regimented in his daily activities. &quot;This was not because of personal vanity. Neatness and fastidiousness in clothes were entirely in harmony with every other phase of his personality. He did not maintain a large wardrobe and he wore no jewelry of any kind... He observed, however, that in the matter of clothes the world takes a man at his own valuation, as expressed in his appearance, and frequently eases his way to his objective through small courtesies not extended to less prepossessing individuals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many of Tesla's progenitors were dark-eyed, his eyes were a gray-blue. He claimed that his eyes were originally darker, but as a result of the exorbitant use of his brain, their hue changed. However, his mother and some of his cousins possessed gray eyes, so it can be inferred that the gray of his eyes was inherited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=O'Neill|first=John Joseph|title=Prodigal Genius: The Life of Nikola Tesla|year=1944|publisher=Ives Washburn|isbn=0914732331|page=327|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigal_Genius:_The_Life_of_Nikola_Tesla}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Brisbane]], a newspaper editor for The World, described Tesla's appearance: {{cquote|Nikola Tesla is almost the tallest, almost the thinnest and certainly the most serious man who goes to Delmonico's regularly.... He has eyes set very far back in his head. They are rather light. I asked him how he could have such light eyes and be a Slav. He told me that his eyes were once much darker, but that using his mind a great deal had made them many shades lighter. I have often heard it said that using the brain makes the eyes lighter in color. Tesla's confirmation of the theory through his personal experience is important.

He is very thin, is more than six feet tall and weighs less than a hundred and forty pounds. He has very big hands. Many able men do—Lincoln is one instance. His thumbs are remarkably big, even for such big hands. They are extraordinarily big. This is a good sign. The thumb is the intellectual part of the hand. The apes have very small thumbs. Study them and you will notice this.

Nikola Tesla has a head that spreads out at the top like a fan. His head is shaped like a wedge. His chin is as pointed as an ice-pick. His mouth is too small. His chin, though not weak, is not strong enough. His face cannot be studied and judged like the faces of other men, for he is not a worker in practical fields. He lives his life up in the top of his head, where ideas are born, and up there he has plenty of room. His hair is jet black and curly. He stoops—most men do when they have no peacock blood in them. He lives inside of himself. He takes a profound interest in his own work. He has that supply of self-love and self-confidence which usually goes with success. And he differs from most of the men who are written and talked about in the fact that he has something to tell.&lt;ref name=&quot;brisbane1&quot;/&gt;}}

=== Eidetic Memory ===
Tesla read many works, memorizing complete books, and supposedly possessing a [[photographic memory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cheney-79&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cheney|2001|p=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a [[Polyglot (person)|polyglot]], speaking eight languages: Serbo-Croatian, Czech, English, French, German, Hungarian, Italian, and Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=282}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla related in his autobiography that he experienced detailed moments of inspiration. During his early life, Tesla was stricken with illness time and time again. He suffered a peculiar affliction in which blinding flashes of light would appear before his eyes, often accompanied by visions. Often, the visions were linked to a word or idea he might have come across; at other times they would provide the solution to a particular problem he had encountered. Just by hearing the name of an item, he would be able to envision it in realistic detail. Modern-day [[synesthesia|synesthetes]] report similar symptoms. Tesla would visualize an invention in his mind with extreme precision, including all dimensions, before moving to the construction stage; a technique sometimes known as [[picture thinking]]. He typically did not make drawings by hand but worked from memory. Beginning in his childhood, Tesla had frequent flashbacks to events that had happened previously in his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;cheney-79&quot; /&gt;

=== Sleep habits ===

Tesla claimed to never sleep more than two hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Tesla did admit to &quot;dozing&quot; from time to time &quot;to recharge his batteries.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt; 

During his second year of study at Graz, Tesla developed a passion for (and became very proficient at) billiards, chess and card-playing, sometimes spending more than 48 hours in a stretch at a gaming table.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=301}}&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion at his laboratory, Tesla worked for a period of 84 hours without sleep or rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Neill|2007|p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth Swezey, a journalist whom Tesla had befriended, confirmed that Tesla rarely slept. Swezey recalled one morning when Tesla called him at 3 A.M.: &quot;I was sleeping in my room like one dead.... Suddenly, the telephone ring awakened me.... [Tesla] spoke animatedly, with pauses, [as he]...work[ed] out a problem, comparing one theory to another, commenting; and when he felt he had arrived at the solution, he suddenly closed the telephone.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated11 /&gt;

=== OCD ===
Tesla probably suffered from [[obsessive-compulsive disorder]] (OCD) in his later years. He developed a hatred of jewelry and round objects, could not bear to touch hair, did not like to shake hands, and became obsessed with the number three—he often felt compelled to walk around a block three times before entering a building, and demanded 18 napkins (a number divisible by three) to polish his silver and glasses and plates until they were impeccable, whenever he went dining. If he read one of an author's books, he had to read all of his books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mast |first1=Amy |last2= |first2= |title=America's forgotten innovator, Nikola Tesla |publisher=Florida State University |pages=14–15 |url=http://www.magnet.fsu.edu/mediacenter/publications/flux/vol1issue1/documents/magnetmilestones.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nature of OCD was little understood at the time and no treatments were available, so his symptoms were considered by some to be evidence of partial insanity, undoubtedly damaging what was left of his reputation.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

=== Relationships ===
[[File:TeslaUnknownWoman.png|thumb|right|Tesla with an unknown woman]]

Tesla was [[celibacy|celibate]] and never married, claiming that his chastity was very helpful to his scientific abilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;cheney-79&quot; /&gt; However, towards the end of his life, he told a reporter, &quot;Sometimes I feel that by not marrying, I made too great a sacrifice to my work....&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Seifer|first=Marc J.|title=Wizard: the life and times of Nikola Tesla: biography of a genius|year=1998|publisher=Carol Pub.|location=Secaucus, N.J.|isbn=0806519606|edition=Carol Pub.

Tesla was prone to secluding himself.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} However, when he did engage in a social life, many people spoke very positively and admiringly of Tesla. Robert Underwood Johnson described him as attaining a &quot;distinguished sweetness, sincerity, modesty, refinement, generosity, and force.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Seifer|first=Marc J.|title=Wizard the life and times of Nikola Tesla : biography of a genius|year=1998|publisher=Citadel Press/Kensington Publishing Corp.|location=Secaucus, N.J.|isbn=0806535563}}&lt;/ref&gt; His loyal secretary, Dorothy Skerrit, wrote: &quot;his genial smile and nobility of bearing always denoted the gentlemanly characteristics that were so ingrained in his soul.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=O'Neill|first=John J.|title=Prodigal genius : the life of Nikola Tesla|year=2007|publisher=Cosimo Classics|location=New York|isbn=1602067430}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla's friend, [[Julian Hawthorne]], wrote, &quot;seldom did one meet a scientist or engineer who was also a poet, a philosopher, an appreciator of fine music, a linguist, and a connoisseur of food and drink.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[File:Twain in Tesla's Lab.jpg|thumb|[[Mark Twain]] in Tesla's lab, early 1894]]

Tesla could be harsh at times, openly expressing disgust for overweight people, such as when he fired a secretary because of her weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Cheney|2001|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was quick to criticize clothing. On several occasions, Tesla directed a subordinate to go home and change her dress.&lt;ref name=&quot;cheney-79&quot; /&gt; When [[Thomas Edison]] died in 1931, Tesla contributed the only negative opinion to the ''[[New York Times]]'', buried in an extensive coverage of Edison's life:

{{cquote|He had no hobby, cared for no sort of amusement of any kind and lived in utter disregard of the most elementary rules of hygiene &amp;nbsp;... His method was inefficient in the extreme, for an immense ground had to be covered to get anything at all unless blind chance intervened and, at first, I was almost a sorry witness of his doings, knowing that just a little theory and calculation would have saved him 90 percent of the labor. But he had a veritable contempt for book learning and mathematical knowledge, trusting himself entirely to his inventor's instinct and practical American sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Thomas Edison: Life of an Electrifying Man |coauthors= |year=2008 |publisher=Biographiq |isbn=1-59986-216-6 |page=23 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=LHHPo0vsdgMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=25 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Views on experimental and theoretical physics  ===
[[File:Ttesla.jpg|right|thumbnail|Tesla working in his laboratory.]]

Tesla exhibited a pre-atomic understanding of physics in his writings;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZNqo1zaZRTYC&amp;pg=PA181&amp;lpg=PA181&amp;dq=tesla+education+atomic+physics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZJ_NJfpmSP&amp;sig=pyuGct0TP-UXLdtmLPSrGqAnMt0&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=tesla%20education%20atomic%20physics&amp;f=false Thomas Valone, Harnessing the Wheelwork of Nature: Tesla's Science of Energy, Adventures Unlimited Press, 2002, Page 181]&lt;/ref&gt; he disagreed with the theory of atoms being composed of smaller [[subatomic particle]]s, stating there was no such thing as an [[electron]] creating an electric charge (he believed that if electrons existed at all they were some fourth state of matter or sub-atom that could only exist in an experimental vacuum and that they had nothing to do with electricity)&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=-cHJQL8qCEMC&amp;pg=PA249&amp;lpg=PA249&amp;dq=tesla+existence+electron&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TkQZngAgo8&amp;sig=MUVmH6O_5BHrA71HDCTGL1CJ82M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5JtTUOGhAYXf0QGsnIC4Cw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=tesla%20existence%20electron&amp;f=false James J.

He was a believer in the 19th century concept of an all pervasive &quot;[[Ether (classical element)|ether]]&quot; that transmitted electrical energy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=DzMR8x_rbPgC&amp;pg=PA1745&amp;lpg=PA1745&amp;dq=tesla+ether&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hBbyEyr4ID&amp;sig=FoxZ2SfzM1lTPGD8JicPfs8YGts&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TKNOUPvJB6jj0QHB44CgDQ&amp;ved=0CGMQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=tesla%20ether&amp;f=false Marc Seifer, Wizard: The Life and Times of Nikola Tesla, page 1745]&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla was generally antagonistic towards theories about the conversion of matter into energy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;{{Cite book|last=O'Neill|first=John|title=Prodigal Genius: The Life of Nikola Tesla|year=1944|publisher=Ives Washburn|isbn=0914732331|page=247|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prodigal_Genius:_The_Life_of_Nikola_Tesla}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also critical of Einstein's [[theory of relativity]], saying:

{{cquote|I hold that space cannot be curved, for the simple reason that it can have no properties. It might as well be said that God has properties. He has not, but only attributes and these are of our own making. Of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space. To say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing. I, for one, refuse to subscribe to such a view.&lt;ref&gt;[[New York Herald Tribune]], 11 September 1932&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Tesla claimed to have developed his own physical principle regarding matter and energy that he started working on in 1892&lt;ref name=autogenerated7 /&gt; and in 1937, at age 81, claimed in a letter to have completed a &quot;dynamic theory of gravity&quot; that ''&quot;[would] put an end to idle speculations and false conceptions, as that of curved space&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Nikola Tesla|url=http://www.famousscientists.org/nikola-tesla|publisher=FamousScientists.org|accessdate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the theory was &quot;worked out in all details&quot; and that he hoped to soon give it to the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tesla.hu/tesla/articles/19370710.doc Prepared Statement by Nikola Tesla] downloadable from www.tesla.hu&lt;/ref&gt; Further elucidation of his theory was never found in his writings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=8b-Dp_2KmJoC&amp;pg=PA309&amp;lpg=PA309&amp;dq=tesla+dynamic+theory+of+gravity&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=s2wKXznV8U&amp;sig=6KMbIEvnkV0VCBwcQCt1DHpxKrk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=jPxkUJ3dIMfn0QGM6oCYCw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=tesla%20dynamic%20theory%20of%20gravity&amp;f=false Margaret Cheney, Tesla: Man Out of Time, page 309]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Societal views ===
{{double image|left|Teslabust adjusted.jpg|150|Spomenik Nikoli Tesli na Nijagari.jpg|150|Bust of Tesla by [[Ivan Meštrović]], 1952, in [[Zagreb]], Croatia and Nikola Tesla monument by Les Drysdale in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]].}}

Tesla, like many of his era, became a proponent of an imposed [[selective breeding]] version of [[eugenics]]. His opinions stemmed from a belief that humans already interfered with the natural &quot;ruthless workings of nature&quot;, rather than from conceptions of a &quot;master race&quot; or inherent superiority of one person over another. His advocacy of it was, however, to push it further. In a 1937 interview, he stated:

{{quote|... man's new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings of nature. The only method compatible with our notions of civilization and the race is to prevent the breeding of the unfit by sterilization and the deliberate guidance of the mating instinct&amp;nbsp;.... The trend of opinion among eugenists is that we must make marriage more difficult. Certainly no one who is not a desirable parent should be permitted to produce progeny. A century from now it will no more occur to a normal person to mate with a person eugenically unfit than to marry a habitual criminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art11.html |title=A Machine to End War |date=February 1937 |publisher=Public Broadcasting Service |accessdate=23 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1926, Tesla commented on the ills of the social subservience of women and the struggle of women toward [[gender equality]], indicated that humanity's future would be run by &quot;Queen Bees&quot;. He believed that women would become the dominant sex in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, John B., &quot;''[http://www.tfcbooks.com/tesla/1926-01-30.htm When woman is boss], An interview with Nikola Tesla''&quot;. [[Collier's Weekly|Colliers]], 30 January 1926.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tesla made predictions about the relevant issues of a post-World War I environment in a printed article, &quot;Science and Discovery are the great Forces which will lead to the Consummation of the War&quot; (20 December 1914).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Tesla|first=Nikola|title=Science and Discovery are the great Forces which will lead to the Consummation of the War|url=http://www.rastko.rs/rastko/delo/10832|publisher=rastko|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tesla believed that the [[League of Nations]] was not a remedy for the times and issues.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

=== Religious views ===
Tesla was raised as an [[Orthodox Christian]]. Later in his life, he did not consider himself to be a &quot;believer in the orthodox sense&quot; and opposed [[religious fanaticism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1937&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=A Machine to End War|url=http://www.pbs.org/tesla/res/res_art11.html|publisher=PBS.org|accessdate=27 July 2012|author=Nikola Tesla|coauthors=by Nikola Tesla as told to George Sylvester Viereck|date=February 1937}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had a profound respect for both [[Buddhism]] and [[Christianity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tesla1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1937&quot; /&gt; 

In his article, &quot;The Problem of Increasing Human Energy&quot;, published in 1900, Tesla stated: {{bquote|For ages this idea [that each of us is only part of a whole] has been proclaimed in the consummately wise teachings of religion, probably not alone as a means of insuring peace and harmony among men, but as a deeply founded truth.

Tesla's legacy has endured in books, films, radio, TV, music, live theater, comics and video games. The lack of recognition received during his own lifetime has cast him as a tragic and inspirational character, well suited to dramatic fiction. The impact of the technologies invented by Tesla is a recurring theme in several types of science fiction.

*On Tesla's 75th birthday in 1931, [[Time magazine|''Time'' magazine]] put him on its cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Nikola Tesla {{!}} 20 July 1931|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/0,16641,19310720,00.html|publisher=TIME|accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover caption &quot;All the world's his power house&quot; noted his contribution to [[Electricity generation|electrical power generation]]. He received congratulatory letters from more than 70 pioneers in science and engineering, including Albert Einstein.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.teslasociety.com/time.jpg |title=Time front cover, Vol XVIII, No. 3, 20 July 1931 |date= |accessdate=10 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
