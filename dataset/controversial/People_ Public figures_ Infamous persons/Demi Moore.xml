Moore dropped out of high school at age 16 to pursue a modeling career, and posed for a nude pictorial in ''[[Oui (magazine)|Oui]]'' magazine in 1980. After making her film debut in 1981, she appeared on the soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]'' and subsequently gained attention for her roles in ''[[Blame It on Rio]]'' (1984) and ''[[St. Elmo's Fire (film)|St. Elmo's Fire]]'' (1985). Her first film to become both a critical and commercial hit was ''[[About Last Night...]]'' (1986), which established her as a Hollywood star.

In 1990, Moore starred in ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', which was the highest-grossing film of that year and brought her a [[Golden Globe]] nomination. She had a string of additional box-office successes over the early 1990s with ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' (1992), ''[[Indecent Proposal]]'' (1993), and ''[[Disclosure (film)|Disclosure]]'' (1994). In 1996, Moore became the highest-paid actress in film history when she was paid a then-unprecedented salary of $12.5 million to star in ''[[Striptease (film)|Striptease]]''. The high-profile disappointment of that film as well as her next, ''[[G.I. Jane]]'' (1997), was followed by a lengthy hiatus and significant downturn in Moore's acting career, although she has remained a subject of substantial media interest during the years since.

Moore took her professional name from her first husband, musician [[Freddy Moore]], and is the mother of three daughters from her second marriage to actor [[Bruce Willis]]. She married her third husband, actor [[Ashton Kutcher]], in 2005, and separated from him in November 2011.

==Background and early life==
Moore was born in [[Roswell, New Mexico]]. As a child, she had a difficult and unstable home life. Moore's parents separated before she was born, with her biological father, [[Air Force]] man Charles Harmon, Sr.&lt;ref name=&quot;Demi Moore's Long-Lost Siblings: We Can Save Her&quot; /&gt; leaving her mother, Virginia (née King), after a two-month marriage.&lt;ref name=VF-aug1991-p144&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Demi's Big Moment|first=Nancy |last=Collins|work=[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]|date=August 1991|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Moore was three months old, her mother married Dan Guynes, a newspaper advertising salesman who frequently changed jobs; as a result, the family moved a great many times.&lt;ref name=biochannel /&gt; Moore said in 1991, &quot;My dad was Dan Guynes. He raised me. There is a man who would be considered my biological father who I don't really have a relationship with.&quot;&lt;ref name=VF-aug1991-p144 /&gt; Moore learned of him at age 13, when she found her mother and stepfather's marriage certificate and inquired about the circumstances since &quot;I saw my parents were married in February 1963. I was born in '62.&quot;&lt;ref name=VF-aug1991-p144 /&gt; Dan Guynes committed [[suicide]] in October 1980 at age 37, two years after divorcing Moore's mother.&lt;ref name=VF-aug1991-p144 /&gt; Moore's biological father appeared on ''[[Inside Edition]]'' in 1995, making an appeal to see his grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Breaking up gets easier to do

Moore was [[strabismus|cross-eyed]] as a child; this was ultimately corrected by two surgeries. She also suffered from [[kidney]] dysfunction.&lt;ref name=biochannel&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biographies/demi-moore.html |title=Demi Moore |publisher=The Biography Channel UK |accessdate=February 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 15, Moore moved to [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], [[California]], where her mother worked for a magazine-distribution company.&lt;ref name=VF-aug1991-p144 /&gt; Moore attended [[Fairfax High School, West Hollywood, California|Fairfax High School]] there,&lt;ref name=VF-aug1991-p144 /&gt; and recalled, &quot;I moved out of my family's house when I was 16 and left high school in my junior year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Demi, More or Less|first=Walter|last=Thomas|work=Scene|date=January 1987|page=33 (unnumbred)}}&lt;/ref&gt; She got a job at a [[debt collection agency]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot;/&gt; signed a modeling contract with the [[Elite Modeling Agency]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web||title=John Casablancas Modeling &amp; Career Centers Re-opens in Chicago |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/2008/5/prweb942664.htm |publisher=Oakbrook Terrace|date=May 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; then enrolled in drama classes after being inspired by 17-year-old German actress [[Nastassja Kinski]],  who lived in the same apartment building as Moore.&lt;ref name=VF-augu1991-p145&gt;Collins, p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1979, three months before her 17th birthday,&lt;ref name=VF-augu1991-p145 /&gt; Moore met musician [[Freddy Moore]] at the [[Los Angeles]] nightclub [[The Troubadour (Los Angeles)|The Troubadour]].&lt;ref name=embassy /&gt; Freddy Moore was married to another woman at that time.&lt;ref name=VF-augu1991-p145 /&gt; In February 1980, six months after they met, Freddy and Demi were married&lt;ref name=people-demi-bio /&gt; and moved into an apartment in West Hollywood.&lt;ref name=embassy&gt;{{cite press release|title=Demi Moore, Female Lead in 'Parasite,' Rocketed to Fame in 'General Hospital'| publisher=[[Embassy Pictures]], ''[[Parasite (film)|Parasite]]'' (1982)|page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore appeared on the cover of the January 1981 issue of the adult magazine ''[[Oui (magazine)|Oui]]'', in which she posed for a series of photographs containing full frontal nudity.&lt;ref name=ew-mannes&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,297532,00.html|title= When Moore Was Less|first=George|last= Mannes | date=June 9, 1995|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spy&gt;{{Cite news|last=Gregory|first=Alex|last2=Huyck|first2=Peter|magazine=Spy|title=The Bimbo Conspiracy|year=1995|date=August 1995|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Zgu9QCTT_SwC|pages=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1988 interview, Moore claimed she &quot;only posed for the cover of ''Oui''&amp;mdash;I was 16; I told them I was 18&quot; and that the photos inside the issue &quot;were for a European fashion magazine.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Moore Ways Than One|first=Alan|last=Carter|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=[[New York]]|date=March 31, 1988|page=51}}.

And later, nude shots of her turned up in ''Celebrity Sleuth''&amp;mdash;photos that she once said 'were for a European fashion magazine'.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, she told another interviewer, &quot;I was 17 years old.

In October 1981, Moore made her film debut with a supporting role in the low-budget teen drama ''[[Choices (1981 film)|Choices]]'', directed by [[Silvio Narizzano]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1004101-choices/ ''Choices'' (1981)] at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]&lt;/ref&gt; Her second feature was the 1982 [[3-D film|3-D]] science fiction/horror film ''[[Parasite (film)|Parasite]]'', for which director [[Charles Band]] had instructed casting director Johanna Ray to &quot;find me the next [[Karen Allen]].&quot;&lt;ref name=ew-mannes /&gt; Moore gained greater exposure when she joined the cast of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]'', playing the role of Jackie Templeton from 1982 to 1983. She made an uncredited [[cameo appearance]] as that character in the 1982 spoof ''[[Young Doctors in Love]]''.

Moore's film career took off in 1984 following her appearance in the sex comedy ''[[Blame It on Rio]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/59183625.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+19%2C+1991&amp;author=Jay+Carr%2C+Globe+Staff&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=The+spirit+of+success+moves+Demi+Moore&amp;pqatl=google|title=The spirit of success moves Demi Moore|publisher= [[Boston Globe]]|date=April 19, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, she played the lead role in ''[[No Small Affair]]''.

[[Image:Ghost pottery wheel.jpg|thumb|200px|Moore and [[Patrick Swayze]] in ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'' (1990)]]
Her most successful film as of 2012 was the supernatural romantic melodrama ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', a [[sleeper hit|sleeper]] hit that grossed $505 million at the box office and was the highest-grossing film of 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?view2=worldwide&amp;yr=1990&amp;p=.htm|title=1990 Worldwide Grosses}}&lt;/ref&gt; The love scene between Moore and [[Patrick Swayze]] that begins in front of a [[potter's wheel]] as the song &quot;[[Unchained Melody]]&quot; plays has become an iconic moment in film history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/theater/way_ghost_busted_pADzccicJVUmbkqXTveNcL|title='Ghost the Musical' Broadway show is flashy, busy, and more than a little bit cheesy}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.msn.com/photo-gallery/feature/50-greatest-movie-romances/?photoidx=4|title=50 Greatest Movie Romances}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ghost'' was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]], and Moore's performance as Molly Jensen garnered her a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination as Best Actress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Demi Moore - Awards&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000193/awards|title=Demi Moore - Awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1991, Moore co-produced and starred in the mystery thriller ''[[Mortal Thoughts]]'', and appeared as a blonde for the first time in the romantic comedy ''[[The Butcher's Wife]]'', with Roger Ebert's review describing her as &quot;warm and cuddly&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19911025/REVIEWS/110250301/1023|title=Roger Ebert's review of &quot;The Butcher's Wife&quot; | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both films were box-office disappointments, but Moore sustained her [[A-list]] status with her starring roles in [[Rob Reiner]]'s ''[[A Few Good Men]]'' (1992), [[Adrian Lyne]]'s ''[[Indecent Proposal]]'' (1993), and [[Barry Levinson]]'s ''[[Disclosure (film)|Disclosure]]'' (1994)—all of which opened at #1 at the box office and were blockbuster hits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Demi Moore Movie Box Office Results&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=demimoore.htm|title=Demi Moore Movie Box Office Results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1995, Moore was the highest-paid actress in Hollywood.&lt;ref name=&quot;highest-paid&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/21030596.html?dids=21030596:21030596&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+08%2C+1995&amp;author=Stephen+Schaefer&amp;pub=Boston+Herald&amp;desc=Movies+Moore+the+Merrier+Give+an+%60A'+for+effort+to+Demi%2C+Hollywood's+highest-paid+woman&amp;pqatl=google|title=Movies Moore the Merrier Give an 'A' for effort to Demi, Hollywood's highest-paid woman|work=[[Boston Herald]]|first=Stephen |last=Schaefer|date=October 8, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, she subsequently had a string of unsuccessful films starting with ''[[The Scarlet Letter (1995 film)|The Scarlet Letter]]'', a &quot;freely adapted&quot; version of the historical romance novel by [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]], in which her portrayal of [[Hester Prynne]] was met with harsh criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PG&amp;p_theme=pg&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EADF95DABA08749&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Demi's Debacle Now, The Actress Has to Get 'The Scarlet Letter' Off Her Back}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the poor reception of that film and her follow-up release, ''[[The Juror]]'', Moore was paid a record-breaking salary of $12.5 million in 1996 to star in ''[[Striptease (film)|Striptease]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;highest-paid&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sun_sentinel/access/14909964.html?dids=14909964:14909964&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+27%2C+1996&amp;author=IVOR+DAVIS+New+York+Times+Syndicate&amp;pub=South+Florida+Sun+-+Sentinel&amp;desc=MORE+MOORE+DEMI+MOORE+SAYS+SHE+FELT+THE+POWER+OF+STRIPPERS+EXPERIENCE+WHEN+THEY'RE+DANCING+AND+DEFENDS+THE+WOMEN+WHO+PEEL+FOR+A+LIVING.&amp;pqatl=google|title=More Moore: Demi Moore Says She Felt the Power of Strippers Experience When They're Dancing and Defends the Women Who Peel for a Living|publisher= [[Sun-Sentinel]]|location =South [[Florida]]|date=June 27, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much hype was made about Moore's willingness to dance topless for the part, though this was the sixth time she had shown her breasts on film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot;/&gt; Although the film was actually a financial success—grossing over $113 million worldwide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=striptease.htm|title=Striptease (1996) - Box Office Mojo}}&lt;/ref&gt;—it failed to reach expectations and was widely considered a flop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MN&amp;p_theme=mn&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EFD62A77840CB7B&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Skin and Steam No Longer a Sure Bet}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, she also produced and starred in a controversial [[miniseries]] for [[HBO]] called ''[[If These Walls Could Talk]]'', a three-part anthology about [[abortion]]. Its screenwriter, [[Nancy Savoca]], directed two segments, including one in which Moore played a single woman in the 1950s seeking a back-alley abortion. For that role, Moore received a second Golden Globe nomination as Best Actress.&lt;ref name=&quot;Demi Moore - Awards&quot;/&gt;

Moore famously shaved her head in order to play a female [[Navy SEALS]] recruit in ''[[G.I. Jane]]'' (1997), directed by [[Ridley Scott]]. The film was a moderate box office success,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= G.I.

[[File:Moore09Cropped.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Moore in 2009]]
After ''G.I. Jane'', Moore took a low-profile role in [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Deconstructing Harry]]'', then left the Hollywood spotlight and moved to [[Hailey, Idaho]] on a full-time basis to devote herself to raising her three daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://entertainment.stv.tv/showbiz/48872-demi-moores-daughter-focus/|title=Demi Moore's daugher focus|work=STV}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was offscreen for three years before re-emerging in the arthouse drama ''[[Passion of Mind]]'' (2000). Her performance was critically acclaimed, but the film itself received mixed reviews and was deemed &quot;naggingly slow&quot; by some critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=L_ZLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AO4DAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=demi%20moore%20passion%20of%20mind&amp;pg=6944%2C7417131|title='Passion of Mind' moves naggingly slowly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore then resumed her self-imposed career hiatus and continued to turn down film offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=ET&amp;p_theme=et&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0FC11CE614999F9D&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|title=Moore Returns to Spotlight After 6-year Hiatus|date=July 5, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Irwin Winkler]] said in 2001, &quot;I had a project about a year and a half ago, and we made an inquiry about her—a real good commercial picture. She wasn't interested.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Out of Sight&quot;/&gt;

Another three years passed before Moore acted again. She returned to the screen as the villain of the 2003 film ''[[Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle]]'', but that was followed by yet another three-year absence. In the interim, Moore signed on as the face of the [[Versace]] fashion brand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/ten/2005/0628/moored.html Demi Moore is new face of Versace]''RTE'' June 28, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and then the [[Helena Rubinstein]] brand of cosmetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://stylenews.peoplestylewatch.com/2006/11/10/fantasy-gifts-o-2/| date=November 10, 2006 |title=Fantasy Gifts: Our Birthday Picks for Demi Moore|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, she appeared in ''[[Bobby (2006 film)|Bobby]]'' which featured an all-star cast, including her husband [[Ashton Kutcher]], although they did not appear in any scenes together.

Moore reunited with ''Blame It on Rio'' co-star [[Michael Caine]] for the British crime drama ''[[Flawless (2007 film)|Flawless]]'', which came out in a limited release in 2008 with generally positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/flawless|title='Flawless' Critic reviews|work=MetaCritic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2012, her last appearance in a widely released film was in 2007's ''[[Mr. Brooks]]'' with [[Kevin Costner]]. Since then, she has acted in several low-key independent films, including the 2011 corporate drama ''[[Margin Call (film)|Margin Call]]'', in which she had a small role.

Moore had been cast to play feminist activist [[Gloria Steinem]] in the [[Linda Lovelace]] biographical film ''[[Lovelace (film)|Lovelace]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/demi-moore-gloria-steinem-linda-lovelace-277291 |title=Demi Moore to Play Feminist Activist Gloria Steinem in Linda Lovelace Movie|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=January 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; but within a month of being announced for the role, she dropped out of the production in the wake of a January 23, 2012 hospitalization and what her representative called &quot;professional assistance to treat her exhaustion and improve her overall health.&quot;&lt;ref name=cnnjan25&gt;{{cite news| url=http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2012/01/25/demi-moore-seeks-treatment-drops-out-of-lovelace/|date=January 25, 2012|title=Demi Moore seeks treatment, drops out of 'Lovelace'|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sarah Jessica Parker]] took over the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/news/story/2012-02-02/sarah-jessica-parker-lovelace/52940246/1| title=Sarah Jessica Parker steps into Steinem role|first=Bryan |last=Alexander|work=[[USA Today]]|date=February 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Vanity Fair'' controversy==
{{See also|More Demi Moore|Demi's Birthday Suit}}
In August 1991, Moore appeared nude on the cover of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' under the title ''[[More Demi Moore]]''. [[Annie Leibovitz]] shot the picture while Moore was seven months pregnant with her daughter Scout LaRue, intending to portray &quot;anti-Hollywood, anti-glitz&quot; attitude.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Susan Heller. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE3D8173AF932A25754C0A967958260 &quot;Chronicle&quot;]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. July 11, 1991. Retrieved March 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The cover sparked an intense controversy for ''Vanity Fair'' and Moore. It was widely discussed on television, radio, and in newspaper articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.cas.buffalo.edu/classes/dms/berna/dms434/readings/stabile.pdf |format=PDF|title= Shooting the mother: Fetal photography and the politics of disappearance |accessdate=August 23, 2007 |last= Stabile |first= C. |year= 1992 |work=Camera Obscura }}&lt;/ref&gt; The frankness of Leibovitz's portrayal of a pregnant sex symbol led to divided opinions, ranging from complaints of [[sexual objectification]] to celebrations of the photograph as a symbol of [[empowerment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.insidebayarea.com/localnews/ci_6606324 |title= Big bold bellies: Flaunting one's pregnancy becomes a fashion trend |accessdate=August 23, 2007 |last= Murphy |first= Candace |date= August 12, 2007 |work=Inside Bay Area |publisher=ANG Newspapers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The photograph was subject to numerous parodies, including the [[Spy magazine|''Spy'']] magazine version which placed Moore's then-husband [[Bruce Willis]]' head on her body. In ''[[Leibovitz v. Paramount Pictures Corp.]]'', Leibovitz sued over one [[parody]] featuring [[Leslie Nielsen]], made to promote the 1994 film ''[[Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult]]''. In the parody, the model's body was attached to what is described as &quot;the guilty and smirking face&quot; of Nielsen. The [[teaser trailer|teaser]] said &quot;Due this March&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;parody&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E7DE1531F933A15751C1A960958260&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=%22Demi+Moore%22+%22Vanity+Fair%22&amp;st=nyt|title= A Parody of a Pregnant Actress Stands Up in Court|accessdate=February 19, 2008|work=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 20, 1996|author=Richardson, Lynda}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dismissed in 1996 because the parody relied &quot;for its comic effect on the contrast between the original&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;parody&quot;/&gt; In November 2009, the [[Morocco|Moroccan]] magazine ''[[Femmes du Maroc]]'' emulated the infamous pose with Moroccan news reporter Nadia Larguet, causing controversy in the majority Muslim nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://cabalamuse.wordpress.com/2009/10/30/i-am-pregnant-and-i-exist/ |title=I Am Pregnant And I Exist|accessdate=November 6, 2009 |last= T.B. |first= Ahmed }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lawsuits ===
On January 28, 1998, Moore and Willis sued their former nanny, Kim Tannahill, in a [[U.S. district court]] in [[Blaine County, Idaho]], claiming she billed them for personal expenses, welshed on some $8,000 worth of loans and blabbed about their private lives in violation of a [[confidentiality agreement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Domestic Drama&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author= Larry Hackett|url=https://www.peoplepets.com/people/archive/article/0,,20124855,00.html |title=Domestic Drama |publisher=People.com |date=March 30, 1998|accessdate=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple sought at least $300,000 in damages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Domestic Drama&quot;/&gt; On February 2, 1998, Tannahill filed a [[countersuit]] in a [[Los Angeles Superior Court]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Domestic Drama&quot;/&gt; In that lawsuit, Tannahill claimed that she was subjected to &quot;intimidation, threats and force,&quot; and accused Moore of locking her in a bedroom for a two-hour &quot;verbal beating&quot; upon firing her in August 1997,&lt;ref name=&quot;Domestic Drama&quot;/&gt; quoting Moore as saying &quot;It's scary what I could do to you.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Domestic Drama&quot;/&gt; Tannahill's lawsuit was thrown out by a federal judge in April 1998,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Associated Press|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=LKxeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wS4MAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=demi%20moore%20tannahill&amp;pg=5828%2C3815990|title=Judge Throws Out Ex-Nanny's Lawsuit Against Bruce and Demi|publisher=Lewiston Morning Tribune |date=April 14, 1998|accessdate=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the outcome of the suit filed by Moore and Willis was not publicly disclosed.

In May 2003, Moore was sued by the former manager of her Idaho ranch, Lawrence Bass, for [[sexual harassment]] and discrimination.&lt;ref name=&quot;Demi Moore Sued for Sexual Harassment&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author= Stephen M.

===Interests===
She is a follower of [[Philip Berg]]'s [[Kabbalah Centre]] religion, and initiated Kutcher into the faith, having said that she &quot;didn't grow up Jewish, but ... would say that [she has] been more exposed to the deeper meanings of particular rituals than any of [her] friends that did.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
