[[File:HooverJoven.jpg|thumb|upright|J. Edgar Hoover in 1924]]

'''John Edgar Hoover''' (January 1, 1895 – May 2, 1972) was the first [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) of the United States. Appointed director of the Bureau of Investigation—predecessor to the FBI—in 1924, he was instrumental in founding the FBI in 1935, where he remained director until his death in 1972 aged 77. Hoover is credited with building the FBI into a large and efficient crime-fighting agency, and with instituting a number of modernizations to police technology, such as a centralized fingerprint file and forensic laboratories.

Late in life and after his death Hoover became a controversial figure, as evidence of his secretive actions became known. His critics have accused him of exceeding the jurisdiction of the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document

==Early life and education==
J. Edgar Hoover was born on [[New Year's Day]] 1895 in [[Washington, D.C.]], to Anna Marie (née Scheitlin; 1860–1938), who was of [[Swiss people|German Swiss]] descent, and Dick Naylor Hoover, Sr. (1856–1921), of [[English people|English]] and [[German people|German]] ancestry. The uncle of Hoover's mother was a Swiss honorary [[consul general]] to the United States. Hoover did not have a birth certificate filed, although it was required in 1895 Washington. Two siblings had certificates.  Hoover's was not filed until 1938, when he was 43.&lt;ref&gt;[http://american_almanac.tripod.com/hoover.htm Edward Spannaus, &quot;The Mysterious Origins of J. Edgar Hoover&quot;], ''American Almanac,'' August 2000&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hoover grew up near the [[Eastern Market, Washington, D.C.|Eastern Market]] in Washington's [[Capitol Hill]] neighborhood. At [[Cardozo Senior High School|Central High]], he sang in the school choir, participated in the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] program, and competed on the debate team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Cox, John Stuart and Theoharis, Athan G. |year = 1988 | title = The Boss: J. Edgar Hoover and the Great American Inquisition | publisher = Temple University Press | isbn = 0-87722-532-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he argued against women getting the right to vote and against the abolition of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jan/01/j-edgar-hoover-secret-fbi &quot;The secret life of J Edgar Hoover&quot;], ''The Guardian,'' 1 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The school newspaper applauded his &quot;cool, relentless logic&quot;.&lt;ref name=Weiner-ch1 /&gt; 

He obtained a law degree from [[George Washington University Law School]] in 1916, and an [[LL.M.]], a Master of Laws degree, in 1917 from the same university.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document| url = http://gwtoday.gwu.edu/people/jedgarhooversgwyears | contribution = J. Edgar Hoover's GW Years | title = GW Today | publisher = GWU }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document| url = http://alumni.gwu.edu/prominent/classyear/1880s30s.html | publisher = GWU | title = Alumni | contribution = Prominent }}.&lt;/ref&gt; While a law student, Hoover became interested in the career of [[Anthony Comstock]], the [[New York City]] [[United States Postal Inspection Service|United States Postal Inspector]], who waged prolonged campaigns against fraud and [[vice]], and also was against [[pornography]] and [[birth control]].

Hoover lived in Washington, D.C., for his entire life.&lt;ref name=Weiner-ch1&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Tim|authorlink=Tim Weiner|title=Enemies a history of the FBI|year=2012|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-679-64389-0|edition=1|chapter=Anarchy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Department of Justice==
Immediately after getting his degree, Hoover was hired by the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] to work in the War Emergency Division. He soon became the head of the Division's Alien Enemy Bureau, authorized by President [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]] at the beginning of [[World War I]] to arrest and jail disloyal foreigners without trial.&lt;ref name=Weiner-ch1 /&gt; He received additional authority from the 1917 [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]]. Out of a list of 1400 suspicious Germans living in the U.S., the Bureau arrested 98 and designated 1,172 as arrestable.&lt;ref name=Weiner-ch3 /&gt; 

In August 1919, Hoover became head of the [[Bureau of Investigation]]'s new General Intelligence Division—also known as the Radical Division because its goal was to monitor and disrupt the work of domestic radicals.&lt;ref name=Weiner-ch3&gt;{{cite book|last=Weiner|first=Tim|authorlink=Tim Weiner|title=Enemies a history of the FBI|year=2012|publisher=Random House|location=New York|isbn=978-0-679-64389-0|edition=1|chapter=Traitors}}&lt;/ref&gt; America's [[First Red Scare]] was beginning, and one of Hoover's first assignments was to carry out the [[Palmer Raids]].&lt;ref name = &quot;murray&quot;&gt;{{cite book| title = Red Scare: A Study in National Hysteria, 1919–1920 | last = Murray | first = Robert K | year = 1955 | publisher = University of Minnesota Press | location = Minneapolis | isbn = 0-8166-5833-1 | page = 193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoover and his chosen assistant, George Ruch&lt;ref&gt;Ruch was one of two people to name their own sons J. Edgar, and complained of the idea that radicals &quot;be allowed to speak and write as they like&quot;. See: Summers, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; monitored a variety of U.S. radicals with the intent to punish, arrest, or deport them. Targets during this period included [[Marcus Garvey]];&lt;ref name=Ellis1994&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Mark|title=J. Edgar Hoover and the 'Red Summer' of 1919|journal=Journal of American Studies|year=1994|month=April|volume=28|issue=1|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/27555783|accessdate=14 August 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|quote=Hoover asked Anthony Caminetti, the Commissioner of the Bureau of Immigration, to consider deporting Garvey, forwarding an anonymous letter from New York about Garvey's alleged crookedness. Meanwhile, George Ruch placed Garvey at the top of a new central list of deportable radicals. On August 15th, Hoover ordered a new investigation of Garvey's &quot;aggressive activities&quot; and the preparation of a deportation case. [...] eventually, in 1923, when Hoover was Assistant Director and Chief of the BI, he nailed Garvey for mail fraud. He was imprisoned in February 1925 and deported to Jamaica in November 1927.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rose Pastor Stokes]] and [[Cyril Briggs]];&lt;ref name=Kornweibel1998&gt;{{cite book|last=Kornweibel, Jr.|first=Theodore|title=Seeing Red: Federal Campaigns Against Black Militancy, 1919–1925|year=1998|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=9780253333377|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7Br3bZZzcv8C&amp;dq|page=145|chapter='The Most Colossal Conspiracy against the United States'|quote=Convinced that the ''Crusader'' was 'financed by the Communist Party,' agents described Briggs as one of Rose Pastor Stokes's 'able assistants in this work.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emma Goldman]] and [[Alexander Berkman]];&lt;ref name=HooverMemo23Aug1919&gt;{{cite web|last=Hoover|first=J.

In 1921, he rose in the [[Bureau of Investigation]] to deputy head, and in 1924, the Attorney General made him the acting director. On May 10, 1924, President [[Calvin Coolidge]] appointed Hoover as the sixth director of the Bureau of Investigation, following President [[Warren Harding]]'s death and in response to allegations that the prior director, [[William J. Burns]], was involved in the [[Teapot Dome|Teapot Dome scandal]]. When Hoover took over the Bureau of Investigation, it had approximately 650 employees, including 441 Special Agents.

Hoover was noted as sometimes being capricious in his leadership; he frequently fired FBI agents, singling out those who he thought &quot;looked stupid like truck drivers&quot; or he considered to be &quot;pinheads&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Schott |first = Joseph L |title = No Left Turns: The FBI in Peace &amp; War |publisher = Praeger |year = 1975 |isbn = 0-275-33630-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes |date= 2012|date=February 2012}}  He also relocated agents who had displeased him to career-ending assignments and locations.  [[Melvin Purvis]] was a prime example; he was one of the most effective agents in capturing and breaking up 1930s gangs and received substantial public recognition, but a jealous Hoover maneuvered him out of the FBI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Purvis | first1 = Alston | last2 = Tresinowski | first2 = Alex | title = The Vendetta: FBI Hero Melvin Purvis's War Against Crime and J. Edgar Hoover's War Against Him |publisher = Public Affairs |year = 2005 |pages = 183+ |isbn = 1-58648-301-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoover often hailed local law-enforcement officers around the country and built up a national network of supporters and admirers in the process. One that he often commended was the [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] [[sheriff]] of [[Caddo Parish, Louisiana|Caddo Parish]], [[Louisiana]], [[J. Howell Flournoy]], for particular effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sheriff 26 Years – J. H. Flournoy Dies,&quot; ''Shreveport Journal'', December 14, 1966, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gangster wars===
[[File:Depression era gangsters.ogg|thumb|left|Famous [[Depression Era]] gangsters, including [[Pretty Boy Floyd]], [[Baby Face Nelson]], [[Machine Gun Kelly]], and more (1920s).]]

In the early 1930s, criminal gangs carried out large numbers of [[bank robberies]] in the [[Midwest]]. They used their superior firepower and fast getaway cars to elude local law enforcement agencies and avoid arrest. Many of these criminals, particularly [[John Dillinger]], who became famous for leaping over bank cages and repeatedly escaping from jails and police traps, frequently made newspaper headlines across the United States. Since the robbers operated across state lines, their crimes became federal offenses, giving Hoover and his men the authority to pursue them. Initially, the FBI suffered some embarrassing foul-ups, in particular with Dillinger and his conspirators. A raid on a summer lodge named &quot;[[Little Bohemia Lodge|Little Bohemia]]&quot; in [[Manitowish Waters, Wisconsin]], left an FBI agent and a civilian bystander dead, and others wounded. All the gangsters escaped. Hoover realized that his job was now on the line, and he pulled out all stops to capture the culprits. In late July 1934, Special Agent Melvin Purvis, the Director of Operations in the [[Chicago]] office, received a tip on Dillinger's whereabouts which paid off when Dillinger was located, ambushed and killed by FBI agents outside the [[Biograph Theater]].

In the same period, there were numerous [[Mafia]] shootings as a result of [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]], while Hoover continued to deny the very existence of [[organized crime]].&lt;ref&gt;Sifakis, Carl. ''The Mafia Encyclopedia'' (New York: Facts on File, 1999), p.127.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Costello]] helped encourage this view by feeding Hoover, &quot;an inveterate horseplayer&quot; known to send Special Agents to place $100 bets for him,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sifakis, p.127&quot;&gt;Sifakis, p.127.&lt;/ref&gt; tips on sure winners through their mutual friend, [[gossip columnist]] [[Walter Winchell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sifakis, p.127&quot; /&gt; Hoover said the Bureau had &quot;much more important functions&quot; than arresting bookmakers and gamblers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sifakis, p.127&quot; /&gt;

Even though he was not there, Hoover was credited with several highly publicized captures or shootings of outlaws and [[bank robbers]]. These included that of Dillinger, [[Alvin Karpis]], and [[Machine Gun Kelly]], which led to the Bureau's powers being broadened and it was given its new name in 1935: the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]. In 1939, the FBI became pre-eminent in the field of domestic intelligence. Hoover made changes, such as expanding and combining fingerprint files in the Identification Division to compile the largest collection of fingerprints to date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More Fingerprints Called Necessary...

===Investigation of subversion and radicals===

[[File:Lennon FBI Files after hq11p1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|alt=Document with some sections blacked out.|The same Hoover letter, with fewer redactions.]]
Hoover was concerned about [[subversion (political)|subversion]], and under his leadership, the FBI spied upon tens of thousands of suspected subversives and radicals. According to critics, Hoover tended to exaggerate the dangers of these alleged subversives and many times overstepped his bounds in his pursuit of eliminating that perceived threat.&lt;ref&gt;
See, for example,
{{cite book|author = Cox, John Stuart and Theoharis, Athan G. |year = 1988 |title = The Boss: J. Edgar Hoover and the Great American Inquisition |publisher = Temple University Press |isbn = 0-87722-532-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI investigated rings of German saboteurs and spies starting in the late 1930s, and had primary responsibility for counterespionage. The first arrests of German agents were made in 1938, and continued throughout World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Breuer]], ''Hitler's Undercover War'', New York: St. Matin's Press, 1989, ISBN 0-312-02620-X.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Ex parte Quirin|Quirin]] affair during [[World War II]], German [[U-boat]]s set two small groups of Nazi agents ashore in [[Florida]] and [[Long Island]] to cause acts of [[sabotage]] within the country. The two teams were apprehended after one of the men contacted the FBI, and told them everything. He was also charged and convicted.&lt;ref&gt;

  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FBI participated in the [[Venona Project]], a pre–World War II joint project with the British to eavesdrop on [[Soviet]] spies in the [[UK]] and the United States. It was not initially realized that [[espionage]] was being committed, but due to multiple wartime Soviet use of [[one-time pad]] ciphers, which are normally unbreakable, redundancies were created, enabling some intercepts to be decoded, which established the espionage. Hoover kept the intercepts—America's greatest [[counterintelligence]] secret—in a locked safe in his office, choosing not to inform President Truman, [[Attorney General of the United States|Attorney General]] [[J. Howard McGrath]], or two Secretaries of State—[[Dean Acheson]] and General [[George Marshall]]—while they held office. He informed the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) of the Venona Project in 1952.

In 1946, U.S. Attorney General [[Tom C. Clark]] authorized Hoover to compile a list of potentially disloyal Americans who might be detained during a wartime national emergency.  In 1950, at the outbreak of the Korean War, Hoover submitted to President Truman a plan to suspend the writ of [[habeas corpus]] and detain 12,000 Americans suspected of disloyalty. Truman did not act on the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first= Tim|last=Weiner|title=Hoover Planned Mass Jailing in 1950. |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/23/washington/23habeas.html|publisher=New York Times|date=December 23, 2007|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===COINTELPRO years===
{{Main|COINTELPRO}}

In 1956, Hoover was becoming increasingly frustrated by [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decisions that limited the Justice Department's ability to prosecute people for their political opinions, most notably communists. At this time he formalized a covert &quot;dirty tricks&quot; program under the name [[COINTELPRO]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|author = Cox, John Stuart and Theoharis, Athan G. |year = 1988 |title = The Boss: J. Edgar Hoover and the Great American Inquisition |publisher = Temple University Press |page = 312 |isbn = 0-87722-532-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This program remained in place until it was revealed to the public in 1971, after the theft of many internal documents stolen from an office in Media, Pennsylvania, and was the cause of some of the harshest criticism of Hoover and the FBI. COINTELPRO was first used to disrupt the [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]], where Hoover went after targets that ranged from suspected everyday spies to larger celebrity figures such as [[Charlie Chaplin]] who were seen as spreading [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party]] propaganda,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last = Sbardellati |first = John |coauthors = Tony Shaw |title = Booting a Tramp: Charlie Chaplin, the FBI, and the Construction of the Subversive Image in Red Scare America}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later organizations such as the [[Black Panther Party]], [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]'s [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] and others. Its methods included infiltration, burglaries, illegal wiretaps, planting forged documents and spreading false rumors about key members of target organizations.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last = Kessler |first = Ronald |authorlink = Ronald Kessler |title = The Bureau: The Secret History of the FBI |publisher = St. Martin's Paperbacks |year = 2002 |pages = 107, 174, 184, 215 |isbn = 0-312-98977-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some authors have charged that COINTELPRO methods also included inciting violence and arranging murders.&lt;ref&gt;

In 1975, the activities of COINTELPRO were investigated by the United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities, called the [[Church Committee]] after its chairman, Senator [[Frank Church]] ([[U.S. Democratic Party|D]]-[[Idaho]]), and these activities were declared illegal and contrary to the [[Constitution]].&lt;ref&gt;

Hoover amassed significant power by collecting files containing large amounts of compromising and potentially embarrassing information on many powerful people, especially politicians. According to [[Laurence Silberman]], appointed [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]] in early 1974, FBI Director [[Clarence M. Kelley]] thought such files either did not exist or had been destroyed. After ''[[The Washington Post]]'' broke a story in January 1975, Kelley searched and found them in his outer office. The [[House Judiciary Committee]] then demanded that Silberman testify about them.

In 1956, several years before he targeted King, Hoover had a public showdown with [[T.R.M. Howard]], a [[civil rights]] leader from [[Mound Bayou, Mississippi]]. During a national speaking tour, Howard had criticized the FBI's failure to thoroughly investigate the racially motivated murders of [[George W. Lee]], [[Lamar Smith (activist)|Lamar Smith]], and [[Emmett Till]]. Hoover wrote an open letter to the press singling out these statements as &quot;irresponsible.&quot;

===Response to Mafia and civil rights groups===
In the 1950s, evidence of Hoover's unwillingness to focus FBI resources on the [[Mafia]] became grist for the media and his many detractors. His moves against people who maintained contacts with subversive elements, some of whom were members of the civil rights movement, also led to accusations of trying to undermine their reputations. The treatment of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] and actress [[Jean Seberg]] are two examples. [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] recalled that Hoover told President [[John F. Kennedy]] that King tried to arrange a sex party while in the capital for the March on Washington and told [[Robert Kennedy]] that King made derogatory comments during the President's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Klein |first = Rick |title = Jacqueline Kennedy on Rev.

Hoover personally directed the FBI investigation into the [[assassination of President John F. Kennedy]]. In 1964, just days before Hoover testified in the earliest stages of the [[Warren Commission]] hearings, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] waived the then-mandatory U.S. Government Service Retirement Age of seventy, allowing Hoover to remain the FBI Director &quot;for life.&quot; The [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] issued a report in 1979 critical of the performance by the FBI, the Warren Commission, and other agencies. The report also criticized what it characterized as the FBI's reluctance to thoroughly investigate the possibility of a conspiracy to assassinate the President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Report of the Select Committee on Assassinations of the U.S. House of Representatives |work = |publisher = The U.S. National Archives and Records Administration |year = 1979 |url = http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/ |accessdate =October 25, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late career and death===

Presidents [[Harry S. Truman]] and [[John F. Kennedy]] each considered dismissing Hoover as FBI Director, but ultimately concluded that the political cost of doing so would be too great.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hack, 2007&quot;&gt;Hack, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoover's FBI investigated [[Hollywood]] [[lobbyist]] [[Jack Valenti]], a special assistant and confidant to President [[Lyndon Johnson]], in 1964. Despite Valenti's two-year marriage to Johnson's personal secretary, the investigation focused on rumors that he was having a gay relationship with a commercial photographer friend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/02202009/news/nationalnews/gay_probe_of_lbj_aide_156058.htm 'Gay' Probe of LBJ Aide] by Washington [[Associated Press]] at [[NY Post]] newspaper February 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoover maintained strong support in Congress until his death at his Washington, D.C., home on May 2, 1972, from a heart attack attributed to cardio-vascular disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytobit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first= Fred P.|last=Graham|title=J.

Operational command of the Bureau passed to Associate Director [[Clyde Tolson]]. On May 3, Nixon appointed [[L. Patrick Gray]], a [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] official with no FBI experience, as Acting Director, with [[W. Mark Felt]] remaining as Associate Director.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10B16F63F5E127A93C6A9178ED85F468785F9&amp; &quot;Nixon Names Aide as Chief of FBI until Elections,&quot; May 4, 1972], accessed February 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Hoover was a consultant to [[Warner Bros.]] for a 1959 theatrical film about the FBI, ''[[The FBI Story]]'', and in 1965 on Warner Bros.' long-running spin-off television series, ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'' Hoover personally made sure that Warner Bros. would portray the FBI more favorably than other crime dramas of the times.

In 1979, there was a large increase in conflict in the House Select Committee on Assassinations (HSCA) under [[Richard Schweiker|Senator Richard Schweiker]], which had re-opened the investigation into the assassination of President Kennedy, reported that Hoover's FBI &quot;failed to investigate adequately the possibility of a conspiracy to assassinate the President&quot;. The HSCA further reported that Hoover's FBI &quot;was deficient in its sharing of information with other agencies and departments&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/summary.html |title=HCSA Conclusions, 1979 |publisher=Archives.gov |date= |accessdate=January 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Hoover's actions came to be seen as an abuse of power, FBI directors are now limited to one 10-year term,&lt;ref&gt;{{USStatute|94|503|90|2427}}, {{USC2|28|432|In note: Confirmation and Compensation of Director; Term of Service}}&lt;/ref&gt; subject to extension by the [[United States Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-07-26/politics/obama.mueller.term_1_obama-signs-mueller-s-fbi-fbi-director-robert-mueller?_s=PM:POLITICS|agency=CNN|title=Obama signs 2-year extension to Mueller's FBI tenure|date=July 26, 2011|accessdate=November 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[J. Edgar Hoover Building|FBI Headquarters]] in Washington, DC is named after Hoover. Because of the controversial nature of Hoover's legacy, there have been periodic proposals to rename it by legislation proposed by both Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate. In 2001, Senator [[Harry Reid]] sponsored an amendment to strip Hoover's name from the building. &quot;J. Edgar Hoover's name on the FBI building is a stain on the building&quot;, Reid said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Since the 1940s, rumors have circulated that Hoover was [[gay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Terry |first = Jennifer |title = An American Obsession: Science, Medicine, and Homosexuality in Modern Society |publisher = University of Chicago Press |year = 1999 |page = 350 |isbn = 0-226-79366-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historians John Stuart Cox and Athan G.

Hoover hunted down and threatened anyone who made insinuations about his [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]].&lt;ref name=&quot;R000320&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title=J. Edgar Hoover: Gay marriage role model?|date=|publisher=|url =http://www.salon.com/health/sex/urge/world/2000/01/05/hoover/ |work =[[Salon.com|Salon]]|accessdate =November 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also spread unsubstantiated rumors that [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] was gay to damage the [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]] governor's 1952 presidential campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;R000320&quot; /&gt; His extensive secret files contained [[surveillance]] material on [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]'s alleged [[lesbian]] lovers, speculated to be acquired for the purpose of [[blackmail]], as well as material on presidents' liaisons, including those of [[John F.

Hoover described Tolson as his [[alter ego]]: the men worked closely together during the day and, both single, frequently took meals, went to night clubs and vacationed together.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cox, John Stuart and Theoharis, Athan G. 1988 pg. 108&quot; /&gt; This closeness between the two men is often cited as evidence that they were lovers, though some FBI employees who knew them, such as [[W. Mark Felt]], say that the relationship was “brotherly”.  The former FBI official Mike Mason suggested that some of Hoover's colleagues denied that he had a sexual relationship with Tolson in an effort to protect his image.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document| url = http://www.aolnews.com/2011/01/09/movie-depicting-j-edgar-hoover-gay-affair-rankles-some-in-fbi/ | publisher = AOL | title = News | date = 2011-1-9 | article = Movie depicting J Edgar Hoover gay affair rankles some in FBI }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoover bequeathed his estate to Tolson, who moved into the house. He accepted the [[American flag]] that draped Hoover's casket. Tolson is buried a few yards away from Hoover in the [[Congressional Cemetery]].

Hoover's biographer [[Richard Hack]] does not believe that the director was gay. Hack notes that Hoover was romantically linked to actress [[Dorothy Lamour]] in the late 1930s and early 1940s, and that after Hoover's death, Lamour did not deny rumors that she had had an affair with Hoover in the years between her two marriages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hack, Richard 2007&quot;&gt;Hack, Richard ''Puppetmaster: The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover''. (2007). Phoenix Books. ISBN 1-59777-512-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Hack reported that, during the 1940s and 1950s, Hoover so often attended social events with Lela Rogers, the divorced mother of dancer and actress [[Ginger Rogers]], that many of their mutual friends assumed the pair would eventually marry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hack, Richard 2007&quot; /&gt;

In his 1993 biography ''Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J. Edgar Hoover'', the journalist [[Anthony Summers]] quoted &quot;society divorcee&quot; Susan Rosenstiel as claiming to have seen Hoover engaging in [[cross-dressing]] in the 1950s at homosexual parties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Summers1993&quot; /&gt;{{Rp | needed = yes |date= 2012|date=February 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first =Christopher|last=Lehmann-Haupt |authorlink=Christopher Lehmann-Haupt|title= Books of The Times; Catalogue of Accusations Against J.

Summers also said that the Mafia had [[blackmail]] material on Hoover, which made Hoover reluctant to aggressively pursue organized crime. Although never corroborated, the allegation of cross-dressing has been widely repeated. In the words of author Thomas Doherty, &quot;For American popular culture, the image of the [[zaftig]] FBI director as a [[Christine Jorgensen]] wanna-be was too delicious not to savor”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Doherty |first = Thomas |title = Cold War, Cool Medium: Television, McCarthyism, and American Culture |publisher = Columbia University Press |year = 2003 |page = 255 |isbn = 0-231-12952-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Skeptics of the cross-dressing story point to Susan Rosenstiel's poor credibility (she pled guilty for attempted perjury in a 1971 case and later served time in a New York City jail).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Summers | first =Anthony |title=Official and Confidential: The Secret Life of J.

The attorney [[Roy Cohn]], an associate of Hoover during the 1950s investigations of [[Communist]]s and known to be a [[closeted]] homosexual, opined that Hoover was too frightened of his own sexuality to have anything approaching a normal sexual or romantic relationship.&lt;ref name = &quot;Hack, 2007&quot; /&gt; In his 2004 study of the [[Lavender Scare]], the historian David K. Johnson attacked the speculations about Hoover's homosexuality as relying on &quot;the kind of tactics Hoover and the security program he oversaw perfected – guilt by association, rumor, and unverified gossip”. He views Rosenstiel as a liar who was paid for her story, whose &quot;description of Hoover in drag engaging in sex with young blond boys in leather while desecrating the Bible is clearly a [[homophobia|homophobic]] fantasy”. He believes only those who have forgotten the virulence of the decades-long campaign against homosexuals in government can believe reports that Hoover appear in compromising situations.&lt;ref&gt;David K Johnson, ''The Lavender Scare: The Cold War Persecution of Gays and Lesbians in the Federal Government'' (University of Chicago Press, 2004), 11–13&lt;/ref&gt;

The novelist [[William Styron]] told Summers that he once saw Hoover and Tolson in a California beach house, where the director was painting his friend's toenails.&lt;ref name=&quot;iuobq&quot; /&gt; Harry Hay, founder of the [[Mattachine Society]], one of the first gay rights organizations, said that Hoover and Tolson sat in boxes owned by and used exclusively by gay men at the Del Mar racetrack in California.&lt;ref name=&quot;iuobq&quot; /&gt; One medical expert told Summers that Hoover was of &quot;strongly predominant homosexual orientation&quot;, while another medical expert categorized him as a &quot;bisexual with failed heterosexuality”.&lt;ref name=&quot;uoboqnv&quot; /&gt;

==Freemasonry==
Hoover was a devoted [[Freemasonry|Freemason]], being raised a [[Master Mason]] on 9&amp;nbsp;November 1920, in Federal Lodge No.&amp;nbsp;1, Washington, DC, just two months before his 26th birthday. During his 52&amp;nbsp;years with the Masons, he received many medals, awards and decorations. Eventually in 1955, he was coroneted a [[Degree (freemasonry)#Degrees|Thirty-Third Degree]] [[33rd Degree Freemason|Inspector General Honorary]] in the [[Scottish Rite#Southern Jurisdiction|Southern Scottish Rite Jurisdiction]].
