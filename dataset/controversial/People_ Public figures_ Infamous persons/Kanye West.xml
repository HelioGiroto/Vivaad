His style of production originally used pitched-up vocal samples from [[Soul music|soul]] songs incorporated with his own drums and instruments. However, subsequent productions saw him broadening his musical palette and expressing influences encompassing '70s [[R&amp;B]], [[baroque pop]], [[trip hop]], [[arena rock]], [[folk music|folk]], [[alternative rock|alternative]], [[electronica]], [[synthpop]], and classical music.&lt;ref name=Praise&gt;{{cite journal|author=Scaggs, Austin|title=Kanye West: A Genius In Praise of Himself |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/16257550/kanye_west_a_genius_in_praise_of_himself/print|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090309060656/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/16257550/kanye_west_a_genius_in_praise_of_himself/print|archivedate=2009-03-09|title=Kanye West: A Genius In Praise of Himself|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=[[Jann S.

West attended art classes at the [[American Academy of Art]] in Chicago, and also enrolled at [[Chicago State University]], but dropped out to focus on his music career.&lt;ref name=&quot;education&quot; /&gt; While attending school, West produced for local artists.

== Music career ==
=== 1996–2003: Career beginnings ===
Kanye West's first career productions came on Chicago rapper Grav's 1996 debut album ''Down to Earth''. West produced eight tracks on the album. While the album did not attract much attention and would be the only album released by Grav, West would soon be producing for higher profile artists. In 1998–1999 he produced for well-known artists such as [[Jermaine Dupri]], [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]], [[Goodie Mob]], and the group [[Harlem World (group)|Harlem World]].

West got his big break in the year 2000, when he began to produce for artists on [[Roc-a-Fella Records]]. He produced the well-received [[Jay-Z]] song &quot;This Can't Be Life&quot; off of the album ''[[The Dynasty: Roc La Familia]]''. West would later state that to create the beat for &quot;This Can't Be Life&quot;, he sped up the drum beat from [[Dr. Dre]]'s song &quot;Xxplosive&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;last call&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohhla.com/anonymous/kan_west/college/lastcall.wst.txt|title=Artist: Kanye West Album: The College Dropout Song: Last Call|accessdate=June 7, 2007|publisher=The Original Hip-Hop Lyrics Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After producing for Jay-Z earlier, West’s sound was featured heavily on Jay-Z's critically acclaimed album ''[[The Blueprint]]'', released September 11, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;king&quot; /&gt; His work was featured on the lead single &quot;[[Izzo (H.O.V.A.)]]&quot;, &quot;Heart of the City (Ain't No Love)&quot; and a [[wikt:diss song|diss track]] against [[Nas]] and [[Mobb Deep]] named &quot;[[Takeover (song)|Takeover]]&quot;; West has worked with Mobb Deep and Nas since the track's release.&lt;ref name=&quot;king&quot; /&gt;

After meeting great commercial success and critical acclaim for his productions on ''The Blueprint'', West became a sought after producer in the hip-hop industry, even before he became known as a rapper and solo artist. In the years 2002–2003 he would produce for artists such as [[Nas]], [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]], [[Talib Kweli]], [[Mos Def]], [[T.I.]], [[Ludacris]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], and [[Monica (entertainer)|Monica]]. He also continued producing for [[Roc-a-Fella Records]] artists and contributed four tracks to [[Jay-Z]]'s follow up album to ''The Blueprint'', ''[[The Blueprint²: The Gift &amp; the Curse]]''.

After great successes as a producer, West now looked to pursue a career as a rapper and solo artist, but struggled to get a record deal. [[Chris Anokute]], then A&amp;R at Def Jam, said that when West regularly dropped by the office to pick up his producer checks he would play demos of solo material to Anokute in his cubicle and bemoan the fact that no one was taking him seriously as a rapper.&lt;ref name=&quot;hitquarters.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_Chris_Anokute_Interview.html |title=Interview With Chris Anokute |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=Oct 18, 2010 |accessdate=Oct 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jay-Z admitted that [[Roc-A-Fella Records|Roc-A-Fella]] was initially reluctant to support West as a rapper, claiming that he saw him as a producer first and foremost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=April 27, 2008|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-33426663_ITM|title=Kanye west: the man, the music, and the message.(Biography)|publisher=The Black Collegian|date=October 1, 2007|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=February 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple record companies felt he was not as marketable as rappers who portray the &quot;street image&quot; prominent in hip hop culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;last call&quot; /&gt; Beginning his career as a rapper, Kanye West recorded the third verse on the song &quot;The Bounce&quot; off of Jay-Z's ''[[The Blueprint²: The Gift &amp; the Curse]]'', an album he produced for, from the same label he was signed to as a rapper.

=== 2004–06: ''The College Dropout'' and ''Late Registration'' ===
On October 23, 2002, West was involved in a near fatal car crash while driving from a recording studio in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rosenthal|first1=Eric|last2=Rosenthal|first2=Jeff|date=July 5, 2012|url=http://www.billboard.com/column/the-juice/kanye-west-s-20-best-lyrics-about-cars-1007490752.story?page=2#|title=Kanye West's 20 Best Lyrics About Cars|work=Billboard|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media]]|accessdate=August 22, 2012|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|date=October 23, 2002|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1458308/kanye-west-injured-accident.jhtml|title=Kanye West Injured In L.A.

These songs were featured on West's debut album, ''[[The College Dropout]]'', which was released on [[Roc-A-Fella Records]] in February 2004, and went on to receive critical acclaim. The album also defined the style for which West would become known, including wordplay and [[Sampling (music)|sampling]].&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot;/&gt; The album was eventually certified triple platinum. Guest appearances included [[Jay-Z]], [[Ludacris]], [[GLC (rapper)|GLC]], [[Consequence (rapper)|Consequence]], [[Talib Kweli]], [[Mos Def]], [[Common (entertainer)|Common]], and [[Syleena Johnson]]. The album also featured the singles, &quot;[[All Falls Down]]&quot; and &quot;[[The New Workout Plan]]&quot;, as well as Twista's number one single, &quot;[[Slow Jamz]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 24, 2008|url=http://www.calgarysun.com/cgi-bin/publish.cgi?p=92360&amp;x=articles&amp;s=showbiz|title=Grand Kanye |work=[[Calgary Sun]]}}{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2003 West also co-produced songs for British singer [[Javine Hylton]], even appearing in the music video to [[Real Things (song)|Real Things]] playing the love interest of Javine.

West was involved in a financial dispute over [[Royce Da 5'9&quot;]]'s song &quot;Heartbeat&quot;, produced by West and released on ''Build &amp; Destroy: The Lost Sessions''. West maintains that Royce never paid for the beat, but recorded to it and released it; hearing him on the beat, the original customers decided not to buy it from West. After the disagreement, West vowed to never work with Royce again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hiphopsite.com/NEWS/interviews.hhs?news_id=FEA3B39B-C571-4ACB-A096-6600549EA18B|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070915010416/http://www.hiphopsite.com/NEWS/interviews.hhs?news_id=FEA3B39B-C571-4ACB-A096-6600549EA18B|archivedate=September 15, 2007|title=Kanye West Speaks Through The Wire|accessdate=June 7, 2007|publisher=HipHopSite}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Kanye West-produced hit singles during the period ''The College Dropout'' was released included &quot;[[I Changed My Mind]]&quot; by [[Keyshia Cole]], &quot;[[Overnight Celebrity]]&quot; by [[Twista]] and &quot;[[Talk About Our Love]]&quot; by [[Brandy Norwood|Brandy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot;/&gt;

On August 22, 2005, the MTV special ''All Eyes On Kanye West'' aired, in which West spoke out against [[homophobia]] in hip-hop. He claimed that hip-hop has always been about &quot;speaking your mind and about breaking down barriers, but everyone in hip-hop discriminates against [[homosexuality|gay people]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;just&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 24, 2008|url=http://media.www.gwhatchet.com/media/storage/paper332/news/2005/09/08/Opinions/Column.More.Than.Just.A.Rapper-978469.shtml|title=Column: More than just a rapper |work=[[GW Hatchet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then reflected on a personal experience. He said that he had a &quot;turning point&quot; when he realized one of his cousins was gay. He said regarding this experience: &quot;This is my cousin. I love him and I've been discriminating against gays.&quot; He drew comparison between African Americans' struggle for [[civil rights]] and today's [[LGBT rights in the United States|gay rights]] movement. The following year, in an interview with ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', West further expounded his experiences with and views on the relationship between the black and gay communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Entertainment Weekly|date=October 2007|title=Kanye West}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, it was announced that West would be starring in a series directed by [[Larry Charles]]. He has been working on the pilot episode for the past two years with Larry Charles and [[Rick Rubin]]. He also had this to say on January 14:
&quot;I wouldn't do something as cliché as a reality show. At least give me the credit for being more creative than that. It's a situational half-hour comedy.

Further to this, during a radio appearance in early 2007, West, like many of his peers, recorded an impromptu freestyle to the popular song &quot;Throw Some D's.&quot; The song that to all other rappers was about automobile rims, was used by West to comically refer to D-cup breasts. Because of the unexpected success of the song, West went on to make a video for the freestyle, in which he is seen playing his 'Old Ass Cousin'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 24, 2008|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2007/05/29/kanye-west-loves-rolling-stone-sort-of/|title=Kanye West Loves Rolling Stone.

West was also featured in a new song called &quot;Classic (Better Than I've Ever Been)&quot;. It was believed to be a single for, ''[[Graduation (album)|Graduation]]'', because he is featured on the track, but [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] quickly explained that it was for the Nike [[Air Force 1 (shoe)|Air Force 1's]] anniversary.

West kicked off the [[Glow in the Dark Tour]] in Seattle at the [[Key Arena]] on April 16. The tour was originally scheduled to end in June in [[Cincinnati]] but was extended into August. Over the course of the tour West was joined by a varying group of opening acts, including [[Lupe Fiasco]], [[Rihanna]], [[N.E.R.D.]], [[DJ Craze]], and [[Gnarls Barkley]]. On June 15, West was scheduled to perform a late night set at the [[Bonnaroo Music Festival]]. His performance started almost two hours late and ran for half of its alloted time, angering many fans in the audience. West later wrote an outraged entry on his blog, blaming the festival organizers as well as [[Pearl Jam]]'s preceding set, which ran longer than expected.

On September 7, West debuted a new song &quot;[[Love Lockdown]]&quot; at the [[2008 MTV Video Music Awards]]. &quot;Love Lockdown&quot; features no rapping and only singing using an [[auto-tune]] device. This song appears on West's fourth studio album, ''[[808s &amp; Heartbreak]]''. The new album was expected to be released on December 16, but West announced on his blog on September 24, 2008, that he had finished the album and would be releasing it sometime in November, earlier than previously scheduled. In early October, West made a surprise appearance at a [[T.I.]] concert in Los Angeles, where he stated that ''808s &amp; Heartbreak'' was scheduled to be released on November 25, though it was actually released on the 24th, and that the second single is &quot;[[Heartless (Kanye West song)|Heartless]]&quot;. The album was another number one album for West, even though the first week numbers fell well short of ''Graduation'' with 450,145 sold.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.8192 HipHopDX.com – Hip Hop Album Sales].

It is focused on helping Latino and African American children stay in school and continue education through grade school, high school, and college. The foundation also helps children pursue music in school. West has contributed over $500,000 to his foundation. The foundation has also been called the &quot;Donda West Foundation&quot;.

Kanye West has appeared and participated in many fundraisers, benefit concerts, and has done community work for [[Hurricane Katrina]] relief, the Kanye West Foundation, the [[Millions More Movement]], [[100 Black Men of America]], a [[Live Earth]] concert benefit, [[World Water Day]] rally and march, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] runs, and a MTV special helping young [[Iraq War]] veterans who struggle through debt and [[PTSD]] a second chance after returning home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stelter |first=Brian|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/28/arts/television/28mtv.html?partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all |title=In 'Homecoming' MTV Focuses On Iraq Veterans |work=The New York Times|date=July 28, 2008|accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistry ==
[[File:Kanye West in the Studio.jpg|thumb|260px|left|West working in the studio with his mentor [[No I.D.]] (left)]]
At the start of his career, Kanye West's production style often used pitched-up vocal samples, usually from [[soul music|soul]] songs, with his own drums and instruments.&lt;ref name=&quot;king&quot;&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=April 26, 2008|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/kanye-west-king-of-rap-403127.html|title=Kanye West: King of rap|work=The Independent|location=UK |date=September 22, 2007|author=Burrell, Ian }}&lt;/ref&gt; His first major release featuring his trademark vocal sampling style was &quot;This Can't Be Life&quot;, a track from Jay-Z’s ''[[The Dynasty: Roc La Familia]]''. West said he sped up the drum beat of [[Dr. Dre]]'s &quot;Xxplosive&quot; to use as a replacement for his drums on &quot;This Can't Be Life&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;last call&quot;/&gt;

West has said that [[Wu-Tang Clan]] producer [[RZA]] influenced him in his style,&lt;ref name=&quot;cant ignore&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KWstBio2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gale.com/free_resources/bhm/bio/west_k.htm|title=Black History&amp;nbsp;— Biographies&amp;nbsp;— Kanye West|accessdate=August 7, 2006|publisher=[[Thomson Gale]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has said on numerous occasions that Wu-Tang rappers [[Ghostface Killah]] and [[Ol' Dirty Bastard]] were some of his all-time favorites, &quot;Wu-Tang? Me and my friends talk about this all the time... We think Wu-Tang had one of the biggest impacts as far as a movement. From slang to style of dress, skits, the samples. Similar to the [production] style I use, RZA has been doing that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;KWstBio4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1553911/20070305/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye, Run-DMC, Outkast, Justin Sound Off On Our Top 10 Hip-Hop Groups|accessdate=June 7, 2007|publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[RZA]] himself has spoken quite positively of the comparisons, stating in an interview for ''Rolling Stone'', &quot;All good. I got super respect for Kanye. He came up to me about a year or two ago. He gave me mad praising and blessings... For people to say Wu-Tang inspire Kanye, Kanye is one of the biggest artists in the world. That goes back to what we say: 'Wu-Tang is forever.' Kanye is going to inspire people to be like him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RZArs&quot;/&gt; After hearing his work on ''[[The Blueprint]]'', RZA claimed that a torch-passing had occurred between him and West, saying, &quot;The shoes gotta be filled. If you ain't gonna do it, somebody else is gonna do it. That's how I feel about rap today.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RZArs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Dukes, Rahman; Reid, Shaheem|title=The Clipse Hint At Kanye West Collabo: Mixtape Monday|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1602920/20090116/story.jhtml|work=Rolling Stone |publisher=RealNetworks, Inc |date=January 19, 2009 |accessdate=January 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:West performing.jpg|thumb|260px|West accompanied by an 11-piece chamber orchestra]]
While his use of sampling has lessened over time, West's production continues to feature distinctive and intricate [[string arrangement]]s. This characteristic arose from him listening to the English [[trip hop]] group [[Portishead (band)|Portishead]], whose 1998 live album ''[[Roseland NYC Live]]'', with the [[New York Philharmonic Orchestra]] inspired him to incorporate [[string section]]s into his [[hip hop production]].&lt;ref name=Praise/&gt; Though he was unable to afford live instruments beyond violin riffs provided by [[Israeli Jews|Israeli]] violinist [[Miri Ben-Ari]] around the time of his debut album, its subsequent commercial success allowed him to hire his very own eleven-piece [[string orchestra]]. For a time, West stood as the sole current pop star to tour with a string section.&lt;ref name=Praise/&gt;

West has stated on several occasions that outside of work, he favors listening to rock music over hip-hop. He cites [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], and [[The Killers]] as some of his favorite musical groups. Additionally, on ''Graduation'', West drew inspiration from [[arena rock]] bands such as [[U2]], [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Led Zeppelin]] for [[melody]] and [[chord progression]].&lt;ref name=Crosely&gt;{{cite web |author=Crosley, Hillary|title=Graduation|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/content_display/reviews/albums/e3ibe8ec7c980d6765c46225c438690a813|work=Billboard |date=September 15, 2007|accessdate=September 15, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071014192400/http://billboard.com/bbcom/content_display/reviews/albums/e3ibe8ec7c980d6765c46225c438690a813 |archivedate = October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both a fan and supporter of [[indie culture]], West uses his official website to promote obscure [[indie rock]] bands, posting up music videos and mp3s on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=West, Kanye | title= Dirty Projectors &quot;Stillness is the Move&quot;| url=http://www.kanyeuniversecity.com/blog/?em3106=235958_-1__0_~-1_-1_05_2008_0_0&amp;em3298=&amp;em3282=&amp;em3281=&amp;em3161=| work=Kanye West Blog | publisher=Kanye West/Mascotte Holdings, LLC | date=July 1, 2009 | accessdate=July 1, 2009}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This musical affinity is mutual, as West has collaborated with indie artists such as [[Santigold]], [[Peter Bjorn and John]], and [[Lykke Li]] while his songs have gone on to be covered countless times by myriad rock bands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=West, Kanye|title=The Fray – &quot;Heartless&quot;|url=http://www.kanyeuniversecity.com/blog/?em3106=238431_-1__0_~0_-1_8_2009_0_0&amp;em3298=&amp;em3282=&amp;em3281=&amp;em3161=|work=Kanye West Blog|publisher=Kanye West/Mascotte Holdings, LLC|date=August 15, 2009 | accessdate=August 15, 2009}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Relationships ===
Kanye West and designer Alexis Phifer ended their 18-month engagement in 2008. The couple had been dating on and off since 2002, with West eventually proposing in August 2006. According to a friend, the couple's relationship had become increasingly strained, burdened by the sheer amount of time and attention West was dedicating to his current concert tour. &quot;It's always sad when things like this end, and we remain friends,&quot; Phifer told ''[[People magazine|People]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1585980/20080421/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West's Ex-Fiancee Alexis Phifer Talks About Breakup|date=April 21, 2008|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=September 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal issues ===
In December 2006, [[Evel Knievel|Robert &quot;Evel&quot; Knievel]] sued West for trademark infringement in West's video for &quot;[[Touch the Sky]].&quot; Knievel took issue with a &quot;sexually charged video&quot; in which West takes on the persona of &quot;Evel Kanyevel&quot; and attempts flying a rocket over a canyon. The suit filed in federal court claims infringement on his trademarked name and likeness. Knievel also claims the &quot;vulgar and offensive&quot; images depicted in the video damage his reputation. The suit seeks damages and to stop distribution of the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/1212061evel1.html|title=Evel Knievel Sues Kanye West|accessdate=June 7, 2007|publisher=[[The Smoking Gun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; West's attorneys argued that the music video amounted to satire and therefore was covered under the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]. Just days before his death in November 2007, Knievel amicably settled the suit after being paid a visit from West, saying, &quot;I thought he was a wonderful guy and quite a gentleman.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Evel Knievel, Kanye West settle lawsuit| url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2007-11-27-kanye-knievel_N.htm|work=USA Today| publisher=[[Gannett Co.

On September 11, 2008, West and his road manager/bodyguard Don &quot;Don C.&quot; Crowley were arrested at [[Los Angeles International Airport]] and booked on charges of felony vandalism after an altercation with the [[paparazzi]] in which West and Crowley broke the photographers' cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/Music/09/11/kanye.west.arrested/index.html|title=Kanye West arrested after skirmish at airport|date=September 11, 2008|publisher=CNN |accessdate=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/arrests/kanye-west-bodyguard-arrested-at-los-angeles-international-airport_article_11207|title=Kanye West, Bodyguard Arrested At LAX|date=September 11, 2008|publisher=Access Hollywood|accessdate=March 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; West was later released from the [[Los Angeles Police Department#Pacific Division|Los Angeles Police Department's Pacific Division]] station in [[Culver City]] on $20,000 bail bond.

He was later released &quot;with no further action&quot;, according to a police spokesperson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1599323/20081114/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West Arrested After Alleged Tussle With Photographer, Then Cleared|date=November 14, 2008|accessdate=November 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversies ==
=== General media ===
West has had several controversies throughout his career. On September 2, 2005, during a benefit concert for [[Hurricane Katrina]] relief on NBC, [[A Concert for Hurricane Relief]], West was a featured speaker. When West was presenting alongside actor [[Mike Myers (actor)|Mike Myers]], he deviated from the prepared script. Myers spoke next and continued to read the script. Once it was West's turn to speak again, he said &quot;[[George W. Bush|George Bush]] doesn't care about black people.&quot; At this point, telethon producer Rick Kaplan cut off the microphone and then cut away to [[Chris Tucker]], who was unaware of the cut for a few seconds. Still, West's comment reached much of the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=44415a2b-7481-45f8-91a3-630b0b5510de&amp;entry=index|title=NBC KO's Kanye's Bush Bashing|last=Byrne|first=Bridget|work=E!

Retrieved November 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2006, West again sparked controversy when he appeared on the cover of ''Rolling Stone'' in the image of Jesus wearing a crown of thorns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 27, 2008|url=http://www.jamaica-gleaner.com/gleaner/20060126/ent/ent3.html|title= Kanye West poses as Jesus on cover of 'Rolling Stone' |publisher=[[Gleaner Company|Gleaner]]|date=January 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November, 2010, in a taped interview with [[Matt Lauer]] for the [[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]], West expressed regret for his criticism of Bush. &quot;I would tell George Bush in my moment of frustration, I didn't have the grounds to call him a racist,&quot; he told Lauer. &quot;I believe that in a situation of high emotion like that we as human beings don't always choose the right words.&quot;  The following day, Bush reacted to the apology in a live interview with Lauer saying he appreciated the rapper's remorse. &quot;I'm not a hater,&quot; Bush said. &quot;I don't hate Kanye West. I was talking about an environment in which people were willing to say things that hurt. Nobody wants to be called a racist if in your heart you believe in equality of races.&quot;

Reactions were mixed, but some felt that West had no need to apologize. &quot;It was not the particulars of your words that mattered, it was the essence of a feeling of the insensitivity towards our communities that many of us have felt for far too long,&quot; noted [[Def Jam]] co-founder [[Russell Simmons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=February 9, 2011|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/russell-simmons/dear-kanye-west_b_782932.html|title= Dear Kanye West... |work=Huffington Post |location=USA|date=November 12, 2010|first=Russell|last=Simmons}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boyce Watkins|Dr. Boyce Watkins]] said that West was, &quot;now part of the establishment, where waffling on your principles is fully expected.

You know, I appreciate that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=November 11, 2010|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b210484_george_w_bush_cares_about_kanye_wests.html|title= George W.

=== Award shows ===
In 2004, West had his first of a number of incidents involving music award events. At the [[American Music Awards of 2004]], West stormed out of the auditorium after losing Best New Artist to country singer [[Gretchen Wilson]]. He later commented, &quot;I felt like I was definitely robbed [...] I was the best new artist this year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=June 6, 2011|url=http://www.people.com/people/package/article/0,,20302940_20304330,00.html|title=Kanye West's Bad Behavior: A Short History|work=[[People (magazine)|People]] | date=September 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2006 Grammy nominations were released, West said he would &quot;really have a problem&quot; if he did not win the Album of the Year, saying, &quot;I don't care what I do, I don't care how much I stunt – you can never take away from the amount of work I put into it.

On September 9, 2007, West suggested that his [[race (classification of human beings)|race]] had to do with his being overlooked for opening the [[2007 MTV Video Music Awards]] (VMAs) in favor of [[Britney Spears]]; he claimed, &quot;Maybe my skin’s not right.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 24, 2008|url=http://www.britneyspy.com/2007/09/09/kanye-west-jealous-of-britney-opening-the-vmas/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080424051758/http://www.britneyspy.com/2007/09/09/kanye-west-jealous-of-britney-opening-the-vmas/|archivedate=April 24, 2008|title=Kanye West Jealous Of Britney Opening The VMAs|publisher=Britney Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt; West was performing at the event; that night, he lost all 5 awards that he was nominated for, including Best Male Artist and Video of the Year. After the show, he was visibly upset that he had lost at the VMAs two years in a row, stating that he would not come back to MTV ever again. He also appeared on several radio stations saying that when he made the song &quot;Stronger&quot; that it was his dream to open the VMAs with it. He has also stated that Spears has not had a hit in a long period of time and that MTV exploited her for ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 24, 2008|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1569313/20070910/west_kanye.jhtml|title=Kanye West Loses It Again, Says He'll 'Never Return To MTV': Report|publisher=[[MTV News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy and influence ==
{{Quote box
 |quote = West was as interesting and complicated a pop star as the 2000s produced—a rapper who mastered, upped and moved beyond the hip-hop game, a producer who created a signature sound and then abandoned it to his imitators, a flashy, free-spending sybarite with insightful things to say about college, culture and economics, an egomaniac with more than enough artistic firepower to back it up. Instead of adapting to the mainstream, the [[Louis Vitton]] Don reshaped it, establishing a style of introspective yet glossy rap on ''[[The College Dropout]]'' and ''[[Late Registration]]'', two of the decade's best records.

An outspoken and controversial celebrity, West frequently spoke out against homophobia in hip hop music, posed as [[Jesus Christ]] for the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and accused President [[George W. Bush]] of not &quot;car[ing] about black people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot;/&gt; His dapper and flamboyant fashion sense also attracted media attention and set West apart from other rappers.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot;/&gt; [[Allmusic]] editor Jason Birchmeier writes of his impact, &quot;As his career progressed throughout the early 21st century, West shattered certain stereotypes about rappers, becoming a superstar on his own terms without adapting his appearance, his rhetoric, or his music to fit any one musical mold.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot;/&gt; 

Although it was polarizing for listeners and critics, West's 2008 album ''808s &amp; Heartbreak'' was commercial successful and impacted hip hop stylistically,&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot;/&gt; laying the groundwork for a new wave of hip hop artists who generally eschewed typical rap braggadocio for intimate subject matter and introspection, including [[B.o.B]], Kid Cudi, [[Frank Ocean]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sterling|first=Scott|url=http://www.scpr.org/blogs/newmedia/2011/11/18/3830/live-review-frank-ocean-reveals-softer-side-odd-fu/|title=Concert review: Frank Ocean reveals the softer side of Odd Future|publisher=[[KPCC|89.3 KPCC]].
