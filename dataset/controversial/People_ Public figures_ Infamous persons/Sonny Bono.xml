'''Salvatore Phillip''' &quot;'''Sonny'''&quot; '''Bono''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|n|oʊ}}; February 16, 1935 – January 5, 1998) was an [[United States|American]] [[recording artist]], [[record producer]], [[actor]], and [[politician]] whose career spanned over three decades.

==Early life==
Sonny Bono was born in [[Detroit]] to [[Italian American|Italian immigrants]] Santo Bono (born in [[Montelepre]], [[Palermo]], [[Italy]]) and Zena &quot;Jean&quot; La Valle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800057596/bio|title=Sonny Bono Biography|publisher=Yahoo! Movies|accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonny was the youngest of three siblings; he had two older sisters, Fran and Betty. Bono attended [[Inglewood High School (California)|Inglewood High School]] in [[Inglewood, California]], but did not graduate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jan/07/news/mn-5814|title=Sonny Bono, a Chronology|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=1998-01-07|accessdate=2009-10-08|first=Nona|last=Yates}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{which?|date=November 2010}}

==Career==
===Entertainment career===
{{See also|Sonny &amp; Cher}}
Bono began his music career working at [[Specialty Records]] where his song &quot;Things You Do to Me&quot; was recorded by [[Sam Cooke]], and went on to work for the record producer [[Phil Spector]] in the early 1960s as a promotion man, percussionist and &quot;[[gofer]]&quot;. One of his earliest songwriting efforts was &quot;[[Needles and Pins (song)|Needles and Pins]]&quot; which he co-wrote with [[Jack Nitzsche]], another member of Spector's production team. Later in the same decade, he achieved commercial success, along with his then-wife [[Cher]], as part of the singing duo [[Sonny and Cher]]. Bono wrote, arranged, and produced a number of hit records with singles like &quot;[[I Got You Babe]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Beat Goes On]]&quot;, although Cher received more attention as a performer. He also played a major part in Cher's early solo career with recordings such as &quot;[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)|Bang Bang]]&quot; and &quot;[[You Better Sit Down Kids]]&quot;.

Bono also recorded as a solo artist under the name of Sonny. He had only one hit single as a solo artist, &quot;[[Laugh At Me]]&quot;. &quot;Laugh At Me&quot; was released in 1965 and peaked at #10 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. In live concerts, Bono would sing the song with an introduction of, &quot;I'd like to sing a medley of my hit.&quot; His only other single as a solo artist was a follow-up release, &quot;The Revolution Kind&quot;, which reached number 70 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 later that same year. Bono also recorded an unsuccessful Sonny album titled ''[[Inner Views]]'' in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhinohandmade.com/browse/ProductLink.lasso?Number=7704|title=Sonny Bono - Inner Views - from Rhino Handmade|publisher=Rhinohandmade.com|accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sonny-Bono.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Sonny Bono in 1966 during a performance]]
Sonny continued to work with Cher through the early and mid-1970s starring in a popular television [[variety show]], ''[[The Sonny and Cher Show]],'' which ran on [[CBS]] from 1971 to 1974. From 1976 to 1977, the couple returned to performing together on ''The Sonny and Cher Show'' despite being divorced. Their last appearance together was on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' on November 13, 1987,&lt;ref name=NM&gt;&quot;Sonny &amp; Cher Boost Ratings&quot;. ''The New Mexican''. Santa Fe, New Mexico. November 29, 1987, p. 35, accessed through [[NewspaperARCHIVE.com]] on March 13, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AS&gt;&quot;Sonny and Cher Reunited on David Letterman Show.&quot; ''Aiken Standard''. Aiken, South Carolina.

Bono continued his acting career, doing bit roles in such shows as ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' and ''[[The Love Boat]]''. He played the part of mad bomber Joe Selucci in ''[[Airplane II: The Sequel]]'' (1982) and in the 1986 horror movie ''[[Troll (film)|Troll]]''. Bono also played the part of Franklin Von Tussle in the 1988 John Waters film ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]''. In the 1997 film ''[[Men in Black (film)|Men In Black]]'', Bono is one of several oddball celebrities seen on a wall of video screens that monitor extraterrestrials living among us. He also appeared in several episodes of ''[[P.S. I Luv U]]'' starring [[Connie Sellecca]] and [[Greg Evigan]] during the 1991-92 TV season as the Mayor of Palm Springs [which he really was at the time]. His last acting role was in the television series ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' (Season 1, Episode 9, originally aired on November 21, 1993), in which he played the Mayor Frank Berkowitz. He also made a minor appearance as himself in the 1996 film ''[[First Kid]]''.

Sonny poked a little fun at himself when he guest-starred on ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', in the episode &quot;Mrs. George Devereaux&quot;, aired November 17, 1990, as himself vying with [[Lyle Waggoner]] for Dorothy's ([[Beatrice Arthur]]) affection in a dream, where Blanche ([[Rue McClanahan]]) dreams her husband is still alive. In the dream, Sonny uses his power as mayor of Palm Springs, California to have Waggoner falsely arrested just so he can have Dorothy to himself. Later on, after Blanche awakens from the dream, Dorothy is thrilled to learn she picked Sonny this time.

===Political career===
{{See also|Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act}}
Bono entered politics after experiencing great frustration with local government bureaucracy in trying to open a restaurant in [[Palm Springs, California]]. With [[conservatism|conservative]] talk radio host [[Marshall Gilbert]] as his campaign manager, Bono placed a successful bid to become the new [[mayor]] of Palm Springs. He served four years (1988 to 1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=B000622|title=BONO, Sonny - Biographical Information| publisher=Bioguide.congress.gov|accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was instrumental in spearheading the creation of the [[Palm Springs International Film Festival]], which is now held each year in Bono's memory.

Bono ran for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nomination for [[United States Senate]] in 1992, but the nomination went to the more conservative [[Bruce Herschensohn]], and the election to the Democrat [[Barbara Boxer]]. Bono and Herschensohn became close friends after the campaign. Bono was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 1994 to represent [[California's 44th congressional district]]. He was one of twelve co-sponsors of a House bill extending [[copyright]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d105:HR02589:|title=Bill Summary &amp; Status - 105th Congress (1997 - 1998) - H.R.2589 - THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date=1998-03-26 |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although that bill was never voted on in the Senate, a similar Senate bill was passed after his death and named the [[Sonny Bono Copyright Term Extension Act]] in his memory.

He championed the restoration of the [[Salton Sea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/EARTH/9801/16/salton.sea/index.html|title=Salton Sea rescue to be named for Sonny Bono|work=CNN|date=1998-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; bringing the giant lake's plight to national attention. [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Newt Gingrich]] made a public appearance and speech at the shore of the lake on Bono's behalf.

In their book ''Tell Newt to Shut Up'', [[David Maraniss]] and [[Michael Weisskopf]] credit Bono with being the first person to recognize Gingrich's public relations problems in 1995. Drawing on his long experience as a celebrity and entertainment producer, Bono (according to Maraniss and Weisskopf) recognized that Gingrich's status had changed from politician to celebrity, and that Gingrich was not making allowances for that change:

{{blockquote|You're a celebrity now, ... The rules are different for celebrities. I know it. I've been there. I've been a celebrity. I used to be a bigger celebrity. But let me tell you, you're not being handled right. This is not political news coverage. This is celebrity status. You need handlers. You need to understand what you're doing. You need to understand the attitude of the media toward celebrities.}}

Bono remains the only member of Congress to have scored a #1 pop single on the US [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart.

Author [[Ronald Kessler]] mentioned Bono in his exposé book ''Inside Congress''. Kessler pointed out that Bono was widely ridiculed and was named one of the &quot;dimmest bulbs&quot; in Congress by ''[[Progressive Magazine]]'' and that ''[[The Washington Post]]'' referred to him as the &quot;idiot savant from way beyond the Beltway&quot;. Kessler also mentioned that a young staffer named Frederique J. Sandretto had accused Bono of sexually harassing her.

==Personal life==
Bono married his first wife, Donna Rankin, on November 3, 1954. Their daughter Christine (&quot;Christy&quot;) was born on June 24, 1958. They divorced in 1962. In 1964 Bono married singer/entertainer [[Cher]]; their daughter [[Chastity Bono]] (now [[Chaz Bono]]) was born on March 4, 1969. In 1975 the couple divorced. Bono then married [[Susie Coelho]], but divorced her in 1984. He wed the much-younger Mary Whitaker in 1986 and they had two children, son Chesare Elan on April 25, 1988 and daughter Chianna Maria on February 2, 1991. He became a [[Scientology|Scientologist]],{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} partly because of the influence of [[Mimi Rogers]], but stated that he was a [[Roman Catholic]] on all official documents, campaign materials, web sites, etc. [[Mary Bono Mack|Mary Bono]] also took [[Scientology]]
courses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rickross.com/reference/scientology/celebrities/celebrities2.html Proud Mary Bono], George, August 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Bono was named a [[godparent]] of [[Anthony Kiedis]] who would go on to become a musical artist with his band, [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]. Sonny was a close friend of Anthony's father, [[Blackie Dammett]], and would often take the boy on weekend trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelfire.com/punk5/englishrhcpgenius/anthony.html |title=Anthony Kiedis |publisher=Angelfire.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/kiedis.-bedroom-joy-with-cher |title=Cher - Kiedis' Bedroom Joy With Cher - Contactmusic News |publisher=Contactmusic.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bono was a champion of the [[Salton Sea]] in southeastern California, where a [[Sonny Bono Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge|park]] was named in his honor. The 2005 [[documentary film]] ''[[Plagues &amp; Pleasures on the Salton Sea]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saltonseadoc.com/|title=Plagues &amp; Pleasures on the Salton Sea| publisher=Saltonseadoc.com|accessdate=2009-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; (narrated by [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]) features Bono and documented the lives of the inhabitants of [[Bombay Beach, California|Bombay Beach]], [[Niland, California|Niland]], and [[Salton City, California|Salton City]], as well as the ecological issues associated with the Sea.

In 1996, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars%20dedicated%20by%20date.pdf Palm Springs Walk of Stars by date dedicated]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:Bono, Sunny (grave).jpg|right|thumb|180px|Sonny Bono's headstone at Desert Memorial Park in [[Cathedral City, California]]. The epitaph reads: &quot;And the Beat Goes On.&quot;]]
Bono died on January 5, 1998 of injuries sustained when he hit a tree while [[skiing]] on the [[Nevada]] side of [[Heavenly Ski Resort]] near [[South Lake Tahoe, California]].&lt;ref name=washpost&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/junkie/links/bono.htm Sonny Bono Is Killed in Ski Crash], [[Washington Post]], 1998-01-07&lt;/ref&gt; His death came just a little less than a week after [[Michael LeMoyne Kennedy|Michael Kennedy]], a son of [[Robert F. Kennedy]], died in a similar skiing accident in [[Aspen, Colorado]]. After Bono's death, Mary told an interviewer from ''[[TV Guide]]'' that Sonny had been addicted to and was seriously abusing prescription drugs, mainly [[Vicodin]] and [[Valium]]. Though Mary claimed that Sonny's drug use caused the accident, the autopsy performed by the [[Douglas County, Nevada|Douglas County]] [[Coroner]] showed no indication of any substances or alcohol.&lt;ref name=washpost /&gt;

Bono was survived by his wife [[Mary Bono Mack|Mary Bono]] and children Christy, Chianna, Chesare, and Chastity. His mother, Jean Bono, also survived him, and died on January 15, 2005 at the age of 90.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=12620247 |title=Jean Bono (1914 - 2005) - Find A Grave Memorial |publisher=Findagrave.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Mary Bono's request, [[Cher]] gave a [[eulogy]] at Sonny's funeral. His remains were buried at [[Desert Memorial Park]] in [[Cathedral City, California]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pscemetery.com/pdfs/interments.pdf Palm Springs Cemetery District &quot;Interment Information&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The epitaph on Bono's headstone reads: &quot;And the Beat Goes On.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|2312|Sony Bono|work=entertainer, US Congressman|author=Julie Karen Hancock (Cooper) Jackson|date=January 01, 2001|accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bono's wife, Mary, was elected to fill the remainder of his Congressional term. Over 10 years after his death, she continues to champion many of Sonny's causes, including the ongoing fight to save the [[Salton Sea]].
