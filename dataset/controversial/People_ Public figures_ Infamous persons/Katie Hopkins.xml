In 2006, Hopkins was selected from over 10,000 people to be one of the final 16 candidates in series three of the reality TV show ''The Apprentice''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/media/article2377690.ece|title=The sweet smell of success: Sugar's 'Apprentice' line-up|accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=The Independent | location=London | first=Geneviève | last=Roberts | date=2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opening episode of the series, broadcast on 28 March 2007, attracted over four million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?Requesttimeout=500&amp;report=weeklyterrestrial|title=Weekly Viewing Summary-Terrestrial Top 30-BBC1-Week ending 01/04/2007|accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=BARB}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received particular media attention owing to her on-screen romantic relationship with fellow candidate Paul Callaghan – the first such relationship to feature on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theinternetforum.co.uk/node/2315|title=Apprentices in love|accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=The Internet Forum}}&lt;/ref&gt; She rejected [[Alan Sugar|Sir Alan Sugar]]'s offer of a place in the final episode of the programme, citing problems regarding [[childcare]] provision for her daughters, and withdrew from the competition at the end of the penultimate task.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=460375&amp;in_page_id=1773|title=Apprentice finalist reveals why she told Sir Alan: YOU'RE fired!|accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=The Daily Mail | location=London | date=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode pulled in 6.2 million viewers, while the following ''[[The Apprentice: You're Fired!|You're Fired]]!'' episode, in which Hopkins was interviewed, was watched by 3.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.guardian.co.uk/overnights/story/0,,2097470,00.html|title=The Apprentice beats Diana show|accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=The Guardian | location=London | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood | date=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In fact, since Hopkins withdrew, she avoided being dismissed with Sugar's [[catch phrase]], &quot;You're fired!&quot;.&lt;ref name='firedep'/&gt;) However, despite her resigning on her own, Sir Alan later said in classic Sugar style that had she not resigned, he would have fired her anyway.

Hopkins was the project manager of her team on ''The Apprentice'' for two tasks, in week two&lt;ref name='episode2'&gt;{{cite episode |title=Doggy Designs |episodelink=The Apprentice (UK Series Three) #Week 2: Doggy Designs |series=The Apprentice Series Three |serieslink=The Apprentice (UK Series Three) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=2007-04-04 |season=3 |number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in week nine.&lt;ref name='episode9'&gt;{{cite episode |title=Feeling the Strain |episodelink=The Apprentice (UK Series Three) #Week 9: Feeling the Strain |series=The Apprentice Series Three |serieslink=The Apprentice (UK Series Three) |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |airdate=2007-05-23 |season=3 |number=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her team won both of these tasks.&lt;ref name='episode2'/&gt;&lt;ref name='episode9'/&gt; She was criticised by Sir Alan Sugar for being a &quot;loser&quot;, due to her being on the losing team frequently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sir Alan's blast to disgraced Apprentice Katie Hopkins: 'You're unemployable!'|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23400566-details/Sir+Alan's+blast+to+disgraced+Apprentice+Katie+Hopkins:+'You're+unemployable!'/article.do |publisher=[[The Evening Standard]] |date=2007-06-14 |accessdate=2008-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; She, however, defended herself by responding that whenever she led, her team won.

===Comments and views===
Hopkins gained notoriety on the programme for her comments toward other contestants. These include calling [[Naomi Lay]] a &quot;dog&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/apprentice/news_030607_naomi4.shtml|title=Naomi: My sex video shame|accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=News of the World}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wishing that fellow contestant [[Adam Hosker]] would get run over at the car salesroom in which he worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/apprentice/news_100507_adam_fired.shtml|title=Sacked Adam turns on rival Katie|accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=News of the World}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins also derided fellow contestant [[Kristina Grimes]] by comparing her to a [[limpet]]&lt;ref name='firedep'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/showbiz/realitytv/other/tm_method=full%26objectid=19030774%26siteid=89520-name_page.html|title=Kat Fight|accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=The Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mocking her fashion sense and use of [[fake tan]].&lt;ref name='bitch'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/showbiz/latest/tm_headline=is-katie-the-biggest-bitch-on-tv-&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=19208874&amp;siteid=89520-name_page.html|title=Is Katie the biggest bitch on TV?|accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=The Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins also accused Grimes of trying to turn ''The Apprentice'' into &quot;The Kristina Show&quot;&lt;ref name='tvshopping'&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[The Apprentice (UK)|The Apprentice]]|station=[[BBC Two]]|airdate=30 May 2007|season=3|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called her a &quot;wench with a forked tongue&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/tm_method=full%26objectid=19111320%26siteid=89520-name_page.html|title=Katie's in the red again|accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=The Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comments were aimed not just at her fellow contestants but also at viewers of television [[shopping channel]]s, [[maternity leave]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article1894251.ece|title=Last night's TV|accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=The Times | location=London | first=Tim | last=Teeman | date=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the overweight&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv_and_radio/story/0,,2096549,00.html|title=Call me crazy ... but doesn't Katie Hopkins deserve to be Sir Alan's Apprentice?|accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=The Guardian | location=London | first=Grace | last=Dent | date=2007-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and people with the names [[Mavis]] and [[Derek]].&lt;ref name='firedep'&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[The Apprentice: You're Fired!]]|station=[[BBC Two]]|airdate=6 June 2007|season=3|number=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these comments might have been offensive to some, she insisted in her ''[[The Apprentice: You're Fired!|You're Fired!]]'' interview that it was only in the name of comedy, and suggested that she &quot;just needed to vent a bit&quot;.&lt;ref name='firedep'/&gt;

===Relationship with Paul Callaghan===
While filming ''The Apprentice'', Hopkins formed a relationship with fellow contestant [[List of The Apprentice candidates (UK)#Paul Callaghan|Paul Callaghan]]. Various conflicting reports emerged about whether the couple had sex whilst participating in the programme. Reports originally suggested that the couple had had sexual intercourse in the [[attic]] of the house in which the candidates were living,&lt;ref name='paulc'&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2001320029-2007200462,00.html|title=Paul: You're fired, Katie|accessdate=06-14 2007|publisher=The Sun|location=London|date=2007-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Callaghan vehemently denied this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23394836-details/Apprentice+show+flirting+'robbed+me+of+my+chance'/article.do|title=Apprentice show flirting 'robbed me of my chance'|accessdate=06-14 2007|publisher=This is London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later retracted his statement and confirmed that they had made love outdoors.&lt;ref name='bed'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/apprentice/news_030607_katie.shtml|title=I caught two-timing Katie bed-handed|accessdate=06-14 2007|publisher=News of the World|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080612135702/http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/apprentice/news_030607_katie.shtml|archivedate=06-12 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response===
Hopkins emerged as a hate figure in the media, during her time on the programme.

''[[Four Weddings and a Funeral]]'' and ''[[Notting Hill (film)|Notting Hill]]'' writer [[Richard Curtis]] expressed his distaste for Hopkins, jokingly vowing to kill her when he accepted his Fellowship award at the [[British Academy Television Awards 2007|2007 BAFTA awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breaking/story.asp?j=253874945&amp;p=z5387576x&amp;n=253875831|title=Casualty stuns soap rivals to net first BAFTA|accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=Irish Examiner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her fellow contestants have questioned why she took part in the programme.&lt;ref name='firedep'/&gt; [[Simon Ambrose]], a fellow contestant, told ''[[Nuts (magazine)|Nuts Magazine]]'' that he once &quot;had a [[Limerence|crush]] on her&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/fame/article.html?in_article_id=53313&amp;in_page_id=7&amp;in_a_source=|title=Apprentice Simon had crush on Katie|accessdate=06-16 2007|publisher=Metro}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also criticised Katie's much-publicised personal life as he came from a &quot;[[wikt:broken home|broken home]].&quot; Fellow contestant and rival Kristina Grimes said that Hopkins left the programme of her own accord as &quot;she would have eventually got the axe.&quot;&lt;ref name='firedmet'/&gt; Ambrose also quoted Hopkins' friends' claim that her sole purpose in participating in the programme was to start a media career.&lt;ref name=&quot;katiehopkins&quot;/&gt;

Hopkins, like all other [[List of The Apprentice candidates (UK)|''Apprentice'' candidates]], appeared on the accompanying [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off programme]], ''The Apprentice: You're Fired!'', receiving a mixed response from the studio audience.&lt;ref name='firedep'/&gt; When video clips of her comments about other candidates were shown, Hopkins explained that they were &quot;quite funny&quot;. [[Michelle Mone]], the founder of [[lingerie]] company, [[Ultimo (lingerie)|Ultimo]] and a guest on the episode, verbally attacked Hopkins, calling her &quot;exceptionally selfish&quot; and made remarks such as &quot;You've given [[businesswoman|businesswomen]] a bad name&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dollymix.tv/2007/06/katie_quits_the_apprentice_in.html|title=Katie quits The Apprentice in a storm of maternal feelings... and her best quotes|accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=Dolly Mix}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After this incident, Mone was dubbed the &quot;bra woman&quot; by the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Plunkett|title=The Apprentice - series three, episode 11|url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/organgrinder/2007/06/the_apprentice_series_three_ep_10.html|publisher=The Guardian |date=2007-06-06|accessdate=2007-07-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final episode of ''The Apprentice: You're Fired!'', Sir Alan branded Hopkins as sad and unemployable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=461885&amp;in_page_id=1773 |title=Sir Alan's blast to disgraced Apprentice Katie Hopkins: 'You're unemployable!' |accessdate=06-14 2007 |authorlink= |publisher=Daily Mail | location=London | date=2007-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins' comments on leaving the programme contained support for Simon Ambrose to win ''The Apprentice'', and revealed a desire to &quot;smash a glass ceiling&quot; over rival Kristina Grimes' head.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2001320029-2007260330,00.html|title=First time I've told a man 'no'|accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=The Sun|location=London|date=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexism controversy===
Sir Alan Sugar's questioning Hopkins about her [[childcare]] arrangements led to him being accused of sexism by the [[Trade Union Congress]], the [[Equal Opportunities Commission]] and the Recruitment and Employment Confederation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/realitytv/a60107/sir-alan-sugar-accused-of-sexism.html |title=Sir Alan Sugar accused of sexism |accessdate=06-15 2007 |publisher=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was accused of violating the 1975 [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975|Sex Discrimination Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article1901452.ece |title=Sugar faces sexism row as ex-Apprentice sells story |accessdate=06-15 2007 |publisher=The Times | location=London | date=2007-06-08 | first=Adam | last=Sherwin}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident created a huge controversy and was well documented in the media.&lt;ref name=up&gt;{{cite news|url=http://business.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2098403,00.html|title=All fired up|accessdate=06-15 2007 |publisher=The Guardian | location=London | date=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theherald.co.uk/features/features/display.var.1456687.0.0.php|title=Katie gone at last, but was the firing squad fair?|accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=The Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/entertainment/film-tv/news/article2633484.ece|title=Sugar accused of sexism after apprentice quits|accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=The Belfast Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/showbiz/article-23399689-details/Sir+Alan+accused+of+sexism+towards+Apprentice+villain+Katie/article.do|title=Sir Alan accused of sexism towards Apprentice villain Katie|accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=This is London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Alan argued his case in an interview with [[GMTV]] host Fiona Phillips, stating that he was well aware of the rules.&lt;ref name='GMTV'&gt;{{cite episode|title=Sir Alan Sugar Interview|series=[[GMTV]]|station=[[ITV1]]|airdate=13 June 2007|season=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
After her appearance on ''The Apprentice'', Hopkins signed two exclusive deals to sell her story: a newspaper deal with the ''[[News of the World]]'' and a magazine deal with [[EMAP]], the company behind [[heat (magazine)|''Heat'']] and ''[[Grazia]]'' magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,2097757,00.html|title=Apprentice star signs News of the World deal|accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=The Guardian | location=London | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood | date=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In her ''News of the World'' interview, Hopkins played down media reports that she had broken marriages, but did reveal that she had had ten lovers and had sex with a man in the [[barracks]] at The Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst.&lt;ref name=katieh&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/apprentice/news_1006_katie.shtml|title=I’m 10 out of 10 in bed!|accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=The News of the World}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; She told the paper that Michelle Mone, who had verbally attacked her on ''The Apprentice: You’re Fired!'', was probably &quot;just happy to be out of the underwear factory for the day&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsoftheworld.co.uk/videoplayer/videoshowbiz.php?videoid=http://del.interoute.com/?id=96d28f0a-76d2-47be-9efd-ea770c8ff1b7&amp;delivery=stream# |title=Apprentice Katie gives her straight video verdict on Michelle from You're Fired |accessdate=06-15 2007 |publisher=The News of the World}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also told the paper that she lost her virginity aged 17 after leaving a convent school and that she hopes to be a [[Member of Parliament]] for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]], like [[Margaret Thatcher]].&lt;ref name=katieh/&gt;

The day after Hopkins' final ''Apprentice'' episode aired, two prominent news stories emerged about her; [[stepdaughter]] Charlotte McKinney told the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' that Hopkins had ruined her family and driven the teenager to anorexia by sending her cards with stick men drawn on them,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=460026&amp;in_page_id=1773 |title=Apprentice Katie Hopkins 'wrecked my family' |accessdate=06-15 2007 |publisher=Daily Mail | location=London | date=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another ''Mail'' article reported that fans of the programme were accusing the [[BBC]] of fixing her walk-out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/showbiz/showbiznews.html?in_article_id=460375&amp;in_page_id=1773 |title=Apprentice fans accuse the BBC of rigging Katie's walkout |accessdate=06-15 2007 |publisher=The Daily Mail | location=London | date=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hopkins revealed in an interview with [[BBC Radio Kent]] that she had great respect for Sir Alan Sugar, and that she believed she would have won the programme had she been in the final episode. She also said that the media's attitudes towards her did not affect her, but did affect her family.&lt;ref name='radio'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/kent/realmedia/audio/kents_best/thursday.ram|title=Katie Hopkins BBC Radio Kent Interview |accessdate=06-15 2007|publisher=BBC Radio Kent}}&lt;/ref&gt; When talking to [[Fiona Phillips]] in an interview aired on ''[[GMTV Today]]'' on the morning of the final ''Apprentice'' episode, Hopkins suggested that, had she accepted Sir Alan's offer of a place in the final, she would have emerged victorious, despite that Sir Alan Sugar said that if she wanted to press on he would fire her, irrespective of who she was competing with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Katie Hopkins Interview|series=[[GMTV]]|station=[[ITV1]]|airdate=13 June 2007|season=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins told [[BBC Radio 1]] that she has not yet ruled out a media career&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/check/player/nol/newsid_6740000/newsid_6746800?redirect=6746827.stm&amp;news=1&amp;bbram=1&amp;bbwm=1&amp;nbram=1&amp;nbwm=1&amp;prefs=1 |title=Radio 1 Newsbeat – Katie Hopkins Interview |accessdate=06-15 2007 |publisher=BBC Radio 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has expressed an interest in starting a business venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2007/06/13/katie_hopkins_apprentice_feature.shtml |title=What Katie did next... |accessdate=06-14 2007|publisher=BBC Berkshire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has appeared in an episode of ''[[8 out of 10 Cats]]'' and has also been a guest-star on ''[[Loose Women]]'' and ''[[The Friday Night Project]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/showbiz/tv/todaystv/tm_method=full%26objectid=19300905%26siteid=89520-name_page.html|title=Eight out of Ten Cats|accessdate=06-16 2007|publisher=The Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.holymoly.co.uk/news/28/the-apprentices-katie-hopkins-fondles-some-sex-toys-783.html |title=Katie Hopkins makes like a cock|accessdate=06-17 2007|publisher=Holy Moly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geo.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/F/fnp/episodes/s5_ep4.html|title=Show Four: Melanie C |accessdate=07-08 2007|publisher=Channel 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopkins wrote a column for the ''Express and Echo'' newspaper in Exeter, much to the criticism of its readers, but was eventually asked to leave after a poll was put onto the publication's website asking if she should continue with the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Fletcher

==Met Office firing==
On 12 June 2007, the BBC reported that Hopkins had been dismissed.&lt;ref name='firedmet'&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6743877.stm|title=Apprentice contender Katie fired|accessdate=06-15 2007 |publisher=BBC News | date=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Met Office statement said that she did not meet the required standards to complete her probationary period, and confirmed that her performance on ''The Apprentice'' and confessions about her private life were a factor in her dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rte.ie/arts/2007/0612/theapprentice.html |title=Katie Hopkins fired from real job |accessdate=06-15 2007 |publisher=RTÉ}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spokesperson also stated that Hopkins was on a salary of less than £90,000, the salary she claimed for her job before the Met Office.

Hopkins later declared that she is taking the organisation to a tribunal over the decision.&lt;ref name='firedmet'/&gt; She has stated that the media were informed of her dismissal only an hour after she was fired&lt;ref name='GMTV'/&gt; and believes she has been used as a [[Scapegoat#Metaphor|scapegoat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/showbiz/a60912/apprentice-star-katie-im-a-scapegoat.html |title='Apprentice' star Katie: 'I'm a scapegoat' |accessdate=06-15 2007 |publisher=Digital Spy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!''==
Hopkins joined the 2007 series of ''[[I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! (Series 7 UK)|I'm a Celebrity...
