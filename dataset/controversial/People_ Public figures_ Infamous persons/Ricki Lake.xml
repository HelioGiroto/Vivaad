==Early life==
Lake was born to secular &lt;!-- per her autobiography --&gt;[[Jewish]] parents, Barry (a [[pharmacist]]) and Jill (a housewife) Lake, in [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/95/Ricki-Lake.html|title=Ricki Lake Biography}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was largely reared by her paternal grandmother, Sylvia Lake, until the latter's death from breast cancer in 1978.&lt;!-- per her autobiography --&gt; Ricki Lake attended [[Ithaca College]] and the [[Professional Children's School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800073972/bio|title=Ricki Lake Biography| publisher=Yahoo! Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
===Acting===
Lake made her film debut as Tracy Turnblad, the lead character in [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]]' 1988 cult-classic ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]''. Lake also starred in other Waters films including ''[[Cry-Baby]]'' (with [[Johnny Depp]] and [[Susan Tyrell]]), ''[[Cecil B. Demented]]'' (with [[Melanie Griffith]] and [[Stephen Dorff]]), and ''[[Serial Mom]]'' (with [[Kathleen Turner]] and [[Sam Waterston]]). She starred in ''[[Mrs. Winterbourne]]'' with [[Shirley MacLaine]] and [[Brendan Fraser]], ''[[Cabin Boy]]'', ''[[Last Exit to Brooklyn (film)|Last Exit to Brooklyn]]'', ''[[Cookie (film)|Cookie]]'', and ''[[Inside Monkey Zetterland]]''.

She joined the cast of the [[Vietnam War]] drama series ''[[China Beach]]'' as a [[Red Cross]] volunteer, Holly &quot;the Donut Dolly&quot; Pelegrino, for the show's third season. She also had a recurring role on the CBS sitcom ''[[King of Queens]]'' as Doug's sister Stephanie. She guest-starred on television series including ''[[Drop Dead Diva]]'' and a voice role on ''[[King of the Hill]]'', and starred in the [[television movie]] ''Baby Cakes''. She has a cameo appearance in the 2007 remake of the original cult-classic ''[[Hairspray (2007 film)|Hairspray]]'' as a [[William Morris Agency|William Morris talent agent]], and teamed up with star [[Nikki Blonsky]], who had played the role of Tracy Turnblad in the 2007 movie musical remake, and [[Marissa Jaret Winokur]], who had played the role of Tracy Turnblad in the [[Hairspray (musical)|Broadway musical]] based on the original 1988 film, to record &quot;Mama I'm a Big Girl Now&quot; for [[Hairspray (2007 soundtrack)|the soundtrack]], which is played at the film's end credits. She later reunited with original ''Hairspray'' co-star [[Debbie Harry|Deborah Harry]] for the film ''Grammercy Park Hotel'' which was released in 2008. Lake is currently filming her next feature film titled &quot;Angel&quot; to be released in theaters in 2012. {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===Talk shows===
{{Main|Ricki Lake (TV series)}}
''Ricki Lake'' was Lake's first daytime [[talk show]]. The wildly successful show specialized in topics involving invited guests and incorporated questions and comments from a studio audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Respect earns Ricki Lake success on TV|work= Baltimore Sun|url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-12-06/features/1993340108_1_ricki-lake-angry-show-open-book|accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= 8 Ricki Lake|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=December 30, 1994|url= http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305108,00.html|accessdate=2010-12-07|first=Jess|last=Cagle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Gen-X Cinderella has the knack|work=[[Baltimore Sun]]|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1999-02-28/entertainment/9902280314_1_ricki-lake-hairspray-john-waters|accessdate=2012-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show debuted in syndication on September 13, 1993 and ended first-run episodes on May 25, 2004. In 2000, Lake told [[Rosie O'Donnell]] in an interview she had signed on for four additional years. Although [[Sony Pictures Television]] had many stations contracted through the 2004–2005 season, Lake decided to end the show in August 2004, citing (among other things) a desire to spend time with her family. She moved from [[Los Angeles]] to [[New York City|New York]] to tape the 11th season of the show, then returned to [[California]] when taping was complete. Lake will return to the talk show platform when she hosts a second [[The Ricki Lake Show|talk show]] newly premiering in September 2012. {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

===2006–2010: Other projects===
[[File:Ricki Lake LF.JPG|thumb|Lake at the premiere of ''[[Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story]]'' in 2007.]]

After her talk show had wrapped production on its final season, Lake went on to host the 2006 [[CBS]] limited series ''[[Gameshow Marathon (U.S. TV series)|Gameshow Marathon]]'', which re-created classic [[game show]]s with celebrity contestants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/06/15/earlyshow/main1717535.shtml|title=Ricki Lake Is Back In The Game|last=Amy|first=Bonawitz|date=2006-06-15|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also signed a development deal with ''Gameshow Marathon'' production company [[FremantleMedia]] for other ventures, including creating and producing future programs and projects. In October 2007, Lake appeared in the Lifetime TV movie ''Matters of Life and Dating''. 

''[[The Business of Being Born]]'', Lake's documentary about [[home birth]] and [[midwifery]], was released in limited markets on January 18, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/1809861551/details|title = The Business of Being Born (2008) - Movie Details|publisher = Yahoo! Movies}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film premiered at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] and Red Envelope released the film in New York, L.A. and San Francisco in October&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.movieweb.com/news/70/22370.php|title = Ricki Lake's The Business of Being Born to Be Released in October}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it also screened in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;rickilakedoco.net&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.rickilakedoco.net| title = Benefit Screening: The Business of Being Born}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Business of Being Born'' included footage and details of Lake's own &quot;life-changing&quot; home-birthing experience and followed a midwife going about her work. [[Tribeca]] called it &quot;The Inconvenient Truth of Childbirth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rickilakedoco.net&quot;/&gt; Lake described it as her life's work for the last three years and expressed hopes that the film educated and empowered people to really know their choices in childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/ricki-lake/ricki-lake-on-the-bus_b_46002.html|title=Ricki Lake: Ricki Lake On The Business Of Being Born|publisher = The Huffington Post|date=November 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She performed in a CBS television special, ''[[Loving Leah]]'' in January of that year. Lake also jointly wrote a book on the world of [[natural childbirth]] and birthing options, along with Abby Epstein and Jacques Moritz, ''Your Best Birth'', which was published by Wellness Central on May 1, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hachettebookgroup.com/books_9780446538138.htm|title=Your Best Birth|publisher=Hachette Book Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake and Epstein also launched MyBestBirth.com, an online social network, powered by Ning, intended to allow parents and medical professionals to dialogue about varying birthing options and resources.  

Lake returned to television on May 11, 2009, succeeding [[Sharon Osbourne]] as host for the third season of [[VH1]]'s ''[[Charm School (TV series)|Charm School]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20090205vh101|title=Ricki Lake is the New Headmistress Of VH1's Third Installment of Charm School|publisher=Futon Critic|date=February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/charm_school/season_3/series.jhtml|title = VH1's Charm School with Ricki Lake}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 10, 2010, Lake joined fellow talkers [[Phil Donahue]], [[Sally Jessy Raphael]], [[Geraldo Rivera]], and [[Montel Williams]] as guests of [[Oprah Winfrey]] on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''. This marked the first time these hosts ever appeared together on one show since their programs left the air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oprah.com/showinfo/Talk-Show-Hosts-Together-for-the-First-Time_1 &quot;Donahue, Sally, Geraldo, Montel, Ricki: Talk Show Hosts Together For The First Time&quot;] from Oprah.com (November 8, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011–present===
In March 2011 it was reported that three television studios, [[Twentieth Television]], [[Universal Media Studios]] and [[CBS Television Distribution]], were interested in bringing Lake back to the talk show realm in 2012. This after Lake began appearing on various programs in which she expressed a desire to return to the genre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/465251-EXCLUSIVE_Ricki_Lake_Poised_for_a_2012_Comeback.php &quot;EXCLUSIVE: Ricki Lake Poised for a 2012 Comeback&quot;] from [[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] (March 14, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; 

On April 20, 2011, Lake signed with Twentieth Television to develop ''[[The Ricki Lake Show]]'', slated to premier in fall 2012. The new program will have more of an &quot;Oprah&quot;-like format than that of her former talk show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/467085-EXCLUSIVE_Ricky_Lake_Returning_to_Daytime.php &quot;EXCLUSIVE: Ricki Lake Returning to Daytime&quot;] from Broadcasting &amp; Cable (April 20, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

Lake competed on the thirteenth season of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]''.  She was partnered with three-time champion [[Derek Hough]] and cited [[Kirstie Alley]]'s appearance as an inspiration to do the show. Lake achieved tremendous success on the show, not only by consistently scoring high, but she also lost 20 pounds due to her dancing. After making the finals, Lake was announced as the contestant in third place, losing to TV personality [[Rob Kardashian]] and actor and Army veteran [[J.R. Martinez]], despite having higher scores than both.

===In pop culture===
Lake's first talk show was repeatedly featured during the 1990s on ''[[Saturday Night Live]],'' with male cast member [[Jay Mohr]] impersonating Lake in drag. In the music video for the song &quot;Perfect Match&quot; by the hip hop group [[Cella Dwellas]], Lake's shows about cheating spouses was also satirized. 

Her show is mentioned in various songs, such as:
*&quot;I Love Work&quot; by [[Butterfingers (Australian band)|Butterfingers]].
*&quot;[[Strong (song)|Strong]]&quot; by [[Robbie Williams]].
*&quot;[[Hole in the Head]]&quot; by [[Sugababes]].
*&quot;Little White Lie&quot; by [[Tanya Stephens]].
*&quot;Life's a Bitch&quot; by [[Shooter (band)|Shooter]].
*&quot;[[Till the World Ends|Till the World Ends (Femme Fatale Remix)]]&quot; by [[Britney Spears]] featuring [[Kesha|Ke$ha]] &amp; [[Nicki Minaj]].
*&quot;Dating Game&quot; by [[Insane Clown Posse]]
*&quot;[[Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)]]&quot; by [[The Offspring]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lyrics007.com/Offspring%20Lyrics/Pretty%20Fly%20Lyrics.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;Exhibit Based&quot; by [[Lil B]]
* &quot;Who Would've Thought&quot; by Rancid

It was also mentioned in an episode of the TV show ''[[Family Guy]]'' titled &quot;[[Peter, Peter, Caviar Eater]],&quot; in which Brian, attempting to rehabilitate Peter in the ways of a gentleman, electrically shocks Peter every time he looks at a television showing an episode of Ricki Lake. In the [[Warner Bros.]] show ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', Rory mentions feeling like she is on ''The Ricki Lake Show'', with Lorelai then replying, &quot;Go, Rory! Go, Rory!&quot; which alludes to the first talk show in which the audience chanted along to the show's opening theme and closing credits with, &quot;Go, Ricki! Go, Ricki!&quot;  It is referenced briefly in the [[1996 in film|1996]] films ''[[Scream (1996 film)|Scream]]'' and ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]].''

==Personal life==
Lake married illustrator/bartender Rob Sussman in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] in March 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Castro|first=Peter|date=1994-05-23|title=Down the Alleys With...Ricki Lake|journal=People|volume=41|issue=19|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20108187,00.html|accessdate=2009-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have two sons, Milo Sebastian Sussman born March 22, 1997 and Owen Tyler Sussman born June 18, 2001. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,622075,00.html|title=Lake's Water Baby|last=Silverman|first=Stephen M.|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|accessdate=2009-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake and Sussman separated in August 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20140996,00.html|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|title=All Talked Out|date=September 8, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and divorced in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20489028,00.html|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]| title=Ricki Lake Has a New Boyfriend|date=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lake began dating Christian Evans in the summer of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20489028,00.html|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]| title=Ricki Lake Has a New Boyfriend|date=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were engaged in August 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20517644,00.html|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]| title=Ricki Lake Is Engaged|date=August 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and married on April 8, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20585052,00.html|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|title=Ricki Lake Elopes|date=April 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2007, Lake pursued a &quot;new routine&quot; resulting in 24 pounds of weight loss, taking her down to 120 pounds (55&amp;nbsp;kg). In the early 90's her weight peaked at 260 pounds (122&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18494736/|title=Ricki Lake learned to lose weight the right way - Access Hollywood|publisher=MSNBC.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2007, Lake cited sexual abuse as a child as a reason for her problems with obesity.&lt;ref name=&quot;acccesshollywood_sexabuse&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Ricki Lake Gets Personal In New Book About Childbirth|url=http://www.accesshollywood.com/ricki-lake/ricki-lake-gets-personal-in-new-book-about-childbirth_article_18450|work=Access Hollywood|accessdate=8 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 18, 2010, Lake's rented [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] home was destroyed by fire. She and her sons escaped without injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ricki Lake and family escape death as fire burns down beachside vacation home in 30 minutes|work=[[Daily Mail]]|location=London|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1313344/Ricki-Lake-family-escape-death-burns-summer-beachside-home.html|date=19 September 2010|accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On January 15, 2011, Lake finished in sixth place in the [[PokerStars Caribbean Adventure]] Luxury Ladies Poker Event, collecting $5,587 of the prizepool.&lt;ref&gt;Sanger, David E.
