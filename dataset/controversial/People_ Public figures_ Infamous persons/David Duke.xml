'''David Ernest Duke''' (born July 1, 1950) is a former [[Grand Wizard]] of the Knights of the [[Ku Klux Klan]]  an American activist and writer, and former [[Republican Party (US)|Republican]] [[Louisiana House of Representatives|Louisiana State Representative]]. He was a candidate in the [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] presidential primaries in 1988 and the Republican presidential primaries in 1992. Duke has unsuccessfully run for the [[Louisiana State Senate]], [[U.S. Senate]], [[U.S. House of Representatives]], and [[List of Governors of Louisiana|Governor of Louisiana]].

==Youth and early adulthood==
Duke was born in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] to David H. Duke and Alice Maxine Crick. As the son of an engineer for [[Shell Oil Company|Shell Oil]], Duke frequently moved with his family around the world. They lived a short time in the [[Netherlands]], before settling in [[Louisiana]]. In the late 1960s, Duke met the leader of the white supremacist [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]], [[William Luther Pierce|William Pierce]], who would remain a lifelong influence. Duke joined the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;Issues '92 Profile: David Duke; ''[[The Orange County Register]]''. Santa Ana, Calif.: Mar 2, 1992. pg. a.04&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke studied at [[Louisiana State University]] (LSU) in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]], and in 1970, he formed a [[White people|white]] student group called the White Youth Alliance; it was affiliated with the [[Harold Covington|National Socialist White People's Party]]. The same year, to protest [[William Kunstler]]'s appearance at [[Tulane University]], Duke appeared at a demonstration in [[Nazism|Nazi]] uniform. Picketing and holding parties on the anniversary of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s birth, he became notorious on the LSU campus for wearing a Nazi uniform.&lt;ref name=&quot;rise&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bridges|first=Tyler|title=The Rise of David Duke|year=1995|publisher=University of Mississippi Press|isbn=0-87805-678-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke claimed to have spent nine months in [[Laos]], calling that a &quot;normal tour of duty&quot;. He actually went there to join his father, who was working there and had asked him to visit during the summer of 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bridges 1995 26–29&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bridges|first=Tyler|title=The Rise of David Duke|year=1995|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-0-87805-684-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=X2WD3EnAVvEC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=%22David+Duke%E2%80%8E;%22++vietnam#v=onepage&amp;q=%20%20%20vietnam&amp;f=false|pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father got him a job teaching English to Laotian military officers, from which he was dismissed after six weeks when he drew a [[Molotov cocktail|Molotov Cocktail]] on the blackboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=B.G.|last=Burkett|title=Stolen Valor: How the Vietnam Generation was robbed of its heroes and history|publisher=Verity Press|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Xd0DAAAACAAJ&amp;dq=stole+valor|isbn=978-0-9667036-0-3|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed to have gone behind enemy lines twenty times at night to drop rice to anti-Communist insurgents in planes flying ten feet off the ground, narrowly avoiding receiving a shrapnel wound. Two [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] pilots who were in Laos at that time said that flights were during the day and flew no less than 500 feet from the ground. One suggested that it might have been possible for Duke to have gone on a safe &quot;milk run&quot; once or twice but no more than that. Duke was also unable to recall the name of the airfield used.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bridges 1995 26–29&quot;/&gt;

He graduated from [[Louisiana State University]] in 1974 after enrolling in 1968. During this time he spent what would have been his senior year organizing the National Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bridges|first=Tyler|title=The Rise of David Duke|year=1995|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-0-87805-684-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=X2WD3EnAVvEC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=%22David+Duke%E2%80%8E;%22++vietnam#v=onepage&amp;q=%20%20%20vietnam&amp;f=false|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and personal life==
While working in the White Youth Alliance, Duke met Chloê Hardin, who became active in the group. They remained companions throughout college and married in 1974. Hardin is the mother of Duke's two daughters, Erika and Kristin. According to an article by [[Martin A. Lee]] in the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]'s ''[[Intelligence Report]]'', in 1977 David Duke, then married with two children, pursued female sex partners so avidly and so openly that it embarrassed many of his closest colleagues.&lt;ref name=&quot;splcenter.org&quot; /&gt; Metzger, then Duke's state leader in southern California, became livid when Duke showed up for a Ku Klux Klan [[anti-immigrant]] &quot;border watch&quot; stunt and immediately started pursuing women.&lt;ref name=&quot;splcenter.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2003/spring/insatiable |title=Get informed |publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke divorced in 1984—arguably because Chloe was fed up with Duke's womanizing&lt;ref name=uipqz&gt;The Rise of David Duke,  Tyler Bridges, pg. 80, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;—and Chloe moved to [[West Palm Beach, Florida|West Palm Beach]] to be near her parents. There she became involved with Duke's Klan friend, [[Don Black (white nationalist)|Don Black]], whom she later married.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Kim|first=T.

As of 2009, it was confirmed that David Duke was living in [[Zell am See]] in [[Salzburg (state)|Salzburg]], [[Austria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlament.gv.at/PAKT/VHG/XXIV/NRSITZ/NRSITZ_00023/SEITE_0136.html |title=Parlamentarische Materialien |publisher=Parlament.gv.at |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; from which he ran the Internet business &quot;Art by Ernst&quot;, taking and selling photographs of rare birds, mountain scenery and wildlife&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Mysterious Tale of a Ukrainian University's Anti-Semitic Crusade|first=Nadine|last=Epstein|date=November/December 2009|work=Moment Magazine|url=http://www.momentmag.com/Exclusive/2009/2009-12/200912-MAUP.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salzburger-fenster.at/rubrik/lokales/1909/us-rechtsextremist-nutzt-salzburg-seit_12707.html|title=US-Rechtsextremist nutzt Salzburg seit Jahren als Zuflucht|date=September 19, 2009|first=Sonja|last=Wenger|work=Salzburger Fenster}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the pseudonym &quot;Ernst Duke&quot; (his middle-name &quot;Ernest&quot; Germanized).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gruene.at/uploads/media/dossier_duke_ernest_duke.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hagalil.com/archiv/2009/05/17/duke-2/|title=Ex-Ku-Klux-Boss: Rückzugsgebiet in den Alpen|accessdate=2011-07-22|work=haGalil.com|location=|date=2009-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local authorities have stated that as long as he does not break any laws, Duke is allowed to stay in Austria if he wishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/austria/5319566/Former-KKK-grand-wizard-living-in-Austria.html|title=Former KKK grand wizard living in Austria|accessdate=2009-05-13|work=The Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke has stated: ''&quot;I'm not in Austria for any political activities. I just come to Austria to relax – the mountains are beautiful. The Austrian Alps are just beautiful. There's beauty all over the world.&quot;'' In May 2009, Duke issued a statement denying that he resides in Austria and saying that he is a resident of [[Mandeville, Louisiana]], and is registered as a taxpayer in his city, state and on the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.davidduke.com/general/i-live-in-america-setting-straight-the-silly-telegraph-article_13847.html|title=A Letter to the Telegraph|publisher=davidduke.com|accessdate=November 20, 2009|date=May 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activities==
===Early campaigns===
Duke first ran for the [[Louisiana State Senate]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] from a Baton Rouge district in 1975. He received 11,079 votes, a third of those cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Wayne King|title=David Duke:Cleaning up the Klan's image |date=1975-11-25|work=St. Petersburg Times via New York Times|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JjIMAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=UF8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4666,22684&amp;dq=david-duke&amp;hl=en|accessdate=2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, he ran as a Democrat for the 10th District Senate seat and finished second in a three-candidate race with 9,897 votes (26 percent).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=328064 |title=Our Campaigns – LA State Senate 10 Race – October 27, 1979 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke allegedly conducted a direct-mail appeal in 1987, using the identity and mailing-list of the Georgia [[Nationalist Movement|Forsyth County Defense League]] without permission. League officials described it as a fund-raising scam. Duke was accused by several Klan officials of stealing his organization's money. &quot;Duke is nothing but a con artist,&quot; Jack Gregory, Duke's Florida state leader, told the ''Clearwater Sun'' (of Florida) after David Duke allegedly refused to turn over proceeds from a series of 1979 Klan rallies to the Knights. Another Klan official under Duke, Jerry Dutton, told reporters that Duke had used Klan funds to purchase and refurbish his home in Metairie. Duke later justified the repairs by saying most of his home was used by the Klan. In 1979, after his first, abortive run for president (as a Democrat) and a series of highly publicized violent Klan incidents, Duke quietly incorporated the nonprofit [[National Association for the Advancement of White People]] (NAAWP) in an attempt to leave the baggage of the Klan behind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--paging_filter--&gt;By Martin A. Lee |url=http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2003/spring/insatiable?page=0,1 |title=Southern Poverty Law Center |publisher=Splcenter.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1988 Democratic presidential campaign===
In 1988, Duke ran initially in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] presidential [[primary election|primaries]]. His campaign failed to make much of an impact, with the one notable exemption of winning the little-known [[New Hampshire primary#Vice-Presidential results|New Hampshire Vice-Presidential primary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=393638 |title=Our Campaigns – D Primary Race – February 16, 1988 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke, having failed to gain much traction as a Democrat, then successfully sought the [[President of the United States|Presidential]] nomination of the [[Populist Party (United States, 1984)|Populist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=294226 Our Campaigns – US President – Pop Convention Race], March 11, 1988]
&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared on the ballot for President in eleven states and was a write-in candidate in some other states, some with [[Trenton Stokes]] of [[Arkansas]] for [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]], and on other state ballots with [[Floyd Parker]] for Vice President. He received just 47,047 votes, for 0.04 percent of the combined, national popular vote.&lt;ref&gt;D.C. Finegold-Sachs (2005). D.C.'s Political Report.

===1989: Successful run in special election for Louisiana House seat===
In December 1988, Duke changed his political affiliation from the Democratic Party to the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].&lt;ref name=Zatarain&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=CXzQ2VSpyZsC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=John+Treen+of+Louisiana&amp;q=John%20Treen%20of%20Louisiana|title=Michael Zatarain, ''David Duke: Evolution of a Klansman''|publisher=Google Books|accessdate=November 11, 2009|isbn=978-0-88289-817-9|author1=Zatarain, Michael|date=1990-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Republican State Representative [[Charles Cusimano]] of [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]] resigned his District 89 seat to become a 24th Judicial District Court judge, and a [[special election]] was called early in 1989 to select a successor. Duke entered the race to succeed Cusimano and faced several opponents, including fellow Republicans, [[John S. Treen|John Spier Treen]], a brother of former [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[David C. Treen]], Delton Charles, a school board member, and [[Roger F. Villere, Jr.]], who operates Villere's Florist in Metairie. Duke finished first in the primary with 3,995 votes (33.1%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=328066|title=Louisiana State Representative Election, 1989|publisher=ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=November 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As no one received a majority of the vote in the first round, a [[runoff election]] was required between Duke and Treen, who polled 2,277 votes (18.9%) in the first round of balloting. John Treen's candidacy was endorsed by [[U.S. President]] [[George H. W. Bush]], former President [[Ronald Reagan]], and other notable Republicans,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;GOP Condemns Duke&quot; ''[[Newsday]]''. Long Island, N.Y.: February 25, 1989, pg. 9&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the  Democrat [[Victor Bussie]] (president of the Louisiana [[AFL-CIO]]) and [[Edward J. Steimel]] (president of the [[Louisiana Association of Business and Industry]] and former director of the &quot;good government&quot; [[think tank]], the Public Affairs Research Council). Duke, however, hammered Treen on a statement the latter had made indicating a willingness to entertain higher [[property tax]]es, anathema in that [[suburban]] district.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas D. Rose, ''The Emergence of David Duke and the Politics of Race'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1992), p. iii (ISBN 0807843814,
ISBN 978-0-8078-4381-9); see also Michael Zatarain, ''David Duke: Evolution of a Klansman'' (Gretna, LA: Pelican, 1990), ISBN 0-88289-817-5, ISBN 978-0-88289-817-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Duke with 8,459 votes (50.7%) defeated Treen, who polled 8,232 votes (49.3%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=328065 |title=Our Campaigns – LA State House 081 – Special Election Runoff Race – February 18, 1989 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served in the House from 1990 until 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://house.louisiana.gov/H_PDFdocs/HouseMembers1812_2008.pdf|title=Membership of the Louisiana House of Representatives, 1812-2008|publisher=house.louisiana.gov|accessdate=November 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a short-term legislator, Duke was, in the words of a colleague, [[Ron Gomez]] of [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]], &quot;so single minded, he never really became involved in the nuts and  bolts of House rules and parliamentary procedure. It was just that shortcoming that led to the demise of most of his attempts at lawmaking.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ron Gomez, ''My Name Is Ron And I'm a Recovering Legislator: Memoirs of a Louisiana State Representative'', Lafayette, Louisiana: Zemog Publishing, 2000, pg. 230, ISBN=0-9700156-0-7&lt;/ref&gt;

One legislative issue pushed by Duke was the requirement that welfare recipients be tested for the use of narcotics. The recipients had to show themselves to be drug-free to receive state and federal benefits under his proposal.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Duke welfare bill wins panel favor,&quot; ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', May 9, 1989, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez recalls having met and interviewed Duke in the middle 1970s when Duke was a state senate candidate: &quot;He was still in his mid-20s and very non-descript. Tall and slimly built, he had a very prominent nose, flat cheek bones, a slightly receding chin and straight dark brown hair. The interview turned out to be quite innocuous, and I hadn't thought about it again until Duke came to my legislative desk, and we shook hands. Who was this guy? Tall and well-built with a perfect nose, a model's cheek bones, prominent chin, blue eyes and freshly coiffed blond hair, he looked like a movie star. He obviously didn't remember from the radio encounter, and I was content to leave it at that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, ''Recovering Legislator'', pg. 228. Gomez has implied that Duke had a facelift by the time he entered the legislature.&lt;/ref&gt;

Consistent with Gomez's observation, Duke in the latter 1980s reportedly had his nose thinned and chin augmented. Following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives, he shaved his mustache.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Joshua Benton|Benton, Joshua]]|title=National: David Duke Reverts to Unabashed Racism in Congress run |date=1999-05-01|publisher=Block News Alliance|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/headlines/19990501davidduke3.asp|accessdate=2006-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gullixson|first=Paul|title=Part 4: Taking on David Duke|date=1995-04-12|publisher=Palo Alto Weekly|work=Palo Alto Weekly|url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/page4/1995_Apr_12.NOTES12.html|accessdate=2006-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Ben|title=American Nazi Idol|date=2005-08-18|publisher=FrontPageMagazine.com|url=http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=19186|accessdate=2006-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez continued: &quot;He once presented a bill on the floor, one of the few which he had managed to get out of committee. He finished his opening presentation and strolled with great self-satisfaction back up the aisle to his seat. In his mind, he had spoken, made his presentation and that was that. Before he had even reached his desk and re-focused on the proceedings, another first-term member had been recognized for the floor and immediately moved to table the bill. The House voted for the motions effectively killing the bill. That and similar procedures were used against him many times.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ron Gomez, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; Gomez said that he recalls Duke obtaining the passage of only a single bill, legislation which prohibited movie producers or book publishers from compensating jurors for accounts of their court experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, ''Recovering Legislator'', pgs. 231-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez added that Duke's &quot;tenure in the House was short and uninspired. Never has anyone parlayed an election by such a narrow margin to such a minor position to such international prominence. He has run for numerous other positions without success but has always had some effect, usually negative, on the outcome.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, ''Recovering Legislator'', pg. 231&lt;/ref&gt;

Gomez continued: Duke's &quot;new message was that he had left the Klan, shed the Nazi uniform he had proudly worn in many previous appearances and only wanted to serve the people. He eliminated his high-octane anti-Semitic rhetoric. He was particularly concerned with the plight of 'European-Americans.' He never blatantly spoke of race as a factor but referred to the 'growing underclass.' He used the tried and true demagoguery of [[class envy]] to sell his message: excessive taxpayers' money spent on welfare, school busing practices, [[affirmative action]]... and set-aside programs. He also embraced a subject near and dear to every Jefferson Parish voter, protection of the [[homestead exemption]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gomez, ''Recovering Legislator'', pg. 222&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke launched unsuccessful campaigns for the [[U.S. Senate]] in 1990 and governor in 1991. Villere did not again seek office but instead concentrated his political activity within the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] organization.&lt;ref name=sabludowsky&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayoubuzz.com/News/Louisiana/Politics/Jindal_Has_Mighty_Duke_In_Louisiana_GOP_and_Roger_Villere__9076.asp|title=Stephen Sabludowsky, &quot;Jindal Has Mighty Duke in Louisiana GOP and Roger Villere&quot;|publisher=bayoubuzz.com|accessdate=November 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990 campaign for U.S. Senate===
In 1990, in the October 6 primary, Duke ran as a Republican against three Democrats including incumbent Senator [[Bennett Johnston, Jr.|J. Bennett Johnston, Jr.]]&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=3516 |title=Our Campaigns – LA US Senate Race – October 6, 1990 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Republican Party endorsed state Senator [[Ben Bagert]] of New Orleans, but national GOP officials anticipated that Bagert could not win and was fragmenting Johnston's support; so funding for Bagert's campaign was halted, and he dropped out two days before the election, though his name remained on the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Louisiana Republican Quits, Reducing Duke's Chances|date=1990-10-05|work=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke's views prompted some of his critics (including Republicans) to form the Louisiana Coalition Against Racism and Nazism, which directed media attention to Duke's statements of hostility to blacks and [[Jews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Monteverde|first=Danny|title=Elizabeth Rickey, GOP activist|newspaper=[[The Times-Picayune]]|date=September 15, 2009|url=http://www.nola.com/obituaries/t-p/index.ssf?/base/obits-33/125299209991370.xml&amp;coll=2|accessdate=2009-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke received 43.51 percent (607,391 votes) of the vote to Johnston's 53.93 percent (752,902 votes).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In a 2006 editorial, Gideon Rachman (''[[The Economist]]'', the ''[[Financial Times]]'') recalled interviewing Duke's campaign manager (from his 1990 campaign) who said, &quot;The Jews just aren't a big issue in Louisiana. We keep telling David, stick to attacking the blacks. There's no point in going after the Jews, you just piss them off and nobody here cares about them anyway.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iran, David Duke and me|date=2006-12-12|publisher=rachmanblogg on FT.com|url=http://blogs.ft.com/rachmanblog/2006/12/iran_david_duke.html#more|accessdate=2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1991 campaign for Governor of Louisiana===
{{Main|Louisiana gubernatorial election, 1991}}
Despite repudiation by the Republican Party,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Suro|first=Roberto|title=The 1991 Election: Louisiana; Bush Denounces Duke As Racist and Charlatan|publisher=New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1991/11/07/us/the-1991-election-louisiana-bush-denounces-duke-as-racist-and-charlatan.html|accessdate=2009-04-19|date=1991-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke ran for Louisiana Governor in 1991. In the open primary, Duke was second to former governor [[Edwin Edwards]] in votes; thus, he faced Edwards in a runoff. In the initial round, Duke received 32% of the vote. Incumbent Governor [[Buddy Roemer]], who had switched from the Democratic to Republican parties during his term, came in third with 27% of the vote. Duke effectively killed Roemer's bid for re-election. While Duke had a sizable core constituency of devoted supporters, many voted for him as a &quot;protest vote&quot; to register dissatisfaction with Louisiana's establishment politicians. Duke said he was the spokesman for the &quot;White majority.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;David Duke Going for U.S. Senate seat&quot; Sheila Grissett East Jefferson bureau. ''[[The Times-Picayune]]'' New Orleans, La.: February 23, 1996. pg. B1&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Christian Coalition of America]], which exerted considerable impact on the Republican State Central Committee, was led in Louisiana by its national direcor and vice president, [[Billy McCormack (Louisiana pastor)|Billy McCormack]], then the pastor of University Worship Center in [[Shreveport, Louisiana|Shreveport]]. The coalition was accused of having failed to investigate Duke in the early part of his political resurgence. By the time of the 1991 gubernatorial election, however, its leadership had withdrawn support from Duke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theocracywatch.org/clarkson_inside.html|title=Frederick Clarkson, &quot;Church and State'', November 1993|publisher=theocracywatch.org|accessdate=June 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[interest group]], the Louisiana Coalition against Racism and Nazism, rallied against the election of Duke as governor.  [[Beth Rickey]], a moderate member of the Louisiana Republican State Central Committee and a [[Ph.D.]] student at [[Tulane University]], began to follow Duke to record his speeches and expose what she saw as instances of racist and neo-Nazi remarks. For a time, Duke took Rickey to lunch, introduced her to his daughters, telephoned her late at night, and tried to convince her that he was a mainstream conservative in the Reagan mold.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia Sullivan, &quot;Beth Rickey dies with an immune disorder and Crohn's disease,&quot; ''[[Washington Post]]'', September 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the primary and the runoff, called the &quot;general election&quot; under Louisiana election rules (in which all candidates run on one ballot, regardless of party), white supremacist organizations from around the country contributed to his campaign fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lee|first=Martin A.|title=Detailing David Duke|year=2003|work=Intelligence Report|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=27|accessdate=2006-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Duke: In His Own Words|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|url=http://www.adl.org/special_reports/duke_own_words/duke_intro.asp|accessdate=2006-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke was endorsed by [[James Meredith]], a black civil rights figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.racematters.org/jamesmeredith.htm |title=Civil rights figure explains 'renegade' views to BCC students |publisher=Racematters.org |date=2003-02-14 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke's success garnered national media attention. While Duke gained the backing of the quixotic former [[Alexandria, Louisiana|Alexandria]] Mayor [[John K. Snyder]], he won few serious endorsements in Louisiana. Celebrities and organizations donated thousands to Edwards' campaign. Referencing Edwards' long-standing problem with accusations of corruption, popular bumper stickers read: &quot;Vote for the Crook. It's Important&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Appelbome|first=Peter|title=An Epoch Is Ending But Why?|publisher=New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/08/us/an-epoch-is-ending-but-why.html|accessdate=2011-01-16|date=1994-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://photos.nola.com/tpphotos/2011/12/175duke.html Photo of bumper sticker], ''New Orleans Times-Picayune''&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Vote for the Lizard, not the Wizard.&quot; When a reporter asked Edwards what he needed to do to triumph over Duke, Edwards replied with a smile: &quot;Stay alive.&quot;

Edwards received 1,057,031 votes (61.2%). Duke's 671,009 votes represented 38.8% of the total. Duke claimed victory, saying: &quot;I won my constituency. I won 55% of the white vote.&quot; Exit polls confirmed that he had.&lt;ref name=&quot;rise&quot; /&gt;

===1992 Republican Party presidential candidate===
In 1992 Duke ran for the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1992|nomination]]. Republican Party officials tried to block his participation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Officials reject putting Duke on ballot for state primary|first=Edward T.|last=McHugh|work=Telegram &amp; Gazette. |location=Worcester, Mass.|date=December 13, 1991|page=A.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received 119,115 (0.94%) votes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=55213 |title=Our Campaigns – US President – R Primaries Race – February 1, 1992 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the primaries, but no delegates to the national convention. His presidential campaign inspired a song by [[Skankin' Pickle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pickle&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Skankin-Pickle-Fever/dp/B000000GZ6|title=Skankin' Pickle Fever}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 a film was released that investigated Duke's appeal among some white voters. ''Backlash: Race and the American Dream'' explored the demagogic issues of Duke's platform, examining his use of black crime, welfare, affirmative action and white supremacy and tied Duke to a legacy of other white backlash politicians, such as [[Lester G. Maddox]] and [[George C. Wallace, Jr.]], and the use in the 1988 Presidential campaign of Pres. George H.W. Bush of these same racially themed hot buttons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Examining the Appeal of David Duke's Oratory|date=1992-07-10|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 1990s campaigns===
When Johnston announced his retirement in 1996, Duke ran again for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. He polled 141,489 votes (11.5%). Former Republican state representative [[Woody Jenkins]] of Baton Rouge and Democrat [[Mary Landrieu]] of New Orleans, the former state treasurer, went into the general election contest. Duke was fourth in the nine-person, [[Nonpartisan blanket primary|jungle primary]] race.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F02E5DC163EF930A35752C0A96F958260 David Duke Heads North to Raise Money for House Race&quot;] By Michael Janofsky, ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 3, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the sudden resignation of powerful Republican incumbent [[Bob Livingston]] in 1999, a special election was held in Louisiana's First Congressional District. Duke sought the seat as a Republican and received 19% of the vote. He finished a close third, thus failing to make the runoff. His candidacy was repudiated by the Republicans.&lt;ref name=livingston&gt;{{cite news|last= Edsall|first=Thomas B.|title=David Duke to Seek Livingston's Seat|publisher=The Washington Post|date=1998-12-21|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/keyraces99/stories/duke122198.htm|accessdate=2008-09-20|quote=Yesterday, the party moved quickly once again to disassociate itself from Duke.

Treen]]. Also in the race was the New Orleans Republican leader [[Rob Couhig]].

In 1999 Duke ran for Louisiana's First Congressional District. Duke finished third in the May 1, 1999 election with 28,059 votes (19.15%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=88588 |title=Our Campaigns – LA District 1 – Special Election Race – May 1, 1999 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Duke's bodyguard, roommate, and longtime associate Roy Armstrong made a bid for the [[United States House of Representatives]], running as a Democrat, to serve Louisiana's First Congressional District. In the open primary Armstrong finished second in the six candidate field with 6.69% of the vote, but Republican [[Bobby Jindal]] received 78.40% winning the seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4156 |title=Our Campaigns – LA – District 1 Race – November 2, 2004 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke was the head advisor of Armstrong's campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sabludowsky|first=Steve|title=David Duke Close Associate Runs for Congress in Race With Indian-American Bobby Jindal|date=2004-08-06|publisher=BayouBuzz.com|url=http://www.bayoubuzz.com/articles.aspx?aid=2044|accessdate=2006-09-01}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Burdeau|first=Cain|title=KKK Leader David Duke's Home is Raided by Federal Agents|date=2000-11-17|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/KKK-Duke-Home-Raided.htm|accessdate=2006-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affiliations and support==
===Cindy Sheehan===

On August 5, 2005, Duke published an article stating support for anti-war activist [[Cindy Sheehan]], saying that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The Iraq war and her son's death did not defend America from hatred or terrorism ... In fact, the war is massively increasing hatred and terrorism. For every one terrorist killed in Iraq, we are creating thousands more who hate and want to hurt America and Americans. This is the surest way to lose the war on terror, not win it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davidduke.com/index.php?p=350 |title=Why Cindy Sheehan is Right! |first=David |last=Duke |publisher=Davidduke.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Knights of the Ku Klux Klan===
In 1974, David Duke founded the Louisiana-based [[Ku Klux Klan#Knights of the Ku Klux Klan|Knights of the Ku Klux Klan]] (KKKK), a Louisiana [[Ku Klux Klan]] organization, shortly after graduating from LSU.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Douglas. ''The Emergence of David Duke and the Politics of Race'' University of North Carolina Press. 1992&lt;/ref&gt;  He became Grand Wizard of the KKKK. A follower of Duke, [[Thomas Robb]], changed the title of [[Grand Wizard]] to National Director, and replaced the Klan's white robes with business suits.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Hatemongers Get a New Tailor.&quot; ''The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education.'' Winter 1996/1997.&lt;/ref&gt; Duke first received broad public attention during this time, as he endeavored to market himself in the mid-1970s as a new brand of Klansman: well-groomed, engaged, and professional. Duke also reformed the organization, promoting nonviolence and legality, and, for the first time in the Klan's history, women were accepted as equal members and [[Catholic]]s were encouraged to apply for membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Photo of David Duke at a Klan cross lighting ceremony|url=http://www.aliciapatterson.org/APF1503/Berry/Berry01.jpg|accessdate=2006-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Duke would repeatedly insist that the Klan was &quot;not anti-black&quot;, but rather &quot;pro-white&quot; and &quot;pro-Christian.&quot;

===NAAWP===
In 1980, Duke left the Klan and formed the [[National Association for the Advancement of White People]] (NAAWP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=David Duke to Leave Klan|date=1980-07-25|publisher=St. Petersburg Times|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6WlQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=c1oDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3031,820625&amp;dq=national-association-for-the-advancement-of-white-people&amp;hl=en| accessdate=2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 2004, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) became outraged when it discovered that David Duke had chosen [[New Orleans]] to host his International NAAWP Conference during the NAACP's Big Easy Rally to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the ''[[Brown v.

===Stormfront===
In 1995, [[Don Black (white nationalist)|Don Black]] and Chloê Hardin, Duke's ex-wife, began a small [[bulletin board system]] (BBS) called [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]]. Today, Stormfront has become a prominent online forum for [[white nationalism]], [[Neo-Nazism]], [[hate speech]] and [[racism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailykos.com/story/2005/12/5/143556/393 &quot;RedState, White Supremacy, and Responsibility&quot;], ''[[Daily Kos]]'', December 5, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FOX&quot;&gt;[[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,86338,00.html &quot;Circling the Wagons in Georgia&quot;], ''[[Fox News Channel]]'', May 8, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/decisions/html/2001/dtv2001-0023.html |title=WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Center: Case No. DTV2001-0023 |publisher= World Intellectual Property Organization |date=January 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke has an account on Stormfront which he uses to post articles from his own website, www.davidduke.com, as well as polling forum members for opinions and questions, in particular during his internet broadcasts.

==New Orleans Protocol==
Shortly after his release from prison for tax fraud in 2004, Duke organized a weekend gathering of &quot;European Nationalists&quot;, in the vein of white nationalism, in [[Kenner, Louisiana]]. In an attempt to overcome the splintering and division that had followed the death of [[William Luther Pierce|William Pierce]] in 2002, he presented a unity proposal for peace within the movement and a better image amongst outsiders. His proposal was accepted and is now known as the ''New Orleans Protocol'' (NOP). It pledges adherents to a pan-European outlook, recognizing national and ethnic allegiance, but stressing the value of all European peoples. Signed by and sponsored by a number of white supremacist leaders and organisations, it has three provisions:&lt;ref name=SPLC-2004&gt;{{cite web |title=Freed from prison, David Duke mounts a comeback |url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=477 |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] Intelligence Report, Summer 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The New Orleans Protocol | publisher=[[Canadian Heritage Alliance]] website |url=http://google.com/search?q=cache:T64eYPcPncgJ:www.canadianheritagealliance.com/about-us/new-orleans-protocol.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#&quot;Zero tolerance for violence.&quot;
#&quot;Honorable and ethical behavior in relations with other signatory groups. This includes not denouncing others who have signed this protocol. In other words, no enemies on the right.&quot;
#&quot;Maintaining a high tone in our arguments and public presentations.&quot;

The [[Southern Poverty Law Center|SPLC]] noted that the 'high tone' contrasted with statements at the even where the pact was signed such as Paul Fromm's calling a Muslim woman &quot;a hag in a bag&quot; and Sam Dickson (from the [[Council of Conservative Citizens]], another sponsor) speaking &quot;about the &quot;very, very destructive&quot; effect of opposing the Nazis in World War II — opposition that caused people to view Hitler's &quot;normal, healthy racial values&quot; as evil.&quot;&lt;ref name=SPLC-2004&gt;{{cite web |title=Freed from prison, David Duke mounts a comeback |url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=477 |publisher=[[Southern Poverty Law Center]] Intelligence Report, Summer 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who signed the pact on May 29, 2004 include Duke, [[Paul Fromm (activist)|Paul Fromm]], [[Don Black (white nationalist)|Don Black]], [[Willis Carto]] (whose holocaust-denying ''[[Barnes Review]]'' helped sponsor the event), [[Kevin Alfred Strom]], and [[John Tyndall (politician)|John Tyndall]] (signing as an individual, not on behalf of his [[British National Party]]).&lt;ref name=SPLC-2004/&gt; It was also adopted by the [[white supremacist]] [[Canadian Heritage Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canadianheritagealliance.com/portal/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=20&amp;Itemid=27 ]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on the protocol, one author noted that &quot;the New Orleans Protocol particularly emphasized the Jewish role in deliberately encouraging miscegenation to weaken the white race. In other words, miscegenation was viewed not only as bad in itself, but also as a weapon of the international Jewish conspiracy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dienel|first=Hans-Liudger|title=Terrorism and the Internet: Threats - Target Groups - Deradicalisation Strategies|year=2010|publisher=IOS Press|isbn=978-1607505365|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publications ==
===Finders-Keepers===
Duke wrote a [[self-help]] book for women to raise money under the [[pseudonym]] Dorothy Vanderbilt and James Konrad, titled ''Finders-Keepers – Finding and Keeping the Man You Want'' which contains sexual, diet, fashion, cosmetic and relationship advice, published by Arlington Place Books in 1976. Professor Lawrence N. Powell, who read a rare copy of the book given to him by Patsy Sims, wrote that it includes advice on vaginal exercises, [[fellatio]], and [[anal sex]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cjr&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Amend | first = Jeanne W. | title = The Picayune Catches Up With David Duke | month = January/February | year = 1992 | publisher = Columbia Journalism Review | url = https://www.entrepreneur.com/tradejournals/article/11886935.html | accessdate = 2009-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;adl_dukeprofile&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = David Duke | publisher = Anti-Defamation League | url = http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/duke.asp | accessdate = 2006-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = UNC Press | isbn = 0-8078-5374-7, 9780807853740 | page = 616 | page = 448 | last = Powell | first = Lawrence N. | title = Troubled Memory | year = 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is out of print and difficult to find; however, according to Tyler Bridges, ''[[The Times-Picayune]]'' obtained a copy and traced its proceeds to Duke&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Duke Paints a Dark Picture of Jews|last=Bridges|first=Tyler|date=August 26, 1990|work=[[The Times-Picayune]]|pages=A7}}&lt;/ref&gt; who compiled the information from women's self-help magazines.&lt;ref name=&quot;rise&quot; /&gt;

===My Awakening===
Duke published his autobiography ''My Awakening: A Path to Racial Understanding'' in 1998. The book details Duke's social philosophies, especially his reasoning behind [[Racial segregation|racial separation]]. In the book, Duke says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;We (Whites) desire to live in our own neighborhoods, go to our own schools, work in our own cities and towns, and ultimately live as one extended family in our own nation. We shall end the racial genocide of integration. We shall work for the eventual establishment of a separate homeland for African Americans, so each race will be free to pursue its own destiny without racial conflicts and ill will.&lt;ref name=&quot;duke_ma_39&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL) book review refers to it as containing racist, antisemitic, sexist and homophobic views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Foxman | first = Abraham | title = David Duke's My Awakening: A Minor League Mein Kampf | month = January | year = 1999 | publisher = Anti-Defamation League | url = http://www.adl.org/opinion/david_duke_review.asp | accessdate = 2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To raise the money to re-publish a new, updated edition of ''My Awakening'', Duke instigated a 21-day fundraising drive on November 26, 2007 where he had to raise &quot;$25,344 by a December 17 deadline for the printers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidduke.com/general/day-1-of-the-21-day-fundraising-drive-for-the-new-updated-edition-of-my-awakening_3162.html The Official Website of Representative David Duke, PhD » Day 1 of the 21 Day Fundraising Drive for the New, Updated Edition of My Awakening]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duke states this drive is necessary because the work &quot;has become the most important book in the entire world in the effort to awaken our people for our heritage and freedom.&quot;

===Jewish Supremacism===
[[File:David Duke and Udo Voigt (2002) cropped.jpg|right|thumb| David Duke (right) and [[Udo Voigt]] (left), the leader of the [[National Democratic Party of Germany]] (NPD), shaking hands.]]

In 2002, Duke traveled to [[Eastern Europe]] to promote his book, ''Jewish Supremacism: My Awakening on the Jewish Question'' in Russia in 2003. The book purports to &quot;examine and document elements of ethnic supremacism that have existed in the Jewish community from historical to modern times.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;duke_js_preface&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Duke|first=David|title=Jewish Supremacism: Author's Preface|date=2005-12-05|work=Jewish Supremacism|url=http://www.davidduke.com/index.php?p=129|accessdate=2006-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is dedicated to [[Israel Shahak]], a critical author of what Shahak saw as supremacist religious teachings in Jewish culture. Former [[Boris Yeltsin]] administration official and politician Boris Mironov wrote an introduction for the Russian edition, called ''The Jewish Question Through the Eyes of an American''. 

The ADL office in Moscow urged the Moscow prosecutor to open an investigation of Mironov. The ADL office initiated a letter from a prominent Duma member to Russia’s Prosecutor General [[Vladimir Ustinov]], urging a criminal case be opened against the author and the Russian publisher of Duke's book. The letter by Aleksandr Fedulov described the book as antisemitic and as violating Russian anti-hate crime laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/anti_semitism/duke_russia.asp David Duke in Russia]. Anti-Defamation League. Retrieved on November 16, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt; Around December 2001 Prosecutor's office closed the investigation of Boris Mironov and Jewish Supremacism. In a public letter, [[Yury Biryukov]], First Deputy of the Prosecutor General of the Russian Federation, stated that a socially-[[Psychological evaluation|psychological examination]], which was conducted as a part of the investigation, concluded that the book and the actions of Boris Mironov did not break Russian hate-crime laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panorama.ru/works/patr/govpol/gov/01/12/all.html &quot;Закрыто дело Миронова&quot;], Русский вестник, 2001-12-19. Retrieved on November 16, 2006. ('''Russian''')]&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke says his views had been &quot;vindicated&quot; with the publication of ''[[The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy]]'' by professors [[John Mearsheimer]] and [[Stephen Walt]], and said he was &quot;surprised how excellent [the paper] is&quot;. Duke dedicated several radio webcasts to the book and the authors comparing it to his work ''Jewish Supremacism'',&lt;ref&gt;Duke, David.

Duke says that his books &quot;have become two of the two most influential and important books in the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DavidDuke-1957&quot;/&gt; The ADL refer to the book as antisemitic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/learn/extremism_in_the_news/White_Supremacy/new_orleans_052005.htm |title=David Duke's European American Conference: Racists Gather in New Orleans |publisher=ADL |date= |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; though Duke had denied the book is motivated by [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;Duke, David.[http://www.davidduke.com/index.php?p=129 ''Jewish Supremacism'': Author's Preface]&lt;/ref&gt; At one time, the book was sold in the main lobby of the building of Russian State [[Duma]] (lower house of parliament). The first printing of 5,000 copies sold out in several weeks.

In 2004, the book was published in the United States. Originally published in English and Russian, the book has subsequently been translated internationally into Swedish, [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Persian language|Persian]], Hungarian, Spanish.&lt;ref name=&quot;DavidDuke-1957&quot;&gt;[http://www.davidduke.com/general/1957_1957.html The Official Website of Representative David Duke]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most recently (2010) into  [[Finnish language|Finnish]] (ISBN 978-952-92-8137-4).

==Internet commentary==

On February 5, 2002, Duke said, on his [[Internet]] radio show, that [[Ariel Sharon]] was &quot;the world's worst terrorist&quot; and that [[Mossad]] was involved in the [[September 11 attacks]]. The broadcast said that [[Zionism|Zionists]] were behind the attacks in order to reduce sympathy for [[Muslim]] nations in the West, and that the number of Israelis killed in the attack was lower than it would be under normal circumstances, citing early assessments by ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'' and &quot;the legendary involvement of Israeli nationals in businesses at the [[World Trade Center]]&quot;. According to Duke, this indicated that Israeli security services had prior knowledge of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidduke.com/?p=114&amp;page=1 Ariel Sharon: The terrorist behind the 9-11 Attack!] by David Duke&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, 2009, Duke repeatedly called [[MSNBC]] pundit [[Keith Olbermann]] &quot;[[untermensch]]&quot; on his radio show in response to being labeled &quot;Worst Person in the World&quot; on ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stormfront.org/audio/stormfront_radio-dr_david_duke_and_don_black-02-04-09.mp3&lt;/ref&gt;

== Public appearances ==
=== Public address in Syria ===
On November 24, 2005, Duke visited [[Damascus]], [[Syria]], addressing a rally which was broadcast on Syrian television, and later giving an interview.&lt;ref name=&quot;memritv&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memritv.org/Transcript.asp?P1=941 |title=American White Supremacist David Duke: Israel Makes the Nazi State Look Very Moderate. interview with David Duke on Syrian television |publisher=Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) |date= November 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.memritv.org/Search.asp?ACT=S1# |title=Clip of the interview and of Duke's speech to a Syrian rally |publisher=memritv.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the rally, he referred to [[Israel]] as a &quot;war-mongering country&quot; and stated that Zionists &quot;occupy most of the American media and now control much of the American government…It is not just the West Bank of Palestine, it is not just the Golan Heights that are occupied by the Zionists, but Washington D.C. and New York and London and many other capitals of the world.” He concluded by stating: &quot;Your fight for freedom is the same as our fight for freedom.” After speaking at the rally, Duke gave an interview where he said that Israel &quot;makes the [[Nazism|Nazi]] state look very, very moderate.&quot; Syrian parliament member Muhammad Habash later stated that Duke's visit gave Syrians a &quot;new and very positive view of the average American.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;memritv&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/news.php3?id=93809 David Duke in Syria: Zionists Occupy Washington, NY and London] by Ezra HaLevi, IsraelNationalNews.com, November 29, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whoknew.us/archives/images/david_duke_tv.jpg Screenshot] whoknew.us&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Comments in the media ===
Since 2005, Duke has appeared three times on ''Current Issues'', a [[Lafayette, Louisiana]]&amp;ndash;based television show hosted and produced by Palestinian-American [[Hesham Tillawi]], which has recently been picked up by Bridges TV. Show host Tillawi gave Duke the opportunity to discourse at length about his beliefs about Jewish supremacism. On a show in October 2005, Duke claimed that Jewish extremists are responsible for undermining the morality of America and are attempting to &quot;wash the world in blood.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/hesham_tillawi.asp?LEARN_Cat=Extremism&amp;LEARN_SubCat=Extremism_in_America&amp;xpicked=2&amp;item=tillawi Interview with David Duke] broadcast on “Bridges TV” network&lt;/ref&gt;

After John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt's paper on [[The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy|the Israel Lobby]] appeared in March 2006, Duke praised the paper in a number of articles on his website, on his March 18 Live Web Radio Broadcast, and on [[MSNBC]]'s March 21 ''[[Scarborough Country]]'' program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11959495/ 'Scarborough Country' for March 21], show transcript, ''MSNBC'', March 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The New York Sun]]'', Duke said in an email, &quot;It is quite satisfying to see a body in the premier American university essentially come out and validate every major point I have been making since even before the war even started.&quot; Duke added that &quot;the task before us is to wrest control of America's foreign policy and critical junctures of media from the [[Jew]]ish extremist [[Neoconservatism|Neocon]]s that seek to lead us into what they expectantly call World War IV.&quot;

=== Conferences ===
{{See also|International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust}}

Duke organized a gathering of European Nationalists who signed the New Orleans Protocol on May 29, 2004. The signatories agreed to avoid infighting among far-right [[Racialism (Racial categorization)|racialists]].

On June 3, 2005, Duke co-chaired a conference named &quot;Zionism As the Biggest Threat to Modern Civilization&quot; in Ukraine, sponsored by the Interregional Academy of Personnel Management. The conference was attended by several notable Ukrainian public figures and politicians, and writer [[Israel Shamir]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/NR/exeres/B74CD7C8-4878-4EF8-A8BA-AFA79C54AE9D,18AA02A5-13A1-44F3-B4D4-6176E1ECC36C,frameless.htm |title=David Duke participates in anti-Semitic conference in the Ukraine |publisher=Adl.org |date=2005-06-30 |accessdate=2012-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the weekend of June 8–10, 2006, Duke attended as a speaker at the international &quot;White World's Future&quot; conference in Moscow, which was coordinated and hosted by Pavel Tulaev.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidduke.com/?p=581 Historic Moscow Conference] davidduke.com&lt;/ref&gt; From December 11–13, he Duke attended the [[International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust]] in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]], opened by [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]], stating &quot;The Holocaust is the device used as the pillar of Zionist imperialism, Zionist aggression, Zionist terror and Zionist murder.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16149717/ &quot;Iranian leader says Israel will be ‘wiped out’: Ahmadinejad renews heated rhetoric at meeting of Holocaust deniers&quot;], ''[[Associated Press]]'', December 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Duke attended the conference, along with Gazi Hussein (Syria); Dr Rahmandost (conference chair, Society for Supporting People of Palestine); Jan Bernhoff, a Swedish computer science teacher who maintains that 300,000 Jews died during the Holocaust;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelocal.se/5797/20061214/ &quot;Swedish teacher at Holocaust denial conference&quot;], ''The Local'', December 14, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gerald Fredrick Töben|Fredrick Töben]], director of the [[Adelaide Institute]], Australia.

==Criticism and legal difficulties==

===Tax fraud conviction===
David Duke pleaded guilty to the felony charge of filing a false tax return under {{usc|26|7206}} and [[mail fraud]] under {{usc|18|1341}} in December 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;guilty&quot;&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2002-12-18-david-duke_x.htm David Duke pleads to mail fraud, tax charges] USA Today&lt;/ref&gt;

Four months later, Duke was sentenced to 15 months in prison, and he served the time in [[Big Spring, Texas]]. He was also fined US$10,000, ordered to cooperate with the [[Internal Revenue Service]], and to pay money still owed for his 1998 taxes. Following his release in May 2004, he stated that his decision to take the plea bargain was motivated by the bias that he perceived in the [[United States federal courts|United States federal court system]] and not his guilt. He said he felt the charges were contrived to derail his political career and discredit him to his followers, and that he took the safe route by pleading guilty and receiving a mitigated sentence, rather than pleading not guilty and potentially receiving the full sentence.

Duke pleaded guilty to what prosecutors described as a six-year scheme to dupe thousands of his followers by asking for donations. Through postal mail, Duke later appealed to his supporters that he was about to lose his house and his life savings. Prosecutors claimed that Duke raised hundreds of thousands of dollars in this campaign. Prosecutors also claimed he sold his home at a hefty profit, had multiple investment accounts, and spent much of his money gambling at casinos.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,80944,00.html David Duke Gets 15-Month Sentence for Fraud] FoxNews.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/12/18/national/main533483.shtml Ex-Klan Leader David Duke Indicted] CBSNews.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/LAW/12/18/duke.plea/index.html Duke pleads guilty to fraud, false tax claims] CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;
