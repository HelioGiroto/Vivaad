'''Sir James Paul McCartney''', [[Order of the British Empire|MBE]] (born 18 June 1942) is an English musician, singer, songwriter and composer. With [[John Lennon]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Ringo Starr]], he gained worldwide fame as a member of [[the Beatles]], and his [[Lennon-McCartney|collaboration with Lennon]] is one of the most celebrated songwriting partnerships of the 20th century. After [[The Beatles' break-up|the group's break-up]], he pursued a solo career, later forming the band [[Wings (band)|Wings]] with his first wife, [[Linda McCartney|Linda]], and singer-songwriter [[Denny Laine]].

''[[Guinness World Records]]'' described McCartney as the &quot;most successful composer and recording artist of all time&quot;, with 60 [[Music recording sales certification|gold discs]] and sales of over 100&amp;nbsp;million albums and 100&amp;nbsp;million [[Single (music)|singles]], and as the &quot;most successful songwriter&quot; in United Kingdom chart history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=388–389}}: &quot;most successful composer and recording artist of all time&quot;, 60 gold disks, 100&amp;nbsp;million albums and 100&amp;nbsp;million singles sold; {{harvnb|Glenday|2008|p=168}}: &quot;the most successful songwriter&quot; in UK chart history.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 2,200 artists have [[cover version|covered]] his Beatles song &quot;[[Yesterday]]&quot;, more than any other song in history. Wings' 1977 release &quot;[[Mull of Kintyre (song)|Mull of Kintyre]]&quot;, is one of the all-time best-selling singles in the UK. [[List of Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees#Performers|Inducted]] into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] as a solo artist in March 1999, McCartney has written, or co-written 32 songs that have reached number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]], and {{as of|2012|lc=y}} he has sold over 15.5&amp;nbsp;million [[RIAA]]-certified units in the United States.

McCartney has released an extensive catalogue of songs as a solo artist and has composed classical and electronic music. He has taken part in projects to promote international charities related to such subjects as [[animal rights]], [[seal hunting]], [[landmines]], [[vegetarianism]], poverty and [[music education]]. McCartney has married three times and is the father of five children.

== Childhood ==
{{main|Jim and Mary McCartney}}

McCartney was born on 18 June 1942, in [[Walton, Liverpool|Walton Hospital]], Liverpool, England, where his mother, Mary (née Mohin), had qualified to practise as a nurse. His father, James (&quot;Jim&quot;) McCartney, was absent from his son's birth due to his work as a volunteer firefighter during World War&amp;nbsp;II.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=75}} Paul has one younger brother, [[Mike McGear|Michael]] (born 7 January 1944). Though the children were baptised in their mother's Roman Catholic faith, their father, a former Protestant turned agnostic, felt Catholic schools sacrificed the education of their students for the sake of their religious teachings, so he and Mary did not emphasise religion in the household.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=4}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=1}}: (secondary source).&lt;/ref&gt;

McCartney attended Stockton Wood Road Primary School from 1947 until 1949, when he transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School due to overcrowding at Stockton.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=1}}: Transferred to Joseph Williams Junior School due to overcrowding at Stockton; {{harvnb|Carlin|2009|p=13}}: Transferred to Joseph Williams in 1949.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, he passed the [[11-plus]] exam, with only three others out of ninety examinees, gaining admission to the [[Liverpool Institute High School for Boys|Liverpool Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;For his attendance at Joseph Williams Junior School see: {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/merseyside/8203923.stm|title=Beatle's schoolboy photo auction |publisher=BBC News|date=16 August 2009|accessdate=13 June 2012}}; For McCartney passing the 11-plus exam see: {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=9}}: (primary source); {{harvnb|Benitez|2010|pp=1–2}}: (secondary source).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, he met schoolmate [[George Harrison]] on the bus to the Institute from his suburban home in [[Speke]]. Harrison had also passed the exam, meaning he could attend a [[grammar school]] rather than a [[secondary modern]] school, where most pupils went until becoming eligible to work. The two quickly became friends; McCartney later admitted: &quot;I tended to talk down to him, because he was a year younger.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=2}}: The two soon became friends, &quot;I tended to talk down to him, because he was a year younger&quot;; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|pp=82–83}}: On grammar school versus secondary modern, 125: On meeting Harrison.&lt;/ref&gt;

The family's primary wage earner, Mary's income as a [[Midwifery|midwife]] enabled them to move into [[20&amp;nbsp;Forthlin Road]] in [[Allerton, Merseyside|Allerton]], where they lived until 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=2}}: &quot;Mary was the family's primary wage earner&quot;; {{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=340–341}}: &quot;where they lived through 1964&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; She rode a bicycle to her patients; McCartney described an early memory of her leaving at &quot;about three in the morning [the] streets&amp;nbsp;... thick with snow&quot;.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=6}} On 31 October 1956, when McCartney was fourteen, his mother died of an [[embolism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=2}}: On Mary's death (secondary source); {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=20}}: On Mary's death (primary source).&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney's loss later became a point of connection with [[John Lennon]], whose mother, [[Julia Lennon|Julia]], had died when he was seventeen.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=31}}

A trumpet player and pianist who led Jim Mac's Jazz Band in the 1920s, McCartney's father kept an [[upright piano]] in the front room, and he encouraged his sons to be musical.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=22}}{{refn|group=nb|Jim McCartney's father Joe played an E-flat [[tuba]].{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=71}} He pointed out the bass parts in songs on the radio, and often took his sons to local [[brass band]] concerts.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=23–24}}}} Jim gave Paul a nickel-plated trumpet for his fourteenth birthday, but when [[rock and roll]] became popular on [[Radio Luxembourg (English)|Radio Luxembourg]], Paul traded it for a £15 [[Framus]] Zenith (model&amp;nbsp;17) [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]], rationalising that it would be difficult to sing while playing a trumpet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=21}}: Jim gave McCartney a nickel-plated trumpet which was later traded for a Zenith acoustic guitar; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=86}}: when rock and roll became popular on Radio Luxembourg.&lt;/ref&gt; He found it difficult to play guitar right-handed, but after noticing a poster advertising a [[Slim Whitman]] concert and realising that Whitman also played left-handed, he reversed the order of the strings.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=21}}
McCartney wrote his first song, &quot;[[I Lost My Little Girl]]&quot;, on the Zenith, and composed another early tune that would become &quot;[[When I'm Sixty-Four]]&quot; on the piano. Against his father's advice, he took few piano lessons, preferring to learn [[Learning music by ear|by ear]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=22–23}} Heavily influenced by American [[rhythm and blues]] music, [[Little Richard]] was his schoolboy idol. &quot;[[Long Tall Sally]]&quot; was the first song McCartney performed in public, at a [[Butlins]] holiday camp talent competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=509}}: McCartney: &quot;The first song I ever sang in public was &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot;., 533–534: Harry: &quot;Long Tall Sally&quot;, was &quot;The first number Paul ever sang on stage&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|The Quarrymen}}
At the age of fifteen, McCartney met Lennon and his band, the Quarrymen, at the St Peter's Church Hall fête in [[Woolton]] on 6 July 1957.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=93}} The Quarrymen played a mix of rock and roll and [[skiffle]], a type of [[popular music]] with [[jazz]], [[blues music|blues]] and [[folk music|folk]] influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=95}}: &quot;The Quarrymen played a spirited set of songs—half skiffle, half rock 'n roll&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The band invited McCartney to join soon afterwards as a rhythm guitarist, and he formed a close working relationship with Lennon. Harrison joined in 1958 as lead guitarist, followed by Lennon's art school friend [[Stuart Sutcliffe]] on bass, in 1960.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=18}} By May 1960, the band had tried several names, including Beatals, Johnny and the Moondogs and the Silver Beetles.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=18–22}} They adopted the name the Beatles in August 1960 and recruited drummer [[Pete Best]] shortly before a five-engagement residency in [[Hamburg]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|pp=17–25}}

In 1965, the Beatles released the McCartney composition &quot;[[Yesterday (song)|Yesterday]]&quot;, featuring a [[string quartet]]. Included on the ''[[Help! (album)|Help!]]'' LP, the song was the group's first recorded use of classical music elements and their first recording that involved only a single band member.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Buk|1996|p=51}}: Their first recording that involved only a single band member; {{harvnb|Gould|2007|p=278}}: The group's first recorded use of classical music elements in their music.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Yesterday&quot; became the most covered song in popular music history.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=157–158}}: &quot;Yesterday&quot; as the most covered song in history.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, during recording sessions for the album ''[[Rubber Soul]]'', McCartney began to supplant Lennon as the dominant musical force in the band. [[Musicology|Musicologist]] [[Ian MacDonald]] wrote, &quot;from [1965]&amp;nbsp;... [McCartney] would be in the ascendant not only as a songwriter, but also as instrumentalist, arranger, producer, and ''de facto'' musical director&quot;.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=172}} Critics described ''Rubber Soul'' as a significant advance in the refinement and profundity of the band's music and lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Levy|2005|p=18}}: ''Rubber Soul'' is described by critics as an advancement of the band's music; {{harvnb|Brown|Gaines|2002|pp=181–82}}: As they explored facets of romance and philosophy in their lyrics.&lt;/ref&gt; Considered a high point in the Beatles catalogue, both Lennon and McCartney claimed lead authorship for the song, &quot;[[In My Life]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=169–170}}: &quot;In My Life&quot; as a highlight of the Beatles catalogue.; {{Harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=587}}: Both Lennon and McCartney have claimed lead authorship for &quot;In My Life&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney said of the album, &quot;we'd had our cute period, and now it was time to expand.&quot;{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=197}} Recording engineer [[Norman Smith (record producer)|Norman Smith]] stated that the ''Rubber Soul'' sessions exposed indications of increasing contention within the band: &quot;the clash between John and Paul was becoming obvious&amp;nbsp;... [and] as far as Paul was concerned, George [Harrison] could do no right—Paul was absolutely finicky.&quot;{{sfn|Harry|2000b|p=780}}

In 1966, the Beatles released the album ''[[Revolver (album)|Revolver]]''. Featuring sophisticated lyrics, studio experimentation and an expanded repertoire of [[Music genre|musical genres]] ranging from innovative string arrangements to [[psychedelic rock]], the album marked an artistic leap for the Beatles.{{sfn|Gould|2007|p=348}} The first of three consecutive McCartney [[A-side and B-side|A-sides]], the single &quot;[[Paperback Writer]]&quot; preceded the LP's release.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=195}}: The first of three consecutive McCartney A-sides; {{harvnb|Lewisohn|1992|pp=350–351}}: ''Revolver''{{'}}s release was preceded by &quot;Paperback Writer&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Beatles produced a short promotional film for the song, and another for its B-side, &quot;[[Rain (The Beatles song)|Rain]]&quot;. The films, described by Harrison as &quot;the forerunner of [[music video|videos]]&quot;, aired on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in June 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|The Beatles|2000|p=214}}: &quot;the forerunner of videos&quot;; {{harvnb|Lewisohn|1992|pp=221–222}}: The films aired on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' and ''Top of the Pops''.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Revolver'' also included McCartney's &quot;[[Eleanor Rigby]]&quot;, which featured a [[Octet (music)|string octet]].

The Beatles gave their final commercial concert at the end of their [[The Beatles' 1966 US tour|1966 US tour]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=230}} Later that year, McCartney completed his first musical project apart from the group—a [[film score]] for the UK production ''[[The Family Way (soundtrack)|The Family Way]]''. The score was a collaboration with Martin, who used two McCartney themes to write thirteen variations. The soundtrack failed to chart, but it won McCartney an [[Ivor Novello Awards|Ivor Novello Award]] for Best Instrumental Theme.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=8}}

Upon the end of the band's performing career, McCartney sensed unease in the band and wanted them to maintain creative productivity. He pressed them to start a new project, which became ''[[Sgt.

== Musicianship ==
McCartney is largely a self-taught musician. [[Musicology|Musicologist]] [[Ian MacDonald]] described McCartney's approach as &quot;by nature drawn to music's formal aspects yet wholly untutored&amp;nbsp;... [he] produced technically 'finished' work almost entirely by instinct, his harmonic judgement based mainly on perfect pitch and an acute pair of ears ... [A] natural melodist—a creator of tunes capable of existing apart from their harmony&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=12}}: Natural melodist, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=13}}: Perfect pitch and an acute pair of ears.&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney commented, &quot;I prefer to think of my approach to music as&amp;nbsp;... rather like the primitive cave artists, who drew without training.&quot;{{sfn|Benitez|2010|p=134}}

=== Bass guitar ===

McCartney's skill as a bass player has been acknowledged by other bassists, including [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Dr. Dre]] bassist [[Mike Elizondo]], and [[Colin Moulding]] of [[XTC]].{{sfn|Bacon|Morgan|2006|p=8}} Known to play using a [[plectrum]] or [[Guitar pick|pick]] almost exclusively, McCartney only occasionally plays fingerstyle.{{sfn|Bacon|Morgan|2006|p=28}} He does not use [[slapping]] or muting techniques.{{sfn|Jisi|2005|p=42}} Strongly influenced by [[Motown]], in particular by [[James Jamerson]], McCartney called him a hero for his [[Melody|melodic]] style. Also influenced by [[Brian Wilson]], McCartney commented: &quot;because he went to very unusual places&quot;.{{sfn|Bacon|Morgan|2006|pp=38–39}} Another favourite bassist is [[Stanley Clarke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mulhern|1990|p=18}}: The influence of Motown and James Jamerson, {{harvnb|Mulhern|1990|p=22}}: Stanley Clarke.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|quote= &quot;Paul is one of the most innovative bass players ... half the stuff that's going on now is directly ripped off from his Beatles period ... He's an egomaniac about everything else, but his bass playing he'd always been a bit coy about.&quot;{{sfn|Sheff|Golson|1981|p=142}} |source= —Lennon, ''Playboy'' magazine, January 1981|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

During McCartney's early years with the Beatles, he primarily used a [[Höfner 500/1]] bass, though in 1965, he began sporadically using a [[Rickenbacker 4001]]S for recording. While typically using [[Vox (musical equipment)|Vox amplifiers]], by 1967 he had also begun using a [[Fender Bassman]] for amplification.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Babiuk|Bacon|2002|pp=16–17}}: Höfner 500/1, {{harvnb|Babiuk|Bacon|2002|pp=44–45}}: Rickenbacker 4001, {{harvnb|Babiuk|Bacon|2002|pp=85–86, 92–93, 103, 116, 134, 140, 173, 175, 187, 211}}: Vox amplifiers; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=298}}: Fender Bassman.&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1980s and early 1990s, he used a [[Wal (bass)|Wal 5-String]], which he said made him play more thick-sounding [[bassline]]s, in contrast to the much lighter Höfner, which inspired him to play more sensitively, something he considers fundamental to his playing style.{{sfn|Jisi|2005|p=42}} He changed back to the Höfner around 1990 for that reason.{{sfn|Jisi|2005|p=42}} He uses [[Mesa Boogie#Bass amps|Mesa Boogie]] bass amplifiers while performing live.{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=19}}

MacDonald identified &quot;[[She's a Woman]]&quot; as the point when McCartney's bass playing began to evolve dramatically, and Beatles biographer Chris Ingham singled out ''Rubber Soul'' as the moment when McCartney's playing exhibited significant progress, particularly on &quot;[[The Word (song)|The Word]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=133–134}}: &quot;She's a Woman&quot;; {{harvnb|Ingham|2009|p=299}}: &quot;began to come into its own&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon and Morgan agreed, calling McCartney's [[Groove (music)|groove]] on the track &quot;a high point in pop bass playing and ... the first proof on a recording of his serious technical ability on the instrument.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bacon|Morgan|2006|pp=10, 44}}: ''Rubber Soul'' as the starting point for McCartney's bass improvement, {{harvnb|Bacon|Morgan|2006|p=98}}: &quot;a high point in pop bass playing&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald inferred the influence of [[James Brown]]'s &quot;[[Papa's Got a Brand New Bag]]&quot; and Pickett's &quot;[[In the Midnight Hour]]&quot;, American [[Soul music|soul]] tracks from which McCartney absorbed elements and drew inspiration as he &quot;delivered his most spontaneous bass-part to date&quot;.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=178–180}}

Bacon and Morgan described his bassline for the Beatles song &quot;[[Rain (The Beatles song)|Rain]]&quot; as &quot;an astonishing piece of playing&amp;nbsp;... [McCartney] thinking in terms of both rhythm and 'lead bass'&amp;nbsp;... [choosing] the area of the neck&amp;nbsp;... he correctly perceives will give him clarity for melody without rendering his sound too thin for groove.&quot;{{sfn|Bacon|Morgan|2006|pp=112–113}} MacDonald considered the track the Beatles' best [[A-side and B-side|B-side]], stating that its &quot;clangorously saturated texture resonates around McCartney's [bassline]&quot;, which MacDonald described as &quot;so inventive that it threatens to overwhelm the track&quot;. MacDonald also indicated the influence of [[Indian classical music]] in &quot;exotic [[melisma]]s in the bass part&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=196–198}}: &quot;Rain&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney identified ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]'' as containing his strongest and most inventive bass playing, particularly on &quot;[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]&quot;.{{sfn|Jisi|2005|p=45–46}}

=== Acoustic guitar ===
{{quote box|quote= &quot;If I couldn't have any other instrument, I would have to have an acoustic guitar.&quot;{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=22}} |source= —McCartney, ''Guitar Player'', July 1990|width=25%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

McCartney primarily [[Flatpicking|flatpicks]] while playing [[acoustic guitar]], though he also uses elements of [[Fingerstyle guitar|fingerpicking]].{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=22}} Examples of his acoustic guitar playing on Beatles tracks include &quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot;, &quot;[[Michelle (song)|Michelle]]&quot;, &quot;[[Blackbird (song)|Blackbird]]&quot;, &quot;[[I Will (The Beatles song)|I Will]]&quot;, &quot;[[Mother Nature's Son]]&quot; and &quot;[[Rocky Raccoon]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=157–158}}: &quot;Yesterday&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=174–175}}: &quot;I'm Looking Through You&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=175–176}}: &quot;Michelle&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=291–292}}: &quot;Blackbird&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=305–306}}: &quot;Mother Nature's Son&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=308}}: &quot;Rocky Raccoon&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=315}}: &quot;I Will&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney singled out &quot;Blackbird&quot; as a personal favourite and described his technique for the guitar part in the following way: &quot;I got my own little sort of cheating way of [fingerpicking] ... I'm actually sort of pulling two strings at a time&amp;nbsp;... I was trying to emulate those [[Folk music|folk]] players.&quot;{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=22}} He employed a similar technique for &quot;[[Jenny Wren]]&quot;.{{sfn|Molenda|2005|p=79}} He played an [[Epiphone Texan]] on many of his acoustic recordings, but also used a [[D-28 guitar#Models|Martin D-28]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Babiuk|Bacon|2002|pp=146–147, 152, 161, 164}}: Epiphone Texan; {{harvnb|Babiuk|Bacon|2002|pp=215, 218, 222, 239}}: Martin D-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Electric guitar ===
{{quote box|quote= &quot;Linda was a big fan of my guitar playing, whereas I've got my doubts.

McCartney played lead electric guitar on several Beatles recordings, including what MacDonald described as a &quot;fiercely angular slide guitar solo&quot; on &quot;[[Drive My Car]]&quot;, which McCartney played on an [[Epiphone Casino]]. McCartney said of the instrument, &quot;if I had to pick one electric guitar it would be this.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Babiuk|Bacon|2002|p=149}}: &quot;If I had to pick one electric guitar&quot;; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=166–167}}: &quot;Drive My Car&quot;, &quot;fiercely angular slide guitar solo&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; He contributed what MacDonald described as &quot;a startling guitar solo&quot; on the Harrison composition &quot;[[Taxman]]&quot; and the &quot;shrieking&quot; guitar on &quot;Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; and &quot;[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]&quot;. MacDonald also praised McCartney's &quot;coruscating pseudo-Indian&quot; guitar solo on &quot;[[Good Morning Good Morning]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=200–201}}: &quot;Taxman&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=232–234}}: &quot;Sgt.

It was really my first voyage into [[Audio feedback#Deliberate uses|feedback]].&quot;{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=22}} In 1990, when asked who his favourite guitar players were he included [[Eddie Van Halen]], [[Eric Clapton]] and David Gilmour, stating, &quot;but I still like Hendrix the best.&quot;{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=22}} He has primarily used a [[Gibson Les Paul]] for electric work, particularly during live performances.{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=19}}

McCartney's vocals cross several [[Music genre|musical genres]]. On &quot;[[Call Me Back Again]]&quot;, according to Benitez, &quot;McCartney shines as a [[blues]]y solo vocalist&quot; while MacDonald called &quot;[[I'm Down]]&quot; &quot;a [[Rock and roll|rock-and-roll]] classic&quot; that &quot;illustrates McCartney's vocal and stylistic versatility&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=68}}: &quot;Call Me Back Again&quot;; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=156}}: &quot;I'm Down&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald described &quot;Helter Skelter&quot; as an early attempt at [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]], and &quot;Hey Jude&quot; as a &quot;[[Pop music|pop]]/rock hybrid&quot;, pointing out McCartney's &quot;use of [[Gospel music|gospel]]-style [[melisma]]s&quot; in the song and his &quot;pseudo-[[Soul music|soul]] shrieking in the fade-out&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=297–298}}: &quot;Helter Skelter&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=302–304}}: &quot;Hey Jude&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Benitez identified &quot;[[Hope of Deliverance]]&quot; and &quot;[[Put It There]]&quot; as examples of McCartney's folk music efforts while musicologist [[Walter Everett (musicologist)|Walter Everett]] considered &quot;[[When I'm Sixty-Four]]&quot; and &quot;[[Honey Pie]]&quot; attempts at [[vaudeville]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=128}}: &quot;Put It There&quot;, {{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=138}}: &quot;Hope of Deliverance&quot;; {{harvnb|Everett|1999|pp=112–113}}: &quot;When I'm Sixty-Four&quot;, {{harvnb|Everett|1999|pp=189–190}}: &quot;Honey Pie&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald praised the &quot;[[Swing music|swinging]] beat&quot; of the Beatles' [[Twelve-bar blues|twenty-four bar blues]] song, &quot;She's a Woman&quot; as &quot;the most extreme sound they had manufactured to date&quot;, with McCartney's voice &quot;at the edge, squeezed to the upper limit of his chest register and threatening to crack at any moment.&quot;{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|pp=133–134}} MacDonald described &quot;[[I've Got a Feeling]]&quot; as a &quot;raunchy, mid-tempo rocker&quot; with a &quot;robust and soulful&quot; vocal performance and &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot; as &quot;the last of [the Beatles'] up-tempo rockers&quot;, McCartney's &quot;[[Belting (music)|belting]]&quot; vocals among his best since &quot;Drive My Car&quot;, recorded three years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=309–310}}: &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R&quot;., {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=332}}: &quot;I've Got a Feeling&quot;, a &quot;raunchy, mid-tempo rocker&quot; with a &quot;robust and soulful&quot; performance.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Keyboards ===
McCartney played piano on several Beatles songs, including &quot;[[Every Little Thing (song)|Every Little Thing]]&quot;, &quot;She's a Woman&quot;, &quot;[[For No One]]&quot;, &quot;[[A Day in the Life]]&quot;, &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Hey Jude&quot;, &quot;[[Lady Madonna]]&quot;, &quot;Let It Be&quot; and &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=128–129}}: &quot;Every Little Thing&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=178–180}}: &quot;She's a Woman&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=205–206}}: &quot;For No One&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=227–232}}: &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=272–273}}: &quot;Hello, Goodbye&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=275–276}}: &quot;Lady Madonna&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=337–338}}: &quot;Let It Be&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=239–241}}: &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=302–304}}: &quot;Hey Jude&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald considered the piano part in &quot;Lady Madonna&quot; as reminiscent of [[Fats Domino]], and &quot;Let It Be&quot; as having a gospel rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=275–276}}: &quot;Lady Madonna&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=337–338}}: &quot;Let It Be&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; MacDonald called McCartney's [[Mellotron]] intro on &quot;[[Strawberry Fields Forever]]&quot; an integral feature of the song's character.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=219}} McCartney played a [[Moog synthesizer]] on the Beatles song &quot;[[Maxwell's Silver Hammer]]&quot; and the Wings track &quot;Loup (1st Indian on the Moon)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=357}}: &quot;Maxwell's Silver Hammer&quot;; {{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=46}}: &quot;Loup (1st Indian on the Moon)&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Ingham described the Wings songs &quot;[[With a Little Luck]]&quot; and &quot;[[London Town (Wings song)|London Town]]&quot; as &quot;full of the most sensitive pop synthesizer touches&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ingham|2009|p=117}}: &quot;the most sensitive pop synthesizer touches&quot;; {{harvnb|Blaney|2007|p=123}}: McCartney playing keyboards on &quot;London Town&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

McCartney played drums on the Beatles songs &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot;, &quot;[[Dear Prudence]]&quot;, &quot;[[Martha My Dear]]&quot;, &quot;[[Wild Honey Pie]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Ballad of John and Yoko]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=309}}: &quot;Wild Honey Pie&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=309–310}}: &quot;Back in the USSR&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=310–311}}: &quot;Dear Prudence&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=322}}: &quot;Martha My Dear&quot;, {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=345–347}}: &quot;The Ballad of John and Yoko&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; He also played all the drum parts on his first and second solo albums ''McCartney'' and ''McCartney II'', as well as on the Wings album ''Band on the Run'' and most of the drums on his solo LP ''Chaos and Creation in the Backyard''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=19}}: ''McCartney'', {{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=52}}: ''Band on the Run'', {{harvnb|Benitez|2010|p=99}}: ''McCartney II''; {{harvnb|Molenda|2005|pp=68–70}}: he played most of the instrumentation himself.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tape loops ===
In the mid-1960s, when visiting artist friend [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]]'s flat in London, McCartney brought [[Magnetic tape|tapes]] he had compiled at then-girlfriend [[Jane Asher]]'s home. They included mixes of various songs, musical pieces and comments made by McCartney that [[Dick James]] made into a demo for him.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=217–218}} Heavily influenced by American [[avant-garde]] musician [[John Cage]], McCartney made [[tape loops]] by recording voices, guitars and bongos on a [[Brenell Engineering Ltd.|Brenell]] [[Reel-to-reel audio tape recording|tape recorder]] and splicing the various loops. He referred to the finished product as &quot;electronic symphonies&quot;.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=219–220}} He reversed the tapes, and speeded them up and slowed them down to create the effects he wanted, some of which the Beatles later used on the songs &quot;[[Tomorrow Never Knows]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Fool on the Hill]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=185–193}}: Tape loops used on &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot;; {{Harvnb|Everett|1999|pp=138–139}}: Tape loops used on &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pepper'' cover, McCartney replied, &quot;Elvis was too important and too far above the rest even to mention ... so we didn't put him on the list because he was more than merely a ... pop singer, he was Elvis the King.&quot;{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=727}} McCartney stated that for his bassline for &quot;[[I Saw Her Standing There]]&quot;, he directly quoted Berry's &quot;[[I'm Talking About You]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|pp=66–67}}: &quot;According to McCartney, the bassline was taken from&amp;nbsp;&quot;...I'm Talking About You&quot;; {{harvnb|Mulhern|1990|p=18}}: McCartney: &quot;I'm not gonna tell you I wrote the thing when Chuck Berry's bass player did; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=94}}: McCartney: &quot;I played exactly the same notes as he did and it fitted our number perfectly&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

McCartney called Little Richard an idol, whose [[falsetto]] [[Vocal music|vocalizations]] inspired McCartney's own vocal technique.{{sfn|Mulhern|1990|p=33}} McCartney said he wrote &quot;I'm Down&quot; as a vehicle for his Little Richard impersonation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=156}}: (secondary source); {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=201}}: (primary source).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, McCartney bought the publishing rights to Holly's catalogue, and in 1976, on the fortieth anniversary of Holly's birth, McCartney inaugurated the annual &quot;Buddy Holly Week&quot; in England. The festival has included guest performances by famous musicians, songwriting competitions, drawing contests and special events featuring performances by [[the Crickets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=420–425}}: &quot;Buddy Holly Week&quot; 1976–2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

While at school during the 1950s, McCartney thrived at art assignments, often earning top accolades for his visual work. However, his lack of discipline negatively affected his academic grades, preventing him from earning admission to art college.{{sfn|Carlin|2009|pp=44–45}} During the 1960s, he delved into the visual arts, explored experimental cinema, and regularly attended film, theatrical and classical music performances. His first contact with the London [[avant-garde]] scene was through artist [[John Dunbar (artist)|John Dunbar]], who introduced McCartney to art dealer [[Robert Fraser (art dealer)|Robert Fraser]].{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=307}} At Fraser's flat he first learned about art appreciation and met [[Andy Warhol]], [[Claes Oldenburg]], [[Peter Blake (artist)|Peter Blake]], and [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=243}} McCartney later purchased works by [[Magritte]], using his painting of an apple for the [[Apple Records]] logo.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=256–267}} McCartney became involved in the renovation and publicising of the [[Indica Gallery]] in Mason's Yard, London, which [[Barry Miles]] had co-founded and where Lennon first met [[Yoko Ono]]. Miles also co-founded ''[[International Times]]'', an underground paper that McCartney helped to start with direct financial support and by providing interviews to attract advertiser income. Miles later wrote McCartney's official biography, ''[[Many Years From Now]]'' (1997).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2000a|pp=549–550}}: Indica Gallery renovation and Lennon meeting Ono; {{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=549–550}}: Miles as McCartney's official biographer; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|pp=232, 237–238}}: Barry Miles and ''IT''.&lt;/ref&gt;

McCartney became interested in painting after watching artist [[Willem de Kooning]] work in de Kooning's [[Long Island]] studio.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=84}} McCartney took up painting in 1983, and he first exhibited his work in [[Siegen]], Germany, in 1999. The 70-painting show featured portraits of Lennon, [[Andy Warhol]] and [[David Bowie]].{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=266}} Though initially reluctant to display his paintings publicly, McCartney chose the gallery because events organiser Wolfgang Suttner showed genuine interest in McCartney's art.{{sfn|Sounes|2010|p=453}} In September 2000, the first UK exhibition of McCartney's paintings opened, featuring 500 canvases at the [[Arnolfini|Arnolfini Gallery]] in Bristol, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/946175.stm|title=McCartney art makes UK debut|publisher=BBC News|date=29 September 2000|accessdate=30 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2000, McCartney's art débuted in his hometown of Liverpool.

McCartney's music has appeared on several [[record label]]s. In January 1962, [[Polydor Records]] issued the first commercially released recording of the Beatles, a single called &quot;[[My Bonnie]]&quot;. Credited to [[Tony Sheridan]] and the Beat Brothers, [[Decca Records]] issued the track in the UK in April 1962. The following year, [[Parlophone]] released the band's singles &quot;[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]&quot;/&quot;[[Ask Me Why]]&quot; and &quot;[[From Me to You]]&quot;/&quot;[[Thank You Girl]]&quot; in the UK. [[Vee-Jay Records]] released them in the US. Also that year, [[Swan Records (jazz label)|Swan Records]] released the group's UK Parlophone single &quot;She Loves You&quot;/&quot;[[I'll Get You]]&quot; in the US. From then until July 1968, [[EMI]]'s [[Capitol Records|Capitol]] (US) and Parlophone (UK) labels released the band's music. Starting with the August 1968 release &quot;[[Hey Jude]]&quot;/&quot;[[Revolution (song)|Revolution]]&quot;, their new material would be issued with Apple [[label]]s, logos and sleeves, but with Parlophone or Capitol serial numbers.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=350–351}} Following the break-up of the Beatles, McCartney's music continued to be released by Apple Records under the Beatles' 1967 recording contract with EMI which ran until 1976. Following the formal dissolution of the Beatles' partnership in 1975, McCartney re-signed with EMI worldwide and Capitol in the US and Canada. In 1979, McCartney signed with [[Columbia Records]] in the US and Canada reportedly receiving the industry's most lucrative recording contract to date, while remaining with EMI for distribution throughout the rest of the world.{{sfn|McGee|2003|pp=125–126}} McCartney returned to Capitol in 1985 and from 1985 until 2006, Parlophone released McCartney's music in the UK and Capitol in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blaney 2007 287–297&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Blaney|2007|pp=287–297}}: McCartney's discography, with release label detail; {{harvnb|Roberts|2005|pp=311–312}}: McCartney discography with release label detail.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, McCartney signed with [[Hear Music]], becoming the label's first artist.

In 1963, [[Dick James]] established [[Northern Songs]] to publish the songs of Lennon–McCartney.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=365}} McCartney initially owned 20% of Northern Songs, which became 15% after a public stock offering in 1965. In 1969, James sold a controlling interest in Northern Songs to [[Lew Grade]]'s [[Associated Television]] (ATV) after which McCartney and John Lennon sold their remaining shares although they remained under contract to ATV until 1973. In 1972, McCartney re-signed with ATV for seven years in a joint publishing agreement between ATV and [[MPL Communications|McCartney Music]]. Since 1979, MPL Communications has published McCartney's songs. McCartney and [[Yoko Ono]] attempted to purchase the Northern Songs catalogue in 1981, but Grade declined their offer and decided to sell ATV in its entirety to businessman [[Robert Holmes à Court]]. [[Michael Jackson]] subsequently purchased ATV in 1985. In 1995, Jackson merged his catalogue with Sony for a reported £59,052,000 ($95&amp;nbsp;million), establishing Sony/ATV Music Publishing, in which he retained half-ownership.&lt;ref name=&quot;JacksonBailout&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/13/business/media/13music.html?ex=1302580800&amp;en=45bff2f7a4da68fe&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |title=Michael Jackson Bailout Said to Be Close |first=Jeff |last=Leeds |first2=Andrew Ross |last2=Sorkin |work=New York Times |date=13 April 2006 |accessdate=26 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney has criticised Jackson's purchase and handling of Northern Songs over the years.

=== Drugs ===

McCartney first used drugs in the Beatles' [[Hamburg]] days, when they often used [[Preludin]] to maintain their energy while performing for long periods.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=66–67}} [[Bob Dylan]] introduced them to [[cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] in a New York hotel room in 1964; McCartney recalls getting &quot;very high&quot; and &quot;giggling uncontrollably&quot;.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=186–189}} His use of the drug soon became habitual, and according to Miles, McCartney wrote the lyrics &quot;another kind of mind&quot; in &quot;[[Got to Get You into My Life]]&quot; specifically as a reference to cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=182}}: Habitual marijuana use by McCartney and the Beatles; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=190}}: Marijuana references in Beatles songs.&lt;/ref&gt; During the filming of ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'', McCartney occasionally smoked a [[Joint (cannabis)|joint]] in the car on the way to the studio during filming, and often forgot his lines.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=67–68}} Director [[Richard Lester]] overheard two physically attractive women trying to persuade McCartney to use heroin, but he refused.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=67–68}} Introduced to [[cocaine]] by Robert Fraser, McCartney used the drug regularly during the recording of ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'', and for about a year total but stopped because of his dislike of the unpleasant melancholy he felt afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=247}}: Cocaine use during ''Sgt. Pepper'' recording sessions; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|pp=384–385}}: McCartney used the drug for about a year then stopped.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially reluctant to try [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]], McCartney eventually did so in late 1966, and took his second &quot;[[Psychedelic experience|acid trip]]&quot; in March 1967, with Lennon, after a ''Sgt. Pepper'' studio session.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miles|1997|pp=379–380}}: First LSD &quot;trip&quot;, {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=382}}: Second LSD &quot;trip&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; He later became the first Beatle to discuss the drug publicly, declaring, &quot;It opened my eyes... [and] made me a better, more honest, more tolerant member of society.&quot;{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=228}} He made his attitude about cannabis public in 1967, when he, along with the other Beatles and Epstein, added his name to a July advertisement in ''The Times'', which called for its legalisation, the release of those imprisoned for possession, and research into marijuana's medical uses.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=386–387}}

In 1972, a Swedish court fined McCartney £1,000 for cannabis possession. Soon after, Scottish police found marijuana plants growing on his farm, leading to his 1973 conviction for [[Cannabis cultivation|illegal cultivation]] and a £100 fine. As a result of his drug convictions, the US government repeatedly denied him a visa until December 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=300–307}}: Drugs.&lt;/ref&gt; Arrested again for marijuana possession in 1975, in Los Angeles, Linda took the blame, and the court soon dismissed the charges. In January 1980, when Wings flew to Tokyo for a tour of Japan, customs officials found approximately 8&amp;nbsp;ounces (200&amp;nbsp;g) of cannabis in his luggage. They arrested McCartney and brought him to a local jail while the Japanese government decided what to do. After ten days, they released and deported him without charge.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=459–461}} In 1984, while on holiday in [[Barbados]], authorities arrested McCartney for possession of marijuana and fined him $200.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=300–307}} Upon his return to England, he stated: &quot;cannabis is ... less harmful than rum punch, whiskey, nicotine and glue, all of which are perfectly legal&amp;nbsp;... I don't think&amp;nbsp;... I was doing anyone any harm whatsoever.&quot;{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=306}} In 1997, he spoke out in support of decriminalisation of the drug: &quot;People are smoking pot anyway and to make them criminals is wrong.&quot;{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=307}}

=== Vegetarianism and activism ===

His eyes are closed.|McCartney in Prague, 2004]]

Paul and Linda were vegetarians for most of their 30-year marriage. They decided to stop consuming meat after Paul saw lambs in a field as they were eating a meal of lamb. Soon after, the couple became outspoken [[animal rights]] activists.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=880–882}} In his first interview after Linda's death, he promised to continue working for animal rights, and in 1999 he spent £3,000,000 to ensure [[Linda McCartney Foods]] remained free of [[Genetic engineering|genetically engineered]] ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;For McCartney's pledge to continue Linda's animal rights work see: {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/145974.stm |title=McCartney vows to keep animal rights torch alight |publisher=BBC News |date=5 August 1998 |accessdate=29 January 2007}}; For McCartney ensuring that Linda McCartney Foods remained GMO free, see: {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/365947.stm |title=GM-free ingredients |publisher=BBC News |date=10 June 1999 | accessdate=3 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, he narrated the documentary ''[[Devour the Earth]]'', written by [[Tony Wardle]].{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}

Following McCartney's marriage to Mills, he joined her in a campaign against [[landmine]]s, becoming a patron of [[Adopt-A-Minefield]]. He wore an anti-landmines T-shirt during some of the Back in the World tour shows.&lt;ref&gt;For McCartney becoming a patron of Adopt-A-Minefield see: {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1287128.stm |title=McCartney calls for landmine ban |publisher=BBC News |date=20 April 2001 | accessdate=3 January 2010}}; For McCartney wearing an anti-landmines T-shirt during the Back in the World tour see: {{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-538255/McCartney-divorce-battle-The-judgement-2.html |title=McCartney divorce battle: The full judgement part 2 |work=Daily Mail |date=18 March 2008 |accessdate=12 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the McCartneys travelled to [[Prince Edward Island]] to raise international awareness of [[seal hunt]]ing. The couple debated with [[Danny Williams (politician)|Danny Williams]], Newfoundland's then Premier, on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', stating that fishermen should stop hunting seals and start seal-watching businesses instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0603/03/lkl.01.html |title=Interview transcript, McCartney and Heather, Larry King Live, Seal cull |publisher=CNN |date=3 March 2006 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCartney also supports the [[Make Poverty History]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.makepovertyhistory.org/index.shtml?entry=cornerwhitebandsmallright&amp;referrer=www.paulmccartney.com |title=Make Poverty History |accessdate=2 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCartney has participated in several charity recordings and performances, including the [[Concerts for the People of Kampuchea]], [[Ferry Aid]], [[Band Aid (band)|Band Aid]], [[Live Aid]] and the recording of &quot;[[Ferry Cross the Mersey]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=270}}: Concerts for the People of Kampuchea, 327–328: &quot;Ferry Cross the Mersey&quot;, 514–515: Live Aid; {{harvnb|Roberts|2005|pp=49}}: Band Aid &amp; Band Aid 20, 187: Ferry Aid.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he donated a song to an album to aid the &quot;US Campaign for Burma&quot;, in support of Burmese Nobel Prize winner [[Aung San Suu Kyi]]. In 2008, he donated a song to [[Aid Still Required|Aid Still Required's]] CD, organised as an effort to raise funds to assist with the recovery from the devastation caused in Southeast Asia by the 2004 tsunami.&lt;ref&gt;For the &quot;US Campaign for Burma&quot; see: {{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4110628.stm |title=US campaign for Burma protest |publisher=BBC News |date=20 June 2005 | accessdate=5 May 2012}}; For the ''Aid Still Required'' CD see: {{cite web|url=http://aidstillrequired.org/music|title=Aid Still Required|publisher=Aid Still Required|accessdate=3 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, McCartney wrote to [[14th Dalai Lama|Tenzin Gyatso]], the 14th [[Dalai Lama]], asking him why he was not a vegetarian. As McCartney explained, &quot;He wrote back very kindly, saying, my doctors tell me that I must eat meat. And I wrote back again, saying, you know, I don't think that's right&amp;nbsp;... I think he's now being told&amp;nbsp;... that he can get his protein somewhere else&amp;nbsp;... It just doesn't seem right&amp;nbsp;– the Dalai Lama, on the one hand, saying, 'Hey guys, don't harm sentient beings&amp;nbsp;... Oh, and by the way, I'm having a steak.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/jul/18/paul-mccartney-vegetarianism|title=Interview: Paul McCartney|last=Ellen|first=Barbara|date=17 July 2010|work=The Guardian|accessdate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meditation ===
In August 1967, McCartney met the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]] at the [[The London Hilton on Park Lane|London Hilton]], and later went to [[Bangor, Wales|Bangor]] in North Wales, to attend a weekend initiation conference, where he and the other Beatles learned the basics of [[Transcendental Meditation]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=261}} He explained, &quot;The whole meditation experience was very good and I still use the mantra&amp;nbsp;... I find it soothing&quot;.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=396}} In 2009, McCartney and Starr headlined a benefit concert at [[Radio City Music Hall]], raising three&amp;nbsp;million dollars for the [[David Lynch Foundation]] to fund instruction in Transcendental Meditation for at-risk youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/06/arts/music/06mcca.html |title=Just Say 'Om': The Fab Two Give a Little Help to a Cause |work=The New York Times |accessdate=17 July 2009 | first=Jon | last=Pareles | date=6 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Football ===
McCartney is an avid fan of [[Association football|football]], and has publicly professed support for [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], and also shown favour for [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool]].&lt;ref&gt;For McCartney's support of Everton, see: {{cite web|url= http://www.evertonfc.com/news/archive/macca-s-a-blue.html |title=Macca's a blue |work=Everton Football Club |accessdate=8 March 2010}}; For McCartney's support of Liverpool, see: {{cite web|url=http://stage.hn.haymarketnetwork.com/editorial/features/didthebeatleshidetheirfootballingloveaway.aspx |title=Did The Beatles Hide Their Footballing Love Away? |publisher=Haymarket Media Group|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, he ended speculation about his allegiance when he said, &quot;Here's the deal: my father was born in Everton, my family are officially Evertonians, so if it comes down to a derby match or an FA Cup final between the two, I would have to support Everton. But after a concert at Wembley Arena I got a bit of a friendship with Kenny Dalglish, who had been to the gig and I thought 'You know what? I am just going to support them both because it's all Liverpool.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prentice |first=David |url=http://www.evertonbanter.co.uk/2008/07/sir-paul-mccartneys-everton-se.html |work=Everton Banter |title=Sir Paul McCartney's Everton 'secret' was no surprise |date= 5 July 2008 | accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Girlfriends ===

==== Dot Rhone ====
McCartney's first serious girlfriend in Liverpool was Dot Rhone, whom he met at the [[The Casbah Coffee Club|Casbah club]] in 1959.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=163}} According to Spitz, Rhone felt that McCartney had a compulsion to control situations. He often chose clothes and make-up for her, encouraging her to grow her hair out like [[Brigitte Bardot]]'s, and at least once insisting she have it re-styled, to disappointing effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=69}}: Encouraging Rhone to grow her hair out like Bardot; {{harvnb|Spitz|2005|p=171}}: Rhone had her hair re-styled to disappointing effect.&lt;/ref&gt; When McCartney first went to Hamburg with the Beatles, he wrote to Rhone regularly, and she accompanied [[Cynthia Lennon]] to Hamburg when they played there again in 1962.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|pp=239–240}} The couple had a two-and-a-half-year relationship, and were due to marry until Rhone's miscarriage; according to Spitz, McCartney, now &quot;free of obligation&quot;, ended the engagement.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=348}}

==== Jane Asher ====
McCartney first met British actress [[Jane Asher]] on 18 April 1963, when a photographer asked them to pose at a Beatles performance at the [[Royal Albert Hall]] in London.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=101–102}} The two began a relationship, and in November of that year he took up residence with Asher at her parents' home at 57 Wimpole Street, London.{{sfn|Spitz|2005|p=439}} They had lived there for more than two years before the couple moved to McCartney's own home in [[St. John's Wood]], in March 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miles|1997|pp=104–107}}: Living at the Asher home, 254: McCartney's move to his home in St. John's Wood.&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote several songs while living at the Ashers', including &quot;Yesterday&quot;, &quot;[[And I Love Her]]&quot;, &quot;[[You Won't See Me]]&quot; and &quot;[[I'm Looking Through You]]&quot;, the latter three having been inspired by their romance.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=108}} They had a five-year relationship and planned to marry, but Asher broke off the engagement after she discovered he had become involved with [[Francie Schwartz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=27–32}}: Jane Asher, {{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=777–778}}: Francie Schwartz.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Linda Eastman ====

[[Linda McCartney|Linda Eastman]] was a music fan who once commented, &quot;all my teen years were spent with an ear to the radio.&quot;{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=585}} At times, she skipped school to see artists such as [[Fabian (entertainer)|Fabian]], [[Bobby Darin]] and [[Chuck Berry]].{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=585}} She became a popular photographer with several rock groups, including [[the Jimi Hendrix Experience]], the Grateful Dead, the Doors and the Beatles, whom she first met at Shea Stadium in 1966. She commented, &quot;It was John who interested me at the start. He was my Beatle hero. But when I met him the fascination faded fast, and I found it was Paul I liked.&quot;{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=587}} The pair first properly met in 1967 at a [[Georgie Fame]] concert at [[The Bag O'Nails]] club, during her UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London. As Paul remembers, &quot;The night Linda and I met, I spotted her across a crowded club, and although I would normally have been nervous chatting her up, I realised I had to&amp;nbsp;... Pushiness worked for me that night!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2002|p=45}}: Paul and Linda's first meeting, {{harvnb|Harry|2002|p=587}}: &quot;Pushiness worked for me that night!&quot;; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|pp=432–434}}: Linda's UK assignment to photograph rock musicians in London.&lt;/ref&gt; Linda said this about their meeting: &quot;I was quite shameless really. I was with somebody else [that night]&amp;nbsp;... and I saw Paul at the other side of the room. He looked so beautiful that I made up my mind I would have to pick him up.&quot;{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=587}} The pair married in 1969. About their relationship, Paul said, &quot;We had a lot of fun together&amp;nbsp;... just the nature of how we are, our favourite thing really is to just hang, to have fun. And Linda's very big on just following the moment.&quot;{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=514–515}} He added, &quot;We were crazy. We had a big argument the night before we got married, and it was nearly called off&amp;nbsp;... [it's] miraculous that we made it. But we did.&quot;{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=525}}

The two collaborated musically after the Beatles' break-up, forming Wings in 1971.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=904–910}} They faced derision from some fans and critics, who questioned her inclusion. She was nervous about performing with Paul, who explained, &quot;she conquered those nerves, got on with it and was really gutsy.&quot;{{sfn|Lewisohn|2002|p=45}} Paul defended her musical ability: &quot;I taught Linda the basics of the keyboard&amp;nbsp;... She took a couple lessons and learned some bluesy things&amp;nbsp;... she did very well and made it look easier than it was&amp;nbsp;... The critics would say, 'She's not really playing' or 'Look at her—she's playing with one finger.' But what they didn't know is that sometimes she was playing a thing called a [[Minimoog]], which could only be played with one finger. It was [[Monophonic synthesizer|monophonic]].&quot;{{sfn|Lewisohn|2002|p=45}} He went on to say, &quot;We thought we were in it for the fun&amp;nbsp;... it was just something we wanted to do, so if we got it wrong – big deal. We didn't have to justify ourselves.&quot;{{sfn|Lewisohn|2002|p=45}} Former Wings guitarist McCullough said of collaborating with Linda, &quot;trying to get things together with a learner in the group didn't work as far as I was concerned.&quot;{{sfn|Blaney|2007|p=84}}

They had four children—Linda's daughter [[Heather McCartney|Heather]] (legally adopted by Paul), [[Mary McCartney|Mary]], [[Stella McCartney|Stella]] and [[James McCartney|James]]—and remained married until Linda's death from breast cancer in 1998.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=585–601}} After her death, Paul stated in ''[[Daily Mail|The Daily Mail]]'', &quot;I got a counsellor because I knew that I would need some help. He was great, particularly in helping me get rid of my guilt [about wishing I'd been] perfect all the time&amp;nbsp;... a real bugger. But then I thought, hang on a minute. We're just human. That was the beautiful thing about our marriage. We were just a boyfriend and girlfriend having babies.&quot;{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=600–601}}

==== Heather Mills ====
In 2002, McCartney married [[Heather Mills]], a former model and anti-[[land mine|landmines]] campaigner.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=568–578}} In 2003, the couple had a child, Beatrice Milly, named in honour of Mills' late mother, and one of McCartney's aunts.{{sfn|Sounes|2010|p=523}} They separated in April 2006 and divorced acrimoniously in March 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sounes|2010|p=532}}: Separation, {{harvnb|Sounes|2010|p=546}}: Divorce.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, he commented on media animosity toward his partners: &quot;[the British public] didn't like me giving up on Jane Asher&amp;nbsp;... I married [Linda], a New York divorcee with a child, and at the time they didn't like that&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MaccaSMH&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/06/11/1086749891275.html | title = McCartney's lament: I can't buy your love | newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald | date = 12 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Nancy Shevell ====
McCartney married New Yorker Nancy Shevell in a civil ceremony at Old Marylebone Town Hall, London, on 9 October 2011.

=== Beatles ===
{{other uses-section|social and other general interactions|creative collaborations|Collaborations between ex-Beatles}}

==== John Lennon ====
McCartney had a strained relationship with Lennon; they briefly became close again in 1974, and [[A Toot and a Snore in '74|played music together]] on two occasions, the only times since the Beatles' break-up in 1970.{{sfn|Sandford|2006|pp=227–229}} In later years, the two grew apart.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=587}} While McCartney would often phone, he was apprehensive about the reception he would receive. During one call, Lennon told him, &quot;You're all pizza and fairytales!&quot;{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=588}} In an effort to avoid talking only about business, they often spoke of cats, babies or baking bread.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=590}}

On 24 April 1976, the two were watching an episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' together at Lennon's home in New York City, during which [[Lorne Michaels]] made a $3,000 cash offer for the Beatles to reunite. While they seriously considered going to the ''SNL'' studio a few blocks away, they decided it was too late. This was their last time together.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2002|pp=504–505}}: On 24 April 1976, the two were watching ''Saturday Night Live'', last time Lennon and McCartney spent time together; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=592}}: Lennon: &quot;We nearly got a cab, but we were actually too tired&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; [[VH1]] fictionalised this event in the 2000 television film, ''[[Two of Us (2000 film)|Two of Us]]''.{{sfn|Harry|2002|pp=869–870}} McCartney's last telephone call to Lennon, days before Lennon and Ono released ''[[Double Fantasy]]'', was friendly; he said this about the call: &quot;[It is] a consoling factor for me, because I do feel it was sad that we never actually sat down and straightened our differences out. But fortunately for me, the last phone conversation I ever had with him was really great, and we didn't have any kind of blow-up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodman|first=Joan|title=Playboy Interview: Paul and Linda McCartney|journal=Playboy|volume=31, no. 12|issue=December 1984|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Reaction to Lennon's murder =====
{{main|Death of John Lennon}}

{{quote box|quote= &quot;John is kinda like a constant&amp;nbsp;... always there in my being&amp;nbsp;... in my soul, so I always think of him&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Graff|2000|p=40}}: &quot;John is kinda like a constant&amp;nbsp;... always there in my being&quot;,  {{harvnb|Graff|2000|p=96}}: &quot;in my soul, so I always think of him&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; |source= —McCartney, ''Guitar World'', January 2000 |width=20%|align=right|style=padding:8px;}}

On 9 December 1980, McCartney awoke to the news that Lennon had been [[Death of John Lennon|murdered]] the previous night, his death creating a [[Media circus|media frenzy]] around the surviving members of the band.{{sfn|Carlin|2009|pp=255–257}} That evening, as he was leaving an [[Oxford Street]] recording studio surrounded by reporters who asked him for his reaction, he responded: &quot;It's a drag&quot;. The press quickly criticised him for what appeared to be a superficial response.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=505}} He later explained, &quot;When John was killed somebody stuck a microphone at me and said: 'What do you think about it?' I said, 'It's a dra-a-ag' and meant it with every inch of melancholy I could muster. When you put that in print it says, 'McCartney in London today when asked for a comment on his dead friend said, &quot;It's a drag&quot;.' It seemed a very flippant comment to make.&quot;{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=505}} He described his first exchange with Ono after the murder, and his last conversation with Lennon:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I talked to Yoko the day after he was killed, and the first thing she said was, &quot;John was really fond of you.&quot; The last telephone conversation I had with him we were still the best of mates. He was always a very warm guy, John. His bluff was all on the surface. He used to take his glasses down, those granny glasses, and say, &quot;it's only me.&quot; They were like a wall you know? A shield. Those are the moments I treasure.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=505}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1983, McCartney said, &quot;I would not have been as typically human and standoffish as I was if I knew John was going to die. I would have made more of an effort to try and get behind his &quot;mask&quot; and have a better relationship with him.&quot;{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=505}} He said that he went home that night, watched the news on television with his children and cried most of the evening. In 1997, he admitted the ex-Beatles were nervous at the time that they might also be murdered.{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=594}} He told ''Mojo'' magazine in 2002 that Lennon was his greatest hero.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=506}} In 1981, McCartney sang backup on Harrison's tribute to their ex-bandmate, &quot;[[All Those Years Ago]]&quot;, which featured Starr on drums.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=20}} McCartney released &quot;[[Here Today (Paul McCartney song)|Here Today]]&quot; in 1982, a song Everett described as &quot;a haunting tribute&quot; to McCartney's friendship with Lennon.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=10}}

==== George Harrison ====

Discussing his relationship with McCartney, Harrison said, &quot;Paul would always help along when you'd done his ten songs—then when he got 'round to doing one of my songs, he would help. It was silly. It was very selfish, actually&amp;nbsp;... There were a lot of tracks, though, where I played bass&amp;nbsp;... because what Paul would do—if he'd written a song, he'd learn all the parts for Paul and then come in the studio and say (sometimes he was very difficult): &quot;Do this&quot;. He'd never give you the opportunity to come out with something.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glazer|first=Mitchell|title=Growing Up at 33⅓: The George Harrison Interview|journal=Crawdaddy|issue=February 1977|pages=35–36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Harrison's death in November 2001, McCartney issued a statement outside his home in St. John's Wood, calling him &quot;a lovely guy and a very brave man who had a wonderful sense of humour&quot;. He went on to say, &quot;We grew up together and we just had so many beautiful times together&amp;nbsp;– that's what I am going to remember. I'll always love him, he's my baby brother.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1363989/Ill-always-love-him-hes-my-baby-brother-says-tearful-McCartney.html |title=I'll always love him, he's my baby brother, says tearful McCartney|work=The Telegraph|last1=Poole|first1=Oliver|last2=Davies|first2=Hugh|date=1 December 2001|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the first anniversary of his death, McCartney played Harrison's &quot;[[Something]]&quot; on a [[ukulele]] at the [[Concert for George]].{{sfn|Doggett|2009|pp=332–333}} He also performed &quot;[[For You Blue]]&quot; and &quot;[[All Things Must Pass (song)|All Things Must Pass]]&quot;, and played the piano on [[Eric Clapton]]'s rendition of &quot;[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]&quot;.{{sfn|Harry|2003|pp=138–139}}

==== Ringo Starr ====
[[Ringo Starr|Starr]] once described McCartney as &quot;pleasantly insincere&quot;, though the two generally enjoy each other's company, and at least once went on holiday together in Greece.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=815}} Starr recalled, &quot;We couldn't understand a word of the songs the hotel band were playing, so on the last night Paul and I did a few rockers like &quot;[[What'd I Say]]&quot;.{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=815}} There was at times discord between them as well, particularly during sessions for ''the White Album''. As Apple's [[Peter Brown (music industry)|Peter Brown]] recalled, &quot;it was a poorly kept secret among Beatle intimates that after Ringo left the studio Paul would often dub in the drum tracks himself&amp;nbsp;... [Starr] would pretend not to notice&quot;.{{sfn|Brown|Gaines|2002|p=289}} In August 1968, the two got into an argument over McCartney's critique of Starr's drum part for &quot;Back in the U.S.S.R.&quot;, which contributed to Starr temporarily leaving the band.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Harry|2002|p=816}}; {{harvnb|Miles|1997|p=495}}: &quot;Paul ticked Ringo off over a fluffed tom-tom fill. They had already argued about how the drum part should be played&amp;nbsp;... and Paul's criticisms finally brought matters to a head&quot;; {{harvnb|MacDonald|2005|p=310}}: &quot;The ill-feeling&amp;nbsp;... finally erupted&amp;nbsp;... after an argument with McCartney over the drum part&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; When Starr returned in September, he found bouquets of flowers on his drum kit.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1992|p=296}} Starr commented on working with McCartney: &quot;Paul is the greatest bass player in the world. But he is also very determined&amp;nbsp;... [to] get his own way&amp;nbsp;... [thus] musical disagreements inevitably arose from time to time.&quot;{{sfn|Harry|2002|p=816}}

McCartney and Starr collaborated on several post-Beatles projects starting in 1973, when McCartney contributed instrumentation and backing vocals for &quot;Six O'Clock&quot;, a song McCartney wrote for Starr's album ''[[Ringo (album)|Ringo]]''. McCartney played a [[kazoo]] solo on another track from the album, &quot;[[You're Sixteen]]&quot;. In 1976, McCartney sang backing vocals on another song he wrote for Starr, &quot;Pure Gold&quot;, from ''[[Ringo's Rotogravure]]''. In 1981, McCartney produced and performed on three songs from Starr's ''[[Stop and Smell the Roses]]'', two of which McCartney composed. Starr played drums and sang backing vocals on &quot;[[Beautiful Night (song)|Beautiful Night]]&quot; from McCartney's 1997 album, ''Flaming Pie''. The pair collaborated again in 1998, on Starr's ''[[Vertical Man]]'', which featured McCartney's backing vocals on three songs, and instrumentation on one.{{sfn|Blaney|2007|pp=279–281}} In 2009, the pair performed &quot;[[With a Little Help From My Friends]]&quot; at a benefit concert for the [[David Lynch Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/music/news/2009-04-05-paul-ringo_N.htm|title=McCartney, Starr reunite for Lynch Foundation benefit|date=6 April 2009|last=Gardner|first=Elysa|work=USA Today|accessdate=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They collaborated on Starr's album, ''[[Y Not]]'', in 2010. McCartney played bass on &quot;Peace Dream&quot;, and sang a [[duet]] with Starr on &quot;[[Walk with You]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ringo Starr Recruits Paul McCartney for New Album &quot;Y Not&quot; |last=Kreps |first=Daniel |work=Rolling Stone |date=19 November 2009 |accessdate=1 July 2012 |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/rockdaily/index.php/2009/11/19/ringo-starr-recruits-paul-mccartney-for-new-album-y-not/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 7 July 2010, Starr was performing at Radio City Music Hall in New York.
