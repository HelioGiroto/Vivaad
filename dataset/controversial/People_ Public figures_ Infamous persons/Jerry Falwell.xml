'''Jerry Lamon Falwell, Sr.''' (August 11, 1933 – May 15, 2007)&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,272718,00.html | publisher=Associated Press via Fox News | date=May 16, 2007 | accessdate = August 25, 2007 | title = Jerry Falwell Told Followers He Was at Peace With Death}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an American [[evangelical]] [[fundamentalist]] [[Southern Baptist]] [[pastor]], [[televangelism|televangelist]], and a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[political commentator]]. He was the founding pastor of the [[Thomas Road Baptist Church]], a [[megachurch]] in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]]. He founded Lynchburg Christian Academy (now [[Liberty Christian Academy]]) in 1967, [[Liberty University]] in 1971, and cofounded the [[Moral Majority]] in 1979.

== Personal life ==
{{Southern Baptists}} 
Falwell and twin brother Gene were born in the Farview Heights region of [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], the son of Helen and Carey Hezekiah Falwell.&lt;ref name=NYT051507/&gt; His father was an entrepreneur and onetime [[Rum-runner|bootlegger]] who was [[agnostic]].&lt;ref name=NYT051507/&gt; His grandfather was a staunch [[atheism|atheist]].&lt;ref name=NYT051507/&gt; Jerry Falwell married the former Macel Pate on April 12, 1958. The couple had two sons and a daughter ([[Jerry Falwell, Jr.]], a lawyer; [[Jonathan Falwell]], a pastor; Jeannie, a surgeon).

He graduated from Brookville High School in Lynchburg, Va., and from [[Baptist Bible College (Springfield, Missouri)|Baptist Bible College]] in [[Springfield, Missouri]] in 1956. This Bible college was unaccredited until 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncahlc.org/index.php?option=com_directory&amp;Action=ShowBasic&amp;instid=2797  |title= Higher Learning Commission:Baptist Bible College|accessdate=January 6, 2009 |date=April 1, 2008  |publisher=Higher Learning Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; Falwell was eventually awarded three honorary doctoral degrees, and he sometimes used the title &quot;doctor&quot;. The honorary doctorates were [[Doctor of Divinity]] from [[Tennessee Baptist Seminary|Tennessee Temple Theological Seminary]], [[Doctor of Letters]] from [[California Graduate School of Theology]], and [[Doctor of Laws]] from Central University in [[Seoul]], South Korea.&lt;ref name=&quot;official biography&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liberty.edu/index.cfm?PID=6921 |title=Executive Biographies:Dr. Jerry Falwell |accessdate=January 6, 2009 |publisher=Liberty University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Associated organizations ==

=== Thomas Road Baptist Church ===
{{Main|Thomas Road Baptist Church}}
In 1956, at age 22, Falwell founded the [[Thomas Road Baptist Church]] in Lynchburg,  where he served as pastor. The Church went on to become a [[megachurch]], and is now run by Jerry Falwell's son [[Jonathan Falwell]], who serves in the same capacity as his father.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.trbc.org/index.cfm?PID=9059 |title=Our History |accessdate=January 6, 2009|publisher=Thomas Road Baptist Church |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080801170153/http://home.trbc.org/index.cfm?PID=9059 |archivedate = August 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liberty University ===
{{Main|Liberty University}}
In 1971, Jerry Falwell founded Liberty University, a Christian [[liberal arts]] university in Lynchburg, Virginia. Liberty University has approximately 62,000 students of whom about 12,000 are residential students and 50,000 are enrolled online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Liberty University |url=http://www.liberty.edu/news/index.cfm?PID=18495&amp;MID=17860}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Moral Majority ===
{{Main|Moral Majority}}
In 1979, Falwell founded the Moral Majority, which became one of the largest political lobby groups for evangelical Christians in the United States during the 1980s.&lt;ref name=MSNBC&gt;{{cite news |title=Moral Majority founder Jerry Falwell dies|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18679412/M |publisher=MSNBC |date=May 15, 2007 |accessdate=January 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Moral Majority was founded as being &quot;pro-family&quot;, &quot;[[pro-life]]&quot;, &quot;pro-defense&quot; and pro-Israel.The group is credited with delivering two thirds of the white, evangelical Christian vote to [[Ronald Reagan]] during the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;worldscollide&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Randall E.|last=King|title= When worlds collide: politics, religion, and media at the 1970 East Tennessee Billy Graham Crusade.

Nixon) |url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-19592304.html|publisher=Journal of Church and State |date=March 22, 1997|accessdate=August 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Williams |first=Daniel K. |authorlink=Daniel K. Williams |year=2010 |title=Jerry Falwell’s Sunbelt Politics: The Regional Origins of the Moral Majority |journal=[[Journal of Policy History]] |volume=22 |pages=125–147 |issue=02 |at= |DUPLICATE DATA: year=2010 |month=April |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location= |issn= |pmid= |pmc= |doi=10.1017/S0898030610000011 |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0898030610000011 |format=Fee |accessdate=2010-09-17}} One month before [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|Election Day in 1980]], [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate [[Ronald Reagan]] traveled to [[Lynchburg, Virginia]], to speak at Jerry Falwell's [[Liberty Baptist College]], where he advocated the restoration of classroom [[prayer in public schools]]. While it was not the first time that ...&lt;/ref&gt; During his time as head of the Moral Majority, Falwell consistently pushed for Republican candidates and for conservative politics. This led [[Billy Graham]] to criticize him for &quot;sermonizing&quot; about political issues that lacked a moral element.&lt;ref name=MSNBC/&gt;

== Social and political views ==

=== Families ===
Falwell strongly advocated beliefs and practices he believed were taught by the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Fundamentalist Phenomenon |last=Falwell |first=Jerry |year=1986 |publisher=Baker Publishing Group |coauthors=Hindson, Edward E. |isbn=0-8010-2958-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church, Falwell asserted, was the cornerstone of a successful family. Not only was it a place for spiritual learning and guidance, but also a gathering place for fellowship and socializing with like minded individuals. Often he built conversations he had with parishioners after the worship service into focused speeches or organized goals he would then present to a larger audience via his various media outlets.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

=== Civil rights ===
On his evangelist program ''[[The Old-Time Gospel Hour]]'' in the mid 1960s, Falwell regularly featured [[racial segregation|segregation]]ist politicians like [[Lester Maddox]] and [[George Wallace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.splcenter.org/intel/intelreport/article.jsp?aid=522 |title=Holy War |publisher=SPLCenter.org |date=2003-06-26 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  About [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King]] he said: &quot;I do question the sincerity and nonviolent intentions of some civil rights leaders such as Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., [[James L. Farmer, Jr.|Mr. James Farmer]], and others, who are known to have left wing associations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Washington | first = James M. | title = A Testament of Hope: the essential writings of Martin Luther King | publisher = Harper Collins | location = San Francisco | year = 1990 | isbn = 0-06-064691-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In speaking of the [[Brown vs. Board of Education]] ruling, he said, in 1958:

:&quot;If [[Earl Warren|Chief Justice Warren]] and his associates had known God's word and had desired to do the Lord's will, I am quite confident that the 1954 decision would never had been made. The facilities should be separate. When God has drawn a line of distinction, we should not attempt to cross that line.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070528/blumenthal |title=May 28, 2007 |publisher=The Nation |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Falwell supported [[Anita Bryant]]'s campaign, which was called by its proponents &quot;Save Our Children&quot;, to overturn an ordinance in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County, Florida]] prohibiting [[discrimination]] on the basis of [[sexual orientation]], and he supported a similar movement in California.&lt;ref name = NYT051507/&gt;

But 28 years later, in an appearance on [[MSNBC]] television, Falwell said he was not troubled by reports that the nominee for Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court, [[John G. Roberts]] (whose appointment was confirmed by the U.S. Senate) had done volunteer legal work for homosexual rights activists on the case of [[Romer v. Evans]].  Falwell told MSNBC's [[Tucker Carlson]] that if he were a lawyer, he too would argue for civil rights for LGBT people.  &quot;I may not agree with the lifestyle, but that has nothing to do with the civil rights of that part of our constituency,&quot; Falwell said.  When Carlson countered that conservatives &quot;are always arguing against 'special rights' for gays,&quot; Falwell said that equal access to housing, civil marriage, and employment are basic rights, not special rights. &quot;Civil rights for all Americans, black, white, red, yellow, the rich, poor, young, old, gay, straight, et cetera, is not a liberal or conservative value.  It's an American value that I would think that we pretty much all agree on.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Eartha Jane Melzer, Falwell hints support for some homosexual rights, ''The Washington Blade'', August 26, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israel and Jews ===
Falwell's staunch pro-[[Israel]] stand, sometimes referred to as &quot;[[Christian Zionism]]&quot;, drew the strong support of the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and its leader [[Abraham Foxman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mary Jayne  |last=McKay |title=Zion's Christian Soldiers |curly= |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/10/03/60minutes/main524268.shtml  |publisher=CBS News  |date=June 8, 2003 |accessdate=January 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they condemned what they perceived as intolerance towards Muslims in Falwell's public statements. They also criticized him for remarking that &quot;Jews can make more money accidentally than you can on purpose.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adl.org/PresRele/DiRaB_41/4168_41.htm |title=ADL Condemns Falwell's Anti-Muslim Remarks; Urges Him to Apologize |publisher=Adl.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jews&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maxblumenthal.com/2009/09/irving-kristols-alliance-with-anti-semites/|title=Irving Kristol's Alliance With Anti-Semites|accessdate=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One unusual link between Falwell and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]] [[rabbi]] [[Arnold Resnicoff]], a Navy chaplain, was created when President [[Ronald Reagan]] surprised the participants at Falwell's &quot;Baptist Fundamentalism '84&quot; convention in Washington, D.C., by choosing to read [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=39775 Resnicoff's on-site report] of the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing]] as his keynote address.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=39775 |title=Speech, President Ronald Reagan, Baptist Fundamentalism '84 Convention, Washington, D.C |publisher=Presidency.ucsb.edu |date=1984-04-13 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Resnicoff later served as Special Assistant for Values and Vision for the Secretary and Chief of Staff of the U.S. Air Force, he would meet with Falwell to discuss issues linked to religious rights in the military, including the role and responsibilities of U.S. military chaplains. Resnicoff reported that Falwell supported the idea of using the Biblical verse that teaches that &quot;God hears the words of our mouths and the meditations of our heart&quot; as a basis for allowing Christian chaplains to offer &quot;inclusive&quot; prayers, because they could offer denominational words, such as &quot;In Jesus's name,&quot; silently, as a &quot;meditation of the heart.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonjewishweek.com/print.asp?ArticleID=7131&amp;SectionID=4&amp;SubSectionID=4 |title=&quot;Falwell Left Jews with Mixed Feelings,&quot; Washington Jewish Week, May 16, 2007 |publisher=Washingtonjewishweek.com |date=2007-05-16 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===
Falwell repeatedly denounced certain teachings in [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s and [[secular education]] in general, calling them breeding grounds for [[atheism]], [[secularism]], and [[humanism]], which he claimed to be in contradiction with Christian [[morality]]. He advocated that the United States change its public education system by implementing a [[school voucher]] system which would allow parents to send their children to either public or private schools. Jerry Falwell wrote in ''America Can Be Saved'' that &quot;I hope I live to see the day when, as in the early days of our country, we won't have any public schools. The churches will have taken them over again and Christians will be running them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://atheism.about.com/library/glossary/western/bldef_falwelljerry.htm |title=Biography: Falwell, Jerry |publisher=Atheism.about.com |date=1982-11-21 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falwell supported President [[George W. Bush]]'s [[White House Office of Faith-Based and Community Initiatives|Faith Based Initiative]], but had strong reservations concerning where the funding would go and the restrictions placed on churches. &quot;My problem is where it might go under his successors.... I would not want to put any of the Jerry Falwell Ministries in a position where we might be subservient to a future [[Bill Clinton]], God forbid.... It also concerns me that once the [[pork barrel]] is filled, suddenly the [[Church of Scientology]], the [[Jehovah's Witnesses|Jehovah Witnesses]] ''{{sic}}'', the various and many denominations and religious groups — and I don't say those words in a pejorative way — begin applying for money — and I don't see how any can be turned down because of their radical and unpopular views. I don't know where that would take us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/story/70/story_7040_1.html |title=Beliefnet interviews Rev. Jerry Falwell – |publisher=Beliefnet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Apartheid ===
In the 1980s Jerry Falwell was critical of sanctions against the [[apartheid]] regime of South Africa. He claimed that sanctions would result in what, he felt, would be a worse situation, such as a [[Soviet]]-backed revolution. He drew the ire of many when he called [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner and [[Anglican]] Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] a phony &quot;as far as representing the black people of South Africa.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959695,00.html | work=Time | title=Religion: An Unholy Uproar | date=September 2, 1985 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He later apologized for that remark and claimed that he had misspoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=By ROBERT PEAR, Special to the New York Times |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30A15FB3D5F0C728EDDA10894DD484D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fF%2fFalwell%2c%20Jerry |title=Falwell Denounces Tutu As A 'Phony' |location=South Africa, Republic Of |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date=1985-08-21 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also urged his followers to buy up gold [[Krugerrand]]s and push U.S. &quot;reinvestment&quot; in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=RICHARD N. |last=OSTLING |authorlink=Richard Ostling |coauthors= |title= Jerry Falwell's Crusade|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959697,00.html |work= |publisher=Time Magazine |date=September 2, 1985 |accessdate=May 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''The Clinton Chronicles'' ===
{{Main|The Clinton Chronicles}}
In 1994, Falwell promoted and distributed the video documentary ''The Clinton Chronicles: An Investigation into the Alleged Criminal Activities of Bill Clinton''. The video purported to connect [[Bill Clinton]] to a murder conspiracy involving [[Vincent Foster]], [[Jim McDougal|James McDougall]], [[Ron Brown (U.S. politician)|Ron Brown]], and a [[cocaine]]-[[smuggling]] operation. The theory was discredited, but nonetheless sold more than 150,000 copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;falwell&quot;&gt;[http://www1.salon.com/news/1998/03/cov_11news.html The Falwell connection] by [[Murray Waas]] Salon.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Funding for the film was provided by &quot;Citizens for Honest Government,&quot; to which Jerry Falwell paid $200,000 in 1994 and 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;falwell&quot;/&gt; In 1995 Citizens for Honest Government interviewed two [[Arkansas State Police|Arkansas state troopers]], Roger Perry and [[Larry Patterson]], regarding the murder conspiracy about Vincent Foster. Perry and Patterson also gave information regarding the allegations in the [[Paula Jones]] [[Troopergate (Bill Clinton)|affair]].&lt;ref name=&quot;falwell&quot;/&gt;

Falwell's [[infomercial]] for the 80-minute tape included footage of Falwell interviewing a silhouetted journalist who claimed to be afraid for his life. The journalist accused Clinton of orchestrating the deaths of several reporters and personal confidants who had gotten too close to his illegalities. It was subsequently revealed, however, that the silhouetted journalist was, in fact, Patrick Matrisciana, the producer of the video and president of Citizens for Honest Government.&lt;ref name=&quot;falwell&quot;/&gt; &quot;Obviously, I'm not an investigative reporter,&quot; Matrisciana admitted to investigative journalist [[Murray Waas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;falwell&quot;/&gt; Later, Falwell seemed to back away from personally trusting the video. In an interview for the 2005 documentary ''[[The Hunting of the President]]'', Falwell admitted, &quot;to this day I do not know the accuracy of the claims made in ''The Clinton Chronicles''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Hunting of the President]]'' (DVD) 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== LGBT issues ===
Falwell condemned homosexuality as forbidden by the Bible. Pro-gay rights groups called Falwell an &quot;agent of intolerance&quot; and &quot;the founder of the anti-gay industry&quot; for statements he has made and for campaigning against [[LGBT social movements]].&lt;ref name=NYT051507/&gt;&lt;ref name=intolerance&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20070528/blumenthal |title= Agent of Intolerance |accessdate=May 18, 2007 | last=Blumenthal | first=Max }}&lt;/ref&gt; Falwell supported [[Anita Bryant]]'s 1977 &quot;Save Our Children&quot; campaign to overturn a Florida ordinance prohibiting [[discrimination]] on the basis of [[sexual orientation]] and a similar movement in California.&lt;ref name=NYT051507&gt;Peter Applebome, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/15/obituaries/15cnd-falwell.html?hp Jerry Falwell, Leading Religious Conservative, Dies at 73], ''The New York Times'', May 15, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In urging the repeal of the ordinance, Falwell told one crowd, &quot;Gay folks would just as soon kill you as look at you.&quot;&lt;ref name=homosexuals&gt;{{cite news | last=Johnson, Hans and Eskridge, William |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/18/AR2007051801392.html |title=The Legacy of Falwell's Bully Pulpit |accessdate=May 18, 2007 | work=The Washington Post | date=May 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the LGBT-friendly [[Metropolitan Community Church]] was almost accepted into the [[World Council of Churches]], Falwell called them &quot;brute beasts&quot; and stated, &quot;this vile and satanic system will one day be utterly annihilated and there'll be a celebration in heaven.&quot;&lt;ref name=vile/&gt; He later denied this.&lt;ref name=intersex/&gt; Falwell also regularly linked the [[AIDS]] pandemic to LGBT issues and stated, &quot;AIDS is not just God's punishment for homosexuals, it is God's punishment for the society that tolerates homosexuals.&quot;&lt;ref name=AIDS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.milforddailynews.com/opinion/x1987843539 |title=Press: The Sad Legacy of Jerry Falwell |accessdate=May 18, 2007 | last=Press | First name= Bill }}&lt;/ref&gt; Amongst many remarks over the years he is probably most known for statements attributed to him about a [[Teletubbies|Teletubby]] being a homosexual role model for [[homosexual recruitment]] and stating that LGBT organizations angered God, thereby in part causing God to let the [[September 11, 2001 attacks|September 11 attacks]] happen.&lt;ref name=Tinky/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;falwell apology&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sheild of protection&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.ny1.com/ny1/content/index.jsp?stid=1&amp;aid=69715 |title=Top Stories |publisher=NY1 |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After comedienne and actress [[Ellen DeGeneres]] came out as a lesbian, Falwell referred to her in a sermon as &quot;Ellen DeGenerate.&quot; DeGeneres responded by saying &quot;Really, he called me that? Ellen DeGenerate? I've been getting that since the fourth grade.

At the same time, Falwell's legacy regarding homosexuality is complicated by his support for LGBT civil rights (see &quot;civil rights&quot; section above), as well as his efforts at reconciliation with the LGBT community in later years.  In October 1999 Falwell hosted a meeting of 200 evangelicals with 200 homosexuals at Thomas Road Baptist Church for an &quot;Anti-Violence Forum&quot;, during which he acknowledged that some American evangelicals' comments about homosexuality entered the realm of hate speech that could incite violence.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Religion Journal; Falwell Finds an Accord With Gay Rights Backer&quot; NY Times October 23, 1999 [http://www.nytimes.com/1999/10/23/us/religion-journal-falwell-finds-an-accord-with-gay-rights-backer.html]&lt;/ref&gt; At the forum, Falwell told homosexuals in attendance &quot;I don't agree with your lifestyle, I will never agree with your lifestyle, but I love you&quot; and added &quot;anything that leaves the impression that we hate the sinner, we want to change that&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/1999/10/25/falwell/index.html |title=The odd couple - Gays and Lesbians |publisher=Salon.com |date=1999-10-25 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He later commented to New York Times columnist Frank Rich that “admittedly, evangelicals have not exhibited an ability to build a bond of friendship to the gay and lesbian community. We've said ‘go somewhere else, we don't need you here [at] our churches.’&amp;nbsp;”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/11/06/opinion/journal-has-jerry-falwell-seen-the-light.html?scp=2&amp;sq=jerry%20falwell%20AND%20homosexual&amp;st=nyt&amp;pagewanted=1 |title=Has Jerry Falwell Seen the Light?

=== Teletubbies ===
In February 1999, an unsigned article that media outlets attributed to Falwell was published in the ''National Liberty Journal'' – a promotional publication of the university he founded – claimed that the [[Teletubbies|Teletubby]] named Tinky Winky was intended as a gay role model. An article published in 1998 by [[Salon.com]] had noted Tinky Winky's status as a gay icon.&lt;ref name=Tubbythump&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.salon.com/media/1998/04/03media.html | title='Tubbythumping ' | accessdate=May 30, 2007 }} | last=Millman | first=Joyce&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberty.edu/libertyjournal/index.cfm?PID=15758&amp;artid=97 Arizona supporter funds largest-ever gift annuity to LU] (February 27, 2008) By Mitzi Bible – Liberty Journal&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Steve Rice, spokesperson for Itsy Bitsy Entertainment, which licenses the Teletubbies in the US, said, &quot;I really find it absurd and kind of offensive.&quot;&lt;ref name=Tinky&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/276677.stm | title='Gay Tinky Winky bad for children' | accessdate=May 18, 2007  | work=BBC News | date=February 15, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Winky&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=auX3.SI9QH2M | title = Jerry Falwell, Evangelist, Political Activist, Dies | accessdate=May 18, 2007 | last=Burke | first=Heather | work=Bloomberg | date=May 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The immensely popular UK show was aimed at pre-school children, but the article stated &quot;he is purple – the [[gay pride]] color; and his antenna is shaped like a [[triangle]] – the gay-pride symbol.&quot; Apart from those characteristics Tinky Winky also carries a magic bag which the NLJ and Salon articles said was a purse. Falwell added &quot;role modelling the gay lifestyle is damaging to the moral lives of children.&quot;

=== September 11th attacks ===
After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, Falwell said on [[Pat Robertson]]'s ''[[The 700 Club]]'', &quot;I really believe that the [[Paganism|pagans]], and the abortionists, and the feminists, and the gays and the lesbians who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the [[American Civil Liberties Union|ACLU]], [[People For the American Way]], all of them who have tried to secularize America.

FOX News. Retrieved June 23, 2009 from: http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,273295,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; After heavy criticism, Falwell said that no one but the terrorists were to blame, and apologized saying &quot;if I left that impression with gays or lesbians or anyone else, I apologize.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;falwell apology&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/09/14/Falwell.apology/ | work=CNN | title=Falwell apologizes to gays, feminists, lesbians | date=September 14, 2001 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Labor unions ===
Falwell has also said, &quot;Labor unions should study and read the Bible instead of asking for more money. When people get right with God, they are better workers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ricco, Joanne &quot;The Right Wing Attack on the American Labor Movement&quot;  ''Wisconsin State AFL-CIO'' [http://web.archive.org/web/20090512001518/http://www.wisaflcio.org/political_action/rightwing.htm] Accessed 24 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Islam ===

Jerry Falwell held views in opposition to [[Islam]]. According to ''[[Asharq Al-Awsat]]'', a pan-Arab newspaper, Falwell called Islam &quot;[[satanism|satanic]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabwestreport.info/?q=node/10900 A case that is forgotten…another group of takfir] from ''[[Arab-West Report]]''&lt;/ref&gt; In a televised interview with ''[[60 Minutes]]'', Falwell called [[Muhammad]] a &quot;terrorist&quot;, to which he added: &quot;I concluded from reading Muslim and non-Muslim writers that Muhammad was a violent man, a man of war.&quot; Falwell later apologized to Muslims for what he said about Muhammad and affirmed that he did not necessarily intend to offend &quot;honest and peace-loving&quot; Muslims. However, as he refused to remove his comments about Islam in his website, the sincerity of his apology was doubted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabwestreport.info/?q=node/16194 Rev.

== Legal issues ==

===SEC and bonds===
In 1972, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC) launched an investigation of [[bond (finance)|bonds]] issued by Falwell's organizations. The SEC charged Falwell's church with &quot;[[fraud]] and [[deceit]]&quot; in the issuance of $6.5 million in unsecured church bonds.&lt;ref name = &quot;npr-potent&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5522064|title= Religion, Politics a Potent Mix for Jerry Falwell|publisher=NPR|date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church won a 1973 federal court case prosecuted at the behest of the SEC, in which the Court exonerated the church and ruled that while technical violations of law did occur, there was no proof the Church intended any wrong-doing.

=== Falwell versus ''Penthouse'' ===
Falwell filed a $10 million lawsuit against ''[[Penthouse (magazine)|Penthouse]]'' for publishing an article based upon interviews he gave to [[Freelancer|freelance]] reporters, after failing to convince a federal court to place an injunction upon the publication of that article. The suit was dismissed in Federal district court on the grounds that the article was not [[defame|defamatory]] or an invasion of Falwell's [[privacy]] (the Virginia courts had not recognized this privacy tort, which is recognized in other states).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Falwell Says He Will Press $10 Million Penthouse Suit.&quot; ''The New York Times'', February 5, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Penthouse Wins in Court Against Falwell Suit.&quot; ''The New York Times'', August 7, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Falwell Won't Pursue Suit.&quot; ''The New York Times'', September 10, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Falwell versus ''Hustler'' ===
{{Main|Hustler Magazine v. Falwell}}
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Falwellhustler.jpg|thumb|right|''Hustler's'' parody ad of Falwell]] --&gt;In November 1983, [[Larry Flynt]]'s [[Pornography|pornographic]] magazine ''[[Hustler]]'' carried a [[parody advertisement]] of a [[Campari]] ad, featuring a fake interview with Falwell in which he admits that his &quot;first time&quot; was incest with his mother in an [[outhouse]] while drunk. Falwell sued for $45 million in compensation alleging invasion of privacy, libel, and intentional infliction of [[Intentional infliction of emotional distress|emotional distress]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0283658/bio Larry Flynt – Biography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After a civil trial, known as ''Falwell vs. Flynt'', which lasted from December 3–8, 1984, a [[jury]] rejected the invasion of privacy and libel claims, holding that the parody could not have reasonably been taken to describe true events, but ruled in favor of Falwell on the emotional distress claim and ordered Larry Flynt to pay Falwell damages in the amount of $200,000. This was upheld on appeal. Flynt then appealed to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]], winning a unanimous decision on February 24, 1988. The ruling held that public figures cannot circumvent [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protections by attempting to recover damages based on emotional distress suffered from parodies. The decision in favor of Flynt strengthened [[free speech]] rights in the United States in relation to parodies of public figures.

After the death of Falwell, Larry Flynt released a comment regarding his friendship over the years with Falwell.&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;My mother always told me that no matter how much you dislike a person, when you meet them face to face you will find characteristics about them that you like. Jerry Falwell was a perfect example of that. I hated everything he stood for, but after meeting him in person, years after the trial, Jerry Falwell and I became good friends. He would visit me in California and we would debate together on college campuses. I always appreciated his sincerity even though I knew what he was selling and he knew what I was selling.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/may/20/opinion/op-flynt20|title=The porn king and the preacher|last=Flynt|first=Larry|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2007-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Falwell versus Jerry Sloan ===
In 1984, Falwell was ordered to pay [[gay rights]] activist and former Baptist Bible College classmate Jerry Sloan $5,000 after losing a court battle. In July, 1984 during a TV debate in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], California, Falwell denied calling the homosexual-friendly [[Metropolitan Community Church]]es &quot;brute beasts&quot; and &quot;a vile and [[Satanism|Satanic]] system&quot; that will &quot;one day be utterly annihilated and there will be a celebration in heaven&quot;.&lt;ref name=vile&gt;{{cite web | last=Burns | first=Katy |url=http://www.cmonitor.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070517/REPOSITORY/705170342/1028/OPINION02 |title=Jerry Falwell's greatest hates |accessdate=May 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Sloan insisted he had a tape, Falwell promised $5,000 if he could produce it. Sloan did, Falwell refused to pay, and Sloan successfully sued. The money was donated to build [[Sacramento]]'s first homosexual community center, the Lambda Community Center, serving &quot;[[lesbian]], gay, [[bisexual]], [[transgender]], and [[intersex]]&quot; communities.&lt;ref name=intersex&gt;{{cite web | url=http://web.Archive.org/web/20080125043503/http://www.saccenter.org/about.php |title=about Lambda Community Fund |accessdate=April 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Falwell appealed the decision with his attorney charging that the judge in the case was prejudiced. He lost again and was made to pay an additional $2,875 in sanctions and court fees.

=== Falwell versus Christopher Lamparello ===
{{main|Lamparello v. Falwell}}
In ''Lamparello v. Falwell'', the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit]] reversed an earlier District Court decision, arguing that Lamparello &quot;clearly created his Web site intending only to provide a forum to criticize ideas, not to steal customers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;websitelawsuit&quot;&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12356113/ Supreme Court declines Falwell Web appeal] Associated Press. April 17, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Lamparello's website describes itself as not being connected to Jerry Falwell and is critical of Falwell's views on [[homosexuality]].&lt;ref name=&quot;websitelawsuit&quot; /&gt;  On April 17, 2006, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] declined to [[Certiorari|hear]] an appeal of the Court of Appeals ruling that Christopher Lamparello's usage of the Internet domain &quot;Fallwell.com&quot; was legal.

Previous to this, &quot;Falwell's attorneys have fought over domain names in the past&quot; with a different man who despite eventually turned over [[Lamparello v. Falwell#Related Case: jerryfalwell.com|jerryfalwell.com]] and jerryfallwell.com after Falwell threatened to sue for [[trademark infringement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;websitelawsuit&quot; /&gt;  Lawyers for [[Public Citizen Litigation Group]]'s Internet Free Speech project represented the domain name owners in both cases.

== Apocalyptic beliefs ==
On July 31, 2006, [[Cable News Network]]'s (CNN) ''[[Paula Zahn Now]]'' program featured a segment on &quot;whether the crisis in the Middle East is actually a prelude to the end of the world,&quot; &quot;marking the third time in eight days that CNN had devoted airtime to those claiming that the ongoing Mideast violence signaled the coming of the [[Apocalypse]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;prediction&quot;&gt;[http://mediamatters.org/items/200608010007 CNN still fixated on Apocalypse predictors]. ''[[Media matters for America]]''. Aug 1, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview Falwell claimed, &quot;I believe in the premillennial, pre-tribulational coming of Christ for all of his church, and to summarize that, your first poll, do you believe Jesus' coming the second time will be in the future, I would vote yes with the 59 percent and with Billy Graham and most evangelicals.&quot;

Based on this and other statements, Falwell has been identified as a [[Dispensationalism|Dispensationalist]].&lt;ref&gt;Jerry L. Walls (ed.), ''The Oxford Handbook of Eschatology'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008), 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Falwell declared the [[Antichrist]] would probably arrive within a decade and &quot;Of course he'll be Jewish.&quot;&lt;ref name=Antichrist&gt;{{cite web | last=Cohen | first=Debra Nussbaum|url=http://www.jweekly.com/includes/print/9993/article/falwell-antichrist-remark-sparks-anti-semitism-charges/ |title=Falwell Antichrist remark sparks anti-Semitism charges |accessdate=May 18, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After accusations of anti-Semitism Falwell apologized and explained that he was simply expressing the theological tenet that the Antichrist and [[Christ]] share many attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6160167 |title= NPR: Cultural Impact of the Book of Revelation |accessdate=January 6, 2009  |date=September 28, 2006|publisher=National Public Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Failing health and death ==
In early 2005, Falwell was hospitalized for two weeks with a [[viral infection]], discharged, and then rehospitalized on May 30, 2005, in [[respiratory arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Falwell: The church won the 2004 elections|url=http://www.wsfa.com/Global/story.asp?S=3500772&amp;nav=0RdEbGkt|newspaper=WSFA 12|date=June 21, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;condition&quot;&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-03-30-falwell_x.htm Falwell is taken off ventilator, upgraded to stable condition] ''[[USA Today]]'' May 30, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; President [[George W. Bush]] contacted Falwell to &quot;wish him well.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;condition&quot; /&gt; He was subsequently released from the hospital and returned to his duties. Later in 2005 a [[stent]] was implanted to treat a 70% blockage in his [[coronary artery|coronary arteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Rev.

On May 15, 2007, Falwell was found without pulse and unconscious in his office about 10:45 am after missing a morning appointment and was taken to Lynchburg General Hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.usatoday.com/news/religion/2007-05-15-falwell-hospital_N.htm?csp=34|title=Evangelist Jerry Falwell dies at 73|date=May 15, 2007|accessdate=May 15, 2007| publisher = [[USA Today]]/[[Associated Press]] | first1=Susan | last1=Page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;I had breakfast with him, and he was fine at breakfast.... He went to his office, I went to mine and they found him unresponsive&quot; said Ron Godwin, the executive vice president of Falwell's [[Liberty University]]. His condition was initially reported as &quot;gravely serious&quot;; [[CPR]] was administered unsuccessfully. As of 2:10 pm, during a live press conference, a doctor for the hospital confirmed that Falwell had died of &quot;[[cardiac arrhythmia]], or [[sudden cardiac death]].&quot; A statement issued by the hospital reported he was pronounced dead at Lynchburg General Hospital at 12:40 pm, EST. Falwell's family, including his wife Macel and sons [[Jerry Falwell, Jr]]. and [[Jonathan Falwell]], were at the hospital at the time of the pronouncement.

Falwell's funeral took place at 1:00 pm EDT on May 22, 2007 at Thomas Road Baptist Church after lying in repose at both the church and Liberty University. Falwell's [[burial]] service was private.  It took place at a spot on the Liberty University campus near the [[Montview|Carter Glass Mansion]], near his office. Buried nearby is [[B. R. Lakin]].

After his death, his two sons succeeded him at his two posts; Jerry Falwell, Jr. took over as Chancellor of Liberty University while Jonathan Falwell became the Senior Pastor of Thomas Road Baptist Church.

The last televised interview with Jerry Falwell was conducted by [[Christiane Amanpour]] for the [[CNN]] original series ''[[God's Warriors|CNN Presents: God's Warriors]].''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hvc-inc.com/clients/cnn/warriors/for.html#pr CNN &amp;ndash; God's Warriors] from [[CNN]]&lt;/ref&gt; He had been interviewed on May 8, one week before his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2007/08/16/gods.warriors.fallwell.cnn Christians and Jerry Falwell], interview with CNN's [[Christiane Amanpour]] from [[CNN]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Falwell's last televised sermon was his May 13, 2007 message on [[Mother's Day]].

== Legacy and criticisms ==
Falwell's legacy is strongly mixed and often a source of heated controversy. Supporters praise his advancement of his [[social conservative|socially conservative]] message. They tout too, his evangelist ministries, and his stress on church planting and growth. Many of his detractors have accused him of [[hate speech]] and identified him as an &quot;agent of [[Toleration|intolerance]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;intolerance&quot;/&gt;

He was described by atheist social commentator [[Christopher Hitchens]] in turns as a &quot;[[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]ian fraud&quot; and a &quot;[[faith]]-based fraud&quot;, and &quot;especially disgusting in exuding an almost [[sex]]less personality while railing from dawn to dusk about the [[sex life|sex lives]] of [[homosexual|other]]s.&quot;  Hitchens took special umbrage with Falwell's alignment with &quot;the most thuggish and demented Israeli settlers&quot;, and his declaration that [[September 11 attacks|9/11]] represented God's judgement on America's sinful behaviour; deeming it &quot;a shame that there is no [[hell]] for Falwell to go to, and [...] extraordinary that not even such a scandalous career is enough to shake our dumb addiction to the 'faith-based.'&quot; Hitchens also mentioned that, despite his support for Israel, Falwell &quot;kept saying to his own crowd, yes, you have got to like the Jews, because they can make more money in 10 minutes than you can make in a lifetime. He was always full, as his friends Robertson and Graham are and were, of [[anti-Semitic]] innuendo.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Hitchens|Hitchens, Christopher]]. &quot;[http://www.slate.com/id/2166337/fr/flyout Faith-Based Fraud].&quot; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]''. May 16 [[2007 in literature|2007]]. . Retrieved September 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Appearing on [[CNN]] a day after Falwell's death, Hitchens said, &quot;The empty life of this ugly little charlatan proves only one thing: that you can get away with the most extraordinary offenses to morality and to truth in this country if you will just get yourself called 'reverend'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsbusters.org/node/12792 |title=CNN's Memoriam to Falwell: The Hateful Rhetoric of Christopher Hitchens |publisher=NewsBusters.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On [[C-SPAN]], Hitchens made the comment that &quot;If he had been given an [[enema]], he could have been buried in a matchbox.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Interview on C-SPAN's Q&amp;A with Brian Lamb on Sunday, April 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Falwell was an enemy of the revenge humorist &quot;[[George Hayduke (author)|George Hayduke]]&quot;, who called Falwell a &quot;fund-grubbing electronic Bible-banger&quot; and &quot;pious pride-in-the-pulpit&quot;. In his book ''Screw Unto Others'', Hayduke mentions the story of one Edward Johnson, who in the mid-1980s, programmed his Atari home computer to make thousands of repeat phone calls to Falwell's 1–800 phone number, since Johnson claimed Falwell had swindled large amounts of money from his followers, especially Johnson's own mother. Southern Bell forced Johnson to stop after he had run up Falwell's phone bill an estimated $500,000.  At one point, prank callers, especially gay activists, made up about 25% of Falwell's total calls, until the ministry disconnected the toll-free number in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Hayduke, George. &quot;Prey TV&quot;, ''Screw Unto Others: Revenge Tactics for all Occasions''. pg. 166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=belltoll&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,961073,00.html |title= Evangelism: The Bell Tolls for Falwell|date=14 Apr 1986|accessdate=Nov 23, 2010|work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;
