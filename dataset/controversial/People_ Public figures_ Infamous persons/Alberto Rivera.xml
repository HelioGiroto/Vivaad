'''Alberto Magno Romero Rivera''' (September 19, 1935 – June 20, 1997) was an [[Anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] religious activist who was the source of many of [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist Christian]] author [[Jack Chick]]'s [[conspiracy theories]] about the [[Roman Curia|Vatican]].

Chick promised to promote Alberto's claims even after he died. Rivera claimed to have been a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] before becoming a [[Fundamentalist Christianity|Fundamentalist]] [[Protestant]], and many of the stories Chick published about Rivera involve Jesuit conspiracies.

==Biography==

Rivera was born in [[Las Palmas de Gran Canaria]], [[Canary Islands]], [[Spain]]. He is most notable for his claims about his time as a Catholic priest and the inner workings of the Catholic Church. Most of these claims are fiercely disputed by the Catholic Church and others.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; questioned many of Rivera's claims about his life and claimed that he was a fraud. The two conflicting versions are summarized below.

===Rivera's account===
According to Rivera,&lt;ref name=&quot;ALBERTOCOMIC&quot;&gt;[http://www.chick.com/reading/comics/0112/albertoindex.asp Chick Publications - Alberto]&lt;/ref&gt; he was brought into a seminary in 1942 when he was 7. Two years later, as his mother was dying, she saw &quot;[[Demon|ugly creatures]]&quot; coming at her deathbed, and faced a &quot;[[Hell in Christian beliefs|Christless eternity]]&quot; because of her [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] faith. When visiting his mother's grave, Rivera vowed to find answers to &quot;the truth&quot;. After education at a Catholic [[seminary]], he was sent to destroy various [[Protestantism|Protestant]] organizations and discredit Protestant leaders, but became disillusioned upon finding that the Vatican was behind [[Freemasonry]] and that its reverence of the [[Mary, the mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] was contradicted by [[the Bible]]. In 1965, at an Ecumenical Conference in a [[Guatemala]]n stadium, he denounced the Catholic Church to an audience of 50,000 people. The Jesuits then sent him to a top-secret [[psychiatric hospital|sanitorium]] in Spain to make him recant his faith. Here he was tortured and given poison until he nearly died, eventually being put into an [[iron lung]] because his lungs had broken down from the abuse. Nearly at death, he asked Jesus to forgive him and was miraculously healed. A senior Jesuit attempted to persuade Rivera to return to Catholicism, but instead was himself persuaded to give Rivera the passport and papers he needed to escape Spain. Afterwards he flew to London and saved his sister María, a nun, after she nearly died in a convent.

===''Cornerstone'''s account===

According to the ''Cornerstone'' [[Exposé (journalism)|exposé]]&lt;ref name=&quot;CORNERSTONE&quot; /&gt;: Rivera had a 'history of legal entanglements' including [[fraud]], credit card theft, and writing [[Non-sufficient funds|bad checks]]. Warrants had been issued for his arrest in [[New Jersey]] and [[Florida]], and he was wanted by the Spanish police for 'swindles and cheats'; while in the USA in 1967, he claimed to be collecting money for a Spanish college, which never received this money. The details of his claims changed:  In 1964 he said he had left the Catholic Church in July 1952, but he later put the date at March 20, 1967; despite this, he was still promoting Catholicism in a newspaper interview of August that same year. Although supposedly placed in the sanitorium in 1965 and held there for three months, he gave the date of his release as September 1967, leaving a period of over a year unaccounted.

The document exhibited by Rivera to prove his status as a Catholic priest was fraudulently obtained and the Catholic Church denies his claims of having been a Jesuit priest or a bishop. He had only one sister in London; she was not called Maria, was not a nun, and did not live in a convent. In an employment form dated 1963 he claimed marriage to Carmen Lydia Torres, and the couple had two children in the USA when his own account had him a celibate priest in Spain.

''Cornerstone'' also questioned Rivera's claim to various degrees, including three doctorates ([[Doctor of Theology|Th.D.]], [[Doctor of Divinity|D.D.]], and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]]), reporting that his known chronology did not allow enough time for him to have completed these degrees and that he had admitted to receiving them from a Colorado [[diploma mill]].

==Allegations against Catholicism==

According to Rivera, Jesuits are responsible for the creation of [[communism]], [[Islam]], and [[Nazism]], and causing the [[World War]]s, [[recession]], the [[Jonestown Massacre]], and the [[assassination]]s of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[John F. Kennedy]] (a Catholic); he further claims that the Catholic Church wants to spread [[homosexuality]] and [[abortion]], that the [[Charismatic Movement]] is a front for the Catholic Church, that the [[Pope]]s are [[antichrist]]s, and that the Catholic Church is the [[Whore of Babylon]].&lt;ref name=CATHOLICCOM&gt;[http://www.catholic.com/library/sr_chick_tracts_p4.asp Catholic Answers Special Report: Chick Tracts]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also claimed that the Jesuits were the masterminds behind the [[Medieval Inquisition]] in the 13th century.&lt;ref name=FORWARD&gt;Brian Onken, &quot;Alberto: The Truth about His Story,&quot; Forward, February 25, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations that the Church created Islam==

Rivera also alleged that [[Muhammad]] was manipulated by the Catholic Church to create [[Islam]] and destroy the [[Jew]]s and other groups of [[Christian]]s, and that his first wife, [[Khadijah bint Khuwaylid]], was actually a Catholic nun in an Arabian monastery who was told by a bishop to marry him and sow the seeds of what was to become Islam.&lt;ref name=CATHOLICCOM /&gt; Rivera also alleged that the Vatican staged an [[Three Secrets of Fátima|apparition at Fatima]] (named after [[Fatimah|Muhammed's daughter]]) to cozy up to Muslims.&lt;ref name=CATHOLICCOM /&gt; He further claims that it also staged the 1981 assassination attempt on Pope John Paul II using a Muslim as the marksman &quot;to guilt-induce the Muslim world, bringing them still closer to the Catholic faith!&quot;&lt;ref name=CATHOLICCOM /&gt;

==Presence in &quot;Chick Tracts&quot;==
[[Image:Albertoriv.PNG|thumb|[[Jack T. Chick]]'s rendition of Alberto]]
Six of [[Chick Publications|Jack Chick's comics]] feature Rivera specifically: ''Alberto'',&lt;ref name=&quot;ALBERTOCOMIC&quot; /&gt; ''Double Cross'', ''The Godfathers'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chick.com/reading/comics/0114/godfathersindex.asp Chick Publications - The Godfathers]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Force'', ''Four Horsemen'', and ''The Prophet''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chick.com/reading/comics/0117/theprophetindex.asp Chick Publications - The Prophet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
According to cemetery records, Rivera is buried in Section Moore (28) L-14 #3 at [[Rose Hill Cemetery (Tulsa,Oklahoma)|Rose Hill Cemetery]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Return of the &quot;Antichrist Information Center | work=A Catholic Texan | url=http://kmerian.blogspot.com/2007/09/return-of-antichrist-information-center.html | date=2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.interment.net/data/us/ok/tulsa/rosehill/r/rose_r03.htm | title=Rose Hill Memorial Park Tulsa, Tulsa County, Oklahoma | work=interment.net }}&lt;/ref&gt;
