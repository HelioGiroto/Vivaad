He has brought other celebrities to support the event, including his father, actor [[Martin Sheen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theinsider.com/news/411727_Martin_Sheen_Beats_Perez_Hilton_in_Popularity_Competition_with_the_Gays |title=Martin Sheen Beats Perez Hilton in Popularity Competition with the Gays |work=The Insider |date=October 15, 2007 |accessdate=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sheen's interest in AIDS was first reported in 1987 with his support of [[Ryan White]], an Indiana teenager who became a national spokesperson for AIDS awareness after being infected with AIDS through a blood transfusion for his [[hemophilia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20099075,00.html |title=Amazing Grace |work=People Magazine |author=Friedman, Jack; and Shaw, Bill |date=May 30, 1988 |accessdate=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-11-02/news/mn-3707_1_hollywood-charity?pg=5 |title=Charity Reaches for Stars – Critics Say It Falls Short |work=Los Angeles Times |date=November 2, 1988 |accessdate=March 24, 2010 |first=Alan |last=Citron}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2008, Sheen and [[Jenna Elfman]] co-hosted a [[New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project]] charity event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jennaelfman.com/club/events_calendar.php ''Jenna hosts NY Rescue Workers Detoxification Project Charity Event''.] March 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheen is donating one dollar from each ticket sold from his “My Violent Torpedo of Truth/Defeat is Not An Option Show” 2011 tour to the [[Red Cross]] [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Japanese Earthquake]] Relief Fund.&lt;ref name=&quot;soldout&quot;/&gt;

In 2011, Sheen took on a Twitter challenge by a grieving mother to help critically ill babies born with [[Congenital diaphragmatic hernia]]  by supporting [[CHERUBS]] – The Association of Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia Research, Awareness and Support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charlie Sheen Takes On Twitter Challenge By Grieving Mom To Help Sick Babies|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/43748175/|publisher=CNBC|date=July 13, 2011|accessdate=July 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 2012 Sheen announced that he will donate at least $1 million dollars to the [[USO]]. This will be among the largest single donations ever given to the troop morale-boosting organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Actor Charlie Sheen gives $1M to troops, USO|url=http://cnsnews.com/news/article/actor-charlie-sheen-gives-1m-troops-uso|publisher=CNS News|accessdate=17 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheen, a lifelong fan of the [[Cincinnati Reds]], announced in August 2012 that he would donate $50,000 to the team's community fund, which supports various charities. The donation came after the team raised another $50,000 in an attempt to get broadcaster [[Marty Brennaman]] to shave his head on the field after a Reds victory. After Brennaman shaved his head, Sheen offered to match the previous donation total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Actor Charlie Sheen donates $50,000 to Cincinnati Reds charity|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nationals/actor-charlie-sheen-donates-50000-to-cincinnati-reds-charity/2012/08/05/51a99ce8-df35-11e1-8d48-2b1243f34c85_story.html|newspaper=Washington Post|date=August 5|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=August 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===September 11 attacks===
On March 20, 2006, Sheen stated that he questions the U.S. government's account of the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Charlie Sheen on The Alex Jones Show |url=http://www.infowars.com/video/clips/news/september_11/032006_charlie_sheen_911_wm.htm |publisher=InfoWars |date=March 20, 2006 |accessdate=August 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said during the interview that the [[Collapse of the World Trade Center|collapse]] of the [[World Trade Center]] towers looked like a [[World Trade Center controlled demolition conspiracy theories|controlled demolition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Ron |last=Brynaert|url=http://www.rawstory.com/news/2006/Sheen_interview_on_911_garners_media_0323.html

Sheen has since become a prominent advocate of the [[9/11 Truth movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Keating|first1=Joshua|last2=Downie|first2=James|title=The World's Most Persistent Conspiracy Theories|journal=Foreign Policy|date=September 10, 2009 |url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2009/09/10/the_worlds_most_popular_conspiracy_theories |accessdate=September 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 8, 2009, he appealed to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] to set up a new investigation into the attacks. Presenting his views as a transcript of a fictional encounter with Obama, he was characterized by the press as believing the [[9/11 Commission]] was a whitewash and that the [[George W. Bush administration|administration]] of former President [[George W.
