==Early life==
Ahmadinejad was born near [[Garmsar]] in the village of [[Aradan, Iran|Aradan]], in [[Semnan province]]. His father, Ahmad, was an ironworker, [[grocer]], [[barber]], [[blacksmith]] and religious [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] who taught the [[Qur'an]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bookref1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Melman|first=Yossi|authorlink=|coauthors=Meir Javedanfar|authorlink=|title=The Nuclear Sphinx of Tehran: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the State of Iran|publisher=Basic Books|year=2007|location=|pages=1–3|month=|url=|isbn=978-0-7867-1887-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, Khanom, was a [[Sayyid|Seyyede]], an [[honorific]] title given to those believed to be direct bloodline descendants of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bookref1&quot;/&gt; Ahmadinejad's father changed his name from &quot;Saborjhian&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bioTait&quot; &gt;{{cite news  | author=Robert Tait  | title = A humble beginning helped to form Iran's new hard man  | publisher = The Guardian  | date = 2005-07-02  | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/jul/02/iran.roberttait  | accessdate = 2009-07-27| location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;Sabaghian&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kasra Naji says that the name was 'Sabaghian,' which means 'dye-masters' in Persian; Kasra Naji. &quot;Ahmadinejad: The Secret History of Iran's Radical Leader&quot;. University of California Press (2008), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; when Ahmadinejad was four years old to avoid discrimination when the family moved to Tehran. Sabor is Persian for thread painter,&lt;ref&gt;In 2009 some media reports claimed that Sabourjian is a common Iranian Jewish name, and that &quot;sabour&quot; is the name for the Jewish [[Tallit]] shawl in Persia (''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', 3 October 2009, [http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/6256173/Mahmoud-Ahmadinejad-revealed-to-have-Jewish-past.html Mahmoud Ahmadinejad revealed to have Jewish past]); the claim is disputed, with experts saying that neither claim is correct ([[Meir Javedanfar]], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 5 October 2009, {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5kG0IJYF9|date =2009-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; a once common occupation within the Semnan carpet industry. Ahmadinejad was chosen as it means from the race of Ahmad, one of the names given to Muhammad.

In 1976, Ahmadinejad took Iran's national university entrance contests. According to his autobiography, he was ranked 132nd out of 400,000 participants that year,&lt;ref name=EABBBC20060814 &gt;{{cite news | title = Iran's president launches weblog | publisher = BBC News | date = 2006-08-14| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4790005.stm| accessdate = 2009-07-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon enrolled in the Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST) as an undergraduate student of civil engineering. He earned his [[PhD]] (1997) in transportation engineering and planning from [[Iran University of Science and Technology]], located at Tehran, when he was the Mayor of Ardabil Province, located at the north-west of the country.

Supporters of Ahmadinejad consider him a &quot;simple man&quot; who leads a &quot;modest&quot; life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(AFP) – May 12, 2009 |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hJCaIeo2jqxiNDPX4-zKk3baqpog |title=AFP: Khamenei offers implicit support to Ahmadinejad |publisher=Google.com |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; As president, he wanted to continue living in the same house in Tehran his family had been living in, until his security advisers insisted that he move. Ahmadinejad had the antique Persian carpets in the Presidential palace sent to a carpet museum, and opted instead to use inexpensive carpets. He is said to have refused the V.I.P. seat on the Presidential plane, and that he eventually replaced it with a cargo plane instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;JLAnderson&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Africa can Learn from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|url=http://www.africanexecutive.com/modules/magazine/articles.php?article=4368|publisher=The African Executive}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also upon gaining Iran's presidency, Ahmadinejad held his first cabinet meeting in the [[Imam Reza shrine]] at Mashhad, an act perceived as &quot;pious&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Pepe Escobar |title=Travels in Ahmadinejadland|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/GI15Ak02.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative and academic careers===
Some details of Ahmadinejad's life during the 1980s are not publicly known, but it is known that he held a number of administrative posts in the province of [[West Azerbaijan]], [[Iran]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JLAnderson&quot;/&gt;

Many reports say that after [[Saddam Hussein]] [[Iran–Iraq War|invaded Iran]], Ahmadinejad joined the [[Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution]]&lt;ref name=&quot;bioGS&quot; /&gt; and served in their intelligence and security apparatus,&lt;ref name=&quot;bioGS&quot; /&gt; but his advisor [[Council for Spreading Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's Thoughts|Mojtaba Samareh Hashemi]] says, &quot;He has never been a member or an official member of the Revolutionary Guards&quot;, having been a [[Basij]]i-like volunteer instead.&lt;ref name=EABFT20080530 &gt;{{cite web| author= Najmeh Bozorgmehr| url = http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/3c04bcbc-2d9e-11dd-b92a-000077b07658,dwp_uuid=be75219e-940a-11da-82ea-0000779e2340.html?nclick_check=1| title =  Interview transcript: Mojtaba Samareh-Hashemi| accessdate = 2009-07-28| date = 2008-05-30| publisher = [[Financial Times]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadinejad was accepted to a [[Master of Science]] program at his alma mater in 1986. He joined the faculty there as a lecturer in 1989,&lt;ref name=&quot;bioIR&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bioSenate&quot; &gt;{{cite web  | author= Hussein D. Hassan  | title = Profile and Statements of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  | publisher = [[Library of Congress]]

===Embassy siege===
{{Main|Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and the 1979 hostage crisis}}
Shortly after Ahmadinejad was elected president, some western media outlets published claims that he was among the students who stormed the US embassy in Tehran, sparking the [[Iran hostage crisis]]. This claim has been denied by the Iranian government, the Iranian opposition as well as a CIA investigation on the matter.

===Early political career===
After the [[Islamic Revolution]], Ahmadinejad became a member of the [[Office for Strengthening Unity]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bioIC&quot;/&gt; an organization developed to prevent students from sympathizing or allying with the budding [[People's Mujahedin of Iran|Mojahedin-e Khalq]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bioIC&quot; /&gt;

He first took political office as unelected governor to both [[Maku, Iran|Maku]] and [[Khoy]] in [[West Azarbaijan Province]] during the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;bioGS&quot; /&gt; He eventually became an advisor to the governor general of [[Kurdistan province (Iran)|Kurdistan Province]] for two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;bioIR&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bioSenate&quot; /&gt; During his doctoral studies at Tehran, he was appointed governor general of newly formed [[Ardabil Province]] from 1993 until [[Mohammad Khatami]] removed him in 1997,&lt;ref name=&quot;bioSenate&quot; /&gt; whereupon he returned to teaching.&lt;ref name=&quot;bioGS&quot; /&gt;

===Mayor of Tehran===
In 2003, a 12-percent turnout elected [[conservative]] candidates from the [[Alliance of Builders of Islamic Iran]] to the [[City Council of Tehran]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bioIR&quot;/&gt; The Council appointed Ahmadinejad [[Mayor of Tehran|mayor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bioGS&quot; /&gt;

As mayor, he reversed changes made by previous [[moderate]] and [[reformism|reformist]] mayors. He put religious emphasis on the activities of cultural centres they had founded, publicised the separation of [[elevator]]s for men and women in the municipality offices,&lt;ref name=&quot;entekhab2006&quot;/&gt; and suggested that people killed in the [[Iran–Iraq War]] be buried in major [[city square]]s of Tehran. He also worked to improve the traffic system and put an emphasis on [[Charity (virtue)|charity]], such as distributing free soup to the poor.

After his election to the presidency, Ahmadinejad's resignation as the Mayor of Tehran was accepted on 28 June 2005. After two years as mayor, Ahmadinejad was one of 65 finalists for [[World Mayor]] in 2005, selected from 550 nominees, only nine of them from Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;world mayor&quot; /&gt; He was among three strong candidates for the top-ten list, but his resignation made him ineligible.&lt;ref name=&quot;world mayor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldmayor.com/results05/worldmayor_finalists05.html |title=The 2005 World Mayor finalists |publisher=Worldmayor.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005 campaign===
Ahmadinejad was not widely known when he entered the presidential election campaign as he had never run for office before, (he had been mayor of Tehran for only two years and had been appointed, not elected&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Robin, ''Dreams and Shadows : the Future of the Middle East'', Penguin Press, 2008, p.315&lt;/ref&gt;), although he had already made his mark in Tehran for rolling back earlier reforms. He was/is a member of the [[Islamic Society of Engineers|Central Council of the Islamic Society of Engineers]], but his key political support is inside the [[Alliance of Builders of Islamic Iran]] (''Abadgaran'' or ''Developers'').&lt;ref&gt;Aneja, Atul (2006). He was also known as tir khalas zan before becoming president.[http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl2326/stories/20070112001105500.htm &quot;New Dynamics.&quot;] Frontline. Retrieved 28-07-2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This material no longer available at the URL stated 20090802 --&gt; He was also helped by support from supreme leader [[Ali Khamenei]], who some described Ahmadinejad as a &quot;protege&quot; of.&lt;ref name=&quot;scent&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/may/19/ahmadinejad-iran-power-struggle Ahmadinejad's enemies scent blood in Iran power struggle], Saeed Kamali Dehghan and Julian Borger | guardian.co.uk | 19 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a &quot;principlist&quot;, acting politically based on Islamic and [[Iranian Revolution|revolutionary]] principles.

Ahmadinejad announced controversial ministerial appointments for his second term. [[Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei]] was briefly appointed as first vice president, but opposed by a number of Majlis members and by the intelligence minister, [[Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i]]. Mashaei followed orders to resign. Ahmadinejad then appointed Mashaei as chief of staff, and fired Mohseni-Eje'i.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-iran27-2009jul27,0,6911282.story |title=Iran president clashes with conservatives |publisher=Latimes.com |date=2009-07-27 |accessdate=2011-06-18 |first1=Borzou |last1=Daragahi |first2=Ramin |last2=Mostaghim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 26, 2009, Ahmadinejad's government faced a legal problem after he sacked four ministers.

In Ahmadinejad's first four years as president, Iran's real GDP reflected growth of the economy.

He also initially refused a gradual increase of petrol prices, saying that after making necessary preparations, such as a development of [[public transportation]] system, the government will free up petrol prices after five years.&lt;ref&gt;Bakhtiar, Abbas. [http://www.payvand.com/news/07/jan/1295.html &quot;Ahmadinejad's Achilles Heel&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Interest rates were cut by presidential decree to below the inflation rate. One unintended effect of this stimulation of the economy has been the bidding up of some urban real estate prices by two or three times their pre-Ahmadinejad value by Iranians seeking to invest surplus cash and finding few other safe opportunities. The resulting increase in the cost of housing has hurt poorer, non-property owning Iranians, the putative beneficiaries of Ahmadinejad's populist policies.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Letter from Tehran, The rationalist&quot; by Laura Secor p.31 ''The New Yorker'', February 2, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The Management and Planning Organisation, a state body charged with mapping out long-term economic and budget strategy, was broken up and its experienced managers were fired.&lt;ref name=&quot;donkey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/economy/2008/09/iran-economic-ahmadinejad |title=&quot;Economics is for donkeys&quot; Robert Tait, Published 11 September 2008 |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date=2008-09-11 |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, 50 Iranian economists wrote a letter to Ahmadinejad that criticized his price interventions to stabilize prices of [[good (economics)|goods]], [[cement]], government services, and his decree issued by the High Labor Council and the Ministry of Labor that proposed an increase of workers' salaries by 40 percent.

President Ahmadinejad has changed almost all of his economic ministers, including oil, industry and economy, since coming to power in 2005. In an interview with Fars News Agency on April 2008, [[Davoud Danesh Jaafari]] who acted as minister of economy in President Ahmadinejad’s cabinet, harshly criticized Ahmadinejad’s economic policy: &quot;During my time, there was no positive attitude towards previous experiences or experienced people and there was no plan for the future.

===Family planning and population policy===
{{See also|Family planning in Iran}}

In October 2006, Ahmadinejad began calling for the scrapping of Iran's existing birth-control policies which discouraged Iranian couples from having more than two children. He told [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] that Iran could cope with 50 million more people than the current 70 million. In November 2010, he urged Iranians to marry and reproduce earlier, &quot;We should take the age of marriage for boys to 20 and for girls to about 16 and 17.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/1122/Ahmadinejad-calls-on-Iranian-girls-to-marry-at-16 Ahmadinejad calls on Iranian girls to marry at 16], csmonitor.com, Scott Peterson, November 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; His remarks have drawn criticism and been called ill-judged at a time when Iran was struggling with surging inflation and rising unemployment, estimated at around 11 percent. Ahmadinejad’s call was reminiscent of a call for Iranians to have more children made by Ayatollah [[Ruhollah Khomeini]] in 1979. The policy increased Iran's population by 16 million in seven years&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Robin, ''Dreams and Shadows : the Future of the Middle East'', Penguin Press, 2008, p.321&lt;/ref&gt; but was eventually reversed in response to the resultant economic strain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guard-Child&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/iran/story/0,,1929364,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=1 &quot;Ahmadinejad urges Iranian baby boom to challenge West&quot;] [[The Guardian]].

In 2008, the government sent the &quot;Family Protection Bill&quot; to the Iranian parliament. Women's rights activists criticized the bill for removing protections from women, such as the requirement that a husband obtain his wife's consent before bringing another wife into the family. Women's rights in Iran are more religiously based than those in secular countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/StoryPage.aspx?sectionName=&amp;id=d2936dca-6f92-4333-bba3-a0e61c07edab&amp;MatchID1=4737&amp;TeamID1=8&amp;TeamID2=6&amp;MatchType1=1&amp;SeriesID1=1194&amp;MatchID2=4728&amp;TeamID3=2&amp;TeamID4=3&amp;MatchType2=1&amp;SeriesID2=1191&amp;PrimaryID=4737&amp;Headline=Ebadi+protests+against+Iran%e2%80%99s+polygamy+bill&amp;strParent=strParentID |title=Ebadi protests against Iran’s polygamy bill |publisher=Hindustan Times |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first legislation to emerge from his newly formed government was a 12 trillion [[Iranian rial|rial]] ([[US$]]1.3 billion) fund called ''&quot;Reza's Compassion Fund&quot;'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://roozonline.com/01newsstory/012137.shtml| title = &quot;Reza's Compassion Fund&quot; project archived.| accessdate = 2006-10-17| date =| year =| month =| work =| publisher = [[Rooz]]| language = {{fa icon}}|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061021113903/http://roozonline.com/01newsstory/012137.shtml |archivedate = 2006-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; named after [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] [[Shi'a Imam|Imam]] [[Ali al-Rida]].

Retrieved 18-05-2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The fund also sought charitable donations, with a [[trustee|board of trustees]] in each of Iran's 30 provinces. The legislation was a response to the cost of urban housing, which is pushing up the national average marital age (currently around 25 years for women and 28 years for men). In 2006 the Iranian parliament rejected the fund.
However, Ahmadinejad ordered the administrative council to execute the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://roozonline.com/01newsstory/016575.shtml| title = Reza's Compassion Fund; a political fund with 530 billion budget.| accessdate = 2006-10-17| date =| year =| month =| work =| publisher = [[Rooz]]| language = {{fa icon}}|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060716094802/http://roozonline.com/01newsstory/016575.shtml |archivedate = 2006-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a report by [[Human Rights Watch]], &quot;Since President Ahmadinejad came to power, treatment of detainees has worsened in [[Evin Prison]] as well as in detention centers operated clandestinely by the Judiciary, the Ministry of Information, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/englishwr2k7/docs/2007/01/11/iran14703.htm &quot;World Report 2007&quot;] [[Human Rights Watch]].

The government routinely tortures and mistreats detained dissidents, including through prolonged solitary confinement.&quot; Human Rights Watch described the source of human rights violations in contemporary Iran as coming from the Judiciary, accountable to [[Ali Khamenei]], and from members directly appointed by Ahmadinejad.

Responses to dissent have varied. Human Rights Watch writes that &quot;the Ahmadinejad government, in a pronounced shift from the policy under former president Mohammed Khatami, has shown no tolerance for peaceful protests and gatherings.&quot; In December 2006, Ahmadinejad advised officials not to disturb students who engaged in a protest during a speech of his at the [[Amirkabir University of Technology]] in Tehran,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rajanews.com/News/?3739 &quot;&quot;] Rajanews.

In April 2007, the Tehran police, which is under Khamenei's supervision, began a crackdown on women with &quot;improper hijab.&quot; This led to criticism from associates of Ahmadinejad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baztab.com/news/65372.php &quot;Ahmadinejad's adviser criticizes hijab enforcement issue.&quot;] Baztab.

In 2006, Ahmadinejad's government applied a 50-percent [[Racial quota|quota]] for male students and 50-percent for female students in the university entrance exam for [[medicine]], [[dentistry]] and [[pharmacy]]. The plan was supposed to stop the growing presence of female students in the universities. In a response to critics, Iranian minister of health and medical education, [[Kamran Bagheri Lankarani]] argued that there are not enough facilities such as dormitories for female students. Masoud Salehi, president of Zahedan University said that presence of women generates some problems with transportation. Also, Ebrahim Mekaniki, president of [[Babol University of Medical Sciences]], stated that an increase in the presence of women will make it difficult to distribute facilities in a suitable manner. Bagher Larijani, the president of [[Tehran University of Medical Sciences]] made similar remarks. According to [[Rooz|Rooz Online]], the quotas lack a legal foundation and are justified as support for &quot;family&quot; and &quot;religion.&quot;

====December 2006 student protest====
On 11 December 2006, some students disrupted a speech by Ahmadinejad at the [[Amirkabir University of Technology]] (Tehran Polytechnic) in Tehran. According to the [[Iranian Student News Agency]], students set fire to photographs of Ahmadinejad and threw firecrackers. The protesters also chanted &quot;death to the dictator.&quot; It was the first major public protest against Ahmadinejad since his election. In a statement carried on the students' Web site,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} they announced that they had been protesting the growing political pressure under Ahmadinejad, also accusing him of corruption, mismanagement, and discrimination. The statement added that &quot;the students showed that despite vast propaganda, the president has not been able to deceive academia.&quot; It was also reported that some students were angry about the [[International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust]].&lt;ref name=&quot;students&quot; &gt;Theodoulou, Michael. {{cite web|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1841632006|title=Protesters condemn Holocaust conference.|publisher=The Scotsman|accessdate=Retrieved 06-05-2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the students' slogans, the president said: &quot;We have been standing up to dictatorship so that no one will dare to establish dictatorship in a millennium even in the name of freedom. Given the scars inflicted on the Iranian nation by agents of the US and British dictatorship, no one will ever dare to initiate the rise of a dictator.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irna.com/en/news/view/line-17/0612111551150517.htm|title=President: Students are pioneers of revolutionary movements&amp;nbsp;– Irna}}] {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that even though the protesters broke the TV cameras and threw hand-made bombs at Ahmadinejad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=14:29:55 |url=http://peyvast.blog.com/1353199/ |title=Films of yesterday protest in Iran are leaking out « Connections پیوست |publisher=Peyvast.blog.com |date=2006-12-12 |accessdate=2009-06-21|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080507060133/http%3A//peyvast.blog.com/1353199/ |archivedate = May 7, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; the president asked the officials not to question or disturb the protesters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rajanews.com/News/?3739 ] {{Wayback|url=http://www.rajanews.com/News/?3739|date =20080307115938}}{{Dead link|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rajanews.com/News/?3737 ] {{Wayback|url=http://www.rajanews.com/News/?3737|date =20080307115933}}{{Dead link|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his blog, Ahmadinejad described his reaction to the incident as &quot;a feeling of joy&quot; because of the freedom that people enjoyed after the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahmadinejad.ir/en/freedom/|title=Freedom and Liberty|publisher=Ahmadinejad's English Blog}} {{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmadinejad has been a vocal supporter of [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran's nuclear program]], and has insisted that it is for peaceful purposes.

In April 2006, Ahmadinejad announced that Iran had successfully refined [[uranium]] to a stage suitable for the [[nuclear fuel cycle]]. In a speech to students and academics in [[Mashhad]], he was quoted as saying that Iran's conditions had changed completely as it had become a nuclear state and could talk to other states from that stand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/060413/2006041301.html &quot;Ahmadinejad: Iran can now talk to world from vantage point of a nuclear state.&quot;] Arabic News.

Despite Ahmadinejad's vocal support for the program, the office of the Iranian president is not directly responsible for nuclear policy. It is instead set by the [[Supreme National Security Council]]. The council includes two representatives appointed by the [[Supreme Leader]], military officials, and members of the executive, judicial, and legislative branches of government, and reports directly to Supreme Leader [[Ali Khamenei]], who issued a [[fatwa]] against nuclear weapons in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Recknagel, Charles.

Iranian opposition leader, Mousavi, has even stated that giving up the country's nuclear program would be &quot;irreparable&quot; and that the Iranian people support the nuclear program. &quot;No one in Iran will accept suspension,&quot; Mousavi has said, adding that if elected, his policy would be to work to provide &quot;guarantees&quot; that Tehran's nuclear activities would never divert to non-peaceful aims.&lt;ref name=&quot;PressTV-2009-04-14&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=91361&amp;sectionid=351020101|title=Mousavi: Iran will never halt enrichment|date=14 April 2009|publisher=PressTV.IR|accessdate=1 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009 the United States, France and Russia proposed a U.N.-drafted deal with Iran regarding its nuclear program, in an effort to find a compromise between Iran's stated need for a nuclear reactor and the concerns of those who are worried that Iran harbors a secret intent of developing a nuclear weapon.

===The UN and football stadiums===
Two statements that have brought criticism from some religious authorities concern his speech at the United Nations, and the attendance of women at football matches. In a visit to group of Ayatollahs in [[Qom]] after returning from his 2005 speech to the [[UN General Assembly]], Ahmadinejad stated he had &quot;felt a halo over his head&quot; during his speech and that a hidden presence had mesmerized the unblinking audience of foreign leaders, foreign ministers, and ambassadors. According to at least one source (Hooman Majd), this was offensive to the conservative religious leaders because an ordinary man cannot presume a special closeness to God or any of the [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imams]], nor can he imply the presence of the [[Muhammad al-Mahdi|Mahdi]].&lt;ref name=majd2008p79&gt;''The Ayatollah Begs to Differ : The Paradox of Modern Iran'' by Hooman Majd, Doubleday, 2008, p.79&lt;/ref&gt;

In another statement the next year, Ahmadinejad proclaimed (without consulting the clerics beforehand), that women be allowed into football stadiums to watch male football clubs compete. This proclamation &quot;was quickly overruled&quot; by clerical authorities, one of whom, Grand Ayatollah [[Mohammad Fazel Lankarani]] &quot;refused for weeks to meet with President Ahmadinejad&quot; in early 2007.&lt;ref name=majd2008p79/&gt;

===Iran constitution conflict===
In 2008, a serious conflict emerged between the Iranian President and the head of parliament over three laws approved by Iranian parliament: &quot;the agreement for civil and criminal legal cooperation between Iran and Kyrgyzstan&quot;, &quot;the agreement to support mutual investment between Iran and Kuwait&quot;, and &quot;the law for registration of industrial designs and trademarks&quot;. The conflict was so serious that the Iranian leader stepped in to resolve the conflict. Ahmadinejad wrote a letter to parliament speaker [[Gholam-Ali Haddad-Adel]], furiously denouncing him for an &quot;inexplicable act&quot; in bypassing the presidency by giving the order to implement legislation in an official newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasdaq.com/aspxcontent/NewsStory.aspx?cpath=20080422%5CACQDJON200804220542DOWJONESDJONLINE000190.htm&amp;&amp;mypage=newsheadlines&amp;title=Iran%20President%20Ahmadinejad%20In%20Rows%20With%203%20Leading%20Officials%20-%20AFP |title=Iran President Ahmadinejad In Rows With 3 Leading Officials&amp;nbsp;– AFP |publisher=Nasdaq.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; President Ahmadinejad accused the head of parliament of violating Iranian constitutional law.

===Ali Kordan===
{{Main|Ali Kordan}}
In August 2008, Dr Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, appointed [[Ali Kordan]] as Iran's interior minister. Kordan's appointment has been criticized by Iranian parliamentarians, media and analysts after it came to light that a doctoral degree allegedly awarded to Ali Kordan was fabricated, and that the putative issuer of the degree, [[Oxford University]], had no record of Ali Kordan receiving any degree from the University.&lt;ref name=&quot;oxfordstatement&quot; &gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_stories/2008/080815.html|title=Statement: Mr Ali Kordan|date=2008-08-15|accessdate=2008-08-17|publisher=[[The University of Oxford]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fabrication of legal documents is punishable in Iranian law with one to three years of imprisonment and in the case of government officials, the maximum sentence (three years) is demanded.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

In November 2008, President Ahmadinejad announced that he was against impeachment of Ali Kordan by Iranian parliament. He refused to attend the parliament on the impeachment day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africasia.com/services/news/newsitem.php?area=mideast&amp;item=081104102917.yxb25ese.php |title=IC Publications |publisher=Africasia.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali Kordan was expelled from Iranian interior ministry by Iranian parliament on 4 November 2008. 188 MPs voted against Ali Kordan. An impeachment of Kordan would push Ahmadinejad close to having to submit his entire cabinet for review by parliament, which is led by one of his chief political opponents. Iran's constitution requires that step if more than half the cabinet ministers are replaced, and Ahmadinejad has replaced nine of 21.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/11/03/AR2008110301757.html?hpid=moreheadlines |title=Scandal, Fistfight Erupt Over Impeachment Move in Iran |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date= 2008-11-04|accessdate=2009-06-21 | first=Thomas | last=Erdbrink}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/7707963.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Iran minister sacked over forgery |publisher=BBC News |date=2008-11-04 |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict with Parliament===

In May 2011, several members of parliament threatened to initiate impeachment proceedings against Ahmadinejad after his merger of eight government ministries and the firing of three ministers without parliament’s consent. According to the Majles News Web site, MP [[Mohammad Reza Bahonar]] stated, &quot;legal purging starts with questions, which lead to warnings and end with impeachment.&quot; On May 25, parliament voted to investigate another allegation, that Ahmadinejad had committed election irregularities by giving cash to up to nine million Iranians before the 2009 presidential elections. The vote came within hours after the allegations appeared in several popular conservative news sites associated with supreme leader [[Ali Khamenei]], suggesting the supreme leader supported the investigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;wayout&quot;&gt;[http://www.insideiran.org/domestic-relations/is-ahmadinejad-on-his-way-out/ Is Ahmadinejad on His Way Out?]

During Ahmadinejad's tenure as President of Iran the foreign policy of the country took a different approach from the previous administration. Relations with the West generally soured while relations with other parts of the world, including Africa and Latin America, were on the ascendance. In light of the calls for sanctions on Iran for its nuclear weapons programme, Ahmadinejad and his foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, traveled extensively throughout the two regions, as well as hosted other leaders. Relations with the [[Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas|ALBA]] states, and [[Venezuela]], [[Bolivia]], and [[Ecuador]], in particular, were most strengthened. Relations with America during the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] and Israel were weakened.

Ahmadinejad is an outspoken critic of the [[United States]], [[Israel]], and the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1215331135767|title=Ahmadinejad blames West for AIDS|publisher=Associated Press via [[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=July 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;President Ahmadinejad, Part 2&quot;&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QW1DltEt5z4 President Ahmadinejad, Part 2] [[CBS]] via [[YouTube]]&lt;/ref&gt;
