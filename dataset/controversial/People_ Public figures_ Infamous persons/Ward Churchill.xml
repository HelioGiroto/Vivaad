'''Ward LeRoy Churchill''' (born October 2, 1947) is an American author and [[political activism|political activist]]. He was a professor of [[ethnic studies]] at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] from 1990 to 2007. The primary focus of his work is on the historical treatment of political dissenters and Native Americans by the United States government. His work features controversial and provocative views, written in a direct, often confrontational style.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman Page 92-93&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2005, Churchill's work attracted publicity because of the widespread circulation of a 2001 essay, &quot;[[On the Justice of Roosting Chickens]]&quot;. In the essay, he claimed that the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] were a natural and unavoidable consequence of what he views as unlawful US policy, and he referred to the &quot;technocratic corps&quot; working in the [[World Trade Center]] as &quot;[[little Eichmanns]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;college-journalist-touched-off-firestorm&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = College journalist touched off firestorm | author = Charlie Brennan | work = Rocky Mountain News | date = February 3, 2005 | url = http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2005/feb/03/college-journalist-touched-off-firestorm/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2005 the University of Colorado began investigating allegations that Churchill had engaged in research misconduct; it reported in June 2006 that he had done so.&lt;ref name=&quot;misconduct_report&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | title = Report of the Investigative Committee of the Standing Committee on Research Misconduct at the University of Colorado at Boulder concerning Allegations of Academic Misconduct against Professor Ward Churchill | first1 = Marianne | last1 = Wesson | first2 = Robert | last2 = Clinton | first3 = José | last3 = Limón | first4 = Marjorie | last4 = McIntosh | first5 = Michael | last5 = Radelet | year = 2006 | month = May 9 | publisher = University of Colorado at Boulder | format=PDF | url = http://www.colorado.edu/news/reports/churchill/download/WardChurchillReport.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill was fired on July 24, 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;cu-regents-fire-ward-churchill&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2007/jul/25/cu-regents-fire-ward-churchill/|title=CU regents fire Ward Churchill|author=Berny Morson|work=Rocky Mountain News|date=July 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a claim by some scholars that he was fired over the ideas he expressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Scholar's Statement in Support of Professor Ward Churchill, April 28, 2007| publisher =wardchurchill.net| url =http://wardchurchill.net/files/solidarity_statements_04_28_07.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate= 2009-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Churchill filed a [[lawsuit]] against the University of Colorado for unlawful termination of employment.

==Early life and education==
Churchill was born in [[Urbana, Illinois]] to Jack LeRoy Churchill and Maralyn Lucretia Allen.  His parents divorced before he was two, and he grew up in [[Elmwood, Illinois|Elmwood]], where he attended local schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;DP_Feb_13_2005&quot;&gt;{{cite news
| title = Questions stoke Ward Churchill's firebrand past | author = Dave Curtin | coauthors = Howard Pankratz and Arthur Kane | work = Denver Post | url = http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_0002709008 | date = February 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, he was [[conscription|drafted]] into the [[United States Army]].  On his 1980 resume, he said he served as a public-information specialist who &quot;wrote and edited the battalion newsletter and wrote news releases.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DP_Feb_13_2005&quot;/&gt;

In a 1987 profile on Churchill, the ''[[Denver Post]]'' reported that he was drafted, went to [[United States Army Airborne School|paratrooper school]], then volunteered for [[Vietnam war|Vietnam]], where he served a 10-month tour as [[Long Range Reconnaissance Patrol]] (LRRP), one of a six-man team sent out to track down the enemy.&lt;ref name=&quot;LRRP&quot;&gt;[http://www.gnosis.cx/photos/news/Churchill-DenverPost-1987.gif photostat of ''Denver Post'' article, Claire Martin and (name illegible), ''Denver Post''], January 18, 1987. Retrieved February 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://carcopy.blogspot.com/2005/02/denver-post-january-18-1987.html the text], ''Denver Post''&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Post'' article also reported that Churchill was [[Political radicalism|politically radicalized]] as a result of his experiences in Vietnam.  Churchill told the ''Post'' that he had spent some time at the Chicago office of the [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]] (SDS) in the late 1960s, and briefly taught members of the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weather Underground]] how to build bombs and fire weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;LRRP&quot;/&gt;

In 2005, the ''Denver Post'' reported that Churchill's military records show he was trained as a film projectionist and light truck driver, but they do not reflect paratrooper school or LRRP training.&lt;ref name=&quot;DP_Feb_13_2005&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DP_Feb_3_2005&quot;/&gt;  The 75th Ranger Regiment Association found no record of Churchill having been a member of the unit, or a LRRP team.&lt;ref name=&quot;75th_Rangers&quot;&gt;''Patrolling Magazine'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchill received his B.A. in technological communications in 1974 and M.A. in [[Communication studies|communications theory]] in 1975, both from Sangamon State University, now the [[University of Illinois at Springfield]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DP_Feb_13_2005&quot;/&gt;

==Career==
In 1978, Churchill began working at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]] as an [[affirmative action]] officer in the university administration.  He also lectured on [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] issues in the [[ethnic]] studies program.  In 1990, the University of Colorado hired him as an [[associate professor]], although he did not possess the academic doctorate usually required for the position. The following year he was granted [[tenure]] in the Communications department, without the usual six-year probationary period, after having been declined by the [[Sociology]] and [[Political Science]] departments.

He has long been interested in issues associated with the [[Dawes Act]], which broke up the communal reservation lands and assigned plots to individual households.  Connected with that was the federal government's first use of &quot;[[blood quantum]]&quot; to define individual membership in tribes, for what became known as the [[Dawes Rolls]]. Since re-establishing self-governments, federally recognized tribes have established their own criteria for enrollment as members, often related to descent from recognized historical lists, but less often requiring proofs of blood quantum.  Some of his published works address these issues, which he has interpreted as part of the federal government's policy of genocide against Native Americans.

In 1995 Churchill discussed his views with [[David Barsamian]] in an interview: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;You could say that five hundred years ago was the basis of blood quantum in [[Ibero-America]]. But in Anglo-America, while there was some preoccupation with it, it was not formalized until the passage of the General Allotment Act, mid-1880s. At that point they began to define Indian as being someone who was demonstrably and documentably of at least one-quarter by quantum blood indigenous in a given group. You couldn't be an eighth Cheyenne and an eighth Arapaho and be an Indian. You had to be a quarter Cheyenne or a quarter Arapaho or hopefully a quarter and a quarter. The reason for this was quite clear. They were identifying Indians for purposes of allotting them individual parcels of land in the existing reservation base at that point. If they ran out of Indians identifiable as such, then the rest of the land would be declared surplus. So it was clearly in the interests of the government to create a definition of Indianness that would minimize the number of Indians that were available. It was an economic motivation for the application of this genetic criteria to Indianness in the first place. It's become increasingly so ever since.&quot; ({{cite journal | author=David Barsamian  | title=Interview with Ward Churchill: Historical and Current Perspectives | journal=Z Magazine | year=1995 | month=December | url=http://www.zmag.org/ZMag/articles/dec95barsamian.htm}})&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1996, Churchill moved to the new Ethnic Studies Department of the University of Colorado.  In 1997, he was promoted to [[full professor]].  He was selected as chairman of the department in June 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Churchill tenure questioned: Prof was granted job security without usual review process | author = Berny Morson | coauthors = Charlie Brennan | work = Rocky Mountain News | date = February 16, 2005 | url = http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2005/feb/16/churchill-tenure-questioned/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;personnel_file&quot;&gt;{{cite news

In January 2005, during the controversy over his 9/11 remarks, Churchill resigned as chairman of the ethnic studies department at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]]&amp;nbsp;— his term as chair was scheduled to expire in June of that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;resigns_chair&quot;&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/news/releases/2005/44.html Ward Churchill Resigns Administrative Post], University of Colorado at Boulder,
January 31, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; On May 16, 2006, the Investigative Committee of the Standing Committee on Research Misconduct at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]] concluded that Churchill had committed multiple counts of [[Academic dishonesty|academic misconduct]], specifically [[plagiarism]], [[Fabrication (science)|fabrication]], and [[Forgery|falsification]].&lt;ref name=&quot;misconduct_report&quot;/&gt; On July 24, 2007, Churchill was fired for academic misconduct in an eight to one vote by the University of Colorado's Board of Regents.&lt;ref name=&quot;cu-regents-fire-ward-churchill&quot;/&gt;

==Ethnicity==
In 2003, Churchill stated, &quot;I am myself of [[Creek people|Muscogee]] and [[Creek people|Creek]] descent on my father's side, [[Cherokee]] on my mother's, and am an enrolled member of the [[United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;american_holocaust&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ward Churchill|title=An American Holocaust?

In a statement dated May 9, 2005, and posted on its website, the [[United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians|United Keetoowah Band]] initially said, &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The United Keetoowah Band would like to make it clear that Mr. Churchill IS NOT a member of the Keetoowah Band and was only given an honorary 'associate membership' in the early 1990s because he could not prove any Cherokee ancestry.&quot; The tribe said that all of Churchill's &quot;past, present and future claims or assertions of Keetoowah 'enrollment,' written or spoken, including but not limited to; biographies, curriculum vitae, lectures, applications for employment, or any other reference not listed herein, are deemed fraudulent by the United Keetoowah Band.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Tribe snubs prof: Cherokee band says Churchill's claim of membership a fraud | author = Charlie Brennan | work = Rocky Mountain News | date = May 18, 2005 | url = http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2005/may/18/tribe-snubs-prof/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  

Two days later, the United Keetoowah Band replaced its statement and acknowledged Churchill's &quot;alleged ancestry&quot; of being Cherokee: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Because Mr. Churchill had [[geneaology|genealogical]] information regarding his alleged ancestry, and his willingness to assist the UKB in promoting the tribe and its causes, he was awarded an 'Associate Membership' as an honor,&quot; the tribe's website now said. &quot;However, Mr. Churchill may possess eligibility status for Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, since he claims 1/16 Cherokee.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The tribe's spokesperson, Lisa Stopp, stated the tribe enrolls only members with certified one-quarter American Indian blood. The website statement further clarified that Churchill &quot;was not eligible for tribal membership due to the fact that he does not possess a 'Certificate of Degree of Indian Blood (CDIB)&quot;, and the associate membership did not entitle an individual to voting rights or enrollment in the tribe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlie Brennan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Herdy&quot;/&gt;

Churchill has never asked for CDIB certification, and finds the idea of being &quot;vetted&quot; by the US government offensive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herdy&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Tribe shifts stand, acknowledges Churchill's alleged Cherokee ancestry | author = Amy Herdy | work = Denver Post | date = May 20, 2005 | url = http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_2746403 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050522003926/http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_2746403 |archivedate = May 22, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Charlie Brennan&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Tribe clarifies stance on prof: Milder statement explains Churchill's 'associate' label | author = Charlie Brennan | work = Rocky Mountain News | date = May 21, 2005 | url = http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2005/may/21/tribe-clarifies-stance-on-prof/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, the ''[[Rocky Mountain News]]'' published an article about Churchill's genealogy and family history.  It &quot;turned up no evidence of a single Indian ancestor&quot; among 142 direct ancestors [of Churchill's] identified from records.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flynn&quot;&gt;Flynn, Kevin.

Documents in Churchill's university personnel file show that he was granted tenure in a &quot;special opportunity position.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;personnel_file&quot;/&gt;  In 1994, then CU-Boulder Chancellor James Corbridge refused to take action on allegations that Churchill was fraudulently claiming to be an Indian, saying &quot;it has always been university policy that a person's [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] or [[ethnicity]] is self-proving.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RMN 2005-02-17&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Red-flagged career: Churchill's tenure at CU marked by warnings of trouble | author = Charlie Brennan | coauthors = Stuart Steers | work = Rocky Mountain News | date = February 17, 2005 | url = http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2005/feb/17/red-flagged-career/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of Churchill's Native American critics, such as [[Vernon Bellecourt]] ([[White Earth Ojibwe]]) and [[Suzan Shown Harjo]] ([[Southern Cheyenne]]-[[Muscogee Creek]]), argue that his assertion of Native American ancestry without the ability to prove it might constitute misrepresentation and grounds for termination.

The University of Colorado's Research Misconduct Committee [[Ward Churchill misconduct issues|conducted a preliminary investigation]] into whether Churchill misrepresented his ethnicity to &quot;add credibility and public acceptance to his scholarship.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;preliminary_report&quot;/&gt;  The committee concluded that the allegation was not &quot;appropriate for further investigation under the definition of research misconduct.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Statement Regarding Decision Of Standing Committee On Research Misconduct | author = Pauline Hale | publisher = CU-Boulder Office of News Services | date = September 9, 2005 | url = http://www.colorado.edu/news/reports/churchill/standingcommittee.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 interview in ''The Rocky Mountain News,'' Churchill said, &quot;I have never been confirmed as having one-quarter blood, and never said I was. And even if [the critics] are absolutely right, what does that have to do with this issue? I have never claimed to be goddamned [[Sitting Bull]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2005/dec/24/year-in-quotes/ | work=Rocky Mountain News | title=Year in quotes | date=December 25, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The longtime indigenous activist [[Russell Means]] said in February of that year, &quot;So I want, from this day forward, every media person nationally, internationally and locally to know that we have ascertained that Ward Churchill is a full-blooded Indian leader.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;February 8, 2005 http://www.counterpunch.org/2005/02/21/what-did-i-really-say-and-why-did-i-say-it/ &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Blood Quantum ===
Churchill has responded to requests for verification of his claimed Indian heritage in various ways, including attacking the blood quantum upon which some Native American tribes establish their membership requirements.  Churchill argues that the United States instituted [[blood quantum laws]] based upon rules of descendancy in order to further goals of personal enrichment and political expediency.&lt;ref name=&quot;The charge: Mischaracterization&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20051225071656/http://rockymountainnews.com/drmn/local/article/0,1299,DRMN_15_3838645,00.html The charge: Mischaracterization], ''The Rocky Mountain News;'' June 7, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

For decades in his writings, Churchill has argued that blood quantum laws have an inherent genocidal purpose.  He says, &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Set the blood quantum at one-quarter, hold to it as a rigid definition of Indians, let intermarriage proceed as it [has] and eventually Indians will be defined out of existence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Churchill, Ward, ''[[Kill the Indian, Save the Man]]'', San Francisco, CA: City Lights Books, 2004, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Churchill's assertions have been raised as one of the several research-misconduct allegations that were brought against him in 2005 (see below).  He has been accused of using his interpretation of the Dawes Act to attack tribal governments that would not recognize him as a member.&lt;ref name=&quot;The charge: Mischaracterization&quot;/&gt;

==Writing==
{{Indigenous rights}}
Churchill has written on American Indian history and culture, and speaks about the [[genocide]] inflicted on the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people of North America]] by European settlers and the repression of native peoples that continues to this day.

Churchill has written or coauthored 14 books and more than 150 published essays. He describes 50 of those essays as &quot;scholarly&quot;, of which 27 are refereed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Ward Churchill | title = Submission of Professor Ward Churchill to the Board of Regents of the University of Colorado | url = http://wardchurchill.net/files/churchill_response_to_regents_071207.pdf | format = PDF | date = July 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the University of Colorado investigation, &quot;His academic publications are nearly all works of synthesis and reinterpretation, drawing upon studies by other scholars, not monographs describing new research based on primary sources.&quot; The investigation also noted that &quot;he has decided to publish largely in alternative presses or journals, not in the university presses or mainstream peer-reviewed journals often favored by more conventional academics.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;misconduct_report&quot;/&gt; In addition to his academic writing, Churchill has written for several general readership magazines of political opinion.

In 1986, Churchill wrote an essay titled ''[[Pacifism as Pathology: Notes on an American Pseudopraxis]]'' criticizing [[pacifism|pacifist]] politics within the U.S. left as being hypocritical, ''de facto'' [[racism|racist]] and ineffectual. In 1998, [[Arbeiter Ring Publishing]] published the essay in a book entitled ''Pacifism as Pathology: Reflections on the Role of Armed Struggle in North America'' and listing Ward Churchill as the author. The book included a preface by Ed Mead, a new introduction to the essay by Churchill and a commentary by Mike Ryan. The book sparked much debate in [[leftist]] circles and inspired more aggressive tactics within the [[anti-globalization]] movement in the following few years.&lt;ref&gt;L.A. Kauffman (December 10, 1999). [http://www.salon.com/news/feature/1999/12/10/anarchists/print.html &quot;Who were those masked anarchists in Seattle?&quot;]. Salon.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Agents of Repression'' (1988), co-authored by [[Jim Vander Wall]], describes what the authors claim was the secret war against the [[Black Panther Party]] and [[American Indian Movement]] carried out during the late 1960s and '70s by the [[FBI]] under the [[COINTELPRO]] program. ''[[The COINTELPRO Papers]]'' (1990; reissued 2002), also co-authored with Jim Vander Wall, examines a series of original FBI memos that detail the Bureau's activities against various leftist groups, from the [[Communist Party USA|U.S. Communist Party]] in the 1950s to activists concerned with Central American issues in the 1980s.

In ''Fantasies of the Master Race'' (1992), Churchill examines the portrayal of American Indians and the use of American Indian symbols in popular American culture. He focuses on such phenomena as [[Tony Hillerman]]'s mystery novels, the film ''[[Dances with Wolves]]'', and the [[New Age]] movement, finding examples of cultural [[imperialism]] and exploitation. Churchill calls author [[Carlos Castaneda]]'s claims of revealing the teachings of a [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] Indian [[shaman]], the &quot;greatest hoax since [[Piltdown Man]].&quot;

''[[Struggle for the Land]]'' (1993; reissued 2002) is a collection of essays in which Churchill chronicles the U.S. government's systematic exploitation of Native lands and the killing or displacement of American Indians. He details Native American efforts in the 19th and 20th centuries to prevent [[defoliation]] and industrial practices such as [[surface mining]].
[[File:FromaNativeSon.jpg|thumb|left|''[[From a Native Son]]'' book cover]]
Churchill's ''Indians Are Us?'' (1994), a sequel to ''Fantasies of the Master Race'', further explores [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] issues in popular culture and politics.  He examines the movie ''[[Black Robe (film)|Black Robe]],'' the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]] killings, the prosecution of [[Leonard Peltier]], sports [[mascot]]s, the [[Indian Arts and Crafts Act of 1990]], and [[blood quantum laws]], calling them tools of [[genocide]]. Churchill is particularly outspoken about [[New Age]] exploitations of [[shamanism]] and American Indian sacred traditions, and the &quot;[[do-it-yourself]] Indianism&quot; of certain contemporary authors. [[John P. LaVelle]] of the [[University of New Mexico]] School of Law published a review of ''Indians Are Us?'' in ''The American Indian Quarterly''.  Professor LaVelle, an enrolled member of the [[Lakota people|Santee Sioux Nation]], states that ''Indians Are Us?'' twists historical facts and is hostile toward Indian tribes.&lt;ref name=&quot;lavelle_review&quot;/&gt; It was in this book that Churchill first made the false claim that the United States distributed &quot;smallpox-infested blankets&quot; to Indian tribes, a claim which he repeated many times over the next decade despite the protests of other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/plag/5240451.0001.009?rgn=main;view=fulltext Did the U.S. Army Distribute Smallpox Blankets to Indians? Fabrication and Falsification in Ward Churchill's Genocide Rhetoric]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[From a Native Son|From a Native Son: Selected Essays on Indigenism, 1985–1995]]'' (1996) is a collection of 23 previously published essays on Native American history, culture, and political activism.

Churchill's ''[[A Little Matter of Genocide]]'' (1997) is a survey of [[ethnic cleansing]] in the Americas from 1492 to the present.  He compares the treatment of North American [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]] to historical instances of genocide by the [[Khmer Rouge]] in Cambodia, [[Turkish people|Turks]] against [[Armenians]], and Europeans against the [[Romani people|Gypsies]], as well as [[Nazism|Nazis]] against the [[Poles]] and Jews.

In ''Perversions of Justice'' (2002), Churchill argues that the U.S.'s legal system was adapted to gain control over Native American people. Tracing the evolution of federal Indian law, Churchill argues that the principles set forth were not only applied to non-Indians in the U.S., but later adapted for application abroad.  He concludes that this demonstrates the development of the U.S.'s &quot;imperial logic,&quot; which depends on a &quot;corrupt form of legalism&quot; to establish [[colonialism|colonial control]] and empire.

Churchill's controversial essay on 9/11 was expanded into a book-length manuscript, published as ''[[On the Justice of Roosting Chickens|On the Justice of Roosting Chickens: Reflections on the Consequences of U.S. Imperial Arrogance and Criminality]]'' (2003) by [[AK Press]]. The book features two other chapters, one listing US military interventions, another listing what Churchill believes to be US violations of international law.  The original essay takes the &quot;roosting chickens&quot; of the title from a 1963 [[Malcolm X]] speech, in which Malcolm X linked the assassination of U.S. president [[John F. Kennedy]] to the violence which Kennedy perpetuated as &quot;merely a case of chickens coming home to roost.&quot; Churchill's essays in this book address the worldwide forms of resistance that he posits were and continue to be provoked by U.S. imperialism of the 20th and 21st centuries.

In ''[[Kill the Indian, Save the Man|Kill the Indian, Save the Man: The Genocidal Impact of American Indian Residential Schools]]'' (2004), Churchill traces the history of removing [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] children from their homes to [[residential schools]] (in Canada) or [[Indian boarding school]]s (in the USA) as part of government policies (1880s–1980s) which he regards as genocidal.

==Activism on Native American issues==
Churchill has been active since at least 1984 as the co-director of the [[Denver]]-based [[American Indian Movement of Colorado]], now an autonomous chapter of the [[American Indian Movement]]. In 1993, he and other local AIM leaders, including [[Russell Means]], [[Glenn T. Morris]], [[Robert Robideau]], and David Hill, broke with the national AIM leadership, including [[Dennis Banks]] and the brothers [[Vernon Bellecourt|Vernon]] and [[Clyde Bellecourt]], claiming that all AIM chapters are autonomous. The AIM Grand Governing Council is based in Minneapolis and retains the name of the national group. It says that the schism arose when Means, Churchill, Glenn T. Morris and others openly supported the [[Miskito people|Miskito]] Indian group ''Misurasata'' that was fighting with the [[CIA]]-backed [[Contra]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists such as Harlan McKosato attributed the split to Means and other AIM members dividing over opposition to the Bellecourt brothers because of their alleged involvement in the execution of [[Anna Mae Aquash]] in December 1975, who was then the highest-ranking woman in AIM but had been suspected of being an informant.&lt;ref name=&quot;press&quot;/&gt;  It was a year in which other FBI informants had been discovered in AIM. On November 3, 1999, Means held a press conference in [[Denver, Colorado]] in which he accused the Bellecourt brothers of complicity in Aquash's death, and named three lower-level AIM members involved in her death: Arlo Looking Cloud, John Graham, and Theda Nelson Clark.&lt;ref name=&quot;press&quot;&gt;[http://www.indiancountrynews.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=45&amp;Itemid=60 &quot;Russ Means holds press conference on Annie Mae's murder 11-3-99: Accuses Vernon and Clyde Bellecourt of ordering her Execution&quot;], ''News From Indian Country,'' November 3, 1999. Retrieved July 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time that an AIM leader active at the time of the Aquash murder had publicly accused AIM of having been involved.&lt;ref name=&quot;weller&quot;&gt;[http://www.indiancountrynews.info/aquashmurder.cfm.htm Robert Weller, &quot;AQUASH MURDER CASE: AIM leaders point fingers at each other&quot;], AP, at ''News From Indian Country'', November 4, 1999. Retrieved July 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Looking Cloud and Graham were convicted of murder in 2004 and 2010, by federal and South Dakota state juries, respectively. By then Clark was being cared for in a nursing home and was not indicted. Means attributed the split in AIM to divisions in the aftermath of Aquash's murder. The journalist Harlan McKosato said in 1999, &quot;...her [Aquash's] death has divided the American Indian Movement...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;radio&quot;&gt;[http://www.indiancountrynews.info/nativecalling1.cfm.htm ''Native American Calling''],  November 3, 1999, Native American Public Telecommunications, carried at ''News From Indian Country''. Retrieved July 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[schism (religion)|schism]] continued, with the national AIM leadership claiming that the local AIM leaders, such as Churchill, are tools of the U.S. government used against other American Indians. The leaders of the national AIM organization, now called AIM Grand Governing Council, claim that Churchill has worked in the past as an underground [[counter-intelligence]] source for the U.S. government, for example the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and local, non-Indian, police forces, to subvert the national AIM organization. Specifically, they refer to a 1993 [[Boulder, Colorado]] interview with Jodi Rave, a former columnist for the ''Denver Post'', in which Churchill stated that he &quot;was teaching the [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]] Police Department about the American Indian Movement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bellecourt, Vernon. [http://www.aimovement.org/moipr/USgovt-vs-AIMnov99.html ''United States Government War Against the American Indian Movement''], AIM Council on Security and Intelligence, November 3, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Vernon Bellecourt accused Churchill of having 'fraudulently represented himself as an Indian' to bolster his credentials. Bellecourt said he complained to the University of Colorado about this as early as 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/05/nation/na-churchill5?pg=3|title=He's Fought for His Views, Now His Job|work=Los Angeles Times|date=February 5, 2005|last= Kelly|first=David|accessdate=2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchill has been a leader of Colorado AIM's annual protests in Denver against the [[Columbus Day]] holiday and its associated parade. Colorado AIM's leadership has come into conflict with some leaders in the Denver Italian American community, the main supporters of the parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transformcolumbusday.org/media/20050924-rm.htm|title=&quot;Columbus parade could see less strife: Churchill, conflict having an effect&quot; By Charlie Brennan, ''Rocky Mountain News'', September 24, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transformcolumbusday.org/chronology.html | title=Chronology of Events Concerning (Transform) Columbus Day | work=Transform Columbus Day Alliance | accessdate=March 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 2004, Churchill had claimed that such parades are unconstitutional, arguing that the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment]] to the Constitution provides Native Americans with a right not to be subjected to such displays, overriding the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights of non-native Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/churchill02212005.html &quot;Ward Churchill: What Did I Really Say? And Why Did I Say It?&quot;], ''Counterpunch,'' February 21, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

==9/11 essay controversy==
{{Main|Ward Churchill 9/11 essay controversy}}

Churchill wrote an essay in September 2001 entitled ''[[On the Justice of Roosting Chickens]]''. In it, he argued that the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] were provoked by U.S. foreign policy. He  compared the role of financial workers at the World Trade Center in &quot;ongoing genocidal American imperialism&quot; to the role played by [[Adolf Eichmann]] in organizing the [[Holocaust]].  In 2005, this essay was widely publicized when [[Hamilton College (New York)|Hamilton College]] invited Churchill to speak.&lt;ref name=&quot;college-journalist-touched-off-firestorm&quot;/&gt; This led to both condemnations of Churchill and counter-accusations of [[McCarthyism]] by Churchill and supporters. Following the controversy, the University of Colorado interim [[Chancellor]] Phil DiStefano said, &quot;While Professor Churchill has the constitutional right to express his political views, his essay on 9/11 has outraged and appalled us and the general public.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;resigns_chair&quot;/&gt;

A documentary called ''[[Shouting Fire: Stories from the Edge of Free Speech]]'', broadcast on [[HBO]], prominently features Churchill's case in addressing the issues of [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] and [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|1st Amendment rights]].

On May 16, 2006 the University released their findings; the Investigative Committee agreed unanimously that Churchill had engaged in &quot;serious research misconduct&quot;, including falsification, fabrication and plagiarism.  The committee was divided on the appropriate level of sanctions.&lt;ref name=&quot;misconduct_report&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | title = Report of the Investigative Committee of the Standing Committee on Research Misconduct at the University of Colorado at Boulder concerning Allegations of Academic Misconduct against Professor Ward Churchill | first1 = Marianne | last1 = Wesson | first2 = Robert | last2 = Clinton | first3 = José | last3 = Limón | first4 = Marjorie | last4 = McIntosh | first5 = Michael | last5 = Radelet | date = May 9, 2006 | publisher = University of Colorado at Boulder | url = http://www.colorado.edu/news/reports/churchill/StandingCmteReport.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Standing Committee on Research Misconduct accepted the findings of the Investigative Committee but also disagreed on what sanctions should be imposed.&lt;ref name=&quot;standing_ctte_report&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | title = Report and Recommendations of the Standing Committee on Research Misconduct Concerning Allegations of Research Misconduct by Professor Ward Churchill | first1 = Joseph | last1 = Rosse | first2 = Sanjai | last2 = Bhagat | first3 = Mark | last3 = Bradburn | first4 = Harold | last4 = Bruff | first5 = Judith | last5 = Glyde | first6 = Steven | last6 = Guberman | first7 = Bella | last7 = Mody | first8 = Linda | last8 = Morris | first9 = Uriel | last9 = Nauenberg | first11 = Cortlandt | second11 = Pierpont | date = June 13, 2006 | publisher = University of Colorado at Boulder | url = http://www.colorado.edu/news/reports/churchill/download/ChurchillStandingCmteReport.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill's appeal against his proposed dismissal was considered by a panel of the University's Privilege and Tenure Committee, which found that two of the seven findings of misconduct did not constitute dismissible offences.  Three members recommended that the penalty should be demotion and one year's suspension without pay, while two favored dismissal.&lt;ref name=&quot;cu-regents-fire-ward-churchill&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sgr-regents-dismiss-churchill&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Regents dismiss Ward Churchill | author = Jefferson Dodge | work = Silver &amp; Gold Record | date = July 26, 2007 | url = https://www.cu.edu/sg/messages/5704.html | accessdate = 2008-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 24, 2007, the University regents voted seven to two to uphold all seven of the findings of research misconduct, overruling the recommendation of Privilege and Tenure panel that two be dismissed.  By a vote of eight to one, the regents determined to fire Churchill.&lt;ref name=&quot;cu-regents-fire-ward-churchill&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sgr-regents-dismiss-churchill&quot;/&gt;

The next day, Churchill filed a lawsuit in state court claiming that the firing was retribution for his expressing politically unpopular views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = First amended complaint &amp; jury demand | work = Ward Churchill v.

On April 1, 2009, a Colorado jury found that Churchill had been wrongly fired, and awarded $1 in damages.&lt;ref name=&quot;wrongly&quot;/&gt; As one of the jurors said later in a press interview, &quot;it wasn't a slap in his face or anything like that when we didn't give him any money.

Naves of the Denver District Court to order reinstatement in light of the verdict.

On July 7, 2009, Judge Naves found that the defendants (university) were entitled to [[Quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial immunity]] as a matter of law, vacated the jury verdict and determined that the University did not owe Churchill any financial compensation.&lt;ref name=&quot;DP_July_7_2009&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court | url = http://domainnameattorney.com/ward-churchill.pdf | litigants = Churchill v.

==Artwork==
Churchill's subjects are often [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] figures and other themes associated with [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American Culture]].  He uses historical photographs as source material for works.&lt;ref name=&quot;artnet&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artnet.com/Magazine/news/artnetnews2/artnetnews3-15-05.asp |title=Artnet News: Art Troubles for WTC &quot;Little Eichmanns&quot; Critic |publisher= Artnet Magazine |date=  March 15, 2005 |accessdate=2007-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the early 1990s at [[Santa Fe Indian Market]], Churchill protested the passage of the [[1990 Indian Arts and Crafts Act]]. It requires that, to identify and exhibit works as being by a Native American, artists and craftsmen must be enrolled in a Native American tribe or designated by a tribe as an artisan.&lt;ref&gt;Croteau 220–221&lt;/ref&gt; Under federal law, Churchill cannot identify his art as ''by'' a Native American.

Some of Churchill's pieces may infringe copyrights. For example, his 1981 [[serigraph]] ''Winter Attack'' was, according to Churchill and others, based on a 1972 drawing by the artist Thomas E. Mails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=43054 | title=Ward Churchill copied 'original' art piece | publisher= World Net Daily| date=February 26, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill printed 150 copies of ''Winter Attack'' and sold at least one of them.  Other copies are available online for purchase. Churchill says that, when he produced ''Winter Attack,'' he publicly acknowledged that it was based on Mails' work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Chohan | first =Raj | title ='Original' Churchill Art Piece Creates Controversy | publisher =KCNC-TV (CBS Broadcasting) | date =February 24, 2005 | url =http://cbs4denver.com/local/ward.churchill.raj.2.541927.html | accessdate =2008-01-16 }} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The online journal ''[[Artnet]]'' mentions Churchill's artwork and the controversy surrounding its originality.&lt;ref name=&quot;artnet&quot;/&gt;
