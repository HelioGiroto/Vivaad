'''Imelda R. Marcos''' (born '''Imelda Remedios Visitación Romuáldez''' on July 2, 1929) is a [[Filipino people|Filipino]] politician and widow of former [[Philippines|Philippine]] [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]]. Upon the ascension of her husband to political power, she held various positions to the government until 1986. She is the first politician elected as member of the Philippine legislature in three geographical locations ([[Manila]], [[Leyte]], [[Ilocos Norte]]). In 2010, she was elected to become a member of the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] to represent [[Ilocos Norte]]'s second district. She is sometimes referred to as the ''Steel Butterfly'' or the ''Iron Butterfly''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A &quot;Roller-Coaster&quot; Life For One Of The World's Most Famous Women|agency=Associated Press  |last=Reid|first=Robert H.|date=November 3, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Imelda Marcos is well loved specially by the people of Ilocos Norte and Leyte. &lt;ref&gt; http://inorte.org/?s=governor&amp;paged=18 &lt;/ref&gt;  
In 2011, Imelda Marcos has declared her net worth to be 932.8 million pesos (US$22 million), parliamentary records show, as she continues to fight the government over her assets more than two decades after her husband’s reign ended.  Imelda is the second-richest Philippine politician behind boxing hero and congressman [[Manny Pacquiao]]. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2012/05/06/2003532140 &lt;/ref&gt;

Marcos was born in Manila, Philippines. Her paternal ancestors were wealthy, landed and prominent, and claimed to have founded the town of [[Tolosa, Leyte]]. The Lopezes were descended from the Spanish friar and silversmith Don [[Francisco Lopez]]{{dn|date=October 2012}}, originally from [[Granada]], in the Andalusian region of Spain. Together with Fray Salustiano Buz, he arrived by way of [[Acapulco]] to build Roman Catholic missions in the island provinces of [[Samar]] and [[Leyte]] (Buz would establish his home base in [[Palapag, Samar]], the exit-entry point of the [[Manila Galleons]] in the [[Visayas]] islands).&lt;ref name=&quot;Polotan&quot;&gt;Kerima Polotan, &quot;Imelda Romualdez Marcos, A Biography of the First Lady of the Philippines&quot;, The World Publishing Company, Ohio&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Her branch of the family was not political. Her father, Vicente Orestes Romualdez,  a law professor at [[St. Paul University-Manila|Saint Paul's College]] and the administrator of the Romualdez Law Offices founded by his brother (Imelda's Uncle), Philippine Supreme Court Justice [[Norberto Romuáldez|Norberto Lopez Romualdez]], was a scholarly man more interested in music and culture than public life.  He was a traditionalist, preferring to teach in Spanish while the rest of the students and faculty spoke English and Tagalog. Marcos had a younger brother, [[Benjamin Romualdez]] (1930-2012).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/248875/news/nation/kokoy-romualdez-powerful-younger-brother-of-imelda-marcos-dies-at-81 &quot;Kokoy Romualdez, powerful younger brother of Imelda Marcos, dies at 81&quot;]. ''GMA''. February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her mother, [[Remedios T. Romualdez|Remedios Trinidad y de Guzman]] or [[Remedios T. Romualdez]], a former boarder at the Asilo de San Vicente de Paul (Looban Convent) in [[Paco, Manila]], was said to have been born out of wedlock, the child of a friar.&lt;ref name = &quot;Ellison&quot;&gt;Katherine Ellison, ''Imelda, Steel Butterfly of the Philippines'', McGraw-Hill, New York, 1988. ISBN 0-07-019335-5&lt;/ref&gt; Remedios was from the town of [[Baliuag]], Bulacan, and her own mother was from [[Capiz]].

Marcos spent her childhood in the shadow of the [[Malacañang Palace]] in San Miguel District in Manila, since her family then lived near San Miguel Pro-Cathedral. (The Malacañang Gardens across the Palace used to be owned by her grandfather Danielez.  He sold the land for the education of his sons Norberto, Vicente Orestes and Miguel at the [[Ateneo de Manila]]).  After Marcos's mother Remedios died in 1938, and their home was nearly foreclosed, her father, Vicente Orestes, moved his family back to Leyte to live on their abaca and coconut plantation given to him by his deceased mother, Doña Trinidad Romualdez y Lopez.&lt;ref name =&quot;Ellison&quot;/&gt; Marcos earned a bachelor's degree in education in [[Tacloban]]'s [[St. Paul University-Manila|St. Paul's College]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pedrosa&quot;&gt;Carmen Navarro Pedrosa. ''The Untold Story of Imelda Marcos'', Manila: Bookmark, 1969, p. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

She became a beauty queen and at the age of 18 was crowned the &quot;Rose of [[Tacloban]].&quot; She later became &quot;Miss Leyte.&quot;  Previously, during [[Philippine-American]] Friendship celebrations, a daughter of the prominent Price family of Tacloban was crowned &quot;Miss America&quot; while she was crowned &quot;Miss Philippines.&quot;

Finally, she flew to Manila in 1950 after her cousin, Speaker [[Daniel Romualdez|Daniel Romualdez y Zialcita]] (her uncle ex-[[Manila]] mayor [[Miguel Lopez Romualdez]]'s son) saw her potential to attract crowds. She worked in the music stores of the [[Escolta]]. Because of her beautiful singing voice, many customers requested for her to sing. She sang frequently and made many profits for the store.  However, her father Vicente Orestes found out. He found it below a Romualdez to do such a thing, considering the Romualdez name carried such a cachet (a good name left as an undying legacy by eldest brother [[Norberto Romuáldez|Norberto Lopez Romualdez]],  Chief Justice of the Supreme Court).  He took the next flight from [[Tacloban]] to Manila. He stormed Danieling's offices and demanded an explanation.  &quot;Gin babaligya mo ba ang akon anak?&quot;  (Are you trying to sell my child?!) was his charge against Danieling. Thus, Marcos was later hired at the [[Philippine Central Bank]] headed by her speaker-cousin's brother, [[Eduardo Romualdez]] y Zialcita, in the brand new offices in [[Quezon City]].

She took voice lessons at the music conservatory of the [[University of Santo Tomas]] with the help of Norberto's daughter, [[Loreto Romualdez Ramos]] and her friend, Mrs. Adoracion Reyes. Her photogenic face soon graced many of Manila's magazine covers and she was named the &quot;Muse of Manila&quot; by then Manila Mayor, [[Arsenio Lacson]], a special title given to her after she protested her loss in the Miss Manila pageant.

During her early years in Manila, she lived with her cousin, Danieling and his wife [[Paz Gueco]] along Dapitan Street in Quezon City.  There she was introduced to the machinations of political life since the house was a de facto headquarters for the [[Nacionalista]] party.  Paz, or Pacing, took care of her ward Imelda.  On certain family picnics along the [[Parua]] river straddling [[Magalang]], [[Pampanga]] (where the Guecos owned large ricelands) and [[Concepción, Tarlac|Concepción]], [[Tarlac]], she brought along Imelda, whom the Guecos were excited to see since she was so beautiful--- the newest political asset of the great politician holding sway in [[Eastern Visayas]].  On that picnic also came [[Benigno Aquino Jr]] from nearby Concepcion, who was himself a nephew of Pacing.  It was Benigno or [[Ninoy]] whom Pacing asked to escort Imelda on the way home from her job in the Escolta on some nights.  Also, she was once invited to the parties of [[Pedro Cojuangco]] or Pete, (eldest brother of [[Cory Aquino]]) where she was told to wear a [[flapper]] dress.  She came home ridiculed and slighted by most of the landed scions of [[Pampanga]].

After some time, Marcos started receiving formal visits from [[Ariston Nakpil]], a United States educated heir to the [[Juan Nakpil]]s of Manila.  He was a son of a former [[Miss World Philippines|Miss Philippines]], Anita Noble.  However, Ariston had a quick marriage-and-divorce episode.  Essentially, he was a divorced man.  To the eyes of the Romualdezes, if Imelda married him, she would always be the second wife, a concubine.  The Romualdezes, staunch Catholics, as the rest of the Philippines at that time, was against the concept of divorce.  Her cousin Loreto Romualdez Ramos asked her to distance herself from Nakpil and his invitations to their [[Batangas]] farm family picnics.  Shortly thereafter, Marcos's father [[Vicente Orestes Romualdez]] found out and &quot;talked some sense&quot; to his daughter.  All of them urged Imelda to call off the visits from Nakpil, whom they would not accept into their family as he already had a legal impediment.  (During the Marcos years, Ariston's sister Edith Nakpil Rabat would be a Blue Lady of Marcos)

In 1953, Marcos met then-Ilocos Norte Congressman Ferdinand E. Marcos. After a whirlwind eleven day courtship in Baguio during Holy Week, and with much prodding from Danieling (He and [[Ferdinand Marcos]] were both sitting congressmen at that time), Eduardo and his wife, [[Conchita Romualdez]] (not to be confused with Imelda's youngest sister, Conchita Romualdez Yap), they were married in May of that year at the San Miguel Pro-Cathedral on General Solano street, [[San Miguel, Manila]].  This was the same church where her mother [[Remedios T. Romualdez]] was wed and interred in 1938, fifteen years earlier.  President [[Ramon Magsaysay]] was principal sponsor (he would also be the wedding sponsor to [[Benigno Aquino Jr]] and his wife Corazon in that same year).  President Magsaysay, a [[Nacionalista Party]] member, allowed then Congressman [[Ferdinand Marcos]] to hold his wedding reception in the Malacañang Gardens primarily because of the Romualdezes, who have always identified with the [[Nacionalista]] party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pedrosa&quot;/&gt; They have four children: [[Imee Marcos|Maria Imelda &quot;Imee&quot; Marcos]], [[Ferdinand Marcos, Jr.|Ferdinand &quot;Bongbong&quot; Marcos, Jr.]], Irene Marcos, and [[Aimee Marcos]], who was adopted from within the [[Romualdez]]es.

In 1960, her father reluctantly left his beautiful Leyte to be with Imelda.  He stayed with his eldest child from his second marriage in the Marcos house in [[San Juan City|San Juan]].  Imelda, who by then was now head of their branch of the Romualdezes, took great effort to end any hard feelings between her and her half siblings.  Half sister Lourdes Romualdez Caguiat left the United States and her husband Emilio to care for Vicente Orestes.  The latter died there in San Juan.  Distraught, Imelda refused for her father's body to be prepared elsewhere.  Vicente Orestes Romualdez was embalmed in the San Juan home.  Pregnant with daughter Maria Victoria [[Irene Marcos]], she cried so hard during the burial that Marcos almost fell into the grave.

Between then and 1965, Marcos was constantly featured in many magazine covers.  She travelled around the entire country to get to know each and every politician that could help her husband Ferdinand win the presidency one day.  She learned how to sleep while sitting upright with her elaborate coiffure intact; she sang to the audiences; she was baptismal and wedding sponsor to all; she was the eyes and ears of her husband.  Her determination was unbelievably boundless, even when most among the wives of the Senators looked down upon her, such as Lourdes &quot;Lily&quot; Padilla (née [[De las Alas]]), the young wife of Senator [[Ambrosio Padilla]] and also a sister of the deceased [[Natividad Cojuangco|Natividad]] or &quot;Nene&quot;, the first wife of [[Ramon Cojuangco]] (Ramon would later marry [[Imelda Ongsiako Cojuangco]] who would be a constant friend and Blue Lady of Marcos).  Her very few friends during this phase were her neighbors in [[San Juan City|San Juan]] and [[Elvira Manahan]], also a senator's wife.

In 1966, Ferdinand Marcos became the 10th President of the Philippines. Together with Imelda, he would rule the Philippines from September 21, 1972 up to his removal in February 1986 in the famous [[People Power Revolution]] when he fled the Philippines.

== First Lady of the Philippines (1965–1986) ==
In December 1965, when [[Ferdinand Marcos|Ferdinand E. Marcos]] became the 10th Philippine [[President of the Philippines]], Marcos became first lady of the Philippines. She was widely covered by both local and international media, often featuring in magazine articles.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} In 1969, Ferdinand Marcos became the first Philippine president to be re-elected to a second term.

On September 23, 1972, Ferdinand Marcos declared [[martial law]] to preserve his hold on power. It was during the martial law period that he abolished the Philippines' 1935 constitution and established a parliamentary system (Batasang Pambansa or National Assembly) composed mainly of his own political appointees.  It was during this period that Marcos assumed a more public and powerful role in the government.  She was appointed by her husband to various positions in the government, such as: Governor of Metropolitan Manila, Minister of Human Settlement, and Ambassador Plenipotentiary and Extraordinary. On December 7, 1972, an assailant, [[Carlito Dimahilig]], tried to stab her to death with a [[bolo knife]] during an award ceremony broadcast live on television. Critics claimed the assassination attempt was staged.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}  The assailant was shot to death by security police and the wounds on Marcos' hands and arms required 75 stitches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/program.pl?ID=462241 | title=Mrs. Marcos / Assassination Attempt |publisher=Television News Archive/Vanderbilt University}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, she was elected as member of the 165-member Interim [[Batasang Pambansa]] (National Assembly) representing the National Capital Region.

As a Special Envoy, Imelda toured China, the Soviet Union, and the Soviet satellite states in Eastern Europe (Romania, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, East Germany, etc.), the Middle East, Libya, then ruled by strongman [[Muammar Gaddafi]], the non-Soviet dominated communist state of Yugoslavia, and Cuba.  To justify the multi-million expenditure of traveling with a large diplomatic entourage using private jets, she would later claim diplomatic successes that included securing of a cheap supply of oil from China and Libya, and in the signing of the Tripoli Agreement.

[[File:Marcos Clark Air Base cropped.jpg|left|175px|thumb|Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos in 1979]]
Imelda's extravagant lifestyle reportedly included five-million-dollar shopping tours in New York, Rome and Copenhagen in 1983, and sending a plane to pick up Australian white sand for a new beach resort. She purchased a number of properties in [[Manhattan]] in the 1980s, including the $51-million Crown Building, the Woolworth Building ([[40 Wall Street]]) and the $60-million Herald Centre; she declined to purchase the [[Empire State Building]] for $750m as she considered it &quot;too ostentatious.&quot; Her New York real estate was later seized and sold, along with much of her jewels and most of her 175 piece art collection, which included works by [[Michelangelo]], [[Botticelli]], and [[Canaletto]]. She responded to criticisms of her extravagance by claiming that it was her &quot;duty&quot; to be &quot;some kind of light, a star to give [the poor] guidelines.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McNeill&quot;&gt;{{cite news

She also orchestrated lavish public events using millions of dollars in public funds to extol her husband's regime and bolster her public image.  Imelda secured the [[Miss Universe 1974]] pageant for Manila, which necessitated the construction and completion of the 10,000-seat [[Folk Arts Theater]] in less than three months.  Marcos organized the Kasaysayan ng Lahi, an extravagant festival parade showcasing the history of the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;Kasaysayan ng Lahi [documentary video], Manila: National Media Production Board, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Serin, J.R., A.L. Elamil. D.C. Serion, et al. ''Ugnayan ng Pamhalaan at Mamamayan.'' Manila: Bede's Publishing House, Inc., 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; She initiated social programs such as the [[Green Revolution]], a program that, although it did not address hunger and the core problem of agricultural land reform (most Filipino farmers were tenant farmers and did not own their land), encouraged Filipinos to plant vegetables and fruits in their gardens. Other short-lived social programs included a national family-planning program to reduce the country's population growth.&lt;ref&gt;Ramona Diaz. Imelda [film]. Ramona Diaz-Independent Television Service, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, institutions such as [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]], [[Philippine Heart Center]], [[Lung Center of the Philippines]], Kidney Institute of the Philippines, Nayong Pilipino; [[Philippine International Convention Center]], Folk Arts Theater, [[Coconut Palace]], and the [[Manila Film Center]], built in 1982 to host her short-lived international film festival are all Marcos' brainchildren.

On 1981, martial law was lifted and, in the same year, Ferdinannd Marcos was re-elected as the president of the country.

When Ferdinand Marcos began to suffer from [[lupus erythematosus]] in the 1980s, it was said that Imelda Marcos was effectively the acting or ''de facto'' president of the Philippines. There was also speculation at that time that if Ferdinand Marcos were to die, Imelda Marcos and her husband's trusted military adviser, General [[Fabian Ver]], then the chief of staff of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]], would seize power.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} After the assassination of opposition leader and one Ferdinand Marcos' most prominent critics, former senator [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] on the tarmac of then Manila International Airport on 1983, Imelda Marcos and Ver (in addition to from Ferdinand Marcos) would be accused of ordering his assassination. In fact, Imelda Marcos was summoned to the investigation of the Agrava Commission, an independent fact-finding panel formed by her husband to investigate this assassination.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Marcos denied the allegations against her.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

On the 1986 snap presidential elections, she supported Ferdinand Marcos in his bid to be re-elected for the presidency against [[Corazon Aquino]], a neophyte opposition leader and the widow of Aquino.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} 

In the same year, Ferdinand Marcos would be ousted in a non-violent [[People Power]] revolt, which was triggered by the defection of then Defense Minister [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] and then AFP vice-chief of staff Lt. General [[Fidel Ramos]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

On February 25, 1986, Ferdinand Marcos and his family fled to Hawaii (via [[Guam]]) after his regime was toppled by the [[People Power Revolution|four-day People Power Revolution at EDSA]].  Also, the place where her shoes and jewelry were being kept was destroyed, the contents stolen.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Even a painting of Imelda was destroyed outside the Malacañan Palace. Marcos was succeeded by [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon C. Aquino]], widow of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Benigno S. Aquino, Jr.]], Marcos' foremost political opponent, who was assassinated at the Manila International Airport during his return to the Philippines in 1983 after years of political exile.  It was widely assumed that Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos were involved in the assassination, which ignited the People Power Revolution of 1986.  Upon assuming office, President Aquino issued Executive Order No. 1, creating the Presidential Commission on Good Government to investigate and sequester the ill-gotten wealth of the Marcoses. President Aquino abolished the [[Batasang Pambansa]] (Philippine Parliament) and the Ministry of Human Settlements, both creations of Marcos, and established in 1987 a modified version of the Philippines' original 1935 constitution, which had been abolished in 1972 by Marcos. After the Marcos family fled [[Malacañan Palace]], Marcos was found to have left behind 15 mink coats, 508 gowns, 1,000 handbags&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The exact number of shoes varies between accounts; estimates of up to 3000 pairs of shoes have been published,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/europe/11/07/day.numbers/index.html |publisher=CNN | title=The day in numbers: $100 - CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but ''Time'' later reported that the final tally was 1,060.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,963620,00.html | work=Time | title=Investigations: Imeldarabilia: A Final Count | date=February 23, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Marcos claimed that her fortune came from [[Yamashita's Gold]].&lt;ref&gt;http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1243&amp;dat=19920203&amp;id=LVYPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=j4YDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4782,3870408&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2006, Marcos insisted that her husband had acquired his wealth legitimately as a gold trader. By the late 1950s, she claimed, he had amassed a personal fortune 7,500 tons of gold, and after gold prices climbed in the 1970s, the Marcos family was worth  about $35&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;McNeill&quot;/&gt; However, the Bureau of Internal Revenue has no record of the Marcos family declaring or paying taxes on these assets{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}, and the source of their wealth remains open to investigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;McNeill&quot;/&gt;

Ousted President Marcos died in [[exile]] on September 28, 1989. President Aquino refused to permit the repatriation of his remains for national-security reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Transportation and Communications Memorandum Circular No. 89-291, dated June 9, 1989. Excerpts: &quot;Resolved, as it its is hereby resolved that, in the interest of national security  and tranquility and pursuant to the declared national policy, any aircraft carrying deposed president Ferdinand E. Marcos is prohibited from entering Philippine airspace or, landing or disembarking in Philippine territory. This prohibition shall apply to the remains in the event of his death.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The Supreme Court upheld the decision of the government in ''Marcos vs. Manglapus''.&lt;ref&gt;177 SCRA 668, The Philippine Supreme Court, voting 8–7, prohibited the return of President Marcos and members of his family to the Philippines&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, Marcos was allowed to return home.

Marcos was the first wife of a foreign head of state to stand trial in an American court. In 1990, she was acquitted of [[racketeering]] and fraud charges, alongside co-defendant [[Adnan Khashoggi]], a Saudi Arabian former billionaire and arms dealer. The &quot;theatrical&quot; trial involved many celebrities: Marcos and Khashoggi were represented by trial lawyer [[Gerry Spence]]; Marcos' $5-million-dollar bail was posted by tobacco heiress, [[Doris Duke]], who befriended her while they both lived in Hawaii; and actor [[George Hamilton (actor)|George Hamilton]] was a star witness for the defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

== Post-exile (1991–present) ==

===1992 presidential campaign and 1995 congressional bid===
In 1992, Marcos ran and finished fifth in the seven-way presidential race. Her votes were split between her, with 2,338,294 votes, and Ambassador [[Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr.]], a close advisor and friend of [[Ferdinand Marcos]], with 4,116,376 votes. [[Fidel Ramos]], the candidate endorsed by Corazon Aquino, received 5.3&amp;nbsp;million and won the election.&lt;ref&gt;Commission on Elections. Report of the Commission on Elections to the President and Congress of the Republic of the Philippines. Manila: Commission on Elections, Manila&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, she was elected Congresswoman of Leyte, representing the first district of her home province. Marcos overwhelmingly defeated then Rep. Cirilo Montejo by a landslide victory (70,471 votes against Montejo's 36,833 votes). Initially, a disqualification case was filed against her but the Supreme Court ruled in favor of her.

===1998 presidential campaign===
In 1998, she made another bid for the presidency but later backed out of the race to support the candidacy of then Vice President [[Joseph Ejercito Estrada]]. Marcos finished 9th among 11 candidates vying for the Philippine government's top post.  During the administration of her friend and ally, President Joseph Estrada, many of the cases filed by the Aquino government were dismissed by Ombudsman Aniano Desierto, owing to technicalities (lapse of the prescriptive period for filing cases). On June 29, 1998, the [[Sandiganbayan]] (Philippine anti-corruption court) convicted the Former First Lady of the charge that she had entered into an agreement disadvantageous to the government. On appeal, the [[Supreme Court]] reversed the decision and cited Sandiganbayan Justice Francis Gatchitorena  for his alleged  bias against Mrs. Marcos.&lt;ref&gt;Imelda Marcos vs. Sandiganbayan, GR. No. 126995 [Supreme Court Resolution], dated October 6, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 congressional bid===
[[File:Imelda Romualdez Marcos.jpg|thumbnail|right|Marcos in 2008]]
She ran once again for the House this time for [[Philippine_House_of_Representatives_elections_in_the_Ilocos_Region,_2010#2nd_District|second district]] of [[Ilocos Norte]] in the [[Philippine House of Representatives elections, 2010|2010 elections]], to replace her son, incumbent Rep. Ferdinand Marcos, Jr., who is running for Senator under the [[Nacionalista Party]]. She won over her nearest rival [[Mariano Nalupta, Jr.]] by 80% to 20%.

===2013 congressional bid===
Former First Lady Imelda Marcos filed her certificate of candidacy on Wednesday, Oct 3, 2012,  as she sought to renew her term as Ilocos Norte's second district representative. Marcos, who is running under the Kilusang Bagong Lipunan party, was accompanied by her daughter, Governor Imelda &quot;Imee&quot; Marcos, in the filing of her certificate of candidacy (CoC).
Marcos said she wants to continue serving the province despite her age. She is now 83. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/regions/10/03/12/imelda-seeks-second-term-files-coc &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Corruption trials ===
On September 21, 2007, the Sandiganbayan's 5th Division chair Associate Justice Ma. Cristina Cortez-Estrada granted Marcos' motion for daily trial on her 10 pending graft cases (beginning January 21, 2008, as requested by defense lawyers on September 17 alleging, ''inter alia'', illnesses).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/61479/Sandigan-grants-Imelda-bid-for-daily-hearings-on-graft-cases  GMA NEWS.TV@em`tixe`, Sandigan OKs Imelda bid for daily hearings on graft cases]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 10, 2008 Judge Silvino Pampilo (Manila Regional Trial Court Branch 26) acquitted Marcos of 32 counts of dollar salting (involving £430m in Swiss bank accounts) due to reasonable doubt. Marcos stated: &quot;First of all, I am so happy and I thank the Lord that the 32 cases have been dismissed by the regional court here in Manila. This will subtract from the 901 cases that were filed against the Marcoses.&quot; Her lawyer Robert Sison said that she has 10 pending criminal cases remaining before the Sandiganbayan Courts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/topofthehour.aspx?StoryId=111684  abs-cbnnews.com, Imelda not guilty of dollar salting]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ukpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5ixPg300gwSH1UrpdBIyWOsGOE6WQ, ukpress.google.com,  Marcos cleared of illegal money move]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 14, 2010, the Sandiganbayan's Fifth Division has ordered Imelda Marcos to return 12 million pesos ($280,000) in government funds secretly taken out by her late husband from the National Food Authority 27 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://billionaires.forbes.com/article/0dwR4KoaiK929?q=Ferdinand+Marcos%2C+Jr.+%28politician%29 &quot;Philippine court orders Imelda Marcos to return $280,000 seized from food agency&quot;], ''Washington Post''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===In Philippine Social Scene===
[[File:Irm.jpg|thumbnail|right|Imelda Marcos]]
In July 2008, Imelda Marcos celebrated her 80th birthday at a lavish and glitzy party of former first lady, Madame Imelda Marcos at the grand ballroom of Hotel Sofitel.&lt;ref&gt; http://serenityoverload.blogspot.com/2009/07/imelda-marcos-80th-birthday-celebration.html &lt;/ref&gt;  Marcos' party, which aides said was paid for by friends, was reminiscent of the extravagant gatherings she threw in her heyday. Opera singers and a pianist performed on a stage adorned with her portrait. Marcos-era friends showed up, including former Indonesian first lady Ratna Sari Dewi Sukarno, who flew in from Japan for the party.&lt;ref&gt; http://ohnotheydidnt.livejournal.com/36822340.html#ixzz28Qu2GcNX &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Imelda Marcos attended the Enrile book launch on September 27 of &quot;Juan Ponce Enrile: A Memoir&quot; in the Rigodon Ballroom of The Peninsula Manila in Makati.  It was one party that would have been unthinkable in 1972, 1983, 1986 or even 2001. Mrs. Marcos gamely traded niceties with President Aquino whose mother, the late President Cory Aquino, ousted her husband, former President Ferdinand Marcos, in a bloodless People Power Revolution in 1986.&lt;ref&gt; http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/279262/unthinkable-guess-who-came-to-enrile-book-launch &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;
