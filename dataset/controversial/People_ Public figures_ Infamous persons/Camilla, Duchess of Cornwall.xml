'''Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Dame Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order|GCVO]]}} (Camilla Rosemary; ''née'' '''Shand''', previously '''Parker Bowles'''; born 17 July 1947&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile: Camilla Parker Bowles&quot;/&gt;) is the second wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], and a member of the [[British Royal Family]]. By her second marriage she shares her husband's titles as [[Duchess of Cornwall]], [[Duchess of Rothesay]], [[Countess of Chester (title)|Countess of Chester]] and [[Baroness of Renfrew]]. Although she is the Princess of Wales because of her marriage to the Prince of Wales, she prefers to be known by the secondary title of Duchess of Cornwall (Duchess of Rothesay in Scotland) out of respect for her husband's first wife, the late [[Diana, Princess of Wales]].&lt;ref name=&quot;trh&quot;&gt;[http://www.royal.gov.uk/ThecurrentRoyalFamily/TheDuchessofCornwall/StyleandTitles.aspx The Duchess of Cornwall]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duchess had two children from her marriage to [[Andrew Parker Bowles]] and has five grandchildren.

==Early life==
{{British Royal Family}}
Born at [[King's College Hospital]], [[London]],&lt;ref group=fn&gt;Some sources report that HRH was born in Plumpton, but it seems that this is a confusion of her childhood home as her birth place.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Camilla-Parker-Bowles-9542218 |title=— Camilla Parker Bowles Biography |publisher=Biography.com |date=17 July 1947 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;on 17 July 1947, Shand was raised opposite the [[Plumpton Racecourse]], [[East Sussex]] by her parents, [[Bruce Shand|Major Bruce Shand]] (1917–2006) (a [[British Army]] officer, turned [[Vintner|wine merchant]], as well as [[prisoner of war]] in [[World War II]] who received the [[Military Cross]] with Bar) and [[the Honourable]] [[Rosalind Maud Cubitt|Rosalind Cubitt]] (1921–1994, eldest child of [[Roland Cubitt, 3rd Baron Ashcombe|Roland Calvert Cubitt, 3rd Baron Ashcombe]]). Her siblings are [[Mark Shand]] and Annabel Shand Elliot.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile: Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall&quot;/&gt; Her maternal great-grandmother, [[Alice Keppel]], formerly Alice Frederica [[Edmonstone baronets|Edmonstone]], was a [[royal mistress]], of King [[Edward VII]] from 1898 to 1910.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile: Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall&quot;/&gt;
She was baptised on 1 November 1947 at Firle Church, Sussex. Her godparents were the [[Hon.]] [[Henry Cubitt, 4th Baron Ashcombe|Harry Cubitt]] (her maternal uncle), Major Neil Speke, [[Heathcoat-Amory baronets|Heathcoat Amory]], Lombard Hobson and Vivien Mosley.&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;&gt;[[The Times]], 21 October 1944.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[[The Times]], 5 August 1942.&lt;/ref&gt;

Camilla attended Dumbrells School, a [[co-educational school]] in [[Sussex]] at the age of 5. At the age of 10 she attended fashionable [[Queen's Gate School]] in [[South Kensington]] and left with one O-level. Then, at the age of 16, she attended the Mon Fertile [[finishing school]] in [[Switzerland]] and studied at the [[University of London Institute in Paris|Institut Britannique in Paris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile: Camilla Parker Bowles&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Profile: Camilla Parker Bowles|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4252971.stm|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=8 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Following her education, she made her London debut as a [[debutante]] in 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile: Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/royals/camilla.html Profile: Camilla Duchess of Cornwall, Indepth: The Royal Family]&lt;/ref&gt;

After moving from home, Camilla lived in a two-bedroom flat in Cundy Street at the back end of [[Belgravia]], sharing with Moyra Campbell, the daughter of [[James Hamilton, 4th Duke of Abercorn]], who had been a maid of honour to [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] at her [[coronation]] and whose mother was a close friend to [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]]. Lady Moyra moved out when she married. Her new flat mate became Virginia Carrington, daughter of the conservative politician and a former Guards Officer, [[Peter Carington, 6th Baron Carrington|Lord Carrington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Christopher|title=The Windsor Knot|year=2003|publisher=[[Citadel Press]]|location=Chp.1 Four in the Morning|pages=16–17|isbn= 978-0-8065-2386-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Camilla worked as a part-time [[secretary]] and later took a job at the decorating firm of [[Sibyl Colefax]] and [[John Beresford Fowler|John Fowler]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Profile: Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall&quot;/&gt;
She also became an avid [[Equestrianism|equestrienne]] and participated in [[fox hunting]] (with the [[Beaufort Hunt]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Clover|first=Charles|title=Beaufort Hunt 'broke rules on fox breeding'|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1341954/Beaufort-Hunt-broke-rules-on-fox-breeding.html|accessdate=18 September 2012|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=10 June 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; until its ban in 2004. Her interests include horse-riding, gardening and [[horticulture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|title=The rise and rise of Queen Camilla|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2005/feb/13/monarchy.davidsmith|date=12 February 2005|accessdate=1 March 2012|location=London|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==First marriage==
''[[The Times]]'' announced the engagement of Camilla and  [[British Army]] officer [[Andrew Parker Bowles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;/&gt;  On 4 July 1973, 26-year old Camilla married 34-year old Andrew Parker Bowles at the [[Guards Chapel, Wellington Barracks|Guards Chapel]], [[Wellington Barracks, London]]. Their [[bridesmaid]]s included Parker Bowles' goddaughter [[Lady Emma Herbert]].&lt;ref&gt;'Major A.H. Parker Bowles and Miss C.R. Shand' in ''[[The Times]]'', 5 July 1973&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding was attended by 800 guests including [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]], [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Tina|title=The Diana Chronicles|year=2007|page=125|publisher=Anchor|isbn=978-0-385-51708-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple made their home in [[Wiltshire]], living in the 14th century manor house [[Bolehyde Manor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Barber&quot;/&gt;  They had two children: [[Tom Parker Bowles|Tom]], born in the year after their marriage, who is a [[Godchild|godson]] of Prince Charles, and [[Laura Lopes|Laura]], born in 1978; both children were raised in their father's [[Roman Catholic]] faith, although both were married in the [[Church of England]]; Tom, like his father, is [[Hereditary_peer#Inheritance_of_titles|in remainder]] to the [[Earldom of Macclesfield]]. The couple divorced on 3 March 1995. They were married for 22 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Royal Romance Interactive Timeline|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/elements/2005/03/18/in_depth_world/timeline681722.shtml|publisher=CBS News|date= 18 March 2005|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with the Prince of Wales==
[[File:Charlesandcamilla1975.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Charles and Camilla in the early 1970s]]

The relationship between Camilla and [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] began when they met at a [[polo]] match in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jackson|first=Ben|title=Camilla's clinch for Charles' first love|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/royals/2312089/Camillas-clinch-for-Charles-first-love.html|work=The Sun|date=11 March 2009|accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were introduced to one another by Lucia Santa Cruz, an old girlfriend of the Prince of Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Alderson|first=Andrew|title=Prince Charles takes Camilla to lunch with 'first girlfriend' in Chile|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/theroyalfamily/4959269/Prince-Charles-takes-Camilla-to-lunch-with-first-girlfriend-in-Chile.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=9 March 2009|accessdate=6 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seward|first=Ingrid|title=The Queen and Di|year=2001|location=Double Standards|publisher= Arcade Publishing|page=139|isbn=1-55970-561-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though she became one of the numerous girlfriends of Charles, and the Prince of Wales was said to have wanted to marry her, she was seen by royal courtiers as an unsuitable match for the future king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Edwards|first=Anne|title=Ever After: Diana and the Life She Led|year=2001|publisher=St. Martin's Paperbacks|isbn=978-0312978730|pages=85-86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Lacey]] wrote in his 2002 book, ''Royal: Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II'', that Charles had met Camilla too early, and that he had not asked her to wait for him when he went overseas for military duties in 1972. It has been suggested by a member in the close circle of his great-uncle [[Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma|Lord Mountbatten]] that Mountbatten arranged for Charles to be posted overseas to end the relationship with Camilla, and to pave a way for a possible engagement to his granddaughter, [[Amanda Knatchbull]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bradford|first=Sarah|title=Diana|year=2007|location=Footnote 10|publisher=Penguin (Non-Classics)|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=YUWj6uKYHM4C&amp;pg=PT37&amp;dq=with+Camilla,+and+to+pave+a+way+for+a+possible+engagement+to+his+granddaughter,+Amanda+Knatchbull&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KfiXT7uoIuTu0gGV0eHrBg&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=with%20Camilla%2C%20and%20to%20pave%20a%20way%20for%20a%20possible%20engagement%20to%20his%20granddaughter%2C%20Amanda%20Knatchbull&amp;f=false|isbn=0-14-311246-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles was heartbroken when he heard of the engagement of Camilla and Andrew Parker Bowles in 1973, writing to Lord Mountbatten: &quot;I suppose the feeling of emptiness will pass eventually.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barber&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| title = 'Quite grand, and she doesn't tip' | work =[[The Daily Telegraph]] |url =http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/3604909/Quite-grand-and-she-doesnt-tip.html|date=21 October 2003|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelley|first=Kitty|title=The Royals|year=1997|publisher=Warner Books|isbn=978-0446517126|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless they remained friends, and renewed their romantic relationship in the late 1970s and late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4252931.stm |title=Q&amp;A: Charles and Camilla |publisher=BBC News  |date=22 March 2005 |accessdate=27 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aware of the renewal, Andrew Parker Bowles reportedly gave full consent to the relationship during their marriage. The press later derided him as the &quot;man who laid down his wife for his country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelley|first=Kitty|title=The royals|year=1997|publisher=Hachette Digital, Inc|page=465|isbn=978-0-446-51712-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The affair became public knowledge a decade later, with the publication of ''Diana: Her True Story'' in 1992, followed by the ''Camillagate scandal,'' wherein an intimate telephone conversation between Camilla and Charles was secretly recorded and the transcripts published in the [[Tabloid journalism|tabloids]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Linton  |first=David  |year=2006 |month=March |title=Camillagate: Prince Charles and the Tampon Scandal  |journal=Sex Roles |volume=54 |issue=5–6 |pages=347–351 |id= |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/u81w0th741113315/ |accessdate=8 September 2008 |quote= |doi=10.1007/s11199-006-9004-4 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the relationship in the open, Diana gave an interview on the [[BBC]] programme ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]],'' during which she was asked if she thought the relationship between Camilla and the Prince of Wales contributed to the breakdown of their marriage, to which she replied, &quot;Well, there were three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC1]]. [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/politics97/diana/panorama.html The Panorama interview with the Princess of Wales]. November 1995. Retrieved 26 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, Sarah, ''Diana''(2006),p.294&lt;/ref&gt; Though Camilla kept a low profile at all times, she became unpopular by these revelations.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/europe/02/10/charles.history/ CNN story &quot;Love spans more than 30 years&quot; claims bread roll pelting.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was confirmed by Charles in a televised interview with [[Jonathan Dimbleby]] that the relationship between him and Camilla resumed during their crumbling marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Dimbleby, Jonathan, ''The Prince of Wales, A Biography'', p.395&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, the Parker Bowleses announced their own divorce in 1995,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince of Wales 'mistress' to divorce|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/prince-of-wales-mistress-to-divorce 1567448.html|publisher=Independent u.k|date=11 January 1995|accessdate=6 March 2012|location=London|first=Danny|last=Penman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Glauber|first=Bill|title=Charles, Camilla: Together again?|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1995-01-11/features/1995011135_1_divorce-prince-charles-charles-and-princess|publisher=The Baltimore Sun|date= 11 January 1995|accessdate=10 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;having been living apart for some time, and a year later [[Andrew Parker Bowles]] married his long-time mistress and companion Rosemary Pitman.

Discreetly, Camilla occasionally became Charles's unofficial companion at events. This temporarily ceased when Diana, Princess of Wales died in August 1997, but in 1999, they were photographed together in public at the [[Ritz Hotel]] in London where they attended a birthday party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mine|first=Shaun|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/OUT%3b+Charles+and+Camilla+go+public.-a060365800|title=OUT; Charles and Camilla go public|location=The free library|publisher=Daily Record|date= 29 January 1999|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Archer|first=Peter|title=Together at Last; Charles and Camilla side by side for the cameras for the first time.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/TOGETHER+AT+LAST%3b+Charles+and+Camilla+side+by+side+for+the+cameras...-a060485875|location= The free Library|publisher=Coventry Evening Telegraph (England)|date= 29 January 1999|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though she maintained her residence in [[Wiltshire]], Camilla then moved into [[Clarence House]], the former home of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, which became Charles' household in 2003, resulting in decorative changes to both homes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Colin|title=Camilla Moves in with Charles: Wife in all but name|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/CAMILLA+MOVES+IN+WITH+CHARLES%3b+Wife+in+all+but+name.-a086568813|publisher=Sunday (mail) (Glasgow Scotland)|location=The free library|date= 2 June 2002|accessdate=5 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; though [[Buckingham Palace]] was explicit in pointing out that public funds had not been used for the redecorations. In 2005, the media reported that Charles was spending on Camilla with public funds, this received a lot of negative publicity and as a result, an investigation by the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons began probing in Charles' finances about the report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mackay|first=Caitlin|title=Camilla costs in probe|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Camilla+costs+in+probe.-a0128122559|location= The free library|publisher=The Mirror (London, England)|date=5 February 2005|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prince|first=Rosa|title=MPs PROBES SPENDING ON CAMILLA; Aides quizzed over bills|url= http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MPs+PROBE+SPENDING+ON+CAMILLA%3b+Aides+quizzed+over+bills.-a0128123554|location=The free library|publisher = Daily Record (Glasgow, Scotland)|date=5 February 2005|accessdate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Image rehabilitation==
Following the couples' divorces, Charles stated his relationship with Camilla was, and is, &quot;non-negotiable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jobson|first=Robert|title=Charles: Camilla is central to my life|url=http://www.standard.co.uk/news/charles-camilla-is-central-to-my-life-6351682.html|accessdate=18 August 2012|newspaper=[[Evening Standard]]|date=17 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mclaren|first=Leah|title=An honest woman at last?|date=11 May 2002|accessdate=6 March 2012|url=http://mattoid.com/data/People/Camilla_an_honest_woman_at_last.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mcallister|first=J.F.O|title=The 34-Year Courtship|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1027460,00.html|accessdate=18 August 2012|newspaper=[[Time (magazine){{!}}Time magazine]]|date=13 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Braemargames 2006 08.jpg|thumb|[[Elizabeth II]], accompanied by the Duke and Duchess of Rothesay, during the 2006 [[Braemar|Braemar Gathering]]]]

At the time of Charles and Diana's divorce until Diana's death, Camilla was a hated figure in the press and to the public. Charles was aware that their relationship was receiving a lot of public attention, and appointed [[Mark Bolland]], recruited by Charles in 1995 to refurbish his own image, to enhance Camilla's image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark Bolland: Marital aide|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/mark-bolland-marital-aide-6149523.html|work=[[The Independent]]|date=30 March 2005|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As part of this effort to burnish her reputation, Camilla became the President of the [[National Osteoporosis Society]], which first introduced her to the public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tweedie&quot;/&gt;
In 2000, her status was strengthened when she accompanied the Prince of Wales to [[Scotland]] for a series of official engagements.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tweedie&quot;/&gt; She later met the Queen for the first time since the relationship came out at the 60th birthday party of [[Constantine II of Greece|King Constantine II of Greece]].

On 10 February 2005, it was announced by [[Clarence House]] that Camilla and the Prince of Wales were engaged; Camilla had been presented with an engagement ring that had belonged to the late [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother]]. Charles proposed on bended knee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=stritof|first=Bobsher,Sheri|title=Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles|url=http://marriage.about.com/od/royalty/p/princecharles.htm|publisher=Marriage Profile}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As he is the future [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]], the prospect of Charles marrying a divorcée was seen as controversial, but with the consent of the Queen, Parliament and the Church of England, the couple were able to wed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prince Charles to marry longtime lover Camilla|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6945019/ns/world_news/t/prince-charles-marry-longtime-lover-camilla/#.T1VpKfF5mK0|publisher=Msnbc World News|date=2/11/2005|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage was to have been on 8 April 2005, and was to take place in a civil ceremony at [[Windsor Castle]], with a subsequent religious blessing at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor|St George's Chapel]]. To conduct a civil marriage at Windsor Castle would oblige the venue to obtain a licence for civil marriages, which it did not have. A condition of such a licence is that the licensed venue must be available for a period of one year to anyone wishing to be married there. As the Royal Family did not wish to make Windsor Castle available to the public for civil marriages, even just for one year, the location was changed to the town hall at [[Windsor Guildhall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prince Charles, Camilla change wedding plans|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-02-18/news/0502190039_1_charles-and-camilla-windsor-castle-charles-clarence-house|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=18 February 2005|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles and Camilla change wedding venue|url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities-news-in-pics/17-02-2005/0/|publisher=Hello Magazine|date=17 February 2005|accessdate=30 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the title 'Princess of Wales' became strongly associated with the previous holder of that title, the late [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], Camilla has adopted the feminine form of her husband's highest-ranking subsidiary title, [[Duke of Cornwall]].&lt;ref name=trh/&gt; Unless any specific Act of Parliament is passed by the Parliament of the United Kingdom (and other Commonwealth States) to the contrary, if Prince Charles becomes King&lt;!--not &quot;King Charles III&quot;, since it matters not which title he chooses--&gt;, she can assume by courtesy the style of &quot;Queen Camilla&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |title=Camilla can legally be queen|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=24 May 2009 |url=http://www.cbc.ca/world/story/2005/03/21/camilla-queen050321.html |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article514274.ece/ |title=Camilla might still become Queen|work=The Times |location=UK |accessdate=24 May 2009  |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, continued controversy about her ascendence raised the continuing likelihood that she might retain a [[morganatic marriage|morganatic]] style, albeit by courtesy—she would always be entitled to the rank and style of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.princeofwales.gov.uk/mediacentre/pressreleases/announcement_of_the_marriage_of_hrh_the_prince_of_wales_and__167.html Clarence House press release], 10 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Clarence House stated that when Charles becomes King, Camilla will adopt the unprecedented style of [[Princess Consort]], similar to the style of [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]]. This is not the same usage as her father-in-law, [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|The Duke of Edinburgh]], who does not hold the title of ''Prince Consort'' (although as a prince and a consort, he is the Queen's [[prince consort]]).

Through her French lineage, Camilla's maternal line great-great-grandmother was Sophia Mary MacNab of [[Hamilton, Ontario]], who was the descendant of 17th century immigrants to [[Quebec]], daughter of Sir [[Allan MacNab]], and wife of [[William Keppel, 7th Earl of Albemarle|William Coutts Keppel, Earl of Albemarle]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Duchess of Cornwall&quot;/&gt; Their son, George, was husband to [[Alice Keppel|Alice Edmonstone]], who was the [[royal mistress]] of King [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Edward VII]], the great-great-grandfather of Prince Charles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Duchess of Cornwall&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Camilla, Her Royal Highness the Duchess of Cornwall|url=http://www.perche-quebec.com/files/camilla/individus/camilla_en.htm|publisher=www.perche-quebec.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also through The Honourable [[George Keppel (soldier)|George Keppel]] on Camilla's side and through the [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen Mother]] on Charles' side, Camilla and Charles are ninth cousins once removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kissing cousins!|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Kissing+cousins!-a0131294217|work=The free library|publisher=Evening Chronicle (Newcastle, England)|date=9 April 2005|accessdate=9 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Experts Discover that Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles are Related|url=http://corporate.ancestry.com/press/press-releases/2005/04/experts-discover-that-prince-charles-and-camilla-parker-bowles-are-related/|work=[[Ancestry.com]]|accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
