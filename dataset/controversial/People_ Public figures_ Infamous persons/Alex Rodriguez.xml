'''Alexander Emmanuel''' &quot;'''Alex'''&quot; '''Rodriguez''' (born July 27, 1975) is an [[United States|American]] [[baseball]] [[third baseman]] for the [[New York Yankees]] of [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB). Known popularly by his nickname '''A-Rod''', he previously played [[shortstop]] for the [[Seattle Mariners]] and the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]].

Rodriguez is considered one of the best all-around baseball players of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://villagevoice.com/nyclife/0635,barra,74310,15.html|title=Atlas slugged|author=Allen Barra|date=August 29, 2006|publisher=[[The Village Voice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1208/is_14_228/ai_114985740|title=Alex the greatest for the second straight year, general managers put A-Rod at the top of our list of baseball's 50 best players|author=Stan McNeal|date=January 17, 2008|publisher=[[Sporting News]]}}{{Dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/02allstar/2002-07-09-survey.htm|title=Players tab Bonds as game's best player|author=Gary Graves|date=January 17, 2008|work=USA Today }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the youngest player ever to hit [[500 home run club|500 home run]]s, breaking the record [[Jimmie Foxx]] set in 1939, and the youngest to hit [[600 home run club|600]], besting [[Babe Ruth]]'s record by over a year. Rodriguez has fourteen 100-[[runs batted in|RBI]] seasons in his career, more than any other player in history. On September 24, 2010, Rodriguez hit two home runs, surpassing [[Sammy Sosa]]'s mark of 609 home runs, and became the all-time leader in home runs by a player of [[Hispanic]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/7572/instant-info-fireworks-in-the-bronx |title=Alex Rodriguez |publisher=ESPN |date=September 25, 2010 |accessdate=September 2, 20108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, Rodriguez and the Yankees agreed to a 10-year, $275&amp;nbsp;million contract. This contract was the richest contract in baseball history (breaking his previous record of $252&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20071213&amp;content_id=2324707&amp;vkey=news_nyy&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nyy|title=The Official|title=Site of The New York Yankees: News: Yankees finalize deal with A-Rod}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, after previously denying use of [[performance-enhancing drugs]], including during a 2007 interview with [[Katie Couric]] on ''[[60 Minutes]]'', Rodriguez admitted to using [[steroids]], saying he used them from 2001 to 2003 when playing for the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] due to what he called &quot;an enormous amount of pressure&quot; to perform.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPNadmission&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=ESPN|title=A-Rod admits, regrets use of PEDs|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3894847|first=Peter|last=Gammons|date=February 9, 2009|accessdate=February 9, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090211024425/http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3894847| archivedate= February 11 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTadmission&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/sports/baseball/10Rodriguez.html|title=Rodriguez Admits to Using Performance-Enhancing Drugs|first=Michael S.|last=Schmidt|date=February 9, 2009|accessdate=February 9, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090211025643/http://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/10/sports/baseball/10rodriguez.html| archivedate= February 11 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
===Background===
Rodriguez was born in the [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] section of New York City to a Dominican family. When he was four, Rodriguez and his parents moved to the Dominican Republic, then to [[Miami]], Florida. Rodriguez's favorite baseball players growing up were [[Keith Hernandez]], [[Dale Murphy]], and [[Cal Ripken]], and his favorite team was the [[New York Mets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jockbio.com/Bios/ARod/ARod_bio.html |title=Alex Rodriguez |publisher=Jockbio |date=July 27, 1975 |accessdate=August 4, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100820044819/http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/ARod/ARod_bio.html| archivedate= August 20 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High school===
Rodriguez was a star shortstop at Miami's [[Westminster Christian School (Florida)|Westminster Christian High School]]. In 100 games he batted .419 with 90 steals. Westminster went on to win the high school national championship in his junior year. He was first team prep All-American as a senior, hitting .505 with 9 home runs, 36 RBIs, and 35 steals in 35 tries in 33 games, and was selected as the USA Baseball Junior Player of the Year and as [[Gatorade]]'s national baseball student athlete of the year. Rodriguez was the first high school player to ever try out for Team USA in 1993, and was regarded as the top prospect in the country.

===College===
Rodriguez signed a letter of intent to play baseball for the [[University of Miami]] and was also recruited by the university to play quarterback for its football team. Rodriguez turned down Miami's baseball scholarship and never played college baseball, opting instead to sign with the Seattle Mariners after being selected in the first round of the amateur draft at the age of 17.

==Professional career==
===Seattle Mariners===
[[File:Alex Rodriguez Cannons 1.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Rodriguez batting as a member of the AAA [[Calgary Cannons]] in 1994.]]
Rodriguez was [[1993 Major League Baseball Draft|drafted first overall]] by the [[Seattle Mariners]] in 1993. He was signed by Roger Jongewaard right out of high school. In 1994, Rodriguez played for Seattle's AAA affiliate, the [[Calgary Cannons]]. In 32 games, he had 37 hits in 119 at bats for a .311 batting average. He also compiled 6 home runs and 21 runs batted in. Rodriguez rose rapidly through the Mariners organization, and made his major league debut as the starting shortstop on July 8, 1994, in [[Boston Red Sox|Boston]] at 18 years, 11 months, and 11 days of age. He was just the third 18-year-old Major League shortstop since 1900. He was also the first 18-year-old Major League player in 10 years, and the youngest position player in Seattle history. His first Major League hit was a single off [[Sergio Valdez]] on July 9 at [[Fenway Park]]. Rodriguez's first Major League campaign lasted just one month; the season was cut short by the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike]].

Rodriguez then split most of 1995 between the Mariners and their [[minor league baseball|AAA]] club, the [[Tacoma Rainiers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Street|first=Jim|title=Rodriguez Shuttled Back To AAA Tacoma|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=August 16, 1995|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/archives/1995/9508160011.asp|accessdate=April 30, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He connected for his first Major League home run off Kansas City's [[Tom Gordon]] on June 12. Rodriguez joined the Major League roster permanently in August, and got his first taste of postseason play, albeit in just two at-bats. Again, he was the youngest player in Major League Baseball.

====1996: First full season and breakout year====
The following year, Rodriguez took over as the Mariners' regular [[shortstop]] (SS) and hit 36 HR, drove in 123 runs, and led the [[American League]] (AL) with a .358 [[batting average]], the highest for an AL right-handed batter since [[Joe DiMaggio]] hit .381 in 1939 and the 3rd highest ever for a SS. At 21 years and one month, he was the 3rd youngest AL batting leader ever behind [[Al Kaline]] (20) in 1955 and [[Ty Cobb]] (20) in 1907, and the 3rd youngest player in history with 35+ homers. He was also the 1st major league SS to win a [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|batting title]] since 1960, and the 1st in the AL since 1944, and at 20 years, 11 months, was the youngest SS in [[MLB All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] history. He also led the AL in runs (141), total bases (379), and [[double (baseball)|doubles]] (54) and ranked among the league leaders in hits (2nd, 215), extra base hits (2nd, 91), multi-hit games (3rd, 65), slugging (4th, .631), RBI (8th, 123), and on-base percentage (8th, .414). Rodriguez posted the highest totals ever for a shortstop in runs, hits, doubles, extra base hits, and slugging, and tied most total bases, and established Seattle club records for average, runs, hits, doubles, and total bases, in a season that statistical analysts consider the best ever by an SS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/columns/bp/1249068.html|title=Aurilia makes sure Giants aren't one-man show|author=[[Joe Sheehan]]|date=September 7, 2001|publisher=ESPN }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was selected by both ''[[Sporting News]]'' and [[Associated Press]] as the Major League Player of the Year, and came close to becoming the youngest [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|MVP (Most Valuable Player)]] in baseball history, finishing second to [[Juan González (baseball)|Juan González]] in one of the most controversial MVP elections in recent times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/page2/s/list/MVPcontroversy.html?partnersite=espn|title=The List: Most controversial MVPs|author=David Schoenfield|date=November 17, 2003|publisher=ESPN.com|work=Page 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished three points behind González (290–287), matching the 2nd closest AL MVP voting in history.

====1997–99 seasons====
In 1997, Rodriguez's numbers fell somewhat, as he hit 23 HRs with 84 RBI and a .300 batting average that year. He [[hitting for the cycle|hit for the cycle]] on June 5 at [[Detroit Tigers|Detroit]], becoming the second Mariner to ever accomplish the feat, and at 21 years, 10 months, was 5th youngest player in history to do it. He was the fan's choice to start the [[MLB All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] at shortstop for the AL team, becoming the first player other than [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] to start at shortstop in 13 years. It was the first All-Star start of his career and his second All-Star Game in two years.

Rodriguez rebounded in 1998, setting the AL record for homers by a shortstop and becoming just the third member of the [[40–40 club]], (with 42 HR and 46 [[stolen base|SB]]) and one of just 3 shortstops in history to hit 40 home runs in a season. His 43.9 [[Power-speed number]] was, through at least 2008, the highest single season Power/Speed Number ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/power_speed_number_leagues.shtml |title=Yearly League Leaders &amp;amp Records for Power-Speed # |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=August 4, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100814001336/http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/power_speed_number_leagues.shtml| archivedate= August 14 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was selected as Players Choice AL Player of the Year, won his 2nd [[Silver Slugger Award]] and finished in the top 10 in the MVP voting.

In 1999, he again hit 42 HR, despite missing over 30 games with an injury and playing the second half of the season at [[Safeco Field]], a considerably less hitter-friendly ballpark than the [[Kingdome]].

====2000: Final season in Seattle====
Rodriguez entered 2000 as the cornerstone player of the Mariners franchise, which had recently dealt superstars [[Randy Johnson]] and [[Ken Griffey, Jr]]. Rodriguez put up great numbers as the team's remaining superstar; he hit 41 HR with 132 RBI and had a .316 batting average. He set a career high for [[Base on balls|walks]] (100) and became the only shortstop to have 100 runs, RBI, and walks in the same season. He hit well in the playoffs as well (.409 batting average and .773 slugging percentage), but Seattle lost to the [[New York Yankees]] in the [[2000 American League Championship Series]].

He was selected as the Major League Player of the Year by [[Baseball America]] and finished 3rd in the [[BBWAA]] AL MVP voting.

===Texas Rangers===
Rodriguez became a [[free agent]] after the 2000 season. He eventually signed with the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]], who had fallen to last in their division in 2000. The contract he signed was at the time the most lucrative contract in sports history: a 10-year deal worth $252&amp;nbsp;million. The deal was worth $63&amp;nbsp;million more than the second-richest baseball deal.&lt;ref name=ARodRangers&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/12/sports/sp-64536|author=Jason Reid|title=Texas-Sized Deal|date=December 12, 2000|periodical=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Rodriguez signed with Texas, when the Rangers came to Seattle, Mariner fans expressed their disappointment toward Rodriguez with jeers and flashing and waving Monopoly money whenever he came up to bat. To this day, fans still show disapproval.

In an article written years later in the ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'', Rodriguez said how he regretted signing with the Texas Rangers and wished he had signed with the [[New York Mets]] rather than Texas. Rodriguez stated how he listened to his agent [[Scott Boras]] about taking more money instead and did not want to make the same mistake of not being on a team he liked playing for by leaving the Yankees. (see [[Alex Rodriguez#Opt-out controversy|Opt out controversy]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=News |first=Daily |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2008-03-24/sports/17893728_1_hank-and-hal-decision-yankees |title=A-Rod regrets saying no to Mets, doesn't make same mistake with Yankees - New York Daily News |publisher=Articles.nydailynews.com |date=2008-03-24 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2001–02: Record-breaking seasons====
Rodriguez's power hitting numbers improved with his move to Texas. In his first season with the Rangers, Rodriguez produced one of the top offensive seasons ever for a shortstop, leading the American League with 52 HR, 133 runs scored, and 393 total bases. He became the first player since 1932 with 50 homers and 200 hits in a season, just the third shortstop to ever lead his league in homers, and was just the second AL player in the last 34 seasons (beginning 1968) to lead the league in runs, homers, and total bases; his total base figure is the most ever for a major league shortstop. His 52 homers made him the sixth youngest to ever reach 50 homers and were the highest total ever by a shortstop, surpassing [[Ernie Banks]]' record of 47 in 1958, and also the most ever for an infielder other than a 1st baseman, breaking Phillies 3B [[Mike Schmidt]]'s mark of 48 in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HR_season.shtml|title=Single-Season Leaders &amp; Records for Home Runs|accessdate=July 20, 2007|publisher=[[Baseball-Reference]]| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070620135024/http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HR_season.shtml| archivedate= June 20 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his 5th 30-homer campaign, tying Banks for most ever by a shortstop. He also tied for the league lead in extra base hits (87) and ranked 3rd in RBI (135) and slugging (.622). He was also among the AL leaders in hits (4th, 201), average (7th, .318), and on-base percentage (8th, .399). He established Rangers club records for homers, runs, total bases, and [[hit by pitch]]es, had the 2nd most extra base hits, and the 4th highest RBI total. He led the club in runs, hits, doubles (34), homers, RBI, slugging, and on-base percentage and was 2nd in walks (75), stolen bases (18), and game-winning RBI (14) while posting career highs for homers, RBI, and total bases. Rodriguez started 161 games at shortstop and one as the [[Designated hitter|DH]], the only major league player to start all of his team's games in 2001.

He followed that with a major league-best 57 HR, 142 RBIs and 389 total bases in 2002, becoming the first player to lead the majors in all three categories since 1984. His nine home runs in April matched a team record that was shared (through 2008) with [[Iván Rodríguez]] (2000), [[Carl Everett]] (2003), and [[Ian Kinsler]] (2007). He had the 6th-most home runs in AL history, the most since [[Roger Maris]]' league record 61 in 1961, and the most ever for a shortstop for the 2nd straight year. He won the [[Babe Ruth Home Run Award]] for leading MLB in homers that season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sanchez |first=Jesse |title=Notes: Strength in the message |date=May 23, 2003 |work=MLB.com |publisher=MLB Advanced Media |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20030523&amp;content_id=334171&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=null |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/633TFGqfg |archivedate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also won his first [[Gold Glove Award]], awarded for outstanding defense.

His 109 home runs in 2001–02 are the most ever by an American League [[right-handed]] batter in consecutive seasons. However, the Rangers finished last in the [[American League West|AL Western division]] in both years, a showing that likely cost Rodriguez the [[MVP]] award in 2002 when he finished second to fellow shortstop [[Miguel Tejada]], whose 103-win [[Oakland A's]] won the same division.

====2003: American League Most Valuable Player====
In 2003, his last season with Texas, Rodriguez led the American League in home runs, runs scored, and slugging percentage, and won his second consecutive [[Gold Glove|Gold Glove Award]]. He also led the league in fewest at bats per home run (12.9) and became the youngest player to hit 300 homers. He was tied with [[Jim Thome]] for the MLB lead in homers, and he won his second Babe Ruth Home Run Award.&lt;ref name=morrissey&gt;{{cite news |last=Morrissey |first=Michael |title=Hospital ward in Bronx |date=June 6, 2004 |newspaper=[[New York Post]] |page=50 |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/nypost/access/649975151.html?dids=649975151:649975151&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+06%2C+2004&amp;author=MICHAEL+MORRISSEY&amp;pub=New+York+Post&amp;desc=HOSPITAL+WARD+IN+BRONX&amp;pqatl=google |accessdate=November 8, 2011 |quote=Before the game, Rodriguez received the Babe Ruth Award (for most homers in the majors last season) from Ruth's daughter and grandson.}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=baberuthcentral&gt;At the following webpage, '''''scroll down to''''' &quot;The Babe Ruth Homerun Award&quot;. {{cite web |title=06 Fan Stories: Ultimate Babe Ruth Fans |work=BabeRuthCentral.com |publisher=Babe Ruth Central |url=http://www.baberuthcentral.com/Fan%20Stories/#HomeRun |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/633STrQVa |archivedate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following five top-10 finishes in the [[American League|AL]] [[Most Valuable Player]] voting between 1996 and 2002, Rodriguez won his first [[MVP]] trophy. A-Rod, a two-time runner up in the balloting by the [[Baseball Writers Association of America]], joined outfielder [[Andre Dawson]] from the 1987 [[Chicago Cubs]] as the only players to play on last-place teams and win the award.

Following the 2003 season, Texas set out to move Rodriguez and his expensive contract. The Rangers initially agreed to a trade with the [[Boston Red Sox]], but the [[Major League Baseball Players Association|MLBPA]] (Major League Baseball Players Association) vetoed the deal because it called for a voluntary reduction in salary by Rodriguez. Despite the failed deal with the Red Sox, the Rangers named him [[captain (baseball)|team captain]] during that off-season. This designation did not last long, however, as the New York Yankees had taken notice of the sudden trade availability of Rodriguez.

On February 7, 2009, ''Sports Illustrated'' reported that Rodriguez tested positive for [[anabolic steroids]], [[testosterone]] and [[Primobolan]], in 2003 (see '''Criticism: Steroid use''', below).&lt;ref name=&quot;SIsteroids&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=Sports Illustrated|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/baseball/mlb/02/07/alex-Rodriguez-steroids/index.html|title=Alex Rodriguez tested positive for steroids in 2003|date=February 7, 2009|accessdate=February 7, 2009|deadurl=yes| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090208115937/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/baseball/mlb/02/07/alex-rodriguez-steroids/index.html| archivedate= February 08 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}} By Selena Roberts and David Epstein.&lt;/ref&gt; Rodriguez's name appears on a government-sealed list of 104 major-league players (out of 1200 tested&lt;ref name=&quot;Glanville&quot;/&gt;) who came up positive for performance-enhancing drugs. The report was compiled as part of Major League Baseball's 2003 survey to see whether mandatory random drug testing program might be necessary. At the time, there was no penalty or punishment for a positive steroid test. Rodriguez did not immediately confirm the allegations, deferring at first to the players' union.&lt;ref name=&quot;SIsteroids&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTsteroids&quot;/&gt; Two days after the allegations, Rodriguez admitted to steroid use from 2001 until 2003, claiming that he ceased using such substances after spring training that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPNadmission&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTadmission&quot;/&gt;

===New York Yankees===
[[File:Alex Rodriguez 2008-05-28.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Rodriguez moved to third base after he was traded to the Yankees in 2004.]]
Yankees third baseman [[Aaron Boone]] suffered a knee injury while playing a game of pickup basketball that sidelined him for the entire 2004 season, creating a hole at third base.

On February 15, 2004, the Rangers traded Rodriguez to the New York Yankees for second baseman [[Alfonso Soriano]] and a player to be named later ([[Joaquín Árias (baseball)|Joaquín Árias]] was sent to the Rangers on March 24). The Rangers also agreed to pay $67&amp;nbsp;million of the $179&amp;nbsp;million left on Rodriguez's contract. Rodriguez agreed to switch positions from shortstop to third base, paving the way for the trade, because the popular [[Derek Jeter]] was already entrenched at shortstop. Rodriguez also had to switch uniform numbers, from 3 to 13; he had worn 3 his entire career, but that number is retired by the Yankees in honor of [[Babe Ruth]].

====2004: First season with Yankees====
In his first season with the Yankees, Rodriguez hit .286 with 36 [[home run]]s, 106 [[runs batted in]], 112 runs scored and 28 [[stolen bases]]. He became one of only three players in Major League history to compile at least 35 home runs, 100 runs and 100 RBI in seven consecutive seasons, joining Hall of Famers Babe Ruth and Jimmie Foxx. The 112 runs marked the ninth straight season in which he scored at least 100 runs, the longest such streak in the Major Leagues since [[Hank Aaron]] did it in 13 straight seasons from 1955 to 1967, and the longest in the American League since [[Mickey Mantle]] did it also in nine straight seasons from 1953 to 1961. During the 2004 season, he also became the youngest player ever to reach the 350 HR mark and the third youngest to reach the 1,000 RBI plateau. He was elected to the 2004 American League All-Star Team, the eighth All-Star selection of his career and the first as a [[third baseman]]. On July 24, 2004, Rodriguez was hit by a pitch from [[Bronson Arroyo]], which led to a scuffle with [[Boston Red Sox]] catcher [[Jason Varitek]] and a bench-clearing brawl between both teams. On defense, he had the lowest range factor among non-[[platoon system|platoon]] AL third basemen (2.39) in his first year at the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MLB Player Fielding Stats – As 3b – 2004|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/fielding/_/year/2004/position/3b/league/al/sort/rangeFactor/order/true|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He finished 14th in balloting for the [[MLB Most Valuable Player Award|AL MVP Award]].

In the 2004 [[American League Division Series|ALDS]], Rodriguez was a dominant hitter against the [[Minnesota Twins]], batting .421 and slugging .737 while delivering two key extra-inning hits. Following the series win, Rodriguez's first season with the Yankees culminated in a dramatic playoff series against the team he had almost ended up playing for: the Yankees' bitter [[Yankees – Red Sox rivalry|rival]], the [[Boston Red Sox]]. In that series (ALCS) he equaled the single-game post-season record with five runs scored in Game 3 at Boston.

One of the most controversial plays of Rodriguez's career occurred late in Game 6 of the [[2004 American League Championship Series]]. With one out and [[Derek Jeter]] on first base in the bottom of the eighth inning, Rodriguez hit a slow roller between the pitcher's mound and the first base line. Red Sox [[pitcher]] [[Bronson Arroyo]] fielded the ball and ran towards Rodriguez to apply a tag. As Arroyo reached towards him, Rodriguez swatted at his glove, knocking the ball loose. As the ball rolled away, Jeter scored all the way from first as Rodriguez took second on the play, which was initially ruled an error on Arroyo. However, the umpires quickly huddled, then ruled that Rodriguez was out for interference. Jeter was sent back to first base, his run nullified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/features/thestadium/the_greatest/notsogreat-a-rod-slap-play.html |title=Greatest Moments at Yankee Stadium – NY Daily News |work=Daily News |date=October 19, 2004 |accessdate=August 4, 2010 | location=New York |deadurl=yes| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100723142910/http://www.nydailynews.com/features/thestadium/the_greatest/notsogreat-a-rod-slap-play.html| archivedate= July 23 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2005: American League Most Valuable Player====
In 2005, Rodriguez hit .321, leading the American League with 124 runs and 48 HR while driving in 130 runs. He became the first Yankee to win the American League home run title since [[Reggie Jackson]] (41) in 1980. He also became one of only two players in Major League history to compile at least 35 home runs, 100 runs and 100 RBIs in eight consecutive seasons (Jimmie Foxx accomplished the feat in nine straight seasons from 1932 to 1940). Rodriguez established the franchise record for most home runs in a single season by a right-handed batter (broke [[Joe DiMaggio]]'s mark of 46 in 1937). His 47 HR from the third base position are a single-season American League record. Rodriguez hit 26 home runs at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] in 2005, establishing the single-season club record for right-handed batters (previously held by DiMaggio in 1937 and [[Gary Sheffield]] in 2004). On June 8, at 29 years, 316 days old, he became the youngest player in MLB history to reach the 400 HR mark. 2005 also marked the tenth straight season that Rodriguez scored at least 100 runs. On defense, however, he had the lowest range factor in the league at third for the second straight season (2.62).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MLB Player Fielding Stats – As 3b – 2005|url=http://espn.go.com/mlb/stats/fielding/_/year/2005/position/3b/league/al/sort/rangeFactor/order/true|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=May 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An offensive highlight of his season came on April 26, when Rodriguez hit 3 HR off Angels' pitcher [[Bartolo Colón]] and drove in 10 runs. The 10 RBIs were the most by a Yankee since [[Tony Lazzeri]] established the franchise and American League record with 11 on 5/24/36. Rodriguez won his second [[American League MVP|AL MVP]] Award in three seasons.

He became the fifth player to win an MVP award (or its precursor 'League Award') with two different teams, joining [[Mickey Cochrane]], Jimmie Foxx, [[Frank Robinson]] and Barry Bonds. Rodriguez was also named the shortstop on the Major League Baseball [[Latino Legends Team]] in 2005.

====2006 season====
[[File:Alex Rodriguez Talking.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Rodriguez reacting to a called strike in a game against Tampa Bay]]
Rodriguez was again an All-Star in 2006, and was 4th in the league in RBIs (121), 5th in runs (113), 8th in home runs (35) and walks (90), and 9th in OBP (.392). He also led all AL third basemen in errors, with 24, and had the lowest fielding percentage (.937) and – for the third straight season – range factor (2.50) among them. Rodriguez's 2,000th hit, on July 21, 2006, was also his 450th home run. Six days shy of his 31st birthday, Rodriguez became the youngest player in baseball history to reach 450 home runs (surpassing [[Ken Griffey, Jr.]] by 267 days). He also became the 8th player to reach 2,000 hits before turning 31. [[Ty Cobb]] reached the mark while still 29, while [[Rogers Hornsby]], [[Mel Ott]], [[Hank Aaron]], [[Joe Medwick]], Jimmie Foxx, and [[Robin Yount]] all got their 2,000th hits at age 30. All 7 of the players are members of baseball's [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]]. Rodriguez also became the 2nd player in Major League history to have at least 35 home runs, 100 runs, and 100 RBIs in 9 consecutive seasons joining Jimmie Foxx. 2006 was Rodriguez's 11th consecutive season with more than 100 runs scored, the longest such streak in American League history since [[Lou Gehrig]] did it in 13 straight seasons (1926–38). Despite this success, it was one of his lesser seasons and was harshly criticized throughout the 2006 season. He has said that 2006 was his most difficult season as a professional. Prior to the season Rodriguez opted to play for team USA in the [[World Baseball Classic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/16/sports/baseball/16arod.html?ex=1321333200&amp;en=9041663c08366417&amp;ei=5088|title=Rodriguez Says He’s Committed to Yankees|author=Tyler Kepner|date=November 16, 2006|work=The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2007: American League Most Valuable Player====
With the 2007 season came a new attitude. Rodriguez reported to camp lighter, having reduced his [[body fat]] from 16% the year before to 9%. He made light of this fact during a ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' sketch filmed during Spring Training, which featured him shirtless being rubbed down with suntan lotion. He revealed to the press that he and Jeter were no longer close friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A-Rod: friendship with Jeter has cooled|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/17227890|publisher=NBC Sports. Associated Press|accessdate=May 30, 2010|date=February 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodriguez also reduced his high leg kick at the plate, increasing his bat speed, making him less-apt to strike out and a more dangerous hitter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2007/writers/jon_heyman/04/23/scoop.monday/index.html Sports Illustrated], April 23, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Yankees' fourth game of the season, Rodriguez hit two home runs against the [[Baltimore Orioles]] at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], including his 14th-career [[grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] to end the game. The [[walk-off]] grand slam was the third of his career, tying the major league mark for game-ending grand slams shared by [[Vern Stephens]] and [[Cy Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/gameday_recap.jsp?ymd=20070407&amp;content_id=1884768&amp;vkey=recap&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=nyy|title=A-Rod rescues Yanks|author=Bryan Hoch|date=April 7, 2007|publisher=MLB.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=270407110|title=A-Rod blasts two homers, has six RBIs in Yankees win|agency=Associated Press|date=April 7, 2007|publisher=ESPN }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodriguez also began the season by becoming the ninth major leaguer—and first Yankee—to hit six home runs in the first seven games of the season. Rodriguez also became the first Yankee to hit seven home runs in the first ten games of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=270410109|title=A-Rod sets tone early with sixth homer of season|agency=Associated Press|date=April 10, 2007|publisher=ESPN }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 19, the Yankees came from behind to defeat the [[Cleveland Indians]] 8–6—with Rodriguez hitting a walk-off home run. [[WCBS (AM)|WCBS]] Yankees radio broadcaster noted that Rodriguez had a better frame of mind, and the fans were beginning to accept him more after his two walk-off home runs. On April 23, Rodriguez became the first player in major league history to hit 14 home runs in a span of 18 games, and also tied the MLB record for most home runs in April. His total of 34 RBIs in April was 1 short of [[Juan González (baseball)|Juan González]]' AL and MLB record. On April 24, Rodriguez's 23-game hitting streak came to an end. In a game against the Toronto Blue Jays on May 30, Rodriguez sparked controversy when he shouted during a routine play and an infielder let a pop fly drop, costing the Blue Jays three runs. The Yankees went on to win the game, 10–5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Picker|first=David|title=Rodriguez's Shouts Are History to Toronto|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/07/17/sports/baseball/17jays.html|accessdate=May 30, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!----See [[WP:RECENTISM]] before you add any information to this incident --&gt;

On July 12, Rodriguez hit his 150th career home run in a Yankees uniform. This made him the first, and so far only, player in major league history to ever hit 150 home runs for three different teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newyork.yankees.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?c_id=mlb&amp;content_id=13058148&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;ymd=20100805 |title=A-Rod's homers blaze trail across baseball &amp;#124; MLB.com: News |publisher=Newyork.yankees.mlb.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also just the third player to hit at least 100 home runs for three teams; [[Reggie Jackson]] and [[Darrell Evans]] are the other two.&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_6_65/ai_n26921268/&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, Rodriguez hit his 500th career home run against pitcher [[Kyle Davies (baseball)|Kyle Davies]] of the [[Kansas City Royals]]. This made Rodriguez the youngest player ever to reach 500 homers (32 years, 8 days). He is only the second Yankee to hit number 500 at home; [[Mickey Mantle]] on May 14, 1967 against [[Stu Miller]] was the other.

On September 23, ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' reported that Rodriguez was involved in a deal for a new contract with the [[Chicago Cubs]] that would include part ownership of the team. His agent, however, reported to [[ESPN]] that this was untrue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3033203 |title=ESPN – Magazine reports Boras had talks with Cubs bidder – MLB |publisher=ESPN  |date=September 24, 2007 |accessdate=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 25, Rodriguez became the fifth player ever in major league history to record a 50-home run, 150-RBI season when he hit a grand slam. Derek Jeter was one of the first of his teammates to congratulate him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://channels.isp.netscape.com/sports/story.jsp?flok=FF-APO-2011&amp;idq=/ff/story/0001%2F20070805%2F1015972261.htm&amp;sc=2011&amp;floc=NI-sp2 |title=A-Rod Hits 500th HR As Yanks Beat Royals – Netscape Sports |publisher=Channels.isp.netscape.com |accessdate=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:A-Rod3.jpg|thumb|right|Rodriguez batting in 2007]]
In 2007, Rodriguez became the first player in major league history to have at least 35 home runs, 100 runs, and 100 RBIs in 10 consecutive seasons, surpassing Jimmie Foxx (9 consecutive seasons). He led the AL in home runs (54), RBIs (156), slugging percentage (.645), [[On-base plus slugging|OPS]] (1.067), total bases (376), and times on base (299), and was 2nd in hit by pitch (21), extra base hits (85), and at bats per home run (10.8), 4th in on base percentage (.422) and sacrifice flies (9), 7th in walks (95) and plate appearances (708), 8th in intentional walks (11), and 9th in games (158). He led MLB in home runs and won his third Babe Ruth Home Run Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Giese Error Leads To Four-Run Seventh As Reds Blank Yanks |date=June 21, 2008 |work=[[WPXI.com]] |agency=[[The Sports Network (wire service)|The Sports Network]] |url=http://www.wpxi.com/mlb/16674416/detail.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/633TwpAcN |archivedate=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, Rodriguez won the Players Choice Award for Outstanding AL Player. On October 27, he won the Players Choice Award for Player of the Year. He also won the 2007 silver slugger award for his position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/awards/pa |title=MLB – awards – Yahoo! Sports |publisher=Sports.yahoo.com |accessdate=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 19, 2007, Rodriguez was named the AL MVP for the third time in his career, receiving 26 first-place votes out of a possible 28.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3119020 |title=ESPN – A-Rod wins third MVP but denied unanimous selection – MLB |publisher=ESPN  |date=November 20, 2007 |accessdate=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opt-out controversy====
The 2007 season marked the last year of Rodriguez's 10-year, $252&amp;nbsp;million contract before he opted out, effectively making him a free agent again. Rodriguez had repeatedly stated during the [[2007 MLB Season|2007 season]] that he would like to remain a Yankee for the rest of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2848306 |title=ESPN – A-Rod doesn't want to leave NY next season – MLB |publisher=ESPN  |date=April 25, 2007 |accessdate=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 28, 2007, Rodriguez's agent, [[Scott Boras]], announced that he would not renew his contract with the Yankees citing that he &quot;was unsure of the future composition&quot; of the team. He received a slew of criticism from fans and writers alike not only for opting out, but also for not meeting with Yankee management before he did. He was further criticized for the timing of his announcement, during the eighth inning of Game Four of the [[2007 World Series|World Series]], as the [[Boston Red Sox]] were wrapping up their victory over the [[Colorado Rockies]]. After realizing that the situation was not handled very well, Rodriguez contacted the New York Yankees ownership directly, bypassing Boras. Subsequently, Rodriguez issued a statement on his website, saying that he wished to stay with the Yankees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arod.mlb.com/players/Rodriguez_alex/article.jsp?story=111407 AROD.com – News]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, 2007, the New York Yankees and Rodriguez agreed on the &quot;basic framework&quot; of a 10-year, $275&amp;nbsp;million contract that would have him playing until he is 42.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.observer.com/2009/rod-superscar?page=1 A-Rod, Superscar] Retrieved on March 11, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The contract, finalized December 13, includes various multimillion dollar incentives for breaking career home run milestones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/al/yankees/2007-11-25-arod-incentives_N.htm|title=Home runs could net A-Rod up to $30M in incentives|date=November 26, 2007|first=Ronald|last=Blum|accessdate=April 28, 2010 | work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2008&amp;ndash;2009====
[[File:Alex Rodriguez batting stance 2008.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Rodriguez at bat in 2008]]
On September 3, in a game against the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], Rodriguez hit his 549th home run. The opposing manager objected that the ball was foul, and for the first time in MLB history, [[Instant replay#Baseball|instant replay]] (a process officially introduced a few days earlier) was used to review the play and uphold the umpires' ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By&amp;nbsp;Bill Chastain&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;MLB.com |url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080903&amp;content_id=3412816&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb |title=MLB official site: Instant replay used for first time |publisher=Mlb.mlb.com |accessdate=August 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was one of only 4 batters in the AL to have at least 18 home runs and 18 stolen bases in both 2007 and 2008, along with [[Torii Hunter]], [[Ian Kinsler]], and [[Grady Sizemore]]. Rodriguez hit a home run every 14.6 at-bats in 2008, the second best ratio on the team behind [[Jason Giambi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;100random&quot;&gt;Chuck, Bill.

Retrieved May 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodriguez was to represent the Dominican Republic prior to the 2009 season in the [[2009 World Baseball Classic]], but was forced to withdraw when an MRI revealed a [[cyst]] in his right hip. When he went to have the cyst drained, it was discovered that he was also suffering from a [[acetabular labrum|torn labrum]] in the same hip. Rodriguez opted to undergo an arthroscopic procedure with a recovery period of six to nine weeks, instead of the usual three to four months.&lt;ref name=&quot;surgery&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3961898|title=New York Yankees' Alex Rodriguez opts for surgery|date=March 9, 2009|publisher=ESPN |accessdate=June 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the procedure should allow him to make it through the season without any complications, he will require a second, more extensive surgery in the off-season.&lt;ref name=&quot;surgery&quot;/&gt;

After missing [[spring training]] and the first month of the season, Rodriguez returned to the Yankees on May 8 against the [[Baltimore Orioles]] and promptly belted a three-run home run on the first pitch of his first at bat. The club had stumbled to a 13–15 record in Rodriguez's absence, but his return fortified the lineup and provided much needed protection for three-hole hitter [[Mark Teixeira]], who had always been a slow starter. Rodriguez also supplied some late-game heroics. On May 16, his two-run [[walk-off home run]] in the bottom of the eleventh inning gave the Yankees a 6–4 win over the [[Minnesota Twins]]. One week later, he hit a game-tying solo home run in the bottom of the ninth off [[Philadelphia Phillies]] closer [[Brad Lidge]] in a game the Yankees would go on to win, 5–4.

By early June, the Yankees surged to first place in the [[AL East]].

On October 4, 2009, during the final game of the season, Rodriguez hit two home runs in the sixth inning that drove in seven runs, setting an American League record for most RBIs by a batter in a single inning, and giving him his 12th consecutive season, 13 overall,of reaching 30 home runs and 100 RBIs, breaking a tie with [[Manny Ramirez]], [[Babe Ruth]] and [[Jimmie Foxx]] for the most in MLB history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=291004130 sports.espn.go], A-Rod hits 2 HRs, drives in AL-record 7 in 6th as Yanks win&lt;/ref&gt;

Game 3 saw him hit a game-tying home run.

In Game 3 of the [[2009 World Series|World Series]], Rodriguez hit what appeared to be a double off a camera perched atop the outfield wall, but after protest by Yankee manager [[Joe Girardi]], was reviewed and ruled a home run. Rodriguez's postseason success continued in Game 4 of the World Series, as he drove in the go-ahead run with two outs in the 9th inning off of closer [[Brad Lidge]]. The Yankees would go on to win the game 7–4 to take a 3 games to 1 lead in the series. Despite a 2–4 performance with 3 RBIs in Game 5, the Yankees lost 8–6 to force the Series to return to the Bronx for Game 6. Rodriguez was 1–2 with 2 walks and two runs scored in Game 6, as the Yankees went on to beat the Phillies 7–3 for their 27th World Series Championship, the first of Rodriguez's career. He was awarded the [[Babe Ruth Award]] as the postseason MVP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=[[Associated Press]] |title=Rodriguez chokes up during speech|date=January 24, 2010 |publisher=[[ESPN]]|work=[[ESPN.com]] |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4853444|accessdate=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010–present====
On August 4, 2010, on the 3-year anniversary of his 500th home run, Rodriguez became the seventh player in major league history to hit 600 home runs, hitting number 600 off of [[Shaun Marcum]] of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]], becoming the youngest player to do so at 35 years and 8 days old. On August 14, A-Rod hit three home runs in a game against the [[Kansas City Royals]]. In the top of the 6th, he hit his first, a solo dinger to left center. In the top of the 7th, he hit his second, a two-run shot to dead center. In the top of the 9th, he hit his third, a towering two-run blast into the waterfall in [[Kauffman Stadium]].

On Sept 29th, he hit his 30th home run of the season, recording his major league record 13th straight year of at least 30 home runs and 100 RBIs, breaking a tie with [[Jimmie Foxx]], who had 12 seasons.

In 2011, Rodriguez batted .295 with 13 HRs and 52 RBI prior to the All-Star break. Despite good production, Rodriguez suffered his longest single season home run drought of his career by not hitting one in 85 at bats. Although elected to start the game, Rodriguez opted for arthroscopic surgery on his knee to repair a torn meniscus that impacted his power, and was placed on the disabled list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/news/story?id=6754883 |title=sports.espn.go.com |publisher=sports.espn.go.com |date=2011-07-11 |accessdate=2011-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On top of recovery, Rodriguez is facing serious allegations that he participated in illegal, underground poker games. One of those games reportedly turned violent and cocaine was openly used. However, Rodriguez denied through a representative that he ever participated in illegal poker games. An MLB Executive has said that if Rodriguez is indeed proven guilty, he could face a suspension, MLB had warned Rodriguez in 2005 not to participate in such games. &quot;You get the feeling that Alex says what he thinks he needs to say to get by, and then goes out and does what he wants,&quot; the MLB executive said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/new-york/mlb/story/_/id/6830659/mlb-suspend-alex-rodriguez-illegal-poker |title=sports.espn.go.com |publisher=Espn.go.com |date=2011-08-04 |accessdate=2011-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rodriguez returned to the Yankees on August 21, playing third base against the [[Minnesota Twins]], going 0-for-4. He sustained another injury with a jammed thumb while trying to make a play in that game. He returned to the Yankees on August 25, going 2-for-4 with 2 singles in a win for the Yankees over the [[Oakland Athletics]]. On August 26, A-Rod hit his first home run since coming off the disabled list, a solo shot off [[Baltimore Orioles]] pitcher [[Tommy Hunter (baseball)|Tommy Hunter]]. He concluded the season with 16&amp;nbsp;home runs and 62&amp;nbsp;RBIs in 99&amp;nbsp;games, ending his major league-record streak of 13&amp;nbsp;straight seasons of 30&amp;nbsp;homers and 100&amp;nbsp;RBIs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Evan Longoria homers in 12th as Rays storm into postseason |date=September 28, 2011 |agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=ESPN.com |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=310928130 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/623MgtrrK |archivedate=September 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with ESPN after the report came out, citing &quot;an enormous amount of pressure to perform,&quot; Rodriguez admitted to using banned substances from 2001 to 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPNadmission&quot;/&gt; &quot;All my years in New York have been clean,” he added, saying he has not used banned substances since last taking them following a spring training injury in 2003 while playing for the Rangers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPNadmission&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTadmission&quot;/&gt;  &quot;Back then, [baseball] was a different culture,&quot; Rodriguez said. &quot;It was very loose.

Rodriguez absolved the players' union of any blame for leaking his positive test results, saying he alone was responsible for his mistakes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPNadmission&quot;/&gt;  Friend and former teammate [[Doug Glanville]], while noting the outrage over Rodriguez's years of steroid use, berated Rodriguez's critics for their &quot;lack of outrage about how a confidential and anonymous test could be made public.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Glanville&quot;/&gt;  No Major League player, Glanville wrote, would have participated in the 2003 survey if he had thought the results had even a chance of becoming public. &quot;It has everything to do with privacy. Being A-Rod should not change that fact.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Glanville&quot;/&gt;

MLB Commissioner Bud Selig briefly considered whether or not to punish Rodriguez for his admitted steroid use, citing the illegality of the situation, among other things. However, at the time of the testing there were no punishments for this sort of activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3900961|title=Selig considering options on A-Rod|date=February 12, 2009|accessdate=March 12, 2009|publisher=ESPN| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090215120859/http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=3900961| archivedate= February 15 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, his admission to three years of steroid use could be damaging to his image and legacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTadmission&quot;/&gt;
