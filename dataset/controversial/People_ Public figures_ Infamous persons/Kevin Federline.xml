'''Kevin Earl Federline''' (born March 21, 1978) is an [[United States|American]] [[Dancing|dancer]], [[rapper]], [[fashion]] [[Model (person)|model]],&lt;ref name=&quot;model&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14928334/|title=Kevin Federline's Latest Gig: Fashion Model|publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[actor]]. Previously engaged to actress [[Shar Jackson]], Federline is well known for his two-year marriage to [[Britney Spears]].&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot;&gt;Phares, Heather. [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p759850|pure_url=yes}} Kevin Federline biography]. [[Allmusic]]: 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The couple's divorce was highly publicized and was followed by an ongoing legal battle for the custody of their two sons, Sean Preston Federline and Jayden James Federline.

==Early life==
Federline was born to parents Mike, a car mechanic, and Julie, a former bank teller from [[Oregon]]; the name Federline is of [[German-American|German origin]]. Federline has one brother, Chris. His parents divorced when he was eight years old. When Federline was eleven, he and Chris moved back to his father's Fresno house. Federline dropped out of high school in the ninth grade and soon started dancing with a nonprofit organization called Dance Empowerment. Federline later earned a certificate of [[General Educational Development]].&lt;ref name=&quot;people&quot;&gt;Dinh, Mai; Murphy, Janet, ed. [http://www.people.com/people/kevin_federline/biography Kevin Federline biography (1986-2006)]. [[People (magazine)|People.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Federline was a backup dancer for a number of years for [[Michael Jackson]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Pink (singer)|Pink]], and [[LFO (group)|LFO]].&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;people&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fire&quot;&gt;Erlewine, Stephen Thomas. [{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r868665|pure_url=yes}} &quot;Playing with Fire&quot;]. [[Allmusic]]: 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Federline initially released two singles, &quot;Y'all Ain't Ready&quot; and &quot;[[PopoZão]],&quot; shortly after his marriage to Spears. Following poor critical reaction, neither song was included on his debut album.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot;/&gt; Instead, the first official single was &quot;Lose Control,&quot; which he premiered on the [[Teen Choice Awards]] show on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network in late summer 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot;/&gt; He released his debut album, ''[[Playing with Fire (Kevin Federline album)|Playing with Fire]]'', on October 31, 2006, which became one of the worst-received albums in recent music history, receiving the lowest score in an overwhelming majority of reviews&lt;ref&gt;metacritic.com, [http://www.metacritic.com/music/artists/federlinekevin/playingwithfire?q=Kevin%20Federline Playing with Fire entry], accessed February 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; as well as lackluster sales.&lt;ref&gt;abcnews.com, [http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=2705059&amp;CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312 Kevin Federline Says He's Doing 'Great'], accessed February 12, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Federline has been signed to model for the Five Star Vintage line by the [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]-based Blue Marlin clothing company. The initial series of ads ran in August 2006 and was subsequently extended for Christmas 2006. The line he modeled for the fall 2006 was the top-selling line in [[Macy's]], Kitson in Los Angeles, and [[Lord &amp; Taylor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eurweb.com/story/eur29529.cfm http://www.eurweb.com/story/eur29529.cfm] ''Eurweb.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film and television===
Federline co-starred with Spears on the 2005 [[reality television]] show ''[[Britney &amp; Kevin: Chaotic]]'', which consisted of home videos shot by the couple. He also appeared in the 2004 movie ''[[You Got Served]]''. Federline subsequently guest-starred as a street hoodlum in [[Fannysmackin' (CSI episode)|an episode]] of ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation|CSI]]'' that aired on October 12, 2006, in the USA and Canada. He also guest-starred on the [[NBC]] show ''[[1 vs. 100 (U.S. game show)|1 vs. 100]]'', along with the cast of ''[[Las Vegas (TV series)|Las Vegas]]'', in the episode &quot;Delinda's Box&quot;.

Federline was featured in a [[Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company]] commercial during [[Super Bowl XLI]] on February 4, 2007, as part of its &quot;Life Comes at You Fast&quot; ad series. In the commercial, Federline initially appeared in a music video, rapping about living a high-flying lifestyle. Then reality sets in as Federline is shown now working in a fast-food restaurant with his manager yelling at him, the punchline of the ad being &quot;Life comes at you fast.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QRbNCjDsVs4 Nationwide Commercial - RollinVIP] ''Youtube.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

Federline guest-starred during several episodes and was subsequently added as a regular on the television series ''[[One Tree Hill (TV series)|One Tree Hill]]'' on [[The CW]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/federline%20to%20become%20one%20tree%20hill%20regular_1043949 BRITNEY SPEARS - FEDERLINE TO BECOME ONE TREE HILL REGULAR]&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did not appear on the show again after his guest slot.

Federline appeared on the seventh season of the weight-loss [[reality television]] show ''[[Celebrity Fit Club (U.S. TV series)|Celebrity Fit Club]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://snarkfood.com/fat-kevin-federline-signs-on-to-celebrity-fit-club/34738/ Kevin Federline Signs On to Celebrity Fit Club]&lt;/ref&gt;

Federline plays a border guard in the 2009 film ''[[American Pie Presents: The Book of Love]]''.

===Professional wrestling===
Federline appeared on [[World Wrestling Entertainment|WWE]] programming to promote his album, ''Playing with Fire'', and participate in an [[angle (professional wrestling)|angle]]. He first appeared on the October 16, 2006, and October 23, 2006, editions of ''[[WWE Raw]]'', in which he got into physical altercations with [[WWE Championship|WWE Champion]] [[John Cena]]. The following week, he came to the ring to aid [[John Morrison (wrestler)|Johnny Nitro]] in his match against John Cena. After Cena got in Federline's face, Federline slapped him hard. He appeared again during the November 5, 2006, [[pay-per-view]] event ''[[Cyber Sunday (2006)|Cyber Sunday]]'', hitting Cena with King Booker's [[World Heavyweight Championship (WWE)|World Heavyweight Championship]] belt and helping Booker win the Champion of Champions match that was organized between Cena, Booker, and Big Show. The next night, November 6, 2006, he challenged Cena to a match at the [[January 1|New Year's Day edition of ''Raw'']], which Cena accepted. He went on to win this no-disqualification match thanks to interference from Johnny Nitro and [[Eddie Fatu|Umaga]]. Later in the night, after John Cena's main event match, Cena went after Federline and brought him into the ring and delivered his [[Fireman's carry takeover|FU]] finishing move twice before cameras stopped rolling.

According to the ''[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]'', Federline was well received backstage. Sources say he worked so well with the company and personnel that the WWE may give him a regular role on the company's show ''Raw'' in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wrestlingexposed.com/headlines/19197.shtml http://wrestlingexposed.com/headlines/19197.shtml] ''Wrestlingexposed.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources and wrestlers have spoken about Federline's generally good attitude backstage as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hobotrashcan.com/interviews/mickfoley4.php | title = One on One with Mick Foley | accessdate=2007-05-23 |month=March | year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
===Family===
Federline was in a relationship with actress [[Shar Jackson]]. The couple have a daughter, Kori Madison Federline (born July&amp;nbsp;31, 2002), and a son, Kaleb Michael Jackson Federline (born July 20, 2004).&lt;ref name=&quot;people&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;details interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stereogum.com/archives/details-the-kevin-federline-interview_001250.html|title=Details Magazine interview with Kevin Federline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federline and Jackson separated shortly before the birth of their second child; during this time, Federline began dating pop singer [[Britney Spears]]. Jackson later commented that Federline's relationship with Spears &quot;wasn't like just breaking up a relationship. It was like breaking up a family.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;people&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,632184,00.html Britney Frolics with Dancer-Family Man] ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'': April 28, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this statement, Jackson has sustained an amicable relationship with Federline. On January 12, 2007, Jackson stated, &quot;He's a great dad, and if you said his name right now, Kori would go crazy. That's the love of her life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20008411,00.html Shar Jackson Defends Kevin's Parenting Skills] ''People.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2004, Federline and Spears announced their [[engagement]] after three months of dating. The couple was married on September 18, 2004, in a [[nondenominational]] ceremony at a residence in [[Studio City, California]], filing legal papers on October 6.&lt;ref name=married&gt;{{cite web | author=CBS/AP editors | title=Pop Star Marries Dancer Kevin Federline In Quiet Private Ceremony | publisher=CBSNews.com | date=September 20, 2004 | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/09/23/entertainment/main645138.shtml | accessdate=2007-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=&quot;The Smoking Gun&quot; editors | title=Britney Spears's &quot;Faux&quot; Wedding | publisher=thesmokinggun.com | date=November 8, 2006 | url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/britney-spears/britney-spearss-faux-wedding | accessdate=June 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had their first son, Sean Preston Federline, on September 14, 2005.&lt;ref name=sean&gt;{{cite web | author=''People'' Magazine | title=Britney Welcomes Home Sean Preston | publisher=people.com | date=September 21, 2005 | url=http://people.aol.com/people/articles/0,19736,1039012_1107631,00.html | accessdate=2007-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just two days before Sean's first birthday, the couple had a second son, Jayden James Federline, who was born on September 12, 2006 in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]].&lt;ref name=jayden&gt;{{cite web |  author=''People'' Magazine editors | url=http://people.aol.com/people/article/0,26334,1550177,00.html | title=Britney's Baby Name: Jayden James Federline| work=People Magazine | year=2006 | accessdate=2006-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spears filed for divorce from Federline on November 7, citing [[irreconcilable differences]] and asking for both physical and legal custody of their two children, with visitation rights for Federline.&lt;ref name=divorce&gt;{{cite web|author= TMZ Staff|url=http://www.tmz.com/2006/11/07/britney-spears-files-for-divorce/|title=Britney Spears Files for Divorce|work=TMZ|date=November 7, 2006|accessdate=2007-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, Federline filed a response to Spears's divorce petition, seeking physical and legal custody of their children.&lt;ref name=custody&gt;{{cite web|author=''People Magazine'' editors|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,1556996,00.html|title=Kevin Federline Seeks Custody of Kids|work=People|date=November 8, 2006|accessdate=2007-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a representative for Federline's lawyer, the divorce filing &quot;caught Kevin totally by surprise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ken Lee and Carrie Borzillo-Vrenna|url=http://people.aol.com/people/article/0,26334,1557574,00.html|title=Britney Spears Heading to Miami|work=People|date=November 10, 2006|accessdate=2007-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple reached a global settlement agreement in March 2007 and their divorce was finalized on July 30.&lt;ref name=agreement&gt;{{cite news|author=Associated Press|title=Britney Spears, K-Fed Settle Divorce|date=March 30, 2007|publisher=TIME.com|url=http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1605398,00.html|accessdate=2007-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=7d62035a-bdfa-4b47-aca8-937826e95306|title=Britney, Kevin Back to Being Single|accessdate=2007-08-22|author=Sarah Hall|date=2007-07-30|publisher=E!

On October 1, 2007, a court ruling granted Federline sole physical custody of his children, with legal custody to be decided. On the late evening of January 3, 2008, police were called to Spears's home after the singer reportedly refused to relinquish custody of her children to Federline and locked herself in a room with her younger son, Jayden.&lt;ref name=&quot;hospital&quot;&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20169330,00.html Britney Spears Hospitalized for 'An Evaluation']; ''People''; January 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Spears was taken from her home on a stretcher and hospitalized at [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] for appearing to be under the influence of an unknown substance.&lt;ref name=&quot;hospital&quot; /&gt; As a result of this, Federline was &quot;awarded sole legal custody and sole physical custody of the minor children.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;custody&quot; /&gt;

On July 26, 2008, court papers were filed stating Federline would retain sole legal and physical custody of the children while Spears would get visitation rights that would increase over time. In addition to this, Federline will receive $20,000 per month from Spears in [[child support]] as well as additional funds to cover any custody-related legal expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tmz.com/2008/07/25/britney-settlement-papers-blow-by-blow/ | title=Britney Settlement Papers: Blow by Blow | author=TMZ staff | publisher=TMZ | date=26 July 2008 | accessdate=2008-07-26|publisher=twz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008 he was linked to former [[volleyball]] player Victoria Prince. The two were on the same recreational bowling team, the Party Animals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmz.com/2008/12/17/brits-replacement-twice-the-size-half-the-crazy/ Brit's Replacement: Twice the Size, Half the Crazy] TMZ.com, December 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The couple welcomed a daughter named Jordan Kay on August 15, 2011.

===Health===
In November 2011, on a weight loss show in Australia called ''[[Excess Baggage (Australian TV series)|Excess Baggage]]'', Federline was hospitalized for what was called &quot;heat stress&quot;. Filming was taking place in November which is the hottest time of the year in the [[Kimberley (Western Australia)|Kimberley]] region of northern [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laudadio and Raftery|first=Marisa and Liz|title=Kevin Federline Hospitalized While Filming Weight-Loss Show in Australia|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20552367,00.html|publisher=People Magazine|accessdate=2011-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
