'''Janeane Garofalo''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|dʒ|ə|ˈ|n|iː|n|_|ɡ|ə|ˈ|r|ɒ|f|əl|oʊ}}; born September 28, 1964) is an American stand-up [[comedian]], actress, liberal [[political activism|political activist]] and writer. She is the former co-host on the now defunct [[Air America Radio]]'s ''[[The Majority Report]]''. Garofalo continues to participate regularly in New York City's local comedy and [[performance art]] scene.

==Early life==
Garofalo was born in [[Newton, New Jersey]], the daughter of Joan and Carmine Garofalo. Her mother was a secretary, in the [[petrochemical]] industry, who died of [[cancer]] when Janeane was 24. Her father is a former executive at [[Exxon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;houstonchronicle&quot;&gt;{{cite news

She grew up in various places, including [[Ontario, California]], [[Madison, New Jersey]] and [[Katy, Texas]]. Garofalo is quoted as having disliked life in Houston because of the heat and humidity and the emphasis on prettiness and sports in high school.&lt;ref name=&quot;houstonchronicle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Westbrook_HoustonChronicle_20070624/&gt;

While studying history at [[Providence College]], Garofalo entered a comedy talent search sponsored by the [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] cable network, winning the title of &quot;Funniest Person in [[Rhode Island]].&quot; Her original gimmick was to read off her hand, which was not successful in subsequent performances. Dreaming of earning a slot on the writing staff of the TV show ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', she became a professional standup upon graduating from college with degrees in History and American Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800018572/bio |title=Janeane Garofalo Biography&amp;nbsp;– Yahoo! Movies |publisher=Movies.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She struggled for a number of years, working briefly as a [[bike messengers|bike messenger]] in [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bostonphoenix.com/boston/news_features/this_just_in/documents/02169474.htm |title=Funny Girl: The real Garofalo |publisher=The Boston Phoenix |author=NINA WILLDORF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garofalo has described herself thus: &quot;I guess I just prefer to see the dark side of things. The glass is always half empty. And cracked. And I just cut my lip on it. And chipped a tooth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/quotes/j/janeanegar163727.html |title=Janeane Garofalo Quotes |publisher=Brainy Quote |date=1964-09-28 |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entertainment career==

===Stand-up comedy===
{{refimprove|subsection|date=July 2012}}
Garofalo began her career in [[stand-up comedy]] in the late 1980s during the pre-[[grunge rock|grunge]] era.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Her appearance was often in line with late 1980s style: disheveled with thick black glasses and unkempt hair.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Her comedy is often [[self-deprecating]];{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} she has made fun of [[popular culture]] and the pressures on women to conform to [[body image]] ideals promoted by the [[Mass media|media]].{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Garofalo's comedy shows involve her and her notebook, which is filled with years' worth of article clippings and random observations she references for direct quotes during her act.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Garofalo has said that she does not tell jokes as much as make observations designed to get laughs.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} She was part of the [[alternative comedy]] scene in Los Angeles in the early 1990s, appearing at [[Un-Cabaret]] and other venues and co-created the Eating It comedy series which ran at Luna Lounge on the Lower East Side of New York City between 1995 and 2005.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} She did a one-hour stand-up special, &quot;If You Will,&quot; at Seattle's Moore Theatre, that aired on ''[[Epix (TV channel)|Epix]]'' in June 2010 and was released on DVD in September 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/44624/if-you-will/ |work=DVD Talk |title=If You Will |author=Jamie S. Rich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her filmed stand-up show in Seattle, she proclaimed herself as [[asexuality|asexual]], and brought up her ten-year [[celibacy|celibate]] relationship with her boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=J.M.|last=Suarez|title='Janeane Garofalo: If You Will': 'Life Is Too Long to Worry About the Afterlife'|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|date=October 4, 2010|accessdate=November 1, 2012|url=http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/131684-janeane-garofalo-if-you-will}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television===
Garofalo's big break came in 1990 after meeting [[Ben Stiller]] at [[Canter's Deli]] in Los Angeles, where they were hanging out with stand-up friends. They bonded over their &quot;love of SCTV, early Saturday Night Live and Albert Brooks.&quot;&lt;ref name='http://www.papermag.com/arts_and_style/1999/08/the-ben-stiller-show-n-tell.php'&gt; {{cite news | first = Christine | last = Muhlke | title = The Ben Stiller Show 'N' Tell | date = 1999-08 | work = PaperMag | accessdate = 2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her television series debut was on the short-lived ''[[The Ben Stiller Show|Ben Stiller Show]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in 1992, on which she was a cast member alongside longtime friends  [[Bob Odenkirk]] and [[Andy Dick]]. A chance meeting on the set of that show led her to be offered the role of [[List of characters on The Larry Sanders Show#Paula|Paula]] on ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'' on [[HBO]], earning her two ''[[Emmy Award]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/janeane-garofalo Janeane Garofalo Emmy Nominated]&lt;/ref&gt; nominations in 1996 and 1997.

After ''The Ben Stiller Show'' was cancelled, Garofalo joined the cast of ''[[Saturday Night Live]] (SNL)'' for its [[Saturday Night Live (Season 20)|1994–95 season]]. She left ''SNL'' in March 1995 (mid-season) after only six months, saying that the experience left her &quot;anxious and depressed&quot; and that a [[sexist]] attitude pervaded the show and she called many of the sketches &quot;juvenile and homophobic&quot;. According to ''[[New York Magazine]]'', Garofalo was &quot;largely  stuck in dull, secondary wife and girlfriend roles&quot; and her friends said that she considered the stint &quot;the most miserable experience of [her] life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Magazine 1995-03-13&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Chris | last=Smith | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Comedy Isn't Funny: How Saturday Night Live Became a Grim Joke | date=1995-03-13 | publisher= | url =http://nymag.com/arts/tv/features/47548/index1.html | work =New York Magazine | pages = | accessdate = 2009-08-19 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following ''SNL'', Garofalo appeared in a plethora of guest star roles: the grown-up daughter of the Buchmans on the final episode of ''[[Mad About You]]''; [[Jerry Seinfeld (character)|Jerry Seinfeld]]'s female counterpart (and, briefly, fiancée) Jeannie Steinman on ''[[Seinfeld]]''; a correspondent on [[Michael Moore]]'s ''[[TV Nation]]'' and a former girlfriend of [[Dave Foley]]'s character on ''[[Newsradio]]''. Two television pilots starring Garofalo, the 2003 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] show ''Slice O'Life'' about a reporter consigned to sappy human interest stories appearing at the end of news broadcasts, and the 2005 [[NBC]] program ''All In'', based on the life of poker star [[Annie Duke]], were not picked up by their respective networks.

Throughout the 2005–2006 television season, Garofalo appeared on ''[[The West Wing (TV series)|The West Wing]]'' as [[Louise Thornton]], a controversial campaign adviser to the fictional [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] presidential nominee. Garofalo participated in the series' first live episode, most of which was a debate televised live on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] and then reshot live for the [[West Coast of the United States|West]]. Garofalo's character can be seen walking backstage advising before the start of each debate. In 2006, she provided the voice for the animated character &quot;Bearded Clam&quot; on Comedy Central's ''[[Freak Show (TV series)|Freak Show]]''. In 2007, she wrote a dedication for the mini-book included in the six-DVD box-set of the 1994 [[cult following|cult]] series ''[[My So-Called Life]]''.

In 2009, Garofalo joined the cast of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]'', where she starred as [[Janis Gold]].

Garofalo was a cast member of the ''[[Criminal Minds]]'' short-lived spinoff TV series ''[[Criminal Minds: Suspect Behavior]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Episode of [[Sam Seder]]'s political podcast ''[[The Majority Report]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Garofalo joined the cast of ''[[Ideal (TV series)|Ideal]]'' as Tilly.

===Films===
Garofalo's breakthrough into film came in 1994's ''[[Reality Bites]]'' as [[Winona Ryder]]'s [[Gap (clothing retailer)|Gap]]-managing best friend Vickie. The role helped solidify Garofalo's status as a [[Generation X]] icon. In 1996, Garofalo earned a starring role in the critically acclaimed ''[[The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs]]'', a variation on ''[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano de Bergerac]]'' which featured [[Uma Thurman]] in the lead role as a beautiful but dim-witted model, while Garofalo played Abby, a highly intelligent radio host. Initially an [[independent film]], it became a studio movie when Thurman was signed. The film was a modest hit, but Garofalo disparages it to this day, saying:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Tasha | last=Robinson | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Janeane Garofalo | date=2003-12-24 | publisher=[[The A.V. Club]] | url =http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22585 | work = | pages = | accessdate = 2009-08-19 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I think it's soft and corny, and the soundtrack makes you want to puke, and everybody's dressed in [[Banana Republic (clothing retailer)|Banana Republic]] clothing. The original script and the original intent was very different than what it wound up being when it became a studio commercial film. It was originally supposed to be a small-budget independent film where there would be much more complexity to all the characters, and Abby and the guy don't wind up together at the end.|Janeane Garofalo|Interview with the Onion A. V. Club}}

Based on the success of this film, director [[Cameron Crowe]] then offered her the leading lady role in ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'' with [[Tom Cruise]] if she could lose weight; after trimming down, however, she learned that [[Renée Zellweger]] had won the part instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Alison Prato | last= | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Q &amp; A With Janeane Garofalo | date=2009-01 | publisher= | url =http://www.inkedmag.com/article/q-janeane-garofalo/ | work =Inked Magazine | pages = | accessdate = 2010-02-12 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Garofalo turned down the role of Gale Weathers in [[Wes Craven]]'s ''[[Scream (film)|Scream]]'' because she thought the film would be too violent: &quot;I said I didn't want to be in a movie where a teen girl was disemboweled. I didn't know it turned out so good, and it was a funny movie.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 'Matchmaker' helps Garofalo fall for Ireland | date = 1997-09-30 | work = Boston Herald | accessdate = 2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garofalo had also been [[David Fincher]]'s first choice for the role of Marla Singer in the film ''[[Fight Club]]'', but she turned it down, uncomfortable with the film's sexual content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Story Behind Fight Club | author= | work=Total Film | url=http://www.totalfilm.com/features/the-story-behind-fight-club | quote=The studio wanted Winona Ryder. Fincher wanted Janeane Garofalo, but she was &quot;uncomfortable with the idea of all this sex”. | date=2009-11-20 | accessdate=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before ''The Truth About Cats &amp; Dogs'', she was visible from television work and supporting roles in films such as ''Reality Bites'', ''[[Bye Bye Love (film)|Bye Bye Love]]'' and ''[[Now and Then (film)|Now and Then]]'', and a leading role in ''[[I Shot a Man in Vegas]]''. Garofalo has had a variety of leading, supporting and [[cameo role]]s in ''[[Cop Land]]'', ''[[Wet Hot American Summer]]'', ''[[Romy and Michele's High School Reunion]]'', ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]'', ''[[The Cable Guy]]'', ''[[Half-Baked]]'', ''[[Mystery Men]]'', ''[[The Wild]]'', and ''[[Clay Pigeons]]''.

Garofalo played the leading role in the ''[[The MatchMaker]]'', a 1997 film about the misadventures of a cynical American woman who reluctantly visits Ireland. In 1998 Garofalo starred in her first voice-acting job playing Ursula the Artist in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s English dub of [[Studio Ghibli]]'s [[Kiki's Delivery Service]]. In 2002, she played Catherine Connolly in ''[[The Laramie Project (film)|The Laramie Project]]''. A puppet version of Garofalo appeared (and was graphically killed off) in the movie ''[[Team America: World Police]]''; while Garofalo was irritated by the parody, she was more upset by the filmmaker's lack of correspondence. &quot;I ran into them in the street, Trey and the other guy, and I said to them, 'The least you could do is send me a puppet.' And they said OK, took my address down ... and never sent me a puppet! So while Team America bothered me, the fact they didn't send me my puppet, that bothered me even more.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = James | last = Kettle | title = Seriously funny | date = 2009-08-01 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/stage/2009/aug/01/janeane-garofalo-edinburgh-fringe | work = The Guardian | accessdate = 2010-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garofalo had a segment in several episodes of the 2007 season of ''[[The Henry Rollins Show]]''. These took place in her apartment, much in the same way [[Henry Rollins|Rollins']] take place at his house. In 2007, she provided the voice of Colette, a chef in the [[Pixar]]/[[Disney]] feature film ''[[Ratatouille (film)|Ratatouille]]''. Garofalo affected a pronounced [[French accent]] in the role, highlighted by her character's [[soliloquy]] about being the only female chef in the all-male kitchen.

She made cameo appearances in ''[[The Guitar (film)|The Guitar]]'' in 2008 and ''[[Labor Pains]]'' in 2009.

==Political views==

Garofalo has been open and outspoken regarding her [[Liberalism|liberal]] political views. In an interview for ''[[Geek Monthly]]'' magazine, she stated that she grew up [[conservative]] in a conservative family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geekmonthly.com/blog/?p=191 |title=Janeane Garofalo |publisher=Geekmonthly.com |date=2009-01-13 |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has appeared with political figures such as [[Ralph Nader]] (whom she supported in [[United States presidential election, 2000|the 2000 election]], but opposed in [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}) and [[Jello Biafra]] at various events. Garofalo now describes herself as an [[atheism|atheist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Janusonis |url=http://www.projo.com/movies/content/ratstars_07-06-07_A964DOQ.25e3ad5.html |title=Just the right spice |publisher=projo.com |date=2007-07-06 |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has participated in a radio interview by Freethought Radio, a show by the [[Freedom From Religion Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ffrf.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=219697 |title=Freethought Radio |publisher=Ffrf.libsyn.com |date=26 May 2007 |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She became more prominent as an activist when she voiced opposition to what became the [[2003 Iraq War]], appearing on [[CNN]] and [[Fox News]] to discuss it. She said that she was approached by groups such as ''[[MoveOn|MoveOn.org]]'' and ''[[Win Without War]]'' to go on TV, because these organizations say that the networks were not allowing [[antiwar]] voices to be heard. Garofalo and the other celebrities who appeared at the time said they thought their fame could lend attention to that side of the debate. Her appearances on cable news prior to the war garnered her praise from the left and spots on the cover of ''[[Ms. magazine|Ms.]]'' and ''[[Venus Zine]]''. Garofalo has had frequent on-air political disputes with [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], [[Brian Kilmeade]], and [[Jonah Goldberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/goldberg/goldberg022803.asp |title=Garofalo’s World |author=Jonah Goldberg |publisher=Nationalreview.com |date=2003-02-28 |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 2003 Iraq War, she took a position on the threat posed by [[Saddam Hussein]]. For example, in an interview with [[Tony Snow]] on a February 23, 2003 episode of ''[[Fox News Sunday]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,79351,00.html |title=Transcript: Janeane Garofalo on Fox News Sunday |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=2003-02-24 |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Garofalo said of the Iraqi [[dictator]]:

{{quote|Yes, I think lots of people are eager to obtain [[weapons of mass destruction]]. But there's no evidence that he (Hussein) has weapons of mass destruction. There's been no evidence of him testing [[nuclear weapon]]s. We have people that are in our face with nuclear weapons. We've got Iran and North Korea. We've got a problem with Pakistan. You know, I don't know what to say about that. There's a whole lot of people that are going nuclear. And I think that Saddam Hussein is actually, with the evidence, the least able to use nuclear weapons and the least obvious offender in that area at this moment. | Janeane Garofalo | Fox News interview}}

In March 2003, she took part in the [[Code Pink]] anti-war march in Washington, D.C. That fall, she served as emcee at several stops on the ''Tell Us the Truth'' tour, a political-themed concert series featuring [[Steve Earle]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Tom Morello]], and others. Throughout the year, Garofalo also actively campaigned for [[Howard Dean]].

While on [[Fox News]]' program ''The Pulse'', O'Reilly asked Garofalo what she would do if her predictions that the Iraq war would be a disaster were to turn out wrong. Garofalo stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,83365,00.html |title=Hollywood Celebrities Pull Out the Punches on Iraq&amp;nbsp;– The Pulse |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=2003-04-09 |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I would be so willing to say, 'I'm sorry'. I hope to God that I can be made a buffoon of, that people will say, 'You were wrong. You were a fatalist.' And I will go to the White House on my knees on cut glass and say, 'Hey, you and Thomas Friedman were right ... I shouldn't have doubted you ...' | Janeane Garofalo | Fox News interview}}

In April 2009, Garofalo drew criticism when she denounced the [[Tea Party protests]], calling them racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carpenter |first=Amanda |url=http://washingtontimes.com/weblogs/back-story/2009/apr/17/liberal-actress-says-tea-parties-were-racist/ |title=Liberal actress says tea parties were racist&amp;nbsp;– Hot Button Blog |publisher=Washington Times |date=2009-04-17 |author=Amanda Carpenter |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the controversy Garofalo has continued to criticize Tea Party protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,519923,00.html |title=Garofalo Stands By 'Racist' Remarks&amp;nbsp;– Hannity |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=2009-05-12 |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Air America Radio===
In late March 2004, Garofalo became a co-host for [[Air America Radio]]'s new show ''[[The Majority Report]]'' alongside [[Sam Seder]]. The early days of Air America Radio are chronicled in the [[documentary film|documentary]] ''[[Left of the Dial]]'', which includes a debate between Garofalo and her conservative father Carmine, who was initially a regular guest on ''The Majority Report''.

Garofalo commented on her April 28, 2006 show supporting the [[Scientology]]-linked [[New York Rescue Workers Detoxification Project]], a controversial treatment for workers suffering ailments from [[9/11]] clean-up efforts in New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12583654|title=Garofalo gushes over Scientology-linked project|last=Walls|first=Jeannette|date=2006-05-02|work=[[MSNBC]]|publisher=NBC|accessdate=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
