'''Kobe Bean Bryant''' (born August 23, 1978) is an American professional [[basketball]] player who plays [[shooting guard]] for the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). Bryant enjoyed a successful high school basketball career at [[Lower Merion High School]], where he was recognized as the top high school basketball player in the country. He declared his eligibility for the [[NBA Draft]] upon graduation, and was selected with the 13th overall pick in the [[1996 NBA Draft]] by the [[New Orleans Hornets|Charlotte Hornets]], then traded to the Los Angeles Lakers. As a rookie, Bryant earned himself a reputation as a high-flyer and a fan favorite by winning the 1997 [[Slam Dunk Contest]].

Bryant and [[Shaquille O'Neal]] led the Lakers to three consecutive [[NBA Finals|NBA championships]] from [[2000 NBA Finals|2000]] to [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]]. [[Shaq–Kobe feud|A heated feud]] between the duo and a loss in the [[2004 NBA Finals]] was followed by O'Neal's trade from the Lakers after the [[2003–04 NBA season|2003–04]] season. Following O'Neal's departure Bryant became the cornerstone of the Los Angeles Lakers franchise. He led the NBA in scoring during the [[2005–06 NBA season|2005–06]] and [[2006–07 NBA season|2006–07]] seasons, setting numerous scoring records in the process. In 2006, Bryant scored a career-high 81 points against the [[Toronto Raptors]], the second [[List of National Basketball Association players with 60 or more points in a game|most points scored in a single game]] in NBA history, second only to [[Wilt Chamberlain's 100-point game]] in 1962. He was awarded the regular season's [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]] (MVP) in 2008. After losing in the [[2008 NBA Finals]], Bryant led the Lakers to two consecutive championships in [[2009 NBA Finals|2009]] and [[2010 NBA Finals|2010]], earning the [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals MVP Award]] on both occasions.

{{As of|June 2012}}, Bryant ranks third and fifth on the league's [[List of National Basketball Association career playoff scoring leaders|all-time post-season scoring]] and [[List of National Basketball Association career scoring leaders|all-time regular season scoring lists]], respectively. He is also the all-time leading scorer in Lakers franchise history. Since his second year in the league, Bryant has been selected to start every [[NBA All-Star Game]] that has been held in the last fourteen years. He has won the [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star MVP Award]] four times ([[2002 NBA All-Star Game|2002]], [[2007 NBA All-Star Game|2007]], [[2009 NBA All-Star Game|2009]], and [[2011 NBA All-Star Game|2011]]), tying him for the most All Star MVP Awards in NBA history. He is a 14-time member of the [[All-NBA]] team and an 12-time member of the [[NBA All-Defensive|All-Defensive]] team; he is also the youngest player ever to receive defensive honors. At the [[Basketball at the 2008 Summer Olympics|2008]] and [[Basketball at the 2012 Summer Olympics|2012 Summer Olympics]], he won [[gold medal]]s as a member of the [[United States men's national basketball team|USA national team]]. In 2009, [[Sporting News]] and [[TNT (TV channel)|TNT]] named Bryant the top NBA player of the 2000s (decade).

In 2003, Bryant was [[Kobe Bryant sexual assault case|accused of sexual assault]] after having sex with a hotel employee in [[Colorado]]. In September 2004, prosecutors dropped the case after his accuser refused to testify. A civil suit was later filed and settled out of court.

By the end of the season, he averaged 15.5 minutes a game. During the [[1997 NBA All-Star Game|All-Star weekend]], Bryant was the winner of the 1997 [[Slam Dunk Contest]], becoming the youngest player to be named the slam dunk champion at the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=NBA Staff |url=http://www.nba.com/history/allstar/slamdunk_year_by_year.html#1997 |title=All-Star: Slam Dunk Year-by-Year Results |publisher=[[NBA]]; nba.com/history/allstar |date=N.D. |accessdate=August 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant's performance throughout the year earned him a spot on the [[NBA All-Rookie Team|NBA All Rookie]] second team with fellow bench teammate [[Travis Knight (basketball)|Travis Knight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/awards_allrookieteams.html |title=All-Rookie Teams |publisher=[[NBA]].com |accessdate=January 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His final minutes of the season ended in disaster when he shot 4 [[air ball]]s at crucial times in the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;HighSchool&quot;/&gt; He first missed a jumper to win the game in the 4th quarter and 3 three-pointers in overtime (2 of which would have tied the game in the final minute). With that the [[Utah Jazz]] ended the [[1997 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]] for the Lakers in the second round. [[Shaquille O'Neal]] commented years later that &quot;[Bryant] was the only guy who had the guts at the time to take shots like that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?id=4152884 |title=Kobe Bryant's top ten moments |publisher=ESPN  |date=May 11, 2009 |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-RbLBGZwiR4 |title=Kobe vs Michael Documentary(Part 2) |publisher=YouTube |date=February 1, 1998 |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Bryant's [[1997–98 NBA season|second season]], he received more playing time and began to show more of his abilities as a talented young guard.

The [[1998–99 NBA season|1998–99]] season marked Bryant's emergence as a premiere guard in the league. With starting guards Nick Van Exel and Eddie Jones traded, Bryant started every game for the lockout-shortened 50 game season.

===Three-peat (1999–2002)===
[[File:Lipofsky Kobe .jpg|thumb|upright|Bryant was a member of the Lakers teams that won three consecutive NBA Championships from 2000 to 2002.]]

Jackson utilized the [[triangle offense]] he used to win six championships with the [[Chicago Bulls]], which would help both Bryant and O'Neal rise to the elite class of the NBA. The three resulting championships won consecutively in [[2000 NBA Finals|2000]], [[2001 NBA Finals|2001]], and [[2002 NBA Finals|2002]] further proved such a fact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/lakers/history/lakers_history_new.html |title=LAKERS: Los Angeles Lakers History |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=June 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryant started the [[1999–2000 NBA season|1999–2000]] season sidelined for six weeks due to an injury to his hand in a preseason game against the [[Washington Wizards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950CE7DB1130F936A25753C1A96F958260 N.B.A. : NOTEBOOK&amp;nbsp;– LOS ANGELES LAKERS; Bryant Out Six Weeks With a Broken Hand] October 15, 1999, The New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; With Bryant back and playing over 38 minutes a game, he saw an increase in all statistical categories in the 1999–2000 season. This included leading the team in assists per game and steals per game. The duo of O'Neal and Bryant backed with a strong bench led to the Lakers winning 67 games, tied for fifth-most in NBA history. This followed with O'Neal winning the MVP and Bryant being named to the [[All-NBA|All-NBA Team]] Second Team and All-NBA Defensive Team for the first time in his career (the youngest player ever to receive defensive honors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/lakers/history/lakers_history_new.html#35 |title=LAKERS: Los Angeles Lakers History |publisher=Nba.com |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While playing second fiddle to O'Neal in the playoffs, Bryant had some [[clutch (sports)|clutch]] performances including a 25 point, 11 rebound, 7 assist, 4 block game in game 7 of the Western Conference finals against the [[Portland Trail Blazers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/200006040LAL.html |title=Portland Trail Blazers at Los Angeles Lakers Box Score, June 4, 2000 |publisher=Basketball-Reference.com |date=June 4, 2000 |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also threw an alley-oop pass to O'Neal to clinch the game and the series. In the [[2000 NBA Finals]] against the [[Indiana Pacers]], Bryant injured his ankle in the second quarter of Game 2 and did not return to the game. He also missed Game 3 due to the injury. In Game 4, Bryant scored 22 points in the second half, and led the team to an OT victory as O'Neal fouled out of the game. Bryant scored the winning shot to put the Lakers ahead 120–118.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.indystar.com/library/factfiles/sports/basketball/indiana_pacers/2000/pacers2000.html |title=NBA Finals: Pacers vs. Lakers |publisher=.indystar.com |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a 116–111 Game 6 victory, the Lakers won their first championship since [[1988 NBA Finals|1988]].&lt;ref&gt;Plaschke, Bill.

Statistically, the [[2000–01 NBA season|2000–01]] season saw Bryant perform similarly to the previous year, except Bryant averaged 6 more points a game (28.5). It was also the year when disagreements between Bryant and O'Neal began to surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-8847419_ITM |title=Article: No doubt: It's Bryant's team.(Chicago Tribune) &amp;#124; AccessMyLibrary&amp;nbsp;– Promoting library advocacy |publisher=AccessMyLibrary |date=May 22, 2002 |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once again he led the team in assists with 5 per game. The Lakers however, only won 56 games, an 11-game drop off from last year. The Lakers would respond by going 15–1 in the playoffs. They easily swept the Portland Trail Blazers, [[Sacramento Kings]], and [[San Antonio Spurs]], before losing their first game against the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in OT. They would go on to win the next 4 games and bring their second championship to Los Angeles in as many seasons. During the playoffs, Bryant played heavy minutes which brought his stats up to 29.4 points, 7.3 rebounds, and 6.1 assists per game. In the playoffs, teammate O'Neal declared Bryant the best player in the league.&lt;ref name=&quot;HighSchool&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jyfR2pDOt3k |title=Kobe Bryant greatest games (2001 playoffs): 36pts 9rbds 8asts in game 3 vs Spurs |publisher=YouTube |date=September 3, 2008 |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant ended up making the All NBA Second team and All NBA Defensive Team for the second year in a row. In addition, he was also voted to start in the NBA All-Star Game for the 3rd year in a row (no game in 1999).

In the [[2001–02 NBA season|2001–02 season]], Bryant played 80 games for the first time in his career. He continued his all-round play by averaging 25.2 points, 5.5 rebounds, and 5.5 assists per game. He also had a career high 46.9% shooting and once again led his team in assists. While making the All-Star team and All-NBA Defensive team again, he was also promoted to the All-NBA First Team for the first time in his career. The Lakers won 58 games that year and finished second place in the [[Pacific Division (NBA)|Pacific Division]] behind in-state rival [[Sacramento Kings]]. Bryant was suspended one game after he punched [[Reggie Miller]] of the [[Indiana Pacers]] after the Lakers' March 1, 2002 victory over the Pacers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Springer|first=Steve|title=Bryant Fight Remains a No Decision|url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/2002/mar/03/sports/sp-lakers03|accessdate=April 24, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=March 3, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Beck|first=Howard|title=Punch-uation Mark|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/PUNCH-UATION+MARK+KOBE,+REGGIE+MILLER+BRAWL+AFTER+LAKERS%27+VICTORY...-a083463621|accessdate=April 24, 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Daily News|date=March 2, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The road to the Finals would prove a lot tougher than the record run the Lakers had the previous year. While the Lakers swept the Blazers and defeated the Spurs 4–1, the Lakers did not have home court advantage against the Sacramento Kings. The series would stretch to 7 games, the first time this happened to the Lakers since the 2000 Western Conference Finals. However, the Lakers were able to beat their division rivals and make their third consecutive [[NBA Finals]] appearance. In the [[2002 NBA Finals|2002 Finals]], Bryant averaged 26.8 points, 51.4% shooting, 5.8 rebounds, 5.3 assists per game, which included scoring a quarter of the teams points.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finals&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nba/02playoffs/2002-06-14-kobe.htm | work=USA Today | title=Bryant's heroics, deference pay off for Lakers | date=June 14, 2002 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 23, Bryant became the youngest player to win three championships.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finals&quot; /&gt; Bryant's play was notable and praised for his performance in the 4th quarter of games, specifically the last 2 rounds of the playoffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finals&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/games/20020512/LALSAS/recap.html |title=PLAYOFFS 2002 |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cemented Bryant's reputation as a [[clutch (sports)|clutch]] player.

[[File:Kobe Bryant 8.jpg|thumb|upright|Bryant prepares to shoot a free throw in 2005.]]
In the [[2002–03 NBA season|2002–03]] season, Bryant averaged 30 points per game and embarked on a historic run, posting [[List of 40-plus point games by Kobe Bryant|40 or more points]] in nine consecutive games while averaging 40.6 in the entire month of February. In addition, he averaged 6.9 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], 5.9 [[assist (basketball)|assists]], and 2.2 [[steal (basketball)|steals]] per game, all career highs up to that point. Bryant was once again voted on to both the All-NBA and All-Defensive 1st teams,&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot; /&gt; and came in third place in voting for the MVP award. After finishing 50–32 in the regular season, the Lakers foundered [[2003 NBA Playoffs|in the playoffs]] and lost in the Western Conference semi-finals to the eventual NBA champions [[San Antonio Spurs]] in six games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/playoffs2003/series?series=lalsas |title=NBA Playoffs 2003&amp;nbsp;– Los Angeles Lakers vs. San Antonio Spurs |publisher=[[ESPN]].com |accessdate=June 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Setting records and playoffs disappointments (2004–07)===

Bryant was closely scrutinized and criticized during the 2004–05 season with his reputation badly damaged from all that had happened over the previous year. A particularly damaging salvo came when Phil Jackson wrote ''[[The Last Season: A Team in Search of Its Soul]]''. The book detailed the events of the Lakers' tumultuous [[2003–04 NBA season|2003–04 season]] and has a number of criticisms of Bryant. In the book Jackson called Bryant &quot;uncoachable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/06/sports/basketball/06lakers.html |title=Coach and Star Savor Success in Collaboration |date=May 6, 2006 |work=The New York Times  |accessdate=August 5, 2008 | first=Howard | last=Beck}}&lt;/ref&gt; Midway through the season, [[Rudy Tomjanovich]] suddenly resigned as Lakers coach, citing the recurrence of health problems and exhaustion.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press.

Some of Bryant's best moves are his [[turnaround jump shot]], and his ability to [[post up]] his defenders and score with a [[fadeaway]] [[jump shot (basketball)|jumpshot]]. Chris Ballard, a ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' NBA writer, describes a &quot;jab step-and-pause&quot; as a move Bryant uses where he jabs his non-pivot foot forward to let the defender relax and instead of bringing the jab foot back, he pushes off it and drive around his opponent to get to the basket.&lt;ref&gt;Ballard, Chris.

===Personal life===
In November 1999, 21-year-old Bryant met 17-year-old Vanessa Laine while she was working as a background dancer on the [[Tha Eastsidaz]] music video &quot;G'd Up&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rap&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eonline.com/On/Holly/Shows/Bryant/facts.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060219203516/http://www.eonline.com/On/Holly/Shows/Bryant/facts.html |archivedate=February 19, 2006 |title=Everything You Need to Know About Kobe Bryant |accessdate=October 16, 2007}}&amp;nbsp;– Wayback Machine cache from February 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant was in the building working on his debut musical album, which was never released. The two began dating and became engaged just six months later in May 2000,&lt;ref name=&quot;rap&quot; /&gt; while Laine was still a senior at [[Marina High School]] in [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]], California. To avoid media scrutiny, she finished high school through independent study.&lt;ref name=&quot;rap&quot; /&gt; According to Vanessa's cousin Laila Laine, there was no [[prenuptial agreement]]. Vanessa said Bryant &quot;loved her too much for one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://allstarz.hollywood.com/kobe/vanessa02.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070406105500/http://allstarz.hollywood.com/kobe/vanessa02.htm |archivedate=April 6, 2007 |author=Shawn Hubler |title=Kobe's costar Vanessa Laine was just another sheltered teenager in Orange County.

They married on April 18, 2001, at St. Edward Roman Catholic Church in [[Dana Point, California|Dana Point]], California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stritof|last2=Stritof |first1=Sheri |first2=Bob|url=http://marriage.about.com/cs/celebritymarriages/a/kobebryant.htm|title=Kobe Bryant and Vanessa Laine Marriage Profile|work=[[About.com]] |accessdate=September 11, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Bryant's parents, his two sisters, longtime advisor and agent Arn Tellem, nor Bryant's Laker teammates attended. Bryant's parents were opposed to the marriage for a number of reasons. Reportedly Bryant's parents had problems with him marrying so young, especially to a woman who was not African-American.&lt;ref name=&quot;rap&quot; /&gt; This disagreement resulted in an estrangement period of over two years, which ended when Bryant had his first daughter.

In January 2002, Bryant bought a [[Mediterranean Revival architecture|Mediterranean-style]] house for $4&amp;nbsp;million, located in a [[cul-de-sac]] in [[Newport Coast, Newport Beach]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ZNAdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2KcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6703,744809 |title=Kobe Bryant Buys Home For More Than $4 million |publisher=News.google.com |date= |accessdate=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bryants' first child, a daughter named Natalia Diamante Bryant, was born on January 19, 2003. The birth of Natalia influenced Bryant to reconcile his differences with his parents. Vanessa Bryant suffered a [[miscarriage]] due to an [[ectopic pregnancy]] in the spring of 2005. Their second daughter, Gianna Maria-Onore Bryant, was born on May 1, 2006. Gianna was born six minutes ahead of former teammate [[Shaquille O'Neal]]'s daughter Me'arah Sanaa, who was born in Florida.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/shaq%20is%20a%20dad%20six%20minutes%20after%20kobe_02_05_2006 &quot;Shaq is a Dad Six Minutes After Kobe&quot;].

In an early 2007 interview, it was revealed that Bryant still speaks Italian fluently.&lt;ref name=&quot;italy&quot; /&gt; Bryant assigned himself the nickname of &quot;Black Mamba&quot;, citing a desire for his basketball skills to mimic the [[Black mamba|snake of that name]]'s ability to &quot;strike with 99% accuracy at maximum speed, in rapid succession.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/23/sports/sp-crowe23 |title=Text messages from press row . . . |last=Crowe |first=Jerry |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=May 23, 2008 |accessdate=August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sexual assault allegation===
{{Main|Kobe Bryant sexual assault case}}

In the summer of 2003, the sheriff's office of [[Eagle, Colorado]], arrested Bryant in connection with an investigation of a [[sexual assault]] complaint filed by 19-year old hotel employee [[Kobe Bryant sexual assault case|Katelyn Faber]]. Bryant had checked into The Lodge and Spa at Cordillera in Eagle County in advance of undergoing knee surgery nearby. Faber accused Bryant of raping her in his hotel room the night before Bryant was to have the procedure. Bryant admitted an adulterous sexual encounter with his accuser, but denied her sexual assault allegation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=SI Staff |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2003/basketball/nba/12/26/kobe.interview.ap/index.html?cnn-yes |date=December 23, 2003 |title=Bryant distracted, scared amid sex assault case |agency=Associated Press |work=Sports Illustrated |accessdate=February 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/lakers/2004-02-12-shaq-kobe_x.htm |title=Shaq, Kobe still main keys to Lakers' fortunes |first=David Leon |last=Moore |date=February 12, 2004 |work=USA Today |accessdate=February 25, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accusation tarnished Bryant's reputation, as the public's perception of Bryant plummeted, and his endorsement contracts with [[McDonald's]] and [[Nutella]] were terminated. Sales for Bryant's replica jersey fell significantly from their previous highs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,143646,00.html |title=Fans Shunning Kobe Bryant's Jersey&amp;nbsp;– Celebrity Gossip &amp;#124; Entertainment News &amp;#124; Arts And Entertainment |publisher=Fox News |date=January 7, 2005 |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in September 2004, the assault case was dropped by prosecutors after Faber refused to testify in the trial. Afterward, Bryant agreed to apologize to Faber for the incident, including his public [[mea culpa]]: &quot;Although I truly believe this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now that she did not and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate_dismissal&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/09/02/MNG6E8IB861.DTL |title=Bryant rape case ends in dismissal |first=T.R. |last=Reid |date=September 2, 2004 |accessdate=October 16, 2007 |newspaper=[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Prosecutors Drop Kobe Bryant Rape Case |author=Kirk Johnson |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/02/national/02kobe.html?_r=1 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 2, 2004 |accessdate=July 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faber filed a separate civil lawsuit against Bryant, which the two sides ultimately settled with the specific terms of the settlement being undisclosed to the public.

In a 2008 video promoting Nike's Hyperdunk shoes, Bryant appears to jump over a speeding [[Aston Martin]].
