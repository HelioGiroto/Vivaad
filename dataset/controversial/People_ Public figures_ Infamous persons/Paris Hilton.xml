She is the great-granddaughter of [[Conrad Hilton]], the founder of [[Hilton Hotels]]. Born in New York City and raised in California and New York, Hilton began a modeling career as a teenager when she was with [[Donald Trump]]'s modeling agency, T Management. Her hard-partying lifestyle and rumoured short-lived relationships with [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] and [[Oscar de la Hoya]] led her to earn a position as a daily fixture in entertainment news – gossip-section Page Six, of the ''[[New York Post]]'' often includes articles about Hilton. Being known as a socialite, Hilton was hailed by the media as &quot;New York's leading [[It Girl]]&quot; in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Times shown are ET |url=http://www.biography.com/people/paris-hilton-11271420?page=1 |title=Paris Hilton Biography – Facts, Birthday, Life Story |publisher=Biography.com |date=February 17, 1981 |accessdate=2012-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; She went on to make cameo appearances in ''[[Zoolander]]'' (2001), ''[[Wonderland (film)|Wonderland]]'' and ''[[The Cat in the Hat (film)|The Cat in the Hat]]'' (both 2003).

Hilton gained significant notoriety for a [[1 Night in Paris|sex tape]], which was released in November 2003, shortly before the premiere of the television reality series ''[[The Simple Life]]'' alongside fellow socialite and childhood best friend [[Nicole Richie]]. The show was a massive hit for the FOX network, premiering with 13 million viewers,&lt;ref name=&quot;ratingssuccess&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/fox-the-simple-life-premiere-draws-13-million-viewers-and-night-highest-adults-18-49-rating-2050.php |title=FOX's 'The Simple Life' premiere draws 13 million viewers and the night's highest Adults 18–49 rating |publisher=Realitytvworld.com |accessdate=2012-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and brought Hilton and co-star Richie to an international recognition.

==Entertainment career==

===2000–2002: Early work===
Hilton began modeling as a child, initially at charity events.&lt;ref name=&quot;porter&quot;/&gt; When she was 19, she signed with [[Donald Trump]]'s modeling agency, T Management.&lt;ref name=&quot;porter&quot;/&gt; Hilton stated that while she &quot;wanted to model,&quot; Trump was wishing to have her at his agency, and after she signed she was &quot;loving&quot; the work.&lt;ref name=&quot;porter&quot;/&gt; Hilton has also worked with [[Ford Models]] in New York, [[Models 1|Models 1 Agency]] in London, [[Nous Model Management]] in Los Angeles, and [[Premier Model Management]] in London. She has appeared in numerous advertising campaigns, including [[Iceberg Vodka]], [[Guess?|GUESS]], [[Tommy Hilfiger]], [[Christian Dior]], and [[Marciano Stores|Marciano]]. In 2001, Hilton began to develop a reputation as a socialite, being identified as &quot;New York's leading It Girl&quot; whose fame was beginning to &quot;extend beyond the New York [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]]s&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;porter&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| last = Porter|first = Charlie|title = New York style: 'Is this article going to trash me?': Heiress, star of the social columns and now a top model.. Charlie Porter meets Paris Hilton|work=The Guardian (London)|pages = Guardian Features Pages, p. 8 |date=February 16, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has appeared in several magazines, including ''[[Elle (magazine)|Elle]]'', the April 2004 issue of ''[[Maxim magazine|Maxim]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maximonline.com/Parishilton/girls_of_maxim/69.aspx?src=GM7070:MD Paris Hilton's girl gallery]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the October 2005 cover of ''[[Stuff (magazine)|Stuff]]''.

Hilton started to act by doing cameo appearances in films such as ''[[Zoolander]]'' (2001). In 2002, she was one of the leads in the [[straight-to-video]] horror movie ''[[Nine Lives (2002 film)|Nine Lives]]''. The film did well in sales. ''Beyondhollywood.com'' felt that &quot;Hilton’s presence in the cast is the film’s main marketing point, which is plainly obvious by the fact that she’s front and center on the box art and is the only recognizable name in the cast&quot; and also noted that her character was basically herself: &quot;Hilton plays — what else? — a spoiled American socialite who shops on three continents in one day. The script is even clever enough to take a few jabs at Hilton’s real-life social standing, even mentioning that she’s been on the cover of a few sleaze rags in her day&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beyondhollywood.com/nine-lives-2002-movie-review/|title=Nine Lives (2002) Movie Review|publisher=Beyondhollywood.com|accessdate=Aril 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003–2005: Career breakthrough===
Hilton's breakout role came in 2003, when she co-starred with socialite counterpart [[Nicole Richie]] in the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] reality series ''[[The Simple Life]]'', which premiered on December 2, 2003, shortly after Hilton's sex tape was released.&lt;ref name=&quot;star&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,627219,00.html|title='Simple Life' Establishes Hilton's Star|work=People|accessdate=April 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show started airing to surprisingly well received ratings; the premiere episode drew 13,000,000 viewers, increasing Fox's Adults 18–49 rating a phenomenal 79%.&lt;ref name=&quot;ratingssuccess&quot; /&gt; &quot;everyone likes it because it's for all ages.

Some entertainment writers felt the overnight success of Hilton was spawned by the whole tape controversy. ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' commented: &quot;I dare say the Paris Hilton-Rick Salomon tape received more print and television coverage in a week than the run-up to ''The Simple Life'' received in the months since its premiere was announced. We in the media have become Paris-ites&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,535692,00.html|title=The Simple Life Review|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=May 18, 2012|date=December 4, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine wrote that the show &quot;no doubt was helped by the very public saga of a pirated three-year-old video tape, which recently made the rounds on the Internet showing Hilton engaged in various sex acts with ex-boyfriend Rick Salomon&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;star&quot; /&gt; At that time, she started to be recognizable for her onscreen [[dumb blonde]] persona in reality television. According to UK's ''[[Now (magazine)|Now]]'' magazine, in a 2009 interview she said that &quot;For five seasons I was stuck doing this character. It was kind of hard always having to play that character when it's not who I am&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nowmagazine.co.uk/celebrity-news/people/299518/paris-hilton-insists-she-s-not-stupid/1|title=Paris Hilton insists she's not stupid|publisher=Now magazine|accessdate=May 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a January 2011 interview with ''[[Movieline]]'', she remarked: &quot;In ''The Simple Life'', producers told me to play a dumb blonde and that's what I did. I didn't realize at the time that I'd have to do that for five seasons and keep up this character of me. I think people assume that that is how I am in real life but I'm actually quite a businesswoman&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://movieline.com/2011/01/14/paris-hilton-plays-movielines-my-favorite-scene/|title=Paris Hilton Plays My Favorite Scene: 'Who Was It?

Hilton launched a [[lifestyle brand]] in 2004. She helped design a collection of purses for Japanese label [[Samantha Thavasa]]. The 10-piece line collection, a jewelry line designed by Hilton, started being on sale on [[Amazon.com]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/5888425/ Paris Hilton creates jewelry line] ''Msnbc.msn.com''&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;I grew up surrounded by the finest fashion and jewelry designs, and I really wanted to create a line that was beautiful and very high quality, yet affordable and available to everyone,&quot; Hilton stated. &quot;This jewelry is for the heiress in everyone.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;parishiltonline&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,691014,00.html|title=Paris Hilton Launches Her Own Jewelry Line|publisher=People.coom|accessdate=March 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The line was described as  &quot;inspired by Hilton's personal style – feminine, flirtatious and glamorous – with heart, star and cross motifs.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;parishiltonline&quot;/&gt; She was involved in the creation of a perfume line by Parlux Fragrances. Originally set to be a small release, high demand led to a wider release before December 2004. The launch was followed by a 47% increase in sales of Parlux products, predominantly due to sales of the Hilton-branded perfume.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biz.yahoo.com/e/050815/parl10-q.html Form 10-Q for Parlux Fragrances, Inc.] ''Biz.

===Legal troubles===
Hilton was arrested and charged with [[driving under the influence|driving under the influence of alcohol]] with a [[blood alcohol content]] of 0.08%, the level at which it is illegal to drive in California. The arrest complicated the shooting of the fifth season of series. Hilton's driving license was subsequently suspended in November 2006,&lt;ref name=&quot;findlaw article&quot;/&gt; and in January 2007 she pleaded [[Nolo contendere|no contest]] to a [[reckless driving]] charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title= Paris Hilton's Misdemeanor DUI Charges |date=September 21, 2006|publisher=FindLaw|url =http://news.findlaw.com/cnn/docs/ent/cahilton92606cmp.html| accessdate = May 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her punishment was 36 months' [[probation]] and fines of about $1,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16757099/ |title=Paris Hilton pleads no contest to DUI charge |publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She also did not have her headlights on even though it was after dark.
