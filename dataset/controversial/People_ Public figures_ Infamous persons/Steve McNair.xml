ESPN.com. Retrieved 2009-07-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

McNair played [[college football]] at [[Alcorn State University|Alcorn State]] in [[Lorman, Mississippi]], where he won the 1994 [[Walter Payton Award]] as the top player in [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Championship Subdivision|NCAA Division I-AA]]. He was [[1995 NFL Draft|drafted]] third overall by the NFL's [[Tennessee Titans|Houston Oilers]] in 1995, becoming the Oilers' regular starting quarterback in 1997, their first season in Tennessee (though he started six games over the prior two seasons in Houston), and remained the starting quarterback for the Titans through 2005. After the 2005 season, McNair was traded to the [[Baltimore Ravens]], with whom he played for two seasons before retiring after thirteen NFL seasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;fox 07.06.09&quot;&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,530180,00.html?loomia_ow=t0:s0:a16:g2:r1:c0.190072:b26221114:z0 Shooting Unveils Very Different Sides of Ex-NFL Quarterback Steve McNair]. ''[[Fox News]]'', 2009-07-06. Retrieved 2009-07-06.&lt;/ref&gt;

McNair led the Titans to the playoffs four times, and the Ravens once, and played in [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] with the Titans. He is the Titans' all-time leading passer. McNair was selected to the [[Pro Bowl]] three times, was [[All-Pro]] and [[National Football League Most Valuable Player Award|Co-MVP]] in 2003, all as a Titan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d81124656&amp;template=without-video-with-comments&amp;confirm=true McNair helped bring stability and success to vagabond franchise]&lt;/ref&gt;

McNair died on July 4, 2009, when his mistress, Sahel Kazemi, shot and killed him before turning the gun on herself.

==Early life==
McNair was born in [[Mount Olive, Mississippi]], and attended Mount Olive High School as a freshman in the fall of 1987, where he played [[American football|football]], [[baseball]], and [[basketball]] in addition to running track. As a junior, McNair led Mount Olive to the state championship. McNair also played free safety in high school, and in 1990 alone, he intercepted fifteen passes, raising his career total to 30, which tied the mark established by [[Terrell Buckley]] at [[Old Pascagoula High School|Pascagoula High School]].&lt;ref name=&quot;officialstevemcnair.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.officialstevemcnair.com/biography.php |title=The Steve McNair Foundation |publisher=Officialstevemcnair.com |date=1973-02-14 |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; An All-State selection, McNair was named an All-American by Super Prep magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;officialstevemcnair.com&quot;/&gt;

The [[Seattle Mariners]] drafted him in the 35th round of the [[1991 Major League Baseball Draft|1991 MLB amateur draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/draft/?query_type=name&amp;name=mcnair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College career==
McNair was initially offered a full scholarship to the University of Florida to play defensive back, but wanting to play quarterback, McNair chose division I-AA Alcorn State. McNair played college football for [[Alcorn State University]], a [[Historically black colleges and universities|historically black university]] which competes in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s Division I-AA (now known as the [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Championship Subdivision|Football Championship Subdivision]]) [[Southwestern Athletic Conference]] (SWAC). In 1992, McNair threw for 3,541 yards and 29 touchdowns, and ran in for 10 more scores. The Braves fashioned a record of 7–4, including a last-second victory in their rematch with [[Grambling State University|Grambling]]. In that contest, McNair returned from an injury and helped Alcorn State, trailing late in the final period, move deep into Tigers' territory. Then, despite a leg injury, he tucked the ball under his arm and dove into the end zone for the winning touchdown. The victory over Grambling helped the Braves qualify for the I-AA playoffs. McNair helped Alcorn State to another good year in 1993, as the Braves upped their record to 8–3 while McNair threw for more than 3,000 yards and 30 touchdowns. He was also named First-Team All-SWAC for the third year in a row. 

In his senior season, McNair gained nearly 6,000 yards rushing and passing, along with 53 touchdowns. In the process, he surpassed more than a dozen records and was named an All-American. In addition, McNair won the [[Walter Payton Award]] as the top I-AA player&lt;!--This was the last Payton Award for which all I-AA players were eligible. The next year, it became an offense-only award with the creation of the Buck Buchanan Award.--&gt; and finished third in the [[Heisman Trophy]] voting behind [[Rashaan Salaam]] and [[Ki-Jana Carter]]. McNair set career records for the Football Championship Series with 14,496 passing yards, as well as the division record for total offensive yards with 16,283 career yards.&lt;ref name=&quot;fox 07.06.09&quot;/&gt; The records still stand.&lt;ref name=&quot;fox 07.06.09&quot;/&gt;

He was a member of the fraternity [[Omega Psi Phi]], highlighting his allegiance by tattooing “Omega Man” on his arm.&lt;ref name=&quot;officialstevemcnair.com&quot;/&gt;

==Professional career==
===Houston Oilers===
With the third overall pick in the [[1995 NFL Draft]], the [[Houston Oilers]] and new head coach [[Jeff Fisher]] selected McNair, making him at the time the highest drafted African-American [[quarterback]] in [[NFL]] history and signing him to a seven-year contract. McNair did not see his first action until the last two series of the fourth quarter in a November game versus the [[Cleveland Browns]]. Late in the season, he also appeared briefly against the [[Detroit Lions]] and [[New York Jets]]. Meanwhile, starting quarterback [[Chris Chandler]] finished as the AFC's fourth-best passer. In 1996, McNair remained a backup to Chandler until starting a game in December against the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]].

===Tennessee Oilers/Titans===
McNair's first season as the Oilers' starter in 1997 (the team's first year in [[Tennessee]]) resulted in an 8–8 record for the team, which played its home games at the [[Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium|Liberty Bowl]] in [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. McNair's 2,665 passing yards were the most for the Oilers since [[Warren Moon]] in 1993, and his 13 interceptions were the fewest for a single season in franchise history. He also led the team in rushing touchdowns with eight and ranked second behind running back [[Eddie George]] with 674 yards on the ground, the third-highest total for a quarterback in NFL history.

In 1998, McNair set career passing highs with 492 attempts, 289 completions, 3,228 yards and 15 touchdowns for the Oilers, now competing in Nashville. He also cut his interceptions to ten, helping his quarterback rating climb to 80.1.

The team officially changed its name from Oilers to Titans for the 1999 season as they debuted a new stadium, [[LP Field|Adelphia Coliseum]].  Early in the 1999 season, McNair was diagnosed with an inflamed disk following Tennessee's 36–35 win over the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], and needed surgery. In his stead entered [[Neil O'Donnell]], a veteran who had guided the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] to the Super Bowl four years earlier. Over the next five games, O'Donnell led the Titans to a 4–1 record. McNair returned against the [[St. Louis Rams]], and with McNair starting, Tennessee won seven of its last nine games, good for a record of 13–3 and second place in the [[AFC Central]].

Tennessee opened the [[NFL playoffs, 1999–2000|playoffs]] at home against the [[Buffalo Bills]] in a Wild Card game, winning on the &quot;[[Music City Miracle]]&quot; and eventually advancing to [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] in a re-match with the Rams. On the final play of the game, a McNair pass to [[Kevin Dyson]] was complete, but [[Final play of Super Bowl XXXIV|Dyson was unable to break the plane of the goal line]], giving the Rams the win. McNair signed a new six-year contract after the season worth [[United States dollar|$]]47 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2006-04-22-notes_x.htm?csp=34 Notes: Favre backs McNair; Leinart hires Condon]. ''[[USA Today]]'', 2006-04-22. Retrieved 2009-07-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a 13–3 season in 2000 that ended in a playoff loss to the [[Baltimore Ravens]], the 28-year-old McNair put together his most productive year as a pro. McNair registered career passing highs in yards (3,350), completions (264), touchdowns (21) and quarterback rating (90.2). He was also the team's most effective rusher, tying George for the club lead with five scores. Named to the Pro Bowl for the first time, McNair sat out the game due to a shoulder injury.&lt;ref&gt;The Steve McNair Foundation, [http://www.officialstevemcnair.com/biography.php?pageid=3 Biography]. Retrieved 2009-07-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Tennessee finished the regular season 11-5 and reached the playoffs. In the divisional playoff contest against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], McNair threw for a career postseason high 338 yards and two touchdowns, with two interceptions, while rushing for 29 yards and another score on the ground. The game had a controversial finish when, after missing a game winning field goal at the end of regulation time and a second failed kick in overtime was negated because of a controversial running-into-the-kicker penalty on Pittsburgh's [[Dewayne Washington]], kicker [[Joe Nedney]] won the game from 26 yards out 2:15 into overtime. Steelers coach [[Bill Cowher]] said that he called a timeout before the winning kick took place.
McNair and the Titans reached the AFC Championship game but were unable to reach the Super Bowl, losing to the [[Oakland Raiders]] 41-24. 

After this loss in 2002, McNair was arrested for DUI and illegal gun possession in May 2003. His blood alcohol was above 0.10, and a 9-mm handgun had been sitting in the front of the car.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/7518506 Judge: Officer didn't have 'sufficient basis' to stop McNair for DUI]. ''[[CBSSports.com]]'', 2004-07-22. Retrieved 2009-07-04.&lt;/ref&gt; All charges related to the incident were later dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;fox 07.06.09&quot;/&gt;

In December of the 2003 season, an injured calf and ankle kept McNair on the sidelines for two games, though he still  finished with the best numbers of his career, including 24 touchdown passes and a quarterback rating of 100.4. The Titans ended at 12–4, the same record as the Colts, but Indianapolis took the [[AFC South]] by virtue of its two victories over Tennessee. McNair and Colts quarterback [[Peyton Manning]] were named co-NFL MVPs following the season, which ended in a playoff loss to the [[New England Patriots]] for the Titans. He finished the season as the league leader in [[passer rating]] and became the youngest player in [[NFL]] history to pass for 20,000 yars and run for 3,000 yards.

McNair missed the 2004 season's fourth game with a bruised sternum, an injury suffered the previous week against Jacksonville,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Sports_News/2004/09/27/McNair-hospitalized-with-bruised-sternum/UPI-14731096324472/ McNair hospitalized with bruised sternum]. ''[[UPI]]'', 2004-09-27. Retrieved 2009-07-04.&lt;/ref&gt; and played in only five more games that season. In 2005 he played in 14 games because of a back injury. 

These series of season ending injuries, made the Titans take the business decision of locking him out of their team headquarters in the 2006 offseason. The team wouldn't let him rehab in its building because it feared an injury would force the franchise to pay him $23.46 million (his contract had been restructured so often that his salary cap reached a hard-to-manage amount). The [[Players Association]]'s filed a grievance on his behalf, for which an arbitrator ruled that the team violated its contract, openning the possibility for a trade.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/trainingcamp08/news/story?id=3545105&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltimore Ravens===
[[File:Steve McNair Tackle.jpg|200px|thumb|right|McNair seen being tackled during an October 2006 game against the [[San Diego Chargers]].]]
Following the 2005 season, on April 30, 2006, the Titans allowed McNair and his agent, [[James &quot;Bus&quot; Cook]], to speak with the Ravens to try to work out a deal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;&gt;Walker, Teresa M.

Retrieved 2009-07-04.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, 2006, the [[Baltimore Sun]] reported that the Baltimore Ravens might wait for McNair to be released by the Titans during free agency.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} Speculation was that the Titans might hold onto McNair until the week before training camp in late July if the Ravens didn't come up with a satisfactory trade offer for McNair according to a league source.&lt;ref&gt;Clayton, John. [http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=clayton_john&amp;id=2473771 McNair could have playoff impact in Baltimore]. ''[[ESPN.com]]'', 2006-05-24. Retrieved 2009-07-04.&lt;/ref&gt; However, on June 7, 2006, the two teams worked out a deal to send McNair to the Ravens for a 4th-round pick in the [[2007 NFL Draft]]. On June 8, McNair flew to Baltimore, passed a physical, and was announced as the newest member of the Ravens.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot; /&gt;

The 2006 season saw McNair start each game for the Ravens, missing only portions of two games. In the week 14 game against the [[Kansas City Chiefs]], McNair threw the longest touchdown pass in the Ravens' history, when he threw an 89 yard touchdown pass to receiver [[Mark Clayton (American football, born 1982)|Mark Clayton]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.titansonline.com/news/article-1/a-look-back-at-the-career-of-steve-mcnair/7bafa73a-0a67-4b0b-847d-c74e278737fb A Look Back at the Career of Steve McNair:Career Highlights, 2006 Baltimore] www.titansonline.com&lt;/ref&gt;
McNair helped Baltimore to a 13&amp;ndash;3 record and an [[AFC North]] Championship. McNair started at quarterback in his first playoff game as a Raven when his team faced the Colts on January 13, 2007. McNair was 18 of 29 for 173 yards with no touchdowns and two interceptions, as the Ravens lost 15–6.

On May 9, 2007 McNair was a passenger in a car that was pulled over for suspicion of drunk driving. Both the driver of the vehicle, his brother-in-law, and McNair were arrested for driving under the influence. Under Tennessee law, one can still be arrested for DUI even if a passenger in one's own car and the driver is believed to be under the influence. McNair owned the pick-up truck involved and was charged with DUI by consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ravens' McNair arrested on DUI charge |publisher=Baltimore Sun |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/football/bal-mcnair0510,0,2911203.story?coll=bal-sports-headlines |first=Jamison |last=Hensley |date=2007-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges were dropped on July 10, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, Teresa, [http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=AmaAald2kNefNcRJ7iqCjZhDubYF?slug=ap-mcnair-chargesdropped&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns DUI charge against McNair dropped] (July 10, 2007), Yahoo! Sports, Retrieved on July 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, McNair did not play in Week 2 against the Jets which the Ravens won 20&amp;ndash;13. He also did not play the full game in Week 3, however, the game was won by the Ravens, 26&amp;ndash;23. McNair missed nine more games during the rest of the season, including getting pulled after taking many hits from Steelers' linebacker [[James Harrison (American football)|James Harrison]] in Week 9, and fumbling the ball twice.  McNair only started six games for the Ravens in 2007.

After thirteen seasons in the NFL, McNair announced his retirement in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoreravens.com/News/Articles/2008/04/McNair_Says_Goodbye_to_Ravens_NFL.aspx McNair Says Goodbye to Ravens, NFL]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July of 2012, McNair was named the thirty-fifth greatest quarterback of the NFL's post-merger era, according to Football Nation. As of October 2012, he is the only deceased quarterback on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.footballnation.com/content/top-100-qbs-since-the-merger-40-21/15546/ | work=Football Nation | title=Top 100 Modern Quarterbacks: 40-21 | date=July 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|We are saddened and shocked to hear the news of Steve McNair's passing today. He was one of the finest players to play for our organization and one of the most beloved players by our fans.

The Titans held a two-day memorial at LP Field on July 8 and 9, 2009, where fans could pay their last respects to McNair. Highlights from his career were played throughout each day and fans were able to sign books that were later given to the McNair family.

During the 2009 NFL season, every member of the Titans wore a commemorative &quot;9&quot; sticker placed on the back of each helmet to honor McNair. Funeral services were held for McNair at the Reed Coliseum on the campus of the University of Southern Mississippi on July 11 at 11:00 AM (CST) and he is buried at Griffith Cemetery in [[Prentiss, Mississippi|Prentiss]], Mississippi.

On October 15, 2010 it was reported that McNair’s widow went to a Nashville judge and asked that at least a portion of the assets be unfrozen so that his children could have some sort of monetary source. The judge agreed and each of the four children  received $500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge Gives McNair's Widow, Children $500k each|publisher=Miami Herald|author=Associated Press|date=2010-10-15 |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
