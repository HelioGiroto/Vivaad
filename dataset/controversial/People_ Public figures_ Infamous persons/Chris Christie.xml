'''Christopher James &quot;Chris&quot; Christie'''{{cn|date=November 2012}} (born September 6, 1962){{cn|date=November 2012}} is the [[List of Governors of New Jersey|55th and current]] [[Governor of New Jersey]]. 
Upon his election to the governorship in [[New Jersey gubernatorial election, 2009|November 2009]], Christie became the first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to win a statewide election in New Jersey in 12 years. Christie, an attorney, previously served as [[United States Attorney for the District of New Jersey]] and as a [[Morris County, New Jersey]] [[Board of Chosen Freeholders|Freeholder]].
In 2011, he considered entering the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential candidates, 2012|race for the Republican Presidential nomination]] but ultimately decided not to run. 

Christie delivered the keynote address at the [[2012 Republican National Convention]].

==Early life, education, and family==
Chris Christie was born in [[Newark, New Jersey]], the son of Sondra A. (n√©e Grasso) and Wilbur James &quot;Bill&quot; Christie, a certified public accountant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/christopher_j_christie/index.html &quot;Times Topics: Christopher J.

Chris Christie hosts his 16th town hall in his hometown of Livingston Wednesday to talk about proposals to help New Jersey towns control property taxes.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Christie graduated from the [[University of Delaware]] with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[political science]] in 1984 and [[Seton Hall University School of Law]] with a [[Juris Doctor]] in 1987. Christie was admitted to the [[New Jersey State Bar Association]] and the Bar of the United States District Court, District of New Jersey, in December 1987. After being elected the [[Governor of New Jersey]], he was awarded honorary doctorate degrees from [[Rutgers University]], which is the state university of New Jersey, and from [[Monmouth University]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/05/rutgers_graduates_largest_clas.html &quot;Rutgers University graduates largest class, gives N.J.

Chris Christie as graduation speaker&quot;]. ''[[NJ.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Christie married Mary Pat Foster, a fellow student at the University of Delaware. After marriage they shared a one-room apartment in [[Summit, New Jersey]]. Mary Pat Christie pursued a career in investment banking, eventually working at the Wall Street firm [[Cantor Fitzgerald]]. She left the firm in 2001 following the [[September 11 attacks]], only recently returning to work part-time.&lt;ref name=Ledger/&gt; They have four children: Andrew (born 1993), Sarah (born 1996), Patrick (born 2000), and Bridget (born 2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Josh|last=Margolin|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/01/mary_pat_christie_readies_for.html |title=Mary Pat Christie readies for role as state's first lady|publisher=[[NJ.com]]|date=January 3, 2010|accessdate=October 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christie and his family reside in [[Mendham Township, New Jersey|Mendham Township]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Governor Christie|url=http://www.state.nj.us/governor/admin/about/|publisher=State of New Jersey|accessdate=February 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Anybody Home?

==Early career==

===Lawyer===
In 1987, Christie joined the law firm of Dughi, Hewit &amp; Palatucci of [[Cranford, New Jersey]]. In 1993, he was named a partner in the firm. Christie specialized in securities law, appellate practice, election law, and government affairs. He is a member of the [[American Bar Association]] and the New Jersey State Bar Association and was a member of the Election Law Committee of the New Jersey State Bar Association.

===Morris County Freeholder===
Christie, at the time a resident of [[Mendham, New Jersey|Mendham]], was in 1994 elected as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the Morris County Board of Chosen Freeholders, with Christie and a running mate having defeated incumbent freeholders in the party primary. After that election, the defeated incumbents filed [[defamation]] lawsuits against Christie based on statements made during the primary campaign. Christie had incorrectly stated that the incumbents were under investigation for violating certain local laws. The lawsuit was settled out of court.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christie's 1st political foray&quot;&gt;{{cite news| first=Geoff| last=Mulvihill| title=Christie's 1st political foray was bumpy| work=[[USA Today]]| date=May 29, 2009 |accessdate=July 28, 2009 |url=http://content.usatoday.net/dist/custom/gci/InsidePage.aspx?cId=thedailyjournal&amp;sParam=30858801.story}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As freeholder, Christie required the county government to obtain three quotes from qualified firms for all contracts. He led a successful effort to bar county officials from accepting gifts from people and firms doing business with the county. He voted to raise the county's open space tax for land preservation; however, county taxes on the whole were decreased by 6.6% during his tenure. He successfully pushed for the dismissal of an architect hired to design a new jail, saying that the architect was costing taxpayers too much money. The architect then sued Christie for defamation over remarks he made about the dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Heininger | first = Claire | title = GOP candidate Chris Christie launched political career as Morris County freeholder | newspaper= [[The Star-Ledger]] | date = May 11, 2009| url = http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2009/05/gop_candidate_chris_christie_l.html| accessdate = Aug 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Christie announced a bid for a seat in the [[New Jersey General Assembly]]; he and attorney [[Rick Merkt]] ran as a ticket against incumbent Assemblyman [[Anthony Bucco]] and attorney [[Michael Patrick Carroll]] in the Republican primary. Bucco and Carroll, the establishment candidates, defeated the up-and-comers by a wide margin. After this loss, Christie's bid for re-nomination to the freeholder board was unlikely, as unhappy Republicans recruited [[John J. Murphy]] to run against Christie in 1997. Murphy defeated Christie in the primary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Pizarrom| first = Max| title = A political career in three parts: Chris Christie, the freeholder| newspaper= [[Politicker Network|PolitickerNJ.com]]| date = Dec 29, 2008| url = http://www.politickernj.com/max/26275/political-career-three-parts-chris-christie-freeholder| accessdate = Aug 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murphy, who had falsely accused Christie of having the county pay his legal bills in the architect's lawsuit, was sued by Christie after the election. They settled out of court; nevertheless, Christie's career in Morris County politics was over by 1998.

===Lobbyist===
In 1998 Christie registered as a lobbyist for the firm of Dughi, Hewit &amp; Palatucci, alongside fellow partner and later, gubernatorial campaign fundraiser Bill Palatucci. Between 1999 and 2001, Christie and Palatucci lobbied on behalf of, among others, [[FirstEnergy#GPU|GPU Energy]] for deregulation of New Jersey's electric and gas industry; the [[Securities Industry Association]] to block the inclusion of securities fraud under the state's Consumer Fraud Act; [[Hackensack University Medical Center]] for state grants, and the [[University of Phoenix]] for a New Jersey higher education license.&lt;ref name=lobbying&gt;{{cite news| first=Josh| last=Margolin| title=Christie, Corzine duel over outsider label| work=[[The Star-Ledger]]| date=August 26, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2009 |url=http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/jersey/index.ssf?/base/news-14/1251251115315720.xml&amp;coll=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States Attorney==
Christie served as the chief federal law enforcement officer in New Jersey from January 17, 2002, to December 1, 2008. His office included 137 attorneys, with offices in [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]], [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] and [[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]]. Christie also served as one of the 17 U.S. Attorneys on Attorneys General [[John Ashcroft]] and [[Alberto Gonzales]]' [[Attorney General's Advisory Committee of United States Attorneys|advisory committee]].

===Appointment===
On December 7, 2001, Christie was nominated to be the [[U.S. Attorney for the District of New Jersey]]. He was unanimously confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on December 20, 2001, and sworn into office on January 17, 2002.

Controversy surrounded his appointment; some members of the New Jersey Bar professed disappointment at Christie's lack of criminal law experience and his history as a top fundraiser for [[George W. Bush]]'s [[George W. Bush presidential campaign, 2000|2000 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Mansnerus| first=Laura| title=New Jersey G.O.P. and Legal Elite Differ on U.S. Attorney| newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]| date=August 26, 2001| url =http://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/26/nyregion/new-jersey-gop-and-legal-elite-differ-on-us-attorney.html| accessdate = March 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The extent of the role played by Bush's political adviser, [[Karl Rove]], also became an issue after Christie's law partner, William Palatucci, a Republican political consultant and Bush supporter, boasted that he had selected a United States attorney by forwarding Christie's r√©sum√© to Rove.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Kirkpatrick| first=David D.| last2=Rutenberg| first2=Jim| title=E-Mail Shows Rove's Role in Fate of Prosecutors | newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date=March 29, 2007| url =http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/29/washington/29rove.html?pagewanted=all| accessdate = August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christie has stated that his distant familial connection to [[Genovese crime family]] leader [[Tino Fiumara]] never came up during his [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] background check for his position as a U.S. Attorney; he told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2009 that he had assumed that investigators were aware of the connection.&lt;ref name=fiumaralink&gt;{{cite news |first1=David M. |last1=Halbfinger| first2=David | last2=Kocieniewski | title=For Christie, Family Tie No Candidate Can Relish | newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 23, 2009 |accessdate=October 17, 2009 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/24/nyregion/24christie.html?hp}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure as U.S. Attorney, Christie recused himself from his office's investigation, indictment, and prosecution of Fiumara for aiding the flight of a fugitive.&lt;ref name=fiumaralink /&gt; A 2011 commentary on [[MarketWatch]] identified Fiumara as Christie's aunt's husband's late brother and said Christie has dismissed the relationship as a &quot;private matter&quot;.&lt;ref name=MW01&gt;Delamaide, Darrell (September 28, 2011), [http://www.marketwatch.com/story/the-billionaires-choice-christie-for-president-2011-09-28 &quot;The billionaire's choice: Christie for president&quot;], [[MarketWatch]], Retrieved September 28, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Achievements===
[[File:US Attorney Chris Christie.jpg|thumb|220px|Christie served as the United States Attorney for New Jersey from 2002 to 2008.]]
Despite the initial misgivings over his degree of experience, Christie received praise for his history of convictions for public corruption. During his tenure, Christie's office won convictions or guilty pleas from 130 public officials, both Republican and [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]], on the state, county and local levels without losing a single case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Editorial| first=| title=An impressive resume| newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]| date=November 17, 2008 | url =http://blog.nj.com/njv_editorial_page/2008/11/an_impressive_resume.html| accessdate =March 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable of these convictions included those of [[Hudson County, New Jersey|Hudson County]] Executive [[Robert C.

===Claims of misuse of deferred prosecution agreements===
Christie has been accused of using his office's role in crafting [[deferred prosecution agreement]]s to award lucrative federal monitoring positions in no-bid contracts to friends, supporters, and allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christie Defends&quot;/&gt; Questions first arose after Christie awarded a multimillion-dollar [[no-bid contract]] to David Kelley, another former U.S. Attorney, who had investigated Christie's brother, Todd Christie, in a 2005 fraud case involving traders at the [[Wall Street]] firm, [[Spear, Leeds &amp; Kellogg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Associated Press| title=Candidate for N.J. guv is under fire| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date=April 7, 2009| url = http://www.philly.com/dailynews/national/42571227.html| accessdate = July 27, 2009}}{{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

The top three were indicted, as were eleven other traders.&lt;ref name= Brother&gt;{{Citation|last=Smothers| first=Ronald| title= Federal Prosecutor's Brother Among 20 Charged in Trading Scheme| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date=April 14, 2005| url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980DE0D9133EF937A25757C0A9639C8B63l| accessdate = September 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christie was similarly criticized for his 2007 recommendation of the appointment of [[The Ashcroft Group, LLC|The Ashcroft Group]], a consulting firm owned by Christie's former superior, the former United States Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]], as a monitor in a court settlement against [[Zimmer Holdings]], an Indiana medical supplies company. The no-bid contract was worth between $28 million and $52 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last= John P. Martin| first= and Jeff Whelan| title= $52M-plus payday for Christie's old boss| newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]| date= January 10, 2008| url= http://blog.nj.com/ledgerarchives/2008/01/52mplus_payday_for_christies_o.html| accessdate= March 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last= John P.

|accessdate= August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christie defended the decision, saying that Ashcroft's prominence and legal acumen made him a natural choice. Christie declined to intercede when Zimmer's company lawyers protested the Group's plans to charge a rate of $1.5 million to $2.9 million per month for the monitoring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christie Defends&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last= Friedman|first= Matt| title= Zimmer lawyer complained of Ashcroft fees| newspaper= [[Politicker Network|PolitickerNJ.com]]| date= June 25, 2009| url=http://www.politickernj.com/matt-friedman/30892/zimmer-lawyer-complained-ashcroft-fees| accessdate = August 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] began holding hearings on the matter, the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] re-wrote the rules regarding the appointment of court monitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Shenon| first=Philip| title= New Guidelines Ahead of Ashcroft Testimony| newspaper=[[The New York Times]]| date=March 11, 2008| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/11/washington/11ashcroft.html| accessdate = March 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christie also faced criticism over the terms of a $311-million fraud settlement with [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]].

In June 2009, Christie was called before the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]] as part of its consideration of new regulations on deferred prosecution agreements. In his testimony, he defended his decisions to award no-bid, high-paying federal monitoring contracts to law firms that his critics say constitute a conflict of interest. Christie left the meeting after two and a half hours of questioning, against the requests of the Committee's chairman, stating that he had to attend to pressing business in New Jersey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christie Defends&quot;&gt;{{Citation | last=Kocieniewski | first=David | title= In Testy Exchange in Congress, Christie Defends His Record as a Prosecutor | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=June 26, 2009 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/26/nyregion/26christie.html | accessdate = July 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Christie agrees to testify&quot;&gt;{{ Citation | last=Heininger

===Claims of partisan attacks===
[[File:2.9.11ChrisChristieTownHallByLuigiNovi3.jpg|thumb|Christie at a town hall meeting in [[Union City, New Jersey]] February 9, 2011.]]
Christie has been criticized for subpoenaing Senator [[Robert Menendez]] during his contested 2006 campaign, just two months before the election.&lt;ref name=&quot;Usually on attack&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| last=Kocienniewski | first=David | title= Usually on Attack, U.S. Attorney in Newark Finds Himself on the Defensive | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=February 13, 2008 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/13/nyregion/13christie.html | accessdate = May 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Prosecutor Makes Meal&quot;&gt;{{ Citation | last=Harowitz | first=Jason | title= Prosecutor Makes a Meal of N.J.

===Cell phone monitoring and alleged entrapment===
In 2005, Christie prosecuted the [[Hemant Lakhani]] [[terrorism]] case, in which the defendant claimed that he had been [[entrapment|entrapped]]. In that case, Christie's office relied on an informant who had been dismissed by the [[FBI]] as unreliable for fabricating claims of terrorist activity. For more than a year, the informant, working with the U.S. attorney's office, solicited Lakhani for access to arms. Lakhani was unable to obtain anything until an undercover agent contacted him and supplied him with a fake missile. In an interview with the public radio program ''[[This American Life]]'',&lt;ref name=tal2009&gt;{{cite episode | title=Arms Trader 2009 | series=[[This American Life]] | airdate=August 7, 2009 | season=15 | number=387 | minutes=50:45 | network=[[Chicago Public Radio]] | url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/Radio_Episode.aspx?sched=1310 | accessdate=August 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christie brushed off suggestions that Lakhani was entrapped by law enforcement, defending the Lakhani prosecution.

In April 2009, the [[ACLU]] publicized records showing that Christie had obtained court orders authorizing warrantless [[Mobile phone tracking|cellphone tracking]] of people in 79 instances. Christie responded that the practice was legal and court approved. An ACLU attorney stated that federal law does not address cell phone or GPS use in surveillance and added that the ACLU believes a law requiring warrants for such use is needed.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACLU&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| last= Heininger| first=Claire| title= ACLU says Chris Christie authorized warrantless cellphone tracking| newspaper=[[The Star-Ledger]]|location=Newark, NJ| date=April 23, 2009| url = http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2009/04/aclu_says_chris_christie_autho.html | accessdate = July 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, Christie defeated [[Jon Corzine]] by a margin of 48.5% to 44.9%, with 5.8% of the vote going to independent candidate [[Chris Daggett]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Official General Election Results |publisher=New Jersey Division of Elections |url=http://www.njelections.org/election-results/2009-official-general-election-gov-lt-gov-tallies-120109.pdf |accessdate=November 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christie took office as [[Governor of New Jersey]] on January 19, 2010. He chose not to move his family into &quot;[[Drumthwacket]]&quot;, the official governor's mansion, and instead resides in a private [[Mendham, New Jersey]], residence.

On February 9, 2010, he signed Executive Order No. 12, which placed a 90-day freeze on the [[Council on Affordable Housing|Council on Affordable Housing (COAH)]] and established the Housing Opportunity Task Force to examine the State's affordable housing laws, constitutional obligations, and the effectiveness of the current framework.&lt;ref name=&quot;Christie EO 12&quot;&gt;{{cite web| authorlink =| title = Governor Christie Executive Order No. 12| publisher =| date = February 9, 2010| url = http://nj.gov/infobank/circular/eocc12.pdf| doi =| accessdate = February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Chris Christie at townhall.jpg|thumb|Christie at a town hall in March 2011]]
On February 11, 2010, Christie signed Executive Order No. 14, which declared that a &quot;state of fiscal emergency exists in the State of New Jersey&quot; due to the projected $2.2 billion budget deficit for the current fiscal year (FY 2010).&lt;ref name=&quot;Christie EO 14&quot;&gt;{{cite web| authorlink =| title = Governor Christie Executive Order No. 14| publisher =| date = February 11, 2010| url = http://nj.gov/infobank/circular/eocc14.pdf| doi =| accessdate = February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech before a special joint session of the [[New Jersey Legislature]] on the same day, Christie addressed the budget deficit and proposed various fiscal measures to close the gap. Christie also suspended funding for the [[New Jersey Department of the Public Advocate|Department of the Public Advocate]] and for the [[Children's Ombudsman#United States|Office of the Child Advocate]] and called for their elimination.&lt;ref name=&quot;FY2010 Budget Solutions Press Release&quot;&gt;{{cite web| authorlink =| title = FY 2010 Budget Solutions Press Release| publisher =| date = February 11, 2010| url = http://www.state.nj.us/governor/news/news/552010/pdf/FY2010BudgetSolutions0219.pdf| doi =| accessdate = February 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Democrats criticized Christie for not first consulting them on his budget cuts and for circumventing the Legislature's role in the budget process.&lt;ref name=&quot;NJ Democrats Blast Christie&quot;&gt;{{cite web| authorlink = Statehouse Bureau Staff| title = N.J.

On August 25, 2010, the US [[Department of Health and Human Services]] announced $400 million in federal [[Race to the Top]] education grants to New Jersey would not be funded due to a clerical error in the state's application made by an unidentified mid-level state official. Christie responded by saying that the [[Obama administration]] bureaucracy had overstepped its authority and that the error lay in an administration failure to communicate with the New Jersey government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Friedman|first=Matt|date=August 25, 2010|url=http://www.nj.com/news/index.ssf/2010/08/gov_christie_blames_washington.html|title=Gov.

Schundler maintained that he told Christie the truth and that Christie was misstating what actually occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Katz|first=Matt|date=August 28, 2010|url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/front_page/20100828_Christie_fires_education_chief_Schundler_after_U_S__aid_mistake.html|title=Christie fires education chief Schundler after U.S. aid mistake|newspaper=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Jersey Education Association rebuked Christie by suggesting that his rejection of a compromise worked out by Schundler with the teachers' union on May 27 was to blame.

During his second year in office, Christie signed into law a payroll tax cut that reduced funding of the Temporary Disability Insurance (TDI) fund by $190 million per year. Effective for calendar year 2012, the tax cut authorizes the [[New Jersey Department of Labor and Workforce Development]] to reduce payroll deduction for most employees from $148 to $61 per year. The changes took effect on January 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Hester, Tom, Sr. (October 17, 2011).

On February 17, 2012, he vetoed a bill that would have legalized [[same sex marriage]] in New Jersey. He stated his belief that such a change requires a constitutional amendment and asked the legislature to provide for a referendum on the issue. He also called for creation of an [[ombudsman]] to ensure compliance with the state's existing [[Recognition of same-sex unions in New Jersey|civil union]] law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=N.J. Gov.

==Consideration of presidential run in 2012 election==

Christie was the subject of ongoing speculation that he would attempt a run for [[President of the United States]] in [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012]] by competing in the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2012|Republican primaries]]. He consistently denied any interest in launching a presidential bid.  In September 2011, a number of press stories cited unnamed sources indicating Christie was reconsidering his decision to stay out of the race. An Associated Press story dated September 30 indicated a decision on whether he would run for president in 2012 would be made &quot;soon&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=AP Sources: Christie Soon to Decide on Primary Run|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/apnewsbreak-christie-decide-2012-bid-14643134|date=September 30, 2011|first=Beth|last=DeFalco|publisher=[[ABC News]]|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a late September speech at the [[Reagan Library]], he had again said he was not a candidate for president, but the speech also coincided with his &quot;reconsideration&quot; of the negative decision. One commentator at that time reviewed reported support from [[David H. Koch|David H.]] and [[Charles G. Koch]], [[Kenneth Langone]], and others for Christie's potential candidacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;MW01&quot;/&gt; Retired [[GE]] CEO [[Jack Welch]] went on ''[[Charlie Rose (TV show)|Charlie Rose]]'' to articulate his and others' support for a candidacy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/11921 &quot;Update on the 2012 Republican Presidential Candidates&quot;].

On August 27, 2012, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that according to anonymous sources Christie had not been willing to give up the governorship to be Mitt Romney's running mate because he had doubts about their ability to win.
