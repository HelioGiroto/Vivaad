'''Vickie Lynn Marshall''' (née '''Hogan''') (November 28, 1967 – February 8, 2007), aka '''Vickie Smith''', before settling on '''Anna Nicole Smith''' as her [[moniker]], was an American model, actress and television personality. Smith first gained popularity in ''[[Playboy]]'', becoming the 1993 [[Playboy Playmate|Playmate of the Year]]. She modeled for clothing companies, including [[Guess (clothing)|Guess]] jeans and [[Lane Bryant]].

Smith dropped out of high school and was married in 1985. Her highly publicized second marriage to oil business mogul [[J. Howard Marshall]], 62 years her senior, resulted in speculation that she married the [[octogenarian]] for his money, which she denied. Following Marshall's death, Smith began a lengthy legal battle over a share of his estate; her case, ''[[Marshall v. Marshall]]'', reached the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] on a question of [[Federal jurisdiction (United States)|federal jurisdiction]] and again on a question of bankruptcy court authority (now called ''[[Stern v. Marshall]]''). Smith died on February 8, 2007 in a [[Hollywood, Florida]] hotel room as a result of an overdose of prescription drugs. Within the final six months of her life, Smith was the focus of a renewed press coverage surrounding the death of her son, [[Daniel Wayne Smith|Daniel]] and the paternity and custody battle over her newborn daughter, [[Dannielynn Birkhead paternity case|Dannielynn]].

==Early life==
Born '''Vickie Lynn Hogan''' in [[Harris County, Texas]],&lt;ref name=&quot;tbi1&quot;&gt;Ancestry.com. Texas Birth Index, 1903–1997 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Anna Nicole was the child of Donald Eugene Hogan (July 12, 1947&amp;nbsp;– September 19, 2009) and Virgie Mae (née Tabers; born July 12, 1951),&lt;ref name=&quot;tbi1&quot; /&gt; who married on February 22, 1967&lt;ref name=&quot;Ancestry 2005&quot;&gt;Ancestry.com. ''Texas Divorce Index, 1968–2002'' [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; and divorced on November 4, 1969. She had five [[half siblings]] including half-sister [[Donna Hogan]]. Anna Nicole was raised by her mother and aunt. Virgie subsequently married Donald R. Hart in 1971. After Virgie married Donald, Anna Nicole changed her name from Vickie Hogan to Nikki Hart.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070209/us_nm/annanicole_mexia_dc |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070212044127/http://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20070209/us_nm/annanicole_mexia_dc |archivedate=February 12, 2007 |title=High school remembers Anna Nicole&amp;nbsp;– barely|authors=Ed Stoddard and Jessica Rinaldi| publisher=Reuters|accessdate=February 14, 2007|date=February 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Anna Nicole attended Durkee Elementary School and Aldine Intermediate School in Houston. When she was in the 9th grade, she was sent to live with her mother's younger sister, Kay Beall, in [[Mexia, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Eric Redding and D'Eva Redding, ''Great Big Beautiful Doll: The Anna Nicole Smith Story'', New York: Barricade Books, 1996, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Mexia High School]], Anna Nicole failed her freshman year and later quit school during her sophomore year.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Marshall'', 275 B.R. 5, 20 (C.D.

She then became a [[stripper]], and in 1991, began taking modeling and voice lessons. In October of that year, she saw an ad in the newspaper to audition for ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;employment&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003563989_annanicole09.html|title=Living and dying in the spotlight | work=The Seattle Times | date=February 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992 Smith was chosen by [[Hugh Hefner]] to appear on the cover of the March issue of ''Playboy'', where she was listed as Vickie Smith, wearing a low-cut [[evening gown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080617230702/http://cbs2chicago.com/slideshows/anna.nicole.smith.20.316061.html|archivedate=June 17, 2008|title=Anna Nicole Smith's Playboy Covers|publisher=cbs2chicago.com|accessdate=February 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[centerfold]] was photographed by [[Stephen Wayda]].&lt;ref name=wekinglypigs&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wekinglypigs.com/cgi-bin/nand/search/pmstat?browse=%3A%3ACONFIG%3A%3Amodelbrowse&amp;key=smith%2C+vickie+%5Banna+nicole%5D&amp;limit=0|title=Playmate data|accessdate=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Smith said she planned to be &quot;the next [[Marilyn Monroe]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/news/2007/02/10/db1002.xml |title=Anna Nicole Smith |date=February 10, 2007 |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |accessdate=February 10, 2007 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070214073121/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/news/2007/02/10/db1002.xml| archivedate= February 14 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Becoming one of ''Playboy'''s most popular models, Smith was heavier and larger than the typical Playboy model.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/celebrities/profile/index.jsp?uuid=81bfdc70-976b-4998-af8c-6c742894a6a8 |title=Anna Nicole Smith – Profile, Latest News and Related Articles |publisher=Eonline.com |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith was chosen to be the 1993 Playmate of the Year. By the time of her PMOY pictorial, she had settled on the name '''Anna Nicole Smith'''.&lt;ref name=wekinglypigs /&gt;

Smith secured a contract to replace supermodel [[Claudia Schiffer]] in the [[Guess (clothing)|Guess]] jeans ad campaign in a series of sultry black and white photographs. Guess capitalized on Smith's strong resemblance to  [[Jayne Mansfield]] and put her in Jayne-inspired photo sessions. In 1993, before Christmas, she modeled for the Swedish clothing company Hennes &amp; Mauritz ([[H&amp;M]]).  She appeared on big posters in Sweden and Norway.

A photograph of Smith was used by ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine on the cover of its August 22, 1994 issue titled ''White Trash Nation''. In the photo, she appears squatting in a short skirt and cowboy boots as she eats chips.
In October 1994, Smith's lawyer initiated a $5,000,000 lawsuit against the magazine claiming unauthorized use of her photo and that the article had damaged her reputation. Her lawyer said that Smith was told she was being photographed to embody the &quot;all-American-woman look&quot;, and that they wanted glamour shots. He further stated that the picture used was taken for fun during a break.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01E2DA1F3CF932A15753C1A962958260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fS%2fSuits%20and%20Litigation

==Marriage to Marshall==
While performing at Gigi's (now renamed as &quot;Pleasures&quot;), a Houston [[strip club]], in October 1991, Smith met elderly [[Petroleum industry|oil tycoon]] [[J. Howard Marshall]] and they began a relationship. During their two-year relationship, he reportedly lavished gifts on her and asked her to marry him several times.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Marshall'', 275 B.R. 5, 21 (C.D. Cal. 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; She divorced her husband Billy on February 3, 1993, in Houston.&lt;ref&gt;Ancestry.com. Texas Divorce Index, 1968–2002 [database on-line]. Provo, UT, USA: The Generations Network, Inc., 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 27, 1994, Smith, 26, and Marshall, 89, married in Houston.&lt;ref name = &quot;Ancestry.com-Tx Marriage Collection&quot;/&gt; This resulted in a great deal of gossip about her marrying him for his money.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Primetime/story?id=1320909 |title=Fame and Infamy Surround Anna Nicole Smith|publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=November 17, 2005 |accessdate=February 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though she reportedly never lived with him,&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://marriage.about.com/od/entertainmen1/p/annasmith.htm | title=The Marriages of Anna Nicole Smith | work=[[About.com]] |author=Sheri and Bob Stritof |accessdate=February 14, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070211175738/http://marriage.about.com/od/entertainmen1/p/annasmith.htm| archivedate= February 11 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith maintained that she loved her husband, and age did not matter to her. Thirteen months after his marriage to Smith, Marshall died at age 90 on August 4, 1995, in Houston.

==Inheritance court cases==
{{Main|Marshall v. Marshall}}
Within weeks of J. Howard Marshall's death, Smith and her husband's son, [[E. Pierce Marshall]], battled over her claim for half of her late husband's US$1.6&amp;nbsp;billion estate. She temporarily joined forces with J. Howard's other son, James Howard Marshall III, whom the elder Howard had disowned. Howard III claimed J. Howard orally promised him a portion of his estate; like Smith, Howard III was also left out of J. Howard's [[will (law)|will]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=8db67be4-ab0e-4e57-8034-c3559371643e | title=Probate Jury Disses Anna Nicole | work=[[E! Online]] | date=March 8, 2001 |last=Grossberg |first=Josh |accessdate=February 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case has gone on for more than a decade, producing a highly publicized court battle in Texas and several judicial decisions that have gone both for and against Smith in that time.&lt;ref&gt;''In re Marshall'', 392&amp;nbsp;F.3d 1118, 1124–1131 (9th Cir. 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Smith filed for bankruptcy in California as a result of a $850,000 judgment against her for sexual [[harassment]] of an employee. As any money potentially due to her from the Marshall estate was part of her potential assets, the bankruptcy court involved itself in the matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Anna Nicole Smith's Supreme Fight |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/28/AR2006022800142_pf.html |work=Washington Post |date=March 1, 2006|last=Lane|first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Lane (journalist) |accessdate=February 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith claimed J. Howard orally promised her half of his estate if she married him. In September 2000, a Los Angeles bankruptcy judge awarded her $449,754,134. In July 2001, [[Houston]] judge Mike Wood affirmed the jury findings in the probate case by ruling that Smith was entitled to nothing and ordered Smith to pay over $1&amp;nbsp;million in fees and expenses to Pierce's legal team. The conflict between the Texas probate court and California bankruptcy court judgments forced the matter into federal court.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.eonline.com/news/article/index.jsp?uuid=05a8eb71-9b00-4da9-bd45-f4770e721619 |last=Grossberg |first=Josh |publisher=[[E! Online]] |title=Judge Orders Anna Nicole to Pay Up |date=July 17, 2001|accessdate=February 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2002, a federal judge vacated the California bankruptcy court's ruling and issued a new ruling but reduced the award to $88&amp;nbsp;million. In December 2004, a three-judge panel of the U.S. [[9th Circuit Court of Appeals]] reversed the March 2002 decision, on the reasoning that the federal courts lacked jurisdiction to overrule this probate decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5lfMtEXaH | archivedate=November 30, 2009 | title=E. Pierce Marshall v. Vickie Lynn Marshall | work=United States Court of Appeals, Ninth Circuit. | date=October 9, 2003|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Supreme Court decided in September 2005 to hear the appeal of that decision. The [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] subsequently directed the [[United States Solicitor General|Solicitor General]] to intercede on Smith's behalf out of an interest to expand federal court jurisdiction over state probate disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://entertainment.tv.yahoo.com/entnews/ap/20051226/113560590000.html| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060219125202/http://entertainment.tv.yahoo.com/entnews/ap/20051226/113560590000.html| archivedate=February 19, 2006 | title=White House Aids Playboy Playmate in Court | publisher=[[Yahoo!|Yahoo!

The justices unanimously decided in favor of Smith; Justice [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]] wrote the majority opinion. The decision did not give Smith a portion of her husband's estate, but affirmed her right to pursue a share of it in federal court.&lt;ref name = &quot;nytmay&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/01/washington/01cnd-smith.html?ex=1304136000&amp;en=e61be83b13708e78&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |title=Anna Nicole Smith Wins Supreme Court Case|first=David|last=Stout|work=The New York Times |date=May 1, 2006|accessdate=February 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On June 20, 2006, [[E.

On June 23, 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling against the estate of Anna Nicole Smith, holding that a bankruptcy court ruling giving her estate a sum of 475 million was decided without [[subject-matter jurisdiction|jurisdiction]] (now called ''[[Stern v. Marshall]]''). A California bankruptcy court awarded Smith part of the estate, but the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeal said that a bankruptcy court could not make a decision on an issue outside of bankruptcy law.
The U.S. Supreme Court agreed with the ruling of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Circuit Court of Appeals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Supreme Court Rules Against Anna Nicole Smith's Estate|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2011/06/23/137366848/supreme-court-rules-against-anna-nicole-smiths-estate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and television career==
In 1994, after a long wish of having an acting career, Smith debuted with a [[bit part|minor role]] in the [[screwball comedy film]] ''[[The Hudsucker Proxy]]''. Later the same year she played a supporting role opposite [[Leslie Nielsen]] and [[Fred Ward]] in the cop [[comedy film]] ''[[Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult]]''. Though both of these appearances were highly publicized, little was done to further Smith's acting career. 

Her first major role was as Colette Dubois, a retired spy seeking revenge for the murder of her husband, in the [[action film|action]]/[[thriller (genre)|thriller]] ''[[To the Limit (1995 film)|To the Limit]]'' (1995). Smith next starred in the [[direct-to-video]] &quot;soft porn&quot; action/thriller ''[[Skyscraper (1996 film)|Skyscraper]]'' (1996), which she also produced, as a helicopter pilot, Carrie Wisk,&lt;ref&gt;

Both ''To the Limit'' and ''Skyscraper'', and Smith's performances in them, were critically panned. During the course of the [[litigation]] over her late husband's estate, her career stalled. Her legal battle, her increasing weight, and her reportedly bizarre behavior made her regular fodder for [[late night television]] comedians.

In 2002, after a severe weight-gain, a faltered movie career, and struggling financial problems, Smith debuted in her own reality television series on the [[E!]] [[cable television|cable]] network, ''[[The Anna Nicole Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Ken |last=Tucker |title=Anna Nicole Smith show an obscene train wreck |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/08/05/ew.hot.annanicole/index.html |work=Entertainment Weekly  |date=August 5, 2002 |accessdate=February 9, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070212001724/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/08/05/ew.hot.annanicole/index.html| archivedate= February 12 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series focused on her personal and private life in the manner of other reality shows, such as the ratings hit ''[[The Osbournes]]''.

The debut of ''The Anna Nicole Show'' was the highest rated series on the network, but critics blasted it and ratings dropped with each successive week. However, it achieved a [[cult television|cult]] status among some, particularly college fraternities.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph&quot;/&gt; The show was canceled in February 2004 due to &quot;creative differences,&quot; but has retained some life in [[rerun]]s and on DVD releases.

Smith's next appearance on the big screen was as herself in ''[[Wasabi Tuna]]'' (2003), about a group of friends who kidnap her dog, Sugar-Pie, on [[Halloween]]. She appeared as herself again in ''[[Be Cool]]'' (2005), a crime/comedy about the film and music industries that stars [[John Travolta]], [[Uma Thurman]] and [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]]. She produced and starred as &quot;Lucy&quot; in ''[[Illegal Aliens (film)|Illegal Aliens]]'', a sci-fi/comedy about beautiful space aliens saving the earth from evil. The film is a mixture of the 1970s television drama series ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' and the sci-fi film ''[[Men in Black (film)|Men in Black]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.edgewoodstudios.com/extra/ai_Synapse_page.html |title=Edgewood Studios: Illegal Aliens|accessdate=February 14, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070216010420/http://www.edgewoodstudios.com/extra/ai_Synapse_page.html| archivedate= February 16 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Smith as spokesperson==
In an interview on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', Smith was asked what her &quot;Playmate diet&quot; consisted of. She instantly replied, &quot;fried chicken&quot;. In October 2003, she became a spokesperson for [[TrimSpa]], which helped her lose a reported 69&amp;nbsp;lb (31&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref name=weightloss1&gt;{{Cite news |title=Living and dying in the spotlight |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003563989_annanicole09.html |work=[[The Seattle Times]] |date=February 9, 2007 |accessdate=February 9, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070210215157/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003563989_annanicole09.html| archivedate= February 10 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2004, she appeared at the [[American Music Awards]] to introduce a musical performance and attracted attention because of her slurred speech and behavior. During her live appearance, she threw her arms up and exclaimed, &quot;Like my body?&quot;.&lt;ref name=draw&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/09/ap/entertainment/mainD8N5S1000.shtml |title=What Drew Us to Anna Nicole |first=Jocelyn |last=Novak |agency=Associated Press |date=February 9, 2007|accessdate=February 14, 2007 | work=CBS News|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070211184307/http%3A//www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/02/09/ap/entertainment/mainD8N5S1000.shtml |archivedate = February 11, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smith murmured other comments and alluded to TrimSpa. The incident became comic material for presenters throughout the rest of the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/11/16/earlyshow/leisure/celebspot/main655962.shtml | title=What's Up With Anna Nicole Smith? | work=[[CBS News]] | date=November 16, 2004 |accessdate=February 14, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070211184117/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/11/16/earlyshow/leisure/celebspot/main655962.shtml| archivedate= February 11 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day, her appearance was featured in the media. [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|Tabloid]]s speculated that Smith was under the influence of pills or some other controlled substance. Her representatives explained that she was in pain due to a series of grueling workouts.

In March 2005, at the first [[MTV Australia Video Music Awards]] in Sydney's [[Luna Park Sydney|Luna Park]], she spoofed [[Janet Jackson]]'s [[wardrobe malfunction]] by pulling down her dress to reveal both breasts, each covered with the MTV logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  |title=Anna Nicole Flashes Crowd at MTV Event |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,149445,00.html |date=March 4, 2005 |agency=Associated Press|accessdate=February 14, 2007 |publisher=Fox News| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070225154931/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,149445,00.html| archivedate= February 25 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smith has also been featured in advertisements for the animal rights group [[PETA]]. Spoofing Marilyn Monroe's &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend&quot; segment in ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (film)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'', a 2004&amp;nbsp;ad states &quot;Gentlemen prefer fur-free blondes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://furisdead.com/feat/annanicole/ |title=Anna Nicole Smith poses for anti-fur ad.|publisher=furisdead.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to her support of the anti-fur movement, in particular her criticism of Canadian [[seal hunting]], [[PETA]] began a petition in memory of Smith to the Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] to end the annual tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://getactive.peta.org/campaign/anna_nicole_seal_hunt?preview=t |title=Anna Nicole Smith's petition to end the Canadian harp seal hunt.|publisher=furisdead.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another ad the following year, Smith posed with her dogs in a campaign against [[Iams]] dog food for their alleged cruelty to animals, as well as the manufacturer [[Procter and Gamble]], and sister company [[Eukanuba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iamscruelty.com/iams-feat-ans.asp |title=Anna Nicole Smith Dogs Pet-Food Maker Iams Over Deadly Experiments|publisher=iamscruelty.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Smith was addicted to prescription medications. Psychiatrist Dr Natalie Maullin said she met Smith in April 2006 in Cedars-Sinai Medical Centre. Maullin said Smith had borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://celebrity.uk.msn.com/news/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=154413604 Smith had personality disorder]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Birth of daughter===
{{Main|Dannielynn Birkhead paternity case}}
[[File:Anna Nicole Smith 164.jpg|thumb|Anna Nicole Smith in 2003]]
Smith announced on June 1, 2006, in a video clip posted on her official website that she was pregnant. &quot;Let me stop all the rumors,&quot; she said, while floating on an inflatable raft in a swimming pool. &quot;Yes, I am pregnant. I'm happy, I'm very, very happy about it. Everything's goin' really, really good and I'll be checking in and out periodically on the web, and I'll let you see me as I'm growing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=“” |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cqioG2lV6ug |title=YouTube Video |publisher=Youtube |date=November 28, 1967 |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though her announcement did not provide any details, in an interview with [[Larry King]] on [[CNN]]'s ''[[Larry King Live]]'' after her daughter's birth and her son's death, Smith's longtime personal attorney [[Howard K. Stern]] said that he and Smith had been in a secret relationship for &quot;a very long time&quot; and that, due to the timing of the pregnancy, he was confident that he was the father of the baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/TV/09/26/smith.baby/index.html | title=Attorney: I'm Anna Nicole's baby's father | publisher=CNN | date=September 27, 2006 |accessdate=February 14, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070210045645/http://www.cnn.com/2006/SHOWBIZ/TV/09/26/smith.baby/index.html| archivedate= February 10 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Entertainment photographer [[Larry Birkhead]], steadfastly maintained that he was the baby's father and filed a lawsuit to establish paternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,217358,00.html | title=Ex-Boyfriend Challenges Paternity of Anna Nicole Smith's Daughter | agency=Associated Press | date=October 3, 2006 |accessdate=February 14, 2007 |publisher=Fox News| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070313051005/http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,217358,00.html| archivedate= March 13 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Smith's daughter, [[Dannielynn Marshall Birkhead|Dannielynn Hope Marshall Stern]], was born September 7, 2006, at Doctors Hospital in [[Nassau, Bahamas]]. The Bahamian [[birth certificate]] recorded the father as Howard K. Stern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nationalledger.com/artman/publish/article_27268991.shtml | title=Anna Nicole Smith Names Howard K Stern as Dad on Birth Certificate | work=nationalledger.com | date=October 11, 2006 |last=Atkins |first=Jill |accessdate=February 14, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070210080634/http://www.nationalledger.com/artman/publish/article_27268991.shtml| archivedate= February 10 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge in the United States ordered that [[DNA]] tests be performed to determine the biological father of Dannielynn. Following Smith's death, Debra Opri, the lawyer for Larry Birkhead, asked for an emergency DNA sample to be taken from her body. Smith's lawyer, Ron Rale objected strongly to this request.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/people/after-the-death-burial-by-blog/2007/02/09/1170524284742.html | title=Baby with mother of a court battle |work=The Sydney Morning Herald  | date=February 10, 2007 |first=Mark |last=Coultan |accessdate=February 14, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070211174952/http://www.smh.com.au/news/people/after-the-death-burial-by-blog/2007/02/09/1170524284742.html| archivedate= February 11 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The request was denied by a judge, who instead ordered Smith's body preserved until February 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/17063518/ns/today-entertainment/t/judge-refuses-order-dna-test-smith | title= Judge refuses to order DNA test on Smith  | agency=Associated Press | date=February 9, 2007 |accessdate=October 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a story published in the ''[[New York Daily News]]'', [[Donna Hogan]], Smith's younger half-sister, has said that the model froze the sperm of her second husband, Marshall, prior to his death. The newspaper said that Hogan wrote in her unpublished manuscript about her sister, entitled ''Train Wreck'', that &quot;To her family, she hinted that she had used the old man's frozen sperm, and would be giving birth to Howard Marshall's child&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2007/02/10/2007-02-10_old_man_and_the_seed_print.html |title=Old man and the seed? |work=New York Daily News  |author=Caruso, Michelle and Siemaszko, Corky |date=February 9, 2007 |accessdate=February 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the publisher of Hogan's book described the newspaper's claims as a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,21209167-5006301,00.html |title=Anna Nicole's paternity story 'a Hoax' |first=Stefanie |last=Balogh |publisher=[[news.com.au]]|date=February 11, 2007 |accessdate=February 14, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070213065731/http://www.news.com.au/adelaidenow/story/0,22606,21209167-5006301,00.html| archivedate= February 13 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 9, 2007, [[Zsa Zsa Gabor]]'s husband [[Frédéric Prinz von Anhalt]] said that he had had a decade-long affair with Smith and could potentially be the father of her infant girl, Dannielynn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070209/ap_on_en_tv/anna_nicole_smith_125 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070213054347/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070209/ap_on_en_tv/anna_nicole_smith_125 |archivedate=February 13, 2007 |title=Gabor Husband may be Smith's baby's dad |date=February 9, 2007 |agency=Associated Press|accessdate=February 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Denk, a former bodyguard for Anna Nicole Smith, reportedly told the tabloid television program ''[[Extra (TV series)|Extra]]'' that he had had an affair with his former employer, and that it was possible he could be Dannielynn's father.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://extratv.warnerbros.com/2007/02/alex_denk.php |title=Could Anna Nicole's Bodyguard Be Dannielynn's Father? |date=February 12, 2007 |publisher=Warner Bros. |accessdate=February 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Smith's death, ''[[TMZ.com]]'' reported that Smith had been given a prescription for [[methadone]] under a false name while she was in her eighth month of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.tmz.com/2007/02/14/the-doctor-who-scored-methadone-for-anna-nicole/ | title=The Doctor Who Scored Methadone for Anna Nicole |date=February 14, 2007 |publisher=TMZ | accessdate=February 14, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Medical Board of California launched a review into the matter; the prescribing doctor, Sandeep Kapoor, said his treatment was &quot;sound and appropriate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2007/feb/17/local/me-doctor17 |title=Smith's doctor defends treatment |last=Proctor |first=Charles |work=Los Angeles Times  |date=February 17, 2007 |accessdate=October 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 10, 2007, a Bahamian judge ruled Larry Birkhead, photographer,  as the father of Dannielynn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1501119/story.cfm?c_id=1501119&amp;objectid=10433611|title=DNA results reveal father of Anna Nicole Smith's baby|publisher=[[The New Zealand Herald]]|date=April 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA tests had established Birkhead as the father, with 99.99% certainty.

Dr. Wecht announced on ''Larry King Live'' that the autopsy he performed showed that Daniel died from a lethal combination of [[Zoloft]], [[Lexapro]] and [[methadone]]. Although he explained that methadone is used in the treatment of [[drug addiction|heroin and morphine addiction]], Wecht said he had no information to make any conclusion why Daniel was using the drug. On February 8, 2007, Wecht said on [[Fox News]] that he still had no information about how Daniel obtained methadone.

===Commitment ceremony with Stern===
On September 28, 2006, Smith and [[Howard K. Stern]] exchanged vows and rings in an informal commitment ceremony aboard the {{convert|41|ft|m|adj=on}} [[catamaran]] Margaritaville off the coast of the Bahamas. She wore a white dress and carried a bouquet of red roses, while he wore a black suit with white shirt. Although they pledged their love and made a commitment to be there for one another before a [[Baptist minister]], no marriage certificate was issued and the ceremony is not legally binding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15061612/ | title=Anna Nicole Smith gets married, sort of | agency=Associated Press | date=September 29, 2006 |accessdate=February 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ceremony, they landed on the island of Sandy Cay where they had a party and celebrated with champagne and [[apple cider]] that had been brought over for the occasion by sailboat.&lt;ref name=&quot;About&quot;/&gt;

Regarding the questionable timing of the ceremony, Smith's attorney in Nassau, stated, &quot;They needed a little adrenaline boost because things have been so hectic and devastating in their life recently.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,1542771,00.html | title=Inside Anna Nicole's Surprise Ceremony | publisher=[[People (magazine)|People.com]] | date=October 5, 2006 |accessdate=February 14, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070210091221/http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,1542771,00.html| archivedate= February 10 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photos of their ceremony were sold through [[Getty Images]] to ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'' magazine for around $1,000,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://gawker.com/news/people/people-pays-1m-for-pics-of-anna-nicoles-weddingsuffering-204844.php |title='People' Pays $1M for Pics of Anna Nicole's Wedding/Suffering | publisher=gawker.com | date=October 3, 2006|accessdate=February 14, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070210063026/http://gawker.com/news/people/people-pays-1m-for-pics-of-anna-nicoles-weddingsuffering-204844.php| archivedate= February 10 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Residency in the Bahamas===
Smith and Stern were reportedly staying in the [[Bahamas]] to avoid [[parental testing|paternity testing]] of her daughter in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.inthenews.co.uk/entertainment/entertainment/quirky/anna-nicole-smith-back-in-hospital-$456420.htm | title=Anna Nicole Smith back in hospital | work=inthenews.co.uk |date=November 1, 2006 |accessdate=February 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2006, Smith was granted permanent resident status in the Bahamas by Immigration Minister [[Shane Gibson]]. On February 11, 2007, newspaper photographs were published showing Smith lying clothed in bed in an embrace with Gibson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/02/12/smith.bahamas.ap/index.html | title=New photos show Smith in bed with Bahamian immigration minister | agency=Associated Press|date=February 12, 2007 |accessdate=February 12, 2007|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070301202155/http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/02/12/smith.bahamas.ap/index.html |archivedate = October 12, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition politicians in the Bahamas accused the minister of improper behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/12/news/CB-GEN-Bahamas-Anna-Nicole-Smith.php | title=Photos of Anna Nicole Smith in bed with Bahamas immigration minister revive scandal | agency=Associated Press |date=February 11, 2007 | accessdate=February 11, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070214071121/http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2007/02/12/news/CB-GEN-Bahamas-Anna-Nicole-Smith.php| archivedate= February 14 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson resigned as a result of the controversy and claimed that the photos, taken by Stern, were innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/17218958/ns/today-entertainment/t/bahamas-immigration-minister-resigns/ | title=Bahamas immigration minister resigns | agency=Associated Press | date=February 19, 2007| accessdate=February 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basis of Smith's permanent residency status was the claim that she owned a $900,000 mansion, which she said was given to her by a former boyfriend, real estate developer [[Gaither Ben Thompson|G. Ben Thompson]] of South Carolina. Thompson asserted that he loaned Smith the finances to purchase the property, but that she failed to repay the loan, and was attempting to regain control of the property.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ent/celebrities/4549911.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070216004703/http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ent/celebrities/4549911.html |archivedate=February 16, 2007 |title=Official responds to bedroom photos with Anna Nicole|last=Melia |first=Michael |agency=Associated Press |date=February 13, 2007 |accessdate=February 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thompson sued to evict Smith from the property in Bahama Court, and received a [[default judgment]] against her when she failed to respond to the eviction, or appear in court on November 28, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.tmz.com/2006/11/29/court-orders-anna-nicole-to-scram/ |title=Court Orders Anna Nicole To Scram |publisher=tmz.com |last=Levin |first=Harvey |date=November 29, 2006 |accessdate=February 13, 2007| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070210114052/http://www.tmz.com/2006/11/29/court-orders-anna-nicole-to-scram/| archivedate= February 10 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford Shelley, son-in-law of G.

==Death and funeral==
On February 8, 2007, Smith was found unresponsive in room 607 at the [[Hard Rock Cafe#Seminole Tribe of Florida takeover|Seminole]] [[Hard Rock Cafe#Casinos and hotels|Hard Rock Hotel and Casino]] in [[Hollywood, Florida]]. Tasma Brighthaupt, a friend of Smith who was a trained emergency nurse, performed [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] for 15&amp;nbsp;minutes until her husband, Maurice &quot;Big Moe&quot; Brighthaupt, Smith's friend and bodyguard,&lt;ref name=ANS_Final_24&gt;''Final 24'' A&amp;E Biography Originally aired March 19, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; took over CPR. He had driven back to the hotel after being notified by his wife of Smith's condition.&lt;ref name=ANS_Final_24/&gt; According to Seminole Police Chief Charlie Tiger, at 1:38&amp;nbsp;pm (18:38 [[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]]) Maurice Brighthaupt, who was also a trained paramedic, called the hotel front desk from her sixth-floor room. The front desk in turn called security, who then called [[9-1-1|911]]. At 1:45&amp;nbsp;pm the bodyguard administered [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] until paramedics arrived and she was rushed to Memorial Regional Hospital at 2:10 p.m and pronounced [[dead on arrival]] at 2:49&amp;nbsp;pm

A phone call was released to the public on February 13, 2007, involving Seminole police and the local 911 operators, saying:

Retrieved on February 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;}}

After a seven-week investigation led by Broward County Medical Examiner and Forensic Pathologist Dr. [[Joshua Perper]] in combination with the Seminole police and several independent forensic pathologists and toxicologists, Dr. Perper announced that Smith died of &quot;[[Combined Drug Intoxication|combined drug intoxication]]&quot; with the sleeping medication [[chloral hydrate]] as the &quot;major component.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070326/ap_on_en_tv/anna_nicole_smith |title=Smith died from accidental drug overdose |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070331213201/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070326/ap_on_en_tv/anna_nicole_smith |archivedate=March 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; No illegal drugs were found in her system. The official report states that her death was not considered to be due to homicide, suicide, or natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/0326074report14.html Anna Nicole Smith Autopsy Released – March 26, 2007 pg. 14]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full investigative report has been made public and can be found online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/file/anna-nicole-smith-autopsy-released Anna Nicole Smith Autopsy Released – March 26, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, an official copy of the autopsy report was publicly released on March 26, 2007, and can be found online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/0326071anna1.html |title=Anna Nicole Smith Autopsy Released |publisher=Thesmokinggun.com |date=March 26, 2007 |accessdate=August 11, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100804233204/http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/0326071anna1.html| archivedate= August 04 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately her death was ruled an accidental drug overdose of the sedative [[chloral hydrate]] that became increasingly lethal when combined with other prescription drugs in her system, specifically four [[benzodiazepine]]s: Klonopin ([[Clonazepam]]), Ativan ([[Lorazepam]]), Serax ([[Oxazepam]]), and Valium ([[Diazepam]]). Furthermore, she had taken Benadryl ([[Diphenhydramine]]) and [[Topamax]] (Topiramate), an anticonvulsant AMPA/Kainate antagonist, which likely contributed to the sedative effect of chloral hydrate and the benzodiazepines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rxlist.com/cgi/generic/topiram_ad.htm Topamax Side Effects &amp; Drug Interactions]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the individual levels of any of the benzodiazepines in her system would not have been sufficient to cause death, their combination with a high dose of chloral hydrate led to her overdose. The autopsy report indicates that chloral hydrate was the &quot;toxic/lethal&quot; drug, but it is difficult to know if chloral hydrate ingestion alone would have killed her, since Dr. Perper indicated (in the March 26 press conference) that she had built up a tolerance to the drug and took more than the average person. He indicated that she took about three tablespoons, whereas the normal dosage is between one and two teaspoons. Chloral hydrate, first synthesized in 1832, was the first depressant developed for the specific purpose of inducing sleep. The infamous “Mickey Finn” or “knockout drops” was a solution of alcohol and chloral hydrate that was popular in Victorian England and in that era’s literature.  When used properly, and without the introduction of alcohol or other depressants, chloral hydrate is effective in easing sleeplessness due to pain or insomnia. But according to Avis (1990), the effective dose and lethal dose of chloral hydrate are so close that the sedative should be considered dangerous. Today, the use of chloral hydrate has declined as other agents, including barbiturates and benzodiazepines, have largely replaced them.&lt;ref&gt;Furek, Maxim W.

ISBN 978-0-595-46319-0&lt;/ref&gt; Despite rumors of methadone use due to its involvement in her son's death, Dr. Perper found only methadone in her [[bile]], indicating that it could only have been ingested 2–3 days prior to her death and was not a contributing factor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/0326074report12.html Anna Nicole Smith Autopsy Released – March 26, 2007 pg. 12]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The autopsy report indicates that abscesses on her buttocks (presumably from prior injections of vitamin B12 in the form of [[cyanocobalamin]], as well as [[human growth hormone]]), and viral [[enteritis]] were contributory causes of death. Tests for influenza A and B were negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Time Waster |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/0326071anna2.html |title=Anna Nicole Smith Autopsy Released – March&amp;nbsp;26, 2007 pg. 2 |publisher=Thesmokinggun.com |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that 8 of the 11 drugs in Smith's system, including the chloral hydrate, were prescribed to [[Howard K. Stern]], not Smith.  Additionally, two of the prescriptions were written for Alex Katz and one was written for Smith's friend and psychiatrist, Dr. Khristine Elaine  Eroshevich. Dr. Perper acknowledged that all 11 prescriptions were written by Dr. Eroshevich herself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2007/03/31/drugs-that-killed-anna-prescribed-to-howard-k-stern-others/ |title=Drugs That Killed Anna Prescribed to Howard K. Stern, others |publisher=Tmz.com |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Smith's body was buried, it began [[decomposition|decomposing]] at a faster-than-normal pace.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://uslaw.com/us_law_article.php?a=297 |title=Anna Nicole Smith's Legal Troubles |publisher=Uslaw.com |accessdate=August 11, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100813074853/http://www.uslaw.com/us_law_article.php?a=297| archivedate= August 13 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible factors in her more rapid decomposition were the drugs found in her body in the [[autopsy]], the fact that the legal battles delayed her [[embalming]] until over a week after her death, and the nearly month-long wait for her burial in the warm Bahama weather. This resulted in the family having a closed-casket funeral.

Smith's will, drawn up in April 2001, named her son Daniel as the sole beneficiary of her estate, specifically excluded other children, and named Howard K. Stern as the executor. It indicated personal property valued at $10,000 and real property valued at $1.8&amp;nbsp;million (with a $1.1&amp;nbsp;million mortgage) at the time of death. A petition to probate Smith's will was filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court. The petition to probate lists Larry Birkhead as a party with interest to Anna's estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2007/05/14/anna-nicole-smiths-will-officially-filed/ |title=Anna Nicole Smith's Will Officially Filed |publisher=Tmz.com |date=May 14, 2007 |accessdate=August 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A six-foot-long [[black granite]] monument was installed at Smith's grave in the Bahamas, in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.annanicolesmithmonument.com |title=Anna Nicole Smith Monument |publisher=Evans Monument Company |date=Dec. 10, 2008 |accessdate=August 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Playboy Playmate|Playmate]] News; ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine; March 2009; Page 114.&lt;/ref&gt;
