He is widely known as host of ''[[The Daily Show]]'', a [[news satire|satirical news program]] that airs on [[Comedy Central]].

Stewart started as a stand-up comedian, but branched into television as host of ''[[Short Attention Span Theater]]'' for Comedy Central. He went on to host his own show on [[MTV]], called ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'', and then hosted another show on MTV called ''[[You Wrote It, You Watch It]]''. He has also had several film roles as an actor. Stewart became the host of ''The Daily Show'' on Comedy Central in early 1999. He is also a writer and co-executive-producer of the show. After Stewart joined, ''The Daily Show'' steadily gained popularity and critical acclaim, resulting in his sixteen [[Emmy Awards]].

Stewart has gained acclaim as an acerbic, satirical critic of personality-driven media shows, in particular those of the [[US media]] networks such as [[CNN]], [[Fox News Channel]], and [[MSNBC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;awards&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Awards for Jon Stewart|publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0829537/awards|accessdate=April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics say Stewart benefits from a double standard: he critiques other news shows from the safe, removed position of his &quot;[[news satire|fake news]]&quot; desk.&lt;ref name=&quot;serious&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Tucker, Ken|title=You Can't Be Serious!|publisher=''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]''|date=November 1, 2004|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/arts/tv/10180/|accessdate=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN041015&quot;&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=April 23, 2008|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0410/15/cf.01.html|title=CNN CROSSFIRE|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart agrees, saying that neither his show nor his channel purports to be anything other than satire and comedy. In spite of its self-professed entertainment mandate, ''The Daily Show'' has been nominated for news and journalism [[List of awards won by The Daily Show|awards]]. Stewart hosted the [[78th Academy Awards|78th]] and [[80th Academy Awards]]. He is the co-author of ''[[America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction]]'', which was one of the best-selling books in the U.S. in 2004&lt;ref name=&quot;Top15books2004&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2004-12-20-top-books-of-2004_x.htm|publisher=[[USA Today]]|title=The top 100 selling books of 2004|date=December 20, 2004|accessdate=November 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Earth (The Book): A Visitor's Guide to the Human Race]]'' released in 2010.

==Early life==
Stewart was born '''Jonathan Stuart Leibowitz''' in [[New York City]], to a [[Jews|Jewish]] family. He and his older brother, Larry, who is currently [[Chief Operating Officer]] of [[NYSE Euronext]] (parent company of the [[New York Stock Exchange]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/05/11/nyse-executive-is-quizzed-about-his-brother-jon-stewart/|author=Fawn Johnson|title=NYSE Executive Is Quizzed — About His Brother, Jon Stewart|work=Washington Wire |publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=May 11, 2010|accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; grew up in [[Lawrenceville, New Jersey]], where they attended [[Lawrence High School (New Jersey)|Lawrence High School]].&lt;ref name=moment/&gt; Jon's mother, Marian (née Laskin), is an educational consultant and teacher.&lt;ref name=moment/&gt; His father, Donald, was a professor of physics at [[The College of New Jersey]] from 2001 through 2008; he now teaches an online course at [[Thomas Edison State College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcnjsignal.net/2009/09/15/no-joke-stewart%E2%80%99s-dad-taught-at-college/|title=No joke: Stewart’s dad taught at college|publisher=Tcnjsignal.net|date=September 15, 2009|accessdate=February 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jon's parents were divorced when Stewart was eleven years old, and Stewart no longer has any contact with his father.&lt;ref name=moment/&gt; According to Stewart, he was subjected to [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] [[bullying]] as a child.&lt;ref name=&quot;dowd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Maureen|last=Dowd|authorlink=Maureen Dowd|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/jon_stewart_stephen_colbert_americas_anchors/page/1|title=America's Anchors|publisher=Rolling Stone|date=November 16, 2006|accessdate=October 9, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061227192426/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/jon_stewart_stephen_colbert_americas_anchors/page/1|archivedate=December 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He describes himself in high school as &quot;very into [[Eugene V.

Stewart graduated in 1984 from [[The College of William &amp; Mary]] in [[Virginia]], where he played on the [[William &amp; Mary Tribe men's soccer|soccer]] team and initially majored in [[chemistry]] before switching to [[psychology]].&lt;ref name=moment/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|date=October 22, 2010|title=Bloomberg Game Changers: Jon Stewart|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/video/63932062/|medium=Television production |publisher=[[Bloomberg Television]]|accessdate=October 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at William &amp; Mary, Stewart became a brother of the [[Pi Kappa Alpha]] Fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pikes.org/ProminentPikes.aspx?mode=spage&amp;spid=53&amp;pid=3 |title=The Pi Kappa Alpha Fraternity |publisher=Pikes.org |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; After college, Stewart held numerous jobs; a contingency planner for the New Jersey Department of Human Services, a contract administrator for the [[City University of New York]], a puppeteer for children with disabilities, a caterer, a busboy, a shelf stocker at [[F. W. Woolworth Company|Woolworth's]], and a bartender at the Franklin Corner Tavern, a local blue-collar bar.&lt;ref name=moment/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mtv&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9804EFDC163DF930A25750C0A962958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=MTV Has a Hit With Words By Jon Stewart|publisher=New York Times|author=Gerston, Jill|date=March 13, 1994|accessdate=March 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oscar/&gt; In college, Stewart was friends with future Congressman [[Anthony Weiner]], who is the only politician to have received campaign donations from Stewart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jon Stewart Federal Campaign Contributions Report|publisher=Newsmeat|date=August 14, 2006| url=http://www.newsmeat.com/celebrity_political_donations/Jon_Stewart.php|accessdate=August 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early work===
With a reputation for being a funny man in school,&lt;ref name=moment/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mtv&quot;/&gt; Jon Stewart moved to [[New York City]] in 1986 to try his hand at the [[comedy club]] circuit, but he could not muster the courage to get on stage until the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/93_0527la.html|title=He Has Faith in His Jokes|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|author=McLellan, Dennis|date=May 27, 1993|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He made his [[stand-up comedy|stand-up]] debut at [[The Bitter End]], where his comedic idol, [[Woody Allen]], also began.&lt;ref name=&quot;cool&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Speidel, Maria|url= http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/94_0404people.html|title=Prince of Cool Air|publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]]|date= April 4, 1994|accessdate=May 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began using the [[stage name]] &quot;Jon Stewart&quot; by dropping his last name and changing the spelling of his middle name &quot;Stuart&quot; to &quot;Stewart.&quot; He often jokes this is because people had difficulty with the pronunciation of Leibowitz or it &quot;sounded too Hollywood&quot; (a reference to [[Lenny Bruce]]'s joke on the same theme).&lt;ref name=&quot;record&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/94_0000record.html|title=Nighttime Talk, MTV Style|publisher=''[[The Record (Bergen County)|The Record]]''|author=Howard, Susan|year=1994|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has implied that the name change was actually due to a strained relationship with his father, with whom Stewart no longer has any contact.&lt;ref name=oscar&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2006/feb/26/broadcasting.oscars2006|title=The Oscar for best satirist goes to ...|publisher=The Observer|date=February 26, 2006|author=Harris, Paul|accessdate=October 21, 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart became a regular at the [[Comedy Cellar]], where he was the last performer every night. For two years, he would perform at 2 a.m. while developing his comedic style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Jon Stewart|episodelink=Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg|series=Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg|serieslink=Sit Down Comedy with David Steinberg|network=[[TV Land]]|airdate=March 14, 2007|season=2|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1989 Stewart landed his first television job as a writer for ''[[Caroline's Comedy Hour]]''. In 1991 he began co-hosting Comedy Central's ''[[Short Attention Span Theater]]'', with Patty Rosborough. In 1992 Stewart hosted the short-lived ''[[You Wrote It, You Watch It]]'' on MTV, which invited viewers to send in their stories to be acted out by the comedy troupe, [[The State (TV series)|The State]]. When [[David Letterman]] left NBC in 1993, Stewart was a finalist to replace him, but [[Conan O'Brien]] was hired instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;record&quot;/&gt;

===''The Jon Stewart Show''===
Later in 1993, Stewart developed ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'', a [[talk show]] on MTV. ''The Jon Stewart Show'' was the first talk show on that network and was an instant hit, becoming the second-highest rated MTV show behind ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/jonstewartshow/jontvguide.htm|title=New York's Mr. Schmooze|author=Kaplan, Michael|work=[[TV Guide]]|date=February 19, 1994|accessdate=June 21, 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/jonstewartshow/jontvguide.htm&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:00:29|archivedate=October 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]] cancelled ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]'' and, with new corporate sibling MTV (through MTV parent [[Viacom]]'s acquisition of the studio), launched an hour-long [[television syndication|syndicated]] late-night version of ''The Jon Stewart Show''. Many local affiliates had moved Hall's show to 2 a.m. during its decline and Stewart's show inherited such early morning time slots in many cities. Ratings were dismal and the show was canceled in June 1995.

Amongst the fans of the show was David Letterman, who was the final guest of ''The Jon Stewart Show''. Letterman signed Stewart with his production company, [[Worldwide Pants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/96_0696plaindealer.html|title=Comic Stewart Set to Head CBS Talker|work=[[The Plain Dealer]]|date=June 6, 1996|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart then became a frequent guest host for [[Tom Snyder]] on ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show with Tom Snyder]]'', which was produced by Letterman and aired after the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|Late Show]]'' on [[CBS]]. This led to much speculation that Stewart would soon replace Snyder permanently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/96_1001usatoday.html|title=Stewart to Sub&amp;nbsp;– Not Take Over&amp;nbsp;– for Snyder|publisher=USA Today|author=Johnson, Peter|date=October 1, 1996|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Stewart was instead offered the time slot after Snyder, which he turned down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/97_1125nypost.html|title=What's the Deal With Stewart?|publisher=[[New York Post]]|author=Adaliang, Josef|date=November 25, 1997|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Daily Show''===
{{Main|The Daily Show}}
In 1999 Stewart began hosting ''The Daily Show'' on Comedy Central when [[Craig Kilborn]] left the show to replace [[Tom Snyder]] on ''[[The Late Late Show (CBS TV series)|The Late Late Show]]''. The show, which has been popular and successful in cable television since Stewart became the host, blends humor with the day's top news stories, usually in politics, while simultaneously poking fun at politicians and many newsmakers as well as the news media itself. In an interview on ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', Stewart denied the show has any intentional political agenda, saying the goal was &quot;schnicks and giggles.&quot; &quot;The same weakness that drove me into comedy also informs my show,&quot; meaning that he was uncomfortable talking without hearing the audience laugh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 23, 2008|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5pK7sK0i4A|title=Jon Stewart on The O'Reilly Factor|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart has since hosted almost all airings of the program, except for a few occasions when correspondents such as [[Stephen Colbert]], [[Rob Corddry]], and [[Steve Carell]] subbed for him. Stewart has won a total of sixteen [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] for ''The Daily Show'' as either a writer or producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;awards&quot;/&gt; In 2005 ''The Daily Show'' and Jon Stewart received a [[Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album|Best Comedy Album]] [[Grammy Award]] for the audio book edition of ''[[America (The Book)]]''. In 2000 and 2004, the show won two [[Peabody Award]]s for its coverage of the presidential elections relevant to those years, called &quot;[[The Daily Show: Indecision 2000|Indecision 2000]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Daily Show: Indecision 2004|Indecision 2004]]&quot;, respectively.

The September 20, 2001, show the first show after the [[attacks of September 11, 2001]], began with no introduction.&lt;ref name=&quot;DS091101&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=105095&amp;title=september-11,-2001|title=The Daily Show of September&amp;nbsp;20, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before this, the introduction included footage of a fly-in towards the [[World Trade Center]] and New York City. The first nine minutes of the show included a tearful Stewart discussing his personal view on the event. His remarks ended as follows:
:&quot;The view… from my apartment… was the World Trade Center… and now it's gone, and they attacked it. This symbol of American ingenuity, and strength, and labor, and imagination and commerce, and it is gone. But you know what the view is now? The [[Statue of Liberty]]. The view from the [[Lower Manhattan|South of Manhattan]] is now the Statue of Liberty. You can't beat that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DS091101&quot;/&gt;

On April 4, 2006, Stewart confronted [[US Senator]] [[John McCain]] about his decision to appear at [[Liberty University]], an institution founded by [[Jerry Falwell]], whom McCain had previously denounced as one of the &quot;agents of intolerance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Politics/story?id=1843506|title=Making Right Turn, McCain Embraces Falwell|publisher=[[ABC News]]|date=April 14, 2006|accessdate=October 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lincmad.blogspot.com/2006/04/john-mccain-on-daily-show.html|title=John McCain on The Daily Show|accessdate=July 26, 2006|last=Madison|first=Lincoln|date=April 5, 2006|work=The Third Path|publisher=Blogspot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the interchange, Stewart asked McCain, &quot;You're not freaking out on us? Are you freaking out on us, because if you're freaking out and you're going into the crazy [[Base (politics)|base]] world—are you going into crazy base world?&quot; McCain replied, &quot;I'm afraid so.&quot; The clip was played on CNN and created a surge of articles across the [[blogosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Candy Crowley]]|coauthor=[[Wolf Blitzer]]|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0605/15/sitroom.01.html|title=Transcripts: The Situation Room|work=[[The Situation Room]]|publisher=CNN|date=March 15, 2006|accessdate=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 4, 2006|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=115528&amp;title=john-mccain|title=John McCain on The Daily Show|publisher=[[Comedy Central]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 ''The Daily Show'' was involved in former correspondent [[Stephen Colbert presidential campaign, 2008|Stephen Colbert's announcement that he would run for president in 2008]]. In 2008 Stewart appeared on an episode of the show ''[[Democracy Now!]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2008/9/1/jon_stewart_of_the_daily_show|title=&quot;Jon Stewart of &quot;The Daily Show&quot; Weighs in on Sarah Palin, Hurricane Gustav and the Media’s Coverage of the Conventions&quot;|date=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' story questioned whether he was, in a phrase originally used to describe longtime network news anchor [[Walter Cronkite]], &quot;the most trusted man in America&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/17/arts/television/17kaku.html|work=The New York Times|title=Is Jon Stewart the Most Trusted Man in America?|date=August 15, 2008|first=Michiko|last=Kakutani}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, 2009, during a discussion on [[torture]] with [[Clifford May]], Stewart expressed his opinion that former President [[Harry S. Truman]] was a [[war crimes|war criminal]] for his [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use of the atomic bomb on Japan during World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;newsbusters1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheppard|first=Noel|url=http://newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sheppard/2009/04/30/stewart-trumans-war-criminal-bombing-hiroshima|title=Jon Stewart: Truman's a War Criminal for Bombing Hiroshima|publisher=NewsBusters.org|date=April 30, 2009|accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theweek.com/article/index/96152/Jon_Stewarts_apology_to_Harry_Truman|title=Jon Stewart's apology to Harry Truman|publisher=The Week|accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/dennis-perrin/why-did-jon-stewart-apolo_b_195147.html|title=Dennis Perrin: Why Did Jon Stewart Apologize?|publisher=Huffingtonpost.com|date=May 3, 2009|accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moments later, Stewart defended his assertion:
:Here's what I think of the [[atom bomb]]s. I think if you dropped an atom bomb fifteen miles offshore and you said, &quot;The next one's coming and hitting you,&quot; then I would think it's okay. To drop it on a city, and kill a hundred thousand people. Yeah. I think that's criminal.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsbusters1&quot;/&gt;

On April 30, 2009, Stewart apologized on his program, and stated he did not believe Truman was a war criminal:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sheppard|first=Noel|url=http://newsbusters.org/blogs/noel-sheppard/2009/05/01/jon-stewart-apologizes-calling-truman-war-criminal|title=Jon Stewart Apologizes For Calling Truman a War Criminal|publisher=NewsBusters.org|date=October 29, 2009|accessdate=September 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:The other night we had on Cliff May. He was on, we were discussing torture, back and forth, very spirited discussion, very enjoyable. And I may have mentioned during the discussion we were having that Harry Truman was a war criminal. And right after saying it, I thought to myself that was dumb. And it was dumb. Stupid in fact. So I shouldn't have said that, and I did. So I say right now, no, I don't believe that to be the case. The atomic bomb, a very complicated decision in the context of a horrific war, and I walk that back because it was in my estimation a stupid thing to say. Which, by the way, as it was coming out of your mouth, you ever do that, where you're saying something, and as it's coming out you're like, &quot;What the fuck, nyah?&quot; And it just sat in there for a couple of days, just sitting going, &quot;No, no, he wasn't, and you should really say that out loud on the show.&quot; So I am, right now, and, man, ew.

In April 2010, Comedy Central renewed Stewart's contract to host ''The Daily Show'' into 2013.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stelter&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/arts/television/24stewart.html?scp=2&amp;sq=jon%20stewart&amp;st=cse|title=Jon Stewart’s Punching Bag, Fox News|last=Stelter|first=Brian|date=April 23, 2010|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Stewart is paid a reported $1.5 million for one season of ''The Daily Show''.&lt;ref name=salary&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 23, 2008|url=http://nymag.com/guides/salary/14497/index1.html|title=Who Makes How Much|publisher=[[New York magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to the [[Forbes]] list of Celebrities, he earns $14 million a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=July 22, 2008|url=http://www.forbes.com/lists/2008/53/celebrities08_Jon-Stewart_JZY4.html|title=The Celebrity 100|publisher=[[Forbes.com]]|date=June 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, 2010, Stewart and [[Stephen Colbert]] announced a rally for October 30, known as the [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]]. It took place on the [[National Mall]] in [[Washington D.C.]] and attracted an estimated 215,000 participants.&lt;ref name=cbs-rally&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20021284-503544.html|work=CBS News|title=Jon Stewart Rally Attracts Estimated 215,000|first=Brian|last=Montopoli|date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010 Stewart was credited by the [[White House]] and other media and political news outlets for bringing awareness of the Republican [[filibuster]] on the [[James Zadroga]] 9/11 Health and Compensation Act to the public, leading to the ultimate passing of the bill which provides health benefits to first responders whose health has been adversely affected by their work at [[Ground Zero]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs-zadroga&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20026333-503544.html|title=White House Lauds Jon Stewart for Pushing Passage of 9/11 Health Bill|last=Madison|first=Lucy|date=December 24, 2010|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the January 10, 2011 show, Stewart began with a monologue about the [[2011 Tucson shooting|shootings in Tucson, AZ]].&lt;ref&gt;Snyder, Steven James [http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2011/01/11/the-night-shift-jon-stewart-confronts-the-arizona-shootings-makes-a-passionate-appeal-for-sanity-and-hope/ &quot;The Night Shift: Jon Stewart Confronts the Arizona Shootings, Makes a Passionate Appeal For Sanity and Hope&quot;], TIME Magazine Online.

Retrieved February 18, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Before commercial break, Stewart told viewers that the show would continue as usual the next night. After commercial break, the show featured a rerun of a field piece done by Jason Jones two years earlier.

As a result of such high-profile political stands, Stewart is being recognized as a political force rather than merely as a comedian. ''[[The New York Times]]'' suggested that he is &quot;the modern-day equivalent of [[Edward R. Murrow]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTMurrow&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/27/business/media/27stewart.html?_r=1&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=jon%20stewart&amp;st=cse|title=NEWS ANALYSIS; Jon Stewart’s Advocacy Role in 9/11 Bill Passage|last=Carter|first=Bill|coauthor=Brian Stelter|date=December 27, 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=December 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the UK national newspaper ''[[The Independent]]'' called him the &quot;satirist-in-chief&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ind1230&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/news/the-serious-side-of-jon-stewart-2171794.html|title=The serious side of Jon Stewart|last=Adams|first=Guy|date=December 30, 2010|work=The Independent|accessdate=December 30, 2010|location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the middle of 2002, amid rumors that [[David Letterman]] was going to switch from CBS to ABC when his contract ran out, Stewart was rumored as Letterman's replacement on CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hiatt|first=Brian|title=David Letterman will stay at CBS|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,216668,00.html|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=March 11, 2002|accessdate=March 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Letterman renewed his contract with CBS. On the March 9, 2002, episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', hosted by Stewart, a &quot;[[Weekend Update]]&quot; sketch poked fun at the situation. In the middle of the sketch, &quot;Weekend Update&quot; anchor [[Jimmy Fallon]] said that he could not continue doing the broadcast and he brought Stewart in to replace him. Stewart glowed with excitement and chattered to himself about this chance to prove himself on network television. His pep talk went on too long, however, and before Stewart could deliver any headlines, Fallon returned and said he would be able to finish the broadcast himself.

In late 2002, ABC offered Stewart his own talk show to air after ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]].'' Stewart's contract with ''The Daily Show'' was near expiring and he expressed strong interest. ABC, however, decided to give another Comedy Central figure, [[Jimmy Kimmel]], the post-''Nightline'' slot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Carter, Bill|url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/2002/02_1103nytimes.html|title=In the Land of the Insomniac, the Narcoleptic Wants to Be King|work=The New York Times|date=November 3, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books===
[[File:Jon Stewart Earth book 2 Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Stewart at the launch of his book, ''[[Earth (The Book)|Earth]]'', in New York, September 27, 2010.]]In 1998, Stewart released his first book, ''[[Naked Pictures of Famous People]]'', a collection of humorous short stories and essays. The book reached [[The New York Times Best Seller List|''The New York Times'' Best Seller List]].

In 2004 Stewart and ''The Daily Show'' writing staff released ''[[America (The Book): A Citizen's Guide to Democracy Inaction]],'' a mock [[high school]] [[History]] [[textbook]] offering insights into the unique American system of government, dissecting its institutions, explaining its history and processes, and satirizing such popular American political precepts as &quot;[[one man, one vote]]&quot;, &quot;government by the people,&quot; and &quot;every vote counts.&quot; The book sold millions of copies upon its 2004 release and ended the year as a top fifteen best-seller.&lt;ref name=&quot;Top15books2004&quot;/&gt;

In 2005 Stewart provided the voice of President [[James A. Garfield]] for the audiobook version of [[Sarah Vowell]]'s ''[[Assassination Vacation]]''.

In 2007 Stewart voiced a role on [[Stephen Colbert]]'s audiobook version of ''[[I Am America (And So Can You!)]]''. He plays Mort Sinclaire, former TV comedy writer and Communist.

On September 21, 2010, ''[[Earth (The Book): A Visitor's Guide to the Human Race]]'', written by Stewart and other writers of ''The Daily Show'', was released.

===Acting===
Although best known for his work on ''[[The Daily Show]],'' Stewart has had roles in several [[films]] and [[television series]].

His first film role was a minor part in ''[[The First Wives Club]]'' but his [[deleted scene|scene was deleted]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jon.happyjoyfun.net/tran/1990/96_0827usatoday.html|title=Out of the Club|publisher=USA Today|author=Vigoda, Arlene;Susan Wloszczyna|date=August 27, 1996|accessdate=June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 Stewart signed a three-year deal with [[Miramax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,299594,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|title=Monitor|date=November 17, 1995|accessdate=March 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played romantic leads in the films ''[[Playing by Heart]]'' and ''[[Wishful Thinking (1997 film)|Wishful Thinking]]''. He had a supporting role in the romantic comedy ''[[Since You've Been Gone (film)|Since You've Been Gone]]'' and in the horror film ''[[The Faculty]]''. Other films were planned for Stewart to write and star in, but they were never produced. Stewart has since maintained a relationship with Miramax founders [[Harvey Weinstein|Harvey]] and [[Bob Weinstein]] and continues to appear in films they have produced including ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'', ''[[Doogal]]'' and the documentary ''[[Wordplay (film)|Wordplay]]''.

He appeared in ''[[Half Baked]]'' as an &quot;enhancement smoker&quot; and in ''[[Big Daddy (1999 film)|Big Daddy]]'' as [[Adam Sandler]]'s roommate; he has joked on the ''Daily Show'' and in the documentary ''[[The Aristocrats (film)|The Aristocrats]]'' that to get the role he slept with Sandler. Stewart often makes fun of his appearances in the high-profile [[Box office bomb|flop]] ''[[Death to Smoochy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-02-19-jon-stewart_x.htm?POE=LIFISVA|title=Jon Stewart looks Oscar in the eye|publisher=USA Today|author=Levin, Gary|date=February 19, 2006|accessdate=June 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he played a treacherous television executive, and the animated film ''[[Doogal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/27/lkl.01.html|title=CNN Larry King Live: Interview With Jon Stewart|work=[[Larry King Live]]|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|date=February 27, 2006|accessdate=June 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he played a blue [[Spring (device)|spring]] named Zeebad who shot a freeze ray from his mustache. In 2007 Stewart made a [[cameo appearance]] as himself in ''[[Evan Almighty]]'', which starred former ''Daily Show'' correspondent [[Steve Carell]]. In the movie Stewart was seen on a television screen in a fictional ''Daily Show'' episode poking fun at Carell's character for building an [[Noah's Ark|ark]].

Stewart had a recurring role in ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'', playing himself as an occasional substitute and possible successor to late-night talk show host [[List of characters on The Larry Sanders Show#Larry Sanders|Larry Sanders]] (played by [[Garry Shandling]]). In 1998 Stewart hosted the television special, ''[[Elmopalooza]]'', celebrating 30 years of ''[[Sesame Street]]''. He has guest-starred on other sitcoms including ''[[The Nanny (TV series)|The Nanny]]'', ''[[Dr Katz, Professional Therapist]]'', ''[[Spin City]]'', ''[[NewsRadio]]'', ''[[American Dad]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons]]''. He has made guest-appearances on the [[children's television series]] ''[[Between the Lions]]'', ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[Jack's Big Music Show]]''.

===Producing===
In the mid-1990s Stewart launched his own [[production company]], [[Busboy Productions]]. The name of the company is a reference to Stewart's previous job as a [[busboy]]. The company's [[production logo]] features the sound of a glass being knocked over followed by a voice whispering &quot;Oops. Sorry.&quot; Stewart signed a deal with [[Miramax]] to develop projects through his company, but none of his ideas has been produced to date. After Stewart's success as host and producer of ''The Daily Show'', he revived Busboy Productions with ''Daily Show'' producers [[Ben Karlin]] and Rich Korson. In 2002 Busboy planned to produce a [[sitcom]] for NBC starring Stephen Colbert, but the show did not come to fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jon Stewart: TV Mogul|publisher=[[E! Online]]|date=February 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 Comedy Central reached an agreement with Busboy in which Comedy Central would provide financial backing for the production company. Comedy Central has a first-look agreement on all projects, after which Busboy is free to shop them to other networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/business-services-miscellaneous-business/4762101-1.html|title=Comedy Inks Deal with Stewart's Busboy|author=Larson, Megan|publisher=[[Adweek]]|date=February 18, 2005|accessdate=October 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2005/feb/16/entertainment/et-stewart16|title=Jon Stewart, Comedy Central Sign Deal|author=Boucher, Geoff|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|date=February 18, 2005|accessdate=October 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deal spawned the ''Daily Show'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[The Colbert Report]]''. Other projects include the sitcom [[television pilot|pilot]] ''[[Three Strikes (Show)|Three Strikes]]'', the [[documentary film|documentary]] ''Sportsfan'', the series ''[[Important Things with Demetri Martin]]'', and the film ''[[The Donor]]''.

In March 2010 Stewart announced that he had optioned rights to the story of journalist [[Maziar Bahari]], who was imprisoned in [[Iran]] for 118 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/optioned-stories-jon-stewart-buys-a-journalists-tale-don-murphy-takes-cory-doctorows-latest-novel/|title=Optioned Stories: Jon Stewart Buys a Journalist’s Tale; Don Murphy Takes Cory Doctorow’s Latest Novel|accessdate=2011-06-08|publisher=Slashfilm}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the June 6, 2011 episode of The Daily Show, Stewart again hosted Bahari and confirmed that the two would be collaborating on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/jon-stewart-announces-intent-produce-film-jailed-iranian-filmmaker-maziar-bahari/|title=Jon Stewart Announces Intent to Produce a Film About Jailed Iranian Journalist Maziar Bahari|accessdate=2011-06-08|publisher=Slashfilm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards show hosting===
Stewart has hosted the [[Grammy Award]]s twice, in 2001 and in 2002. In the middle of the 2001 broadcast, after laying a number of comedic duds, Stewart did what he encourages most public officials to do: he recognized his lackluster performance, saying, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I just want to say I feel your scorn and accept it.&quot; When Stewart returned to host the next year, his comedy was more successful. Joking about the performance of the song &quot;[[Lady Marmalade]]&quot;, he said, &quot;Our next performance is from the movie ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'', a film about a time when the whorehouses were about the music!&quot; When the award winners for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] walked up on stage, many in number, Stewart quipped, &quot;I don't know what you may have heard, but you were only supposed to go on stage if you worked on the ''[[O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]'' [[O Brother, Where Art Thou? (soundtrack)|soundtrack]], not if you heard it.&quot;

On January 5, 2006, Stewart was officially announced as the host of the [[78th Academy Awards]], which were held March 5 at the [[Kodak Theatre]] in [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]]. Responding to press questions at the time of his selection, Stewart remarked: &quot;As a performer, I'm truly honored to be hosting the show. Although, as an avid watcher of the Oscars, I can't help but be a little disappointed with the choice. It appears to be another sad attempt to smoke out [[Billy Crystal]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Jon Stewart to Host Oscars|publisher=CBS|date=January 5, 2006|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/01/05/entertainment/main1180403.shtml|accessdate=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; (According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', Oscar producer [[Gilbert Cates]] knew that Crystal was going to be performing ''700 Sundays'' during the time period and was not able to host.) On the Monday before the Oscars, Stewart told [[Larry King]] that he was more &quot;excited&quot; than nervous about the job and joked that if he turned out a failure, he could be &quot;bumped down to [[Public-access television|public access]]&quot;. When asked what the opening would be, the comedian chastised himself by comparing a Stewart opening to a &quot;[[Gene Rayburn]] homage&quot;. Instead, the opening segment, preceding Stewart's monologue, featured several recent hosts &quot;declining&quot; to host the show.

Critical response to Stewart's performance was mixed. [[Roger Ebert]] compared him favorably to legendary Oscar host [[Johnny Carson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060305/OSCARS/60306001|author=Ebert, Roger|title='Crash'-ing a joyous Oscar party|publisher=[http://www.rogerebert.com/ RogerEbert.com]|date=March 5, 2006|accessdate=May 7, 2007|authorlink= Roger Ebert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reviewers were less positive; [[Tom Shales]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said that Stewart hosted with “smug humorlessness.” James Poniewozik of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' said that Stewart was a bad host, but a great “anti-host” in that he poked fun at parts of the broadcast that deserved it, which lent him a degree of authenticity with the non-[[Hollywood]] audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poniewozik|first=James|title=Jon Stewart vs. The Oscars|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=March 6, 2006|url=http://www.time-blog.com/tuned_in/2006/03/jon_stewart_vs_the_oscars.html|accessdate=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart and correspondent [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] later poked fun at his lackluster reception on ''The Daily Show''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s coverage of the [[79th Academy Awards]] by saying that the &quot;[[demon]] of last year's Oscars had finally been [[exorcism|exorcised]].&quot;

Stewart also hosted the [[80th Academy Awards]] on February 24, 2008. Reception that time, however, was far more positive.

==Criticism of journalists==

===''Crossfire'' appearance===
In a televised exchange with then-CNN personality [[Tucker Carlson]] on ''[[Crossfire (TV series)|Crossfire]]'' on October 15, 2004, Stewart criticized the state of television journalism and pleaded with the show's hosts to &quot;stop hurting America&quot;, and referred to both Carlson and co-host [[Paul Begala]] as &quot;[[Partisan (political)|partisan]] [[hack writer|hacks]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Jon Stewart, Tucker Carlson|title=[[Crossfire (TV series)|Crossfire]]|medium=Television|publisher=CNN|location=[http://video.google.ca/videoplay?docid=889968848656043401&amp;q=jon+stewart GoogleVideo's mirror of the clip]|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; When posted on the internet, this exchange became widely viewed and was a topic of much media discussion.

Despite being on the program to comment on current events, Stewart immediately shifted the discussion toward the show itself, asserting that ''Crossfire'' had failed in its responsibility to inform and educate viewers about politics as a serious topic. Stewart stated that the show engaged in partisan hackery instead of honest debate, and said that the hosts' assertion that ''Crossfire'' is a debate show is like &quot;saying [[professional wrestling|pro wrestling]] is a show about athletic competition.&quot; Carlson responded by saying that Stewart criticizes news organizations for not holding public officials accountable, but when he interviewed [[John Kerry]], Stewart asked a series of &quot;softball&quot; questions (Stewart has acknowledged he voted for Kerry in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/story/2008/08/25/ST2008082503384.html|title=No Joke: Jon Stewart Takes Aim At 24-Hour Cable News 'Beast'|publisher=washingtonpost.com |date=August 25, 2008|accessdate=September 17, 2010|first=Howard|last=Kurtz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart responded that he didn't realize &quot;the news organizations look to ''Comedy Central'' for their cues on integrity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediamatters.org/items/200410160003|title=Jon Stewart on Crossfire: &quot;Stop, stop, stop, stop hurting America.&quot;|date=October 15, 2004|publisher=Media Matters}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Carlson continued to press Stewart on the Kerry issue, Stewart said, &quot;You're on CNN! The show that leads into me is [[Crank Yankers|puppets making crank phone calls]]! What is wrong with you?&quot; In response to prods from Carlson, &quot;Come on. Be funny,&quot; Stewart said, &quot;No, I'm not going to be your monkey.&quot; Later in the show when Carlson jibed, &quot;I do think you're more fun on your show,&quot; Stewart retorted, &quot;You're as big a dick on your show as you are on any show.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN041015&quot; /&gt; In response to Stewart's criticisms, Carlson said, &quot;You need to teach at a journalism school,&quot; to which Stewart responded, &quot;You need to go to one!&quot; 

Stewart discussed the incident on ''The Daily Show'' the following Monday:
:We decided to go to this place, ''Crossfire'', which is a ''nuanced'' public policy analysis show… named after [[Crossfire#&quot;Caught in the crossfire&quot;|the stray bullets that hit innocent bystanders in a gang fight]]. So I go to ''Crossfire'' and, let's face it, I was [[dehydrated]], it's the [[Martin Lawrence]] defense… and I had always in the past mentioned to friends and people that I meet on the street that I think that show… um… blows. So I thought it was only the right thing to do to go say it to them personally on their program, but here's the thing about confronting someone with that on their show: They're ''there!'' Un''com''fortable! And they were very mad, because apparently, when you invite someone on a show called ''Crossfire'' and you express an opinion, they don't care for that… I told them that I felt their show was hurting America and they came back at me pretty good, they said that I wasn't being funny. And I said to them, &quot;I know that, but tomorrow I will go back to being funny, and your show will still blow.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;serious&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stewart, Jon|title=Your Show Blows|publisher=Comedy Central|date=October 18, 2004|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=120614&amp;title=your-show-blows|accessdate=April 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2005 CNN announced that it was canceling ''Crossfire''. When asked about the cancellations, CNN/US' incoming president, [[Jonathan Klein (CNN)|Jonathan Klein]], referenced Stewart's appearance on the show: &quot;I think he made a good point about the noise level of these types of shows, which does nothing to illuminate the issues of the day.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Howard Kurtz]]|title=Carlson &amp; 'Crossfire,' Exit Stage Left &amp; Right|publisher=Washington Post|date=January 6, 2004|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52274-2005Jan6.html|accessdate=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, Stewart quipped on ''The Daily Show'' that &quot;[[I Fought the Law|I fought the law, and the law lost!]]&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

When asked about his relationship with Tucker Carlson on CNN's ''Larry King Live'' in February 2008, Stewart said: &quot;It became this idea that it was personal between the two of us, and it wasn't… If there's one thing I regret about that thing, it was probably the idea that it was personal, that there was something I was saying about Tucker to Tucker, but actually it was about the show.&quot;

On March 18, 2009, Carlson wrote a blog entry for ''The Daily Beast'' criticizing Stewart for his handling of the CNBC controversy (see below). Carlson discussed the CNN incident and claimed that Stewart remained backstage for at least &quot;an hour&quot; and &quot;continued to lecture our staff&quot;, something Carlson described as &quot;one of the weirdest things I have ever seen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Tucker|last=Carlson|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2009-03-18/how-jon-stewart-went-bad|title=How Jon Stewart Went Bad|date=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of CNBC===
{{Main|Jon Stewart's 2009 criticism of CNBC}}
Stewart again became a [[Viral phenomenon|viral internet phenomenon]] following a March 4, 2009, ''The Daily Show'' sequence. CNBC cancelled [[Rick Santelli]]'s scheduled appearance but Stewart still ran a short segment showing CNBC giving bad investment advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Jason Linkins]]|title=Jon Stewart Eviscerates CNBC, Santelli On Daily Show|publisher=The Huffington Post|date=March 5, 2009|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/05/jon-stewart-eviscerates-c_n_172057.html|accessdate=March 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent media coverage of exchanges between [[Jim Cramer]], who had been featured heavily in the original segment, and Stewart, led to a highly anticipated face-to-face confrontation on ''The Daily Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Matea Gold|title=Exclusive: Jim Cramer set to appear on ''The Daily Show'' Thursday|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=March 10, 2009|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2009/03/exclusive-jim-c.html|accessdate=March 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The episode received much media attention and became the second most-viewed episode of ''The Daily Show'', trailing only the 2009 Inauguration Day episode. It had 2.3 million total viewers, and the next day, the show's website saw its highest day of traffic in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jon Lafayette|title=Stewart-Cramer Confrontation Draws ‘Daily’s’ Second-Biggest Audience of ’09|publisher=TVWeek.com|date=March 13, 2009|url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2009/03/stewartcramer_confrontation_dr.php|accessdate=March 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Cramer acknowledged on the show that some of Stewart's criticisms of CNBC were valid and that the network could &quot;do better,&quot; he later said on ''[[The Today Show]]'' that Stewart's criticism of the media was &quot;naïve and misleading.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|last=Calderon|first=Michael|title=Cramer slams Stewart: 'naive and misleading'|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0309/Cramer_slams_Stewart_naive_and_misleading.html|publisher=[[The Politico]]|date=March 19, 2009|accessdate=March 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism of Fox News===
For years Stewart has accused [[Fox News]] of distorting the news to fit a conservative agenda, at one point ridiculing the network as &quot;the meanest [[sorority]] in the world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Huffington Post&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/03/12/stewart-fox-news-is-the-m_n_496403.html|title=Stewart: Fox News Is The Meanest Sorority In The World|date=March 12, 2010|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=April 25, 2010|first=Dan|last=Abramson}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2009 Stewart called out Fox News for using some footage from a previous [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] rally during its report of a more recent one, making the later rally appear larger than it was. The show's anchor, [[Sean Hannity]], apologized the following night.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hong&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/thebigblog/archives/184866.asp|title=Video Fix: Jon Stewart catches Fox News using wrong footage|last=Hong|first=Sharon|date=November 11, 2009|publisher=Seattle PI|accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, Stewart criticized ''[[Fox &amp; Friends]]'' cohost [[Gretchen Carlson]]&amp;nbsp;– a former [[Miss America]] and [[Stanford]] graduate&amp;nbsp;– for claiming that she [[google]]d words such as &quot;ignoramus&quot; and &quot;czar&quot;. Stewart said that Carlson was dumbing herself down for &quot;an audience who sees intellect as an [[cultural elitism|elitist]] flaw&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlson episode&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-december-8-2009/gretchen-carlson-dumbs-down|date=December 8, 2009|work=The Daily Show|publisher=Comedy Central|accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart stepped up his criticism of Fox News in 2010; as of April 24, ''The Daily Show'' had 24 segments criticizing Fox News' coverage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stelter&quot;/&gt; [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], host of ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', countered that ''The Daily Show'' was a &quot;key component of [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] television&quot; and that Stewart was a fan of Fox News because the network was so interesting to watch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stelter&quot;/&gt;

On an interview with [[Chris Wallace]] on June 19, 2011, Stewart called Wallace &quot;insane&quot; after Wallace claimed that Stewart's earlier comparison of a Sarah Palin campaign video and an anti-herpes medicine ad was a political comment. Stewart also claimed Fox viewers to be the &quot;most consistently misinformed&quot; viewers of political media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/06/19/jon-stewart-fox-news-sunday-video_n_879964.html |title=Jon Stewart LIVE On Fox News, Tells Host 'You're Insane' (VIDEO) [UPDATE&amp;#93; |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 2012, he debated political commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] in [[The Rumble in the Air-Conditioned Auditorium]].

==WGA strike of 2007–2008==
Stewart was an important factor in the unionization of the Comedy Central writers. ''The Daily Show'' writers were the first of Comedy Central's writers to be able to join the guild, after which other shows followed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 23, 2008|url=http://www.wga.org/subpage_newsevents.aspx?id=2387|title=Comedy Central Writers Win WGA Contract|publisher=[[Writers Guild of America|WGA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=April 23, 2008|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/legal-services/4465402-1.html|title=Union Deal for 'Daily Show' Writers|publisher=[[AllBusiness.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart supported the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]], commenting on ''The Daily Show'' episode just before the strike in a sarcastic manner about how Comedy Central had made available all of the episodes for free on their website, but without advertising, and said 'go support our advertisers'. The show went on hiatus when the strike began, as did other late night talk shows. Upon Stewart's return to the show on January 7, 2008, he refused to use the title ''The Daily Show'', stating that &quot;The Daily Show&quot; was the show made with all of the people responsible for the broadcast, including his writers. During the strike, he referred to his show as '''''A''' Daily Show with Jon Stewart'' until the strike ended on February 13, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=April 23, 2008|url=http://weblogs.variety.com/wga_strike_blog/2008/02/wgas-press-rele.html|title=WGA's Press Release|publisher=[[Variety magazine]]|deadurl=yes}}{{Dead link|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stewart, as well as several other late night talk shows, returned to TV early in January even though the strike was not over, because their stage crews and production teams were suffering much more than the writers from the financial crunch, and by that point had been out of work for two months.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The Writers Guild Strike of 2007–2008 was also responsible for a notable mock [[The Colbert/O'Brien/Stewart feud|feud]] between Stewart, [[Stephen Colbert]], and [[Conan O'Brien]] in early 2008. Without writers to help fuel their banter, the three comedians concocted a [[fictional crossover|crossover]]/rivalry in order to garner more viewers during the ratings slump. Colbert made the claim that because of &quot;the Colbert bump&quot;, he was responsible for [[Mike Huckabee|Mike Huckabee's]] success in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential race]]. O'Brien claimed that he was responsible for Huckabee's success because not only had he mentioned Huckabee on his show, but also that he was responsible for [[Chuck Norris]]' success (Norris backed Huckabee). In response, Stewart claimed that he was responsible for the success of O'Brien, since Stewart had featured him on ''[[The Jon Stewart Show]]'', and in turn the success of Huckabee. This resulted in a three-part comedic battle between the three pundits, with all three appearing on each other's shows. The feud ended on ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'' with a mock brawl involving the three hosts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/23017599/ Conan, Stewart, Colbert unite in TV feud], February 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart was named one of the ''2005 Time 100'', an annual list of 100 of the most influential people of the year by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brokaw|first=Tom|authorlink=Tom Brokaw|title=Jon Stewart|publisher=''Time''|date=September 27, 2004|url=http://time-proxy.yaga.com/time/subscriber/2005/time100/artists/100stewart.html|accessdate=July 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieved October 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 2000 Stewart married Tracey McShane, his girlfriend of four years. The couple met on a blind date set up by a production assistant on Stewart's film, ''Wishful Thinking''.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN020322&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0203/22/lkl.00.html|title=Interview With Jon Stewart|publisher=CNN|accessdate=October 30, 2008|date=February 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2001/8/15/1/an-hour-with-the-host-of-the-daily-show-jon-stewart|title=An hour with the host of 'The Daily Show' Jon Stewart|publisher=[[Charlie Rose]]|date=August 15, 2001|time=51 minutes, 28 seconds|accessdate=July 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url= http://www.thedailyshow.com/video/index.jhtml?videoId=115735&amp;title=beau-bridges&amp;tag=%20Earth%20Day&amp;itemId=109947&amp;to=7|title=Beau Bridges|publisher=The Daily Show|date=April 23, 2002|time=4 minutes, 50 seconds|accessdate=July 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;AskMen.com Retrieved on July 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On June 19, 2001, Stewart and his wife filed a joint [[name change]] application and legally changed both of their surnames to &quot;Stewart.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Smoking Gun: Archive|publisher=[[The Smoking Gun]]|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/jonstewart1.html|accessdate=February 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He proposed to his future wife through a personalized crossword puzzle created with the help of [[Will Shortz]], the crossword editor at ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0616/p15s01-almo.html|title=Play on words|last=Steve|first=Irene|date=16 June 2006|accessdate=17 Feb 2012|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/magazine/2012/01/dr-sudoku-prescribes-a-modest-proposal/|title=Dr. Sudoku Presents: A Modest Proposal|last=Snyder|first=Thomas|publisher=Wired|date=9 Jan 2012|accessdate=17 Feb 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had their first child, a son named Nathan Thomas Stewart (after Stewart's grandfather),&lt;ref name=moment/&gt; in July 2004. Their second child, a daughter, Maggie Rose Stewart, was born in February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker|first=KC|coauthors=Silverman, Stephen M.|title=A Baby Girl for Jon Stewart|publisher=''People''|date=February 7, 2006|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1157245,00.html|accessdate=October 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They own a cat named Stanley and two [[pit bull terrier]]s, Monkey and Shamsky (named after former [[Major League Baseball]] player [[Art Shamsky]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;dowd&quot;/&gt;

In 2000, when he was labeled a [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democrat]], Stewart generally agreed but described his political affiliation as &quot;more [[socialist]] or [[Independent (voter)|independent]]&quot; than Democratic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=CNN Transcript: Larry King Live: Jon Stewart Looks Back at Election 2000|work=Larry King Live|publisher=CNN|date=December 15, 2000|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0012/15/lkl.00.html|accessdate=March 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stewart is an avid fan of both the [[New York Giants]] and the [[New York Mets]] and occasionally brings this up on his show. He gave an impassioned rant to open his show on February 4, 2008, immediately after the [[Super Bowl XLII|Giants had defeated the Patriots in the Super Bowl]], about the Giants victory, noting his satisfaction in having bragging rights over Patriot and Red Sox sports fans who worked with him and had tormented him for years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/mon-february-4-2008/giant-super-bowl-win|title=Giant Super Bowl Win&amp;nbsp;– The Daily Show with Jon Stewart|work=TheDailyShow.com|date=February 4, 2008 |accessdate=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has mentioned his fandom on his show during interviews with [[Tiki Barber]] and [[David Wright (baseball)|David Wright]].&lt;ref name=&quot;thedailyshow2007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/tue-october-9-2007/tiki-barber|title=Tiki Barber&amp;nbsp;– The Daily Show with Jon Stewart|publisher=TheDailyShow.com|date=October 9, 2007|accessdate=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailyshow.com/watch/wed-october-31-2007/david-wright|title=David Wright&amp;nbsp;– The Daily Show with Jon Stewart|work=TheDailyShow.com|date=October 31, 2007|accessdate=March 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first show after [[Johan Santana]] threw the first ever no-hitter in [[Mets]] history, Stewart provided footage of himself celebrating the victory with his family at the game during his opening monologue about the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;thedailyshow2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/05/jon-stewart-johan-santana-no-hitter-mets_n_1570702.html|title=Jon Stewart Attended Johan Santana No-Hitter, Celebrated Mets History With Family (VIDEO)|work=HuffingtonPost.com|date=June 6, 2012|accessdate=July 12, 2012|first=Michael|last=Klopman}}&lt;/ref&gt;
