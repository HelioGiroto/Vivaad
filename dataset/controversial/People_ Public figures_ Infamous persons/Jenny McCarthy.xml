She began her career in 1993 as a [[Glamour photography|nude model]] for ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine and was later named their [[Playmate of the Year]]. McCarthy then parlayed her ''Playboy'' fame into a successful television and film acting career.

As a teenager, McCarthy attended [[Mother McAuley Liberal Arts High School]] (whose school sweater she donned in the pages of ''Playboy'') and was a cheerleader at both [[Brother Rice High School (Chicago, Illinois)|Brother Rice High School]] and [[St. Laurence High School]]s,&lt;ref&gt;Austin, Michael and Jennifer Wehunt, &quot;Before They Were Famous,&quot; ''[[Chicago (magazine)|Chicago]]'', pg. 76, February 2007, Volume 56, number 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- no citation for status as cheerleading captain--&gt; although she has referred to herself as an &quot;outcast&quot; at her school&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usaweekend.com/98_issues/980719/980719talk_mccarthy.html USA WEEKEND Magazine]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has described how she was repeatedly [[Bullying|bullied]] by classmates.&lt;ref&gt;Jenny McCarthy on &quot;Dr. Drew&quot; on HLN, Oct. 10, 2011, available at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBfJn0UZ4oI&lt;/ref&gt;

After getting accepted by ''Playboy'' in 1993, the magazine offered McCarthy $20,000 (equivalent to ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|20000|1993}}}} today) to pose for its October issue. McCarthy became the Playmate of the Month and later the Playmate of the Year and was paid a $100,000 salary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/specials/magazine4/articles/mccarthy.html ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'', &quot;Heroine Worship: The McCarthy Era&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, because of her newfound public attention, McCarthy moved to [[Los Angeles]] and, for a time, hosted ''Hot Rocks'', a [[Playboy TV]] show featuring uncensored [[music video]]s.

In 1995, [[MTV]] chose McCarthy to be the host of a new dating show called ''[[Singled Out]]'', for which she left ''Hot Rocks''. Her job as a host was a success, and ''Playboy'' wanted her to do more modeling. That same year, she also appeared at [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) pay-per-view event [[WrestleMania XI]] as a guest valet for villain [[Shawn Michaels]], who faced heroic [[WWE Championship|WWF Champion]], [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]]. She left after the match with the victor, Diesel. McCarthy returned to World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE, formerly the WWF) on the [[Saturday Night's Main Event results#Saturday Night's Main Event XXXVI|August 2, 2008 edition]] of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' to thank the fans for supporting [[Generation Rescue]], an [[autism]] advocacy organization. In 1996, she landed a small part in the comedy ''[[The Stupids (film)|The Stupids]]''. In 1997, McCarthy launched two shows. The first one was an MTV sketch comedy show ''The Jenny McCarthy Show'', which was sufficiently popular for [[NBC]] to sign her for an eponymous sitcom later that year, ''Jenny''. The latter show is generally considered a disappointment and was quickly canceled.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Also in 1997, she appeared on one of two covers for the September issue of ''Playboy'' (the other cover featured [[Pamela Anderson]]). McCarthy also released an autobiography: ''Jen-X: Jenny McCarthy's Open Book''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0060392339|title=Jen-X: Jenny McCarthy's Open Book|accessdate=2010-05-06|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, McCarthy's first major movie role was alongside [[Trey Parker]] and [[Matt Stone]] in the comedy ''[[BASEketball]]''. The following year, she starred in ''[[Diamonds (1999 film)|Diamonds]]'', a movie which was directed by her then-husband [[John Mallory Asher]]. In 2000, she had a role in the horror movie ''[[Scream 3]]'', and three years later she [[parodied]] that role in horror film [[Parody|spoof]] ''[[Scary Movie 3]]'' along with fellow Playmate and actress [[Pamela Anderson]]. In 2005, McCarthy produced, wrote, and starred in the movie ''[[Dirty Love (film)|Dirty Love]]'', where she was again directed by her husband at the time, [[John Mallory Asher|John Asher]]. In March 2006, she was given [[26th Golden Raspberry Awards|Razzie Awards]] for &quot;Worst Actress&quot;, &quot;Worst Screenplay&quot;, and &quot;Worst Picture&quot; for her work on ''Dirty Love'', which also earned [[John Mallory Asher|Asher]] a Razzie for &quot;Worst Director.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=26th Annual Golden Raspberry (Razzie©) Award 'Winners'|url=http://www.razzies.com/history/05winners.asp|author=John Wilson and The Golden Raspberry Award Foundation|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to her early TV fame on MTV and her short-lived, self-titled NBC sitcom, McCarthy has guest starred in a variety of other television shows including ''[[Stacked]]'', ''[[Charmed]]'', ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'', ''[[Wings (NBC TV series)|Wings]]'', ''[[Fastlane (TV series)|Fastlane]]'', ''[[Two and a Half Men (TV series)|Two and a Half Men]]'' and ''[[Just Shoot Me!]]''.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} She was the voice of Six in the third season of Canadian computer-animated science fiction cartoon ''[[Tripping the Rift]]''. In 2005, McCarthy hosted a show on [[E!]] called ''Party at the Palms''. The [[reality television|reality show]], which was filmed at [[Palms Casino Resort|The Palms]] Hotel in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], featured hotel guests, party goers, and celebrities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2005/Jun-06-Mon-2005/living/1997484.html ''Las Vegas Review-Journal'', &quot;SHOOTING STARS: 'Party at the Palms' begins filming with host Jenny McCarthy,&quot; June 06, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;

McCarthy has continued her work with ''Playboy'' over the years, both as a model and in other capacities. She appeared on the cover of the magazine's January 2005 issue wearing a leopard skin version of the company's iconic [[Playboy bunny|&quot;bunny suit&quot;]] and was featured in a pictorial shot at [[Elvis Presley]]'s [[Graceland]] mansion in that same issue. She was the second woman (following [[Carmen Electra]]) and first former Playmate to become a [[List of Playboy Cyber Club celebrity photographers|celebrity photographer]] for the [[Playboy Cyber Club]], where she photographed model Jennifer Madden.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Jenny's younger sister Amy has also posed for ''Playboy''. She was [[Playboy Cyber Girl|Cyber Girl of the Week]] for September 27, 2004, and [[Playboy Cyber Girl|Cyber Girl of the Month]] for January, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playboy.com/girls/cybergirls/month/200501/|accessdate=2007-09-18|title=Amy McCarthy|publisher=Playboy.com|year=2005|month=January}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, McCarthy starred in a five-episode online series, called ''[[In the Motherhood]]'', along with [[Chelsea Handler]] and [[Leah Remini]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inthemotherhood.com/ |title=ABC.com - Television Shows &amp; Programming |publisher=Inthemotherhood.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show aired on [[MSN]] and was based on being a mother where users could submit their stories to have it made into real webisodes.

She has also appeared in two video games: playing the role of Agent Tanya in the video game ''[[Command and Conquer: Red Alert 3]]'', replacing [[Kari Wührer]], and the fitness video game ''[[Your Shape Featuring Jenny McCarthy]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;playboydec&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|periodical=Playboy|publisher=Playboy Inc.|title=Playmate News|volume=56|year=2009|month=December|pages=166–167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is the host of season 2 of ''[[Love in the Wild]]'', which began on June 7, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parade.com/celebrity/news/2012/04/19-jenny-mccarthy.html|title=Jenny McCarthy: 'I'm Taking Baby Steps' with New Romance|accessdate=2012-05-05|date=2012-04-19|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|author=Margaret, Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public persona===
[[File:20050404 Jenny McCarthy.jpg|thumb|April 4, 2005]]
McCarthy once modeled for [[Candie's]], a shoe company. In one magazine ad, McCarthy posed on a toilet seat with her underwear near her ankles. Cultural scholar Collin Gifford Brooke wrote that the ad's &quot;[[taboo]] nature&quot; brought it attention, while noting that the ad itself helped to weaken that taboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A sketch on her MTV show centered on her character, a well-coiffed business woman, answering the question of &quot;What did you have for lunch?&quot; by seeming to force herself to vomit all over a table which she then ate. This was faked using special effects.

This theme was taken to a new extreme in her film ''Dirty Love'', which featured McCarthy's character sitting in a massive pool of her own [[menstruation|menstrual blood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stuart Heritage |url=http://www.hecklerspray.com/glory-at-the-razzies-for-tom-cruise-nicole-kidman/20062393.php |title=Glory At The Razzies For Tom Cruise &amp; Nicole Kidman—Hecklerspray: Music, Movies, TV, Celebs, Games and Gossip |publisher=Hecklerspray.com |date=2006-03-06 |accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
McCarthy dated manager Ray Manzella from 1994 until 1998. McCarthy began dating actor/director [[John Mallory Asher]] late in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990114,00.html|title=Jenny Cme Back|accessdate= October 5, 2008 |date= February 1, 1999|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|author=Orecklin, Michele}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple became engaged in January 1999, and married on September 11 of that year. They have a son, Evan Joseph, born on May 18, 2002. Evan was diagnosed with [[autism]]. McCarthy and Asher [[divorce]]d in September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recordssitereviews.com/divorcerecords/john-asher-jenny-mccarthy-divorce.html|title=The John Asher and Jenny McCarthy Divorce|accessdate= October 2, 2011|publisher=recordssitereview.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, McCarthy began dating actor [[Jim Carrey]]. They did not make their relationship public until June 2006. She announced on ''[[The Ellen DeGeneres Show]]'' on April 2, 2008 that she and Carrey were living together, but had no plans to marry, as they did not need a &quot;piece of paper.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;People Mag&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20237480,00.html | title=Jenny McCarthy Doesn't 'Need Piece of Paper to Prove My Love' | accessdate= December 29, 2010| author=Dreben, Jeb | date= November 3, 2008 | publisher=People Magazine (people.com)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carrey almost made a mock proposal to McCarthy as a promotion to the film ''[[Yes Man (film)|Yes Man]]'' for Ellen's Twelve Days of Holidays.

A study found 24% of parents placed &quot;some trust&quot; in information on vaccine safety from celebrities like Jenny McCarthy.&lt;ref name=Rochman /&gt;

McCarthy's book on the subject, ''Louder than Words: A Mother's Journey in Healing Autism'', was published September 17, 2007. She stated both in her book and during her appearance on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' that her husband was unable to deal with their son's autism, which led to their divorce. In 2008, she appeared on a ''[[Larry King Live]]'' special dedicated to the subject, and argued that [[MMR vaccine controversy|vaccines can trigger autism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gross L |title=A broken trust: lessons from the vaccine–autism wars |journal=PLoS Biol |volume=7 |issue=5 |pages=e1000114 |year=2009 |pmid=19478850 |doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.1000114 |url=http://www.plosbiology.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000114 |pmc=2682483 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0804/02/lkl.01.html |title=CNN Larry King Live: Jenny McCarthy's Autism Fight, Aired April 2, 2008 |work= |accessdate= May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an April 27, 2010 PBS ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' documentary, she was interviewed about the controversy between vaccine opponents and public health experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2010/04/27/measured_doses_of_fact_friction_in_vaccine_war/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=Measured doses of fact, friction in ‘Vaccine War' | first=Don | last=Aucoin | date=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/vaccines/ &quot;The Vaccine War&quot;], PBS [[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|FRONTLINE]] documentary, April 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to conventional, intensive Applied Behavioral Analysis (ABA) therapy, McCarthy tried a gluten-free and casein-free diet, hyperbaric oxygen chambers, chelation, aromatherapies, electromagnetics, spoons rubbed on his body, multivitamin therapy, B-12 shots and numerous prescription drugs.  &quot;Try everything,&quot; she advises parents, &quot;It was amazing to watch, over the course of doing this, how certain therapies work for certain kids and they completely don't work for others ... When something didn't work for Evan, I didn't stop. I stopped that treatment, but I didn't stop.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time2&quot;/&gt; McCarthy has stated on talk shows and at rallies that [[chelation therapy]] helped her son recover from autism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rochman&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Rochman|first=Bonnie|title=Jenny McCarthy, Vaccine Expert? A Quarter of Parents Trust Celebrities|url=http://healthland.time.com/2011/04/26/jenny-mccarthy-vaccine-expert-a-quarter-of-parents-trust-celebrities/|accessdate=6 May 2011|newspaper=Time|date=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The underlying rationale for chelation, the speculation that [[Thiomersal controversy|mercury in vaccines causes autism]], has been roundly rejected by scientific studies, with the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] concluding that children with autism are unlikely to receive any benefit to balance the risks of heart attack, stroke and cardiac arrest posed by the [[chelation|chelating agent]]s used in the treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stokstad&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Science |year=2008 |volume=321 |issue=5887 |page=326 |title= Stalled trial for autism highlights dilemma of alternative treatments |author= Stokstad E |doi=10.1126/science.321.5887.326 |pmid=18635766}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

McCarthy's public presence, and vocal activism on the [[vaccination-autism controversy]], led, in 2008, to her being awarded The [[James Randi]] Educational Foundation's [[Pigasus Award]] (granted for contributions to [[pseudoscience]]) for the 'Performer Who Has Fooled The Greatest Number of People with The Least Amount of Effort'. Randi stated in a video on the JREF's website that he did sympathize with the plight of McCarthy and her child, but admonished her for using her public presence in a way that may discourage parents from having their own children vaccinated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randi.org/site/index.php/jref-news/500-pigasus-awards-for-2008-announced.html|title=Pigasus Awards for 2008 Announced|accessdate= April 16, 2010 |date=April 1, 2009 |publisher=James Randi Educational Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McCarthy's claims that vaccines cause autism are not supported by any medical evidence, and the original paper by [[Andrew Wakefield]] that formed the basis for the claims (and for whose book McCarthy wrote a foreword)&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://healthland.time.com/2011/01/06/study-linking-vaccines-to-autism-is-fraudulent/ |title= Study linking vaccines to autism is 'fraudulent' |work= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= January 6, 2011 |accessdate= January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been shown to be based on manipulated data and fraudulent research.&lt;ref name=&quot;WakefieldarticleBMJ&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |year= 2011 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c7452 |pages= c7452 |volume= 342:c7452|title= Wakefield's article linking MMR vaccine and autism was fraudulent |author= Godlee F, Smith J, Marcovitch H |journal = [[BMJ]] |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c7452.full |pmid=21209060}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BMJ2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | title=How the case against the MMR vaccine was fixed| author=Deer B| journal=BMJ| year=2011| volume=342| pages=c5347 | pmid=21209059| url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5347.full |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c5347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NPRWakefield&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.npr.org/2011/01/05/132692497/journal-study-linking-vaccine-to-autism-was-fraud |publisher=NPR | agency= Associated Press |title= Study linking vaccine to autism was fraud  |date= January 5, 2011 |accessdate= January 6, 2011}}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news |publisher= CNN |title= Retracted autism study an 'elaborate fraud,' British journal finds |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/01/05/autism.vaccines/index.html |date=January 6, 2011 |accessdate=January 6, 2011| location=Atlanta}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[BMJ]]'' published a 2011 article by journalist [[Brian Deer]], based on information uncovered by [[Freedom of Information legislation]] after the British [[General Medical Council]] (GMC) inquiry into allegations of [[Scientific misconduct|misconduct]] against Wakefield that led to him being struck-off from the medical register (unable to practice medicine in the UK) and his articles retracted, stating that Wakefield had planned a venture to profit from the MMR vaccine scare.&lt;ref name=&quot;HowMakeMoney&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |journal= BMJ |date= January 11, 2011 |pages= c5258|volume= 342:c5258 |doi= 10.1136/bmj.c5258 |title= How the vaccine crisis was meant to make money |author=Deer B |url= http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.c5258.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WakefieldCapitalize&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://voices.washingtonpost.com/checkup/2011/01/wakefield_tried_to_capitalize.html | title= Wakefield tried to capitalize on autism-vaccine link, report says |author= Stein, Rob |date= January 11, 2011|work= The Washington Post |accessdate= January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AuthorHeld&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/HEALTH/01/11/autism.vaccines/?hpt=Sbin |title= Vaccine study's author held related patent, medical journal reports| publisher= CNN |date= January 11, 2011 |accessdate= January 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DoctorPlanned&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.webmd.com/brain/autism/news/20110111/mmr-doctor-planned-make-millions-journal-claims |title= MMR Doctor 'Planned to Make Millions,' Journal Claims |author= Russell, Peter |publisher= WebMD Health News |date= January 11, 2011 |accessdate= January 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parental concerns over vaccines have led to decreased immunization rates and increased incidence of [[Pertussis|whooping cough]] and [[measles]], a highly contagious and sometimes deadly disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-vaccine2-2008may02,0,6944471.story |title= Rise in measles prompts concern |author= Lin RG II |work= Los Angeles Times |date= May 2, 2008 |accessdate= November 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Neil Cameron, a historian who specializes in the history of science, writing for The ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Montreal Gazette]]'' labeled the controversy a &quot;failure of journalism&quot; that resulted in unnecessary deaths, saying that ''The Lancet'' should not have published a study based on &quot;statistically meaningless results&quot; from only 12 cases and that a grapevine of worried parents and &quot;nincompoop&quot; celebrities fueled the widespread fears.&lt;ref name=&quot;FailureJournalism&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.montrealgazette.com/health/Autism+study+represents+failure+journalism/4095111/story.html |title= Autism 'study' represents a failure of journalism | author= Cameron, Neil |date= January 12, 2011 |work = The Montreal Gazette |accessdate= January 12, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Generation Rescue]] issued a statement that the &quot;media circus&quot; following the revelation of fraud and manipulation of data was &quot;much ado about nothing&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.generationrescue.org/ |title= Jenny McCarthy's Generation Rescue | publisher= [[Generation Rescue]] |accessdate= January 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which led ''USA Today'' to report that McCarthy had &quot;taken a beating on Twitter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2011/01/jenny-mccarthy-under-fire-on-twitter-/1 |work= USA Today |date= January 6, 2011 |accessdate= January 7, 2011 |title= Jenny McCarthy under fire on Twitter |first=Gary |last=Levin}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salon.com]] responded to Generation Rescue's statement with:&lt;ref name=&quot;SalonMcCarthy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/life/feature/2011/01/06/jenny_mccarthy_autism_debate/ |author= Williams, Mary Elizabeth |title= Jenny McCarthy's autism fight grows more misguided |date= January 6, 2011 |accessdate= January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It's high time the woman who once said that 'I do believe sadly it's going to take some diseases coming back to realize that we need to change and develop vaccines that are safe' took a step back and reconsidered the merits of that increasingly crackpot stance. And it's time she acknowledged that clinging to research that's been deemed patently fraudulent does not make one a 'mother warrior.' It makes her a menace.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 2011, McCarthy defended Wakefield, saying that he had listened to parents, reported what they said, and recommended further investigation. &quot;Since when is repeating the words of parents and recommending further investigation a crime? As I've learned, the answer is whenever someone questions the safety of any vaccines. For some reason, parents aren't being told that this &quot;new&quot; information about Dr. Wakefield isn't a medical report, but merely the allegations of a single British journalist named Brian Deer&quot;, she said of the controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ParentsBelieve&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jenny-mccarthy/vaccine-autism-debate_b_806857.html |author = McCarthy, Jenny | title= Jenny McCarthy: In the Vaccine-Autism Debate, What Can Parents Believe? |date= January 10, 2011 |publisher= Huffington Post |accessdate= January 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
