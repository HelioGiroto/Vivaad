'''Gerald Norman &quot;Jerry&quot; Springer''' (born February 13, 1944), is a British-born American [[television]] [[presenter]], best known as host of the [[tabloid talk show]] ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' since its debut in 1991. He was a former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[mayor]] of [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://audio.thisamericanlife.org/player/CPRadio_player.php?podcast=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/xmlfeeds/258.xml&amp;proxyloc=http://audio.thisamericanlife.org/player/customproxy.php|title= This American Life: 258-Leaving the Fold}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[news anchor]], and [[musician]].

==Early life==
Springer was born in [[Highgate tube station]] in [[London]], [[England]], while the station was in use as a shelter from German bombing during [[World War II]]&lt;ref name=&quot;jconline&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Nathan|first=John|title=Interview: Jerry Springer|url=http://www.thejc.com/arts/arts-interviews/15740/interview-jerry-springer|accessdate=2 August 2010|newspaper=Jewish Chronicle Online|date=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up on Chandos Road, [[East Finchley]]. His parents, Margot (née Kallmann; a bank clerk) and Richard Springer (owner of a shoe shop&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|1281818|Who Do You Think You Are? Jerry Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt;), were [[Jewish refugees]] who escaped from [[Landsberg an der Warthe]], Germany (now Gorzów Wielkopolski, Poland).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/whodoyouthinkyouare/new-stories/jerry-springer/how-we-did-it_2.shtml Who do you think you are] [[BBC]] documentary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sheridan-breakfast&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last=Sheridan | first=Patricia | title=Patricia Sheridan's Breakfast with Jerry Springer | work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07162/793130-129.stm | date=2007-06-11 | accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/28/Jerry-Springer.html| title=Jerry Springer Biography (1944-)| publisher=Theatre, Film, and Television Biographies| accessdate=2008-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandmother Marie Kallmann, who was left behind, died in the gas trucks of [[Chelmno extermination camp]]. His paternal grandmother, Selma Springer, died at the [[Theresienstadt concentration camp]]. In January 1949, Springer emigrated with his parents to the United States, settling in [[Kew Gardens, Queens|Kew Gardens]], [[Queens]], New York and attended Forest Hills High School. He and his sister Evelyn were raised in a small four-room apartment. One of his earliest memories about current events was when he was 12 and watching the 1956 Democratic convention on television where he saw and was impressed by [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;Powers and Johnson, 1998; also, Waldman, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Tulane University]] in 1965, majoring in political science.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Springer, Gerald N.&quot; ''Tulane University Alumni Directory 2002'', New Orleans: Tulane U. p. 761&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) degree from [[Northwestern University]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;sheridan-breakfast&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;plotz-slate&quot;/&gt;

Springer became a [[political campaign]] adviser to [[Robert F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;plotz-slate&quot;/&gt; After [[Assassination of Robert F. Kennedy|Kennedy's assassination]], he joined the [[Cincinnati]] law firm of Frost &amp; Jacobs, now [[Frost Brown Todd]].

==Political career==
In 1970, Springer ran for [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]]. He failed to unseat incumbent Republican [[Donald D. Clancy]], but garnered an impressive 45% of the vote in a traditionally Republican district. He had previously spearheaded the effort to lower the voting age, including testifying before the [[United States Senate Committee on the Judiciary|Senate Judiciary Committee]] in support of ratification of the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution|26th Amendment]].
 
Springer was elected to the [[Cincinnati]] city council in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;plotz-slate&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Plotz | first=David | title=Jerry Springer | url=http://www.slate.com/id/1857/ | work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] | date=1998-03-22 | accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned in 1974 after admitting to hiring a prostitute.&lt;ref name=&quot;plotz-slate&quot;/&gt; The episode was uncovered when a police raid on a [[Fort Wright, Kentucky]] &quot;massage parlor&quot; unearthed a check Springer had written for its &quot;services&quot;. The check subsequently bounced due to lack of funds in the account.  Springer came clean at a press conference.  Long-time Cincinnati newsman [[Al Schottelkotte]] pronounced Springer's career over, but Springer's honesty helped him win back his seat in 1975 by a landslide.  In a post-election interview, Schottelkotte good-naturedly reminded Springer that he had declared Springer's career over.  Springer told the newsman, &quot;I'm glad that you were wrong.&quot;   In 1977, he was chosen to serve one year as mayor by the City Council.

In 1982, Springer sought the Democratic nomination for governor of Ohio. TV commercials for Springer's campaign referenced his use of a check to pay a prostitute, saying that he was not afraid of the truth &quot;even if it hurts&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzT4dOyCMg0&amp;mode=related&amp;search= Jerry Springer for Governor: a 1980 Campaign Ad] YouTube&lt;/ref&gt; He failed to win the Democratic party's nomination—finishing a distant third behind former Lieutenant Governor Richard F. Celeste and Ohio Attorney General William J. Brown, and his political career was put on hold. Springer considered running for the [[United States Senate]] in 2003,&lt;ref name=&quot;korte-door&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Gregory Korte|last=Korte|first=Gregory|title=Springer opens door on politics|url=http://www.enquirer.com/editions/2003/02/14/loc_springer14.html|work=[[The Cincinnati Enquirer]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|date=2003-02-14|accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; but backed down due to negative associations with ''The Jerry Springer Show''.&lt;ref name=&quot;horstman-senate&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Barry M.

==Politics to journalism==
Springer's broadcast career started while he was an undergraduate at Tulane University, on [[WTUL]] New Orleans FM, a progressive format independent radio station. It continued while he was still mayor of Cincinnati, with album-oriented rock radio station [[WEBN]]-FM, which was noted for its laid-back and irreverent radio format. The station featured commentaries by Springer under the banner &quot;The Springer Memorandum.&quot; The popularity of these commentaries launched his broadcasting career.

Springer was hired as a political reporter and commentator on Cincinnati's [[NBC]] affiliate, [[WLWT]], which had, at the time, the lowest-rated [[news]] program. Later, having been named primary news anchor and Managing Editor, he needed a broadcast catchphrase in the model of other great newsmen. With the help of some others at WLWT, he created his signature line: &quot;Take care of yourself, and each other.&quot; Within two years he was Cincinnati's number-one news anchor, along with partner Norma Rashid. For five years, he was the most popular one in the city,&lt;ref name=&quot;plotz-slate&quot;/&gt; garnering ten local [[Emmy Award]]s for his nightly commentaries, which were frequently satirized by Cincinnati radio personality [[Gary Burbank]]. Those commentaries would eventually become his &quot;Final Thought&quot; on &quot;[[The Jerry Springer Show]].&quot; Springer would remain commentator at WLWT until January 1993.&lt;!--He went to St Bonifaces Collage ??? clarify--&gt; He resided in [[Loveland, Ohio]], during this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;CincyMag Graham&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jerry Springer Live!|author=Michael Graham|first=Michael|last=Graham|work=[[Cincinnati Magazine]]|location=[[Columbus, Ohio]]|publisher=[[CM Media]]|month=June|year=1992|volume=25|issue=9|page=48|issn=0746-8210|accessdate=2010-02-09|url=http://books.google.com/?id=LesCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA48|quote=A resident of Loveland, [Jerry] Springer is married with a 15-year-old daughter...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the [[Chicago]]-based [[NBC]]-owned station [[WMAQ-TV]] hired Springer to serve as a news commentator. However, this proved to be unpopular among viewers, as it resulted in the resignation of long-time news anchors [[Ron Magers]] and [[Carol Marin]]. After performing only two commentaries, Springer resigned as commentator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1997/05/09/us/springer-quits-news-show-citing-attacks.html|publisher= The New York Times|title= Springer Quits News Show, Citing Attacks|date = May 9, 1997|accessdate= May 25, 2009 | first=Bill | last=Carter}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b34501_Jerry_Springer_Quits_News_Job.html|title= E!

===''The Jerry Springer Show''===
{{Main|The Jerry Springer Show}}
''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' debuted on September 30, 1991. It was developed by [[WLWT]] to mimic the format and look of fellow talk show ''[[The Phil Donahue Show|Donahue]]'', all the way down to Jerry's haircut and glasses, making him look like [[Phil Donahue]] (coincidentally, both were produced by Multimedia Entertainment). It started as a politically oriented talk show, a longer version of Springer's commentaries. Guests included [[Oliver North]] and [[Jesse Jackson]], and topics included homelessness and gun politics.

In early 1994, Springer and his new producer, [[Richard Dominick]], revamped the show's format in order to garner higher ratings. The show became more and more successful as it became more and more lowbrow, with an emphasis on infidelity. Its guests were typically lower class, minimally educated, [[blue collar]] people confronted on a television stage by a spouse or family member's [[adultery]], [[homosexuality]], [[prostitution]], [[transvestism]], [[hate group]] membership, or other controversial situations.  These confrontations often led to shouting, profanities, chair-throwing, fist-fights, pulling of hair by fighting women, and removal of clothing. Female guests also receive 'Jerry Beads' for exposing their breasts to the studio audience, in the style of [[Mardi Gras]] revelers. The show garnered huge ratings, and lots of attention. By 1998, it was beating ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]'' in many cities, and was reaching more than 6.7 million viewers. (Waxman, 1998)

On July 10, 2002, the sons of guest Nancy Campbell-Panitz - who was murdered by her ex-husband after they appeared on a May 2000 episode with his girlfriend - filed suit in [[Sarasota County, Florida|Sarasota County]] against Springer, his producers, and his distributor, claiming he created &quot;a mood that led to murder.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Note: online sources that call her &quot;Nanny&quot; seem to be in error. Most media reports say that her first name was Nancy. For example {{cite news|date = 2002-07-11|title = Springer sued over murdered guest|url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2121700.stm|publisher = BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the estate of Ms. Campbell-Panitz dropped all monetary claims against ''The Jerry Springer Show'' and the show agreed to waive its claims for malicious prosecution against the personal representative of the estate of Ms. Campbell-Panitz and his counsel.

In 2005, a UK version was shown on [[ITV1]] titled ''[[The Jerry Springer Show|The Springer Show]]''. It beat its talk-show rival [[Trisha Goddard (TV series)|Trisha Goddard]] five to one in the ratings, despite it being a subdued and more [[tongue-in-cheek]] version of the U.S. show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/broadcasting/a21921/springer-thrashing-trisha-in-talkshow-battle.html|title=Springer thrashing Trisha in talkshow battle|date=June 19, 2005|publisher=Digital Spy (entertainment news)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[VH1]] &quot;celebreality&quot; series ''The Springer Hustle,'' which took a look at how ''[[The Jerry Springer Show]]'' is produced, premiered in April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/springer_hustle/series.jhtml| title=The Springer Hustle| publisher=VH1| accessdate=2008-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wanted to appear on the show so he could learn the [[waltz]] for the wedding of his daughter, Katie.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday-synd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Fans go wild for 'Dancing' Jerry Springer | work=[[MSNBC]] | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15127991/ | date=2006-10-04 | accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Springer and Johnson were eliminated in the seventh week of competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Jerry Springer Voted Off 'Dancing With the Stars' | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,225478,00.html | work=[[Fox News Channel]] | date=2006-10-26 | accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 16, 2008, Springer delivered the [[Northwestern University School of Law]] commencement address. Although many students had criticized the University's choice of speaker, he received a standing ovation from about half the audience and reviews of his speech were generally positive.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailynu-speech&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author[[The Daily Northwestern]] | title=Springer addresses Law grads at commencement | url=http://media.www.dailynorthwestern.com/media/storage/paper853/news/2008/05/16/Campus/Springer.Addresses.Law.Grads.At.Commencement-3372681.shtml | work=[[The Daily Northwestern]] | date=2008-05-16 | accessdate=2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a March 2009 interview on [[Anytime with Bob Kushell]], Springer said that in his speech he talked about &quot;the ethical judgments we all have to make in whatever business we go [into].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Anytime with Bob Kushell feat.
