'''Britney Jean Spears''' (born December 2, 1981) is an American [[recording artist]] and [[entertainer]]. Born in [[McComb, Mississippi]], and raised in [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], she began performing as a child, landing acting roles in stage productions and television shows. She signed with [[Jive Records]] in 1997 and released her debut album ''[[...Baby One More Time]]'' in 1999, which became the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist.&lt;ref&gt;Folkard, Claire (2003). ''Guinness World Records 2003''. Bantam Books. p. 288. ISBN 978-0-553-58636-7.&lt;/ref&gt; During her first decade in the music industry, she became a prominent figure in mainstream popular music and popular culture, followed by a much-publicized personal life. Her first two albums established her as a [[pop icon]] and broke sales records, while title tracks &quot;[[...Baby One More Time (song)|...Baby One More Time]]&quot; and &quot;[[Oops!... I Did It Again (song)|Oops!... I Did It Again]]&quot; became international number-one hits. Spears was credited with influencing the revival of [[teen pop]] during the late 1990s, and became the 'best-selling teenaged artist of all time' before she turned 20,&lt;ref&gt;Ruggieri, Melissa (2000-12-19). &quot;Music Notes&quot;. ''Richmond Times-Dispatch'': pp. D.13&lt;/ref&gt; garnering her honorific titles such as &quot;[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Princess of Pop]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Often referred to in interviews, cover stories and promotional material as the new 'princess of pop' Susan Hopkins (2002), ''Girl Heroes: The New Force In Popular Culture'', University of Michigan Press, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, she released her third studio album ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' and expanded her brand, playing the starring role in the film ''[[Crossroads (2002 film)|Crossroads]]''. She assumed creative control of her fourth studio album, ''[[In the Zone]]'' (2003), which yielded chart-topping singles &quot;[[Me Against the Music]]&quot;, &quot;[[Toxic (song)|Toxic]]&quot; and &quot;[[Everytime]]&quot;. After the release of two compilation albums, Spears experienced personal struggles and her career went into hiatus. Her fifth studio album, ''[[Blackout (Britney Spears album)|Blackout]]'', was released in 2007 and despite receiving little promotion, it spawned hits &quot;[[Gimme More]]&quot; and &quot;[[Piece of Me]]&quot;. In 2008, her erratic behavior and hospitalizations caused her to be placed in a [[conservatorship]]. The same year, her sixth studio album ''[[Circus (Britney Spears album)|Circus]]'' was released, with the global chart-topping lead single &quot;[[Womanizer (song)|Womanizer]]&quot;, and hits such as &quot;[[Circus (song)|Circus]]&quot; and &quot;[[If U Seek Amy]]&quot;. She embarked on her highest-grossing global concert tour,&lt;ref name=femaletours&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollyscoop.com/music/madonna/15-most-profitable-female-tours-ever_2133.aspx|title=15 Most Profitable Female Tours Ever|date=2010-05-21|accessdate=2010-07-27| last=Esmailian|first=Ani|work=Hollyscoop|publisher=DNA Group}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Circus Starring Britney Spears]], in 2009. In October of the same year, she released a chart-topping single, &quot;[[3 (song)|3]]&quot;, which became her third single to reach number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. Her seventh studio album ''[[Femme Fatale (Britney Spears album)|Femme Fatale]]'', released in 2011, has become the first of her albums to yield three top ten singles in the United States, &quot;[[Hold It Against Me]]&quot;, &quot;[[Till the World Ends]]&quot; and &quot;[[I Wanna Go]]&quot;. The same year, she also gained her fifth number one single when she featured on the remix of &quot;[[S&amp;M (song)|S&amp;M]]&quot; alongside [[Rihanna]].

Spears's work has earned her [[List of awards and nominations received by Britney Spears|numerous awards]] and accolades, including a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy Award]], 6 [[MTV Video Music Awards]] including the [[MTV Video Vanguard Award|Lifetime Achievement Award]], 9 [[Billboard Music Awards|''Billboard'' Music Awards]], and a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

==Life and career==

===1981–97: Early life and career beginnings===
Britney Jean Spears was born on December 2, 1981, the second child of [[Lynne Spears|Lynne Irene]] (née Bridges) and James Parnell Spears. Her maternal grandmother, Lillian Portell, was [[English American|English]] (born in London), and one of Spears's maternal great-great-grandfathers was [[Maltese people|Maltese]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1056674/EXCLUSIVE-First-photos-Britney-Spears-newly-discovered-British-family.html|title=Exclusive: First photos of Britney Spears' newly-discovered British family|work=Daily Mail |location=UK |date=2008-09-17|accessdate=2010-06-04|last=Thomas|first=Liz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her siblings are Bryan James and [[Jamie Lynn Spears|Jamie Lynn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=211}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age three, she started attending dance lessons in her hometown of [[Kentwood, Louisiana]], and was selected to perform as a solo artist at the annual recital. During her childhood, she also attended gymnastics and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rs1&gt;{{cite journal|url=|title=Cover Story: Britney Spears: Britney Spears : Rolling Stone|date=1999-04-15|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|last=Daly|first=Steven|issn=0035-791X|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=foxnews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,195283,00.html|title=Britney Spears' Biography&amp;nbsp;|publisher=Fox News |date=2008-07-31|accessdate=2010-06-06|last=Reporter|first=Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spears made her local stage debut at age five, singing &quot;[[What Child Is This?]]&quot; at her [[kindergarten]] graduation. She said about her ambition as a child, &quot;I was in my own world, [...] I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age&quot;.&lt;ref name=rs1/&gt; At age eight, Spears and her mother Lynne traveled to [[Atlanta]] for an audition in the 1990s revival of ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]''. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her for being too young to join the series at the time, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's vocals and suggested enrolling her at the [[Professional Performing Arts School]]; shortly after, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York. Spears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the Off-Broadway musical ''[[Ruthless!]]''. She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show ''[[Star Search]]'', as well as being cast in a number of commercials.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Spears|Craker|2008|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Laufenberg|2005|p=616}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1992, she was finally cast in ''The Mickey Mouse Club'', but returned to Kentwood after the show was canceled. She enrolled at [[Parklane Academy]] in nearby [[McComb, Mississippi]]. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to &quot;the opening scene in ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' with all the [[cliques]]. [...] I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming and Christmas formal. But I wanted more.&quot;&lt;ref name=rs1/&gt;&lt;ref name=rs2&gt;{{cite journal|url=|title=Cover Story: The Girl Can't Help It|date=2000-05-25|work=Rolling Stone|last=Mundy|first=Chris|issn=0035-791X|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager [[Lou Pearlman]] to join the female pop group [[Innosense]]. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided he wanted to pitch her to record labels, therefore she needed a professional demo. He sent Spears an unused song of [[Toni Braxton]]; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio with a [[Audio engineering|sound engineer]]. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, arguing that audiences wanted pop bands such as the [[Backstreet Boys]] and the [[Spice Girls]], and &quot;there wasn't going to be another [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], another [[Debbie Gibson]], or another [[Tiffany (singer)|Tiffany]].&quot; Two weeks later, executives from [[Jive Records]] returned calls to Rudolph.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior vice president of [[A&amp;R]] Jeff Fenster stated about Spears's audition that &quot;It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'—is extremely important. And Britney had that.&quot;&lt;ref name=rs1/&gt; She then sang Houston's &quot;[[I Have Nothing]]&quot; (1992) for the executives, and got signed to the label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Taylor, Chuck | url = http://books.google.com/?id=JQoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;pg=PA80#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | journal=Billboard | title = Air Waves: Jive's Britney Spears Sets Top 40 Abuzz With Rhythm-Leaning 'Baby One More Time' | publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc. | volume = 110 | issue = 43 | date = 1998-10-24 | accessdate = 2011-03-11 | issn = 0006-2510 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from &quot;lower and less poppy&quot; delivery to &quot;distinctively, unmistakably Britney.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 2005 147&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; After hearing the recorded material, president [[Clive Calder]] ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned &quot;[[Sheryl Crow]] music, but younger more adult contemporary&quot; but felt all right with her label's appointment of producers, since &quot;It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me.&quot; She flew to [[Cheiron Studios]] in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers [[Max Martin]], [[Denniz Pop]] and [[Rami Yacoub]], among others.&lt;ref name=rs1/&gt;

===1998–00: ''...Baby One More Time'' and ''Oops!... I Did It Again''===
After Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour to promote her forthcoming album. Her show was a four song set and she was accompanied by two back up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for [['N Sync]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her debut album, ''[[...Baby One More Time]]'', was released on January 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/britney-spears-teen-queen-rolling-stones-1999-cover-story-20110329|title=Britney Spears, Teen Queen: Rolling Stone's 1999 Cover Story|work=Rolling Stone|year=2011|accessdate=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It debuted at number one on the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and was certified two-times [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] after a month. Worldwide, the album topped the charts in fifteen countries and sold over ten million copies in a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the biggest selling album ever by a teenage artist.&lt;ref name=foxnews/&gt; The [[...Baby One More Time (song)|title track]] was released as the [[lead single]] from the album. Originally, Jive Records wanted its music video to be animated; however, Spears rejected it, and suggested the final idea of a Catholic schoolgirl.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 2005 147&quot;/&gt; The single sold 500,000 copies on its first day, and peaked at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], topping the chart for two consecutive weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bronson|2003|p=377}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; later received a [[Grammy]] nomination for [[Grammy Award for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance|Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/archive/2000/grammys.htm|title=Rock On The Net: 42nd Annual Grammy Awards – 2000|work=[[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]]|publisher=RockOntheNet.com|year=2010|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title track also topped the singles chart for two weeks in the United Kingdom, and became the fastest-selling single ever by a female artist, shipping over 460,000 copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everyhit.com/record4.html|title=Record-Breakers and Trivia |publisher=Everyhit.com|year=2010|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would later become the [[UK Million-Selling Singles|25th most successful song of all time in British chart history]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://everyhit.com/bestsellingsingles.html|title=Best Selling Singles Of All Time|publisher=Everyhit.com|year=2010|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spears is also the youngest female artist to have a million seller in the country.&lt;ref name=ukchart&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/artist/_/BRITNEY%20SPEARS/|title=Britney Spears&amp;nbsp;| publisher=The Official Charts Company|year=2010|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[(You Drive Me) Crazy]]&quot; was released as the third single from the album.

The April 1999 cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' featured Spears lying on her bed, clad with a bra, shorts and an open top. The [[American Family Association]] (AFA) referred to the shoot as &quot;a disturbing mix of childhood innocence and adult sexuality&quot; and called to &quot;God-loving Americans to boycott stores selling Britney's albums.&quot; Spears responded to the outcry commenting, &quot;What's the big deal? I have strong morals. [...] I'd do it again. I thought the pictures were fine. And I was tired of being compared to Debbie Gibson and all of this [[bubblegum pop]] all the time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before, Spears had announced publicly she would remain a [[virgin]] until marriage.&lt;ref name=foxnews/&gt; On June 28, 1999, Spears began her first headlining [[...Baby One More Time Tour]] in North America, which was positively received by critics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/S/Spears_Britney/1999/07/10/749831.html|title=Spears takes aim at fame|date=1999-07-10|accessdate=2010-01-01|last=Stevenson|first=Jane|work=[[Jam!]]|publisher=[[Quebecor Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but generated some controversy due to her racy outfits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blandford|2002|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extension of the tour, titled Crazy 2k, followed in March 2000. Spears premiered songs from her upcoming second album during the show.&lt;ref name=rs2/&gt;

''[[Oops!... I Did It Again]]'', her second studio album, was released in May 2000.

On January 3, 2008, Spears refused to relinquish custody of her sons to Federline's representatives.

On January 31, 2008, Spears was committed to the psychiatric ward of [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]] and put on [[5150 (Involuntary psychiatric hold)|5150 involuntary psychiatric hold]].

David Browne of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' observed &quot;Christina Aguilera may flash skin and belly button, but in her music and manner, she's too eager not to offend&amp;nbsp;— she's a good girl pretending to be bad.

It has been widely reported that Spears [[lip-sync]]s in concert. Author Gary Giddins wrote in his book ''Natural selection: Gary Giddins on comedy, film, music, and books'' (2006) that &quot;among many other performers accused of moving their lips while a machine does the labor are Britney Spears, [[Luciano Pavarotti]], Shania Twain, [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]], and Madonna.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Giddins&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Giddins|first=Gary|title=Natural selection: Gary Giddins on comedy, film, music, and books|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|page=288|year=2006|isbn=978-0-19-517951-4|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rashod D. Ollison of ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'' observes: &quot;Many pop stars&amp;nbsp;... feel they have no choice but to seek vocal enhancement. Since the advent of MTV and other video music channels, pop audiences have been fed elaborate videos thick with jaw-dropping effects, awesome choreography, fabulous clothes, marvelous bodies. And the same level of perfection is expected to extend beyond the video set to the concert stage. So if Britney Spears, Janet Jackson or Madonna sounds shrill and flat without a backing track, fans won't pay up to $300 for a concert ticket.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ollison|first=Rashod|title=The pressure to be perfect singing live ; Audiences expect CD-quality sound; Observation|newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|page=1.C|date=2004-10-26|issn=19308965|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giddins adds, &quot;it was reported Britney Spears fans prefer her to lip-sync—despite her denials of doing so (contradicted by her own director)—because they expect flawless digitalization when they pay serious money for a concert.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Giddins&quot;/&gt;

In Australia, NSW Fair Trading Minister Virginia Judge has advised disclaimers be printed on any ticket for concerts which contain any prerecorded vocals. She commented: &quot;There could have been some instances where people actually go and purchase a ticket thinking that they're going to have a live performance ... for some people that means that everything is live, it's fresh, it happens instantaneously, it's not something that's been pre-recorded.

===Influences===
{{Double image|right|RayOfLightSticky&amp;Sweet cropped.jpg|159|JanetJacksonTour.jpg|130|Madonna (''left'') and Janet Jackson (''right'') are Spears's two biggest influences.}}
Throughout her career, Spears has drawn frequent comparisons to Madonna and Janet Jackson, in terms of vocals, choreography and stage presence, citing both as influences in her work. She has also named [[Michael Jackson]] and [[Whitney Houston]] as sources of inspiration.&lt;ref name=&quot;shane&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Harrison|first=Shane|title='Britney' strengthens claim to pop tiara|newspaper=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|page=C.1|date=2001-11-06|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BMXZgFMzhe8 Britney Spears flashback - March, 1999 - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Spears: &quot;I know when I was younger, I looked up to people... like, you know, Janet Jackson and Madonna.

She's the person that I've really looked up to.

Many critics have argued that Spears should not be considered in the same league of talent as Jackson or Madonna. Journalists Erika Montalvo and Jackie Sheppard of the ''[[Rocky Mountain Collegian]]'' observed &quot;[s]ome may argue that Spears is not only a good recording artist but also an important cultural icon.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UWIRE&quot;/&gt; However, in examining her level of skill as an artist, it is questioned that &quot;[a]lthough she has been classified among female elites such as Janet Jackson and Madonna, what does Ms. Spears really have in common with these divas of rock?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UWIRE&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last1=Montalvo|first1=Erika|last2=Sheppard|first2=Jackie|title=CONCERT REVIEW: Pop's princess still reigns ... for now|newspaper=[[Rocky Mountain Collegian]]|publisher=[[UWIRE]]|date=2001-11-16|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joan Anderman of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' remarked that &quot;[t]hirteen costume changes in 90 minutes won't bless her with Madonna's intelligence or cultural barometer. An army of cutting-edge R&amp;B producers won't supply her with Janet Jackson's sense of humor or sincere smile&amp;nbsp;... Britney's heroes aren't great singers. But they're real singers. Spears sounds robotic, nearly inhuman, on her records, so processed is her voice by digital pitch-shifters and synthesizers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Anderman|first=Joan|title=BENEATH HER SEXY GROWLS, A GIRLHOOD INTERRUPTED|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|page=D.1|date=2001-12-07|issn=07431791|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporter Ed Bumgardner commented her transition from teen pop start to adult sex symbol with her third studio album ''[[Britney (album)|Britney]]'' &quot;takes its cues from two other successful performers—Madonna and Janet Jackson—both of whom she brazenly rips off and both of whom, like Spears, are passable singers, at best.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bumgardner |first=Ed|title=CONFUSED: WOMAN OR A GIRL? SPEARS CAN'T DECIDE|newspaper=[[Winston-Salem Journal]]|page=1|date=2001-11-09|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critic Shane Harrison wrote: &quot;From the minimalist thump and &quot;[[Nasty (song)|Nasty]]&quot; feel of &quot;[[I'm a Slave 4 U]]&quot; to the scattered quotes in &quot;[[Boys (Britney Spears song)|Boys]]&quot;, [''Britney''] feels like [Spears's] attempt at '[[Control (Janet Jackson album)|Control]]'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;shane&quot;/&gt;

Citing Jackson's resolve to incorporate personal and social issues into her work and Madonna's ability to constantly redefine the boundaries of socially acceptable material in the industry, Spears's catalog ultimately pales in comparison, because &quot;[w]hile Jackson and Madonna wrote their own music about subjects of importance, [Spears's] music sounds like an upbeat version of either, 'I want to grow up but the media won't let me,' or 'Here kitty, kitty, I'm wearing my underwear outside of my leather pants'-type ballads.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;UWIRE&quot;/&gt; In contrast, Guy Blackman argues that although &quot;no one would argue that Spears is some kind of pioneering pop auteur, there’s still a lot to like about her back catalogue. During her world-conquering peak, she was just about as cutting edge as you could get in the world of global pop superstardom. Spears didn’t just work with big names, she gave big names their names, and maintained her high currency in the world’s most fickle industry for years, when most aspiring starlets are lucky to manage months.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Age&quot;/&gt;

After meeting Spears face to face, Janet Jackson stated: &quot;she said to me, 'I'm such a big fan; I really admire you.' That's so flattering. Everyone gets inspiration from some place. And it's awesome to see someone else coming up who's dancing and singing, and seeing how all these kids relate to her. A lot of people put it down, but what she does is a positive thing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Elysa Gardner|title=Luscious Jackson|newspaper=USA Today|date=2000-07-28|page=1.E|issn=07347456|ref=harv|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madonna's respect for Spears has also been a subject of observation. Santiago Fouz-Hernández and Freya Jarman-Ivens, authors of ''Madonna's drowned worlds: new approaches to her cultural transformations, 1983–2003'' (2004) note that the most well known cross-generational relationship exists between Spears and Madonna in which &quot;the entertainment newsmedia almost became obsessed with their relationship of mutual admiration.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MDW&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Hernández|first=Santiago|coauthors=Freya Jarman-Ivens|title=Madonna's drowned worlds: new approaches to her cultural transformations, 1983–2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|page=162|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7546-3372-3|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biographers also report &quot;[s]ome observers of popular culture, however, feel that the comparisons between the two artist are meaningless and fail to recognize Madonna's unique contribution: Madonna was never 'just another pop star' whereas Britney can more easily be seen as a standard manufactured pop act.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;MDW&quot;/&gt;

Barbara Ellen of ''[[The Observer]]'' has reported: &quot;Spears is famously one of the 'oldest' teenagers pop has ever produced, almost middle aged in terms of focus and determination. Many 19-year-olds haven't even started working by that age, whereas Britney, a former Mouseketeer, was that most unusual and volatile of American phenomena&amp;nbsp;— a child with a full-time career. While other little girls were putting posters on their walls, Britney was wanting to be the poster on the wall.

She's an American institution, as deeply sacred and messed up as pro wrestling or the filibuster. Musically, though, Spears will always have to measure up to her own gold standards of pop euphony: the operatic slither of 2004's 'Toxic' and the candied funk of 2000's 'Oops!...I Did It Again.' Spears is no technical singer, that's for sure. But backed by Martin and Dr. Luke's wall of pound, her vocals melt into a mix of babytalk coo and coital panting that is, in its own overprocessed way, just as iconic and propulsive as [[Michael Jackson]]'s yips or [[Eminem]]'s snarls.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20475684,00.html|title=Music Review: Femme Fatale|last=Markovitz|first=Adam|work=Entertainment Weekly|publisher=Time Warner|date=2011-03-23|accessdate=2011-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Britney Spears' was [[Yahoo!]]'s most popular search term between 2005 and 2008, and has been in a total of seven different years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/entertainment/celebrity/Britney_Spears_Tops_Yahoo_Searches.html|title=Britney Spears Tops Yahoo Searches|date=2008-12-01|accessdate=2012-04-05|publisher=[[WRC-TV|NBC Washington]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spears was named as Most Searched Person in the ''Guinness World Records'' book edition 2007 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcchicago.com/entertainment/celebrity/Angelina__Brad___Britney_Set_Guinness_World_Records.html|title=Angelina, Brad &amp; Britney Set Guinness World Records|date=2008-09-15|accessdate=2012-03-06|publisher=NBC Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was later named as the most searched person of the decade 2000 – 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techdigest.tv/2009/12/britney_spears_1.html|title=Britney Spears is the most searched for celebrity of the decade|author=Gerald Lynch|date=2009-12-21|accessdate=2012-05-26|publisher=techdigest.tv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spears is the most followed person on Google's social network, [[Google+]].

Spears has been cited as a musical inspiration by contemporary artists. [[Gwyneth Paltrow]]'s character on 2010 drama film ''[[Country Strong]]'' was inspired on the singer's public meltdown. According to film director Shana Fest, &quot;that's where this movie came from. I mean, I was seeing what was happening in the media to Britney Spears.
