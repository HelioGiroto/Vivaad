'''Michael Dwayne Vick''' (born June 26, 1980) is an [[American football]] [[quarterback]] for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] of the [[National Football League]] (NFL). He played for the [[Atlanta Falcons]] for six seasons before serving time in prison for his involvement in an illegal [[dog fighting]] ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/17/AR2007071701393.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Mark | last=Maske | title=Falcons' Vick Indicted In Dogfighting Case | date=2007-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aldf.org/article.php?id=928 |title=Animal Legal Defense Fund : Animal Fighting Case Study: Michael Vick |publisher=Aldf.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vick played [[college football]] at [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Virginia Tech]], where as a freshman he placed third in the [[Heisman Trophy]] balloting. He left after his sophomore year to enter the [[National Football League|NFL]] and was drafted [[List of first overall National Football League draft picks|first overall]] by the [[Atlanta Falcons]] in the [[2001 NFL Draft]]. He became the first [[African-American]] quarterback to be selected first overall in an NFL Draft. In six seasons with the Falcons, he gained wide popularity for his performance on the field, and led the Falcons to the playoffs twice. Vick ranks first among quarterbacks in career rushing yards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2011/10/09/vick-breaks-all-time-qb-rushing-record/ | work=Fox News | title=Vick breaks all-time QB rushing record | date=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, Vick was implicated in an illegal interstate [[dog fighting in the United States|dog fighting]] ring that had operated over five years. In August 2007, he pleaded guilty to federal [[felony]] charges and served 21 months in prison, followed by two months in home confinement.&lt;ref&gt;ESPN wire services. &quot;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3148549 Apologetic Vick gets 23-month sentence on dogfighting charges]&quot;, ESPN, December 11, 2007.

He signed with the Philadelphia Eagles and was reinstated in week 3 of the [[2009 NFL season|2009 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4442627 |title=Vick eligible to play Week 3 |last= |first= |date=2009-09-03 |work=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=2009-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Vick became the Eagles' starting quarterback and led them to the 2011 NFL Playoffs as NFC East Champions. Despite starting only 11 games and only playing in 12 games, Vick set career highs in passing yards, passing percentage, QB rating, passing touchdowns, and rushing touchdowns. He was named the 2010 NFL Comeback Player of the Year and was selected to his fourth Pro Bowl.

Michael Vick married Kijafa Frink on June 30, 2012 at The Fontainebleau in [[Miami Beach, Florida]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gossipextra.com/2012/07/01/michael-vick-wedding-miami-1611/ |title=Michael Vick Ties The Knot With Longtime Fiancee in Miami Beach |publisher=Gossip Extra |date=2012-07-01 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Early years==
Vick was born in [[Newport News, Virginia]] as the second of four children to Brenda Vick and Michael Boddie, then unmarried teenagers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-now-vickdad-au23,0,1439332.story?coll=hr_tab01_layout |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071012003803/http://dailypress.com/news/dp-now-vickdad-au23,0,1439332.story?coll=hr_tab01_layout |archivedate=2007-10-12 |title=Topic Galleries - dailypress.com |publisher=Dailypress.com |date=November 2, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother worked two jobs, obtained some public financial assistance, and had help from her parents, while his father worked long hours in the shipyards as a sandblaster and spray-painter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Michael Vick |publisher=JockBio.com |url=http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Vick/Vick_bio.html |accessdate=2007-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were married when Michael was about five years old, but the children elected to continue to use their &quot;Vick&quot; surname. The family lived in the Ridley Circle Homes, a [[public housing project]] in a financially depressed and crime-ridden neighborhood located in the [[East End (Newport News)|East End]] section of the port city. A 2007 newspaper article published in the [[Richmond Times-Dispatch]] noted &quot;not much changed&quot; by observations of local people almost ten years after Michael Vick left. One resident said that there was [[drug dealing]], [[drive-by shooting]]s and other killings in the neighborhood, then suggested that [[sports]] were a way out and a dream for many.&lt;ref name=&quot;Puzzling&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=David Ress |title=Vick case puzzling |publisher=inRich.com |date=2007-07-25 |url=http://www.inRich.com/cva/ric/news/michael_vick.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-07-25–0162.html |accessdate=2007-07-31 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2001 interview, Vick told the Newport News ''Daily Press'' that when he was 10 or 11, &quot;I would go [[fishing]] even if the fish weren't biting, just to get away from the violence and stress of daily life in the projects.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Puzzling&quot; /&gt;

===Early athletic career===
During the early years of his family, Michael Boddie's employment required a lot of travel, but he taught football skills to his two sons at an early age. Vick was only three years old when his father, nicknamed &quot;Bullet&quot; for his blinding speed during his own playing days, began teaching him the fundamentals. He taught younger brother [[Marcus Vick]].

As he grew up, Vick, who as a child went by the nickname &quot;Ookie&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot; /&gt; learned about football from a second cousin four years older, [[Aaron Lafette Brooks|Aaron Brooks]]. Vick and Brooks both spent a lot of time as youths at the local [[Boys and Girls Clubs of America|Boys and Girls Club]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Dave Forster, Bill Burke and Kyle Tucker |title=Is Michael Vick friendly to a fault? |publisher=[[The Virginian-Pilot]] |date=2007-05-26 |url=http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/print.cfm?story=125491&amp;ran=117073 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080225211008/http://home.hamptonroads.com/stories/print.cfm?story=125491&amp;ran=117073 |archivedate=2008-02-25 |accessdate=2007-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a 10-year-old throwing three touchdown passes in a Boys Club league, his apparent football talents led coaches and his parents to keep special watch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Puzzling&quot; /&gt;

Vick told ''Sporting News'' magazine in an interview published April 9, 2001: &quot;Sports kept me off the streets...It kept me from getting into what was going on, the bad stuff. Lots of guys I knew have had bad problems.&quot;

===High school===
Vick first came to prominence while at [[Homer L. Ferguson High School]] in Newport News. As a freshman, he impressed many with his athletic ability, throwing for over 400 yards in a game that year. Ferguson High School was closed in 1996 as part of a [[Newport News Public Schools]] building modernization program. Vick, as a sophomore, and [[Tommy Reamon]] both moved to [[Warwick High School (Newport News)|Warwick High School]].

At Warwick High School, under Reamon's tutelage, Vick was a three-year starter for the Raiders, passing for 4,846 yards with 43 touchdowns. He ran for six touchdowns and threw for three touchdowns in a single game. He added 1,048 yards and 18 scores on the ground. As a senior, he passed for 1,668 yards, accounting for ten passing and ten rushing touchdowns.

Reamon, who had helped guide Brooks from Newport News to the [[University of Virginia]], helped Michael with his [[SAT]]s and helped him and his family choose between [[Syracuse University]] and [[Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University|Virginia Tech]]. Reamon favored Virginia Tech, where he felt better guidance was available under [[Frank Beamer]], who promised to [[redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] him and provide the freshman needed time to develop. Reamon sold Michael on the school's proximity to family and friends,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bio&quot; /&gt; and Vick chose to attend Virginia Tech.

As he left the Newport News public housing projects in 1998, &quot;on the wings of a college football scholarship,&quot; Vick was seen in the Newport News community as a &quot;success story.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Puzzling&quot; /&gt; In a story published in September 2000, while Vick was at Virginia Tech, Michael Boddie told the university's ''Collegiate Times'': &quot;Ever since he learned to throw a football, he's always liked throwing a ball...It's just in his blood.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Eric Lucey |title=Virginia Tech's Vick goes from 'Ookie' to Heisman hopeful |publisher=''The Collegiate Times'' (Virginia Tech) |date=2000-09-01 |url=http://www.uwire.com/content/topsports090100001.html |accessdate=2007-07-31 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060116001616/http://www.uwire.com/content/topsports090100001.html |archivedate = January 16, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College career==
In his first collegiate game as a [[redshirt (college sports)|redshirt]] freshman against [[James Madison Dukes football|James Madison]] in [[1999 NCAA Division I-A football season|1999]], Vick scored three rushing [[touchdown]]s in just over one quarter of play. His last touchdown was a spectacular flip in which he landed awkwardly on his ankle, forcing him to miss the remainder of the game in addition to the following game. During the season, Vick led a last-minute game-winning drive against [[1999 West Virginia Mountaineers football team|West Virginia]] in the annual [[Black Diamond Trophy]] game. He led the [[Virginia Tech Hokies football|Hokies]] to an 11–0 season and to the [[BCS National Championship|Bowl Championship Series national title game]] in the [[2000 Sugar Bowl|Nokia Sugar Bowl]] against [[1999 Florida State Seminoles football team|Florida State]]. Although Virginia Tech lost 46–29, Vick was able to bring the team back from a 21 point deficit to take a brief lead. During the season, Vick appeared on the cover of an ''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' issue.

Vick led the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] in [[passing efficiency]] that year, setting a record for a freshman (180.4), which was good enough for the third-highest all-time mark. Vick was awarded an [[ESPY Award]] as the nation's top college player and won the first-ever [[Archie Griffin Award]] as college football's [[most valuable player]]. He was invited to the 1999 [[Heisman Trophy]] presentation and finished third in the voting behind [[Ron Dayne]] and [[Joe Hamilton (American football)|Joe Hamilton]]. Vick's third place finish matched the highest finish ever by a freshman up to that point, first set by [[Herschel Walker]] in 1980. [[File:Virginia Tech Lane Stadium press box 2003.jpg|thumb|Lane Stadium, where Vick played his college games]] Vick's [[2000 NCAA Division I-A football season|2000]] season had highlights, such as his career rushing high of 210 yards against the [[Boston College Eagles football|Boston College]] in [[Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts]]. Against [[West Virginia University]] in the [[Black Diamond Trophy]] game, Vick accounted for 288 total yards of offense and two touchdowns in a 48–20 win. The following week, Vick led the Hokies from a 14–0 deficit against {{cfb link|title=Syracuse|team=Syracuse Orange|year=1999}} at the [[Carrier Dome]], where the Hokies had not won since 1986. Vick put the game away with a 55-yard run with 1:34 left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hokiesports.com/football/recaps/10222000aaa.html |title=Tech puts end to Carrier Dome hex |date=2000-10-22 |accessdate=2007-08-29 |last=Robertson |first=Jimmy |publisher=hokiesports.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following game against [[1999 Pittsburgh Panthers football team|Pittsburgh]], Vick was injured and had to miss the rest of the game as well as the entire game against {{cfb link|team=UCF Knights|school=University of Central Florida|year=1999|title=Central Florida}}, and was unable to start against the [[1999 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami Hurricanes]], the Hokies' lone loss of the season. Vick's final game at Virginia Tech came against the [[1999 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson Tigers]] in the [[Toyota Gator Bowl]], where he was named MVP of the game.

Vick left Virginia Tech after his redshirt sophomore season. Aware that the rest of his family was still living in their 3 bedroom apartment in the Ridley Circle Homes, Vick stated that he was going to buy his mother &quot;a home and a car.&quot; ESPN later reported that Vick used some of his NFL and endorsement earnings to buy his mother a brand-new house in an upscale section of [[Suffolk, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/columns/story?columnist=wojciechowski_gene&amp;id=2287414 |title=ESPN - Common lives, plenty of questions for Vick, Clarett - Columnist |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |author=Gene WojciechowskiESPN.com (Archive) |date= |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At his [[Pro Day]] workout, Vick ran the [[40-yard dash]] in an astonishing 4.33 seconds; his time has been clocked as low as 4.25, the fastest 40 time of any quarterback ever in the NFL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Boren, Cindy |title=Cindy Boren's Twitter account |url=https://twitter.com/#!/CindyBoren/status/173789420653264898 |publisher=[[Twitter]] |date=February 26, 2012 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Boren, Cindy |title=Cindy Boren's Twitter account |url=https://twitter.com/#!/CindyBoren/status/173837141107949568 |publisher=[[Twitter]] |date=February 26, 2012 |accessdate=2012-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vick was selected [[List of first overall National Football League draft picks|first]] in the [[2001 NFL Draft]] by the [[Atlanta Falcons]]. The [[San Diego Chargers]] had the number one selection but traded the rights to the first overall choice to the Atlanta Falcons a day before the draft, for which they received the Falcons' first round pick (5th overall) and third round pick in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Barry Wilner |title=Manning NFL MVP again: 49 TDs, passing rating of 121.1 make Colts QB near-unanimous pick |publisher=The Decatur Daily |date=2005-01-11 |url=http://www.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/sports/050111/nfl.shtml |accessdate=2007-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vick was drafted in the 30th round of the [[2000 Major League Baseball Draft|2000 MLB Draft]] by the [[Colorado Rockies]], despite not playing baseball since the 8th grade.

Vick and teammate RB Warrick Dunn (1,140) became the first quarterback/running back duo to each surpass 1,000 rushing yards in a single season.

[[Image:Michael Vick, November 2006 (1).jpg|left|thumb|upright|Vick as a Falcon in November 2006.]]

Vick made his NFL debut at [[2001 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco]] on September 9, 2001 and saw limited action. He completed his first NFL pass to WR [[Tony Martin (football player)|Tony Martin]] in the second quarter vs. [[2001 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina]] on September 23 and first NFL touchdown on a two-yard rushing score in the fourth quarter to help the Falcons to a 24–16 victory. Vick made his first start at [[2001 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas]] on November 11 and threw his first touchdown pass to [[Tight end|TE]] [[Alge Crumpler]] in a 20–13 victory. In his two starts of the eight games played that season, Vick completed 50 of 113 passes for 785 yards with two touchdowns and three interceptions, accounting for 234 of the team's 255 yards at the team's season finale at [[2001 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis]] on January 6, 2002. He rushed 29 times for 289 yards (9.9 avg.) and one touchdown.
In 2002, Vick was named to the [[2003 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] after starting 15 games, missing a game to the [[2002 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] on October 13 with a sprained shoulder. He completed 231 of 421 passes for 2,936 yards (both career-highs) and 16 touchdowns with 113 carries for 777 yards and eight touchdowns. Vick established numerous single-game career highs, including passes completed with 24 and pass attempts with 46 at [[2002 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh]] on November 10, as well as passing yards with 337 vs. [[2002 Detroit Lions season|Detroit]] on December 22. He completed 74 yards for a touchdown to WR [[Trevor Gaylor]] vs. [[2002 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans]] on November 17. Vick registered an NFL record for most rushing yards by a quarterback in a single a game with 173 at [[Minnesota Vikings|Minnesota]] on December 1. Vick tied for third in team history for the lowest interception percentage in a season at 1.90 and continued a streak of consecutive passes without an interception that began at St. Louis on January 6, 2002 in the season finale of the 2001 season and extended to the first quarter vs. [[2002 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore]] on November 3, 2002. His streak covered 25 straight quarters and 177 passes without an interception. On January 1, 2003, Vick led the Atlanta Falcons to an upset victory over the heavily favored [[2002 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay]] 27–7 in the [[2002–03 NFL playoffs|NFC playoffs]], ending the Packers' undefeated playoff record at [[Lambeau Field]].

In Week 13, Vick made his season debut in relief of QB [[Doug Johnson (football player)|Doug Johnson]] in the third quarter at [[2003 Houston Texans season|Houston]] on November 30, completing 8 of 11 passes for 60 yards and recording 16 rushing yards on three carries. He posted his first start of the season vs. [[2003 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina]] on December 7 and amassed the third-highest rushing total by a quarterback in NFL history with 141 yards on 14 carries and one score to lead the Falcons to a 21–14 victory. He completed 16 of 33 passes for 179 yards and accounted for 320 of the team's 380 offensive yards. Vick closed out the season with a 21–14 victory vs. [[2003 Jacksonville Jaguars season|Jacksonville]] on December 28, where he completed 12 of 22 passes for 180 yards with two touchdowns and one interception.

In [[2004 Atlanta Falcons season|2004]], Vick was named to his second [[2005 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] after starting 15 games, completing 181 of 321 passes for 2,313 yards with 14 touchdowns and 12 interceptions. He rushed 120 times for 902 yards and three scores. His 902 rushing yards ranked third all-time by NFL QBs. His 7.5 yards per carry rank first among all NFL players.

====Suspension====
In August 2007, hours after Vick pleaded guilty to federal charges in the Bad Newz Kennels [[dog fighting]] investigation, the NFL suspended him indefinitely without pay for violating the [[National Football League player conduct controversy|NFL player conduct policy]]. In a letter to Vick, Commissioner [[Roger Goodell]] said that Vick had admitted to conduct that was &quot;not only illegal, but also cruel and reprehensible.&quot; While Vick was technically a first-time offender under the NFL's Personal Conduct Policy, Goodell handed down a harsher suspension because Vick admitted that he provided most of the money for the [[gambling]] side of the operation. Goodell left open the possibility of reinstating Vick depending on how he cooperated with federal and state authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assets.espn.go.com/media/pdf/070824/michaelvickletter.pdf |title=NFL to Michael Vick c/o Joel Segal, President, Worldwide Entertainment |accessdate=2007-11-07 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodell had barred Vick from reporting to training camp while the league conducted its own investigation into the matter. At his July 26 arraignment, the terms of his bail barred him from leaving [[Virginia]] before the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2965298 |title=ESPN - SCLC will not recognize Vick at Atlanta convention - NFL |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |agency=Associated Press |date= |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, Falcons owner [[Arthur Blank]] said in a press conference that the Falcons would seek to recover a portion of Vick's signing bonus. He said the team had no immediate plans to cut ties with Vick, citing salary-cap issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2992890 |title=Vick to be sentenced Dec. 10 after guilty plea |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2007-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It initially appeared that Goodell had cleared the way for the Falcons to release Vick, since he ruled that Vick's involvement in gambling activity breached his contract. On August 29, the Falcons sent a letter to Vick demanding that he reimburse them for $20 million of the $37 million bonus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2996417 |title=Falcons asking for $20 million; experts say it could be only $3.5M |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=2007-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was sent to arbitration, and on October 10, an arbitrator ruled that Vick had to reimburse the Falcons for $19.97 million. The arbitrator agreed with the Falcons' contentions that Vick knew he was engaging in illegal activity when he signed his new contract in 2004, and that he had used the bonus money to pay for the operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d8031ee14&amp;template=without |title=Arbitrator rules Falcons can recoup nearly $20 million in Vick bonus money |publisher=NFL.com |accessdate=2007-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, the Falcons revealed that they were exploring trade scenarios to another NFL club for Vick. Team general manager [[Thomas Dimitroff]] pointed out that NFL rules allow teams to trade the contractual rights of suspended players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Falcons trying to trade Vick|work=Daily Press|date=2009-02-13|url=http://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-now-vick.0215,0,215733.story|accessdate=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3905354 |title=Atlanta Falcons preparing to trade Michael Vick's rights - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2009-02-14 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Falcons released Vick in early June, making him an unrestricted free agent.

}}After his release from prison, Vick was mentored by former Colts coach [[Tony Dungy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dungy's Diaries-A Different Kind of August |url=http://www.allprodad.com/dungy/?p=374}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The prospects of Vick returning to play professional football were the subject of much conjecture.  In 2007, ESPN's [[John Clayton (sportscaster)|John Clayton]] said that few general managers were in a strong enough position to consider taking a chance on Vick, and even then most NFL owners would be concerned about a fan and media backlash.  He also noted that there was no chance of him resurrecting his career in the [[Canadian Football League]]. In 2007, following a furor over [[Ricky Williams]] being allowed to play there, it banned players currently suspended by the NFL. Even without that to consider, it is nearly impossible for a convicted felon to get a Canadian work visa.  He did think, however, that Vick would be &quot;unstoppable&quot; if he ever decided to play in the [[Arena Football League]].&lt;ref&gt;[[John Clayton (sportscaster)|Clayton, John]].

On August 13, 2009, Vick signed a one-year contract with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Vick, Eagles agree to 2-year deal |publisher=ESPN |date=2009-08-14 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4397938 |accessdate=2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; He earned $1.6 million, of which no amount was guaranteed. The contract contained a team option for the 2010 season worth $5 million. Vick was able to participate in all team practices and meetings as well as the Eagles' last two preseason games. He was eligible to play in the third week of the regular season. [[Donovan McNabb]] told reporters he gave coach [[Andy Reid]] the idea to sign Vick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ford |first=Bob |url=http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/eagles/20091208_Bob_Ford__McNabb_in_search_of_redemption__too.html |title=McNabb |publisher=Philly.com |date=2009-12-08 |accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was placed on the exempt/commissioner's permission list on September 5, 2009. On September 15, Vick was activated to the 53-man roster. He played sparingly as McNabb's backup. In week 13, against the Falcons, Vick threw a touchdown and ran for a touchdown, his first scores since December 2006. In December 2009, Vick became the [[Ed Block Courage Award]] recipient for the Eagles, an award voted by teammates. The award honors players who &quot;exemplify commitment to the principles of sportsmanship and courage.&quot; Vick said of the award, &quot;It means a great deal to me. I was voted unanimously by my teammates. They know what I've been through. I've been through a lot. It's been great to come back and have an opportunity to play and be with a great group of guys. I'm just ecstatic about that and I enjoy every day.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4767825 |title=Ed Block award |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2009-12-24 |accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vick wins Eagles' courage award |agency=Associated Press |date=December 23, 2009 |url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/Michael-Vick-Eagles-courage-award-122309 |accessdate=2009-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 9, 2010, in the Eagles' NFC Wildcard game against the [[2009 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]], Vick threw the longest touchdown pass of his career, connecting in the second quarter with rookie [[Jeremy Maclin]] for a 76-yard score.

On January 11, 2010, Reid named Donovan McNabb the Eagles' 2010 starter, but after McNabb was traded to the [[Washington Redskins]], [[Kevin Kolb]] was named the starter with Vick again second string.  Vick said, &quot;I know I can still play at a high level.&quot; When asked if he wanted the Eagles to pick up the second year of his contract, he replied, &quot;I hope so...I feel like I'm probably better than I ever was in my career, as far as the mental aspect of the game.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4816179 |title=Eagles: Mcnabb starter for 2010 |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2010-01-11 |accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 9, 2010, the Eagles exercised his option for 2010 and Vick received a $1.5 million roster bonus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Eagles pick up Vick's option for 2010 |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/mar/09/eagles-pick-up-vicks-option-for-2010/ |agency=Associated Press |date=March 9, 2010 |accessdate=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 21, 2010, Reid named Vick the Eagles' starting quarterback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2010/09/eagles-name-michael-vick-starting-qb-bench-kevin-kolb/1 |title=Eagles name Michael Vick starting QB, bench Kevin Kolb - The Huddle: Football News from the NFL - USATODAY.com |publisher=Content.usatoday.com |date=2010-09-21 |accessdate=2010-09-26 |first=Sean |last=Leahy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his second game as a starter versus the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], Vick led the Eagles to a 28–3 win, throwing for 291 yards and three touchdowns as well as rushing for a touchdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/2010092610/2010/REG3/eagles@jaguars#tab:analyze |title=NFL Game Center: Philadelphia Eagles at Jacksonville Jaguars - 2010 Week 3|publisher=National Football League |date=2010-09-26 |accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named the NFC Offensive Player of the Month for the month of September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Goldman, Josh |title=Vick, Allen Honored For September Play |url=http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story.asp?story_id=22037 |work=philadelphiaeagles.com |date=September 29, 2010 |accessdate=2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vick suffered a rib cartilage injury in a week 4 game against the Redskins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eagles QB Vick Has Rib Cartilage Injury|url=http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2010/10/04/sports/football/AP-FBN-Eagles-Injuries.html|accessdate=4 October 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was replaced by Kolb.

==Early controversies and crimes==
Between his selection by the Atlanta Falcons in the 2001 NFL Draft and early 2007, Vick was allegedly involved in several incidents:
*In 2007, statements were made by his father, Michael Boddie, about possible dogfighting activities in 2001. Boddie told the ''[[Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]'' that around 2001, Vick was staging dogfights in the garage of the family's home in Newport News and kept fighting dogs in the family's backyard, including injured ones which the father nursed back to health. Boddie said his son had been urged to not engage in the activity, but continued. He stated: &quot;This is Mike's thing. And he knows it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;vickdaddailypress&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-now-vickdad-au23,0,1439332.story?coll=hr_tab01_layout |title=Vick's father says son has staged dogfights since 2001 |publisher=Wire Reports via the Daily Press |date=2007-08-23 |accessdate=2007-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days, Vick's mother, Brenda Vick Boddie, told the ''Newport News Daily Press'' &quot;There was no dogfighting (at our home).

*In early 2004, two men were arrested in Virginia for distributing [[marijuana]]. The truck they were driving was registered to Vick. Falcons coach [[Dan Reeves]] recalled that he lectured Vick at that time on the importance of reputation, on choosing the right friends, and on staying out of trouble for the good of his team.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajcvickbio&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Alan Judd |title=In game of life, Vick blitzed by trouble |publisher=''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' |date=2007-07-22 |url=http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/falcons/stories/2007/07/21/0722vickbio.html |accessdate=2007-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On October 10, 2004, Vick and other members of his party, including employee Quanis Phillips, were at Atlanta's [[Hartsfield International Airport]] on their way to board an AirTran flight. While they were passing through a security checkpoint, a security camera caught Phillips and Todd Harris picking up an expensive-appearing watch which belonged to Alvin Spencer, a security screener.&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpostairport&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A30000-2005Mar12?language=printer |title=A Commonplace Case Complicated by Fame |date=2005-03-13 |accessdate=2007-08-25 |coauthors=Maske, Mark and Goo, Sara Kehaulani |publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; After watching the theft on a video tape, Spencer filed a police report.

*In March 2005, Sonya Elliott filed a civil lawsuit against Vick alleging she contracted [[genital herpes]] from him in the autumn of 2002 and that he failed to inform her that he had the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Michael Vick Hit With Sex Suit |publisher=The Smoking Gun |date=2006-10-26 |url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/crime/michael-vick-hit-sex-suit |accessdate=2007-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elliot further alleged that Vick had visited clinics under the alias &quot;Ron Mexico&quot; to get treatments and thus knew of his condition. On April 24, 2006, Vick's attorney, Lawrence Woodward, revealed that the lawsuit had been settled out of court under undisclosed terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/12468203/ |date=2006-04-26 |title=Settlement reached in Michael Vick herpes case |agency=Associated Press |accessdate=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many fans bought custom jerseys from NFL.com with Vick's number 7 and the name &quot;MEXICO&quot; on the back.

*November 26, 2006 – After a loss to the [[New Orleans Saints]] in the [[Georgia Dome]], in apparent reaction to fans booing, Vick made an [[finger (gesture)|obscene gesture]] at fans, holding up two middle fingers.

A search warrant executed on April 25, 2007 as part of a drug investigation of Vick's cousin Davon Boddie led to discovery of evidence of unlawful [[dog fighting in the United States|dog fighting]] activities at a property owned by Vick in rural [[Surry County, Virginia|Surry County]] in southeastern [[Virginia]], with extensive dogfighting facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajcvickbio&quot; /&gt; Widespread media publicity quickly gained momentum as state officials investigated, soon joined by federal authorities with their own investigation. As the separate state and federal investigations progressed, more and more details of the operations of an interstate dog fighting ring were revealed, with some portions involving drugs and gambling. Gruesome details involving abuse, torture and execution of under-performing dogs galvanized [[animal rights]] activists and expressions of public outrage. Vick and several others were indicted on both federal and [[Virginia]] [[felony]] charges related to the operation.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;!--We know it's true, but put sources anyway!--&gt;

===Federal criminal prosecution===
[[File:Dogfighting.ogg|thumb|Speech by Senator [[Robert Byrd]] made to U.S. Senate following the indictment of Michael Vick on federal dog fighting charges]]
In July 2007, Vick and three other men were charged by federal authorities with [[felony]] charges of operating an unlawful [[interstate commerce|interstate]] [[dog fighting]] venture known as &quot;[[Bad Newz Kennels dog fighting investigation|Bad Newz Kennels]].&quot; Vick was accused of financing the operation, directly participating in dog fights and executions, and personally handling thousands of dollars in related [[gambling]] activities. Federal prosecutors indicated they intended to proceed under the powerful provisions of the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO), a [[United States federal law]] that provides for extended criminal penalties and a civil [[cause of action]] for acts performed as part of an ongoing [[criminal organization]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;!--We know it's true, but put sources anyway!--&gt;

====Convictions====
By August 20, Vick and the other three co-defendants agreed to separate [[plea bargain]]s for the federal charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPNPlea&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2983121 |title=Vick faces prison time after agreeing to plead guilty |date=2007-08-21 |accessdate=2007-08-25 |publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,293826,00.html |title=Vick Agrees to Plead Guilty to Dogfighting Charges |date=2007-08-20 |accessdate=2007-08-25 |publisher=Associated Press via Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were expected to each receive federal prison sentences between 12 months and five years.

On August 24, Vick filed plea documents with the federal court. He pleaded guilty to &quot;Conspiracy to Travel in Interstate Commerce in Aid of Unlawful Activities and to Sponsor a Dog in an Animal Fighting Venture&quot;. He admitted to providing most of the financing for the operation and to participating directly in several dog fights in [[Virginia]], [[Maryland]], [[North Carolina]] and [[South Carolina]]. He admitted to sharing in the proceeds from these dog fights. He further admitted that he knew his colleagues killed several dogs who did not perform well. He admitted to being involved in the destruction of 6–8 dogs, by hanging or drowning.  The &quot;victimization and killing of pit bulls&quot; was considered as aggravating circumstances that led prosecutors to exceed the federal sentencing guidelines for the charge. He denied placing any side bets on the dogfights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2989824 |title=ESPN - Vick pleads to dog fighting charge; says he did not make 'side bets' - NFL |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |author=ESPN.com news services |date= |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 27, [[United States federal judge|U.S. District Judge]] Henry E. Hudson accepted Vick's guilty plea.

====Failed drug test====
While free on bail, Vick tested positive for marijuana in a random drug test. This was a violation of the conditions of his release while awaiting sentencing in federal court for his felony conviction. Vick's positive urine sample was submitted September 13, 2007, according to a document by a federal probation officer that was filed in U.S. District Court on September 26. As a result, Hudson ordered Vick confined to his [[Hampton, Virginia]] home&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cms.ibj.com/ASPXPages/6iframes/FrontEndArticlesDetailPage.aspx?ArticleID=04965&amp;NoFrame=1 |title=ibj.com Indianapolis Business Journal South Bend bank sues Falcons quarterback Vick |publisher=Cms.ibj.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m. with electronic monitoring until his court hearing date in December. He was ordered to submit to random drug testing.

====Incarceration begins====
In November, Vick turned himself in early to begin getting time-served credit against his likely federal prison sentence. He was held at Northern Neck Regional Jail in [[Warsaw, Virginia]] awaiting sentencing on the federal convictions on December 10, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/falcons/2007-11-19-vick-surrender_N.htm |title=Michael Vick surrenders to federal authorities |accessdate=2007-11-19 | work=USA Today | first=Gary | last=Mihoces | date=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sentencing and prison====
On December 10, Vick appeared in U.S. District Court in Richmond for sentencing. Judge Hudson said he was &quot;convinced that it was not a momentary lack of judgment&quot; on Vick's part, and that Vick was a &quot;full partner&quot; in the dog fighting ring, and he was sentenced to serve 23 months in federal prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/law/12/10/vick.sentenced/index.html Vick sentenced to 23 months for dogfighting] CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt; Hudson noted that, despite Vick's claims that he accepted responsibility for his actions, his failure to cooperate fully with federal officials, coupled with a failed drug test and a failed polygraph, showed that Vick had not accepted full responsibility for &quot;promoting, funding and facilitating this cruel and inhumane sporting activity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc-Boost&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/falcons/stories/2007/12/10/vick_1211.html?cxntlid=homepage_tab_newstab |title=Vick's Lies Boosted Prison Time |accessdate=2007-12-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071211090042/http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/falcons/stories/2007/12/10/vick_1211.html?cxntlid=homepage_tab_newstab |archivedate = December 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vick was assigned to [[United States Penitentiary, Leavenworth]], a federal prison facility in [[Leavenworth, Kansas]] to serve his sentence.&lt;ref name=&quot;sports.espn.go.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3185291 |title=Vick enters drug treatment program at Kansas prison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fraudulent misappropriation of funds====
At the request of federal authorities before sentencing, Vick agreed to deposit nearly $1 million in an escrow account with attorneys for use to reimburse costs of caring for the confiscated dogs, most of which were being offered for adoption on a selective basis under supervision of a court-appointed specialist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: Vick to pay for dog care|url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=txvicksdogs|publisher=Yahoo! Sports|accessdate=July 19, 2011|date=November 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experts said some of the animals will require individual care for the rest of their lives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/21333877/ Dogs in Vick case to be spayed, neutered - NFL- NBC Sports&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; During his bankruptcy trial, the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] complained that these funds were paid at least partially with unlawfully withdrawn monies which Vick held in trust for himself and eight other employees of MV7, a celebrity marketing company he owns.

===State criminal prosecution===
Separate [[Virginia]] charges against all four men were placed following indictments by the Surry County grand jury when it met on September 25, 2007. The principal evidence considered was the sworn statements of the defendants during their plea agreement process before the federal court, although the indictments are for different charges. Vick was charged with two class 6 felonies, which carry a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment for each charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/news/vatechshootings.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2007-09-25–0204.html |title=Virgian Tech shootings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Citing the high costs and transportation logistics of proceeding while he was still in federal prisons out of state, the prosecutor, Gerald Poindexter, decided to postpone Vick's trial in Surry County Circuit Court until after his release from federal custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.newsadvance.com/news/2008/jun/26/surry_prosecutor_still_pursues_vick-ar-221550/ |title=Surry prosecutor still pursues Vick |publisher=Newsadvance.com |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vick's attorneys sought to resolve the state charges sooner. On October 14, 2008, Woodward filed a motion to enter a plea via two-way electronic video with the Surry County Courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-local_vick_1022oct22,0,506971.story |title=Vick could end term in halfway house |publisher=Dailypress.com |author=VERONICA GORLEY CHUFO |date=November 2, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-02}}{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vick planned to plead guilty to state charges in an effort to get early release from federal prison and enter a halfway house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hamptonroads.com/2008/10/michael-vick-plans-guilty-plea-state-dogfighting-charges |title=Michael Vick plans guilty plea to state dogfighting charges |publisher=Hamptonroads.com |author=Tim McGlone |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The request for a trial without Vick physically present was denied. Poindexter agreed to hold the state trial while Vick was still in federal custody if he bore the costs of his transportation to [[Virginia]] and related expenses.

====State trial and sentencing====
In late November 2008, Vick was transported to [[Virginia]] to face state charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;hamptonroads.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Forster |first=Dave |url=http://hamptonroads.com/2008/11/michael-vicks-lawyers-tell-court-he-expects-return-nfl |title=Michael Vick's lawyers tell court he expects to return to NFL &amp;#124; HamptonRoads.com &amp;#124; PilotOnline.com |publisher=HamptonRoads.com |date=2008-11-14 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 25, he appeared before the Surry County Circuit Court at a session held in neighboring [[Sussex County, Virginia|Sussex County]] because the Surry court building was undergoing renovation. He submitted a guilty plea to a single Virginia felony charge for dog fighting, receiving a 3 year prison sentence, imposition of which was suspended upon condition of good behavior, and a $2500 fine. In return for the plea agreement, the other charge was dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailypress.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailypress.com/news/dp-local_vick_1126nov26,0,6077553.story |title=Topic Galleries |publisher=dailypress.com |date= |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Dwayne Vick, [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] (BOP) ID# 33765-183, was released on July 20, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;FirstName=Michael&amp;Middle=&amp;LastName=Vick&amp;Race=U&amp;Sex=U&amp;Age=&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 Michael Dwayne Vick].&quot; [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]. Retrieved on January 6, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political activity===
Vick has lobbied for H.R. 2492, the Animal Fighting Spectator Prohibition Act, which would establish federal misdemeanor penalties against convicted spectators of illegal animal fighting and make it a felony for adults to bring children to fights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2011/US/07/19/washington.dog.fighting.vick/index.html?hpt=po_bn1|title= Michael Vick backs bill targeting dog fight spectators|author= Paul Courson |date= 19 July 2011|work= CNN|publisher= |accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a night-time news show on Sean Hannity, news correspondent [[Tucker Carlson]] responded to Obama's dialogue with the chairman of [[Philadelphia Eagles]]. In the show, Carlson called for Vick to be executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5967015 |title=Fox's Tucker Carlson says Michael Vick of Philadelphia Eagles 'should be executed' for dogfighting - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2010-12-30 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial troubles==
At the end of 2006, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine estimated Vick's annual income between his NFL salary and endorsements at $25.4 million, ranking him just below NASCAR's [[Dale Earnhardt, Jr.]] in a listing of highest earning athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.link757.com/node/200141 |title=Michael Vick still fighting hefty lawsuit over contract |publisher=Link757.com |date=2006-12-26 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were problems in Vick's affairs with poor financial management, bad investments, and lawsuits. A $45 million dollar lawsuit was pending in a dispute with his original sports agents. Several lucrative endorsement deals apparently soured.

After the dog fighting indictments were announced in July 2007, financial claims against Vick escalated. While in prison, Vick's income was reduced to wages of less than a dollar a day. With affairs severely affected by lost income, legal expenses, litigation, and mismanagement by a series of friends and financial advisers, he was unable to meet scheduled payments and other obligations. Within several months, Vick had been named in numerous lawsuits by banks and creditors for defaulting on loans, some relating to business investments.

The dog fighting property near [[Smithfield, Virginia]] had been liquidated earlier, and in November 2007, Vick attempted to sell another of his homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3071572 |title=ESPN - Vick hoping to get $4.5 million for sale of lakefront Georgia home - NFL |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |author=Len PasquarelliESPN.com (Archive) |date= |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As he served his sentence in the federal penitentiary in Leavenworth, Kansas, friends and family continued to occupy some of the other homes in the [[South Beach]] section of [[Miami Beach, Florida]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/item_syfN9P2JvBoKIza35RvxnN |title=SOUTH BEACH BITE- New York Post |publisher=Nypost.com |date=November 2, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and multiple locations in Virginia. In June 2008, when his brother Marcus was arrested and jailed in [[Norfolk, Virginia|Norfolk]] after a police chase, he listed his residence as a $1.39 million home owned by Vick in an exclusive riverfront community in [[Suffolk, Virginia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dailypress1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailypress.com/news/local/newport_news/dp-local_vickconference_1004oct04,0,5471960.story |title=Bankruptcy : Bankruptcy News and Photos - dailypress.com |publisher=Dailypress.com |date=November 2, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-02}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of a new riverfront home took place on land Vick owned in another exclusive section of Suffolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wvec.com/news/local/stories/wvec_local_071907_vick_suffolk_home.8f3ab30a.html |title=Indicted NFL star Vick building home in Suffolk |publisher=Wvec.com |accessdate=2008-11-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080205103904/http://www.wvec.com/news/local/stories/wvec_local_071907_vick_suffolk_home.8f3ab30a.html |archivedate = February 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; His attorneys later estimated that he was spending $30,000 a month to support seven friends and relatives, including his mother and brother, three children, and their mothers.&lt;ref name=&quot;hamptonroads.com&quot; /&gt;

===Bankruptcy===
On July 7, 2008, Vick sought [[Chapter 11 bankruptcy]] protection&lt;ref name=&quot;bankruptcy1&quot;/&gt; in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Newport News after failing to &quot;work out consensual resolutions with each of his creditors,&quot; according to court papers. The initial filing, which was incomplete, listed assets of less than $50 million and debt of $10 million to $50 million. The seven largest creditors without collateral backing their claims are owed a total of $12.8 million. The three biggest unsecured creditors were Joel Enterprises Inc., owed $4.5 million for breach of contract; Atlanta Falcons, owed $3.75 million for &quot;pro-rated signing bonus;&quot; and [[Royal Bank of Canada]], owed $2.5 million for a loan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/index.html?Intro=intro3 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070517104557/http://www.bloomberg.com/index.html?Intro=intro3 |archivedate=2007-05-17 |title=Bloomberg.com |publisher=Bloomberg.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Major financial obligations====
Although dozens of creditors were listed in the initial bankruptcy filing, several stood out as major.

Joel Enterprises of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]] was listed by Vick as one of his larger creditors. Sports agents Andrew Joel and Dave Lowman claimed Vick signed a contract with their firm in 2001, nine days before he announced he was leaving Virginia Tech early and declaring himself eligible for the NFL Draft. With his mother as a witness, Vick signed a five-year marketing agreement that anticipated a wide range of endorsement activities using Vick's name, likeness, voice and reputation. Joel's cut would be 25% of all deals, excluding Vick's NFL contract, according to the agreement.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hamptonroads.com/node/200141 |title=Michael Vick still fighting hefty lawsuit over contract |publisher=HamptonRoads.com |date=2006-12-26 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Vick attempted to end the relationship with Joel Enterprises suddenly a few weeks later, and entered into another relationship with other agents. In 2005, Joel Enterprises sued Vick in Richmond Circuit Court for $45 million in compensatory and punitive damages for &quot;breach of contract&quot; . After the [[Virginia Supreme Court]] denied a Vick motion and ruled that the civil trial could proceed in December 2006,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot; /&gt; the parties both agreed to submit the dispute to [[binding arbitration]] for resolution instead of a formal civil court trial. The outcome of the case was an award of $4.5 million to Joel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McGlone |first=Tim |url=http://hamptonroads.com/node/504384 |title=Michael Vick eyes return to field this season, lawyer says |publisher=HamptonRoads.com |date=2009-04-03 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Atlanta Falcons sought to recover a portion of Vick's $37 million 2004 signing bonus. A reduced amount of $20 million was awarded to the Falcons in binding legal arbitration, which Vick disputed. The amount was reduced by an agreement between the parties that Vick will pay the Falcons between $6.5 and $7.5 million, the variance depending upon the outcome of a pending court case which is similar yet unrelated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/29966430/ |title=Vick will pay Falcons $6.5 million to be released |publisher=nbcsports.msnbc.com |date=2009-03-31 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bankruptcy court was advised of this Vick-Falcons settlement agreement on April 3, 2009.

On September 26, 2007, [[1st Source|1st Source Bank]], based in [[South Bend, Indiana]], claimed in a federal lawsuit that it had suffered damages of at least $2 million as Vick and Divine Seven [[Limited liability company|LLC]] of Atlanta had refused to pay for at least 130 vehicles acquired to be used as [[car rental|rental cars]].

On March 25, 2009, the [[United States Department of Labor]] filed a lawsuit in federal district court in Newport News, alleging that Vick and others violated federal employee benefits law taking funds in the amount of $1.35 million in withdrawals from the retirement plan sponsored by MV7, one of his companies. The money held was in trust under pension laws to fund retirement plans for nine current or former employees of MV7. The Labor Department simultaneously filed an adversary complaint in federal bankruptcy court to prevent Vick from discharging his alleged debt to the MV7 pension plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxbusiness.com/story/labor-department-sues-nfl-player-bankruptcy-court-recover-pension-assets/ U.S. Labor Department sues former NFL player and others in bankruptcy court to recover pension assets]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}, [[Fox Business]], March 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint alleged that some of the funds were used to pay restitution ordered in his dogfighting conspiracy case.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/fb/texansfront/6343048.html Vick is in more hot water - Feds claim QB illegally spent pension funds], Associated Press, March 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Early proceedings====
In August 2008, Vick's finances were in such disarray that a bankruptcy judge had been asked to appoint a trustee to oversee them. U.S. Trustee W. Clarkson McDow, Jr. noted in court documents filed in Virginia that, by his own admission, Vick &quot;has limited ability to arrange his finances and limited ability to participate in the bankruptcy case on an in-person basis.&quot; McDow wrote in his motion to appoint a Chapter 11 trustee &quot;It appears that Mr. Vick has routinely relied upon others to make financial decisions for him, giving them discretionary control over large sums of money&quot;. McDow named Mary Wong and David A. Talbot as individuals who had obtained broad written authority to act as his [[attorney-in-fact]] over all of his financial affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/printedition/2008/08/15/vick.html?cxntlid=inform_artr |title=Vick could lose control of cash |publisher=Ajc.com |author=D. Orlando Ledbetter |date=August 15, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fall 2007, upon a recommendation from Falcons teammate [[Demorrio Williams]], Vick hired Wong, a business manager in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. Wong helped cash in some of Vick's investments to provide the restitution funds required by the federal court in his criminal case to care for the dogs. According to a document filed by one of Vick's attorneys, she used a power of attorney from Vick to &quot;wrongfully remove&quot; at least another $900,000 from his various accounts. Court papers also say Wong &quot;caused certain business entities owned by [Vick] to be transferred to her.&quot; Vick learned later that Wong had been permanently barred from working with any firm that traded on the New York Stock Exchange as the result of taking more than $150,000 from two elderly widows she met while working at Wells Fargo Investments.&lt;ref name=&quot;espn1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=munson_lester&amp;id=3537577 |title=ESPN - Bad advice, bad decisions: the loss of Michael Vick's fortune - NFL |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |author=Lester MunsonESPN.com (Archive) |date= |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vick next turned to Talbot, a medical school graduate from [[Hackensack, New Jersey]] who claimed expertise in financial management. Vick later told the court that he met Talbot in April 2008 through his brother, Marcus, who he said is a good friend of Talbot's son.&lt;ref name=&quot;hamptonroads1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hamptonroads.com/2008/08/michael-vick-says-he-plans-play-nfl-again |title=Michael Vick says he plans to play in NFL again |publisher=Hamptonroads.com |author=Dave Forster The Virginian-Pilot&amp;copy; August 30, 2008 |date= |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talbot was to be paid $15,000 per month and took possession of one of Vick's cars, an $85,000 Mercedes-Benz. Upon closer examination, it was discovered that his professional résumé contained numerous false statements. Talbot has been accused of defrauding church members in [[New Jersey]]. New Jersey's Attorney General instituted legal action against Talbot for [[securities fraud]] in a scheme to &quot;defraud&quot; several investors of more than $500,000 by offering them &quot;asset enhancement contracts&quot; that were to be used to build a new church.&lt;ref name=&quot;espn1&quot; /&gt; U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Frank Santoro ordered that the Mercedes-Benz Vick gave Talbot be repossessed and sold, and that Talbot show up at a hearing on September 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hamptonroads.com/2008/08/vick-adviser-noshow-newport-news-bankruptcy-hearing |title=Vick adviser a no-show at Newport News bankruptcy hearing |publisher=Hamptonroads.com |author=Dave Forster The Virginian-Pilot&amp;copy; August 23, 2008 |date= |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Attorney Paul K. Campsen explained to the court that Vick &quot;has supported his mother, brother, fiancée and his two children&quot; over the years.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailypress2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailypress.com/news/local/newport_news/dp-local_vick_0906sep06,0,4107238.story |title=Lawyers : Lawyers News and Photos - dailypress.com |publisher=Dailypress.com |date=November 2, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-02}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reported that Vick's financial problems included average monthly expenses of $12,225 for several large homes his family and friends were living in and a monthly income of just $277.69.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/falcons/stories/2008/08/20/vick_bankruptcy_case_documents.html |title=Documents show Vick losing $12,000 per month |publisher=Ajc.com |author=Chris Vivlamore |date=August 20, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reorganization Plan====
After being granted an extension in July, on November 12, 2008, Vick's attorneys filed a document entitled &quot;Disclosure Statement With Respect to Debtor's First Amended Plan of Reorganization.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hosted.ap.org/specials/interactives/_documents/vick_disclosure.pdf], Reorg Plan PDF&lt;/ref&gt; Under the bankruptcy plan discussed with the Bankruptcy Court earlier at an October 4 hearing, Vick's plans included selling three of his six homes. For monthly expenses, Vick listed support payments of approximately $30,000 a month. Items included $14,531 a month to his mother (which included $4,700 in mortgage payments and a monthly electric power bill of $663), $12,363 a month to his fiancée and two daughters, and $3,500 a month to Taylor. Creditors challenged Vick's spending, particularly since his suspension from the NFL. Vick's attorneys told the judge on November 13 that Vick &quot;has every reason to believe that upon his release, he will be reinstated into the NFL, resume his career and be able to earn a substantial living.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hamptonroads.com&quot; /&gt;

After objections to the initial reorganization plan,&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc.com&quot; /&gt; Vick appeared in person before Santoro at a hearing in Newport News on April 2, 2009. In March, Santoro rejected the idea of allowing testimony by video hookup, saying he needed Vick in the courtroom so he could assess his demeanor and credibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5hDsEKkbHNcP7laksDZz0oHhhHOwAD975B9SG0 ]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vick testified that he intended to live a better life after prison.

If you do, you're going to be nothing to anybody.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtkr.com/news/dp-local_vick_0404apr04,0,4055023.story?page=2 ]{{Dead link|date=February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 28, attorneys met with Santoro for a scheduled update meeting and advised him that they are making substantial progress on a revised plan to submit to the court. They reported having settled all disputes with his creditors, including Joel. On August 27, Santoro approved the revised Reorganization Plan. It was supported by all Vick's creditors but one, who is owed $13,000. Every creditor will be paid back in six years on the condition that an estimated $9 million in assets is liquidated. Under this plan, Vick will have annual living expenses of $300,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Judge OKs Vick's bankruptcy plan |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4425724 |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=August 28, 2009 |accessdate=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vick can spend up to $3,500 each month for rent in Philadelphia and $750 for &quot;utilies and miscellaneous.&quot; He has to pay $3,712 each month on the mortgage for his house in Hampton, Virginia, where his fiancée and two children live, and he can pay up to $1,355 per month in private school tuition for his children. Vick can pay up to $472 each month for car-related expenses. His mother is allowed $2,500 per month, and he has to pay his former girlfriend Tameka Taylor $3,000 per month to support their son, Mitez, and her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Defenses and debt&quot;&gt;{{cite news |author=Munson, Lester |title=Michael Vick's focus: Defenses and debt |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/commentary/news/story?page=munson/101202 |work=[[ESPN.com]] |date=December 2, 2010 |accessdate=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vick was not required to pay creditors during his first season with the Eagles. Vick paid Segal $32,500 in 2010, $104,000 in 2011, and will pay him $160,000 each year from 2012−2015 for a total of $776,500. He paid bankruptcy lawyers $748,750 in 2010, $1,058,080 in 2011, and a total of $2.6 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Defenses and debt&quot;/&gt;

Before the animal cruelty case surfaced in 2007, Vick's corporate status had deteriorated. Among the negative incidents was his [[middle finger]] gesture to Atlanta football fans in [[2006 NFL season|2006]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Bill Briggs |title=NFL megastar Vick's endorsements in danger |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-07-18 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19834805/ |accessdate=2007-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fans Split On Vick's Finger Flip |publisher=MSNBC |date=2006-11-28 |url=http://www.wsbtv.com/news/10412257/detail.html |accessdate=2007-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] officially signed Vick again as an athlete on July 1, 2011. They had been supplying him complimentary gear since October 2009 but this is especially notable considering this is the first time a sponsor has ever brought back an athlete after dropping them before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Michael Vick and Nike join forces once again |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdown_corner/post/Michael-Vick-and-Nike-join-forces-once-again?urn=nfl-wp3100 |work=[[Yahoo.com]] |date=July 1, 2011 |accessdate=2011-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Vick launched a sports clothing line called V7 to be sold exclusively at [[Modell's]], with a part of the proceeds going to the [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys and Girls Club]] of Philadelphia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505145_162-57470445/eagles-michael-vick-launches-sports-clothing-line/?tag=cbsnewsLeadStoriesAreaMain|title=Eagles' Michael Vick launches sports clothing line|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=July 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charitable foundations==
Michael Vick has been a principal in two charitable foundations, the Michael Vick Foundation and The Vick Foundation.

In June 2006, Vick, along with his brother Marcus and mother Brenda, established The Vick Foundation, a nonprofit organization to support at-risk youth and the after school programs that serve them in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area|Metro Atlanta]] and Hampton Roads areas. The announcement of the new organization came just before the start of the foundation's first fundraiser, the Michael Vick Golf Classic. The inaugural event was held at the prestigious [[Kingsmill]] Golf Course in [[James City County, Virginia|James City County]] near [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] in partnership with The Virginia Tech Alumni Association Tidewater Chapter, and netted more than $80,000 for charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vickfoundation.org/ |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080621214054/http://www.vickfoundation.org/ |archivedate=2008-06-21 |title=Vick Foundation |publisher=Vickfoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jointheteam.com/features/?f=316&amp;t=22 Join the Team - Michael Vick Golf Classic&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; According to its 2006 federal tax return, the Michael Vick Foundation provided 100 backpacks to poor children in Newport News and paid for an after-school program in 2006. During the same period the foundation spent 12% of its budget – $20,590 of $171,823 – on charitable programs and paid its fundraiser, Susan Bass Roberts, a former spokeswoman for Vick, $97,000. That foundation ceased operations in 2006. One of Vick's financial advisors withdrew $50,000, most of the remaining funds, from its checking account in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Judd |first=Alan |url=http://www.ajc.com/sports/content/sports/falcons/stories/2008/12/06/michael_vick_fortune.html |title=Atlanta Falcons news |publisher=ajc.com |date=2008-12-06 |accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Virginia Tech massacre]] on April 16, 2007, Vick and the [[United Way of America|United Way]] donated $10,000 to assist families affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Former QB Vick makes donation for victims families |publisher=ESPN |date=2007-04-18 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2842466 |accessdate=2007-05-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vick Foundation collected donations from communities in Atlanta and Virginia that will be placed in the United In Caring Fund for Victims of the Virginia Tech Tragedy and the special fund at the United Way of [[Montgomery County, Virginia|Montgomery]], [[Blacksburg-Christiansburg-Radford, VA MSA|Radford]] and [[Floyd County, Virginia|Floyd]] counties, which serves the Virginia Tech area. The Vick Foundation said the money would be used to provide help with funeral expenses, transportation for family members and other support services.

In June 2007, the &quot;Michael Vick Football Camp,&quot; to be held at [[Christopher Newport University]] in Newport News, was canceled for the summer 2007 session.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Chris Vivlamore |title=Vick cancels his youth football camp |publisher=''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution'' |date=2007-06-09 |url=http://www.ajc.com/services/content/sports/falcons/stories/2007/06/08/0608vickcamp.html?cxtype=rss&amp;cxsvc=7&amp;cxcat=21 |accessdate=2007-06-12 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070930041208/http://www.ajc.com/services/content/sports/falcons/stories/2007/06/08/0608vickcamp.html?cxtype=rss&amp;cxsvc=7&amp;cxcat=21 |archivedate = September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He canceled participation in another football camp to be held at the [[College of William and Mary]] and was replaced by [[Washington Redskins]] quarterback [[Jason Campbell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Camp&quot;&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Vick pulls out of youth football camp |publisher=USA Today |date=2007-06-18 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/falcons/2007-06-18-vick-camp_N.htm?csp=34 |accessdate=2007-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 22, 2007, a charity golf tournament featuring Vick, intended in part to raise scholarships in memory of Virginia Tech's shooting victims, was rescheduled for September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Charity golf tournament rescheduled for September |publisher=ESPN |date=2007-06-22 |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2913254 |accessdate=2007-06-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentary series==
In the spring of 2010, cable network [[Black Entertainment Television|BET]] aired a 10-episode documentary series called ''[[The Michael Vick Project]]''. It chronicled Vick as he was coming to terms with his dogfighting past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |authorlink= |title='Michael Vick Project': Reality TV Show Revisits Dogfighting |date= 2010-01-22|publisher= |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/22/michael-vick-project-real_n_432817.html |work=Huffington Post |pages= |accessdate=2010-01-28 |language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
