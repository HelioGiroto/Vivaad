Following her move from [[The Bronx]] to [[Manhattan]], Lopez performed in regional stage productions, before touring with musicals in Europe and Japan. She gained her first regular high-profile job as a [[Fly Girl]] dancer on the television comedy program ''[[In Living Color]]'' in 1991, where she remained a regular cast member until 1993 when she decided to pursue a full-time acting career.

Lopez received her first leading role in the [[Selena]] biopic [[Selena (film)|of the same name]] in 1997, which earned her widespread acclaim and a [[Golden Globe]] nomination. Following subsequent roles in the films ''[[Anaconda (film)|Anaconda]]'' (1997) and ''[[Out of Sight]]'' (1998), Lopez ventured into the music industry in 1999 with the release of her debut album ''[[On the 6]]''. With the simultaneous release of her second studio album ''[[J.Lo (album)|J.Lo]]'' and her film ''[[The Wedding Planner]]'' in 2001, Lopez became the first person to have a number one album and film in the same week. Lopez's 2002 remix album, ''[[J to tha L–O! The Remixes]]'', became the first in history to debut atop the U.S. [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. Between the release of her third and fourth studio albums – ''[[This Is Me... Then]]'' and ''[[Rebirth (Jennifer Lopez album)|Rebirth]]'' – Lopez took a break from her music career to focus on acting, starring in the films ''[[Maid in Manhattan]]'' (2002) and ''[[Shall We Dance? (2004 film)|Shall We Dance?]]'' (2004). Lopez's Spanish-language album, ''[[Como Ama una Mujer]]'' (2007), received the highest first-week sales in the United States for a Spanish album. Her commercial success was severely damaged after the release of her sixth studio album, ''[[Brave (Jennifer Lopez album)|Brave]]'' (2007). The set, which showcased a different musical prospective from the singer, failed to attain the success of her previous efforts and removed Lopez from the music scene until 2011, when she became a judge on the singing competition ''[[American Idol]]''; this move allowed her to regain media attention and improved her success at charts, with her single &quot;[[On the Floor]]&quot;, showcased and released during such timespan, becoming a worldwide hit and her best-selling single to date.

Lopez's public image and high-profile relationships have attracted worldwide media attention. Her marriage to actor Ojani Noa from 1997 to 1998 was proceeded by a series of lawsuits resulting from Noa's attempts to sell private details of Lopez and their relationship. Following her marriage to Noa, Lopez dated producer [[Sean Combs]], a relationship that became the inspiration for Lopez's 2000 single &quot;[[Love Don't Cost a Thing (song)|Love Don't Cost a Thing]]&quot;. Combs accompanied Lopez to the [[42nd Grammy Awards]] in 2000, where she wore her infamous [[Green Versace dress of Jennifer Lopez|Green Versace dress]]. After a series of incidents and Combs' trial and pursuit by the press Lopez terminated her involvement with Combs later that same year. Lopez became romantically involved with actor [[Ben Affleck]], while still married to her second husband [[Cris Judd]], during shooting of ''[[Gigli]]'' (2003), a film that is considered [[List of films considered the worst|one of the worst of all time]]. Their relationship, dubbed as [[Bennifer]] by the public, ended as a result of media overexposure, which had a negative impact on both of their careers. After rekindling her relationship with recording artist [[Marc Anthony]], whom she had previously dated in 1999, the two wed in a private ceremony in 2004. Lopez gave birth to the couple's twins, Maximilian and Emme, in February 2008. They were introduced in the March 11, 2008 issue of ''People'', for which the magazine paid a reported $6&amp;nbsp;million—the photographs of the twins became [[List of most expensive celebrity photographs|the most expensive celebrity picture ever taken]] at the time.

=== 1969–94: Childhood and early work ===
[[File:Castlehillbx1.JPG|thumb|left|[[Castle Hill, Bronx|Castle Hill]], [[The Bronx]]: the neighborhood in which Lopez was born and raised]]

Lopez was born on July 24, 1969 in the [[Castle Hill, Bronx|Castle Hill]] neighborhood of [[The Bronx]], [[New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courttv.com/trials/puffy/docs/duty-caps_3.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080209202541/http://www.courttv.com/trials/puffy/docs/duty-caps_3.html|archivedate=2008-02-09|title=Duty Captain's Report|accessdate=2006-10-29|work=[[Court TV]]|date=January 17, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The middle child of Puerto Rican parents Guadalupe Rodriguez and David Lopez, she has an elder sister, Leslie, and a younger sister, [[Lynda Lopez|Lynda]] (born June 14, 1971).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terra.com/musica/fotos/mamas_y_mamacitas/64457 |title=Mamás y Mamacitas – Música |publisher=Terra |date= |accessdate=2012-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; David worked the night shift at the Guardian Insurance Company, before becoming a computer technician at the firm, while Guadalupe was a [[Homemaking|homemaker]]. When Jennifer was born, the Lopez family was living in a small apartment. A few years later, her parents had saved up enough money to be able to purchase a two-story house, which was considered a big deal for the relatively poor family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallick2003&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Gallick|2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the age of five, Lopez began taking singing and dancing lessons. She toured New York with her school when she was seven years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;atriplethreat&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.evancarmichael.com/Famous-Entrepreneurs/619/The-Triple-Threat-Jennifer-Lopez-is-Born.html |title=The Triple Threat: Jennifer Lopez is Born |publisher=Evancarmichael.com |accessdate=2012-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents stressed the importance of work ethic and being able to speak English. They encouraged their three daughters to put on performances at home, singing and dancing in front of each other and their friends so that they would stay &quot;out of trouble&quot;.&lt;ref name=atriplethreat /&gt; Lopez spent her entire academic career in [[Catholic school]]s, finishing at the all-girls [[Preston High School (New York City)|Preston High School]].&lt;ref name=tca&gt;Stated on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In school, Lopez did gymnastics, ran track on a national level and was a member of the school's softball team.&lt;ref name=rantrack&gt;{{cite book|last=Parish|first=James-Robert|title=Jennifer Lopez: Actor and Singer|page=14|url=http://books.google.com/?id=lh1Y2OK-VdsC&amp;pg=PA129&amp;dq=J-Lo:+The+Secret+Behind+Jennifer+Lopez's+Clib+to+the+Top#v=onepage&amp;q=J-Lo%3A%20The%20Secret%20Behind%20Jennifer%20Lopez's%20Clib%20to%20the%20Top&amp;f=false|isbn=978-0-8160-5832-7|date=November 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; She excelled athletically rather than academically, competing in national track championships.&lt;ref name=atriplethreat /&gt; In 1984, at the age of fifteen, she began dating David Cruz, her first boyfriend.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallick2003&quot;/&gt;

While attending her final year of high school, Lopez learned about a film casting that was seeking several teenage girls for small roles. She auditioned and was cast in ''[[My Little Girl]]'' (1986), an low-budget film co-written and directed by Connie Kaiserman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rovi My Little Girl&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Eleanor |last=Mannikka |url=http://www.allrovi.com/movies/movie/my-little-girl-v34075|title=My Little Girl – Cast, Reviews, Summary, and Awards |work=[[AllRovi]] |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lopez acted as Myra, a young woman at a center for troubled girls. After she finished filming her role in the film, Lopez knew that she wanted to become a &quot;famous movie star&quot;. To please her parents, though, she enrolled in [[Baruch College]], only to drop out after one semester. She told her parents her dream of becoming a movie star, but they ensisted that it was a &quot;really stupid&quot; idea and that &quot;no Latinos did that&quot;. The differences in opinions led Lopez to move out of their family home and into an apartment in [[Manhattan]]. During this period, Lopez performed in regional productions of the musicals: ''Jesus Christ'', ''Superstar!'' and ''Oklahoma''. From there, she was hired for the chorus in a ''Golden Musicals of Broadway'', which toured [[Europe]] for a period of five months. She was unhappy with the role, as she was the only member of the chorus not to have a solo. She later got a job on the show ''Synchronicity'' in [[Japan]], where she acted as a dancer, singer and a choreographer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallick2003&quot;/&gt;

In 1991 Lopez was selected as a [[backup dancer]] for the [[New Kids on the Block]] and performed with them during their performance of &quot;Games&quot; at the [[American Music Award]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perricon|first=Kathleen|title=Jennifer Lopez dances with New Kids on the Block in 1991 video clip|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-05-10/entertainment/29547058_1_nkotb-music-video-new-kids|publisher=nydailynews.com|accessdate=2012-06-22|date=May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Lopez gained her first regular high-profile job as a [[Fly Girl]] dancer on the television comedy program ''[[In Living Color]]''. She applied for the job after one of the cast members was unavailable to continue with the show. Out of two thousand applicants, Lopez made it to the finals; becoming the runner-up, but eventually received the role when the winner was unable to accept the job. She moved with Cruz to [[Los Angeles]] to film the series and remained a regular cast member until 1993 when she decided to pursue an acting career. Prior to leaving the show, Lopez briefly worked as a backup dancer for American recording artist [[Janet Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morales|first=Ed|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/may/30/entertainment/ca-42339|title=COVER STORY; It's Not La Vida Loca to Her; Some say Jennifer Lopez is risking a lot by making the leap to music.

Lopez earned widespread outstanding reviews and praise from critics for her portrayal of Selena. [[Kenneth Turan]] from ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' film critic [[Kenneth Turan]] while giving the film a mixed review, he wrote that ''Selena'' was not just a celebration of Selena's life, but the actress who played her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-movie970321-5,2,2183.story Turan, Kenneth].

On December 27, 1999, Lopez and [[Sean Combs]] were at Club New York, a midtown Manhattan nightclub, when gunfire erupted between Combs' entourage and another group. Lopez and Combs were being driven away from the scene when they were chased and stopped by the police. A gun was found in the front seat of their vehicle. Combs was charged with felony gun possession. Stress over Combs' trial and pursuit by the press multiplied their problems and Lopez terminated her involvement with Combs a year later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40A12F6395E0C778DDDA80894D8404482 |title=Puffy Combs Is Indicted In Club Case |author=[[David S.

The dress, known for its low cut neck that extended before her navel and its open back, generated much controversy and media attention.

Knowing how important it was to stay fresh and innovate the music industry, Lopez decided to change her image to keep her fans guessing.
