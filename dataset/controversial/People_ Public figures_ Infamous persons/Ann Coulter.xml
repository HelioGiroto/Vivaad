'''Ann Hart Coulter''' (born December 8, 1961) is an American [[lawyer]], [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[social criticism|social]] and [[political criticism|political]] [[pundit (expert)|commentator]], author, and [[syndicated columnist]]. She frequently appears on television, radio, and as a speaker at public and private events. Well known for her conservative political opinions and the controversial ways in which she presents and defends them, Coulter has described herself as a [[polemic]]ist who likes to &quot;stir up the pot,&quot; and does not &quot;pretend to be impartial or balanced, as broadcasters do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;polemicist&quot;/&gt;

==Early life==
Ann Hart Coulter was born in New York City on December 8, 1961, to John Vincent Coulter, a native of [[Albany, New York]], and Nell Husbands Coulter (née Martin), a native of [[Paducah, Kentucky]]. The family later moved to [[New Canaan, Connecticut]], where Coulter and her two older brothers, James and John, were raised.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb_bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1326010/bio|title=Biography for Ann Coulter|publisher=[[The Internet Movie Database]]|accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from [[New Canaan High School]] in 1980. Coulter's age was disputed in 2002 while she was arguing that she was not yet 40, yet ''[[Washington Post]]'' columnist [[Lloyd Grove]] cited that she provided a birthdate of December 8, 1961, when registering to vote in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]] prior to the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 Presidential election]]. Meanwhile, a driver's license issued several years later allegedly listed her birthdate as December 8, 1963. Coulter will not confirm either date, citing privacy concerns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grove_Lloyd&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Grove|first=Lloyd|title=Mystery of the Ages|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=September 6, 2002|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A43120-2002Sep5|accessdate=September 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While attending [[Cornell University College of Arts and Sciences|Cornell University]], Coulter helped found ''[[Cornell Review|The Cornell Review]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;horowitz&quot;&gt;Horowitz, David. &quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060116100109/http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/ReadArticle.asp?ID=1038 Ann Coulter at Cornell]&quot;.

==Career==
After law school, Coulter served as a [[law clerk]], in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], for [[Pasco Bowman II]] of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite news |title=Liberals, conservatives duke it out on paper |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20031005/ai_n11424888 |last=Lythgoe |first=Dennis |date=2003-10-05|publisher=[[Deseret Morning News]] |page=E1}}; {{cite news |title=Op-Ed: Congress Goes Fishing |last=Hentoff |first=Nat |date=1998-12-05|publisher=Washington Post |page=A23}}; Coulter herself says it was Bowman.

She handled crime and immigration issues for Senator [[Spencer Abraham]] of Michigan and helped craft legislation designed to expedite the [[deportation]] of aliens convicted of [[felony|felonies]].&lt;ref name=Daley1999&gt;Daley, David.

In 1999 and 2000, Coulter considered running for [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]] in [[Connecticut]] on the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] ticket to serve as a [[Spoiler effect|spoiler]] in order to throw the seat to the Democratic candidate and see that Republican Congressman [[Christopher Shays]] failed to gain re-election, as a punishment for Shays' vote against Clinton's [[impeachment]]. The leadership of the [[Libertarian Party of Connecticut]], after meeting with Coulter, declined to endorse her. As a result, her self-described &quot;total sham, media-intensive, third-party [[Jesse Ventura]] campaign&quot; did not take place.&lt;ref name = &quot;arm candy&quot;&gt;Lehman, Susan. &quot;[http://www.salon.com/media/lehm/1999/03/04lehm.html Conservative pinup battles &quot;arm candy&quot; canard]&quot;.

Coulter's career is highlighted by the publication of eight books, as well as the weekly syndicated [[newspaper]] column that she publishes. She is particularly known for her polemical style,&lt;ref name=&quot;coulter_style&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1203281,00.html|title=What Would Ann Coulter Do?|last=Schmidt|first=Tracy Samantha|date=June 12, 2006|publisher=[[Time Magazine]]|accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; who likes to &quot;stir up the pot&quot; and, unlike &quot;broadcasters,&quot; does not &quot;pretend to be impartial or balanced.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;polemicist&quot;/&gt; She has been compared to [[Clare Boothe Luce]], one of her idols, for her satirical style.&lt;ref&gt;David T.

===Books===
[[File:Ann Coulter2.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Ann Coulter at the [[2004 Republican National Convention]]]]
Coulter is the author of eight books, all of which have appeared on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]], with a combined 3 million copies sold as of May 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;depasquale&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://townhall.com/columnists/LisaDePasquale/2009/05/06/being_ann|title=Being Ann|last=De Pasquale|first=Lisa|date=May 6, 2009|publisher=[[Townhall.com]]|accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coulter's first book, ''[[High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Case Against Bill Clinton]]'', was published by [[Regnery Publishing]] in 1998. It details Coulter's case for the [[Clinton impeachment|impeachment]] of [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]].

Her second book, ''[[Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right]]'', published by [[Crown Publishing Group|Crown Forum]] in 2002, reached the number one spot on ''The New York Times'' non-fiction best seller list.&lt;ref name=&quot;slander_bestseller&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/c/ann_coulter/index.html?scp=2&amp;sq=slander:%20liberal%20lies%20bestseller&amp;st=cse|title=Ann Coulter|date=March 10, 2009|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=July 21, 2009 | first=Ian | last=Austen}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Slander'', Coulter argues that [[George W. Bush|President George W. Bush]] was given unfair negative media coverage. The factual accuracy of ''Slander'' was called into question by then-[[comedian]] and author, and now Democratic [[U.S. Senator]] from [[Minnesota]], [[Al Franken]]; he also accused her of citing passages out of context.&lt;ref name=&quot;frankenbook&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author = Franken, Al|title=Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them|publisher = Dutton Books|year = 2003|isbn = 0-525-94764-7|unused_data = Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others investigated these charges, and also raised questions about the book's accuracy and presentation of facts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spinsanity.org/columns/20020713.html &quot;Throwing the book at her&quot;], ''Spinsanity''.

In her third book, ''[[Treason: Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism]]'', also published by Crown Forum, she reexamines the 60-year history of the [[Cold War]] — including the career of [[Joseph McCarthy|Senator Joseph McCarthy]], the [[Whittaker Chambers]]-[[Alger Hiss]] affair, and [[Ronald Reagan]]’s challenge to [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] to &quot;[[tear down this wall]]&quot;—and argues that liberals were wrong in their Cold War political analyses and policy decisions, and that McCarthy was correct about Soviet agents working for the U.S. government. She also argues that the correct identification of [[Annie Lee Moss]], among others, as [[communist]]s was misreported by the liberal media. ''Treason'' was published in 2003, and spent 13 weeks on the Best Seller list.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfgate&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/12/02/DDG4F3DPKR1.DTL|title=An outbreak of partisan warfare on the best-seller list is encouraging authors to stoke the fires of readers hungry for political squabbles – and the Bay Area is fertile ground for Bush-whackers|last=Guthmann|first=Edward|date=December 2, 2003|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crown Forum published a collection of Coulter's columns in 2004 as her fourth book, ''[[How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must)|How to Talk to a Liberal (If You Must): The World According to Ann Coulter]]''.

Coulter's fifth book, published by Crown Forum in 2006, is ''[[Godless: The Church of Liberalism]]''. In it, she argues, first, that [[liberalism]] rejects the idea of God and reviles people of faith, and second, that it bears all the attributes of a religion itself. ''Godless'' debuted at number one on ''The New York Times'' Best Seller list.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt_bestsellers_062506&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/25/books/bestseller/0625besthardnonfiction.html?_r=1|title=Best Sellers: Hardcover Nonfiction|date=June 25, 2006|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coulter published ''[[If Democrats Had Any Brains, They'd Be Republicans]]'', in October 2007, and another, ''[[Guilty: Liberal &quot;Victims&quot; and Their Assault on America]]'', on January 6, 2009.

On June 7, 2011, she published ''[[Demonic: How the Liberal Mob Is Endangering America]]'', &lt;!--argues that liberals have mob-like characteristics--&gt;. Claiming to be largely based on the work of [[France|French]] [[social psychologist]] [[Gustave Le Bon]], Coulter argues that liberals have mob-like characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Why liberals behave the way they do&quot; by Ann Coulter, ''The Dailer Caller'', August 15, 2012, [http://dailycaller.com/2012/08/15/why-liberals-behave-the-way-they-do/ Retrieved 2012-08-16]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her most recent book, published September 25, 2012, is ''[[Mugged: Racial Demagoguery from the Seventies to Obama]]''. It argues that liberals, and Democrats in particular, have taken undue credit for racial civil rights in America.&lt;ref&gt;Amazon.com [http://www.amazon.com/Mugged-Racial-Demagoguery-Seventies-Obama/dp/1595230998/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1349068802&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=mugged+ann+coulter] Retrieved 2012-10-01&lt;/ref&gt;

===Columns===
In the late 1990s, Coulter's weekly (biweekly from 1999–2000) [[Print syndication|syndicated]] column for [[Universal Press Syndicate]] began appearing. Her column is featured on six conservative websites: ''[[Human Events|Human Events Online]]'', [[WorldNetDaily]], [[Townhall.com]], [[FrontPageMag]], ''[[Jewish World Review]]'' and her own web site. Her syndicator says, &quot;Ann's client newspapers stick with her because she has a loyal fan base of conservative readers who look forward to reading her columns in their local newspapers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EP_mitchell-astor&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.neilrogers.com/news/articles/2006061922.html|title=Newspaper Clients, and Syndicate, Stick With Coulter|date=June 16, 2006|publisher=[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]|accessdate=June 28, 2009|author=Astor, Dave; Mitchell, Greg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Coulter worked as a regular [[columnist]] for ''[[George (magazine)|George]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;arm candy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tribute-to-john&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uexpress.com/anncoulter/index.html?uc_full_date=19990728|title=A Republican Tribute to John|last=Coulter|first=Ann|date=July 28, 1999|publisher=[http://www.uexpress.com/ www.uexpress.com]|accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coulter also wrote exclusive weekly columns between 1998 and 2003 and with occasional columns thereafter for the conservative magazine ''[[Human Events]]''. In her columns for the magazine, she discusses judicial rulings, [[Constitution]]al issues, and legal matters affecting Congress and the [[executive branch]].

In 2001, as a contributing editor and syndicated columnist for ''[[National Review Online]]'' (NRO), Coulter was asked by editors to make changes to a piece written after the [[September 11 attacks]]. On the national television show ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'', Coulter accused ''NRO'' of [[censorship]] and said that she was paid $5 per article. NRO dropped her column and terminated her editorship.

Coulter contracted with ''[[USA Today]]'' to cover the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]]. She wrote one article that began, &quot;Here at the Spawn of [[Satan]] convention in [[Boston]]...&quot; and referred to some unspecified female attendees as &quot;[[corn-fed (disambiguation)|corn-fed]], no make-up, natural fiber, no-bra needing, sandal-wearing, [[hirsutism|hirsute]], somewhat fragrant [[hippie]] chick pie wagons.&quot; The newspaper declined to print the article citing an editing dispute over &quot;basic weaknesses in clarity and readability that we found unacceptable.&quot; An explanatory article by the paper went on to say &quot;Coulter told the online edition of ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'' magazine that '''USA Today'' doesn't like my &quot;tone,&quot; humor, sarcasm, etc., which raises the intriguing question of why they hired me to write for them.'&quot; ''USA Today'' replaced Coulter with [[Jonah Goldberg]], and Coulter published it instead on her website.&lt;ref name=&quot;speakerscage&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.worldnetdaily.com/news/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=39644|title=Put the speakers in a cage|last=Coulter|first=Ann|date=July 26, 2004|publisher=[[World Net Daily]]|accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usatodaydrops&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/07/26/politics/main631949.shtml|title=USA Today Drops Ann Coulter|last=Collins|first=Dan|date=July 26, 2004|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usatodaydrops2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/nation/2004-07-26-coulter-column_x.htm|title=Coulter column canceled after editing dispute|last=Memmott|first=Mark|date=July 26, 2004|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2005, ''[[The Arizona Daily Star]]'' dropped Coulter's syndicated column citing reader complaints that &quot;Many readers find her shrill, bombastic and mean-spirited. And those are the words used by readers who identified themselves as conservatives.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AZDailyStar&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailystar.com/dailystar/opinion/90500.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060321202508/http://www.dailystar.com/dailystar/opinion/90500.php|archivedate=2006-03-21|title=Opinion pages get a makeover|last=Stoeffler|first=David|date=August 28, 2005|publisher=[[Arizona Daily Star]]|accessdate=July 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2006, some newspapers replaced Coulter's column with those of other conservative columnists following the publication of her fourth book, ''[[Godless: The Church of Liberalism]].''&lt;ref name=&quot;EP_anothernewspaper&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/services/business-services-miscellaneous-business/4699774-1.html|title=Another Newspaper Decides to Drop Ann Coulter's Column|date=July 26, 2006|publisher=[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]|accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ''[[The Augusta Chronicle]]'' dropped her column, newspaper editor Michael Ryan explained that &quot;it came to the point where she was the issue rather than what she was writing about.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mediainfo.com/eandp/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002878146|title=Augusta Editor Explains Why He Dropped Coulter Column|date=July 24, 2006|publisher=[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]|accessdate=July 26, 2006|author=Astor, Dave; Mitchell, Greg}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan also stated that &quot;pulling Ann Coulter's column hurts; she's one of the clearest thinkers around.&quot;

She has criticized former president [[George W. Bush]]'s immigration proposals, saying they led to &quot;amnesty.&quot; In one column, she claims that the current immigration system is set up to deliberately reduce the percentage of whites in the population. In it, she said:&lt;ref name=&quot;roachmotel&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/printer_friendly.cgi?article=188|title=Bush's America:Roach Motel|last=Coulter|first=Ann|date=June 6, 2007|publisher=[http://www.anncoulter.com/www.anncoulter.com]|accessdate=April 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|In 1960, whites were 90 percent of the country. The Census Bureau recently estimated that whites already account for less than two-thirds of the population and will be a minority by 2050. Other estimates put that day much sooner.

One may assume the new majority will not be such compassionate overlords as the white majority has been. If this sort of drastic change were legally imposed on any group other than white Americans, it would be called genocide. Yet whites are called racists merely for mentioning the fact that current immigration law is intentionally designed to reduce their percentage in the population.}}

Overall, Coulter's columns are highly critical of liberals and Democrats. In one, she wrote:&lt;ref name=&quot;waronterrorism&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/article.cgi?article=144|title=What Part of the War on Terrorism do they Support?|last=Coulter|first=Ann|date=August 23, 2006|publisher=[http://www.anncoulter.com/ www.anncoulter.com]|accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To wit, they're claiming there is no connection between the war on terror and the war in Iraq, and while they're all for the war against terror—absolutely in favor of that war—they are adamantly opposed to the Iraq war. You know, the war where the U.S. military is killing thousands upon thousands of terrorists (described in the media as &quot;Iraqi civilians,&quot; even if they are from Jordan, like the now-dead leader of al-Qaida in Iraq, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi). That war.}}

[[File:Ann Coulter 2007 (Cut image).jpg|right|thumb|upright|Ann Coulter at ''The Morning Show with Mike and Juliet'' in 2007.]]
Coulter made her first national media appearance in 1996 after she was hired by the then-fledgling network [[MSNBC]] as a legal correspondent. She was dismissed from the network at least twice. First, in February 1997, after she allegedly insulted the late [[Pamela Harriman]] (U.S. Ambassador to France), as the network was covering her memorial service. They missed her jousting and quickly rehired her, only to fire her eight months later after she tangled with a disabled [[Vietnam war|Vietnam]] veteran on the air. [[Bobby Muller|Robert Muller]], co-founder of the [[International Campaign to Ban Landmines]], asserted that &quot;in 90% of the cases that U.S. soldiers got blown up [in Vietnam]—Ann, are you listening—they were our own mines.&quot; (Muller was misquoting a 1969 [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] report that found that 90% of the components used in enemy mines came from U.S. duds and refuse). Coulter, who found Muller's statement laughable, averted her eyes and responded sarcastically, &quot;No wonder you guys lost.&quot; It became an infamous—and oft-misreported—Coulter moment. The ''[[Washington Post]]'' and others turned the line into a more personal attack: &quot;People like you caused us to lose that war.&quot; But her troubles with MSNBC only freed her to appear on [[CNN]] and [[Fox News]], whose producers were often calling.&lt;ref name=&quot;msright&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1050304-1,00.html|title=Ms. Right|last=Cloud|first=John|date=April 17, 2005|publisher=[[Time Magazine]]|accessdate=June 28, 2009| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20090524145603/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1050304-1,00.html| archivedate= 24 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Howard Kurtz]] of the ''Washington Post'' made a point to respond to the ''Time'' article to explain that his widely quoted reporting of Coulter's reply to the veteran in an article he wrote had its origin in Coulter's own later recollection of the incident. Describing his previous story, Kurtz added, &quot;I did note that, according to Coulter, the vet was appearing by [[satellite]], and she didn't know he was disabled.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kurtz&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A208-2005Apr19.html|title=The Conservative Pin-Up Girl|last=Kurtz|first=Howard|date=April 19, 2005|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Bob McKeown]] on the January 26, 2005, edition of ''[[The Fifth Estate]]'', Coulter came under criticism for her statement, &quot;Canada used to be&amp;nbsp;... one of our most&amp;nbsp;... most loyal friends, and vice versa. I mean, Canada sent troops to Vietnam. Was Vietnam less containable and more of a threat than [[Saddam Hussein]]?&quot; McKeown contradicted her with, &quot;No, actually Canada did not send troops to Vietnam.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fifth estate&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/fifth/sticksandstones.html|title=Sticks and Stones|accessdate = June 28, 2009|date=January 26, 2005|publisher=[[CBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the February 18, 2005, edition of ''[[Washington Journal]]'', Coulter justified her statement by referring to the thousands of Canadians who served in the American armed forces during the Vietnam era, either because they volunteered or because they were living in the USA during the war years and got [[conscription|drafted]]. She said, &quot;The Canadian Government didn't send troops&amp;nbsp;... but&amp;nbsp;... they came and fought with the Americans. So I was wrong. It turns out there were 10,000 Americans who happened to be born in Canada.&quot; (There were actually between 5,000 and 20,000 Canadians who fought in Vietnam itself, including approximately 80 who were killed.).&lt;ref name=&quot;vvic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |date=2005-06-10, September 11, 2005 updated|url = http://www.vvic.org/canadians.htm|title = Canadians in Vietnam |publisher = Vietnam Veterans In Canada| accessdate = November 24, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061127044721/http://www.vvic.org/canadians.htm |archivedate = November 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Cloud of ''Time'', writing about the incident a few months later, said, &quot;Canada [sent] noncombat troops to [[Indochina]] in the 1950s and again to Vietnam in 1972.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;msright&quot;/&gt;

In 2005, Coulter appeared as one of a three-person judging panel in ''[[The Greatest American]]'', a four-part interactive television program for the [[Discovery Channel]] hosted by [[Matt Lauer]]. Starting with 100 nominees, each week, interactive viewer voting eliminated candidates. She voted for [[George Washington]] for the title of Greatest American ever.

Coulter has also made frequent guest appearances on many television and radio [[talk show]]s, including ''[[American Morning]]'', ''[[The Fifth Estate]]'', ''[[Glenn Beck Program]]'', ''[[Mike Gallagher|The Mike Gallagher Show]]'', ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'', ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', ''[[Red Eye w/ Greg Gutfeld]]'', ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'', ''[[The Sean Hannity Show]]'', ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'', ''[[Lou Dobbs Tonight]]'', ''[[Fox and Friends]]'', ''[[The Laura Ingraham Show]]'', ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', ''[[The Michael Medved Show]]'', and ''[[HARDtalk]]''.

==Political activities and commentary==
Ann Coulter has described herself as a &quot;[[polemics|polemicist]]&quot; who likes to &quot;stir up the pot&quot; and doesn't &quot;pretend to be impartial or balanced, as broadcasters do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;polemicist&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April06/coulter.pre.dea.html|title=Conservative pundit Ann Coulter '84 to speak May 7|last=Aloi|first=Daniel|date=April 17, 2006|publisher=[[Cornell University]]|accessdate=September 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While her political activities in the past have included advising a plaintiff suing President [[Bill Clinton]] as well as considering a run for Congress, she mostly serves as a political [[Pundit (expert)|pundit]], sometimes creating [[controversy]] ranging from rowdy uprisings at some of the colleges where she speaks to protracted discussions in the media. ''Time'' magazine's John Cloud once observed that Coulter &quot;likes to shock reporters by wondering aloud whether America might be better off if women lost the right to vote.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;msright&quot;/&gt; This was in reference to her statement that &quot;it would be a much better country if women did not vote.

In fact, in every presidential election since 1950—except [[Barry Goldwater|Goldwater]] in '64—the Republican would have won, if only the men had voted.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;appmagic&quot;/&gt; Similarly, in an October 2007 interview with the ''[[New York Observer]]'', Coulter said:&lt;ref name=&quot;Gurley_George&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Gurley|first=George|title=Coulter Culture|url=http://www.observer.com/2007/coulter-culture|accessdate=September 27, 2011|newspaper=[[The New York Observer]]|date=October 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|If we took away women's right to vote, we'd never have to worry about another Democrat president.

It also makes the point, it is kind of embarrassing, the Democratic Party ought to be hanging its head in shame, that it has so much difficulty getting men to vote for it.

===Paula Jones – Bill Clinton case===
Coulter first became a public figure shortly before becoming an unpaid legal adviser for the attorneys representing [[Paula Jones]] in her [[sexual harassment]] suit against President Bill Clinton. Coulter's friend George Conway had been asked to assist Jones' attorneys, and shortly afterward Coulter, who wrote a column about the Paula Jones case for ''[[Human Events]]'', was also asked to help, and she began writing legal briefs for the case.

Coulter later stated that she would come to mistrust the motives of Jones' head lawyer, Joseph Cammaratta, who by August or September 1997 was advising Jones that her case was weak and to [[legal settlement|settle]], if a favorable settlement could be negotiated.&lt;ref name=Daley1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=conason/&gt; From the outset, Jones had sought an apology from Clinton at least as eagerly as she sought a settlement.&lt;ref&gt;Barak, Daphne. &quot;[http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/1998/09/23/fhead.htm Jones would have been happy with an apology]&quot;. ''[[Irish Examiner]]''. September 23, 1998. Retrieved on July 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a later interview Coulter recounted that she herself had believed that the case was strong, that Jones was telling the truth, that Clinton should be held publicly accountable for his misconduct, and that a settlement would give the impression that Jones was merely interested in [[extortion|extorting]] money from the President.&lt;ref name=Daley1999 /&gt;

David Daley, who wrote the interview piece for ''[[The Hartford Courant]]'' recounted what followed:

{{quote|Coulter played one particularly key role in keeping the Jones case alive. In ''Newsweek'' reporter Michael Isikoff's new book ''Uncovering Clinton: A Reporter's Story'', Coulter is unmasked as the one who leaked word of Clinton's &quot;distinguishing characteristic&quot;—his reportedly bent penis that Jones said she could recognize and describe—to the news media. Her hope was to foster mistrust between the Clinton and Jones camps and forestall a settlement...

:I thought if I leaked the distinguishing characteristic it would show bad faith in negotiations. [Clinton lawyer] Bob Bennett would think Jones had leaked it. Cammaratta would know he himself hadn't leaked it and would get mad at Bennett. It might stall negotiations enough for me to get through to [Jones adviser] Susan Carpenter-McMillan to tell her that I thought settling would hurt Paula, that this would ruin her reputation, and that there were other lawyers working for her. Then 36 hours later, she returned my phone call.

:I just wanted to help Paula. I really think Paula Jones is a hero. I don't think I could have taken the abuse she came under. She's this poor little country girl and she has the most powerful man she's ever met hitting on her sexually, then denying it and smearing her as president. And she never did anything tacky. It's not like she was going on TV or trying to make a buck out of it.&quot;&lt;ref name=Daley1999 /&gt;}}

In his book, Isikoff also reported Coulter as saying: &quot;We were terrified that Jones would settle. It was contrary to our purpose of bringing down the President.&quot;&lt;ref name=conason&gt;Conason, Joe; Lyons, Gene. &quot;[http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/2000/03/04/willey/print.html Impeachment's little elves]&quot;. ''[[Salon.com]]''. March 4, 2000. Retrieved July 10, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After the book came out, Coulter clarified her stated motives, saying:

{{quote|The only motive for leaking the distinguishing characteristic item that [Isikoff] gives in his book is my self-parodying remark that &quot;it would humiliate the president&quot; and that a settlement would foil our efforts to bring down the president.... I suppose you could take the position, as [Isikoff] does, that we were working for Jones because we thought Clinton was a lecherous, lying scumbag, but this argument gets a bit circular. You could also say that Juanita Broaddrick's secret motive in accusing Clinton of rape is that she hates Clinton because he raped her. The whole reason we didn't much like Clinton was that we could see he was the sort of man who would haul a low-level government employee like Paula to his hotel room, drop his pants, and say, &quot;Kiss it.&quot; You know: Everything his defense said about him at the impeachment trial. It's not like we secretly disliked Clinton because of his administration's position on California's citrus cartels or something, and then set to work on some crazy scheme to destroy him using a pathological intern as our Mata Hari.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, Ann (May 1999). &quot;Spikey and me&quot;. [[George (magazine)|''George''.]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The case went to court after Jones broke with Coulter and her original legal team, and it was dismissed via [[summary judgment]]. The judge ruled that even if her allegations proved true, Jones did not show that she had suffered any damages, stating, &quot;...plaintiff has not demonstrated any tangible job detriment or adverse employment action for her refusal to submit to the governor's alleged advances. The president is therefore entitled to summary judgment on plaintiff's claim of [[quid pro quo]] sexual harassment.&quot; The ruling was [[appeal]]ed by Jones' lawyers. During the pendency of the appeal, Clinton settled with Jones for $850,000 ($151,000 after legal fees) in November 1998, in exchange for Jones' dismissal of the appeal. By then, the Jones lawsuit had given way to the [[Lewinsky scandal|Monica Lewinsky sex scandal]].

In October 2000, Jones revealed that she would pose for nude pictures in an adult magazine, saying she wanted to use the money to pay taxes and support her grade-school-aged children, in particular saying, &quot;I'm wanting to put them through college and maybe set up a college fund.&quot;&lt;ref name=larryking&gt;Jones, Paula. &quot;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0010/24/lkl.00.html Paula Jones describes why she's posing for ''Penthouse'']&quot;.

Coulter wrote:

===2008 presidential election===
As the 2008 presidential campaign was getting under way, Coulter drew criticism for statements she made at the 2007 [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] about presidential candidate [[John Edwards]]:&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradley_Tahman&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Bradley|first=Tahman|title=Controversial Columnist Draws Fire for Anti-Gay Slur|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=2924630|accessdate=September 27, 2011|newspaper=[[ABC News]]|date=March 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN_edwards_faggot_comment&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Coulter under fire for anti-gay slur|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2007-03-04/politics/coulter.edwards_1_anti-gay-slur-neil-g-giuliano-ann-coulter?_s=PM:POLITICS|accessdate=September 27, 2011|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=March 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the campaign waged on, she continued to insert her commentary regarding the candidates, both Democrats and Republicans. In a June 2007 interview, Coulter named [[Duncan Hunter]] as her choice for the 2008 Republican Presidential nomination, saying, &quot;My favorite candidate is [Rep.] Duncan Hunter [R-[[California|CA]]], and he is magnificent. The problem is most people say, &quot;Who's Duncan Hunter?&quot; He's a genuine war hero. He has one son, I think, in [[Iraq]], one in [[Afghanistan]]. He is good on every single issue.

On the January 31, 2008 broadcast of ''[[Hannity and Colmes]]'', Coulter claimed that if McCain won the Republican nomination for president, she would support and campaign for [[Hillary Clinton]], stating, &quot;[Clinton] is more conservative than McCain.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Parker_Jennifer&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Parker|first=Jennifer|title=Coulter: I Will Vote for Hillary Over McCain|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2008/02/coulter-i-will/|accessdate=September 27, 2011|newspaper=[[ABC News]]|date=February 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding then-presidential-candidate [[Barack Obama]] in an April 2, 2008 column, she characterized his book ''[[Dreams from My Father]]'' as a &quot;dimestore ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.&quot; Coulter writes, &quot;He says the reason black people keep to themselves is that it's 'easier than spending all your time mad or trying to guess whatever it was that white folks were thinking about you.' Here's a little inside scoop about white people: We're not thinking about you. Especially [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASPs]].

===2010 Canadian university tour===
[[File:Ann Coulter by Gage Skidmore 4.jpg|thumb|upright|Ann Coulter at [[Conservative Political Action Conference|CPAC]] in February 2012.]]
In March 2010, Coulter announced that she would be embarking on a speaking tour of three Canadian universities, The [[University of Western Ontario]], the [[University of Ottawa]] and the [[University of Calgary]]. The tour was organized by the [[International Free Press Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/783585--watch-your-mouth-ann-coulter-warned-for-canadian-tour?bn=1 | location=Toronto | work=The Star | title=Watch your mouth, Ann Coulter warned for Canadian tour | first=Bruce | last=Cheadle | date=March 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the eve of Coulter's first speech at the University of Western Ontario, an e-mail to Coulter from Francois Houle, provost of the University of Ottawa, was leaked to the media. The e-mail warned that &quot;promoting hatred against any identifiable group would not only be considered inappropriate, but could in fact lead to criminal charges.&quot; Coulter released a public statement pointing out that by sending her the e-mail, Houle was promoting hatred against conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsmax.com/InsideCover/coulter-canada-provost-hate/2010/03/23/id/353652 |title=Coulter: Canadian U Provost Guilty of Hate Crimes |publisher=Newsmax.com |date=2010-03-23 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her speech at the University of Western Ontario she told a Muslim student to &quot;take a [[camel]],&quot; in response to the student's question about previous comments by Coulter that Muslims should not be allowed on airplanes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ottawa.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20100324/OTT_Coulter_Rxn_100324/20100324/?hub=OttawaHome |title=Students divided over Coulter's cancelled speech |publisher=Ottawa.ctv.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, the University of Ottawa made international news when liberal protesters conspired to prevent Coulter from speaking. The event was canceled in spite of a massive security presence; Alain Boucher of the [[Ottawa Police Service]] said there were ten officers visible at the scene, &quot;plus other resources&quot; nearby.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitaljournal.com/article/289589 Ottawa police say they didn't shut Coulter down]; March 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Boucher alleged that Coulter's security team decided to call off the event, saying, &quot;We gave her options,&quot; including, he said, to &quot;find a bigger venue.&quot; But &quot;they opted to cancel ...

===Comments on Islam, Arabs and terrorism===
On September 14, 2001, three days after the [[9-11]] attacks (in which her friend [[Barbara Olson]] had been killed), Coulter wrote in her column:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Airports scrupulously apply the same laughably ineffective airport harassment to Suzy Chapstick as to [[Muslim]] [[Aircraft hijacking|hijackers]]. It is preposterous to assume every passenger is a potential crazed homicidal maniac. We know who the homicidal maniacs are. They are the ones cheering and dancing right now.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;We should invade ''their'' countries, kill their leaders and convert them to Christianity. We weren't punctilious about locating and punishing only [[Hitler]] and his top officers. We [[carpet bombing|carpet-bombed]] German cities; we killed civilians. That's war. And this is war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/coulter/coulter091301.shtml |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010914225811/http://www.nationalreview.com/coulter/coulter091301.shtml |archivedate=2001-09-14 |title=This Is War |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2001-09-14 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Responding to this comment, Ibrahim Hooper of the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] remarked in ''[[The Chicago Sun Times]]'' that before September 11, Coulter &quot;would have faced swift repudiation from her colleagues,&quot; but &quot;now it's accepted as legitimate commentary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Ritter, &quot;Muslims see a growing media bias&quot;, Chicago Sun Times, September 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Horowitz]], however, saw Coulter's words as irony:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I began running Coulter columns on Frontpagemag.com shortly after she came up with her most infamous line, which urged America to put [[jihad]]ists to the sword and convert them to Christianity. Liberals were horrified; I was not. I thought to myself, this is a perfect send-up of what our [[Islamo-fascism|Islamo-fascist]] enemies believe—that as infidels we should be put to the sword and converted to Islam. I regarded Coulter’s [[philippic|phillipic]] (sic) as a [[Swiftian]] commentary on liberal illusions of multi-cultural outreach to people who want to rip out our hearts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.frontpagemag.com/Articles/Read.aspx?GUID=%7B85013A39-1679-49EF-9799-DE762C337F95%7D The Trouble with &quot;Treason&quot;], by [[David Horowitz]], ''[[FrontPage Magazine]]'', July 08, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One day after the attacks (when death toll estimates were higher than later), Coulter asserted that only Muslims could have been behind the attacks:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Not all Muslims may be terrorists, but all terrorists are Muslims—at least all terrorists capable of assembling a murderous plot against America that leaves 7,000 people dead in under two hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Future widows&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter092801.asp |author=Coulter, Ann |title= Future widows of America: Write your congressman |work=Jewish World Review |accessdate=2007-04-16 |date=2001-09-28| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070416152942/http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter092801.asp| archivedate= 16 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coulter has been highly critical of the [[U.S. Department of Transportation]] and especially its then-secretary [[Norman Mineta]]. Her many criticisms include their refusal to use [[racial profiling]] as a component of airport screening.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, Ann. &quot;[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter022802.asp Mineta's Bataan death march]&quot;, ''Jewish World Review.'' February 28, 2002. Retrieved on July 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; After a group of Muslims were expelled from a [[US Airways]] flight when other passengers expressed concern, sparking a call for Muslims to boycott the airline because of the [[Flying Imams controversy|ejection from a flight of six imams]], Coulter wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;If only we could get Muslims to boycott all airlines, we could dispense with airport security altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/printer_friendly.cgi?article=158 |title=What can I do to make your flight more uncomfortable? |author= Coulter, Ann |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2007-04-17 |work=AnnCoulter.com| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070326071242/http://www.anncoulter.com/cgi-local/printer_friendly.cgi?article=158| archivedate= 26 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Coulter also cited the 2002 Senate testimony of FBI whistleblower [[Coleen Rowley]], who was acclaimed for condemning her superiors for refusing to authorize a [[search warrant]] for 9-11 conspirator [[Zacarias Moussaoui]] when he refused to consent to a search of his computer. They knew that he was a Muslim in flight school who had overstayed his visa, and the [[List of intelligence agencies of France|French Intelligence Service]] had confirmed his affiliations with radical fundamentalist Islamic groups. Coulter said she agreed that [[probable cause]] existed in the case, but that refusing consent, being in flight school and overstaying a visa shouldn't constitute grounds for a search. Citing a poll which found that 98 percent of Muslims between the ages of 20 and 45 said they would not fight for Britain in the war in [[Afghanistan]], and that 48 percent said they would fight for [[Osama bin Laden]],&lt;ref&gt;Coulter says the poll was &quot;by the &quot;[[Daily Telegraph]]&quot;, actually it was by Sunrise, an &quot;Asian&quot;(i.e., Indian subcontinent-oriented) radio station, canvassing the opinions of 500 Muslims in Greater London (not Britain as a whole), mainly of Pakistani origin and aged between 20 and 45. {{cite news

Coulter wrote in another column that she had reviewed the [[civil rights]] lawsuits against certain airlines to determine which of them had subjected [[Arab]]s to the most &quot;egregious discrimination&quot; so that she could fly only that airline. She also said that the airline should be bragging instead of denying any of the charges of discrimination brought against them.&lt;ref&gt;Coulter, Ann. &quot;[http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter043004.asp Arab hijackers now eligible for pre-boarding]&quot; ''Jewish World Review'' April 29, 2004.

In October 2007, Coulter made further controversial remarks regarding Arabs—in this case Iraqis—when she stated in an interview with ''[[The New York Observer]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;We’ve killed about 20,000 of them, of terrorists, of militants, of Al Qaeda members, and they’ve gotten a little over 3,000 of ours. That is where the war is being fought, in Iraq.

In a May 2007 article looking back at the life of recently deceased evangelical Reverend [[Jerry Falwell]], Coulter commented on his (later retracted) statement after the 9/11 attacks that &quot;the [[paganism|pagans]], and the [[abortion]]ists, and the [[feminist]]s, and the [[Homosexuality|gays]] and the [[lesbian]]s who are actively trying to make that an alternative lifestyle, the [[ACLU]], [[People For the American Way]], all of them who have tried to secularize America ... helped this happen.&quot; In her article, Coulter stated that she disagreed with Falwell's statement, &quot;because Falwell neglected to specifically include [[Ted Kennedy|Teddy Kennedy]] and 'the Reverend' [[Barry W.

In October 2007, Coulter participated in [[David Horowitz]]' &quot;Islamo-Fascism Awareness Week,&quot; remarking in a speech at the [[University of Southern California]], &quot;The fact of Islamo-Fascism is indisputable.

===2012 presidential election===
On October 22, 2012, following a presidential debate between Mitt Romney and Barack Obama, Coulter published the following tweet from her official Twitter account (@anncoulter): &quot;I highly approve of Romney's decision to be kind and gentle to the retard,&quot; drawing stiff criticism for her use of a word offensive to some people with &quot;[[special needs]]&quot; to describe the incumbent president of the United States.  The [[Special Olympics]] condemned Coulter in a tweet shortly after Coulter's.&lt;ref&gt; Grinberg, Emanuella.
