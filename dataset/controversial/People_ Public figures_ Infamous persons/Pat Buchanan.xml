'''Patrick Joseph &quot;Pat&quot; Buchanan''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|b|juː|ˈ|k|æ|n|ɪ-|n}}; born November 2, 1938) is an [[United States|American]] [[conservative]] [[political commentator]], [[author]], [[print syndication|syndicated]] [[columnist]], [[politician]], and [[presenter|broadcaster]]. Buchanan was a senior advisor to [[American Presidents]] [[Richard Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford]], and [[Ronald Reagan]], and was an original host on [[CNN]]'s ''[[Crossfire (TV series)|Crossfire]]''. He sought the [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] presidential nomination in [[1992 Republican presidential primary|1992]] and [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996]]. He ran on the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party]] ticket in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]].

He co-founded ''[[The American Conservative]]'' magazine and launched a foundation named The American Cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= American credo: the place of ideas in US politics|first=Michael |last=Foley| publisher=Oxford University Press | location = US|year=2007|ISBN = 0-19-923267-9 | page= 318}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been published in ''[[Human Events]], [[National Review]], [[The Nation]]'' and ''[[Rolling Stone]]''. He was a [[political commentator]] on the [[MSNBC]] cable network, including the show ''[[Morning Joe]]'' until February 2012. Buchanan is a regular on ''[[The McLaughlin Group]]'' and now appears on [[Fox News]].

==Early life and education==
Buchanan was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], a son of William Baldwin Buchanan ([[Virginia]], August 13, 1905 &amp;ndash; [[Washington, D.C.]], January 1988), a [[Partner (business rank)|partner]] in an [[Professional services|accounting firm]], and his wife Catherine Elizabeth (Crum) Buchanan ([[Charleroi, Pennsylvania|Charleroi]], [[Washington County, Pennsylvania|Washington County]], [[Pennsylvania]], December 23, 1911 – [[Oakton, Virginia|Oakton]], [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], [[Virginia]], September 18, 1995), a [[nurse]] and a [[homemaker]].&lt;ref name =wargs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/political/buchanan.html |title= The Ancestry of Pat Buchanan |publisher = Wargs | first1 = William Addams | last1 = Reitwiesner | first2 = Nolan Kent | last2 = Moran | first3 = Julie Helen | last3 = Otto |accessdate = 2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ThomsonGale-Bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notablebiographies.com/Br-Ca/Buchanan-Pat.html | work = Notable Biographies | title= Pat Buchanan Biography |accessdate=2006-11-01 |publisher=Thomson Gale}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Buchanan had six brothers (Brian, Henry, James, John, Thomas, and William Jr.) and two sisters (Kathleen Theresa and [[Angela Marie Buchanan|Angela Marie, nicknamed Bay]]).&lt;ref name = &quot;NNDB&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.nndb.com/people/053/000023981/ |title= Pat Buchanan | publisher= NNDB | accessdate= 2006-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bay served as [[Treasurer of the United States|U.S. Treasurer]] under [[Ronald Reagan]]. His father was of [[Scottish American|Scottish]], [[English American|English]], and [[Irish American|Irish]] descent and his mother was of [[German American|German]] ancestry.&lt;ref name = wargs /&gt; He had a great-grandfather who fought in the [[American Civil War]] in the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Army, which is why Pat is a member of the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.theamericancause.org/pathatedixie.htm | contribution = Why Do the Neocons Hate Dixie So? | title= The American cause | publisher = Patrick ‘Pat’ Joseph Buchanan | first = Patrick ‘Pat’ Joseph | last = Buchanan | date = November 26, 2003 | accessdate = 2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; and admires [[Robert E. Lee]].&lt;ref name = WaPo-Ironfist&gt;{{cite news| title = The Iron Fist of Pat Buchanan |work= [[The Washington Post]] |date=1992-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through his mother, he is a [[Cousin#Relationships_chart|fourth cousin twice removed]] of singer [[Marilyn Manson]].

Of his southern roots, Buchanan has written:

{{quote |text=I have family roots in the South, in [[Mississippi]]. When the [[United States Civil War|Civil War]] came, Cyrus Baldwin enlisted and did not survive [[Siege of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]]. William Buchanan of [[Okolona, Mississippi|Okolona]], who would marry Baldwin’s daughter, fought at [[Battle of Atlanta|Atlanta]] and was captured by [[William Tecumseh Sherman|General Sherman]]. William Baldwin Buchanan was the name given to my father and by him to my late brother.

As a member of the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]], I have been to their gatherings. I spoke at the 2001 SCV convention in [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette, LA]]. The [[Military Order of the Stars and Bars]] presented me with a battle flag and a wooden canteen like the ones my ancestors carried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last= Buchanan|first= Patrick ‘Pat’ Joseph |title= Why Do They Hate Dixie?|url= http://www.amconmag.com/article/2003/dec/01/00007/ | accessdate=28 December 2011|newspaper=The American Conservative|date=1 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Buchanan was born into a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] family and attended [[Catholic schools]], including the [[Jesuit]]-run [[Gonzaga College High School]].  As a student at [[Georgetown University]], he was in [[ROTC]] but did not complete the program.  He received his [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] notice after he graduated in 1960. However, the [[District of Columbia]] draft board exempted Buchanan from [[military]] service because of [[reactive arthritis]], classifying him as [[Class 1-A|4-F]]. He received a [[master's degree]] in [[journalism]] from [[Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism|Columbia]] in 1962, writing his thesis on the expanding trade between [[Canada]] and [[Cuba]].

==Professional career==

===''St. Louis Globe-Democrat'' Editorial Writer===
Buchanan joined the ''[[St. Louis Globe-Democrat]]'' at age 23. During the first year of the [[United States embargo against Cuba]] in 1961, [[Canada]]–Cuba trade tripled. The ''Globe-Democrat'' published a rewrite of Buchanan's Columbia master's project under the eight-column banner &quot;Canada sells to Red Cuba — And Prospers&quot; eight weeks after Buchanan started at the paper. According to Buchanan's memoir ''Right from the Beginning'', this article was a career milestone. However, Buchanan later said the embargo strengthened the [[communist]] regime and he turned against it.&lt;ref name= &quot;NCPA-Trade&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ncpa.org/pd/trade/pd010300a.html | title= Buchanan Is Right on Trade Sanctions | date = 2000-01-03 | accessdate =2006-11-01 |work=Daily Policy Digest |publisher=[[National Center for Policy Analysis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan was promoted to assistant editorial page editor in 1964 and supported [[Barry Goldwater]]'s presidential campaign. However, the ''Globe-Democrat'' did not endorse Goldwater and Buchanan speculated there was a clandestine agreement between the paper and President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Buchanan recalled: &quot;The conservative movement has always advanced from its defeats...  I can't think of a single conservative who was sorry about the Goldwater campaign.&quot;&lt;ref name = WaPo-Ironfist /&gt; According to the foreword (written by Pat Buchanan) in the most recent edition of ''Conscience of a Conservative'', Buchanan was a member of the [[Young Americans for Freedom]] and wrote press releases for that organization. He served as an executive assistant in the [[Mudge Rose Guthrie Alexander &amp; Ferdon|Nixon, Mudge, Rose, Guthrie, Alexander, and Mitchell]] law offices in New York City in 1965.

===Work for the Nixon White House===
[[File:Portrait of Patrick Buchanan, presidential aide - NARA - 194638.tif|thumb|right|150px|Buchanan on July 12, 1969]]
The next year, he was the first adviser hired by Nixon's presidential campaign;&lt;ref name= &quot;Trialbyfire&quot;&gt;{{cite news| last= Bruan | first= Stephen | title = A Trial by Fire in the '60s |work=Los Angeles Times |date= 1994-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; he worked primarily as an [[opposition researcher]]. For his speeches aimed at dedicated supporters, he was soon nicknamed &quot;Mr. Inside.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greatrighthope&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A41745-2004Sep22 | title= Pat Buchanan and the Great Right Hope |last= Blumenthal | first= Sidney | date = 1987-01-08 |work=Washington Post |page=C01 |accessdate=2006-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buchanan traveled with [[Nixon]] throughout the campaigns of 1966 and 1968. He made a tour of [[Western Europe]], [[Africa]], and, in the immediate aftermath of the [[Six-Day War]], the [[Middle East]]. When Nixon took [[the Oval Office]] in 1969, Buchanan worked as a [[White House]] [[Executive Office of the President of the United States|adviser and speechwriter]] for Nixon and vice president [[Spiro Agnew]]. Buchanan coined the phrase &quot;[[Silent Majority (Politics)|Silent Majority]]&quot; and helped shape the strategy that drew millions of [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democrats]] to Nixon; in a 1972 memo he suggested the White House &quot;should move to re-capture the anti-Establishment tradition or theme in American politics.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;BuchananInc&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.thenation.com/docprint.mhtml?i=19991122&amp;s=paulsen | title = Buchanan Inc. |last=Paulsen |first=Monte |work=Nation |date=1999-11-22 |accessdate=2006-11-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050428142022/http://www.thenation.com/docprint.mhtml?i=19991122&amp;s=paulsen | archivedate = April 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His daily duties included developing political strategy, publishing the President's ''Daily News Summary'', and preparing briefing books for news conferences.  He accompanied Nixon on his trip to [[China]] in 1972 and the summit in [[Moscow]], [[Yalta]], and [[Minsk]] in 1974. He suggested that Nixon label Democratic opponent [[George McGovern]] an extremist and burn the [[Watergate tapes|White House tapes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greatrighthope&quot; /&gt;

Buchanan remained as a special assistant to Nixon through the final days of the [[Watergate Scandal]]. He was not accused of wrongdoing, though some mistakenly suspected him of being [[Deep Throat (Watergate)|Deep Throat]]. When the actual identity of the press leak was revealed as [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] Associate Director [[W. Mark Felt|Mark Felt]] in 2005, Buchanan called him &quot;sneaky,&quot; &quot;dishonest,&quot; and &quot;criminal.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Feltnohero&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8060320/ |title= Nixon aides say Felt is no hero |publisher = MSNBC | date = 2005-06-01 |accessdate= 2006-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of his role in the Nixon campaign's &quot;Attack Group,&quot; Buchanan appeared before the [[United States Senate Watergate Committee|Senate Watergate Committee]] on September 26, 1973. He told the panel:

{{quote| text =The mandate that the American people gave to this president and his administration cannot and will not be frustrated or repealed or overthrown as a consequence of the incumbent tragedy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greatrighthope&quot; /&gt;}}

When Nixon resigned in 1974, Buchanan briefly stayed on as special assistant under incoming President [[Gerald Ford]].  Chief of Staff [[Alexander Haig]] approved Buchanan's appointment as [[United States Ambassador to South Africa|ambassador to South Africa]], but Ford refused it.&lt;ref name = &quot;Greatrighthope&quot; /&gt;

Buchanan remarked about [[Watergate]]:

{{quote|text=The lost opportunity to move against the political forces frustrating the expressed national will... To effect a political counterrevolution in the capital —... there is no substitute for a principled and dedicated man of the [[Right-wing politics|Right]] in the Oval Office.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greatrighthope&quot; /&gt;}}

Long after his resignation, Nixon called Buchanan a confidant and said he was neither a racist nor an anti-Semite nor a bigot or &quot;hater,&quot; but a &quot;decent, patriotic American.&quot; Nixon said Buchanan had &quot;some strong views,&quot; such as his &quot;isolationist&quot; foreign policy, with which he disagreed. While Nixon did not think Buchanan should become president, he said the commentator &quot;should be heard.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = 1992 Nixon Interview | contribution = Part 2, Bush's Foreign Policy | publisher = CNN | date = April 23, 1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Larry King Live | format = transcript | at = #1102 (R-#469) | publisher = CNN | date = April 23, 1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===News commentator===
{{POV|date=April 2011}}
Buchanan returned to his column and began regular appearances as a broadcast host and [[political commentator]]. He co-hosted a three-hour daily radio show with liberal columnist [[Tom Braden]] called the ''Buchanan-Braden Program''. He delivered daily commentaries on [[NBC]] radio from 1978 to 1984. Buchanan started his TV career as a regular on ''[[The McLaughlin Group]]'' and CNN's ''[[Crossfire (TV series)|Crossfire]]'' (inspired by ''Buchanan-Braden'') and ''The Capital Gang'', making him nationally recognizable. His several stints on ''[[Crossfire (TV series)|Crossfire]]'' occurred between 1982 and 1999; his sparring partners included Braden, [[Michael Kinsley]], [[Geraldine Ferraro]], and [[Bill Press]].

Buchanan is a regular panelist on the McLaughlin Group. He appears most Sundays alongside John McLaughlin, the more liberal Newsweek journalist Eleanor Clift.  On the McLauglin Group, Buchanan has made such comments as “‘Capitol Hill is Israeli occupied territory’ and ‘If you want to know ethnicity and power in the United States Senate, 13 members of the Senate are Jewish folks who are from 2 percent of the population. That is where real power is at…’”&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = ADL | title = Pat Buchanan in his own words | format = special report | url = http://www.adl.org/special_reports/buchanan_own_words/buchanan_intro.asp}}.&lt;/ref&gt;   His columns are syndicated nationally by [[Creators Syndicate]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.creators.com/opinion/pat-buchanan.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations of anti-semitism and Holocaust diminution===
{{POV-section|date=June 2011}}
Buchanan has written about [[the Holocaust]] and engaged in the defense of some accused of Nazi war crimes. For example, Buchanan wrote that it was impossible for 850,000 Jews to be killed by diesel exhaust fed into the gas chamber at Treblinka. These kind of statements have led to accusations that he has helped legitimize [[Holocaust denial]].   When [[George Will]] challenged him about it on TV, Buchanan failed to reply. In 1983 he criticized the U.S. Government for expressing regret over its postwar protection of [[Klaus Barbie]]. In 1985, Buchanan advocated restoring the citizenship of [[Arthur Rudolph]], an ex-Nazi rocket scientist accused of employing slave labor at a V-2 plant. In 1987, Buchanan lobbied to stop deportation of [[Karl Linnas]], accused of atrocities in Estonia. In 1991 [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]] wrote a 40,000-word ''[[National Review]]'' article discussing anti-Semitism amongst conservative commentators focused largely on Buchanan; the article and many responses to it were collected in the book ''In Search of Anti-Semitism'' (1992).  He concluded: &quot;I find it impossible to defend Pat Buchanan against the charge that what he did and said during the period under examination amounted to anti-Semitism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.newsweek.com/1991/12/23/is-pat-buchanan-anti-semitic.html | newspaper = Newsweek | date = 1991-12-23 | title = Is ‘Pat’ Buchanan anti-semitic?}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.nytimes.com/books/00/07/16/specials/buckley-anti.html | work= The New York Times | date = 2000-07-16 | title = Buckley’s In Search of Anti-Semitism}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Anti-Defamation League]] has called Buchanan an &quot;unrepentant bigot&quot; who &quot;repeatedly demonizes Jews and minorities and openly affiliates with white supremacists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.adl.org/special_reports/Patrick_Buchanan2/ | format = special report | title= Patrick Buchanan: Unrepentant Bigot | publisher= Anti-Defamation League | date = May 21, 2009 | accessdate = June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neo-conservative columnist [[Charles Krauthammer]] said about Buchanan that &quot;There's no doubt he makes subliminal appeals to prejudice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.salon.com/news/feature/1999/09/04/pat/ | title = Who's afraid of Pat Buchanan? | publisher = Salon | date = Sep 4, 1999 | accessdate= June 18, 2011 | author= Tapper, Jake | authorlink = Jake Tapper}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan has adamantly denied that he is [[antisemitic]], and a number of conservatives and his journalistic colleagues, some of them Jewish, including [[Jack Germond]], [[Al Hunt]], and [[Mark Shields]], have defended him against the charge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0411/is_n2_v45/ai_18579341/pg_4/ | publisher = Find Articles | work=Judaism | title = Pat Buchanan and the Jews | year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work for the Reagan White House===
Buchanan served as [[White House Communications Director]] from 1985 to 1987. Buchanan supported President Reagan's plan to visit a German military cemetery at [[Bitburg]] in 1985, where among buried [[Wehrmacht]] soldiers were 48 buried [[Waffen SS]] members. Over the vocal objections of [[Jewish]] groups, the trip went through. In an interview, author [[Elie Wiesel]] described attending a [[White House]] meeting of Jewish leaders about the trip:

{{quote| text =The only one really defending the trip was Pat Buchanan, saying, 'We cannot give the perception of the President being subjected to Jewish pressure.'&lt;ref name=&quot;WashingtonPost-1992&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Dionne|first=E. J.|title=Is Buchanan Courting Bias?| newspaper=The Washington Post |date=29 February 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Buchanan accused Wiesel of fabricating the story in an [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] interview in 1992:

{{quote | text =I didn't say it and Elie Wiesel wasn't even in the meeting.[...  T]hat meeting was held three weeks before the Bitburg summit was held. If I had said that, it would have been out of there within hours and on the news.&lt;ref&gt;quoted by ''Crossfire'', CNN, February 24, 1992, Transcript # 514&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a speech to the [[National Religious Broadcasters]] in 1986, Buchanan said about the &quot;Reagan Revolution,&quot;

{{quote | text =Whether President Reagan has charted a new course that will set our compass for decades{{mdash}}or whether history will see him as the conservative interruption in a process of inexorable national decline{{mdash}}is yet to be determined.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greatrighthope&quot; /&gt;}} 

A year later, he remarked that &quot;the greatest vacuum in American politics is to the right of Ronald Reagan.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Greatrighthope&quot; /&gt;  While her brother was working for Reagan, [[Bay Buchanan]] started a &quot;Buchanan for President&quot; movement in June 1986. She said the [[conservative]] movement needed a leader, but Buchanan was initially ambivalent.&lt;ref name = &quot;Greatrighthope&quot; /&gt;  After leaving the White House, he returned to his column and ''Crossfire''. Out of respect for [[Jack Kemp]] he sat out the 1988 race, although Kemp later became his adversary.&lt;ref name = &quot;BuchananInc&quot; /&gt;

==Political career==

===1992 presidential primaries===
{{Main|Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1992}}
In 1990, Buchanan published a newsletter called ''Patrick J. Buchanan: From the Right''; it sent subscribers a bumper sticker reading: &quot;Read Our Lips! No new taxes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | ifst = Charlotte | last = Hays | format = column | title = The Washington Times | date = July 27, 1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Buchanan explained his reasons for challenging the incumbent, President [[George H.W. Bush]]:
{{quote | text =If the country wants to go in a liberal direction, if the country wants to go in the direction of [Democrats] [[George J. Mitchell|George Mitchell]] and [[Tom Foley]], it doesn't bother me as long as I've made the best case I can. What I can't stand are the back-room deals. They're all in on it, the insider game, the establishment game{{mdash}}this is what we're running against.&lt;ref name=&quot;WaPo-Ironfist&quot; /&gt;}}

He ran on a platform of [[immigration reduction]] and [[social conservatism]], including opposition to [[multiculturalism]], [[abortion]], and [[gay rights]].  Buchanan seriously challenged Bush (whose popularity was waning) when he won 38 percent of the seminal [[New Hampshire primary]]. In the primary elections, Buchanan garnered three million total votes.

Buchanan later threw his support behind Bush and delivered a [[keynote address]] at the 1992 [[Republican National Convention]], which became known as the [[culture war]] speech, in which he described &quot;a religious war going on in our country for the soul of America.&quot; In the speech, he said of [[Bill Clinton|Bill]] and [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Clinton]]:

{{quote |text=The agenda Clinton &amp; Clinton would impose on America{{mdash}}abortion on demand, a litmus test for the Supreme Court, [[homosexual]] rights, discrimination against religious schools, women in combat units{{mdash}}that's change, all right. But it is not the kind of change America needs. It is not the kind of change America wants. And it is not the kind of change we can abide in a nation we still call God's country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Culturewarspeech&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.buchanan.org/pa-92-0817-rnc.html | title = Republican National Convention Speech |last= Buchanan | first= Patrick ‘Pat’ Joseph |date= 1992-08-17 | publisher= Patrick ‘Pat’ Joseph Buchanan | accessdate = 2006-11-04 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061012133633/http://www.buchanan.org/pa-92-0817-rnc.html |archivedate = October 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The enthusiastic applause he received prompted his detractors to claim that the speech alienated moderates from the Bush-Quayle ticket.&lt;ref name = &quot;CBS-BacksBush&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/18/politics/main650023.shtml | title = Buchanan Reluctantly Backs Bush | date =2004-10-18 |last=Kuhn |first=David Paul |work=News | publisher = CBS |accessdate=2006-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Off the campaign trail===
Buchanan returned to his column and ''Crossfire''. To promote the principles of federalism, traditional values, and anti-intervention, he founded [[The American Cause]], a [[conservative]] educational foundation in 1993. [[Bay Buchanan]] serves as the [[Vienna, Virginia|Vienna]], [[Virginia|VA]]-based foundation's president and Pat is its chairman.&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutAmericanCause&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theamericancause.org/about.htm | work =The American Cause | title = About the Cause |accessdate=2006-11-04 |publisher= Patrick ‘Pat’ Joseph Buchanan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Buchanan returned to [[radio]] as host of ''Buchanan and Company'', a three-hour talk show for [[Mutual Broadcasting System]] on July 5, 1993. It pitted him against liberal co-hosts, including [[Barry W. Lynn|Barry Lynn]], [[Bob Beckel]], and [[Chris Matthews]], in a time slot opposite [[Rush Limbaugh]]'s show. To launch his 1996 campaign, Buchanan left the program on March 20, 1995.

===1996 presidential primaries===
{{Main|Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1996}}
1996 saw Buchanan's most impressive attempt to win the Republican nomination.  With a Democratic President ([[Bill Clinton]]) seeking re-election, there was no incumbent Republican with a lock on the ticket. Indeed, with former President [[George H. W. Bush]] having made clear he was not interested in re-gaining the office, the closest the party had to a front-runner was the Senate Majority leader Sen. [[Robert Dole]] of [[Kansas]], who was considered to have many weaknesses.  Buchanan sought the Republican nomination from Dole's right, voicing his opposition to the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). Other candidates for the nomination included Sen. [[Phil Gramm]] of [[Texas]], former [[Governor of Tennessee|Tennessee Governor]] [[Lamar Alexander]] and the multi-millionaire publisher [[Steve Forbes]].

In February, the liberal [[Center for Public Integrity]] issued a report claiming Buchanan's presidential campaign co-chairman, [[Larry Pratt]], appeared at two meetings organized by white supremacist and militia leaders. Pratt denied any tie to racism, calling the report an orchestrated smear before the New Hampshire primary. Buchanan told the [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] ''[[New Hampshire Union Leader|Union Leader]]'' he believed Pratt. Pratt took a leave of absence &quot;to answer these charges,&quot; &quot;so as not to have distraction in the campaign.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Buchanan Aide Leaves Campaign Amid Charges | newspaper = [[The Union Leader]] | date = February 16, 1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Buchanan defeated Senator Bob Dole by about 3,000 votes to win the February [[New Hampshire primary]], getting his campaign off to an energetic start. He was endorsed by conservative icon [[Phyllis Schlafly]] among others.   He won three other states ([[Alaska]], [[Missouri]], and [[Louisiana]]), and finished only slightly behind Dole in the [[Iowa caucus]]. His insurgent campaign used his soaring rhetoric to mobilize grass-roots right wing opinion against what he saw as the bland [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] establishment (personified by Dole) which he believed had controlled the party for years. At a rally later in Nashua, he said:
{{quote |text=We shocked them in Alaska. Stunned them in Louisiana. Stunned them in Iowa. They are in a terminal panic. They hear the shouts of the peasants from over the hill. All the knights and barons will be riding into the castle pulling up the drawbridge in a minute. All the peasants are coming with pitchforks. We're going to take this over the top.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1996/02/20/news/20iht-camp.t_11.html?scp=5&amp;sq=pat%20buchanan%20donnybrook&amp;st=cse | title = Republicans Wind Up Bare-Fisted Donnybrook in New Hampshire | first = Brian | last = Knowlton | newspaper = [[International Herald Tribune]] | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | date = Tuesday, February 20, 1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The line &quot;The peasants are coming with [[pitchfork]]s&quot; became somewhat of a slogan for the campaign, with Buchanan occasionally appearing with a prop pitchfork at rallies.

In the [[Super Tuesday]] primaries, however, Dole defeated Buchanan by large margins. Having collected only 21 percent of the total votes in Republican primaries, Buchanan suspended his campaign in March. He declared however that, if Dole were to choose a [[pro-choice]] running mate, he would run as the US Taxpayers Party (now [[Constitution Party (United States)|Constitution Party]]) candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author-link = Skipp Porteous| last = Porteous | first = Skipp | url = http://www.publiceye.org/ifas/fw/9604/phillips.html | date = 1996-4 | title = Howard Phillips on Pat Buchanan | journal = Freedom Writer | publisher = Public Eye}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Dole chose [[Jack Kemp]] and he received Buchanan's endorsement. After the 1996 campaign, Buchanan returned to his column and ''Crossfire''. He also began a series of books with 1998's ''The Great Betrayal''.

===2000 presidential campaign===
{{Main|Reform Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2000}}
Buchanan announced his departure from the Republican Party in October 1999, disparaging them (along with the Democrats) as a &quot;[[beltway]] party.&quot; He sought the nomination of the [[United States Reform Party|Reform Party]]. Many reformers backed [[Iowa]] physicist [[John Hagelin]], whose platform was based on [[Transcendental Meditation]].  Party founder [[Ross Perot]] did not endorse a candidate, but his former running-mate [[Pat Choate]] endorsed Buchanan.

Supporters of Hagelin charged the results of the party's open primary, which favored Buchanan by a wide margin, were &quot;tainted.&quot;  The Reform Party divisions led to dual conventions being held simultaneously in separate areas of the Long Beach Convention Center complex. Both conventions' delegates ignored the primary ballots and voted to nominate their presidential candidates from the floor, similar to the Democratic and Republican conventions. One convention nominated Buchanan while the other backed Hagelin, with each camp claiming to be the legitimate Reform Party.

Ultimately, when the [[Federal Elections Commission]] ruled Buchanan was to receive ballot status as the Reform candidate, as well as about $12.6 million in federal campaign funds secured by Perot's showing in the [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996 election]], Buchanan won the nomination.  In his acceptance speech, Buchanan proposed US withdrawal from the [[United Nations]] and expelling the UN from New York, abolishing the [[Internal Revenue Service]], [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]], [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]], taxes on inheritance and capital gains, and [[affirmative action]] programs.

As his running mate, Buchanan chose [[African-American]] activist and retired teacher from [[Los Angeles]], [[Ezola B. Foster]]. Buchanan was supported in this election run by future [[Socialist Party USA]] presidential candidate [[Brian Moore (politician)|Brian Moore]], who said in 2008 he supported Buchanan in 2000 because &quot;he was for fair trade over [[free trade]]. He had some [[Progressivism|progressive]] positions that I thought would be helpful to the common man.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;indy weekly&quot;&gt;{{cite news |date=2008-10-08 |work= [[Independent Weekly]] |title= Q&amp;A with Socialist Party presidential candidate Brian Moore |url= http://www.indyweek.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A266409}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 19, the [[New York Right to Life Party]], in convention, chose Buchanan as their nominee, with 90% of the districts voting for him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | date = 2000-08-01 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20020820004727/http://ballot-access.org/2000/0901.html#16 | url = http://ballot-access.org/2000/0901.html#16 | title = Right To Life Party Picks Buchanan | publisher = Ballot Access News | archivedate = 2002-08-20}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], Buchanan finished fourth with 449,895 votes, 0.4% of the popular vote. (Hagelin garnered 0.1 percent as the [[United States Natural Law Party|Natural Law]] candidate.) In [[Palm Beach County, Florida]], Buchanan received 3,407 votes{{mdash}}which some saw as inconsistent with [[Palm Beach County]]'s liberal leanings, its large Jewish population and his showing in the rest of the state. As a result of the county's now-infamous &quot;[[United States presidential election, 2000 Florida results#Palm Beach County's butterfly ballots|butterfly ballot]]&quot;, he is suspected to have gained thousands of inadvertent votes. Bush spokesman [[Ari Fleischer]] stated, &quot;Palm Beach county is a Pat Buchanan stronghold and that's why Pat Buchanan received 3,407 votes there.&quot; However, Reform Party officials strongly disagreed, estimating the number of supporters in the county at between 400 and 500.  Appearing on ''The Today Show'', Buchanan said:

{{quote|text=When I took one look at that ballot on Election Night... it's very easy for me to see how someone could have voted for me in the belief they voted for [[Al Gore]].&lt;ref name=&quot;salon&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Tapper, Jake |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/politics/feature/2000/11/10/buchanan/ |date=2000-11-10 |title= Buchanan camp: Bush claims are &quot;nonsense&quot; |accessdate= 2008-11-30 |publisher= Salon |quote= Both McConnell and Cunningham say that they agree with the comments of Buchanan himself on Thursday's &quot;Today&quot; show}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some observers said his campaign was aimed to spread his message beyond his white conservative and populist base, while his views had not changed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Havrilesky |first=Heather |url=http://archive.salon.com/news/feature/1999/10/25/buchanan/ |title= Not standing Pat | publisher= Salon |date = 1999-10-25 |accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In retrospect, Buchanan told ''[[The Daily Caller]]'' explicitly in October 2012 that his &quot;What cost Al Gore Florida in 2000, and the presidency, was the 'butterfly ballot'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://dailycaller.com/2012/10/16/pat-buchanan-romney-will-win-florida/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later political involvement===
Following the 2000 election, Reform Party members urged Buchanan to take an active role within the party. Buchanan declined, though he did attend their 2001 convention. In the next few years, he identified himself as a political independent, choosing not to align himself with what he viewed as the [[neo-conservative]] Republican party leadership. Prior to the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 election]], Buchanan announced he once again identified himself as a Republican, declared that he had no interest in ever running for president again, and reluctantly endorsed Bush's 2004 re-election, writing:
{{quote|text=Bush is right on taxes, judges, sovereignty, and values. [[John Kerry|Kerry]] is right on nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.washingtontimes.com/national/20040909-115705-2949r.htm | title = Third parties seen as thread to Bush | first = Stephen ‘Steve’ | last = Miller | newspaper = [[Washington Times]] | date = September 10, 2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Buchanan also endorsed [[2012 Presidential election (United States)|Republican Presidential candidate]] [[Mitt Romney]] in 2012, stating in an article that &quot;Obama offers more of the stalemate America has gone through for the past two years&quot; while &quot;Romney alone offers a possibility of hope and change.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurasiareview.com/30102012-patrick-buchanan-romney-for-president-oped/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to private life==

===MSNBC commentator===
[[Image:Buchananinterview.JPG|thumb|Buchanan being interviewed in 2008]]
Although CNN decided not to take him back, Buchanan's column resumed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wapo-050106&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/30/AR2006043001185.html |title=Tony Snow's Washington Merry-Go-Round |last= Kurtz |first= Howard |work= Washington Post |date=2006-05-01 |page=C01 |accessdate=2006-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A longer variation of the ''[[Crossfire (TV series)|Crossfire]]'' format was aired by MSNBC as ''[[Buchanan and Press]]'' on July 15, 2002, reuniting Buchanan and Press. Billed as &quot;the smartest hour on television&quot;, ''Buchanan and Press'' featured the duo interviewing guests and sparring about the top news stories. As the [[Iraq War]] loomed, Buchanan and Press toned down their rivalry, as they both opposed the invasion.&lt;ref name=Bloom&gt;Bloom, Jordan (2012-06-06) [http://www.theamericanconservative.com/articles/when-news-is-propaganda/ When News Is Propaganda], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Press claims they were the first cable hosts to discuss the planned attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.billpress.com/television.html |author= William ‘Bill’ Press | title= Making Air-Waves | accessdate = 2006-12-05 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061107235749/http://www.billpress.com/television.html | archivedate = November 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; MSNBC Editor-in-Chief [[Jerry Nachman]] once jokingly lamented this unusual situation:
{{quote |text=So the point is why does only Fox [News Channel] get this? At least, we work at the perfect place, the place that's fiercely independent. We try to have balance by putting you two guys together and then this [[Stockholm syndrome]] love fest set in between the two of you, and we no longer even have robust debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Buchanan and Press | date = November 19, 2002 | format = broadcast}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Just hours after his talk show debuted, Buchanan was a guest on the premiere of MSNBC's ill-fated ''Donahue'' program.  Host [[Phil Donahue]] and Buchanan debated the separation of church and state.  Buchanan called Donahue &quot;dictatorial&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Buchanan | first = Patrick ‘Pat’ Joseph | title = Donahue | publisher = MSNBC | quote = Cut it out, Phil.  What you want done is, I say no Jewish kid can be put in a Nativity play. What you want done is no Nativity play, no Pledge of Allegiance, no Bible in school, no Ten Commandments.  You are dictatorial, Phil.  You're a dictatorial liberal and you don't even know it}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and teased that the host got his job through affirmative action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.austinchronicle.com/gyrobase/Issue/column?oid=oid%3A98320 | title= The Phil-ing Station | last = Acosta | first = Belinda | work = Austin Chronicle |date=2002-07-26 |accessdate=2006-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MSNBC President [[Eric Sorenson]] canceled ''Buchanan and Press'' on November 26, 2003, due to its hosts' opposition to the [[Iraq War]].&lt;ref name=Bloom/&gt; Buchanan stayed at MSNBC as a political analyst.  He regularly appeared on the network's talk shows. He occasionally filled in on the nightly show ''[[Scarborough Country]]'' during its run on MSNBC. Buchanan also was a frequent guest and co-host of ''[[Morning Joe]]'' as well as ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews|Hardball]]'' and ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]''.

In September 2009, MSNBC removed a Buchanan opinion column from its website after receiving complaints from Jewish organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://jta.org/news/article/2009/09/03/1007639/njdc-urges-msnbc-to-remove-pat-buchanans-column-defending-hitler | title = MSNBC removes Buchanan column defending Hitler | publisher = Jewish Telegraphic Agency | date = 3 September 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Buchanan had used the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the German invasion of Poland to argue that Britain should not have declared war on Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Calderone | first = Michael | format = blog | url = http://www.politico.com/blogs/michaelcalderone/0909/Buchanan_column_removed_from_MSNBC_site.html | title = MSNBC removes Buchanan column from site | journal = Politico | date = 3 September 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first =Patrick ‘Pat’ Joseph | last = Buchanan|url=http://buchanan.org/blog/did-hitler-want-war-2068 |title=Did Hitler Want War?| publisher = Patrick ‘Pat’ Joseph Buchanan |date=September 2009|accessdate=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This revived charges of anti-Semitism and helping to legitimize [[Holocaust denial]] and so on. 

In January 2012, Buchanan was indefinitely suspended from MSNBC as a contributor and MSNBC President Phil Griffin said he had not decided whether to let Buchanan come back. The minority advocacy group [[Color of Change]] had urged MSNBC to fire him over alleged racist slurs.&lt;ref name= &quot;20120117_suspension&quot;&gt;[[Associated Press]], 7 January 2012, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/01/07/pat-buchanan-done-msnbc_n_1191701.html?ref=media MSNBC chief says he hasn’t decided whether commentator Pat Buchanan will return to network], hosted [[Washington Post]], accessed 2012-01-07&lt;/ref&gt;  MSNBC permanently parted ways with Buchanan on February 16, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shahid|first=Aliyah|title=Pat Buchanan booted from MSNBC four months after being suspended over controversial book|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/pat-buchanan-booted-msnbc-months-suspended-controversial-book-article-1.1024404|publisher=''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]''|accessdate=2012-02-17|date=2012-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The American Conservative'' Magazine===
{{Main|The American Conservative}}
In 2002, to start a new magazine featuring [[paleoconservative]] viewpoints on the economy, immigration and foreign policy, Buchanan joined with former ''[[New York Post]]'' editorial page editor [[Scott McConnell]] and financier [[Taki Theodoracopulos]]. ''[[The American Conservative]]'''s first issue was dated October 7, 2002.

===On Supreme Court appointments===
In a 2010 column, Buchanan expressed his disapproval of [[Barack Obama]]'s nomination of [[Elena Kagan]], to the [[United States Supreme Court]]. Buchanan wrote: &quot;If Kagan is confirmed, Jews, who represent less than 2 percent of the US population, will have 33 percent of the Supreme Court seats. Is this the Democrats' idea of diversity?&quot; &lt;ref name =&quot;kagan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://mediamatters.org/blog/201005140037|title= Buchanan complains that with Kagan, Supreme Court will have too many Jews | publisher = Media matters | accessdate=May 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wndkagan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wnd.com/index.php?fa=PAGE.view&amp;pageId=153417 |title= Are liberals anti-WASP?|accessdate=May 14, 2010 | publisher = WND}}&lt;/ref&gt;
