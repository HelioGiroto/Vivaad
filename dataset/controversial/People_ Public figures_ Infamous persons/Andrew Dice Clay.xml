==Early life==
Clay was born in the [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn, New York]], the son of Doris and Fred Silverstein, who worked in real estate sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/87/Andrew-Dice-Clay.html Andrew Dice Clay Biography (1957–)].

He was a fairly proficient drummer at [[James Madison High School (New York)|James Madison High School]], and played [[bar mitzvahs]] and casual dates as &quot;Clay Silvers.&quot;

==Career==
In 1978, he auditioned at [[Pips]], a local comedy club in [[Sheepshead Bay, Brooklyn]], doing comedic impressions, then headlined there the following week as &quot;Andrew Clay.&quot; His act at the time included an impression of [[John Travolta]] in ''[[Grease (movie)|Grease]]'' and [[Jerry Lewis]] as ''[[The Nutty Professor]]''. Clay graduated to the major [[Manhattan]] comedy clubs, including [[Budd Friedman]]'s [[The Improv]], [[Catch a Rising Star]] and [[Dangerfield's]]. His move to [[Los Angeles]] came in 1980. He was &quot;adopted&quot; there by [[Mitzi Shore]], owner of the famed [[Comedy Store]]. His work at the Store led to [[sitcom]] appearances on ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'' and ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]''. He later landed roles in movies such as ''[[Making the Grade (film)|Making the Grade]]'' ([[1984 in film|1984]]) and ''[[Pretty in Pink]]'' ([[1986 in film|1986]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.nytimes.com/person/13535/Andrew-Dice-Clay/filmography Andrew Dice Clay – Filmography – Movies &amp; TV – NYTimes.com]. Movies.nytimes.com. Retrieved on 2011-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

He had a regular role on ''[[Crime Story (TV series)|Crime Story]]'' from [[1986 in television|1986]] – [[1988 in television|1988]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,168450,00.html Crime Story | TV].

Retrieved on 2011-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually turned from acting to pursue a career in [[stand-up comedy]], focusing on the character &quot;Dice&quot; from ''Making the Grade''. His big break came in 1988 when he did a seven-minute set at [[Dangerfield's]] during the [[Rodney Dangerfield]] special &quot;Nothing Goes Right.&quot; It was there that he met his agent Dennis Arfa and later got his first HBO special.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/15/arts/television-review-the-dice-is-back-and-so-is-the-act.html?src=pm TELEVISION REVIEW;The 'Dice' Is Back, And So Is the Act – New York Times].

===Later works===
Clay retreated from the media spotlight for several years. For several years he was rumored to have run a fitness gym in Brooklyn, but later verified on an interview with CNN that this was not true. 1995 saw him try to reclaim his fame with the broadcast of the HBO special ''Assume the Position.'' The special failed to reignite Clay's career.

In 1998, Clay released the triple-live album &quot;Filth&quot; via the Internet. Soon afterward, Clay aligned himself with New York City-based talk program ''[[Opie and Anthony|The Opie and Anthony Show]]''.

To coincide with the release of 2000's &quot;Face Down, Ass Up,&quot; [[Opie and Anthony]] teamed up with Clay to allow him to perform at [[Madison Square Garden]].

In 2005, Clay signed a deal with [[Sirius Satellite Radio|Sirius]] to produce and broadcast his own show, ''Out of the Cage''.

In 2007, he attempted a comeback with the reality TV series ''[[Dice: Undisputed]]'' on VH1, which lasted seven episodes.&lt;ref name=Heff07&gt;{{cite news| last = Heffernan

He appeared as a part of [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Celebrity Apprentice 2]]'' and was the first celebrity to be fired, after he openly entertained the idea of quitting while in [[Donald Trump]]'s presence. On ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'', Clay stated that the show was edited to exclude situations where Trump treated Clay poorly based on his comic treatment of women rather than his accomplishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siriushowardstern.blogspot.com/2009/03/andrew-dice-clay-talk-celebrity.html |title=Howard Stern Show: Andrew Dice Clay Talk Celebrity Apprentice On the howard stern show |publisher=Siriushowardstern.blogspot.com |date=2009-03-03 |accessdate=2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the season, each celebrity was raising money for a charity of their choice; Clay had selected [[StandUp For Kids]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20090108nbc01 Breaking News – NBC Announces the 16 All-Star Celebrities Ready to Take on Donald Trump in the Boardroom When 'The Celebrity Apprentice' Premieres Sunday, March 1 (9 p.m. ET)].

In July 2011, Clay was featured in the eighth and final season of [[Entourage (TV series)|Entourage]] as Johnny Drama's co-star in the fictional program ''Johnny's Bananas''.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/entourage-books-andrew-dice-clay-171935 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Philiana | last=Ng | title='Entourage' Books Andrew Dice Clay for Final Season | date=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He also appeared in an episode of ''[[Raising Hope]]'' as himself which aired on November 29, 2011

In May of 2012, Clay appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast. He also did a set at [[The Bamboozle]] festival in [[Asbury Park]], being the only comedian to be invited to the show.

== Controversy ==

Clay is known for a style of comedy that has sparked controversy and much media coverage. He is loved by some and reviled by others, who feel that his act is crude, [[misogynistic]], [[racist]], [[homophobic]] and degrading. Clay has been widely opposed by women's rights groups and he has been banned from many radio and television shows for his explicit language and socially and politically charged humor. [[MTV]] banned him for life in 1989 for reciting what he called &quot;adult nursery rhymes&quot; during the annual Video Music Awards ceremony (September 6, 1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/1989/ |title=MTV.com, &quot;1989 Video Music Awards&quot; |publisher=Mtv.com |date=1989-09-06 |accessdate=2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the ban was lifted by MTV.  

In 1990, Clay was invited to guest host the weekly comedy TV show ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. Cast member [[Nora Dunn]] declared her refusal to ever appear on the same broadcast as Clay and did not participate in the episode of his guest appearance (May 12). SNL alumnus [[Jon Lovitz]] discussed Dunn's boycott of the show in detail during an episode of “The ABC’s of SNL” with director Kevin Smith. &quot;It's the last show of the season. Nora...she caused a lot of trouble. [She] was very hard to get along with, and they weren't going to ask her back, anyway...And this is how the press works. And I'm telling you I'm on the inside of this. They don't know the story. It's like she's just doing it to get press. It's her last hurrah. They're not asking her back onto the show.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smodcast.com/channels/the-abcs-of-snl/ |title=&quot;Episode #5 ABC's of SNL&quot; |publisher=Smodcast.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Invited musical guest [[Sinéad O'Connor]] also boycotted Clay's appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/14/arts/review-television-saturday-night-live-with-andrew-dice-clay.html?src=pm Review/Television; 'Saturday Night Live,' With Andrew Dice Clay – New York Times]. Nytimes.com (1990-05-14). Retrieved on 2011-03-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2006 interview with [[CNN]], Clay was asked by the interviewer if he had been running a gym since his comedy career diminished. He then proceeded, before walking out of the interview, to go on a profanity laced tirade that the news anchors never know what they are talking about.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WlLslb-Royo&amp;feature=endscreen]. Video of Andrew Dice Clay at CNN]. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 2002, he divorced his wife and focused in part on raising his two sons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Cruz|first=Aceli|year = 2009|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/archives/2009/01/interview_andre.php| title=Interview: Andrew &quot;Dice&quot; Clay|publisher=The Village Voice}}&lt;/ref&gt;
One of his sons, Max, has since followed his father into stand-up comedy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year = 2011| url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_197_-_andrew_dice_clay_max_silverstein| title=Interview: Andrew Dice Clay/ Max Silverstein|publisher=WTF with Marc Maron Podcast}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally opens for him on tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year = 2011| url=http://www.vegasvideonetwork.com/awkward-silence-2-1-009-comedian-andrew-dice-clay/| title=Interview: Andrew Dice Clay|publisher=Awkward Silence 2.1, Vegas Video Network}}&lt;/ref&gt;
