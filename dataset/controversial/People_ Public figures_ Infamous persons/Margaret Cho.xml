'''Margaret Moran Cho''' (born December 5, 1968) is an American comedian, [[fashion design]]er, actress, author, and [[singer-songwriter]]. Cho, of Korean descent, is best known for her [[Stand-up comedy|stand-up routines]], through which she critiques social and political problems, especially those pertaining to [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] and [[Human sexuality|sexuality]]. She has also directed and appeared in music videos and has her own clothing line. She has frequently supported [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]] and has won awards for her humanitarian efforts on behalf of women, [[Asian American|Asians]], and the [[LGBT]] community.

As an actress she has played more serious parts, such as Charlene Lee in ''[[It's My Party (film)|It's My Party]]'' and that of [[John Travolta]]'s  [[FBI]] colleague in the action movie ''[[Face/Off]]''.  She is part of the TV series ''[[Drop Dead Diva]]'' on Lifetime Television, playing the role of Teri Lee, a [[paralegal]] assistant.

==Early life==
Cho was born into a [[Korean American|Korean]] family in [[San Francisco]], California. She grew up in a racially diverse neighborhood in the 1970s and 1980s, which she described as a community of &quot;old [[Hippy|hippies]], ex-druggies, burn-outs from the '60s, [[drag queen]]s, [[Chinese American|Chinese people]], and Koreans. To say it was a melting pot — that's the least of it. It was a really confusing, enlightening, wonderful time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.margaretcho.com/content/bio/ &quot;Biography&quot;]. ''Margaret Cho: Official Site''. August 15, 2008. Retrieved September 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cho's parents, Young-Hie and Seung-Hoon Cho,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/Margaret-Cho.html |title=Margaret Cho Biography  |accessdate=2007-12-29 |work=Film Reference }}&lt;/ref&gt; ran Paperback Traffic, a [[bookstore]] on [[Polk Street]] at [[California Street (San Francisco)|California Street]] in San Francisco. Her father writes joke books and a newspaper column in [[Seoul]], South Korea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800247891/bio |title=Margaret Cho Biography |publisher=Yahoo! Movies }}&lt;/ref&gt; After Cho expressed an interest in performance, she auditioned and was accepted into the [[School of the Arts High School (San Francisco)|San Francisco School of the Arts]], an area arts high school. While at the school, she became involved with the school's [[improvisational comedy]] group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.margaretcho.com/articles/individual_articles/asian_week_article.htm |title=As Nasty As She Wants to Be |author=Dann McDorman |date=2001-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside actor [[Sam Rockwell]].

==Early career==
After doing several shows in a club adjacent to her parents' bookstore, Cho launched a stand-up career and spent several years developing her material in clubs. Cho's career began to build after appearances on television and university campuses. In 1992, she appeared on the unsuccessful ''[[Golden Girls]]'' spin-off ''[[The Golden Palace]]'' in a small role. In 1994, Cho won the [[American Comedy Award]] for Best Female Comedian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://theenvelope.latimes.com/search/env-past-winners-search,0,1243372,results.formprofile?Query=margaret+cho&amp;selectsearch=pastwinners&amp;target=article&amp;Lib=turbine_cdb_lib%3Aresult_doc_id+result_doc_rank+document_id+cdb_num+cdb_01_txt+cdb_02_txt+cdb_03_txt+cdb_04_txt+cdb_01_num&amp;SortBy=COMPOSITE_RANK+desc&amp;PageSize=10&amp;Page=1&amp;MinCoarseRank=500&amp;QueryType=CONCEPT&amp;x=0&amp;y=0 | author = TheEnvelope.com | title = Margaret Cho search results | work=The Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', she discussed her nervousness about doing ''The Golden Palace'' and thanked the late [[Rue McClanahan]] for her help with rehearsing. Also in the early years of her career, she secured a coveted spot as opening act for [[Jerry Seinfeld]] and was featured on a [[Bob Hope]] special. She was also a frequent visitor to ''[[The Arsenio Hall Show]]''.&lt;ref name=adsample&gt;{{cite web|last=Tang |first=Jean |url=http://www.jademagazine.com/Ad_sample_large.html |title=No Laughing Matter – Margaret Cho sounds off on political correctness, Asians in the media, and defying her parents |publisher=Jade Magazine |date=October 2002 |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television career==

===''All American Girl''===
{{Main|All American Girl (1994 TV series)}}
That same year, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] developed and aired a sitcom based on Cho's stand-up routine. The show, ''[[All American Girl (1994 TV series)|All American Girl]]'', was initially feted as the first show prominently featuring an East Asian family, although the short lived sitcom ''[[Mr. T and Tina]]'' preceded it by nearly two decades.

Cho has expressed subsequent regret for much of what transpired during the production of the show.
* After network executives, especially executive producer [[Gail Berman]], criticized her appearance and the roundness of her face, Cho starved herself for several weeks. Her rapid [[weight loss]], done to modify her appearance by the time the pilot episode was filmed, caused serious kidney failure.&lt;ref name=ITOTIW-NYDN&gt;{{cite news|title=Cho Tells A H'wood Horror Story|url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/1999-07-18/gossip/18119680_1_margaret-cho-abc-sitcom-all-american-girl-pounds-in-two-weeks|accessdate=11 June 2012|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=18 July 1999|author=George Rush|author2=Joanna Molloy|author3=Marcus Baram|author4=Marc S. Malkin|quote=Cho says executive producer Gail Berman [...] told her, &quot;The network has a problem with the fullness of your face.&quot; Cho's dieting got so bad she lost 30 pounds in two weeks that she made a secret trip to an emergency room when her kidneys failed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The show suffered criticism from within the U.S. East Asian community over its perception of [[Stereotype|stereotyping]]. Producers told Cho at different times during production both that she was &quot;too Asian&quot; and that she was &quot;not Asian enough&quot;. At one point during the course of the show, producers hired a coach to teach Cho how to &quot;be more Asian&quot;.&lt;ref name=adsample /&gt;
* Much of the humor was broad, and at times stereotypical portrayals of her close Korean relatives and gay book-shop customers were employed.

The show was canceled after suffering from poor ratings and the effect of major content changes over the course of its single season (19 episodes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Sam |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2136087/ |title=Saved by the Gong: The sitcom that turned Margaret Cho into a cultural hero |publisher=Slate |date=February 23, 2006 |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the show's 1995 cancellation, Cho became addicted to drugs including alcohol. As detailed in her 2002 autobiography, ''I'm the One That I Want,'' in 1995 her substance abuse was evident during a performance in [[Monroe, Louisiana]], where she was booed off the stage by 800 college students after going on the stage [[drunk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianweek.com/2001_11_09/feature.html Margaret Cho’s mix of raunch and self-help conquers America]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Year's Rockin' Eve===
At the same time ''[[All American Girl (1994 TV series)|All American Girl]]'' underwent a difficult period, Margaret Cho hosted the [[Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest|New Year's Rockin' Eve 95]] show with [[Steve Harvey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Margaret Cho with Steve Harvey hosting New Year's Rockin' Eve 1995|publisher=Hollywood.com|url=http://www.hollywood.com/tv/Dick_Clarks_New_Years_Rockin_Eve_95/5175998 |accessdate=2009-04-09

===Other appearances===
Cho and her family and friends appeared in an episode of NBC's series ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]'', which premiered on June 24, 2008. Later that summer, Cho appeared in her own semi-scripted reality sitcom for [[VH1]]. ''[[The Cho Show]]'' premiered on August 21, 2008&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asianweek.com/2008/09/04/asian-reality-what-were-watching-this-fall/ |title=What We’re Watching This Fall |work=[[AsianWeek]] |accessdate=September 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lasted one season. She next appeared as a supporting actress on the series ''[[Drop Dead Diva]]'', which debuted in July 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sovo.com/2009/5-8/arts/television/10083.cfm Atlanta’s newest ‘Diva’ – Southern Voice]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Cho guest starred on the comedy ''[[30 Rock]]'' in the episode &quot;Everything Sunny All the Time Always&quot;. She played North Korean leader [[Kim Jong-Il]]. The role had her speak Korean as well as English. She was nominated for a [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.tv.com/30-rock/show/58326/viewer.html?flag=1&amp;i=1&amp;gri=58326&amp;grti=101 |title=Tina Fey – 30 Rock |publisher=TV.com |date=April 29, 2011 |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Cho  appeared as a contestant on the 11th season of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dos Santos |first=Kristin |url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b197540_dancing_with_stars_sources_confirm.html |title=Dancing With the Stars Sources Confirm Margaret Cho and Jennifer Grey—Guess Which One Gets Derek Hough? |publisher=E!

She appeared on the YouTube comedy show [[Equals Three]] as the Comment Question of the Day.

==Books==

===''I'm the One That I Want''===
Cho's career and personal life were challenging after the cancellation of the show, but Cho eventually sobered, refocused her energy and developed new material. In 1999, she wrote about her struggles with the show in her first one-woman show, ''[[I'm the One That I Want (film)|I'm the One That I Want]]''. Cho then released her book of the same name, and the show was filmed and released as a concert film in 2000. Her material dealt with her difficulties breaking into show business because of her ethnicity and weight and her resulting struggle with and triumph over body image issues and drug and alcohol addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thecelebritycafe.com/interviews/margaret_cho.html | title=Cho, Margaret – Comedienne, Actress | first=Dominick | last=Miserandino | publisher=[[The Celebrity Cafe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''I Have Chosen to Stay and Fight''===
In 2005, Cho released her second book, ''I Have Chosen to Stay and Fight'', a compilation of essays and prose about [[global politics]], human rights, and other topical issues. Cho launched a national book tour in support of the collection. An audio reading of the book was also released. A DVD of a live taping of the ''Assassin'' tour was released in conjunction with the book.

==Film career==
In late 2004, Cho began work on her first self-written film in which she starred. ''[[Bam Bam and Celeste]]'', a low-budget comedy about a &quot;[[fag hag]]&quot; and her gay best friend, co-starred Cho's friend and co-touring act Bruce Daniels. The film premiered at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in 2005. On Valentine's Day of 2004, Cho spoke at the [[Same-sex marriage|Marriage Equality]] Rally at the [[Sacramento, California|California State Capitol]]. Her speech can be seen in the documentary ''Freedom to Marry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freedomtomarry.tv |title=Freedom to Marry |publisher=Turtle Time Productions |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whygaymarriage.com/singleimage.php/20 |title=Margaret Cho Speaks |publisher=Whygaymarriage.com |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shows and tours==
Cho appeared in an episode of the [[Home Box Office|HBO]] comedy ''[[Sex and the City]]'''s fourth season. The episode, titled &quot;[[The Real Me (SATC episode)|The Real Me]]&quot;, first aired on June 3, 2001, and also guest-starred supermodel [[Heidi Klum]].

In 2002, the show ''Notorious C.H.O.'' (the title derived from slain rapper [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]) dealt with the comedian having been raised in 1970s San Francisco and her [[bisexuality]].

In 2003, Cho made another stand-up film, ''Revolution'', which was released in 2004.
[[Image:MargaretChoSanFrancisco.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Cho doing stand-up in June 2005]]

In 2005, Cho started promoting and touring with her new show, ''Assassin''. The show became her fourth live concert film and premiered on the gay and lesbian premium cable network [[Here!]] TV in September 2005. In this DVD, she notably includes herself when talking about gays, saying &quot;we&quot; and &quot;our community&quot;. Posters for ''Assassin'' featured Cho in paratrooper gear and holding a microphone in the style of an automatic rifle, a reference to the infamous 1974 photo of heiress [[Patty Hearst]].

Cho launched &quot;The Sensuous Woman&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.margaretcho.com/sensuouswoman/index.html | title=The Sensuous Woman | publisher=Margaret Cho official site | accessdate=2007-10-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071004212803/http://www.margaretcho.com/sensuouswoman/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[American burlesque|burlesque]]-style variety show tour in Los Angeles on August 10, 2007, with tour dates scheduled through November 3, as of October 10.&lt;ref name=&quot;sensuous_woman_tour&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://margaretcho.com/tour/tour.htm | title=The Sensuous Woman Tour Dates | publisher=Margaret Cho official site | accessdate=2007-10-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070903151957/http://www.margaretcho.com/tour/tour.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Past and scheduled tour stops after Los Angeles are Chicago, Illinois and New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;sensuous_woman_tour&quot;/&gt;  On August 10, 2007 the [[San Francisco Chronicle]] reviewed the show, Cho's work, key events in her personal life and characterized the show as, &quot;In fact, as bawdy and bad-behaving as the cast gets, the whole show feels more like a crazy family reunion than a performance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2007/10/10/apop.DTL | title=ASIAN POP / New tricks | first=Jeff | last=Yang | date=October 10, 2007 | publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | accessdate=2007-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The premiere performance of Cho's &quot;Beautiful&quot; tour was on February 28, 2008, in Sydney, Australia as part of the [[Sydney Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras|Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Festival]]. Cho was also the [[Grand Marshal|Chief of Parade]] for the festival's annual parade along [[Oxford Street, Sydney|Oxford Street]] on March 1. During her stay in Sydney, Cho was filmed shopping for parade outfits in a [[drag queen|drag]] store with [[Kathy Griffin]] and [[Cyndi Lauper]] for Griffin's [[reality television|reality series]] ''[[Kathy Griffin: My Life on the D-List]]''. The episode featuring Cho aired on June 26, 2008.

==Music==
In September 2008, Cho released her single, &quot;I Cho Am a Woman&quot;, on [[iTunes]]. The song, produced by [[Desmond Child]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://perezhilton.com/2008-09-17-margaret-cho |title=Comedian Margaret Cho has released a single on iTunes. |work=PerezHilton.com |accessdate=September 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; was featured on her VH1 series.

Throughout 2010, she worked on a full length album, going through the titles &quot;Guitarded&quot; and &quot;Banjovi&quot; before finally settling on ''[[Cho Dependent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/Cho-Dependent-Margaret/dp/B003VQO50G |title=Cho Dependent |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was released on August 24, 2010. It was supported by music videos for &quot;I'm Sorry&quot;, &quot;Eat Shit and Die&quot;, and &quot;My Lil' Wayne&quot;; [[Liam Kyle Sullivan]] directed the first two. The album was nominated for a 2010 Grammy award for Best Comedy Album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/NOMINEES |title=Nominees And Winners |publisher=GRAMMY.com |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Cho directed and appeared in the music video for &quot;I Wanna Be a Bear,&quot; a song by &quot;Pixie Herculon&quot; (a pseudonym of [[Jill Sobule]]).

== Nature of material and political advocacy ==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=July 2008}}

[[Image:MargaretChoBurlesque.jpg|right|thumb|Cho performing [[American burlesque|burlesque]] at the 2006 [[Miss Exotic World Pageant]].]]

Cho is also well known for discussing her relationship with her mother, particularly in imitating her mother's heavily accented speech. Her depictions of &quot;Mommy&quot; have become a popular part of her routine. Cho's comedy routines are often explicit. She has covered substance abuse, [[eating disorder]]s, her bisexuality and obsession with gay men, and Asian-American stereotypes, among other subjects, in her stand up.

A substantial segment of her material and advocacy addresses LGBT issues. In addition to her shows, Cho also developed an additional outlet for her advocacy with the advent of [http://margaretcho.com Margaretcho.com] and her daily [[weblog]]. When San Francisco mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] directed that San Francisco's city hall issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples in San Francisco in 2004 (until reversed by the state supreme court), Cho started ''Love is Love is Love'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loveisloveislove.com |title=Love is Love is Love |publisher=Love is Love is Love |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a website promoting the legalization of [[gay marriage]] in the United States.

Cho's material often features commentary on politics and contemporary American culture. She has also been outspoken about her dislike of former President [[George W. Bush]]. She began to draw intense fire from [[Conservatism|conservatives]] over her fiercely anti-Bush commentary; a live performance in [[Houston]], Texas was threatened with picketing. Although protesters never showed up, she held a counter protest outside the club until security told her she had to go inside.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.margaretcho.com/blog/2004/02/06/protest-this.html ''Protest This'' an entry in Margaret's blog]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Cho was performing at a corporate event in a hotel when after ten minutes her microphone was cut off and a band was instructed to begin playing. Cho claims this was because the manager of the hotel was offended by anti-Bush administration comments. Cho's payment, which was issued by way of check directly to a non-profit organization, a defense fund for the [[West Memphis Three]], initially bounced but was eventually honored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.margaretcho.com/blog/2004/05/28/they-turned-off-the-mic.html ''They Turned Off the Mic'' an entry in Margaret's blog]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2004, during the [[Democratic National Convention]], Cho was disinvited to speak at a [[Human Rights Campaign]]/[[Stonewall Democrats|National Stonewall Democrats]] fundraiser out of fear that her comments might cause controversy. In November 2005, she campaigned to pardon [[Stanley Williams|Stanley Tookie Williams]], an early [[Crips]] gang leader, for his death sentence for four murders.  On December 13, 2005, after exhausting all forms of appeal, Williams was executed by [[lethal injection]] at [[San Quentin State Prison]], California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.margaretcho.com/blog/2005/10/26/save-tookie.html ''Save Tookie'' an entry in Margaret's blog]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She [[emcee]]d the multi-artist [[True Colors Tour 2007|True Colors Tour]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truecolorstour.com/ |title=Tour Info |publisher=True Colors Tour |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which traveled through 15 cities in the United States and Canada.  The tour, sponsored by the [[Logo (TV channel)|Logo]] channel, began on June 8, 2007.
