'''John Winston Howard''', [[Order of Merit|OM]], [[Companion of the Order of Australia|AC]], [[Star of the Solomon Islands|SSI]], (born 26 July 1939) was the [[List of Prime Ministers of Australia|25th]] [[Prime Minister of Australia]], from 11&amp;nbsp;March 1996 to 3&amp;nbsp;December 2007. He was the second-longest serving Australian Prime Minister after [[Robert Menzies|Sir Robert Menzies]].

Howard was a member of the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] from [[Australian federal election, 1974|1974]] to [[Australian federal election, 2007|2007]], representing the [[Division of Bennelong]], New South Wales. He served as [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]] in the [[Malcolm Fraser|Fraser]] [[Second Fraser Ministry|government]] from 1977 to 1983. He was Leader of the Liberal Party and [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] Opposition from 1985 to 1989, which included the [[Australian federal election, 1987|1987 federal election]] against [[Bob Hawke]]. He was re-elected as Leader of the Opposition in 1995.

Howard led the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]]-[[National Party of Australia|National]] coalition to victory at the [[Australian federal election, 1996|1996 federal election]], defeating [[Keating Government|Paul Keating's Labor government]] and ending a record 13 years of Coalition [[Opposition (Australia)|opposition]]. The [[Howard Government]] was re-elected at the [[Australian federal election, 1998|1998]], [[Australian federal election, 2001|2001]] and [[Australian federal election, 2004|2004]] elections, presiding over a period of strong economic growth and prosperity.&lt;ref name=&quot;quadrant.org.au&quot;&gt;{{Citation|author=John Stone |url=http://www.quadrant.org.au/magazine/issue/2009/1-2/growth-jobs-and-prosperity |title=John Stone, Growth, Jobs, and Prosperity, Quadrant. January–February 2009 |publisher=Quadrant.org.au |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major issues for the Howard Government included taxation, industrial relations, immigration, the Iraq war, and Aboriginal relations. Howard's coalition government was defeated at the 2007 election by the Labor Party led by [[Kevin Rudd]]. Howard also lost his [[Division of Bennelong|own parliamentary seat]] at the election; he was the second Australian Prime Minister, after [[Stanley Bruce]] in 1929, to do so.

==Early life==
[[File:John Howard boy.jpg|left|thumb|upright|John Howard as a boy]]
John Howard is the fourth son of Mona (''née'' Kell) and [[Lyall Howard]]. His parents were married in 1925. His eldest brother Stanley was born in 1926, followed by Walter in 1929, and Robert (Bob) in 1936. Lyall Howard was an admirer of [[Winston Churchill]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Garran|2004|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a sympathiser with the [[New Guard]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Onselen|Errington|2007|pp=7–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard grew up in the Sydney suburb of [[Earlwood, New South Wales|Earlwood]] in a [[Methodist]] family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly bio&quot;&gt;{{Citation| last = Kelly | first = Paul | title = The Common Man as Prime Minister | work = The Australian | date = 19 May 1999 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother had been an office worker until her marriage. His father and his paternal grandfather, Walter Howard, were both veterans of the [[First Australian Imperial Force|First AIF]] in World War I. They also ran two [[Dulwich Hill, New South Wales|Dulwich Hill]] petrol stations where John Howard worked as a boy.&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH_Petrol&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2006/06/18/1150569210879.html?page=fullpage | title=Tin soldered for the King in Howard's home | work=Sydney Morning Herald | date=19 June 2006 | accessdate=29 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Lyall Howard died in 1955 when John was sixteen, leaving his mother to take care of John&lt;ref&gt;Birnbauer, Bill, &quot;Rise Of A Common Man&quot;, ''The Age'', 4 March 1996&lt;/ref&gt; (or &quot;Jack&quot; as he was also known).&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH_Canterbury&quot;&gt;{{Citation| url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2004/09/17/1095394004427.html | title=Canterbury tales | work=Sydney Morning Herald | date=18 September 2004 | accessdate=5 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard suffered a hearing impairment in his youth, leaving him with a slight [[speech disorder|speech impediment]],&lt;ref name=&quot;transcript-lab_opening&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/download/media/pressrel/1ET06/upload_binary/1et061.pdf;fileType%3Dapplication%2Fpdf | title=Transcript of the Prime Minister the Hon. John Howard MP, opening of the child deafness research laboratories at The Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, East Melbourne | publisher=Parlinfo | date=16 February 2000 | accessdate=8 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he continues to wear a hearing aid. It also influenced him in subtle ways, limiting his early academic performance; encouraging a reliance on an excellent memory; and in his mind ruling out becoming a [[barrister]] as a likely career.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Onselen|Errington|2007|pp=21, 35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard attended the [[state school]]s Earlwood Primary School and [[Canterbury Boys' High School]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH_Canterbury&quot;/&gt; Howard won a citizenship prize in his final year at Earlwood (presented by local politician [[Eric Willis]]), and subsequently represented his secondary school at debating as well as [[cricket]] and [[rugby football|rugby]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Sports Factor&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/sportsfactor/stories/2001/401143.htm| title=Beazley and Howard- Politics and Sport | publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation | date=26 October 2001 | accessdate=13 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cricket remained a lifelong hobby.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly bio&quot;/&gt; In his final year at school he took part in a radio show hosted by [[Jack Davey]], ''Give It a Go'' broadcast on the commercial radio station, [[2GB]], and a recording of the show survives.&lt;ref name=&quot;young_howard_recording&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.australianpolitics.com/sounds/2002/06/02-06-09_howard-and-jack-davey-1955.ram | title=Sixteen-year-old John Howard on a popular radio quiz show compered by Jack Davey {{RAMlink}} | publisher=australianpolitics.com | date=9 June 2002 | accessdate=8 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; After gaining his Leaving Certificate, he studied law at the [[University of Sydney]], graduating in 1961,&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH_Canterbury&quot;/&gt; and subsequently practising as a solicitor for twelve years.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMA&quot;/&gt;

Howard married fellow Liberal Party member [[Janette Howard|Janette Parker]] in 1971, with whom he had three children: Melanie (1974), Tim (1977) and Richard (1980).&lt;ref name=&quot;NAA_JanetteHoward&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url=http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/meetpm.asp?pmId=25 | title=Australia's Prime Ministers : John Howard | publisher=[[National Archives of Australia]] | accessdate=27 November 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070830111647/http://primeministers.naa.gov.au/meetpm.asp?pmId=25 |archivedate = 30 August 2007}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
Howard joined the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] in 1957. He held office in the [[New South Wales]] Liberal Party on the State Executive and served as President of the [[Young Liberals (Australia)|Young Liberals]] (1962–64), the party youth organisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;young_libs&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.younglibs.org.au/lifemembers.php | title=Young Liberals Life Members &amp; Past Presidents | publisher=[[Young Liberals (Australia)|Young Liberals]] |year=2006 | accessdate=8 July 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051221230853/http://www.younglibs.org.au/lifemembers.php |archivedate = 21 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard supported [[Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|Australia's involvement]] in the [[Vietnam War]], although has since said there were &quot;aspects of it that could have been handled and explained differently&quot;.&lt;ref name=4corners&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2004/s1212701.htm | title=John Howard Interview– 1996 | work=[[Four Corners (TV program)|Four Corners]] | date=19 February 1996 | accessdate=26 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Australian federal election, 1963|1963 federal election]], Howard acted as campaign manager in his local seat of [[Division of Parkes (1901-69)|Parkes]] for the successful candidacy of [[Tom Hughes (Australian politician)|Tom Hughes]] who defeated the 20 year Labor incumbent.

In 1967 with the support of party power brokers, [[John Carrick (Australian politician)|John Carrick]] and [[Eric Willis]], he was endorsed as candidate for the marginal suburban state seat of [[Electoral district of Drummoyne|Drummoyne]], held by [[Australian Labor Party|ALP]] member [[Reg Coady]]. Howard's mother sold the family home in [[Earlwood, New South Wales|Earlwood]] and rented a house with him at [[Five Dock, New South Wales|Five Dock]], a suburb within the electorate. At the election in February 1968, in which the incumbent state Liberal government was returned to office, Howard narrowly lost to Coady, despite campaigning vigorously.&lt;ref name='Drummoyne_1968'&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/resources/nswelectionsanalysis/1968/Drummoyne.htm | title=Drummoyne– 1968 | publisher=[[Parliament of New South Wales]] | date= 25 July 2007 | accessdate=25 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard and his mother subsequently returned to Earlwood, moving to a house on the same street where he grew up.

At the [[Australian federal election, 1974|1974 federal election]], Howard successfully contested the Sydney suburban seat of [[Division of Bennelong|Bennelong]] and became a Member of Parliament in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] during the [[Gough Whitlam]]-led Labor Government. Howard backed [[Malcolm Fraser]] for the leadership of the Liberal Party against [[Billy Snedden]] following the 1974 election.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1994), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; When Fraser won office in December 1975, Howard was appointed [[Minister for Competition Policy and Consumer Affairs (Australia)|Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs]], a position in which he served until 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMA&quot;/&gt; At this stage, he followed the [[protectionist]] and pro-regulation stance of Fraser and the Liberal Party.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1994), pp. 101–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal Treasurer (1977–1983)==

In December 1977, at the age of 38, Howard was appointed [[Treasurer of Australia|Treasurer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NMA&quot;/&gt; During his five years in the position, he became an adherent of [[market economics|free-market economics]],&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1994), p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; which was challenging economic orthodoxies in place for most of the century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly 1994, pp. 50-53&quot;&gt;Kelly (1994), pp. 50–53.&lt;/ref&gt; He came to favour tax reform including broad-based taxation (later the [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|GST]]), a freer industrial system including the dismantling of the centralised wage-fixing system, the abolition of compulsory [[trade unionism]], privatisation and deregulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly bio&quot;/&gt;

In 1978, the Fraser government instigated the Campbell Committee to investigate financial system reforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell_21&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Bell|2004|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard supported the Campbell report, but adopted an incremental approach with Cabinet, as there was wide opposition to deregulation within the government and the treasury.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bell_21&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kelly|1994|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process of reform began before the committee reported 2½ years later, with the introduction of the tender system for the sale of Treasury notes in 1979, and Treasury bonds in 1982. Ian Macfarlane (Governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, 1996–2006) described these reforms as &quot;second only in importance to the float of the Australian dollar in 1983.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.abc.net.au/rn/boyerlectures/stories/2006/1769925.htm Boyer Lecture 3: Reform and Deregulation]''26 November 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Howard proposed a broad-based indirect tax with compensatory cuts in personal rates; however, cabinet rejected it citing both inflationary and political reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1994), p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; After the free-marketeers or &quot;drys&quot; of the Liberals challenged the protectionist policies of [[Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations (Australia)|Minister for Industry and Commerce]] [[Phillip Lynch]], they shifted their loyalties to Howard. Following an unsuccessful leadership challenge by [[Andrew Peacock]] to unseat Fraser as prime minister, Howard was elected deputy leader of the Liberal Party in April 1982. His election depended largely on the support of the &quot;drys&quot;, and he became the party's champion of the growing free-market lobby.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1994), pp. 49–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

The economic crises of the early 1980s brought Howard into conflict with the economically conservative Fraser. As the economy headed towards the worst recession since the 1930s, [[Keynesian]] Fraser pushed an expansionary fiscal position much to Howard's and Treasury's horror. With his authority as treasurer being flouted, Howard considered resigning in July 1982, but, after discussions with his wife and senior advisor [[John Hewson]], he decided to &quot;tough it out&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kelly 1994, pp. 50-53&quot;/&gt; The 1982 wages explosion—wages rose 16 per cent across the country—resulted in [[stagflation]]; unemployment touched double-digits and inflation peaked at 12.5% (official interest rates peaked at 21%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title =F01 Interest rates and yields&amp;nbsp;– money market | publisher =[[Reserve Bank of Australia]] | url =http://www.rba.gov.au/Statistics/Bulletin/F01hist.xls | format =Excel file | accessdate =29 August 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070729185829/http://www.rba.gov.au/Statistics/Bulletin/F01hist.xls |archivedate = 29 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fraser Government with Howard as Treasurer lost the [[Australian federal election, 1983|1983 election]] to the Labor Party led by [[Bob Hawke]]. Over the course of the 1980s, the Liberal party came to accept the free-market policies that Fraser had resisted and Howard had espoused. Policies included low protection, decentralisation of wage fixation, financial deregulation, a broadly-based indirect tax, and the rejection of counter-cyclical fiscal policy.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1994), p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition years (1983–1996)==
Following the defeat of the Fraser government and Fraser's subsequent resignation from parliament, Howard contested the Liberal leadership but was defeated by [[Andrew Peacock]]. Remaining Deputy Leader of the parliamentary party, Howard became Deputy Leader of the [[Opposition (Australia)|Opposition]] and the Liberal Party were defeated by [[Bob Hawke|Hawke's]] Labor Government at the [[Australian federal election, 1984|1984 election]]. In 1985, as Labor's position in opinion polls improved, Peacock's popularity sank, and Howard's profile rose, leadership speculation persisted. Peacock said he would no longer accept Howard as deputy unless he offered assurances that he would not challenge for the leadership. Following Howard's refusal to offer such an assurance, Peacock sought, in September 1985, to replace him with John Moore as Deputy Leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Barclay |first= Glen |year= 1986 |month= August |title= Australian Political Chronicle: July–December 1985 |journal= Australian Journal of Politics and History |volume= 32 |issue= 2 |page= 264 |issn=0004-9522}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party room re-elected Howard as Deputy on 5 September (38 votes to 31), and, believing his position untenable, Peacock resigned the leadership. With Peacock not contesting the Liberal Party leadership ballot, Howard defeated [[Jim Carlton]] 57 votes to 6&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=by George |url=http://poliquant.com/major-party-leadership-ballots-since-1966/ |title=poliquant.com |publisher=poliquant.com |date= |accessdate=17 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to become Leader of the party and the Opposition.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1994), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

;Leader of the opposition and new economic policy
Howard was in effect the Liberal party's first pro-market leader in the conservative coalition and spent the next two years working to revise Liberal policy away from that of Fraser's.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |year= 1987 |month= December |title= Australian Political Chronicle: January–June 1987 |journal= Australian Journal of Politics and History |volume= 33 |issue= 3 |pages= 280–281 |issn=0004-9522}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his own words he was an &quot;economic radical&quot; and a [[social conservatism|social conservative]].&lt;ref name=&quot;markus85&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Markus|2001|pp=85–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to the pro-market liberalism of the 1980s, Howard said in July 1986 that &quot;The times will suit me&quot;.&lt;ref name='SMH20030818_TimesDoSuitHim'&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/08/17/1061059710322.html?from=storyrhs

Hawke called the [[Australian federal election, 1987|1987 election]] six months early. In addition to the Howard–Peacock rivalry, Queensland National Party criticism of the federal Liberal and National leadership led to a split in the Coalition whereby Nationals ran against Liberals,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |doi= 10.1111/j.1467-8497.1987.tb00153.x |year= 1987 |month= December |title= Australian Political Chronicle: January–June 1987 |journal= Australian Journal of Politics and History |volume= 33 |issue= 3 |pages= 279–285 |issn=0004-9522}}&lt;/ref&gt; and culminated in the &quot;[[Joh for Canberra]]&quot; campaign.

;Howard's social agenda
In his social agenda, Howard promoted the traditional family and was antipathetic to the promotion of [[multiculturalism]] at the expense of a shared Australian identity.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1994), pp. 419.&lt;/ref&gt; The immigration policy, ''[[One Australia policy|One Australia]]'', outlined a vision of &quot;one nation and one future&quot; and opposed multiculturalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;markus85&quot;/&gt; Howard publicly suggested that to support &quot;social cohesion&quot; the rate of Asian immigration be &quot;slowed down a little&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Onselen|Errington|2007|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The comments divided opinion within the Coalition, and undermined Howard's standing amongst Liberal party figures including federal and state Ministers, intellectual opinion makers, business leaders, and within the Asia Pacific. Three Liberal MPs [[Crossing the floor|crossed the floor]] and two abstained in response to motion put forward by Prime Minister Hawke to affirm that race or ethnicity would not be used as immigrant selection criteria. Many Liberals later nominated the issue as instrumental in Howard subsequently losing the leadership in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1994), pp. 427–428.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1995 newspaper article (and in 2002 as Prime Minister), Howard recanted his 1988 remarks on curbing Asian immigration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aus_spice&quot;&gt;{{Citation

In line with &quot;One Australia's&quot; rejection of Aboriginal land rights, Howard said the idea of an Aboriginal treaty was ''&quot;repugnant to the ideals of One Australia&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;markus85&quot;/&gt; and commented ''&quot;I don't think it is wrong, racist, immoral or anything, for a country to say 'we will decide what the cultural identity and the cultural destiny of this country will be and nobody else.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;SMH_cricket&quot;&gt;{{Citation | title = When talk of racism is just not cricket |work=The Sydney Morning Herald | date = 16 December 2005 | url = http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2005/12/15/1134500961607.html | accessdate =19 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Loss of the leadership
As the country's economic position worsened in 1989, public opinion moved away from Labor, however there was no firm opinion poll lead for Howard or the Coalition.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly (1994), p. 470.&lt;/ref&gt; In February, Liberal Party president and prominent businessman, [[John Elliott (businessman)|John Elliott]], said confidentially to Andrew Peacock that he would support him in a leadership challenge against Howard,&lt;ref name=&quot;PKelly_EndOfCertainty1994&quot;/&gt; and in May a surprise leadership coup was launched, ousting Howard as Liberal leader. When asked that day whether he could become Liberal leader again, Howard likened it to ''&quot;Lazarus with a triple bypass&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/02/28/1077677011993.html|title=Thoughts of a bypassed Lazarus|work=The Age | location=Melbourne|date=29 February 2004|accessdate=25 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The loss of the Liberal Party leadership to Peacock deeply affected Howard, who admitted he would occasionally drink too much.&lt;ref name=&quot;news_drunk&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,22129486-2,00.html | title=Howard: 'I was drunk at work' | work=[[The Courier-Mail]] | date=25 July 2007 | accessdate=25 July 2007}} {{Dead link|date=August 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Declining Peacock's offer of Shadow Education, Howard went to the backbench and a new period of party disunity ensued. Howard served as Shadow Minister for Industry, Technology and Communications, Shadow Minister Assisting the Leader on the Public Service, Chairman of the Manpower and Labour Market Reform Group, Shadow Minister for Industrial Relations and Manager of Opposition Business in the House.

Following the Coalition's [[Australian federal election, 1990|1990 election]] loss,  Howard had wanted to run again however he did not have enough support Peacock was replaced with former Howard staffer [[John Hewson]] who defeated [[Peter Reith]], Peacock supported Hewson with generational change which took Howard's name out.[[http://books.google.com.au/books?id=EuqFg5dUmgQC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=Howard+run+again+locked+out+March+of+the+patriots&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0p1NefBDF1&amp;sig=_AQ7zoEtGCwO3QcbNhbxh7_YTyE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=DemRUOT_J63MmgXnhICACQ&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Howard%20run%20again%20locked%20out%20March%20of%20the%20patriots&amp;f=false]]. Howard was a supporter of Hewson's economic program, with a [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST) as its centrepiece. After Hewson lost the &quot;unloseable&quot; [[Australian federal election, 1993|1993 election]] to [[Paul Keating]], Howard unsuccessfully challenged Hewson for the leadership. In 1994, he was again passed over for the leadership, which went to [[Alexander Downer]]. 

;Opposition leader again
In January 1995, leaked internal Liberal Party polling showed that with gaffe-prone Downer as leader, the Coalition had slim chance of holding its marginal seats in the next election, let alone of winning government. Media speculation of a leadership spill ended when, on 26 January 1995, Downer resigned as Liberal Leader and Howard was elected unopposed to replace him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward 1995&quot;/&gt; The [[Coalition (Australia)|Coalition]] subsequently opened a large lead over Labor in most opinion polls, and Howard overtook [[Paul Keating]] as preferred Prime Minister. Hoping to avoid a repeat of 1993, Howard revised his earlier statements against [[Medicare (Australia)|Medicare]] and Asian immigration, describing Australia as &quot;a unique intersection between Europe, North America and Asia&quot;.&lt;ref name=4corners/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aus_spice&quot;/&gt; This allowed Howard to focus on the economy and memory of the early 1990s recession, and on the longevity of the Labor government, which in 1996 had been in power for 13 years.

===Election win and first term===
By the time the [[dropping the writ|writs were dropped]] for the [[Australian federal election, 1996|1996 election]], the Coalition had been well ahead of Labor in opinion polls for over a year. The consensus of most opinion polls was that Howard would be the next Prime Minister.

With the support of many traditionally Labor voters—dubbed &quot;[[Aussie battler|Howard battlers]]&quot;—Howard and the Liberal-National Coalition swept to power on the back of a 29-seat swing. This was the second-worst defeat of an incumbent government since Federation. With a 45-seat majority—the second-biggest majority in Australian history (behind only Fraser's 55-seat majority in 1975)--Howard came into office in a strong position. By this time, as he put it, he had &quot;very clear views on where I wanted to take the country&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

Early in the term Howard had championed significant new restrictions on gun ownership following the [[Port Arthur massacre (Australia)|Port Arthur massacre]] in which 35 people had been shot dead.

Howard's initial silence on the views of [[Pauline Hanson]]—a disendorsed Liberal Party candidate and later independent MP—was criticised in the press as an endorsement of her views.&lt;ref name=howardyearschronology&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/howardyears/chronology/assets/chronology.pdf The Howard Years&amp;nbsp;– Chronology]{{dead link|date=January 2012}}, [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]]&lt;/ref&gt; Howard said that she was entitled to express her opinion, that many others would share it, and that to denounce her would &quot;elevate it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanson_Plug&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2002/s458299.htm | title=Pauline Hanson pulls the plug as One Nation president | publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] | date=14 January 2002 | accessdate=29 August 2007}}; {{cite video

Following the [[Wik Peoples v Queensland|Wik Decision]] of the High Court in 1996, John Howard's government moved swiftly to legislate limitations on its possible implications through the so-called [[Native Title Amendment Act 1998|Ten-Point Plan]].
[[File:HowardCohen97.jpg|thumb|right|John Howard and US Secretary of Defense [[William Cohen]] in 1997]]
From 1997, Howard spearheaded the Coalition push to introduce a [[Goods and Services Tax (Australia)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST) at the 1998 election. Before winning the Prime Ministership, Howard said that he considered the Coalition's defeat in 1993 to be a rejection of the GST, and as a result it would &quot;never ever&quot; be part of Coalition policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2006/s1582253.htm |title=A look back at Howard's ten years |publisher=ABC |location=Australia  |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A long held conviction of Howard’s, his tax reform package was credited with &quot;breaking the circuit&quot; of party morale—boosting his confidence and direction, which had appeared to wane early in the Government’s second term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Van Onselen|Errington|2007|pp=272–273}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1998 election was dubbed a &quot;referendum on the GST&quot;, and the tax changes—including the GST—were implemented in the government's second term after amendments to the legislation were negotiated with the [[Australian Democrats]] to ensure its passage through the Senate.

Through much of its first term, opinion polling was disappointing for the government and its members at times feared being a &quot;one-term wonder&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Ward | first=Ian |year= 1998 |title= Australian Political Chronicle: July–December 1997 |journal= Australian Journal of Politics and History |volume= 44 |issue= 2 |page= 233|issn=}}; {{cite video

Also unpopular with voters were large spending cuts aimed at eliminating the budget deficit (and Howard's distinction between &quot;core&quot; and &quot;non-core&quot; election promises when cutting spending commitments), [[Workplace Relations Act 1996|industrial changes]] and the [[1998 Australian Waterfront Dispute|1998 waterfront dispute]], the partial sale of government telecommunications company [[Telstra]], and the Government's commitment to a GST.

Howard called a [[Australian federal election, 1998|snap election for October 1998]], three months sooner than required. The Coalition actually lost the national two-party preferred vote to Labor, suffering a 14-seat swing. However, the uneven nature of the swing allowed Howard to win a second term in government, with a considerably reduced majority (from 45 seats to 12). Howard himself finished just short of a majority on the first count in his own seat, and was only assured of reelection on the ninth count. He ultimately finished with a fairly comfortable 56 percent of the two-party preferred vote.

===Second term===
In 1998, Howard convened a [[Australian Constitutional Convention 1998|Constitutional Convention]] which decided in principle that Australia should [[Republicanism in Australia|become a Republic]]. At the convention Howard confirmed himself as a monarchist, and said that of the Republican options, he preferred the minimalist model. Howard outlined his support for retaining the status quo on the basis that it had provided a long period of stability and whilst he said there was no question that Australia was a fully independent nation, he believed that the &quot;separation of the ceremonial and executive functions of government&quot; and the presence of a neutral &quot;defender of constitutional integrity&quot; was an advantage in government and that no republican model would be as effective in providing such an outcome as the [[Monarchy in Australia|Australian constitutional monarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pandora.nla.gov.au/nph-arch/1999/Z1999-Dec-10/http://www.theage.com.au/republic98/hansard/hans1.html |title=Pandora Archive |publisher=Pandora.nla.gov.au |date=23 August 2006 |accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite opinion polls suggesting Australians favoured a republic, a 1999 referendum rejected the model chosen by the convention.

Although new [[Indonesian President]] [[B.J. Habibie]] had some months earlier agreed to grant special autonomy to [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|Indonesian-occupied]] [[East Timor]], his subsequent snap decision for a referendum on the territory's independence triggered a Howard and Downer orchestrated shift in Australian policy. In September 1999, Howard organised an Australian-led international peace-keeping force to East Timor ([[INTERFET]]), after [[pro-Indonesia militia]] launched a violent &quot;scorched-earth&quot; campaign in retaliation to the referendum's overwhelming vote in favour of independence. The successful mission was widely supported by Australian voters, but the government was criticised{{who|date=November 2010}} for &quot;foreign policy failure&quot; following the violence and collapse of diplomatic relations with Indonesia. By Howard's fourth term, relations with Indonesia had recovered to include counter-terrorism cooperation and Australia's $1bn [[Boxing Day Tsunami]] relief efforts, and were assisted by good relations between Howard and [[Indonesian President]] [[Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=AAP 6 March 2006 |url=http://en.epochtimes.com/news/6-3-6/38988.html |title=The Epoch Times &amp;#124; Indonesia-Australian Relationship Best Ever |publisher=En.epochtimes.com |date=6 March 2006 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.kbri-canberra.org.au/speeches/2005/050301e.htm |title='Indonesia&amp;nbsp;– Australian Relations: East Timor, Bali Bombing, Tsunami and Beyond' by Ambassador Imron Cotan |publisher=Kbri-canberra.org.au |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his prime-ministership, Howard was resolute in his refusal to provide a parliamentary &quot;apology&quot; to [[Indigenous Australians]] as recommended by the 1997 “[[Bringing Them Home]]” Report. Howard argued this was inappropriate, because &quot;Australians of this generation should not be required to accept guilt and blame for past actions and policies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;speech-reconciliation_convention&quot;&gt;{{Citation | url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/special/rsjproject/rsjlibrary/car/arc/speeches/opening/howard.htm | title=Opening Speech of Australian Reconciliation Convention | publisher=Australasian Legal Information Institute | date=26 May 2000 | accessdate=23 August 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060524083706/http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/special/rsjproject/rsjlibrary/car/arc/speeches/opening/howard.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 24 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard did offer this personal apology before the release of the Report: &quot;I feel deep sorrow for those of my fellow Australians who suffered injustices under the practices of past generations towards indigenous people.

In 1999 Howard negotiated a &quot;[[Motion of Reconciliation]]&quot; with Aboriginal Senator [[Aden Ridgeway]].

Howard responded to the [[2002 Bali bombing]], in which 88 Australian citizens were killed, by calling on Australians to &quot;wrap their arms around the people of Indonesia&quot; and said that, while affected, Australia remained &quot;strong and free and open and tolerant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/tvnz_smartphone_story_skin/139900 |title=John Howard's Bali memorial speech&amp;nbsp;– TVNZ Smartphone |publisher=tvnz.co.nz |date=18 October 2002 |accessdate=25 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Howard re-dedicated his government to the &quot;[[War on Terror]]&quot;, saying the Bali bombing was proof that no country was &quot;immune&quot; to the effects of terrorism.

In 2006, with the government now controlling both houses of parliament for the first time since the Fraser era, industrial relations changes were enacted. Named “[[WorkChoices]]” and championed by Howard, they were intended to fundamentally change the employer-employee relationship.

Leading up to the [[Australian federal election, 2007|24 November election]], the Coalition trailed Labor in the polls since the Labor party elected [[Kevin Rudd]] as party leader in late 2006. In the election, Howard and his government were defeated, suffering a 23-seat swing to Labor, which was almost as large as the 29-seat swing that propelled him to power in 1996. Howard lost his seat of Bennelong to former journalist [[Maxine McKew]] by 44,685 votes (51.4 percent) to Howard's 42,251 (48.6 percent).&lt;ref name='ABC2007ElectionBennelong'&gt;{{Citation
