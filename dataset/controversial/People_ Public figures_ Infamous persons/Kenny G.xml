}}'''Kenneth Bruce Gorelick''' (born June 5, 1956), better known by his stage name '''Kenny G''', is an American [[adult contemporary]] and [[smooth jazz]] [[saxophonist]].

== Early life ==
Kenny G was born in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] to Jewish parents (his mother was originally from [[Saskatchewan]], [[Canada]]) and grew up in the city's [[Seward Park, Seattle|Seward Park]] neighborhood, which is a center of the city's Jewish community. He came into contact with a saxophone when he heard someone performing with one on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;b&amp;n&quot; /&gt; He started playing the saxophone in 1966 when he was 10 years old. He learned how to play under the direction of local trumpeter [[Gerald Pfister]] and by practicing along with [[Gramophone record|record]]s (mostly of [[Grover Washington, Jr.]]), trying to emulate the sounds that he was hearing. His first saxophone was a [[Buffet Crampon]] alto.&lt;ref name='KennyGBlog2009'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kennyg.com/blog/ |title=Some more Q &amp; A |accessdate=April 1, 2010 |author=Kenny G |date=June 19, 2009 |work=Kenny G Rhythm and Romance }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenny G attended Whitworth Elementary School, [[Sharples Junior High School]], [[Franklin High School (Seattle, Washington)|Franklin High School]], and the [[University of Washington]], all in his home town of Seattle. When he entered high school, he failed on his first try to get into the jazz band, but tried again the following year and earned first chair.&lt;ref name='Diaz2006'&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.golfdigest.com/golf-tours-news/2006-12/kennyg|title= After selling millions of records, Grammy winner Kenny G wants to conquer golf|accessdate=April 7, 2007 |last= Diaz|first= Jaime|month= December |year= 2006|publisher=GolfDigest.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;scripps&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first= Ron|last= Kroichick|title= Kenny G can swing with the best of them|url=http://www.scrippsnews.com/node/19279 |work=Scripps News|publisher=ScrippsNews.com|date= February 7, 2007|accessdate=April 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his studies while in high school, he took private lessons on the saxophone and clarinet from Johnny Jessen, once a week for a year.&lt;ref name='Wissmuller2006'&gt;{{cite journal|title=I'm just doing my own thing, too|journal=Jazzed|year=2006|first=Christian|last=Wissmuller|issue=December/January|id= |url=http://www.jazzedmagazine.com/ME2/dirmod.asp?sid=DB82F62537074828BBCEEDE627080729&amp;nm=Archives&amp;type=Publishing&amp;mod=Publications%3A%3AArticle&amp;mid=8F3A7027421841978F18BE895F87F791&amp;tier=4&amp;id=DC361A86F0E94F41ACBF6EC31A485461|accessdate=April 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was also on his high school golf team.&lt;ref name=&quot;scripps&quot; /&gt; He had loved the sport ever since his older [[sibling|brother]], Brian Gorelick, introduced it to him when he was ten years old, which is the same age he was when he started playing the saxophone.&lt;ref name=&quot;scripps&quot; /&gt;

== Career ==
Kenny G's career started with a job as a sideman for [[Barry White]]'s [[Love Unlimited Orchestra]] in 1973 while 17 and still in high school.&lt;ref name='Encyclopedia.com'&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Glenn |first=Alan |editor= |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia.com |title=Kenny G |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Kenny_G.aspx |accessdate=April 1, 2010 |edition= |year=1995 |publisher=HighBeam Research, Inc |id= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5924/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title= Kenny G Biography|accessdate=April 7, 2007 |last= Yanow|first= Scott|publisher=AllMusic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued to play professionally while studying for a [[academic major|major]] in accounting at the [[University of Washington]] in Seattle and graduated [[magna cum laude]].&lt;ref name='Encyclopedia.com'/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bmi&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bmi.com/musicworld/entry/233313|title= Kenny G Has Time on his Side|accessdate=April 7, 2007 |last= Zimmerman|first= Kevin|date= September 30, 2002|publisher=BMI.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He played with the [[funk]] band Cold, Bold &amp; Together&lt;ref name=&quot;bmi&quot; /&gt; before becoming a credited member of The [[Jeff Lorber]] Fusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot; /&gt; He began his solo career after his period with Lorber.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot; /&gt;

Kenny G signed with [[Arista Records]] as a solo artist in 1982, after [[record label|label]] president [[Clive Davis]] heard his rendition of ABBA's &quot;Dancing Queen&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot; /&gt; He has released many [[solo album]]s and collaborated with various artists including [[Andrea Bocelli]], [[Whitney Houston]],&lt;ref name=&quot;encarta&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | last = Sandow| first = Greg| authorlink= Greg Sandow| year = 2007| title = Kenny G| url= http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761584562/Kenny_G.html| accessdate =May 4, 2007| encyclopedia = Microsoft Encarta| publisher=[[Microsoft Corporation]]|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwsEhS4b|archivedate=October 31, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peabo Bryson]], [[Aaron Neville]], [[Toni Braxton]], [[DJ Jazzy Jeff &amp; The Fresh Prince]],&lt;ref name=&quot;all16&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r240956/credits|pure_url=yes}}|title= The Moment – Credits|accessdate=May 7, 2007 |publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natalie Cole]],&lt;ref name=&quot;all17&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r4311/credits|pure_url=yes}}|title= Everlasting – Credits|accessdate=May 7, 2007 |publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steve Miller (musician)|Steve Miller]]&lt;ref name=&quot;all15&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r13073/credits|pure_url=yes}}|title= Living in the 20th Century – Credits|accessdate=May 7, 2007 |publisher=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which marked the only time he appeared on a [[rock and roll]] album), [[Dudley Moore]], [[Lee Ritenour]], [[The Rippingtons]], [[Michael Bolton]], [[Celine Dion]], [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Smokey Robinson]], [[Bebel Gilberto]], [[George Benson]], [[Chante Moore]] and [[Aretha Franklin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;encarta&quot; /&gt; Influenced by the likes of saxophonist [[Grover Washington, Jr.]],&lt;ref name='Wissmuller2006'/&gt; his own albums are usually classified as [[smooth jazz]].

He received success quite early on, with both ''[[G Force]]'' and ''[[Gravity (Kenny G album)|Gravity]]'', his second and third studio albums respectively, achieving [[music recording sales certification|platinum status]] in the United States. These sales were topped by his fourth studio album, ''[[Duotones]]'', which sold over 5 million copies in the U.S. alone. His sixth studio album, ''[[Breathless (Kenny G album)|Breathless]]'', became the number one best selling instrumental album ever, with over 15 million copies sold, of which 12&amp;nbsp;million were in the U.S. He broke another record when his first holiday album, ''[[Miracles: The Holiday Album|Miracles]]'', sold over 13 million copies, making it the most successful Christmas album to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;bmi&quot; /&gt;

In 1997, Kenny G earned a place in the ''[[Guinness Book of World Records]]'' for playing the longest note ever recorded on a saxophone. Using [[circular breathing]], Kenny G held an E-flat for 45 minutes and 47 seconds at J&amp;R Music World in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |title=Kenny G.

Kenny G's 1999 single, &quot;[[What A Wonderful World]]&quot; was criticized in its overdubbing of [[Louis Armstrong]]'s classic recording. The primary criticism is that a revered recording by an artist such as Armstrong, known especially for improvisation, should not be altered, especially by a musician whose range and depth of understanding of classical jazz was already in question.&lt;ref name=&quot;ratliffe&quot;&gt;Ben Ratliff [http://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/16/arts/music-jazz-can-take-itself-too-seriously.html MUSIC; Jazz Can Take Itself Too Seriously] ''[[New York Times]]'', July 16, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Sabbatini [http://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=15999 Kenny G: At Last...The Duets Album] ''[[All About Jazz]]'', December 30, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Varga [http://jazztimes.com/articles/20699-kenny-g-changes-his-tune Kenny G: Changes His Tune] ''[[JazzTimes]]'' May 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mike Joyce [http://jazztimes.com/articles/24803-who-s-overrated-who-s-underrated Who's overrated? Who's Underrated?] ''[[JazzTimes]]'', September 1997&lt;/ref&gt;  Some columnists counter the criticism by suggesting that Kenny G's recording would expose a wider audience to classic jazz, though the overall response to his recording tended to be extremely negative.&lt;ref name='Maldonado2000'&gt;{{cite news | first=Shirley | last=Maldonado | title=Gee whiz, give Kenny a break | date=August 10, 2000 | publisher=Boston Herald and Herald Media | url =http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/57812085.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Aug+10%2C+2000&amp;author=Shirley+Maldonado&amp;pub=Boston+Herald&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=049&amp;desc=Gee+whiz%2C+give+Kenny+a+break | work=Boston Herald | accessdate =April 7, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenny G has recorded some Chinese songs, such as &quot;[[Mo Li Hua|Jasmine Flower]]&quot; (茉莉花) or &quot;[[The Moon Represents My Heart]]&quot; (月亮代表我的心). His music is noticeably popular in China. His recording &quot;Going Home&quot; is often played at closing time at public places or at the end of classes at schools. Mass transit systems in [[Tianjin]] and Shanghai play these songs when trains approach terminus stations.

As of 2003, Kenny G was named the 25th-highest selling artist in America by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], with 48 million albums sold in the USA as of July 31, 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;riaa&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.riaa.com/gp/bestsellers/topartists.asp|title= Top Artists|accessdate=April 7, 2007 |date= July 31, 2006|publisher=RIAA.com |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070304033156/http://www.riaa.com/gp/bestsellers/topartists.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = March 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1994, Kenny G won the [[Grammy Award for Best Instrumental Composition]] for ''Forever in Love''.

In October 2009, Kenny G appeared with the band [[Weezer]] in an [[AOL]] promotion of their album ''[[Raditude]]'' by soloing during &quot;I'm Your Daddy&quot;. Kenny G said he knew nothing of Weezer before the performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;spinner&quot;&gt;Charley Rogulewski [http://www.spinner.com/2009/10/23/weezer-run-with-chamillionaire-sara-bareilles-and-kenny-g/ Weezer Run With Chamillionaire, Sara Bareilles and ...

In February 2011 Kenny G and his music were featured in a [[Super Bowl XLV]] ad for Audi called &quot;Release the Hounds.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Release the Hounds&quot;&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3snyXTNmFm8 Audi Big Game Commercial 2011 – Release the Hounds] ''youtube.com'', February 2, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Kenny G later starred in a short film detailing his time as Head of Riot Suppression for the Luxury Prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kenny G Riot Suppressor&quot;&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXE6L2gUDKQ Audi Big Game 2011 Teaser – Kenny G Riot Suppressor (Part 2)] ''youtube.com'', February 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, he made an appearance in the music video for pop star Katy Perry's single [[Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)]] as Uncle Kenny.  On the October 8, 2011 episode of [[Saturday Night Live (season 37)|Saturday Night Live]], Kenny appeared with his soprano sax along side [[alternative rock]] band [[Foster the People]] as they performed their song &quot;Houdini.&quot;
