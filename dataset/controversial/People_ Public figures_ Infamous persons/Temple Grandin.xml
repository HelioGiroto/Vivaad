'''Temple Grandin''' (born August 29, 1947) is an American [[Doctor (title)|doctor]] of [[animal science]] and [[professor]] at [[Colorado State University]], bestselling author, and consultant to the [[livestock]] industry on animal behavior.
The subject of an award-winning biographical film, ''[[Temple Grandin (film)|Temple Grandin]]'', in 2010, she was listed in the ''[[Time 100]]'' list of the 100 most influential people in the world in the &quot;Heroes&quot; category.&lt;ref name=&quot;hauser&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1984685_1984949_1985222,00.html| title=The 2010 TIME 100. In our annual TIME 100 issue, we name the people who most affect our world: Temple Grandin
| author=Marc Hauser | date=April 29, 2010| publisher=TIME |accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Grandin was born in Boston, Massachusetts, to Richard Grandin and Eustacia Cutler. She was diagnosed with [[autism]] at the age of 4 in 1951. Diagnosed and labeled with [[brain damage]], at that early age she was placed in a structured [[nursery school]] with what she considers to have been good teachers. Grandin's mother spoke to a doctor who suggested [[speech therapy]], and she hired a nanny who spent hours playing turn-based games with Grandin and her sister.{{cn|date=May 2012}}

At age four, Grandin began talking (developmental guidelines anticipate a vocabulary of eight-to-ten words by eighteen months of age&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Language development: Speech milestones for babies|url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/infant-development/AN01026|accessdate=5 October 2012|authors=Mayo Clinic staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;). She considers herself lucky to have had supportive mentors from [[primary education|primary school]] onwards. However, Grandin has said that [[middle school|middle]] and [[high school]] were the worst parts of her life. She was the &quot;nerdy kid&quot; whom everyone teased. At times, while she walked down the street, people would taunt her by saying &quot;tape recorder,&quot; because she would repeat things over and over again. Grandin states that &quot;I could laugh about it now, but back then it really hurt.&quot;{{cn|date=May 2012}}

After graduating from [[Hampshire Country School]], a boarding school for gifted children in [[Rindge, New Hampshire]] in 1966, Grandin went on to earn her bachelor's degree in [[psychology]] from [[Franklin Pierce College]] in 1970, a master's degree in [[animal science]] from [[Arizona State University]] in 1975, and a doctoral degree in animal science from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]] in 1989.

Grandin received an honorary doctorate degree from the Ontario Veterinary College, University of Guelph in Guelph, Ontario, Canada at the 2012 Winter Convocation, where she was the keynote speaker. On May 16, 2010, Grandin also received an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from Duke University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dukenews.duke.edu/2010/02/honorary_degrees.html |title=Duke Names Honorary Degree Recipients &amp;#124; Duke Today |publisher=Dukenews.duke.edu |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career celebrity, advocacy==
[[File:CurvedRaceCattleCorral.jpg|thumb|left|Grandin's interest in animal welfare began with designs for sweeping curved corrals, intended to reduce stress in animals being led to slaughter.]]
Grandin is a philosophical leader of both the [[animal welfare]] and [[autism rights movement|autism advocacy]] movements.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.apbspeakers.com/speaker/temple-grandin&lt;/ref&gt; Both movements commonly cite her work regarding animal welfare, [[neurology]], and philosophy. She knows the anxiety of feeling threatened by everything in her surroundings, and of being dismissed and feared, which motivates her work in humane livestock handling processes.  Her business website promotes improvement of standards in [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]] plants and livestock farms. In 2004 she won a &quot;Proggy&quot; award, in the &quot;visionary&quot; category, from [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peta.org/feat/proggy/2004/winners.html#visionary |title=2004 PETA Proggy Awards |publisher=[[PETA]] |date=2004-09-30 |accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of her notable essays about animal welfare is “Animals are not Things”,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Animals are not things|url=http://www.grandin.com/welfare/animals.are.not.things.html|accessdate=2009-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which she posits that animals are technically property in our society, but the law ultimately gives them ethical protections or rights.  She compares the properties and rights of owning cows versus owning screwdrivers, enumerating how both can be utilized to serve human purposes in many ways but, when it comes to inflicting pain, there is a vital distinction between such 'properties':  a person can legally smash or grind up a screwdriver but cannot legally [[torture]] an animal.

Grandin became well known after being described by [[Oliver Sacks]] in the title narrative of his book ''[[An Anthropologist on Mars]]'' (1995); the title is derived from Grandin's description of how she feels around [[neurotypical]] people.  She first spoke in public about autism in the mid-1980s at the request of [[Ruth C. Sullivan]], one of the founders of the [[Autism Society of America]]. Sullivan writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''I first met Temple in the mid-1980s ...[at the] annual [ASA] conference.... Standing on the periphery of the group was a tall young woman who was obviously interested in the discussions. She seemed shy and pleasant, but mostly she just listened.... I learned her name was Temple Grandin... It wasn't until later in the week that I realized she was someone with autism....I approached her and asked if she'd be willing to speak at the next year's [ASA] conference. She agreed...The next year... Temple first addressed an [ASA] audience.... people were standing at least three deep....The audience couldn't get enough of her. Here, for the first time, was someone who could tell us from her own experience what it was like to be extremely sound sensitive (&quot;like being tied to the rail and the train's coming&quot;)... She was asked many questions: &quot;Why does my son do so much spinning?&quot; &quot;Why does he hold his hands to his ears? &quot;Why doesn't he look at me?&quot; She spoke from her own experience, and her insight was impressive. There were tears in more than one set of eyes that day.... Temple quickly became a much sought-after speaker in the autism community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=adPodg5MNU0C&amp;pg=PR13&amp;lpg=PR13&amp;dq=temple+grandin+ruth+sullivan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=F5HS-I2urT&amp;sig=HOQd0c3EAwTYNyp7JKzpMaX0PLs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=3zxuS4vmMo-uswOq85yxDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CAoQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=temple%20grandin%20ruth%20sullivan&amp;f=false |title=The Way I See It: A Personal Look at ... - Temple Grandin - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

Based on personal experience, Grandin advocates early intervention to address autism, and supportive teachers who can direct fixations of the child with autism in fruitful directions. She has described her [[Sensitivity (human)|hypersensitivity]] to noise and other sensory stimuli. She claims she is a primarily visual thinker&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Grandin T |title=How does visual thinking work in the mind of a person with autism? A personal account |journal=Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci |volume=364 |issue=1522 |pages=1437–42 |year=2009 |pmid=19528028 |doi=10.1098/rstb.2008.0297 |url= |pmc=2677580}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has said that words are her second language. Temple attributes her success as a humane livestock facility designer to her ability to recall detail, which is a characteristic of her visual memory. Grandin compares her memory to full-length movies in her head that can be replayed at will, allowing her to notice small details. She is also able to view her memories using slightly different contexts by changing the positions of the lighting and shadows. Her insight into the minds of cattle has taught her to value the changes in details to which animals are particularly sensitive, and to use her visualization skills to design thoughtful and humane animal-handling equipment. She was named a fellow of the [[American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asabe.org/awards/fellow/asabefellow_2009.html|title= 2009 ASABE Fellows | publisher=American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE)|accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a partial proponent of [[neurodiversity]], Grandin has expressed that she would not support a cure of the entirety of the autistic spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wrong Planet - Aspergers and Autism Community |url=http://www.wrongplanet.net/article295.html |title=Interview with Temple Grandin |publisher=Wrong Planet |date= |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
{{pquote|I think using animals for food is an ethical thing to do, but we've got to do it right. We've got to give those animals a decent life and we've got to give them a painless death. We owe the animal respect.|Temple Grandin}}

[[File:Temple Grandin at TED.jpg|thumb|right|Temple Grandin at [[TED (conference)|TED]] 2010]]

Grandin says, “the part of other people that has emotional relationships is not part of me” and she has neither married nor had children. Beyond her work in animal science and welfare and autism rights, her interests include [[horse riding]], [[science fiction]], movies, and [[biochemistry]]. She describes [[socializing]] with others as “boring” and has no interest in reading or watching entertainment about [[emotion]]al issues or relationships.

She has noted in her autobiographical works that autism affects every aspect of her life. She has to wear comfortable clothes to counteract her [[sensory integration dysfunction]] and has structured her lifestyle to avoid [[sensory overload]]. She regularly takes [[anti-depressant]]s, but no longer uses a squeeze-box ([[hug machine]]) that she invented at the age of 18 as a form of stress relief therapy, stating in February 2010 that: “It broke two years ago, and I never got around to fixing it. I'm into hugging people now.”&lt;ref&gt;Claudia Wallis: [http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1960347,00.html “Temple Grandin on Temple Grandin”]. TIME, February 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
Grandin has been featured on major media programs, such as Lisa Davis's ''It's Your Health'', ABC's ''[[Primetime Live]]'', the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'', and ''[[Larry King Live]]'', the [[NPR]] show, ''[[Fresh Air]] with [[Terry Gross]]'', and written up in [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]], [[People (magazine)|''People'' magazine]], [[Discover (magazine)|''Discover'' magazine]], ''[[Forbes]]'' and ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templegrandin.com/templehome.html |title=Dr. Temple Grandin |publisher=Templegrandin.com |date= |accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2005/may/what-do-animals-think/ |title=What Do Animals Think? |publisher=Discovermagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2012, Grandin was interviewed on Thriving Canine Radio to discuss &quot;A Different Perspective on Animal Behavior.&quot;

She was the subject of the ''[[Horizon (BBC TV series)|Horizon]]'' documentary “The Woman Who Thinks Like a Cow”, first broadcast by the [[BBC]] on June 8, 2006, and ''[[Nick News]]'' in the spring of 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/sn/tvradio/programmes/horizon/index.shtml |title=Science &amp; Nature - Horizon |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also been a subject in the series ''[[First Person (TV show)|First Person]]'' by [[Errol Morris]].

Grandin is the focus of a semi-biographical [[HBO]] film, titled ''[[Temple Grandin (film)|Temple Grandin]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://beefmagazine.com/cowcalfweekly/1031-temple-grandin-hbo-biopic/index.html “Temple Grandin Talks About Her Upcoming HBO Biopic”]. beefmagazine.com, October 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.premiumhollywood.com/2010/02/04/tca-tour-a-chat-with-temple-grandin/| title = A Chat with Temple Grandin| author = Harris, Will| date = April 2, 2010| accessdate = February 13, 2012| publisher = premiumhollywood.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; starring [[Claire Danes]] as Grandin.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1278469|Temple Grandin}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movie was released in 2010, was nominated for 15 Emmys, and received five awards, including Outstanding Made for Television Movie and Best Actress in a Drama.&lt;ref&gt;CBSNews.com, August 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Grandin was on stage as the award was accepted, and spoke briefly to the audience. Coincidentally, the 2010 Emmy Awards happened on Grandin's birthday.  At the 2011 Golden Globes, Claire Danes won a Golden Globe for Best Performance by an Actress in a Mini-Series or Motion Picture Made for Television.

Grandin was featured in ''[[Beautiful Minds (TV miniseries)|Beautiful Minds: A Voyage Into the Brain]]'', a documentary produced in 2006 by colourFIELD tell-a-vision, a German company. She appeared in a 2011 documentary on Sci Channel, &quot;Ingenious Minds&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}  She was named one of 2010's 100 most influential people in the world by ''Time'' magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;hauser&quot;/&gt;
