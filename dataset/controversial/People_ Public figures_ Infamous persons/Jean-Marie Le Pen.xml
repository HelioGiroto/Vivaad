'''Jean-Marie Le Pen''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒɑ̃ ma.ʁi lə.pɛn}}; born 20 June 1928) is a French right-wing and nationalist politician who is founder and former president of the [[National Front (France)|Front National]] (National Front) party. Le Pen has run for the French presidency five times, most notably in [[French presidential election, 2002|2002]], when in a surprise upset he came second, polling more votes in the first round than the main [[left-wing|left]] candidate, [[Lionel Jospin]]. Le Pen lost in the second round to [[Jacques Chirac]]. Le Pen again ran in the [[French presidential election, 2007|2007 French presidential election]] and finished fourth. His 2007 campaign, at the age of 78 years and 9 months, makes him the oldest candidate for presidential office in [[History of France|French history]].

Le Pen focuses on [[Demography in France|immigration to France]], the [[European Union]], traditional culture, law and order and France's high rate of unemployment. He advocates immigration restrictions, the death penalty, raising incentives for [[homemaker]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Le Pen and his feminine side | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2011370.stm | date = 28 May 2002 | publisher = BBC News | accessdate =7 February 2007 | first = Clare | last = Murphy | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[euroscepticism]]. He strongly opposes [[same-sex marriage]], [[euthanasia]], and abortion.

==Personal life and early career==
[[Image:LePenBBR2005.jpg|left|thumb|Jean-Marie Le Pen, September 2005]]

Le Pen was born in [[La Trinité-sur-Mer]], a small seaside village in [[Brittany]], the son of a fisherman but then [[orphan]]ed as an adolescent (''pupille de la nation'', brought up by the state), when his father's boat was blown up by a mine in 1942. He was raised as a Roman Catholic and studied at the [[Jesuit]] high school François Xavier in [[Vannes]], then at the ''[[lycée]]'' of [[Lorient]].

Aged 16, he was turned down (because of his age) by Colonel Henri de La Vaissière (then representative of the [[French Communist Party|Communist Youth]]) when he attempted, in November 1944, to join the [[French Forces of the Interior]] (FFI).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lexpress.fr/info/france/elysee_2007/actu.asp?id=10247 Quand Le Pen voulait rejoindre les FFI], ''[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]]'', 28 March 2007 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then entered the [[University of Paris|faculty of law in Paris]], and started to sell the monarchist ''[[Action française]]'''s newspaper, &quot;Aspects de la France&quot;, in the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/histoire/biographies/IVRepublique/le-pen-jean-marie-20061928.asp |title=Assemblée nationale - Les députés de la IVe République : Jean-Marie LE PEN |publisher=Assemblee-nationale.fr |date= |accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was repeatedly convicted of assault (''coups et blessures'').&lt;ref name = &quot;BioRFI&quot;/&gt; He became president of the ''Association corporative des étudiants en droit'', an association of law students whose main occupation was to engage in street brawls against the &quot;''Cocos''&quot; ([[French Communist Party|communists]]). He was excluded from this organisation in 1951{{Why?|date=November 2009}}.

After receiving his law diploma, he enlisted in the [[Military of France|army]] in the [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]]. He arrived in [[First Indochina War|Indochina]] after the 1954 [[battle of Dien Bien Phu]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRFI&quot;/&gt; which had been lost by France and which prompted prime minister [[Pierre Mendès France]] to put an end to the war at the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]]. Le Pen was then sent to [[Suez Crisis|Suez]] in 1956, but arrived only after the cease-fire.&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRFI&quot;/&gt;

Elected deputy of the French Parliament under the [[Pierre Poujade|Poujadist]] banner, Le Pen voluntarily reengaged himself for two to three months in the French Foreign Legion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=CatusJack |url=http://www.dailymotion.com/relevance/search/Jean-Marie+Le+Pen+et+La+Torture/video/x446or_jeanmarie-le-pen-et-la-torture-13-e_politics |title=Jean-Marie Le Pen et La Torture [1/3&amp;#93; Excellent ! - une vidéo |publisher=Dailymotion |date= |accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then sent to [[Algerian War|Algeria]] (1957) as an [[French secret services|intelligence officer]]. He has been accused of having engaged in [[torture during the Algerian War|torture]], but he denied it, although he admitted knowing of its use.&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRFI&quot;/&gt; After his time in the military, he studied [[political science]] and law at [[Pantheon-Assas University]]. His graduate thesis, submitted in 1971 by him and [[Jean-Loup Vincent]], was titled ''Le courant anarchiste en France depuis 1945'' or &quot;''[[Anarchism in France|The anarchist movement in France since 1945]]''&quot;.
[[Image:Le Pen Paris 2007 05 01 n5.jpg|left|thumb|Le Pen with his wife at a political rally in 2007]]
His marriage (29 June 1960 – 18 March 1987) to [[Pierrette Lalanne]] resulted in three daughters; these daughters have given him nine granddaughters. The break-up of the marriage was somewhat dramatic, with his ex-wife posing nude in the French edition of ''[[Playboy]]'' to ridicule him.&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRFI&quot;/&gt; Marie-Caroline, another of his daughters, would also break with Le Pen, following her husband to join [[Bruno Mégret]], who split from the FN to found ''MNR'', the rival ''[[National Republican Movement|Mouvement National Républicain]]'' (National Republican Movement).&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRFI&quot;/&gt; The youngest of Le Pen's daughters, [[Marine Le Pen]], is leader of the [[National Front (France)|Front National]].

In 1977, Le Pen inherited a fortune from Hubert Lambert, son of the cement industrialist of the same name. Hubert Lambert was a political supporter of Le Pen, as well as being a [[monarchist]].&lt;ref name=BioRFI/&gt; Lambert's [[Will (law)|will]] provided 30 million francs (approximatively 5 million euros) to Le Pen, as well as his castle in [[Montretout]], [[Saint-Cloud]] (the same castle had been owned by [[Madame de Pompadour]] until 1748).&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRFI&quot;&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/francais/actu/articles/081/article_45894.asp Le Pen, son univers impitoyable], ''[[Radio France Internationale]]'', 2006-09-01 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1980s, Le Pen's personal security was assured by KO International Company, a subsidiary of VHP Security, a [[private security|private security firm]], and an alleged front organisation for ''SAC'', the ''[[Service d'Action Civique]]'' (Civic Action Service), a Gaullist organisation. SAC allegedly employed figures with organized crime backgrounds and from the far-right movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFI&quot;&gt;[http://www.rfi.fr/actufr/articles/072/article_40330.asp Le général croate Gotovina arrêté en Espagne], [[Radio France International|RFI]], 8 December 2005 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hum&quot;&gt;[http://www.humanite.fr/journal/2005-12-10/2005-12-10-819689 Le chauffeur de l’homme de la Question], ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 10 December 2005 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 May 1991, Jean-Marie Le Pen married Jeanne-Marie Paschos (&quot;Jany&quot;), of [[Greeks|Greek]] descent. Born in 1933, Paschos was previously married to Belgian businessman Jean Garnier.

Le Pen is (supposedly, even though no actual proof nor confirmation exist) the godfather of the third daughter of [[Dieudonné M'bala M'bala]], a comedian, political activist, and anti-zionist of French-African descent who moved from fighting against the Front National to being very close to most of its senior members and defending their freedom of speech in French media.
Jean-Marie Le Pen is also godfather of [[Alexandre Barbera-Ivanoff]], who painted his portrait in 2006.

==Political career==
[[Image:LePencestpossible.jpg|thumb|left|National advertisement in [[Marseille]], predicting the now unrealised possibility of Jean-Marie Le Pen becoming President in 2007]]
Le Pen started his political career as the head of the student union in [[Toulouse]]. In 1953, a year before the beginning of the [[Algerian War]], he contacted President [[Vincent Auriol]], who approved Le Pen's proposed volunteer disaster relief project after a [[North Sea flood of 1953|flood in the Netherlands]]. Within two days, there were 40 volunteers from his university, a group that would later help victims of an earthquake in Italy. In Paris in 1956, he was elected to the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]] as a member of [[Pierre Poujade]]'s [[Union de Défense Commerçants et Artisans|UDCA]] populist party. Le Pen, 28 years old, was the youngest member of the Assembly.

In 1957, he became the General Secretary of the National Front of Combatants, a veterans' organization, as well as the first French politician to nominate a Muslim candidate, Ahmed Djebbour, an Algerian, elected in 1957 as deputy of Paris. The next year, following his break with Poujade, Le Pen was reelected to the National Assembly as a member of the [[National Centre of Independents and Peasants|Centre National des Indépendants et Paysans]] (CNIP) party, led by [[Antoine Pinay]]. Le Pen claimed that he had lost his left eye when he was savagely beaten during the [[French legislative election, 1958|1958 election]] campaign. Testimonies suggest however that he was only wounded in the right eye and did not lose it. He lost the sight in his left eye years later, due to an illness. (Popular belief that he wears a [[glass eye]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} is untrue.) During the 1950s, Le Pen took a close interest in the [[Algerian war]] (1954–62) and the French defense budget.

Le Pen directed the [[French presidential election, 1965|1965 presidential campaign]] of far-right candidate [[Jean-Louis Tixier-Vignancour]], who obtained 5.19% of the votes. He insisted on the rehabilitation of the [[Collaborationist]]s, declaring that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;''Was General [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] more brave than the Marshall [[Philippe Pétain|Pétain]] in the occupied zone? This isn't sure. It was much easier to [[French Resistance|resist]] in London than to resist in France.''&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRFI&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1962, Le Pen lost his seat at the Assembly. He created the Serp (''Société d’études et de relations publiques'') firm, a company involved in the [[music industry]], which produced both chorals of the [[Confédération Générale du Travail|CGT]] trade-union and songs of the [[Popular Front (France)|Popular Front]] and [[Nazism|Nazi]] marches. The firm was condemned in 1968 for &quot;praise of [[war crime]] and complicity&quot; after the diffusion of songs from the [[nazi Germany|Third Reich]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRFI&quot;/&gt;

===1972–present===
[[Image:Le Pen Paris 2007 05 01.jpg|thumb|right|Jean-Marie Le Pen speaking at the [[National Front (France)|Front National]]'s annual tribute to [[Joan of Arc]] in Paris (1 May 2007)]]
In 1972, Le Pen founded the [[National Front (France)|Front National]] (FN) party, along with former [[Organisation de l'armée secrète|OAS]] member [[Jacques Bompard]], former [[Collaborationist]] [[Roland Gaucher]] and others nostalgics of [[Vichy France]], [[neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] [[paganism|pagans]], [[Traditionalist Catholic]]s, and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRFI&quot;/&gt; Le Pen presented himself for the first time in the [[French presidential election, 1974|1974 presidential election]], obtaining 0.74% of the vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRFI&quot;/&gt; In 1976, his Parisian flat was dynamited (he lived at that time in his castle of Montretout in Saint-Cloud). The crime was never solved.&lt;ref name=&quot;BioRFI&quot;/&gt; Le Pen then failed to obtain the 500 signatures from &quot;grand electors&quot; (''grands électeurs'', mayors, etc.) necessary to present himself in the [[French presidential election, 1981|1981 presidential election]], won by the candidate of the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] (PS), [[François Mitterrand]].

Criticizing immigration and taking advantage of the economic crisis striking France and the world since the [[1973 oil crisis]], Le Pen's party managed to increase its support in the 1980s, starting in the municipal elections of 1983. His popularity has been greatest in the south of France. The FN obtained 10% in the [[European Parliament election, 1984|1984 European elections]]. A total of 34 FN deputies entered the Assembly after the [[French legislative elections, 1986|1986 elections]] (the only legislative elections held under proportional representation), which were won by the right wing, bringing [[Jacques Chirac]] to Matignon in the first [[cohabitation (government)|cohabitation]] government (that is, the combination of a right-wing Prime minister, Chirac, with a socialist President, Mitterrand).

In 1984, Le Pen won a seat in the [[European Parliament]] and has been constantly reelected since then. In 1988 he lost his reelection bid for the [[French National Assembly]] in the [[Bouches-du-Rhône]]'s 8th constituency. He was defeated in the second round by [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist]] Marius Masse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/11/tribun/fiches_id/2110.asp Marius Masse] biography&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 Le Pen's invite to London by Conservative MP's was militantly protested by large numbers coordinated by the Campaign Against Fascism in Europe, CAFE, which led to a surge of anti-fascist groups and activity across Europe. In 1992 and 1998 he was elected to the [[List of regions in France|regional]] council of [[Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur]].

Le Pen ran in the French presidential elections in 1974, 1988, 1995, 2002, and 2007. As noted above, he was not able to run for office in 1981, having failed to gather the necessary 500 signatures of elected officials. In the [[French presidential election, 2002|presidential elections of 2002]], Le Pen obtained 16.86% of the votes in the first round of voting. This was enough to qualify him for the second round, as a result of the poor showing by the PS candidate and incumbent prime minister [[Lionel Jospin]] and the scattering of votes among 15 other candidates. This was a major political event, both nationally and internationally, as it was the first time someone with such far right views had qualified for the second round of the French presidential elections. There was a widespread stirring of national public opinion as virtually the entire French political spectrum from centre-right to centre-left united in fierce opposition to Le Pen's ideas. More than one million people in France took part in street rallies; slogans such as &quot;vote for the crook, not the fascist&quot; were heard in opposition to Le Pen. Le Pen was then defeated by a large margin in the second round, when incumbent president Jacques Chirac obtained 82% of the votes, thus securing the biggest majority in the history of the [[Fifth French Republic|Fifth Republic]].

In the [[French regional elections, 2004|2004 regional elections]], Le Pen intended to run for office in the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur]] region but was prevented from doing so because he did not meet the conditions for being a voter in that region: he neither lived there nor was registered as a taxpayer there. However, he will be the FN's top candidate in the region for the [[French regional elections, 2010|2010 regional elections]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.frontnational.com/?p=1274 |title=FN list of candidates |publisher=Frontnational.com |date=25 August 2008 |accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''See also [[National Front (France)|National Front]] for a summary of Le Pen's manifesto.''

Le Pen remains a polarizing figure in France, and opinions regarding him tend to be quite strong. A 2002 [[IPSOS]] poll showed that while 22% of the electorate have a good or very good opinion of Le Pen, and 13% an unfavorable opinion, 61% have a very unfavorable opinion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipsos.fr/CanalIpsos/poll/7542.asp Ipsos.fr - Political Action Barometer] (French)&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Pen and the National Front are described by much of the media and nearly all commentators as far right. Le Pen himself and the rest of his party disagree with this label; earlier in his political career, Le Pen described his position as &quot;neither [[left wing|left]] nor right, but French&quot; (''ni droite, ni gauche, français''). He later described his position as right-wing and opposed to the &quot;socialo-communists&quot; and other right-wing parties, which he deems are not real right-wing parties. At other times, for example during the 2002 election campaign, he declared himself &quot;socially left-wing, economically right-wing, nationally French&quot; (''socialement à gauche, économiquement à droite, nationalement français''). He further contends that most of the French political and media class are corrupt and out of touch with the real needs of the common people, and conspire to exclude Le Pen and his party from mainstream politics. Le Pen criticizes the other political parties as the &quot;establishment&quot; and lumped all major parties ([[French Communist Party|Communist]], [[French Socialist Party|Socialist]], [[Union for French Democracy]] (UDF) and [[Rally for the Republic]] (RPR)) into the &quot;Gang of Four&quot; (''la bande des quatre'' – an allusion to the [[Gang of Four]] during China's [[Cultural Revolution]]).

The international media often cites Le Pen as a symbol of French [[xenophobia]]. He is also occasionally criticized in French and foreign pop songs.

===Controversial statements===
Le Pen has been accused and convicted several times&lt;ref name=2004fine&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-93051559.html &quot;Le Pen convicted of inciting racial hatred for anti-Muslim remarks&quot;], ''Associated Press'', 2 April 2004. Retrieved 18 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; at home and abroad of [[xenophobia]] and [[anti-Semitism]]. A Paris court found in February 2005 that his verbal criticisms, such as remarks disparaging Muslims in a 2003 ''[[Le Monde]]'' interview, were &quot;inciting racial hatred&quot;,&lt;ref name=2004fine /&gt; and he was fined 10,000 euros and ordered to pay an additional 5,000 euros in damages to the ''[[Ligue des droits de l'homme]]'' (League for Human Rights).

Arguing that his party includes people of various ethnic or religious origins like Jean-Pierre Cohen, Farid Smahi or Huguette Fatna, he has attributed some anti-Semitism in France to the effects of Muslim immigration to Europe and suggested that some part of the Jewish community in France might eventually come to appreciate National Front ideology.{{cn|date=April 2012}}

=== Prosecution concerning historical revisionism ===
Le Pen has made several provocative statements concerning the Holocaust which amount to [[historical revisionism (political)|historical revisionism]] and has been convicted of racism or inciting racial hatred at least six times.&lt;ref name=&quot;2004fine&quot;/&gt; Thus, on 13 September 1987 he said, &quot;I ask myself several questions. I'm not saying the gas chambers didn't exist. I haven't seen them myself. I haven't particularly studied the question. But I believe it's just a detail in the history of World War II.&quot; He was condemned under the [[Gayssot Act]] to pay 1.2 million [[French Franc|francs]] (183,200 euros).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Jean-Marie Le Pen renvoyé devant la justice pour ses propos sur l'Occupation | publisher = [[Le Monde]] | url = http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-794895@51-776560,0.html/ | date = 13 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1997, the [[European Parliament]], of which Le Pen was then a member, removed his [[parliamentary immunity]] so that Le Pen could be tried by a German court for comments he made at a December 1996 press conference before the German [[Republicans (Germany)|Republikaner]] party. Echoing his 1987 remarks in France, Le Pen stated: &quot;If you take a 1,000-page book on World War II, the concentration camps take up only two pages and the gas chambers 10 to 15 lines. This is what one calls a detail.&quot; In June 1999, a [[Munich]] court found this statement to be &quot;minimizing the Holocaust, which caused the deaths of six million Jews,&quot; and convicted and fined Le Pen for his remarks.&lt;ref name=1999fine&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-23235520.html &quot;Le Pen Convicted for Racial Hatred&quot;], ''Associated Press'', 1999-06-02. Retrieved 18 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prosecution, allegations of torture and association with militarists ===
In April 2000, Le Pen was suspended from the [[European Parliament]] following prosecution for the physical assault of Socialist candidate Annette Peulvast-Bergeal during the 1997 general election. This ultimately led to him losing his seat in the European parliament in 2003. The Versailles appeals court banned him from seeking office for one year.&lt;ref name=1998ban&gt;Julian Nundy, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18675114.html &quot;One-year election ban for Le Pen&quot;], ''The Scotsman'', 18 November 1998. Retrieved 18 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 and 2008, Le Pen was fined, in both case 10,000 euros for “incitement to discrimination, hatred and violence towards a group of people”, on account of statements made about Muslims in France. In 2010. the [[European Court of Human Rights]] declared Le Pen's application inadmissible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=867478&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR Admissibility decision in case No. 18788/09]{{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Pen allegedly practiced [[torture]] during the [[Algerian War]] (1954–1962), when he was a lieutenant in the French Army. Although he denied it, he lost a trial when he attacked ''[[Le Monde]]'' newspaper on charges of [[defamation]], following accusations by the newspaper that he had used torture. ''Le Monde'' has produced in May 2003 the [[dagger]] he allegedly used to commit [[war crime]]s as court evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=804499 &quot;L'affaire du poignard du lieutenant Le Pen en Algérie&quot;], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 17 March 2003 {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although war crimes committed during the Algerian War are [[amnesty|amnestied]] in France, this was publicised by the newspapers ''[[Le Canard Enchaîné]]'', ''[[Libération]]'', and ''Le Monde'', and by [[Michel Rocard]] (ex-[[Prime Minister of France|Prime Minister]]) on TV ([[TF1]] 1993). Le Pen sued the papers and Michel Rocard. This affair ended in 2000 when the [[Court of Cassation (France)|Cour de cassation]] (French supreme jurisdiction) concluded that it was legitimate to publish these assertions. However, because of the amnesty and the [[statute of limitations]], there can be no criminal proceedings against Le Pen for the crimes he is alleged to have committed in Algeria. In 1995, Le Pen unsuccessfully sued Jean Dufour, regional counselor of the [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d'Azur]] ([[French Communist Party]]) for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.algeria-watch.org/fr/article/hist/1954-1962/lepen_torture.htm &quot;Le Pen et la torture, l'enquete du &quot;Monde&quot; validée par le tribunal&quot;], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 28 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=758856 &quot;J'ai croisé Le Pen à la villa Sésini&quot; (I bumped into Le Pen in the Sesini Villa)], interview with [[Paul Aussaresses]] (who had argued in favor of the use of torture in Algeria), ''Le Monde'', 4 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=754007 &quot;Un lourd silence&quot;], ''Le Monde'', 5 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanite.fr/journal/2002-05-02/2002-05-02-33187 &quot;Quand Le Pen travaillait 20 heures par jour&quot;] in ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 2 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanite.fr/journal/2002-06-04/2002-06-04-34925 &quot;New Revelations on Le Pen, tortionary&quot;] in ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 4 June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanite.fr/journal/1995-04-04/1995-04-04-722345 &quot;Le Pen attaque un élu du PCF en justice&quot;], in ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 4 April 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanite.fr/journal/1995-07-26/1995-07-26-730510 Jean Dufour: &quot;Le Pen vient d'être débouté&quot;], in ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 26 June 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanite.fr/journal/2003-06-27/2003-06-27-374693 &quot;Torture: Le Pen perd son procès en diffamation contre Le Monde&quot;], in ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 27 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Le Pen has also been criticized for ties to &quot;suspect&quot; individuals, such as:
*[[Roger Holeindre]], a member of the political bureau of the [[Front National (France)|Front National]] and a former member of the ''[[Organisation armée secrète]]'' (OAS), a movement against Algerian independence. However, Holeindre was also a Nazi resister during the Second World War&lt;ref&gt;René Monzat, ''Enquêtes sur la droite extrême'', 1992 [http://books.google.fr/books?id=vPUqAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22Roger+Holeindre%22+r%C3%A9sistant&amp;dq=%22Roger+Holeindre%22+r%C3%A9sistant&amp;pgis=1].&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=September 2007}}
*[[Roland Gaucher]], a cofounder of the National Front in 1972, who was also a former [[National Popular Rally|RNP]] member.

==Comments on the Right==
Some of Le Pen's statements led other right-wing groups, such as the [[Austrian Freedom Party]],&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Crumley in ''[[Time International]]'' magazine, (2002-06-05) writes: &quot;Denunciations of Jean-Marie Le Pen and his xenophobic National Front (FN) as racist, anti-Semitic and hostile to minorities and foreigners aren't exactly new. More novel, however, are such condemnations coming from far-right movements like the [[Austrian Freedom Party]] (FPO), which itself won international opprobrium in 1999 after entering government on a [[Populism|populist]] platform similar to Le Pen's.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; and some National Front supporters, to distance themselves from him. Controversial Dutch anti-Islam lawmaker [[Geert Wilders]], who has often been accused of being far-right, has also criticized Le Pen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11469579 | work=BBC News | title=In quotes: Geert Wilders | date=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruno Mégret]] left the National Front to found his own party (the [[National Republican Movement]], MNR), claiming that Le Pen kept the Front away from the possibility of gaining power. Mégret wanted to emulate [[Gianfranco Fini]]'s success in Italy by making it possible for right-wing parties to ally themselves with the Front, but claimed that Le Pen's attitude and outrageous speech prevented this. Le Pen's daughter [[Marine Le Pen|Marine]] leads an internal movement of the Front that wants to &quot;normalize&quot; the National Front, &quot;de-[[enclave]]&quot; it, have a &quot;culture of government&quot; etc.; however, relations with Le Pen and other supporters of the hard line are complex.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Le Canard Enchaîné]]'', 9 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, Le Pen gained widespread popularity among [[neo-Nazis]] and [[white nationalists]] throughout Europe, North America and South America.

As Le Pen, like many other European nationalists in recent years, has made statements highly critical of American foreign policy and culture{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} for which he has received notice from American conservatives. Right-wing commentator and author [[Ann Coulter]] called him an anti-American adulterer but said his anti-immigration, anti-Muslim message &quot;finally hit a nerve with voters&quot; after years of irrelevance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.jewishworldreview.com/cols/coulter050202.asp | title = French voters tentatively reject dynamiting Notre Dame | author = Coulter, Ann | publisher = [[Jewish World Review]] | date = 2 May 2002 | accessdate =7 February 2007 | authorlink = Ann Coulter }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paleoconservative]] commentator [[Pat Buchanan]] contends that even though Le Pen &quot;made radical and foolish statements,&quot; the EU violated his right to freedom of speech.&lt;ref name = Buchanan&gt;{{cite news | title = True Fascists of the New Europe | url = http://www.theamericancause.org/pattruefascists.htm | author = Buchanan, Pat | publisher = The American Cause | date = 30 April 2002 | accessdate =7 February 2007 | authorlink = Pat Buchanan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buchanan wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As it is often the criminal himself who is first to cry, &quot;Thief!&quot; so it is usually those who scream, &quot;Fascist!&quot; loudest who are the quickest to resort to anti-democratic tactics. Today, the greatest threat to the freedom and independence of the nations of Europe comes not from Le Pen and that 17% of French men and women who voted for him. It comes from an intolerant European Establishment that will accept no rollback of its powers or privileges, nor any reversal of policies it deems &quot;progressive&quot;.&lt;ref name = Buchanan/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==European Reform Treaty==
Le Pen has been a vocal critic of the European Reform Treaty (formally known as the [[Treaty of Lisbon]]) which was signed by EU member states on 13 December 2007, and entered into force on 1 December 2009. In October 2007, Le Pen suggested that he would personally visit the Republic of Ireland to assist the &quot;No&quot; campaign but finally changed his mind, fearing that his presence would be used against the supporters of the NO vote. Ireland finally refused to ratify the treaty. Ireland is the only EU country which had a citizen referendum. All other EU states, including France, ratified the treaty by parliamentary vote, despite a previous citizen referendum where over 55% of French voters rejected the European Reform Treaty (although that vote was on a different draft of the Treaty in the form of the Constitutional Treaty).

After the Irish &quot;No&quot; vote, Le Pen addressed the French President [[Nicolas Sarkozy]], accusing him of furthering the agenda of a &quot;cabal of international finance and free market fanatics.&quot; Ireland has since accepted the treaty in a second Lisbon referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8288181.stm|title=
