'''Ferdinand Emmanuel Edralin Marcos''' (September 11, 1917 – September 28, 1989) was [[President of the Philippines]] from 1965 to 1986. He was a lawyer, member of the [[Philippine House of Representatives]] (1949–1959) and a member of the [[Philippine Senate]] (1959–1965). He was [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]] from 1963–1965.

While in power he implemented wide-ranging programs of infrastructure development and economic reform. However, his administration was marred by massive corruption, political repression, and human rights violations.

In 1983, his government was accused of being involved in the assassination of his primary political opponent, [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] Public outrage over the assassination served as the catalyst for the [[People Power Revolution]] in February 1986 that led to his removal from power and eventual exile in Hawaii. It was later discovered that, during his 20 years in power, he and his wife [[Imelda Marcos]] had moved billions of dollars of [[embezzlement|embezzled]] public funds to accounts and investments in the United States, Switzerland, and other countries.

==Early life==
Ferdinand Edralin Marcos was born September 11, 1917, in the town of [[Sarrat]], [[Ilocos Norte]] to parents [[Mariano Marcos]] and [[Josefa Edralin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Steinberg, David J.|title=The Philippines: a singular and a plural place|publisher=Basic Books|year=2000|isbn=978-0-8133-3755-5|pages=115–116|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=8mf8YUky_mMC&amp;pg=PA115}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was baptized into the [[Philippine Independent Church]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Celoza, Albert F.|title=Ferdinand Marcos and the Philippines: the political economy of authoritarianism|publisher=Greenwood Publishing|year=1997|isbn=978-0-275-94137-6|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Marcos family's oral history, the family name was originally '''Quidit''', and their Ilokano roots have some [[Han Chinese]] and Japanese ancestry.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Marcos said that his forefather was a &quot;15th century Chinese pirate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Union Square&quot;&gt;{{cite book|authors=Mijares, Primitivo|chapter=|title=The Conjugal Dictatorship of Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos|publisher=Union Square|year=1976|isbn=0019171|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1938, Mariano Marcos, his brother Pio, his son Ferdinand, and his brother-in-law Quirino Lizardo were prosecuted for the murder of [[Julio Nalundasan]], one of Marcos' father's political rivals. On September 20, 1935, the day after Nalundasan (for the second time) defeated Mariano Marcos for the [[National Assembly of the Philippines|National Assembly]] seat for Ilocos Norte, Nalundasan was shot and killed in his house in [[Batac]]. According to two witnesses, the four had conspired to assassinate Nalundasan, with Ferdinand Marcos eventually doing the killing. In late January 1939, they were denied bail&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chanrobles.com/cralaw19391.htm Mariano Marcos vs. Roman A. Cruz] Philippines Supreme Court&lt;/ref&gt; and in the fall{{When|date=February 2010|reason=ambiguous. See [[Wikipedia:SEASON]]}} of 1939 they were convicted. Ferdinand and Lizardo received the death penalty for premeditated murder, while Mariano and Pio were found guilty only of contempt of court. The Marcos family took their appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the Philippines]], which on October 22, 1940, overturned the lower court's decision and acquitted them of all charges but contempt.&lt;ref&gt;Justice Jose P. Laurel penned the ponencia (in [http://www.lawphil.net/judjuris/juri1940/oct1940/gr_l-47388_1940.html People vs. Mariano Marcos, et al., 70 Phil. 468]) which was concurred by chief justice Avanceña and justices Imperial, Diaz, and Horilleno.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:VanguardMarcos.jpg|thumb|left|Vanguard Ferdinand Marcos, 1937, leading the U.P. Vanguard Fraternity Homecoming Parade at the U.P. Sunken Garden]]

Marcos attended college at the University of the Philippines, attending the prestigious [[University of the Philippines College of Law|College of Law]]. He excelled in both curricular and extra-curricular activities, he was a valuable member of the university's swimming team, boxing, and wrestling. He was also an accomplished and prolific orator, debater, and writer of the university's newspaper. He also became a member of the [[ROTC]] and later an instructor of the subject. He took the 1939 bar exam and topped it with almost a perfect score despite the fact that he was incarcerated when he was reviewing. In 1939, while incarcerated, Ferdinand Marcos graduated ''[[cum laude]]''. If he had not been put in jail for twenty seven days, he would have graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]''. He was elected to the [[Pi Gamma Mu]] international honor society, and the [[Phi Kappa Phi]] international honor society which, 37 years later gave him its Most Distinguished Member Award.&lt;ref&gt;See page 32, http://www.utoledo.edu/as/pdfs/100years.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He claimed to have led a 9,000-man guerrilla force called ''Ang Maharlika'' in northern [[Luzon]] during the Second World War, although his account of events was later cast into doubt after a U.S. military investigation found that many of his claims were false or inaccurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McCoy, Alfred W.|title=Closer than brothers: manhood at the Philippine Military Academy|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1999|isbn=978-0-300-07765-0|pages=167–170|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=GNFRaSf1dP4C&amp;pg=PA167}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Gifted Child==
In Seagrave's book &quot;The Marcos Dynasty&quot;, he mentioned that Marcos possess a phenomenal memory and exhibit this by &quot;memorizing complicated texts and reciting forward and backward&quot; such as the 1935 Constitution of the Philippines. Also in an interview with Senator Miriam Defensor-Santiago by the Philippine Star in March 25, 2012 she shared her experience as a speech writer to President Marcos: &quot;one time, the Secretary of Justice forgot to tell me that the President had requested him to draft a speech that the President was going to deliver before graduates of the law school. And then, on the day the President was to deliver the speech, he suddenly remembered because Malacañang was asking for the speech, so he said, “This is an emergency. You just have to produce something.“ And I just dictated the speech. He liked long speeches. I think that was 20 or 25 pages. And then, in the evening, I was there, of course. President Marcos recited the speech from memory.&quot;

== Personal life ==
He was married to [[Imelda Marcos|Imelda Romualdez-Marcos]], on May 1, 1954 the couple had three children:
* [[Imee Marcos|Maria Imelda &quot;Imee&quot; Marcos]] (born November 12, 1955) Governor of Ilocos Norte
* [[Ferdinand Marcos, Jr.|Ferdinand &quot;Bongbong&quot; Marcos, Jr.]] (born September 13, 1957) Senator of the Philippines
* [[Irene Marcos-Araneta|Irene Marcos]]

== Congressional career ==

===House of Representatives===
When the Philippines was granted independence on July 4, 1946 by the American government, the Philippine Congress was established. Marcos ran and was twice elected as representative of the 2nd district of Ilocos Norte, 1949–1959. He was named chairman of the House Committee on Commerce and Industry and member of the Defense Committee headed by Ramon Magsaysay. He was chairman, House Neophytes Bloc in which (President) Diosdado Macapagal, (Vice President) Emmanuel Pelaez and (Manila Mayor) Arsenio J. Lacson were members, House Committee on Industry; LP spokesman on economic matters; member, Special Committee on Import and Price Controls and on Reparations; House Committees on Ways and Means, Banks Currency, War Veterans, Civil Service, Corporations and Economic Planning; and the House Electoral Tribunal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferdinand Edralin Marcos&quot;&gt;[http://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/former_senators/ferdinand_marcos.htm Ferdinand Edralin Marcos].

He was Senate minority floor leader, 1960; executive vice president, LP 1954–1961; president, Liberal Party, 1961–1964; [[Senate President of the Philippines|Senate President]], 1959–1965. During his term as Senate President, former Defense Secretary Eulogio B. Balao was also closely working with Marcos. Marcos led a controversial political career both before and after his term as Senate President. He became Senator after he served as member of the House of Representatives for three terms, then later as Minority Floor Leader before gaining the Senate Presidency. He introduced a number of significant bills, many of which found their way into the Republic statute books.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ferdinand Edralin Marcos&quot;/&gt;

=== First term (1965–1969) ===

====Presidential campaign====
Marcos was famous for his anti-Japanese guerrilla activity during World War II—something that set him apart from his political opponents, many of whom had collaborated with the Japanese. Marcos won the presidency in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Abinales, P.N.|title=Making Mindanao: Cotabato and Davao in the formation of the Philippine nation-state|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-971-550-349-5|page=156|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=nwDzRHOc7cwC&amp;pg=PA156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marcos visit Johnson 1966.jpg|thumb|Ferdinand and Imelda Marcos with [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] and Lady Bird on September 12, 1966.]]

In his first State of the Nation Address (SONA), Marcos revealed his plans for economic development and government reform. Marcos wanted the immediate construction of roads, bridges and public works, which included 16,000&amp;nbsp;kilometers of feeder roads, some 30,000 lineal meters of permanent bridges, a generator with an electric power capacity of one million kilowatts (1,000,000&amp;nbsp;kW), and water services to eight regions and 38 localities.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} He also urged the revitalization of the judiciary, the national defense posture and the fight against smuggling, criminality, and graft and corruption in the government.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

To accomplish his goals “President Marcos mobilized the manpower and resources of the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) for action to complement civilian agencies in such activities as infrastructure construction; economic planning and program execution; regional and industrial site planning and development; community development and others.”&lt;ref&gt;Manuel A.

==== Vietnam War ====
To the surprise of many, soon after becoming president, Marcos wanted the Philippines to become involved in the [[Vietnam War]]. He asked Congress to approve sending a combat engineer unit to South Vietnam. When the previous Philippine president, Macapagal, suggested in 1964–1965 to send troops it had been Marcos who had led the opposition against this plan on both legal and moral grounds. Despite opposition against the new plan, the Marcos government gained Congressional approval and Philippine troops were sent from the middle of 1966 as the Philippines Civic Action Group (PHILCAG). PHILCAG reached a strength of some 1,600 troops in 1968 and between 1966 and 1970 over 10,000 Filipino soldiers served in South Vietnam, mainly being involved in civilian infrastructure projects.&lt;ref&gt;Lieutenant General Larsen, Stanley Robert (1985) [http://www.history.army.mil/books/Vietnam/allied/ch03.htm &quot;Chapter III: The Philippines&quot;] in ''Allied Participation

{{cquote|''It is easier perhaps and more comfortable to look back to the solace of a familiar and mediocre past. But the times are too grave and the stakes too high for us to permit the customary concessions to traditional democratic processes.''}}
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt; – Ferdinand Marcos, January 1973&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,903757,00.html | work=Time | title=THE PHILIPPINES: Farewell to Democracy | date=January 29, 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

A [[constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]], which had been called for in 1970 to replace the Commonwealth era [[1935 Constitution of the Philippines|1935 Constitution]], continued the work of framing a new constitution after the declaration of martial law. The new constitution went into effect in early 1973, changing the form of government from presidential to [[parliamentary system|parliamentary]] and allowing Marcos to stay in power beyond 1973.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

After putting in force amendments to the constitution, legislative action, and securing his sweeping powers and with the Batasan under his control, President Marcos lifted martial law on January 17, 1981. However, the suspension of the privilege of the [[writ of habeas corpus]] continued in the autonomous regions of [[Western Mindanao]] and [[Central Mindanao]]. The opposition dubbed the lifting of martial law as a mere &quot;face lifting&quot; as a precondition to the visit of [[Pope John Paul II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In many tongues, pope championed religious freedoms|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/04/03/Worldandnation/In_many_tongues__pope.shtml|work=St. Petersburg Times|accessdate=August 21, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marcos had a vision of a ''Bagong Lipunan'' (New Society) similar to [[Indonesia]]n president [[Suharto]]'s &quot;[[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order administration]]&quot;. He used the years of martial law to implement this vision. According to Marcos' book, &quot;Notes on the New Society,&quot; it was a movement urging the poor and the privileged to work as one for the common goals of society and to achieve the liberation of the Filipino people through self-realization. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Marcos confiscated businesses owned by the [[oligarchy]]. More often than not, they were taken over by Marcos' family members and close personal friends, who used them as fronts to launder proceeds from institutionalized graft and corruption in the different national governmental agencies as &quot;crony capitalism,&quot; Marcos' friends using them for personal benefit. With genuinely nationalistic motives, crony capitalism was intended to redistribute monopolies traditionally owned by Chinese and Mestizo oligarchs to Filipino businessmen though in practice, it led to graft and corruption via bribery, [[racketeering]], and [[embezzlement]]. Marcos also silenced the free press, making the state press the only legal one. He also seized privately owned lands and distributed them to farmers. By waging an ideological war against the oligarchy, Marcos gained the support of the masses though he was to create a new one in its place. Marcos, now free from day-to-day governance which was left mostly to [[Juan Ponce Enrile|Enrile]] using his power to settle scores against old rivals, such as the Lopezes, who were always opposed to the Marcos administration. Leading opponents such as Senators [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]], [[Jose Diokno]], [[Jovito Salonga]] and many others were imprisoned for months or years. This practice considerably alienated the support of the old social and economic elite and the media, who criticized the Marcos administration endlessly.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed treatment of corruption under Marcos, see {{cite book|authors=Chaikin, David &amp; Sharman, Jason Campbell|chapter=The Marcos Kleptocracy|title=Corruption and money laundering: a symbiotic relationship|publisher=Macmillan|year=2009|isbn=978-0-230-61360-7|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=amZkAdGTkl4C&amp;pg=PA153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1972 and 1976, Marcos increased the size of the Philippine military from 65,000 to 270,000 personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Military officers were placed on the [[board of directors|boards]] of a variety of media corporations, public utilities, development projects, and other private corporations. At the same time, Marcos made efforts to foster the growth of a domestic weapons manufacturing industry and heavily increased military spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moran, Jon|title=Patterns of Corruption and Development in East Asia|work=Third World Quarterly|volume=20|issue=3|date=June 1999|page=579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GNP of the country stood at $11.5 billion by 1980, which represented a 6.6% average annual growth rate. The 1980 GNP is four times greater than the GNP in 1972. Rice production increased from 5.1 million metric tons in 1972 to 7.25 million metric tons in 1980 due to Masagana 99.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.ph/1980/07/28/ferdinand-e-marcos-fifteenth-state-of-the-nation-address-july-28-1980/&lt;/ref&gt;

From the declaration of martial law in 1972, until 1983, the U.S. government provided $2.5 billion in bilateral military and economic aid to the Marcos regime, and about $5.5 billion through multilateral institutions such as the [[World Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bello, Walden|title=Edging toward the Quagmire: The United States and the Philippine Crisis|work=World Policy Journal|volume=3|issue=1|date=Winter 1985/1986|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1979 U.S. Senate report, it was stated that U.S. officials were aware, as early as 1973, that Philippine government agents were in the United States to harass Filipino dissidents. In June 1981, two anti-Marcos labor activists were assassinated outside of a union hall in Seattle. On at least one occasion, CIA agents blocked FBI investigations of Philippine agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Shalom, Stephen R.|title=Imperial alibis: rationalizing U.S. intervention after the cold war|publisher=[[South End Press]]|year=1993|isbn=978-0-89608-448-3|page=149|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=f7PfJvj9c7sC&amp;pg=PA149}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marcos regime instituted a mandatory youth organization, known as the [[Kabataang Barangay]], which was led by Marcos' eldest daughter Imee. Presidential Decree 684, enacted in April 1975, required that all youths aged 15 to 18 be shipped off to remote rural indoctrination camps, where they underwent a ritualistic program designed to instill loyalty to the First Couple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=McCoy, Alfred W.|title=An Anarchy of Families: State and Family in the Philippines|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-299-22984-9|page=17|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fawaNZu-yqUC&amp;pg=PA17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wurfel, David|title=Filipino Politics: Development and Decay|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1988|page=130|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R-oK4ZetPIAC&amp;pg=PA130|isbn=978-0-8014-9926-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Defense Minister [[Juan Ponce Enrile]], Chief of Staff of the Philippine Constabulary [[Fidel Ramos]], and Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces of the Philippines [[Fabian Ver]] were the chief administrators of martial law from 1972 to 1981, and the three remained President Marcos' closest advisers until he was ousted in 1986. Enrile and Ramos would later abandon Marcos' 'sinking ship' and seek protection behind the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]]. The Catholic hierarchy and Manila's middle class were crucial to the success of the massive crusade.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

====Prime Minister====
In 1978, the position returned when Ferdinand Marcos became Prime Minister. Based on ''Article 9'' of the 1973 constitution, it had broad executive powers, that would be typical of modern prime ministers in other countries. The position was the official head of government, and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces. All of the previous powers of the President from the 1935 Constitution were transferred to the newly restored office of Prime Minister. The Prime Minister also acted as head of the National Economic Development Authority. Upon his reelection to President, Marcos was succeeded as Prime Minister by [[Cesar Virata]] in 1981.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

=== Third term (1981–1986) ===
{{cquote|''We love your adherence to democratic principles and to the democratic process, and we will not leave you in isolation.''}}
&lt;center&gt;&lt;small&gt; – U.S. Vice-President [[George H. W. Bush]] during Ferdinand Marcos inauguration, June 1981&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,953029,00.html | work=Time | title=Philippines: Together Again | date=July 13, 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

On June 16, 1981, six months after the lifting of martial law, the [[Philippine general election and referendum, 1981|first presidential election in twelve years]] was held. As to be expected, President Marcos ran and won a massive victory over the other candidates. The major opposition parties, the [[United Nationalists Democratic Organizations]] (UNIDO), a coalition of opposition parties and LABAN, boycotted the elections.

==== Aquino's assassination ====
{{Main|Assassination of Benigno Aquino, Jr.}}
In 1983, opposition leader [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] was assassinated by his Philippine military escort at the [[Ninoy Aquino International Airport|Manila International Airport]] upon his return to the Philippines after a long period of exile. The available evidence suggests that Imelda Marcos and General Fabian C. Ver planned the killing, but it is possible that Marcos himself made the actual order to have Aquino killed. This coalesced popular dissatisfaction with Marcos' authoritarian governance and pilfering of public wealth, leading to widespread protests against the regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson-1995-pp114-115&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Thompson, Mark R.|title=The anti-Marcos struggle: personalistic rule and democratic transition in the Philippines|publisher=Yale University Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-300-06243-4|pages=114–115|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PzRJzMPQQJ8C&amp;pg=PA114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Impeachment attempt ====
[[File:MarcosinWashington1983.jpg|thumb|Ferdinard Marcos in 1983.]]
On August 13, 1985, fifty-six Assemblymen signed a resolution calling for the impeachment of President Marcos for alleged diversion of U.S. aid for personal use,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Blitz, Amy|title=The contested state: American foreign policy and regime change in the Philippines|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2000|isbn=978-0-8476-9934-6|pages=167–168|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=n2rdOhMdCDEC&amp;pg=PA167}}&lt;/ref&gt; citing a July 1985 ''[[San Jose Mercury News]]'' exposé of the Marcoses’ multi-million dollar investment and property holdings in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The properties allegedly amassed by the First Family were the Crown Building, Lindenmere Estate, and a number of residential apartments (in New Jersey and New York), a shopping center in New York, mansions (in London, Rome and Honolulu), the Helen Knudsen Estate in Hawaii and three condominiums in San Francisco, California.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The Assemblymen also included in the complaint the misuse and misapplication of funds “for the construction of the Film Center, where X-rated and pornographic films are exhibited, contrary to public morals and Filipino customs and traditions.”{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==== Downfall ====
{{See also|People Power Revolution}}
During these years, Marcos's regime was marred by rampant corruption and political mismanagement by his relatives and cronies, which culminated with the assassination of Benigno Aquino. Critics considered Marcos the quintessential [[kleptocracy|kleptocrat]],&lt;ref&gt;See for example {{cite book|author=Wintrobe, Ronald|title=The Political Economy of Dictatorship|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0-521-79449-7|pages=11; 132|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=o4G8SlNUROoC&amp;pg=PA132}}&lt;/ref&gt; having looted billions of dollars from the Filipino treasury. The large personality cult in the Philippines surrounding Marcos also led to disdain.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

During his third term, Marcos's health deteriorated rapidly due to kidney ailments, often described as [[lupus erythematosus]]. He was absent for weeks at a time for treatment, with no one to assume command. Marcos's regime was sensitive to publicity of his condition; a palace physician who alleged that during one of these periods Marcos had undergone a [[kidney transplant]] was shortly afterward found murdered. Many people questioned whether he still had capacity to govern, due to his grave illness and the ballooning political unrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wurfel, David|title=Filipino Politics: Development and Decay|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1988|page=289|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=R-oK4ZetPIAC&amp;pg=PA289|isbn=978-0-8014-9926-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Marcos ailing, his equally powerful wife, Imelda, emerged as the government's main public figure. Marcos dismissed speculations of his ailing health as he used to be an avid golfer and fitness buff who liked showing off his physique. In light of these growing problems, the assassination of Aquino in 1983 would later prove to be the catalyst that led to his overthrow. Many Filipinos came to believe that Marcos, a shrewd political tactician, had no hand in the murder of Aquino but that he was involved in cover-up measures. However, the opposition blamed Marcos directly for the assassination while others blamed the military and his wife, Imelda. The 1985 acquittals of Ver as well as other high-ranking military officers for the crime were widely seen as a miscarriage of justice.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

By 1984, his close personal ally, U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]], started distancing himself from the Marcos regime that he and previous American presidents had strongly supported even after Marcos declared martial law. The United States, which had provided hundreds of millions of dollars in aid, was crucial in buttressing Marcos's rule over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pace|first=Eric|title=Autocrat With a Regal Manner, Marcos Ruled for 2 Decades|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0715FE3A5E0C7A8EDDA00894D1484D81|accessdate=January 24, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 29, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Carter administration the relation with the U.S. soured somewhat when President [[Jimmy Carter]] targeted the Philippines in his human rights campaign.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In the face of escalating public discontent and under pressure from foreign allies, Marcos called a &quot;[[Snap election]]&quot; in 1986, with more than a year left in his term. He selected [[Arturo Tolentino]] as his running mate.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} The opposition to Marcos united behind Aquino's widow, [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon]], and her running mate, [[Salvador Laurel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Pollard, Vincent Kelly|title=Globalization, democratization and Asian leadership: power sharing, foreign policy and society in the Philippines and Japan|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|year=2004|isbn=978-0-7546-1539-2|page=50|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L37RZlzA530C&amp;pg=PA50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Parnell, Philip C.|chapter=Criminalizing Colonialism: Democracy Meets Law in Manila|editors=Parnell, Philip C. &amp; Kane, Stephanie C.|title=Crime's power: anthropologists and the ethnography of crime|publisher=Palgrave-Macmillan|year=2003|isbn=978-1-4039-6179-2|page=214|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=j2hpz4_fob4C&amp;pg=PA214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;[[People Power Revolution|People Power]] movement&quot; drove Marcos into exile and installed Corazon Aquino as the new president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Tate, C.

However, Marcos maintained that he was the duly elected and proclaimed president of the Philippines for a fourth term.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

The Philippine government today is still paying interest in public debts incurred during Marcos' administration. It was reported that, when Marcos fled, U.S. Customs agents discovered 24 suitcases of gold bricks and diamond jewelry hidden in diaper bags and in addition, certificates for gold bullion valued in the billions of dollars were allegedly among the personal properties he, his family, his cronies and business partners surreptitiously took with them when the Reagan administration provided them safe passage to Hawaii. When the presidential mansion was seized, it was discovered that [[Imelda Marcos]] had over 2700 pairs of shoes in her closet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=Encyclopædia Britannica |title=Ferdinand E.

To help finance a number of economic development projects, the Marcos government borrowed large amounts of money from international lenders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyce-1993-p10&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite book|author=Hutchcroft, Paul David|title=Booty capitalism: the politics of banking in the Philippines|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1998|isbn=978-0-8014-3428-0|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IqlmT6BsFoQC}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Philippines' external debt rose from $360 million (US) in 1962 to $28.3 billion in 1986, making the Philippines one of the most indebted countries in Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyce-1993-p10&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Boyce, James K.|title=The political economy of growth and impoverishment in the Marcos era|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|year=1993|isbn=978-971-550-096-8|page=10|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=IAL5Dx5SWy4C&amp;pg=PA10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sizable amount of this money went to Marcos family and friends in the form of behest loans. These loans were assumed by the government and still being serviced by taxpayers. Today, more than half of the country's revenues are outlaid for the payments on the interests of loans alone.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Foreign capital was invited to invest in certain industrial projects. They were offered incentives, including tax exemption privileges and the privilege of bringing out their profits in foreign currencies. One of the most important economic programs in the 1980s was the ''Kilusang Kabuhayan at Kaunlaran'' (Movement for Livelihood and Progress). This program was started in September 1981. Its aim was to promote the economic development of the [[barangay]]s by encouraging its residents to engage in their own livelihood projects. The government's efforts resulted in the increase of the nation's economic growth rate to an average of six percent or seven percent from 1970 to 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Aniceto C. Orbeta Jr., [http://www3.pids.gov.ph/ris/pdf/pidsdps9604.PDF Structural Adjustment and Poverty Alleviation in the Philippines], Philippine Institute for Development Studies, April 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Philippine economy suffered a great decline after the Aquino assassination in August 1983. The political troubles hindered the entry of foreign investments, and foreign banks stopped granting loans to the Philippine government.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} In an attempt to launch a national economic recovery program, Marcos negotiated with foreign creditors including the [[International Bank for Reconstruction and Development]], [[World Bank]], and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), for a restructuring of the country's foreign debts – to give the Philippines more time to pay the loans. Marcos ordered a cut in government expenditures and used a portion of the savings to finance the ''Sariling Sikap'' (Self-Reliance), a livelihood program he established in 1984.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

However, the economy experienced negative economic growth from the beginning of 1984 and continued to decline despite the government's recovery efforts. The recovery program's failure was caused by civil unrest, rampant graft and corruption within the government, and Marcos's lack of credibility. Marcos himself diverted large sums of government money to his party's campaign funds. The unemployment rate ballooned from 6.30% in 1972 to 27.65% in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gov.ph/1985/07/22/ferdinand-e-marcos-twentieth-state-of-the-nation-address-july-22-1985/&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Between 1972 and 1980, the average monthly income of wage workers had fallen by 20%. By 1981, the wealthiest 10% of the population was receiving twice as much income as the bottom 60%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morada-1998-p554&quot; /&gt;

With help from the [[Rockefeller Foundation|Rockefeller]] and [[Ford Foundation|Ford]] Foundations, Marcos brought the &quot;[[Green Revolution]]&quot; (industrialized, chemical agriculture) to the Philippines. These reforms resulted in high profits for transnational corporations, but were generally harmful to small, peasant farmers who were often pushed into poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nadeau, Kathleen M.|title=Liberation theology in the Philippines: faith in a revolution|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2002|isbn=978-0-275-97198-4|page=21|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kAINJWo4IJ4C&amp;pg=PA21}}&lt;/ref&gt; After declaring martial law in 1972, Marcos promised to implement agrarian reforms.

Under Marcos, exports of timber products were among the nation's top exports. Little attention was paid to environmental impacts of deforestation. By the early 1980s, the industry collapsed because most of the Philippines' accessible forests had been depleted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Boyce, James K.|title=The political economy of the environment|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2002|isbn=978-1-84376-108-2|pages=43–44|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=izGVtg8KE-YC&amp;pg=PA43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Post-presidency ==
At 3:00 p.m., February 21, 1986, Marcos talked to [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] [[Paul Laxalt]], asking for advice from the [[White House]]. Laxalt advised him to &quot;cut and cut cleanly&quot;, to which Marcos expressed his disappointment after a short pause. In the afternoon, Marcos talked to [[Juan Ponce Enrile|Enrile]], asking for safe passage for him and his family including his close allies like General Ver. Finally, at 9:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., the Marcos family was transported by four [[Sikorsky HH-3E]] [[helicopter]]s&lt;ref name=&quot;Halperin&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Halperin, Jonathan J.|title=The Other Side: How Soviets and Americans Perceive Each Other|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-88738-687-9|page=63|url=http://books.google.com/?id=H1so7Od--csC&amp;pg=PA63|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; to [[Clark Air Base]] in [[Angeles City]], Pampanga, about 83&amp;nbsp;kilometers north of Manila, before boarding [[US Air Force]] [[C-130]] planes bound for Andersen Air Force Base in [[Guam]], and finally to Hickam Air Force Base in Hawaii where Marcos arrived on February 26. Marcos died in [[Honolulu]] on September 28, 1989, of kidney, heart and lung ailments. He was interred in a private mausoleum at [[Byodo-In Temple]] on the island of Oahu, visited daily by the Marcos family, political allies and friends. The late strongman's remains are currently interred inside a refrigerated crypt in [[Ilocos Norte]], where his son, Ferdinand, Jr., and eldest daughter, Imee have since become the local governor and representative, respectively. A [[Mount Rushmore]]-esque bust of Ferdinand Marcos, commissioned by Tourism Minister [[Jose Aspiras]], was earlier carved into a hillside in Benguet. It was subsequently destroyed by suspects that include left-wing activists, members of a local tribe who have been displaced by its construction, and looters hunting for the Marcos' legendary hidden treasure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/2612709.stm |title=Philippines blast wrecks Marcos bust  |date=December 29, 2002 |publisher=BBC News  |accessdate=November 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Imelda Marcos was acquitted of embezzlement by a U.S. court in 1990 but was still facing a few hundred additional corruption charges in Philippine courts in 2006.

In 1995 some 10,000 Filipinos won a U.S. class-action lawsuit filed against the Marcos estate. The charges were filed by victims or their surviving relatives for torture, execution and disappearances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Brysk, Alison|title=Human rights and private wrongs: constructing global civil society|publisher=Psychology Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-415-94477-9|page=82|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=p955OKtyCbIC&amp;pg=PA82}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/ViewArticle.aspx?articleid=2809885 |title=No hero's resting place as Imelda Marcos finds site for husband's grave |author=Hrvoje Hranjski |work=The Scotsman |location=UK |date=September 12, 2006 |accessdate=November 19, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corazon Aquino repealed many of the repressive laws that had been enacted during Marcos' dictatorship. She restored the right to [[habeas corpus]], repealed anti-labor laws, and freed hundreds of [[political prisoners]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Schirmer, Daniel B. &amp; Shalom, Stephen R.|title=The Philippines reader: a history of colonialism, neocolonialism, dictatorship, and resistance|publisher=[[South End Press]]|year=1987|isbn=978-0-89608-275-5|page=361|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=TXE73VWcsEEC&amp;pg=PA361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1989 to 1996, a series of suits were brought before U.S. courts against Marcos and his daughter Imee, charging them with executions, torture, and disappearances committed under their command. A jury in the Ninth Circuit Court awarded $2 billion to the plaintiffs and to a [[class action lawsuit|class]] composed of human rights victims and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephens, Beth|title=International human rights litigation in U.S. courts|publisher=BRILL|year=2008|isbn=978-1-57105-353-4|page=13|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=isF30B-VCH0C&amp;pg=PA13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 12, 2008, the [[US Supreme Court]] (in a 7–2 ruling penned by Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]] in “Republic of the Philippines v. Mariano Pimentel”) held that: “The judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is reversed, and the case is remanded with instructions to order the District Court to dismiss the interpleader action.” The court dismissed the [[interpleader]] lawsuit filed to determine the rights of 9,500 [[Filipino people|Filipino]] human rights victims (1972–1986) to recover $35 million, part of a $2 billion judgment in U.S. courts against the Marcos estate, because the Philippines is an indispensable party, protected by sovereign immunity. It claimed ownership of the funds transferred by Marcos in 1972 to Arelma S.A., which invested the money with Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith Inc., in New York.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/06/supreme-court-rules-in-marcos-assets.php jurist.law.pitt.edu, Supreme Court rules in Marcos assets]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/07pdf/06-1204.pdf supremecourt.gov, REPUBLIC OF PHILIPPINES ET AL. v.

Human rights groups place the number of victims of [[extrajudicial killing]]s under martial law at 1500 and ''Karapatan'', a local human rights group's records show 759 involuntarily disappeared (their bodies never found).

According to [[Jovito Salonga]], monopolies in several vital industries have been created and placed under the control of Marcos cronies, such as the coconut industries (under [[Eduardo Cojuangco, Jr.]] and [[Juan Ponce Enrile]]), the tobacco (under [[Lucio Tan]]), the banana (under [[Antonio Floirendo]]), the sugar industry (under [[Roberto Benedicto]]) and manufacturing (under [[Herminio Disini]] and [[Ricardo Silverio]]). The Marcos and Romualdez families became owners, directly or indirectly, of the nation's largest corporations, such as the Philippine Long Distance Company (PLDC), of which the present name is Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT), the Philippine Airlines (PAL), Meralco (an electric company), Fortune Tobacco, the San Miguel Corporation (Asia's largest beer and bottling company), numerous newspapers, radio and TV broadcasting companies (such as [[ABS-CBN]]), several banks, and real estate properties in New York, California and Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/54a/064.html |title=Jovito R.
