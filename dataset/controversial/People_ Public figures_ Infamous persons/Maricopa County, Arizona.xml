'''Maricopa County''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|m|ær|ɨ|ˈ|k|oʊ|p|ə}} {{Respell|MARR|i|KOH|pə}}) is located in the south-central part of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Arizona]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], its population was 3,817,117, the most populous in the state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://2010.census.gov/2010census/data/ |title=Maricopa County 2010 US Census Bureau |publisher=Quickfacts.census.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which [[List of the most populous counties in the United States|ranks fourth]] among the nation's [[County (United States)|counties]] and is greater than the population of [[List of U.S. states by population|23 states]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/popest/counties/CO-EST2007-01.html US county census]&lt;/ref&gt; Maricopa County is also one of the largest counties in the United States by [[County_statistics_of_the_United_States#Twenty-five_largest_counties_.28or_county_equivalents.29_by_land_area|area]] having a land area [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|greater than that of seven states]]. The [[county seat]] is [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]],{{GR|6}} which is Arizona's largest city and capital. The [[center of population]] of Arizona is located in Maricopa County, in the town of [[Gilbert, Arizona|Gilbert]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://agic.az.gov/education/population.htm Arizona Center of Population Ceremony], [[Arizona Geographic Information Council]], 2005-06-15. Retrieved 2007-12-17.&lt;/ref&gt; It is by far Arizona's most populous county, encompassing well over half of the state's residents.  It is also the largest county in the United States to contain a capital city.

The population explosion is evident in a 2007 ''[[Forbes]]'' study which ranked four of Maricopa County's municipalities in the top ten fastest-growing cities in the nation.  Those included [[Buckeye, Arizona|Buckeye]] as the second-fastest-growing city, [[Surprise, Arizona|Surprise]] and [[Goodyear, Arizona|Goodyear]] as 3rd and 4th, and [[Avondale, Arizona|Avondale]] as 9th.&lt;ref&gt;Woolsey, Matt. - [http://www.forbes.com/forbeslife/2007/07/16/suburbs-growth-housing-forbeslife-cx_mw_0716realestate_2.html &quot;America's Fastest-Growing Suburbs&quot;]. - ''[[Forbes]]''. - July 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  All four of these cities are located in the growing &quot;West Valley&quot;, which is the area of Maricopa County to the west of the city of Phoenix.

There are five [[Indian reservations]] located in the county.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/history/nagpra/DOCUMENTS/RESERV.PDF Indian Reservations in the Continental United States], [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]] on [[National Park Service]] website. Retrieved 2009-01-18.&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest of these are the [[Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community]] (east of Scottsdale) and the [[Gila River Indian Community]] (south of Phoenix).

Maricopa County has a long history of being a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] stronghold. While the city of [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] leans towards the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], along with some other small areas within the county, the rest of the county tends to vote heavily Republican. Every Republican presidential candidate has carried Maricopa County since 1948. This includes the 1964 presidential run of native son [[Barry Goldwater]]; who would not have even carried his own state had it not been for a 21,000-vote margin in Maricopa County.

Despite its political leanings, Maricopa County voted against Proposition 107 in the 2006 election. This referendum, designed to ban gay marriage and restrict domestic partner benefits, was rejected by a slim 51.6%-48.4% margin within the county, and statewide by a similar margin. Two years later, however, a majority of county residents voted to pass the ultimately successful state constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.

The [[Maricopa County Board of Supervisors|County Board of Supervisors]] consists of five members chosen by popular vote within their own districts. Currently, the Board consists of four Republicans, each representing districts in the more affluent or conservative districts of the county, and one Democrat, representing the largest district.&lt;ref name=&quot;BOS&quot;&gt;[http://maricopa.gov/BOS/ Maricopa County Board of Supervisors], Maricopa County, 2012. Retrieved 2012-06-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Each member serves for a period of four years, and may be continuously reelected. The Board of Supervisors acts in the capacity of executive authority for the county within the statutes and powers prescribed by Arizona state law. In this respect the Legislature of the State of Arizona is, in effect, the legislative body of the county, with limited discretion granted to the Board of Supervisors on minor ordinance and revenue collection issues. Chair of the Board is held by one member for a period of one year, and is selected by the Board members themselves through public hearing. Unlike cities and towns in Arizona, each county is not a chartered government and is considered both politically and legally a sub-division of the state.

The election of the County Sheriff, County Attorney, County Assessor, County Treasurer, Superintendent of Schools, County Recorder, Constables, Justices of the Peace, Clerk of the Superior Court, and retention of Superior Court Judges are also determined by popular vote.

The current sheriff is [[Joe Arpaio]], who has labeled himself &quot;America's Toughest Sheriff&quot; due to his flamboyant and often controversial management of office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcso.org/index.php?a=GetModule&amp;mn=Sheriff_Bio Joseph M. Arpaio], Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, 2005. Retrieved 2007-12-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Maricopa County is home to almost 60 percent of the state's population, it dominates Arizona's politics. Six of the state's eight congressional districts take in significant portions of the county, and most of the state's most prominent elected officials live there.

==Transportation==
{{Main|Metropolitan Phoenix Freeways}}

The county is served by three interstates ([[Interstate 8 in Arizona|Interstate 8]], [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|Interstate 10]], and [[Interstate 17]]), one U.S. Highway ([[U.S. Route 60 in Arizona|US 60]]), and several state highways ([[Arizona State Route 51|SR 51]], [[Arizona State Route 74|SR 74]], [[Arizona State Route 85|SR 85]], [[Arizona State Route 87|SR 87]], [[Arizona State Route 143|SR 143]], [[Arizona State Route 101|Loop 101]], [[Arizona State Route 202|Loop 202]], and [[Arizona State Route 303|Loop 303]]).

In the area of rail transport, the region is also served by Phoenix's [[Metro Light Rail (Phoenix)|light rail system]]. The county has no other passenger rail transport as [[Amtrak]]'s [[Sunset Limited]], which once served Phoenix, has its closest stop in [[Maricopa, Arizona]] in neighboring [[Pinal County]]. The train connects Maricopa to [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], [[Los Angeles]], and [[New Orleans]] three times a week. However it does not stop in Phoenix itself.
