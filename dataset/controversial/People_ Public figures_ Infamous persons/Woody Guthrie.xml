'''Woodrow Wilson''' &quot;'''Woody'''&quot; '''Guthrie''' (July 14, 1912&amp;nbsp;– October 3, 1967) was an American [[singer-songwriter]] and [[folk music]]ian whose musical legacy includes hundreds of political, [[Traditional music|traditional]] and children's songs, [[ballad]]s and improvised works. He frequently performed with the slogan ''This Machine Kills Fascists'' displayed on his guitar. His best-known song is &quot;[[This Land Is Your Land]].&quot; Many of his recorded songs are archived in the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress. [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?faid/faid:@field(DOCID+af001001)#Related%20Material%20-%20Woody%20Guthrie%20Sound%20Recordings%20at%20the%20American%20Folklife%20Center Related Material – Woody Guthrie Sound Recordings at the American Folklife Center.] Retrieved on November 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Such songwriters as [[Bob Dylan]], [[Phil Ochs]], [[Bruce Springsteen]], [[John Mellencamp]], [[Pete Seeger]], [[Joe Strummer]], [[Billy Bragg]], [[Jeff Tweedy]] and [[Tom Paxton]] have acknowledged Guthrie as a major influence. 

Many of his songs are about his experiences in the [[Dust Bowl]] era during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] when Guthrie traveled with migrant workers from Oklahoma to California and learned their traditional folk and blues songs, earning him the nickname the &quot;Dust Bowl Troubadour.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alarik, Scott.

Guthrie was married three times and fathered eight children, including [[American folk music|American folk]] musician [[Arlo Guthrie]]. Guthrie died from complications of [[Huntington's disease]], a progressive genetic [[neurological]] disorder. During his later years, in spite of his illness, Guthrie served as a [[Figurehead (metaphor)|figurehead]] in the [[Folk music|folk movement]], providing inspiration to a generation of new folk musicians, including mentor relationships with [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]] and [[Bob Dylan]].

==Biography==
===Early life: 1912–30===
[[Image:Guthrie house.jpg|thumb|Woody Guthrie's [[Okfuskee County, Oklahoma]], childhood home as it appeared in 1979]]
Guthrie was born in [[Okemah, Oklahoma|Okemah]], a small town in [[Okfuskee County, Oklahoma]], the son of Nora Belle (née Sherman) and Charles Edward Guthrie.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reitwiesner&quot;&gt;Reitwiesner, William Addams. [http://www.wargs.com/other/guthrie.html Ancestry of Arlo Guthrie.] Retrieved on November 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His parents named him after [[Woodrow Wilson]], then Governor of New Jersey and the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate soon to be elected [[President of the United States]].

Charles Guthrie was an industrious businessman, owning at one time up to {{nowrap|30 plots}} of land in Okfuskee County. He was actively involved in Oklahoma politics and was a Democratic candidate for office in the county. When Charles was making [[Stump speech (politics)|stump speeches]], he would often be accompanied by his son.&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man,'' p.&amp;nbsp;11&lt;/ref&gt;
Charles Guthrie was involved in the 1911 [[lynching of Laura and Lawrence Nelson]].  His son wrote three songs about the event and said that his father was later a member of the revived [[Ku Klux Klan]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Mark Allan. ''Prophet Singer: The Voice and Vision of Woody Guthrie.'' University Press of Mississippi, 2008, p. 136, 157ff.

Guthrie's early family life was affected by several fires, including one that caused the loss of his family's home in Okemah. His sister Clara later died in a [[coal oil|coal-oil]] (used for heating) fire when Guthrie was seven, and Guthrie's father was severely burned in a subsequent coal-oil fire.&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&amp;nbsp;30&lt;/ref&gt; The circumstances of these fires, especially that in which Charley was injured, remain unclear. It is unknown whether they were accidents or the result of actions by Guthrie's mother Nora, who was afflicted with [[Huntington's disease]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Celebrity Diagnosis&quot;&gt;[Happy 100th Birthday Woody Guthrie!][http://www.celebritydiagnosis.com/2012/07/happy-100th-birthday-woody-guthrie/]&lt;/ref&gt;, although the family did not know this at the time. It leads to [[dementia]] as well as muscular effects.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', pp.&amp;nbsp;26,&amp;nbsp;32,&amp;nbsp;39&lt;/ref&gt;

Nora Guthrie was eventually committed to the Oklahoma Hospital for the Insane, where she died in 1930 from Huntington's disease. Judging from the circumstances of her father's death by drowning, researchers suspect that George Sherman suffered from the same [[hereditary]] disease.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt;

When Nora Guthrie was institutionalized, Woody Guthrie was 14.  His father Charley was living and working in [[Pampa, Texas]], to repay his debts from unsuccessful real estate deals. Woody and his siblings were on their own in Oklahoma; they relied on their eldest brother Roy for support. The 14-year-old Woody Guthrie worked odd jobs around Okemah, begging meals and sometimes sleeping at the homes of family friends. According to one story, Guthrie made friends with an African-American blues harmonica player named &quot;George&quot;, whom he would watch play at the man's shoe shine booth. Before long, Guthrie bought his own harmonica and began playing along with him. In another interview 14 years later, Guthrie claimed he learned how to play harmonica from a boyhood friend, John Woods, and that his earlier story about the shoe-shining player was false.&lt;ref&gt;Guthrie's interview with [[Alan Lomax]] at the [[Library of Congress]] Recording Sessions, as recorded in Cray, ''Ramblin Man,'' p.&amp;nbsp;28. But in another interview 14&amp;nbsp;years later, Guthrie claimed he learned how to play harmonica from a boyhood friend, John Woods, and that his earlier story was false. ibid, p.&amp;nbsp;410.&lt;/ref&gt; 

He seemed to have a natural affinity for music and easily learned to &quot;[[Learning music by ear|play by ear]].&quot; He began to use his musical skills around town, playing a song for a sandwich or coins.&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man,'' p.&amp;nbsp;28&lt;/ref&gt; Guthrie easily learned old ballads and traditional English &amp; Scots songs from the parents of friends. Although he did not excel as a student (he dropped out of high school in his fourth year and did not graduate), his teachers described him as bright. He was an avid reader on a wide range of topics. Friends recall his reading constantly.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man,'' p.&amp;nbsp;44&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, Guthrie's father sent for his son to come to Texas, but little changed for the aspiring musician. Guthrie, then 18, was reluctant to attend high school classes in Pampa and spent much time learning songs by [[busking]] on the streets and reading in the library at Pampa's city hall. He was growing as a musician, gaining practice by regularly playing at dances with his father's half-brother Jeff Guthrie, a fiddle player. At the library, he wrote a manuscript summarizing everything he had read on the basics of psychology. A librarian in Pampa shelved this manuscript under Guthrie's name, but it was later lost in a library reorganization.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

===1930s: Traveling===
At age&amp;nbsp;19, Guthrie met and married his first wife, Mary Jennings, with whom he had three children,&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie,'' p.&amp;nbsp;62&lt;/ref&gt; Gwendolyn, Sue, and Bill, all of whom would later die prematurely. With the advent of the [[Dust Bowl]] era, Guthrie left Texas, leaving Mary behind, and joined the thousands of [[Okies]] who were migrating to [[California]] looking for work. Many of his songs are concerned with the conditions faced by these [[working class]] people.

====California====
During the late part of that decade, he achieved fame with radio partner Maxine &quot;Lefty Lou&quot; Crissman as a broadcast performer of commercial &quot;[[hillbilly]]&quot; music and traditional folk music.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;90–92,&amp;nbsp;103–12&lt;/ref&gt; Guthrie was making enough money to send for his family, who were still living in Texas. While appearing on the commercial radio station [[KFVD]], owned by a populist-minded [[New Deal]] Democrat [[Frank W. Burke]], Guthrie began to write and perform some of the protest songs that would eventually appear on ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]].'' 

It was at KFVD that Guthrie met newscaster Ed Robbin. Robbin was impressed with a song Guthrie wrote about [[Thomas Mooney]], believed by many to be a wrongly convicted man who was, at the time, a leftist ''[[cause célèbre]].''&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man,'' p.&amp;nbsp;139&lt;/ref&gt; Robbin, who became Guthrie's political mentor, introduced Guthrie to socialists and Communists in Southern California, including [[Will Geer]].  He remained Guthrie's lifelong friend, and helped Guthrie book benefit performances in the Communist circles in Southern California. Notwithstanding Guthrie's later claim that &quot;the best thing that I did in 1936 was to sign up with the Communist Party,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Woody Guthrie Archives. &quot;My Constitution and Me&quot; [http://woodyguthrie.org/ Woody Guthrie Archives Collection]. Manuscripts Box 7 Folder 23.1, Unavailable online, link to Woody Guthrie Archives website for contact information.&lt;/ref&gt; he was never a member of the Party. He was noted as a [[fellow traveler]]—an outsider who agreed with the platform of the party while not subject to party discipline.&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man,'' p.&amp;nbsp;151&lt;/ref&gt; Guthrie asked to write a column for the Communist newspaper, ''[[Daily Worker|The Daily Worker]].'' The column, titled &quot;Woody Sez,&quot; appeared a total of 174&amp;nbsp;times from May&amp;nbsp;1939 to January&amp;nbsp;1940. &quot;Woody Sez&quot; was not explicitly political, but was about current events as observed by Guthrie. He wrote the columns in an [[eye dialect|exaggerated hillbilly dialect]] and usually included a small comic;&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man,'' p.&amp;nbsp;153&lt;/ref&gt; they were published as a collection after Guthrie's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spivey&quot;/&gt; [[Steve Earle]] said of Guthrie, &quot;I don't think of Woody Guthrie as a political writer. He was a writer who lived in very political times.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Corn, David. [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20021104/corn/2 Jerusalem Calling], ''The Nation,'' October 17, 2002. Retrieved on November 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of World War II and the [[Nazi-Soviet Pact|nonaggression pact]] the [[Soviet Union]] had signed with Germany in 1939, the owners of KFVD radio did not want its staff &quot;spinning apologia&quot; for the Soviet Union. Both Robbin and Guthrie left the station.&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; Without the daily radio show, his prospects for employment diminished, and Guthrie and his family returned to Pampa, Texas. Although Mary Guthrie was happy to return to Texas, the wanderlusting Guthrie soon after accepted Will Geer's invitation to New York City and headed east.

===1940s: Building a Legacy===
====New York City====
Arriving in New York, Guthrie, known as &quot;the Oklahoma cowboy,&quot; was embraced by its leftist folk music community. For a time, he slept on a couch in [[Will Geer]]'s apartment. Guthrie made his first recordings—several hours of conversation and songs recorded by the folklorist [[Alan Lomax]] for the [[Library of Congress]]—as well as an album, ''[[Dust Bowl Ballads]],'' for [[Victor Records]] in [[Camden, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man,'' p.&amp;nbsp;174&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Listen|filename=Woody Guthrie - This Land.ogg|title=&quot;This Land is Your Land&quot;|description=Sample of Woody Guthrie's song, &quot;This Land is Your Land&quot;|format=[[Ogg]]}}

Guthrie was tired of the radio overplaying [[Irving Berlin]]'s &quot;[[God Bless America]].&quot; He thought the lyrics were unrealistic and complacent.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie,'' p.&amp;nbsp;144&lt;/ref&gt; Partly inspired by his experiences during a cross-country trip and his distaste for &quot;God Bless America,&quot; he wrote his most famous song, &quot;[[This Land Is Your Land]],&quot; in February&amp;nbsp;1940; it was subtitled &quot;God Blessed America for Me.&quot; The melody is adapted from an old gospel song, &quot;Oh My Loving Brother.&quot;  This was best known as &quot;When The World's On Fire,&quot; sung by the country group [[The Carter Family]]. Guthrie signed the manuscript with the comment, &quot;All you can write is what you see, Woody G., N.Y., N.Y., N.Y.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man,'' p.&amp;nbsp;165&lt;/ref&gt; He protested against class inequality in the fourth and sixth verses:

:''As I went walking, I saw a sign there,''
:''And on the sign there, It said &quot;no trespassing.&quot;'' [In another version, the sign reads &quot;Private Property&quot;]
:''But on the other side, it didn't say nothing!''
:''That side was made for you and me.''

:''In the squares of the city, In the shadow of a steeple;''
:''By the relief office, I'd seen my people.''
:''As they stood there hungry, I stood there asking,''
:''Is this land made for you and me?''

These verses were often omitted in subsequent recordings, sometimes by Guthrie. Although the song was written in 1940, it was four years before he recorded it for [[Moses Asch]] in April 1944.,&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie,'' p.&amp;nbsp;287&lt;/ref&gt; Sheet music was not produced and given to schools by [[Howie Richmond]] until later.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Klein, ''Woody Guthrie,'' p.&amp;nbsp;375&lt;/ref&gt;

In March&amp;nbsp;1940, Guthrie was invited to play at a benefit hosted by The [[John Steinbeck]] Committee to Aid Farm Workers, to raise money for migrant workers. There he met the folksinger  [[Pete Seeger]], and the two men became good friends.&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man,'' p.&amp;nbsp;168&lt;/ref&gt; Later&lt;!--that year? Or the month &quot;In May that year,&quot;--&gt;, Seeger accompanied Guthrie back to Texas to meet other members of the Guthrie family.  He recalled an awkward conversation with Mary Guthrie's mother, in which she asked for Seeger's help to persuade Guthrie to treat her daughter better.&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'' p.&amp;nbsp;188&lt;/ref&gt;

Guthrie had some success in New York at this time as a guest on [[CBS]]'s radio program ''Back Where I Come From'' and used his influence to get a spot on the show for his friend [[Lead Belly|Huddie &quot;Lead Belly&quot; Ledbetter]]. Ledbetter's Tenth Street apartment was a gathering spot for the leftwing musician circle in New York at the time, and Guthrie and Ledbetter were good friends, as they had busked together at bars in Harlem.&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;194,&amp;nbsp;195&lt;/ref&gt;

In September&amp;nbsp;1940 Guthrie was invited by the Model Tobacco Company to host their radio program, ''Pipe Smoking Time.'' Guthrie was paid $180 a week, an impressive salary in 1940.&lt;ref name=cray197&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'' p.&amp;nbsp;197&lt;/ref&gt; He was finally making enough money to send regular payments back to Mary.  He also brought her and the children to New York, where the family lived briefly in an apartment on [[Central Park West]]. The reunion represented Woody's desire to be a better father and husband. He said &quot;I have to set ['sic'] real hard to think of being a dad.&quot;&lt;ref name=cray197/&gt; Guthrie quit after the seventh broadcast, claiming he had begun to feel the show was too restrictive when he was told what to sing.&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'' p.&amp;nbsp;200&lt;/ref&gt; Disgruntled with New York, Guthrie packed up Mary and his children in a new car and headed west to California.&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'' p.&amp;nbsp;199&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pacific Northwest====
In May 1941, after a brief stay in Los Angeles, Guthrie moved the family north to [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington state]] on the promise of a job. [[Gunther von Fritsch]] was directing a documentary about the [[Bonneville Power Administration|Bonneville Power Administration's]] construction of the [[Grand Coulee Dam]] on the [[Columbia River]], and needed a narrator. Alan Lomax had recommended Guthrie to narrate the film and sing songs onscreen. The original project was expected to take 12 months, but as filmmakers became worried about casting such a political figure, they minimized Guthrie's role. The [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]] hired him for one month to write songs about the [[Columbia River]] and the construction of the federal dams for the documentary's soundtrack.  Guthrie toured the Columbia River and the Pacific Northwest. Guthrie said he &quot;couldn't believe it, it's a paradise&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; which appeared to inspire him creatively. In one month Guthrie wrote 26 songs, including three of his most famous: &quot;[[Roll On Columbia]]&quot;, &quot;[[Pastures of Plenty]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Grand Coulee Dam (song)|Grand Coulee Dam]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', pp.&amp;nbsp;195, 196, 202, 205, 212&lt;/ref&gt; The surviving songs were released as ''[[The Columbia River Collection (Woody Guthrie Album)|Columbia River Songs]]''. The film &quot;Columbia&quot; was not completed until 1949 (see below).
At the conclusion of the month in Oregon and Washington, Guthrie wanted to return to New York. Tired of the continual uprooting, Mary Guthrie told him to go without her and the children.&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Although Guthrie would see Mary again, once on a tour through Los Angeles with the Almanac Singers, it was essentially the end of their marriage. Divorce was difficult, since Mary was a member of the [[Catholic Church]], but she reluctantly agreed in December 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Woody Guthrie NYWTS.jpg|left|thumb|Woody Guthrie, 1943]]

====Almanac Singers====
{{Main|Almanac Singers}}
Following the conclusion of his work in Washington State, Guthrie corresponded with [[Pete Seeger]] about Seeger's newly formed folk-protest group, the [[Almanac Singers]]. Guthrie returned to New York with plans to tour the country as a member of the group.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.192-93,195–231&lt;/ref&gt; The singers originally worked out of a loft in New York City hosting regular concerts called &quot;[[hootenanny]]s&quot;, a word Pete and Woody had picked up in their cross-country travels. The singers eventually outgrew the space and moved into the cooperative Almanac House in [[Greenwich Village]].

Initially Guthrie helped write and sing what the Almanac Singers termed &quot;peace&quot; songs; while the Nazi-Soviet Pact was in effect, until Hitler invaded the Soviet Union in June 1941, the Communist line was that [[World War II]] was a capitalist fraud. After Hitler's invasion of the Soviet Union, the group wrote anti-fascist songs. The members of the Almanac Singers and residents of the Almanac House were a loosely defined group of musicians, though the 'core' members included Guthrie, [[Pete Seeger]], [[Millard Lampell]] and [[Lee Hays]]. In keeping with common socialist ideals, meals, chores and rent at the Almanac House were shared. The Sunday hootenannys were good opportunities to collect donation money for rent. Songs written in the Almanac House had shared songwriting credits among all the members, although in the case of &quot;[[Union Maid]]&quot;, members would later state that Guthrie wrote the song, ensuring that his children would receive residuals.&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&amp;nbsp;220&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Almanac House, Guthrie added authenticity to their work, since he was a &quot;real&quot; working-class Oklahoman. &quot;There was the heart of America personified in Woody ... And for a New York Left that was primarily Jewish, first or second generation American, and was desperately trying to get Americanized, I think a figure like Woody was of great, great importance&quot;, a friend of the group, [[Irwin Silber]], would say.&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&amp;nbsp;216&lt;/ref&gt; Woody routinely emphasized his working-class image, rejected songs he felt were not in the country blues vein he was familiar with, and rarely contributed to household chores. House member [[Sis Cunningham|Agnes &quot;Sis&quot; Cunningham]], another Okie, would later recall that Woody, &quot;loved people to think of him as a real working class person and not an intellectual&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&amp;nbsp;231&lt;/ref&gt; Guthrie contributed songwriting and authenticity in much the same capacity for Pete Seeger's post-Almanac Singers project ''[[People's Songs]]'', a newsletter and booking organization for labor singers, founded in 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;PS1&quot;&gt;People's Songs Inc. ''People's Songs Newsletter, Vol 1. No 1.''. 1945. [[Old Town School of Folk Music]] resource center collection.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Bound for Glory''====
Guthrie was a prolific writer, penning thousands of pages of unpublished poems and prose, many written while living in New York City. After a recording session with Alan Lomax, Lomax suggested Guthrie write an autobiography.  Lomax thought Guthrie's descriptions of growing up were some of the best accounts he had read of American childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&amp;nbsp;200,&amp;nbsp;201&lt;/ref&gt; During this time Guthrie met [[Marjorie Mazia]], a dancer in New York who would become his second wife.

====The Asch recordings====
In 1944, Guthrie met [[Moses Asch|Moses &quot;Moe&quot; Asch]] of [[Folkways Records]], for whom he first recorded &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;.  Over the next few years, he recorded &quot;[[Worried Man Blues]]&quot;, along with [[Woody Guthrie discography#1944 &amp; 1945, The Asch Recordings|hundreds of other songs]]. These recordings would later be released by Folkways and Stinson Records, which had joint distribution rights.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&amp;nbsp;417&lt;/ref&gt; The Folkways recordings are available (through the [[Smithsonian Institute]] online shop); the most complete series of these sessions, culled from dates with Asch, is titled ''[[The Asch Recordings (Woody Guthrie Album)|The Asch Recordings]]''.

====World War II years====
Guthrie believed performing his anti-fascist songs and poems at home was the best use of his talents; Guthrie lobbied the United States Army to accept him as a USO performer instead of conscripting him as a soldier in the draft. When Guthrie's attempts failed, his friends [[Cisco Houston]] and [[Jim Longhi]] pressured Guthrie to join the [[United States Merchant Marine|U.S. Merchant Marine]].&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', pp.&amp;nbsp;277–80,&amp;nbsp;287–91&lt;/ref&gt; Guthrie followed their advice: he served as a mess man and dishwasher and frequently sang for the crew and troops to buoy their spirits on transatlantic voyages. Guthrie made attempts to write about his experience in the Merchant Marine but was never satisfied with the results. Longhi later wrote about these experiences in his book ''Woody, Cisco and Me''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Longhi |first=Jim |authorlink= Jim Longhi |title= Woody, Cisco and Me |year=1997 |publisher=[[Random House]] |isbn=0-252-02276-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book offers a rare first-hand account of Guthrie during his [[Merchant Marine]] service. In 1945, Guthrie's association with Communism made him ineligible for further service in the Merchant Marine, and he was drafted into the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', pp.&amp;nbsp;302–03&lt;/ref&gt;

While he was on [[Wiktionary:furlough|furlough]] from the Army, Guthrie and [[Marjorie Guthrie|Marjorie]] were married.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&amp;nbsp;312&lt;/ref&gt; After his discharge, they moved into a house on Mermaid Avenue in [[Coney Island]] and over time had four children. One of their children, Cathy, died as a result of a fire at age four, sending Guthrie into a serious depression.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&amp;nbsp;344–351&lt;/ref&gt; Their other children were Joady, [[Nora Guthrie|Nora]] and Arlo. [[Arlo Guthrie|Arlo]] followed in his father's footsteps as a singer-songwriter. During this period, Guthrie wrote and recorded ''[[Songs to Grow on for Mother and Child]]'', a collection of [[children's music]], which includes the song &quot;Goodnight Little Arlo (Goodnight Little Darlin')&quot;, written when Arlo was about nine years old.

A 1948 [[Accidents and incidents in aviation|crash]] of a plane carrying 28 Mexican farm workers from [[Oakland, California]], in [[deportation]] back to Mexico inspired Woody to write &quot;[[Deportee (Plane Wreck At Los Gatos)]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&amp;nbsp;364–65&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:10 of the Woody Guthrie songs - contact details.png|alt=|thumb|This page from a collection of Guthrie's sheet music published in 1946 includes his Mermaid Avenue address and one of his [[anti-fascism|anti-fascist]] slogans]]
The years living on Mermaid Avenue were among Guthrie's most productive periods as a writer. His extensive writings from this time were archived and maintained by Marjorie and later his estate, mostly handled by Guthrie's daughter, Nora. Several of the manuscripts contain scribblings by a young Arlo and the other Guthrie offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = WoodyGuthrie.org| title = Woody Guthrie Archives | url=http://www.woodyguthrie.org/archives/archivesindex.htm | accessdate = 2007-04-10 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]] studied extensively under Guthrie, visiting his home and observing how he wrote&lt;!--wrote music or words?--&gt; and performed. Elliott, like Bob Dylan later, idolized Guthrie and was inspired by his idiomatic performance style and repertoire. Because of Guthrie's suffering [[Huntington's disease]], Dylan and Guthrie's son Arlo later claimed they learned much of Guthrie's performance style from Elliott. When asked about Arlo's claim, Elliott said, &quot;I was flattered. Dylan learned from me the same way I learned from Woody. Woody didn't teach me. He just said, If you want to learn something, just steal it—that's the way I learned from Lead Belly.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}{{Failed verification|date=August 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=August 2009}}{{cite web | last = Mazor  | first = Barry | title = Wall Street Journal Interview: 'A Cultural Conversation With Ramblin' Jack' | url=http://ramblinjack.com/bio2.html | accessdate = 2007-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s and 1960s===
====Deteriorating health====
By the late 1940s, Guthrie's health was declining, and his behavior was becoming extremely erratic. He received various diagnoses (including [[alcoholism]] and [[schizophrenia]]), but in 1952, it was finally determined that he was suffering from [[Huntington's disease]] &lt;ref&gt; http://www.celebritydiagnosis.com/2012/07/happy-100th-birthday-woody-guthrie/&lt;/ref&gt;, a genetic disorder inherited from his mother. Believing him to be a danger to their children, Marjorie suggested he return to California without her; they eventually divorced&lt;!--or &quot;her; they divorced in[year]--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&amp;nbsp;388–94,&amp;nbsp;399&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his return to California, Guthrie lived at the [[Theatricum Botanicum]], a summer-stock type theatre founded and owned by [[Will Geer]]; with blacklisted singers and actors, he waited out the [[anti-communist]] political climate. As his health worsened, he met and married his third wife, Anneke Van Kirk.  They had a child, Lorinna Lynn. The couple moved to [[Fruit Cove, Florida]], briefly.  They lived in a bus on land called [[Beluthahatchee]], owned by his friend [[Stetson Kennedy]]. Guthrie's arm was hurt in a campfire accident when gasoline used to start the campfire exploded. Although he regained movement in the arm, he was never able to play the guitar again. In 1954, the couple returned to New York.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&amp;nbsp;418–19&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, Anneke filed for divorce, a result of the strain of caring for Guthrie. Anneke left New York and allowed friends to adopt Lorinna Lynn. Lorinna had no further contact with her birth parents and died in 1973 at the age of nineteen in a car accident in California. After the divorce, Guthrie's second wife, Marjorie, re-entered his life and cared for him until his death.

Guthrie, increasingly unable to control his muscles, was hospitalized at [[Greystone Park Psychiatric Hospital]] from 1956 to 1961, at Brooklyn State Hospital until 1966,&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&amp;nbsp;433–39&lt;/ref&gt; and finally at [[Creedmoor Psychiatric Center]] until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, ''Woody Guthrie'', p.&amp;nbsp;460&lt;/ref&gt; Marjorie and the children visited Guthrie at Greystone every Sunday. They answered fan mail and played on the hospital grounds. Eventually a longtime fan of Guthrie invited the family to his nearby home for the Sunday visits. This lasted until Guthrie was moved to the Brooklyn State Hospital, which was closer to where Marjorie lived. 

When Bob Dylan, who idolized Guthrie and whose early folk career was largely inspired by him, learned that Guthrie was hospitalized in Brooklyn, he was determined to meet his idol. By this time, Guthrie was said to have his &quot;good days&quot; and &quot;bad days&quot;. On the good days, Dylan would sing songs to him, and at the beginning Guthrie seemed to warm to Dylan. When the bad days came, Guthrie would berate Dylan. Reportedly on Dylan's last visit, Guthrie did not recognize him.{{CN|date=July 2012}} 

At the end of his  life, Guthrie was largely alone except for family. Because of the progression of Huntington's, he was difficult to be around. Guthrie's illness was essentially untreated, because of a lack of information about the disease. His death helped raise awareness of the disease and led Marjorie to help found the Committee to Combat Huntington's Disease, which became the [[Huntington's Disease Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Arévalo J, Wojcieszek J, Conneally PM |title=Tracing Woody Guthrie and Huntington's disease |journal=Semin Neurol |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=209–23 |year=2001 |month=June |pmid=11442329 |doi= 10.1055/s-2001-15269|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of Guthrie's three remaining children with Marjorie have developed symptoms of Huntington's. Mary Guthrie's son Bill died in an auto-train accident in [[Pomona, California]], at age 23.&lt;ref&gt;Cray, pg 394&lt;/ref&gt; Mary's other children, Gwendolyn and Sue, suffered from the disease and both died at 41&amp;nbsp;years of age.&lt;ref&gt;Cray, ''Ramblin Man'', p.&amp;nbsp;394&lt;/ref&gt;

====Folk revival and Guthrie's death====
In the late 1950s and early 1960s, a new generation of young people were inspired by folk singers including Guthrie. These &quot;folk revivalists&quot; became more politically aware in their music than those of the previous generation. The [[American folk music revival|American Folk Revival]] was beginning to take place, focused on the issues of the day, such as the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|civil rights movement]] and [[Free Speech Movement|free speech movement]]. Pockets of folk singers were forming around the country in places such as [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and the [[Greenwich Village]] neighborhood of New York City. One of Guthrie's visitors at Greystone Park was the 19-year-old [[Bob Dylan]] &lt;ref&gt;Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  who idolized Guthrie. Dylan wrote of Guthrie's repertoire: &quot;The songs themselves were really beyond category. They had the infinite sweep of humanity in them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dylan, ''Chronicles, Volume One'', p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;  After learning of Guthrie's whereabouts, Dylan regularly visited him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =  | first = | title = Let Us Now Praise Little Men | date=May 31, 1983|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,896825,00.html | publisher=Time Magazine |accessdate = 2007-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Guthrie died of complications of Huntington's disease on October 3, 1967. By the time of his death, his work had been discovered by a new audience, introduced to them in part &lt;!--is &quot;in part&quot; necessary?--&gt;through Dylan, [[Pete Seeger]], [[Ramblin' Jack Elliott]], his ex-wife Marjorie and other new members of the folk revival, and his son [[Arlo Guthrie|Arlo]].

===Jewish songs===
Marjorie Mazia was born Marjorie Greenblatt and her mother, [[Aliza Greenblatt]], was a well-known Yiddish poet. With her, Guthrie wrote numerous Jewish lyrics. Guthrie’s Jewish lyrics can be traced to the unusual collaborative relationship he had with his mother-in-law, who lived across from Guthrie and his family in Brooklyn in the 1940s. Guthrie (the Oklahoma troubadour) and Greenblatt (the Jewish wordsmith) often discussed their artistic projects and critiqued each other’s works, finding common ground in their shared love of culture and social justice, despite very different backgrounds. Their collaboration flourished in 1940s Brooklyn, where Jewish culture was interwoven with music, modern dance, poetry and anti-fascist, pro-labor, classic socialist activism. Guthrie was inspired to write songs that came directly out of this unlikely relationship, both personal and political; he identified the problems of Jews with those of his fellow Okies and other oppressed peoples.

These lyrics were rediscovered by [[Nora Guthrie]] and were set to music by the Jewish Klezmer group [[The Klezmatics]] with the release of ''Happy Joyous Hanukkah'' on JMG Records in 2007. The Klezmatics also released ''Wonder Wheel&amp;nbsp;— Lyrics by Woody Guthrie'', an album of spiritual lyrics put to music composed by the band.&lt;ref&gt;WoodyGuthrie.org.

===Copyright controversy===
[[File:20040823 Jibjab Copyright Scans.pdf|alt=|thumb|This collection of lyrics was published posthumously by the Electronic Frontier Foundation]]
On the typescript submitted for copyright of &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;, Guthrie wrote:

“This song is Copyrighted in U.S., under Seal of Copyright # 154085, for a period of 28 years, and anybody caught singin it without our permission, will be mighty good friends of ourn, cause we don’t give a dern. Publish it. Write it. Sing it. Swing to it. Yodel it. We wrote it, that’s all we wanted to do.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://creativecommons.org/weblog/entry/4101], quoting from &quot;Woody Guthrie: A Life.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Currently a number of different organizations claim copyright for many of Guthrie's songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodyguthrie.org/Lyrics/Publisher_Contact.htm |title=Woody Guthrie Songs Publisher Contact |publisher=Woodyguthrie.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[JibJab]] published a parody&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sendables.jibjab.com/originals/this_land |title=This Land &amp;#124; Funny Video Animation by JibJab |publisher=Sendables.jibjab.com |date=2004-07-09 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Guthrie's &quot;[[This Land Is Your Land]]&quot; to comment on the US 2004 Presidential election, Ludlow Music attempted to have this parody taken down, claiming it breached their copyright. JibJab then sued to affirm their parody was [[Fair Use]], with the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) acting for them. As part of their research on the case they found that the song had actually been first published by Woody Guthrie in 1945, although the copyright was not registered until 1956. This meant that when Ludlow applied to renew the copyright in 1984 they were 11 years too late, and the song had in fact been in the public domain since 1973 (28 years from first publication).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2004/08/song-belongs-you-and-me |title=This Song Belongs to You and Me &amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=2004-08-24 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ludlow agreed that JibJab were free to distribute their parody. In an interview on [[National Public Radio|NPR]] Arlo Guthrie said that he thought the parody was hilarious and he thought Woody would have loved it too.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boingboing.net/2004/08/04/arlo_guthrie_on_this.html |title=Arlo Guthrie on &quot;This Land&quot; parody |publisher=Boing Boing |date=2004-08-04 |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Ludlow still claims copyright for this song, though the basis for this claim is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2004/08/song-belongs-you-and-me |title=This Song Belongs to You and Me &amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=2004-08-24 |accessdate=2011-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
