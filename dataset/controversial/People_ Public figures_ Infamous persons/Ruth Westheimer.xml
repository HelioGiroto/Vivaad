'''Ruth Westheimer''' (born June 4, 1928) is a German-[[People of the United States|American]] [[sex therapy|sex therapist]], media personality, and author. Best known as '''Dr. Ruth''', ''[[The New York Times]]'' described her as a &quot;[[Sorbonne]]-trained psychologist who became a kind of [[cultural icon]] in the 1980s.… She ushered in the new age of freer, franker talk about sex on radio and television—and was endlessly parodied for her limitless enthusiasm and for having an accent only a [[psychologist]] could have.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barron&quot;&gt;Barron, James. &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/1998/12/13/arts/art-architecture-some-things-never-age-just-ask-dr-ruth.html?pagewanted=2&amp;src=pm Art/Architecture: Some Things Never Age. Just Ask Dr. Ruth].&quot; ''[[The New York Times]]'' 13 December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Westheimer was born '''Karola Ruth Siegel''' in Frankfurt Am Main, [[Weimar Republic|Germany]], the only child of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jews]] Irma (née Hanauer) and Julius Siegel. In January 1939 she was sent to Switzerland by her mother and grandmother after her father was taken by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;snopes-sniper&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=GAH&gt;German American Heritage biography http://www.germanheritage.com/biographies/mtoz/westheimer.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;Dullea, Georgia. &quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5D9103FF935A15753C1A961948260 Therapist to Therapist: Analyzing Dr. Ruth]&quot;. ''[[The New York Times]]'' 26 October 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; There she came of age in an [[orphanage]], and stopped receiving her parents' letters in September 1941. In 1945, Westheimer learned that her parents had been murdered in [[the Holocaust]], possibly at the [[Auschwitz concentration camp]].&lt;ref name=GAH/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;/&gt;

Westheimer decided to emigrate to the [[British Mandate of Palestine]]. There, at 17, she &quot;first had [[sexual intercourse]] on a starry night, in a haystackˇwithout [[Birth control|contraception]].&quot; She later told ''The New York Times'' that &quot;I am not happy about that, but I know much better now and so does everyone who listens to my radio program.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;/&gt; Westheimer joined the [[Haganah]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Because of her diminutive height of {{height|ft=4|in=7|abbr=MOS}},&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;/&gt; she was trained as a [[Reconnaissance|scout]] and [[sniper]].&lt;ref name=&quot;snopes-sniper&quot;&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/medical/doctor/drruth.asp Urban Legends Reference Pages: Dr. Ruth Was a Sniper] by Barbara Mikkelson, Last updated 1 March 2007, Retrieved 2 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Westheimer was seriously wounded in action by an exploding [[Shell (projectile)|shell]] during the [[Israeli War of Independence]] in 1948, and it was several months before she was able to walk again.&lt;ref name=GAH/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NatGeo&quot;&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2003/06/0611_030611_drruth_2.html Dr. Ruth: Sex Sage and Ex-Sniper on Global Sexuality] by Tom Foreman, National Geographic, June 11, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, Westheimer moved to France, where she studied and then taught psychology at the [[University of Paris]]. In 1956, she [[Immigration to the United States|immigrated to the United States]], settling in [[Washington Heights, Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris&quot;&gt;&quot;Morris, Bob. &quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E5D71439F932A15751C1A963958260 At Home With: Dr. Ruth Westheimer; The Bible as Sex Manual?]&quot; ''[[The New York Times]]'' 21 December 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;OpenMind&quot;&gt;&quot;Open Mind. &quot;[http://www.archive.org/details/openmind_ep1496 America's Significant Other: Dr. Ruth (1991)]&quot; ''OpenMind'' 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; She still lives in the &quot;cluttered three-bedroom apartment in Washington Heights where she raised her two children and became famous, in that order,&quot; because of the two [[synagogue]]s she belongs to, the [[Jewish Community Center|YMHA]] she was president of for three years, and a &quot;still sizable community of German Jewish World War II refugees,&quot; she remains in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris&quot;/&gt; She speaks English, German, French, and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].

She earned a [[master's degree]] in [[sociology]] from [[The New School]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drruth.com/content/view/42/27/ drruth.com ]&lt;/ref&gt; and an [[Doctor of Education|Ed.D.]] from [[Teachers College, Columbia University]]. She completed [[Postdoctoral researcher|post-doctoral work]] in [[human sexuality]] at [[New York-Presbyterian Hospital]], training with pioneer sex therapist [[Helen Singer Kaplan]].&lt;ref name=GAH/&gt;

Westheimer has written several books on human sexuality, including ''Dr. Ruth's Encyclopedia of Sex'' and ''Sex [[for Dummies]]''. The full version of ''Dr. Ruth's Encyclopedia of Sex'' is currently available online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sexuality-encyclopedia.com/ The Family Encyclopedia of Sex] by Dr. Ruth Westheimer&lt;/ref&gt;

Westheimer has given [[commencement speech]]es at the [[Hebrew Union College]] [[seminary]], [[Lehman College]] of the [[City University of New York]], and, in 2004, at [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon&quot;&gt;&quot;Gordon, Jane. &quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2DA153CF93AA35756C0A9629C8B63 Worth Noting: Calling Dr. Ruth (To Speak at Trinity)]&quot;. ''[[The New York Times]]'' 9 May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; She has also taught courses and seminars at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Yale University|Yale]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gordon&quot;/&gt;

Westheimer was the guest speaker at the [[Bronx High School of Science]] in  New York in commemoration of [[Yom HaShoah]] 2008. She spoke about her life story and the audience of 500 sang &quot;[[Happy Birthday to You|Happy Birthday]]&quot; in honor of her 80th birthday. At the ceremony she received an honorary Bronx High School of Science diploma. In 2008 she was awarded an Honorary Doctorate by Westfield State College.

In 2002, she received the [[Leo Baeck Institute|Leo Baeck Medal]] for her humanitarian work promoting tolerance and social justice.

Westheimer has been married three times.&lt;ref name=&quot;NatGeo&quot; /&gt; Her third marriage, to Manfred Westheimer, lasted until his death in 1997. She has two children, Miriam and Joel, and several grandchildren.
&lt;!--She has taught as lecturer and professor at [[Princeton University]] and [[New York University]] and led a recent seminar on the Jewish family at Yale.--&gt;

==Media career==
In 1980, [[WQHT|WYNY-FM]] was [[NBC|NBC Radio]]'s New York City [[owned-and-operated station]].  The struggling Adult Contemporary station had recently gone through a makeover in an attempt to build an audience. Part of this rebuild was adding specialized talk shows to the evening and weekend hours. Maurice Tunick was recruited from New York's leading talk station, [[WOR (AM)|WOR]], where he was talk show producer. As WYNY's Program Coordinator he was responsible for developing new talk shows.

Betty Elam was WYNY's Community Affairs Manager. Her job was to work closely with community groups and the station's public affairs programming. After attending a New York Market Radio (NYMRAD) convention at which Westheimer was a speaker, she was taken with Westheimer's passion, information, sense of humor, and personality and suggested that WYNY do something with her. She made two appearances as a guest on a taped Sunday morning public affairs program. WYNY's General Manager, Dan Griffin, then suggested that Tunick find a way to develop a public affairs show for her.

The show {{When|date=June 2010}} was assigned 15 minutes beginning at midnight on Sunday nights. Being a novice in radio, Westheimer thought it would be a good idea to have guests covering [[urology]], [[neurology]], [[gynecology]], etc.—all areas which could have an effect on [[sex]]. While that would be important, Tunick thought a better show would be to not have guests at all but to directly answer listeners' questions.  NBC was reluctant to allow live phone calls for a sex advice show, which was considered very risqué in the early 1980s, but Tunick suggested soliciting questions via mail.  Westheimer could then control the questions and read them on the air with her answers. Typically each question began with, &quot;I have a letter from a listener who asks...&quot;

The show, ''Sexually Speaking'', using the name &quot;Dr. Ruth,&quot; was taped in an NBC Radio studio at [[GE Building|30 Rockefeller Center]], NBC's radio and TV headquarters, on Thursday mornings at 11:00 a.m. for airing on Sunday nights at midnight.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rocketroberts.com/aircheck/audio/wyny_sexually_sp_01.mp3 Short audio clip #1 from Sexually Speaking with Dr. Ruth Westheimer on WYNY-FM New York.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rocketroberts.com/aircheck/audio/wyny_sexually_sp_3-21-82_01.mp3 Short audio clip #2 from Sexually Speaking with Dr. Ruth Westheimer on WYNY-FM New York.]&lt;/ref&gt; All NBC studios at &quot;30 Rock&quot; were accessible from other studios and many offices around the building.  A couple of weeks into recording, it was reported that work was stopping in many places in the building on Thursdays at 11 as people were gathering to hear this &quot;cross between [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Minnie Mouse]]&quot;, as ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' would later describe her.

After two months the show was expanded to an hour and went live, with Westheimer taking phone calls with a 7 second digital [[broadcast delay|delay]]. Within a year &quot;Dr. Ruth&quot; had a larger audience on Sunday night at midnight on this struggling station than many New York stations had in morning drive-time. She became known for being candid and funny, but respectful, and for her tag phrase, &quot;Get some.&quot;

As &quot;Dr. Ruth&quot;, Westheimer became nationally known after several appearances on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb.com&quot;&gt;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0922756/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yaleherald.com/article.php?Article=6129&lt;/ref&gt;  In less than two years, Dr. Ruth became a household name and was being heard on radio stations across the country.

Her pioneering TV show, also called ''Sexually Speaking'', first aired in 1982 as a 15-minute taped show on [[Lifetime Cable]]. It has since increased in popularity and has been nationally syndicated, as has her radio show.

In recent years, Westheimer has made regular appearances on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] Television children's show ''[[Between the Lions]]'' as &quot;Dr. Ruth Wordheimer&quot; in a parody of her therapist role, in which she helps anxious readers and spellers overcome their fear of long words.

She also made a cameo on PBS's ''Dinosaur Train'' as an Archeopteryx.

She appeared as herself in [[List of Quantum Leap episodes|episode 87]] of ''[[Quantum Leap (TV series)|Quantum Leap]]'', the episode title being &quot;Dr. Ruth&quot;. 

Westheimer appeared on [[Tom Chapin]]'s album '''This Pretty Planet''', in the song &quot;Two Kinds of Seagulls&quot;, in which she and Chapin sing of various animals that reproduce sexually.  &quot;It takes two to tingle,&quot; says the song.

As marketers took &quot;[[sex in advertising|sex sells]]&quot; literally, Westheimer appeared in commercials for the [[Honda Prelude]], circa 1993 ending with &quot;My advice to you is, 'Get a Prelude.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.superhonda.com/forum/f146/there-ever-prelude-commercial-78820/#post707786 |title=Was there ever a Prelude commercial? |date=November 5, 2002 |publisher=superhonda.com |accessdate=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Honda Prelude#Fourth generation]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Westheimer also worked as a spokeswoman for [[Clairol]] [[Herbal Essences]] [[shampoo]] and body wash, depicting a comical side to her work as a sex therapist. The commercials usually featured a woman imagining that she was using the shampoo on her hair, apparently receiving some sexual charge from it. When the woman snapped back to reality, Westheimer was standing next to her, stating that if the woman liked the shampoo, she should try the body wash as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb.com&quot;/&gt;

In the January 2009 55th anniversary issue of ''[[Playboy]]'', Westheimer appears as #13 in the list of the 55 most important people in sex from the past 55 years.
