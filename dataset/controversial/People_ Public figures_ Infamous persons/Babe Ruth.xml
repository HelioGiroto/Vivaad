'''George Herman Ruth, Jr.''' (February 6, 1895 – August 16, 1948), best known as '''&quot;Babe&quot; Ruth''' and nicknamed '''&quot;the Bambino&quot;''' and '''&quot;the Sultan of Swat&quot;''', was an American baseball player who spent 22 seasons in [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) playing for three teams (1914–1935). Known for his hitting brilliance, Ruth set career records for [[home run]]s (714), [[slugging percentage]] (.690), [[runs batted in]] (RBI) (2,217), and [[on-base plus slugging]] (OPS) (1.164). Ruth originally entered the major leagues with the [[Boston Red Sox]] as a [[starting pitcher]], but after he was sold to the [[New York Yankees]] in 1919, he converted to a full-time [[right fielder]]. He subsequently became one of the league's most prolific hitters and with his home run hitting prowess, he helped the Yankees win seven [[Pennant (sports)|pennants]] and four [[World Series]] titles. Ruth retired in 1935 after a short stint with the [[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]], and the following year, he became one of the first five players to be elected into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]].

Ruth was the first player to hit 60&amp;nbsp;home runs in one season (1927), a mark first eclipsed by [[Roger Maris]] in 1961 with 61. Ruth's lifetime record of 714&amp;nbsp;home runs stood until 1974 when it was surpassed by [[Hank Aaron]]. Unlike many power hitters, Ruth also hit for a high [[batting average]]: his .342 lifetime average is the tenth highest in baseball history, and in one season (1923) he batted .393, a Yankee record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Official New York Yankees/Major League Baseball Records|url = http://mlb.mlb.com/nyy/history/season_records.jsp|publisher = MLB.Com|accessdate =August 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth dominated the era in which he played. He led the league in home runs during a season twelve times, slugging percentage and OPS thirteen times each, runs scored eight times, and RBIs six times. Each of those totals represents a modern record.&lt;ref name=brleaders&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/leaders_most_times.shtml |title=Most Times Leading League |publisher=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] |accessdate=October 22, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080924130248/http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/leaders_most_times.shtml| archivedate= September 24, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth is credited with changing baseball itself. The popularity of the game exploded in the 1920s, largely due to his influence. Ruth ushered in the &quot;[[live-ball era]]&quot;, as his big swing led to escalating home run totals that not only excited fans, but helped baseball evolve from a low-scoring, speed-dominated game to a high-scoring power game. He has since become regarded as one of the greatest sports heroes in [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbio&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761556917/babe_ruth.html|title=Babe Ruth|encyclopedia=[[Encarta]]|publisher=[[MSN.com]] |accessdate=October 22, 2008 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwKvQarW |archivedate=October 31, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth's legendary power and charismatic personality made him a larger than life figure in the &quot;[[Roaring Twenties]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=baseballsport&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseballsport.org/babe-ruth/|title=Baseball Sport – Babe Ruth |publisher=Baseballsport.com |accessdate=October 22, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081121140100/http://www.baseballsport.org/babe-ruth/| archivedate= November 21, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to [[ESPN]], he was the first true American sports celebrity superstar whose fame transcended baseball.&lt;ref name=sportscentury&gt;{{cite web|first=Larry|last=Schwartz| title = Loveable Ruth was Everyone's Babe | url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016451.html |publisher=ESPN| accessdate =November 28, 2007 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071221071249/http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016451.html| archivedate= December 21, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Off the field he was famous for his charity, but also was noted for his often reckless lifestyle.

Ruth has been named the greatest baseball player of all time in various surveys and rankings. In 1998, ''[[The Sporting News]]'' ranked him number one on the list of &quot;Baseball's 100 Greatest Players&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The Sporting News list of Baseball's Greatest Players&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, baseball fans named Ruth to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=All-Century Team final voting|publisher=ESPN. Associated Press|date=October 23, 1999|url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/news/1999/1023/129008.html|accessdate=May 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1969, he was named baseball's Greatest Player Ever in a ballot commemorating the 100th anniversary of professional baseball. In 1993, the [[Associated Press]] reported that [[Muhammad Ali]] was tied with Babe Ruth as the most recognized athletes in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Retton, Hammill most popular American athletes|last=Wilstein|first=Steve|agency=Associated Press|date=May 17, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1999 ESPN poll, he was ranked as the third-greatest U.S. athlete of the century, behind [[Michael Jordan]] and Muhammad Ali.&lt;ref name=baseballsport/&gt;

==Early years==
Ruth was born at 216 Emory Street in [[Pigtown, Baltimore|Pigtown]], a rough neighborhood of [[Baltimore]], Maryland. Ruth's [[German-American]] parents, Kate Schamberger-Ruth and George Herman Ruth, Sr., owned a succession of [[Bar (establishment)|saloons]] and sold [[lightning rod]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;otherprioritybook&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Life that Ruth Built|author=Marshall Smelser|publisher=Quadrangle/New York Times Book Co|isbn=0-8129-0540-7|pages=5–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one of Ruth's seven siblings, his sister Mamie, survived past infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Smelser: pp. 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RuthStMary's.jpg|thumb|left|Ruth (top row, far left) at St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1912]]

Not much is known about Ruth's early childhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;prioritybook&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Life and times of Babe Ruth|author=Leigh Montville|publisher=DoubleDay Books|isbn=978-0-385-51437-8|pages=7–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was constantly ill (she later died of [[tuberculosis]] while Ruth was still a teenager).&lt;ref&gt;Smelser: pp. 7, 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth later described his early life as &quot;rough.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Montville p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; When he was seven years old, his father sent him to St. Mary's Industrial School for Boys, a [[reformatory]] and [[orphanage]], and signed custody over to the Catholic [[missionary|missionaries]] who ran the school (the site of St. Mary's was occupied by [[Cardinal Gibbons School]]).&lt;ref&gt;Montville: pp. 7–9.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth remained at St. Mary's for the next 12 years, visiting with his family only for special occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Smelser: p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Brother Matthias Boutlier, the Head of Discipline at St. Mary's, first introduced Ruth to the game of baseball.&lt;ref&gt;Montville pp. 24–26.&lt;/ref&gt; He became a father figure in Ruth's life, teaching him how to read and write, and worked with Ruth on hitting, fielding, and, as his skills progressed, pitching.&lt;ref&gt;Smelser pp. 14–15.&lt;/ref&gt; During his time in St. Mary's, Ruth was also taught tailoring, becoming a qualified shirtmaker, and was a part of both the school band and the drama club.&lt;ref&gt;Smelser: pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltimore Orioles===
In 1913, St. Mary's Industrial School was playing a game against [[Mount St. Mary's University]] (then college) in [[Emmitsburg, Maryland]]. That day, the game was attended by [[Joe Engel]], a former Mount St. Mary's student who was then a pitcher for the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]].&lt;ref&gt;Montville pp. 33–34.&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed with Ruth's pitching abilities, Engel, along with a teacher at St. Mary's, Brother Gilbert, brought Ruth to the attention of [[Jack Dunn (baseball)|Jack Dunn]], owner and manager of the then [[Minor League Baseball|minor-league]] [[Baltimore Orioles (minor league)|Baltimore Orioles]]. After watching Ruth pitch in a workout for half an hour, Dunn signed Ruth to a contract for $250 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|250|1913|r=-2}}}} in current dollar terms) a month on February 14, 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Montville pp. 34 – 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Since Ruth was only 19 years old, Dunn had to become Ruth's [[legal guardian]] as well; at that time, the [[age of majority]] was 21.{{citation needed|date=September 2010}} When the other players on the Orioles caught sight of Ruth, they nicknamed him &quot;Jack Dunn's baby&quot;.&lt;ref name=rotohog&gt;{{cite web|url=http://community.rotohog.com/columnists/professional-athletes-and-name-changes|title=Professional Athletes and Name Changes|publisher=[[RotoHog]].com|accessdate=October 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reference stayed with Ruth the rest of his life, and he was most commonly referred to as Babe Ruth from then on.&lt;ref name=&quot;baberuth.com/biography&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Ruth biography | url=http://www.baberuth.com/flash/about/biograph.html | accessdate =October 24, 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061004174314/http://www.baberuth.com/flash/about/biograph.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = October 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Babe&quot; was not a unique nickname (see e.g., [[Babe Adams]]). His teammates eschewed the public nickname &quot;Babe&quot;, and instead called him &quot;George&quot;; or &quot;Jidge&quot; (a nickname for George); or &quot;The Big Fellow&quot;; or just &quot;Bam&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Leigh Montville, ''The Big Bam'', 2006, Random House, p.310&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7, 1914, Dunn offered to trade Ruth, along with [[Ernie Shore]] and [[Ben Egan]], to [[Connie Mack (baseball)|Connie Mack]] of the [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]]. Dunn asked $10,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000|1914|r=-4}}}} in current dollar terms) for the trio, but Mack refused the offer.&lt;ref name=&quot;suspended&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Young Babe Ruth: His Early Life and Baseball Career, from the Memoirs of a Xaverian Brother|author=Harry Rothgerber|publisher=McFarland|isbn=0-7864-0652-6 |pages=106–108}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cincinnati Reds]], who had an agreement with the Orioles, also passed on Ruth.

==Major League career==

===Boston Red Sox (1914–1919)===
[[File:Babe Ruth pitching.jpg|thumb|upright|Ruth pitching for the Red Sox at [[Comiskey Park]] in Chicago in 1914.]]
Ruth appeared in five games for the Red Sox in 1914, pitching in four of them. He picked up the victory in his major league debut on July 11.&lt;ref name=bleachreport&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/65041-a-tribute-tobabe-ruth|title=A Tribute To...Babe Ruth|publisher=bleacherreport.com|accessdate=October 22, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081006054032/http://bleacherreport.com/articles/65041-a-tribute-tobabe-ruth| archivedate= October 06, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Sox had many star players in 1914, so Ruth was soon optioned to the minor league [[Providence Grays (minor league)|Providence Grays]] of [[Providence, Rhode Island]] for most of the remaining season. Behind Ruth and [[Carl Mays]], the Grays won the [[International League]] pennant.&lt;ref name=worldathletes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldathletes.com/sports_biographies/Babe_Ruth.htm|title=Famous and historical sports figures|publisher=worldathletes.com|accessdate=October 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the season, in which he had finished with a 2–1 record, Ruth proposed to Helen Woodford, a waitress whom he had met in Boston. They were married in [[Ellicott City, Maryland]], on October 17, 1914.&lt;ref name=worldathletes/&gt;

During spring training in 1915, Ruth secured a spot in the Red Sox' starting rotation. He joined a pitching staff that included [[Rube Foster (AL pitcher)|Rube Foster]], [[Dutch Leonard (left-handed pitcher)|Dutch Leonard]], and [[Smokey Joe Wood]]. Ruth won 18 games,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Creamer |first=Robert W. |authorlink=Robert Creamer |title=1900–1929 |edition=1st |series=SportsCentury|year=1999 |publisher=Rare Air Media|location=Chicago|isbn=1-892866-08-0|page=28 |chapter=Babe Ruth: Living Large}}&lt;/ref&gt; lost eight, and helped himself by hitting .315. He also hit his first four home runs. The Red Sox won 101 games that year on their way to a victory in the [[World Series]]. Ruth did not pitch in the series, and grounded out in his only at-bat.&lt;ref name=baseballsport/&gt;

In 1916, after a slightly shaky spring, he went 23–12, with a 1.75 ERA and nine shutouts, both of which led the league. On June 27, he struck out ten Philadelphia A's, a career high. On July 11, he started both games of a doubleheader, but the feat was not what it seemed; he pitched only one third of an inning in the opener because the scheduled starter, Foster, had trouble getting loose. Ruth then pitched a complete-game victory in the nightcap. Ruth had unusual success against [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]] star pitcher [[Walter Johnson]], beating him four times in 1916 alone, by scores of 5–1, 1–0, 1–0 in 13 innings, and 2–1. Johnson finally outlasted Ruth for an extra-inning 4–3 victory on September 12; in the years to come, Ruth would hit ten home runs off Johnson, including the only two Johnson would allow in 1918–1919. Ruth's nine shutouts in 1916 set an AL record for left-handers which would remain unmatched until [[Ron Guidry]] tied it in 1978.

Despite a weak offense, hurt by the sale of [[Tris Speaker]] to the [[Cleveland Indians|Indians]], the Red Sox made it to the World Series. They defeated the [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Brooklyn Robins]] four games to one. This time Ruth made a major contribution, pitching a 14-inning complete-game victory in Game Two.

[[File:Babe Ruth Red Sox 1918.jpg|thumb|left|Ruth in 1918, his next to last year with the Red Sox]]
Ruth went 24–13 with a 2.01 ERA and six shutouts in 1917, and hit .325. But the Sox finished second in the league, nine games behind the [[Chicago White Sox]]. Ruth was involved in a combined [[no-hitter]] that year. On June 23 against the [[Minnesota Twins|Washington Senators]], after walking the leadoff hitter, Ruth erupted in anger, was ejected, and threw a punch at the [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]], which would result in a ten-game suspension. [[Ernie Shore]] came in to replace Ruth and retired all twenty-six batters he faced, for which he was credited with a [[perfect game]] until the 1990s. Ruth's outburst was an example of self-discipline problems that plagued Ruth throughout his career, and is regarded as the primary reason (other than financial) that then-owner [[Harry Frazee]] was willing to sell him to the Yankees two years later.

The left-hander was pitching a no-hitter in a 0–0 game against the Detroit Tigers on July 11, before a single deflected off his glove in the eighth inning. Boston finally pushed across a run in the ninth, and Ruth held onto his 1–0 victory by striking out [[Ty Cobb]]. In 1942, Ruth called this game his greatest thrill on the field.

In 1918, Ruth pitched in 20 games, posting a 13–7 record with a 2.22 ERA. He was mostly used as an outfielder, and hit a league-leading eleven home runs. His statistics were curtailed slightly when he walked off the team in July following an argument with Boston's manager.

Ruth threw a 1–0 shutout in the opener of the [[1918 World Series]], then won Game Four in what would be his final World Series appearance as a pitcher. Ruth won both his starts, allowing two runs (both earned) in seventeen innings for an ERA of 1.06. Ruth extended his World Series consecutive scoreless inning streak to 29⅔ innings, a record that would last until [[Whitey Ford]] broke it in 1961.

====Emergence as a hitter====
In the years 1915–1917, Ruth had been used in just 44 games in which he had not pitched. After the 1917 season, in which he hit .325, albeit with limited at bats, teammate [[Harry Hooper]] suggested that Ruth might be more valuable in the lineup as an everyday player.

In 1918, he began playing in the outfield more and pitching less, making 75 hitting-only appearances. Former teammate [[Tris Speaker]] speculated that the move would shorten Ruth's career, though Ruth himself wanted to hit more and pitch less. In 1918, Ruth batted .300 and led the A.L. in home runs with eleven despite having only 317 at-bats, well below the total for an everyday player.

During the 1919 season, Ruth pitched in only 17 of his 130 games. He also set his first single-season home run record that year with 29 (passing [[Ned Williamson]]'s 27 in 1884), including a game-winning homer on a September &quot;Babe Ruth Day&quot; promotion. It was Babe Ruth's last season with the Red Sox.

===Sold to New York===
[[File:Ruth1920.jpg|upright|thumb|Ruth during the season he joined the [[New York Yankees|Yankees]] in 1920.]]

Popular legend has it that Frazee sold Ruth and several other of his best players to finance a Broadway play, ''[[No, No, Nanette]]'' (which, though it actually did not debut until 1925, did have origins in a December 1919 play, ''My Lady Friends'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Leigh|last=Montville|title=The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth|publisher=Random House|year=2006|pages=161–64}}&lt;/ref&gt; The truth is not so simple, as Frazee had another financial concern: Babe Ruth.

After the 1919 season, Ruth demanded a raise to $20,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|20000|1920|r=-4}}}} in current dollar terms)—double his previous salary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruth Demands $20,000.; Business Manager Says Home-Run King Has Returned Contract.|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 25, 1919|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Frazee refused, and Ruth responded by letting it be known he would not play until he got his raise, suggesting that he might retire to undertake other profitable ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruth Talks of Retiring; Can Make More Money Outside of Baseball, Says Home-Run King.|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 27, 1919|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frazee finally lost patience with Ruth, and decided to trade him. However, he was effectively limited to two trading partners—the [[Chicago White Sox]] and the then-moribund Yankees. The other five clubs rejected his deals out of hand under pressure from American League president [[Ban Johnson]], who had never liked Frazee and was actively trying to remove him from ownership of the Red Sox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Frazee to Answer Johnson's Threat; Boston Owner Is Expected to Resent Proposal to Sell His Club. Feud Will Reach Climax, Issue May Renew Fight for Oneman Commission for the Two Major Leagues|newspaper=New York Times|date=December 16, 1918|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The White Sox offered [[Shoeless Joe Jackson]] and $60,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|60000|1920|r=-4}}}} in current dollar terms), but Yankees owners [[Jacob Ruppert]] and [[Tillinghast L'Hommedieu Huston]] offered an all-cash deal—$100,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|100000|1920|r=-4}}}} in current dollar terms).

Frazee, Ruppert and Huston quickly agreed to a deal. In exchange for Ruth, the Red Sox would get $125,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|.125000|1920|r=2}}}} million in current dollar terms) in cash and three $25,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|25000|1920|r=-4}}}} in current dollar terms) notes payable every year at 6 percent interest. Ruppert and Huston also loaned Frazee $300,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|.300000|1920|r=2}}}} million in current dollar terms), with the mortgage on [[Fenway Park]] as collateral. The deal was contingent on Ruth signing a new contract, which was quickly agreed to, and Ruth officially became property of the Yankees on December 26. The deal was announced ten days later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Year1920&quot;/&gt;

In the January 6, 1920, edition of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', Frazee described the transaction:{{quote|I should have preferred to take players in exchange for Ruth, but no club could have given me the equivalent in men without wrecking itself, and so the deal had to be made on a cash basis. No other club could afford to give me the amount the Yankees have paid for him, and I don't mind saying I think they are taking a gamble. With this money the Boston club can now go into the market and buy other players and have a stronger and better team in all respects than we would have had if Ruth had remained with us.}}

However, the January 6, 1920, ''The New York Times'' was more prescient:{{quote|The short right field wall at the [[Polo Grounds]] should prove an easy target for Ruth next season and, playing seventy-seven games at home, it would not be surprising if Ruth surpassed his home run record of twenty-nine circuit clouts next Summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Year1920&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruth Bought By New York Americans For $125,000, Highest Price In Baseball Annals|work=The New York Times|date=January 6, 1920|accessdate=March 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===New York Yankees (1920–1934)===

====1920–1925====
After moving to the Yankees, Ruth's transition from a pitcher to a power-hitting outfielder became complete. In his fifteen year Yankee career, consisting of over 2,000 games, Ruth re-wrote the record books in terms of his hitting achievements, while making only five widely scattered token appearances on the mound, winning all of them.

[[File:Ruth1921.jpg|thumb|left|Babe Ruth in 1921.]]
In 1920, his first year with the Yankees, Ruth hit 54 home runs and batted .376. His .847 slugging average was a Major League record until 2001. Aside from the Yankees, only the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] managed to hit more home runs as a team than Ruth did as an individual, slugging 64 in hitter-friendly [[Baker Bowl]].

In 1921, Ruth improved to arguably the best year of his career, hitting 59 home runs, batting .378 and slugging .846 (the highest with 500+ at-bats in an [[MLB]] season) while leading the Yankees to their first league championship. On July 18, 1921, Babe Ruth hit career home run No. 139, breaking [[Roger Connor]]'s record of 138 in just the eighth year of his career. (This was not recognized at the time, as Connor's correct career total was not accurately documented until the 1970s. Even if the record had been celebrated, it would have been on an earlier date, as Connor's total was at one time thought to be only 131.)

Ruth's name quickly became synonymous with the home run, as he led the transformation of baseball strategy from the &quot;inside game&quot; to the &quot;power game&quot;, and because of the style and manner in which he hit them. His ability to drive many of his home runs in the 450–500&amp;nbsp;foot range and beyond resulted in the lasting adjective &quot;[[wikt:Ruthian|Ruthian]]&quot;, to describe any long home run hit by any player. Probably his deepest hit in official game play (and perhaps the longest home run by ''any'' player), occurred on July 18, at Detroit's [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Navin Field]], in which he hit one to straightaway center, over the wall of the then-single-deck bleachers, and to the intersection, some {{convert|575|ft|m}} from home plate.

As impressive as Ruth's 1921 numbers were, they could have been more so under modern conditions. Bill Jenkinson's 2006 book, ''[[The Year Babe Ruth Hit 104 Home Runs]]'', attempts to examine each of Ruth's 714 career home runs, plus several hundred long inside-the-park drives and &quot;fair-foul&quot; balls. Until 1931 in the AL, balls that hit the [[foul ball|foul pole]] were considered [[ground-rule double]]s, and balls that went over the wall in fair territory but hooked foul were ruled foul. Many fields, including Ruth's home [[Polo Grounds]], had exceptionally deep center fields; in the Polo Grounds' case, nearly five hundred feet. The author concluded that Ruth would have been credited with 104 home runs in 1921, if modern rules and field dimensions were in place. However, these claims ignore the extreme short distances down the left and right field lines, which were 279 and 258 feet respectively. In addition, the 21-foot overhang in left field often intercepted fly balls which would otherwise have been catchable and turned them into home runs. In any case, Ruth set major league records in total bases (457), extra base hits (119) and times on base (379), all of which stand to this day.

The Yankees had high expectations when they met the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] in the [[1921 World Series]], and the Yankees won the first two games with Ruth in the lineup. However, Ruth badly scraped his elbow during Game 2, sliding into third base (he had walked and stolen both second and third). After the game, he was told by the team physician not to play the rest of the series. Although he did play in Games 3, 4 and 5, and pinch-hit in Game 8 of the best-of-9 Series, his productivity was diminished, and the Yankees lost the series. Ruth hit .316, drove in five runs and hit his first World Series home run. (Although the Yankees won the fifth game, Ruth wrenched his knee and did not return to the Series until the eighth [last] game.)

Ruth's appearance in the 1921 World Series also led to a problem and triggered another disciplinary action. After the series, Ruth played in a [[barnstorm (athletics)|barnstorming]] tour. A rule then in force prohibited World Series participants from playing in exhibition games during the off-season, the purpose being to prevent Series participants from &quot;restaging&quot; the Series and undermining its value. [[Baseball Commissioner]] [[Kenesaw Mountain Landis]] suspended Ruth for the first six weeks of the 1922 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levitt|first=Daniel R.|title=Ed Barrow: The Bulldog Who Built the Yankees' First Dynasty|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=2008|isbn=0-8032-2974-7|page=194}}&lt;/ref&gt; Landis had made his point about adhering to the letter of the rules, but he also recognized that the rule was no longer needed, and rescinded it.

Despite his suspension, Ruth was named the Yankees' new on-field captain prior to the [[1922 New York Yankees season|1922 season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9D07EFD71F30EE3ABC4D52DFB5668389639EDE|title=Ruth Made Captain; Roth Is Suspended; Babe Chosen to Fill Vacancy Caused by Transfer of Peckinpaugh to Boston.

Despite Ruth's off-year, Yankees managed to win the pennant to face the New York Giants for the second straight year in the World Series. In the series, Giants manager John McGraw instructed his pitchers to throw Ruth nothing but curveballs, and Ruth never adjusted. Ruth had just two hits in seventeen at-bats, and the Yankees lost to the Giants for the second straight year by 4–0 (with one tie game).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10E10FC38551A738DDDA90994D8415B828EF1D3|title=HUGGINS MAY STAY AS YANKS' MANAGER; Present Leader Can Keep Position if He Wants It, Declares Colonel Ruppert.

In 1923, the Yankees moved from the [[Polo Grounds]], where they had sublet from the Giants, to their new [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], which was quickly dubbed &quot;The House That Ruth Built&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=9OwZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PyIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5849,3821321&amp;dq=the-house-that-ruth-built|title=The Sport Parade|author=Henry McLemore|work=The Milwaukee Journal|date=April 20, 1934|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth hit the stadium's first home run on the way to a Yankees victory over the Red Sox. Ruth finished the 1923 season with a career-high .393 batting average and major-league leading 41 home runs. For the third straight year, the Yankees faced the Giants in the World Series. Rebounding from his struggles in the previous two World Series, Ruth dominated the 1923 World Series. He batted .368, walked eight times, scored eight runs, hit three home runs and slugged 1.000 during the series, as the Yankees won their first World Series title, four games to two.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FA0B16FB3D5B12738DDDAF0894DF405B848EF1D3 “Yanks Break Even and Fail To Advance; Drop Second Game to Senators, 7–2, After Pennock Pitches Shut-Out in First, 2–0.”], ''The New York Times'', July 6, 1924.

Ruth narrowly missed winning the Triple Crown in 1924. He hit .378 for his only American League batting title, led the major leagues with 46 home runs, and batted in 121 runs to finish second to [[Goose Goslin]]'s 129. Ruth's on-base percentage was .513, the fourth of five years in which his OBP exceeded .500. However, the Yankees finished second, two games behind the Washington Senators, who went on to win their only World Series while based in D.C. During that same year, Ruth served in the New York National Guard 104th Field Artillery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shorpy.com/node/1912|title=The Babe in Uniform: 1924|date=November 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Babe Ruth Enlists in the National Guard|url=http://ghostsofdc.org/2012/02/01/babe-ruth-enlists-in-the-national-guard/|publisher=Ghosts of DC|accessdate=February 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During spring training in 1925 Ruth's ailment was dubbed &quot;the bellyache heard round the world&quot;, when one writer wrote that Ruth's illness was caused by bingeing on hot dogs and soda pop before a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyherald.com/story/?id=233980|title=Freak sports injuries: Now that's a bad break!|work=Daily Herald|author=Robert McCoppin|date=September 11, 2008|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venereal disease and alcohol poisoning (caused by tainted liquor, a major health problem during the [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]]) have also been speculated to be the causes of his illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=24cLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=WFYDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5396,5306128|title='Pistol' fires airball|work=The Victoria Advocate|author=Douglas Rowe|date=August 25, 1991|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the exact nature of his ailment has never been confirmed and remains a mystery. Playing just 98 games, Ruth had what would be his worst season as a Yankee as he finished the season with a .290 average and 25 home runs. The Yankees team finished next to last in the American League with a 69–85 mark, their last season with a losing record until 1965.

====1926–1928====
Babe Ruth performed at a much higher level during 1926, batting .372 with 47 home runs and 146 RBIs. The Yankees won the AL pennant and advanced to the World Series, where they were defeated by [[Rogers Hornsby]] and the [[St. Louis Cardinals]] in seven games. In Game 4, he hit three home runs, the first time any player achieved this in a World Series game. Despite his batting heroics, he is also remembered for a costly base running blunder. Ruth had a reputation as a good but overaggressive base runner (he had 123 stolen bases, including ten steals of home, but only a 51% career percentage). With two outs in the bottom of the ninth inning of the decisive seventh game and with the Yankees trailing 3–2, Ruth tried to steal second base. However, he was thrown out by ten feet, ending the game and the Series. (Yankee team president [[Ed Barrow]] later called this the only on-field boner Ruth ever made in his career.) This remains the only time that the final out of a World Series was a &quot;caught stealing&quot;.

The 1926 series was also known for Ruth's promise to [[Johnny Sylvester]], a seriously ill 11-year-old, that he would hit a home run on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Robert McG., Jr. [http://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/11/obituaries/johnny-sylvester-the-inspiration-for-babe-ruth-heroics-is-dead.html &quot;Johnny Sylvester, the Inspiration For Babe Ruth Heroics, Is Dead&quot;], ''The New York Times'', January 11, 1990. Retrieved June 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth was the leader of the famous 1927 Yankees, also known as [[Murderer's Row]] because of the strength of its hitting lineup. The team won a then AL-record 110 games, a mark for a 154-game season surpassed by the 1954 Cleveland Indians (the 2001 [[Seattle Mariners]] now hold the record with 116 wins, though they played eight more games), took the AL pennant by 19 games, and swept the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in the World Series.

With the race long since decided, the nation's attention turned to Ruth's pursuit of his own home run mark of 59. Early in the season, Ruth expressed doubts about his chances: &quot;I don't suppose I'll ever break that 1921 record. To do that, you've got to start early, and the pitchers have got to pitch to you. I don't start early, and the pitchers haven't really pitched to me in four seasons. I get more bad balls to hit than any other six men...and fewer good ones.&quot; Ruth was also being challenged for his slugger's crown by teammate [[Lou Gehrig]], who nudged ahead of Ruth's total in midseason, prompting the ''[[New York World-Telegram]]'' to anoint Gehrig the favorite. But Ruth caught Gehrig (who would finish with 47), and then had a remarkable last leg of the season, hitting 17 home runs in September. His 60th came on September 30, in the Yankees' next-to-last game. Ruth was exultant, shouting after the game, &quot;Sixty, count 'em, sixty! Let's see some son-of-a-bitch match that!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/al/yankees/2008-07-10-top-10-games_N.htm |title=Top 10 games in Yankee Stadium's rich history |author=Devin Clancy |work=USA Today |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In later years, he would give Gehrig some credit: &quot;Pitchers began pitching to me because if they passed me they still had Lou to contend with.&quot; In addition to his career-high 60 home runs, Ruth batted .356, drove in 164 runs and slugged .772.

[[File:1927NYYankees5.jpg|frame|left|The 1927 New York Yankees, one of the greatest baseball teams of all-time (Ruth is on top row, fifth from the left.)]]

The following [[1928 in sports|season]] started off well for the Yankees, who led the AL by 13 games in July. But the Yankees were soon plagued by some key injuries, erratic pitching and inconsistent play. The [[Philadelphia Athletics]], rebuilding after some lean years, erased the Yankees' big lead and even took over first place briefly in early September. The Yankees, however, took over first place for good when they beat the A's three out of four games in a pivotal series at Yankee Stadium later that month.

Ruth's play in 1928 mirrored his team's performance. He got off to a hot start and on August 1, he had 42 home runs. This put him ahead of his 60 home run pace from the previous season. But Ruth was hobbled by a bad ankle the latter part of the season, and he hit just twelve home runs in the last two months of the regular season. His batting average also fell to .323, well below his career average. Nevertheless, he ended the season with 54 home runs, which would be the fourth (and last) time he hit 50 home runs in a season.
[[File:Babe Ruth &amp; Lou Gehrig at West Point 1927.jpg|thumb|Babe Ruth and [[Lou Gehrig]] at [[West Point, New York]] in 1927.]]

The Yankees had a [[1928 World Series]] rematch with the St. Louis Cardinals, who had upset them in the 1926 series. The Cardinals had the same core players as the 1926 team, except for [[Rogers Hornsby]], who was traded for [[Frankie Frisch]] after the 1926 season. Ruth batted .625 (the second highest average in World Series history), including another three-home run game (in game 4), Gehrig batted .545, and the Yankees demolished the Cardinals in four games. The Yankees thus became the first major league team to sweep their opponents in consecutive World Series.

====Decline and end with Yankees====
In 1929, the Yankees failed to make the World Series for the first time in four years, and it would be another three years before they returned. Although the Yankees had slipped, Ruth led or tied for the league lead in home runs each year during 1929–1931. At one point during the 1930 season, as a stunt, Ruth was called upon to pitch for the first time since 1921, and he pitched a complete-game victory. (He had often pitched in exhibitions in the intervening years.)

Also in 1929, the Yankees became the first team to use uniform numbers regularly (the [[Cleveland Indians]] had used them briefly in 1916). Since Ruth normally batted third in the order (ahead of Gehrig), he was assigned number 3 (to Gehrig's 4). The Yankees retired Ruth's number on June 13, 1948; however, it was kept in circulation prior to that.

[[File:Babe Ruth Gov.jpg|thumb|left|Babe Ruth and Al Smith.]]
In 1930, which was not a pennant year for the Yankees, Ruth was asked by a reporter what he thought of his yearly salary of $80,000 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|.080000|1930|r=2}}}} million in current dollar terms) being more than President [[Herbert Hoover|Hoover's]] $75,000. His response: &quot;I know, but I had a better year than Hoover.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52356-2004Sep26.html|title=Just a Little History|work=Washington Post|author=Norman Chad|date=September 27, 2004|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; That quote has also been rendered as, &quot;How many home runs did ''he'' hit last year?&quot; (Ruth had supported [[Al Smith]] in the 1928 Presidential election, and snubbed an appearance with president Hoover.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=http://books.google.com/?id=edUHzkxaA2gC&amp;pg=PA453&amp;lpg=PA453&amp;dq=babe+ruth+al+smith#v=onepage&amp;q=babe%20ruth%20al%20smith&amp;f=false| title=The big bam: the life and times of Babe Ruth| author=Leigh Montville| publisher=Random House, Inc.| year= 2006| isbn= 978-0-7393-2641-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/71989177/Getty-Images-Sport |title=Babe Ruth Votes for Al Smith (1928 campaign photo) |publisher=Getty Images |accessdate=September 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lelands.com/Auction/AuctionDetailed/37454 |title=Lot 514.

In the 1932 season, the Yankees went 107–47 and won the pennant under manager [[Joe McCarthy (manager)|Joe McCarthy]], as Ruth hit .341, with 41 home runs and 137 RBIs.

The Yankees faced [[Gabby Hartnett]]'s [[Chicago Cubs]] in the [[1932 World Series]]. The Yankees swept the Cubs and batted .313 as a team. During Game 3 of the series, after having already homered, Ruth hit what has now become known as [[Babe Ruth's Called Shot]]. During the at-bat, Ruth supposedly gestured to the deepest part of the park in center-field, predicting a home run. The ball he hit traveled past the flagpole to the right of the scoreboard and ended up in temporary bleachers just outside [[Wrigley Field]]'s outer wall. The center field corner was 440&amp;nbsp;feet away, and at age 37, Ruth had hit a straightaway center home run that was perhaps a 490&amp;nbsp;foot blow.&lt;ref&gt;as per Bill Jenkinson's book&lt;/ref&gt; It was Ruth's last Series homer (and his last Series hit), and it became one of the legendary moments of baseball history.

Ruth remained productive in 1933, as he batted .301, with 34 home runs, 103 RBIs, and a league-leading 114 walks. Elected to play in the first [[All-Star]] game, he hit the first home run in the game's history on July 6, 1933, at [[Comiskey Park]] in Chicago. His two-run home run helped the AL to a 4–2 victory over the NL, and Ruth made a fine catch in the game. Film footage of his All-Star game home run revealed the 38-year-old Ruth had become noticeably overweight.

Late in the 1933 season, he was called upon to pitch in one game and pitched a complete game victory, his final appearance as a pitcher. For the most part, his Yankee pitching appearances (five in fifteen years) were widely advertised attempts to boost attendance. Despite unremarkable pitching numbers, Ruth had a 5–0 record in those five games, raising his career totals to 94–46.

In 1934, Babe Ruth recorded a .288 average, 22 home runs, and made the All-Star team for the second consecutive year. During the game, Ruth was the first of five consecutive strikeout victims (all of whom were future Hall of Fame players) of Giants pitcher [[Carl Hubbell]], perhaps the most famous pitching feat in All-Star game history. On September 30, 1934, in what turned out to be his last game at Yankee Stadium, Ruth went 0 for 3 in front of only about 2,500 fans. By this time, Ruth had reached a personal milestone of 700 home runs and was about ready to retire.

After the 1934 season, Ruth went on a baseball [[Barnstorm (sports)|barnstorming]] tour in the Far East. Players such as [[Jimmie Foxx]], [[Lefty Gomez]], [[Earl Averill]], [[Charlie Gehringer]], and [[Lou Gehrig]] were among fourteen players who played a series of 22 games, with many of the games played in Japan. Ruth was popular in Japan, as baseball had been popular in Japan for decades. Riding in a motorcade, Ruth was greeted by thousands of cheering Japanese. The tour was considered a great success for further increasing the popularity of [[baseball in Japan]], and in 1936 Japan organized its first professional baseball league.

===Boston Braves (1935)===
By this time, Ruth knew he had little left as a player. His heart was set on managing the Yankees, and he made no secret of his desire to replace McCarthy. However, Ruppert would not consider replacing McCarthy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=M7VRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LWkDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5558,6110848 |title=Ruth to Quit Unless Given Manager Job |first=Jimmy |last=Powers |newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=October 9, 1934 |accessdate=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The slugger and manager had never got along and Ruth's managerial ambitions further chilled their relations. Just before the 1934 season, Ruppert offered to make Ruth manager of the Yankees' top minor-league team, the [[Newark Bears (1926-1949)|Newark Bears]]. However, Ruth's wife, [[Claire Merritt Hodgson]] and business manager advised him to reject the offer.

After the 1934 season, the only teams that seriously considered hiring Ruth were the [[Oakland Athletics|Philadelphia Athletics]] and [[Detroit Tigers]]. A's owner/manager [[Connie Mack (baseball)|Connie Mack]] gave some thought to stepping down as manager in favor of Ruth, but later dropped the idea, saying that Ruth's wife would be running the team in a month if Ruth ever took over. Ruth was in serious negotiations with Tigers owner [[Frank Navin]], but missed a scheduled interview in late 1934. Meanwhile, Ruppert negotiated with other major-league clubs, seeking one that would take Ruth either as a manager or player.

[[Atlanta Braves|Boston Braves]] owner [[Emil Fuchs (baseball)|Emil Fuchs]] finally agreed to take Ruth. Even though the Braves had fielded fairly competitive teams in the last three seasons, Fuchs was sinking in debt and could not afford the rent on [[Braves Field]]. Fuchs thought Ruth was just what the Braves needed, both on and off the field.

After a series of phone calls, letters and meetings, the Yankees traded Ruth to the Braves on February 26, 1935. It was announced that in addition to remaining as a player, Ruth would become team vice president and would be consulted on all club transactions. He was also made assistant manager to Braves skipper [[Bill McKechnie]]. In a long letter to Ruth a few days before the press conference, Fuchs promised Ruth a share in the Braves' profits, with the possibility of becoming co-owner of the team. Fuchs also raised the possibility of Ruth becoming the Braves' manager, perhaps as early as 1936.

[[File:Ruth1935.jpg|thumb|upright|Ruth in his Boston Braves uniform during his last year as a player in 1935. Due to years of neglect, Ruth's health had declined considerably, significantly affecting his play.]]

Amid much media hoopla, Ruth played his first home game in Boston in over 16 years. Before an opening-day crowd of over 25,000, Ruth accounted for all of the Braves' runs in a 4–2 defeat of the [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]]. The Braves had long played second fiddle to the Red Sox in Boston, but Ruth's arrival spiked interest in the Braves to levels not seen since their stunning win in the [[1914 World Series]].

That win proved to be the only time the Braves were over .500 that year. By May 20, they were 7–17, and their season was effectively over. While Ruth could still hit, he could do little else, and soon stopped hitting as well. His conditioning had deteriorated so much that he could do little more than trot around the bases. His fielding was dreadful; at one point, three of the Braves' pitchers threatened not to take the mound if Ruth was in the lineup. Ruth was also annoyed that McKechnie ignored most of his managerial advice (McKechnie later said that Ruth's presence made enforcing discipline nearly impossible). He soon discovered that he was vice president and assistant manager in name only, and Fuchs' promise of a share of team profits was also hot air. In fact, Fuchs expected Ruth to invest some of ''his'' money in the team.

On May 25, at [[Forbes Field]] in [[Pittsburgh]], Ruth went 4-for-4, drove in 6 runs and hit 3 home runs in an 11–7 loss to the Pirates. These were the last three home runs of his career. His last home run cleared the roof at the old Forbes Field—he became the first player to accomplish that feat. Five days later, in [[Philadelphia]], Ruth played in his last Major League game. He struck out in the first inning and, while playing the field in the same inning, hurt his knee and left the game. In the 1948 film [[The Babe Ruth Story]] there was a more dramatic recounting of Ruth's last game. The Braves were depicted as winning the game against the Pirates and learning he had been fired for walking off the field during the game, while still in the locker room.

Two days after that, Ruth summoned reporters to the locker room after a game against the Giants and announced he was retiring. He had wanted to retire as early as May 12, but Fuchs persuaded him to stay on because the Braves had not played in every National League park yet. That season, he hit just .181 with six home runs in 72 at-bats. The Braves season went as badly as Ruth's short season. They finished 38–115, the [[List of worst MLB season records|fourth-worst record in Major League history]].

===Retirement and post-playing days===
[[File:Babe Ruth 1937.jpg|thumb|Ruth signing autographs during the [[1937 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] at [[Griffith Stadium]] in 1937.]]
In 1936, Ruth was one of the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 1936|first five players]] elected into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]]. Two years later, [[Larry MacPhail]], the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] general manager, offered him a first base coaching job in June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fMMRAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=eegDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6387,6669658|title=Babe Ruth Returns to Baseball to Act as Coach For Brooklyn|agency=Associated Press|work=Eugene Register-Guard|date=June 19, 1938|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth took the job but quit at the end of the season. The coaching position was his last job in Major League Baseball. His baseball career finally came to an end in 1943. In a charity game at Yankee Stadium, he pinch hit and drew a walk. In 1947, he became director of the [[American Legion]]'s youth baseball program.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/media.do?action=clip&amp;id=v3t6|title=History Channel audio clip of Babe Ruth at Yankee Stadium on April 27, 1947|publisher=History.com|accessdate=October 22, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080423073127/http://www.history.com/media.do?action=clip&amp;id=v3t6 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = April 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Radio and films==
[[File:HeadingHome-BabeRuth1920.jpg|thumb|Screenshot from [[Headin' Home]]]]

Ruth made many forays into various popular media. He was heard often on radio in the 1930s and 1940s, both as a guest and on his own programs with various titles: ''The Adventures of Babe Ruth'' was a 15-minute [[Blue Network]] show heard three times a week from April 16 to July 13, 1934. Three years later, he was on CBS twice a week in ''Here's Babe Ruth'' which was broadcast from April 14 to July 9, 1937. That same year he portrayed himself in &quot;[[Alibi Ike]]&quot; on ''[[Lux Radio Theater]]''. His ''Baseball Quiz'' was first heard Saturdays on NBC June 5 to July 10, 1943 and then later that year from August 28 to November 20 on NBC, followed by another NBC run from July 8 to October 21, 1944.

His film roles included a cameo appearance as himself in the [[Harold Lloyd]] film ''[[Speedy (film)|Speedy]]'' (1928). His first film appearance occurred in 1920, in the [[silent movie]] ''[[Headin' Home]]''. He made numerous other film appearances in the silent era, usually either playing himself or playing a ballplayer similar to himself.

Ruth's voice was said by some biographers to be similar to that of film star [[Clark Gable]], although that was obviously not evident in the silent film era. He had an appropriate role as himself in ''[[Pride of the Yankees]]'' (1942), the story of his ill-fated teammate Lou Gehrig. Ruth had three scenes in the film, including one in which he appeared with a straw hat. He said, &quot;If I see anyone touch it, I'll knock his teeth in!&quot; The teammates convinced young Gehrig ([[Gary Cooper]]) to chew up the hat; he got away with it. In the second scene, the players go to a restaurant, where Babe sees a side of beef cooking and jokes, &quot;Well, I'll have one of those...&quot; and, the dramatic scene near the end, where Gehrig makes his speech at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] ending with &quot;I consider myself the luckiest man...&quot;

Ruth had two daughters. [[Dorothy Ruth]] was adopted by Babe and Helen. In her book, ''My Dad, the Babe'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pirone|first=Dorothy|coauthors=Chris Martens|title=My Dad, The Babe: Growing up with an American Hero |year=1988|publisher=Quinlan Press|location=Boston|isbn=1-55770-031-1 |oclc=17652057|page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dorothy claimed that she was Ruth's biological child by a girlfriend named Juanita Jennings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1DC173EF933A15756C0A96F948260 |title=NY times story |work=New York Times |date=May 20, 1989 |accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baseballguru.com/omi/ruthandhiswomen.htm |title=baseballguru.com |publisher=baseballguru.com |accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dorothy obit&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE1DC173EF933A15756C0A96F948260 |title= Dorothy R.

Ruth adopted Julia Hodgson when he married her mother, actress and model [[Claire Merritt Hodgson]]. Julia Ruth Stevens currently resides in Arizona, and threw out the ceremonial first pitch before the final game in the original Yankee Stadium on September 21, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wiessner |first=Christian |title=Baseball says goodbye as Yankee Stadium retired |date=September 22, 2008 |agency=Reuters |publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2008/09/22/us-baseball-yankeestadium-idUSN1950865620080922 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/634u6KlfD |archivedate=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By one account, Julia and Dorothy were, through no fault of their own, the reason for the seven-year rift in Ruth's relationship with teammate Lou Gehrig. Sometime in 1932 Gehrig's mother, during a conversation which she assumed was private, said, &quot;It's a shame [Claire] doesn't dress Dorothy as nicely as she dresses her own daughter.&quot; When the remark inevitably got back to Ruth, he angrily told Gehrig to tell his mother to mind her own business. Gehrig in turn took offense at what he perceived as Ruth's disrespectful treatment of his mother. The two men reportedly never spoke off the field from that moment until the famous &quot;bear hug&quot; in Yankee Stadium on [[Lou Gehrig Appreciation Day|Lou Gehrig Day]] in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Creamer | first = Robert W. | title = Babe: The Legend Comes to Life | year = 2011 | publisher = Simon &amp; Schuster | location = New York | edition = Kindle | isbn = B0057B7G40 }} Kindle Location 5312-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth and Claire regularly wintered in Florida, frequently playing golf during the off-season and while the Yankees were spring training in [[Tampa, Florida]]. After retirement, he had a winter beachfront home in [[Treasure Island, Florida]], near [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]].

===Baby Ruth candy bar controversy===
For decades, the [[Baby Ruth]] candy bar was believed to be named after Babe Ruth and some sports marketing practitioners used this example of one of the first forms of [[sports marketing]]. However, while the name of the candy bar sounds nearly identical to the Babe's name, the Curtiss Candy Company has steadfastly claimed that Baby Ruth was named after President [[Grover Cleveland]]'s daughter, [[Ruth Cleveland]]. Nonetheless, the bar first appeared in 1921, as Babe Ruth's fame was on the rise and long after Cleveland had left the White House and 15 years after his daughter had died. The company failed to negotiate an endorsement deal with Ruth, and many saw the company's story about the origin of the name of the bar as merely a ploy to avoid having to pay the baseball player any royalties. Ironically, Curtiss successfully shut down a rival bar that was approved by, and named for, Ruth, on the grounds that the names were too similar in the case of George H. Ruth Candy Co. v. Curtiss Candy Co, 49 F.2d 1033 (1931).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/business/names/babyruth.asp |title=Baby Ruth |publisher=snopes.com |accessdate=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports marketing experts now believe that the Curtiss Candy Company employed the first successful use of an [[Ambush marketing|ambush sports marketing]] campaign, capitalizing on the Babe's name, fame and popularity.{{who|date=November 2011}}

The ''New York Times'' supports the evidence of the ambush marketing campaign when it wrote &quot;For 85 years, Babe Ruth, the slugger, and Baby Ruth, the candy bar, have lived parallel lives in which it has been widely assumed that the latter was named for the former. The confection's creator, the Curtiss Candy Company, never admitted to what looks like an obvious connection – especially since Ruth hit 54 home runs the year before the first Baby Ruth was devoured. Had it done so, Curtiss would have had to compensate Ruth. Instead, it eventually insisted the inspiration was &quot;Baby Ruth&quot; Cleveland, the daughter of President Grover Cleveland. But it is an odd connection that makes one wonder at the marketing savvy of Otto Schnering, the company's founder.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes2006&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/06/business/worldbusiness/06iht-web.0606ruth.1900800.html?_r=2 |title=Baseball adopts a candy, whatever it's named for|newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |first=Richard |last=Sandomir |issn=0362-4331 |accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Babe Ruth George Bush.jpg|thumb|upright|Babe Ruth, The Great Bambino, with future U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] at Yale in 1948.]]

Thus, in 1995, a company representing the Ruth estate brought the Baby Ruth candy bar into sponsorship officialdom when it licensed the Babe's name and likeness for use in a Baby Ruth marketing campaign. On page 34 of the spring, 2007, edition of the [[Chicago Cubs]] game program, there is a full-page ad showing a partially unwrapped Baby Ruth in front of the Wrigley ivy, with the caption, &quot;The official candy bar of Major League Baseball, and proud sponsor of the Chicago Cubs.&quot; Continuing the baseball-oriented theme, during the summer and post-season of the 2007 season, a TV ad for the candy bar showed an entire stadium (played by [[Dodger Stadium]]) filled with people munching Baby Ruths, and thus having to hum rather than singing along with &quot;Take Me Out to the Ball Game&quot; during the seventh-inning stretch.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes2006&quot;/&gt;

==Health complications and death==
In 1946, Ruth began experiencing severe pain over his left eye.&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E7DC143FF93AA15751C1A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=The Doctor's World; Ruth's Other Record: Cancer Pioneer|work=New York Times|author=Lawrence K.

He received post-operative radiation therapy. Before leaving the hospital in February 1947, he lost approximately {{convert|80|lbs|kg}}.

Around this time, developments in [[chemotherapy]] offered some hope. Teropterin, a [[folic acid]] derivative, was developed by Dr. Brian Hutchings of the Lederle Laboratories.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt; It had been shown to cause significant remissions in children with [[leukemia]]. Ruth was administered this new drug in June 1947. He was suffering from headaches, hoarseness and had difficulty swallowing. He agreed to use this new medicine but did not want to know any details about it. All the while he was receiving this experimental medication, he did not know it was for cancer. On June 29, 1947, he began receiving injections and he responded with dramatic improvement. He gained over {{convert|20|lbs|kg}} and had resolution of his headaches. On September 6, 1947, his case was presented anonymously at the 4th Annual Internal cancer Research Congress in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. Teropterin ended up being a precursor for [[methotrexate]], a now commonly used chemotherapeutic agent.

It is now known that Ruth suffered from [[nasopharyngeal carcinoma]] (NPCA), a relatively rare tumor located in the back of the nose near the [[eustachian tube]]. Contemporary management for NPCA includes concurrent chemotherapy and [[radiation therapy]].

On April 27, 1947, the Yankees held a ceremony at Yankee Stadium. Despite his health problems, Ruth was able to attend &quot;Babe Ruth Day&quot;.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt; Ruth spoke to a capacity crowd of 58,339,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA194704270.shtml |title=Baseball-Reference.com |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |accessdate=September 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including many American Legion youth baseball players. Although lacking a specific memorable comment like Gehrig's &quot;Luckiest man&quot; speech, Ruth spoke from the heart, of his enthusiasm for the game of baseball and in support of the youth playing the game. (''&lt;span class=&quot;unicode audiolink&quot;&gt;[http://www.history.com/video.do?name=culture&amp;bcpid=1676043212&amp;bclid=1685979173&amp;bctid=1628332710 Babe Ruth speaking at Yankee Stadium]&lt;/span&gt;'')

Later, Ruth started the Babe Ruth Foundation, a charity for disadvantaged children. Another Babe Ruth Day held at Yankee Stadium in September 1947 helped to raise money for this charity.
[[File:2Ruth1948April.jpg|thumb|[[Nat Fein]]'s [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning photograph of Ruth at Yankee Stadium, June 13, 1948. This was his last public appearance before his death two months later.]]

After the cancer returned, Ruth attended the 25th anniversary celebration of the opening of Yankee Stadium on June 13, 1948. He was reunited with old teammates from the 1923 Yankee team and posed for photographs. The photo of Ruth taken from behind, using a bat as a cane, standing apart from the other players, and facing &quot;Ruthville&quot; (right field) became one of baseball's most famous and widely circulated photographs. The photo won the Pulitzer Prize.

[[File:Babe Ruth 800.jpg|thumb|left|The Babe Ruth grave site in Hawthorne, New York.]]

Shortly after he attended the Yankee Stadium anniversary event, Ruth was back in the hospital. He received hundreds of well-wishing letters and messages. This included a phone call from President [[Harry Truman]]. Claire helped him respond to the letters.

On July 26, 1948, Ruth attended the premiere of the film ''[[The Babe Ruth Story]]'', a biopic about his own life. [[William Bendix]] portrayed Ruth. Shortly thereafter, Ruth returned to the hospital for the final time. He was barely able to speak. Ruth's condition gradually became worse, and in his last days, scores of reporters and photographers hovered around the hospital. Only a few visitors were allowed to see him, one of whom was [[National League]] president and future [[Commissioner of Baseball]], [[Ford Frick]]. &quot;Ruth was so thin it was unbelievable. He had been such a big man and his arms were just skinny little bones, and his face was so haggard&quot;, Frick said years later.

On August 16, the day after Frick's visit, Babe Ruth died at age 53 due to [[pneumonia]].&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt; An [[autopsy]] showed the cancer Ruth died from began in the nose and mouth and spread widely throughout his body from there.&lt;ref name=nyt1/&gt; His body lay [[Lying in repose|in repose]] in Yankee Stadium. His funeral was two days later at [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York]]. Ruth was then buried in the [[Cemetery of the Gate of Heaven]] in [[Hawthorne, New York]].
At his death, the New York ''Times'' called Babe Ruth, &quot;a figure unprecedented in American life. A born showman off the field and a marvelous performer on it, he had an amazing flair for doing the spectacular at the most dramatic moment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Babe Ruth, Baseball's Great Star and Idol of Children, Had a Career Both Dramatic and Bizarre |url=http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/0206.html |quote=Probably nowhere in all the imaginative field of fiction could one find a career more dramatic and bizarre than that portrayed in real life by George Herman Ruth. Known the world over, even in foreign lands where baseball is never played, as the Babe, he was the boy who rose from the obscurity of a charitable institution in Baltimore to a position as the leading figure in professional baseball. He was also its greatest drawing-card, its highest salaried performer—at least of his day—and the idol of millions of youngsters throughout the land. |work=New York Times |date=August 17, 1948 |accessdate=July 21, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth's impact on American culture still commands attention.

Ruth was mentioned in the poem ''&quot;[[Line-Up for Yesterday]]&quot;'' by [[Ogden Nash]]:

{{Quote box |width= 18em |border= 4px |align= center |bgcolor= #FAF0E6 |qalign= center | title=''Line-Up for Yesterday''|quote=''R is for Ruth.''&lt;br /&gt;''To tell you the truth,''&lt;br /&gt;''There's just no more to be said,''&lt;br /&gt;''Just R is for Ruth.''
|source= – ''[[Ogden Nash]]'', [[Sport magazine|''Sport'' magazine]] (January 1949)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Baseball Almanac|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_line.shtml|accessdate=October 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

As a sidelight to his prominent role in changing the game to the power game, the frequency and popularity of Ruth's home runs eventually led to a rule change pertaining to those hit in [[Sudden death (sport)#Baseball and softball|sudden-death]] mode (bottom of the ninth or later inning). Prior to 1931, as soon as the first necessary run to win the game scored, the play was over, and the batter was credited only with the number of bases needed to drive in the winning run. Thus, if the score was 3–2 with the bases loaded in the bottom of the ninth, and the batter smacked an &quot;over the fence home run&quot;, the game would end at 4–3, with the batter only allowed a double, and the runners officially stopped on 2nd and 3rd (since they were not needed to win the game). The new rule allowed the entire play to complete, justified on the grounds that the ball was dead and that all runners could freely advance, thus granting the full allotment of HR and RBI to the batter, as we know it today. Several players lost home runs that way, including Ruth. As noted in the inaugural edition of ''The Baseball Encyclopedia'' (MacMillan, 1969), Ruth's career total would have been changed to 715 if historians during the 1960s had been successful in pursuing this matter. Major League Baseball elected not to retrofit the records to the modern rules, and Ruth's total stayed at 714.

Another rules change that affected Ruth was the method used by umpires to judge potential home runs when the batted ball left the field near a foul pole. Before 1931, i.e. through most of Ruth's most productive years, the umpire called the play based on the ball's final resting place &quot;when last seen&quot;. Thus, if a ball went over the fence fair, and curved behind the foul pole, it was ruled foul. Beginning in 1931 and continuing to the present day, the rule was changed to require the umpire to judge based on the point where the ball cleared the fence. Jenkinson's book (p.&amp;nbsp;374–375) lists 78 foul balls near the foul pole in Ruth's career, claiming that at least 50 of them were likely to have been home runs under the modern rule.

Ruth's 1919 contract that sent him from Boston to New York was sold at auction for $996,000 at [[Sotheby's]] on June 10, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2005-06-10-ruth-contract_x.htm|title=Babe Ruth contract sells after 15 minutes of intense bidding|work=USA Today|author=Larry McShane|date=June 10, 2005|accessdate=August 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most valuable [[memorabilia]] item relating to Ruth was a 1920-era Yankees flannel jersey which sold in May 2012 for $4.4 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sportscollectorsdaily.com/babe-ruth-jersey-sells-for-4-1-million-becomes-most-valuable-piece-of-sports-memorabilia-ever/ |title=Babe Ruth Jersey Sells for $4.4 Million; Becomes Most Valuable Piece of Sports Memorabilia Ever|work=Sports Collectors Daily|date=May 21, 2012 |accessdate=July 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the most valuable piece of sports memorabilia ever sold at public auction.

A [[biopic]] of his life, ''[[The Babe]]'', was released in 1992 and starred [[John Goodman]] in the title role. Films have been made featuring Ruth, or a Ruth-like figure (&quot;The Whammer&quot; in ''[[The Natural]]'', for example).
