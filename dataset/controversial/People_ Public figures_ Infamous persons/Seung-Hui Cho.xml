Cho's body is buried in [[Fairfax, Virginia]].
 
Born in South Korea, Cho arrived in the United States at the age of 8 with his family. He became a [[Permanent residence (United States)|US permanent resident]] as a [[South Korean nationality law|South Korean national]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=9642190].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/17/AR2007041700655.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Gunman's Family Had Hard Life in Korea | first=Jae-Soon | last=Chang | accessdate=May 23, 2010 | date=April 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-04-17-virginia-tech_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Va. governor promises probe of shooting | date=April 18, 2007 | accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In middle school, he was diagnosed with a severe [[anxiety disorder]] known as [[selective mutism]], as well as [[major depressive disorder]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roanoke.com/vtinvestigation/wb/wb/xp-130177 The alienation and anger of Seung-hui Cho].&lt;/ref&gt; After this diagnosis he began receiving treatment and continued to receive [[therapy]] and special education support until his junior year of high school. During Cho's last two years at Virginia Tech, several instances of his abnormal behavior, as well as plays and other writings he submitted containing references to violence, caused concern among teachers and classmates.

In the aftermath of the Virginia Tech massacre, [[Governor of Virginia|Virginia Governor]] [[Tim Kaine]] convened a panel consisting of various officials and experts to investigate and examine the response and handling of issues related to the shootings. The panel released its final report in August 2007, devoting more than 30 pages to detailing Cho's troubled history. In the report, the panel criticized the failure of the educators and mental health professionals who came into contact with Cho during his college years to notice his deteriorating condition and help him. The panel also criticized misinterpretations of privacy laws and gaps in Virginia's mental health system and gun laws. In addition, the panel faulted Virginia Tech administrators in particular for failing to take immediate action after the first shootings. Nevertheless, the report did acknowledge that Cho was still primarily responsible for not seeking assistance and for his murderous rampage.&lt;ref name=&quot;vtrpt&quot;&gt;[http://www.governor.virginia.gov/TempContent/techPanelReport.cfm Virginia Tech Review Panel: Mass shootings at Virginia Tech - Report of the Review Panel.] (2007, August).

Cho was eight years old at the time. The family first lived in Maryland, then moved to the [[Washington metropolitan area]] after learning that it had one of the largest Korean communities in the country, particularly in [[Northern Virginia]].

According to Chris Davids, a high school classmate in Cho's [[English studies|English class]] at Westfield High School, Cho looked down and refused to speak when called upon. Davids added that, after one teacher threatened to give Cho a failing grade for not participating in class, he began reading in a strange, deep voice that sounded &quot;like he had something in his mouth.

Cho was transfixed by it. &quot;I remember sitting in Spanish class with him, right next to him, and there being something written on his binder to the effect of, you know, ' 'F' you all, I hope you all burn in hell,' which I would assume meant us, the students,&quot; said Ben Baldwin, a classmate of Cho.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Also, Cho wrote in a school assignment about wanting to &quot;repeat Columbine&quot;.

To address his problems, Cho's parents also took him to church.

The pastor added that, until he saw the video that Cho sent to [[NBC News]], he never heard him say a complete sentence.

Roy described Cho as &quot;an intelligent man,&quot; and stated that he seemed to be an awkward, lonely and insecure student who never took off his sunglasses, even indoors.

After Roy became concerned with Cho's behavior and the themes in his writings, she started meeting with Cho to work with him one-on-one. As Roy worked with Cho, she became concerned for her safety. She told her assistant that, if she uttered the name of a dead professor (which served as a [[duress code]]), the assistant was to call security.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-DeadlyRage&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Kleinfield|first=N.R.|date=April 22, 2007|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/22/us/22vatech.html?pagewanted=print|title=Before deadly rage, a life consumed by a troubling silence|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=April 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Roy notified legal authorities about Cho's behavior, she urged Cho to seek [[counseling]].

Norris noted that, &quot;my guess is that either the information was not accessible to her or it was privileged and could not be released to me.&quot;&lt;ref name=professor&gt;{{cite news |url = http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=3060798|title = English Professor Went to Dean About Killer |date=April 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis told Norris to recommend that Cho seek counseling at the on-campus Cook Counseling Center, which she had already done.&lt;ref name=professor/&gt;

=== Relationship with students ===
Fellow students described Cho as a &quot;quiet&quot; person who &quot;would not respond if someone greeted him.&quot; Student Julie Poole recalled the first day of a literature class the previous year when the students introduced themselves one by one. When it was Cho's turn to introduce himself, he did not speak. According to Poole, the professor looked at the sign-in sheet and found that, whereas everyone else had written out their names, Cho had written only a question mark. Poole added that &quot;we just really knew him as the question mark kid&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6564653.stm |

The young woman was initially unconcerned by Cho's AIM messages and the Shakespearean [[graffiti]] he left on her door board, until she was contacted by Andy Koch via AIM. Koch told her that Cho was involved in an earlier stalking incident and that, &quot;i think he is [[Schizophrenia|schophrenic&quot;]] {{sic}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18332927/ ''Was Va.

Virginia Special Justice Paul Barnett certified in an order that Cho &quot;presented an imminent danger to himself as a result of mental illness,&quot; but instead recommended treatment for Cho as an outpatient.

=== Aftermath ===

==== Crime investigation ====
Through [[ballistics]] examination, law enforcement investigators determined that Cho used the Glock 19 pistol during the attacks at the West Ambler Johnston dormitory and at Norris Hall on the Virginia Tech campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Associated Press | url=http://cbs11tv.com/education/local_story_106164729.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927121232/http://cbs11tv.com/education/local_story_106164729.html | archivedate=September 27, 2007 | title=31 Dead In Virginia Tech Shooting | publisher=[[KTVT|CBS 11]] | date= April 16, 2007 | accessdate = September 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Fantz, A. &amp; O'Connor, A. | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/16/us/16cnd-shooting.html?_r=1&amp;hp&amp;oref=slogin | title=Virginia Tech Shooting Kills at Least 33 | publisher=New York Times | date= April 16, 2007 | accessdate = September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Potter, N., Schoetz, D., Esposito, R. &amp; Thomas, P. | url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=3045574&amp;page=1 | title=Police cite person of interest in Va.

&quot;Investigators also say Cho practiced shooting at a firing range in Roanoke, about 40&amp;nbsp;miles from the campus, in mid-March.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18209746/ | title=Cho prepared in advance for rampage| publisher=MSNBC | date=unknown | accessdate = September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a former FBI agent and ABC consultant, &quot;This was no spur-of-the-moment crime. He's been thinking about this for several months prior to the shooting.&quot;&lt;ref name=firstgun/&gt;

==== Review of Cho's medical records ====
During the investigation, the matter of Cho's court-ordered mental health treatment was also examined to determine its outcome. Virginia investigators learned after a review of Cho's medical records that he never complied with the order for the mandated mental health treatment as an outpatient.&lt;ref name=&quot;mhealthExam&quot;/&gt; The investigators also found that neither the court nor New River Valley Community Services Board exercised oversight of his case to determine his compliance with the order. In response to questions about Cho's case, New River Valley Community Services Board maintained that its facility was never named in the court order as the provider for his mental health treatment, and its responsibility ended once he was discharged from its care after the court order.&lt;ref name=&quot;mhealthExam&quot;/&gt; In addition, Christopher Flynn, director of the Cook Counseling Center at Virginia Tech, mentioned that the court did not notify his office to report that Cho was required to seek outpatient mental health treatment. Flynn added that, &quot;When a court gives a mandatory order that someone get outpatient treatment, that order is to the individual, not an agency&amp;nbsp;... The one responsible for ensuring that the mentally ill person receives help in these sort of cases&amp;nbsp;... is the mentally ill person.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mhealthExam&quot;/&gt;

As a result, Cho escaped compliance with the court order for mandatory mental health treatment as an outpatient, even though Virginia law required community services boards to &quot;recommend a specific course of treatment and programs&quot; for mental health patients and &quot;monitor the person's compliance.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mhealthExam&quot;/&gt; As for the court, Virginia law also mandated that, if a person fails to comply with a court order to seek mental health treatment as an outpatient, that person can be brought back before the court &quot;and if found still in crisis, can be committed to a psychiatric institution for up to 180 days.&quot; Cho was never summoned to court to explain why he had not complied with the December 14, 2005 order for mandatory mental health treatment as an outpatient.&lt;ref name=&quot;mhealthExam&quot;/&gt;

The investigation panel had sought Cho's medical records for several weeks, but due to privacy laws, Virginia Tech was prohibited from releasing them without permission from Cho's family, even after his death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.washingtonpost.com/rawfisher/2007/06/protecting_seunghui_chos_priva.html The Shooter Prevails: Protecting Seung-hui Cho's Privacy] June 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The panel had considered using [[subpoena]]s to obtain his records. On June 12, 2007, Cho's family released his medical records to the panel, although the panel said that the records were not enough.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.mgnetwork.com/imd/VTShooting/article107.htm Cho's Records Given To Investigating Panel] June 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc4.com/news/13502717/detail.html Family Releases Seung-hui Cho's Mental Health Records: Panel Chair: Records Have Not Been Fully Examined] June 14, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The panel obtained additional information by court order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdbj7.com/Global/story.asp?S=6680377&amp;nav=menu368_2 Tech panel obtains records of gunman's mental health hearing] June 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Like the perpetrators of both the [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine]] and [[Jokela school shooting|Jokela]] school massacres, Cho was prescribed the [[antidepressant]] drug [[Prozac]] prior to his rampage, a substance suspected by [[Peter Breggin]] and [[David Healy (psychiatrist)|David Healy]] of leading to suicidal behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.governor.virginia.gov/TempContent/techPanelReport.cfm See Chapter 8 on diagnosis for 'selective mute' disorder]&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is likely that Cho never complied in filling or taking this prescription; the [[toxicology]] test from the official autopsy later showed that neither psychiatric nor any kind of [[illegal drugs]] were in his system during the time of the shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kvoa.com/global/story.asp?s=8945|title=kvoa.com/Global/story.asp?S=6694716&amp;nav=HMO6HMaW&lt;!--INSERT TITLE--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, Cho's family allowed Virginia Tech to release the records, along with those found in July 2009, to the public.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.newsadvance.com/lna/news/state_regional/article/virginia_tech_releases_chos_mental_health_records/18705&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, they were only given to the panel.

==== Investigative panel report ====
In the aftermath of the killing spree, Virginia Governor [[Timothy Kaine]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]) appointed a panel to investigate the campus shootings, with plans for the panel to submit a report of its findings in approximately two to three months. Kaine also invited former [[Department of Homeland Security|Homeland Security]] Secretary [[Tom Ridge]] to join the panel to &quot;review Cho’s mental health history and how police responded to the tragedy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mental health investigation&quot;&gt;Ferguson, B. (April 20, 2007). [http://www.arabnews.com/?page=4&amp;section=0&amp;article=95226&amp;d=20&amp;m=4&amp;y=2007 Killer video haunts campus.] ''Arab News'' (Saudi Arabia). Retrieved on May 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; To help investigate and analyze the emergency response surrounding the Virginia Tech shootings, Kaine hired the same company that investigated the [[Columbine High School massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/24/AR2007042402267.html State taps firm that handled probe of Columbine shootings.] ''The Washington Post''. Retrieved on April 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The panel's final report devoted more than 30 pages to detailing Cho's mental health history. The report criticized Virginia Tech educators, administrators and mental health staff in failing to &quot;connect the dots&quot; from numerous incidents that were warning signs of Cho's mental instability beginning in his junior year. The report concluded that the school's mental health systems &quot;failed for lack of resources, incorrect interpretation of privacy laws, and passivity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;VT panel report&quot;/&gt; The report called Virginia's mental health laws &quot;flawed&quot; and its mental health services &quot;inadequate&quot;. The report also confirmed that Cho was able to purchase two guns in violation of federal law because of Virginia's inadequate background check requirements.&lt;ref name=&quot;VT panel report&quot;/&gt;

During the time period between the two shooting events on April 16, Cho visited a local [[United States Postal Service|post office]] near the Virginia Tech campus where he mailed a parcel with a DVD inside to the New York headquarters of [[NBC News]], which contained video clips, photographs and a manifesto explaining the reasons for his actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wtvd/story?section=news/local&amp;id=5220434|title=Gunman mailed package between shootings}}&lt;/ref&gt; The package, addressed from &quot;[[Ishmael (Moby-Dick)#Description|A.

=== Release of material ===
Upon receiving the package on April 18, 2007, [[NBC]] contacted authorities and made the controversial decision to publicize Cho's communications by releasing a small fraction of what it received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Perez-Pena|first=Richard|date=April 21, 2007|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/21/us/21backlash.html?pagewanted=print|title=Media outlets ease off video killer, but not because of complaints, they say|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=May 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After pictures and images from the videos were broadcast in numerous news reports, students and faculty from Virginia Tech, along with relatives of victims of the campus shooting, expressed concerns that glorifying Cho's rampage could lead to copycat killings. The airing of the manifesto and its video images and pictures was upsetting to many who were more closely affected by the shootings: Peter Read, the father of Mary Read, one of the students who was killed by Cho during the rampage, asked the media to stop airing Cho's manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title='Killer's images 'a second assault on us'' | url =http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/04/19/vtech.shooting/index.html  | publisher=CNN | date=April 20, 2007 | accessdate = April 20, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071224053736/http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/04/19/vtech.shooting/index.html |archivedate = December 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his manifesto, Cho mentioned the Columbine killers [[Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold]], denigrated former teachers, and made threatening messages to then-U.S. President [[George W. Bush]], [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]], and [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]]. In one of the videos, Cho said:

== Writings ==

=== Plays ===

====''Richard McBeef''====
{{redirect-distinguish|McBeef|McRib}}
In 2006, pursuant to a class assignment, Cho wrote a short one-act play entitled ''Richard McBeef''. The play focused on John, a 13-year-old boy whose father had died in a boating accident, and John's stepfather, ex-football player Richard McBeef (whom John constantly refers to as &quot;Dick&quot;). When Richard touches John's lap during an attempt at a 'father-to-son' talk, the boy abruptly claims that his stepfather is [[child sexual abuse|molesting]] him. John then accuses his stepfather of having murdered his actual father and repeatedly says that he will kill Richard. John, Richard and Sue (John's mother) are suddenly embroiled in a major argument. Richard retreats to his car to escape the conflict, but John, despite claiming repeatedly that Richard was abusing him, joins his stepfather in the car and harasses him. The play ends with John trying to shove a banana-flavored cereal bar into his stepfather's throat; Richard, hitherto a passive character, reacts &quot;out of sheer desecrated hurt and anger&quot; by &quot;swinging a deadly blow&quot; at the boy.&lt;ref&gt;Cho Seung-hui.

====''Mr. Brownstone''====
In a second play, ''Mr. Brownstone'', written for another class assignment, Cho depicted three 17-year-olds (John, Jane, and Joe), who sit in a [[casino]] while discussing their deep hatred for Mr. Brownstone, their 45-year-old mathematics teacher. The three characters claim—using the phrase &quot;ass-rape&quot;—that Mr. Brownstone mistreats them. John wins a multimillion-dollar jackpot from one of the slot machines, and Mr. Brownstone, amid volleys of profanity from the students, reports to casino officials that the three characters were underage and had illegally picked up the winning ticket. Mr. Brownstone tells the casino officials that it was he who had really won the jackpot, and that the minors had taken the ticket from him.&lt;ref name=&quot;AOL-Brownstone&quot;&gt;Cho Seung-hui. &quot;Mr. Brownstone&quot; AOL News.

=== Short fiction paper ===
Approximately one year before the incident at Virginia Tech, Cho also wrote a paper for an assignment in the &quot;Intro to Short Fiction&quot; class that he took during the spring 2006 semester. In that paper, Cho wrote about a mass school murder that was planned by the protagonist of the story but, according to the story, the protagonist did not follow through with the killings. During the proceedings of the Virginia Tech panel, the panel was unaware of the existence of the paper written by Cho for his fiction writing class.&lt;ref name=missing-paper&gt;Horwitz, S. (August 29, 2007). [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/28/AR2007082801948.html?nav=hcmodule Paper by Cho exhibits disturbing parallels to shootings, sources say.] ''The Washington Post''. Retrieved on August 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

When information surfaced about the paper, the Virginia Tech panel learned at that time that only the Virginia State Police and Virginia Tech had copies of the unreleased paper in their possession. The Virginia State Police reported that, although it had a copy of the paper, Virginia law prevented them from releasing the paper to the panel because it was part of the investigative file in an ongoing investigation.&lt;ref name=missing-paper/&gt;

Virginia Tech, on the other hand, had known about the paper, and officials at the school discussed the contents of the paper among themselves in the aftermath of the shootings. According to Governor Kaine, &quot;[Virginia Tech] was expected to turn over all of Cho's writings to the panel&quot; during the proceedings of the Virginia Tech panel.&lt;ref name=missing-paper/&gt;

After some members of the Virginia Tech panel complained about the missing paper, Virginia Tech decided to release a copy of the paper to the panel during the latter part of the week of August 25, 2007.&lt;ref name=missing-paper/&gt; Although the Virginia Tech panel has since received the paper written by Cho for the fiction writing class, the precise contents of that paper have not been released to the public.&lt;ref name=missing-paper/&gt;

=== Reactions to writings ===
[[Edward Falco]], a playwriting professor at Virginia Tech, has acknowledged that Cho wrote both plays in his class. The plays are fewer than 12 pages long and have several grammatical and typographical errors. Falco believed that Cho was drawn to writing because of his speech difficulties. Falco said of the plays, &quot;They're not good writing, but at least they are a form of communication.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Jonathan | last=Mandell | title='Cho's Professor to Classmates: Don't Feel Guilty|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/04/18/vatech.professor/index.html | publisher=CNN | date=April 18, 2007 | accessdate = April 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another professor who taught Cho characterized his work as &quot;very adolescent&quot; and &quot;silly&quot;, with attempts at &quot;[[Slapstick|slapstick comedy]]&quot; and &quot;elements of violence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Wingert | last=Pat | coauthors=Lynn Waddell and Arian Campo-Flores | title='He Was Just Off' | url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/35337 | publisher=Newsweek | date=April 17, 2007 | accessdate = September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novelist [[Stephen King]] examined the plays written by Cho, stating that they had no significance in an essay for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;king-ew-04202007&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Stephen | last=King | title=On Predicting Violence |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20036014,00.html | publisher=Entertainment Weekly | date=April 20, 2007 |accessdate = September 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Classmates believed &quot;the plays were really morbid and grotesque.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;T. Rees Shapiro. &quot;Cho's classroom colleague reacts to tragedy&quot; (April 17, 2007 2:06 PM).

The U.S. Secret Service concluded the study by saying that &quot;&amp;#91;t&amp;#93;he largest group of &amp;#91;school shooters&amp;#93; exhibited an interest in violence in their own writings, such as poems, essays or journal entries,&quot; while other school shooters showed an interest in violent video games, violent movies and violent books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ed.gov/admins/lead/safety/preventingattacksreport.pdf|title= Safe School Initiative Final Report|page= 26|author= |last= Vossekuil|first= Bryan |coauthors= et al.|month= May | year= 2002|publisher= U.S. Secret Service and U.S. Department of Education|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
