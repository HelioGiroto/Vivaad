'''Robert James &quot;Bob&quot; Ritchie''', born January 17, 1971, known by his stage name '''Kid Rock''', is an American singer-songwriter, musician, [[multi-instrumentalist]] and [[rapper]] with five [[Grammy Awards]] nominations. Kid Rock released several studio albums that went mostly unnoticed before his 1998 record ''[[Devil Without a Cause]]'', released with [[Atlantic Records]], sold 11 million albums behind the hits &quot;[[Bawitdaba]]&quot;, &quot;[[Cowboy (song)|Cowboy]]&quot;, &quot;[[I Am the Bullgod]]&quot; and &quot;[[Only God Knows Why]]&quot;. In 2000, he released ''[[The History of Rock]],'' a compilation of remixed and remastered versions of songs from previous albums as well as the hit single, &quot;[[American Bad Ass]]&quot;. 

Kid Rock released the follow-up in 2001, ''[[Cocky (album)|Cocky]]'' behind the single &quot;[[Forever]]&quot;. After a slow start, his country-flavored hit &quot;[[Picture (song)|Picture]]&quot; with [[Sheryl Crow]] resurrected the album a year later reaching number three on the Billboard 200 after debuting at number 8. The song  went gold as a single and pushed the album's sales over 5 million. It was followed by 2003's [[Kid Rock (album)|self-titled release]], which went platinum although it failed to chart a major hit. In 2006 he released ''[[Live Trucker]]'' a greatest hits live album that failed to go gold.

Making his comeback in 2007, Kid Rock released ''[[Rock n Roll Jesus]]'', which produced hits in &quot;[[So Hott]]&quot;, &quot;[[Amen]] &quot; and &quot;[[All Summer Long (Kid Rock song)|All Summer Long]]&quot;. The latter was his first worldwide smash hit, charting No. 1 in eight countries across [[Europe]] and in [[Australia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sales&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Kid Rock Celebrates 2 Million Album Sold!|work=Vivid Seats |url=http://www.kidrock.com/news/2008/08/28/kid-rock-celebrates-2-million-album-sold/|accessdate=August 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sales&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Youngs |first=Ian |title=Kid Rock boycotts iTunes over pay |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC, Inc. |date=June 18, 2008 |accessdate=July 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rock N Roll Jesus'' sold 5 million albums worldwide and was certified triple platinum in the U.S. He released ''[[Born Free (Kid Rock album)|Born Free]]'' on November 16, 2010. Behind the singles &quot;[[Born Free]] &quot;, &quot;Collide&quot; and &quot; Care&quot; the album would be certified platinum. &quot;Born Free&quot; was used for Republican Presidential nominee Mitt Romney's theme song for his campaign in 2011 and 2012. 

This gives Kid Rock his sixth Platinum album certification and gives him a career tally of 23 million albums sold. His worldwide total is 27 million, with Devil Without A Cause selling 13 million copies. [http://prince.org/msg/8/304825] He will release ''Rebel Soul'' on November 19, 2012. The lead single &quot; Let's Ride &quot; has been an instant hit at rock radio  quickly climbing into the top 30.

His sales are not aided by [[iTunes]], as he has boycotted sales of his music on the service. This also affects his singles' chart positions without digital downloads added in (for example, &quot;All Summer Long&quot; only peaked at No. 23 on the Billboard Hot 100). The only Kid Rock album available on iTunes is &quot;Grits Sandwiches For Breakfast&quot; because [[Jive Records]] owns the rights to the album. Rebel Soul will be available for download on iTunes upon its release, however, no plans have been made to distribute Kid Rock's other releases through the service.

==Early life==
  
Robert James &quot;Bob&quot; Ritchie was born on January 17, 1971 in [[Romeo, Michigan]] to William &quot;Bill&quot; Ritchie, a car dealer who owned several local dealerships, and Susan Ritchie. His family also owned a six-acre [[orchard]] and Robert regularly helped pick apples and cared for the family's horses.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Independent&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/my-secret-life-kid-rock-musician-age-37-870596.html|title=My Secret Life: Kid Rock Musician (age 37)|last=Philby|first=Charlotte|work=[[The Independent (magazine)|The Independent]]|accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has three siblings. The two elder are brother William &quot;Billy&quot; Ritchie and sister Carol Ritchie; his younger sister,[[Jill Ritchie]] is an actress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.purevolume.com/kidrock Excerpted and Adapted from Rolling Stone Cover Story, Kid Rock's Cure For Heartbreak By Austin Scaggs Issue 1037, October 18, 2007], retrieved on 2011-1-6&lt;/ref&gt; Ritchie found small-town life dull; he became interested in [[rap music]], learned how to [[breakdance]] and participated in talent shows in the Detroit area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=kid-rock-p15074/biography|pure_url=yes}}|title=Kid Rock – Biography|last=Huey|first=Jeff|publisher=Allmusic|accessdate=2010-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age eleven he joined a [[breakdance]] crew called the Furious Funkers, and taught himself to work a cheap belt-driven [[Phonograph|turntable]]. In high school, Ritchie DJed at parties for beer. He eventually joined Bo Wisdom of Groove Time Productions, in [[Mt. Clemens, Michigan]] to perform basement parties for thirty dollars a night. He was then given his stage name; club goers dubbed him &quot;Kid Rock&quot; after they had enjoyed watching &quot;that white kid rock.&quot;

Ritchie eventually ran away to Mt. Clemens at 15 and stayed with his friend Chris Pouncy. He was forced by a local drug gang known as the &quot;Best Friends&quot; to sell drugs out of a car wash at which he worked. A man in the neighborhood, angered by the actions, organized a rap group to keep the neighborhood kids out of trouble. It was composed of The Blackman (founder of the group), [[Champtown]], KDC, Chris &quot;Doc Roun-Cee&quot; Pouncy and Bob. They were known as &quot;The Beast Crew&quot;. Rock befriended producer [[D-Nice]] of the legendary hip-hop group [[Boogie Down Productions]]. When Rock opened for BDP one night, D-Nice invited an [[A&amp;R]] representative from [[Jive Records]] to see him perform. This meeting led to a demo deal, which developed into a full record contract.

Against his parents' wishes, Rock signed the deal at age seventeen. Despite his new record deal, he had a falling out with The Beast Crew when he signed over fellow member Champtown (the two have become friends again since). They left his vocals on the tracks of their debut underground album &quot;Chapter 1: He Don't Want Us No More,&quot; against his wishes. Rock later became part of the Straight From The Underground Tour alongside several heavyweights of rap including [[Ice Cube]], [[Too Short]], D-Nice, [[Mac Dre]], and [[Yo-Yo (rapper)|Yo-Yo]].

==Career==

=== Early career ===
On December 30, 1990 Kid Rock released his debut album ''[[Grits Sandwiches for Breakfast]]''. As noted by [[Insane Clown Posse]] member [[Joseph Bruce|Violent J]], this album made Kid Rock one of the two biggest rap stars in Detroit in 1990, along with local [[independent music|independent]] rapper [[Esham]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BehindthePaint164&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate= |year=2003 |origmonth=August |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=164–167 |chapter=Paying Dues }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BehindthePaint174&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Bruce |first=Joseph |authorlink=Joseph Bruce |coauthors=Hobey Echlin |editor=Nathan Fostey |title=ICP: Behind the Paint |origdate=   |edition=second |publisher=Psychopathic Records |location=Royal Oak, Michigan |isbn=0-9741846-0-8 |pages=174–189 |chapter=The Dark Carnival|year=2003|month=August }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though Jive Records did not push the album, it gained infamy when radio station [[WSUC-FM]] (90.5) of Cortland, NY was fined $23,700 by the FCC for playing the song Yo Da-Lin In the Valley then the largest fine against a radio station. The album sold an estimated 100,000 copies. Kid Rock's career had begun to decline towards the end of 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;BehindthePaint174&quot;/&gt; Jive Records released Kid Rock from his contract in 1991. Once back in Detroit he became friends with [[Uncle Kracker]] after battling his brother in a freestyle rapping competition; Uncle Kracker became Kid Rock's DJ, even though he had no clue how to play them.

In late 1991 Kid Rock was picked up by an independent record label called Continuum Records. Though Insane Clown Posse's Violent J disliked Kid Rock's rapping style, he paid Kid Rock to appear on Insane Clown Posse's first album, ''[[Carnival of Carnage]]'' in 1992, in an attempt to gain notice for the album.&lt;ref name=&quot;BehindthePaint174&quot;/&gt; Kid Rock showed up to record the song &quot;Is That You?&quot; intoxicated, but re-recorded his vocals and record scratching the following day.&lt;ref name=&quot;BehindthePaint174&quot;/&gt; In March 1993, Continuum released his second album ''[[The Polyfuze Method]]'', which featured a more [[rap rock]]-oriented sound with Kid Rock teaching himself how to play several different instruments including guitar, drums, keyboard and organ. The album saw some local college radio success at [[Central Michigan University]] with the tracks &quot;Back From The Dead&quot; and &quot;Balls In Your Mouth&quot;. He wanted &quot;Prodigal Son&quot; has the lead single but Jive refused and released &quot;U Don't Know Me&quot; as the first single from the album, but it failed to chart, and the music video received little airplay on major music video channels. Kid Rock re-released &quot;Back From The Dead&quot; as a single to mainstream radio and producing the music video himself, but that too failed as a single. The album has sold approximately 15,000 copies.

He released an [[Extended play|EP]] called ''[[Fire It Up (EP)|Fire It Up]]'' in December 1993. The EP featured the song &quot;[[I Am the Bullgod]]&quot; which wouldn't be a hit until six years later. Continuum didn't see a future with Kid Rock after this and released him from his contract in 1994.

He moved back to Detroit where his on-again-off-again relationship with Kelly South resulted in a son Robert James Ritchie Jr. Kid Rock released monthly demo tapes dubbed The Bootleg Series which featured demos of him and other up-and-coming rappers and garage rock bands in the Detroit area. Around the same time Kid Rock formed his back up band Twisted Brown Trucker, later recruiting [[Joe C.|Joseph &quot;Joe C.&quot; Calleja]] whom he met at a 1994 concert in Roseville,MI, as part of the group. In 1995 Rock took a job as a janitor at Whiterooms Studios to pay studio fees. When he wasn't working, Kid Rock recorded the material that eventually made up his fourth album ''[[Early Mornin' Stoned Pimp]]'', which Rock released on his own label, Top Dog Records. During the recording process he met piano player Jimmie Bones who soon after joined the band. The album was released on February 12, 1996. A loan from his father aided the release and Kid Rock sold 6,000 copies from the trunk of his car, sometimes after his concerts.

Lava/Atlantic Records A&amp;R man Andy Karp was interested, after seeing Kid Rock in [[Cleveland]] in December 1996 and again in March 1997. Following a two song demo tape containing &quot;Somebody's Gotta Feel This&quot; and &quot;I Got One For Ya&quot; [Jason Flom] supported Karp in signing Kid Rock for $100,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lava Record Deal&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=Interview Andy Karp Vice President of A&amp;R at Lava/Atlantic in New York | work=AtlanticRecordsContact.com |url=http://www.atlanticrecordscontact.com/ | accessdate=July 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when recording sessions began Atlantic wanted more of a rock sound and didn't initially like &quot;Cowboy,&quot; &quot;Devil Without A Cause&quot; and &quot;Only God Knows Why.&quot; They asked Rock to take out the &quot;I'm going platinum&quot; line on the title track's chorus but he refused. The conflict slowed down production, however ''[[Devil Without a Cause]]'' was completed on schedule with Rock mostly playing all the instruments himself.

===''Devil Without a Cause'' to ''Cocky'' (1997–2002)===
{{refimprove section|date=July 2010}}
In 1997, Kid Rock added drummer/vocalist [[Stefanie Eulinberg]] to his band, joining Kenny Olson, [[Jason Krause]], [[Jimmie Bones]], [[Uncle Kracker]], Misty Love, Shirley Hayden and [[Joe C.]]. On August 18, 1998, Atlantic released ''[[Devil Without a Cause]]'' behind the single &quot;Welcome 2 The Party.&quot;  Kid Rock went on the [[Warped Tour|Vans Warped Tour]] to support the album.Sales of &quot;Welcome 2 The Party&quot; and ''Devil'' were slow, though the 1998 Warped Tour in [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] stimulated regional interest in [[Massachusetts]] and [[New England]].  This led to substantial airplay in the summer and fall of 1998 on rock staples in Massachusetts [[WZLX]] and [[WAAF (FM)|WAAF]] for the single &quot;I Am The Bullgod.&quot; In early December 1998, while DJ'ing at a club he met and became friends with MTV host [[Carson Daly]], he talked Daly into getting him a performance on MTV. On December 28, 1998 he performed on ''MTV Fashionably Loud''in Miami,FL creating a buzz from his performance, upstagging Jay-Z. In May his sales began taking off behind the third single &quot;Bawitdaba&quot; and by April 1999 ''Devil Without a Cause'' had achieved a [[gold disc]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA Certifications&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=RIAA Certifications for albums by Kid Rock: Gold and Platinum | publisher=[[Recording Industry Association of America]] |work= RIAA.com| url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;artist=Kid%20Rock%20&amp;format=ALBUM&amp;go=Search&amp;perPage=50 |accessdate=July 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June, ''Devil'' like he predicted went platinum.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA Certifications&quot; /&gt; Kid Rock went on his first major tour, Limptropolis, opening for[[Limp Bizkit]] with [[Staind]]. He solified is new superstardom by his[[Woodstock 1999]] performance and on July 24, he was double platinum.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA Certifications&quot; /&gt; The following single &quot;[[Cowboy (Kid Rock song)|Cowboy]]&quot; was an even bigger hit. It was a mix of southern rock, country and rap that made the Top 40. It became WCW's Jeff Jarrett's theme song. Rock's next single, the slow back porch blues ballad &quot;[[Only God Knows Why]]&quot;, was the biggest hit off the album charting at No 19 on the Billboard Hot 100. It was one of the first songs to use the autotune effect. By the time the final single &quot;[[Wasting Time (Kid Rock Song)|Wasting Time]]&quot; was released the album had sold 7 million albums, ''Devil Without A Cause'' was certified 11 times platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] on April 17, 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA Certifications&quot; /&gt;

Rock was nominated as Best New Artist at the 2000 Grammy Awards, but lost to [[Christina Aguilera]]. He was nominated for &quot;Bawitdaba&quot; for Best Hard Rock Performance, but lost to Metallica's &quot;Whiskey in the Jar.&quot;

After reacquiring the rights to his early material in 2000, Rock released ''[[The History of Rock]]'', a collection of remixed and re-recorded songs from ''The Polyfuze Method'' and ''Early Mornin Stoned Pimp''. &quot;American Bad Ass&quot;, one of two new tracks, was released as a single. It sampled the [[Metallica]] track &quot;[[Sad But True]]&quot;. It was used in the WWE  as the Undertaker's Theme Song for his new biker from hell gimmick. The song was used for TV promos for the movies &quot; GI Joe &quot; and &quot;Battleship&quot; released in 2009 and 2012.

On May 27 Kid Rock appeared on &quot;[[Saturday Night Live]]&quot; performing &quot;American Bad Ass&quot; and an acoustic version of &quot;Only God Knows Why&quot; that featured [[Phish]]'s Trey Anastasio and was arranged by country singer David Allan Coe. Kid Rock joined Phish later in the year in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], for a set of cover songs.

From June 30 to August 22, 2000, Kid Rock joined the [[Summer Sanitarium Tour]] with Metallica, [[Korn]], [[Powerman 5000]], and [[System of a Down]]. Kid Rock filled in for [[James Hetfield]] of Metallica, singing vocals on the songs &quot;[[Enter Sandman]]&quot;, &quot;[[Sad But True]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Nothing Else Matters]]&quot; and the turntables for &quot;Fuel&quot;, for three shows after Hetfield injured his spine riding a jet ski on [[Lake Lanier]] the day before the July 7 Atlanta concert. Kid Rock would go on &quot; The History Of Rock Tour&quot; from August to September of that year.

On November 16, 2000, Joseph &quot;Joe C&quot; Calleja died in his sleep from [[Coeliac disease]] in Taylor, MI. The disease stunted his growth and forced him to take 60 pills a day. Joe C's final song was &quot;Cool Daddy Cool&quot; for the ''Osmosis Jones'' soundtrack. The band made a cameo in the movie as the band playing in the club scene. Kid Rock was referred to as Kidney Rock to go along with the cartoon aspect of being a cell in the body of Frank played by Bill Murray.

On the 2001 American Bad Ass Tour, in which [[David Allan Coe]] performed as an opening act for Kid Rock was the subject of criticism from journalist [[Neil Strauss]], who alleged that Coe's songs were racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/04/arts/songwriter-s-racist-songs-from-1980-s-haunt-him.html |title=Songwriter's Racist Songs From 1980's Haunt Him |author=Neil Strauss |date=September 4, 2000 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2001, Rock inducted Aerosmith into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] and performed &quot;[[Sweet Emotion]]&quot; at the induction ceremony. The same year, Rock landed his first acting role in the [[David Spade]] [[white trash]] comedy ''[[Joe Dirt]]''. His character was Robbie, a redneck bully to Joe Dirt, chasing after Joe's unaware love interest, Brandy.

&quot;American Bad Ass&quot; was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 2001 Grammy Awards, losing out to Rage Against The Machine's &quot;Guerilla Radio&quot;. ''The History of Rock'' would go on to be certified double platinum.

In November, Kid Rock released ''[[Cocky (album)|Cocky]]'', which was marketed as the official follow up to ''Devil Without a Cause''. With the era of rap metal on the decline, Kid Rock included several southern rock and country ballads on the album. The first single, &quot;[[Forever (Kid Rock song)|Forever]]&quot;, featured his standard brash rap-rock sound, but lacked the selling power of &quot;Devil Without A Cause&quot;. The songs &quot;[[Lonely Road of Faith]]&quot;and &quot;[[You Never Met a Motherfucker Quite Like Me]]&quot; were released as singles, but were only minor hits, and the album struggled to reach platinum a year later. Rock then had problems with the release of &quot;[[Picture (song)|Picture]]&quot;, a country-influenced duet with [[Sheryl Crow]]: his label felt it was wrong for his image, and was not keen to spend more money promoting a flagging album; then, when they agreed to release it, Sheryl Crow's label initially refused to give permission. Rock, meanwhile, made a radio version with [[Allison Moorer]], which was gaining airplay. Crow's label caved and their version was finally released. When &quot;Picture&quot; was released it introduced Kid Rock to a wider audience, and was ultimately the most successful single on the album.&lt;ref name=&quot;picture song&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1459755/20030129/kid_rock.jhtml |title=Kid Rock's Dead-In-The-Water Cocky Comes Back To Life |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |work=MTV |publisher=MTV Networks |date=January 30, 2003 |accessdate=July 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song would chart at number 4 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and number 17 on Country radio. The song remains his most successful pop song in the U.S. to date. The song was rumored to be an apology to Sheryl Crow for Kid Rock cheating on her with Pamela Anderson.

On December 14, 2001, [[Country Music Television|CMT]] aired an episode of ''[[Crossroads (CMT TV series)|Crossroads]]'' featuring Rock with [[Hank Williams, Jr.]] The episode drew 2.1 million viewers, a record on CMT.&lt;ref name=&quot;crossroads&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Kid Rock revives the basics of rock ... but he's still got some rap in his repertoire |last=Finn |first=Timothy |work= The Kansas City Star |publisher=McClatchy Company |pages=F7 |date=February 14, 2008 |url=http://www.kansascity.com/781/story/488087.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would perform for troops in January 2002 on an MTV USO Special at Germany's [[Ramstein Air Base]] along with [[Ja Rule]] and [[Jennifer Lopez]].

At the end of 2002, [[Uncle Kracker]] left the band to pursue a solo career, and Detroit underground rapper [[Paradime]] replaced him. Kid Rock made his second movie, ''[[Biker Boyz]]'', with [[Laurence Fishburne]].

===''Kid Rock'' to ''Rock n Roll Jesus'' (2003–2009)===
In 2003, Kid Rock returned with an [[Kid Rock (album)|eponymous album]], almost stripping away the accustomed rap metal sound he had created, opting for southern rock and several country ballads in the wake of &quot;Picture&quot;'s success. The album's lead single was a cover of [[Bad Company]]'s &quot;[[Feel Like Makin' Love (Bad Company song)|Feel Like Makin' Love]]&quot;. A media blitz accompanied the single capped off by the VH-1 special called ''A Kid Rock Christmas'', which aired on December 14, 2003. He would release &quot;Cold and Empty&quot;, &quot;Jackson, Mississippi&quot; and &quot;I Am&quot; [[I Am (Kid Rock song)]]
to minor success on radio. The David Allan Coe-penned &quot;Single Father&quot;, became his second charting country song, although like the other singles it was minor hit at #50.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA Certifications&quot; /&gt; The album would go on to go platinum.

Kid Rock was involved in the [[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|halftime show controversy]] at [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] in Houston, Texas on February 1, 2004.
