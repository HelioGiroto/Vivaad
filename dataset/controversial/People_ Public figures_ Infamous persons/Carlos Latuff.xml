'''Carlos Latuff''' (born November 30, 1968) is a [[Brazilian people|Brazilian]] [[freelancer|freelance]] [[political cartoonist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/brazilian-artist-lives-up-to-his-promise-1.45749 UAE General, Brazilian artist lives up to his promise]&lt;/ref&gt; His works deal with an array of themes, including [[anti-globalization]], [[anti-capitalism]], and anti-[[U.S. military intervention]]. He is best known for his images depicting the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]] and, more recently, the [[Arab Spring]] events. Latuff himself has described his work as controversial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.menassat.com/?q=en/news-articles/5505-carlos-latuff-cartoonist-opinion-maker Interview with Latuff &quot;Carlos Latuff: Cartoonist and opinion-maker&quot;], Menassat, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Latuff was born in [[São Cristóvão]] ([[Rio de Janeiro]]), Brazil, and is of [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] ancestry; in his own words he said he has &quot;[[Arab]] roots&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/uae/general/brazilian-artist-lives-up-to-his-promise-1.45749 UAE General, Brazilian artist lives up to his promise]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published works==
Latuff's works have been posted mostly by himself on [[Indymedia]] websites and private blogs. However, some of them have been picked up and featured in magazines such as the Brazilian edition of ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://latuff2.deviantart.com/art/Bush-s-Last-Days-109635078 Mad magazine, January 2009, Brazilian edition] &lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Le Monde Diplomatique]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://twitpic.com/3hbxub]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[The Toronto Star]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestar.com/living/article/433754 The Toronto Star: More than just a chic checkered scarf]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a few of his works were published on Arab websites and publications such as the ''[[Islamic Front for the Iraqi Resistance]]'' (JAMI) magazine, the Saudi magazine ''Character'', the Lebanese newspaper ''[[Al Akhbar (Lebanon)|Al Akhbar]]'', among others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tales-of-iraq-war.blogspot.com/2008/06/interview-for-jami-magazine.html Interview for JAMI magazine]&lt;br&gt;[http://tales-of-iraq-war.blogspot.com/2008/05/my-cartoons-in-saudi-arabia-magazine.html My cartoons in Saudi Arabia magazine]&lt;br&gt;[http://tales-of-iraq-war.blogspot.com/2008/04/article-about-my-art-in-lebanese.html Article about my art in the Lebanese newspaper &quot;Al Akhbar&quot;]&lt;br&gt;[http://tales-of-iraq-war.blogspot.com/2008/04/cartoon-reproduced-in-iraqi-magazine.html Cartoon reproduced in Iraqi magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==
A vast number of Latuff's cartoons are related to the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]], which according to his claims : &quot;became important to Latuff after he visited the area in the late 1990s.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;review&quot;&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/14746/ The Jewish Daily Forward: Simple, Offensive and Out There]&lt;/ref&gt; These cartoons are heavily critical of [[Israel]]&lt;ref name=&quot;review&quot; /&gt; and have drawn criticism and allegations of uninhibited utilization of &quot;[[judeophobic]] [[stereotype]]s in the service of the [[anti-globalisation]] movement.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/dec/18/israelandthepalestinians-pressandpublishing|title=Cartoon symbols of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict|last=Black|first=Ian|date=19 December 2008|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his ''We are all Palestinians'' ({{lang-ar|كلنا فلسطينيون}}) cartoon series, various famous oppressed groups, including [[Jew]]s in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]], Black [[South Africa]]ns during [[Apartheid]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]], and [[Tibet]]ans in [[China]], are all shown stating &quot;I am Palestinian&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sinkers.org/latuff Carlos Latuff: &quot;We Are All Palestinian&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Latuff has also made a series of cartoons that portray Israeli [[Prime Minister]] [[Ariel Sharon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/2110463/ | title = Ariel Sharon portrait by ~latuff | publisher = [[DeviantArt]] | date = 2003-06-08 | accessdate = 2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/2103617/ | title = Ariel Sharon by ~latuff | publisher = [[DeviantArt]] | date = 2003-06-07 | accessdate = 2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://latuff.deviantart.com/art/The-Godfather-1809410 | title = The Godfather by ~latuff | publisher = [[DeviantArt]] | date = 2003-05-02 | accessdate = 2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States]] President [[George W. Bush]], Brazilian president [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]] and [[United Kingdom|British]] PM [[Tony Blair]] among other politicians as monsters and as [[Nazi]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/graphics/latuff/main.php?g2_itemId=1051][http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/2110858/]

[http://brasil.indymedia.org/images/2004/09/289838.gif]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Latuff is also critical of US military action in Iraq and Afghanistan. He has made promotional cartoons for anti-US militancy&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Victory.gif]], [[:File:Iraq war, year FOUR!.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as cartoons alleging US actions have been motivated by the chance of making profit from oil.&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:KillinintheRain.png]], [[:File:Warforoil.gif]]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the cartoons, there are also some that portray US soldiers as severely wounded, dead, or paraplegic or as harming Iraqi civilians.

In his comic series ''Tales of Iraq War'' ({{lang-ar|حكايات من حرب العراق}}) he portrays &quot;[[Juba (sniper)|Juba, the Baghdad sniper]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tales-of-iraq-war.blogspot.com/2007/02/juba-baghdad-sniper-4.html An example episode of Juba the Baghdad sniper at Latuff's blog]&lt;br&gt;[http://tales-of-iraq-war.blogspot.com/2007/02/juba-baghdad-sniper-2.html A second example episode of Juba the Baghdad sniper at Latuff's blog], [http://tales-of-iraq-war.blogspot.com/2007/02/juba-baghdad-sniper-arabic_07.html (Arabic)]&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Iraqi insurgency]] character claimed to have shot down several-dozen US soldiers, as a &quot;superhero&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://latuff2.deviantart.com/art/Latuff-in-NOX-Magazine-125566238 Interview with Carlos Latuff]&lt;/ref&gt; He has also made a caricature of US President George W. Bush laughing over US casualties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infoshop.org/graphics/Latuff3/Anti-America/Laughs.gif.html 'Laughs' by Carlos Latuff (infoshop.org)], [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Laughs.gif Commons Link]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the end of 2010, he's been consistently engaged in producing cartoons about the [[Arab Spring]] in which he openly sided with the revolutionaries. After the victory of revolutions in [[Tunisia]], [[Egypt]] and [[Libya]] his cartoons about these countries have focused on the menace of [[counter-revolution]] or [[imperialism|Western interference]]. Some of his cartoons have been displayed in mass demonstrations in Arab countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/08/29/us-brazil-cartoonist-mideast-idUSTRE77S3IW20110829 Rio cartoonist inspires Arab rebellions from afar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://twicsy.com/i/QsLSL Latuff's cartoon displayed in Tahrir Square]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabawy.org/2011/07/16/no-military-tribunals-2/ Stop military tribunals]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
His works were criticized by a writer for the Institute for Global Jewish Affairs, part of the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]] (an Israeli [[NGO]]), for allegedly containing antisemitism.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anti-Israelism, Jewish Studies&quot;&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/JCPA/Templates/ShowPage.asp?DRIT=3&amp;DBID=1&amp;LNGID=1&amp;TMID=111&amp;FID=624&amp;PID=0&amp;IID=4636&amp;TTL=Antisemitic_Cartoons_on_Progressive_Blogs Anti-Semitic Cartoons on Progressive Blogs Adam Levick]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 the [[Switzerland|Swiss]]-based [[Holocaust survivors]] organization [[Aktion Kinder des Holocaust]] sued the [[Independent Media Center|Indymedia]] of Switzerland on the charge of [[anti-Semitism]] for publishing Latuff's cartoon titled ''We are all Palestinians'' series in their website, which depicted a Jewish boy in [[Warsaw Ghetto]] saying: &quot;I am Palestinian.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Schärer: [http://www.akdh.ch/ps/woz040402.htm Linke und Antisemitismus: Der Indymedia-Streit - Aufpassen, was im Kübel landet], ''Die Wochenzeitung'', April 4, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Junge Welt]]: [http://www.akdh.ch/indymedia4.htm Ärger im Internet: Wegen antisemitischer Beiträge hat Indymedia Schweiz den Betrieb gestoppt], February 25, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aktion Kinder des Holocaust: [http://www.akdh.ch/latuff2.htm Is this cartoon by Latuff, published at indymedia-switzerland, anti-Semitic? An analysis]&lt;/ref&gt; The criminal proceedings were suspended by Swiss court.&lt;ref name = Redress&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.redress.btinternet.co.uk/ahamadeh2.htm | title = Jewish peace activists and Israeli violence | month = August | year = 2002 | first = Anis | last = Hamadeh | accessdate = 2007-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Latuff placed second and won $4,000, for his cartoon comparing the [[Israel]]i [[West Bank barrier]] with the [[Nazi concentration camp]]s, in the controversial [[Iran]]ian '[[International Holocaust Cartoon Competition]]'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irancartoon.com/120/holocaust/ Winners of the Iranian Holocaust Cartoon Competition], IRANCARTOON International&lt;/ref&gt;
The contest was created in response to Muhammad cartoons published by a Danish newspaper (see ''[[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy]]''), under the notion that those who supported the right to free speech in matters concerning Islam would be placed in a precarious position were they to condemn the [[antisemitic]] cartoons aimed to mock and ridicule the Jewish [[Holocaust]].
Latuff's entry was described as &quot;Holocaust inversion,&quot; a &quot;motif&quot; of antisemitism, by [[Manfred Gerstenfeld]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Manfred Gerstenfeld]]: [http://www.spme.net/cgi-bin/articles.cgi?ID=1792 &quot;Ahmadinejad, Iran, and Holocaust manipulation: methods, aims, and reactions&quot;], ''[[Scholars for Peace in the Middle East|Scholars For Peace in the Middle East]]'', February 1, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In their 2003 Annual Report, the [[Stephen Roth Institute]] compared Latuff's cartoons of [[Ariel Sharon|Sharon]] to &quot;the [[antisemitic]] caricatures of [[Philipp Rupprecht]] in [[Julius Streicher]]'s [[Der Stürmer]].&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;SRI&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/Anti-Semitism/asw2003-4/general-analysis.htm|title=General Analysis: Overview|year=2003|work=Annual Report|publisher=[[Stephen Roth Institute]]|accessdate=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The SRI also complained over a cartoon showing [[Che Guevara]] in a Palestinian [[keffiyeh]].&lt;ref name = &quot;SRI2&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Joel Kotek a professor at Belgium’s [[Free University of Brussels]], in his book “Cartoons and Extremism”&lt;ref&gt;Cartoons and Extremism: Israel and the Jews in Arab and Western Media By Joel Kotek Vallentine Mitchell, 201 pages&lt;/ref&gt; calls Latuff “the contemporary [[Drumont]] of the internet.”( Edouard Drumont was the founder of the French “[[Antisemitic League of France]]” and the publisher of &quot;La Libre Parole&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:La Libre Parole]]&lt;/ref&gt; a magazine that printed numerous classically antisemitic cartoons during the years of the [[Dreyfus Affair]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forward.com/articles/14746/ Simple, Offensive and Out There Extreme Cartoons Distort Israel and the Jews By Eddy Portnoy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Response===
In an interview with the Jewish-American weekly newspaper ''[[The Forward]]'' in December 2008, Latuff responded to charges of antisemitism and the comparison to Streicher:&lt;blockquote&gt;
My cartoons have no focus on the Jews or on Judaism. My focus is Israel as a political entity, as a government, their armed forces being a satellite of U.S. interests in the Middle East, and especially Israeli policies toward the Palestinians. It happens to be Israeli Jews that are the oppressors of Palestinians.…My detractors say that the use of the [[Magen David]] in my Israel-related cartoons is irrefutable proof of antisemitism; however, it’s not my fault if Israel chose sacred [[religious symbol|religious motif]]s as [[national symbols]], such as the [[Knesset Menorah]] or the [[Star of David]] in killing-machines like [[F-16]] jets.&lt;ref&gt;
