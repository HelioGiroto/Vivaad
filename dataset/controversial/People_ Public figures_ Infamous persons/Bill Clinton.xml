'''William Jefferson &quot;Bill&quot; Clinton''' (born '''William Jefferson Blythe III'''; August 19, 1946) is an American politician who served as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|42nd]] [[President of the United States]] from 1993 to 2001. Inaugurated at age 46, he was the [[List of Presidents of the United States by age|third-youngest president]]. He took office at the end of the [[Cold War]], and was the first president of the [[baby boomer]] generation. Clinton has been described as a [[New Democrat]]. Many of his policies have been attributed to a [[centrism|centrist]] [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]] philosophy of governance.

Born and raised in Arkansas, Clinton became both a student leader and a skilled musician. He is an alumnus of [[Georgetown University]] where he was a member of [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and [[Kappa Kappa Psi]] and earned a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to attend the [[University of Oxford]]. He is married to [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], who has served as the [[United States Secretary of State]] since 2009 and was a [[List of United States Senators from New York|Senator from New York]] from 2001 to 2009. Both Clintons received [[Juris Doctor|law degrees]] from [[Yale Law School]], where they met and began dating. As [[List of Governors of Arkansas|Governor of Arkansas]], Clinton overhauled the state's education system, and served as Chair of the [[National Governors Association]].

Clinton was elected president in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]], defeating incumbent president [[George H. W. Bush]]. As president, Clinton presided over the longest period of peacetime economic expansion in American history. He signed into law the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]]. He implemented [[Don't ask, don't tell]], a controversial intermediate step to full gay military integration. After a failed [[Clinton health care plan|health care reform]] attempt, [[Republican Party of the United States|Republicans]] [[Republican Revolution|won control]] of [[United States Congress|Congress]] in 1994, for the first time in forty years. Two years later, the re-elected Clinton became the first member of the Democratic Party since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to win a second full term as president. He successfully passed [[welfare reform]] and the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]], providing health coverage for millions of children. Later, he was [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeached]] for [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]] in a [[Lewinsky scandal|scandal involving a White House intern]], but was acquitted by the [[U.S. Senate]] and served his complete term of office. The [[Congressional Budget Office]] reported a budget surplus between the years 1998 and 2000, the last three years of Clinton's presidency.

Clinton left office with the highest end-of-office [[approval rating]] of any U.S. president since World War II. Since then, he has been involved in public speaking and humanitarian work. Based on his philanthropic worldview, Clinton created the [[Clinton Foundation|William J. Clinton Foundation]] to promote and address international causes such as prevention of [[AIDS]] and [[global warming]]. In 2004, he released his autobiography ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]''. He has remained active in politics by campaigning for Democratic candidates, most notably for [[Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|his wife's campaign for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination]], and then [[Barack Obama]]'s presidential campaigns in [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|2008]] and [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2012|2012]]. In 2009, he was named United Nations [[Special Envoy of the Secretary-General|Special Envoy]] to [[Haiti]], and after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|2010 earthquake]] he teamed with [[George W. Bush]] to form the [[Clinton Bush Haiti Fund]]. Since leaving office, Clinton has been rated highly in [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|public opinion polls of U.S. presidents]].

==Early life and career==
[[File:William Jefferson Blythe 1950.jpg|thumb|upright|left|William Jefferson Blythe III, in 1950 at age four]]

Bill Clinton was born William Jefferson Blythe, III, at Julia Chester Hospital in [[Hope, Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.eircom.net/%257Eseanjmurphy/dir/pres.htm |title=Directory of Irish Genealogy: American Presidents with Irish Ancestors |publisher=Homepage.eircom.net |date=March 23, 2004 |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; His father, [[William Jefferson Blythe, Jr.]], was a traveling salesman who died in an automobile accident three months before Bill was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;whitehouse.gov bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of William J. Clinton |publisher=[[The White House]] |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/presidents/williamjclinton/ |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother, [[Virginia Clinton Kelley|Virginia Dell Cassidy]] (1923–1994), traveled to New Orleans to study nursing soon after he was born. She left Bill in Hope with grandparents Eldridge and Edith Cassidy, who owned and ran a small [[grocery store]].&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; At a time when the Southern United States was [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated racially]], Bill's grandparents sold goods on [[credit (finance)|credit]] to people of all races.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; In 1950, Bill's mother returned from nursing school and married [[Roger Clinton, Sr.]], who owned an [[Car dealership|automobile dealership]] in [[Hot Springs, Arkansas]] with his brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Clinton |first=Bill |title=My Life |publisher=[[Random House]] |year=2004 |isbn=1-4000-3003-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to Hot Springs in 1950.

[[File:Bill Clinton Boyhood Home in Hope, Arkansas IMG 1515.JPG|thumb|Bill Clinton boyhood home in [[Hope, Arkansas]]]]

Although he assumed use of his stepfather's surname, it was not until Billy (as he was known then) turned fifteen&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oprah.com/omagazine/Oprah-Interviews-President-Bill-Clinton/3 &quot;Oprah Talks to Bill Clinton.&quot;] ''O, The Oprah Magazine'', August 2004. Retrieved 2011-12-18.&lt;/ref&gt; that he formally adopted the surname Clinton as a gesture toward his stepfather.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; Clinton says he remembers his stepfather as a [[gambler]] and an alcoholic who regularly [[domestic violence|abused]] his mother and half-brother, [[Roger Clinton, Jr.]], to the point where he intervened multiple times with the threat of violence to protect them.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Maraniss |first=David |title=First In His Class: A Biography Of Bill Clinton |publisher=Touchstone |year=1996 |isbn= 0-684-81890-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hot Springs, Bill attended St. John's Catholic Elementary School, Ramble Elementary School, and [[Hot Springs High School (Arkansas)|Hot Springs High School]]&amp;nbsp;– where he was an active student leader, avid reader, and musician.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; He was in the chorus and played the [[tenor saxophone]], winning first chair in the state band's saxophone section. He briefly considered dedicating his life to music, but as he noted in his autobiography ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]'':
{{quote|&quot;Sometime in my sixteenth year, I decided I wanted to be in public life as an elected official. I loved music and thought I could be very good, but I knew I would never be [[John Coltrane]] or [[Stan Getz]]. I was interested in medicine and thought I could be a fine doctor, but I knew I would never be [[Michael E. DeBakey|Michael DeBakey]]. But I knew I could be great in public service.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;}}

Clinton has named two influential moments in his life that contributed to his decision to become a public figure, both occurring in 1963. One was his visit as a [[Boys Nation]] senator to the [[White House]] to meet President [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt; The other was listening to [[Martin Luther King, Jr.|Martin Luther King's]] 1963 ''[[I Have a Dream]]'' speech, which impressed him enough that he later memorized it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It All Began in a Place Called Hope (Archived whitehouse.gov Article) |publisher=[[The White House]] |url=http://clinton4.nara.gov/WH/EOP/OP/html/Hope.html |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==College and law school years==
[[File:Clinton at Georgetown 1967.jpg|right|upright|thumb|Clinton ran for President of the Student Council while attending the School of Foreign Service at [[Georgetown University]].]]
With the aid of scholarships, Clinton attended the [[Edmund A. Walsh School of Foreign Service]] at [[Georgetown University]] in Washington, D.C., receiving a [[List of tagged degrees|Bachelor of Science in Foreign Service]] (B.S.) degree in 1968. He spent the summer of 1967, the summer before his senior year, [[intern]]ing for Arkansas [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[J. William Fulbright]].&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt; While in college, he became a brother of [[Alpha Phi Omega]] and was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]]. Clinton was also a member of the Order of [[DeMolay International|DeMolay]], a youth group affiliated with Freemasonry, but he never became a [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.demolay.org/aboutdemolay/halloffame_bio.php?hofid=18 |title=Bill Clinton Inducted May 1, 1988 |publisher=DeMolay |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a member of [[Kappa Kappa Psi]] honorary band fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.kkpsi.org/prominentmembers.asp Prominent Members]'', Kappa Kappa Psi. Retrieved August 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon graduation, he won a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] to [[University College, Oxford]] where he studied [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]], though because he had switched programs and had left early for Yale University, he did not receive a degree there.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1994/06/09/world/oxford-journal-whereas-he-is-an-old-boy-if-a-young-chief-honor-him.html |title=Oxford Journal; Whereas, He Is an Old Boy, If a Young Chief, Honor Him|last=Dowd|first=Maureen|work=The New York Times |accessdate=July 17, 2009 | date=June 9, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed an interest in [[rugby union]], playing at Oxford&lt;ref&gt;Cain, Nick &amp; Growden, Greg &quot;Chapter 21: Ten Peculiar Facts about Rugby&quot; in ''Rugby Union for Dummies'' (2nd Edition), p. 297 (pub: John Wiley and Sons, [[Chichester]], England) ISBN 978-0-470-03537-5&lt;/ref&gt; and later for the Little Rock Rugby club in Arkansas. While at Oxford he also participated in [[Vietnam War]] [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|protests]] and organized an October 1969 [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Moratorium]] event.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;

Clinton's political opponents charge that to avoid being [[Conscription|drafted]] into the [[Vietnam War]] during his college years, he used the political influence of a U.S. Senator, who employed him as an [[Congressional staff|aide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/clinton/etc/draftletter.html |title=Bill Clinton's Draft Letter |work=[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]] | publisher=PBS |date=November 23, 1991 |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Col. Eugene Holmes, an Army officer who was involved in Clinton's case, issued a [[notarize]]d statement during the 1992 presidential campaign: &quot;I was informed by the draft board that it was of interest to Senator Fullbright's office that Bill Clinton, a Rhodes Scholar, should be admitted to the [[ROTC]] program... I believe that he purposely deceived me, using the possibility of joining the ROTC as a ploy to work with the draft board to delay his induction and get a new draft classification.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris1999&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Roger|title=Partners in Power: The Clintons and Their America|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Vq96BQV5lF4C&amp;pg=PA100|accessdate=August 17, 2011|date=April 25, 1999|publisher=Regnery Publishing|isbn=978-0-89526-302-5|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Metcalf2002&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Metcalf|first=Geoffrey M.|title=In the Arena: Geoff Metcalf Interviews With Doers of Deeds|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=_pcTJ0uTg_gC&amp;pg=PA561|accessdate=August 17, 2011|date=November 28, 2002|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=978-0-595-25752-2|page=561}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although legal, Clinton's actions were criticized by conservatives and some Vietnam veterans during his presidential campaign in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John D.

Dennison |title=The Vietnam Draft |publisher=25thaviation.org |accessdate=August 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Oxford, Clinton attended [[Yale Law School]] and earned a [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) degree in 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt; In a Yale library in 1971 he met fellow law student [[Hillary Rodham Clinton|Hillary Rodham]], who was a year ahead of him.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRCBio&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/about/first-ladies/hillaryclinton |title=Hillary Rodham Clinton |publisher=The White House |accessdate=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; They began dating and soon were inseparable. After only about a month, Clinton postponed his plans to be a coordinator for the [[George McGovern presidential campaign, 1972|McGovern campaign]] for the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 United States presidential election]] in order to move in with her in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nysun.com/national/clintons-berkeley-summer-of-love/66982/ |title=The Clintons' Berkeley Summer of Love |author=Gerstein, Josh |work=The New York Sun |date=November 26, 2007 |accessdate=May 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later married on October 11, 1975, and their only child, [[Chelsea Clinton|Chelsea]], was born on February 27, 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRCBio&quot; /&gt;

Clinton did eventually move to Texas with Rodham to take a job leading [[George McGovern|McGovern]]'s effort there in 1972. He spent considerable time in [[Dallas]], at the campaign's local headquarters on Lemmon Avenue, where he had an office. There, Clinton worked with future two-term [[List of mayors of Dallas|mayor of Dallas]], [[Ron Kirk]], future [[List of Governors of Texas|governor of Texas]], [[Ann Richards]], and then unknown television director (and future filmmaker), [[Steven Spielberg]].

===Governor of Arkansas===
{{Further|Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1978|Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1980|Arkansas gubernatorial election, 1982}}
After graduating from Yale Law School, Clinton returned to Arkansas and became a law professor at the [[University of Arkansas]]. A year later, he ran for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 1974. The incumbent, Republican [[John Paul Hammerschmidt]], defeated Clinton in the general election by a 52% to 48% margin. With only minor opposition in the primary and no opposition at all in the general election,&lt;ref name=AllPolitics1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://cgi.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1996/candidates/democrat/clinton/political.career.shtml |newspaper=CNN: AllPolitics |title=Bill Clinton Political Career |year=1997 |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton was elected [[Arkansas Attorney General]] in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;

[[File:Bill Clinton 1978.jpg|thumb|left|Clinton, as the newly elected [[Governor of Arkansas]], meeting with President [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1978]]
Clinton was elected [[Governor of Arkansas]] in 1978, having defeated the Republican candidate [[Lynn Lowe]], a farmer from [[Texarkana, Arkansas|Texarkana]]. He became the youngest governor in the country at 32. Due to his youthful appearance, Clinton was often called the &quot;Boy Governor&quot;, a referent that continues to be used to refer to him during his gubernatorial era on occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/opinion/12wed4.html |title=Bill and Hillary Clinton's Pitch in Iowa: 'I Love the '90s' |newspaper=The New York Times |author=Adam Cohen |date=December 12, 2007 |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Boy Clinton: The Political Biography |author=R.

However, his term included an unpopular motor vehicle tax and citizens' anger over the escape of [[Cuba]]n refugees (from the [[Mariel boatlift]]) detained in [[Fort Chaffee]] in 1980. [[Monroe Schwarzlose]] of [[Kingsland, Arkansas|Kingsland]] in [[Cleveland County, Arkansas|Cleveland County]], polled 31% of the vote against Clinton in the Democratic gubernatorial primary of 1980. Some suggested Schwarzlose's unexpected voter turnout foreshadowed Clinton's defeat in the general election that year by [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] challenger [[Frank D. White]]. As Clinton once joked, he was the youngest ex-governor in the nation's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;

Clinton joined friend [[Bruce Lindsey]]'s Little Rock law firm of Wright, Lindsey and Jennings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bill Clinton Timeline |author=Jonathan W. Nicholsen |url=http://www.timeline-help.com/bill-clinton-timeline.html |publisher=Timeline Help |accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, he was again elected governor and kept this job for ten years.&lt;ref name=AllPolitics1 /&gt; He helped Arkansas transform its economy and significantly improve the state's educational system. He became a leading figure among the [[New Democrats]].&lt;ref name= 'The Natural'&gt;{{Cite book|last=Klein |first=Joe |title=The Natural: The Misunderstood Presidency of Bill Clinton |publisher=Doubleday |year=2002 |isbn=0-7679-1412-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dlc.org/ndol_ci.cfm?kaid=127&amp;subid=173&amp;contentid=252794 |title=Bill Clinton, New Democrat |publisher=DLC |date=July 25, 2004 |accessdate=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Democrats, organized as the [[Democratic Leadership Council|Democratic Leadership Council (DLC)]], were a branch of the Democratic Party that called for welfare reform and smaller government, a policy supported by both Democrats and Republicans. He gave the [[Democratic response to the State of the Union address|Democratic response]] to President Reagan's [[1985 State of the Union Address]] and served as Chair of the [[National Governors Association]] from 1986 to 1987, bringing him to an audience beyond Arkansas.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt; Clinton made economic growth, job creation and educational improvement high priorities. For [[senior citizens]], he removed the [[sales tax]] from medications and increased the home property-tax exemption.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot; /&gt;

In the early 1980s, Clinton made reform of the Arkansas education system a top priority. The Arkansas Education Standards Committee, chaired by Clinton's wife, attorney and [[Legal Services Corporation]] chair [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], succeeded in reforming the education system, transforming it from the worst in the nation into one of the best. Many have considered this the greatest achievement of the Clinton governorship. Clinton and the committee were responsible for state educational improvement programs, notably more spending for schools, rising opportunities for gifted children, an increase in vocational education, raising of teachers' salaries, inclusion of a wider variety of courses, and compulsory teacher testing for aspiring educators.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Natural&quot; /&gt; He defeated four Republican candidates for governor: Lowe (1978), White (1982 and 1986), and businessmen [[Woody Freeman]] of [[Jonesboro, Arkansas|Jonesboro]], (1984) and [[Sheffield Nelson]] of Little Rock (1990).&lt;ref name=AllPolitics1 /&gt;

In 1987, there was media speculation Clinton would enter the race after then-[[Governor of New York|New York Governor]] [[Mario Cuomo]] declined to run and Democratic front-runner [[Gary Hart]] withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity.

==1992 presidential campaign==

In the first primary contest, the [[Iowa caucus]], Clinton finished a distant third to Iowa Senator [[Tom Harkin]]. During the campaign for the [[New Hampshire primary]], reports of an extramarital affair with [[Gennifer Flowers]] surfaced. As Clinton fell far behind former [[Massachusetts]] Senator [[Paul Tsongas]] in the New Hampshire polls,&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt; following [[Super Bowl XXVI]], Clinton and his wife Hillary went on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' to rebuff the charges. Their television appearance was a calculated risk, but Clinton regained several delegates. He finished second to Tsongas in the [[New Hampshire Democratic primary, 1992|New Hampshire primary]], but after trailing badly in the polls and coming within single digits of winning, the media viewed it as a victory. News outlets labeled him &quot;The Comeback Kid&quot; for earning a firm second-place finish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2001-01-11/politics/clinton.nh_1_president-clinton-new-hampshire-bill-clinton?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS |title=Clinton thanks New Hampshire for making him the 'Comeback Kid' |date=January 11, 2001 |accessdate=August 30, 2011 |publisher=CNN }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winning the big prizes of Florida and Texas and many of the [[Southern United States|Southern primaries]] on [[Super Tuesday]] gave Clinton a sizable delegate lead. However, former California Governor [[Jerry Brown]] was scoring victories and Clinton had yet to win a significant contest outside his native South.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Choice&quot; /&gt; With no major Southern state remaining, Clinton targeted New York, which had many delegates. He scored a resounding victory in New York City, shedding his image as a regional candidate.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Choice&quot; /&gt; Having been transformed into the consensus candidate, he secured the Democratic Party nomination, finishing with a victory in [[Jerry Brown]]'s home state of California.&lt;ref name=&quot;First In His Class&quot;/&gt;

During the campaign, questions of [[conflict of interest]] regarding state business and the politically powerful [[Rose Law Firm]], at which Hillary Rodham Clinton was a partner, arose. Clinton argued the questions were moot because all transactions with the state had been deducted before determining Hillary's firm pay.&lt;ref name=&quot;My Life&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Ifill |first=Gwen |title=Hillary Clinton Defends Her Conduct in Law Firm |work=The New York Times |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/17/us/the-1992-campaign-hillary-clinton-defends-her-conduct-in-law-firm.html |date=March 17, 1992 |accessdate=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further concern arose when Bill Clinton announced that, with Hillary, voters would be getting two presidents &quot;for the price of one&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=MacGillis|first=Alec |last2=Kornblut |first2=Anne E. |title=Hillary Clinton Embraces Her Husband's Legacy |work=The Washington Post |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/21/AR2007122102588.html |page=A1|date=December 21, 2007 |accessdate=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While campaigning for U.S. President, the then Governor Clinton returned to Arkansas to see that [[Ricky Ray Rector]] would be executed. After killing a police officer and a civilian, Rector shot himself in the head, leading to what his lawyers said was a state where he could still talk but did not understand the idea of death. According to Arkansas state and Federal law, a seriously mentally impaired inmate cannot be executed. The courts disagreed with the allegation of grave mental impairment and allowed the execution. Clinton's return to Arkansas for the execution was framed in a ''[[The New York Times]]'' article as a possible political move to counter &quot;soft on crime&quot; accusations.&lt;ref name = &quot;mbsrgd&quot;&gt;[[George Stephanopoulos]], ''All Too Human: A Political Education'', 1999, ISBN 978-0-316-92919-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Applebome|first=Peter|title=Arkansas Execution Raises Questions on Governor's Politics|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/01/25/us/1992-campaign-death-penalty-arkansas-execution-raises-questions-governor-s.html |work=The New York Times|date=January 25, 1992|accessdate=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because Bush's [[United States Presidential approval rating|approval ratings]] were in the 80% range during the [[Gulf War]], he was described as unbeatable. However, when Bush compromised with Democrats to try to lower Federal deficits, he reneged on his [[Read my lips: no new taxes|promise not to raise taxes]], hurting his approval rating.

Clinton was inaugurated as the 42nd President of the United States on January 20, 1993.

On February 15, 1993, Clinton made his first address to the nation, announcing his plan to raise taxes to cap the [[budget deficit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1993/02/15/us/white-house-hones-all-out-campaign-to-sell-sacrifice.html?scp=3&amp;sq=bill+clinton&amp;st=nyt |title=White House Hones All-Out Campaign to Sell Sacrifice |newspaper=The New York Times |date=February 15, 1993 |author=Richard L.

On May 19, 1993, Clinton fired seven employees of the White House Travel Office, causing [[White House travel office controversy|a controversy]] even though the Travel Office staff served at the pleasure of the President, who could dismiss them without cause. The White House responded to the controversy by claiming the firings were done because of financial improprieties that had been revealed by a brief FBI investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], ''[[Living History]]'', [[Simon &amp; Schuster]], 2003, ISBN 0-7432-2224-5, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics contended the firings had been done to allow friends of the Clintons to take over the travel business and that the involvement of the FBI was unwarranted.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ken Gormley (academic)|Ken Gormley]], ''The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr'', [[Crown Publishers]] (New York), 2010.

Clinton made a major speech to Congress regarding [[Clinton health care plan|a health care reform plan]] on September 22, 1993, aimed at achieving universal coverage through a national health care plan. This was one of the most prominent items on Clinton's legislative agenda, and resulted from a task force headed by [[Hillary Clinton]]. Though at first well received in political circles, it was eventually doomed by well-organized opposition from conservatives, the [[American Medical Association]], and the health insurance industry. However, [[John F. Harris]], a biographer of Clinton's, states the program failed because of a lack of coordination within the [[White House]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt; Despite the Democratic majority in Congress, the effort to create a national health care system ultimately died when compromise legislation by [[George J.

In November 1993, [[David Hale (Whitewater)|David Hale]], the source of criminal allegations against Bill Clinton in the [[Whitewater controversy|Whitewater affair]], alleged that Clinton, while governor of Arkansas, pressured him to provide an illegal $300,000 loan to Susan McDougal, the partner of the Clintons in the Whitewater land deal.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon031798&quot;&gt;Jonathan Broder; [[Murray Waas]], [http://www.salon.com/news/1998/03/cov_17news.html &quot;The road to Hale&quot;], [[Salon.com|Salon]], March 17, 1998.

Clinton signed the [[Brady Bill]] into law on November 30, 1993, which imposed a five-day waiting period on handgun purchases. He also expanded the [[Earned Income Tax Credit]], a subsidy for low-income workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Survivor&quot; /&gt;

In December of that year, allegations by Arkansas state troopers [[Larry Patterson]] and Roger Perry were first reported by [[David Brock]] in [[the American Spectator]].

On January 1, 1994, Clinton signed the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] into law.&lt;ref name=NAFTA&gt;Livingston, C. Don, Kenneth A. Wink; &quot;The Passage of the North American Free Trade Agreement in the U.S. House of Representatives: Presidential Leadership or Presidential Luck?&quot; Presidential Studies Quarterly, Vol. 27, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout his first year in office, Clinton consistently supported ratification of the treaty by the U.S. Senate. Clinton and most of his allies in the Democratic Leadership Committee strongly supported free trade measures; there remained, however, strong disagreement within the party. Opposition came chiefly from anti-trade Republicans, protectionist Democrats and supporters of [[Ross Perot]]. The bill passed the house with 234 votes against 200 opposed (132 Republicans and 102 Democrats voting in favor; 156 Democrats, 43 Republicans, and 1 independent against). The treaty was then ratified by the Senate and signed into law by the President.&lt;ref name=NAFTA /&gt;

Clinton's 1994 Omnibus Crime Bill made many changes to U.S. law, including the expansion of the death penalty to include crimes not resulting in death, such as running a large-scale drug enterprise. During Clinton's re-election campaign he said, &quot;My 1994 crime bill expanded the death penalty for drug kingpins, murderers of federal law enforcement officers, and nearly 60 additional categories of violent felons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Clinton|url=http://www.4to40.com/legends/print.asp?p=Bill_Clinton|publisher=4to40.com |accessdate=November 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton was scheduled to visit a local politician in central Manila, when secret service officers intercepted a message suggesting that an attack was imminent. A transmission used the words &quot;bridge&quot; and &quot;wedding&quot;, supposedly a terrorist's code words for assassination. The motorcade was re-routed and the US agents later discovered a bomb planted under the bridge.

On September 21, 1996, barely three years after the &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; imbroglio, and further straining relations with the [[LGBT community]], Clinton signed into law the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), which defines marriage as the legal union of one man and one woman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ199/content-detail.html U.S. Government Printing Office:  PUBLIC LAW 104 - 199 - DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Paul Yandura]], speaking for the White House gay and lesbian liaison office, said that Clinton's signing of DOMA &quot;was a political decision that they made at the time of a re-election.&quot;  Administration spokesman [[Richard Socarides]] said, &quot;... the alternatives we knew were going to be far worse, and it was time to move on and get the president re-elected.&quot;&lt;ref name=metroweekly&gt;[http://www.metroweekly.com/feature/?ak=6613 ''MetroWeekly'': Chris Geidner, &quot;Becoming Law,&quot; September 29, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;  Clinton himself stated that DOMA was something &quot;which the Republicans put on the ballot to try to get the base vote for President Bush up, I think it’s obvious that something had to be done to try to keep the Republican Congress from presenting that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/news/frank-rich/bill-clinton-doma-2012-3/ ''New York Magazine'': Frank Rich, &quot;Bill Clinton’s shifting justifications for signing the Defense of Marriage Act&quot;, February 26, 2012 ]&lt;/ref&gt; Others were more critical.

While the [[House Judiciary Committee]] hearings ended in a straight party-line vote, there was lively debate on the House floor. The two charges passed in the House (largely with Republican support, but with a handful of Democratic votes as well) were for [[perjury]] and [[obstruction of justice]]. The perjury charge arose from Clinton's testimony about his relationship to Lewinsky during a sexual harassment lawsuit&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/pjones/pjones.htm |title=Case Closed |author=Dan Froomkin |work=The Washington Post | date=August 26, 1999 | accessdate=August 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; brought by former Arkansas state employee [[Paula Jones]].

Many military events occurred during Clinton's presidency.
The [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] also occurred in [[Somalia]] in 1993. During the operation, [[MH-60 Black Hawk|two U.S. helicopters]] were shot down by [[rocket-propelled grenade]] attacks to their [[tail rotor]]s, trapping soldiers behind enemy lines. This resulted in an urban battle that killed 18 American soldiers, wounded 73 others, and one was taken prisoner. There were many more Somali casualties. Some of the American bodies were dragged through the streets&amp;nbsp;– a spectacle broadcast on television news programs. In response, U.S. forces were withdrawn from Somalia and later conflicts were approached with fewer soldiers on the ground.

In 1995, U.S. and [[NATO]] aircraft [[1995 NATO bombing campaign in Bosnia and Herzegovina|attacked Bosnian Serb targets]] to halt attacks on U.N. safe zones and to pressure them into a peace accord. Clinton deployed U.S. peacekeepers to Bosnia in late 1995, to uphold the subsequent [[Dayton Agreement]].

{{quote|Together we must also confront the new hazards of [[chemical weapon|chemical]] and [[biological weapon]]s, and the outlaw states, terrorists and organized criminals seeking to acquire them. Saddam Hussein has spent the better part of this decade, and much of his nation's wealth, not on providing for the Iraqi people, but on developing nuclear, chemical and biological weapons and the missiles to deliver them. The United Nations weapons inspectors have done a truly remarkable job, finding and destroying more of Iraq's arsenal than was destroyed during the entire gulf war. Now, Saddam Hussein wants to stop them from completing their mission. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber, Republicans and Democrats, when I say to Saddam Hussein, &quot;You cannot defy the will of the world&quot;, and when I say to him, &quot;You have used weapons of mass destruction before; we are determined to deny you the capacity to use them again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Text of President Clinton's 1998 State of the Union Address |date=January 27, 1998 |author=Bill Clinton |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/states/docs/sou98.htm |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=August 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

To weaken Saddam Hussein's grip of power, Clinton signed H.R. 4655 into law on October 31, 1998, which instituted a policy of &quot;regime change&quot; against Iraq, though it explicitly stated it did not provide for direct intervention on the part of American military forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070218092435/http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/libera.htm Iraq Liberation Act of 1998], H.R.4655, One Hundred Fifth Congress of United States of America at Second Session; Library of Congress.
