His biography on the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) website states, &quot;By acclamation, Michael Jordan is the greatest basketball player of all time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nbah&quot;/&gt;  Jordan was one of the most effectively marketed athletes of his generation and was considered instrumental in popularizing the NBA around the world in the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Markovits, Andrei S. and Lars Rensman. [http://books.google.com/books?id=o2QpA0fGyiIC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=isbn%3A069113751X&amp;pg=PA89#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Gaming the World: How Sports are Reshaping Global Politics and Culture''].

After a three-season career at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he was a member of the Tar Heels' [[1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|national championship]] team in 1982, Jordan joined the NBA's [[Chicago Bulls]] in [[1984 NBA Draft|1984]]. He quickly emerged as a league star, entertaining crowds with his prolific scoring. His leaping ability, illustrated by performing [[slam dunk]]s from the [[free throw line]] in [[slam dunk contest]]s, earned him the nicknames &quot;'''Air Jordan'''&quot; and &quot;'''His Airness'''&quot;. He also gained a reputation for being one of the best defensive players in basketball.&lt;ref name=&quot;defensive players&quot;/&gt; In [[1991 NBA Finals|1991]], he won his first NBA championship with the Bulls, and followed that achievement with titles in [[1992 NBA Finals|1992]] and [[1993 NBA Finals|1993]], securing a &quot;[[three-peat]]&quot;. Although Jordan abruptly retired from basketball at the beginning of the [[1993–94 NBA season]] to pursue a career in baseball, he rejoined the Bulls in [[1995–96 NBA season|1995]] and led them to three additional championships ([[1996 NBA Finals|1996]], [[1997 NBA Finals|1997]], and [[1998 NBA Finals|1998]]) as well as an NBA-record [[List of NBA teams by single season win percentage|72 regular-season wins]] in the 1995–96 NBA season. Jordan retired for a second time in [[1998–99 NBA season|1999]], but returned for two more NBA seasons from 2001 to 2003 as a member of the [[Washington Wizards]].

Jordan's individual accolades and accomplishments include five [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] awards, ten [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA]] First Team designations, nine [[NBA All-Defensive Team|All-Defensive]] First Team honors, fourteen [[NBA All-Star Game]] appearances, three All-Star Game [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|MVP]] awards, ten [[List of National Basketball Association season scoring leaders|scoring titles]], three [[steal (basketball)|steals]] titles, six [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals MVP awards]], and the 1988 [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year Award]]. He holds the NBA records for highest career regular season scoring average (30.12 points per game) and highest career playoff scoring average (33.45 points per game). In 1999, he was named the greatest North American athlete of the 20th century by [[ESPN]], and was second to [[Babe Ruth]] on the [[Associated Press]]'s list of athletes of the century. He was inducted into the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 2009.

Jordan is also noted for his product endorsements. He fueled the success of [[Nike, Inc.|Nike's]] [[Air Jordan]] sneakers, which were introduced in 1985 and remain popular today.&lt;ref name=&quot;remain popular&quot;/&gt; Jordan also starred in the 1996 feature film ''[[Space Jam]]'' as himself. He is the majority owner and head of basketball operations for the NBA's [[Charlotte Bobcats]], having won a bidding war to buy controlling interest in the team from founding owner [[Robert L. Johnson]].

== Early years ==
[[File:Michael Jordan UNC Jersey cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Michael Jordan's jersey in the rafters of The [[Dean Smith Center]]]]
Jordan was born in [[Brooklyn]], New York, the son of Deloris (née Peoples), who worked in banking, and [[James R. Jordan, Sr.]], an equipment supervisor. His family moved to [[Wilmington, North Carolina|Wilmington]], North Carolina, when he was a toddler.&lt;ref name=&quot;a toddler&quot;/&gt; Jordan attended [[Emsley A. Laney High School]] in Wilmington, where he anchored his athletic career by playing baseball, [[American football|football]], and basketball. He tried out for the [[varsity team|varsity]] basketball team during his [[Tenth grade|sophomore]] year, but at 5'11&quot; (1.80&amp;nbsp;m), he was deemed too short to play at that level. His taller friend, [[Harvest Smith|Harvest Leroy Smith]], was the only sophomore to make the team.&lt;ref name=&quot;halb&quot;/&gt;

Motivated to prove his worth, Jordan became the star of Laney's [[junior varsity]] squad, and tallied several 40 point games.&lt;ref name=halb/&gt; The following summer, he grew four inches (10&amp;nbsp;cm)&lt;ref name=&quot;nbah&quot;/&gt; and trained rigorously. Upon earning a spot on the varsity [[roster]], Jordan averaged about 20 points per game over his final two seasons of high school play.&lt;ref name=&quot;br&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BB&quot;/&gt; As a [[Twelfth grade|senior]], he was selected to the [[McDonald's All-American Team]]&lt;ref name=&quot;McDonald's&quot;/&gt; after averaging a [[triple-double]]: 29.2 points, 11.6 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]], and 10.1 [[assist (basketball)|assists]].&lt;ref name=&quot;triple-double&quot;/&gt;

In 1981, Jordan earned a basketball scholarship to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]], where he [[College major|majored]] in [[cultural geography]]. As a freshman in coach [[Dean Smith]]'s team-oriented system, he was named [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] Freshman of the Year after he averaged 13.4 [[points per game]] (ppg) on 53.4% shooting ([[field goal percentage]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;dbb&quot;/&gt; He made the game-winning jump shot in the [[1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament#Championship game|1982 NCAA Championship]] game against [[Georgetown Hoyas|Georgetown]], which was led by future NBA rival [[Patrick Ewing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nbah&quot;/&gt; Jordan later described this shot as the major turning point in his basketball career.&lt;ref&gt;qtd. in Lazenby, Roland. &quot;Michaelangelo: Portrait of a Champion&quot;. ''Michael Jordan: The Ultimate Career Tribute''. Bannockburn, IL: H&amp;S Media, 1999. pg. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; During his three seasons at North Carolina, he averaged 17.7 ppg on 54.0% shooting, and added 5.0 [[rebounds per game]] (rpg).&lt;ref name=&quot;br&quot; /&gt;  He was selected by consensus to the [[1983 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|NCAA All-American First Team]] in both his sophomore (1983) and junior (1984) seasons. After winning the [[Naismith College Player of the Year|Naismith]] and the [[John R. Wooden Award|Wooden]] College Player of the Year awards in 1984, Jordan left North Carolina one year before his scheduled graduation to enter the [[1984 NBA Draft]]. The [[Chicago Bulls]] selected Jordan with the third overall pick, after [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] ([[Houston Rockets]]) and [[Sam Bowie]] ([[Portland Trail Blazers]]). Jordan returned to North Carolina to complete his degree in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Mike. &quot;The Legend: A Highlight-Reel History of the NBA's Greatest Player&quot;. ''Michael Jordan: The Ultimate Career Tribute''. Bannockburn, IL: H&amp;S Media, 1999. pg. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jordan's [[1985–86 NBA season|second season]] was cut short by a broken foot which caused him to miss 64 games.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbah&quot;/&gt; Despite Jordan's injury and a 30–52 record,&lt;ref name=&quot;dbbulls&quot;/&gt; the Bulls made the [[1986 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]]. Jordan recovered in time to participate in the playoffs and performed well upon his return. Against a 1985–86 [[Boston Celtics]] team that is often considered one of the greatest in NBA history,&lt;ref name=&quot;topteams&quot;&gt;[http://www.nba.com/history/toptenteams_index.html Top 10 Teams in NBA History], nba.com/history.

Retrieved January 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Celtics, however, managed to sweep the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;nba.combio&quot;/&gt;

Jordan had recovered completely by the [[1986–87 NBA season|1986–87 season]], and had one of the most prolific scoring seasons in NBA history. He became the only player other than [[Wilt Chamberlain]] to score 3,000 points in a season, averaging a league high 37.1 points on 48.2% shooting.&lt;ref name=&quot;dbb&quot;/&gt; In addition, Jordan demonstrated his defensive prowess, as he became the first player in NBA history to record 200 steals and 100 [[block (basketball)|blocks]] in a season. Despite Jordan's success, [[Magic Johnson]] won the league's [[National Basketball Association Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player Award]]. The Bulls reached 40 wins,&lt;ref name=&quot;dbbulls&quot;/&gt; and advanced to [[1987 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] for the third consecutive year. However, they were again swept by the Celtics.&lt;ref name=&quot;nba.combio&quot;/&gt;

=== Mid-career: Pistons roadblock ===
Jordan led the league in scoring again in the [[1987–88 NBA season|1987–88 season]], averaging 35.0 ppg on 53.5% shooting&lt;ref name=&quot;dbb&quot;/&gt; and won his first league [[NBA Most Valuable Player award|MVP award]]. He was also named the [[NBA Defensive Player of the Year|Defensive Player of the Year]], as he had averaged 1.6 blocks and a league high 3.16 steals per game.&lt;ref name=&quot;MJ&quot;&gt;[http://www.nba.com/history/players/jordan_stats.html Michael Jordan statistics], nba.com/history.

Retrieved January 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Bulls then lost in five games to the more experienced [[Detroit Pistons]],&lt;ref name=&quot;nba.combio&quot;/&gt; who were led by [[Isiah Thomas]] and a group of physical players known as the &quot;[[Detroit Pistons#1980s: The Bad Boys era|Bad Boys]]&quot;.

In the [[1988–89 NBA season|1988–89 season]], Jordan again led the league in scoring, averaging 32.5 ppg on 53.8% shooting from the field, along with 8 rpg and 8 [[assists per game]] (apg).&lt;ref name=&quot;dbb&quot;/&gt; The Bulls finished with a 47–35 record,&lt;ref name=&quot;dbbulls&quot;/&gt; and advanced to the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] Finals, defeating the Cavaliers and [[New York Knicks]] along the way. The Cavaliers series included a career highlight for Jordan when he hit ''[[The Shot]]'' over [[Craig Ehlo]] at the buzzer in the fifth and final game of the series.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/history/jordancav_moments.html Jordan Hits &quot;The Shot&quot;], nba.com/history, accessed May 24, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Pistons again defeated the Bulls, this time in six games,&lt;ref name=&quot;nba.combio&quot;/&gt; by utilizing their &quot;[[Jordan Rules]]&quot; method of guarding Jordan, which consisted of [[double team|double and triple teaming]] him every time he touched the ball.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbah&quot;/&gt;

The Bulls entered the [[1989–90 NBA season|1989–90 season]] as a team on the rise, with their core group of Jordan and young improving players like [[Scottie Pippen]] and [[Horace Grant]], and under the guidance of new coach [[Phil Jackson]]. Jordan averaged a league leading 33.6 ppg on 52.6% shooting, to go with 6.9 rpg and 6.3 apg&lt;ref name=&quot;dbb&quot;/&gt; in leading the Bulls to a 55–27 record.&lt;ref name=&quot;dbbulls&quot;/&gt; They again advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals beating the Bucks and [[Philadelphia 76ers]] en route. However, despite pushing the series to seven games, the Bulls lost to the Pistons for the third consecutive season.&lt;ref name=&quot;nba.combio&quot;/&gt;

=== First three-peat ===
In the [[1990–91 NBA season|1990–91 season]], Jordan won his second MVP award after averaging 31.5 ppg on 53.9% shooting, 6.0 rpg, and 5.5 apg for the regular season.&lt;ref name=&quot;dbb&quot;/&gt; The Bulls finished in first place in their division for the first time in 16 years and set a franchise record with 61 wins in the regular season.&lt;ref name=&quot;dbbulls&quot;/&gt; With [[Scottie Pippen]] developing into an All-Star, the Bulls had elevated their play. The Bulls defeated the [[New York Knicks]] and the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the opening two rounds of [[1991 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]]. They advanced to the Eastern Conference Finals where their rival, the Detroit Pistons, awaited them.

Jordan's basketball talent was clear from his rookie season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gross&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Garden&quot;/&gt; In his first game in [[Madison Square Garden]] against the New York Knicks, Jordan received a prolonged standing ovation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Garden&quot;/&gt; a rarity for an opposing player.

Jordan led the NBA in scoring in 10 seasons (NBA record) and tied [[Wilt Chamberlain]]'s record of seven consecutive scoring titles. He was also a fixture on the NBA All-Defensive First Team, making the roster nine times (NBA record shared with [[Gary Payton]]). Jordan also holds the top career regular season and playoff scoring averages of 30.1 and 33.4 points per game,&lt;ref name=&quot;nbah&quot;/&gt; respectively. By 1998, the season of his Finals-winning shot against the Jazz, he was well known throughout the league as a [[clutch (sports)|clutch performer]]. In the regular season, Jordan was the Bulls' primary threat in the final seconds of a close game and in the playoffs, Jordan would always demand the ball at crunch time.&lt;ref&gt;Sachare, Alex.
