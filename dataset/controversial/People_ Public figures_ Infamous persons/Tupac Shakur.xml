'''Tupac Amaru Shakur''' (June 16, 1971 – September 13, 1996), known by his stage names '''2Pac''' and '''Makaveli''', was an American [[rapping|rapper]] and [[actor]].&lt;ref&gt;Levs, Joshua.

Shakur began his career as a [[Road crew|roadie]], [[backup dancer]], and MC for the [[alternative hip hop]] group [[Digital Underground]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TSTA&quot;&gt;{{cite video|title=Tupac Shakur – Thug Angel (The Life of an Outlaw)|date=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TSHSD&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hotshotdigital.com/tribute/TupacShakur.html |title=Tupac Shakur |publisher=Hotshotdigital.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HTP-330&quot;&gt;Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both of his parents and several other family members were members of the [[Black Panther Party]]. Shakur was involved in an East Coast-West Coast rivalry after a major feud with East Coast rappers, producers and record-label staff members, most notably [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] and [[Bad Boy Records]].&lt;ref&gt;Jay-Z: ''Essays on Hip Hop's Philosopher King'', p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 7, 1996, Shakur was shot four times in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. He was taken to the [[University Medical Center of Southern Nevada|Southern Nevada University Medical Center]], where he died six days later.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSDCD&quot;&gt;[http://www.numberonestars.com/tupacshakur/tupacdeathcertificatedetails.htm Tupac Shakur's death certificate details] reported by [[Cathy Scott]].

&lt;!-- Please do not change the location of birth without discussing it on the talk page first --&gt;
[[File:Eastharlem01.jpg|thumb|250px|[[East Harlem]] neighborhood of New York City, where Shakur was born]]
Tupac Amaru Shakur was born in the [[East Harlem]] section of [[Manhattan]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Hoye|2006|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named after [[Túpac Amaru II|Túpac Amaru]],&lt;ref&gt;John Crow &quot;The Epic of America&quot;, page 408.&lt;/ref&gt; a Peruvian revolutionary who led an [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]] uprising against Spain and was subsequently executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/2c/Col&amp;NeoColonLatAmSCline034.pdf |title=Colonial and Neocolonial Latin America (1750–1900) |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His mother, [[Afeni Shakur]], and his father, Billy Garland, were active members of the [[Black Panther Party]] in New York in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The infant boy was born a month after his mother was acquitted of more than 150 charges of &quot;Conspiracy against the United States government and New York landmarks&quot; in the New York &quot;Panther 21&quot; court case.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.2paclegacy.com/images/assets/bio_afeni_shakur/afeni_shakur_biography.pdf|format=PDF|title=Afeni Shakur|publisher=2Pac Legacy |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080409074113/http://www.2paclegacy.com/images/assets/bio_afeni_shakur/afeni_shakur_biography.pdf |archivedate =2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although unconfirmed by the Shakur family, several sources (including the official coroner's report) list his birth name as '''Lesane Parish Crooks'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cathyscott1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Tupac Coroner's Report|url=http://www.cathyscott.com/artcls/Tupac%20Coroners%20Report.html|publisher=[[Cathy Scott]]|accessdate=2007-07-24|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110723212104/http://www.cathyscott.com/artcls/Tupac%20Coroners%20Report.html|archivedate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name was supposedly entered on the birth certificate because Afeni feared her enemies would attack her son, and disguised his true identity using a different last name. She changed it later, following her separation from Garland and marriage to [[Mutulu Shakur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.2pac2k.de/name.html|title=2Pac's Name – Tupac Amaru Shakur – Lesane Parish Crooks |publisher=2Pac2K.de |accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakur lived from an early age with people who were struggling and who were imprisoned. His godfather, [[Geronimo Pratt|Elmer &quot;Geronimo&quot; Pratt]], a high ranking [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther]], was convicted of murdering a school teacher during a 1968 robbery, although his sentence was later overturned. His stepfather, Mutulu, spent four years at large on the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, 1980s|FBI's Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] list beginning in 1982. Mutulu was wanted for having helped his sister [[Assata Shakur]] (also known as Joanne Chesimard) to escape from a penitentiary in New Jersey. She had been imprisoned for killing a [[State police|state trooper]] in 1973. Mutulu was caught in 1986 and imprisoned for the [[Brinks robbery (1981)|robbery of a Brinks armored truck]] in which two police officers and a guard were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;labyrinth&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Labyrinth: A Detective Investigates the Murders of Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G., the Implication of Death Row Records' Suge Knight, and the Origins of the Los Angeles Police Scandal |author=Sullivan, Randall|publisher=Grove Press|date=January 3, 2003|isbn=0-8021-3971-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakur had a half-sister, Sekyiwa, two years his junior, and an older stepbrother, [[Mopreme Shakur|Mopreme &quot;Komani&quot; Shakur]], who appeared in many of his recordings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2010/06/15/22267493.aspx|title=Exclusive: Mopreme Shakur Talks Tupac; Rapper's B-Day Celebrated|publisher=[[AllHipHop|Allhiphop.com]] |accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of twelve, Shakur enrolled in [[Harlem]]'s [[127th Street Repertory Ensemble]] and was cast as the Travis Younger character in the play ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'', which was performed at the [[Apollo Theater]].&lt;!--expand if possible--&gt; In 1986, the family relocated to [[Baltimore]], Maryland.&lt;ref name=&quot;vibe&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |coauthors= |year=1999 |month=October |title=Back 2 the Essence: Friends and Families Reminisce over Hip-hop's Fallen Sons |journal=[[Vibe (magazine)|Vibe]] |volume=7 |issue=8 |pages=100–116 |page=103 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=MSgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=Tupac+moved+Baltimore+Marin-City&amp;q=Tupac%20moved%20Baltimore%20Marin-City |accessdate=2009-09-03 |publisher=Vibe Media Group |author1= Group, Vibe Media |ref= harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing his second year at [[Paul Laurence Dunbar High School (Baltimore, Maryland)|Paul Laurence Dunbar High School]], he transferred to the [[Baltimore School for the Arts]], where he studied acting, poetry, [[jazz]], and ballet. He performed in [[Shakespeare's plays|Shakespeare plays]], and in the role of the Mouse King in ''[[The Nutcracker]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;labyrinth&quot;/&gt; Shakur, accompanied by one of his friends, Dana &quot;Mouse&quot; Smith, as his [[beatbox]], won many rap competitions and was considered to be the best rapper in his school.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bastfield|2002|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was remembered as one of the most popular kids in his school because of his sense of humor, superior rapping skills, and ability to mix with all crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Bastfield|2002|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed a close friendship with a young [[Jada Pinkett Smith|Jada Pinkett]] (later Jada Pinkett Smith) that lasted until his death. 

In the documentary ''[[Tupac: Resurrection]]'', Shakur says, &quot;Jada is my heart. She will be my friend for my whole life.&quot; Pinkett Smith calls him &quot;one of my best friends. He was like a brother. It was beyond friendship for us. The type of relationship we had, you only get that once in a lifetime.&quot; A poem written by Shakur titled &quot;Jada&quot; appears in his book, ''The Rose That Grew From Concrete'', which also includes a poem dedicated to Pinkett Smith called &quot;The Tears in Cupid's Eyes&quot;. During his time in art school, Shakur became affiliated with the Baltimore [[Young Communist League USA]],&lt;ref&gt;Farrar, Jordan.

In June 1988, Shakur and his family moved to [[Marin City, California|Marin City]], California, a residential community located 5 miles (8.0&amp;nbsp;km) north of [[San Francisco]],&lt;ref name=&quot;vibe&quot;/&gt; where he attended [[Tamalpais High School]] in nearby [[Mill Valley, California|Mill Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/16/us/shots-silence-angry-voice-sharpened-by-the-streets.html|title=Shots Silence Angry Voice Sharpened by the Streets|last=Marriott|first=Michel|coauthors=James Brooke, Charlie LeDuff and Donatella Lorch|date=September 16, 1996|work=The New York Times|pages=A–1|accessdate=2009-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He began attending the poetry classes of [[Leila Steinberg]] in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hearteducation.org/leila.html|title=Leila Steinberg|date=Assemblies in Motion|accessdate=2009-01-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080213024039/http://www.hearteducation.org/leila.html |archivedate =2008-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Steinberg organized a concert with a former group of Shakur's, &quot;Strictly Dope&quot;; the concert led to him being signed with Atron Gregory. He set him up as a roadie and backup dancer with the young rap group [[Digital Underground]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSTA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TSHSD&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HTP-330&quot;/&gt;

===1990–92: ''2Pacalypse Now'', police brutality and shooting in Marin City===
Shakur's professional entertainment career began in the early 1990s, when he debuted his rapping skills in a vocal turn in Digital Underground's &quot;Same Song&quot; from the [[Nothing but Trouble (soundtrack)|soundtrack to the 1991 film ''Nothing but Trouble'']] and also appeared with the group in the film of the [[Nothing but Trouble (1991 film)|same name]]. The song was later released as the lead song of the Digital Underground [[extended play]] (EP) ''[[This is an EP Release]]'', the follow-up to their debut hit album ''[[Sex Packets]]''. Shakur appeared in the accompanying music video. After his rap debut, he performed with Digital Underground again on the album ''[[Sons of the P]]''. Later, he released his first solo album, ''[[2Pacalypse Now]]''. Though the album did not generate any &quot;Top Ten&quot; hits, ''2Pacalypse Now'' is hailed by many critics and fans for its underground feel, with many rappers such as [[Nas]], [[Eminem]], [[Game (rapper)|Game]], and [[Talib Kweli]] having pointed to it as inspiration.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/h/hip_hop_week/2006/emcees/index15.jhtml|title=MTV - They Told Us|accessdate=2011-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the album was originally released on [[Interscope Records]], rights of it are now owned by [[Amaru Entertainment]]. The album's name is a reference to the 1979 film ''[[Apocalypse Now]]''.

The album generated significant controversy. [[Dan Quayle]] criticized it after a Texas youth's defense attorney claimed he was influenced by ''2Pacalypse Now'' and its strong theme of [[police brutality]] before shooting a state trooper. Quayle said, &quot;There's no reason for a record like this to be released. It has no place in our society.&quot; The record was important in showcasing 2Pac's political conviction and his focus on lyrical prowess. On [[MTV]]'s ''Greatest Rappers of All Time List'', ''2Pacalypse Now'' was listed as one of 2Pac's &quot;certified classic&quot; albums, along with ''[[Me Against the World]]'', ''[[All Eyez On Me]]'' and ''[[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]]''.

''2Pacalypse Now'' went on to be certified Gold by the [[RIAA]]. It featured three singles; &quot;[[Brenda's Got a Baby]]&quot;, &quot;[[Trapped (2Pac song)|Trapped]]&quot;, and &quot;[[If My Homie Calls]]&quot;.
''2Pacalypse Now'' can be found in the Vinyl Countdown and in the instruction manual for ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]],'' along with the track &quot;I Don't Give a Fuck,&quot; which appeared on the in-game radio station, ''[[Radio Los Santos]]''.

In October 1991, Tupac filed a $10&amp;nbsp;million civil suit against the [[Oakland Police Department]], alleging they brutally beat him for [[jaywalking]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/14/arts/tupac-shakur-25-rap-performer-who-personified-violence-dies.html?pagewanted=2 | work=The New York Times | title=Tupac Shakur, 25, Rap Performer Who Personified Violence, Dies | first=Jon | last=Pareles | date=September 14, 1996 | accessdate=2010-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On August 22, 1992, in Marin City, Shakur performed at an outdoor festival, and stayed for an hour afterwards signing autographs and pictures. A confrontation occurred in which someone drew a [[Colt's Manufacturing Company|Colt Mustang]], and accidentally dropped it. As it was picked up, a bullet discharged. About 100 yards away, Qa'id Walker-Teal, a 6-year-old, was hit and killed by a bullet at a playground. Some sources report that the child was the victim of a stray bullet in a shootout between Shakur's entourage and a rival group.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Marin slaying case against rapper opens&quot;, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', November 3, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Settlement in Rapper's Trial for Boy's Death&quot;. ''San Francisco Chronicle''. November 8, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Shakur and Mopreme left in their car and were stopped by an [[angry mob]]. The police &quot;rescued&quot; them and took the two into custody, who were soon released without charge. In 1995, a [[Wrongful death claim|wrongful death suit]] was brought against Shakur by Qa'id's mother. [[Ballistics]] tests proved the bullet that killed the boy was not from Shakur's or any members of his entourage's gun. Shakur's attorney stated that the festival was a &quot;nasty situation,&quot; and his client was saddened by the death of the young boy. Shakur's record company settled the lawsuit for an undisclosed amount, reportedly between $300,000 and $500,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Dwyer |first=Jim |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/1996/09/15/1996-09-15_gangsta_move_cost_a_life.html |title=Gangsta Move Cost A Life |publisher=Ny Daily News |date=September 15, 1996 |accessdate=2010-07-24 |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1993: ''Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.'', rape charge and shooting in Atlanta===
His second record, ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.]]'', was released in 1993. The album did better than the previous one debuting on number 24 on the [[Billboard 200]]. The album contains many tracks emphasizing 2Pac's political and social views. This album had more commercial success than its predecessor, and there were noticeable differences in production. While Tupac's first effort had an indie-rap-oriented sound, this album was considered his &quot;breakout&quot; album. It spawned the hits &quot;[[Keep Ya Head Up]]&quot; and &quot;[[I Get Around (2Pac song)|I Get Around]]&quot; and reached platinum status. On vinyl, Side A (tracks 1-8) was labeled the &quot;Black Side&quot; and Side B (tracks 9-16) the &quot;Dark Side.&quot; It's known as his tenth-biggest selling album with 1,366,000 units moved as of 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://atlantapost.com/2010/09/16/tupacs-album-sales-and-his-persisting-legacy56988/ |title=Remebering Tupac: His Musical Legacy and His Top Selling Albums &amp;#124; Madame Noire &amp;#124; Black Women's Lifestyle Guide &amp;#124; Black Hair &amp;#124; Black Love |publisher=Atlantapost.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1993, in [[Atlanta]], two brothers and off-duty police officers, Mark and Scott Whitwell, were with their wives celebrating Mrs. Whitwell's recent passing of the state bar examination. As they crossed the street, a car with Shakur inside passed by them or &quot;almost struck them.&quot; The Whitwells began an altercation with the driver, Shakur and the other passengers, which was joined by a second passing car. Shakur shot one officer in the [[buttocks]], and the other in the leg, back, or abdomen, according to varying news reports. There were no other injuries. Mark Whitwell was charged with firing at Shakur's car and later lying to the police during the investigation; Shakur was charged with the shooting; the prosecutors decided to drop all charges against all parties.&lt;ref&gt;Smothers, R., [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE7DC1F3AF931A35752C1A965958260 &quot;Rapper Charged in Shootings of Off-Duty Officers&quot;].

In November 1993, Shakur and others were charged with sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel room. Shakur denied the charges. According to Shakur, he had prior relations days earlier with the woman that were consensual. The complainant claimed sexual assault after her second visit to Shakur's hotel room; she alleged that Shakur and his entourage raped her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thuglifearmy.com/news/?id=19 A Total News Source for Hip-Hop Culture]{{Dead link|date=January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://jj_productions.tripod.com/rape1.htm |title=Sex was the Case |publisher=Jj_productions.tripod.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ensuing trial, Shakur was convicted of sexual abuse. In sentencing Shakur to 1½–4½ years in prison, the judge described the crime as &quot;an act of brutal violence against a helpless woman.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;James, George, &quot;Rapper Faces Prison Term For Sex Abuse&quot;, ''New York Times'', B1 (February 8, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Olen, Helaine, &quot;Rapper Shakur Gets Prison for Assault&quot;, ''Los Angeles Times'', A4 (February 8, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; After serving part of his sentence, Shakur was released on bail pending appeal.

In late 1993, Shakur formed the group Thug Life with a number of his friends, including [[Big Syke]], Macadoshis, his stepbrother [[Mopreme Shakur]], and Rated R. The group released their only album ''[[Thug Life: Volume 1]]'' on September 26, 1994, which went gold. The album featured the single &quot;Pour Out a Little Liquor,&quot; produced by [[Johnny &quot;J&quot;|Johnny &quot;J&quot; Jackson]], who went on to produce a large part of Shakur's album ''[[All Eyez on Me]]''. The group usually performed their concerts without Shakur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Thug Life: Vol. 1|date=1994|medium=CD}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The album was originally released by Shakur's label Out Da Gutta Records. Due to criticism about [[gangsta rap]] at the time, the original version of the album was scrapped and re-recorded with many of the original songs being cut. Among the notable tracks on the album are &quot;Bury Me a G,&quot; &quot;[[Cradle to the Grave]],&quot;  &quot;Pour Out a Little Liquor&quot; (which also appears in the soundtrack to the 1994 film [[Above the Rim]]), &quot;How Long Will They Mourn Me?&quot; and &quot;Str8 Ballin'.&quot; The album contains ten tracks because Interscope Records felt many of the other recorded songs were too controversial to release. Although the original version of the album was not completed, Tupac performed the planned first single from the album, &quot;Out on Bail&quot; at the 1994 Source Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author= |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiubB9awJUA |title=2Pac - Out On Bail (live 1994) |publisher=YouTube |date= January 8, 2007 |accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the album was originally released on Shakur's label Out Da Gutta, [[Amaru Entertainment]], the label owned by the mother of Tupac Shakur, has since gained the rights to it.

[[File:Bellevue Hospital front gate jeh.jpg|alt=|thumb|Shakur was rushed to Bellevue Hospital after a near-fatal shooting in 1994]]
On the night of November 30, 1994, the day before the verdict in his sexual abuse trial was to be announced, Shakur was shot five times and robbed by two armed men in army fatigues after entering the lobby of Quad Recording Studios in Manhattan. He would later accuse [[Sean Combs]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88461862 |title=What Did Sean 'Puffy' Combs Know?|publisher=Npr.org |date=March 18, 2008 |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andre Harrell]], and [[The Notorious B.I.G.|Biggie Smalls]]—whom he saw after the shooting—of setting him up. Shakur also suspected his close friend and associate, [[Stretch (rapper)|Randy &quot;Stretch&quot; Walker]], of being involved in the attack. In the documentary,{{Which|date=October 2012}} Biggie says that they were in the recording studio and did not know Shakur would be there.  Once they heard he was downstairs, Lil' Cease went to get him but came back with news that he had just been shot.  When Biggie's entourage went downstairs to check on the incident, Shakur was being taken out on a stretcher, still conscious and giving [[finger (gesture)|the finger]] to those around. {{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}

According to the doctors at [[Bellevue Hospital]], where he was admitted immediately following the incident, Shakur had received five bullet wounds; twice in the head, twice in the groin and once through the arm and thigh. In the documentary &quot;Biggie and Tupac&quot;, Tupac's father is interviewed and said that Tupac made a point to show him that no damage was inflicted upon his penis and/or testicles.  His father also mentions that when he saw Tupac's groin, he knew that he was his son.  He checked out of the hospital against doctor's orders, three hours after surgery. In the day that followed, Shakur entered the courthouse in a wheelchair and was found guilty of three counts of molestation, but innocent of six others, including sodomy. On February 6, 1995, he was sentenced to one-and-a-half to four-and-a-half years in prison on a sexual assault charge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digtriad.com/news/watercooler/article.aspx?storyid=118215&amp;catid=176 Today In Entertainment History February 6 | digtriad.com | Triad, NC]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of September 7, 1996, Shakur attended the [[Mike Tyson]]–[[Bruce Seldon]] boxing match at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand]] in Las Vegas. After leaving the match, one of Knight's associates spotted 21-year-old [[Orlando Anderson|Orlando &quot;Baby Lane&quot; Anderson]], an alleged member of the [[Crips|Southside Crips]], in the MGM Grand lobby. Earlier that year, Anderson and a group of Crips had robbed a member of Death Row's entourage in a [[Foot Locker]] store. Knight's associate told Shakur, who attacked Anderson. Shakur's entourage, as well as Knight and his followers, assisted in assaulting Anderson. The fight was captured on the hotel's [[Closed-circuit television|video surveillance]]. After the brawl, Shakur went to rendezvous with Knight to go to Death Row-owned Club 662 (now known as restaurant/club Seven). He rode in Knight's 1996 black [[BMW E38|BMW 750iL]] [[sedan (car)|sedan]] as part of a larger [[convoy]], including many in Shakur's entourage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://madeira.hccanet.org/project1/seiden1/death.html|title=September 1996 Shooting and Death |publisher=madeira.hccanet.org |accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At around 11:00–11:05&amp;nbsp;pm, they were halted on Las Vegas Boulevard by Metro bicycle police for playing the car stereo too loudly and not having license plates.

The bodyguard reported in his documentary, ''Before I Wake'', that shortly after the assault, one of the convoy's cars drove off after the assailant but he never heard from the occupants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.film.com/movies/tupac-shakur-before-i-wake/14704723|title=Tupac Shakur: Before I Wake|publisher=film.com|accessdate=2010-07-28}}{{Dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After arriving on the scene, police and paramedics took Knight and a mortally wounded Shakur to the University Medical Center. According to an interview with the music video director Gobi, while at the hospital, he received news from a Death Row marketing employee that the shooters had called the record label and threatened Shakur.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gobi&quot;&gt;[http://www.hitemup.com/interviews/gobi-feb04.html Interview with Gobi]{{Dead link|date=June 2011}} at http://www.hitemup.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Gobi told the Las Vegas police, but said they claimed to be understaffed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gobi&quot;/&gt; No attackers came.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gobi&quot;/&gt; At the hospital, Shakur was heavily sedated, was placed on life support machines, and was ultimately put under a [[barbiturate]]-[[induced coma]] after repeatedly trying to get out of the bed.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSDCD&quot;/&gt;
While in the [[Intensive-care unit|critical care unit]], on the afternoon of Friday, September 13, 1996, Shakur died of [[internal bleeding]]; doctors attempted to revive him but could not stop the hemorrhaging.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSDCD&quot;/&gt; His mother, Afeni, made the decision to tell the doctors to stop.&lt;ref name=&quot;AEOM&quot;/&gt; He was pronounced dead at 4:03&amp;nbsp;pm ([[Pacific Time Zone|PDT]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;TSDCD&quot;/&gt; The official cause of death was noted as respiratory failure and cardiopulmonary arrest in connection with multiple gunshot wounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSDCD&quot;/&gt; Shakur's body was cremated and some of his ashes were later mixed with [[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] and smoked by members of the [[Outlawz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/music/his-life-after-death/2006/09/12/1157826940955.html |title=Tupac's life after death |publisher=Smh.com.au |date= September 13, 2006|accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==

=== Murder case ===
In 2002, the ''LA Times'' published a story by [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning investigative reporter [[Chuck Philips]], titled &quot;Who Killed Tupac Shakur&quot;, based on a yearlong investigation that reconstructed the crime and the events leading up to it. Evidence gathered by the paper indicated that: &quot;the shooting was carried out by a Compton gang called the Southside Crips to avenge the beating of one of its members by Shakur a few hours earlier. Orlando Anderson, the Crip whom [[Shakur]] had attacked, fired the fatal shots. Las Vegas police discounted Anderson as a suspect and interviewed him only once, briefly. He was later killed in an unrelated gang shooting.&quot; Philips's article also implicated East Coast music figures including Biggie, Tupac's nemesis at the time, and several New York criminals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Philips: Who killed Tupac Shakur&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=Who Killed Tupac Shakur?|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/sep/06/business/fi-tupac6|accessdate=2012-07-15|newspaper=LA Times|date=September 6, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Before they died, Notorious B.I.G. and Anderson denied their role in the murder.  In support of their claims, Biggie's family produced computerized invoices suggesting that Biggie was working in a New York recording studio the night of the drive-by shooting. His manager Wayne Barrow and fellow rapper [[Lil' Cease|James &quot;Lil' Cease&quot; Lloyd]] made public announcements denying Biggie's role in the crime and claimed further that they were both with him in the recording studio during the night of the event.&lt;ref name=&quot;streetgangs1&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.streetgangs.com/topics/tupac/090602aliby.html|title=Notorious B.I.G.'s Family 'Outraged' By Tupac Article|publisher=Streetgangs.com|accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philips' article, however, was based on police affidavits and court documents as well as interviews with investigators, witnesses to the crime and members of the Southside Crips who had never before discussed the killing outside the gang. The main thrust of Philips' article, implicating Anderson and the Crips, remains the best supported theory of the murder of Shakur to date.

==Artistry==
=== Influences and musical style ===
Shakur's music and philosophy is rooted in many American, African-American, and World entities, including the Black Panther Party, [[Black nationalism]], egalitarianism, and liberty. 

Tupac’s love of theater and Shakespeare also influenced his work. A student of the Baltimore school of Arts where he studied theater, Tupac understood the Shakespearian psychology of inter-gang wars and inter-cultural conflict. During a 1995 interview, Tupac told the Pulitzer prize-winning LA Times reporter [[Chuck Philips]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=Tupac Shakur:  ‘I am not a gangster’|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-tupac-qa,0,5550948.story. |newspaper=LA Times|date=October 25, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote| … I love Shakespeare. He wrote some of the rawest stories, man. I mean look at Romeo and Juliet. That's some serious ghetto shit. You got this guy Romeo from the Bloods who falls for Juliet, a female from the Crips, and everybody in both gangs are against them. So they have to sneak out and they end up dead for nothing. Real tragic stuff.  

And look how Shakespeare busts it up with Macbeth. He creates a tale about this king's wife who convinces a happy man to chase after her and kill her husband so he can take over the country. After he commits the murder, the dude starts having delusions just like in a Scarface song. I mean the king's wife just screws this guy's whole life up for nothing…”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=Tupac Shakur:  ‘I am not a gangster’|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-tupac-qa,0,5550948.story.|newspaper=LA Times|date=October 25, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Chuck Philips]] made his recorded 1995 interview with Tupac available at chuckphilipspost.com on September 13, 2012, the anniversary of [[Tupac]]'s death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tupac Speaks&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Philips|first=Chuck|title=Tupac Speaks with Chuck Philips: Tapes 1-10|url=http://chuckphilipspost.com/tupac-speaks1995intervie/|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Chuckphilipspost.com|date=September 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a European interview&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview with Philips about chuckphilpspost.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Garcia-Ajofrin|first=Isabel|title=Entrevisa a Chuck Philips: &quot;Ademas de lo de Tupac, Jimmy Henchman orderno disparar al trailer de Snoop Dogg&quot;|url=http://www.swaggamusic.net/tag/chuck-philips/|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Swagga|date=September 25, 2012}&lt;/ref&gt; Philips said that what impressed him the most about Tupac was that he was a poet. Philips said &quot; I like sacred texts, myths, proverbs and scriptures. ... When Tupac came along, I thought he was quite the poet... It wasn’t just how cleverly they rhymed. It wasn’t just the rhythm or the cadence. I liked their attitude. It was protest music in a way nobody had ever thought about before. ...These artists were brave, wise and smart – wickedly smart. The thing about Tupac was he had so many sides. He was unafraid to write about his vulnerabilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview with Philips about chuckphilpspost.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Garcia-Ajofrin|first=Isabel|title=Entrevisa a Chuck Philips: &quot;Ademas de lo de Tupac, Jimmy Henchman orderno disparar al trailer de Snoop Dogg&quot;|url=http://www.swaggamusic.net/tag/chuck-philips/|accessdate=25 September 2012|newspaper=Swagga|date=September 25, 2012}&lt;/ref&gt;&quot; 

Tupac's debut album, ''2Pacalypse Now'', revealed the socially conscious side of Shakur. On this album, Shakur attacked social injustice, poverty and police brutality on songs &quot;Brenda's Got a Baby&quot;, &quot;Trapped&quot; and &quot;Part Time Mutha&quot;. His style on this album was highly influenced by the social consciousness and [[Afrocentrism]] pervading hip hop in the late 1980s and early 1990s. On this initial release, Shakur helped extend the success of such rap groups as [[Boogie Down Productions]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[X-Clan]], and [[Grandmaster Flash]], as he became one of the first major socially conscious rappers from the West Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackhistory.com/cgi-bin/blog.cgi?cid=52&amp;reading=1&amp;blog_id=60686|title=Life After Death |publisher=blackhistory.com|accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his second record, Shakur continued to rap about the social ills facing African-Americans, with songs like &quot;The Streetz R Deathrow&quot; and &quot;Last Wordz&quot;. He also showed his compassionate side with the anthem &quot;Keep Ya Head Up&quot;, while simultaneously putting his legendary aggressiveness on display with the title track from the album ''[[Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z.]]'' he added a salute to his former group Digital Underground by including them on the playful track &quot;[[I Get Around (2Pac song)|I Get Around]]&quot;. Throughout his career, an increasingly aggressive attitude can be seen pervading Shakur's subsequent albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/2Pac/+wiki|title=Tupac Shakur Biography|publisher=[[Last.fm]]|accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The contradictory themes of social inequality and injustice, unbridled aggression, compassion, playfulness, and hope all continued to shape Shakur's work, as witnessed with the release of his incendiary 1995 album ''[[Me Against the World]]''. In 1996, Shakur released ''[[All Eyez on Me]]''. Many of these tracks are considered by many critics to be classics, including &quot;Ambitionz Az a Ridah&quot;, &quot;[[I Ain't Mad at Cha]]&quot;, &quot;[[California Love]]&quot;, &quot;Life Goes On&quot; and &quot;Picture Me Rollin&quot;.; ''All Eyez on Me'' was a change of style from his earlier works. While still containing socially conscious songs and themes, Shakur's album was heavily influenced by party tracks and tended to have a more &quot;feel good&quot; vibe than his first albums. Shakur described it as a celebration of life, and the record was critically and commercially successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r231489|pure_url=yes}}|title=All Eyez on Me|publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had enjoyed and had been influenced by the work of contemporary English and Irish pop musicians as a teenager such as [[Kate Bush]], [[Culture Club]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]] and [[U2]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VndZuYv9u4kC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26&amp;dq=tupac+kate+bush&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5oeZfTVi7b&amp;sig=F5iaTUsCEeWRNg9Sl-MXPhKOCrU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=JvZAT8mjJeOQ0AXKr-mPDw&amp;ved=0CFIQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=tupac%20kate%20bush&amp;f=false |title=Tupac Shakur - Carrie Golus - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=December 28, 2006 |accessdate=2012-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other ventures==

=== Death Row Records ===
Upon his release from Clinton Correctional Facility, Shakur immediately went back to song recording. He began a new group called [[Outlawz|Outlaw Immortalz]]. Shakur began recording his first album with Death Row and released the single &quot;[[California Love]]&quot; soon after.
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[File:Pacsnoopsuge.jpg|thumb|Shakur, [[Snoop Dogg|Snoop &quot;Doggy&quot; Dogg]], and [[Suge Knight|Marion &quot;Suge&quot; Knight]] during Shakur's tenure on [[Death Row Records]] (1995)]] --&gt;
On February 13, 1996, Shakur released his fourth solo album, ''[[All Eyez on Me]]''. This double album was the first and second of his three-album commitment to Death Row Records. It sold over nine million copies.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The record was a general departure from the introspective subject matter of ''Me Against the World'', being more oriented toward a thug and gangsta mentality. Shakur continued his recordings despite increasing problems at the Death Row label. [[Dr. Dre]] left his post as house producer to form his own label, [[Aftermath Entertainment|Aftermath]]. Shakur continued to produce hundreds of tracks during his time at Death Row, most of which would be released on his posthumous albums ''[[R U Still Down? (Remember Me)]]'', ''[[Still I Rise (2PAC album)|Still I Rise]]'', ''[[Until the End of Time (Tupac Shakur album)|Until the End of Time]]'', ''[[Better Dayz]]'', ''[[Loyal to the Game]]'' and ''[[Pac's Life]]''. He also began the process of recording an album with the [[Boot Camp Clik]] and their label Duck Down Records, both New York–based, entitled ''One Nation''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/2Pac-Boot-Camp-Clik-One-Nation/release/2160632|title=2Pac &amp; Boot Camp Clik – One Nation |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 4, 1996, he and Outlawz released the [[wikt:diss song|diss track]] &quot;[[Hit 'Em Up]]&quot;, a scathing lyrical assault on Biggie and others associated with him. In the track, Shakur claimed to have had sexual intercourse with [[Faith Evans]], Biggie's wife at the time, and attacked [[Bad Boy Records|Bad Boy]]'s street credibility. Shakur was convinced that some members associated with Bad Boy had known about the '94 attack on him beforehand due to their behavior that night and what his sources told him. After the attack, Shakur immediately accused [[Jimmy Henchman]]  (an associate of Bad Boy CEO Sean Combs) of orchestrating the attack, according to a 2005 interview with Henchman in Vibe magazine. After the attack, Shakur therefore aligned himself with Suge, Death Row's CEO, who was already bitter toward Combs over a 1995 incident at the Platinum Club in Atlanta, Georgia, which culminated in the death of Suge's friend and bodyguard, Jake Robles; Suge was adamant in voicing his suspicions of Combs' involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Egbert |first=Bill |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/02/27/2001-02-27__hip_hype___rival_rap.html |title=Hip Hype &amp; Rival Rap, by Bill Egbert |work=Daily News |location=New York  |date=February 27, 2001 |accessdate=2010-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In a June 12, 2012  [[Village Voice]] article, [[Chuck Philips]] reported that Sean Comb's associate [[Jimmy Henchman]], remarkably, admitted to setting up Tupac's ambush during one of nine &quot;Queen For A Day&quot; proffer sessions with the government in autumn of 2011, according to prosecutors).&lt;ref name=&quot;Queen for a day Henchman proffer&quot;/&gt;

While incarcerated in [[Clinton Correctional Facility]], Shakur read and studied [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and other published works, which inspired his pseudonym &quot;Makaveli&quot; under which he released the album ''[[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]]''. The album presents a stark contrast to previous works. Throughout the album, Shakur continues to focus on the themes of pain and aggression, making this album one of the emotionally darker works of his career. Shakur wrote and recorded all the lyrics in only three days and the production took another four days, combining for a total of seven days to complete the album (hence the name).

=== Outlawz ===
{{Main|Outlawz}}
When Tupac Shakur recorded &quot;[[Hit 'Em Up]]&quot; a [[Diss track|diss song]] towards his former friend and rival, [[The Notorious B.I.G.]], also known as Biggie Smalls he recruited three members from the former group Dramacydal whom he had worked with previously, and was eager to work with again. Together with the three New Jersey rappers and other associates, they formed the original lineup of the Outlawz. When 2Pac signed to [[Death Row Records|Death Row]] upon his release from prison, he recruited his step brother [[Mopreme Shakur]] and [[Big Syke]] from Thug Life. [[Hussein Fatal]], [[Napoleon (rapper)|Napoleon]], [[E.D.I. Mean]], [[Kastro (Outlawz)|Kastro]], [[Yaki Kadafi]], and Storm (the only female Outlaw) were also added, and together they formed the original lineup of the Outlaw Immortalz that debuted on 2Pac's multi-platinum smash ''[[All Eyez on Me]]''. They later dropped the immortal after the untimely deaths of 2Pac and Yaki Kadafi and moved on as Outlawz without the members of Thug Life. [[Young Noble]] was later added and appeared on 2Pac's second Death Row release ''[[The Don Killuminati: The 7 Day Theory]]''.  It was on 2Pac's Makaveli album that Outlawz first came to the greater rap community's notice, appearing on a few songs.
The idea behind the group was for each member to have a rap name coinciding with the names of various tyrants or enemies of [[United States|America]], past and present. Outlawz chose in later years to make a [[backronym]] out of the letters of their group name ''Operating Under Thug Laws As Warriorz'' although it does not stand for the groups name and is used infrequently.  

On forming the Outlawz, Tupac gave each of them a name of a dictator/military leader or an enemy of America.
* [[Yaki Kadafi]], after Libyan leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]]
* [[Hussein Fatal]], after Iraqi leader [[Saddam Hussein]]
* [[Big Syke|Mussolini]] (formerly [[Big Syke]]), after Italian dictator [[Benito Mussolini]]
* [[Mopreme Shakur|Komani]] (Shakur's half brother [[Mopreme Shakur]]), after [[Iranian Revolution|Iranian Islamic Revolution]] leader [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]]
* [[Kastro (Outlawz)|Kastro]], after Cuban leader [[Fidel Castro]]
* [[E.D.I. Mean]], after Ugandan dictator [[Idi Amin]]
* [[Napoleon (rapper)|Napoleon]], after military strategist and leader [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]
For himself, Tupac created the alias &quot;Makaveli&quot; from [[Italian Renaissance|Renaissance]] Italian philosopher and strategist [[Niccolo Machiavelli]], whose writings inspired Shakur in prison, but who also preached that a leader could eliminate his enemies by all means necessary.

He mentioned Makaveli Records a few times before his death. This was supposed to be a music label for up and coming artists that Shakur had an interest in developing or potentially signing, and his own future projects would have also been published through it as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.2pacworld.co.uk/2pacCompanies.html|title=Makaveil Records|publisher=2pacworld.co.uk|accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting career===
In addition to rapping and hip hop music, Shakur acted in films. He made his first film appearance in the motion picture ''[[Nothing But Trouble (1991 film)|Nothing But Trouble]]'', as part of a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] by the Digital Underground. His first starring role was in the film ''[[Juice (film)|Juice]]''. In this story, he played the character Bishop, a trigger happy teen, for which he was hailed by ''Rolling Stone''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s [[Peter Travers]] as &quot;the film's most magnetic figure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alleyezonme.com/ |title=2Pac biography |publisher=Alleyezonme.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to star with [[Janet Jackson]] in ''[[Poetic Justice (1993 film)|Poetic Justice]]'' and with [[Duane Martin]] in ''[[Above the Rim]]''. After his death, three of Shakur's completed films, ''[[Bullet (1996 film)|Bullet]]'', ''[[Gridlock'd]]'' and ''[[Gang Related (film)|Gang Related]]'', were released.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,286619,00.html|title=Gridlock'd|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2010-07-28|date=January 31, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=gangrelated.htm|title=Gang Related|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He had also been slated to star in the [[Hughes Brothers|Hughes brothers]]' film ''[[Menace II Society]]'' but was replaced by [[Larenz Tate]] after assaulting Allen Hughes as a result of a quarrel. Director [[John Singleton]] mentioned that he wrote the script for ''[[Baby Boy (film)|Baby Boy]]'' with Shakur in mind for the leading role.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Greg Tate |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0126,tate,25915,1.html |title=Sex &amp; Negrocity by Greg Tate |publisher=Villagevoice.com |date=June 26, 2001 |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was eventually filmed with [[Tyrese Gibson]] in his place and released in 2001, five years after Shakur's death. The film features a mural of Shakur in the [[protagonist]]'s bedroom as well as featuring the song &quot;[[Hail Mary (2Pac song)|Hail Mary]]&quot; in the film's score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rapbasement.com/hip-hop/god-bless-the-dead/2pac.html|title=FILM|publisher=rapbasement.com|accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Shakur was a voracious reader. He was inspired by a wide variety of writers, including [[William Shakespeare]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Donald Goines]], [[Sun Tzu]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Mikhail Bakunin]], [[Maya Angelou]], [[Alice Walker]], and [[Khalil Gibran]]. In his book ''Holler If You Hear Me: Searching for Tupac Shakur'', University of Pennsylvania Avalon Professor of Humanities and African American Studies [[Michael Eric Dyson]] describes the experience of visiting the home of Shakur's friend and promoter Leila Steinberg to find &quot;the sea of books&quot; once owned by Shakur.&lt;ref name=&quot;m dyson holler&quot;&gt;Dyson, M. ''Holler If You Hear Me: Searching for Tupac Shakur''. BasicCivitas Books. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shakur never professed following a particular religion, but his lyrics in singles such as 'Only God Can Judge Me' and poems such as ''[[The Rose That Grew from Concrete]]'' suggest he believed in God. This means many analysts currently describe him as a [[Deism|deist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.albany.edu/scj/jcjpc/vol14is2/nisker.pdf |title=Only God Can Judge Me and lyrical Subversion |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.csun.edu/csbs/departments/pan_african_studies/pdf/be_%20for_him_or_against_him.pdf Tupac mentioned God throughout his

I think heaven is just when you sleep, you sleep with a good conscience - you don't have nightmares. Hell is when you sleep, the last thing you see is all the f** ked up things you did in your life and you just see it over and over again ... So that's wrong religion&quot;''&lt;/ref&gt;

Tupac has had several family members who were members of the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panthers]]; [[Mutulu Shakur]], the step-father of Tupac, [[Assata Shakur]], his step-aunt, Billy Garland the biological father of Tupac and [[Afeni Shakur]] his mother.

Shakur is held in high esteem by other [[MC]]s – in the book ''[[How to Rap]]'', [[Bishop Lamont]] notes that Shakur “mastered every element, every aspect” of rapping&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Fredro Starr]] of [[Onyx (band)|Onyx]] says Shakur, &quot;was a master of the flow.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul, 2009, ''[[How to Rap]]: The Art &amp; Science of the Hip-Hop MC'', Chicago Review Press, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Every rapper who grew up in the Nineties owes something to Tupac,&quot; wrote [[50 Cent]]. &quot;He didn't sound like anyone who came before him.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;RS&quot;/&gt; [[About.com]] for their part named Shakur the most influential rapper ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rap.about.com/od/toppicks/ss/Top50Emcees_9.htm |title=50 Greatest MCs of Our Time (1987–2007) |publisher=Rap.about.com |date=March 11, 2011 |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To preserve Shakur's legacy, his mother founded the Shakur Family Foundation (later renamed the Tupac Amaru Shakur Foundation or TASF) in 1997. The TASF's stated mission is to &quot;provide training and support for students who aspire to enhance their creative talents.&quot;  The TASF sponsors essay contests, charity events, a [[performing arts]] day camp for teenagers and undergraduate scholarships. The Foundation officially opened the [[Tupac Amaru Shakur Center for the Arts]] (TASCA) in [[Stone Mountain, Georgia|Stone Mountain]], Georgia, on June 11, 2005. On November 14, 2003, a documentary about Shakur entitled ''[[Tupac: Resurrection]]'' was released under the supervision of his mother and narrated entirely in his voice. It was nominated for [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature|Best Documentary]] in the [[77th Academy Awards|2005 Academy Awards]]. Proceeds will go to a charity set up by Shakur's mother Afeni. On April 17, 2003, [[Harvard University]] co-sponsored an academic symposium entitled &quot;All Eyez on Me: Tupac Shakur and the Search for the Modern Folk Hero.&quot; The speakers discussed a wide range of topics dealing with Shakur's impact on everything from entertainment to sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Gewertz, K. &quot;Symposium analyzes, celebrates 'Thug'&quot;. Harvard University Gazette. April 24, 2003. Retrieved from [http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/04.24/11-hiphop.html news.harvard.edu/] on April 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the speakers discussed Shakur's status and public persona, including [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|State University of New York at Buffalo]] English professor [[Mark Anthony Neal]] who gave the talk &quot;Thug Nigga Intellectual: Tupac as Celebrity Gramscian&quot; in which he argued that Shakur was an example of the &quot;organic intellectual&quot; expressing the concerns of a larger group.&lt;ref&gt;Neal, M. &quot;Thug Nigga Intellectual: Tupac as Celebrity Gramscian&quot;. [[Harvard University]]. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Neal has also indicated in his writings that the death of Shakur has left a &quot;leadership void amongst hip-hop artists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Mark Anthony Neal |url=http://newblackman.blogspot.com/2005/09/race-ing-katrina.html |title=NewBlackMan: Race-ing Katrina |publisher=Newblackman.blogspot.com |date=September 6, 2005 |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neal further describes him as a &quot;walking contradiction&quot;, a status that allowed him to &quot;make being an intellectual accessible to ordinary people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thuglifearmy.com/news/?id=2734|title=Deeper Than Hip-Hop Tupac (2Pac) Poetry Enlightens|publisher=ThugLifeArmy.com|accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of Communications Murray Forman, of [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]], spoke of the [[mythical]] status about Shakur's life and death. He addressed the [[symbol]]ism and mythology surrounding Shakur's death in his talk entitled &quot;Tupac Shakur: O.G. (Ostensibly Gone)&quot;. Among his findings were that Shakur's fans have &quot;succeeded in resurrecting Tupac as an ethereal life force.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Forman, M. &quot;Tupac Shakur: O.G. (Ostensibly Gone)&quot;. [[Harvard University]]. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;From Thug Life to Legend: Realization of a Black Folk Hero&quot;, Professor of Music at Northeastern University, Emmett Price, compared Shakur's public image to that of the trickster-figures of African-American folklore which gave rise to the urban &quot;bad-man&quot; persona of the post-slavery period. He ultimately described Shakur as a &quot;prolific artist&quot; who was &quot;driven by a terrible sense of urgency&quot; in a quest to &quot;unify mind, body, and spirit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Price, E. &quot;From Thug Life to Legend: Realization of a Black Folk Hero&quot;. [[Harvard University]]. 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Holler If You Hear Me: Searching for Tupac Shakur'', Michael Eric Dyson indicated that Shakur &quot;spoke with brilliance and insight as someone who bears witness to the pain of those who would never have his platform. He told the truth, even as he struggled with the fragments of his identity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;m dyson holler&quot;/&gt; At one Harvard Conference the theme was Shakur's impact on entertainment, [[race relations]], politics and the &quot;hero/martyr&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Harvard News Office |url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2003/04.24/11-hiphop.html |title=Harvard Gazette: Symposium analyzes, celebrates 'thug' |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date=April 24, 2003 |accessdate=2012-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1997, the [[University of California, Berkeley]] offered a student-led course entitled &quot;History 98: Poetry and History of Tupac Shakur.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vh1.com/artists/news/1171/09101997/2pac.jhtml Berkeley University Offers Class On Tupac] at [[VH1]] (September 10, 1997).

Shakur's hit song &quot;[[Dear Mama]]&quot; is one of 25 songs that was added to the [[National Recording Registry]] in 2010.

Shakur is the third rapper to enter the library, behind [[Grandmaster Flash]] and [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/06/23/entertainment/main6611103.shtml|title=Tupac Shakur Honored By Library of Congress|date=June 23, 2010|accessdate=2010-06-23|publisher=[[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
