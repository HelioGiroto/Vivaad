'''Robert Edward''' &quot;'''Ted'''&quot; '''Turner III''' (born November 19, 1938&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9073872/Ted-Turner |title=Ted Turner – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an American [[media mogul]] and [[philanthropist]]. As a businessman, he is known as founder of the [[cable news]] network [[CNN]], the first 24-hour [[United States cable news|cable news]] channel. In addition, he founded [[WPCH-TV|WTBS]], which pioneered the [[superstation]] concept in [[cable television]]. As a philanthropist, he is known for his $1&amp;nbsp;billion gift to support the [[United Nations]], which created the [[United Nations Foundation]], a public charity to broaden support for the UN. Turner serves as [[Chair (official)|Chairman]] of the United Nations Foundation [[board of directors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfoundation.org|title=UN Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner's media empire began with his father's [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] business, which he took over at 24 after his father's suicide.&lt;ref name=bibb5556&gt;{{cite book| title=Ted Turner: It Ain't As Easy as It Looks: The Amazing Story of CNN|author= Porter Bibb|publisher=Virgin Books|year=1996|isbn=0-86369-892-1|pages=55–56|url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/155566203X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The business, Turner Outdoor Advertising, was worth $1&amp;nbsp;million when Turner took it over in 1963. Purchase of an [[Atlanta]] [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] station in 1970 began the [[Turner Broadcasting System]]. [[CNN|Cable News Network]] revolutionized news media, covering the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster]] in 1986 and the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]] in 1991. Turner turned the [[Atlanta Braves]] baseball team into a nationally popular franchise and launched the charitable [[Goodwill Games]]. He helped reinvent interest in professional wrestling when he owned one of the most popular wrestling companies of the middle to late 1990s known as [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW). The Monday night show that it put on was the highest rated on cable and helped boost Turner's channels of TNT and WTBS.

Turner's penchant for controversial statements earned him the nicknames &quot;The Mouth of the South&quot; and &quot;Captain Outrageous&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ted Turner: It Ain't As Easy as It Looks: The Amazing Story of CNN|author=Porter Bibb|publisher=Virgin Books|year=1996|isbn=0-86369-892-1|url= http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/155566203X|pages=138, 272, 283, 442}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1048325,00.html | title=Captain Outrageous Opens Fire | work=Time | first=Stephen | last=Koepp | date=April 12, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner has also devoted his assets to environmental causes. He was the largest private [[landowner]] in the United States until [[John C. Malone]] surpassed him in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/turner-becomes-largest-private-landowner-in-us-761711.html |title=Turner becomes largest private landowner in US – Americas, World |publisher=The Independent |date=December 1, 2007 |accessdate=March 29, 2009 | location=London | first=Leonard | last=Doyle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/29/us/29land.html |title=For Land Barons, Acres by the Millions |work= [[The New York Times]] |date=January 28, 2011 |first=Katharine Q. |last=Seelye}}&lt;/ref&gt; He uses much of his land for ranches to re-popularize [[bison]] meat (for his [[Ted's Montana Grill]] chain), amassing the largest herd in the world. He also created the environmental-themed animated series ''[[Captain Planet and the Planeteers]].''

==Early life==
Turner was born in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], the son of Florence (née Rooney) and Robert Edward Turner II, a billboard [[magnate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/19/Ted-Turner.html |title=Ted Turner Biography (1938-) |publisher=Film Reference |date= |accessdate=March 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was nine, his family moved to [[Savannah, Georgia]]. He attended [[The McCallie School]], a private, boys' preparatory school in [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. Turner attended [[Brown University]] and was vice-president of the [[Brown Debating Union]] and captain of the sailing team. He became a member of [[Kappa Sigma]]. Turner initially majored in [[Classics]]. Turner's father wrote saying that his choice made him &quot;appalled, even horrified,&quot; and that he &quot;almost puked.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lettersofnote.com/2012/07/this-is-my-son-he-speaks-greek.html &quot;This is my son. He speaks Greek&quot;], ''lettersofnote.com'', July 25, 2012. Letter reproduced from ''Call Me Ted''.&lt;/ref&gt; Turner later changed his major to [[Economics]], but before receiving a diploma, he was [[expulsion (academia)|expelled]] for having a female student in his dormitory room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Ted Turner: It Ain't As Easy as It Looks: The Amazing Story of CNN| author=Porter Bibb| publisher=Virgin Books| year=1996| isbn=0-86369-892-1| url=http://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/155566203X| pages=26–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner was awarded an honorary B.A. from [[Brown University]] in November 1989 when he returned to campus to keynote the [[National Association of College Broadcasters]] second annual conference.

==Sailing==
When Turner was 26, he entered sailing competitions at the Savannah Yacht Club and competed in Olympic trials in 1964.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} He appeared on the cover of ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' on July 4, 1977,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/cover/featured/8544/index.htm|title=Ted Turner on Sports Illustrated cover|date=July 4, 1977|accessdate=April 27, 2011|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; after being chosen to lead the [[1977 America's Cup]] defense as [[skipper (boating)|skipper]] of the yacht ''[[Courageous (yacht)|Courageous]]''.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} He had purchased the boat after its 1974 America's Cup victory.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} On September 18, 1977, he successfully defended the [[America's Cup]], defeating ''Australia'' 4-0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://32nd.americascup.com/en/acclopaedia/circlinggalaxy/bateau.php?idContent=4891|title=Courageous - US 26|publisher=americascup.com|accessdate=April 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted into the [[America's Cup Hall of Fame]] in 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herreshoff.org/achof/ted_turner.html |title=Herreshoff Marine Museum &amp; America's Cup Hall of Fame |publisher=Herreshoff.org |date= |accessdate=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Sailing Hall of Fame]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nshof.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=322:turner-ted-2011-inductee&amp;catid=78 |title=Turner, Ted - 2011 Inductee |publisher=Nshof.org |date= |accessdate=October 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1979 Fastnet race]], in a storm that killed 15 participants, he skippered ''Tenacious'' to a corrected-time victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rousmainiere|first=John|title=Fastnet, Force 10|year=1980|publisher=Norton|location=New York|isbn=0-393-03256-6.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent controversies==

Turner once called observers of [[Ash Wednesday]] &quot;[[Jesus freak]]s,&quot; though he apologized,&lt;ref name=Timeschristians&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/19/business/mediatalk-aol-sees-a-different-side-of-time-warner.html |work=[[The New York Times]]|title=MediaTalk; AOL Sees a Different Side of Time Warner |author=Jim Rutenberg|date=March 19, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dubbed opponents of [[abortion]] &quot;[[Bozo the Clown|bozos]].&quot;&lt;ref name=Timeschristians/&gt;

In 2008, Turner explained he not only regretted these statements but said he had made peace with organized religion and had joined with the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], the [[Lutheran Church - Missouri Synod]] and the [[United Methodist Church]] to fight [[malaria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Spero News|url=http://www.speroforum.com/site/article.asp?id=14937| title=Ted Turner uses churches for malaria campaign| date=April 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2008 MSNBC interview, Turner stated that he no longer considers himself atheist or agnostic, and prays for sick friends, but keeps it short because &quot;I don't want to load up the wires.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Meet the Press]] |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/27983385/page/5/ |title='Meet the Press' transcript for Nov. 30, 2008 |date=November 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner caused a stir in [[Montana]] in 2003 by funding a project to restore [[westslope cutthroat trout]] to Cherry Creek and Cherry Lake. The controversy stemmed from the poison [[Antimycin A|antimycin]] used to kill fish in the stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://bozemandailychronicle.com/articles/2003/08/05/news/003cherryckbzbigs.txt| title=Poisoning begins on Cherry Creek| date=August 5, 2003| author=Scott McMillion| work=[[Bozeman Daily Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Turner also received attention when he asserted on PBS's Charlie Rose television program that if steps are not taken to address global warming, within 30 to 40 years &quot;most of the people will have died and the rest of us will be cannibals.&quot; Turner also said in the interview that he advocated drastically cutting the U.S. military budget and Americans having no more than two children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/news/stories/2008/04/03/turner_0404.html| title=Ted Turner: Global warming could lead to cannibalism| date=April 3, 2008| author=Mike Morris| work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business activities==
===WTBS===
After leaving Brown University, Turner returned to the South in late 1960 to become general manager of the [[Macon, Georgia]] branch of his father's business. Following his father's March 1963 suicide, Turner became president and chief executive of Turner Advertising Company when he was 24&lt;ref name=bibb5556/&gt; and turned the firm into a global enterprise. He joined the [[Young Republicans]] but said &quot;he felt at ease among these budding conservatives and was merely following in Ed Turner's far-right footsteps,&quot; according to &quot;It Ain't As Easy As It Looks.&quot;

During the [[Vietnam War]] Era, Turner’s business prospered; it “had virtual monopolies in Savannah, Macon, Columbus, and Charleston” and was “the largest outdoor advertising company in the Southeast,” according to &quot;It Ain’t As Easy As It Looks&quot;. The book observed that Turner “discovered his father had sheltered a substantial amount of taxable income over the years by personally lending it back to the company” and “discovered that the billboard business could be a gold mine, a tax-depreciable revenue stream that threw off enormous amounts of cash with almost no capital investment.” In the late 1960s, Turner used the profits to buy Southern radio stations.

In 1969, he sold his several radio stations to buy a struggling television station in Atlanta on Channel 17. At the time, UHF stations did well only in markets without VHF stations, like [[Fresno, California]], or in markets with only one station on VHF. Independent UHF stations were not ratings winners or that profitable even in larger markets, but Turner had the foresight that this would change as people wanted more than several choices. He changed the [[call sign]] to WTCG. Initially, the station ran old movies from the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, along with theatrical cartoons and very old sitcoms and old drama shows. As better syndicated product fell off the VHF stations, Turner would pick it up for his station at a very low price. WTCG ran mostly second- and even third-hand product of the time, including fare such as [[Gilligan's Island]], [[I Love Lucy]], [[Star Trek]], [[Hazel]], and [[Bugs Bunny]]. WTCG acquired rights to telecast the [[Atlanta Braves]] baseball games in 1973. Turner also purchased UHF Channel 36 [[WCNC-TV|WRET]] (now WCNC) in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]] and ran it with a format similar to WTCG.

In 1976, the FCC allowed Turner’s WTCG to use a satellite to transmit content to local cable TV providers around the nation. On December 17, 1976, the rechristened WTCG-TV Super-Station began to broadcast old movies, [[situation comedy]] reruns, cartoons, and sports nationwide to cable-TV subscribers. As cable systems developed, many carried his station to free their schedules. This increased his viewers and advertising. Subscribers eventually reached two million subscribers and Turner's net worth rose to $100&amp;nbsp;million. He bought a {{convert|5000|acre|km2|sing=on}} plantation in Jacksonboro, South Carolina, for $2&amp;nbsp;million.

In 1978, Turner struck a deal with a student-operated radio station at [[MIT]], [[Technology Broadcasting System]] to obtain the rights to the WTBS call sign for $50,000. This allowed Turner to strengthen the branding of his &quot;Super-Station&quot; using the [[acronym]] TBS; Turner Communications Group was renamed [[Turner Broadcasting System]] and WTCG was renamed as [[WPCH-TV|WTBS]].

In 1976, Turner bought the [[Atlanta Braves]] and [[Atlanta Hawks]], partially to provide programming for WTCG. Using the rechristened WTBS' superstation status to beam Braves games into nearly every home in North America, Turner made the Braves a household name even before their run of success in the 1990s and early 2000s. At one point, he suggested to pitcher [[Andy Messersmith]] who wore number 17, that he change his surname to &quot;Channel&quot; to promote the television station.

In 1986, Turner founded the [[Goodwill Games]]. Broadcasting the events of these games provided his superstation the ability to provide [[Olympics]]-style sports programming that had been offered by only one of the three major networks (ABC, CBS and NBC) up to that time.

[[Turner Field]], first used for the [[1996 Summer Olympics]] as [[Centennial Olympic Stadium]] and then converted into a baseball-only facility for the Braves, is named after him.

===CNN===
Turner created [[CNN]] in 1980. He said: &quot;We won't be signing off until the world ends. We'll be on, and we will cover the end of the world, live, and that will be our last event . . . we'll play '[[Nearer, My God, to Thee]]' before we sign off.&quot;

After five years, CNN outgrew its home, a former country club on the outskirts of Midtown, Atlanta. Turner purchased the [[Omni International]] from developer Tom Cousins and moved CNN there. The complex was rechristened the [[CNN Center]]. As Omni International, the complex had never succeeded. Cousins sold it to Turner along with the [[Atlanta Hawks]]. CNN moved into the end of the tower that once housed [[The World of Sid and Marty Krofft]]. Turner was instrumental in the revival of Atlanta's downtown.

===MGM===
After a failed attempt to acquire [[CBS]], Turner purchased the film studio [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM]]/[[United Artists|UA]] Entertainment Co. from [[Kirk Kerkorian]] in 1986 for $1.5&amp;nbsp;billion. Following the acquisition, Turner had an enormous debt and sold parts of the acquisition. MGM/UA Entertainment was sold back to Kirk Kerkorian. The MGM/UA Studio lot in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]] was sold to [[Lorimar Productions|Lorimar]]/[[Telepictures]]. Turner kept MGM's pre-May 1986 and pre-merger film and TV library, which included nearly all of MGM's material made before the merger, and a small portion of [[United Artists]]' film and TV properties which included few UA pictures, the TV series ''[[Gilligan's Island]],'' the U.S and Canadian distribution rights to [[RKO Pictures|RKO Radio Pictures]] library, and the pre-1950&lt;ref name=&quot;ymrt&quot;&gt;''You Must Remember This: The Warner Bros. Story,'' (2008) p. 255.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;WB retained a pair of features from 1949 that they merely distributed, and all short subjects released on or after September 1, 1948; in addition to all cartoons released in August 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Warner Bros.]] library and the [[Fleischer Studios|Fleischer]] and [[Famous Studios]] [[Popeye]] cartoons that both were once the property of [[Associated Artists Productions]], which merged with UA Television in 1958).

===TNT and Cartoon Network===
Turner used these to add cable channels. In 1988, he introduced [[Turner Network Television]] (TNT) with ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]].'' TNT, initially showing older movies and television shows, added original programs and newer reruns. Since launch in 1994, [[Turner Classic Movies]] broadcast the older Warner Bros, RKO, and MGM libraries. TNT used [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) to attract a broader audience.

In 1992, the MGM library, which included Warner Brothers properties including the early [[Looney Tunes]] and [[Merrie Melodies]] libraries and also the Fleischer Studios and Famous Studios Popeye cartoons, became the core of [[Cartoon Network]]. A year before, Turner's companies purchased [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] (whose longtime parent, [[Taft Broadcasting|Taft/Great American Broadcasting]], had been headquartered in Turner's original hometown of Cincinnati), adding additional content. With the 1996 [[Time Warner]] merger, the channel's archives gained the later [[Warner Bros.]] cartoon library.

In the mid-1980s, Turner became a force for the [[Film colorization|colorization]] of black-and-white films. In 1985, the film ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'' became the first black-and-white movie redistributed in color after computer coloring. Despite opposition by film aficionados, stars, and directors, the movie won over a section of the public,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0035575/trivia |title=Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942) – Trivia |publisher=Imdb.com |date= |accessdate=March 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Turner colorized a majority of films that he had owned. However, in the mid-1990s, the cost led Turner to abandon the idea. In contrast with TNT, TCM has shown the unaltered versions of films.

===Turner Entertainment===
[[Turner Entertainment|Turner Entertainment Co.]] was established in August 1986 to oversee film properties owned by Ted Turner. In 1988, Turner purchased [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] which he renamed [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) which became the main competitor to [[Vince McMahon]]'s [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF). In 2001, under [[Time Warner|AOL Time Warner]], it was [[WWE#Acquisition of WCW and ECW|sold to the World Wrestling Federation]].

In 1989, Turner created the [[Turner Tomorrow Fellowship Award|Turner Tomorrow Fellowship]] for fiction offering positive solutions to global problems. The winner, from 2500 entries worldwide, was [[Daniel Quinn]]'s ''[[Ishmael (novel)|Ishmael]].''

===Turner Foundation===
In 1990, he created the Turner Foundation, which focuses on philanthropic grants in environment and population. In the same year he created [[Captain Planet]], an environmental [[superhero]]. Turner produced two TV series with him as featured character.
Turner appeared in [[Gettysburg (1993 film)|''Gettysburg'']] as [[Colonel]] [[Waller T. Patton]] in 1993 and reprised the role in the 2003 prequel ''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]''; he produced both films.

===MIBC===
In 1993, Turner and Russian journalist Eduard Sagalajev founded The Moscow Independent Broadcasting Corporation. This corporation operated the sixth frequency in Russian television and founded the Russian channel [[TV-6 (Russia)|TV-6]]. The company was later purchased by Russian businessman [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]] and an unknown group of private persons. In 2007 the license for TV-6 had expired and there was no application for renewal.

===Time Warner merger===
[[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner Broadcasting System, Inc]]. merged with [[Time Warner|Time Warner, Inc.]] on October 10, 1996, with Turner as [[chair (official)|vice chairman]] and head of Time Warner and Turner's cable networks division.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/09/23/MN70161.DTL|last=Pelline|first=Jeff|date=September 23, 1995|title=Time Warner Closes Deal for Turner|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turner was dropped as head of cable networks by CEO [[Gerald Levin]] but remained as Vice Chairman of Time Warner. He resigned as Time Warner vice chairman in 2003 and then from the board of directors in 2006.

On January 11, 2001, [[Time Warner]] was purchased by [[AOL]] to become AOL Time Warner, a merger which Turner initially supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1023-250781.html |title=AOL, Time Warner complete merger with FCC blessing |work=CNET |first1=Patrick |last1=Ross |first2=Evan |last2=Hansen |date=January 11, 2001 |accessdate=June 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the burst of the dotcom bubble hurt the growth and profitability of the AOL division which in turned dragged down the combined company's performance and stock price. At a board meeting in fall 2001, Turner's outburst against AOL Time Warner CEO [[Gerald Levin]] eventually led to the latter's announced resignation effective in early 2002, being replaced by [[Richard Parsons (businessman)|Richard Parsons]]. In contrast to Levin who as CEO isolated Turner from important company matters, Parsons did invite Turner back to provide strategic advice although Turner never received an operational role that he sought.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ninamunk.com/documents/PowerFailure.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The company dropped &quot;AOL&quot; from its name in 2003. In December 2009, AOL was spun off from the Time Warner conglomerate as a separate company.

Turner was Time Warner's biggest individual shareholder. It is estimated he lost as much as $7&amp;nbsp;billion when the stock collapsed in the wake of the merger. When asked about buying back his former assets, he replied that he can't afford them now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/24/AR2006022401888.html |title=Turner To Leave Time Warner February 25, 2006 |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date= February 25, 2006|accessdate=March 24, 2010 | first=Steven | last=Levingston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rivalry with Murdoch and Fox==
Turner has a long-running grudge with fellow cable magnate [[Rupert Murdoch]]. This originated in 1983 when a Murdoch-sponsored yacht collided with Turner's boat during the [[Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race]], causing it to sink 10&amp;nbsp;km from the finish line. At the post-race dinner, Turner savaged Murdoch, later challenging him to a televised fistfight in Las Vegas.&lt;ref name=&quot;turnermurdoch&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/apr/25/newscorporation.pressandpublishing |title=Turner: Murdoch is a 'warmonger' |work=[[The Guardian]] |date= April 23, 2003|accessdate=March 12, 2011 | first= | last= |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2003, Turner challenged Murdoch to a fistfight, and later accused Murdoch of being a &quot;warmonger&quot; as Murdoch was backing President [[George W. Bush]]'s invasion of Iraq. {{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

==Atlanta Braves==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=January 2012}}
For most of his first decade as owner of the Braves, Turner was a very hands-on owner. He said, &quot;Managing isn't that difficult; you just have to score more runs than the other guy.&quot; In 1977, he sent manager [[Dave Bristol]] on a &quot;scouting trip&quot; so Turner could manage the Braves; he ran the team for one game (a loss) before [[National League]] president [[Chub Feeney]] told him managers are forbidden to own financial interest in their club. In the mid-1980s Turner began leaving day-to-day operations to the baseball operations staff.

==Achievements==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2012}}

He used to be America's largest private [[landholder|landowner]], owning approximately {{convert|2000000|acre|km2}}, greater than the land areas of [[Delaware]] and [[Rhode Island]] combined. According to [[documentary film]]maker [[Michael Moore]], Turner's land has a higher [[gross domestic product]] than [[Belize]]. He has the largest private [[American Bison|bison]] herd, with 50,000 head.

WCW television ratings were also heavily competing with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Monday Night Football]].

After the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|American-led boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics]], Turner founded the [[Goodwill Games]] as a statement for peace through sports.

In 1990, the [[American Humanist Association]] named Turner the Humanist of the Year.

In 1998, Turner pledged to donate $1&amp;nbsp;billion of his then $3&amp;nbsp;billion to [[United Nations]] causes, and created the [[United Nations Foundation]] to administer the gift. The foundation &quot;builds and implements public-private partnerships to address the world’s most pressing problems, and broadens support for the UN through advocacy and public outreach.&quot; In 2006, the foundation delivered its billionth dollar to UN causes — $600m of which came from Turner and $400m from public and private partners. Turner has pledged to use the remaining $400m of his commitment to leverage additional funds for UN causes and activities.

Turner served in the [[United States Coast Guard]]. He is also a recipient of the [[Albert Schweitzer Gold Medal for Humanitarianism]].

In 2006, Turner received the [[The Franklin Institute Awards|Bower Award]] for Business Leadership from The [[Franklin Institute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TFI_award&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fi.edu/winners/2006/turner_ted.faw?winner_id=4379|title=R.E.

==Politics==
On September 19, 2006, in a Reuters Newsmaker conference, Turner said of Iran's nuclear position: &quot;They're a sovereign state. We have 28,000. Why can't they have 10? We don't say anything about Israel — they've got 100 of them approximately — or India or Pakistan or Russia.&quot;
A proponent of [[America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009|Obama’s healthcare bill]], Turner has said: “We’re the only first world country that doesn’t have universal healthcare and it’s a disgrace.”&lt;ref name=&quot;creativeleadershipsummit.org&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.creativeleadershipsummit.org/?q=node/788/ Working Lunch 1: In Conversation with Ted Turner].&quot; Global Creative Leadership Summit, September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, in the wake of both the [[Upper Big Branch Mine disaster]] in [[West Virginia]] on April 5, that killed 29 miners and on the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] in the [[Gulf of Mexico]] that killed 11 crew on April 20, Turner stated on CNN that &quot;I'm just wondering if God is telling us He doesn't want to drill offshore. And right before that, we had that coal mine disaster in West Virginia where we lost 29 miners . . . Maybe the Lord's tired of having the mountains of West Virginia, the tops knocked off of them so they may get more coal. I think maybe we ought to just leave the coal in the ground and go with solar and wind power and geothermals . . . &quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Stupid Quotes.&quot; In ''The Limbaugh Letter.'' July 2010. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on the shifting media landscape==
Turner claims to have predicted the demise of newspapers 30 years ago and has called print journalism “an obsolete way of distributing information.”&lt;ref name=&quot;creativeleadershipsummit.org&quot;/&gt; Ted Turner also became more critical of media consolidation around 2004. He expressed some regret that he took advantage of the relaxed rules that allowed greater concentration of media ownership, and raised concerns about the quality of information and debate in an environment where the news is controlled by only a few wealthy corporations and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Turner, Ted. [http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0407.turner.html &quot;My Beef With Big Media&quot;], Washington Monthly, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Books==
In the 1997 biography ''It Ain't As Easy as It Looks'' by Porter Bibb, Turner discussed his use of lithium and struggles with his illness. In 2008, Turner wrote ''[[Call Me Ted]],'' which documents his career and personal life.

==Personal life==
Turner has been married and divorced three times: to Judy Nye (1960–64), Jane Shirley Smith (1965–88), and actress [[Jane Fonda]] (1991–2001). He has five children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2008/04/01/1/a-conversation-with-ted-turner A Conversation With Ted Turner], at time 48:40. Retrieved April 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Through Turner Enterprises, he owns 15 ranches in [[Kansas]], [[Montana]], [[Nebraska]], [[New Mexico]], [[Oklahoma]], and [[South Dakota]].&lt;ref name=tturner&gt;{{cite web|title=125 Montana Newsmakers: Ted Turner|url=http://www.greatfallstribune.com/multimedia/125newsmakers5/turner.html|work=Great Falls Tribune|author=Tribune staff|accessdate=August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;enterprises1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tedturner.com/enterprises/ranches_Template.asp?page=ranches_faq.html |title=Ranches |publisher=Ted Turner |date= |accessdate=March 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Totaling {{convert|1910585|acre|km2}}, his US land-holdings make Turner one of the largest individual landowners in North America (by acreage).&lt;ref name=&quot;enterprises1&quot;/&gt;
