Woods turned professional in 1996, and by April 1997 he had already won his first major, the [[1997 Masters Tournament|1997 Masters]] in a record-breaking performance. He first reached the number one position in the [[Official World Golf Rankings|world rankings]] in June 1997. Through the 2000s, Woods was the dominant force in golf, spending 264 weeks from August 1999 to September 2004 and 281 weeks from June 2005 to October 2010 as world number one.

==Background and family==
Woods was born '''Eldrick Tont Woods''' in [[Cypress, California]], to [[Earl Woods|Earl]] (1932–2006) and Kultida (Tida) Woods (born 1944). He is the only child of their marriage, but does have two half-brothers, Earl Jr. (born 1955) and Kevin (born 1957), and a half-sister, Royce (born 1958) from the 18-year marriage of Earl Woods and his first wife, Barbara Woods Gray.&lt;ref&gt;''His Father's Son: Earl and Tiger Woods'', by Tom Callahan, 2010; ''The Wicked Game'', by Howard Sounes, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Earl, a retired [[lieutenant colonel]] and [[Vietnam War]] veteran, was of [[African American]], [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]], and possibly Chinese ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1517444/Earl-Woods.html Earl Woods]. Telegraph (June 5, 2006). Retrieved June 19, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Kultida (née Punsawad), originally from [[Thailand]] (where  Earl had met her on a tour of duty in 1968), is of mixed [[Thai people|Thai]], [[Han Chinese|Chinese]], and Dutch ancestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stripes&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title = Earning His Stripes |magazine=[[AsianWeek]] |url=http://www.asianweek.com/101196/tigerwoods.html |date=October 11, 1996 |accessdate=June 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He refers to his ethnic make-up as ''&quot;Cablinasian&quot;'' (a [[syllabic abbreviation]] he coined from [[Caucasian race|'''Ca'''ucasian]], [[Black people|'''Bl'''ack]], [[Native Americans in the United States|American '''In'''dian]], and [[Asian people|'''Asian''']]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Cablinasian&quot;&gt;{{cite news |agency=Associated Press |title=Woods stars on Oprah, says he's 'Cablinasian' |newspaper=[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]] |date=April 23, 1997 |url=http://www.lubbockonline.com/news/042397/woods.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071212010355/http://www.lubbockonline.com/news/042397/woods.htm |archivedate=December 12, 2007 |accessdate=June 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woods' first name, Eldrick, was coined by his mother because it began with &quot;E&quot; (for Earl) and ended with &quot;K&quot; (for Kultida). His middle name Tont is a traditional Thai name. He was nicknamed Tiger in honor of his father's friend Col. Vuong Dang Phong, who had also been known as Tiger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Tiger's dad gave us all some lessons to remember |publisher=Golf Digest |author=Callahan, Tom |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/news/story?id=2431953 |date=May 9, 2006 |accessdate =January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woods grew up in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], California. He was a child prodigy, introduced to golf before the age of two, by his athletic father Earl, a single-figure handicap amateur golfer who had been one of the earliest African-American college [[baseball]] players at [[Kansas State University]].&lt;ref&gt;''Training a Tiger: Raising a Winner in Golf and in Life'', by [[Earl Woods]] and Pete McDaniel, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1978, Tiger putted against comedian [[Bob Hope]] in a television appearance on ''[[The Mike Douglas Show]]''. At age three, he shot a 48 over nine holes over the Cypress Navy course, and at age five, he appeared in ''[[Golf Digest]]'' and on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[That's Incredible]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Tiger Woods Timeline|publisher=[[Infoplease]]|url=http://www.infoplease.com/spot/tigertime1.html|accessdate =May 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before turning seven, Tiger won the Under Age 10 section of the Drive, Pitch, and Putt competition, held at the Navy Golf Course in Cypress, California.&lt;ref&gt;''Training A Tiger'', by Earl Woods and Pete McDaniel, 1997, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 at the age of eight, he won the 9–10 boys' event, the youngest age group available, at the [[Junior World Golf Championships]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JWGC84&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = 1984 Champions|publisher=Junior World Golf Championships|url = http://www.juniorworldgolf.com/pchamps.php?pg=1984|accessdate =May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first broke 80 at age eight.&lt;ref&gt;''The Wicked Game: Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, and the Story of Modern Golf'', by Howard Sounes, 2004, William Morrow, New York, ISBN 0-06-051386-1, p. 187; originally appeared in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', Nike's Tiger Woods professional career launch advertisement, August 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to win the Junior World Championships six times, including four consecutive wins from 1988 to 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;JWGC85&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = 1985 Champions|publisher=Junior World Golf Championships|url = http://www.juniorworldgolf.com/pchamps.php?pg=1985|accessdate =May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JWGC88&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = 1988 Champions|publisher=Junior World Golf Championships|url = http://www.juniorworldgolf.com/pchamps.php?pg=1988|accessdate =May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JWGC89&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = 1989 Champions|publisher=Junior World Golf Championships|url = http://www.juniorworldgolf.com/pchamps.php?pg=1989.| accessdate =May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JWGC90&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = 1990 Champions|publisher=Junior World Golf Championships |url=http://www.juniorworldgolf.com/pchamps.php?pg=1990| accessdate =May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JWGC91&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = 1991 Champions|publisher=Junior World Golf Championships|url = http://www.juniorworldgolf.com/pchamps.php?pg=1991|accessdate =May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woods' father Earl wrote that Tiger first beat him when he was 11 years old, with Earl trying his best. Earl lost to Tiger every time from then on.&lt;ref&gt;''Training A Tiger: A Father's Guide to Raising a Winner in Both Golf and Life'', by [[Earl Woods]] with Pete McDaniel, 1997, Harper Collins, New York, ISBN 0-06-270178-9, p. 23;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Wicked Game: Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, and the Story of Modern Golf'', by Howard Sounes.&lt;/ref&gt; Woods first broke 70 on a regulation golf course at age 12.&lt;ref name=&quot;callahan1&quot;&gt;''His Father's Son: Earl and Tiger Woods'', by Tom Callahan, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

Woods' first major national junior tournament was the 1989 Big I, when he was 13 years old. Woods was paired with pro [[John Daly (golfer)|John Daly]], then relatively unknown, in the final round; the event's format placed a professional with each group of juniors who had qualified. Daly birdied three of the last four holes to beat Woods by only one stroke.&lt;ref&gt;''Training A Tiger: A Father's Guide to Raising a Winner in Both Golf and Life'', by [[Earl Woods]] with Pete McDaniel, 1997, Harper Collins, New York, ISBN 0-06-270178-9, p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt; As a young teenager, Woods first met [[Jack Nicklaus]] in Los Angeles at the [[Bel-Air Country Club]], when Nicklaus was performing a clinic for the club's members. Woods was part of the show, and impressed Nicklaus and the crowd with his skills and potential.&lt;ref&gt;''Jack Nicklaus: Memories and Mementos from Golf's Golden Bear'', by Jack Nicklaus with David Shedloski, 2007, Stewart, Tabori &amp; Chang, New York, ISBN 1-58479-564-6, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Earl Woods had researched in detail the career accomplishments of Nicklaus, and had set his young son the goals of breaking those records.&lt;ref name=&quot;callahan1&quot;/&gt;

While attending [[Western High School (Anaheim, California)|Western High School]] in Anaheim at the age of 15, Woods became the youngest ever [[U.S. Junior Amateur]] champion (a record which stood until it was broken by Jin Liu in 2010).&lt;ref name=&quot;USJA91&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = 1991 U.S. Junior Amateur|publisher=U.S. Junior Amateur|url = http://www.usjunioram.org/2002/history/champions/1991.html|accessdate =May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was named 1991's Southern California Amateur Player of the Year (for the second consecutive year) and Golf Digest Junior Amateur Player of the Year. In 1992, he defended his title at the U.S. Junior Amateur Championship, becoming the first multiple winner; competed in his first PGA Tour event, the [[Nissan Los Angeles Open]] (he missed the 36-hole cut); and was named Golf Digest Amateur Player of the Year, Golf World Player of the Year, and Golfweek National Amateur of the Year.&lt;ref name=&quot;USJA92&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = 1992 U.S. Junior Amateur|publisher=U.S. Junior Amateur|url = http://www.usjunioram.org/2002/history/champions/1992.html|accessdate =May 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IMG&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Tiger Woods|publisher=IMG Speakers|url =  http://www.imgspeakers.com/speakers/tiger_woods.aspx|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070429145830/http://www.imgspeakers.com/speakers/tiger_woods.aspx|archivedate = April 29, 2007|accessdate =June 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Woods won his third consecutive U.S. Junior Amateur Championship; he remains the event's only three-time winner.&lt;ref name=&quot;USJA93&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = 1993 U.S. Junior Amateur|publisher=U.S. Junior Amateur|url = http://www.usjunioram.org/2002/history/champions/1993.html|accessdate =May 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, at the [[TPC at Sawgrass]] in Florida, he became the youngest-ever winner of the [[United States Amateur Championship (golf)|U.S. Amateur Championship]], a record that stood until 2008 when it was broken by [[Danny Lee (golfer)|Danny Lee]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sounes, p. 277&quot;&gt;Sounes, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the American team at the 1994 [[Eisenhower Trophy]] [[World Amateur Golf Team Championships]] (winning), and the 1995 [[Walker Cup]] (losing).&lt;ref name=&quot;IGF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Notable Past Players|publisher=International Golf Federation|url = http://www.internationalgolffederation.org/History/notables.html|accessdate =May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = Ailing Woods Unsure for Walker Cup |newspaper=[[International Herald Tribune]]|author=Thomsen, Ian|date = September 9, 1995|url= http://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/09/sports/09iht-golf.t_0.html|accessdate =January 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Woods graduated from Western High School in 1994 at age 18, and was voted &quot;Most Likely to Succeed&quot; among the graduating class. He had starred for the high school's golf team under coach Don Crosby.&lt;ref&gt;''The Wicked Game: Arnold Palmer, Jack Nicklaus, Tiger Woods, and the Story of Modern Golf'', by Howard Sounes, 2004, William Morrow, New York, ISBN 0-06-051386-1, information listed on inset photos between pages 168 and 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

==College golf career==
Woods was recruited very heavily by college golf powers, and chose [[Stanford University]], the 1994 [[NCAA]] Division I champion.

It was the largest endorsing deal ever signed by an athlete at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ad1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title= Six Degrees Of Tiger Woods|author=DiCarlo, Lisa|newspaper=Forbes|date=March 18, 2004|url=http://www.forbes.com/2004/03/18/cx_ld_0318nike.html|accessdate=December 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woods' endorsement has been credited with playing a significant role in taking the Nike Golf brand from a &quot;start-up&quot; golf company earlier in the past decade, to becoming the leading golf apparel company in the world, and a major player in the equipment and golf ball market.&lt;ref name=&quot;sbr1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;end1&quot;&gt;[http://www.venturerepublic.com/resources/Branding_celebrities_brand_endorsements_brand_leadership.asp &quot; Branding and Celebrity Endorsements&quot;], ''VentureRepublic.com'', Retrieved on September 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Nike Golf is one of the fastest growing brands in the sport, with an estimated $600&amp;nbsp;million in sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;tm1&quot;&gt;Park, Alice., [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1609776,00.html &quot;Member of the Club&quot;], ''Time.com'', April 12, 2007, Retrieved on September 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Woods has been described as the &quot;ultimate endorser&quot; for Nike Golf,&lt;ref name=&quot;tm1&quot; /&gt; frequently seen wearing Nike gear during tournaments, and even in advertisements for other products.&lt;ref name=&quot;ad1&quot; /&gt; Woods receives a percentage from the sales of Nike Golf apparel, footwear, golf equipment, golf balls,&lt;ref name=&quot;sbr1&quot; /&gt; and has a building named after him at Nike’s headquarters campus in [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], Oregon.&lt;ref name=&quot;ad3&quot;&gt;AP, [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7493465/ &quot;Nike sees dollar signs in Woods’ magical shot&quot;], MSNBC.com, April 13, 2005, Retrieved on September 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Woods was involved in every aspect of the launch of [[Buick]]'s [[Buick Rendezvous|Rendezvous]] [[SUV]]. A company spokesman stated that Buick was happy with the value of Woods' endorsement, pointing out that more than 130,000 Rendezvous vehicles were sold in 2002 and 2003. &quot;That exceeded our forecasts,&quot; he was quoted as saying, &quot;It has to be in recognition of Tiger.&quot; In February 2004, Buick renewed Woods' endorsement contract for another five years, in a deal reportedly worth $40&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;ad1&quot; /&gt;

Woods collaborated closely with [[TAG Heuer]] to develop the world's first professional golf watch, released in April 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;watch1&quot;&gt;Krakow, Gary., [http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9773121/ &quot;Tiger Woods watch is a technological stroke&quot;]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}, ''[[MSNBC]].com'', November 7, 2005, Retrieved on June 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The lightweight, [[titanium]]-construction watch, designed to be worn while playing the game, incorporates numerous innovative design features to accommodate golf play.

Woods also endorses the [[Tiger Woods PGA Tour]] series of video games; he has done so since 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Woods|first=Tiger|coauthor=Rothman, Wilson|title=Q&amp;A with Tiger Woods|journal=Time|date=September 26, 2004|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101041004-702139,00.html|accessdate=July 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, he signed a six-year contract with [[Electronic Arts]], the series' publisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tiger Woods to play another six with EA|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|date=February 2, 2006|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6143591.html|accessdate=July 8, 2009|author=Tim Surette}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, along with Roger Federer and [[Thierry Henry]], Woods became an ambassador for the &quot;[[Global Gillette|Gillette]] Champions&quot; marketing campaign. Gillette did not disclose financial terms, though an expert estimated the deal could total between $10&amp;nbsp;million and $20&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Gillette lands a trio of star endorsers |author=Jenn Abelson |work=Boston Globe |date = February 5, 2007 |accessdate =October 17, 2007 |url = http://www.boston.com/business/globe/articles/2007/02/05/gillette_lands_a_trio_of_star_endorsers/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, [[Gatorade]] announced that Woods would have his own brand of sports drink starting in March 2008. &quot;Gatorade Tiger&quot; was his first U.S. deal with a beverage company and his first licensing agreement. Although no figures were officially disclosed, ''Golfweek'' magazine reported that it was for five years and could pay him as much as $100&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gatorade Unveils a Taste of Tiger|work=The Washington Post|date=October 17, 2007|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/16/AR2007101601764.html|accessdate=June 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company decided in early fall 2009 to discontinue the drink due to weak sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-ap-us-tiger-woods-gatorade,0,4088989.story|title=Gatorade confirms it is dropping Tiger Woods drink, but decided to before fateful car wreck|date=December 9, 2009|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=December 9, 2009 | work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Golf Digest'', Woods made $769,440,709 from 1996 to 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = The Fortunate 50 |author=Jonah Freedman |url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/more/specials/fortunate50/2007/ |work=Sports Illustrated | year=2007 |accessdate =May 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the magazine predicted that by 2010, Woods would pass one billion dollars in earnings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Golf Digest 50|publisher=[[Golf Digest]]|url=http://www.golfdigest.com/magazine/2008/02/gd50|accessdate=January 11, 2007|date=February 2008|first=Ron|last=Sirak}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, ''[[Forbes]]'' confirmed that Woods was indeed the world's first athlete to earn over a billion dollars in his career (before taxes), after accounting for the $10&amp;nbsp;million bonus Woods received for the [[FedEx Cup]] title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report: Tiger richest athlete in history|publisher=ESPN|date=October 2, 2009|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/news/story?id=4524640|accessdate=October 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Woods is sports' first billion-dollar man|work=Forbes|publisher=Yahoo!

In July 2011, Woods appeared on a 15-second Japanese television commercial, endorsing a heat back rub by Kowa Co., the Vantelin Kowa rub. Details of the deal, which was made in late 2010, were not disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2011687/Tiger-Woods-endorses-Japanese-heat-rub-Is-really-appropriate.html |title=Is that really an appropriate item to be advertising?

In October 2012, it was announced that Woods had signed an exclusive endorsement deal with Fuse Science, Inc, a [[sports nutrition]] firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pga.com/news/industry-news/sports-nutrition-firm-fuse-science-signs-sponsor-tiger-woods-bag |title=Sports nutrition firm Fuse Science signs on as sponsor of Woods' bag |publisher=[[PGA]] |author=Associated Press |accessdate=October 25, 2012 }} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Tiger-proofing===
Early in Woods' career, a small number of golf experts expressed concern about his impact on the competitiveness of the game and the public appeal of professional golf. Sportswriter Bill Lyon of [[Knight-Ridder]] asked in a column, &quot;Isn't Tiger Woods actually bad for golf?&quot; (though Lyon ultimately concluded that he was not).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bad&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Woods bad for golf? There's an unplayable lie |publisher=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]] |author=Lyon, Bill |date=August 16, 2000 |accessdate=May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; At first, some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of competition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete and relegating opponents to simply competing for second place each week.

A related effect was measured by economist Jennifer Brown of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] who found that other golfers played worse when competing against Woods than when he was not in the tournament. The scores of highly skilled (exempt) golfers are nearly one stroke higher when playing against Woods. This effect was larger when he was on winning streaks and disappeared during his well-publicized slump in 2003–04. Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar skill can hope to win by increasing their level of effort, but that, when facing a &quot;superstar&quot; competitor, extra exertion does not significantly raise one's level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion, leading to reduced effort.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Jennifer; [http://home.business.utah.edu/finmh/Brown_Quitters_Never_Win.pdf ''Quitters Never Win: The (Adverse) Incentive Effects of Competing with Superstars''], Job Market Paper, November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Many courses in the PGA Tour rotation (including Major Championship sites like [[Augusta National Golf Club|Augusta National]]) have added yardage to their tees in an effort to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Woods, a strategy that became known as &quot;Tiger-Proofing&quot;. Woods said he welcomed the change, in that adding yardage to courses did not affect his ability to win.&lt;ref name=&quot;Open2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title = Tiger Woods Press Conference:The Open Championship |publisher=TigerWoods.com |author=ASAP Sports |date = July 12, 2005 |url = http://www.tigerwoods.com/defaultflash.sps?page=fullstorynews&amp;iNewsID=199184&amp;categoryID=&amp;pagenumber=1&amp;cat=0 |accessdate =May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Woods first joined the professional tour in 1996, his long drives had a large impact on the world of golf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = Woods threatens all records at the Masters |agency=Associated Press |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050330233915/http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamGolf97Masters/apr13_tig.html|archivedate = March 30, 2005 |url = http://slam.canoe.ca/SlamGolf97Masters/apr12_mastersthird.html |publisher=[[Canadian Online Explorer]]|date = April 12, 1997|accessdate=August 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/augusta/stories/041497/20Woods.html |agency=Associated Press |title= Tiger had more than just length in annihilating Augusta |work=Sports Illustrated |date = April 14, 1997 |accessdate =June 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when he did not upgrade his equipment in the following years (insisting upon the use of True Temper Dynamic Gold steel-shafted clubs and smaller steel clubheads that promoted accuracy over distance),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.golftransactions.com/equipment/truetemper070903.html |author=Cara Polinski |publisher=The Wire |title = True Temper Wins Again! |date =July 8, 2003 |accessdate =August 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; many opponents caught up to him. Phil Mickelson even made a joke in 2003 about Woods using &quot;inferior equipment&quot;, which did not sit well with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], [[Titleist]] or Woods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/story?id=1507979 |title = Woods, Mickelson clear the air, put spat behind them |publisher=ESPN |date = February 13, 2003 |accessdate =August 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.golftoday.co.uk/news/yeartodate/news03/mickelson1.html |title = Phil Mickelson clarifies Tiger comments |publisher=Golf Today |accessdate =August 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 2004, Woods finally upgraded his driver technology to a larger clubhead and [[graphite]] shaft, which, coupled with his clubhead speed, made him one of the Tour's lengthier players off the [[Tee#Golf tee|tee]] once again.

Despite his power advantage, Woods has always focused on developing an excellent all-around game. Although in recent years he has typically been near the bottom of the Tour rankings in driving accuracy, his iron play is generally accurate, his recovery and bunker play is very strong, and his putting (especially under pressure) is possibly his greatest asset. He is largely responsible for a shift to higher standards of athleticism amongst professional golfers, and is known for putting in more hours of practice than most.&lt;ref name=&quot;linkageinc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = CASE STUDY: Tiger Woods|publisher=Linkage Incorporated|url = http://www.linkageinc.com/company/news_events/link_learn_enewsletter/archive/2002/03_02_case_study_tiger_woods.aspx|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061015151438/http://www.linkageinc.com/company/news_events/link_learn_enewsletter/archive/2002/03_02_case_study_tiger_woods.aspx|archivedate = October 15, 2006|accessdate =June 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;par&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = When Par isn't good enough|publisher=APMP.org|url = http://209.85.165.104/search?q=cache:XkXY0D7wsSEJ:www.apmp.org/fv-63.aspx+tiger+woods+long+hours+of+practice&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=18&amp;gl=us|accessdate =May 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title = Tiger Woods Up Close And Personal|publisher=[[CBS News]]|author=Ed Bradley|date = September 3, 2006|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/23/60minutes/main1433767_page5.shtml|accessdate =May 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From mid-1993, while he was still an amateur, until 2004, Woods worked almost exclusively with leading swing coach [[Butch Harmon]]. From mid-1997, Harmon and Woods fashioned a major redevelopment of Woods' full swing, achieving greater consistency, better distance control, and better [[kinesiology]]. The changes began to pay off in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Pro: Lessons About Golf and Life from My Father, Claude Harmon, Sr.|author=Harmon, Butch |year=2006|publisher=Three Rivers Press|isbn=0-307-33804-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; From March 2004 to 2010, Woods was coached by [[Hank Haney]], who worked on flattening his swing plane. Woods continued to win tournaments with Haney, but his driving accuracy dropped significantly. Haney resigned in May 2010 and was replaced by [[Sean Foley (golf instructor)|Sean Foley]].

Woods has won 74 official [[PGA Tour]] events including 14 [[Men's major golf championships|majors]]. He is 14–1 when going into the final round of a major with at least a share of the lead. He has been heralded as &quot;the greatest closer in history&quot; by multiple golf experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Tiger is greatest closer ever|url =http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/14002254/ |author=Mike Celizic |publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date = July 24, 2006 |accessdate=August 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Goliath will surely fall one day.

He has spent the most consecutive and cumulative weeks atop the world rankings.

===Tiger Woods Foundation===
The [[Tiger Woods Foundation]] was established in 1996 by Woods and his father Earl, with the primary goal of promoting golf among inner-city children.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mattingly Expected to Retire After Sitting Out 1996 Season.&quot; The Los Angeles Times, January 22, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brennan, Patricia. &quot;The Changing Face of Golf; A CBS Profile of the Hottest Guy on the Links.&quot; The Washington Post, April 13, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation has conducted junior golf clinics across the country, and sponsors the Tiger Woods Foundation National Junior Golf Team in the Junior World Golf Championships.&lt;ref name=clinton&gt;{{cite web  | title = With Clinton at his side, Woods opens his learning center  | publisher = GolfWeb Wire Services  | date = February 10, 2006  | url = http://www.pgatour.com/story/9223725/  | accessdate = January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Programs: TWLC: Junior Golf Team  | publisher = Tiger Woods Foundation  | url = http://web.tigerwoodsfoundation.org/programs/twlc/juniorGolfTeam  | accessdate = January 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of December 2010, TWF employed approximately 55 people.&lt;ref name=harig&gt;{{cite web  | last = Harig  | first = Bob  | title = Tiger Woods' foundation suffered greatly  | publisher = ESPN.com  | date = December 1, 2010  | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/columns/story?columnist=harig_bob&amp;id=5865712  | accessdate = January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Lamport-Stokes  | first = Mark  | title = Tiger eyes legacy away from sport  | publisher = Reuters  | date = December 17, 2007  | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/12/17/us-golf-tiger-idUSSP9924320071217  | accessdate = January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation operates the [[Tiger Woods Learning Center]], a $50 million, 35,000-square-foot facility in [[Anaheim, California]], providing college-access programs for underserved youth.&lt;ref name=clinton/&gt;&lt;ref name=harig/&gt;&lt;ref name=stuart&gt;{{cite web | title = Tiger visits new TWLC Florida campus in Stuart  | publisher = Tiger Woods Foundation  | date = December 9, 2011  | url = http://web.tigerwoodsfoundation.org/news/article/2011120926138040/twlc/  | accessdate = January 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The TWLC opened in 2006 and features seven classrooms, extensive multi-media facilities and an outdoor golf teaching area.&lt;ref name=clinton/&gt; The center has since expanded to four additional campuses: two in [[Washington, DC]]; one in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]; and one in [[Stuart, Florida]].&lt;ref name=stuart/&gt;

===Tiger Woods Design===
In November 2006, Woods announced his intention to begin designing golf courses around the world through a new company, [[Tiger Woods Design]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Soltau  | first = Mark  | title = Tiger Woods' next step: Design golf courses  | publisher = ESPN.com  | date = November 6, 2006  | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/news/story?id=2651591  | accessdate = January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, he announced that the company's first course would be in [[Dubai]] as part of a 25.3 million-square-foot development, [[The Tiger Woods Dubai]].&lt;ref name=dubai&gt;{{cite news  | last = Wolfensberger  | first = Marc  | title = Tiger Woods Will Design First Golf Course in Dubai  | publisher = Bloomberg  | date = December 3, 2006  | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aNvm0ZjXUZ3M  | accessdate = January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Al Ruwaya Golf Course was initially expected to finish construction in 2009.&lt;ref name=dubai/&gt; As of February 2010, only seven holes had been completed; in April 2011, the New York Times reported that the project had been shelved permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Fattah  | first = Zainab  | title = Tiger Woods’s Dubai Golf Resort Will Be Completed, Builder Says  | publisher = Bloomberg  | date = February 1, 2010  | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a3KSfSvghqjA  | accessdate = January 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sullivan&gt;Sullivan, Paul.

Tiger Woods Design has taken on two other courses, neither of which has materialized. In August 2007, Woods announced The Cliffs at High Carolina, a private course in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] near [[Asheville, North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Tiger to design his first U.S. course |work=ESPN |url = http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/news/story?id=2974491 |accessdate =August 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a groundbreaking in November 2008, the project suffered cash flow problems and suspended construction.&lt;ref name=sullivan/&gt; A third course, in [[Punta Brava Golf Club|Punta Brava]], Mexico, was announced in October 2008, but incurred delays due to issues with permits and an [[environmental impact study]].&lt;ref name=sullivan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Louis |first=Brian |coauthors=Taub, Daniel |title=Tiger Woods and Flagship to Build Mexico Golf Resort |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |date=October 7, 2008 |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&amp;sid=ao2vcPf3MUek&amp;refer=us |accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction on the Punta Brava course has not yet begun.&lt;ref name=sullivan/&gt;

The problems encountered by these projects have been credited to factors including overly optimistic estimates of their value; declines throughout the global economy, particularly the [[United States housing bubble|U.S. crash in home prices]]; and decreased appeal of Woods following his 2009 infidelity scandal.&lt;ref name=sullivan/&gt;

===Writings===
Woods wrote a golf instruction column for ''[[Golf Digest]]'' magazine from 1997 to February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = New deal includes instruction, Web pieces|agency=Associated Press|date = May 8, 2002|publisher=ESPN|url = http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/story?id=1380039|accessdate =June 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 he wrote a best-selling golf instruction book, ''How I Play Golf'', which had the largest print run of any golf book for its first edition, 1.5&amp;nbsp;million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/2001-10-09-tiger-woods.htm |title=Tiger Woods joins the club of golf book authors |accessdate=June 20, 2008 |last=Snider |first=Mike |date=October 9, 2001 |work=USA Today |publisher=[[Gannett Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==

===Marriage and children===
In November 2003, Woods became engaged to [[Elin Nordegren]], a Swedish former model and daughter of former minister of migration [[Barbro Holmberg]] and radio journalist [[Thomas Nordegren]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=December 4, 2009 |url= http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/12/03/elin.five.things.to.know/index.html?iref=mpstoryview

Woods and Nordegren's first child, a daughter named Sam Alexis Woods, was born on June 18, 2007. Woods chose the name because his own father had always called him Sam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Woods played U.S. Open while wife was in hospital|author=White, Joseph|newspaper=USA Today|agency=Associated Press|date=July 3, 2007|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/golf/2007-07-03-2162604389_x.htm|accessdate=December 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their son, Charlie Axel Woods, was born on February 8, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tiger becomes dad for second time|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/golf/news/story?id=3893647|publisher=ESPN|agency=Associated Press|date=February 9, 2009|accessdate=February 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infidelity scandal and fallout===
On November 25, 2009, [[supermarket tabloid]] ''[[The National Enquirer]]'' published a story claiming that Woods had an [[extramarital sex|extramarital affair]] with New York City nightclub manager [[Rachel Uchitel]], a claim she denied.&lt;ref name=Apology&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/12/02/golf-woods-idUSGEE5B11VL20091202|title=Tiger Woods admits &quot;transgressions,&quot; apologizes|date=December 2, 2009|agency=[[Reuters]]|accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, around 2:30 AM on November 27, Woods left home in his [[Cadillac Escalade]] SUV and, while still on his street, collided with a fire hydrant, a tree, and several hedges.&lt;ref name=UsaT&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/golf/pga/2009-12-02-woods-crash-damage_N.htm|title=Woods crash did $3,200 damage to hydrant, tree |last=DiMeglio|first=Steve |date=December 3, 2009|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was treated for minor facial lacerations and received a ticket for careless driving.&lt;ref name=UsaT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/golf/tiger-injured-in-latenight-car-accident-1830059.html |title=Tiger injured in late-night car accident |newspaper=The Independent|date=November 28, 2009 |accessdate=January 23, 2012 |first=James |last=Corrigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following intense media speculation about the accident, Woods released a statement on his website taking sole responsibility for the accident, calling it a &quot;private matter&quot; and crediting his wife for helping him from the car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/golf/2009-11-29-4208750340_x.htm|title=Tiger Woods issues statement on crash |agency=Associated Press |date=November 30, 2009|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=January 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.tigerwoods.com/news/article/200911297726222/news/|title=Statement from Tiger Woods|date=November 29, 2009|publisher=TigerWoods.com|accessdate=January 23, 2012|author=Tiger Woods}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 30, Woods announced that he would not be appearing at his own charity golf tournament, the [[Chevron World Challenge]], nor any other tournaments in 2009, due to his injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Tiger Woods Cancels Tourney Appearance|publisher=CBS News|date=November 30, 2009|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/11/30/sportsline/main5838742.shtml|accessdate=September 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 2, following the release by ''[[US Weekly]]'' of a voicemail message allegedly left by Tiger for a mistress, Woods released another statement in which he admitted &quot;transgressions&quot; and apologized to &quot;all of those who have supported [him] over the years&quot;, while reiterating his and his family's right to privacy.&lt;ref name=Apology /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.tigerwoods.com/news/article/200912027740572/news/|title=Tiger comments on current events|date=December 2, 2009|publisher=TigerWoods.com|accessdate=December 4, 2009|author=Tiger Woods}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next several days, more than a dozen women claimed in various media outlets to have had affairs with Woods.&lt;ref name=legend&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2009Dec12/0,4670,GLFTigerapossTerribleTime,00.html|title=Two weeks that shattered the legend of Tiger Woods|last=Dahlberg|first=Tim|date=December 12, 2009|agency=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=January 23, 2012|work=Fox News}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 11, he released a third statement admitting to infidelity and apologizing again, as well as announcing that he would be taking &quot;an indefinite break from professional golf.&quot;&lt;ref name=legend/&gt;

On February 19, 2010, Woods gave a televised statement in which he said he had been in a 45-day therapy program since the end of December.
