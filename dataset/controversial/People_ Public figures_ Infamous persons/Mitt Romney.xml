&lt;!-- NOTE ABOUT THE LEAD: Before considering any changes to the lead, please consult the consensus established at Talk:Mitt_Romney/GA2#Politician and more recent discussion at Talk:Mitt_Romney --&gt;

'''Willard Mitt Romney''' (born March 12, 1947) is an American businessman and the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party's]] nominee for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 election]]. From 2003 to 2007, he served as the [[List of Governors of Massachusetts|70th]] [[Governor of Massachusetts]].

Raised in [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan]] by his parents [[Lenore Romney|Lenore]] and [[George W. Romney]], Mitt Romney spent two and a half years in [[France]] as a [[Missionary (LDS Church)|Mormon missionary]] starting in 1966. He married [[Ann Romney|Ann Davies]] in 1969, with whom he has had five children. By 1971, Romney had participated in the political campaigns of both his parents.  In that year, he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Brigham Young University|Brigham Young]] and in 1975, a [[JD/MBA|joint]] [[Juris Doctor]] and [[Master of Business Administration]] from [[Harvard University|Harvard]]. Romney then entered the [[management consulting]] industry and in 1977 he secured a position at [[Bain &amp; Company]]. Later serving as its [[chief executive officer]], he helped lead the company out of financial crisis&lt;!-- this is supported by detailed material and sources in body of article --&gt;. In 1984, he cofounded and led the spin-off company [[Bain Capital]], a highly profitable [[private equity]] investment firm that became one of the [[List of private equity firms#Largest private equity firms|largest of its kind]] in the nation&lt;!-- this is supported by detailed material and sources in body of article --&gt;. His considerable net worth, estimated in 2012 at $190–250&amp;nbsp;million, helped finance his prior political campaigns.&lt;!-- this is supported by detailed material and sources in body of article, which say he is not self-funding in 2012 --&gt;

Active in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], Romney served during his business career as the [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishop of his ward]] (head of his local congregation) and then [[Stake (LDS Church)|stake president]] in his home area near [[Boston]].  After stepping down from Bain Capital and his local leadership role in the church, he ran as the Republican candidate in the [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1994|1994 Massachusetts election for U.S. Senate]]. Upon losing to longtime incumbent [[Ted Kennedy]], he resumed his position at Bain Capital. Years later, a successful stint as President and CEO of the [[Salt Lake Organizing Committee for the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games of 2002|Salt Lake Organizing Committee]] for the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] led to a relaunch of his political career.

[[Massachusetts gubernatorial election, 2002|Elected Governor of Massachusetts in 2002]], Romney helped develop and enact into law the [[Massachusetts health care reform]] legislation, the first of its kind in the nation, which provided near-universal health insurance access through state-level subsidies and [[health insurance mandate|individual mandates to purchase insurance]]. He also presided over the elimination of a projected $1.2–1.5&amp;nbsp;billion deficit through a combination of spending cuts, increased fees, and the closure of corporate [[tax loophole]]s. Romney did not seek re-election in 2006, instead focusing on his campaign for the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2008|Republican nomination in the 2008 U.S. presidential election]].  He won several [[United States presidential primary|primaries and caucuses]] but lost the nomination to [[John McCain]]. In 2011, he began campaigning for the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012|2012 Republican presidential nomination]], eventually winning enough caucuses and primaries to be [[2012 Republican National Convention|nominated]] with his chosen [[running mate]], Representative [[Paul Ryan]]. Romney faces incumbent President [[Barack Obama]] in the November 2012 general election.

Initially, Bain Capital focused on [[venture capital]] investments. Romney set up a system in which any partner could veto one of these potential opportunities, and he personally saw so many weaknesses that few venture capital investments were approved in the initial two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;bgseries3&quot; /&gt; The firm's first significant success was a 1986 investment to help start [[Staples Inc.]], after founder [[Thomas G.

[[File:Bain Capital.png|thumb|left|246px|alt=Plain logo consisting of white serif letters against dark blue background|Logo of Bain Capital, the [[private equity firm]] Romney cofounded in 1984]] Romney soon switched Bain Capital's focus from startups to the relatively new business of [[leveraged buyouts]]: buying existing companies with money mostly borrowed from banking institutions using the newly bought companies' assets as collateral, then taking steps to improve the companies' value, and finally selling those companies once their value peaked, usually within a few years.&lt;ref name=&quot;bgseries3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;howmakemoney&quot; /&gt; Bain Capital lost money in many of its early leveraged buyouts, but then found deals that made large returns.&lt;ref name=&quot;bgseries3&quot; /&gt; The firm invested in or acquired [[Accuride]], [[Brookstone]], [[Domino's Pizza]], [[Sealy Corporation]], [[Sports Authority]], and [[Artisan Entertainment]], as well as some lesser-known companies in the industrial and medical sectors.&lt;ref name=&quot;bgseries3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;howmakemoney&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2001/08/20/daily27.html | title=Bain Capital's Romney aiming for politics after Olympics | newspaper=[[Boston Business Journal]] | date=August 23, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the firm's profit was earned from a relatively small number of deals; Bain Capital's overall success-to-failure ratio was about even.{{#tag:ref|One study of 68&amp;nbsp;deals that Bain Capital made during Romney's time there found that the firm lost money or broke even on 33 of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;vf-excerpt&quot; /&gt; Another study that looked at the eight-year period following 77&amp;nbsp;deals during Romney's time found that in 17&amp;nbsp;cases the company went bankrupt or out of business, and in 6&amp;nbsp;cases Bain Capital lost all its investment.

Romney discovered few investment opportunities himself (and those that he did, often failed to make money for the firm).&lt;ref name=&quot;real-155&quot; /&gt; Instead, he focused on analyzing the merits of possible deals that others brought forward and on recruiting investors to participate in them once approved.&lt;ref name=&quot;real-155&quot;&gt;Kranish; Helman, ''The Real Romney'', pp. 141, 155.&lt;/ref&gt;  Within Bain Capital, Romney spread profits from deals widely within the firm to keep people motivated, often keeping less than ten percent for himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-depagr&quot; /&gt;
Data-driven, Romney often played the role of a [[devil's advocate]] during exhaustive analysis of whether to go forward with a deal.&lt;ref name=&quot;bgseries3&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nym-onep&quot; /&gt; He wanted to drop a Bain Capital [[hedge fund]] that initially lost money, but other partners disagreed with him and it eventually gained billions.&lt;ref name=&quot;bgseries3&quot; /&gt; He opted out of the Artisan Entertainment deal, not wanting to profit from a studio that produced [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated films]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bgseries3&quot; /&gt; Romney served on the board of directors of Damon Corporation, a medical testing company later found guilty of defrauding the government; Bain Capital tripled its investment before selling off the company, and the fraud was discovered by the new owners (Romney was never implicated).&lt;ref name=&quot;bgseries3&quot; /&gt; In some cases, Romney had little involvement with a company once acquired.&lt;ref name=&quot;blum&quot; /&gt;

Romney sought to bring near-universal health insurance coverage to the state.  This came after Staples founder Stemberg told him at the start of his term that doing so would be the best way he could help people.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-hc-1&quot; /&gt; Another factor was that the federal government, owing to the rules of [[Medicaid]] funding, threatened to cut $385&amp;nbsp;million in those payments to Massachusetts if the state did not reduce the number of uninsured recipients of health care services.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt040606&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bgseries7&quot; /&gt; Although the idea of universal health insurance had not come to the fore during the campaign, Romney decided that because people without insurance still received expensive health care, the money spent by the state for such care could be better used to subsidize insurance for the poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-hc-1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/health/articles/2011/05/30/romney_and_health_care_in_the_thick_of_history/?page=full | title = Romney and health care: In the thick of history | author=Mooney, Brian C. | newspaper=The Boston Globe | date = May 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Determined that a new Massachusetts health insurance measure not raise taxes or resemble the previous decade's failed [[Clinton health care plan of 1993|&quot;Hillarycare&quot;]] proposal at the federal level, Romney formed a team of consultants from diverse political backgrounds to apply those principles.  Beginning in late 2004, they devised a set of proposals that were more ambitious than an incremental one from the [[Massachusetts Senate]] and more acceptable to him than one from the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] that incorporated a new payroll tax.&lt;ref name=&quot;tnr-cohn&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt040606&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bgseries7&quot; /&gt; In particular, Romney pushed for incorporating an [[Health insurance mandate|individual mandate]] at the state level.&lt;ref name=&quot;time-prof-2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1619212,00.html | title=What Romney Believes | author=Tumulty, Karen | magazine=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=May 10, 2007 | authorlink=Karen Tumulty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past rival Ted Kennedy, who had made universal health coverage his life's work and who, over time, had developed a warm relationship with Romney,&lt;ref&gt;Canellos, ''The Last Lion'', p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; gave the plan a positive reception, which encouraged Democratic legislators to cooperate.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt040606&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bgseries7&quot; /&gt; The effort eventually gained the support of all major stakeholders within the state, and Romney helped break a logjam between rival Democratic leaders in the legislature.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt040606&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bgseries7&quot; /&gt;

On April 12, 2006, the governor signed the resulting [[Massachusetts health reform law]], commonly called &quot;Romneycare&quot;, which requires nearly all Massachusetts residents to buy health insurance coverage or face escalating tax penalties, such as the loss of their personal income tax exemption.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-signs&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=F44iAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QKoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1040,6024975 | title=Mass. governor signs health bill, with vetoes | agency=Associated Press | newspaper=[[The Beaufort Gazette]] | date= April 13, 2006 |page=4A |author=LeBlanc, Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill also established [[Means test|means-tested]] state subsidies for people who lacked adequate employer insurance and whose income was below a threshold, using funds that had covered the health costs of the uninsured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/prem/200606u/nj_crook_2006-06-27 |title=The Massachusetts Experiment |last=Crook |first=Clive |magazine=[[The Atlantic]] |date=June 2006 }}&lt;!-- accessdate=2006-11-21 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Dembner, Alice | url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/city_region/breaking_news/2007/01/outline_for_new_1.html | title=Outline for new insurance plan proposed | newspaper=The Boston Globe | date= January 19, 2007 &lt;!-- Retrieved January 19, 2007 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; He vetoed eight sections of the health care legislation, including a controversial $295-per-employee assessment on businesses that do not offer health insurance and provisions guaranteeing dental benefits to Medicaid recipients.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-signs&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-overrides&quot; /&gt; The legislature overrode all eight vetoes, but the governor's office said the differences were not essential.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-overrides&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/east/2006/04/26/67613.htm | title=Mass.
