He founded the [[Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association]] and [[Oral Roberts University]].

As one of the most well-known and controversial American religious leaders of the 20th century, Roberts preached a form of Christianity he called ''seed-faith.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Roberts | first = Oral | title = A Daily Guide Toi Miracles And Successful Living Through Seed-Faith | year = 1975, Rev. 1980 | publisher = Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, Inc. | location = Tulsa, Oklahoma | language = English | pages = 228 – 231}}&lt;/ref&gt; His ministries reached millions of followers worldwide spanning a period of over six decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_obit&quot;/&gt; His [[divine healing|healing]] ministry and bringing American [[Pentecostalism]] into the mainstream had the most impact,&lt;ref name=&quot;CT_obit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2009/decemberweb-only/151-34.0.html?start=1|title=Why the Oral Roberts Obituaries Are Wrong|last=Olsen|first=Ted|publisher=''[[Christianity Today]]''|date=December 16, 2009|accessdate=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he also pioneered TV [[evangelism]] and laid the foundations of the [[prosperity gospel]]&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Oral Roberts, Fiery Preacher, Dies at 91 |first=Keith |last=Schneider |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/12/16/us/16roberts.html |date=December 15, 2009 |accessdate=December 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[abundant life]] teachings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bill Sherman|title=Oral Roberts 1918-2009: A Lasting Influence|quote=God is a good God who wants to bless people spiritually, physically and economically.|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/webextra/content/2008/oralRoberts/specialsection.pdf|publisher=''[[Tulsa World]]''|page=2|date=December 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Roberts was born in [[Pontotoc County, Oklahoma]], the fifth and youngest child of the Reverend Ellis Melvin Roberts and Claudius Priscilla Roberts (née Irwin) (d. 1974).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Oral Roberts's Mother Dies |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60D10F93F58137B93CBA8178FD85F408785F9 |date=1974-04-19 |accessdate=2009-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an interview on ''[[Larry King Live]]'', Irwin was of [[Cherokee]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0201/31/lkl.00.html|title=Interview With Lennox Lewis; Interview With Oral Roberts (transcript)|date=January 31, 2002|work=[[Larry King Live]]|accessdate=December 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roberts was a card-carrying member of the [[Choctaw Nation of Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cherokee Community of Central California|url=http://centralca.cherokee.org/|accessdate=May 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts began life in poverty and nearly died of tuberculosis at age 17.&lt;ref name=&quot;TulsaToday&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.tulsatoday.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1429:oral-roberts-dies&amp;catid=58:local&amp;Itemid=106 |title=Oral Roberts Dies |publisher=''Tulsa Today''|date=December 15, 2009|first=David |last=Arnett |accessdate=December 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing high school, Roberts studied for two years each at [[Oklahoma Baptist University]] and [[Phillips University]].
In 1938 he married a preacher's daughter, Evelyn Lutman Fahnestock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evelyn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Evelyn Lutman Roberts|url=http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?page=gr&amp;GRid=10919187|publisher=[[Find A Grave]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts became a traveling [[faith healer]] after ending his college studies without a degree. According to a ''[[TIME Magazine]]'' profile of 1972, Roberts originally made a name for himself with a large mobile tent &quot;that sat 3,000 on metal folding chairs&quot; where &quot;he shouted at petitioners who did not respond to his healing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time1972&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,905738-1,00.html|title=Religion: Oral's Progress|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date=February 7, 1972|first=|last=|accessdate=2007-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ministry and university==
1947 came as a turning point. Up until that time Roberts had struggled as a part-time preacher in Oklahoma. But at the age of 29 Roberts claims he picked up his Bible and it fell open at the [[Third Epistle of John]] where verse two read: &quot;I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.&quot; Roberts decided immediately that it was all right to be rich. The next day he said he bought a [[Buick]] and God appeared, he said, telling him to heal the sick.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianobit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/dec/15/oral-roberts-obituary|title=Oral Roberts obituary|last=Christopher|first=Reed|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' (UK)|date=December 15, 2009|accessdate=December 21, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts resigned his pastoral ministry with the [[Pentecostal Holiness Church]] to found [[Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association]] (OREA).&lt;ref name=&quot;biography&quot;/&gt; He conducted evangelistic and [[faith healing]] crusades across America and around the world, including claiming he could raise the dead.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Oral Roberts Tells Conference He Has Raised People From the Dead,&quot; ''[[New York Times]]'', Jun 27, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;I've Raised People fromt he Dead, Oral Roberts tells 5,000 in Tulsa,&quot; ''[[The Pittsburgh Press]]'', Jun 26, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of sick people would wait in line to stand before Oral Roberts so he could pray for them. He appeared as a guest speaker for hundreds of national and international meetings and conventions. Through the years, he conducted more than 300 crusades on six continents, and personally laid hands in prayer on more than 2 million people.&lt;ref name=&quot;TulsaToday&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://laist.com/2009/12/15/evangelist_dr_oral_roberts_dies_at.php|title=Evangelist Dr. Oral Roberts Dies at 91 in Newport Beach|last=Behrens|first=Zach|publisher=''[[LAist]]''|date=December 15, 2009|accessdate=December 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pr_121509&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=ORAL ROBERTS DIES: Funeral Arrangements Pending for Legendary Evangelist|url=http://static.ktul.com/documents/oralroberts.pdf|publisher=[[KTUL-TV]]|date=Press release of December 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also ran direct mail campaigns of [[Seed Faith|seed-faith]], which appealed to poor Americans, often from ethnic minorities. At its peak in the early 1980s, Roberts was the leader of a $120 million-a-year organization employing 2,300 people. This spanned not only a university but also a medical school and hospital as well as buildings on {{convert|50|acre|m2}} south of [[Tulsa]] valued at $500 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_obit&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianobit&quot; /&gt; Another part of the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, the [[Abundant Life Prayer Group]] (ALPG), was founded in 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;biography&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Praying Hands at the main entrance to the campus of Oral Roberts University.jpg|thumb|left|The Praying Hands, on the ORU campus in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]]]]

In 1963, he founded [[Oral Roberts University]] (ORU)&lt;ref name=&quot;biography&quot;/&gt; in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], stating he was obeying a command from [[God]]. The university was chartered during 1963 and received its first students in 1965. Students were required to sign an honor code pledging not to [[alcohol|drink]], [[tobacco|smoke]], or engage in premarital sexual activities. The [[Prayer Tower]], opened in 1967, is located at the center of the campus.

Roberts was a pioneer [[televangelism|televangelist]], and attracted a vast viewership. He began broadcasting by radio in 1947,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadcasters Vote Three to Hall of Fame|url=http://oabok.org/documents/HOF_info_for_website.pdf|publisher=Oklahoma Association of Broadcasters|year=2010|accessdate=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HOF&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Chancellor Roberts Elected to Hall of Fame|url=http://www.oru.edu/news/oru_news/20091120_chancellor_roberts_elected.php|publisher=[[Oral Roberts University]]|date=November 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and began broadcasting his revivals by television in 1954.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT_obit&quot; /&gt; His television ministry continued with ''The Abundant Life'' program reaching 80% of the United States by 1957, and quarterly Prime Time Specials from 1969 through 1980. In 1996, he founded [[Golden Eagle Broadcasting]].&lt;ref name=&quot;biography&quot; /&gt;

On 17 March 1968, Roberts and his wife were received as members of the Boston Avenue [[United Methodist Church]] in Tulsa, Oklahoma by Dr. [[Finis Alonzo Crutchfield, Jr.|Finis Crutchfield]], then pastor. The [[United Methodist Church]] offered more leniency in doctrinal and moral issues than the Pentecostalism. This granted Roberts some leeway, as it was expected that the strictness of the Pentecostal tradition may have impeded his rise in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Oral Roberts: An American Life |last= Harrell, Jr. |first= David Edwin |year= 1985 |publisher= Indiana University Press |location= Bloomington, Indiana |isbn= ISBN 0-253-15844-3 |page= 298}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before Roberts' switch to Methodism, Crutchfield arranged a meeting between Roberts and [[William Angie Smith|Bishop William Angie Smith]], at which the Bishop told Roberts, &quot;We need you, but we need the Holy Spirit more than we need you and we've got to have the Holy Spirit in the Methodist Church.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Oral Roberts: An American Life |last= Harrell, Jr. |first= David Edwin |year= 1985 |publisher= Indiana University Press |location= Bloomington, Indiana |isbn= ISBN 0-253-15844-3 |page= 294}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roberts became an [[Elder (Methodism)|elder]] in the Oklahoma Conference of the United Methodist Church. From 1968 through 1987, Roberts was a member of the [[United Methodist Church]]’s ministry.&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph_obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/religion-obituaries/6827907/Oral-Roberts.html |title=Oral Roberts |publisher=''[[Telegraph.co.uk|Telegraph]]'' (UK) |date=December 16, 2009 |accessdate=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Expect a Miracle: My Life and Ministry|location=Nashville, Tennessee|publisher=[[Thomas Nelson Publishers]]|first=Oral|last=Roberts|year=1995|pages=316–329|isbn=978-0-7852-7465-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts had a vast impact on the [[Protestant]] community. According to one authority, in conservative Protestant culture, his ministry had a worldwide impact second only to [[Billy Graham]].&lt;ref name=AP_obit /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral Roberts|url=http://www.infoplease.com/biography/var/oralroberts.html|publisher=[[Infoplease]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Bill|last=Sherman|title=Oral Roberts 1918-2009: A Lasting Influence|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/webextra/content/2008/oralRoberts/specialsection.pdf|publisher=''[[Tulsa World]]''|date=December 20, 2009|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[divine healing]] ministry called for [[prayer]] to heal the [[Abundant life|whole person]] — body, mind and [[soul|spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roberts, Oral|title=If You Need Healing, Do These Things|url=http://search.barnesandnoble.com/If-You-Need-Healing-Do-These-Things/Oral-Roberts/e/9780548384909#Overview|location=Whitefish, MT, USA|publisher=[[Kessinger Publishing]]|ISBN= 978-0-548-38490-9|edition=4th|origyear=1947|year=1969|page=section: A personal word|quote=...minister to the peoples of the world with the goal of seeing them made whole in mind, body and soul.|isbn=0-548-38490-8,}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many labeled him a [[faith healer]], but he rejected this with the comment: &quot;God heals — I don't.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AP_obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/Evangelist-Oral-Roberts-dies-in-Calif-at-age-91-288912.php|title=Evangelist Oral Roberts dies in Calif. at age 91|last=Juozapavicius|first=Justin|publisher=[[Associated Press|The Associated Press]]|date=December 15, 2009|accessdate=May 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CT_obit&quot; /&gt; He played a major role in bringing American [[Pentecostal]] [[Christianity]] into the mainstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.columbiamissourian.com/stories/2009/12/16/evangelist-oral-roberts-leaves-complex-legacy/|title=Evangelist Oral Roberts leaves a complex legacy|last=Gorski|first=Eric|work=[[Columbia Missourian]]|publisher=[[Associated Press|The Associated Press]]|date=December 16, 2009|accessdate=January 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Roberts was often associated with the [[prosperity gospel]] and the [[faith movement]] because of his close doctrinal and personal ties with [[Word-Faith]] teachers, his [[abundant life]] teachings did not fully identify him with that movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Reid|first=Daniel G.|last2=Linder|first2=Robert Dean|last3=Shelley|first3=Bruce L.|last4=Stout|first4=Harry S.|year=1990|title=Dictionary of Christianity in America|location=Westmont, Illinois|publisher=[[InterVarsity Press]]|isbn=978-0-8308-1776-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, it was among the largest health facilities of its kind in the world and was intended to merge prayer and medicine in the healing process. The City of Faith operated for only eight years before closing in late 1989, but the importance of treating the [[Holistic health|whole person]] – spirit, mind, and body – was conveyed to many medical professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oral Roberts Dies|url=http://www.alrcnewskitchen.com/eblast/others/091215_orea.pdf|publisher=A.

Roberts' fundraising was controversial. In January 1987, during a fundraising drive, Roberts announced to a television audience that unless he raised $8 million by that March, God would &quot;call him home.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Randi|first=James|authorlink1=James Randi|year=1989|title=[[The Faith Healers]]| publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|isbn=0-87975-535-0|page=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time1987&quot; /&gt; Some were fearful that he was referring to suicide, given the impassioned pleas and tears that accompanied his statement. He raised $9.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral Roberts|url=http://www.ondoctrine.com/10robero.htm|first=Gary A.|last=Hand|publisher=On Doctrine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, he announced that God had raised the dead through Roberts' ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Randi|first=James|authorlink1=James Randi|year=1989|title=[[The Faith Healers]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Books]]|isbn=0-87975-535-0|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Roberts' fundraising letters were written by [[Gene Ewing]], who headed a business writing donation letters for other evangelicals such as [[Don Stewart (preacher)|Don Stewart]] and [[Robert Tilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/DM/lib00376,0ED3D68534F95845.html|title=Direct-market evangelist brings in millions lawyer says it all goes|publisher=''[[The Dallas Morning News]]''|date=March 10, 1996|accessdate =2007-05-17 | first=Howard | last=Swindle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roberts maintained his love of finery and one obituary claimed that even when times become hard, &quot;he continued to wear his Italian silk suits, diamond rings and gold bracelets – airbrushed out by his staff on publicity pictures&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianobit&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph_obit&quot; /&gt;

He stirred up controversy when ''Time'' reported in 1987 that his son [[Richard Roberts (evangelist)|Richard Roberts]] claimed that he had seen his father raise a child from the dead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time1987&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,964970,00.html|title=Raising Eyebrows and the Dead|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date=July 13, 1987|first=Richard|last=Ostling|accessdate =2007-01-04|authorlink=Richard Ostling}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, the ''[[Bloom County]]'' comic strip recast its character [[Bill the Cat]] as a satirized televangelist, &quot;Fundamentally Oral Bill.&quot; In 1987 ''Time'' stated that he was &quot;re-emphasizing faith healing and [is] reaching for his old-time constituency.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time1987&quot;/&gt; However, his income continued to decrease (from $88 million in 1980 to $55 million in 1986, according to the ''[[Tulsa Tribune]]'') and his largely vacant City of Faith Medical Center continued to lose money.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time1987&quot;/&gt;

Harry McNevin said that in 1988 the ORU Board of Regents &quot;rubber-stamped&quot; the &quot;use of millions in endowment money to buy a Beverly Hills property so that Oral Roberts could have a West Coast office and house&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Juozapavicius|first=Justin|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/08/AR2007110801341_pf.html|title=Oral Roberts' Son Accused of Misspending|work=[[The Washington Post]]|publisher=[[Associated Press|The Associated Press]]|date=November 8, 2007|accessdate=December 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, he said a country club membership was purchased for the Roberts' home. The lavish expenses led to McNevin's resignation from the Board. In 1988, Oral Roberts and his son Richard were sued for $15 million dollars in federal court by patients at City of Faith Medical Center, claiming the two were frauds who did not visit or heal patients in the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= | title=Roberts Disputes Allegations In Suit | publisher=[[Bryan Times]] |date=Aug 4, 1988  | first= | last= | accessdate = 2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= | title=Faith Healer Fails To Win Delay | publisher=[[Saturday Morning Deseret News]] |date=Jul 31, 1988  | first= | last= | accessdate = 2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= | title=Oral Roberts Sued For Failing To Cure Woman Of Hernia | publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=Oct 17, 1987  | first= | last= | accessdate = 2012-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His organizations were also affected by scandals involving other [[televangelists]]&lt;ref name=&quot;AP_obit&quot;/&gt; and the City of Faith hospital was forced to close in 1989 after losing money.

According to a 1987 article in the ''[[New York Review of Books]]'' by [[Martin Gardner]], the &quot;most accurate and best documented [[biography]] is ''Oral Roberts: An American Life'', an objective study by [[David Edwin Harrell Jr.]], a historian at [[Auburn University]]. Two out-of-print books take a more critical stance: James Morris' ''The Preachers'' ([[St. Martin's Press]], 1973) and Jerry Sholes' ''Give Me That Prime-Time Religion'' (Hawthorn, 1979).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/article-preview?article_id=4689|title=Giving God a Hand|publisher=''[[New York Review of Books]]''|date=August 13, 1987|first=Martin|last=Gardner|accessdate=2007-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
