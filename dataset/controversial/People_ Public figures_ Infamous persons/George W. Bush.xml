'''George Walker Bush''' (born July 6, 1946) is an American politician and businessman who was the [[List of Presidents of the United States|43rd]] [[President of the United States]] from 2001 to 2009&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/86112/George-W-Bush George W. Bush (president of United States) - Encyclopedia Britannica] retrieved November 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[List of Governors of Texas|46th Governor]] of [[Texas]] from 1995 to 2000. The eldest son of [[Barbara Bush|Barbara]] and [[George H. W. Bush]], he was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]]. After graduating from [[Yale University]] in 1968 and [[Harvard Business School]] in 1975, Bush worked in oil businesses. He married [[Laura Bush|Laura Welch]] in 1977 and ran unsuccessfully for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] shortly thereafter. He later co-owned the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] baseball team before defeating [[Ann Richards]] in the [[Texas gubernatorial election, 1994|1994 Texas gubernatorial election]]. Bush was elected president in 2000 after a [[United States presidential election, 2000|close and controversial election]], becoming the fourth president to be elected while receiving fewer popular votes nationwide than his opponent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ushistory.org|url=http://www.ushistory.org/gov/7c.asp|title=Selection and Succession of the President|publisher=Ushistory.org|accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush is the second president to have been the son of a former president, the first being [[John Quincy Adams]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanpresidents.org/presidents/president.asp?PresidentNumber=6|title=Life Portraits|publisher=American Presidents|accessdate=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also the brother of [[Jeb Bush]], former [[Governor of Florida]].

Eight months into Bush's first term as president, the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]] terrorist attacks occurred. In response, Bush [[Bush Doctrine|announced]] the [[War on Terror]], an international military campaign which included the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|war in Afghanistan]] launched in 2001 and the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]] launched in 2003. In addition to national security issues, Bush also promoted policies on the economy, health care, education, and social security reform. He signed into law [[Bush tax cuts|broad tax cuts]], the [[USA PATRIOT Act|PATRIOT Act]], the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], the [[Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act]], and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] prescription drug benefits for seniors. His tenure saw national debates on [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]], [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], [[NSA electronic surveillance program|electronic surveillance]], and [[enhanced interrogation techniques]]. He announced the U.S. would not implement the [[Kyoto Protocol]] on [[global warming]], which had been signed by the previous administration but never ratified by the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McCarthy|first=Michael|title=Bush declares he won't sign Kyoto's landmark treaty on global warming|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/bush-declares-he-wont-sign-kyotos-landmark-treaty-on-global-warming-689360.html|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=March 29, 2001|location=London|date=March 29, 2001|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110515200903/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/bush-declares-he-wont-sign-kyotos-landmark-treaty-on-global-warming-689360.html|archivedate=May 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush successfully ran for re-election against Democratic Senator [[John Kerry]] in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]], in another relatively close election. After his re-election, Bush received increasingly heated [[Public image of George W. Bush|criticism]] from across the [[political spectrum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12643666/|title=Republican right abandoning Bush|publisher=MSNBC|date=May 5, 2006|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,184608,00.html|title=Illegal Immigration, Unchecked Spending Siphon Conservatives From GOP Base|publisher=Fox News|author=Kelley Beaucar Vlahos|date=February 13, 2006|accessdate=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baker&quot;&gt;Baker, Kevin, [http://www.americanheritage.com/content/second-term-blues &quot;Second-Term Blues: Why Have Our Presidents Almost Always Stumbled after Their First Four Years?&quot;], ''American Heritage'', Aug./Sept. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; for his handling of the Iraq War, [[Hurricane Katrina]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/425822/609550|title=Katrinagate fury spreads to US media|publisher=TVNZ|date=September 7, 2005|accessdate=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mike M.

As a result, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] won control of Congress in the [[United States elections, 2006|2006 elections]]. In December 2007, the United States entered its longest post–[[World War II]] [[Late-2000s recession|recession]], prompting the Bush Administration to enact multiple economic programs intended to preserve the country's financial system. Nationally, Bush was both one of the most popular and unpopular presidents in history, having received the highest recorded presidential approval ratings in the wake of 9/11, as well as one of the lowest approval ratings during the [[2008 financial crisis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gallup&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/106426/Bush-Job-Approval-28-Lowest-Administration.aspx|title=Bush Job Approval at 28%, Lowest of His Administration|accessdate=January 20, 2009|date=April 11, 2008|publisher=Gallup Poll}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, he was a highly controversial figure, with public protests occurring even during visits to close allies, such as the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Protesters greet Bush's UK visit|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/7455206.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=Sunday, June 15, 2008|date=June 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush left office in 2009, and was succeeded as president by [[Barack Obama]], who ran on a platform of change from Bush's policies. Since leaving office, Bush has returned to Texas and purchased a home in a suburban area of [[Dallas]]. He is currently a public speaker and has written a book about his life entitled ''[[Decision Points]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2010-10-07-bush-memoir_N.htm|title=George W.

In 1978, Bush ran for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] from [[Texas's 19th congressional district]].

[[File:George W. Bush in Concord, New Hampshire signing papers for presidential run.jpg|thumb|Bush in Concord, New Hampshire signing to be a candidate for president]]

====Primary====
In June 1999, while Governor of Texas, Bush announced his candidacy for President of the United States. With no incumbent running, Bush entered a large field of candidates for the Republican Party presidential nomination consisting of [[John McCain]], [[Alan Keyes]], [[Steve Forbes]], [[Gary Bauer]], [[Orrin Hatch]], [[Elizabeth Dole]], [[Dan Quayle]], [[Pat Buchanan]], [[Lamar Alexander]], [[John Kasich]], and [[Robert C. Smith]].

Bush portrayed himself as a [[compassionate conservatism|compassionate conservative]], implying he was more centrist than other Republicans. He campaigned on a platform that included increasing the size of the [[United States Armed Forces]], cutting taxes, improving education, and aiding minorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;msn&quot;/&gt; By early 2000, the race had centered on Bush and McCain.&lt;ref name=&quot;msn&quot;/&gt;

Bush won the [[Iowa caucuses]], but, although he was heavily favored to win the [[New Hampshire primary]], he trailed McCain by 19% and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum and, according to political observers, effectively became the front runner after the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2000|South Carolina primary]], which according to ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' made history for his campaign's negativity; ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it as a [[smear campaign]].&lt;ref name=&quot;anatomy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Davis|first=Richard H.|url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2004/03/21/the_anatomy_of_a_smear_campaign/|title=The anatomy of a smear campaign|work=The Boston Globe|date=March 21, 2004|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hook|first=Janet|coauthor=Michael Finnegan|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/mar/17/nation/na-mccain17|title=McCain loses some of his rebel edge|work=Los Angeles Times|date=March 17, 2007|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Steinhauer|first=Jennifer|url=http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/19/us/politics/19mccain.html&amp;OQ=_rQ3D1&amp;OP=6078ead7Q2FQ7CF0)Q7C@Q25Q2ADiQ25Q25Q3EHQ7CHXX.Q7CRXQ7CRrQ7CQ2BDQ7CQ7DQ25Q3CBQ3EBQ2ADQ7CRrkQ2AQ2AQ3FBQ2FQ22_Q3EkQ3C|format=Registration required|title=Confronting Ghosts of 2000 in South Carolina|work=The New York Times|date=October 19, 2007|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2000, Bush surprised some observers by asking [[Dick Cheney]], a former [[White House Chief of Staff]], [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]], and [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]], to be his [[running mate]]. Cheney was then serving as head of Bush's Vice-Presidential search committee. Soon after, Cheney was officially nominated by the Republican Party at the [[2000 Republican National Convention]].

Bush continued to campaign across the country and touted his record as Governor of Texas.&lt;ref name=&quot;msn&quot;/&gt; Bush's campaign criticized his Democratic opponent, incumbent Vice President [[Al Gore]], over [[gun politics|gun control]] and taxation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sack, Kevin and Toner, Robin|date=August 13, 2000|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/13/us/2000-campaign-record-congress-gore-selected-issues-ready-for-prime-time.html|title=The 2000 Campaign: The Record; In Congress, Gore Selected Issues Ready for Prime Time|work=The New York Times|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the election returns came in on November 7, Bush won 29 states, including Florida. The closeness of the Florida outcome led to a [[United States presidential election in Florida, 2000|recount]].&lt;ref name=&quot;msn&quot;/&gt; The initial recount also went to Bush, but the outcome was tied up in courts for a month until reaching the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/00-949.ZPC.html George W.

In 2004, Bush commanded broad support in the Republican Party and did not encounter a primary challenge. He appointed [[Ken Mehlman]] as campaign manager, with a political strategy devised by [[Karl Rove]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/politics/july-dec04/rove_9-01.html|title=An Interview With Karl Rove|accessdate=September 1, 2008|date=August 1, 2004|work=NewsHour with Jim Lehrer|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush and the Republican platform included a strong commitment to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,&lt;ref name=&quot;platform04&quot;/&gt; support for the [[USA PATRIOT Act]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Archive/2004_GOP_Platform_Civil_Rights.htm|title=2004 Republican Party Platform: on Civil Rights|accessdate=August 20, 2008|publisher=OnTheIssues.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; a renewed shift in policy for constitutional amendments banning abortion and [[same-sex marriage]],&lt;ref name=&quot;platform04&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;After initial comments made in March, there was no statement on the latter issue until June. {{cite news|last=Rosenberg|first=Debra|title=A Gay-Marriage Wedge|work=Newsweek|volume=143|issue=26|date=June 28, 2004|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; reforming [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] to create private investment accounts,&lt;ref name=&quot;platform04&quot;/&gt; creation of an [[ownership society]],&lt;ref name=&quot;platform04&quot;/&gt; and opposing mandatory carbon emissions controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=OntheIssues.org|title=2004 Republican Party Platform: on Energy &amp; Oil|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Archive/2004_GOP_Platform_Energy_+_Oil.htm|accessdate=August 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush also called for the implementation of a [[guest worker program]] for immigrants,&lt;ref name=&quot;platform04&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/25/us/2004-campaign-republican-agenda-draft-gop-platform-backs-bush-security-gay.html|title=The 2004 Campaign: The Republican Agenda; Draft GOP Platform Backs Bush on Security, Gay Marriage, and Immigration|accessdate=June 23, 2009|date=August 25, 2004|work=The New York Times|author=Kirkpatrick, David D}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was criticized by conservatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=The New York Times|accessdate=June 23, 2009|date=August 26, 2004|author=Kirkpatrick, David D|title=The 2004 Campaign: The Platform; Conservatives Mount Stem Cell and Immigration Challenges|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/26/us/2004-campaign-platform-conservatives-mount-stem-cell-immigration-challenges.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bush campaign advertised across the U.S. against Democratic candidates, including Bush's emerging opponent, Massachusetts Senator [[John Kerry]]. Kerry and other Democrats attacked Bush on the [[Iraq War]], and accused him of failing to stimulate the economy and job growth. The Bush campaign portrayed Kerry as a staunch [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] who would raise taxes and increase the size of government. The Bush campaign continuously criticized Kerry's seemingly contradictory statements on the war in Iraq,&lt;ref name=&quot;msn&quot;/&gt; and argued that Kerry lacked the decisiveness and vision necessary for success in the War on Terror.

In the election, Bush carried 31 of 50 states, receiving a total of 286 [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]]. He won an outright majority of the popular vote (50.7% to his opponent's 48.3%).&lt;ref name=&quot;16 years&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/nov/04/uselections2004.usa16|title=And now... four more years|accessdate=September 1, 2008|date=November 4, 2004|work=The Guardian|location=London|first=Julian|last=Borger}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous President to win an outright majority of the popular vote was Bush's father in the 1988 election. Additionally, it was the first time since [[Herbert Hoover]]'s [[United States presidential election, 1928|election in 1928]] that a Republican president was elected alongside re-elected Republican majorities in both Houses of Congress. Bush's 2.5% margin of victory was the narrowest ever for a victorious incumbent President, breaking [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s 3.1% margin of victory against [[Charles Evans Hughes]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1916|election of 1916]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Turow|first=Scott|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A26059-2004Dec25.html|title=A Dominant GOP?

====Economic policy====
{{Main|Economic policy of the George W. Bush administration}}

Bush took office during a period of economic recession in the wake of the bursting of the [[Dot-com bubble]].&lt;ref&gt;Origins of the Crash: The Great Bubble and Its Undoing, Roger Lowenstein, Penguin Books, 2004, ISBN 1-59420-003-3, ISBN 978-1-59420-003-8 page 114-115&lt;/ref&gt; The terrorist attacks also impacted the economy. The Bush administration increased federal [[government spending]] from $1.789 trillion to $2.983 trillion (60%) while revenues increased from $2.025 trillion to $2.524 trillion (from 2000 to 2008). Individual income tax revenues increased by 14%, corporate tax revenues by 50%, customs and duties by 40%. Discretionary defense spending was increased by 107%, discretionary domestic spending by 62%, Medicare spending by 131%, social security by 51%, and income security spending by 130%. Cyclically adjusted, revenues rose by 35% and spending by 65%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/108xx/doc10871/appendixf.shtml Historical Budget Data], Congressional Budget Office, Tables F-1, F-3, F-7, F-9, and F-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush undertook a number of educational priorities, such as increasing the funding for the [[National Science Foundation]] and [[National Institutes of Health]] in his first years of office, and creating education programs to strengthen the grounding in science and mathematics for American high school students. Funding for the NIH was cut in 2006, the first such cut in 36 years, due to rising inflation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Committee on Appropriations]]&amp;nbsp;—Democratic Staff|title=President Bush and House Republicans Undermine Life Saving Health Research|publisher=United States House of Representatives|date=September 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the administration's early major initiatives was the [[No Child Left Behind Act]], which aimed to measure and close the gap between rich and poor student performance, provide options to parents with students in low-performing schools, and target more federal funding to low-income schools.

After being re-elected, Bush signed into law a [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] drug benefit program that, according to [[Jan Crawford Greenburg]], resulted in &quot;the greatest expansion in America's [[welfare state]] in forty years;&quot; the bill's costs approached $7&amp;nbsp;trillion.&lt;ref&gt;Greenburg, Jan Crawford, Supreme Conflict: The Inside Story of the Struggle for Control of the United States Supreme Court, 2007, Penguin Books, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Bush opposed and vetoed [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP) legislation, which was added by the Democrats onto a war funding bill and passed by Congress. The SCHIP legislation would have significantly expanded federally funded health care benefits and plans to children of some low-income families from about six&amp;nbsp;million to ten&amp;nbsp;million children. It was to be funded by an increase in the cigarette tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael Abramowitz and Jonathan Weisman|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/10/03/AR2007100300116_pf.html|title=Bush Vetoes Health Measure|work=The Washington Post|date=October 4, 2007|accessdate=October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush viewed the legislation as a move toward [[socialized health care]], and asserted that the program could benefit families making as much as $83,000 per year who did not need the help.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/04/washington/04bush.html|title=Bush Vetoes Child Health Bill Privately|work=The New York Times|date=October 4, 2007|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social services and Social Security====
Following Republican efforts to pass the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare Act of 2003]], Bush signed the bill, which included major changes to the [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] program by providing beneficiaries with some assistance in paying for prescription drugs, while relying on private insurance for the delivery of benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nls.org/conf2004/summary-medicare-act-2003.htm|title=Summary of Medicare Act of 2003|accessdate=August 20, 2008|publisher=Center for Medicare Advocacy, Inc.|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The retired persons lobby group [[AARP]] worked with the Bush Administration on the program and gave their endorsement. Bush said the law, estimated to cost $400&amp;nbsp;billion over the first ten years, would give the elderly &quot;better choices and more control over their health care&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/12/20031208-2.html|title=President Signs Medicare Legislation|publisher=The White House|date=December 8, 2003|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George W. Bush speaks at Coast Guard commencement.jpg|thumb|left|Bush speaks at the [[United States Coast Guard Academy]] commencement, May 2007.]]

Bush began his second term by outlining a major initiative to reform Social Security,&lt;ref name=&quot;ss-msnbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6903273/|title=Bush pushes his Social Security overhaul|accessdate=August 20, 2008|publisher=MSNBC|date=February 16, 2005|author=Wolk, Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was facing record deficit projections beginning in 2005. Bush made it the centerpiece of his domestic agenda despite opposition from some in the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref name=&quot;ss-msnbc&quot;/&gt; In his [[2005 State of the Union Address]], Bush discussed the potential impending bankruptcy of the program and outlined his new program, which included partial privatization of the system, personal Social Security accounts, and options to permit Americans to divert a portion of their Social Security tax ([[Federal Insurance Contributions Act tax|FICA]]) into secured investments.&lt;ref name=&quot;ss-msnbc&quot;/&gt; Democrats opposed the proposal to partially privatize the system.&lt;ref name=&quot;ss-msnbc&quot;/&gt;

Bush embarked on a 60-day national tour, campaigning vigorously for his initiative in media events, known as the &quot;Conversations on Social Security&quot;, in an attempt to gain support from the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A28120-2005Mar11.html|title=Social Security: On With the Show|accessdate=September 1, 2008|author=Jim VandeHei and Peter Baker|date=February 12, 2005|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the energetic campaign, public support for the proposal declined&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/f944a850-b830-11d9-bc7c-00000e2511c8,_i_rssPage=80fdaff6-cbe5-11d7-81c6-0820abe49a01.html|title=Bush shifts approach on Social Security reform|accessdate=September 9, 2007|date=April 28, 2005|work=The Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the House Republican leadership decided not to put Social Security reform on the priority list for the remainder of their 2005 legislative agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/060105/social.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051205090810/http://thehill.com/thehill/export/TheHill/News/Frontpage/060105/social.html|archivedate=December 5, 2005|title=Social Security in Limbo|work=The Hill|date=June 1, 2005|author=Patrick O'Connor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal's legislative prospects were further diminished by the political fallout from the [[Hurricane Katrina]] in the fall of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hurricane dims Bush's hopes on Social Security|date=September 22, 2005|last=Yeager|first=Holly|url=http://news.ft.com/cms/s/00d6ee20-2b9f-11da-995a-00000e2511c8.html|accessdate=September 9, 2007|work=The Financial Times|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080519161736/http%3A//news.ft.com/cms/s/00d6ee20-2b9f-11da-995a-00000e2511c8.html|archivedate=May 19, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Democrats gained control of both houses of the Congress as a result of the [[United States Senate elections, 2006|2006 midterm elections]], the prospects of any further congressional action on the Bush proposal were dead for the remainder of his term in office.

====Environmental policies====
{{Main|Domestic policy of the George W. Bush administration#Environment}}
Upon taking office in 2001, Bush stated his opposition to the [[Kyoto Protocol]], an amendment to the UN Convention on Climate Change which seeks to impose mandatory targets for reducing [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, citing that the treaty exempted 80% of the world's population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/03/20010314.html|title=Letter from the President to Senators Hagel, Helms, Craig, and Roberts|publisher=Office of the Press Secretary|date=March 13, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and would have cost tens of billions of dollars per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/oiaf/kyoto/economic.htm|title=Summary of the Kyoto Report—Assessment of Economic Impacts|publisher=Energy Information Administration|date=July 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also cited that the Senate had voted 95–0 in 1997 on a resolution expressing its disapproval of the protocol.
[[File:20080618 Bush Kempthorne oil exploration speech.jpg|thumb|Bush delivers a statement on energy, urging Congress to end [[Offshore oil and gas in the United States|offshore oil drill]] ban, June 18, 2008.]]
In May 2001, Bush signed an [[executive order]] to create an inter-agency task force to streamline energy projects,&lt;ref name=&quot;eo13212&quot;&gt;Bush, George W.

In 2002, Bush announced the [[Clear Skies Act of 2003]],&lt;ref name=&quot;EXsummary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/02/clearskies.html|title=Executive Summary—The Clear Skies Initiative|publisher=The White House|date=February 14, 2002|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; aimed at amending the [[Clean Air Act (United States)|Clean Air Act]] to reduce air pollution through the use of [[emissions trading]] programs. Many experts argued that this legislation would have weakened the original legislation by allowing higher emission rates of pollutants than were previously legal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sierraclub.org/cleanair/clear_skies.asp|publisher=The [[Sierra Club]]|title=Clear Skies Proposal Weakens the Clean Air Act|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative was introduced to Congress, but failed to make it out of committee.

Bush has said that he believes that [[global warming]] is real&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with President Bush|work=White House Transcript|publisher=Politico|date=May 13, 2008|accessdate=May 14, 2008|quote=Q.

Part 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Energy policies====
In his [[2006 State of the Union Address]], Bush declared, &quot;America is addicted to oil&quot; and announced his Advanced Energy Initiative to increase [[energy development]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://legacy.c-span.org/Transcripts/SOTU-2006.aspx|title=PRESIDENT GEORGE W.

That same year, Bush declared the [[Northwestern Hawaiian Islands]] a national monument, creating the largest [[marine reserve]] to date. The [[Papahānaumokuākea Marine National Monument]] comprises 84&amp;nbsp;million acres (340,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and is home to 7,000 species of fish, birds, and other marine animals, many of which are specific to only those islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13300363/|title=Bush creates world’s biggest ocean preserve|publisher=MSNBC|date=June 16, 2006|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was hailed by conservationists for &quot;its foresight and leadership in protecting this incredible area&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.org/initiatives/marine/press/press2489.html|title=The Nature Conservancy Applauds President Bush for Creating World’s Largest Marine Conservation Area in Hawaii|publisher=[[The Nature Conservancy]]|date=June 16, 2006|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[2007 State of the Union Address]], Bush renewed his pledge to work toward diminished reliance on foreign oil by reducing [[fossil fuel]] consumption and increasing [[alternative fuel]] production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070123-2.html|title=President Bush Delivers State of the Union Address|publisher=The White House|date=January 23, 2007|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amid high gasoline prices in 2008, Bush lifted a ban on [[offshore drilling]].&lt;ref name=&quot;drilling-cnn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/07/14/bush.offshore/|title=Bush lifts executive ban on offshore oil drilling|accessdate=August 3, 2008|publisher=CNN|date=July 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the move was largely symbolic as there is still a federal law banning offshore drilling. Bush said, &quot;This means that the only thing standing between the American people and these vast oil reserves is action from the U.S. Congress.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;drilling-cnn&quot;/&gt; Bush had said in June 2008, &quot;In the long run, the solution is to reduce demand for oil by promoting alternative energy technologies. My administration has worked with Congress to invest in gas-saving technologies like advanced batteries and hydrogen [[fuel cell]]s.... In the short run, the American economy will continue to rely largely on oil. And that means we need to increase supply, especially here at home. So my administration has repeatedly called on Congress to expand domestic oil production.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2008/06/20080618.html|title=President Bush Discusses Energy|date=June 18, 2008|accessdate=August 3, 2008|publisher=The White House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[2008 State of the Union Address]], Bush announced that the U.S. would commit $2&amp;nbsp;billion over the next three years to a new international fund to promote clean energy technologies and fight climate change, saying, &quot;Along with contributions from other countries, this fund will increase and accelerate the deployment of all forms of cleaner, more efficient technologies in developing nations like India and China, and help leverage substantial private-sector capital by making clean energy projects more financially attractive.&quot; He also announced plans to reaffirm the United States' commitment to work with major economies, and, through the UN, to complete an international agreement that will slow, stop, and eventually reverse the growth of greenhouse gases; he stated, &quot;This agreement will be effective only if it includes commitments by every major economy and gives none a free ride.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/stateoftheunion2008.htm|title=George W.

====Stem cell research and first use of veto power====
Federal funding for medical research involving the creation or destruction of human embryos through the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] and the [[National Institutes of Health]] has been forbidden by law since the passage in 1995 of the [[Dickey-Wicker Amendment]] by Congress and the signature of President [[Bill Clinton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaas.org/spp/cstc/briefs/stemcells/index.shtml|title=AAAS Policy Brief: Stem Cell Research|accessdate=September 1, 2008|publisher=[[American Association for the Advancement of Science]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush has said that he supports adult [[stem cell]] research and has supported federal legislation that finances adult stem cell research. However, Bush did not support [[embryonic stem cell]] research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/08/20010809-2.html|title=President Discusses Stem Cell Research|publisher=Office of the President}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 9, 2001, Bush signed an executive order lifting the ban on federal funding for the 71 existing &quot;lines&quot; of stem cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stemcells.nih.gov/policy/NIHFedPolicy.asp|title=NIH's Role in Federal Policy Stem Cell Research|publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]]|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ability of these existing lines to provide an adequate medium for testing has been questioned.

====Immigration====
[[File:Bush delivers statement at Mexican border.jpg|thumb|Bush discusses border security with Homeland Security Director [[Michael Chertoff]] near [[El Paso, Texas|El Paso]], November 2005.]]
In 2006, Bush urged Congress to allow more than 12&amp;nbsp;million [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]] to work in the United States with the creation of a &quot;temporary guest-worker program&quot;.

[[Hurricane Katrina]], which was one of the worst disasters in U.S. history, struck early in Bush’s second term.

Although Congressional investigations focused on whether the Justice Department and the White House were using the U.S. Attorney positions for political advantage, no official findings have been released. On March 10, 2008, the Congress filed a federal lawsuit to enforce their issued subpoenas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/paperchase/2008/03/house-judiciary-panel-files-civil.php|title=House judiciary panel files civil lawsuit to enforce Miers, Bolten subpoenas|accessdate=May 30, 2008|date=March 10, 2008|author=Porter, Patrick|publisher=Jurist Legal News and Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 31, 2008, a [[United States district court]] judge ruled that Bush's top advisers were not immune from Congressional subpoenas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Apuzzo|first=Matt|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/topstories/2008-07-31-2444639400_x.htm|title=Federal judge rules Bush's aides can be subpoenaed|work=USA Today|date=July 31, 2008|accessdate=April 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his Presidential campaign, Bush's [[Foreign policy of the United States|foreign policy]] platform included support for stronger economic and political relationship with Latin Americas, especially Mexico, and a reduction of involvement in &quot;[[nation-building]]&quot; and other small-scale military engagements. The administration pursued a [[national missile defense]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fas.org/nuke/control/abmt/news/010501bush.html|title=President Bush Speech on Missile Defense|publisher=[[Federation of American Scientists]]|date=May 1, 2001|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush was an advocate of China's entry into the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://edition.cnn.com/2001/WORLD/asiapcf/east/04/05/china.WTO/ Bush backs China's WTO entry despite standoff]&quot;, CNN.com, April 6, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; He said [[free trade]] was a force for democratization in China.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1358596.stm Bush woos China on trade]&quot;, May 30, 2001, BBC News&lt;/ref&gt; 

In his 2002 State of the Union Address, Bush referred to an [[axis of evil]] including [[Iraq]], [[Iran]] and [[North Korea]].&lt;ref name=suterror&gt;{{cite web|author=P.O.

In 2003, Bush then launched the [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]], searching for Weapons of Mass Destruction, which he described as being part of the War on Terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/11/30/bush.excerpts/index.html|title=Key points from Bush speech|publisher=CNN|date=November 30, 2005|accessdate=January 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those invasions led to the toppling of the [[Taliban]] regime in Afghanistan and the removal of [[Saddam Hussein]] from power in Iraq. Since the 2003 invasion more than [[Casualties of the Iraq War|one hundred thousand]] have died in Iraq.

Bush began his second term with an emphasis on improving strained relations with European nations. He appointed long-time adviser [[Karen Hughes]] to oversee a global public relations campaign. Bush lauded the pro-democracy struggles in Georgia and Ukraine.

In March 2006, a visit to India led to renewed ties between the two countries, reversing decades of U.S. policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-03-02-nuclear-pact_x.htm|title=Nuclear deal announced as Bush visits India|work=USA Today|date=March 2, 2006|accessdate=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visit focused particularly on areas of [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] and counter-terrorism cooperation, discussions that would lead eventually to the [[U.S.-India Civil Nuclear Agreement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/03/20060302-5.html|title=U.S.-India Joint Statement|date=March 2, 2006|publisher=The White House|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amritt.com/George-W-Bush.html|title=George W.

This is in stark contrast to the stance taken by his predecessor, Clinton, whose approach and response to India after the 1998 nuclear tests was that of sanctions and hectoring.

Midway through Bush's second term, it was questioned whether Bush was retreating from his freedom and democracy agenda, highlighted in policy changes toward some oil-rich former Soviet republics in central Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/23/AR2006042301017.html|title=Retreat From the Freedom Agenda|accessdate=September 1, 2008|last=Diehl|first=Jackson|date=April 24, 2005|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an address before both Houses of Congress on September 20, 2001, Bush thanked the nations of the world for their support following the September 11 attacks. He specifically thanked British Prime Minister Tony Blair for traveling to the Washington to show &quot;unity of purpose with America&quot;, and said &quot;America has no truer friend than Great Britain.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html|title=Address to a Joint Session of Congress and the American People|author=Bush, George W. |publisher=[[The White House]]|date=September 20, 2001|accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also emphasized the need for the nation to come together and comfort the families of the victims.

[[File:GW Bush and Hamid Karzai in Kabul 2006-03-01.jpg|thumb|left|Bush and President [[Hamid Karzai]] of Afghanistan appear together in 2006 at a joint news conference in [[Kabul]].]]
On October 7, 2001, U.S. and British forces initiated bombing campaigns that led to the arrival of [[Northern Alliance]] troops in [[Kabul]] on November 13. The main goals of the war were to defeat the [[Taliban]], drive [[al-Qaeda]] out of Afghanistan, and capture key al-Qaeda leaders. In December 2001, the Pentagon reported that the Taliban had been defeated,&lt;ref name=&quot;taliband&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/11/world/nation-challenged-military-campaign-taliban-defeated-pentagon-asserts-but-war.html|accessdate=June 23, 2009|date=December 11, 2001|author=Shanker, Tom and Eric Schmitt|work=The New York Times|title=A Nation Challenged; Military Campaign; Taliban Defeated, Pentagon Asserts, but War Goes On}}&lt;/ref&gt; but cautioned that the war would go on to continue weakening Taliban and al-Qaeda leaders.&lt;ref name=&quot;taliband&quot;/&gt; Later that month the UN had installed the [[Afghan Transitional Administration]] chaired by [[Hamid Karzai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/isaf.cfm|title=Fact Sheet: International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) in Afghanistan|publisher=[[Center for Defense Information]]|date=February 14, 2002|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4673026.stm|title=More Dutch troops for Afghanistan|publisher=BBC News|date=February 3, 2006|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to kill or capture al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden failed as he escaped a battle in December 2001 in the mountainous region of [[Tora Bora]], which the Bush Administration later acknowledged to have resulted from a failure to commit enough U.S. ground troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A62618-2002Apr16|title=U.S. Concludes bin Laden Escaped at Tora Bora Fight|accessdate=September 1, 2008|date=April 17, 2002|work=The Washington Post|first1=Barton|last1=Gellman|first2=Thomas E.|last2=Ricks}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 13, 2002, Bush stated that &quot;I truly am not that concerned about him&quot; when asked about bin Laden, brushing him off as &quot;a person who has now been marginalized&quot;, despite declaring that he was wanted &quot;Dead or Alive&quot; shortly after [[September 11th terrorist attacks|9/11]], and statements from U.S. commanders that bin Laden was &quot;still a threat in the new Afghanistan&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cursor.org/stories/binladenforgotten.htm|title=Has bin Laden bin forgotten?|publisher=Cursor.org|accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until May 2011, two years after Bush left office, that bin Laden was killed by U.S. forces. Bin Laden's successor, [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], as well as the leader of the Taliban, [[Mohammed Omar]], remain at large.

Despite the initial success in driving the Taliban from power in Kabul, by early 2003 the Taliban was regrouping, amassing new funds and recruits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0508/p01s02-wosc.html?related|title=Taliban Appears To Be Regrouped and Well-Funded|accessdate=September 1, 2008|date=May 8, 2003|work=Christian Science Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the [[Taliban insurgency]] appeared larger, fiercer and better organized than expected, with large-scale allied offensives such as [[Operation Mountain Thrust]] attaining limited success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/NewsArticle.aspx?ID=285|title=World Cannot Give Up on Afghanistan, Coalition Officials Say|accessdate=September 1, 2008|date=June 28, 2006|publisher=[[United States Department of Defense]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/5107816.stm|title=Frustrated Karzai toughens stance|accessdate=September 1, 2008|date=July 22, 2006|publisher=BBC News|first=Alastair|last=Leithead}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-06-19-taliban-afghanistan-cover_x.htm?csp=34|title=Revived Taliban waging 'full-blown insurgency'|accessdate=September 1, 2008|date=July 22, 2006|work=USA Today|first=Paul|last=Wiseman}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Bush commissioned 3,500 additional troops to the country in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/10/AR2007031001397.html|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=May 31, 2008|author=Baker, Peter|date=March 11, 2007|page=A11|title=Additional Troop Increase Approved}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning with his January 29, 2002 [[State of the Union address]], Bush began publicly focusing attention on Iraq, which he labeled as part of an &quot;[[axis of evil]]&quot; allied with terrorists and posing &quot;a grave and growing danger&quot; to U.S. interests through possession of [[weapons of mass destruction]].&lt;ref name=sotu2002/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq: The War Card|url=http://www.iwatchnews.org/accountability/iraq-war-card|publisher=The Center for Public Integrity|accessdate=November 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter half of 2002, CIA [[National Intelligence Estimate|reports]] contained assertions of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s intent of reconstituting nuclear weapons programs, not properly accounting for Iraqi [[Biological warfare|biological]] and [[Chemical warfare|chemical weapons]], and that some Iraqi missiles had a range greater than allowed by the UN sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/iraq_wmd/Iraq_Oct_2002.htm|title=Iraq's Weapons of Mass Destruction Programs|year=2002|month=October|publisher=[[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB129/index.htm|title=CIA Whites Out Controversial Estimate on Iraq Weapons|publisher=The National Security Archive|date=July 9, 2004|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contentions that the Bush Administration manipulated or exaggerated the threat and evidence of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction capabilities would eventually become a major point of criticism for the president.&lt;ref&gt;Judis, John B. and Ackerman, Spencer, “The Selling of the Iraq War”, ''[[The New Republic]]'', June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, Seymour M., &quot;The Stovepipe&quot;, ''[[The New Yorker]]'', October 27, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2002 and early 2003, Bush urged the United Nations to enforce Iraqi [[disarmament]] mandates, precipitating a [[Iraq disarmament crisis|diplomatic crisis]]. In November 2002, Hans Blix and [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] led UN weapons inspectors in Iraq, but were advised by the U.S. to depart the country four days prior to the U.S. invasion, despite their requests for more time to complete their tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-03-17-inspectors-iraq_x.htm|title=U.S. advises weapons inspectors to leave Iraq|work=USA Today|date=March 17, 2003|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. initially sought a [[UN Security Council]] resolution authorizing the use of military force but dropped the bid for UN approval due to vigorous opposition from several countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldpress.org/specials/iraq/chapterVII.htm|title=Enforcement Measures under Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|accessdate=September 1, 2008|author=UN|date=February 13, 2003|work=[[United Nations Charter]]|publisher=UN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They launched the invasion on March 20, 2003. The Iraqi military was quickly defeated. The capital, Baghdad, fell on April 9, 2003. On May 1, Bush declared the end of major combat operations in Iraq. The initial success of U.S. operations increased his popularity, but the U.S. and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups; Bush's &quot;[[2003 Mission Accomplished speech|Mission Accomplished]]&quot; speech was later criticized as premature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101031006/|title=Mission Not Accomplished|work=Time|date=October 6, 2003|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2004 until 2007, the situation in Iraq deteriorated further, with some observers arguing that there was a full scale [[civil war in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Colin Powell says Iraq in a 'civil war'|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/11/29/powell.iraq/index.html|publisher=CNN|date=November 29, 2006|accessdate=February 17, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070211072616/http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/11/29/powell.iraq/index.html|archivedate=February 11, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush's policies met with criticism, including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq.

A referendum to approve a constitution in Iraq was held in October 2005, supported by most [[Shiites]] and many [[Kurds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Fox News|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,173349,00.html|title=Iraq Constitution Passes in Referendum|date=October 25, 2005|accessdate=May 31, 2008|agency=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, 2007, Bush addressed the nation regarding the situation in Iraq. In this speech, he announced a [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|surge of 21,500 more troops for Iraq]], as well as a job program for Iraqis, more reconstruction proposals, and $1.2&amp;nbsp;billion for these programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16558652/page/1/|title=Admitting strategy error, Bush adds Iraq troops|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date=January 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 1, 2007, Bush used his veto for only the second time in his presidency, rejecting a congressional bill setting a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Sheryl Gay|last=Stolberg|coauthors=Zeleny, Jeff|title=Bush Vetoes Bill Tying Iraq Funds to Exit|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/02/washington/02policy.html|work=New York Times|date=May 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five years after the invasion, Bush called the debate over the conflict &quot;understandable&quot; but insisted that a continued U.S. presence there was crucial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/18/bush.iraq/index.html Bush on anniversary: War in Iraq must go on], ''CNN'', March 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2008, Bush praised the Iraqi government's &quot;bold decision&quot; to launch the [[Battle of Basra (2008)|Battle of Basra]] against the [[Mahdi Army]], calling it &quot;a defining moment in the history of a free Iraq&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/03/28/iraq.main/index.html Baghdad on lockdown as rockets, bombs fly], ''CNN'', March 28, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He said he would carefully weigh recommendations from his commanding General [[David Petraeus]] and Ambassador [[Ryan Crocker]] about how to proceed after the end of the military buildup in the summer of 2008. He also praised the Iraqis' legislative achievements, including a pension law, a revised de-Baathification law, a new budget, an amnesty law, and a provincial powers measure that, he said, set the stage for the [[Iraqi governorate elections, 2009|Iraqi elections]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/27/bush.iraq/index.html Bush: Baghdad's move against Shiite militias a 'bold decision'], ''CNN'', March 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 
A March 13, 2008, poll by the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press reported that 53% of Americans believe that &quot;the U.S. will ultimately succeed in achieving its goals&quot; in Iraq.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs up&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/03/13/politics/politico/main3933699.shtml|publisher=CBS|title=Support For Iraq War Highest Since 2006|accessdate=May 29, 2008|date=March 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; That figure was up from 42% in September 2007 and the highest since 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs up&quot;/&gt;

====Surveillance====
Following the events of September 11, Bush issued an executive order authorizing the [[President's Surveillance Program]] which included allowing the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] to monitor communications between suspected terrorists outside the U.S and parties within the U.S. without obtaining a warrant as required by the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Briefing by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and General Michael Hayden|publisher=The White House|date=December 19, 2005|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/12/20051219-1.html|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, the other provisions of program remained highly classified.&lt;ref name=IG&gt;{{cite report|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/17267628/Unclassified-Report-on-the-Presidents-Surveillance-Program|title=Unclassified Report on the President’s Surveillance Program|format=Scribd|author=Inspectors General of the DoD, DOJ, CIA, NSA, and ODN|date=July 10, 2009|accessdate=July 11, 2009|quote=The specific intelligence activities that were permitted by the Presidential Authorizations remain highly classified, except that beginning in December 2005 the President and other Administration officials acknowledged that these activities included the interception without a court order of certain international communications where there is &quot;a reasonable basis to conclude that one party to the communication is a member of al-Qa'ida, affiliated with al-Qa'ida, or a member of an organization affiliated with al-Qa'ida.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;) Once the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] [[Office of Legal Counsel]] questioned its original legal opinion that FISA did not apply in a time of war, the program was subsequently re-authorized by the President on the basis that the warrant requirements of FISA were implicitly superseded by the subsequent passage of the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Justice White Paper on NSA Legal Authorities. {{cite web|url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/nsa/dojnsa11906wp.pdf|format=PDF|title=Legal Authorities Supporting the Activities of the National Security Agency Described by the President|date=January 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program proved to be [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|controversial]], as critics of the administration, as well as organizations such as the [[American Bar Association]], argued that it was illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gonzales defends wiretaps amid protest|publisher=CNN|date=January 26, 2006|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/01/24/nsa.strategy/index.html|accessdate=September 2, 2007}}; {{cite news|title=Lawyers Group Criticizes Surveillance Program|work=The Washington Post|date=February 14, 2006|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/13/AR2006021302006.html|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2006, a U.S. district court judge ruled that the [[NSA electronic surveillance program]] was unconstitutional,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/01/AR2006090101410.html|title=Judge Asked to Suspend Ruling Against Wiretaps|accessdate=September 1, 2008|date=February 9, 2006|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; but on July 6, 2007, that ruling was [[vacated judgment|vacated]] by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit]] on the grounds that the plaintiffs lacked [[standing (law)|standing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Court dismisses lawsuit on spying program|agency=Reuters  |date=July 6, 2007|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/newsOne/idUSN0642400020070706|accessdate=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 17, 2007, Attorney General Alberto Gonzales informed U.S. Senate leaders that the program would not be reauthorized by the President, but would be subjected to judicial oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gonzales|first=Alberto|url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/AG_letter_to_Senate_leaders_regarding_FISC_decision_and_conclusion_of_Terrorist_Surveillance_Program|title=Letter from the AG to the Senate leaders|date=January 17, 2007|work=Wikisource|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Africa====
Bush has worked to reduce the [[HIV/AIDS]] epidemics in Africa, stop the spread of [[malaria]], and rebuild broken nations from their genocidal pasts.  One of the most notable programs initiated by Bush is the [[PEPFAR]] (President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief) Program, which was a commitment of $15 billion over five years (2003–2008) from the United States to fight the global HIV/AIDS pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/world/6537104.html &quot;Analysis finding drop in Africa HIV credits Bush project&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush withdrew U.S. support for several international agreements, including the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty]] (ABM) with Russia. 

Bush emphasized a careful approach to the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians; he denounced [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] leader [[Yasser Arafat]] for his support of violence, but sponsored dialogues between Prime Minister [[Ariel Sharon]] and Palestinian National Authority President [[Mahmoud Abbas]]. Bush supported Sharon's unilateral disengagement plan, and lauded the democratic elections held in Palestine after Arafat's death.

Bush also expressed U.S. support for the defense of Taiwan following the stand-off in April 2001 with the People's Republic of China over the [[Hainan Island incident]], when an [[Lockheed EP-3|EP-3E Aries II]] surveillance aircraft collided with a [[People's Liberation Army Air Force]] jet, leading to the detention of U.S. personnel.

===Judicial appointments===

====Supreme Court====
{{Main|George W. Bush Supreme Court candidates}}
Following the announcement of [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] Justice [[Sandra Day O'Connor]]'s retirement on July 1, 2005, Bush nominated [[John Roberts]] to succeed her. On September 5, following the death of [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[William Rehnquist]], this nomination was withdrawn and Bush instead nominated Roberts for Chief Justice to succeed Rehnquist. Roberts was confirmed by the Senate as the 17th Chief Justice on September 29, 2005.

On October 3, 2005, Bush nominated long time White House Counsel [[Harriet Miers]] for O'Connor's position.

In addition to his two Supreme Court appointments, Bush appointed 61 judges to the [[United States courts of appeals|United States Courts of Appeals]] and 261 judges to the [[United States district court]]s. Each of these numbers, along with his total of 324 judicial appointments, is third in American history, behind both [[Ronald Reagan]] and [[Bill Clinton]]. Bush experienced a number of [[George W.

At the outset, Judicature magazine noted that the &quot;Senate Democrats were gearing up for the approaching confirmation hearings&quot; before the first set of nominees were sent to the Senate.

During his second term a small plaza with a benches, garden and a monument in the center bearing his name was dedicated to President Bush located in Jerusalem, Israel between the King David Hotel and Jaffa Gate to the Old City. It is open continuously to the public with an open entrance and maintained by the City of Jerusalem municipality.

Bush released his memoirs, ''[[Decision Points]]'', on November 9, 2010.
