'''Nancy Patricia D'Alesandro Pelosi'''
({{IPAc-en|icon|p|ə|ˈ|l|oʊ|s|i}}; born March 26, 1940) is the [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives]] and served as the [[List of Speakers of the United States House of Representatives#List of Speakers|60th]] [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives]] from 2007 to 2011. She was the first woman to hold the office and to date, has been the highest-ranking female politician in American history.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/nancy-pelosi-d-calif/gIQAF3PM9O_topic.html Nancy Pelosi],&quot; Click on Read more.

A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], Pelosi has represented [[California's 8th congressional district]], which consists of four-fifths of the city and [[San Francisco|county of San Francisco]], since 1987. The district was numbered as the [[California's 5th congressional district|5th]] during Pelosi's first three terms in the House. She served as the [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Whip]] from 2002 to 2003, and was [[Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] from 2003 to 2007, holding the post during the [[108th United States Congress|108th]] and [[109th United States Congress|109th Congresses]]. Pelosi is the first woman, the first Californian and first Italian-American to lead a major party in Congress. After the Democrats took control of the House in 2007 and increased their majority in 2009, Pelosi was elected [[Speaker of the House]] for the [[110th United States Congress|110th]] and [[111th United States Congress|111th Congresses]].

On November 17, 2010, Pelosi was elected as the Democratic Leader by House Democrats and therefore the [[Minority Leader]] in the Republican-controlled House for the [[112th United States Congress|112th Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101117/ap_on_re_us/us_congress_pelosi],&quot; Associated Press.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Pelosi is Italian-American and was born '''Nancy Patricia D'Alesandro''' in [[Baltimore]], Maryland, the youngest of six children of Annunciata M. &quot;Nancy&quot; (née Lombardi) and [[Thomas D'Alesandro, Jr.]], who was a Democratic party U.S. Congressman from Maryland and a [[Mayor of Baltimore]].&lt;ref name=&quot;frelibrar&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Puzzanghera|first=Jim|title=Pelosi's aim for center may steer pundits wrong|publisher=San Jose Mercury News|date=November 14, 2002|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-119973286/pelosi-aim-center-may.html|accessdate=March 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msa.md.gov/megafile/msa/speccol/sc3500/sc3520/012400/012491/html/dalesandro3.html&lt;/ref&gt; Pelosi's brother, [[Thomas L. J. D'Alesandro III|Thomas D'Alesandro III]], also a Democrat, was mayor of Baltimore from 1967 to 1971, when he declined to run for a second term.

Pelosi was involved with politics from an early age. In her outgoing remarks as the 60th Speaker of the House, Pelosi noted that she had been present at [[John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy's]] [[Inaugural address of John F. Kennedy|inaugural address]] as President in January 1961. She graduated from the [[Institute of Notre Dame]], a Catholic all-girls high school in Baltimore, and from Trinity College (now [[Trinity Washington University]]) in Washington, D.C., in 1962 with a B.A. in [[political science]]. Pelosi interned for Senator [[Daniel Brewster]] (D-Maryland) alongside future House Majority Leader [[Steny Hoyer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/15/AR2006111501521.html

After moving to San Francisco, Pelosi worked her way up in Democratic politics. She became a friend of one of the leaders of the California Democratic Party, 5th District Congressman [[Phillip Burton]].

In 1976, Pelosi was elected as a [[Democratic National Committee]] member from California, a position she would hold until 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Chris McGreal in Washington |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/mar/26/nancy-pelosi-politician-speaker |title=Chris McGreal, '&amp;#39;Nancy Pelosi: is this the most powerful woman in US history?'&amp;#39;, The Guardian, March 26, 2010 |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= March 26, 2010|accessdate=June 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She was elected as party chair for Northern California on January 30, 1977, and for the [[California Democratic Party]], which she held from 1981 until 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot; /&gt;

Pelosi was appointed Finance Chair of the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]], the campaign arm of the [[U.S. Senate]] Democrats, in 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot; /&gt; That same year, she ran to succeed [[Chuck Manatt]] as chair of the Democratic National Committee, but lost to then-DNC Treasurer [[Paul G.

===Elections===
Phillip Burton died in 1983 and was succeeded by his wife, [[Sala Burton|Sala]]. In late 1986, Sala became ill with cancer and decided not to run for reelection in 1988. She picked Pelosi as her designated successor, guaranteeing her the support of the Burtons' contacts.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationnewface&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.thenation.com/doc/20010806/nichols2/2 Is this the new face of the Democratic Party?],&quot; ''The Nation'' . Retrieved February 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Sala died on February 1, 1987, just a month after being sworn in for a second full term. Pelosi won the special election to succeed her, narrowly defeating San Francisco Supervisor [[Harry Britt]] on April 7, 1987, then easily defeating Republican candidate Harriet Ross on June 2, 1987; Pelosi took office a week later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Associated Press  | title = Democrat Elected in San Francisco  | newspaper = New York Times  | date = June 3, 1987  | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE6D61339F930A35755C0A961948260}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | title = It began in Baltimore: The life and times of Nancy Pelosi  | newspaper = San Francisco Chronicle  | date = January 2, 2007  | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2007/01/02/MNG8QNBFNN1.DTL&amp;type=politics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pelosi represents one of the safest Democratic districts in the country. Democrats have held the seat since 1949 and [[United States Republican Party|Republicans]], who currently make up only 13 percent of registered voters in the district, have not made a serious bid for the seat since the early 1960s. She won the seat in her own right in 1988 and has been reelected 10 more times with no substantive opposition, winning by an average of 80 percent of the vote. She has not participated in candidates' debates since her 1987 race against Harriet Ross.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Edward|last=Epstein|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/10/20/BAG4PLT1OC1.DTL|title=CAMPAIGN 2006: Eighth Congressional District / 3 challengers fight for Pelosi seat|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=October 20, 2006, |page=B-1|accessdate=October 29, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strongest challenge Pelosi has faced was in 2008 when anti-war activist [[Cindy Sheehan]] polled 16% and Pelosi won with 72%.

She has the distinction of contributing the most among members of Congress to other congressional campaigns because she is in a safe district and does not need the campaign funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Suellentrop|first=Chris|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2073934/ Nancy Pelosi: The leader the House Democrats deserve|publisher=Slate|date=November 13, 2002|accessdate=February 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Committee assignments===
In the House, she served on the [[U.S. House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations]] and [[U.S. House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Intelligence]] Committees, and was the ranking Democrat on the Intelligence Committee until her election as Minority Leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-11-08-pelosi-congress_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=Pelosi to lead Congress | first=Andrea | last=Stone | date=November 9, 2006 | accessdate=May 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Speakership career===
In 2001, Pelosi was elected the [[House Minority Whip]], second-in-command to Minority Leader [[Dick Gephardt]] of [[Missouri]]. She was the first woman in U.S. history to hold that post.

In 2002, after Gephardt resigned as minority leader to seek the Democratic nomination in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], Pelosi was elected to replace him, becoming the first woman to lead a major party in the House.&lt;ref&gt;[http://speaker.house.gov/about/ Speaker Nancy Pelosi], U.S. House of Representatives Official Web Page . Retrieved February 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Speaker of the House===
====Nomination====
On November 16, 2006, Pelosi was unanimously chosen by her caucus as the Democratic candidate for Speaker, effectively making her Speaker-elect. While the Speaker is elected by the full House membership, in modern practice the election is a formality, since the Speaker always comes from the majority party.

Pelosi supported her longtime friend [[John Murtha]] of [[Pennsylvania]] for the position of [[House Majority Leader]], the second-ranking post in the House Democratic caucus. His competitor was [[House Minority Whip]] [[Steny Hoyer]] of [[Maryland]], who had been Pelosi's second-in-command since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

With her election, Pelosi became the first woman, the first Californian, and the first Italian-American to hold the Speakership. She is also the second Speaker from a state west of the [[Rocky Mountains]]. The first was [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]'s [[Tom Foley]], the last Democrat to hold the post before Pelosi.

During her speech, she discussed the historical importance of being the first female to hold the position of Speaker:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;This is a historic moment – for the Congress, and for the women of this country. It is a moment for which we have waited more than 200 years. Never losing faith, we waited through the many years of struggle to achieve our rights. But women weren't just waiting; women were working. Never losing faith, we worked to redeem the promise of America, that all men and women are created equal. For our daughters and granddaughters, today, we have broken the [[Glass ceiling|marble ceiling]]. For our daughters and our granddaughters, the sky is the limit, anything is possible for them&quot;.&lt;ref name=110speech&gt;SFGate.com (2006).

She also spoke on Iraq as the major issue facing the 110th Congress, while incorporating some Democratic Party beliefs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The election of 2006 was a call to change – not merely to change the control of Congress, but for a new direction for our country. Nowhere were the American people more clear about the need for a new direction than in Iraq. The American people rejected an open-ended obligation to a war without end.&quot;&lt;ref name=110speech/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Tenure====
As Speaker, Pelosi was still the leader of the House Democrats; the Speaker is reckoned as the leader of his or her House caucus. However, by tradition, she did not normally participate in debate (though she had the right to do so), and almost never voted on the floor. She was also not a member of any House committees.

Pelosi was re-elected Speaker in 2009.

A [[CBS News]] poll conducted in March 2010 found that 37% of registered voters have an unfavorable opinion of the speaker, with 11% approving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Montopoli |first=Brian |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20000937-503544.html |title=Poll: Low Favorability Ratings For Pelosi, Reid – Political Hotsheet |publisher=CBS News |date=March 22, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a March 2010 [[Rasmussen Reports|Rasmussen]] poll, 64% of voters nationally view the speaker unfavorably, and 29% have a favorable opinion of Pelosi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/politics/mood_of_america/congressional_favorability_ratings |title=Congressional Favorability Ratings – Rasmussen Reports |publisher=Rasmussenreports.com |date=May 23, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Social Security Mandate
Shortly after winning re-election, President [[George W. Bush]] claimed a [[Mandate (politics)|mandate]] for an ambitious second-term agenda and proposed reforming [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] by allowing workers to redirect a portion of their Social Security withholding into stock and bond investments.&lt;ref&gt;Sandalow, Marc. &quot;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2004/11/05/MNGOF9MKHV1.DTL Bush claims mandate, sets 2nd-term goals],&quot; ''San Francisco Chronicle'', November 5, 2004 . Retrieved February 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Pelosi strongly opposed the plan, saying there was no crisis, and as minority leader she imposed intense party discipline on her caucus, leading them to near-unanimous opposition to Bush's proposal, and subsequent defeat of the proposed plan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1376213-2,00.html Don't Mess With Pelosi], ''TIME Magazine'', August 27, 2006, .

;Blocking of impeachment proceedings against President Bush
In the wake of President George W. Bush's reelection in 2004, several leading House Democrats believed that Democrats should pursue [[Movement to impeach George W. Bush|impeachment proceedings against the president]]. They asserted that Bush had misled Congress about [[weapons of mass destruction]] in [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq]], and had violated the civil liberties of Americans by [[NSA warrantless surveillance controversy|authorizing wiretaps without a warrant]].

In May 2006, with an eye on the upcoming congressional elections–which offered the possibility of Democrats taking back control of the House for the first time since 1994–Pelosi told colleagues that, while the Democrats would conduct vigorous oversight of Bush administration policy, an impeachment investigation was &quot;off the table&quot;. (A week earlier, she had told the ''[[Washington Post]]'' that, although Democrats would not set out to impeach the president, &quot;you never know where&quot; investigations might lead.)&lt;ref&gt;Babington, Charles.

Retrieved February 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

After becoming Speaker of the House in January 2007, Pelosi held firm against impeachment, notwithstanding strong support for that course of action among constituents in her home district. In the November 2008 election, Pelosi withstood a challenge for her seat by [[anti-war]] activist [[Cindy Sheehan]], who ran as an independent primarily because of Pelosi's refusal to pursue impeachment.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sheehan considers challenge to Pelosi&quot;, by Angela K.

;The &quot;Hundred Hours&quot;
{{Main|100-Hour Plan}}
Prior to the [[United States elections, 2006|U.S. 2006 midterm elections]], Pelosi announced a plan for action: If elected, she and the newly empowered Democratic caucus would push through most of its program during the first hundred hours of the 110th Congress' term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://democraticleader.house.gov/media/press.cfm?pressReleaseID=1624 |title=Office of the Majority Leader Steny Hoyer |publisher=Democraticleader.house.gov |date=June 10, 2010 |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin for the name &quot;first hundred hours&quot; is a play on words derived from former Democratic [[President of the United States|President]] [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s promise for quick action on the part of government (to combat the [[Great Depression]]) during his [[New Deal#The First Hundred Days|&quot;first hundred days&quot;]] in office. [[Newt Gingrich]], who became Speaker of the House in 1995, had a similar 100-day agenda to implement the [[Contract with America]].

{{Main|Iraq War troop surge of 2007}}
On January 5, 2007, reacting to suggestions from President Bush's confidantes that he would increase troop levels in Iraq (which he announced in a speech a few days later), Pelosi joined with Senate Majority Leader [[Harry Reid]] to condemn the plan. They sent Bush a letter saying, &quot;[T]here is no purely military solution in Iraq. There is only a political solution. Adding more combat troops will only endanger more Americans and stretch our military to the breaking point for no strategic gain. ... Rather than deploy additional forces to Iraq, we believe the way forward is to begin the phased redeployment of our forces in the next four to six months, while shifting the principal mission of our forces there from combat to training, logistics, force protection and counter-terror.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://speaker.gov/newsroom/pressreleases?id=0021|date=01/05/2007| title=Congressional Leaders Call on President to Reject Flawed Iraq Troop Surge|author=Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV)}} Retrieved on January 24, 2007 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Speakership career===
Though Pelosi was re-elected by a comfortable margin in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]], the Democrats lost 63 seats and ceded control of the House of Representatives to the Republicans. Despite the electoral setback suffered by her party, Pelosi sought to continue leading the House Democratic Caucus in the position of Minority Leader, the office she held prior to becoming Speaker.

===Allegations of insider trading===
In November 2011, 60 Minutes alleged that Pelosi and several other member of Congress had used information they gleaned from closed sessions to make money on the stock market. The program cited Pelosi's purchases of Visa stock while a bill that would limit credit card fees was in the House. Pelosi denied the allegations and called the report &quot;a right-wing smear.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/45287592/ns/politics-more_politics/t/pelosi-fires-back-report-insider-trading/#.TtJGilb4WSo&lt;/ref&gt;

Pelosi was a founding member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]], but left in 2003 after being elected Minority Leader. Her longtime friend [[Jim McDermott]] of Washington told ''[[Newsweek]]'' that he and other left-leaning Democratic congressmen sometimes wish that &quot;she would tilt a little more our way from time to time&quot;.

America's commitment to the safety and security of the State of Israel is unwavering,...[h]owever, the [[war in Iraq]] has made both America and Israel less safe.&quot; Pelosi's voting record shows consistent support for Israel. Prior to 2006 elections in the Palestinian Authority, she voted for a Congressional initiative disapproving of participation in the elections by [[Hamas]] and other organizations defined as terrorist by the legislation. She agrees with the current U.S. stance in support of land-for-peace. She has applauded Israeli &quot;hopeful signs&quot; of offering land, while criticizing Palestinian &quot;threats&quot; of not demonstrating peace in turn. She states, &quot;If the Palestinians agree to coordinate with Israel on the evacuation, establish the rule of law, and demonstrate a capacity to govern, the world may be convinced that finally there is a real partner for peace&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;onIsrael&quot; /&gt;

During the [[2006 Lebanon War]], Pelosi voted in favor of Resolution 921 on the count that &quot;the seizure of Israeli soldiers by [[Hezbollah]] terrorists was an unprovoked attack and Israel has the right, and indeed the obligation, to respond&quot;. She argues that organizations and political bodies in the Mideast like [[Hamas]] and [[Hezbollah]] &quot;have a greater interest in maintaining a state of hostility with Israel than in improving the lives of the people they claim to represent&quot;. Pelosi asserts that civilians on both sides of the border &quot;have been put at risk by the aggression of Hamas and Hezbollah&quot; in part for their use of &quot;civilians as shields by concealing weapons in civilian areas&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://democraticleader.house.gov/press/articles.cfm?pressReleaseID=1704 Pelosi Floor Statement on House Resolution Reaffirming Support for Israel]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ceremony, Pelosi held up the replica dog tags of the three Israeli soldiers captured by Hezbollah and Hamas in 2006 and stated that she keeps them as a &quot;symbol of the sacrifices made, sacrifices far too great by the people of the state of Israel&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/cgi-bin/iowa/breaking/110444.html Two speakers toast to U.S.-Israel friendship], Jewish Telegraph Agency (JTA), September 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Waterboarding===
Pelosi has stated that she opposes the interrogation technique of [[waterboarding]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT Hero&quot;&gt;[[Mark Mazzetti|Mazzetti, Mark]].

According to the CIA, while Pelosi was the [[ranking member]] of the [[House Intelligence Committee]], she was told about [[enhanced interrogation techniques]], including waterboarding authorized for a captured terrorist, Abu Zubaydah,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/nov05election/detail?entry_id=39012 Torture battle escalating, Pelosi vs. Boehner], ''San Francisco Chronicle'', April 23, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;post tude&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/12/08/AR2007120801664_pf.html Hill Briefed on Waterboarding in 2002], The Washington Post, December 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kane, Paul. &quot;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/05/08/MNGC17GU6F.DTL&amp;type=politics Pelosi briefed in 2002 on interrogation tactics],&quot; ''San Francisco Chronicle'', May 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; in one hour-long briefing in 2002.

But there was no objecting, no hand-wringing. The attitude was, 'We don't care what you do to those guys as long as you get the information you need to protect the American people.' &quot;

However, several top Democratic lawmakers in the House signed a letter on June 26, 2009, alleging that [[Director of the Central Intelligence Agency|CIA Director]] [[Leon Panetta]] had asserted that the CIA misled Congress for a &quot;number of years&quot; spanning back to 2001, casting more clouds on the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/public/resources/documents/CIAPanetta070809.pdf Open Letter from the Congress of the United States].

===On President Bush===
In mid-July 2008, two days after President [[George W.
