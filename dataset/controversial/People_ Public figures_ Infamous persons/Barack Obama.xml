The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction to propose further deficit reduction with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5&amp;nbsp;trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2&amp;nbsp;trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web|author=By NBC's Sylvie Stein|url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/08/02/7231805-a-breakdown-of-the-debt-limit-legislation|title=First Read&amp;nbsp;— A breakdown of the debt-limit legislation|publisher=msnbc.com|accessdate=August 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] [[Default (finance)|default]] on its obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/43967924/ns/politics-capitol_hill/|title=House passes debt ceiling bill|publisher=msnbc.com|date=March 8, 2011|accessdate=August 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obama called for [[United States Congress|Congress]] to pass legislation reforming [[health care in the United States]], a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;health reform&quot; /&gt; He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900&amp;nbsp;billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the [[public health insurance option|public option]], to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for [[pre-existing condition]]s, and require every American carry health coverage. The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/10/us/politics/10obama.html|title=Obama, Armed With Details, Says Health Plan Is Necessary|author=Stolberg, Sheryl Gay|author2=Zeleny, Jeff|date=September 9, 2009|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quick |web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0909/26907.html|title=Obama will hedge on public option|work= Politico|accessdate=September 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law faced several legal challenges, primarily based on the argument that an individual mandate requiring Americans to buy health insurance was unconstitutional. On June 28, 2012, the Supreme Court ruled by a 5–4 vote in ''[[National Federation of Independent Business v.

===Religious views===
Obama is a Christian whose religious views developed in his adult life. He wrote in ''The Audacity of Hope'' that he &quot;was not raised in a religious household&quot;. He described his mother, raised by non-religious parents (whom Obama has specified elsewhere as &quot;non-practicing Methodists and Baptists&quot;), to be detached from religion, yet &quot;in many ways the most spiritually awakened person that I have ever known&quot;. He described his father as a &quot;confirmed [[atheist]]&quot; by the time his parents met, and his stepfather as &quot;a man who saw religion as not particularly useful&quot;. Obama explained how, through working with [[black church]]es as a [[Community organizing|community organizer]] while in his twenties, he came to understand &quot;the power of the African-American religious tradition to spur social change&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;social change&quot; /&gt;

In an interview with the evangelical periodical ''[[Christianity Today]]'', Obama stated: &quot;I am a Christian, and I am a devout Christian. I believe in the redemptive death and resurrection of Jesus Christ. I believe that that faith gives me a path to be cleansed of sin and have eternal life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2008/januaryweb-only/104-32.0.html?start=2 Christianity Today: &quot;Q&amp;A: Barack Obama&quot;] Interview by Sarah Pulliam and Ted Olsen, January 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On September 27, 2010, Obama released a statement commenting on his religious views saying &quot;I'm a Christian by choice. My family didn't—frankly, they weren't folks who went to church every week. And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of Jesus Christ spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead—being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;APbychoice&quot;&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/28/obama-christian-by-choice_n_742124.html?view=print Obama 'Christian By Choice': President Responds To Questioner] by Charles Babington and Darlene Superville, [[Associated Press]], September 28, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ABCVideobychoice&quot;&gt;Video&amp;nbsp;– [http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/09/president-obama-i-am-a-christian-by-choicethe-precepts-of-jesus-spoke-to-me.html President Obama: &quot;I am a Christian By Choice&quot;] by [[ABC News]], September 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
