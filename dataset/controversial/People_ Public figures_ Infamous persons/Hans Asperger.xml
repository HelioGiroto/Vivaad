'''Hans Asperger''' (February 18, 1906 – October 21, 1980) was an [[Austria]]n [[pediatrician]], [[medical theory|medical theorist]], and medical professor. He is best known for his early studies on mental disorders, especially in children. His work was largely unnoticed during his lifetime except for a few accolades in [[Vienna]], and his studies on psychological disorders only acquired world renown posthumously. There was a resurgence of interest in his work beginning in the 1980s, and due to his earlier work which is regarded by some as under the fold of [[autism spectrum disorder]]s, [[Asperger syndrome]] (AS) was named after him. Both Asperger's original paediatric diagnosis of AP and the [[eponym|eponymous]] diagnosis of AS that was named for him several decades after are controversial.

==Personal life==
Hans Asperger was born on a farm outside of Vienna.&lt;ref name=&quot;whonameit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/302.html|title=Whonameit biography|accessdate=11/8/2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the elder of two sons. He had difficulty finding friends and was considered a lonely, remote child.&lt;ref name=Lyons/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feinstein/&gt; As a child, Asperger himself appeared to have exhibited features of the condition subsequently named after him. He was talented in language; in particular he was interested in the Austrian poet [[Franz Grillparzer]], whose poetry he would frequently quote to his uninterested classmates. He also liked to quote himself and often referred to himself from a third-person perspective.&lt;ref name=Lyons&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J Autism Dev Disord |year=2007 |title=Did Hans Asperger (1906–1980) have Asperger Syndrome? |author=Lyons V, Fitzgerald M |doi=10.1007/s10803-007-0382-4 |pmid=17917805 |volume=37 |issue=10 |pages=2020–1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asperger studied medicine at the [[University of Vienna]] under Franz Hamburger&lt;ref name = Feinstein&gt;{{cite book |first=Adam |last=Feinstein |year=2010 |title=A History of Autism: Conversations with the Pioneers &amp;#124; | publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons | isbn=1-4443-5167-2 | page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and practiced at the University Children's Hospital in Vienna. He graduated doctor of medicine in 1931 and became director of the special education section at the university children's clinic in Vienna in 1932.&lt;ref name=&quot;whonameit&quot; /&gt; He married in 1935 and had five children.&lt;ref name=Lyons/&gt;

==Career==
During [[World War II]], he was a medical officer, serving in the [[Axis Powers|Axis]] occupation of [[Independent State of Croatia|Croatia]]; his younger brother died at [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]].&lt;ref name=Lyons/&gt;  Near the end of the war, Asperger opened a school for children with Sister Victorine Zak. The school was bombed and destroyed, Sister Victorine was killed, and much of Asperger's early work was lost.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} 

Asperger published a definition of autistic psychopathy in 1944 that was nearly identical with the definition published earlier by a Russian neurologist Grunya Sukhareva (Груня Ефимовна Сухарева) in 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Nieminen-von Wendt, Taina 2004: On the origins and diagnosis of asperger syndrome: a clinical, neuroimaging and genetic study. The University of Helsinki. Page 10. http://ethesis.helsinki.fi/julkaisut/laa/kliin/vk/nieminen-wendt/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Ssucharewa G. E. | year = 1926 | title = Die schizoiden Psychopathien im Kindesalter | url = http://content.karger.com/produktedb/produkte.asp?doi=316609 | journal = Monatsschrift für Psychiatrie und Neurologie | volume = 60 | issue = | pages = 235–261 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asperger identified in four boys a pattern of behavior and abilities that included &quot;a lack of [[empathy]], little ability to form friendships, one-sided conversations, intense absorption in a special interest, and clumsy movements&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Asperger called children with AP &quot;little professors&quot; because of their ability to talk about their favorite subject in great detail. Asperger noticed that many of the children he identified as being autistic used their special talents in adulthood and had successful careers. One of them became a professor of [[astronomy]] and solved an error in [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]’s work he had originally noticed as a student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Asperger H | year = 1944 | title = Die &quot;Autistischen Psychopathen&quot; im Kindesalter | url = | journal = Archiv für Psychiatrie und Nervenkrankheiten | volume = 117 | issue = | pages = 132–135 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another one of Asperger's patients was the Austrian writer and [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize in Literature laureate]], [[Elfriede Jelinek]].&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, V., Koberg, R.: Elfriede Jelinek: Ein Porträt. Rowohlt 2006, p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1944, after the publication of his landmark paper describing autistic symptoms, he found a permanent tenured post at the University of Vienna.  Shortly after the war ended, he became director of a children's clinic in the city. He was appointed chair of pediatrics at the University of Vienna, a post he held for twenty years. He later held a post at [[Innsbruck]].  Beginning in 1964, he headed the [[SOS Children's Villages|SOS-Kinderdorf]] in [[Hinterbrühl]].&lt;ref name=&quot;whonameit&quot; /&gt; He became professor emeritus in 1977, and died three years later. Asperger syndrome is named after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autism-world.com/index.php/2007/03/20/hans-asperger/|accessdate=2007-03-20 |author= Echo Armman |title= Hans Asperger |publisher= Autism-World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Posthumous developments==
{{further|History of Asperger syndrome}}
Asperger died before his identification of this pattern of behaviour became widely recognised. This was in part due to his work being exclusively in German and as such it was little-translated; medical academics, then as now, also disregarded Asperger's work based on its merits or lack there-of. English researcher [[Lorna Wing]] proposed the condition Asperger's syndrome in a 1981 paper, ''Asperger's syndrome: a clinical account'', that challenged the previously accepted model of autism presented by [[Leo Kanner]] in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= [[Lorna Wing|Wing L]] |title= Asperger's syndrome: a clinical account |journal= Psychol Med |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=115–29 |year=1981 |doi=10.1017/S0033291700053332 |pmid=7208735 |url=http://www.mugsy.org/wing2.htm |accessdate=2007-08-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 1991 that an authoritative translation of Asperger's work was made by Uta Frith; before this AS had still been &quot;virtually unknown&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;What'sSpecial&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author= Baron-Cohen S, Klin A |title= What's so special about Asperger Syndrome? |journal= Brain Cogn |volume=61 |issue=1 |pages=1–4 |year=2006 |pmid=16563588 |doi=10.1016/j.bandc.2006.02.002 |url=http://www.elsevier.com/authored_subject_sections/S05/S05_360/pdf/klin.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frith said that fundamental questions regarding the diagnosis had not been answered, and the necessary scientific data to address this did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Frith |first=Uta |authorlink=Uta Frith |coauthors= |title=Autism and Asperger Syndrome |year=1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge |isbn= 0-521-38608-X}} p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Kanner, who overshadowed Asperger, the latter's findings were ignored and disregarded in the English-speaking world in his lifetime. In the early 1990s Asperger's work gained some notice due to Wing's research on the subject and Frith's recent translation, leading to the inclusion of the eponymous condition in the [[ICD-10]] in 1993, and the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM-IV]] in 1994, some half a century after Asperger's original research. Despite this brief resurgence of interest in his work in the 1990s, AS remains a controversial and contentious diagnosis due to its unclear relationship to the autism spectrum. The [[World Health Organization]]'s ICD describes AS as &quot;a disorder of uncertain nosological validity&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;({{ICD10|F|84|5|f|80}})&lt;/ref&gt; and there is majority consensus to phase the diagnosis out of the [[American Psychiatric Association]]'s diagnosis manual.&lt;ref name=DSMV&gt;{{cite web|title=299.80 Asperger's Disorder |work=DSM-5 Development |publisher=American Psychiatric Association |accessdate=2010-12-21 |url=http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevisions/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=97# }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1944 paper, as [[Uta Frith]] translated from the German in 1991, Asperger wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;We are convinced, then, that autistic people have their place in the organism of the social community. They fulfill their role well, perhaps better than anyone else could, and we are talking of people who as children had the greatest difficulties and caused untold worries to their care-givers.&lt;ref name=ha&gt;{{cite book |author= Asperger H; translated and annotated by Frith U |origyear=1944 |chapter= 'Autistic psychopathy' in childhood |editor= Frith U |title= Autism and Asperger syndrome |year=1991 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-38608-X |pages=37–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  [[Eric Schopler]] wrote in 1998:&lt;blockquote&gt;Asperger's own publications did not inspire research, replication, or scientific interest prior to 1980. Instead, he laid the fertile groundwork for the diagnostic confusion that has grown since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Asperger Syndrome or High-Functioning Autism? |editors= Eric Schopler, Gery B.

Asperger's birthday, February 18, was declared International Asperger's Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url= http://www.janmclucas.fahcsia.gov.au/mediareleases/2011/Pages/inter_asperger_day_18022011.aspx |title=  International Asperger's Day  |publisher= Senator the Hon Jan McLucas |date= 2011-02-18|accessdate= 2012-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
