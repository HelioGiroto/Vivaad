Bush]].

Born in [[Lincoln, Nebraska]], Cheney was primarily raised in [[Sumner, Nebraska]], and [[Casper, Wyoming]].&lt;ref&gt;Cheney: The Untold Story of America's Most Powerful and Controversial Vice President, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; He began his political career as an intern for Congressman [[William A.

In 1978, Cheney was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] from [[Wyoming]]; he was reelected five times, eventually becoming [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Whip]]. Cheney was selected to be the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] during the presidency of [[George H. W. Bush]], holding the position for the majority of Bush's term.

==Early life and education==
Cheney was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, the son of Marjorie Lorraine (née Dickey) and Richard Herbert Cheney. He is of predominantly English, as well as [[Welsh people|Welsh]], Irish, and French Huguenot, ancestry; Cheney's 8th great-grandfather, William Cheney, immigrated from England to Massachusetts in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Battle, Robert A., [http://familytreemaker.genealogy.com/users/b/a/t/Robert-A-Battle/FILE/0006page.html &quot;Ancestry of Richard Bruce Cheney&quot;].

&lt;/ref&gt; Cheney testified during his confirmation hearings in 1989 that he received deferments to finish a college career that lasted six years rather than four, owing to sub-par academic performance and the need to work to pay for his education. Initially, he was not called up because the [[Selective Service System]] was only taking older men. When he became eligible for the draft, he applied for four deferments in sequence. He applied for his fifth exemption on January 19, 1966, when his wife was about 10 weeks pregnant. He was granted 3-A status, the &quot;hardship&quot; exemption, which excluded men with children or dependent parents. In January 1967, Cheney turned 26 and was no longer eligible for the draft.&lt;ref&gt;

Cheney's political career began in 1969, as an intern for Congressman [[William A. Steiger]] during the [[Richard Nixon]] Administration. He then joined the staff of [[Donald Rumsfeld]], who was then Director of the [[Office of Economic Opportunity]] from 1969–70.&lt;ref name=&quot;cheney video&quot;/&gt; He held several positions in the years that followed: White House Staff Assistant in 1971, Assistant Director of the Cost of Living Council from 1971–73, and Deputy Assistant to the president from 1974–1975. As deputy assistant, Cheney suggested several options in a memo to Rumsfeld, including use of the [[US Justice Department]],  that the [[Ford administration]] could use to limit damage from an article, published by ''[[The New York Times]],'' in which investigative reporter [[Seymour Hersh]] reported that Navy submarines had tapped into Soviet undersea communications as part of a highly classified program, [[Operation Ivy Bells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 1986, Cheney, along with 145 Republicans and 31 Democrats, voted against a non-binding Congressional resolution calling on the South African government to release [[Nelson Mandela]] from prison, after the Democrats defeated proposed amendments that would have required Mandela to renounce violence sponsored by the [[African National Congress]] (ANC) and requiring it to oust the communist faction from its leadership; the resolution was defeated. Appearing on [[CNN]], Cheney addressed criticism for this, saying he opposed the resolution because the ANC &quot;at the time was viewed as a terrorist organization and had a number of interests that were fundamentally inimical to the United States.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

He directed the [[United States invasion of Panama]] and [[Operation Desert Storm]] in the Middle East. In 1991 he was awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] by Bush.&lt;ref name=&quot;1988 hmw&quot;/&gt;

===Early tenure===
Cheney worked closely with [[Pete Williams (television correspondent)|Pete Williams]], Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs, and [[Paul Wolfowitz]], Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, from the beginning of his tenure. He focused primarily on external matters, and left most internal Pentagon management to Deputy Secretary of Defense [[Donald J. Atwood Jr.|Donald J. Atwood, Jr.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheney DoD bio&quot;/&gt;

===Budgetary practices===
Cheney's most immediate issue as Secretary of Defense was the [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] budget. Cheney deemed it appropriate to cut the budget and downsize the military, following President [[Ronald Reagan]]'s peacetime defense buildup at the height of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the fiscal year 1990 budget, Cheney assessed the requests from each of the branches of the armed services for such expensive programs as the [[B-2 Spirit|B-2]] stealth bomber, the [[V-22 Osprey]] tilt-wing [[helicopter]], the [[Aegis destroyer]] and the [[LGM-118 Peacekeeper|MX missile]], totaling approximately $4.5 billion in light of changed world politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheney DoD bio&quot;/&gt; Cheney opposed the V-22 program, which Congress had already appropriated funds for, and initially refused to issue contracts for it before relenting.&lt;ref&gt;

When the 1990 Budget came before Congress in the summer of 1989, it settled on a figure between the Administration's request and the [[House Armed Services Committee]]'s recommendation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheney DoD bio&quot;&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
In subsequent years under Cheney, the proposed and adopted budgets followed patterns similar to that of 1990. Early in 1991, he unveiled a plan to reduce military strength by the mid-1990s to 1.6 million, compared with 2.2 million when he entered office. Cheney's 1993 defense budget was reduced from 1992, omitting programs that Congress had directed the Department of Defense to buy weapons that it did not want, and omitting unrequested reserve forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheney DoD bio&quot;/&gt;

Over his four years as Secretary of Defense, Cheney downsized the military and his budgets showed negative real growth, despite pressures to acquire weapon systems advocated by Congress. The Department of Defense's total obligational authority in current dollars declined from $291 billion to $270 billion. Total military personnel strength decreased by 19 percent, from about 2.2 million in 1989 to about 1.8 million in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheney DoD bio&quot;/&gt;  Notwithstanding the overall reduction in military spending, Cheney directed the development of a Pentagon plan to ensure U.S. military dominance in the post-Cold War era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/nukevault/ebb245/index.htm |title=&quot;Prevent the Reemergence of a New Rival&quot; – The Making of the Cheney Regional Defense Strategy, 1991–1992 |publisher=[[National Security Archive]] |accessdate=November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political climate and agenda===
Cheney publicly expressed concern that nations such as [[Iraq]], Iran, and [[North Korea]], could acquire nuclear components after the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991. The end of the Cold War, the fall of the Soviet Union, and the disintegration of the [[Warsaw Pact]] obliged the first Bush Administration to reevaluate the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|North Atlantic Treaty Organization's]] (NATO's) purpose and makeup. Cheney believed that NATO should remain the foundation of European security relationships and that it would remain important to the United States in the long term; he urged the alliance to lend more assistance to the new democracies in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheney DoD bio&quot;/&gt;

Cheney's views on NATO reflected his skepticism about prospects for peaceful social development in the former [[Eastern Bloc]] countries, where he saw a high potential for political uncertainty and instability. He felt that the Bush Administration was too optimistic in supporting [[General Secretary of the CPSU]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and his successor, [[President of Russia|Russian President]] [[Boris Yeltsin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheney DoD bio&quot;/&gt; Cheney worked to maintain strong ties between the United States and its European allies.&lt;ref&gt;

Cheney persuaded the [[Saudi Arabia]]n [[aristocracy]] to allow bases for US ground troops and war planes in the nation. This was an important element of the success of the [[Gulf War]], as well as a lightning-rod for [[Islamist]]s who opposed having non-Muslim armies near their holy sites.&lt;ref name=&quot;JINSA&quot;/&gt;

===International situations===
Using [[economic sanctions]] and political pressure, the United States mounted a campaign to drive [[Panama]]nian ruler General [[Manuel Antonio Noriega]] from power after he fell from favour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheney DoD bio&quot;/&gt; In May 1989, after [[Guillermo Endara]] had been duly elected [[President of Panama]], Noriega nullified the election outcome, drawing intensified pressure. In October, Noriega suppressed a [[military coup]], but in December, after soldiers of the [[Panamanian army]] killed a US serviceman, the United States invasion of Panama began under Cheney's direction. The stated reason for the invasion was to seize Noriega to face drug charges in the United States, protect US lives and property, and restore Panamanian [[civil liberties]].&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Cheney Gulf War news conference.jpg|thumb|right|Secretary of Defense Cheney during a press conference on the [[Gulf War]]]]
In 1991, the [[Somali Civil War]] drew the world's attention. In August 1992, the United States began to provide [[humanitarian assistance]], primarily food, through a military airlift. At President Bush's direction, Cheney dispatched the first of 26,000 US troops to [[Somalia]] as part of the [[Unified Task Force]] (UNITAF), designed to provide security and food relief.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheney DoD bio&quot;/&gt; Cheney's successors as Secretary of Defense, [[Les Aspin]] and [[William J. Perry]], had to contend with both the Bosnian and Somali issues.

====Iraqi invasion of Kuwait====
On August 1, 1990, Iraqi President [[Saddam Hussein]] [[Gulf War|sent invading forces into neighboring Kuwait]], a small petroleum-rich state long claimed by Iraq as part of its territory.&lt;ref name=&quot;gulf war pbs&quot;&gt;
{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 140,000 [[Iraqi troops]] quickly took control of [[Kuwait City]] and moved on to the [[Saudi Arabia]]/Kuwait border.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheney DoD bio&quot;/&gt; The United States had already begun to develop contingency plans for the defense of Saudi Arabia by the [[US Central Command]], headed by General [[Norman Schwarzkopf]], because of its important petroleum reserves.

=====U.S. and world reaction=====
[[File:Cheney meeting with Prince Sultan.jpg|thumb|left|Cheney meets with [[Sultan, Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia|Prince Sultan, Minister of Defence and Aviation]] in Saudi Arabia to discuss how to handle the [[invasion of Kuwait]]]]
Cheney and Schwarzkopf oversaw planning for what would become a full-scale U.S. military operation. According to General [[Colin Powell]], Cheney &quot;had become a glutton for information, with an appetite we could barely satisfy. He spent hours in the National Military Command Center peppering my staff with questions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheney DoD bio&quot;/&gt;

Shortly after the Iraqi invasion, Cheney made the first of several visits to Saudi Arabia where [[King Fahd]] requested U.S. military assistance. The United Nations took action as well, passing a series of resolutions condemning Iraq's invasion of Kuwait; the [[UN Security Council]] authorized &quot;all means necessary&quot; to eject Iraq from Kuwait, and demanded that the country withdraw its forces by January 15, 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;gulf war pbs&quot;/&gt; By then, the United States had a force of about 500,000 stationed in Saudi Arabia and the [[Persian Gulf]]. Other nations, including Britain, Canada, France, Italy, [[Syria]], and [[Egypt]], contributed troops, and other allies, most notably Germany and Japan, agreed to provide financial support for the coalition effort, named [[Operation Desert Shield (Gulf War)|Operation Desert Shield]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheney DoD bio&quot;/&gt;

On January 12, 1991, Congress authorized Bush to use military force to enforce Iraq's compliance with UN resolutions on Kuwait.&lt;ref name=&quot;gulf war pbs&quot;/&gt;

=====Military action=====
The first phase of [[Operation Desert Storm]], which began on January 17, 1991, was an air offensive to secure air superiority and attack Iraq's forces, targeting key Iraqi command and control centers, including [[Baghdad]] and [[Basra]]. Cheney turned most other Department of Defense matters over to Deputy Secretary Atwood and briefed Congress during the air and ground phases of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheney DoD bio&quot;/&gt; He flew with Powell to the region (specifically [[Riyadh]]) to review and finalize the ground war plans.&lt;ref name=&quot;gulf war pbs&quot;/&gt;

After an air offensive of more than five weeks, the UN coalition launched the ground war on February 24. Within 100 hours, Iraqi forces had been routed from Kuwait and Schwarzkopf reported that the basic objective—expelling Iraqi forces from Kuwait—had been met on February 27.&lt;ref name=&quot;gulf war military&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; After consultation with Cheney and other members of his national security team, Bush declared a suspension of hostilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;gulf war pbs&quot;/&gt;

=====Aftermath=====
A total of 147 U.S. military personnel died in combat, and another 236 died as a result of accidents or other causes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheney DoD bio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gulf war military&quot;/&gt; Iraq agreed to a formal truce on March 3, and a permanent cease-fire on April 6.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheney DoD bio&quot;/&gt;  There was subsequent debate about whether the UN coalition should have driven as far as Baghdad to oust Saddam Hussein from power. Bush agreed that the decision to end the ground war when they did was correct, but the debate persisted as Hussein remained in power and rebuilt his military forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cheney DoD bio&quot;/&gt; Arguably the most significant debate concerned whether U.S. and coalition forces had left Iraq too soon.&lt;ref&gt;

We're always going to have to be involved [in the Middle East]. Maybe it's part of our national character, you know we like to have these problems nice and neatly wrapped up, put a ribbon around it. You deploy a force, you win the war and the problem goes away and it doesn't work that way in the Middle East it never has and isn't likely to in my lifetime.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Private sector career==
Between 1987 and 1989, during his last term in Congress, Cheney was a director of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] foreign policy organization.&lt;ref name=cfr&gt;{{cite web

|title=The Council on Foreign Relations from 1921 to 1996 – Historical Roster of Directors and Officers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the new Democratic administration under President [[Bill Clinton]] in [[United States presidential election, 1992|January 1993]], Cheney left the Department of Defense and joined the [[American Enterprise Institute]]. He also served a second term as a Council on Foreign Relations director from 1993 to 1995.&lt;ref name=cfr/&gt; From 1995 until 2000, he served as Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer of [[Halliburton]], a [[Fortune 500]] company and market leader in the energy sector.

Cheney's record as CEO was subject to some dispute among [[Wall Street]] analysts; a 1998 merger between Halliburton and [[Dresser Industries]] attracted the criticism of some Dresser executives for Halliburton's lack of accounting transparency.&lt;ref&gt;

A few months before the election Cheney put his home in Dallas up for sale and changed his drivers' license and voter registration back to Wyoming.  This change was necessary to allow Texas' presidential electors to vote for both Bush and Cheney without contravening the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution]], which forbids electors from voting for someone from their own state for both President and Vice President.

Cheney campaigned against [[Al Gore]]'s running mate, [[Joseph Lieberman]], in the 2000 presidential election. While the election was undecided, the Bush-Cheney team was not eligible for public funding to plan a transition to a new administration. So, Cheney opened a privately funded transition office in Washington. This office worked to identify candidates for all important positions in the cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;

The Republicans nominated Arizona Senator [[John McCain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/295zkwpw.asp|title=President Cheney?|last=Barnes|first=Fred|publisher=The Weekly Standard|volume=10|number=23|date=March 7, 2005|accessdate=December 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Enron scandal]], the Bush administration was accused of improper political and business ties. In July 2003, the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] ruled that the [[US Department of Commerce]] must disclose NEPDG documents, containing references to companies that had made agreements with the previous Iraqi government to extract Iraq's petroleum.&lt;ref name=&quot;nepdg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Judicial Watch, Inc. vs. National Energy Policy Development Group|url=http://www.judicialwatch.org/printer_1270.shtml|accessdate=December 18, 2007|year=2004|publisher=Judicial Watch, Inc|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071008232628/http://www.judicialwatch.org/printer_1270.shtml &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=October 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following an indictment, Libby resigned his positions as Cheney's chief of staff and assistant on national security affairs.

On September 8, 2006, [[Richard Armitage (politician)|Richard Armitage]], former Deputy Secretary of State, publicly announced that he was the source of the revelation of Plame's status.

When former Vice President [[Dan Quayle]] suggested to Cheney that the office was largely ceremonial, Cheney reportedly replied, &quot;I have a different understanding with the president.&quot; The articles described Cheney as having a secretive approach to the tools of government, indicated by the use of his own security classification and three man-sized safes in his offices.&lt;ref&gt;

[...] Why doesn't he want to admit we're at war? It doesn't fit with the view of the world he brought with him to the Oval Office. It doesn't fit with what seems to be the goal of his presidency—social transformation—the restructuring of American society.&quot;&lt;ref name=politico_dec2009&gt;

===Hunting incident===
{{main|Dick Cheney hunting incident}}
On February 11, 2006, Dick Cheney shot [[Harry Whittington]], a 78-year-old [[Texas]] [[Lawyer|attorney]], while participating in a [[quail]] hunt at Armstrong ranch in [[Kenedy County, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0216061cheney1.html Texas Cops Release Cheney Shooting Report],&quot; ''[[The Smoking Gun]]''&lt;/ref&gt;   [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] agents and medical aides, who were traveling with Cheney, came to Whittington's assistance and treated his birdshot wounds to his right cheek, neck, and chest. An ambulance standing by for the Vice President took Whittington to nearby [[Kingsville, Texas|Kingsville]] before he was flown by helicopter to [[Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital]] in [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]]. On February 14, 2006, Whittington suffered a non-fatal [[Myocardial infarction#Signs and symptoms|heart attack]] and [[atrial fibrillation]] due to at least one lead-shot pellet lodged in or near his heart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seattlepi_14Feb&quot;&gt; {{cite news | publisher = Seattle Post-Intelligencer | title = Hunter shot by Cheney has heart attack |date=2006-02-14 |url = http://www.seattlepi.com/national/1110AP_Cheney_Whittington.html?source=mypi |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}} &lt;/ref&gt; Because of the small size of the birdshot pellets, doctors decided to leave up to 200 pieces of the pellets lodged in his body rather than try to remove them.

The Secret Service stated that they notified the Sheriff about one hour after the shooting.  Kenedy County Sheriff Ramone Salinas III stated that he first heard of the shooting at about 5:30 PM.&lt;ref name=&quot;cheney_cited&quot;&gt; {{cite news | publisher = CBS News | title = Cheney Cited for Breaking Hunting Law |date=2006-02-14 |url = http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-1315479.html |accessdate = July 19, 2012|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next day, ranch owner Katharine Armstrong informed the  [[Corpus Christi Caller-Times]] of the shooting.&lt;ref name=&quot;smokinggun_incident_report&quot;&gt; [http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/0213061cheney1.html Texas Parks and Wildlife Hunting Accident and Incident Report Form], February 13, 2006, posted in [[The Smoking Gun]]. URL Accessed on February 14, 2006. &lt;/ref&gt;  Cheney had a televised interview with [[MSNBC]] News about the shooting on February 15. Both Cheney and Whittington have called the incident an accident. Early reports indicated that Cheney and Whittington were friends and that the injuries were minor.  Whittington has since told the ''Washington Post'' that he and Cheney were not close friends but acquaintances and has not said if Cheney apologized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/13/AR2010101307173.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Paul | last=Farhi | title=Since Dick Cheney shot him, Harry Whittington's aim has been to move on | date=2010-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sheriff’s office released a report on the shooting on February 16, 2006 and witness statements on February 22, indicating that the shooting occurred on clear sunny day, and Whittington was shot from 30 or {{convert|40|yd|m|-1}} away while searching for a downed bird. Armstrong, the ranch owner, claimed that all in the hunting party were wearing blaze-orange safety gear and none had been drinking.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news | title = White House Deferred to Cheney on Shooting | publisher = Washington Post |date=2006-02-14 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/13/AR2006021300452.html | first1=Jim | last1=VandeHei | first2=Sylvia | last2=Moreno | accessdate=2010-05-01}} &lt;/ref&gt; However, Cheney has acknowledged that he had one beer four or five hours prior to the shooting.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news | publisher = CNN | title = Cheney: 'One of the worst days of my life' |date=2006-02-16 |url = http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/02/15/cheney/index.html}} &lt;/ref&gt; Although Kenedy County Sheriff's Office documents support the official story by Cheney and his party, re-creations of the incident produced by George Gongora and John Metz of the Corpus Christi Caller-Times indicated that the actual shooting distance was closer than the 30 yards claimed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher = Corpus Christi Caller-Times | title = Avid shooter simulates the accident, its injuries |date=2006-02-14 |url = http://www.caller.com/news/2006/feb/14/avid-shooter-simulates-the-accident-its-injuries/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
