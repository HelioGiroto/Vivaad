'''Sheila Jeffreys''' (born 1948) is a [[lesbian feminism|lesbian feminist]] scholar and political activist, known for her analysis of the history and politics of [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] in [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. She is a professor in [[Political Science]] at the [[University of Melbourne]] in [[Australia]]. Jeffreys's argument that the &quot;[[sexual revolution]]&quot; on [[man|men]]'s terms contributed less to [[woman|women]]'s freedom than to their continued oppression has both commanded respect and attracted intense criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=SAMOIS |year=1987 |title=Coming to Power: Writings and Graphics on Lesbian S/M |publisher=Alyson Publications |location=Boston |isbn= 0-932870-28-7 |page= 88}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Carole S. |last=Vance |year=1992 |title=Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality |publisher=Pandora |location=London |isbn= 0-04-440867-6 |page= 302}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Harriett. |last=Gilbert |year=1993 |title=The Sexual Imagination from Acker to Zola: A Feminist Companion |publisher=Jonathan Cape |location=London |isbn= 0-224-03535-5 |page= 133}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Rene. |last=Denfeld |year=1995 |title=The New Victorians: A Young Woman's Challenge to the Old Feminist Order |publisher=Warner Books |location=New York |isbn= 1-86373-789-8 |page= 35}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeffreys argues that [[transsexualism|transsexuals]] reproduce oppressive [[gender roles]] and mutilate their bodies through [[sex reassignment surgery]]. Some of Jeffrey's other controversial positions are that [[lesbian]] culture has been negatively affected by emulating the [[sexism|sexist]] influence of the gay male subculture of dominant/submissive sexuality, and that women suffering [[pain]] in pursuit of [[beauty]] is a form of submission to [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] [[Sadistic personality disorder|sadism]].

==Discussion of her works==
In 1979, Jeffreys helped write ''Love Your Enemy? The Debate Between Heterosexual Feminism and Political Lesbianism'', a pamphlet that offered a definition of a political lesbian: &quot;We do think... that all feminists can and should be lesbians. Our definition of a political lesbian is a woman-identified woman who does not fuck men. It does not mean compulsory sexual activity with women.&quot;&lt;ref name = BINDEL2/&gt; Jeffreys was one of several contributors to ''The sexual dynamics of history: men's power, women's resistance'', an anthology of feminist writings about gender relations published in 1983 under the name &quot;London Feminist History Group.&quot; Jeffreys wrote the last of this book's eleven chapters, ''Sex reform and anti-feminism in the 1920s''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=London Feminist History Group |year=1983 |title=The Sexual Dynamics of History: Men's power, women's resistance |publisher=Pluto Press |location=London |isbn= 0-86104-711-7 |page= vi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffreys's best known historical work is ''The Spinster and Her Enemies: Feminism and Sexuality 1880-1930'', published in 1985. It challenges the view that the sexual [[Religious fanaticism|puritanism]] of [[Victorian England]] was displaced by the scientifically enlightened ideas of sexologists such as [[Sigmund Freud]] and [[Havelock Ellis]]. It examines late 19th century and early 20th century feminist campaigns against [[child abuse]] and [[prostitution]], identifying the [[New Woman]] vision espoused by spokesmen for [[sexology]] as a male [[backlash (sociology)|backlash]] strategy. Jeffreys argues that these concepts were [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] and interpreted women's sexuality to conform to men's preferences. She traces later adaptations of these concepts made to fit changing social conditions: the New Woman was modified to accommodate wartime [[natalism|pro-natalist]] imperatives, and the sexually [[Hedonism|hedonistic]] [[Flapper]] Girl was invented to move women out of traditional male roles assumed by default during the [[World War I]] period, which had allowed them greater independence in paid work at home and at the front.

In ''Anticlimax: A Feminist Perspective on the Sexual Revolution'', published in 1990, Jeffreys criticises popular prescriptions for women's sexuality from the 1950s on in key texts including [[pornography]], [[sex manuals]] and [[Statistical survey|surveys]], and best-selling [[novel]]s. Having spent most of her life in the United Kingdom, Jeffreys moved to Australia in the early 1990s.

''The Lesbian Heresy'' was published in 1993.&lt;ref name = HERESY&gt;{{Cite book |title= The Lesbian Heresy: A Feminist Perspective on the Lesbian Sexual Revolution | first= Sheila | last= Jeffreys | publisher= Spinifex Press | year= 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it Jeffreys is highly critical of [[BDSM|sadomasochistic]] practices that involved women.  One author involved in sadomasochism cites Jeffreys' views in this book as an example of the &quot;simplistic and dualistic thinking&quot; among anti-sadomasochism campaigners, when she describes sadomasochism as &quot;male supremacist&quot;, a reenactment of heterosexual male dominance and women's oppression, which glorifies violence and uses women's bodies as a sex aid, and as anti-lesbian and [[fascism|fascistic]].  The author points out that Jeffreys ignores that some heterosexual women may enjoy sex, and that 'tops' may be women who work hard to give their 'bottoms' pleasure, rather than the passive recipients of sex in the way she describes.&lt;ref name = STEIN&gt;{{Cite book | chapter= 'Without Contraries Is No Progression': S/M, Bi-nary Thinking, and the Lesbian Purity Test | first= Atara | last= Stein | editor-first= Dawn | editor-last=  Atkins | title= Lesbian Sex Scandals | publisher= Haworth Press | url= http://books.google.com/?id=seZp6LNoF60C&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=sheila+jeffreys+BDSM | page= 53 | publication-date= 1998 | isbn= 978-0-7890-0548-9 | date= 1998-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffreys' book ''The Political Economy of the Global Sex Trade: The Industrial Vagina'', was published in February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/dp/0415412331 The Political Economy of the Global Sex Trade &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/rn/breakfast/stories/2009/2498297.htm ABC Radion National Interview with Jefferys regarding her new book&lt;/ref&gt; It describes the globalisation of the sex industry, and includes a controversial description of marriage as a form of prostitution; in her article on Jeffreys, [[Julie Bindel]] quotes her: &quot;the right of men to women's bodies for sexual use has not gone but remains an assumption at the basis of heterosexual relationships&quot;, and explains that she draws out more obvious links between marriage and prostitution, such as mail-order brides, which she sees as a form of trafficking.&lt;ref name = BINDEL1&gt;{{Cite news | title= 'Marriage is a form of prostitution' | first= Julie | last= Bindel | newspaper= Guardian | date= 12 Nov 2008 | url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/lifeandstyle/2008/nov/12/women-prostitution-marriage-sex-trade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Views on transsexuality==
Jeffreys has received attention for her views on [[transgenderism (disambiguation)|transgender, transsexualism and gender reassignment]].  In interview, Bindel explains that Jeffreys argues that transsexual surgery &quot;is an extension of the beauty industry offering cosmetic solutions to deeper rooted problems&quot;, that in a society without gender this would be unnecessary.  She describes 'transgender' surgeries as 'mutilation', and [[forced feminization]] pornography as portraying a view of women as less powerful.&lt;ref name = BINDEL2&gt;{{Cite news | title= The ugly side of beauty | first= Julie | last= Bindel | newspaper= Guardian | date= 2 July 2005 | url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/jul/02/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety}}&lt;/ref&gt;
