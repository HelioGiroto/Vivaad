'''Tarja Kaarina Halonen''' ({{IPA-fi|tɑrjɑ kɑːrinɑ hɑlonen||Fi-Tarja_Halonen.ogg}}; born 24 December 1943) is a [[Finns|Finnish]] [[lawyer]] who was the 11th [[President of Finland]], serving from 2000 to 2012. The first female to hold the office, Halonen had previously been a [[Eduskunta|member of the parliament]] from 1979 to 2000 until her [[Finnish presidential election, 2000|election]] to the presidency. In addition to her political career, she had a long and extensive career in [[trade union]]s and different [[non-governmental organization]]s.

Halonen is a graduate of the [[University of Helsinki]], where she studied law from 1963 to 1968. She was active in student politics and served as the Social Affairs Secretary and Organization Secretary of the National Union of Students from 1969 to 1970. In 1971 she joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland|Social Democratic Party]] and worked as a lawyer in the [[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions]] until she was elected to parliament in 1979.

Halonen served in the parliament of Finland for six terms, from 1979 to 2000, representing the [[Helsinki (constituency)|constituency of Helsinki]]. She also had a long career in the [[Politics of Helsinki|city council of Helsinki]], serving there from 1977 to 1996. She started her campaign for the presidency at the beginning of 1999 after President [[Martti Ahtisaari]] announced that he would not stand for a second term in the office. She easily won her party's nomination, and eventually got 40% of the votes in the first round of the [[Finnish presidential election, 2000|presidential elections]], and 51.6% in the second, thus defeating the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party's]] [[Esko Aho]] and becoming the 11th president of Finland.

During the time of her presidency she has been extremely popular among Finns: her approval ratings rose and reached a peak of 88% in December 2003. Even though her ratings were so good, she was not re-elected in the first round in the next [[Finnish presidential election, 2006|presidential elections in 2006]]. She beat [[National Coalition Party]] candidate [[Sauli Niinistö]] in the second round by 51.8% against 48.2%. Ineligible to run in the [[Finnish presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential elections]] due to term limits, Halonen left office on 1 March 2012.

Halonen is widely known for her interest in human rights issues. In 1980&amp;ndash;81 Halonen served as the [[chairman]] of [[SETA (organization)|SETA]], the main [[LGBT]] rights organization in Finland. During her presidency, she has participated actively in discussion of women's rights and problems of globalization. In 2006, she was mentioned by many sources as a potential candidate for the [[United Nations Secretary-General selection, 2006|United Nations Secretary-General selection]], but later she stated that she wanted to finish her term as president before thinking about other career options. Halonen is a member of the [[Council of Women World Leaders]], an International network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers whose mission is to mobilize the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.
In 2009, [[Forbes]] named her among the 100 Most Powerful Women in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url = http://www.forbes.com/lists/2009/11/power-women-09_The-100-Most-Powerful-Women_Rank_3.html | title = The 100 Most Powerful Women | publisher = Forbes.com | date=19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
[[File:Tarja Halonen 1948.jpg|thumb|right|5-year-old Tarja Halonen in 1948.]]
Tarja Halonen was born on 24 December 1943 in the district of [[Kallio]] which is a traditional [[working-class]] area in central Helsinki. Her mother Lyyli Elina Loimola was a set-dresser and her father Vieno Olavi Halonen worked as a [[welder]]. Halonen's parents married each other at the beginning of World War II and Tarja was born a few years later. Vieno Halonen was at the frontline and Lyyli Halonen was working in a shoe factory when their daughter was born. After the war the couple decided to get a divorce, and in 1950 Lyyli Halonen married her new husband Thure Forss, who worked as an [[electrician]] and was very active in the working-class community.

Both Halonen's mother and her stepfather influenced her world view extensively. Halonen later said that her mother was a true survivor, always an extremely active and resilient person who valued good, honest and modest hardworking people. When she entered politics, Halonen stated that these are also the qualities and attributes she respects in people.

In 1950 she began her studies in Kallio [[Elementary school]] from where she later moved to Kallio [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]] and finally finished her matriculation examination in 1962. She began to study [[Art History]] in the [[University of Helsinki]] in 1962 but in autumn 1963 she changed her studies to law, and obtained her [[Master of Laws]] degree in 1968 specializing in [[criminal law]].

She began to work as a lawyer, already before obtaining her degree, in a credit surveillance company ''Luotonvalvonta oy'' in 1967. After working there for a few years, she was hired by the National Union of University Students in Finland to work as a Social Affairs and General Secretary from 1969 to 1970. Her work in the Union spurred her interest in politics, and in 1970 she obtained a post as a lawyer in the [[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions]], being the first female ever to work as a lawyer in the Union.

==Political career: 1970–2000==
=== Trade unionist ===

In 1971 she decided to join the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland]] which had close ties with the trade unions where she worked as a lawyer from 1970 to 1974.

In early 1970 she was elected to represent Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions in a committee that called for the recognition of the [[German Democratic Republic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ddr&quot;/&gt; Later she became the Vice-President of the committee, which lobbied then-President [[Urho Kekkonen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ddr&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070915061028/http://www.aamulehti.fi/teema/ddr/43981.shtml Halonen toimi DDR:n hyväksi luultua aktiivisemmin] archived on 15 September 2007 from [http://www.aamulehti.fi/teema/ddr/43981.shtml the original] [[Aamulehti]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HS92&quot;&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/arkisto/artikkeli/920712023 Helsingin Sanomat Magazine,  Doing work for GDR &quot;Itä-Saksan asialla&quot;, 12.7.1992]&lt;/ref&gt; During the presidential elections of 2006 she was criticized by rivals for this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ts.fi/sunnuntai/?ts=1,3:1012:0:0,4:12:0:1:2005-07-24,104:12:316124,1:0:0:0:0:0: DDR:n varjo vielä valaisematta]. Turun Sanomat&lt;/ref&gt; She responded that the committee was formed by members from many different political parties including conservative parties. In 1973 Finland recognized both the [[German Democratic Republic]] and the [[West Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Professor+says+allegations+of+President+Halonen%E2%80%99s+GDR+activism+are+untrue/1135230268074 Professor says allegations of President Halonen’s GDR activism are untrue] [[Helsingin Sanomat]], 13 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===First elections===
In 1974 [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]] [[Kalevi Sorsa]] appointed Halonen as his [[parliamentary secretary]]. She became acquainted with the world of Finnish politics and government and her political career took a great step forward, as she went on to hold a number of public offices. Sorsa later said that he wanted his parliamentary secretary to have good ties with the trade unions of Finland and have skills in [[jurisprudence]].

Working in the Parliament made Halonen even more interested in politics and she decided to take part in the municipal elections of 1976. She was elected to the [[Politics of Helsinki|Helsinki City Council]], a position she held continuously for five terms from 1977 to 1996. Additionally, in 1979 she was elected to the [[Parliament of Finland]] as a representative of the [[Helsinki (constituency)|Helsinki constituency]]. She served five full terms and less than a year of her sixth term in the parliament until her inauguration as President in 2000. In the Parliament her first formal post was as Chairman of the Social Committee from 1984 to 1987.

===Minister career===
In 1987, Halonen was appointed by Prime Minister [[Harri Holkeri]] to be the Minister of Social Affairs and Health in the government, a position she held until 1990. In addition to this, she served as Minister of [[Nordic Countries|Nordic]] Cooperation from 1989 until 1991, the same year in which she was also appointed chairman of the International Solidarity Foundation, a post she relinquished in 2000.

From 1990 to 1991 she served as Minister of Justice, and from 1995 until her election as President she served as the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the government of her Social Democratic colleague Prime Minister [[Paavo Lipponen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.valtioneuvosto.fi/hakemisto/ministerikortisto/ministeritiedot.asp?nro=464 |title=Ministerikortisto |publisher=Valtioneuvosto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2000 Presidential campaign==
{{Main|Finnish presidential election, 2000}}
Halonen announced in 1999 that she wished to stand as a candidate for President in the [[Finnish presidential election, 2000|2000 Presidential elections]]. In the preliminary elections of the Social Democrats Halonen ran against [[Pertti Paasio]], a member of the European Parliament and former party chairman, and [[Jacob Söderman]], the [[European Ombudsman]]. The incumbent, [[Martti Ahtisaari]], refused to run in party preliminaries and thus announced that he would not run for a second term. Halonen won the preliminaries by a landslide, getting 7800 of the total of 12,800 votes.

Halonen was a surprising candidate as she didn't represent many traditional values: She was known as a left-wing social democratic party member, who lived in a [[domestic partnership]], was a [[single parent]] and had resigned from the national church, the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]]. While Halonen started from fourth place in the presidential election polls, surprisingly in the first round of the elections she got the most votes, 40.0%. Her nearest opponent, the former [[Prime Minister of Finland|Prime Minister]] [[Esko Aho]] of the [[Centre Party (Finland)|Centre Party]], got 34.4%.

Since neither of the two candidates got over 50% of the votes, a second round was held as required by Finnish Law. In the second round, Halonen narrowly defeated her opponent with 51.6% against 48.4% thus becoming Finland's first [[List of women heads of state|female President]]. Her first term began on 1 March 2000.

==First term in office: 2000–2006==
[[File:Vladimir Putin 26 May 2002-10.jpg|thumb|With then President of Russia, [[Vladimir Putin]], in 2002.]]
After her narrow election victory in the first election, Halonen's approval ratings rose and reached a peak of 88% in December 2003.

In a 2001 Halonen said that she is worried about the Russian response if NATO approved membership bids by [[Baltic countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/arkisto.shtml/arkistot/kotimaa/2001/04/54353 Halonen: Baltian maiden liittyminen Natoon epäilyttää]. MTV3. 08.04.2001&lt;/ref&gt; Latvian President [[Vaira Vike-Freiberga]] asked what she meant and whether Halonen is actively opposing NATO membership of Baltic countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/arkisto.shtml/arkistot/kotimaa/2001/05/58431 Halosen Nato-lausunnoista kohu]. MTV3. 07.05.2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''Iraqgate'' scandal, Halonen's advisor Martti Manninen leaked confidential documents to the Centre Party leader [[Anneli Jäätteenmäki]], who had become Prime Minister. The revelations led to the resignation of Jäätteenmäki.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Book+on+Iraq+leak+scandal+Manninen+leaked+secret+documents+out+of+job+frustration/1076152898381 Book on Iraq leak scandal: Manninen leaked secret documents out of job frustration]&lt;/ref&gt;

Halonen has opposed the use of [[landmines]] in Finnish military doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Halonen+criticised+as+global+do-gooder+PM+Vanhanen+comes+to+President%E2%80%99s+defence/1076152567277 Halonen criticised as global do-gooder; PM Vanhanen comes to President’s defence]&lt;/ref&gt;

Halonen has defended [[cluster bomb]]s and did not sign a treaty which would have banned Finland from using these kinds of weapons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uusisuomi.fi/kotimaa/39742-halonen-kiistellysta-sopimuksesta-suomella-ei-ollut-mahdollisuuksia Halonen puolustaa rypälepommeja: ”Suomella ei ole mahdollisuuksia”]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2006 Presidential campaign==
{{Main|Finnish presidential election, 2006}}
On 20 May 2005, Halonen held a press conference in [[Mäntyniemi]] where she announced her willingness to run for a second term. Officially, this was the desired answer for the SDP delegation that had visited her two days earlier. In addition to her own party's support, the leader of the [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]], [[Suvi-Anne Siimes]], gave her support for Halonen's future campaign.

[[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions|SAK]] openly lobbied for her re-election. It used its members' money on [[mudslinging]] campaigns on behalf of Halonen. In those flyers, &quot;Niinistö is presented as the horror of worker, whereas SAK-supported Halonen is like a worker's dream&quot;. Halonen said she approved of the flyers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv3.fi/uutiset/arkisto.shtml/arkistot/kotimaa/2006/01/419943 Niinistö kiistää SAK:n syytökset]&lt;/ref&gt;

A study analyzed newspaper articles and concluded that the main newspaper Helsingin Sanomat produced almost exclusively positive tone stories about Halonen and much more negative tone articles about candidates Niinistö, Vanhanen and Hautala.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.city.fi/artikkeli/Halonen+Halonen+Halonen/1768/ Halonen, Halonen, Halonen - Onko presidentti valtamedian erityissuosiossa?]. City&lt;/ref&gt;

American talk show host [[Conan O'Brien]] made recurring jokes about Halonen on his show, ''[[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]]'', because of his own resemblance to her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lookalike&quot;/&gt;  He endorsed Halonen and produced humorous mock campaign ads and attack ads against her opponents.  He went as far as visiting Finland and meeting Halonen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lookalike&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-02-14-obrien-finland_x.htm|title=Conan O'Brien meets with Finnish leader|date=14 February 2006|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=27 August 2009|work=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 November, the SDP's party council meeting was held; praised as &quot;the president of the whole nation&quot;, she was unanimously chosen as the presidential candidate. Shortly thereafter, the party council of the Left Alliance gave the party's official support to Halonen.

Halonen's received 46% of the first round vote in the election. [[Sauli Niinistö]] (of the [[Kokoomus|''National Coalition Party'']]) was second with 24%. They faced each other in a runoff on 29 January 2006, where Halonen was re-elected with 51.8% of the vote against Mr. Niinistö's 48.2%. The re-election was a close call. She led in the advance voting, but she eventually received fewer votes on the actual voting day than Mr. Niinistö did.

==Second term in office: 2006–2012==
[[File:Dmitry Medvedev in Finland 21 July 2010-1.jpeg|thumb|Tarja Halonen (right) meeting with the third President of Russia [[Dmitry Medvedev]] and the then Prime Minister of Finland [[Mari Kiviniemi]] (left) in 2010.]]
In 2008, Halonen nominated SDP-affiliated Ritva Viljanen for a second term in the Interior Ministry. The Council of State had nominated Ilkka Laitinen, who was unambiguously seen as the most competent candidate. During the past 50 years, only once the President has not obeyed the Council of State consensus and Halonen was accused of cronyism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hs.fi/politiikka/artikkeli/Halonen+nimitti+Viljasen+sis%C3%A4ministeri%C3%B6n+kansliap%C3%A4%C3%A4llik%C3%B6ksi/1135238647679 Halonen nimitti Viljasen sisäministeriön kansliapäälliköksi]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iltasanomat.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/uutinen.asp?id=1570955 Presidentti Halonen nimitti Ritva Viljasen sisäministeriön kansliapäälliköksi]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2008, Halonen was perceived to insult Estonia by saying that the Estonians suffer from &quot;post-Soviet stress condition&quot;. Estonian President [[Toomas Hendrik Ilves]] commented on the issue, saying that &quot;Estonia has never condemned, and will not condemn foreign affairs decisions of another EU country. It neither will assess psychiatric state of other EU countries&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kauppalehti.fi/5/i/talous/uutiset/etusivu/uutinen.jsp?oid=2008/09/14334&amp;ext=rss Halonen suututti virolaiset]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ksml.fi/uutiset/kotimaa/yle-halosen-lausunto-kuohuttaa-virossa/219378 Yle: Halosen lausunto kuohuttaa Virossa]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Halonen rejected calls to apologize for Finland's attitude towards Estonian independence from the Soviet Union in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://suomenkuvalehti.fi/jutut/kotimaa/tarja-halonen-en-lampene-kollektiivisille-anteeksipyynnoille Tarja Halonen: ”En lämpene kollektiivisille anteeksipyynnöille”]. Suomen Kuvalehti&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of her second term Halonen's presidency and economic views received harsh criticism from [[Björn Wahlroos]], the chairman of the two largest banks in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Bj%C3%B6rn+Wahlroos+%E2%80%93+a+portrait+of+a+capitalist/1329103438342|title=Björn Wahlroos – a portrait of a capitalist|last=Ahtiainen|first=Ilkka|coauthors=Blåfield, Antti|date=12 February 2012|work=HS.fi International Edition|publisher=Sanoma|accessdate=19 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
[[File:LulaeHalonen.jpg|thumb|Halonen together with [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]], then [[President of Brazil]].]]
Early in her political career Halonen represented the far left wing of her former party (Social Democrat). She publicly opposed the proposed free trade agreement of the European Economic Community (EEC, later European Union) in 1973, by signing a petition along with 500 other more-or-less prominent social democrats and socialists. As an employee of the [[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions]], Halonen advocated diplomatic recognition of the [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]. Otherwise she was loyal{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} to President [[Urho Kekkonen|Kekkonen]]'s foreign policy, which was founded on Finnish neutrality and good relations with the [[Soviet Union]].

Throughout her political career, Halonen has described herself as supporter of international solidarity.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} She describes herself as a &quot;relative [[pacifism|pacifist]]&quot;, meaning that she doesn't support unilateral disarmament. She has strongly defended the President's role as the commander in chief of the military.&lt;ref&gt;Anna Perho (2005): [http://www.city.fi/artikkeli/Tarja+Halonen/1758/ ''Tarja Halonen - ensimmäinen nainen''] City-lehti 24/2005&lt;/ref&gt; She opposes [[NATO]] membership. Her strong stands on these issues have characterised her presidential term and shaped Finnish foreign policy, in part in cooperation with the like-minded former Minister for Foreign Affairs, [[Erkki Tuomioja]].

Halonen has publicly supported [[Central Organisation of Finnish Trade Unions|SAK]] involvement in politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wap.mobioutlet.com/uutiset/arkisto.shtml/arkistot/kotimaa/2006/01/421811 Halonen puolustaa SAK:n roolia vaaleissa ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Constitution of Finland and Halonen's decision to take part in some European Union meetings with the Prime Minister has created the so-called &quot;problem of two dinner plates&quot; in Finland. Since most other countries only have their Prime Ministers representing them, it was also decided in Finland that the task is reserved for the Prime Minister in most cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;oneortwo&quot;&gt;[http://www.valt.helsinki.fi/staff/tforsber/constitutionforeignpolicy.pdf One foreign policy or two?].

President Halonen says her interests include [[art history]], the theatre and [[human swimming|swimming]]. Halonen had two cats as of 2005. She says she speaks Finnish, Swedish, and English, and is studying [[Estonian language|Estonian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=

On 26 August 2000, President Halonen married her longtime partner, Dr. [[Pentti Arajärvi]], in a civil ceremony at her official residence, [[Mäntyniemi]], after a relationship of more than fifteen years. Halonen's adult daughter Anna, and Arajärvi's adult son Esko, acted as witnesses. {{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Both children are from previous relationships.

She promotes Finland in her personal accoutrements, such as wearing a [[Moomin]] watch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cord|first=David J.|title=[[Mohamed 2.0: Disruption Manifesto|Mohamed 2.0]]|year=2012|publisher=Schildts &amp; Söderströms|location=Helsingfors|isbn=978-951-52-2898-7|pages=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, she left the [[Church of Finland|Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland]], to which the majority of Finns belong, to protest against its policy of taxing church members and its stance against female [[priest]]s. Today, the church accepts women as priests and Halonen has stated that she has no personal reason not to return to the church but refrains from doing so in order not to give a signal that might be misinterpreted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.presidentti.fi/netcomm/news/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=46823 Interview of Halonen in ''Kotimaa'' 12 February 2005.] On the official webpage of the president. Retrieved 10 October 2007. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, Halonen acted as the chairman of ''Suomen setlementtiliitto'', a Christian social work organization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palkkatyolainen.fi/pt2000/p000404-h3.html Tarja Halosen setlementtiliike. Palkkatyöläinen 3/2000.] Retrieved 10 October 2007. {{fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1980&amp;ndash;1981 Halonen served as the [[chairman]] of [[SETA]] (Seksuaalinen Tasavertaisuus RY, ''Sexual Equality''), the main [[LGBT]] rights organization in Finland. When she became Minister for Justice in 1990, there were high hopes among [[SETA]] members that she would stand up for gay rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/~eisaksso/tarja.html Tarja Halonen &amp; SETA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, a widely publicised incident occurred when member of parliament [[Tony Halme]] referred to Tarja Halonen as a lesbian. In a radio interview, Halme referred to his background of growing up &quot;in the streets&quot; and said: &quot;We have a lesbian as president and me as parliamentarian. Everything seems possible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/gay/lesbian/news/ARTICLE.php?AID=3417 Windy City Times - European Recognition, Diana Tapes Shock, Finnish Pres called Lesbian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although Halme intended to refer to [[social mobility]] with his comment, it was interpreted as an insult by much of the media. Halonen herself made no comment. Halme later apologized saying he had been misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ranneliike.net/artikkelit.php?alue=tapaushalme&amp;juttu=erikoiset ranneliike.net:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to her authorized [[biography]] published in 2005, Halonen is critical of some unnamed members of the Finnish [[civil service]] for being gay or lesbian and not [[coming out]] and campaigning for [[sexual equality]]. She accused these [[The closet|closeted]] homosexuals of reaping the benefits of other people's work for sexual equality without contributing themselves.

==Controversy==
Rumors have circulated about Halonen insulting and bullying servants and other SDP members, who have anonymously described these alleged incidents.&lt;ref name=&quot;apiste&quot;&gt;A-piste TV1, 19 December 2005 klo 21, see also [http://www.vapaasana.net/node/209 Tarja Halonen: kiukutteleva, simputtava ja nöyryyttävä työpaikkakiusaaja vailla paineensietokykyä] and [http://www.vapaasana.net/node/208 Sietämätön ja pompotteleva Halonen - kauhuesimies]&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
A long-running joke, which stems from the recurring segment &quot;[[List of Late Night with Conan O'Brien sketches#Conan O'Brien Hates My Homeland|Conan O'Brien Hates My Homeland]]&quot;, is that American talk show host [[Conan O'Brien]] resembles Tarja Halonen. After joking about this for several months (which led to his endorsement of her campaign), O'Brien travelled to Finland, appearing on several television shows and meeting President Halonen. The trip was filmed and aired as a special.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=26 January 2010|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TRAVEL/01/26/conan.obrien.vacation/index.html?hpt=C2|title=5 places Conan should go on vacation|publisher=[[CNN]]|date=26 January 2010|author=Barish, Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt;
