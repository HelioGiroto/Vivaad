'''Jackie Mason''' (born June 9, 1931)&lt;ref name=cq&gt;{{cite web|title=Jackie Mason|url=http://comedy-quotes.com/jackie-mason/|publisher=Comedy-Quotes.com|accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ibdb&gt;{{cite web|title=Internet Broadway Database: Jackie Mason|url=http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=6564|publisher=The Broadway League|accessdate=9 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[United States|American]] [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]] and movie actor.

==Early life==
Born '''Yacov Moshe Maza''' in [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]], [[Wisconsin]], he grew up on the [[Lower East Side]] of [[Manhattan]], [[New York City]].

Mason graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from the [[City College of New York]]. At age 25, he was ordained a [[rabbi]] (as his three brothers, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather had been) in [[Latrobe, Pennsylvania|Latrobe]], [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dnt&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailynewstranscript.com/arts/x689528666/Frankie-Valli-Jackie-Mason-to-perform-in-Worcester |title=Frankie Valli, Jackie Mason to perform in Worcester |date=2008-09-20 |accessdate=2008-10-04 |author=Chris Bergeron |publisher=Daily News Transcript}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three years later he resigned to become a comedian.

==Comedy career==
Mason had several one-man comedy [[stage show]]s over the years. His first [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] show was called ''The World According to Me'', which was well-received. Later, he had a show at the [[John Golden Theatre]], called ''Politically Incorrect'', which ran into [[trademark]] problems because it was performed at the same time that [[Bill Maher]]'s [[TV show]] ''[[Politically Incorrect]]'' was on the air. Bill Maher brought a lawsuit against Mason's production, which was dismissed as 'frivolous.' To this day, Mason is able to use this show title, and it is one of his most successful road productions. Between these shows, Mason played the lead in a short-lived television show called ''[[Chicken Soup (TV series)|Chicken Soup]]'' alongside [[Lynn Redgrave]].

Mason made several appearances on [[The Ed Sullivan Show]] during the 1960s, including the first episode to feature the American television debut of [[The Beatles]]. Mason revealed during his appearance on the BBC show [[Desert Island Discs]] that at the time he didn't think much of the group when he saw them perform on the show, referring to them as &quot;four kids in search of a voice who needed haircuts&quot;

In 1992, Mason won an [[Emmy Award]] for his [[voice-over]] of Rabbi [[Hyman Krustofski]] in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode &quot;[[Like Father, Like Clown]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;simpsons-emmy&quot;&gt;Basile, Nancy. (2006) [http://animatedtv.about.com/cs/news/a/awards.htm The Simpsons Awards], About.com, Accessed 29 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; making him the first guest star to win an Emmy for his role. Mason has also appeared in ''The Simpsons'' episodes &quot;[[Today I Am A Clown]],&quot; &quot;[[Once Upon a Time in Springfield]],&quot; &quot;[[The Ten-Per-Cent Solution]],&quot; and &quot;[[At Long Last Leave]].&quot;

In a 2005 poll to find the Comedian's Comedian, Mason was voted among the top-50 comedy acts ever by fellow comedians and comedy insiders. He was also ranked #63 in [[Comedy Central]] Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0429332/ ''Comedy Central Presents: 100 Greatest Stand-Ups of All Time''] at the [[Internet Movie Database]]&lt;/ref&gt;

His full length motion picture ''[[One Angry Man (film)|One Angry Man]]'' has been released in 2010 throughout the US and Canada.

Mason's latest film &quot;Jackie Goldberg Private Dick&quot; was not released in theatres, but was a 'straight to video release', released by FilmWorks Entertainment. 

Mason was a comedian at the Fieldston Hotel in Swan Lake, NY in the summer of 1955. He was let go because his act was too far ahead of its time. The patrons had never been exposed to a comic who seemed to be ridiculing them. A few years later, Don Rickles came along, but by then audiences had become open to this type of humor.

==Personal life==
On August 14, 1991, Mason married Jyll Rosenfeld.

==Controversy==
[[Image:Jackie Mason @ Hanna.jpg|thumb|1968 ad for the Jackie Mason Show]]

===&quot;Middle finger&quot; incident===
On October 18, 1964 in an appearance on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', Mason allegedly gave host [[Ed Sullivan]] the [[Finger (gesture)|finger]] on air. Footage of the incident shows Mason doing his stand-up comedy act and then looking toward Sullivan, commenting that Sullivan was signaling him. Sullivan was reportedly letting Mason know (by pointing two fingers) that he had only a couple minutes left, as the program was about to cut away to show a speech by [[President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]. Mason began working his own fingers in his act to make fun of the situation, and pointed toward Sullivan with his middle finger slightly separated. Sullivan was clearly angered by this, and banned Mason from the show. Mason denied knowingly giving Sullivan the middle finger (he later claimed that he had never even heard of the middle finger gesture at that time). In retaliation, to protect the perceived threat to his career, Mason filed a libel suit at the [[New York Supreme Court]], which he won.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0838047/bio Ed Sullivan at IMDb.com]&lt;/ref&gt; He made a comeback appearance on the TV program two years later, and Sullivan publicly apologized to him. At that time, Mason opened his monologue by saying, &quot;It is a great thrill...and a fantastic opportunity to see me in person again.&quot; Mason would never appear on the show again.

===Use of the term schvartze===
In 1991, Mason was criticized by [[African-American]] organizations such as the [[NAACP]] when he called [[New York City|New York]] [[city|mayor]] [[David Dinkins]] &quot;a fancy ''[[Wiktionary:schvartze|schvartze]]'' with a [[moustache]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;multi1&quot;&gt;[http://www.metro.co.uk/metrolife/article.html?in_article_id=15186&amp;in_page_id=9 Metrolife: Jackie Mason] ''[[Metro International|Metro]]''. June 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; He later apologized.

Mason referred to [[Barack Obama]] as a &quot;schvartze&quot; during a performance in New York City on March 12, 2009.

===Statements on Palestinians===
Mason counseled [[Israel]]i leaders to consider the total expulsion of Palestinians from Israel, the [[West Bank]], and [[Gaza Strip]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eviction&quot;&gt;Mason, Jackie and Raoul Felder. &quot;Time to Threaten Arabs with Mass Eviction.&quot; ''[[The Jewish Press]]''. January 29, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Mason and [[Raoul Felder]] wrote, “We have paralyzed ourselves by our sickening fear of World Opinion, which is why we find it impossible to face one simple fact: We will never win this war unless we immediately threaten to drive every Arab out of Israel if the killing doesn't stop.”&lt;ref name=&quot;eviction&quot;/&gt; They added:
{{cquote|We are brain-dead if we accept the idea that we have to guess which Arab is our next killer. We are not obligated to victimize ourselves by letting the Arabs play [[Russian roulette]] with Jewish lives. Israelis are constantly asked the same obnoxious question: 'How can you throw the Arabs out? where would they go?' The answer is, if they don't care whom they kill, why are we obligated to care where they go?&lt;ref name=&quot;eviction&quot;/&gt;}}

==Jews for Jesus lawsuit==
On August 28, 2006, Mason filed a [[lawsuit]] against the group [[Jews for Jesus]] for using his likeness in a pamphlet.&lt;ref name=&quot;2006-lawsuit&quot;&gt;[http://msnbc.msn.com/id/14512457/ &quot;Oy! Jackie Mason sues Jews for Jesus.&quot;] MSNBC. August 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; His image was used next to the tag line &quot;Jackie Mason...a Jew for Jesus!?&quot; Mason said in court papers filed in New York:
{{cquote|While I have the utmost respect for people who practice the [[Christian]] [[religion|faith]], the fact is, as everyone knows, I am as Jewish as a [[Matzah ball]] or kosher [[salami]].}}
Mason has claimed that the group was using his image and fame to gain attention and converts. The group responded to the suit by saying, &quot;Shame on him for getting so upset about this.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;2006-lawsuit&quot;/&gt; The lawsuit was settled in 2006, with Jews for Jesus apologizing.&lt;ref name=&quot;2006-lawsuit-apology&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/12/05/nyregion/05mason.html |title=To Settle Suit, Jews for Jesus Apologizes to Jackie Mason |date=2006-12-06 |accessdate=2008-10-04 |author=Anemona Hartcollis |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==One Jerusalem==
In January 2001, Mason co-founded the organization [[One Jerusalem]] in response to the [[Oslo Accords|Oslo peace agreement]]. Its stated cause is &quot;Maintaining a united [[Jerusalem]] as the un-divided capital of Israel.”&lt;ref name=&quot;one-jerusalem&quot;&gt;[http://www.onejerusalem.org/about.php &quot;About Us.&quot;] One Jerusalem.&lt;/ref&gt;
