'''Idi Amin Dada''' (mid 1920s – 16 August 2003) was the military [[dictator]] and third President of [[Uganda]] from 1971 to 1979. Amin joined the [[British colony|British colonial]] regiment, the [[King's African Rifles]] in 1946, serving in [[Somalia]] and [[Kenya]]. Eventually, Amin held the rank of [[Major General]] in the post-colonial [[Ugandan Army]] and became its [[Commander]] before seizing power in the [[1971 Ugandan coup d'état|military coup of January 1971]], deposing [[Milton Obote]]. He later promoted himself to [[Field Marshal]] while he was the head of state.

Amin's rule was characterised by [[human rights]] abuse, [[political repression]], [[ethnic persecution]], [[extrajudicial killing]]s, [[nepotism]], [[Political corruption|corruption]], and gross economic mismanagement. The number of people killed as a result of his regime is estimated by international observers and human rights groups to range from 100,000&lt;ref name=&quot;Ullman1978&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ullman|first=Richard H.|title=Human Rights and Economic Power: The United States Versus Idi Amin|journal=[[Foreign Affairs (journal)|Foreign Affairs]]|date=April 1978|accessdate=26 March 2009|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/29141/richard-h-ullman/human-rights-and-economic-power-the-united-states-versus-idi-ami|quote=The most conservative estimates by informed observers hold that President Idi Amin Dada and the terror squads operating under his loose direction have killed 100,000 Ugandans in the seven years he has held power.}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 500,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian_obit&quot;/&gt; During his years in power, Amin shifted in allegiance from being a pro-Western ruler enjoying considerable Israeli support, to being backed by [[Libya]]'s [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]], the [[Soviet Union]] and [[East Germany]].&lt;ref name=libya1&gt;{{cite book|title=Africa since 1800|author=Roland Anthony Oliver, Anthony Atmore|page=272}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ussr1&gt;{{cite book|title=Who influenced whom?|author=Dale C.

Winrow: The foreign policy of the GDR in Africa, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975–1976, Amin became the Chairman of the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU), a [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanist]] group designed to promote solidarity of the African states.&lt;ref name=Byword&gt;{{cite news|url=http://web.archive.org/web/20080605070641/http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_1390595,00.html|title = Idi Amin: a byword for brutality|work=[[News24]]|accessdate =13 February 2012|date = 21 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1977–1979 period, Uganda was a member of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gershowitz |first=Suzanne |date=20 March 2007 |accessdate=8 August 2009 |url=http://www.ypfp.org/the_last_king_of_scotland_idi_amin_and_the_united_nations |title=The Last King of Scotland, Idi Amin, and the United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977, when Britain broke diplomatic relations with Uganda, Amin declared he had defeated the British and added &quot;CBE&quot;, for &quot;Conqueror of the British Empire&quot;, to his title. [[Radio Uganda]] then announced his entire title: &quot;His Excellency President for Life, Field Marshal Alhaji Dr. Idi Amin Dada, VC, DSO, MC, CBE&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian_obit&quot;/&gt;

Dissent within Uganda and Amin's attempt to [[annexation|annex]] the [[Kagera Region|Kagera]] province of [[Tanzania]] in 1978 led to the [[Uganda–Tanzania War]] and the demise of his eight-year regime – leading Amin to flee to exile first to [[Libya]], then to [[Saudi Arabia]] where he lived until his death on 16 August 2003.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Amin never wrote an autobiography nor did he authorise any official written account of his life, so there are discrepancies regarding when and where he was born. Most biographical sources hold that he was born in either Koboko or Kampala around 1925{{Ref label|Birthday|A|}}. Other unconfirmed sources state Amin's year of birth from as early as 1923 to as late as 1928. According to Fred Guweddeko, a researcher at [[Makerere University]], Idi Amin was the son of Andreas Nyabire (1889–1976). Nyabire, a member of the [[Kakwa people|Kakwa ethnic group]], converted from [[Roman Catholicism]] to [[Islam]] in 1910 and changed his name to Amin Dada. He named his first-born son after himself. Abandoned by his father at a young age, Idi Amin grew up with his mother's family in a rural farming town in northwestern Uganda. Guweddeko states that Amin's mother was called Assa Aatte (1904–1970), an ethnic [[Lugbara people|Lugbara]] and a traditional herbalist who treated members of [[Buganda]] royalty, among others. Amin joined an Islamic school in [[Bombo, Uganda|Bombo]] in 1941. After a few years, he left school with nothing more than a fourth grade English-language education and did odd jobs before being recruited to the army by a British colonial army officer.&lt;ref name=&quot;monitor_01012004&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/specialincludes/ugprsd/amin/articles/index.php |title=Rejected then taken in by dad; a timeline |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070612053237/http://www.monitor.co.ug/specialincludes/ugprsd/amin/articles/index.php |archivedate=12 June 2007 |last= Guweddeko |first=Fred |work=[[The Monitor (Uganda)|The Monitor]] |date=12 June 2007 |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonial British Army ===
Amin joined the [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR) of the [[History of the British Army|British Colonial Army]] in 1946 as an assistant cook.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9007180|title=Idi Amin|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070314142415rn_1/www.britannica.com/eb/article-9007180/Idi-Amin|archivedate=9 August 2009|publisher=''Encyclopædia Britannica''|date=19 December 2008|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed he was forced to join the Army during [[World War&amp;nbsp;II]], and that he served in the [[Burma Campaign]],&lt;ref name=portrait&gt;{{cite video|publisher = Le Figaro Films| title=General Idi Amin Dada: A Self Portrait|year=1974|ISBN=0-7800-2507-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; but records indicate he was first enlisted after the war was concluded.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian_obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Keatley|first=Patrick|title=Obituary: Idi Amin|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/aug/18/guardianobituaries|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=18 August 2003|accessdate=18 March 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.strategypage.com/on_point/20030820.aspx|title=Why Didn't Amin Rot and Die in Jail?|work=Strategy Page|last=Bay|first=Austin|date=20 August 2003|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was transferred to Kenya for infantry service as a [[Private (rank)|private]] in 1947 and served in the 21st KAR infantry battalion in [[Gilgil, Kenya]] until 1949. That year, his unit was deployed to Northern Kenya to fight against Somali rebels in the [[Shifta War]]. In 1952 his brigade was deployed against the [[Mau Mau]] rebels in Kenya. He was promoted to corporal the same year, then to sergeant in 1953.&lt;ref name=&quot;monitor_01012004&quot;/&gt;

In 1959 Amin was made ''[[Effendi|Afande]]'' ([[warrant officer]]), the highest rank possible for a [[Black people|Black African]] in the [[Colonial troops|colonial]] [[British Army]] of that time. Amin returned to Uganda the same year, and in 1961 he was promoted to [[lieutenant]], becoming one of the first two Ugandans to become [[Officer (armed forces)|commissioned officers]]. He was assigned to quell the cattle rustling between Uganda's [[Karamojong people|Karamojong]] and Kenya's [[Turkana people|Turkana]] [[nomad]]s. In 1962, following Uganda's independence from the [[United Kingdom]], Amin was promoted to [[captain (land)|captain]] and then, in 1963, to [[major]]. He was appointed Deputy Commander of the Army the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;monitor_01012004&quot;/&gt;

Amin was an athlete during his time in both the British and Ugandan army. At 193&amp;nbsp;cm (6&amp;nbsp;ft 4&amp;nbsp;in) tall and powerfully built, he was the Ugandan [[light heavyweight]] [[boxing]] champion from 1951 to 1960, as well as a swimmer. Idi Amin was also a formidable [[rugby union|rugby]] forward,&lt;ref name=Scotsman&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/idiamin/Idi-Amin.2453742.jp|title=Idi Amin|work=Scotsman|last=Bridgland|first=Fred|date=16 August 2003|accessdate=8 August 2009|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CainGrowden&quot;&gt;Cain, Nick and Growden, Greg &quot;Chapter 21: Ten Peculiar Facts about Rugby&quot; in ''Rugby Union for Dummies'' (2nd Edition), p294 (pub: John Wiley and Sons, [[Chichester]], England) ISBN 978-0-470-03537-5&lt;/ref&gt; although one officer said of him: &quot;Idi Amin is a splendid type and a good (rugby) player, but virtually bone from the neck up, and needs things explained in words of one letter&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CainGrowden&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Scotsman2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/idiamin/Death-of-a-despot-buffoon.2453405.jp|title=Death of a despot, buffoon and killer|work=Scotsman|last=Johnston|first=Ian|date=17 August 2003|accessdate=24 August 2009|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, he played for Nile RFC.&lt;ref name=RugbyDis&gt;Cotton, p111&lt;/ref&gt; There is a frequently repeated [[urban myth]]&lt;ref name=&quot;CainGrowden&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RugbyDis&quot; /&gt; that he was selected as a replacement by [[East Africa rugby union team|East Africa]] for their match against the [[1955 British Lions tour to South Africa|1955]] [[British and Irish Lions|British Lions]]. Amin, however, does not appear on the team photograph or on the official team list,&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, M. and Cohen, E.J. (1960) ''Rugby Football in East Africa 1909–1959''. Published by the Rugby Football Union of East Africa&lt;/ref&gt; and replacements were not allowed in international rugby until 13 years after this event is supposed to have taken place.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/laws.htm#Replacements Rugby history website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following conversations with a colleague in the British Army, Amin became a keen fan of [[Hayes F.C.|Hayes Football Club]] – an affection that would remain for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.eurosport.yahoo.com/blogs/world-of-sport/dictators-terrorists-xi-143023941.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Army commander ===
In 1965, [[Prime Minister of Uganda|Prime Minister]] [[Milton Obote]] and Amin were implicated in a deal to smuggle ivory and gold into Uganda from [[Zaire]]. The deal, as later alleged by General Nicholas Olenga, an associate of the former Congolese leader [[Patrice Lumumba]], was part of an arrangement to help troops opposed to the Congolese government trade ivory and gold for arms supplies secretly smuggled to them by Amin. In 1966, the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Ugandan Parliament]] demanded an investigation. Obote imposed a new constitution abolishing the ceremonial presidency held by [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]] (King) [[Edward Mutesa&amp;nbsp;II]] of [[Buganda]], and declared himself executive president. He promoted Amin to colonel and army commander. Amin led [[Battle of Mengo Hill|an attack]] on the Kabaka's palace and forced Mutesa into exile to the United Kingdom, where he remained until his death in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ugtoc.html#ug0159 |work=Federal Research Division|publisher=United States Library of Congress|title=Country Studies: Uganda: Independence: The Early Years|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bookrags&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/idi-amin-dada|work=Encyclopedia of World Biography|publisher=Thomson Gale|title=Idi Amin Dada Biography|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amin began recruiting members of [[Kakwa people|Kakwa]], [[Lugbara people|Lugbara]], [[Nubian people|Nubian]], and other ethnic groups from the [[West Nile sub-region|West Nile]] area bordering [[Sudan]]. The Nubians had been residents in Uganda since the early 20th century, having come from Sudan to serve the colonial army. Many African ethnic groups in northern Uganda inhabit both Uganda and Sudan; allegations persist that Amin's army consisted mainly of Sudanese soldiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anyanya&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kas.org.za/Publications/SeminarReports/PoliticsofIdentityandExclusion/nantulya.pdf#search=%22%22idi%20amin%22%20anyanya%22|title=''Exclusion, Identity and Armed Conflict: A Historical Survey of the Politics of Confrontation in Uganda with Specific Reference to the Independence Era''|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061004231023/http://www.kas.org.za/Publications/SeminarReports/PoliticsofIdentityandExclusion/nantulya.pdf|archivedate=4 October 2006|year=2001|last=Nantulya|first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Seizure of power===
Eventually, a rift developed between Amin and Obote, exacerbated by the support Amin had built within the army by recruiting from the West Nile region, his involvement in operations to support the [[First Sudanese Civil War|rebellion in southern Sudan]], and an attempt on Obote's life in 1969. In October 1970, Obote himself took control of the armed forces, reducing Amin from his months-old post of commander of all the armed forces to that of commander of the army.&lt;ref name=britishcouncil&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britishcouncil.org/learnenglish-central-history-amin.htm |title=General Idi Amin overthrows Ugandan government |publisher=British Council |date=2 February 1971 |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having learned that Obote was planning to arrest him for misappropriating army funds, Amin seized power in a [[1971 Ugandan coup d'état|military coup]] on 25 January 1971, while Obote was attending a [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] summit meeting in [[Singapore]]. Troops loyal to Amin sealed off [[Entebbe International Airport]], the main airport, and took Kampala. Soldiers surrounded Obote's residence and blocked major roads. A broadcast on [[Uganda Broadcasting Corporation|Radio Uganda]] accused Obote's government of corruption and preferential treatment of the [[Lango sub-region|Lango region]]. Cheering crowds were reported in the streets of Kampala after the radio broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/january/25/newsid_2506000/2506423.stm |title=On this day: 25 January 1971: Idi Amin ousts Ugandan president |work=BBC |accessdate=8 August 2009 | date=25 January 1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amin announced that he was a soldier, not a politician, and that the [[military government]] would remain only as a [[caretaker government|caretaker regime]] until new elections, which would be announced when the situation was normalised. He promised to release all [[political prisoner]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/theguardian/1971/jan/26/fromthearchive |title=Curfew in Uganda after military coup topples Obote |last=Fairhall |first=John |work=The Guardian |date=26 January 1971 |accessdate=8 August 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amin gave former king of [[Buganda]] and President, Sir [[Edward Mutesa]] (who had died in exile), a state funeral in April 1971, freed many political prisoners, and reiterated his promise to hold free and fair elections to return the country to [[democracy|democratic]] rule in the shortest period possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mbabaali |first=Jude |url=http://www.fes-tz.de/arusha-2005/docs/the-role-of-opposition-parties-in-a-democracy.uganda.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Role of Opposition Parties in a Democracy: The Experience of the Democratic Party of Uganda |date=August 2005 |journal=Regional Conference on Political Parties and Democratisation in East Africa |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidency===
{{Main|Uganda under Idi Amin}}

====Establishment of military rule====
On 2 February 1971, one week after the coup, Amin declared himself President of Uganda, [[Commander-in-Chief]] of the Armed Forces, Army [[Chief of staff (military)|Chief of Staff]], and Chief of Air Staff. He announced that he was suspending certain provisions of the [[Constitution of Uganda|Ugandan constitution]] and soon instituted an Advisory Defence Council composed of military officers with himself as the chairman. Amin placed [[military tribunal]]s above the system of [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]], appointed soldiers to top government posts and [[parastatal]] agencies, and informed the newly inducted civilian [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet ministers]] that they would be subject to [[Military courtesy|military discipline]].&lt;ref name=britishcouncil/&gt;&lt;ref name=LOC_Rule_Under_Amin&gt;{{cite web |work=Federal Research Division |publisher=United States Library of Congress |title=Country Studies: Uganda: Military Rule Under Amin |accessdate=8 August 2009 |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ugtoc.html#ug0159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amin renamed the presidential lodge in Kampala from Government House to &quot;The Command Post&quot;. He disbanded the General Service Unit (GSU), an intelligence agency created by the previous government, and replaced it with the State Research Bureau (SRB). SRB headquarters at the Kampala suburb of Nakasero became the scene of torture and executions over the next few years.&lt;ref name=LOC_Security&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/ugtoc.html#ug0159 |work=Federal Research Division |publisher=United States Library of Congress |title=Country Studies: Uganda: Post-Independence Security Services |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other agencies used to persecute dissenters included the [[military police]] and the Public Safety Unit (PSU).&lt;ref name=LOC_Security/&gt;

Obote took refuge in Tanzania, having been offered sanctuary there by the Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]]. Obote was soon joined by 20,000 Ugandan refugees fleeing Amin.

====Persecution of ethnic and other groups====
Amin retaliated against the attempted invasion by Ugandan exiles in 1972 by purging the army of Obote supporters, predominantly those from the [[Acholi]] and [[Langi people|Lango]] ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=TallJstor&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tall |first=Mamadou |year=1982 |month=Spring–Summer |title=Notes on the Civil and Political Strife in Uganda |journal=A Journal of Opinion |volume=12 |issue=1/2 |pages=41–44 |id=  |doi=10.2307/1166537 |publisher=Issue: A Journal of Opinion, Vol. 12, No. 1/2|jstor=1166537}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1971, Lango and Acholi soldiers were massacred in the [[Jinja, Uganda|Jinja]] and [[Mbarara]] [[Barracks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lautze |first=Sue |url=http://www.livesandlivelihoods.com/files/25826548.pdf |title=Research on Violent Institutions in Unstable Environments: The livelihoods systems of Ugandan army soldiers and their families in a war zone |location=Hertford College, Oxford University}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by early 1972, some 5,000 Acholi and Lango soldiers, and at least twice as many civilians, had disappeared.&lt;ref name=telegraph_obituary&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/08/18/db1801.xml&amp;page=1 |title=Obituary: Idi Amin |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071012134036rn_1/www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2003/08/18/db1801.xml&amp;page=1 |archivedate=9 August 2009 |work=Daily Telegraph |date=17 September 2003 |location=London |first=Charles |last=Moore}}&lt;/ref&gt; The victims soon came to include members of other [[ethnic groups]], religious leaders, journalists, artists, senior bureaucrats, judges, lawyers, students and intellectuals, criminal suspects, and foreign nationals. In this atmosphere of violence, many other people were killed for criminal motives or simply at will. Bodies were often dumped into the Nile River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.amnesty.org/aidoc/aidoc_pdf.nsf/d45725da5fa95f1f80256a2b00642199/cde8ef35a67e99e3802569a70019299e/$FILE/a3307593.pdf |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080309153107/http://web.amnesty.org/aidoc/aidoc_pdf.nsf/d45725da5fa95f1f80256a2b00642199/cde8ef35a67e99e3802569a70019299e/$FILE/a3307593.pdf |archivedate=9 August 2009 |title=Disappearances and Political Killings: Human Rights Crisis of the 1990s: A Manual for Action |publisher=Amnesty International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The killings, motivated by ethnic, political, and financial factors, continued throughout Amin's eight-year reign.&lt;ref name=telegraph_obituary/&gt; The exact number of people killed is unknown. The [[International Commission of Jurists]] estimated the death toll at no fewer than 80,000 and more likely around 300,000. An estimate compiled by exile organizations with the help of [[Amnesty International]] puts the number killed at 500,000.&lt;ref name=guardian_obit/&gt; Among the most prominent people killed were [[Benedicto Kiwanuka]], the former [[Prime Minister of Uganda|prime minister]] and [[chief justice]]; [[Janani Luwum]], the [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] [[archbishop]]; [[Joseph Mubiru]], the former governor of [[Bank of Uganda|the Central Bank]]; Frank Kalimuzo, the vice chancellor of [[Makerere University]]; Byron Kawadwa, a prominent playwright; and two of Amin's own cabinet ministers, [[Erinayo Wilson Oryema]] and [[Charles Oboth Ofumbi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/specialincludes/ugprsd/amin/articles/amin6.php |title=Special report: Who were Amin's victims? |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070613161724/http://www.monitor.co.ug/specialincludes/ugprsd/amin/articles/amin6.php |archivedate=13 June 2007 |work=The Daily Monitor |date=13 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1972, Amin declared what he called an &quot;economic war&quot;, a set of policies that included the expropriation of properties owned by Asians and Europeans. Uganda's 80,000 Asians were mostly from the [[Indian subcontinent]] and born in the country, their ancestors having come to Uganda when the country was still a British colony.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2007-04-15/india/27882308_1_devang-raval-museveni-indians | work=The Times Of India | title=Idi Amin had targeted Indians in 70s | date=15 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many owned businesses, including large-scale enterprises, which formed the backbone of the Ugandan economy. On 4 August 1972, Amin issued a decree ordering the [[expulsion of Indians in Uganda in 1972|expulsion of the 60,000 Asians who were not Ugandan citizens]] (most of them held [[British passport]]s). This was later amended to include all 80,000 Asians, except for professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, and teachers. A plurality of the Asians with British passports, around 30,000, emigrated to the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. Others went to Australia, Canada, India, [[Kenya]], [[Pakistan]], Sweden, [[Tanzania]], and the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Amin's Economic War Left Uganda on Crutches |last=Luganda |first=Patrick |work=New Vision |location=Kampala |date=29 July 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/7/newsid_2492000/2492333.stm |title=On this day: 7 August 1972: Asians given 90 days to leave Uganda |publisher=BBC |accessdate=8 August 2009 | date=7 August 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,906327,00.html |title=Flight of the Asians |work=Time |date=11 September 1972 |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amin expropriated businesses and properties belonging to the Asians and handed them over to his supporters. The businesses were mismanaged, and industries collapsed from lack of maintenance. This proved disastrous for the already declining economy.&lt;ref name=LOC_Rule_Under_Amin/&gt;

In 1977, [[Henry Kyemba]], Amin's health minister and a former official of the first Obote regime, [[defection|defected]] and resettled in the UK. Kyemba wrote and published ''A State of Blood'', the first insider exposé of Amin's rule.

====International relations====
{{See also|Foreign relations of Uganda}}

Following the expulsion of Ugandan Asians in 1972, most of whom were of Indian descent, India severed [[diplomatic relations]] with Uganda. The same year, as part of his &quot;economic war&quot;, Amin broke diplomatic ties with the UK and [[nationalization|nationalised]] eighty-five British-owned businesses.

That year, relations with Israel soured. Although Israel had previously supplied Uganda with arms, in 1972 Amin expelled [[Israel]]i military advisers and turned to [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]] of [[Libya]] and the [[Soviet Union]] for support.&lt;ref name=TallJstor/&gt; Amin became an outspoken critic of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Jamison, M. Idi Amin and Uganda: An Annotated Bibliography, Greenwood Press, 1992, pp.155–6&lt;/ref&gt; In return, Gaddafi gave financial aid to Amin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Idi Amin speaks: an annotated selection of his speeches|author=Idi Amin, Benoni Turyahikayo-Rugyema|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1974 French-produced documentary film ''[[General Idi Amin Dada: A Self Portrait]]'', Amin discussed his plans for war against Israel, using paratroops, bombers and suicide squadrons.&lt;ref name=portrait /&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]] became Amin's largest arms supplier.&lt;ref name=ussr1 /&gt; [[East Germany]] was involved in the General Service Unit and the State Research Bureau, the two agencies which were most notorious for terror. Later during the Ugandan invasion of Tanzania in 1979, East Germany attempted to remove evidence of its involvement with these agencies.&lt;ref name=gdr1 /&gt;

In 1973, U.S. Ambassador [[Thomas Patrick Melady]] recommended that the United States reduce its presence in Uganda. Melady described Amin's regime as &quot;[[racism|racist]], erratic and unpredictable, brutal, inept, bellicose, irrational, ridiculous, and [[militarism|militaristic]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://history.state.gov/historicaldocuments/frus1969-76ve06/d240 |title=240.

In June 1976, Amin allowed an [[Air France]] airliner hijacked by two members of the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - External Operations]] (PFLP-EO) and two members of the German [[Revolutionary Cells (RZ)|Revolutionäre Zellen]] to land at [[Entebbe International Airport|Entebbe Airport]]. There the hijackers were joined by three more. Soon after, 156 non-Jewish hostages who did not hold Israeli passports were released and flown to safety, while 83 Jews and Israeli citizens, as well as 20 others who refused to abandon them (among whom were the captain and crew of the hijacked [[Air France]] jet), continued to be held hostage. In the subsequent Israeli rescue operation, codenamed Operation Thunderbolt (popularly known as [[Operation Entebbe]]), on the night of 3–4 July 1976, a group of Israeli commandos were flown in all the way from Israel and seized control of Entebbe Airport, freeing nearly all the hostages. Three hostages died during the operation and 10 were wounded; seven hijackers, about 45 Ugandan soldiers, and one Israeli soldier, [[Yoni Netanyahu]], were killed. A fourth hostage, 75-year-old Dora Bloch, an elderly Jewish Englishwoman who had been taken to [[Mulago Hospital]] in [[Kampala]] before the rescue operation, was subsequently murdered in reprisal. The incident further soured Uganda's international relations, leading the United Kingdom to close its [[High Commissioner|High Commission]] in Uganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/7/newsid_2496000/2496095.stm|title=On this day: 7 July 1976: British grandmother missing in Uganda|publisher=BBC|accessdate=8 August 2009|date=7 July 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uganda under Amin embarked on a large military build-up, which raised concerns in [[Kenya]]. Early in June 1975, Kenyan officials impounded a large convoy of [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-made arms ''en route'' to Uganda at the port of [[Mombasa]]. Tension between Uganda and Kenya reached its climax in February 1976 when Amin announced that he would investigate the possibility that parts of [[southern Sudan]] and western and central Kenya, up to within {{convert|32|km|mi}} of [[Nairobi]], were historically a part of colonial Uganda. The [[Politics of Kenya|Kenyan Government]] responded with a stern statement that Kenya would not part with &quot;a single inch of territory&quot;. Amin backed down after the Kenyan army deployed troops and [[armored personnel carrier]]s along the Kenya–Uganda border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationaudio.com/News/DailyNation/17082003/News/Amin_News170820039.html|title='Dada' always rubbed Kenya the wrong way|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080206065709/http://www.nationaudio.com/News/DailyNation/17082003/News/Amin_News170820039.html|archivedate=6 February 2008|work=Sunday Nation|date=17 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deposition and exile===
{{See also|Uganda–Tanzania War}}
By 1978, the number of Amin's supporters and close associates had shrunk significantly, and he faced increasing dissent from the populace within Uganda as the economy and infrastructure collapsed from years of neglect and abuse. After the killings of Bishop Luwum and ministers Oryema and Oboth Ofumbi in 1977, several of Amin's ministers defected or fled into exile.&lt;ref name=bishop&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ugandaobserver.com/new/archives/2006arch/features/spec/feb/spec200602161.php |title=Not even an archbishop was spared |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071012152659/http://ugandaobserver.com/new/archives/2006arch/features/spec/feb/spec200602161.php |archivedate=12 October 2007 |work=The Weekly Observer |date=16 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1978, after Amin's vice president, General [[Mustafa Adrisi]], was injured in a car accident, troops loyal to him [[mutiny|mutinied]]. Amin sent troops against the mutineers, some of whom had fled across the Tanzanian border.&lt;ref name=LOC_Rule_Under_Amin/&gt; Amin accused Tanzanian President [[Julius Nyerere]] of waging war against Uganda, ordered the invasion of [[Tanzania]]n territory, and formally [[annexation|annexed]] a section of the [[Kagera Region]] across the boundary.&lt;ref name=LOC_Rule_Under_Amin/&gt;&lt;ref name=invasion/&gt;

In January 1979, Nyerere mobilised the [[Tanzania People's Defence Force]] and counterattacked, joined by several groups of Ugandan exiles who had united as the [[Uganda National Liberation Army]] (UNLA). Amin's army retreated steadily, and, despite military help from [[Libya]]'s [[Muammar al-Gaddafi]], he was forced to flee into exile by helicopter on 11 April 1979, when [[The liberation of Kampala|Kampala was captured]]. He escaped first to Libya, where he stayed until 1980, and ultimately settled in [[Saudi Arabia]], where the [[Saudi royal family]] allowed him sanctuary and paid him a generous subsidy in return for his staying out of politics.&lt;ref name=britannica/&gt; Amin lived for a number of years on the top two floors of the [[Novotel|Novotel Hotel]] on Palestine Road in Jeddah.  [[Brian Barron]], who covered the Uganda–Tanzania war for the BBC as chief Africa correspondent, together with cameraman [[Mohamed Amin]] of Visnews in [[Nairobi]], located Amin in 1980 and secured the first interview with him since his deposition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3156011.stm|title=The Idi Amin I knew|author=Barron, Brian|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=16 August 2003|accessdate=16 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During interviews he gave during his exile in Saudi Arabia, Amin held that Uganda needed him and never expressed [[remorse]] for the nature of his regime.&lt;ref name=remorse&gt;{{cite news |title=Amin's death brings muted reaction |work=Associated Press |last=Wasswa |first=Henry |date=17 August 2003 |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, he attempted to return to Uganda, apparently to lead an armed group organised by Colonel [[Juma Oris]]. He reached [[Kinshasa]], [[Zaire]] (now the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]), before Zairian President [[Mobutu]] forced him to return to Saudi Arabia.

===Death===
On 20 July 2003, one of Amin's wives, Madina, reported that he was in a [[coma]] and near death at [[King Faisal Specialist Hospital]] in [[Jeddah]], [[Saudi Arabia]], from kidney failure. She pleaded with the Ugandan President, [[Yoweri Museveni]], to allow him to return to Uganda for the remainder of his life. Museveni replied that Amin would have to &quot;answer for his sins the moment he was brought back&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3093613.stm |title=Idi Amin back in media spotlight |work=BBC |date=25 July 2003 |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amin died at the hospital in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, on 16 August 2003 and was buried in Ruwais Cemetery in Jeddah.&lt;ref name=&quot;APobit_attendancequote&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Idi Amin, ex-dictator of Uganda, dies |date=16 August 2003 |work=[[USA Today]] |url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2003-08-16-amin-obit_x.htm |quote=Amin was buried in Jiddah's Ruwais cemetery after sunset prayers Saturday, said a person close to the family in the Red Sea port city.

==Family and associates==
A [[polygamy|polygamist]], Idi Amin married at least five women, three of whom he [[divorce]]d. He married his first and second wives, Malyamu and Kay, in 1966. The next year, he married Nora and then married Nalongo Madina in 1972. On 26 March 1974, he announced on Radio Uganda that he had divorced Malyamu, Nora and Kay.&lt;ref name=life_and_loves&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nationaudio.com/News/DailyNation/20082003/News/News122.html |title=Reign of Terror: The life and loves of a tyrant |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080206070718/http://www.nationaudio.com/News/DailyNation/20082003/News/News122.html |archivedate=6 February 2008 |work=Daily Nation |date=20 August 2003 |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/specialincludes/ugprsd/amin/articles/amin8.php |title=Special Report: Big Daddy and his women |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070618171054/http://www.monitor.co.ug/specialincludes/ugprsd/amin/articles/amin8.php |archivedate=18 June 2007 |work=The Monitor |date=18 June 2007 |last=Kavuma |first=Richard |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malyamu was arrested in [[Tororo]] on the Kenyan border in April 1974 and accused of attempting to smuggle a bolt of fabric into Kenya.

In August 1975, during the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU) summit meeting in Kampala, Amin married Sarah Kyolaba. Sarah's boyfriend, whom she had been living with before she met Amin, vanished and was never heard from again. By 1993, Amin was living with the last nine of his children and a single wife, Mama a Chumaru, the mother of the youngest four of his children. His last known child, daughter Iman, was born in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2007/aug/04/ukcrime.gilesfoden | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Not quite a chip off the old block | first=Giles | last=Foden | date=4 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The Monitor'', Amin married a few months before his death in 2003.&lt;ref name=Amin_is_dead/&gt;

==Erratic behaviour, self-bestowed titles, and media portrayal==
[[File:Idi Amin caricature2.jpg|right|thumb|A 1977 caricature of Amin in military and presidential attire by [[Edmund S. Valtman]]]]

As the years progressed, Amin's behaviour became more erratic, unpredictable, and outspoken. After the United Kingdom broke off all diplomatic relations with his regime in 1977, Amin declared he had defeated the British and conferred on himself the decoration of CBE (Conqueror of the British Empire). His full self-bestowed title ultimately became: &quot;His Excellency, President for Life, Field Marshal Al Hadji Doctor{{Ref label|Doctorate|B|}} Idi Amin Dada, VC, DSO, MC, Lord of All the Beasts of the Earth and Fishes of the Seas and Conqueror of the British Empire in Africa in General and Uganda in Particular&quot;, in addition to his officially stated claim of being the [[Pretender|uncrowned]] King of Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Appiah|first=Anthony|title=Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience|year=1999|coauthors=Henry Louis Gates}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was not a recipient of a [[Distinguished Service Order]] (DSO) or a [[Military Cross]] (MC). He conferred a [[Juris Doctor|doctorate of law]] on himself from [[Makerere University]],&lt;ref name=Byword/&gt; and the Victorious Cross (VC) was a medal made to emulate the British [[Victoria Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, Lorna (2007) p.239&lt;/ref&gt;

Amin became the subject of rumours and myths, including a widespread belief that he was a cannibal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Idi Amin's Exile Dream |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/08/21/opinion/idi-amin-s-exile-dream.html |last=Orizio |first=Riccardo |work=New York Times |date=21 August 2003 |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=Museveni, munificent with monarch |url=http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/PrinterFriendly.cfm?story_id=10216508 |work=[[The Economist]] |date=29 November 2007 |accessdate=27 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the unsubstantiated rumours, such as the mutilation of one of his wives, were spread and popularised by the 1980 film ''[[Rise and Fall of Idi Amin]]'' and alluded to in the film ''[[The Last King of Scotland (film)|The Last King of Scotland]]'' in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.monitor.co.ug/specialincludes/ugprsd/amin/articles/amin9.php |title=Special Report: The myths surrounding Idi Amin |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070528211152/http://www.monitor.co.ug/specialincludes/ugprsd/amin/articles/amin9.php |archivedate=28 May 2007 |date=28 May 2007 |last=Serugo |first=Moses |work=The Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Amin's time in power, popular media outside of Uganda often portrayed him as an essentially comic and eccentric figure. In a 1977 assessment typical of the time, a ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine article described him as a &quot;killer and clown, big-hearted buffoon and strutting [[martinet]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,918762-1,00.html |title=Amin:The Wild Man of Africa |work=Time |date=28 February 1977 |accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foreign media was often criticised by Ugandan exiles and defectors for focusing on Amin's excessive tastes and self-aggrandizing eccentricities, and downplaying or excusing his murderous behavior.&lt;ref name=Kibazo1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2007/jan/13/comment.uganda |title=A Brute, Not a Buffoon |last=Kibazo |first=Joel |work=The Guardian |date=13 January 2007 |quote=...

==Notes==
*A&amp;nbsp;{{note|Birthday}}Many sources, like Encyclopædia Britannica, Encarta and the Columbia Encyclopedia, hold that Amin was born in Koboko or Kampala c. 1925, and that the exact date of his birth is unknown. Researcher Fred Guweddeko claimed that Amin was born on 17 May 1928,&lt;ref name=&quot;monitor_01012004&quot;/&gt; but that is disputed.&lt;ref name=okadameri&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mail-archive.com/ugandanet@kym.net/msg06472.html |title=Separate fact from fiction in Amin stories|work=Originally published in ''The Monitor'' |last=O'Kadameri |first=Billie |date=1 September 2003 |accessdate=8 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only certainty is that Amin was born some time during the mid-1920s.
*B&amp;nbsp;{{note|Children}}According to Henry Kyema and the African Studies Review,&lt;ref&gt;African Studies Review (1982) p.63&lt;/ref&gt; Idi Amin had 34 children. Some sources say Amin claimed to have fathered 32 children. A report in ''[[The Monitor (Uganda)|The Monitor]]'' says he was survived by 45 children,&lt;ref name=Amin_is_dead/&gt; while another in the BBC gives the figure of 54.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/3179085.stm |title=Amins row over inheritance |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=9 August 2009 | date=25 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;
