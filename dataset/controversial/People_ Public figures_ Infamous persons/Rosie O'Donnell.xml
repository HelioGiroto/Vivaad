She has also been a magazine editor and continues to be a celebrity blogger, [[LGBT social movements|LGBT rights]] activist, television producer and collaborative partner in the LGBT family vacation company [[R Family Vacations]].

O'Donnell started her comedy career while still a teenager and her big break was on the talent show ''[[Star Search]]'' in 1984. A TV sitcom and a series of movies introduced her to a larger national audience and in 1996 she started hosting ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]'' which won multiple Emmy awards.

During her years on ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show'', she wrote her first book, a [[memoir]] called ''[[Find Me (book)|Find Me]]'' and developed the nickname &quot;Queen Of Nice&quot; as well as a reputation for philanthropic efforts. She used the book's $3 million advance to establish her own [[For All Kids]] foundation and promoted other charity projects encouraging other celebrities on her show to also take part. O'Donnell [[coming out|came out]], stating &quot;I'm a [[dyke (slang)|dyke]]!&quot; two months before finishing her talk show run, saying that her primary reason was to bring attention to [[LGBT adoption in the United States|gay adoption]] issues.&lt;ref name = &quot;USAtoday-coy Rosie&quot;/&gt; O'Donnell is a [[foster care|foster]]—and [[adoption|adoptive]]—mother. Since coming out, she has continued to support many [[LGBT]] causes and issues.

In 2006, O'Donnell became a moderator on ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]''. O'Donnell's strong opinions resulted in several notable controversies including an on-air dispute regarding [[Presidency of George W. Bush|the Bush administration]]'s policies with the [[Iraq War]], resulting in a mutual agreement to cancel her contract. In 2007, O'Donnell released her second memoir, ''[[Celebrity Detox]]'', which focuses on her struggles with fame and her time at ''The View''. She continues to do charity work and remains involved with LGBT and family-related issues. 

From 2009 to 2011, O'Donnell hosted  ''Rosie Radio'' on [[Sirius XM Radio]]. In 2011, O'Donnell signed on with the [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network]] to return to daytime TV with ''[[The Rosie Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Friedman |url= http://www.showbiz411.com/2010/09/21/rosie-odonnell-producing-chaz-bono-film-for-oprah-network |title= Rosie O’Donnell Producing Chaz Bono Film for Oprah Network|accessdate=September 21, 2010|date=September 21, 2010|work=[[Showbiz 411]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The OWN Network cancelled the show due to low ratings on March 16, 2012, and the last show aired on March 29, 2012.

== Early life ==
O'Donnell, the third of five children, was born and raised in [[Commack, New York|Commack, Long Island, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rosie O'Donnell | publisher=[[People (magazine)|People.com]] | url= http://www.people.com/people/rosie_odonnell/0,,,00.html|accessdate=April 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=filmreference /&gt; She is the daughter of Roseann Teresa (née Murtha), a homemaker, and Edward Joseph O'Donnell, an electrical engineer who worked in the defense industry.&lt;ref name=filmreference&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/30/Rosie-O-Donnell.html Rosie O'Donnell Biography (1962–)]&lt;/ref&gt; O'Donnell's father had immigrated from [[County Donegal]], Ireland during his childhood, and her mother was Irish American; O'Donnell was raised Catholic.&lt;ref name=&quot;bookbiography&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Parish|first=James Robert|authorlink=|coauthors=| title=Rosie: The Rosie O'Donnell Story|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf|year=1998|location=|page=12|month=January |url= http://www.amazon.com/Rosie-ODonnell-James-Robert-Parish/dp/0786705426/ref=si3_rdr_bb_product|isbn=0-7867-0542-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;&gt;Stated in interview on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Four days before her 11th birthday, on March 17, 1973, O'Donnell's mother died of breast cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;biography.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9542144 Rosie O'Donnell Biography], ''Biography.com''&lt;/ref&gt; While she attended [[Commack School District|Commack High School]], O'Donnell was voted homecoming queen, prom queen, senior class president and class clown.&lt;ref name=&quot;people.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/rosie_odonnell Rosie O'Donnell; People.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It was during high school that she began exploring her interest in comedy, beginning with a skit performed in front of the school in which she imitated [[Gilda Radner]]'s character [[Roseanne Rosannadanna]].&lt;ref name=&quot;biography.com&quot; /&gt; After graduating in 1980, O'Donnell briefly attended [[Dickinson College]], later transferring to [[Boston University]], before ultimately dropping out of college.&lt;ref name=&quot;people.com&quot;/&gt;

== Career ==

=== Early work ===
O'Donnell toured as a stand-up comedian in clubs from 1979 to 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eonline.com/celebrities/profile/index.jsp?uuid=c967a0ca-63f1-4edb-b3c6-ec4bdbbc0c4a Rosie O'Donnell profile], ''E! Online''&lt;/ref&gt;  She got her first big break on ''[[Star Search]]'', explaining on ''[[Larry King Live]]'':&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0203/16/lklw.00.html &quot;Highlights of Interviews With Rosie O'Donnell&quot;], ''CNN Larry King Weekend'', March 16, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I was 20 years old, and I was at a comedy club in [[Long Island]]. This woman came over to me and she said, I think you're funny. Can you give me your number? My dad is [[Ed McMahon]]. I was like, yeah, right. I gave her my father's phone number. I was living at home, I'm like, whatever. And about three days later, the talent booker from ''Star Search'' called and said, we're going to fly you out to L.A. [...] I won, like, five weeks in a row. And it gave me national exposure.}}
[[Image:RosieODonnell.jpg|thumb|left|O'Donnell at the 1992 [[Emmy Awards]]]]

After this success, she moved on to television sitcoms, making her series debut as [[Nell Carter]]'s neighbor on ''[[Gimme a Break!]]'' in 1986. In 1988, she joined music video station [[VH1]]'s lineup of [[VJ (media personality)|veejays]]. She started hosting a series for VH1, ''[[Stand-up Spotlight]]'', a showcase for up-and-coming comedians. In 1992 she starred in ''[[Stand By Your Man (TV Series)|Stand By Your Man]]'', a [[Fox Network]] sitcom co-starring [[Melissa Gilbert]]. The show bombed, just as O'Donnell's movie career took off. O'Donnell made her feature film debut in ''[[A League Of Their Own]]'' alongside [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].&lt;ref name=&quot;actors&quot;/&gt; Throughout her career, she has taken on an eclectic range of roles: she appeared in ''[[Sleepless in Seattle]]'' as [[Meg Ryan]]'s best friend; as [[Betty Rubble]] in the live-action film adaptation of [[The Flintstones (film)|The Flintstones]] with [[John Goodman]]; as one of [[Timothy Hutton]]'s co-stars in ''[[Beautiful Girls (film)|Beautiful Girls]]''; as a federal agent comedically paired with [[Dan Aykroyd]] in ''[[Exit to Eden (film)|Exit to Eden]]''; as the voice of a tomboyish female gorilla named Terk in [[Disney]]'s ''[[Tarzan]]''; and as a baseball-loving nun in [[M. Night Shyamalan]]'s ''[[Wide Awake (1998 film)|Wide Awake]]''.

=== ''The Rosie O'Donnell Show'' ===
In 1996, she began hosting a [[daytime TV|daytime]] talk show, ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]''. The show proved very successful, winning multiple [[Emmy]] awards, and earning O'Donnell the title of &quot;The Queen of Nice&quot; for her style of light-hearted banter with her guests and interactions with the audience. As part of her playful banter with her studio audience, O'Donnell often launched [[koosh balls]] at the crowd and camera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvacres.com/props_balls_koosh.htm &quot;Balls &amp; Spheres&quot;], ''TV Acres''&lt;/ref&gt;  She also professed an infatuation with [[Tom Cruise]].

With New York City as the show's homebase, O'Donnell displayed her love of Broadway musicals and plays by having cast members as guests, encouraging the audience to see shows, premiering production numbers as well as promoting shows with ticket give-aways.

After the [[Columbine shootings]], O'Donnell became an outspoken supporter of [[gun control]] and a major figure in the [[Million Mom March]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Amy Paulson&quot;&gt;{{cite news

O'Donnell confronted him about his recent commercial for the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA) and challenged him about the NRA's position on the use of &quot;[[assault weapons]].&quot; She said at the end of the segment the conversation had &quot;not gone the way I had hoped&quot; and added &quot;if you feel insulted by my questions, I apologize, because it was not a personal attack. It was meant to bring up the subject as it is in the consciousness of so many today.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NRA Winning Team&quot;&gt;{{cite web  | title=TRANSCRIPT: Tom Selleck Visits &quot;The Rosie O'Donnell Show&quot;  | publisher=NRA Winning Team  | url=http://www.nrawinningteam.com/norosie.html  | accessdate=2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Otherone&quot;&gt;{{cite web  | first =Otherone  | title=Transcript of Tom Selleck &amp; Rosie O'Donnell's NRA Discussion  | publisher=JLRweb  | url =http://www.geocities.com/rofaq/nradebate.html  | accessdate=2007-07-11|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080302075026/http://www.geocities.com/rofaq/nradebate.html|archivedate=2008-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, the cast from ''[[Annie Get Your Gun (musical)|Annie Get Your Gun]]'' was to appear on the show but refused O'Donnell's request to remove the line &quot;I can shoot a partridge with a single cartridge&quot; from the song &quot;[[Anything You Can Do (song)|Anything You Can Do]]&quot; and agreed to perform &quot;My Defenses Are Down&quot; instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Report: Lyrics Riled Rosie&quot;&gt;{{cite web  | title=Report: Lyrics Riled Rosie  | publisher=People  | date=1999-03-01  | url =http://www.people.com/people/article/0,26334,616006,00.html  | accessdate= 2009-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1999, O'Donnell discontinued her contract with [[Kmart]] as their spokeswoman, as gun enthusiasts complained that she shouldn't be the spokesperson for the largest gun retailer. O'Donnell countered that Kmart sells hunting rifles, not handguns or assault weapons and does so legally which she supports. Both Kmart and O'Donnell denied publicly that Kmart had terminated the contract.&lt;ref&gt;New York Daily News, November 19, 1999 &quot;Rosie Sticks to Her Guns By Unloading Kmart Gig&quot; by Mitchell Fink&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2000, O'Donnell's bodyguard applied for a [[Carrying concealed weapon|concealed firearm permit]]. O'Donnell stated that the security firm contracted by [[Warner Brothers]] requested the gun. O'Donnell stated that because of threats, she and her family need protection, which she attributes to her &quot;tough gun-control rhetoric&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;J.A. Johnson Jr.&quot;&gt;{{cite web  | last =J.A.  | first =Johnson Jr.  | title=Rosie's Bodyguard Applies for Gun Permit | publisher=The Stamford Advocate  | date=2000-05-25  | url = http://www.network54.com/Forum/33620/message/959280480/Rosie+O'Donnell's+Bodyguard+Applies+for+Gun+Permit
 | accessdate=2007-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] Broadway and tourism in New York City was down and many shows were in danger of closing. O'Donnell was among many in the entertainment field who encouraged viewers to visit and support the [[performing arts]]. She announced that she would donate 1 million dollars for aid in the rescue efforts and encouraged other celebrities and citizens alike to &quot;give till it hurts&quot;. In 2002, she left her talk show. The show was then replaced by ''[[The Caroline Rhea Show]]'', with comedienne [[Caroline Rhea]] and ran for one additional season.

=== ''The View'' ===

Her passion for protecting children has led her to be outspoken on issues affecting them, including world affairs and adoption.]]
In September 2006, O'Donnell replaced [[Meredith Vieira]] as a co-host and moderator of the ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', a daytime women-oriented talkshow. [[Star Jones]], a co-host on the show, quit with some speculating Jones's conservative views would be in constant tension with O'Donnell's more liberal counterpoint. O'Donnell had also disputed Jones's route of rapid weight loss, alluding that it must have been [[gastric bypass surgery]] rather than dieting and exercise alone as Star had insisted which also fed speculation about certain tension between the two, Jones later confirmed it was surgery. As a big-name talent O'Donnell drew criticism for her opinions while keeping the show's &quot;[[word of mouth|buzz factor]] up&quot;.&lt;ref name=buzz&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/view/192276 &quot;The Future of The View&quot;] TV Guide, June 3, 2006. Retrieved on 2007-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Donnell is credited with helping the show be more news-focused while still embracing the &quot;fluff&quot; of daytime TV talkshows (celebrities, fashion and food).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20013740,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | title=TV Review: The View – EW.com | date=2007-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the overall downward trend for most daytime broadcast shows, ratings rose by 27%. The show was the fourth most watched in all of daytime in the key demographic of women ages 18–49, and scored record ratings in the total viewer category with an average of 3.4 million viewers—up 15% versus the same time in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117955333.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1 O'Donnell brings big ratings to 'The View' Daytime talk show nabs best-ever November sweeps]. ''Variety'' website. Accessed on May 29, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; O'Donnell adapted to the multi-personality forum in contrast to her anchoring her own talkshows in the past and moderated the opening &quot;Hot Topics&quot; portion of the show where newsworthy items were discussed. Unlike previous years, politics and [[taboo]] subjects were readily explored with O'Donnell and fellow-comic [[Joy Behar]] often giving strong opinions against former President Bush's [[Domestic policy of the George W. Bush administration|domestic]] and [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|foreign]] policies including the [[Iraq war]]. As a conservative counterpoint, [[Elisabeth Hasselbeck]] would support the [[Presidency of George W. Bush#Major issues of presidency|Bush Administration]]'s issues and the two would get into an adversarial give-and-take.

Encouraged by the show to be outspoken, O'Donnell sometimes provoked debate, one time stating &quot;radical Christianity is just as threatening as radical Islam&quot; or criticizing fellow TV personalities. O'Donnell, who was raised Roman Catholic was accused of &quot;serial [[anti-Catholicism]]&quot; and called a [[bigotry|bigot]] by  [[Catholic League (U.S.)|the Catholic League]]'s president [[William A. Donohue|Bill Donohue]] for what he claimed &quot;relentless and profoundly ignorant attacks on the Roman Catholic Church and its teachings.&quot;&lt;ref group=note&gt;On the 24 February 2003 episode of [[Phil Donahue#MSNBC program|Phil Donahue's talk show]] O'Donnell referred to the &quot;[[pedophile]] scandal&quot; in the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston]] resulting in $157 million awarded to 983 claimants,({{cite news  | title=Statement of the Archdiocese of Boston and Boston College on sale of part of Brighton campus  | publisher=The Boston Globe  | date=2007-04-20  | url=http://www.boston.com/globe/spotlight/abuse/stories5/042104_statement.htm  | accessdate=2007-11-25}}), ({{cite web  | last = Cindy Wooden in Rome and Ellie Hidalgo in Los Angeles | title=The Catholic Church and Sexual Abuse by Priests: L.A.

=== 2007–2011 ===
In March 2007, O'Donnell started a video blog, ''[[Jahero]]'', on her website Rosie.com answering fans questions, giving behind the scenes information and serving as a video diary. Originally featuring only O'Donnell and her hair and make-up artist [[Helene Macaulay]] they were soon joined by her writer from ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]'', [[Janette Barber]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosie's 'View' Re&quot;&gt;{{cite web  | title= Rosie's &quot;View&quot; Review: Too Bad It's Beige  | publisher=TMZ  | date=2007-09-05  | url = http://www.tmz.com/2007/09/05/rosies-view-review-too-bad-its-beige/

[[Jenny McCarthy]] appeared once briefly, as has Hasselbeck's mother-in-law and O'Donnell's mother-in-law, her wife Kelli's mother. [[Kathy Griffin]] also appeared, where she read some of the questions. It became so popular that O'Donnell and her creative team considered an &quot;on the road&quot; version of the video blog utilizing fan-submitted suggestions. O'Donnell was the front runner for the &quot;best celebrity blogger&quot; category in the 2007 Blogger's Choice Awards which she won.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitney Matheson&quot;&gt;{{cite news  | last =Matheson  | first =Whitney  | title=Pop Candy: As if you don't read enough blogs ...  | publisher=[[USA Today]]  | date=2007-04-26 | url = http://blogs.usatoday.com/popcandy/2007/04/as_if_you_dont_.html | accessdate= 2007-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Donnell expressed interest in replacing long-time host [[Bob Barker]] when he retired from [[CBS]]'s game show ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. Barker was a frequent guest on her talk show and told reporters that she &quot;would make a fine host.&quot;  Although it was reported he had &quot;endorsed&quot; her as a &quot;possible successor&quot;, Barker said that he had no role in choosing his replacement.&lt;ref name=&quot;successor&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Massey |first=Liz | title=Barker Says O'Donnell Could Replace Him  |work=todaysthv.com | agency=[[Associated Press]]  | date=June 18, 2007  | url=http://www.todaysthv.com/news/story.aspx?storyid=47600

In 2008, O'Donnell starred in and executive produced ''[[America (2009 film)|America]]'', a [[Lifetime Television|Lifetime channel]] original movie in which she plays the therapist of the title character, a 16-year-old boy [[aging out]] of the [[foster care]] system. The film is based on the [[E.R. Frank]] book of the same name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Rosie-Donnell-Star-27543.aspx  Rosie O'Donnell Is Coming to ''America'']&quot; ''[[TV Guide]]''.

In November 2009 ,&quot;Rosie Radio&quot;, a daily two-hour show with O'Donnell discussing news and events on [[Sirius XM Radio]], premiered.

=== ''The Rosie Show'' &amp; ''OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network'' ===

In 2011, O'Donnell began producing material for [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network]]. In May 2011, ''The Doc Club with Rosie O'Donnell'' premiered, a show where O'Donnell moderates live panel discussions following premieres of OWN Documentaries. Thus far, she has hosted specials for ''Becoming Chaz'' in May 2011 and ''[[Miss Representation]]'' in October 2011.

In the fall of 2011, O'Donnell began full time work on her new show, ''[[The Rosie Show]]'', for [[Oprah Winfrey Network (U.S. TV channel)|OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network]].  The show taped at the legendary Chicago studio formerly home to ''The Oprah Winfrey Show.''  The show debuted on October 10, 2011 to generally positive reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/spirit/OWN-Sneak-Preview-The-Rosie-ODonnell-Show#ixzz1ZU82zpPt |title=OWN Sneak Preview - The Rosie O'Donnell Show |publisher=Oprah.com |date=2010-12-14 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The OWN Network cancelled ''The Rosie Show'' on March 16, 2012, with the last show taped March 20, on the eve of Rosie's 50th birthday.  The final show aired on OWN on March 29, 2012. In a statement, Oprah Winfrey said &quot;I thank Rosie from the bottom of my heart for joining me on this journey. She has been an incredible partner, working to deliver the best possible show every single day. As I have learned in the last 15 months, a new network launch is always a challenge and ratings grow over time as you continue to gather an audience. I'm grateful to Rosie and the dedicated Rosie Show team for giving it their all.&quot; O'Donnell responded to the cancellation by thanking her viewers and the host city of Chicago: &quot;I loved working with Oprah in the amazing city of Chicago. I was welcomed with open arms and will never forget the kindness of all I encountered. It was a great year for me — I wish the show was able to attract more viewers — but it did not. So I am headed back to my home in New York — with gratitude. On we go!&quot;

== Other ventures ==

=== ''Rosie'' magazine ===
{{Main|McCall's}}
In 2000, O'Donnell partnered with the publishers of ''[[McCall's]]'' to revamp the magazine as ''Rosie's McCall's'' (or, more commonly, ''Rosie''). The magazine was launched as a competitor to fellow talk show hostess [[Oprah Winfrey]]'s monthly magazine. ''Rosie'' covered issues including breast cancer, [[foster care]] and other matters of concern to O'Donnell. In the September 2000 issue she shared that &quot;she has struggled with depression her entire life&quot; and decided to start medications when she realized her fears were affecting her family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Depression&quot;&gt;{{cite web  | title=How Rosie O'Donnell Beat Depression  | publisher= [[ABC News]]  | date=2000-08-09  | url =http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/Depression/story?id=126783&amp;page=1  | accessdate=2007-07-04}} (New York section)&lt;/ref&gt; With a strong start and a circulation close to 3.5 million things looked promising but the magazine stumbled as conflicts emerged between O'Donnell and the editors. The contract gave O'Donnell control over editorial process and editorial staff but veto power remained with publisher Gruner+Jahr USA. O'Donnell quit the magazine in September 2002 following a dispute over editorial control. &quot;If I'm going to have my name and my brand on the corner of a magazine, it has to be my vision&quot; she told People.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/rosie_odonnell/biography/0,,20033874_10,00.html The End of 'Rosie' Mag, Rosie O'Donnell: Biography 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rosie'' magazine folded in 2003. In late 2003, O'Donnell and the publishers each sued the other for [[breach of contract]]. The publishers claimed that, by removing herself from the magazine's publication, she was in breach of contract. The trial received considerable press coverage. O'Donnell would often give brief press interviews outside of the courtroom responding to various allegations. Of note was a former magazine colleague and breast cancer survivor who testified that O'Donnell said to her on the phone that people who lie &quot;get sick and they get cancer. If they keep lying, they get it again&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2003/LAW/11/06/rosie.magazine.suit.ap/index.html Cancer survivor: Rosie O'Donnell told her liars 'get cancer']&lt;/ref&gt; O'Donnell apologized the next day and stated &quot;I'm sorry I hurt her the way I did, that was not my intention.&quot; The judge ruled against both sides and dismissed the case. In 2006, O'Donnell responded to a question on the &quot;Ask Ro&quot; section of her website in which she stated that she would love to do another magazine.

=== Books ===
In 2002, O'Donnell wrote ''[[Find Me (book)|Find Me]],'' a combination of memoir, mystery and detective story with an underlying interest in re-uniting birth mothers with their children. In addition to cataloging her childhood and early adulthood, the book delved into O'Donnell's relationship with a woman with [[multiple personality disorder]] who posed as an under-aged teen who had become pregnant by rape. The book reached number two on the ''New York Times'' bestseller list.

In October 2007, she released ''[[Celebrity Detox]]'', her second memoir which focuses on the struggles with leaving fame behind, noting her exits from ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]'' and ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'

=== R Family Vacations ===
In 2003, O'Donnell and Carpenter partnered with travel entrepreneur Gregg Kaminsky to launch [[R Family Vacations]] catering to LGBT families, &quot;the very first all gay and lesbian family vacation packages&quot; where &quot;gays and lesbians can bring their kids, their friends, and their parents.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaminsky&quot;&gt;{{cite web  | last =Kaminsky  | first =Gregg  | title=Rosie O'Donnell Announces R Family Vacations  | publisher=Out In Buffalo  | date=2003-08-11  | url =http://www.outinbuffalo.com/home/news.asp?articleid=4916  | accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although O'Donnell is not involved on a day-to-day basis, she does contribute to the creative aspects of &quot;advertising and marketing materials&quot; and initiated the idea for the company when she filled in as a last-minute replacement headliner on one of Kaminsky's [[Atlantis Events]] gay cruises and also came up with the name &quot;R Family Vacations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salvato&quot;&gt;{{cite web  | last =Salvato  | first =Ed  | title=R Family Vacations plies uncharted gay waters  | publisher=[[Planet Out]]  | url =http://www.planetout.com/travel/article.html?sernum=9101  | accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 11, 2004, the first cruise was held with 1600 passengers&lt;ref name=&quot;Planet Out&quot;&gt;{{cite web  | title=Q and A with Rosie and Kelli on &quot;All Aboard!

Rosie's Family Cruise]]'', a documentary film about the trip debuted on [[HBO]] on April 6, 2006, and was nominated for three [[Emmy Awards]]. Of the experience O'Donnell stated &quot;we didn't really realize the magic that was going to take place. People who had never met another gay family met other families and it was powerful.&quot;&lt;ref name=Davis/&gt;

== Charitable work ==
Over her career, O'Donnell has developed a reputation for raising funds and her own philanthropy to charitable causes. In May 1996, [[Warner Books]] advanced O'Donnell $3 million to write a [[memoir]]. She used the money to seed her [[For All Kids]] foundation to help institute national standards for day care across the country. Her memoir, ''[[Find Me (book)|Find Me]]'', was released in April 2002 and became the second highest on the [[New York Times Bestseller List|''New York Times'' Bestseller List]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2007| title= Rosie O'Donnell: Biography| work=People, Celebs | url=http://www.people.com/people/rosie_odonnell/biography/0,,20033874_10,00.html | accessdate=2007-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

San Francisco [[public relations]] firm Fineman Associates awarded top prize to [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] Co.'s designation of O'Donnell as &quot;unkissable&quot; in a promotion for [[Scope (mouthwash)|Scope]] mouthwash on the 1997 annual list of the nation's worst public relations blunders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date=December 24, 1997 | title= P&amp;G wins top 'PR blunder' honor | work=Bizjournals | url=http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/stories/1997/12/22/daily11.html |  accessdate=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the promotion, the &quot;unkissable&quot; O'Donnell partnered with [[Warner Lambert]]'s competitor [[Listerine]] who donated bottles of mouthwash to the studio audience and donated $1,000 to charity every time a hosted guest would kiss her in exchange for O'Donnell promoting their product. On occasion, the guests would offer multiple kisses and [[People magazine|''People'']] reported O'Donnell &quot;smooched her way to more than $350,000.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2007| title= Rosie O'Donnell: Five Fun Facts | work=People | url=http://www.people.com/people/rosie_odonnell |  accessdate=2007-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rosie's Broadway Kids serves more than 4,500 teachers, students, and their family members at 21 schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosiesbroadwaykids.org/site.php Rosie's Broadway Kids]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently programs are in [[Harlem]], [[Midtown Manhattan|Midtown West]], [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]], [[Lower East Side]], [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]], and [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]].

In December 2006, at a one-night charity event on the [[Norwegian Pearl]] cruise ship, [[Elizabeth Birch]], executive director for the Rosie's For All Kids Foundation, confirmed that $50 million from O'Donnell's five-year contract were donated in an irrevocable [[Charitable trust|trust]] to charity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadwayworld.com/viewcolumn.cfm?colid=14168 O'Donnell is Godmother of the 'Pearl;' Benefit Held 12/15] BroadwayWorld.com&lt;/ref&gt; She is also reported to have contributed several hundred thousand dollars for rehabilitation therapies for war veterans who have lost limbs in Iraq and Afghanistan wars.

EA, which owns Pogo, committed $30,000 and more money can be raised based on the amount of playing time people spend on certain games. They also held a sweepstakes in which winners get to fly to New York and meet O'Donnell and attend a charity function as her guest.

During the summer of 2007, O'Donnell was a guest on the multi-artist [[True Colors Tour]], which traveled through 15 cities in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hochman&quot;&gt;{{cite news  | last =Hochman

== Personal life ==
O'Donnell was a resident of [[Nyack, New York]] after the purchase in 1996 of &quot;Pretty Penny,&quot; a Victorian river home that had previously served as the home of [[Helen Hayes]], the American actress and &quot;First Lady of the American Theater.&quot; O'Donnell sold the home to businessman [[Edward M.

=== Coming out ===
In her January 31, 2002, appearance on the sitcom ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'', she played a lesbian mom. A month later as part of her act at the Ovarian Cancer Research benefit at [[Caroline's Comedy Club]] O'Donnell [[coming out|came out]] as a lesbian, announcing &quot;I'm a [[Dyke (slang)|dyke]]!&quot; &quot;I don't know why people make such a big deal about the gay thing. ... People are confused, they're shocked, like this is a big revelation to somebody.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;USAtoday-coy Rosie&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title= Rosie, coy on TV, 'comes out' on stage| work=USA Today, Jeannie Williams | url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/television/2002/2002-02-27-rosie.htm | accessdate=2007-05-30 | date=2002-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement came two months before the end of the hosting of her talk show. Although she also cited the need to put a face to gays and lesbians her primary reason was to bring attention to the [[gay adoption]] issue. O'Donnell is a foster and adoptive mother. She protested against adoption agencies, particularly in Florida, that refused adoptive rights to gay and lesbian parents. [[Diane Sawyer]] interviewed O'Donnell in a March 14, 2002, episode of ''[[Primetime (TV series)|PrimeTime Thursday]]''. O'Donnell told ''[[USA Today]]'' that she chose to talk to Sawyer because she wanted an investigative piece on Florida's ban on gay adoption. She told Sawyer if that was done, &quot;I would like to talk about my life and how (the case) pertains to me.&quot; She spoke about the two gay men in Florida who face having a foster child they raised removed from their home. State law won't let them adopt because Florida bans gay or [[bisexual]] people from adopting.&lt;ref name = &quot;USAtoday-coy Rosie&quot;/&gt; O'Donnell's coming out drew criticism from some LGBT activists who cited her repeated references to being enamored of [[Tom Cruise]] on ''[[The Rosie O'Donnell Show]]'' as deceptive.&lt;ref name = &quot;USAtoday-coy Rosie&quot;/&gt; She responded in her act stating, &quot;I said I wanted him to mow my lawn and bring me a lemonade. I never said I wanted to [[Fellatio|blow]] him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Michael Musto, 2002-03-05. [http://www.villagevoice.com/2002-03-05/columns/ny-mirror/ New York Columns – NY Mirror]. Retrieved 2009-03-18.&lt;/ref&gt; After leaving her show and coming out, O'Donnell returned to stand-up comedy, and cut her hair. O'Donnell told the press that her haircut was meant to mimic the haircut of former [[Culture Club]] backup singer [[Helen Terry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hollywood.outsidethebeltway.com/category/notables/rosie-odonnell/ Rosie O'Donnell May Leave 'The View' Early, By Allie @ Gone Hollywood]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage and children ===
On February 26, 2004, O'Donnell married [[Kelli Carpenter-O'Donnell|Kelli Carpenter]], a former [[Nickelodeon]] marketing executive, in San Francisco two weeks after San Francisco Mayor [[Gavin Newsom]] authorized the granting of marriage licenses to [[same-sex marriage|same-sex couples]]. Her decision to go to San Francisco to marry Carpenter was seen as a show of defiance against then-[[U.S. President|President]] [[George W. Bush]] over his support for the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]]. She said in 2004, &quot;We were both inspired to come here after the sitting president made the vile and hateful comments he made... [O]ne thought ran through my mind on the plane out here – with [[liberty]] and [[Social justice|justice for all]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosie O'Donnell Weds Long&quot;&gt;{{cite web  | last =O'Driscoll  | first =Sean  | coauthors =David Gordon  | title=Rosie O'Donnell Weds Longtime Girlfriend  | publisher=Belfast Telegraph  | date=2004-08-13  | url =http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/  | accessdate=2007-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple was married by San Francisco Treasurer [[Susan Leal]], one of the city's highest ranking lesbian officials and was serenaded by the [[San Francisco Gay Men's Chorus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosie O'Donnell Weds Long&quot;/&gt; O'Donnell said during the trial over ''[[Rosie (magazine)|Rosie]]'' magazine she had decided to marry Carpenter, in part because even though they acted as spouses they legally were no closer than friends: &quot;We applied for [[spousal privilege]] and were denied it by the state. As a result, everything that I said to Kelli, every letter that I wrote her, every e-mail, every correspondence and conversation was entered into the record ... I am now and will forever be a total proponent of [[gay marriage]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosie O'Donnell Weds Long&quot;/&gt;

In mid-November 2009, O'Donnell disclosed that Carpenter had moved out of their home in 2007; a month later, O'Donnell was seen publicly with her new girlfriend, Tracy Kachtick-Anders, a Texas-based artist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Adam Bryant | title=Rosie O'Donnell Is Dating Someone New| url= http://www.tvguide.com/News/Rosie-ODonnell-Dating-1013355.aspx | work=TVGuide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--O'Donnell and Carpenter are parents to adopted children Parker Jaren (born 1995), Chelsea Belle (born 1997), and Blake Christopher (born 1999). Their fourth child, Vivienne Rose (who was conceived through [[artificial insemination]]), was born in 2002 to Carpenter. --&gt; In 2000 the family took in a foster child Mia (born in 1997), and announced intentions to adopt her. In 2001, the state of Florida removed Mia from their home, and O'Donnell has since worked extensively to bring an end to the Florida law prohibiting same-sex family adoption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Rosie_ODonnell/189622 Hollywood.com Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0207/06/lklw.00.html CNN.com transcript of ''Larry King Live'' Interview of O'Donnell]&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010, O'Donnell and her family resided in [[Nyack, New York]], a suburb of New York City that is located in [[Rockland County]] and in Miami's [[Star Island (Florida)|Star Island]]. O'Donnell's brother, [[Daniel O'Donnell (politician)|Daniel]], who is also gay, represents the [[Upper West Side]] of [[Manhattan]] as a member of the [[New York State Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://assembly.state.ny.us/mem/?ad=069 New York State Assembly – Assemblymember Daniel O'Donnell – 69th Assembly District]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, O'Donnell split with her girlfriend Kachtick-Anders. A source said, &quot;They have definitely split up, but it is very complicated because their kids are very close. They still spend a lot of time together.&quot;  A representative for O'Donnell stated &quot;Rosie and Tracy never officially lived under one roof. They have lived near one another for quite some time, and their families still socialize and they see each other frequently.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/rosie_splits_with_lover_tracy_A0XRT37gzTIX0vcoYcLzSM#ixzz1ZUHHzzKy | work=New York Post | title=Rosie splits with lover Tracy | date=2011-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Donnell began dating Michelle Rounds in summer 2011. Rounds at that time was a 40-year-old executive-search consultant from New York City. On December 5, 2011, during a break in the taping of ''The Rosie Show'', O'Donnell announced to her studio audience she and Rounds were engaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2011/12/rosie-odonnell-engaged-to-michelle-rounds/ |title=Rosie O’Donnell Engaged to Michelle Rounds | publisher =[[ABC News]] |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2012-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two married in a private ceremony in New York on June 9, 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20624563,00.html | title=Rosie O'Donnell &amp; Michelle Rounds Are Married |first=Liz|last=McNeil | first2= Maggie | last2 = Coughlan | work=[[People (magazine)|People]] | date =August 27, 2012 |  accessdate =August 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
O'Donnell suffered a heart attack in mid August 2012. She says an artery was 99 percent blocked and a [[stent]] was inserted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rosie O'Donnell Suffers Heart Attack, Gets Stent|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/U/US_PEOPLE_ROSIE_ODONNELL?SITE=AP&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT|publisher=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rosie.com/my-heart-attack/|first=Rosie|last=O'Donnell|publisher=Rosie.com (official site)|title=My Heart Attack|date=August 20, 2012|accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She later revealed on [[Twitter]] that, to reverse her heart disease, she would espouse the whole-foods, plant-based diet promoted by Dr. [[Caldwell Esselstyn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ecorazzi.com/2012/08/23/rosie-odonnell-embraces-plant-based-diet-after-heart-attack/ | title=Rosie O’Donnell Embraces Plant-Based Diet after Heart Attack | last=Koerner | first=Allyson | quote=“nine days later – nine pounds lost – eating a plant based diet #likebillclinton pic.twitter.com/8ItILfpl. {{sic}}” | date=2012-08-23 | accessdate=2012-08-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
