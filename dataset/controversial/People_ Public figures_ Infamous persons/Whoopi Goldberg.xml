==Early life==
Goldberg was born Caryn Elaine Johnson in New York City and raised in Manhattan's [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea neighborhood]], the daughter of Emma (née Harris), a nurse and teacher, and Robert James Johnson, Jr., a clergyman.&lt;ref name=&quot;clergyman&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last=Clark Hine | first=Darlene | title=Black Women in America | publisher=Oxford University Press | edition=Second edition | year=2005 | location=Oxford; New York | page=531 | oclc=192019147}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Whoopi Goldberg Biography | url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/92/Whoopi-Goldberg.html  | work=filmreference | year=2008 | accessdate=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg has described her mother as a &quot;stern, strong, and wise woman&quot; who raised her as a single mother after Goldberg's father had left the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;cigar&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Paul Chutkow | title=Whoopi's Revenge | url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Archives/CA_Show_Article/0,2322,830,00.html | work=Cigar Aficionado | year=1993 | accessdate=May 17, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080303051934/http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Archives/CA_Show_Article/0,2322,830,00.html&lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = March 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg's recent ancestors migrated north from Faceville, [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Palatka, Florida]], and [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bookref1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gates, Jr.|first=Henry Louis|title=In Search of Our Roots: How 19 Extraordinary African Americans Reclaimed Their Past|publisher=Crown|year=2009|pages=225–241|month=January|url=|isbn=0-307-38240-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results of a [[DNA]] test, revealed in the 2006 [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] documentary ''[[African American Lives]]'', traced part of her ancestry to the Papel and Bayote people of modern-day [[Guinea-Bissau]].

Her stage name, Whoopi, was taken from a [[whoopee cushion]]; she has stated that &quot;If you get a little gassy, you've got to let it go. So people used to say to me, 'You're like a whoopee cushion.' And that's where the name came from.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Solomon, Deborah  |authorlink=Deborah Solomon | title=Making Nice | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/20/magazine/20wwln_q4.html | work=The New York Times | date=August 20, 2006–20 July 30, 2007| accessdate=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%22Whoopi+Goldberg+with+Lisa+Yapp%22&amp;search_type= |title=Whoopi Goldberg with Lisa Yapp |work=Youtube |accessdate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She adopted the traditionally German/Jewish surname [[Goldberg (surname)|Goldberg]] as a stage name because her mother felt the original surname of Johnson was not &quot;Jewish enough&quot; to make her a star.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/participant.jsp?spid=72881 Bio] at Turner Network web site&lt;/ref&gt; According to an anecdote told by [[Nichelle Nichols]] in the documentary film ''[[Trekkies (film)|Trekkies]]'', a young Goldberg was watching ''[[Star Trek TOS|Star Trek]]'', and upon seeing Nichols' character [[Uhura]], exclaimed, &quot;Momma! There's a black lady on TV and she ain't no maid!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |  people=[[Nichelle Nichols|Nichols, Nichelle]]  |  title=Trekkies | medium=DVD | publisher=Neo Motion Pictures | date=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; This spawned lifelong fandom of ''Star Trek'' for Goldberg, who would eventually accept a recurring guest-starring role on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''.

Between the years of 1979 and 1981, she lived in socialist [[East Germany]], working in a number of theater productions. During her travels, she would smuggle various items into the country for the artists she stayed with.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5maGpPv6F94 |title=Bill Maher &amp; Christopher Hitchens &amp; Whoopi Goldberg &amp;#124; Communism, Socialism and Capitalism.

==Career==

===Early work===
Goldberg trained under famed acting teacher [[Uta Hagen]] at the HB Studio. She first appeared onscreen in 1981–82 in ''[[Citizen: I'm Not Losing My Mind, I'm Giving It Away (film)|Citizen: I'm Not Losing My Mind, I'm Giving It Away]]'', an avant-garde ensemble feature by San Francisco filmmaker William Farley. Goldberg created ''The Spook Show'', a one-woman show composed of different character monologues, in 1983. Director [[Mike Nichols]] was instantly impressed and offered to take the show to Broadway. The self-titled show ran from October 24, 1984 to March 10, 1985 for a total of 156 sold-out performances. While on Broadway, Goldberg's performance caught the eye of director [[Steven Spielberg]]. He was about to direct the film ''[[The Color Purple (film)|The Color Purple]]'', based on [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning novel by [[Alice Walker]]. Having read the novel, she was ecstatic at being offered a lead role in her first motion picture. Goldberg received compliments on her acting from Spielberg, Walker, and music consultant [[Quincy Jones]]. ''The Color Purple'' was released in late 1985, and was a critical and commercial success. It was later nominated for 11 [[Academy Award]]s including a nomination for Goldberg as [[Academy Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]]. The film did not win any of its Academy Award nominations, but Goldberg won the [[Golden Globe Award]].

[[File:Whoopi Goldberg Cannes 1992.jpg|thumb|Goldberg at the [[1992 Cannes Film Festival]].]]
Goldberg starred in [[Penny Marshall]]'s directorial debut, ''[[Jumpin' Jack Flash (film)|Jumpin' Jack Flash]]'', and began a relationship with David Claessen, a director of photography on the set, and the couple married later that year. The film was a success, and during the next two years, three additional motion pictures featured Goldberg, ''[[Burglar (film)|Burglar]]'', ''[[Fatal Beauty]]'', and ''The Telephone''. Though not as successful as her prior motion pictures, Goldberg still garnered awards from the NAACP Image Awards. Claessen and Goldberg divorced after the box office failure of ''The Telephone'', which Goldberg was under contract to star in. She tried to sue the producers of the film, to no avail. The 1988 movie, ''[[Clara's Heart]]'', was critically acclaimed, and featured a young [[Neil Patrick Harris]]. As the 1980s concluded, she participated in the numerous HBO specials of ''[[Comic Relief USA|Comic Relief]]'' with fellow comedians [[Robin Williams]] and [[Billy Crystal]].

In January 1990, Goldberg starred with [[Jean Stapleton]] in the TV situation comedy ''[[Bagdad Cafe (TV series)|Bagdad Cafe]]''. The show ran for two seasons on [[CBS]]. Simultaneously, Goldberg starred in ''[[The Long Walk Home]]'', portraying a woman in the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. She played a psychic in the 1990 film ''[[Ghost (1990 film)|Ghost]]'', and became the first black female to win the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] in nearly 50 years, and only the second black female in Oscar history to win an acting award.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} ''[[Premiere Magazine]]'' named her character, Oda Mae Brown, to the list of Top 100 best film characters of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Kelly Borgeson, ''et al.''| title=The 100 Greatest Movie Characters of All Time | url=http://www.premiere.com/features/1539/the-100-greatest-movie-characters-of-all-time-page12.html | work=Premiere | accessdate=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldberg starred in ''[[Soapdish]]'' and had a recurring role on ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' as [[Guynan|Guinan]], which she would reprise in two ''Star Trek'' movies. On May 29, 1992, ''[[Sister Act]]'' was released. The motion picture grossed well over US$200 million and Goldberg was nominated for a [[Golden Globe]]. Next, she starred in ''[[Sarafina!]]''. During the next year, she hosted a late-night talk show, ''The Whoopi Goldberg Show'' and starred in two more motion pictures ''[[Made in America (film)|Made in America]]'' and ''[[Sister Act 2: Back in the Habit]]''. From 1994 to 1995, Whoopi appeared in ''[[Corrina, Corrina (film)|Corrina, Corrina]]'', ''[[The Lion King]]'' (voice), ''[[The Pagemaster]]'' (voice), ''[[Boys on the Side]]'', and ''Moonlight and Valentino''. Goldberg became the first African-American female to host the Academy Awards in 1994. She hosted the Awards again in 1996, 1999, and 2002. Goldberg released four motion pictures in 1996: ''[[Bogus (film)|Bogus]]'' (with [[Gerard Depardieu]] and [[Haley Joel Osment]]), ''[[Eddie (film)|Eddie]]'', ''[[The Associate]]'' (with [[Dianne Wiest]]) and ''[[Ghosts of Mississippi]]'' (with [[Alec Baldwin]] and [[James Woods]]). During the filming of ''Eddie'', Goldberg began dating co-star [[Frank Langella]], a relationship which lasted until early 2000. In October 1997, Goldberg and ghostwriter Daniel Paisner, cowrote ''Book'', a collection featuring insights and opinions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.penguingroup.com/nf/Author/AuthorPage/0,,1000018950,00.html Paisner] at Penguin web site&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=September 2011}} In November and December 2005, Goldberg revived her one-woman show on Broadway at the [[Lyceum Theatre (Broadway)|Lyceum Theatre]] in honor of its 20th anniversary.

From 1998 to 2001, Goldberg took supporting roles in the ''[[How Stella Got Her Groove Back]]'' with [[Angela Basset]], ''[[Girl, Interrupted]]'' with [[Winona Ryder]] and [[Angelina Jolie]], ''[[Kingdom Come (2001 film)|Kingdom Come]]'', and ''[[Rat Race (2001 film)|Rat Race]]'' with an all-star ensemble cast. She also played the voice of Liz on the first four seasons of popular PBS program ''[[The Magic Schoolbus]]''. She starred in the successful [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-TV versions of ''[[Cinderella (1997 film)|Cinderella]]'', ''[[A Knight in Camelot]]'', and the TNT Original Movie ''[[Call Me Claus]]''. In 1998, she gained a new audience when she became the &quot;Center Square&quot; on ''[[Hollywood Squares]]'', hosted by [[Tom Bergeron]]. She also served as Executive Producer, for which she was nominated for 4 ''[[Emmy Awards|Emmys]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/whoopi-goldberg |title=Whoopi Goldberg Emmy Nominated |publisher=Emmys.com |accessdate=May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She left the show in 2002, and the &quot;Center Square&quot; was filled in with celebrities for the last two on-air seasons without Goldberg. In 2003, Goldberg returned to television, starring in the NBC comedy, ''[[Whoopi]]'', which was canceled after one season. On her 48th birthday, Goldberg was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]]. Goldberg also appeared along side Samuel Jackson and Angela Bassett in the HBO special Unchained Memories, narrating slave narratives. During the next two years, she became a spokeswoman for [[Slim Fast]] and produced two television sitcoms: Lifetime's original drama ''[[Strong Medicine]]'' that ran for six seasons and ''Whoopi's Littleburg'', a [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] show for younger children. Goldberg made guest appearances on ''[[Everybody Hates Chris]]'', as an elderly character named Louise Clarkson. She produced the [[Noggin (TV channel)|Noggin]] sitcom ''[[Just for Kicks (TV series)|Just For Kicks]]'', in early 2006. She was a guest at [[Elton John]]'s 60th birthday bash and concert at [[Madison Square Garden]] on March 25, 2007.

===''The View''===
[[File:Whoopi Comic Relief cropped.jpg|thumb|left|Goldberg at [[Comic Relief]] in 2006]]
On September 4, 2007, Goldberg became the new moderator and co-host of ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'', replacing [[Rosie O'Donnell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | agency=Associated Press | title=Whoopi Goldberg joins 'The View' | url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/08/01/view.whoopi/index.html?eref=rss_mostpopular | work=CNN | year=2007 | accessdate=May 17, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080307185632/http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/TV/08/01/view.whoopi/index.html?eref=rss_mostpopular |archivedate = March 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Donnell stated on her official blog that she wanted Goldberg to be moderator. Goldberg's debut as moderator drew 3.4 million viewers, 1 million fewer than O'Donnell's debut ratings. After two weeks, however, ''The View'' was averaging 3.5 million total viewers under Goldberg, a 7% increase from 3.3 million under O'Donnell the previous season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Michael Learmonth| title=Whoopi-led View on topshow tops Rosie's ratings | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117972516.html?categoryid=1275&amp;cs=1 | work=Variety | date=September 23, 2007 | accessdate=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldberg's first appearance on the show was controversial when she made statements about [[Michael Vick]]'s [[Bad Newz Kennels dog fighting investigation|dogfighting]] as being &quot;part of his cultural upbringing&quot; and &quot;not all that unusual&quot; in parts of the South.&lt;ref name=Vick&gt;{{cite news | agency=Associated Press | title=Goldberg defends Vick in 'View' debut | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/09/04/entertainment/e113436D18.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | date=September 4, 2007 | accessdate=May 17, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080622115415/http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/n/a/2007/09/04/entertainment/e113436D18.DTL&lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = June 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Steve Gorman | title=Whoopi Goldberg defends Vick's dog-fighting role | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN0444500720070905 | work=Reuters | date=September 4, 2007 | accessdate=May 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another comment that stirred controversy was the statement that the Chinese &quot;have a very different relationship to cats&quot; and that &quot;you and I would be very pissed if somebody ate kitty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Venay Menon| title=The new View?
