The show was originally developed for [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and was titled ''Criss Angel MINDFREAK''. Eventually, the show evolved into ''Believe'' when he entered a partnership with Cirque du Soleil and the Luxor's parent company, [[MGM Mirage]], financed the show with $100 million.&lt;ref name=LAT101208&gt;Lee, Chris.

In April 2009, Angel ended a performance of ''Believe'' by &quot;hurling obscene insults&quot; at blogger [[Perez Hilton]], an audience member. Hilton reportedly had texted to his fans during the performance that the show was &quot;unbelievably BAD&quot; and that he'd &quot;rather be getting a root canal&quot;, and word had gotten back to Angel by the end of the performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lvrj.com/news/43243067.html |title=NORM: Coarse shout-out stirs up Tweeters |publisher=Lvrj.com |date=2009-04-19 |accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date =20 April 2009 |url=http://vegasblog.latimes.com/vegas/2009/04/perez-hiltons-excellent-vegas-adventure.html |title=Perez Hilton's excellent Vegas adventure, from Criss Angel to Miss USA &amp;#124; The Movable Buffet |publisher=Vegasblog.latimes.com |date=2009-04-20 |accessdate=2010-09-26 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}} [http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http://vegasblog.latimes.com/vegas/2009/04/perez-hiltons-excellent-vegas-adventure.html archive]&lt;/ref&gt; Cirque du Soleil later apologized to Hilton for Angel's remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://vegasblog.latimes.com/vegas/2009/04/perez-hiton-gets-apology-from-cirque-angel-remains-silent.html |title=Perez Hiton gets apology from Cirque; Angel remains silent &amp;#124; The Movable Buffet |publisher=Vegasblog.latimes.com |date=20 April 2009 | accessdate=2010-09-26 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the ''Las Vegas Sun'' critic John Katsilometes, after being unimpressed by the initial show, said that the show had improved by reducing the narrative elements and focusing on the magic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasvegassun.com/blogs/kats-report/2011/jan/02/believe-it-angels-work-has-markedly-improved-luxor/]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the ''Toronto Star'' wrote: “The show is easily the most exciting thing now on stage in Vegas!” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/thestar/access/2230019331.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jan+5%2C+2011&amp;author=Richard+Ouzounian&amp;pub=Toronto+Star&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=E.5&amp;desc=Sin+City+offers+plenty+of+theatrical+second+chances | first=Richard | last=Ouzounian | title=Sin City offers plenty of theatrical second chances | date=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Phenomenon''===
Starting in October 2007 he appeared as a judge on ''[[Phenomenon (TV series)|Phenomenon]]'', with [[Uri Geller]] and in a CNN interview about the show he told [[Larry King]] &quot;no one has the ability, that I'm aware of, to do anything supernatural, psychic, talk to the dead. And that was what I said I was going to do with ''Phenomenon''. If somebody goes on that show and claims to have supernatural psychic ability, I'm going to bust [him] live and on television.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.magicopen.com/criss-angel-secrets/mindfreak-star-criss-angel-destroys-self-proclaimed-psychics-reputation-on-tv/ | title=Larry King Live: Mindfreak Criss Angel | publisher=CNN |date=October 30, 2007| first=| last=  | accessdate =2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikinews|Criss Angel challenges Uri Geller and Jim Callahan over paranormal claims}}
On the October 31, 2007 episode of the reality show ''Phenomenon'', [[Mentalism|Paranormalist]] Jim Callahan performed a [[Conjuration|summoning]], purportedly of author [[Ray Hill|Raymond Hill]], to help discover the contents of a locked box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21576519/ | title=Angel sparks altercation on ‘Phenomenon’ | publisher=[[MSNBC]] |date=2007-11-01 | first=| last=  | accessdate =2007-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although fellow judge [[Uri Geller]] praised the performance, Angel called it &quot;comical&quot; and subsequently challenged both Callahan and Geller to guess the contents of two envelopes he pulled out of his pocket, offering a million dollars of his own money to whoever could do so. This led to an argument between Callahan and Angel, during which Callahan walked toward Angel and called him an &quot;ideological bigot&quot;, with the two pulled apart as the show promptly went to a commercial break. Angel has since revealed the contents of one envelope and at the unveiling he challenged Geller one more time. Geller responded, &quot;Although we were born one day apart - I was born on the 20th of December and you on the 19th - a lot of years between us - 40 years, you were one year old when I came out with my spoon bending...&quot; Criss Angel cut him off at this point, saying, &quot;I guess this is a 'no,'&quot; and proceeded to open the envelope. The envelope contained an [[index card]] with the numbers &quot;911&quot; printed on it for [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001]]. Angel's explanation was this: &quot;If on 9-10 somebody could have predicted that 9-11 was going to happen, they could have saved thousands of lives&quot;. The other envelope's contents was scheduled to be revealed on the first episode of Season 4 of ''Criss Angel: Mindfreak''.
