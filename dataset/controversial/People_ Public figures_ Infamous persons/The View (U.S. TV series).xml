[[File:TheViewOriginal.jpg|thumb|right|The original panel of ''The View''; [[Meredith Vieira]], [[Star Jones]], [[Debbie Matenopoulos]] and [[Barbara Walters]] in 1997.]]
'''''The View''''' is an [[Television in the United States|American]] [[talk show]] broadcast on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] as part of [[ABC Daytime]]. Created by [[Barbara Walters]] and [[Bill Geddie]], who both also serve as the show's [[executive producer]]s, the program features a panel of women as co-hosts. As of 2007, [[Whoopi Goldberg]] moderates discussions while the rest of the panel consists of [[Joy Behar]], [[Elisabeth Hasselbeck]], [[Sherri Shepherd]] and, part-time, [[Barbara Walters]]. 

Since debuting in 1997, international versions of ''The View'' have premiered around the world.

==History==
''The View'' (originally titled ''The View from Here'') premiered August 11, 1997 replacing ''[[Caryl &amp; Marilyn: Real Friends]]'', which was dropped due to low [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]].&lt;ref name=&quot;variety&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Levin |first=Gary |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116680022.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1 |title='Caryl &amp; Marilyn' axed as ABC tries new 'View' |publisher=Variety.com |date=1997-05-18 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VTV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1116678191.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1 |title=New point of 'View' for ABC &amp; Walters from '&amp;#39;Variety'&amp;#39; magazine |publisher=Variety.com |date=1997-05-20 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original set was a leftover set from a cancelled soap opera, ''[[The City (1995 TV series)|The City]]'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Walters | first=Barbara | title=Audition | publisher=Alfred A. Knopf | year=2008 | pages=544–545 | month=June | isbn=978-0-307-26646-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ABC introduced a new set for ''The View'' for its fifth season, located within the ABC Television Center in New York City. A ''[[New York Times]]'' review published ten days after the show premiered, describes what critic Caryn James thought was distinctive about the show, &quot;The idea of women talking to one another on daytime television is not exactly radical. The idea that those women should be smart and accomplished is still odd enough to make ''The View'' seem wildly different. It actively defies the bubbleheads-'R'-us approach to women's talk shows....&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9505E3DA173EF932A1575BC0A961958260 Feet on the Ground, Heads Without Bubbles], [[The New York Times]]. 1997-08-21&lt;/ref&gt; After a year on the air, a review of the show from ''[[Salon.com]]'' attempted to summarize what had made the show a &quot;(very guilty) pleasure&quot; for its mostly female audience. &quot;''The View'' has caught on with viewers because it gives expression to feelings more complicated, and real, than its detractors realize. Like the [[Rat Pack]], it's all about freedom in an uptight world. Vieira, Walters, et al., have confessed to a lot of things on the show that women are supposed to feel guilty about: forgetting to vote, being too lazy to exercise, hating skinny models, letting the kids watch too much TV, admiring Hollywood's latest hunk. &lt;ref name=&quot;salon&quot;&gt;[http://www.salon.com/ent/tv/mill/1998/08/17mill.html August 1998 review of the show] from [[Salon.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The show premiered with four co-hosts: [[Meredith Vieira]], [[Star Jones]], [[Debbie Matenopoulos]], and [[Barbara Walters]]. Walters and [[Joy Behar]] initially took turns as the fourth co-host but Behar has since become a full-time co-host.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot; /&gt; The panel expands to five when Walters joined in. The subsequent opening credits for the show, featuring [[voice-over]] from Walters, explain the show's premise:
:I've always wanted to do a show with women of different generations, backgrounds and views: a [[Meredith Vieira|working mother]]; a [[Star Jones|professional in her 30s]]; a [[Debbie Matenopoulos|young woman just starting out]]; and then [[Joy Behar|somebody who's done almost everything and will say almost anything]]. And in a perfect world, I'd get to join the group whenever I wanted....&lt;ref name=&quot;salon&quot;/&gt;

[[Bill Geddie]], the co-executive producer, is the lone recurring male persona sometimes shown as stepping out from behind camera to interact with the hosts. In an interview with ''[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]]'' he stated: &quot;I'm not an on-air personality and I think anybody who's seen me realizes that. But early on, the network thought it would be kind of fun to see there's this guy here in charge, but if you watch the show, you see that generally speaking I’m a side player and I’m basically there to get a laugh.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6400571.html |title='&amp;#39;Bill Geddie's point of 'view'&amp;#39;' |publisher=Broadcastingcable.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mostly five women discuss current issues and news items ranging from [[social]] and [[political]] issues to [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] headlines and [[celebrity]] news. Walters, &quot;a co-owner (with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]) and co-[[executive producer]]&quot; of the show,&lt;ref name=&quot;selection&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/02/arts/television/02view.html Whoopi Goldberg Joins ‘The View’]&lt;/ref&gt; likely has final decisions as to the casting of her co-hosts. Every show is ended by one of the co-hosts, primarily the person moderating or Barbara Walters, simply saying &quot;Have a great day everyone and take a little time to enjoy The View!&quot; Or if short on time simply, &quot;Enjoy The View!&quot;

===Co-hosts===
''The View'' has had ten co-hosts since it began airing. [[Barbara Walters]] and [[Joy Behar]] are the only original co-hosts still on the program.

Note: When Goldberg is off, Walters replaces her as moderator and moves to the 1st seat.

==Seasons 1–8 (1997–2005)==
For the first couple of years of its existence, the series remained rather controversy-free save for criticism given towards [[Debbie Matenopoulos]], a panelist who was spoofed mercilessly by the critics, who felt that Matenopoulos did not have the proper news credentials for the show. She was ultimately let go in 1999, when her contract was not renewed. Following Matenopoulos' departure, [[Lisa Ling]] was announced as the new co-host beating out [[Rachel Campos-Duffy]] and [[Lauren Sánchez]] who competed in an on-air try-out to fill the vacated seat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://yahoo.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,4704,00.html | title = Good View | work = | publisher = eonline.com | date = 1999-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ling departed in 2002 to host ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic Explorer]]''. Former ''[[Survivor (US TV series)|Survivor]]'' contestant [[Elisabeth Hasselbeck]] replaced Ling in 2003 after Hasselbeck, [[Rachel Campos-Duffy]] and [[Erin Hershey Presley]] were the finalists in a competition that ended with each of the three getting a week-long on-air tryout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eonline.com/News/Items/0,1,12985,00.html ''The View'' Eyes Elisabeth], a November 2003 story about Hasselbeck's selection from [[E!]] Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Season 9 (2005–06)==
''The View'' experienced several host changes through the end of season 9 and the start of season 10. Meredith Vieira announced on April 6, 2006 that she was leaving the show to become co-host of the long-running [[NBC]] [[NBC News|News]] program ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'', which Barbara Walters co-hosted in the 1960s and 1970s, first with [[Hugh Downs]], then with [[Frank McGee (journalism)|Frank McGee]], and later [[Jim Hartz]], replacing [[Katie Couric]] (who had just announced she was leaving ''Today'' to anchor the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-040606vieira_lat,0,4801620.story Vieira Selected as Couric's Successor at ''Today''], an April 2006 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article&lt;/ref&gt; On April 28, 2006 an announcement was made at the [[33rd Daytime Emmy Awards]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/28/AR2006042800002.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Rosie O'Donnell Joining 'View' | date=April 28, 2006 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that former talk show host [[Rosie O'Donnell]] would be joining the show at the start of the tenth season in September 2006. The announcement about O'Donnell fueled speculation that Jones would also leave the show. One reason for this speculation was a dispute regarding O'Donnell's public remarks about Jones' dramatic weight loss. Jones publicly stated that her weight loss was a result of diet and exercise, but O'Donnell disputed that saying it was the result of [[gastric bypass surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/sfgate/category?blogid=7&amp;cat=534 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Rosie O'Donnell signs talk show deal with Oprah | date=August 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 issue of ''[[Glamour (magazine)|Glamour]]'', Jones revealed that she had, in fact, undergone gastric bypass surgery in August 2003, leading to her dramatic weight loss over the next four years.

In June 2006 Jones announced her departure on air surprising Walters and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Jones said she would remain on the show through July, but the next day Walters announced that Jones would no longer be a part of ''The View'' except for previously recorded segments. Both ABC and Jones have publicly stated that the decision to not renew her contract was not related to the hiring of O'Donnell. In an interview with [[People magazine|''People'' magazine]], Jones claimed the decision to leave was not hers, and that in April, [[Television producer|producers]] told her that her contract would not be renewed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/tv/1401AP_TV_The_View_Reynolds.html | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=January 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an interview with the [[Associated Press]], Walters stated that ABC executives had apparently decided not to renew Jones' contract as early as the previous fall due to diminished approval for the co-host which was showing up in their market research. Walters said, &quot;We tried to talk them [network executives] out of it, and we tried to give Star time to redeem herself in the eyes of the audience, and the research just kept getting worse.&quot; Walters has publicly commented about feeling &quot;betrayed&quot; by Jones, since Jones unexpectedly made the announcement two days ahead of schedule. &quot;I love Star and I was trying to do everything I possibly could — up until this morning, when I was betrayed — to protect her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=2127050 Reynolds' Announcement Upsets Walters], a June 27, 2006 [[Associated Press]] story via [[ABC News]]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 2, 2009 Walters brought up Jones' appearance on ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'' the previous day and stated her well wishes towards the former co-host. Behar voiced her ambivalence towards Jones and stated that the co-hosts had to lie about her gastric bypass procedure. &quot;What can you say?&quot; said Behar, &quot;We had 10 years with the girl. We had our ups and downs and, uh, good luck to her.&quot; Behar's annoyance was clear when she went on to say, &quot;Now we all know the truth, so go and have a happy life.&quot; Hasselbeck and Shepherd were not as vocal and mostly commented on Jones' physical appearance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=7239771 No Hard Feelings: 'View' Applauds Star Jones - ABC News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Jones' departure, the show used guest co-hosts to fill her spot. Various media outlets reported that television personality [[Gayle King]] and actress [[Sheryl Lee Ralph]] were both interested in the job. [[Sherri Shepherd]] eventually took Jones' spot at the table. Jones eventually landed a job with AOL as an &quot;AOL Coach&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coaches.aol.com/love-and-sex/star-jones-reynolds/main |title=Star Jones Reynolds Main - AOL Coaches |publisher=Coaches.aol.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequently negotiated a deal with [[Court TV]] to host her own one-hour talk show, ''[[Star Jones (TV series)|Star Jones]]'' which premiered on August 20, 2007 but was later canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/03-07-2007/0004541635&amp;EDATE= |title=Star Jones Reynolds Joins Court TV as Executive Editor and Host of New Daytime Talk Show |location=New York |publisher=Prnewswire.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Season 10 (2006–07)==
[[Image:TheViewTitleCard.PNG|thumb|The View Season 10 title card.]]
In September 2006, O'Donnell made her debut as the new co-host and moderator of the show. With the new changes in place, including a new set design and new table, September 2006 brought in record ratings. A total of 3.1 million viewers watched that month, the highest total viewership the program has ever seen. The talk show also surged 34% in the advertiser-friendly &quot;women aged 18–49&quot; demographic, and sustained its early season success with its best ever November [[sweeps]] period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117955333.html?categoryid=1275&amp;cs=1 | work=Variety | title=O'Donnell brings big ratings to 'The View' | first=Josef | last=Adalian | date=December 7, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Entertainment Weekly'' magazine in March 2007 cited ''The View'' as doing for daytime TV what the ''Daily Show'' has done for nighttime TV in that it offers viewers a show that deals in genuine opinion and not mere fluff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,20013740,00.html | work=Entertainment Weekly | title=TV Review: The View}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During season 10, O'Donnell led the daytime women's chatfest as the moderator steering the opening &quot;Hot Topics&quot; portion of the show. Unlike previous seasons, however, politics and taboo subjects were readily explored with the two comics (O'Donnell and Behar) quickly finding humor in the news of the day and often giving strong opinions against then-President [[George W. Bush]]'s policies including the [[Iraq War|war in Iraq]] which was losing support amongst Americans. As a counterpoint to O'Donnell's [[Liberalism|liberal]] views, the more [[conservative]] Hasselbeck would often support the Bush Administration's views and the two would get into an adversarial give-and-take at least until both had made their points.

Always outspoken, O'Donnell sometimes crossed a line with certain audiences when the comedian would talk politics or veer into religious discussions, at one time stating &quot;radical [[Christianity]] is just as threatening as radical [[Islam]]&quot;. 

''The View'' achieved higher [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] with O'Donnell's outspoken and candid nature moving the show into a newsworthy spectrum from traditional daytime talk fare. She was sometimes criticized for not acting as much as a moderator for discussion as much as a spokesperson for various, often liberal, viewpoints. As a big-name talent she drew criticism for her [[opinions]] while keeping the show's &quot;[[word of mouth|buzz factor]]&quot; up.&lt;ref name=buzz&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/view/192276 &quot;The Future of The View&quot;] TV Guide, June 3, 2006. Retrieved on 2007-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt; The downside of being spontaneous and putting her views in front of a national audience was that such remarks were often the subject of controversy and criticism, especially by [[conservative]] commentators and other media outlets, who recirculated comments and clips from the show. The show has continued to address more substantive subjects even after her departure.

On April 25, 2007 O'Donnell announced she would be leaving the show as a co-host when her contract expired because the network could not come to terms on the length of a new contract. She did, however, say that she planned to return as an occasional correspondent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/26/arts/television/26rosi.html Rosie O’Donnell Says She Will Say Goodbye to ‘The View’ in June]. ''New York Times'' website. Accessed on April 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hasselbeck/O'Donnell argument===
As alluded to earlier, O'Donnell has been outspoken about her condemnation of many [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]] policies including the entire [[War in Iraq|Iraq War]]. She consistently brought up recent military deaths and news about the war, and criticized the US media for its lack of coverage on the Bush administration's actions and policies. On May 17, 2007 O'Donnell rhetorically asked, &quot;[[Lancet surveys of casualties of the Iraq War|655,000 Iraqi civilians dead]]. Who are the [[terrorists]]? If you were in [[Iraq]] and another country, the United States, the richest in the world, invaded your country and killed 655,000 of your citizens, what would you call us?&quot;&lt;ref name=us&gt;{{cite news |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/18739523/ |title= 'Scarborough Country' for May 17 |date=May 18, 2007 |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=2007-08-23}} (Transcript)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Conservative]] commentators claimed O'Donnell paralleled American soldiers to terrorists.

On May 23, 2007 a heated discussion ensued because of what O'Donnell perceived as a lack of willingness of Hasselbeck to defend O'Donnell's right to disagree with invading Iraq and the resulting [[military occupation]].&lt;ref name=terrorists&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ek1K6TYssa4

Hasselbeck then told O'Donnell to &quot;defend your own insinuations&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.newsmax.com/archives/ic/2007/5/24/75654.shtml |title=Rosie O'Donnell Attacks Get Personal on 'The View' |publisher=Archive.newsmax.com |date=2007-05-24 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The debate unfortunately became more heated when Behar and Shepherd made joking attempts to end the discussion. The incident was widely covered in mainstream media including a split-screen shot of O'Donnell and Hasselbeck arguing. The following day [[Kathy Griffin]] sat in for O'Donnell who was celebrating her partner Kelli's birthday. The day after ABC announced that O'Donnell had asked to be let out of her contract nearly a month before its expiration and was given permission to leave immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,275552,00.html |title= ABC: Rosie O'Donnell Won't Be Back on 'The View' |date=May 25, 2007 |publisher=[[Fox News]] |accessdate=2008-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with Oprah Winfrey, O'Donnell said that she knew it was time to leave the show when she saw the [[split screen (film)|split screen]] image of her and Hasselbeck on either side. She stated that it fed on the idea that the producers wanted the two to be confrontational and that the show's producers had to preset a split screen effect. ''ABC News'' reported that her arguments with Hasselbeck brought the show its best ratings ever.&lt;ref&gt;ABC ''[[Eyewitness News]]''; May 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Donnell has stated she bore no ill will towards Hasselbeck and she loves all the co-hosts. In ''[[Jahero]]'', O'Donnell later stated she had not talked to Hasselbeck but was &quot;stunned&quot; Hasselbeck subsequently brought up [[Donald Trump]], with whom O'Donnell had publicly feuded. While the number of viewers was higher than the year before O'Donnell joined the show, in the month following her departure, viewership was down by an average of 232,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.calendarlive.com/tv/ratings/cl-et-quick29.6jun29,0,6515562.story | author = Matea Gold | title = 'View' ratings down post-Rosie | accessdate=2007-07-17 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071013134420/http://calendarlive.com/tv/ratings/cl-et-quick29.6jun29,0,6515562.story |archivedate = October 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Donnell stated after her departure that Walters and other show hosts wear earpieces through which backstage producers instruct them what to say.&lt;ref name=earpiece&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/rush_molloy/2007/10/05/2007-10-05_rosie_odonnell_barbara_walters_fired_me_.html Rosie O'Donnell: Barbara Walters fired me from 'The View'] from [http://www.nydailynews.com New York Daily News].

;'''Replacement moderator'''
{{Wikinews|Whoopi Goldberg to take Rosie O'Donnell's spot on 'The View'}}
A variety of different names were floated around as replacements for O'Donnell during the tenth season's final months. Among those reportedly considered to replace O'Donnell were [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Gayle King]], [[Sherri Shepherd]], [[Kathy Griffin]], [[Roseanne Barr]] and [[Mario Cantone]]. On August 1, Walters ended speculation announcing that Goldberg would be replacing O'Donnell as moderator for the eleventh season. When asked by Behar if she liked engaging in celebrity feuds, Goldberg responded by saying she has no plans to feud with any of her co-hosts. However, an article in the ''L.A. Times'' &quot;Show Tracker&quot; column on July 26, 2007, had the following quote:
&quot;She is exactly what the show needs,&quot; said Hollywood publicist Howard Bragman. &quot;She is a beloved brand name; she is outspoken; she has done this before, she is a person of color; she is as far left as Rosie; she lives in New York; and she can kick Elizabeth Hasselbeck's ass.&quot;

Prior to the official announcement that Goldberg would be joining the program, various media outlets reported that both Goldberg and Sherri Shepherd would be added to the panel. ''[[In Touch Weekly|In Touch]]'' magazine reported that a deal for Shepherd to join ''The View'' fell through after negotiations went awry over a salary dispute. Along with Shepherd, ''The View'' was reportedly also in talks with radio personality [[Jacque Reid]] and Griffin to join the show.
Walters served as moderator for all but 3 shows that summer. 2 of those 3 were moderated by Whoopi Goldberg (prior to her joining the show permanently) and the other was moderated by Gayle King.

==Season 11 (2007–08)==
''The View'' returned for its eleventh season on September 4, 2007 with celebrity guest [[Danny DeVito]]. Behar, Hasselbeck and Walters returned and Goldberg officially started as moderator of the program. Preliminary ratings show that 3.4 million people watched the debut episode, roughly 1 million less than season 10's debut with O'Donnell, but still ranking as the show's second highest season premiere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5jm1YjFcMul6ntsyeIoivr4pCne7A]{{Dead link|date=March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walters announced on September 10 that Shepherd was joining the panel as the fifth permanent member. This marks the first time since Meredith Vieira left in 2006 that the show features a complete panel of five co-hosts (although Hasselbeck began an extended maternity leave in November). It also marks the first time in the show's history that two [[African-American]] co-hosts are part of the same panel. With the addition of Goldberg and Shepherd, ''The View'' has garnered its highest ratings ever. After two weeks, ''The View'' under Goldberg is averaging 3.5 million total viewers, a 7% increase from 3.3 million under O'Donnell last season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Learmonth |first=Michael |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117972516.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1 |title=View' on top |publisher=Variety.com |date=2007-09-23 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to two new co-hosts, the show's set underwent a transformation from blue to orange, Behar returned to the second position seat next to the moderator, and the format of full-hour Hot Topics was introduced allowing more in-depth conversations and debates. Other changes and additions included a week of episodes from Las Vegas (the show's first time in the location), an episode with limited commercial breaks (sponsored by [[T-Mobile]]), and various segments pertaining to changes in Whoopi's life (quitting smoking, losing weight, and rehearsing for her role in [[Xanadu (musical)]] to name a few).

On October 16, 2007 it was announced that Hasselbeck would begin her maternity leave as of October 23, 2007. Hasselbeck returned to the show when the show came back from Christmas hiatus on January 7, 2008. While Hasselbeck was on [[maternity leave]] her seat was filled by a rotating guest cast. An article in the Boston Globe a week later stated: &quot;When Elisabeth Hasselbeck bade farewell to her cohosts on &quot;The View&quot; Tuesday, it was all hugs, well-wishes, and baby-product endorsements. But as Hasselbeck begins her 2{{frac|1|2}}-month maternity leave, the political landscape is shifting, as well. America's most dangerous [[conservative]] - or so some [[liberals]] see it - is leaving TV for a while.&quot; It went on to say: &quot;Hasselbeck, the apple-cheeked blonde with the football-player husband, consistently draws a brand of hatred from the left that [[Hillary Clinton]] generates from the right; 'screechmonger' is one of the more printable [[term of disparagement|slurs]] hurled at her from the [[blogosphere]]. [[Barry Manilow]] has called her 'offensive' however it's interesting that an America's sweetheart-type would generate such [[vitriol]] says a lot about the state of debate in a [[polarized]] country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Boston Globe, October 25, 2007; [http://www.boston.com/ae/tv/articles/2007/10/25/conservatives_left_without_a_voice_on_the_view/?p1=email_to_a_friend].&lt;/ref&gt;

The new season opened with, among other topics, criticism for Goldberg's comments football player [[Michael Vick]]'s role in a [[dog-fighting]] scandal. Of the [[Atlanta Falcons]] football player she said, &quot;He's from [[Southern United States|the South]], from the Deep South... This is part of his cultural upbringing... For a lot of people, dogs are sport... Instead of just saying (Vick) is a beast and he's a monster, this is a kid who comes from a culture where this is not questioned.&quot; Behar took issue with Goldberg's comments and asked, &quot;What part of the country is this? How about dog torturing and dog murdering?&quot; Goldberg's comments also were denounced by Wayne Pacelle, president of the [[Humane Society of the United States]], who noted that dogfighting is outlawed in all fifty U.S. states and is considered a [[felony]] in all but two: [[Idaho]] and [[Wyoming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN0444500720070905 | author = Steve Gorman | title = Whoopi Goldberg defends Vick's dog-fighting role | accessdate=2007-09-04 | publisher=Reuters | date=September 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg defended herself the following day by explaining she was attempting to explain Vick's actions from a cultural view but was in no way condoning or excusing him.

On the September 25, 2007 show Goldberg criticized two [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[news anchor]]s for the manner in which they reported the death of [[Marcel Marceau]], arguably the most famous [[mime]] in the world, on the network's overnight newscast ''[[World News Now]]''. Describing Marceau as a &quot;huge influence&quot; on how she performs, Goldberg said she was moved to speak out on what she saw as disrespectful and &quot;poorly handled&quot; reporting. &quot;If you are a news person and you don't understand the person you are talking about, don't make fun of them&quot;, Goldberg added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Whoopi blasts anchors over mime report |date=2007-09-25 |work=EarthTimes.org |url=http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/113752.html |accessdate=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=ABC's World News Now Laughs It Up, At All The Wrong Times |date=2007-09-10 |work=Media Bistro |url= http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/abc/abcs_world_news_now_laughs_it_up_at_all_the_wrong_times_66646.asp |accessdate=2007-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 3, 2007 Hasselbeck and Goldberg got into a discussion about [[Hillary Clinton]]'s proposed $5000 baby entitlement which became heated due to Hasselbeck stating that it would lead to fewer abortions due to women wanting to keep the money.&lt;ref name=&quot;baby plan&quot;/&gt; Goldberg warned Hasselbeck to &quot;back off a little&quot; and asked her if she &quot;had ever been in that position to make that decision&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;baby plan&quot;/&gt; Goldberg also stated, &quot;Most people do not want to have abortions. Most women do not have them with some sort of party going on. It is the hardest decision that a woman ever- wait- ever has to make. So, when you talk about it, a little bit of reverence to the women out there who have had to make this horrible decision. And one of the reasons that, that we have had to make this decision is because so many women were found bleeding, dead, with hangers in their bodies because they were doing it themselves. The idea of this was to make it safe and clean. That was the reason the law came into effect. That was why it was done.&lt;ref name=&quot;baby plan&quot;&gt;[http://www.accesshollywood.com/news/ah6972.shtml?dst=rss%7cgeneral_rss Video &amp; article about Goldberg &amp; Hasselbeck debate about abortion]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prompted by [[Jesse Jackson]], and his use of ''[[nigger]]'' before an interview on ''[[Fox and Friends]]'', the panel got into a discussion about its use and history. Goldberg and Shepherd explained that it's a word &quot;that has meaning when you give it meaning&quot; and that &quot;we use it the way we wanna use it&quot;, emphasizing its acceptance within the black community. Saying they had reappropriated the word and, in part, re-purposed its usage. Hasselbeck asked how could she tell her child that she can not say it, but &quot;Billy, the African-American child&quot;, can. Hasselbeck voiced frustration about its use in pop culture and how its negative past only encourages division. &quot;How are we supposed to then move forward when we keep using terms that bring back that pain&quot;, said Hasselbeck, tearfully, following Goldberg's statement that &quot;we don't live in the same world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25725702/ |title=Whoopi, Elisabeth spar over ‘N-word’ - Entertainment - Access Hollywood - TODAYshow.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2008-07-17 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that week Behar hosted ''[[Larry King Live]]'' and moderated a debate about the segment on ''The View.'' [[Fran Drescher]] was a guest and said she found Hasselbeck's crying awkward and didn't understand what made her so upset. Hasselbeck called into the program and expressed her disappointment, on air, to Drescher's remarks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/bestoftv/2008/07/23/lkl.whoopi.word.cnn/ | work=CNN | title=CNN.com Video | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Season 12 (2008–09)==
''The View'' season started the first week of September and was heavily focused on the events related to the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election]] with attention towards the issues affecting women in particular and more broadly, the United States. They closely followed Senator [[Hillary Clinton]]'s campaign in the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Democratic presidential nomination race]]. Clinton won more primaries and delegates than any other female candidate in American history, but after a long campaign, Senator [[Barack Obama]] became the party's [[presumptive nominee]] in June 2008 and Clinton endorsed him. Likewise attention was focused when Senator [[John McCain]] chose [[Sarah Palin]] as his [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Vice President of the United States|vice-presidential]] running mate in August 2008. Palin is the first female vice presidential pick on a major party ticket since [[Geraldine Ferraro]] in [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984]], and the first in the history of the Republican Party.&lt;ref name = &quot;CNN_VP_20080829&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/08/29/palin.republican.vp.candidate/index.html|title= McCain picks Alaska governor as running mate|date=2008-08-29|accessdate=2008-08-29 | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Palin was largely unknown outside of [[Alaska]] prior to her selection by McCain, her personal life, [[Political positions of Sarah Palin|political positions]], [[Public image and reception of Sarah Palin|public image and reception]] all became the focus of intense media attention and scrutiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://newsminer.com/news/2008/sep/03/alaska-delegates-see-more-republican-convention-at/

Political comedian [[Bill Maher]]'s September visit made Elisabeth Hasselbeck visibly uncomfortable with his disparaging comments about Palin and his [[Agnosticism|agnostic]] views which is counter to Hasselbeck's conservative Christian beliefs. He was also promoting his upcoming film ''[[Religulous]]'' which is a satirical documentary that questions the concept of [[religion]] and the perceived problems it brings about.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =[[Larry King|King, Larry]] | title =Bill Maher Discusses Religulous on Larry King | work =[[Larry King Live]] | publisher =CNN | date =August 20, 2008 | url =http://www.cnn.com/video/#/video/bestoftv/2008/08/20/lkl.bill.maher.cnn | accessdate = 2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another discussion, Palin's comments regarding the age of Senator [[Joe Biden]], the Democratic running mate of Obama, prompted Barbara Walters to ask Hasselbeck about Palin's experience and therefore qualification to run the United States. The back and forth ended when they went to commercial break but other media outlets tied the tension to reported rumors that Hasselbeck would be leaving for [[Fox News]] and former ''View'' auditioner [[Rachel Campos-Duffy]] had been contacted about returning as a guest co-host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2008/10/the-view-elisab.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Show Tracker | date=October 1, 2008 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Contact Kyle Buchanan: Comment |url=http://defamer.com/5052527/one-more-tsk-from-barbara-walters-and-elisabeth-hasselbeck-will-head-for-fox-news |title=One More 'Tsk' From Barbara Walters and Elisabeth Hasselbeck Will Head For Fox News |publisher=Defamer.com |date=2008-09-19 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political wardrobe===
Hasselbeck, who has continually advocated for the Bush Administration during his time in office, also did the same for McCain and Palin during the election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics/AP/story/743058.html ''In Florida, Palin draws cheers bashing critics'']{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Munzenrieder |first=Kyle |url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/riptide/2008/10/elizabeth_hasselbeck_dumbs_dow.php |title='&amp;#39;Elizabeth Hasselbeck Dumbs Down the Florida Electorate'&amp;#39; |publisher=Blogs.miaminewtimes.com |date=2008-10-27 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''CNN'' noted the tension between Hasselbeck and the other hosts as arguments that escalated after the &quot;hard-hitting&quot; interview they did with McCain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/10/23/view-co-host-hitting-the-trail/ |title='&amp;#39;View co-host hitting the trail'&amp;#39; |publisher=Politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com |date=2008-10-23 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hasselbeck designed and wore a pro-McCain (&quot;Great AmeriCain Hero&quot;) t-shirt which caused the show to field a large number of complaints.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFCG&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Anderson |first=Tania |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/shoptoit/2008/10/shopping_for_campaign_gear.html |title='&amp;#39;Shopping for Campaign Gear'&amp;#39; |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heisey |first=Monica |url=http://www.queensjournal.ca/story/2008-10-28/postscript/marketing-democracy-and-punning-politics/ |title='&amp;#39;Marketing democracy and punning on politics: This Election season, consumers and supporters are wearing their hearts — and their political views — on their sleeves'&amp;#39; |publisher=Queensjournal.ca |date=2008-10-28 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;THEHWHO&quot;/&gt; The following day Walters noted that it was a political advertisement and not appropriate after the &quot;Hot Topics&quot; segment had finished.&lt;ref name=&quot;THEHWHO&quot;/&gt; Hasselbeck's design was later given to raise funds at McCain's election website.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFCG&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;THEHWHO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=October 23, 2008&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp; 6:14 pm |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/showtracker/2008/10/elisabeth-has-3.html |title='&amp;#39;'The View's' Elisabeth Hasselbeck wears heart on her sleeve, and T-shirt'&amp;#39; |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date=2008-10-23 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hasselbeck was noted as the celebrity designer for McCain in contrast to [[Beyoncé Knowles|Beyoncé]] and [[Tina Knowles]] ([[House of Deréon]]) for the Obama campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article/article?f=/c/a/2008/10/30/DDM813P201.DTL ''What's in store - candidate merchandise''] Accompanying this article is a chart showing the campaigns and celebrity designers.&lt;/ref&gt; Another clothing issue, in regards to Palin, was being discussed at the same time.

===Post-election same-sex marriage issues===

[[Same-sex marriage]] issues became a source of heated exchange. The co-hosts are somewhat split in the views with two on either side of the issue and Walters maintaining journalistic neutrality. One such election result was the passing of California's [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]], which defined that only marriages between a man and a woman would be valid or recognized in the state of California. The co-hosts had differing views on the many intertwined issues and outcomes of the election, as well as the protests and legal issues that continue to generate media attention. Hasselbeck and Shepherd both support the proposition, with Shepherd stating she defends a Biblical definition of marriage, although she was unable to explain what that entailed when asked by the other hosts.&lt;ref name=&quot;PEV&quot;&gt;{{cite episode | title = Post-election views   | series = The View    | airdate = 2008-11-05   | season = 12   | number =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Behar and Goldberg both opposed the proposition, with Goldberg correcting some misinformation from Hasselbeck and Shepherd;&lt;ref name=&quot;PEV&quot;/&gt; Goldberg also took part in New York City's protest against the proposition's passage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thedailyvoice.com/voice/2008/11/blacks-and-gays-debate-gay-mar-001349.php ''Blacks and gays debate gay marriage'']{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.queerty.com/10000-new-yorkers-turn-out-to-protest-prop-8-20081113/ |title='&amp;#39;10,000 New Yorkers Turn Out to Protest Prop. 8'&amp;#39; |publisher=Queerty.com |date=2008-11-13 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The continued unfolding events surrounding the legal challenges to the measure and protests have remained a subject of many &quot;Hot Topics&quot; discussions and regularly brought up in interviews.

===Hasselbeck/Andrews controversy===
On the May 4 episode, during a discussion on the latest episode of ''[[Dancing with the Stars]]'', Hasselbeck commented on the outfits worn by [[Erin Andrews]], who had recently been involved in an invasion of privacy incident in which a peeping tom videotaped her in the nude through a Hotel room hole, saying &quot;If I were this guy, I would think 'Man, I could have just waited 12 more weeks and I could see her half-nude for free.'&quot; Andrews' DWTS co-stars addressed the issue hours later, with her DWTS partner Maksim Chmerkovskiy saying &quot;I'm the one designing Erin Andrews' dresses for the show, so I'll just assume that Hasselbeck is jealous...and stupid for her comments.&quot; Co-star [[Niecy Nash]] also came to Andrews' defense, via her [[Twitter]] account, saying &quot;Elizabeth (sic) Hasselbeck's comments about Erin Andrews are insensitive, in poor taste and remedial and foolish.&quot; Hasselbeck began to cry while apologizing for her comments the next day, saying that after her daughter asked her what's wrong, she said, &quot;Well, Mommy hurt someone's feelings today,&quot; and also saying, &quot;I just wanted to say I'm really sorry... I don't like to hurt somebody, so I am sorry.&quot; Andrews has since stated however, that she never spoke with Hasselbeck.&lt;ref name=&quot;USA Today&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2010/05/erin-andrews-never-talked-to-elisabeth-hasselbeck/1 |title=Erin Andrews never talked to Elisabeth Hasselbeck |publisher=Content.usatoday.com |date=2010-05-12 |accessdate=2012-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===African-American HIV discussion===
On the June 22 episode, during a conversation on African-Americans and [[HIV/AIDS]], comedian and actor [[D. L. Hughley]], who was substituting for Goldberg, stated, &quot;When you look at the prevalence of HIV in the African-American community, it's primarily from young women who are getting it from men who are on [[Down-low (sexual slang)#HIV/AIDS|the down low]].&quot; The [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation]] (GLAAD) criticized Hughley for disseminating incorrect information, specifically about bisexual men infecting women, and printed his comment in ''[[Daily Variety]]'', where they asked readers to voice their outrage to the network. Hughley, Shepherd, and ABC did not comment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fancast.com/blogs/2010/tv-news/the-view-blasted-by-glaad-for-comments-on-african-americans-and-hiv/?cmpid=FCST_hero 'The View' Blasted by GLAAD for Comments on African Americans and HIV | Fancast News]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mel Gibson discussion===
On the July 12 episode, the co-hosts were discussing the recordings of actor [[Mel Gibson]], in which the actor goes on a rant to his ex-girlfriend. After Behar accused Gibson of being racist, after Gibson used the N-word in one of the recordings, Goldberg said that, having spent time with Gibson and having had Gibson around her children, the actor was not a racist. Goldberg made headlines for these comments because many people believed that she was condoning what Gibson had done.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fancast.com/blogs/2010/tv-news/whoopi-goldberg-mel-gibson-is-a-bonehead-not-a-racist/ Whoopi Goldberg: Mel Gibson Is a 'Bonehead,' Not a Racist | Fancast News]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, Goldberg addressed the issue once again, saying &quot;If you had actually watched the show [on Monday], you would have seen that I said I did not condone what [Mel Gibson] did,&quot; Goldberg continued &quot;I don't think this is right, I don't think this is smart, but...my experience tells me he's not a racist.&quot; Goldberg also went on to say, &quot;Being a black woman, you'd think [I'd get] a bit of leeway to have some feel if I was around a racist.&quot; Goldberg even called out a viewer who had called her headquarters and &quot;went off on the lady who works there.&quot; To those people, she marveled &quot;Who are 'you?'&quot; adding &quot;you can kiss my behind&quot; and went on to call the viewer a &quot;cowardly piece of dog mess.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fancast.com/blogs/2010/tv-news/whoopi-slams-viewer-who-harassed-her-assistant-over-mel-gibson-mess/ Whoopi Slams 'View'er Who Harassed Her Assistant Over Mel Gibson Mess | Fancast News]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joy Behar has since stated that Gibson will not be allowed on the show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fancast.com/blogs/2010/celebrities/joy-behar-mel-gibson-wont-be-allowed-on-the-view/ Joy Behar: Mel Gibson Won't Be Allowed On 'The View' | Fancast News]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bill O'Reilly argument===
On the episode airing October 14, 2010, guest [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] brought up the proposed Muslim Cultural Center to be built in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory?id=11883004 NY Mosque Argument on 'The View' Leads to Walk-Off - ABC News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion quickly grew into a debate, as Goldberg and Behar grilled O'Reilly. Moments into the discussion, Behar began mocking O'Reilly, and called him a &quot;pinhead&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/television/2802862,bill-oreilly-the-view-whoopi-behar-101410.article | work=Chicago Sun-Times | first=Lauran | last=Berta | title=Goldberg, Behar storm off 'The View' as Bill O'Reilly argues the NYC mosque | date=October 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Reilly continued speaking, and said &quot;Muslims killed us on 9/11!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2010/10/14/hosts-walk-view-argument-oreilly-ground-zero-mosque/ | work=Fox News | title=Two Hosts Walk Off 'The View' During Argument With Bill O'Reilly About 'Ground Zero Mosque' | date=October 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Behar stood from her seat, and followed Goldberg off the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/14/oreilly-comments-lead-to-walk-off-at-the-view/?src=mv | work=The New York Times | first=Dave | last=Itzkoff | title=O'Reilly Comments Lead to Walk Off at ‘The View' | date=October 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The immediate audience applause was stopped by Walters who settled the argument by stating, &quot;You have just seen what should not happen. We should be able to have discussions without washing our hands, and screaming, and walking offstage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/10/14/joy-behar-whoopi-goldberg_n_762844.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Jack | last=Mirkinson | title=Joy Behar, Whoopi Goldberg Walk Off 'The View' After Fiery Exchange With Bill O'Reilly (VIDEO) | date=October 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walters then demanded an apology from O'Reilly, who agreed to do so.

A blogger at ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' referred to the controversial argument as &quot;an angry, bleeped-out shouting match.&quot; The following Monday, the co-hosts each made statements, the most notable of which being Walters, who repeated her comments from Thursday, Goldberg saying she felt that if she hadn't walked off she would have cursed further and Hasselbeck coming to the complete defense of her co-hosts by saying that people should be careful when labeling others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://tunedin.blogs.time.com/2010/10/14/oreilly-view-hosts-throw-down-on-set/ | work=Time | date=October 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Camille Grammer interview===
On the January 31 episode of the show, ''[[Real Housewives of Beverly Hills]]'' star, and soon-to-be ex-wife of [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Camille Grammer]] came on to discuss rumors and the &quot;villainous&quot; portrayal of her on the show. The interview then turned to Camille and her divorce from Kelsey Grammer, and co-host Barbara Walters asked Grammer why she was surprised Kelsey cheated on her with another woman after Camille revealed she and Kelsey had not had sex for more than two years. Though Camille did not seem bothered by the question, Walters question led many viewers, and some audience members to become upset with Walters. Walters has yet to address the line of questioning on air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fancast.com/blogs/2011/tv-news/barbara-walters-hammers-camille-grammer-over-sexless-marriage-comment/?cmpid=FCST_tvnew ]{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

New segments have included a weekly recap of celebrity tweets that includes the co-host sharing some of their own tweets. Sherri and Elisabeth now do a weekly recap of the weeks reality televisions moments on Thursdays.

During the NBA lockout Sherri and Elisabeth introduced a new segment called &quot;Bad Basketball&quot; in an attempt to end the lockout. They would invite audience members to throw baskets at the end of hot topics, and later in the show, guests of the show and other co-hosts would often join in.

Every Friday when Barbara is off, ''The View'' has &quot;Guy Day Friday&quot;, during which a male co-host subs.

===Shepherd/Walters Debate over N-Word===
On the October 3rd episode, the ladies were discussing the recent controversy over Republican Presidential Candidate [[Herman Cain]] and his use of the word &quot;[[nigger]]&quot;. While introducing the topic, Goldberg used the word. Later, while giving her opinion on the subject, Walters also used the word, an act which Shepherd stated made her feel uncomfortable. When asked why it was ok for Goldberg to use it and not Walters, Shepherd said that she did not feel it was ok for white people to use the word. Walters then said that she did not know Shepherd had felt this way. The two then got into a heated discussion over Walters' use of the word, in which at one point Shepherd told Walters that the two &quot;could have dinner to discuss it if she wanted to&quot;. After the commercial break, the two addressed the argument, in which Shepherd said that she respected that she could state her opinion on ''The View'', while still being allowed to remain on the program and still remain friends with the ladies.

===2012 Election===
As a repeat of the Presidential Election of 2008, The co-hosts often talk about the political candidates and have them on the show. Most notable was when [[New Jersey]] Governor [[Chris Christie]] was rumored to be running for President. The co-hosts were quick to ask the question if America would elect a fat man President. So far [[Jon Huntsman, Jr.|Jon Huntsman]], [[Herman Cain]], and [[Mitt Romney]] have visited the show to talk about their campaigns.
