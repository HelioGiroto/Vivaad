'''Chester Trent Lott, Sr.''' (born October 9, 1941), is a former [[United States Senator]] from [[Mississippi]], who served in numerous leadership positions in both the [[United States House of Representatives]] and the Senate.
He entered Congress as one of the first of a wave of [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] winning seats in Southern states that had been solidly [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]. He became [[Senate Majority Leader]], then fell from power after praising [[Strom Thurmond]]'s 1948 [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregationist]] [[Dixiecrat]] presidential bid.

Lott entered Congress in 1968 as an administrative assistant to Representative [[William M. Colmer]] of Mississippi, who was also the chairman of the [[House Rules Committee]]. Upon Colmer's retirement, Lott won Colmer's former seat in the House of Representatives. In 1988, Lott ran successfully for the U.S. Senate to replace another retiree, [[John Stennis]]. After Republicans took the majority in the Senate, Lott became [[Senate Majority Whip]] in 1995 and then Senate Majority Leader in 1996, upon the resignation of presidential nominee [[Bob Dole]] of [[Kansas]].

On December 20, 2002, after significant controversy following comments regarding [[Strom Thurmond]]'s presidential candidacy, Lott resigned as [[Senate Minority Leader]]. In December 2007, he resigned from the Senate and became a Washington-based [[lobbyist]]. Republican [[Roger Wicker]] won the [[United States Senate special election in Mississippi, 2008|2008 special election]] to replace him.

Lott serves as a Senior Fellow at the [[Bipartisan Policy Center]] (BPC), where he focuses on issues related to energy, national security, transportation and congressional reforms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bipartisanpolicy.org/news/press-releases/2011/02/bipartisan-policy-center-welcomes-former-senate-majority-leader-trent-lo The Bipartisan Policy Center Welcomes Former Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott]&lt;/ref&gt; Lott is also a co-chair of BPC's Energy Project.

==Early life==
Lott was born in [[Grenada, Mississippi|Grenada]] in northern Mississippi. His father, Chester Paul Lott, was a [[shipyard]] worker; his mother, the former Iona Watson, was a [[Teacher|schoolteacher]]. He attended college at the [[University of Mississippi]] in [[Oxford, Mississippi|Oxford]], where he obtained an undergraduate degree in [[public administration]] in 1963 and a [[juris doctor|law degree]] in 1967. He served as a field representative for Ole Miss and was president of his [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]], [[Sigma Nu]]. Lott was also an Ole Miss [[cheerleader]], on the same team with future U.S. Senator [[Thad Cochran]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/olemiss010799.htm | work=The Washington Post | date=January 8, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; He married Patricia Thompson on December 27, 1964. The couple has two children: Chester Trent &quot;Chet&quot; Lott, Jr., and Tyler Lott.

==Political career==
Lott's success as a legislator was already evident in his undergraduate years at [[Ole Miss]]. Lott led the effort at the 1962 national convention of the [[Sigma Nu]] fraternity to defeat the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955â€“1968)|Civil Rights era]] amendment proposed by the [[Stanford]] and [[Brown University]] chapters to end mandatory racial exclusion by the fraternity.  Lott's side prevailed 215 to 76, and Stanford's chapter subsequently seceded from the fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,399310,00.html | work=Time | first=Karen | last=Tumulty | title=Trent Lott's Segregationist College Days | date=December 12, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===House of Representatives===
He served as administrative assistant to [[U.S. House Committee on Rules|House Rules Committee]] chairman [[William M. Colmer]], also of [[Pascagoula, Mississippi|Pascagoula]], from 1968 to 1972.

In 1972, Colmer, one of the most [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] Democrats in the House, announced his retirement after 40 years in Congress. He endorsed Lott as his successor in Mississippi's [[Mississippi's 5th congressional district|5th District]], located in the state's southwestern tip, even though Lott ran as a Republican. Lott won handily, in large part due to [[Richard Nixon]]'s landslide victory in that year's presidential election.  Nixon won the 5th district with an astonishing 87 percent of the vote; it was his strongest congressional district in the entire nation.&lt;ref&gt;Barone, Michael; et. al. ''The Almanac of American Politics'' (1976), p. 465.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lott and his future Senate colleague, Thad Cochran (also elected to Congress that year), were only the second and third Republicans elected to Congress from Mississippi since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. Lott's strong showing in the polls landed him on the powerful [[House Judiciary Committee]] as a freshman, where he voted against all three articles of impeachment drawn up against Nixon during the committee's debate. After Nixon released the infamous &quot;smoking gun&quot; transcripts (which proved Nixon's involvement in the [[Watergate]] cover-up), however, Lott announced that he would vote to impeach Nixon when the articles came up for debate before the full House (as did the other Republicans who voted against impeachment in committee).

[[Image:Gingrich and Lott.jpg||thumb|left|Sen. Trent Lott with Former [[Speaker of the House]] Rep. [[Newt Gingrich]] (R-GA) at the [[2004 Republican National Convention]]; both Lott and Gingrich provided consistent support to President [[George W. Bush]].]]

Lott became very popular in his district, even though almost none of its living residents had been represented by a Republican before. As evidence, in November 1974, Lott won a second term in a blowout. Cochran was also reelected in a rout; he and Lott were the first Republicans to win a second term in Congress from the state since Reconstruction. They were among the few bright spots in a year that saw many Republicans turned out of office due to anger over Watergate.  Lott was re-elected six more times without much difficulty, and even ran unopposed in 1978. In [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980]], he served as [[Ronald Reagan]]'s Mississippi state chairman.&lt;ref&gt;Kornacki, Steve (2011-02-03) [http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2011/02/03/reagan_southern_strategy/index.html The &quot;Southern Strategy&quot;, fulfilled], ''[[Salon.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He served as [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Whip]] (the second-ranking Republican in the House) from 1981 to 1989; he was the first Southern Republican to hold such a high leadership position.

===United States Senate===
Lott ran for the Senate in 1988, after 42-year incumbent [[John Stennis]] announced he would not run for another term. He defeated Democratic [[Mississippi's 4th congressional district|4th District]] Congressman [[Wayne Dowdy]] by almost eight points. He never faced another contest nearly that close. He was re-elected in 1994, 2000, and 2006 with no substantive Democratic opposition. He gave some thought to retirement for much of 2005, however, after [[Hurricane Katrina]], he announced on January 17, 2006 that he would run for a fourth term.

He became [[Assistant party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Majority Whip]] when the Republicans took control of the Senate in 1995, succeeding as [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Majority Leader]] in 1996 when [[Bob Dole]] resigned from the Senate to focus on his presidential campaign. As majority leader, Lott had a major role in the Senate trial following the [[impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment]] of President [[Bill Clinton]]. After the House narrowly voted to impeach Clinton, Lott proceeded with the Senate trial in early 1999, despite criticisms that Republicans were far short of the two-thirds majority required under the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] to convict Clinton and remove him from office. He later agreed to a decision to suspend the proceedings after the Senate voted not to convict Clinton.

Lott generally pursued a conservative position in politics and was a noted [[social conservative]]. For instance, in 1998, Lott caused some controversy in Congress when as a guest on the [[Armstrong Williams]] television show, he equated [[homosexuality]] to [[alcoholism]], [[kleptomania]] and [[sex addiction]]. When Williams, a conservative talk show host, asked Lott whether homosexuality is a [[sin]], Lott simply replied, &quot;Yes, it is.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mitchell&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03EFDC133DF934A25755C0A96E958260 |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=Controversy Over Lott's Views of Homosexuals |first=Alison |last=Mitchell |date=June 17, 1998 |accessdate=2008-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lott's stance against homosexuality was disconcerting to many Americans, and various media outlets questioned his views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E03EFDC133DF934A25755C0A96E958260 Controversy Over Lott's Views of Homosexuals] June 17, 1998, from [http://www.nytimes.com/ The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2000 elections produced a 50-50 partisan split in the Senate, [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Al Gore]]'s tie-breaking vote gave the Democrats the majority from January 3 to January 20, 2001, when [[George W. Bush]] took office and Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]'s tie-breaking vote gave the Republicans the majority once again. Later in 2001, he became [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate Minority Leader]] again after Vermont senator [[Jim Jeffords]] became an independent and caucused with the Democrats, allowing them to regain the majority. He was due to become majority leader again in early 2003 after Republican gains in the November 2002 elections.

====Resignation from Senate leadership====
Trent Lott spoke on December 5, 2002 at the 100th birthday party of Sen. [[Strom Thurmond]] of South Carolina, a long time conservative leader. Thurmond had run for [[President of the United States]] in 1948 on the [[Dixiecrat]] (or States' Rights) ticket. Lott said: &quot;When Strom Thurmond ran for president, we voted for him. Weâ€™re proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these problems over the years, either.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A37288-2002Dec10 | work=The Washington Post | title=Lott Remarks on Thurmond Echoed 1980 Words | first1=Thomas B. | last1=Edsall | first2=Brian | last2=Faler | date=December 11, 2002 | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thurmond had based his presidential campaign largely on an explicit [[States' Rights]] platform that challenged the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and later, the [[Civil Rights Act]] as illegally overturning the [[Separation of powers under the United States Constitution]] and called for the preservation of [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]].  ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that Lott had made similar comments about Thurmond's candidacy in a 1980 rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A37288-2002Dec10?language=printer | work=The Washington Post | accessdate=May 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lott gave an interview with [[Black Entertainment Television]] explaining himself and repudiating Thurmond's former views.&lt;ref name=cnnbet&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/12/13/lott.transcript/index.html Transcript of Lott interview on BET], December 13, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of controversy, Lott resigned as Senate Republican Leader on December 20, 2002, effective at the start of the next session, January 3, 2003. [[Bill Frist]] of [[Tennessee]] was later elected to the leadership position. In the book ''[[Free Culture (book)|Free Culture]]'', [[Lawrence Lessig]] argues that Lott's resignation would not have occurred had it not been for the effect of Internet [[blog]]s. He says that though the story &quot;disappear[ed] from the mainstream press within forty-eight hours&quot;, &quot;bloggers kept researching the story&quot; until, &quot;[f]inally, the story broke back into the mainstream press.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;lessig&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Lessig |first=Larry |title=Free Culture: How Big Media Uses Technology and the Law to Lock Down Culture and Control Creativity |year=2004 |isbn=1-59420-006-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lott Portrait.jpg|thumb|175px|Lott's official Senate portrait]]
After losing the Majority Leader post, Lott was less visible on the national scene, although he did break with some standard [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] positions.  He battled with Bush over military base closures in his home state. He showed support for passenger rail initiatives, notably his 2006 bipartisan introduction, with Sen. [[Frank Lautenberg]] of [[New Jersey]], of legislation to provide 80 percent federal matching grants to intercity rail and guarantee adequate funding for [[Amtrak]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ranting&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2006/04/30/ING4PIGEQC1.DTL |title=Ranting about rail |work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |date=April 30, 2006 |first=Tim |last=Holt |accessdate=2008-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 18, 2006, Lott voted with 19 Republican senators for the [[Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act]] to lift restrictions on federal funding for the research. On November 15, 2006 Lott regained a leadership position in the Senate, when he was named Minority Whip after defeating [[Lamar Alexander]] of [[Tennessee]] 24-23.&lt;ref name=rejoins&gt;{{cite news |last=Babington |first=Charles |title=Lott Rejoins Senate Leadership |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/15/AR2006111500533.html |accessdate=2007-12-21 |date=November 16, 2006 |work=[[Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senator [[John E. Sununu]] (R) of [[New Hampshire]] said, after Lott's election as Senate Minority Whip, &quot;He understands the rules. He's a strong negotiator.&quot; Former [[House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]] (R) said he's &quot;the smartest legislative politician I've ever met.&quot;&lt;ref name=revival&gt;{{cite news |last=Calabresi |first=Massimo |title=The Revival of Trent Lott |date=November 19, 2006 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1561139,00.html |work=[[Time Magazine]] |accessdate=2007-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2006 re-election campaign ====
{{Main|United States Senate election in Mississippi, 2006}}
Lott faced no Republican opposition in the race. State representative [[Erik R. Fleming]] placed first of four candidates in the June Democratic primary, but did not receive the 50 percent of the vote required to earn the party's nomination. Fleming and second-place finisher Bill Bowlin faced off in a runoff on June 27, and Fleming won with 65% of the vote. Fleming, however, was not regarded as a serious opponent, and Lott handily defeated him with 64% of the vote.

====Resignation====
On November 26, 2007, Lott announced that he would resign his Senate seat by the end of 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc-resign-11-26-2007&quot;&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21973397/ Trent Lott announces his resignation] MSNBC.com&lt;/ref&gt; According to CNN, his resignation was at least partly due to the [[Honest Leadership and Open Government Act]], which forbids lawmakers from lobbying for two years after leaving office. Those who leave by the end of 2007 are covered by the previous law, which demands a wait of only one year.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnnresignation&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/11/26/lott.resign/index.html |title= Senate's No. 2 Republican to resign by end of year |date=November 26, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-01 |work=[[CNN.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview regarding his resignation, Lott said that the new law &quot;didn't have a big role&quot; on his decision to resign.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.democracynow.org/2007/11/29/is_trent_lott_leaving_senate_to&lt;/ref&gt;

Lott's resignation became effective at 11:30 p.m. on December 18, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?parm1=5&amp;docID=news-000002646810&lt;/ref&gt;
On January 7, 2008 it was announced that Lott and former Senator [[John Breaux]] of [[Louisiana]], a Democrat, opened their lobbying firm about a block from the White House.&lt;ref name=&quot;clarionledger&quot; &gt;{{cite news |title=Lott joins heavy lawmaker-to-lobbyist trend |first=Ana |last=Radelat |url=http://www.clarionledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080108/NEWS/801080363/1001/NEWS |work=[[Clarion-Ledger]] |date=January 8, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current work==
Lott now works at the Breaux Lott Leadership Group, a &quot;strategic advice, consulting, and lobbying&quot; firm.&lt;ref name=&quot;open secrets&quot;&gt;[http://www.opensecrets.org/revolving/rev_summary.php?id=70566 OpenSecrets.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breauxlott.com/ Breaux Lott Leadership Group]&lt;/ref&gt; He also serves on the board of directors of [[EADS]] North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;open secrets&quot;/&gt;

On October 10, 2008, Lott was named Honorary Patron of the [[University Philosophical Society]], [[Trinity College, Dublin]].

Lott is a 3rd Degree [[Freemason]] and holds the Grand Cross in The Southern Masonic Jurisdiction.

===Richard Scruggs controversy===
On November 29, 2007, ''[[The New York Times]]'' noted that Lott's brother-in-law, [[Richard Scruggs]], was indicted on charges of offering a $40,000 bribe to a [[Mississippi]] state judge in a fee dispute. Scruggs represented Lott and then Representative [[Gene Taylor (Mississippi)|Gene Taylor]] in settlements with [[State Farm Insurance]] company  after the insurer refused to pay claims for the loss of their Mississippi homes in [[Hurricane Katrina]].

==Author==
Lott's memoir, entitled ''[[Herding Cats: A Life in Politics]]'', was published in 2005. In the book, Lott spoke out on the remark he made at the Strom Thurmond birthday party, former Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist, and about his feelings of betrayal toward the Tennessee senator, claiming &quot;If Frist had not announced exactly when he did, as the fire was about to burn out, I would still be majority leader of the Senate today.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lott, ''[[Herding Cats: A Life in Politics]]'' (2005), p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; He also described former Democratic Leader [[Tom Daschle]] of [[South Dakota]] as trustworthy.&lt;ref&gt;Lott, ''Herding Cats: A Life In Politics'' (2005), p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; He also reveals that President [[George W. Bush]], thenâ€“Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]], and other GOP leaders played a major role in ending his career as Senate Republican Leader.&lt;ref&gt;Lott, ''Herding Cats: A Life In Politics'' (2005), pp. 271â€“272.&lt;/ref&gt;
