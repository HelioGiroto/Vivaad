'''Earvin''' &quot;'''Magic'''&quot; '''Johnson Jr.''' (born August 14, 1959) is a retired American professional [[basketball]] player who played [[point guard]] for the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). After winning championships in [[High school basketball#U.S. high school basketball|high school]] and [[College basketball|college]], Johnson was selected first overall in the [[1979 NBA Draft]] by the Lakers. He won a championship and an [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award]] in his rookie season, and won four more championships with the Lakers during the 1980s. Johnson retired abruptly in 1991 after announcing that he had contracted [[HIV]], but returned to play in the [[1992 NBA All-Star Game|1992 All-Star Game]], winning the [[NBA All-Star Game Most Valuable Player Award|All-Star MVP Award]]. After protests from his fellow players, he retired again for four years, but returned in 1996, at age 36, to play 32&amp;nbsp;games for the Lakers before retiring for the third and final time.

Johnson's career achievements include three [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|NBA MVP Awards]], nine [[NBA Finals]] appearances, twelve [[List of NBA All-Stars|All-Star]] games, and ten [[All-NBA Team|All-NBA]] First and Second Team nominations. He led the league in regular-season [[assist (basketball)|assists]] four times, and is the NBA's all-time leader in average assists per game, at 11.2.&lt;ref name=&quot;alltimeassist&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=All Time Leaders: Assists Per Game|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|url=http://www.nba.com/statistics/default_all_time_leaders/AllTimeLeadersAPGQuery.html?topic=4&amp;stat=10|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson was a member of the &quot;[[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]]&quot;, the U.S. basketball team that won the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Olympic]] gold medal in 1992.

Johnson was honored as one of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History]] in 1996, and enshrined in the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbafullbio&quot; /&gt; He was rated the greatest NBA point guard of all time by [[ESPN]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatestpg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=ESPN|title=Daily Dime: Special Edition&amp;nbsp;– The 10 Greatest Point Guards Ever|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/dailydime?page=dailydime-GreatestPointGuards|accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; His friendship and rivalry with [[Boston Celtics]] star [[Larry Bird]], whom he faced in the [[1979 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1979 NCAA finals]] and three NBA championship series, were well documented. Since his retirement, Johnson has been an advocate for HIV/[[AIDS]] prevention and [[safe sex]],&lt;ref name=&quot;nbafullbio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NBA Encyclopedia: Playoff Edition|title=Magic Johnson Bio|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/johnsonm_bio.html|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as an [[entrepreneur]],&lt;ref name=&quot;espnticket&quot;/&gt; [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.responsemagazine.com/responsemag/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=57850|title=Do You Believe in 'Magic'?|last=Haire|first=Thomas|date=May 1, 2003|publisher=Questex Media Group, Inc|work=Response Magazine|accessdate=2008-05-27| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061026094059/http://www.responsemagazine.com/responsemag/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=57850| archivedate = October 26, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[NBA Countdown|broadcaster]] and [[motivational speaker]].&lt;ref name=mot&gt;{{cite news|last=Springer|first=Steve|title=Magic's Announcement: 10 years later, a real survivor|work=Los Angeles Times| date=2001-11-07|page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson was a part-owner of the Lakers for several years, and was part of a group that purchased the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] in 2012.

==Amateur career==
===Early years===
Earvin Johnson Jr. was born to Earvin Sr., a [[General Motors]] assembly worker, and Christine, a school [[janitor|custodian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/educate/college/careers/profile42.htm|title=Rebounding from basketball court to boardroom|last=Eldridge|first=Earle|date=November 8, 2004|work=USA Today|accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson grew up in [[Lansing, Michigan]], and came to love basketball as a youngster, idolizing players such as [[Earl Monroe]] and [[Marques Haynes]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|coauthors=Novak|title=My Life|page=14|isbn=1-902799-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and practicing &quot;all day&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbafullbio&quot; /&gt;

Johnson was first dubbed &quot;Magic&quot; as a 15-year-old sophomore playing for Lansing's [[Everett High School (Michigan)|Everett High School]], when he recorded a [[triple-double]] of 36&amp;nbsp;[[point (basketball)|points]], 18&amp;nbsp;[[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] and 16&amp;nbsp;assists.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbafullbio&quot; /&gt; After the game, Fred Stabley Jr., a sports writer for the ''[[Lansing State Journal]]'', gave him the [[moniker]]&lt;ref name=&quot;magic&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeff|last=Zillgitt|title=Magic Memories of a Real Star|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/zillgitt/2002-09-27-zillgitt_x.htm|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Co. Inc|date=2002-09-27|accessdate=2007-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the belief of Johnson's mother, a Christian, that the name was sacrilegious.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbafullbio&quot; /&gt; In his final high school season, Johnson led Lansing Everett to a 27–1 win–loss record while averaging 28.8&amp;nbsp;points and&amp;nbsp;16.8 rebounds per game,&lt;ref name=&quot;nbafullbio&quot; /&gt; and took his team to an [[Overtime (sports)|overtime]] victory in the [[U.S. state|state]] championship game.&lt;ref name=&quot;espnshowtime&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Larry|last=Schwartz|title=Magic made Showtime a show|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00016111.html|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michigan State University===
Although Johnson was recruited by several top-ranked colleges such as [[Indiana University (Bloomington)|Indiana]] and [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]], he decided to play close to home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|coauthors=Novak|title=My Life|page=45|isbn=1-902799-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His college decision came down to the [[University of Michigan]] and [[Michigan State University]] in [[East Lansing]].  He ultimately decided to attend Michigan State when its coach [[Jud Heathcote]] told him he could play the [[point guard]] position. The talent already on Michigan State's roster also drew him to the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|coauthors=Novak|title=My Life|page=48|isbn=1-902799-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson did not initially aspire to play professionally, focusing instead on his [[communication studies]] [[Academic major|major]] and on his desire to become a television commentator.&lt;ref name=&quot;borkstars&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bork|publisher=Die großen Basketball Stars|year=1994|pages=56–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playing with future NBA draftees [[Greg Kelser]], [[Jay Vincent]] and [[Mike Brkovich]], Johnson averaged 17.0&amp;nbsp;points, 7.9&amp;nbsp;rebounds, and 7.4&amp;nbsp;assists per game as a [[First year|freshman]], and led the [[Michigan State Spartans|Spartans]] to a 25–5&amp;nbsp;record, the [[Big Ten Conference]] title, and a berth in the [[1978 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1978 NCAA Tournament]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nbafullbio&quot; /&gt; The Spartans reached the [[Elite Eight]], but lost narrowly to eventual national champion [[Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball|Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/ncaa-tournament/history/yearbyyear/1978
|title= 1978 NCAA Tournament|publisher=sportsline.com|accessdate=2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[1979 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1978–79 season]], Michigan State again qualified for the [[1979 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], where they advanced to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|championship game]] and faced [[Indiana State University]], which was led by senior [[Larry Bird]]. In what was the most-watched college basketball game ever,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/endofcentury/s/century/katz.html|title=From coast to coast, a magical pair|last=Katz|first=Andy|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2008-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michigan State defeated Indiana State 75–64, and Johnson was voted [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|Most Outstanding Player]] of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Final Four]].&lt;ref name=&quot;espnshowtime&quot; /&gt; After two years in college, during which he averaged 17.1&amp;nbsp;points, 7.6&amp;nbsp;rebounds, and 7.9&amp;nbsp;assists per game, Johnson was drafted in the [[1979 NBA Draft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|title=Magic Johnson Statistics|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/j/johnsma02.html|accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
===Rookie season in the NBA (1979–80)===
Johnson was [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|drafted first overall]] in 1979 by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]]. Johnson said that what was &quot;most amazing&quot; about joining the Lakers was the chance to play alongside [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|coauthors=Novak|title=My Life|page=113|isbn=1-902799-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the team's 7&amp;nbsp;ft 2&amp;nbsp;in (2.18&amp;nbsp;m) [[center (basketball)|center]] who became the leading scorer in NBA history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/records/regular_points.html|title=Regular Season Records: Points|publisher=NBA.com|accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Abdul-Jabbar's dominance, he had failed to win a championship with the Lakers, and Johnson was expected to help them achieve that goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;1980finals&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NBA Encyclopedia: Playoff Edition|title=Rookie Makes the Lakers Believe in Magic|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19791980.html|accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson averaged 18.0&amp;nbsp;points, 7.7&amp;nbsp;rebounds, and 7.3&amp;nbsp;assists per game for the season, was selected to the [[NBA All-Rookie Team]], and was named an [[NBA All-Star Game]] starter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/b/birdla01.html|title=Larry Bird Statistics|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lakers compiled a 60–22&amp;nbsp;record in the regular season and reached the [[1980 NBA Finals]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|title=1979–80 NBA Season Summary|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_1980.html|accessdate=2008-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which they faced the [[Philadelphia 76ers]], who were led by [[forward (basketball)|forward]] [[Julius Erving]]. The Lakers took a 3–2&amp;nbsp;lead in the series, but Abdul-Jabbar, who averaged 33&amp;nbsp;points a game in the series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1980_finals.html|title=1980 NBA Finals Composite Box Score|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; sprained his ankle in Game 5 and could not play in Game 6.&lt;ref name=&quot;1980finals&quot; /&gt; [[Paul Westhead]] decided to start Johnson at center in Game 6; Johnson recorded 42&amp;nbsp;points, 15&amp;nbsp;rebounds, 7&amp;nbsp;assists, and 3 [[steal (basketball)|steals]] in a 123–107 win, while playing guard, forward, and center at different times during the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;1980finals&quot; /&gt; Johnson became the only rookie to win the [[Bill Russell NBA Finals Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Finals MVP]] award,&lt;ref name=&quot;1980finals&quot; /&gt; and his clutch performance is still regarded as one of the finest in NBA history.&lt;ref name=&quot;greatestpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;1980nbafinals&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NBA Encyclopedia: Playoff Edition|title=NBA's Greatest Moments: Magic Fills in at Center|url=http://www.nba.com/history/magiccenter_moments.html|accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;playoffmoments&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/web/COM1053908/index.htm|title=Playoff moments can make legends|last=McCallum|first=Jack|date=2006-06-02|work=Sports Illustrated|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became one of four players to win NCAA and NBA championships in consecutive years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/nba/stories/2001-11-07-magic-timeline.htm|title=Magic Johnson timeline|date=2001-07-11|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Co.

===Ups and downs (1980–83)===
Early in the [[1980–81 NBA season|1980–81 season]], Johnson was sidelined after he suffered torn [[cartilage]] in his left knee. He missed 45&amp;nbsp;games,&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot; /&gt; and said that his [[Physical therapy|rehabilitation]] was the &quot;most down&quot; he had ever felt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|coauthors=Novak|title=My Life|page=135|isbn=1-902799-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson returned before the start of the [[1981 NBA Playoffs|1981 playoffs]], but the Lakers' then-assistant and future head coach [[Pat Riley]] later said Johnson's much-anticipated return made the Lakers a &quot;divided team&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Riley|first=Pat|title=The Winner Within|publisher=G.P. Putnam's Son|year=1993|page=48|isbn=978-0-425-14175-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 54-win Lakers faced the 40–42 [[Houston Rockets]] in the first round of playoffs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/HOU/|title=Houston Rockets|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/|title=Los Angeles Lakers|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=2009-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; where Houston upset the Lakers 2–1 after Johnson [[Air ball|airballed]] a last-second shot in Game 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE2DE163BF93BA35752C1A967958260|title=Sports of The Times; Magic Johnson's Legacy|last=Berkow|first=Ira|date=November 8, 1991|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, after the 1980-81 season, Johnson signed a 25-year, $25-million contract with the Lakers, which was the highest-paying contract in sports history up to that point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Hs9RAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-20DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2762,5761965&amp;dq|title=Johnson rubs LA's Magic lantern for 25 million bucks|date=27 June 1981|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|page=10|accessdate=12 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the [[1981–82 NBA season|1981–82 season]], Johnson had a heated dispute with Westhead, who Johnson said made the Lakers &quot;slow&quot; and &quot;predictable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|coauthors=Novak|title=My Life|page=141|isbn=1-902799-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Johnson demanded to be traded, Lakers owner [[Jerry Buss]] fired Westhead and replaced him with Riley.

===Battles against the Celtics (1983–87)===
[[Image:Magic Bird Lipofsky.jpg|thumb|upright|Johnson battling with Bird for rebounding position in Game 2 of the 1985 NBA Finals at [[Boston Garden]].]] 
In Johnson's [[1983–84 NBA season|fifth season]], he averaged a [[double-double]] of 17.6&amp;nbsp;points and 13.1&amp;nbsp;assists, as well as 7.3&amp;nbsp;rebounds per game.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot; /&gt; The Lakers reached the [[1984 NBA Finals|Finals]] for the third year in a row, where Johnson's Lakers and Bird's Celtics met for the first time in the post-season.&lt;ref name=&quot;1984finals&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NBA Encyclopedia: Playoff Edition|title=Celtics Win First Bird-Magic Finals Showdown|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19831984.html|accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lakers won the first game, and led by two points in Game 2 with 18&amp;nbsp;seconds to go, but after a [[layup]] by [[Gerald Henderson]], Johnson failed to get a shot off before the final buzzer sounded, and the Lakers lost 124–121 in overtime.&lt;ref name=&quot;1984finals&quot; /&gt; In Game 3, Johnson responded with 21&amp;nbsp;assists in a 137–104 win, but in Game 4, he again made several crucial errors late in the contest. In the final minute of the game, Johnson had the ball stolen by Celtics center [[Robert Parish]], and then missed two free throws that could have won the game. The Celtics won Game 4 in overtime, and the teams split the next two games. In the decisive Game 7 in Boston, as the Lakers trailed by three points in the final minute, opposing point guard [[Dennis Johnson]] stole the ball from Johnson, a play that effectively ended the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;1984finals&quot; /&gt; Friends [[Isiah Thomas]] and [[Mark Aguirre]] consoled him that night, talking until the morning in his Boston hotel room amidst fan celebrations on the street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lazenby |first=Roland |authorlink=Roland Lazenby |title=The Show: The Inside Story of the Spectacular Los Angeles Lakers in the Words of Those Who Lived It |page=237 |year=2006 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-0-07-143034-0 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HiH8z6EmSIsC&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;vq=balloons&amp;dq=the%20show%20roland%20lazenby&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thomsen&gt;{{cite news |last=Thomsen |first=Ian | title=Isiah blasts Magic Johnson over criticisms in forthcoming book |date=2009-10-22 |work=SI.com |publisher=Time Inc. |url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?expire=&amp;title=Isiah+Thomas+blasts+Magic+Johnson+over+criticisms+in+new+book+-+Ian+Thomsen+-+SI.com&amp;urlID=413209632&amp;action=cpt&amp;partnerID=678912&amp;fb=Y&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2F2009%2Fwriters%2Fian_thomsen%2F10%2F22%2Fisiah.magic%2Findex.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5yyPJP7i1 |archivedate=2011-05-26 |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Finals, Johnson averaged 18.0&amp;nbsp;points on .560&amp;nbsp;shooting, 13.6&amp;nbsp;assists, and 7.7&amp;nbsp;rebounds per game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1984_finals.html|title=1984 NBA Finals Composite Box Score|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson later described the series as &quot;the one championship we should have had but didn't get&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|coauthors=Novak|title=My Life|page=196|isbn=1-902799-01-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Repeat and falling short (1987–91)===
Before the [[1987–88 NBA season]], Lakers coach Pat Riley publicly promised that they would defend the NBA title, even though no team had won consecutive titles since the Celtics did so in the [[1969 NBA Finals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/rileyrepeat_moments.html|title=Riley Guarantees A Repeat|publisher=NBA Encyclopedia: Playoff Edition|accessdate=2008-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson had another productive season with averages of 19.6&amp;nbsp;points, 11.9&amp;nbsp;assists, and 6.2&amp;nbsp;rebounds per game.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot; /&gt; In the [[1988 NBA Playoffs|1988 playoffs]], the Lakers survived two 4–3&amp;nbsp;series against the [[Utah Jazz]] and the [[Dallas Mavericks]] to reach [[1988 NBA Finals|the Finals]] and face Thomas and the [[Detroit Pistons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NBA Encyclopedia: Playoff Edition|title=1988 Playoff Results|url=http://www.nba.com/history/playoffs/19871988.html|accessdate=2008-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; known as the &quot;Bad Boys&quot; for their physical style of play.&lt;ref name=&quot;laimbeer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NBA Encyclopedia: Playoff Edition|title=Bill Laimbeer career summary|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/laimbeer_summary.html|accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson and Thomas greeted each other with a kiss on the cheek before the [[opening tip]] of Game 1, which they called a display of brotherly love.&lt;ref name=thomsen/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lazenby |first=Roland |authorlink=Roland Lazenby |title=The Show: The Inside Story of the Spectacular Los Angeles Lakers in the Words of Those Who Lived It |page=261 |year=2006 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional |location=New York, New York |isbn=978-0-07-143034-0 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=HiH8z6EmSIsC&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;vq=balloons&amp;dq=the%20show%20roland%20lazenby&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gaydenial/&gt; After the teams split the first six games, Lakers forward and Finals MVP [[James Worthy]] had his first career [[triple-double]] of 36&amp;nbsp;points, 16&amp;nbsp;rebounds, and 10&amp;nbsp;assists, and led his team to a 108–105&amp;nbsp;win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/finals/19871988.html|title=Lakers Capture the Elusive Repeat|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite not being named MVP, Johnson had a strong championship series, averaging 21.1&amp;nbsp;points on .550&amp;nbsp;shooting, 13.0&amp;nbsp;assists, and 5.7&amp;nbsp;rebounds per game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basketball-reference.com/playoffs/NBA_1988_finals.html|title=1988 NBA Finals Composite Box Score|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=2008-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the fifth and final NBA championship of his career.

===HIV announcement and Olympics (1991–92)===
After a [[Physical examination|physical]] before the [[1991–92 NBA season]], Johnson discovered that he had tested positive for [[HIV]].

Despite his retirement, Johnson was voted by fans as a starter for the [[1992 NBA All-Star Game]] at [[Amway Arena|Orlando Arena]], although his former teammates [[Byron Scott (basketball)|Byron Scott]] and [[A.

Johnson was chosen to compete in the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] for the [[United States men's national basketball team|US basketball team]], dubbed the &quot;[[1992 United States men's Olympic basketball team|Dream Team]]&quot; because of the NBA stars on the roster.&lt;ref&gt;Ten of the 12 players on the team were named on the NBA's list of [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History|50 Greatest Players]]: {{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/dreamT_moments.html|title=The Original Dream Team|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the tournament, which the USA won,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/dreamT_moments.html|title=The Original Dream Team|publisher=NBA.com|accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson played infrequently because of knee problems, but he received [[standing ovation]]s from the crowd, and used the opportunity to inspire HIV-positive people.&lt;ref name=&quot;borkstars&quot; /&gt;

===Post-Olympics and later life===
Before the [[1992–93 NBA season]], Johnson announced his intention to stage an NBA comeback. After practicing and playing in several pre-season games, he returned to retirement before the start of the regular season, citing controversy over his return sparked by opposition from several active players.&lt;ref name=&quot;espnshowtime&quot; /&gt; During his retirement, Johnson has written a book on [[Safe sex|safer sex]], run several businesses, worked for [[NBC]] as a [[Color commentator|commentator]], and toured Asia, Australia and New Zealand with a basketball team that comprised former college and NBA players.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbafullbio&quot; /&gt;

He returned to the NBA as coach of the Lakers near the end of the [[1993–94 NBA season]], replacing [[Randy Pfund]].

===Media figure and business interests===
In 1998, Johnson hosted a late night talk show on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox network]] called ''[[The Magic Hour (talk show)|The Magic Hour]]'', but the show was canceled after two months because of low [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803EFD8103BF93BA3575BC0A96E958260|title='Magic Hour' Canceled|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=1998-08-08|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He runs Magic Johnson Enterprises, a company that has a net worth of $700&amp;nbsp;million;&lt;ref name=&quot;espnticket&quot; /&gt; its subsidiaries include Magic Johnson Productions, a promotional company; [[Magic Johnson Theaters]], a nationwide chain of movie theaters; and Magic Johnson Entertainment, a movie studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,83770,00.html|title=Magic Johnson joins the music biz|last=Walk|first=Gary Eng|date=October 7, 1998|work=Entertainment Weekly|accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson has also worked as a [[motivational speaker]].&lt;ref name=mot/&gt;  Johnson was an NBA commentator for [[Turner Network Television]] for seven years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnt.tv/title/?oid=623948-7425|title=NBA 05-06 TNT|publisher=TNT.tv|accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; before becoming a studio analyst for ESPN's ''[[NBA Countdown]]'' in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espnmediazone.com/press_releases/2008_10_oct/20081013_MagicJohnsonJoinsESPNasNBAStudioAnalyst.htm|title=Magic Johnson Joins ESPN as NBA Studio Analyst|date=October 13, 2008|publisher=ESPN Media Zone press release|accessdate=2008-10-15}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Johnson became a minority owner of the Lakers, having reportedly paid more than $10&amp;nbsp;million for part ownership.

===Politics===
Johnson is a supporter of the [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic Party]]—in 2006, he publicly endorsed [[Phil Angelides]] for [[governor of California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Magic Johnson backs Angelides for Governor|publisher=angelides.com|url=http://www.angelides.com/news/philinthenews/2005_1129_magic.html|date=2005-11-29|accessdate=2007-09-13|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071222073941/http://www.angelides.com/news/philinthenews/2005_1129_magic.html|archivedate=2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 he supported [[Hillary Clinton]] for [[president of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/election2008/2007-12-18-magic-clinton_N.htm|title=Magic Johnson, Bill Clinton team up for Hillary|date=December 20, 2007|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett Co.

===HIV activism===
[[Image:Magic Johnson and Nancy Pelosi.jpg|thumb|upright|right|alt=A middle-aged Caucasian woman shakes the hand of a tall black man.|In 2003, Johnson met with [[Nancy Pelosi]] to discuss federal assistance for those with [[AIDS]].]]

After announcing his infection in November 1991, Johnson created the [[Magic Johnson Foundation]] to help combat HIV,&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeafterdeath&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1023368/1/index.htm|title=Life After Death|last=McCallum|first=Jack|date=August 20, 2001|work=Sports Illustrated|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; although he later diversified the foundation to include other charitable goals.&lt;ref name=&quot;espnaids&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/gen/s/2001/1105/1274006.html|title=AIDS community misses old Magic act|last=Farrey|first=Tom|date=November 7, 2001|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, he joined the National Commission on AIDS, but left after eight months, saying that the commission was not doing enough to combat the disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeafterdeath&quot; /&gt; He was also the main speaker for the [[United Nations]] (UN) [[World AIDS Day]] Conference in 1999,&lt;ref name=&quot;espnaids&quot; /&gt; and has served as a [[United Nations Messengers of Peace|United Nations Messenger of Peace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9901EEDA1131F935A2575AC0A96E958260|title=Sports of The Times; The Greatest Is Honored by The Diplomat|last=Rhoden|first=William C.|date=September 16, 1998|work=The New York Times|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

HIV had been associated with drug addicts and homosexuals,&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeafterdeath&quot; /&gt; but Johnson's campaigns sought to show that the risk of infection was not limited to those groups. Johnson stated that his aim was to &quot;help educate all people about what [HIV] is about&quot; and teach others not to &quot;discriminate against people who have HIV and AIDS&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;espnaids&quot; /&gt; Johnson was later criticized by the AIDS community for his decreased involvement in publicizing the spread of the disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifeafterdeath&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;espnaids&quot; /&gt;

To prevent his HIV infection from progressing to AIDS, Johnson takes a [[Antiretroviral drug|daily combination of drugs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;misperception&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2006-11-30-magic-aids_x.htm|title=Magic Johnson combats AIDS misperceptions|last=Sternberg|first=Steve|date=November 30, 2006|work=USA Today|accessdate=2009-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has advertised [[GlaxoSmithKline]]'s drugs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/industries/health/drugs/2003-01-20-magic-glaxo_x.htm|title=Magic Johnson assists drugmaker to advertise HIV treatment|date=January 20, 2003|work=USA Today|accessdate=2009-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and partnered with [[Abbott Laboratories]] to publicize the fight against AIDS in African American communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;misperception&quot; /&gt;

In 905&amp;nbsp;NBA games, Johnson tallied 17,707&amp;nbsp;points, 6,559&amp;nbsp;rebounds, and 10,141&amp;nbsp;assists, translating to career averages of 19.5&amp;nbsp;points, 7.2&amp;nbsp;rebounds, and 11.2&amp;nbsp;assists per game, the highest assists per game average in NBA history.&lt;ref name=&quot;stats&quot; /&gt; Johnson shares the single-game playoff record for assists (24),&lt;ref name=&quot;assrec&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NBA Encyclopedia: Playoff Edition|title=Magic Johnson Career Stats|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/johnsonm_stats.html|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; holds the Finals record for assists in a game (21),&lt;ref name=&quot;assrec&quot; /&gt; and has the most playoff assists (2,346).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=NBA Encyclopedia: Playoff Edition|title=All-Time Playoffs Individual Career Leaders|url=http://www.nba.com/history/records/alltime_playoffs_ind_career.html|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds the All-Star Game single-game record for assists (22), and the All-Star Game record for career assists (127).&lt;ref name=&quot;assrec&quot; /&gt;
Johnson introduced a fast-paced style of basketball called &quot;Showtime&quot;, described as a mix of &quot;no-look passes off the [[fast break|fastbreak]], pin-point [[Alley-oop (basketball)|alley-oops]] from [[half court|halfcourt]], spinning feeds and overhand bullets under the basket through [[double team|triple teams]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nbafullbio&quot; /&gt; Fellow Lakers guard [[Michael Cooper]] said, &quot;There have been times when [Johnson] has thrown passes and I wasn't sure where he was going. Then one of our guys catches the ball and scores, and I run back up the floor convinced that he must've thrown it through somebody.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nbafullbio&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;espnshowtime&quot; /&gt; Johnson was exceptional because he played point guard despite being 6&amp;nbsp;ft 9&amp;nbsp;in (2.06&amp;nbsp;m), a size reserved normally for [[frontcourt]] players.&lt;ref name=&quot;nbafullbio&quot; /&gt; He combined the size of a power forward, the one-on-one skills of a [[swingman]], and the ball handling talent of a guard, making him one of the most dangerous [[triple-double]] threats of all time; his 138&amp;nbsp;triple-double games are second only to [[Oscar Robertson]]'s 181.&lt;ref name=&quot;tripledouble&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Wojnarowski|first=Adrian|title=Making triple trouble|date=2006-11-18|publisher=Yahoo!

For his feats, Johnson was voted as one of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History|50 Greatest Players of All Time]] by the NBA in 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/players/50greatest.html|title=The NBA at 50|work=NBA.com|publisher=Turner Sports Interactive, Inc|accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was inducted into the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://assets.espn.go.com/nba/news/2002/0605/1391196.html|title=Johnson, Brown elected to Hall of Fame|date=June 5, 2002|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2008-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; ESPN's ''SportsCentury'' ranked Johnson #17 in their &quot;50 Greatest Athletes of the 20th Century&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;#17: Magic Johnson&quot;.

===Rivalry with Larry Bird===
{{See also|Lakers–Celtics rivalry}}

Johnson and [[Larry Bird]] were first linked as rivals after Johnson's Michigan State squad defeated Bird's Indiana State team in the 1979 [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] finals. The rivalry continued in the NBA, and reached its climax when Boston and Los Angeles met in three out of four NBA Finals from 1984 to 1987. Johnson asserted that for him, the 82-game regular season was composed of 80 normal games, and two Lakers–Celtics games. Similarly, Bird admitted that Johnson's daily [[box score]] was the first thing he checked in the morning.&lt;ref name=&quot;magiclarryquotes&quot; /&gt;

Several journalists hypothesized that the Johnson–Bird rivalry was so appealing because it represented many other contrasts, such as the clash between the Lakers and Celtics, between Hollywood flashiness (&quot;Showtime&quot;) and Boston/Indiana [[Blue-collar worker|blue collar]] grit (&quot;Celtic Pride&quot;), and between blacks and whites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bork|title=Basketball Sternstunden|year=1995|pages=49–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/web/COM1057184/1/index.htm|title=The Stuff Dreams Are Made Of|last=Halberstam|first=David|date=1987-06-29|work=Sports Illustrated|publisher=Time Inc|accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rivalry was also significant because it drew national attention to the faltering NBA. Prior to Johnson and Bird's arrival, the NBA had gone through a decade of declining interest and low TV ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/09/26/earlyshow/leisure/main523385.shtml|title='Magic' Time|publisher=CBS News|date=2002-09-27|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the two future Hall of Famers, the league won a whole generation of new fans,&lt;ref name=&quot;cbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2002/08/14/magic020814.html|title=Larry Bird inducting Magic Johnson|publisher=CBC Sports|date=2002-08-15|accessdate=2008-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing both traditionalist adherents of Bird's dirt court Indiana game and those appreciative of Johnson's public park flair. Sports journalist Larry Schwartz of ESPN asserted that Johnson and Bird saved the NBA from bankruptcy.&lt;ref name=&quot;espnshowtime&quot; /&gt;

Despite their on-court rivalry, Johnson and Bird became close friends during the filming of a 1984 [[Converse (company)|Converse]] shoe advertisement that depicted them as enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aamidor|first=Abraham|title=Chuck Taylor, All Star: The True Story of the Man Behind the Most Famous Athletic Shoe in History|year=2006|page=151|isbn=0-253-34698-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/sportscentury/features/00014103.html|title=Eye for victory|last=Schwartz|first=Larry|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson appeared at Bird's retirement ceremony in 1992, and described Bird as a &quot;friend forever&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;magiclarryquotes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nba.com/history/Classic_NBA_Quotes_Magic_and_Larry.html|title=Classic NBA Quotes: Magic and Larry|publisher=NBA Encyclopedia: Playoff Edition|accessdate=2007-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; during Johnson's Hall of Fame ceremony, Bird formally inducted his old rival.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbc&quot; /&gt;
