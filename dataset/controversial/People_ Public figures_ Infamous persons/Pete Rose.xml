'''Peter Edward Rose''' (born April 14, 1941), nicknamed &quot;'''Charlie Hustle'''&quot;, is a former [[Major League Baseball]] player and [[Manager (baseball)|manager]]. Rose played from 1963 to 1986, and managed from 1984 to 1989.

Rose, a [[switch hitter]], is the all-time Major League leader in [[Hit (baseball)|hits]] (4,256), games played (3,562), [[at-bat]]s (14,053) and [[Out (baseball)|outs]] (10,328).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Guinness World Records |page=233 |year=2007 |publisher=[[HiT Entertainment]] |location=London; New York City |isbn=978-0-9735514-4-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He won three [[World Series]] rings, three [[Batting average|batting titles]], one [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|Most Valuable Player Award]], two [[Gold Glove]]s, the [[MLB Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year Award]], and made 17 [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] appearances at an unequaled five different positions ([[Second baseman|2B]], [[Left fielder|LF]], [[Right fielder|RF]], [[Third baseman|3B]] &amp; [[First baseman|1B]]).

In August 1989, three years after he retired as an active player, Rose agreed to [[List of Major League Baseball figures who have been banned for life|permanent ineligibility from baseball]] amidst accusations that he [[sports betting|gambled on baseball]] games while playing for and managing the Reds, including claims that he bet on his own team. In 1991, the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Baseball Hall of Fame]] formally voted to ban those on the &quot;permanently ineligible&quot; list from induction, after previously excluding such players by informal agreement among voters. In 2004, after years of public denial, Rose admitted to betting on baseball and on, but not against, the Reds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dowd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball1.com/bb-data/rose/dowd/dowd_cover.html|title=The Baseball Archive presents The Dowd Report|work=baseball1.com|date=May 9, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of Rose's possible re-instatement and election to the Hall of Fame remains a contentious one throughout baseball.

==Early life==
Rose was born April 14, 1941 in Cincinnati, Ohio, one of four children born to Harry Francis &quot;Pete&quot; and LaVerne Rose. He was a member of the [[Order of DeMolay]] as a young boy, and was encouraged by his parents to participate in sports.

He played both baseball and football at [[Western Hills High School (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Western Hills High School]]. He was small for his age but earned the starting [[running back]] position on his freshman football team. When he was not promoted to the [[varsity team|varsity]] football team in his sophomore year, Rose was dejected and lost interest in his studies. At the end of the school year, Rose's teachers decreed that he would have to attend summer school or be held back. Harry Rose decided that it would be better for Pete to repeat a year of school than miss a summer playing baseball. Plus, it would give Pete an extra year to mature physically. When Pete reached his senior year, he had already used up his four years of sports eligibility, so in the Spring of 1960, he joined the Class AA team sponsored by Frisch's Big Boy of [[Lebanon, Ohio]] in the Dayton Amateur League. He played [[catcher]], second base and [[shortstop]] and compiled a .626 batting average. This would have been the pinnacle of Rose's baseball career if not for the help of his uncle Buddy Bloebaum. Bloebaum was a &quot;Bird dog&quot; [[Scout (sport)|scout]] for the Reds and he pleaded the case for his nephew. The Reds, who had recently traded away a number of prospects who turned out to be very good, decided to take a chance on Pete. Upon his graduation from high school, Rose signed a professional contract.

==Playing career==
===Cincinnati Reds (1963–1978)===
====Rookie of the Year====
[[File:Rose walking onto field.jpg|thumb|250px|Rose walks onto the field with the Cincinnati Reds]]
During a [[spring training]] game against the [[Chicago White Sox]] in 1963, the Reds' regular second baseman, [[Don Blasingame]], pulled a [[groin]] muscle; Rose got his chance and made the most of it. During another spring training game against the [[New York Yankees]], [[Whitey Ford]] gave him the derisive nickname '''&quot;Charlie Hustle&quot;''' after Rose sprinted to first base after drawing a [[Base on balls|walk]]. Despite (or perhaps because of) the manner in which Ford intended it, Rose adopted that nickname as a badge of honor. In [[Ken Burns]]' documentary ''[[Baseball (TV series)|Baseball]]'', [[Mickey Mantle]] claimed that Ford gave Rose the nickname after Rose, playing in left field, made an effort to climb the fence to try to catch a Mantle home run that everyone could see was headed over everything.

Rose made the club, and made his major league debut on April 8, 1963 ([[Opening Day]]) against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] and drew a walk. After going 0-for-11, Rose got his first Major League hit on April 13, a triple off Pittsburgh's [[Bob Friend]]. He hit .273 for the year and won the [[National League]] [[MLB Rookie of the Year award|Rookie of the Year Award]], collecting 17 of 20 votes.

Rose entered the [[US Army Reserves]] after the 1963 baseball season. He was assigned to [[Fort Knox]] for six months of [[active duty]], which was followed by six years of regular attendance with a 478th Engineering Battalion USAR at [[Fort Thomas, Kentucky]]. At Fort Knox, he was a [[platoon]] guide and graduated from [[United States Army Basic Training]] January 18, 1964, one week before his marriage to Karolyn. Rose then remained at Fort Knox to assist the sergeant in training the next platoon and to help another sergeant train the Fort's baseball team. Later in his [[Fort Thomas, Kentucky|Fort Thomas]] service, Rose served as company cook which entailed coming in early for the one weekend/month meeting so that he could get out early enough to participate in local Reds games. Other Reds players in the unit included Johnny Bench, Bobby Tolan, and Darrel Chaney.

====Early years====
On April 23, 1964, in the top of the ninth inning of a scoreless game in [[Colt Stadium]], Rose reached first base on an error and scored on another error to make [[Houston Astros]] [[Ken Johnson (right-handed pitcher)|Ken Johnson]] the first pitcher to lose a [[complete game]] [[no-hitter]]. However, he slumped late in the season, was benched, and finished with just a .269 average. He continued to play winter ball in [[Venezuela]] with [[Leones del Caracas]] team during 1964–1965 season to improve his batting. Rose came back in 1965, leading the league in hits (209) and at-bats (670), and finishing sixth in NL MVP balloting. It was the first of his ten seasons with 200-plus hits, and his .312 batting average was the first of nine consecutive .300 seasons. He hit a career-High 16 [[home run]]s in 1966, then switched positions from [[second baseman|second base]] to [[right fielder|right field]] the following year.

In 1968, Rose started the season with a 22-game [[hitting streak|hit streak]], missed three weeks (including the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]) with a broken thumb, then had a 19-game hit streak late in the season. He had to finish the season 6-for-9 to beat out [[Matty Alou]] and win the first of two close NL batting-title races with a .335 average. He finished second to [[St. Louis Cardinals]] [[pitcher]] [[Bob Gibson]] for the NL MVP award, earning six first place votes.

Rose had his best offensive season in 1969, setting a career high in batting (.348) and tying his career-best 16 homers. As the Reds' leadoff man, he was the team's catalyst, rapping 218 hits, walking 88 times and pacing the league in runs with 120. He hit 33 doubles, 11 triples, drove in 82 runs, [[slugging percentage|slugged]] .512 (by far the highest mark of his long career), and had a .432 [[on base percentage|OBP]] (also a career best). Rose and [[Roberto Clemente]] were tied for the batting title going into the final game; Rose bunted for a base hit in his last at-bat of the season to beat out Clemente (.345).

====1970 All-Star game====
On July 14, 1970, in brand-new [[Riverfront Stadium]] (opened just two weeks earlier), Rose was involved in one of the most famous plays in [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] history. Leading off against the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]]' [[Clyde Wright]] in the 12th inning, Rose hit a single and advanced to second on another single by the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]' [[Billy Grabarkewitz]]. The [[Chicago Cubs]]’ [[Jim Hickman (1960s outfielder)|Jim Hickman]] then singled sharply to center. [[Amos Otis]]' throw went past [[Cleveland Indians]] catcher [[Ray Fosse]], as Rose barreled over Fosse to score the winning run. It has been written that Fosse suffered a separated shoulder in the collision, but it went undiagnosed initially. Fosse continued to hit for average (he finished the season at .307), but with diminished power—he had 16 home runs before the break but only two after. He played through the 1979 season, but never approached his first-year numbers.&lt;ref&gt;The Daily Star July 12, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The collision also caused Rose to miss three games with a bruised knee. As can be seen in a replay of the event, Rose initially intended to slide headfirst as he usually did, but when Fosse blocked the plate prior to the throw reaching home, an off-balance Rose came back up and ran through Fosse as the throw went by. Immediately after the play, Rose can be seen trying to check on the injured Fosse as Rose's National League teammates ran onto the field to celebrate his winning run.

====1973 season====
[[File:Pete rose at bat.jpg|thumb|Pete Rose at bat during the Big Red Machine years]]
In 1973, Rose led the league with 230 hits and a .338 batting average en route to winning the NL MVP award, and leading &quot;[[the Big Red Machine]]&quot; to the [[1973 National League Championship Series]] against the [[New York Mets]].

During the fifth inning of game three of the series, [[Joe Morgan]] hit a [[double play]] ball to Mets first baseman [[John Milner]] with Rose on first. Rose's slide into second attempting to break up the double play incited a fight with Mets shortstop [[Bud Harrelson]], resulting in a bench-clearing brawl. The game was nearly called off when, after the Reds took the field, the [[Shea Stadium]] crowd threw objects from the stands at Rose, causing Reds manager [[Sparky Anderson]] to pull his team off the field until order was restored. Mets Manager [[Yogi Berra]] and players [[Willie Mays]], [[Tom Seaver]], [[Cleon Jones]], and [[Rusty Staub]] were actually summoned by NL President [[Chub Feeney]] out to left field to calm the fans. The Reds ended up losing the game, 7–2, and the [[National League Championship Series|NLCS]], 3–2, despite Rose’s .381 batting average in the series, and his eighth-inning home run to tie Game One and his 12th-inning home run to win Game Four.

====The Big Red Machine====
{{Main|The Big Red Machine}}
The Cincinnati Reds of the 1970s earned the nickname &quot;the Big Red Machine,&quot; and is widely acknowledged as one of the greatest teams ever. On a team with many great players, Rose, along with Hall of Famers [[Johnny Bench]], [[Joe Morgan]] and [[Tony Pérez]], was viewed as one of the club's leaders.

In 1975, Rose earned the [[Hickok Belt]] as top professional athlete of the year and ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine's &quot;[[Sportsman of the Year]]&quot; award. The following year, he was a major force in helping the Reds repeat as World Series champions. The 1976 Reds swept the Phillies 3–0 in the [[1976 National League Championship Series]], then swept the Yankees 4–0 in the World Series. The 1976 Cincinnati Reds remain the only team since the expansion of the playoffs in 1969 to go undefeated in the postseason. The Reds have not lost a World Series game since [[Carlton Fisk]]'s extra inning home run in 1975, a span of 9 straight wins.  What tends to get overlooked was that in 1975 and 1976, it was the successful changing of Rose's primary position from the outfield to fill the void at third base (3B) that seemed to solidify the Reds team for these 2 championship seasons as this move enabled the Reds to use power hitting outfielder [[George Foster (baseball)|George Foster]] more.

====44-game hitting streak====
On May 5, 1978, Rose became the 13th player in major league history to collect his [[3000 hit club|3,000th career hit]], with a single off [[Montreal Expos]] pitcher [[Steve Rogers (baseball)|Steve Rogers]]. On June 14 in Cincinnati, Rose singled in the first inning off Cubs pitcher [[Dave Roberts (pitcher)|Dave Roberts]]; Rose would proceed to get a hit in every game he played until August 1, making a run at [[Joe DiMaggio]]’s record 56-game [[hitting streak]], which had stood virtually unchallenged for 37 years. The streak started quietly, but by the time it had reached 30 games, the media took notice and a pool of reporters accompanied Rose and the Reds to every game. On July 19 against the [[Philadelphia Phillies]], Rose was hitless going into the ninth with his team trailing. He ended up walking in the eighth inning and the streak appeared over. But the Reds managed to bat through their entire lineup, giving Rose another chance to bat in the ninth inning. Facing [[Ron Reed]], Rose laid down a perfect [[Bunt (baseball)|bunt]] single to extend the streak to 32 games.

He would eventually tie [[Willie Keeler]]'s 1897 single season National League record at 44 games, but on August 1, the streak came to an end as [[Gene Garber]] of the [[Atlanta Braves]] struck out Rose in the ninth inning. The competitive Rose was sour after the game, blasting Garber and the Braves for treating the situation &quot;like it was the ninth inning of the 7th game of the [[World Series]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Former reliever Gene Garber recalls 19-year career and his role in baseball history| author=Joe O'Loughlin| url = http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0FCI/is_2_63/ai_112167128| newspaper=Baseball Digest| publisher=Century Publishing Co.| date = February 2004| accessdate =April 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of being insulted, Garber took the comment as a compliment: &quot;I said to myself, 'Well, thanks Pete. That's how I try to pitch every time I'm in a game'.&quot;

===Philadelphia Phillies (1979–1983)===
The Philadelphia Phillies had won the National League East three years running (1976–1978) two of which were won with 101 win seasons, but were unable to make it to the World Series. In 1979, believing that he was the player who could bring them over the top, the Phillies temporarily made Rose the highest-paid athlete in team sports when they signed him to a four-year, $3.2-million contract as a [[free agent]]. With perennial All-Star [[Mike Schmidt]] firmly entrenched at third, Rose made the final position change of his career to first base.

Although they missed the postseason in his first year with the team, they earned three division titles (one in the first half of the [[1981 Major League Baseball strike|strike shortened 1981 season]]), two [[World Series]] appearances and their first ever World Series title ({{wsy|1980}}) in the following four years.

The worst season of Rose's career was also the season that the Phillies played in their second World Series in four years, 1983. Rose batted only .245 with 121 hits, and found himself benched during the latter part of the '83 season, appearing periodically to play and pinch hit. Rose did blossom as a pinch-hitter, with 8 hits in 21 at bats, a .381 average.

Rose bounced back in a big way during the postseason, batting .375 (6-for-16) during the N.L. Playoffs against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], and .312 in the World Series (5-for-16). Rose collected only one hit in his first eight at-bats in the first two games in Baltimore against the 1983 A.L. Champions. Rose found himself benched for game three back in Philadelphia, and would ground out in a pinch-hitting appearance. Worse yet, Rose showed some unsportsmanlike attitude toward his own manager, [[Paul Owens (baseball)|Paul Owens]], complaining about his benching in a pre-game interview with ABC's Howard Cosell. Rose bounced back with four hits in his last seven at-bats in the remaining two games. Still, the Phillies lost decisively to the [[Baltimore Orioles]] in the [[1983 World Series]], 4 games to 1.

===Montreal Expos (1984)===
Rose was granted an unconditional release from the Phillies in late October 1983. Phillies management wanted to retain Rose for the 1984 season, but he refused to accept a more limited playing role. Months later, he signed a one-year contract with the [[1984 Montreal Expos season|Montreal Expos]]. On April 13, 1984, the 21st anniversary of his first career hit, Rose doubled off of the Phillies’ [[Jerry Koosman]] for his 4,000th career hit, becoming only the second player in the 4000 hit club (joining [[Ty Cobb]]).

===Second stint with the Cincinnati Reds (1984–1986)===
Rose was traded to the Reds for infielder [[Tom Lawless]] on August 15, 1984 and was immediately named [[player-manager]], replacing Reds' manager [[Vern Rapp]]. Though he only batted .259 for the Expos, his average jumped to .365 with the Reds, as he managed them to a 19–22 record for the remainder of the season.

On September 11, 1985, Rose broke Ty Cobb’s all-time hits record with his 4,192nd hit, a single to left-center field off [[San Diego Padres]] pitcher [[Eric Show]]. According to its web site, MLB.com, Major League Baseball continues to recognize Cobb's final hit total as 4,191, though independent research has revealed that two of Cobb's hits were counted twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://www.curledup.com/2005espn.htm |title=The 2005 ESPN Baseball Encyclopedia – book review |work=curledup.com |accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/31/sports/baseball/31records.html | work=The New York Times | title=Numbers Are Cast in Bronze, but Are Not Set in Stone | first=Alan | last=Schwarz | date=July 31, 2005 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, it has been suggested that Rose actually broke Cobb's record against the Cubs' Reggie Patterson with a single in the first inning of a Reds' 5–5 called game against Chicago on September 8. Because Rose broke Cobb's record, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]] named Rose as its Athlete of the Year that year. Rose accumulated a total of 4,256 hits before his final career at-bat, a [[strikeout]] against San Diego’s [[Goose Gossage]] on August 17, 1986.

==Retirement from playing==
On November 11, Rose was dropped from the Reds’ 40-man roster to make room for pitcher [[Pat Pacillo]], and he unofficially retired as a player. &quot;Charlie Hustle&quot; finished with an incredible number of Major League and National League records that have lasted for many years. Rose, always proud of his ability to hit .300 or better in 15 of his 24 playing seasons, had a lifetime .303 batting average.

Rose managed the Reds from August 15, 1984, to August 24, 1989, with a 426–388 record. During his four full seasons at the helm (1985–1988), the Reds posted four second-place finishes in the NL West division. His 426 managerial wins rank fifth in Reds history.

===30-game suspension===
On April 30, 1988, during a home game against the New York Mets, with two out in the top of the ninth inning [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] [[Dave Pallone]] made a safe at first call that allowed what would become the eventual game-winning run to score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CIN/CIN198804300.shtml |title=April 30, 1988 New York Mets at Cincinnati Reds Play by Play and Box Score |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date=April 30, 1988 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose argued the call vehemently and made physical contact with the umpire, noticeably pushing him. National League president [[A. Bartlett Giamatti]] suspended Rose for 30 days, which was the longest suspension ever levied for an on-field incident involving a manager. Giamatti said, &quot;For forcefully and deliberately shoving an umpire, the manager of the Reds, Mr. Pete Rose, is suspended for 30 days and fined a substantial amount.&quot; Cincinnati fans showered the field with various objects including radios and cigarette lighters. After a 15-minute suspension of play umpire Pallone left the field and the game was completed with the remaining three umpires. Giamatti also summoned the on-air announcers at the game and said &quot;Inciting the unacceptable behavior of some of the fans were the inflammatory and completely irresponsible remarks of local radio broadcasters Marty Brennaman and Joe Nuxhall. . . . There is no excuse for encouraging a situation where the physical safety and well-being of any individual is put significantly at risk. Nothing justifies such unprofessional behavior.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last = Chass| first = Murray |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/03/sports/pete-rose-is-suspended-30-days.html|title=Pete Rose Is Suspended 30 Days|accessdate=May 3, 1988 | work=The New York Times | date=May 3, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Permanent ineligibility==
Amid reports that he had bet on baseball, Rose was questioned in February 1989 by outgoing commissioner [[Peter Ueberroth]] and his replacement, [[Bart Giamatti]]. Rose denied the allegations and Ueberroth dropped the investigation. However, three days after Giamatti became Commissioner, lawyer [[John M. Dowd]] was retained to investigate these charges against Rose. ''Sports Illustrated,'' who first reported the story of Rose's gambling on March 21, 1989,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SI.com|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/baseball/mlb/01/05/rose.chronology/|work=Pete Rose Chronology}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave the public their first detailed report of the allegations that Rose had placed bets on baseball games. ''Sports Illustrated'' ran the cover story in issue for the week of April 3, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=April 3rd, 1989|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/edb/reader.html?magID=SI&amp;issueDate=19890403&amp;mode=reader_vault|work=Sports Illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowd interviewed many of Rose's associates, including alleged bookies and bet runners. He delivered a summary of his findings to the Commissioner in May. In it, Dowd documented Rose's alleged gambling activities in 1985 and 1986 and compiled a day-by-day account of Rose's alleged betting on baseball games in 1987. The [[Dowd Report]] documented his alleged bets on 52 Reds games in 1987, where Rose wagered a minimum of $10,000 a day. Others involved in the allegations claim that number was actually $2,000 a day.

According to the [[Dowd Report]] itself, &quot;no evidence was discovered that Rose bet against the Reds&quot;, but in a December 2002 interview, investigator Dowd stated that he believed that Rose may have bet ''against'' the Reds while managing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/news/2002/1212/1475769.html |title=ESPN.com: Dowd: Rose 'probably' bet against Reds while manager |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Those critical of Rose's behavior, including Ohio's own Hall of Fame baseball reporter [[Hal McCoy]], have observed that &quot;the major problem with Rose betting on baseball, particularly the Reds, is that as manager he could control games, make decisions that could enhance his chances of winning his bets, thus jeopardizing the integrity of the game.&quot;, as has happened when players in the [[Black Sox Scandal]] intentionally lost the 1919 World Series in a scheme with gamblers.&lt;ref&gt;http://encarta.msn.com/sidebar_461577611/should_pete_rose_be_in_the_hall_of_fame_.html {{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Major League baseball rule Rose violated makes no distinction between betting for or against your team, only that you bet on them and were in a position to influence the outcome. The rule is: &quot;Rule 21 MISCONDUCT, (d) BETTING ON BALL GAMES, Any player, umpire, or club or league official or employee, who shall bet any sum whatsoever upon any baseball game in connection with which the bettor has a duty to perform shall be declared permanently ineligible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theverifiabletruth.com/2007/10/mlbs-rule-21-misconduct-gambling.html |title=MLB's Rule 21: Misconduct; gambling prohibitions |publisher=The Verifiable Truth |date=October 16, 2007 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose continued to deny all of the accusations against him and refused to appear at a hearing with Giamatti on the matter. He filed a lawsuit alleging that the Commissioner had prejudged the case and could not provide a fair hearing. A Cincinnati judge issued a temporary restraining order to delay the hearing, but Giamatti fought to have the case moved to Federal Court. The Commissioner prevailed in that effort, after which he and Rose entered settlement negotiations.

On August 24, 1989, Rose voluntarily accepted a permanent place on baseball’s ineligible list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://baseball1.com/bb-data/rose/agreement.html |title= Rose/Giamatti Agreement |work=baseball1.com |accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose accepted that there was a factual reason for the ban; in return, Major League Baseball agreed to make no formal finding with regard to the gambling allegations. According to baseball's rules, Rose could apply for reinstatement in one year. Rose, with a 412–373 record, was replaced as Reds manager by [[Tommy Helms]]. Rose began therapy with a psychiatrist for treatment of a gambling addiction.

Rose's ban has prevented the Reds from formally retiring his No. 14 jersey. However, aside from his son [[Pete Rose, Jr.|Pete Jr.]]'s brief stint with the team in 1997, the Reds have not issued that number since Rose's ban. Uniform number 14 was retired in Rose's honor by the [[Cincinnati Cyclones]] of the [[East Coast Hockey League]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

==Tax evasion==
On April 20, 1990, Rose pleaded guilty to two charges of filing false [[income tax]] returns not showing income he received from selling [[autograph]]s and memorabilia, and from horse racing winnings. On July 19, Rose was sentenced to five months in the medium security Prison Camp at the [[United States Penitentiary, Marion|United States Penitentiary]] in [[Marion, Illinois]] and fined $50,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;EnquirerTimeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reds.enquirer.com/2004/01/06/red1timeline.html |title=Pete Rose timeline |publisher=reds.enquirer.com |accessdate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a twist of fate, Marion was the hometown of Fosse, the man whom Rose bowled over during the All-Star game nearly 20 years prior, resulting in injuries that would plagued Fosse for the rest of his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowled Over&quot;&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1999/07/10/SP51494.DTL Kroichick, Ron, ''Bowled Over'', 10 July 1999, ''San Francisco Chronicle''; accessed 28 September 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
He was released on January 7, 1991 after having paid $366,041 in back taxes and interest, and was required to perform 1000 hours of community service.&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPN_PrisonRelease&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last = Schwartz | first = Larry|url=http://assets.espn.go.com/classic/s/moment0107rosereleased.html |title=ESPN Classic&amp;nbsp;– Rose released from Marion Federal Prison |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Edward Rose, inmate # 01832-061, [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]], U.S Dep't of Justice, at [http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;FirstName=Peter&amp;Middle=&amp;LastName=Rose&amp;Race=U&amp;Sex=U&amp;Age=&amp;x=99&amp;y=8].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hall of Fame eligibility==
On February 4, 1991, the Hall of Fame voted formally to exclude individuals on the permanently ineligible list from being inducted into the Hall of Fame by way of the [[Baseball Writers Association of America]] vote (though it was already an &quot;unwritten&quot; rule prior). Rose is the only living member of the ineligible list. Players who were not selected by the BWAA could be considered by the [[Veterans Committee]] in the first year after they would have lost their place on the Baseball Writers' ballot. Under the Hall's rules, players may appear on the ballot for only fifteen years, beginning five years after they retire. Had he not been banned from baseball, Rose's name could have been on the writers' ballot beginning in 1992 and ending in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4358260 |title=Sources: Pete Rose's status the same, despite report |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He would have been eligible for consideration by the Veterans Committee in 2007, but did not appear on the ballot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = O'Connell |first = Jack|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4358260 |title=Sources: Pete Rose's status the same, despite report&amp;nbsp;|publisher=ESPN |accessdate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 the Veterans Committee barred players and managers on the ineligible list from consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://baseballhall.org/hall-famers/rules-election/vet-committee-players |title=Vet Committee&amp;nbsp;– Players |publisher=baseballhall.org |accessdate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MLB All-Century team==
In 1999, Rose was selected as an outfielder on the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]]. To select the team, a panel of experts first compiled a list of the 100 greatest players from the past century. Fans then voted on the players using paper and online ballots.

An exception was made to his ban to allow him to participate in the pre-game introduction of the All-Century team before Game 2 of the [[1999 World Series]] between the Braves and Yankees. Despite never having been a member of the Braves, Rose received the loudest ovation of the All-Century team members from the crowd at [[Turner Field]] in [[Atlanta]], Georgia.

After the ceremony on live television, [[NBC]]'s [[Jim Gray (sportscaster)|Jim Gray]] repeatedly asked Rose if he was ready to admit to betting on baseball and apologize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/scorecard/08/05/interviews/|title=Top 10 Most Embarrassing TV/Radio Interview Moments|publisher=SI.com|date=August 6, 2004 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armchairqb.com/nbc_rose.html|title=No Gray Area Here|publisher=armchairqb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=Q1excEhov4YC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;lpg=PA20&amp;dq=pete+rose+transcript+jim+gray&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1bev23_8t9&amp;sig=N-Gn7iQZTtvYO5uCQpwkO_KYOHc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bK0TSo2kMsSfmAeb0fzeAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10|title=Sports media: planning, production, and reporting|author=Brad Schultz | isbn=978-0-240-80731-7 | year=2005 | publisher=Elsevier}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people were outraged over Gray's aggressive questioning, feeling that it detracted from the ceremony. In protest, Yankees outfielder [[Chad Curtis]], at the behest of his team, refused to speak with Gray after his game-winning home run in Game 3. Earlier that season, Rose had been ranked at number 25 on ''[[The Sporting News]]''' list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players.

While allowing him to participate in the All-Century Team, MLB has refused to allow him to participate in local events in Cincinnati, such as the 25th anniversary reunion of the Big Red Machine, the closing of [[Cinergy Field]], and the opening of the [[Great American Ballpark]], as well as the closing of [[Veterans Stadium]] in Philadelphia and 1980 Phillies anniversary celebrations.

==Reinstatement efforts==
In September 1997, Rose applied for reinstatement. [[Bud Selig]], the Commissioner of Major League Baseball, never acted on that application. He had previously applied for reinstatement in 1992, but then-commissioner [[Fay Vincent]] also never acted on it.

In public comments, Selig said he saw no reason to reconsider Rose's punishment; however, in March 2003, Selig acknowledged that he was considering Rose's application, leading to speculation that Rose's return might be imminent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url= http://static.espn.go.com/mlb/news/2003/0313/1523010.html |title=ESPN.com: MLB&amp;nbsp;– Selig seriously considers Rose's reinstatement |publisher=ESPN |accessdate=June 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, however, Selig took no action. Even supporters of Rose's reinstatement concede that it is not likely that reinstatement will occur under Selig's tenure as commissioner.

On July 27, 2009, the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' reported that Commissioner Selig has seriously considered lifting Rose's lifetime suspension from baseball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Madden| first = Bill |url= http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/baseball/2009/07/27/2009-07-27_pete_rose.html?page=0 |title=MLB commissioner Bud Selig mulling pardon for hit king Pete Rose |work=New York Daily News |accessdate=June 9, 2010 | date=July 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next day, Selig shot down these rumors and Rose will in fact remain suspended, indefinitely.

==Coming clean==
In his autobiography ''[[My Prison Without Bars]]'', published by [[Rodale Press]] on January 8, 2004, Rose finally admitted publicly to betting on baseball games and other sports while playing for and managing the Reds. He also admitted to betting on Reds games, but said that he never bet against the Reds. He repeated his admissions in an interview on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] news program ''[[Primetime (TV series)|Primetime Thursday]]''. He also said in the book that he hoped his admissions would help end his ban from baseball so that he could reapply for reinstatement.

In March 2007 during an interview on ''The [[Dan Patrick]] Show'' on [[ESPN Radio]], Rose said, &quot;I bet on my team every night. I didn't bet on my team four nights a week. I bet on my team to win every night because I loved my team, I believed in my team,&quot; he said. &quot;I did everything in my power every night to win that game.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/15/74426.shtml Pete Rose: 'I Bet on My Team Every Night']. Newsmax.com (March 15, 2007). Retrieved on 2012-05-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

John Dowd disputed Rose's contention that he bet on the Reds every night, asserting that Rose did not bet on his team when [[Mario Soto (baseball)|Mario Soto]] or [[Bill Gullickson]] pitched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2007-03-15-rose-dowd_N.htm |title=Dowd: Some nights, Rose didn't bet on Reds|work=USA Today |accessdate=August 10, 2012 |first=John |last=Erardi |date=March 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, Dowd's allegations did not match the records contained in his own report. A notebook detailing Rose's daily betting activity shows that Rose did in fact place bets on 5 of the 6 games Soto started in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seanlahman.com/files/rose/exhibits/EXHIBIT_012.pdf |title=Dowd Report, Exhibit 12: Paul Janszen Betting Notebook}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The lone exception was April 26, 1987, when Rose allegedly placed bets on hockey and basketball games but no baseball games. Those records also show he bet on every game that Gullickson started during the time period which the betting notebook covered.

The criticism of Rose did not diminish after this admission—even some Rose supporters were outraged that Rose would suddenly reverse fifteen years of denials as part of a book publicity tour. In addition, the timing was called into question—by making his admission just two days after the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] announced its class of 2004 inductees, Rose appeared to be linking himself publicly to the Hall. Further adding to the debate was the 2004 [[ESPN]] made-for-[[television|TV]] movie ''[[Hustle (2004 film)|Hustle]]'', starring [[Tom Sizemore]] as Rose, which documents Rose's gambling problem and his subsequent ban from baseball.

==WWE==
Between the years 1998 and 2000, Rose appeared at [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Entertainment's]] annual ''[[WrestleMania]]'' pay-per-view event. At ''[[WrestleMania XIV]]'' he served as &quot;guest [[ring announcer]]&quot; during a match between [[Glenn Jacobs|Kane]] and [[the Undertaker]], before which he took a [[Tombstone piledriver|Tombstone Piledriver]] from Kane (nicknamed &quot;The Big Red Machine&quot; for his red ring attire).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/14/celebrities |title=WrestleMania XIV Celebrities |accessdate=May 2, 2012 |publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the next year's [[WrestleMania XV]], Rose was portrayed as seeking revenge. To do so he dressed as [[the San Diego Chicken]] and &quot;attacked&quot; Kane before his scheduled match, only to take another Tombstone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/15/celebrities |title=WrestleMania XV Celebrities |accessdate=May 2, 2012 |publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned for a third time the following year, at [[WrestleMania 2000]], but again was thwarted by Kane, as well as [[Solofa Fatu|Rikishi]], his tag team partner that night.

In addition to these three appearances, he appeared in a [[Halloween]]-themed commercial for WWE's [[WWE No Mercy#2002|No Mercy]] event in 2002 and was chokeslammed by Kane. In 2004, Rose was inducted into the &quot;Celebrity Wing&quot; of the [[WWE Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/peterose/bio/ |title=WWE Hall of Fame Bio |accessdate=September 28, 2007 |publisher=WWE |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070716005225/http://www.wwe.com/superstars/halloffame/peterose/bio/ |archivedate = July 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first celebrity to go into the Hall, and was inducted at a ceremony prior to [[WrestleMania XX]] by Kane himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/20/celebrities |title=WrestleMania XX Celebrities |accessdate=May 2, 2012 |publisher=WWE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, 2010, he appeared as the guest host on [[WWE Raw]], which was the last episode of Raw before ''[[WrestleMania XXVI]]''.  As his first order of business, he set up a match between [[Shawn Michaels]] and Kane, which Michaels won. Later on in the night, Kane attacked Rose offscreen.

Rose was briefly mentioned on WWE television again on August 27, 2012. In an anger management segment, Kane stated that &quot;for reasons never quite explained, I have an unhealthy obsession with torturing Pete Rose.&quot;

==Personal life==
Pete Rose married Karolyn Englehardt on January 25, 1964, and the couple had two children, daughter Fawn (born on December 29, 1964) and son [[Pete Rose Jr.]] (born on November 16, 1969). The couple divorced in 1980.

Rose married his second wife, Carol J. Woliung, in 1984. They have two children, son Tyler (born on October 1, 1984) and daughter Cara (born on August 22, 1989).  Rose filed for divorce from Carol in March 2011.  The 69-year-old Rose cited irreconcilable differences for the split, but his petition did not offer any additional details. Rose didn’t include a date for their separation. Further documents in the filing say that Rose is looking to acquire all memorabilia and other possessions before the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news;_ylt=AtEaR3q2SX37tUlEEgwLRQMRvLYF?slug=ap-peterose-divorce ]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose began openly having a relationship with Kiana Kim, a Playboy model, while separated from his second wife, to whom he was married for 20 years. During a 2009 interview, Rose discussed his relationship with Kim while omitting her name, stating, &quot;My girl has finally decided to try to shoot for ''[[Playboy]]'', and they were kind enough to give her an opportunity to come to Houston for an interview, and we’re excited about that.&quot;

Two of Rose's children have lived public lives. Cara has worked as a television actress, appearing as a regular in the first season of the soap opera ''[[Passions]]'' and playing a recurring role on ''[[Melrose Place]]''. She uses the stage name &quot;[[Chea Courtney]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0183895/ |title=Chea Courtney |publisher=Internet Movie Database |accessdate=June 16, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His oldest son, [[Pete Rose, Jr.]], spent 16 years as a minor league baseball player, advancing to the majors once for an 11-game stint with the Cincinnati Reds in 1997. In his first Major League at-bat, Pete Jr. paid tribute to his father by imitating Pete Sr.'s famous batting stance.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}
