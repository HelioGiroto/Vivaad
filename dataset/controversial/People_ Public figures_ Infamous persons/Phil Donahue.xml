'''Phillip John &quot;Phil&quot; Donahue''' (born December 21, 1935) is an American [[media personality]], [[writer]], and [[film producer]] best known as the creator and host of ''[[The Phil Donahue Show]].'' The television program, also known as ''Donahue,'' was the first to use a talk show format. The show had a 26-year run on U.S. national TV, preceded by three years of local broadcast in [[Dayton, Ohio]], before ending in 1996.

His shows have often focused on issues that often divide [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]] and [[American conservatism| conservatives]] in the United States, such as [[abortion]], consumer protection, [[civil rights]] and war issues. His most frequent guest was [[Ralph Nader]], for whom Donahue campaigned in [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]].&lt;ref name = times /&gt; Donahue also hosted a talk show on [[MSNBC]] from 2002&amp;ndash;2003.

In 1996, Donahue was ranked #42 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1996 |title=Special Collectors' Issue: 50 Greatest TV Stars of All Time |journal=[[TV Guide]] |volume= |issue=December 14-20 |pages= |publisher= |doi= |url= |accessdate=October 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==
Donahue was born into a middle-class, [[piety|churchgoing]], [[Irish Catholic]] family in [[Cleveland, Ohio]]; his father was a [[furniture]] sales clerk and his mother a department store [[shoe]] clerk.&lt;ref&gt;Timberg, Bernard M. ''et al.'' ''Television Talk'', p.69. University of Texas Press, 2002, ISBN 0-292-78176-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manga, Julie Engel. ''Talking Trash: The Cultural Politics of Daytime TV Talk Shows'', p.28. NYU Press, 2003, ISBN 0-8147-5683-2&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, he graduated from of Our Lady Of Angels [[elementary school]] in the [[West Park, Cleveland|West Park]] neighborhood. In 1953, Donahue was a member of the first graduating class of [[St. Edward High School (Lakewood, Ohio)|St. Edward High School]], an all-boys college prep Catholic private high school run by the [[Congregation of Holy Cross]] in suburban [[Lakewood, Ohio]]. He graduated from the [[University of Notre Dame]], which is also run by the Congregation of Holy Cross, with a [[Bachelor of Business Administration|B.B.A]] in 1957.

== Career ==
Donahue began his career in 1957 as a production assistant at [[WTAM|KYW radio]] and [[WKYC-TV|television]] in Cleveland.  He got a chance to become an announcer one day when the regular announcer failed to show up.  After a brief stint as a bank check sorter in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], he became program director for WABJ radio in [[Adrian, Michigan]], soon after graduating.  He moved on to become a [[Stringer (journalism)|stringer]] for the ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' and later, an anchor of the morning newscast at [[WHIO-TV]] in [[Dayton, Ohio]], where his interviews with [[Jimmy Hoffa]] and [[Billie Sol Estes]] were picked up nationally.  While in Dayton, Donahue also hosted ''Conversation Piece'', a phone-in afternoon talk show from 1963 to 1967 on [[WHIO (AM)|WHIO radio]]. There, among others, he interviewed civil rights activists (including [[Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.]], [[Malcolm X]]) and war dissenters.

In 1999, he was originally supposed to host the [[FOX]] game show [[Greed (game show)|Greed]], but declined and [[Chuck Woolery]] took over as host.{{cn|date=October 2012}}

==''The Phil Donahue Show''==
{{main|The Phil Donahue Show}}
[[File:Phil Donahue Johnny Carson 1970.JPG|thumb|Donahue with guest [[Johnny Carson]] in August, 1970.]]
On November 6, 1967, Donahue left WHIO, moving his talk program to television with ''The Phil Donahue Show'' on WLWD (now [[WDTN]]), also in Dayton. Initially, the program was shown only on other stations owned by the [[Crosley Broadcasting Corporation]] (which would later take the name of its parent [[Avco|Avco Company]]), which also owned WLWD. But, in January 1970, ''The Phil Donahue Show'' entered nationwide [[Television syndication|syndication]]. Donahue's syndicated show was originally taped in Chicago where he worked and lived: then in 1984, he moved the show to New York City to be near his wife [[Marlo Thomas]].

After a 29-year run—26 years in syndication—and nearly 7,000 one-hour daily shows, the final original episode of ''Donahue'' aired on September 13, 1996, culminating what remains the longest continuous run of any syndicated talk show in U.S. television history. ''Donahue'' will continue to remain the longest continiously running syndicated talk show until at least 2015, if or when ''[[Live! with Kelly]]'' completes it's 27th season in national syndication. If ''Live'' does not complete a 27th season, ''[[Maury (TV series)|Maury]]'' and ''[[Jerry Springer (TV series)|Jerry Springer]]'' would both pass in 2018, having both been on the air since 1991.

He is known for giving birth to &quot;Shock Journalism&quot; opening the doors as a pioneer to forementioned TV hosts.  

While hosting his own program, Donahue also appeared on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|The Today Show]]'' as a contributor, from 1980 until 1982.  From 1991 to 1994 he also co-hosted ''Pozner/Donahue'', a weekly, issues-oriented roundtable program with [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] journalist [[Vladimir Posner|Vladimir Pozner]], which aired both on [[CNBC]] and in syndication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/celebrity/Phil_Donahue/189331 |title=Phil Donahue &amp;#124; Biography, Photos, Movies, TV, Credits |publisher=Hollywood.com |date= |accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== MSNBC program ==
In July 2002, Phil Donahue returned to television to host a show called ''Donahue'' on [[MSNBC]]. On February 25, 2003, MSNBC canceled the show, citing low viewership. According to the ''[[New York Times]]'' despite being heavily promoted by MSNBC and having a debuting audience of  660,000 only three weeks into the show, viewership had fallen to 390,000 viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/19/business/woes-of-donahue-cast-shadow-over-msnbc.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Woes of 'Donahue' Cast Shadow Over MSNBC |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2002-08-19 |accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2002, Donahue’s audience was down to 379,000.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Kluger. Why do mean-spirited TV shows lure Americans? USA Today. January 29, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Although his ratings were less than 1/6 [[Bill O'Reilly (political commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], whose ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' shared the same time slot, Donahue was the highest rated show on MSNBC at the time it was canceled, managing to beat out [[Chris Matthews]]' &quot;Hardball&quot; in the ratings.&lt;ref name=surr&gt;[http://www.allyourtv.com/0203season/news/02252003donahue.html The Surrender Of MSNBC-AllYourTV.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the show's cancellation AllYourTV.com reported it had received a copy of an internal NBC memo that stated Donahue should be fired because he would be a &quot;difficult public face for NBC in a time of war&quot;.&lt;ref name=surr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediamatters.org/items/200410290004 |title=Phil Donahue on his 2003 MSNBC firing: &quot;We had to have two conservatives on for every liberal. I was counted as two liberals.&quot; |publisher=Media Matters |date=2004-10-29 |accessdate=2010-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 [[Norman Solomon]]'s book ''Made Love, Got War: Close Encounters with America's Warfare State'' came to the same conclusion.

== Film producer ==
In 2007, Donahue served as Executive Producer for the feature documentary film, ''[[Body of War]]'', which he also co-directed with independent filmmaker [[Ellen Spiro]]. The film tells the story of Tomas Young, a severely disabled Iraq War veteran and his turbulent postwar adjustments. In November 2007 the film was named as one of fifteen documentaries to be in consideration for an Oscar nomination from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Melidonian, Teni.

Retrieved on 2007-12-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honors ==
Donahue was awarded nine [[Emmy Awards]] during his broadcasting career, and was inducted into the [[Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences]] Hall of Fame on November 20, 1993.

==Personal life==
In 1958, he married his first wife, Marge Cooney, who divorced him in 1975. They have five children. He married his second (and present) wife, actress [[Marlo Thomas]] (daughter of [[Danny Thomas]]), in 1980. They have lived in [[Westport, Connecticut]] since 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Ravo, Nick, &quot;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE4D6133CF933A25755C0A96E948260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink Eyesore or Landmark? The House Donahue Razed]&quot;, ''New York Times'', July 10, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

Donahue does not see himself as &quot;a very good [[Roman Catholic]],&quot; given that he did not want to have his first marriage [[Annulment (Catholic Church)|annulled]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt; He has elaborated that he &quot;will always be a Catholic&quot; but that he opposes what he sees as the Church's &quot;[[Catholic theology of the body|antisexual theology]].&quot;&lt;ref name=times&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9502E3DF1E3DF937A25757C0A9649C8B63 Questions for Phil Donahue]. By David Wallis. ''The New York Times''. Published April 14, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He has also said that he found [[Madalyn Murray O'Hair]]'s message of [[atheism]] &quot;very important.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Phil Donahue|title=Godless in America|medium=Documentary|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has admitted that he is not permitted to receive the [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Blessed Sacrament]], since the Church sees him as living in a state of adultery.

On November 10, 2010, [[Oprah Winfrey]] invited Donahue, along with former talk show hosts [[Sally Jessy Raphael]], [[Geraldo Rivera]], [[Ricki Lake]] and [[Montel Williams]] as guests on her show. This was the first time that she had fellow talkers appear together since their programs left the air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oprah.com/showinfo/Talk-Show-Hosts-Together-for-the-First-Time_1 DONAHUE, SALLY JESSY, GERALDO, MONTEL, RICKI: TALK SHOW HOSTS—WHERE ARE THEY NOW?], Oprah.com, November 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;
