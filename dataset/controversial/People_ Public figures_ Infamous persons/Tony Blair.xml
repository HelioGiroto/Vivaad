'''Anthony Charles Lynton &lt;!-- Please do not add 'Tony' here as it is obvious information, and ugly to interrupt the full name at this point --&gt;Blair''' (born 6 May 1953)&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Tony Blair| url = http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9003134 | work=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[British people|British]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] politician who served as the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] of the [[United Kingdom]] from 2 May 1997 to 27 June 2007. He was the [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|Member of Parliament]] (MP) for [[Sedgefield (UK Parliament constituency)|Sedgefield]] from 1983 to 2007 and [[List of United Kingdom Labour Party leaders|Leader of the Labour Party]] from 1994 to 2007. He resigned from all of these positions in June 2007.

Blair was elected Leader of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1994|leadership election of July 1994]], following the sudden death of his predecessor, [[John Smith (Labour Party leader)|John Smith]]. Under his leadership, the party used the phrases &quot;[[New Labour]]&quot; and &quot;New Socialism&quot; to define its policy, and moved away from its support of [[state socialism]] since the 1960s and created a new version of the [[ethical socialism]] that was last pursued by [[Clement Attlee]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bevir. ''New Labour: a critique''. London, England, UK; New York, New York, USA: Routledge, 2005. Pp. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of Blair claim that &quot;New Labour&quot; did not adhere to socialism as claimed, and that it effectively advocated [[capitalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Florence Faucher-King, Patrick Le Galès, Gregory Elliott. The New Labour experiment: change and reform under Blair and Brown. Stanford, California, USA: Stanford University Press, 2010. Pp. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; However Blair has criticised capitalism for its claim that wealth would [[Trickle-down economics|trickle down]], saying that &quot;Today that claim seems absurd&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Blair. ''New Britain: My Vision of a Young Country''. Westview Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Blair subsequently led Labour to a landslide victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]]. At 43 years old, he became the youngest Prime Minister since [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] in 1812. In the first years of the New Labour government, Blair's government implemented a number of [[New Labour, New Life For Britain|1997 manifesto]] pledges, introducing the [[National Minimum Wage Act 1998|minimum wage]], [[Human Rights Act 1998|Human Rights Act]] and [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]], and carrying out [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]], establishing the [[Scottish Parliament]], the [[National Assembly for Wales]], and the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]].

Blair's role as Prime Minister was particularly visible in foreign and security policy, including in [[Northern Ireland]], where he was involved in the 1998 [[Good Friday Agreement]]. From the start of the [[War on Terror]] in 2001, Blair strongly supported the foreign policy of US President [[George W. Bush]], notably by participating in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. Blair is the Labour Party's longest-serving Prime Minister, the only person to have led the Labour Party to three consecutive general election victories, and the only Labour Prime Minister to serve consecutive terms more than one of which was at least four years long.

He was succeeded as Leader of the Labour Party on 24 June 2007 and as Prime Minister on 27 June 2007 by [[Gordon Brown]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown is UK's new prime minister&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Brown is UK's new prime minister |work=BBC News  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6245682.stm |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the day he resigned as Prime Minister, he was appointed the official Envoy of the [[Quartet on the Middle East]]. In May 2008, Blair launched his [[Tony Blair Faith Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7427809.stm |title=Blair launches faith foundation |publisher=BBC News  |date=30 May 2008 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in July 2009 by the launching of the ''[[Faith and Globalisation initiative|Faith and Globalisation Initiative]]'' with Yale University in the US, [[Durham University]] in the UK and the [[National University of Singapore]] in Asia to deliver a postgraduate programme in partnership with the Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tony Blair launches Faith and Globalisation programme at Durham University |url=http://www.dur.ac.uk/news/newsitem/?itemno=8243|accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yale and Tony Blair Launch Faith and Globalization Initiative |url=http://opa.yale.edu/news/article.aspx?id=6040|publisher=Yale University Office of Public Affairs|accessdate=13 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and family life==
Blair was born in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland&lt;ref name=&quot;Edinburgh Evening-birthplace&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Blair's birthplace is bulldozed in Edinburgh | url = http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/index.cfm?id=1156262006 | work=[[Edinburgh Evening News]] | publisher=Johnston Press plc |date=9 August 2006| accessdate =18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 6 May 1953,&lt;ref name=&quot;EB&quot;/&gt; the second son of [[Leo Blair (senior)|Leo]] and Hazel Blair (''née'' Corscadden). Leo Blair, the illegitimate&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2000/dec/21/adoptionandfostering.localgovernment1 Blair: 'Why adoption is close to my heart'], 21 December 2000, ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; son of two English actors, had been adopted as a baby by Glasgow shipyard worker James Blair and his wife, Mary. Hazel Corscadden was the daughter of George Corscadden, a butcher and [[Orange Order|Orangeman]] who moved to Glasgow in 1916 but returned to (and later died in) [[Ballyshannon]] in 1923, where his wife, Sarah Margaret (née Lipsett), gave birth to Blair's mother, Hazel, above her family's grocery shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ballyshannon.ie/Article_Listings.aspx?tscategory_id=276&amp;category_name=Local+Map |title= Local Map |publisher=[[Ballyshannon]] Town Council |accessdate=22 November 2007 |quote=Lipsett's Grocery Shop: This is the birthplace of Hazel (Corscadden) Blair, mother of British Prime Minister Tony Blair.

===Life as a child===
Blair has one elder brother, [[William Blair (judge)|Sir William Blair]], a [[High Court]] judge, and a younger sister, Sarah. Blair spent the first 19 months of his life at the family home in Paisley Terrace in the Willowbrae area of Edinburgh. During this period, his father worked as a junior tax inspector whilst also studying for a law degree from the [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edinburgh Evening-birthplace&quot;/&gt; In the 1950s, his family spent three and a half years in Adelaide, Australia, where his father was a lecturer in law at the [[University of Adelaide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Tony's big adventure | url = http://observer.guardian.co.uk/secondterm/story/0,8224,944191,00.html|work=The Observer |location=UK | publisher=Guardian Newspapers Ltd. |date=27 April 2003 | accessdate =18 November 2006  | first=Kamal | last=Ahmed}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blairs lived close to the university, in the suburb of [[Dulwich, South Australia|Dulwich]]. The family returned to the UK in the late 1950s, living for a time with Hazel Blair's stepfather, William McClay, and her mother at their home in [[Stepps]], near Glasgow. He spent the remainder of his childhood in [[Durham]], England, where his father lectured at [[Durham University]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Education===
After attending [[Chorister School, Durham|The Chorister School]] in [[Durham]] from 1961 to 1966,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thechoristerschool.com/alumni/rollcall.php |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071021173809/http://www.thechoristerschool.com/alumni/rollcall.php |archivedate=21 October 2007 |title=Alumni Roll Call |work=Durham Chorister School website |accessdate=22 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair boarded at [[Fettes College]], a prestigious independent school in Edinburgh, during which time he met [[Charles Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton|Charlie Falconer]] (a pupil at the rival [[Edinburgh Academy]]), whom he later appointed [[Lord Chancellor]]. He reportedly modelled himself on [[Mick Jagger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/filmandmusic/story/0,,1678432,00.html |title=Tony Blair absolutely modelled himself on Mick Jagger |author=Victoria Powell |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=6 January 2006 |accessdate=22 November 2007 |quote=TV producer Victoria Powell explains how she recreated the PM's adventures in 1970s rock }}&lt;/ref&gt; His teachers were unimpressed with him, his biographer [[John Rentoul (journalist)|John Rentoul]], reported that &quot;All the teachers I spoke to when researching the book said he was a complete pain in the backside and they were very glad to see the back of him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.scotsman.com/edwardblack/Tony-Blairs-revolting-schooldays.2548089.jp |title=Tony Blair's revolting schooldays |author=Ed Black's diary |work=The Scotsman |location=Edinburgh |date=23 July 2004 |accessdate=22 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair was arrested at Fettes, having been mistaken for a burglar as he climbed into his dormitory using a ladder after having been out late.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Blair in a boater, a crude hand gesture, and the Class of '75 | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/news.html?in_article_id=439587&amp;in_page_id=1770&amp;ico=Homepage&amp;icl=TabModule&amp;icc=picbox&amp;ct=5|work=Daily Mail |location=UK | publisher=Associated Newspapers Ltd. |date=3 March 2006 | accessdate =8 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cherie Blair.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Tony Blair's wife, [[Cherie Blair|Cherie Booth]], [[Queen's Counsel|QC]].]]
After Fettes, Blair spent a year in London, where he attempted to find fame as a rock music promoter before reading [[jurisprudence]] at [[St John's College, Oxford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Michaelmas Term 1974 | publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] | series=Complete Alphabetical List of the Resident Members of the University of Oxford | year=1974 | page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a student, he played guitar and sang in a rock band called [[Ugly Rumours (band)|Ugly Rumours]]. During this time, he dated future ''[[American Psycho]]'' director [[Mary Harron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800256658/bio
| title = Mary Harron Biography| accessdate =18 November 2006| year = 2006 | work=Yahoo! Movies| publisher=Yahoo! Inc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was influenced by fellow student and Anglican priest [[Peter Thomson (priest)|Peter Thomson]], who awakened within Blair a deep concern for religious faith and left-wing politics. While Blair was at Oxford, his mother Hazel died of cancer, which greatly affected him. After graduating from Oxford in 1975 with a [[British undergraduate degree classification|Second Class Honours]] BA in Jurisprudence, Blair became a member of [[Lincoln's Inn]], enrolled as a pupil barrister, and met his future wife, [[Cherie Blair|Cherie Booth]] (daughter of the actor [[Antony Booth|Tony Booth]]) at the law chambers founded by [[Derry Irvine, Baron Irvine of Lairg|Derry Irvine]] (who was to be Blair's first Lord Chancellor), [[11 King's Bench Walk Chambers]]. He appears in a number of reported cases, for example as in ''[[Nethermere (St Neots) Ltd v Gardiner]]''&lt;ref&gt;''Nethermere (St Neots) Ltd v Gardiner]]'' [1983] ICR 319&lt;/ref&gt; where he represented employers unsuccessfully in an attempt to deny female factory workers holiday pay.

===Marriage and children===
Blair married [[Cherie Booth]], a Roman Catholic and future [[Queen's Counsel]], on 29 March 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cherieblair.org/highlights/2010/03/my-memory-is-not-infallible.html |title=Events &amp; Visits &amp;#124; Cherie celebrates her 30th Wedding Anniversary this spring |publisher=Cherie Blair |accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have four children: Euan, Nicholas, Kathryn, and Leo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/05/10/blair.facts/index.html CNN.com] Facts: Life and times of Tony Blair&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/822238.stm |title=Blair's son 'drunk and incapable' |publisher=BBC News  |date=6 July 2000 |accessdate=13 July 2010 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=June 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leo, delivered by the Royal Surgeon/Gynaecologist [[Marcus Setchell]], was the first legitimate child born to a serving Prime Minister in over 150 years—since Francis Russell was born to [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]] on 11 July 1849.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/756400.stm |title=Welcome distraction for Tony Blair |publisher=BBC News  |date=20 May 2000 |accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair was criticised when it was discovered that one child had received private tuition from staff at [[Westminster School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/blair-caught-up-in-private-tutor-row-647334.html |title=Blair caught up in private tutor row |work=The Independent |location=UK |date=5 July 2002 |accessdate=20 April 2010 | first1=Marie | last1=Woolf | first2=Richard | last2=Garner}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal health===
Blair suffered from chest pains on Sunday 19 October 2003 and underwent a [[cardioversion]] at [[Hammersmith Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;Wintour, Patrick; Boseley Sarah. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2003/oct/20/labour.politics Tony Blair in heart scare], ''The Guardian'', 20 October 2003. Retrieved 18 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious faith===
In an interview with [[Michael Parkinson]] broadcast on [[ITV1]] on 4 March 2006, Blair referred to the role of his Christian faith in his decision to go to war in Iraq, stating that he had prayed about the issue, and saying that God would judge him for his decision: &quot;I think if you have faith about these things, you realise that judgement is made by other people ... and if you believe in God, it's made by God as well.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Blair 'prayed to God' over Iraq | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4772142.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=3 March 2006 | accessdate =18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A longer exploration of his faith can be found in an interview with ''[[Third Way Magazine]]''. There he says that &quot;I was brought up as [a Christian], but I was not in any real sense a practising one until I went to Oxford. There was an Australian priest at the same college as me who got me interested again. In a sense, it was a rediscovery of religion as something living, that was about the world around me rather than some sort of special one-to-one relationship with a remote Being on high. Suddenly I began to see its social relevance. I began to make sense of the world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thirdway.org.uk/past/showpage.asp?page=43 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927142102/http://www.thirdway.org.uk/past/showpage.asp?page=43 |archivedate=27 September 2007 |title=Practising for Power: Tony Blair  |author=Roy McCloughry |work=[[Third Way Magazine]]: the modern world through Christian eyes |date=14 September 1993 |accessdate=22 November 2007 |quote=Since 1993, Third Way has been talking in depth to men and women who help to shape our society or set the tone of our culture.

At one point [[Alastair Campbell]], Blair's director of strategy and communications, intervened in an interview, preventing the Prime Minister from answering a question about his Christianity, explaining, &quot;We don't do God&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1429109/Campbell-interrupted-Blair-as-he-spoke-of-his-faith-We-dont-do-God.html|title=Campbell interrupted Blair as he spoke of his faith: 'We don't do God' |author=Colin Brown |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=3 May 2003 |accessdate=28 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cherie Blair's friend and &quot;spiritual guru&quot; [[Carole Caplin]] is credited with introducing her and her husband to various [[New Age]] symbols and beliefs, including &quot;magic pendants&quot; known as &quot;BioElectric Shields&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,856064,00.html &quot;Ev'rybody must get stones&quot;], The Observer, 8 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The most controversial of the Blairs' New Age practices occurred when on holiday in Mexico. The couple, wearing only bathing costumes, took part in a rebirthing procedure, which involved smearing mud and fruit over each other's bodies while sitting in a steam bath.&lt;ref&gt;''How Mumbo-Jumbo Conquered the World'', [[Francis Wheen]], Harper Perennial 2004, ISBN 0-00-714097-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Later on, Blair questioned the Pope's attitude towards homosexuality, arguing that religious leaders must start &quot;rethinking&quot; the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/7987566.stm |title=Blair questions Papal gay policy |publisher=BBC News  |date=8 April 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was later rebuked by [[Vincent Nichols]], the new archbishop of Westminster, who said that Catholic thinking was 'rather different' from the kind promoted by the former prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Steve Doughty |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1169204/Catholic-leaders-rebuke-Blair.html |title=Catholic leader's rebuke for Blair |work=The Daily Mail |date=4 November 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 December 2007, it was disclosed that Blair, who in 1996, had been reprimanded by Cardinal [[Basil Hume]] for receiving [[Holy Communion]] at Mass despite not being a Catholic, in contravention of canon law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/g2/story/0,,2082533,00.html |title=Blair doesn't need intermediaries to communicate with God.

He reported his Palestinian guide as bemoaning the fate of his nation looking to heaven and saying “Moses, Jesus, Mohammed: why did they all have to come here?&quot; For Blair the Holy City is &quot;a good place to reflect on religion: a source of so much inspiration; an excuse for so much evil.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/8558 |title=Tony Blair addresses Obama's first annual National Prayer Breakfast |publisher=Ekklesia|date=5 February 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Alastair Campbell's diary, Blair often read the Bible before taking any important decisions. He states that Blair had a &quot;wobble&quot; and considered changing his mind on the eve of the [[Bombing of Iraq (December 1998)|bombing of Iraq in 1998]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/jan/14/tony-blair-alastair-campbell-diaries Alastair Campbell diaries: How Blair's Bible reading prompted Iraq 'wobble'] guardian.co.uk, Friday 14 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==
Blair joined the Labour Party shortly after graduating from Oxford in 1975. During the early 1980s, he was involved in Labour politics in [[Hackney South and Shoreditch (UK Parliament constituency)|Hackney South and Shoreditch]], where he aligned himself with the &quot;[[soft left]]&quot; of the party. In 1982 Blair was selected as the Labour candidate in the safe [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] seat of [[Beaconsfield (UK Parliament constituency)|Beaconsfield]], where there was a forthcoming by-election. Although Blair lost the [[Beaconsfield by-election, 1982|Beaconsfield by-election]] (the only election he lost in his 25-year political career) and he lost 10% of the vote, he acquired a profile within the party. In contrast to his later centrism, Blair made it clear in a letter he wrote to Labour leader Michael Foot in July 1982, that he had &quot;come to Socialism through Marxism&quot; and considered himself on the left. The letter was eventually published in June 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Tony | last = Blair | title = The full text of Tony Blair's letter to Michael Foot written in July 1982 | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/06/16/nletter116.xml&amp;sSheet=/news/2006/06/16/ixuknews.html  | work=The Daily Telegraph | publisher=Telegraph Media Group Ltd. |date = July 1982| accessdate =18 November 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Blair found the newly created constituency of Sedgefield, a notionally safe Labour seat near where he had grown up in [[Durham]]. The branch had not made a nomination, and Blair visited them. Several sitting MPs displaced by boundary changes were interested in securing selection to fight the seat. With the crucial support of [[John Burton (political agent)|John Burton]], Blair won their endorsement; at the last minute, he was added to the short list and won the selection over [[Les Huckfield]]. Burton later became Blair's [[Election agent|agent]] and one of his most trusted and longest-standing allies.

Blair's election literature in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 UK general election]] endorsed left-wing policies that Labour advocated in the early 1980s. He called for Britain to leave the [[European Economic Community|EEC]], though he had told his selection conference that he personally favoured continuing membership. He also supported [[nuclear disarmament|unilateral nuclear disarmament]] as a member of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]]. Blair was helped on the campaign trail by soap opera actress [[Pat Phoenix]], his father-in-law's girlfriend. Blair was elected as MP for Sedgefield despite the party's landslide defeat in the general election.

In his [[maiden speech]] in the House of Commons on 6 July 1983, Blair stated, &quot;I am a socialist not through reading a textbook that has caught my intellectual fancy, nor through unthinking tradition, but because I believe that, at its best, socialism corresponds most closely to an existence that is both rational and moral. It stands for cooperation, not confrontation; for fellowship, not fear. It stands for equality.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2006/4/20/170221.shtml | title = On Democracy | accessdate =18 November 2006| last = Navrozov | first = Lev |date=21 April 2006 | work=NewsMax.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.logosjournal.com/issue_3.4/seddon.htm | title = America's Friend: Reflections on Tony Blair| accessdate =18 November 2006| last = Seddon| first = Mark | year = 2004| work=Logos 3.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour Party is declared in its constitution to be a [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]] party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.labour.org.uk/aboutlabour|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061116065904/http://www.labour.org.uk/aboutlabour|archivedate = 16 November 2006| title = About Labour| accessdate =18 November 2006| year = 2006| publisher=The Labour Party}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than a [[social democratic]] party; Blair himself organised this declaration of Labour to be a socialist party when he dealt with the change to the party's [[Clause IV]] in their constitution.

Once elected, Blair's political ascent was rapid. He received his first front-bench appointment in 1984 as assistant Treasury spokesman. In May 1985, he appeared on BBC's [[Question Time]], arguing that the Conservative Government's Public Order White Paper was a threat to civil liberties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/programme/LCAQ520E |title=BBC Archive |publisher=BBC Programme Catalogue|accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Blair demanded an inquiry into the [[Bank of England]]'s decision to rescue the collapsed [[Johnson Matthey]] Bank in October 1985 and embarrassed the government by finding an EEC report critical of British economic policy that had been countersigned by a member of the Conservative government.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} By this time, Blair was aligned with the reforming tendencies in the party (headed by leader [[Neil Kinnock]]) and was promoted after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1987|1987 election]] to the shadow Trade and Industry team as spokesman on the [[City of London]]. In 1987, he stood for election to the [[Shadow Cabinet]], receiving 71 votes.&lt;ref&gt;John Carvel, &quot;A fresh team of 'Yaks' will take on Labour's burden&quot;, ''The Guardian'', 9 July 1987, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blair became [[Shadow Home Secretary]] under [[John Smith (UK politician)|John Smith]]. John Smith died suddenly in 1994 of a heart attack. Blair beat [[John Prescott]] and [[Margaret Beckett]] in the [[Labour Party (UK) leadership election, 1994|subsequent leadership election]] and became [[Leader of the Opposition (UK)|Leader of the Opposition]]. As is customary for the holder of that office, Blair was appointed a [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Councillor]].

===Leader of the Labour Party===
Blair announced at the end of his speech at the 1994 Labour Party conference that he intended to replace [[Clause IV]] of the party's constitution with a new statement of aims and values. This involved the deletion of the party's stated commitment to &quot;the common ownership of the means of production and exchange&quot;, which was widely interpreted as referring to wholesale nationalisation.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 326&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher=Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= 326|url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At a special conference in April 1995, the clause was replaced by a statement that the party is 'democratic socialist'.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 326&quot;/&gt;

He inherited the Labour leadership at a time when the party was ascendant over the Tories in the opinion polls since the Tory government's reputation for monetary excellence was left in tatters by the [[Black Wednesday]] economic disaster of September 1992. Blair's election as leader saw Labour support surge higher still&lt;ref name=&quot;news&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/vote_2005/basics/4393323.stm |work=BBC News  | title=1997: Labour landslide ends Tory rule | date=15 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; in spite of the continuing economic recovery and fall in unemployment that the Conservative government (led by [[John Major]]) had overseen since the end of the 1990–92 [[Early 1990s recession|recession]].&lt;ref name=&quot;news&quot; /&gt;

At the 1996 Labour Party conference, Blair stated that his three top priorities on coming to office were &quot;education, education, and education&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6564933.stm &quot;Education, education, education&quot;] BBC News,14 May 2007. Retrieved 8 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aided by the unpopularity of John Major's Conservative government (itself deeply divided over the European Union), &quot;New Labour&quot; won a landslide victory in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|1997 general election]], ending 18 years of Conservative Party government, with the heaviest Conservative defeat since [[United Kingdom general election, 1832|1832]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Kingdom|title=Government and Politics in Britain: An Introduction|publisher=Polity Press|edition=3rd|month=April|year=2003|isbn=978-0-7456-2594-2|page=299}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Smith's leadership of the Labour Party, there were discussions with [[Paddy Ashdown]], the leader of the [[Liberal Democrats]], about forming a [[coalition]] government if the next general election resulted in a [[hung parliament]]. After Blair became leader, these talks continued – despite virtually every opinion poll since late 1992 having shown Labour with enough support to form a majority. However, the scale of the Labour victory meant that there was ultimately never any need for a coalition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epolitix.com/latestnews/article-detail/newsarticle/top-ten-lib-dem-breakthrough-moments/ |title=Top Ten: Lib Dem 'breakthrough moments' |publisher=ePolitix.com |date=24 April 2010 |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prime Minister==
{{Main|Premiership of Tony Blair}}

Blair became the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] on [[United Kingdom general election, 1997|2 May 1997]], serving concurrently as [[First Lord of the Treasury]], [[Minister for the Civil Service]] and Leader of the Labour Party. The 43-year old Blair became the youngest person to become Prime Minister since [[Robert Jenkinson, 2nd Earl of Liverpool|Lord Liverpool]] in 1812, at the age of 42.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/page4.asp| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070604003655/http://www.number-10.gov.uk/output/page4.asp| archivedate = 4 June 2007| title = Biography: The Prime Minister Tony Charles Lynton Blair| accessdate =18 November 2006| publisher=Prime Minister's Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; With victories in 1997, [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001]], and [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005]], Blair was the Labour Party's longest-serving prime minister, the only person to lead the party to three consecutive general election victories.

===Northern Ireland===
[[File:TonyBlairArmagh1998.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Blair addressing a crowd in [[Armagh]] in 1998.]]
His contribution towards assisting the [[Northern Ireland Peace Process]] by helping to negotiate the [[Good Friday Agreement]] (after 30 years of conflict) was widely recognised.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News Archive, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/10/newsid_2450000/2450823.stm &quot;1998: Northern Ireland peace deal reached&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philip Stephens, [http://www.ft.com/cms/s/36fa51da-fe30-11db-bdc7-000b5df10621.html &quot;Blair’s remarkable record&quot;], ''Financial Times'', 10 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Omagh Bombing]] on 15 August 1998, by members of the [[Real IRA]] opposed to the peace process, which killed 29 people and wounded hundreds, Blair visited the [[County Tyrone]] town and met with victims at [[Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;Telegraph.co.uk: ''Omagh, Northern Ireland's worst atrocity'' 24 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military intervention and the War on Terror===
In his first six years in office Blair ordered British troops into battle five times, more than any other prime minister in British history. This included Iraq in both [[Bombing of Iraq (December 1998)|1998]] and [[Iraq War|2003]]; [[Kosovo War|Kosovo]] (1999); [[Sierra Leone Civil War|Sierra Leone]] (2000) and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]] (2001).&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/6361771.stm Blair: The Inside Story] [[BBC News]], 22 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kosovo War, which Blair had advocated on moral grounds, was initially a failure when it relied solely on air strikes; the threat of a ground offensive would convince Serbia's [[Slobodan Milošević]] to withdraw. Blair had been a major advocate for a ground offensive, which [[Bill Clinton]] was reluctant to do, and would order that 50,000 soldiers – most of the available British Army – should be made ready for action.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, Andrew; ''A History of Modern Britain'' (2008 printing); page 550&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the limited [[Operation Palliser]] in Sierra Leone would swiftly swing the tide against the rebel forces; before deployment, the [[United Nations Mission in Sierra Leone]] had been on the verge of collapse.&lt;ref&gt;Gberie, Lansana (2005). ''A Dirty War in West Africa: the RUF and the Destruction of Sierra Leone'';page 176. Indiana UP.&lt;/ref&gt; Palliser had been intended as an evacuation mission but [[David Richards (British Army officer)|Brigadier David Richards]] (now General Sir) was able to convince Blair to allow him to expand the role; at the time, Richards' action was not known and Blair was assumed to be behind it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Little&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=The brigadier who saved Sierra Leone |first=Allan |last=Little |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/8682505.stm |newspaper=[[BBC News]] |date=15 May 2010 |accessdate=20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair also ordered [[Operation Barras]], a highly successful [[Special Air Service|SAS]]/[[Parachute Regiment]] strike to rescue hostages from a Sierra Leone rebel group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2000/sep/11/sierraleone5 &quot;After 16 long days, free in 20 minutes&quot;: The Guardian, 11 September 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Andrew Marr]] has argued that the success of ground attacks, real and threatened, over air strikes alone would be influential on how Blair planned the Iraq War, and that the success of the first three wars Blair fought &quot;played to his sense of himself as a moral war leader&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, Andrew; ''A History of Modern Britain'' (2008 printing); page 551&lt;/ref&gt; When asked in 2010 if the success of Palliser may have &quot;embolden[ed] British politicians&quot; to think of military action as a policy option, General Sir David Richards would admit there &quot;might be something in that&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Little&quot;/&gt;

From the start of the War on Terror in 2001, Blair strongly supported the [[Foreign policy of the George W. Bush administration|foreign policy]] of George W. Bush, participating in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|2001 invasion of Afghanistan]] and [[2003 invasion of Iraq]]. The invasion of Iraq was particularly controversial, as it attracted widespread public opposition and 139 of Blair's MPs opposed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-10518842 |work=BBC News  | title=The rise and fall of New Labour | date=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, he faced criticism over the policy itself and the circumstances in which it was decided upon. Alastair Campbell described Blair's statement that the intelligence on WMDs was &quot;beyond doubt&quot; as his &quot;assessment of the assessment that was given to him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by satirist [[Armando Ianucci]] and called his 'favourite sentence of the Inquiry so far' Radio 5 Live 21 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Blair stated that he would have supported removing Saddam Hussein from power even in the face of proof that he had no such weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Riazat Butt and Richard Norton-Taylor |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2009/dec/12/tony-blair-iraq-chilcot-inquiry |title=Tony Blair admits: I would have invaded Iraq anyway |work=Guardian |date=12 December 2009 |accessdate=20 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playwright [[Harold Pinter]] and former Malaysian Prime Minister [[Mahathir Mohammad]] accused Blair of war crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-08/01/content_8890239.htm |title=Malaysian former PM Mahathir accuses Tony Blair as war criminal|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|date=1 August 2008 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=David Fickling |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/dec/07/iraq.booksnews |title=Pinter demands war crimes trial for Blair|work=The Guardian |date= 7 December 2005|accessdate=20 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testifying before the [[Iraq Inquiry]] on 29 January 2010, Blair said Saddam was a &quot;monster and I believe he threatened not just the region but the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/8485694.stm|title=Iraq inquiry hears defiant Blair say: I'd do it again|publisher=BBC News |date=29 January 2010|accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blair said that British and American attitude towards Saddam Hussein had &quot;changed dramatically&quot; after 11 September attacks.

===Relationship with Parliament===
One of his first acts as Prime Minister was to replace the then twice-weekly 15-minute sessions of [[Prime Minister's Questions]] held on Tuesdays and Thursdays with a single 30-minute session on Wednesdays. In addition to PMQs, Blair held monthly press conferences at which he fielded questions from journalists&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page3347.asp | title = PM: Saddam and his regime will be removed| accessdate =21 November 2006|date=25 March 2003| work=Prime Minister's Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Matthew | last = Tempest | title = Tony Blair's press conference | url = http://politics.guardian.co.uk/media/story/0,,1299024,00.html | work=The Guardian | publisher=Guardian Newspapers Ltd. |date=7 September 2004 | accessdate =21 November 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and – from 2002 – broke precedent by agreeing to give evidence twice yearly before the most senior Commons select committee, The Liaison Committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1392335/Blair-agrees-to-face-grilling-by-select-committee-critics.html &quot;Blair agrees to face grilling by select committee critics&quot;] Daily Telegraph, 27 April 2002.

As a combined result of the [[Blair-Brown pact]], Iraq war and low approval ratings, pressure built up within the Labour party for Blair to resign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/International/story?id=2405434&amp;page=1 Tony Blair to Resign in a Year], [[ABC News]], 7 September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,482199,00.html The End of the Tony Show], ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', 10 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 September 2006, Blair publicly stated he would step down as party leader by the time of the [[Trades Union Congress]] (TUC) conference held 10–13 September 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;iwillquit&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title = I will quit within a year —Blair| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/5322094.stm|publisher=BBC News |date=7 September 2006| accessdate =18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; having promised to serve a full term during the previous general election campaign. On 10 May 2007, during a speech at the Trimdon Labour Club, Blair announced his intention to resign as both Labour Party leader and Prime Minister.

==Policies==
In 2001, Blair said, &quot;We are a left of centre party, pursuing economic prosperity and social justice as partners and not as opposites&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Polly Toynbee, Michael White and Patrick Wintour [http://society.guardian.co.uk/futureforpublicservices/story/0,,550059,00.html &quot;We're a left-of-centre party pursuing prosperity and social justice&quot;], ''The Guardian'', 11 September 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
Blair has rarely applied such labels to himself, but he promised before the 1997 election that New Labour would govern &quot;from the radical centre&quot;, and according to one lifelong Labour Party member, has always described himself as a [[social democracy|social democrat]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hulver.com/scoop/story/2007/5/17/73955/4678 &quot;The Death of Socialism&quot;], 17 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, Labour Party backbenchers and other left wing critics typically place Blair to the [[right of centre]].&lt;ref&gt;Neal Lawson, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,2060360,00.html &quot;A decade of Blair has left the Labour party on its knees&quot;], ''The Guardian'', 19 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A [[YouGov]] opinion poll in 2005 also found that a small majority of British voters, including many New Labour supporters, place Blair on the right of the political spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;YouGov UK Polling Report, [http://www.ukpollingreport.co.uk/blog/archives/30 ''Left vs Right''], 23 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Kellner, [http://www.newstatesman.com/200210280019 &quot;What's left of the Labour leader?&quot;], ''New Stateman'', 28 October 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Financial Times]]'' on the other hand has argued that Blair is not conservative, but instead a populist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/9526a670-04dc-11dc-80ed-000b5df10621.html &quot;Why Blair was no conservative&quot;], ''Financial Times'', 18 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Clause IV]] of the Labour Party's constitution defines the party as &quot;Democratic Socialist&quot;.

Critics and admirers tend to agree that Blair's electoral success was based on his ability to occupy the centre ground and appeal to voters across the political spectrum, to the extent that he has been fundamentally at odds with traditional Labour Party values.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Richards, [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/politics/article2531627.ece &quot;Blair the politician: A conjuror who lost touch with his party&quot;], ''The Belfast Telegraph'', 11 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Some left wing critics have argued that Blair has overseen the final stage of a long term shift of the Labour Party to the right, and that very little now remains of a Labour Left.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Marquesee, [http://pubs.socialistreviewindex.org.uk/isj91/marqusee.htm &quot;Labour's long march to the right&quot;], ''International Socialism'', Issue 91, Summer 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charlie Kimber, [http://web.archive.org/web/20060321091802/http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/article.php?article_id=5147 &quot;Can the left reclaim the Labour Party?&quot;], ''Socialist Worker'', 2 August 2002&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that Blair's long term dominance of the centre has forced his Conservative opponents to shift a long distance to the left, in order to challenge his [[hegemony]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Rice-Oxley, [http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0511/p01s03-woeu.html &quot;Tony Blair's decade of peace and war&quot;], ''The Christian Science Monitor'', 11 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Cowell, [http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/10/01/news/brits.php &quot;Tory leader urges British opposition to stake out 'center ground'&quot;], ''International Herald Tribune'', 1 October 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Blair has raised taxes (but did not increase income tax for high-earners{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}); introduced a minimum wage and some new employment rights (while keeping Margaret Thatcher's anti-trade union legislation{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}); introduced significant constitutional reforms; promoted new rights for gay people in the [[Civil Partnership Act 2004]]; and signed treaties integrating Britain more closely with the EU.

===Environmental record===
Blair has criticised other governments for not doing enough to solve [[Global warming|global climate change]]. In a 1997 visit to the United States, he made a comment on &quot;great industrialised nations&quot; that fail to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Again in 2003, Blair went before the [[United States Congress]] and said that climate change &quot;cannot be ignored&quot;, insisting &quot;we need to go beyond even [[Kyoto Protocol|Kyoto]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/opinions/2003/1118energy_sandalow.aspx Tony Blair and Global Warming] Brookings, 18 November 2003.

===Foreign policy===

====Relationship with the United States====
[[File:Blair Bush Whitehouse (2004-11-12).jpg|thumb|250px|Tony Blair and [[George W. Bush]] shake hands after their press conference in the East Room of the White House on 12 November 2004.]]
Along with enjoying a close relationship with Bill Clinton, Blair formed a strong political alliance with George W. Bush, particularly in the area of foreign policy. At one point, [[Nelson Mandela]] described Blair as &quot;the U.S. foreign minister&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Mandela condemns US stance on Iraq | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/2710181.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=30 January 2003|accessdate =18 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair has also often openly been referred to as &quot;Bush's poodle&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Blair battles &quot;poodle&quot; jibes | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2721513.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=3 February 2003|accessdate =30 November 2006 | first=Nick | last=Assinder}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kendall Myers]], a senior analyst at the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], reportedly said that he felt &quot;a little ashamed&quot; of Bush's treatment of the Prime Minister and that his attempts to influence US policy were typically ignored: &quot;It was a done deal from the beginning, it was a one-sided relationship that was entered into with open eyes... There was nothing, no payback, no sense of reciprocity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Bush 'routinely ignoring Blair' | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6158435.stm |publisher=BBC News  |date=30 November 2006|accessdate =30 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For his part, Bush lauded Blair and the UK. In his post-[[11 September attacks|11 September]] speech, for example, he stated that &quot;America has no truer friend than Great Britain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2001/09/20010920-8.html |title=Address to a Joint Session of Congress and the American People |author=[[George W.

Once again, we are joined together in a great cause – so honoured the British Prime Minister has crossed an ocean to show his unity of purpose with America. Thank you for coming, friend. (Applause.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alliance between Bush and Blair seriously damaged Blair's standing in the eyes of many British people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foreignaffairs/story/0,,1828225,00.html |title=Stand up to US, voters tell Blair |author=Julian Glover and Ewen MacAskill |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=25 July 2006 |accessdate=22 November 2007 |quote=Britain should take a much more robust and independent approach to the United States, according to a Guardian/ICM poll published today, which finds strong public opposition to Blair's close working relationship with President Bush. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair argued it is in Britain's interest to &quot;protect and strengthen the bond&quot; with the United States regardless of who is in the White House.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page6526.asp | title = PM's speech on US Elections| accessdate =29 May 2007|date=3 November 2004| publisher=Prime Minister's Office }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a perception of one-sided compromising personal and political closeness led to serious discussion of the term &quot;Poodle-ism&quot; in the UK media, to describe the &quot;[[Special Relationship]]&quot; of the UK government and Prime Minister with the US White House and President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hugo Young in Washington |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/nov/14/iraq.foreignpolicy |title=Hugo Young: Blair has not been a poodle, but poodleism still beckons |work=The Guardian |date= 14 November 2002|accessdate=20 April 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; A revealing conversation between Bush and Blair, with the former addressing the latter as &quot;[[Yo, Blair|Yo [or Yeah], Blair]]&quot; was recorded when they did not know a microphone was live at the G8 conference in Russia in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/5188258.stm |title=Transcript: Bush and Blair's unguarded chat|publisher=BBC News  |date=18 July 2006 |accessdate=20 April 2010}}.

====Middle East policy and links with Israel====
According to comments in the book, ''Blair'', written by [[Anthony Seldon]], Blair had a deep feeling for [[Israel]], born in part from his faith.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Seldon, ''Blair'', (London: Free Press, 2005), p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; Blair has been a longtime member of the pro-Israel lobby group [[Labour Friends of Israel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Uni&quot;&gt;Assaf Uni, [http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/932399.html Finance scandal has local community worried], [[Haaretz]], 10 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Blair met [[Michael Levy, Baron Levy|Michael Levy, later Lord Levy]], a pop music mogul and fundraiser.&lt;ref name=&quot;bagman&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/funding/story/0,,1734529,00.html?gusrc=rss | title=There was once a jolly bagman | author=Euan Ferguson |work=Guardian |location=UK|date=19 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair and Levy became close friends and tennis partners.

During his first visit to Israel, Blair thought the Israelis bugged him in his car. He also went on to claim that the Israeli prime minister was merely an &quot;armour-plated bullshitter&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/wintour-and-watt/2011/jan/20/alastaircampbell-binyamin-netanyahu | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Nicholas | last=Watt | title=Britain believes Israeli PM Netanyahu is an 'armour-plated bullshitter' – Alastair Campbell | date=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levy ran the Labour Leader's Office Fund to finance Blair's campaign before the 1997 General Election and raised £12m towards Labour’s landslide victory, Levy was rewarded with a [[life peer|peerage]], and in 2002, Blair appointed Levy as his personal envoy to the Middle East. Levy praised Blair for his 'solid and committed support of the State of Israel'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishcare.org/events/ Jewish Care], Fundraising Dinner 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2092803,00.html |title=Lord Cashpoint's touch of money magic |date=19 March 2006 |last=Wavell |first=Stuart |work=The Sunday Times |location=UK |accessdate =21 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tam Dalyell, while [[Father of the House]] of Commons, suggested in 2003 that Blair's foreign policy decisions were unduly influenced by a &quot;cabal&quot; of &quot;Jewish advisers&quot;, including Levy and [[Peter Mandelson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/dalyell-attacks-jewish-cabal-538006.html |title=Dalyell attacks 'Jewish cabal'|work=The Independent |date=4 May 2003 |accessdate=20 April 2010 | location=London | first1=Jo | last1=Dillon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blair, on coming to office, had been 'cool towards the right-wing [[Benjamin Netanyahu|Netanyahu]] government'.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Seldon, ''Blair'', p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; After the election in 1999 of [[Ehud Barak]], with whom Blair forged a close relationship, he became much more sympathetic to Israel.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; From 2001 Blair also built up a relationship with Barak's successor, [[Ariel Sharon]], and responded positively to [[Yasser Arafat|Arafat]], whom he had met thirteen times since becoming prime minister and regarded as essential to future negotiations.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In 2004, 50 former diplomats, including ambassadors to [[Baghdad]] and [[Tel Aviv]], stated they had 'watched with deepening concern' at Britain following the US into war in Iraq in 2003. They criticised Blair's support for the [[Road map for peace]] which included the retaining of [[Israeli settlement]]s on the [[West Bank]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foreignaffairs/story/0,11538,1203898,00.html Diplomats attack Blair's Israel policy], Guardian Unlimited, [[Matthew Tempest]], 26 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 Blair was criticised for his failure to immediately call for a ceasefire in the [[2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict]].  ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper claimed that at a cabinet meeting before Blair left for a summit with Bush on 28 July 2006, a significant number of ministers pressured Blair to publicly criticise Israel over the scale of deaths and destruction in Lebanon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://observer.guardian.co.uk/world/story/0,,1833538,00.html Cabinet in open revolt over Blair's Israel policy], ''[[The Observer]]'', 30 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Blair was criticised for his solid stance alongside US President George W.

In March 2010 the [[Advisory Committee on Business Appointments]] revealed that 14 months after resigning as Prime Minister, Blair had served as a paid business consultant to an oil firm with interests in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Blair's fight to keep his oil cash secret: Former PM's deals are revealed as his earnings since 2007 reach £20million|author=Jason Groves|work=Daily Mail |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1259030/Tony-Blairs-secret-dealings-South-Korean-oil-firm-UI-Energy-Corp.html |date=19 March 2010 |accessdate=21 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news raised concerns that he had profited financially from contacts he made during the Iraq war.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/03/20/blair-s-secret-pay-deal-with-iraq-oil-firm-115875-22125177/ Daily Mirror &quot;Tony Blair's secret lucrative advisory job with Iraq oil firm&quot; 20 March 2010].

====Syria and Libya====
A Freedom of Information request by ''The Sunday Times'' in 2012 revealed that Blair's government considered knighting Syria's President [[Bashar al-Assad]]. The documents also showed that Blair was willing to appear alongside Assad at a joint press conference even though the Syrians would probably have settled for a farewell handshake for the cameras; British officials sought to manipulate the media to portray Assad in a favourable light; and Blair's aides tried to help Assad's &quot;photogenic&quot; wife boost her profile. The newspaper noted:

{{quote|The Arab leader was granted audiences with the Queen and the Prince of Wales, lunch with Blair at Downing Street, a platform in parliament and many other privileges. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.

Blair was reported to have been supported by [[Rupert Murdoch]], the founder of the [[News Corporation]] [[media conglomerate|organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaby Hinsliff, [http://observer.guardian.co.uk/politics/story/0,,1827023,00.html &quot;The PM, the mogul and the secret agenda&quot;], ''The Observer'', 23 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, while leader of the Opposition, Blair disclosed in the Commons register of interests that he was a guest of Murdoch when he flew to meet him in [[Hayman Island]].&lt;ref name='R000977'&gt;{{cite news | first= Andrew| last= Grice| title=Cameron, Murdoch and a Greek island freebie | date=24 October 2008 | url =http://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/cameron-murdoch-and-a-greek-island-freebie-971470.html |work=The Independent |location=UK | accessdate =25 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 Blair became Godfather to one of Rupert Murdoch's children. Apparently Blair was 'robed in white for the ceremony' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-14785501 | work=BBC News | title=Tony Blair 'godfather to Rupert Murdoch's daughter' | date=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contacts with UK media proprietors===
A [[Cabinet Office]] [[freedom of information]] response, released the day after Blair handed over power to Gordon Brown, documents Blair having various official phone calls and meetings with [[Rupert Murdoch]] of [[News Corporation]] and [[Richard Desmond]] of ''Northern and Shell Media''.&lt;ref name='spoke'&gt;{{cite news | title=Blair and Murdoch spoke days before Iraq war | date= 19 July 2007| url =http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2007/jul/19/freedomofinformation.iraq |work=The Guardian |location=UK | accessdate =26 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The response includes contacts &quot;clearly of an official nature&quot; in the specified period, but excludes contacts &quot;not clearly of an official nature.&quot;&lt;ref name='matter'&gt;{{cite news | first= Kim| last= Fletcher| title=The meetings that matter between Murdoch and Blair | date= 10 July 2006| url =http://politics.guardian.co.uk/foi/story/0,,1818852,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=UK | accessdate =26 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No details were given of the subjects discussed.
In the period between September 2002 and April 2005, Blair and Murdoch are documented speaking 6 times; three times in the 9 days before the [[Iraq war]], including the eve of the 20 March US and UK invasion, and on 29 January 25 April and 3 October 2004. Between January 2003 and February 2004, Blair had three meetings with Richard Desmond; on 29 January and 3 September 2003 and 23 February 2004.&lt;ref name='foi'&gt;{{cite news | title=When Murdoch met Blair – information released | url =http://www.bindmans.com/index.php?id=289 | work=Bindmans | accessdate =26 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='vs'&gt;{{cite news | title=Blair &amp; Murdoch – FOI v Campbell | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/cgi-perl/mt/mt-comments.cgi |work=BBC  | accessdate =26 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The information was disclosed after a three and a half year battle by the [[Liberal Democrats]]' [[Lord Avebury]].&lt;ref name='spoke'/&gt; Lord Avebury's initial October 2003 information request was dismissed by then leader of the Lords, [[Baroness Amos]].&lt;ref name='spoke'/&gt; A following complaint was rejected, with [[Downing Street]] claiming the information compromised free and frank discussions, while [[Cabinet Office]] claimed releasing the timing of the PM's contacts with individuals is undesirable, as it might lead to the content of the discussions being disclosed.&lt;ref name='spoke'/&gt; While awaiting a following appeal from Lord Avebury, the cabinet office announced that it would release the information.
Lord Avebury said: &quot;The public can now scrutinise the timing of his (Murdoch's) contacts with the former Prime Minister, to see whether they can be linked to events in the outside world.&quot;&lt;ref name='spoke'/&gt;

Blair appeared before the [[Leveson Inquiry]] on Monday 28 May 2012.&lt;ref name='Leveson'&gt;{{cite news | title=Tony Blair to appear before Leveson Inquiry | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-18203161 |work=BBC  | accessdate =25 May 2012 | date=25 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his appearance, a protester, later named as David Lawley-Wakelin, got into the court-room and claimed he was guilty of war crimes before being dragged out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/may/28/tony-blair-protester-leveson-inquiry?intcmp=239 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first1=Peter | last1=Walker | first2=Esther | last2=Addley | first3=Lisa | last3=O'Carroll | title=Tony Blair accused of war crimes by protester at Leveson inquiry | date=28 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media portrayal===
Blair is acknowledged by most{{Who|date=July 2010}} to be a highly skilful media performer who comes over as charismatic, informal, and articulate.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} A few months after becoming Prime Minister he gave a tribute to [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] on the morning of her death in August 1997, in which he famously described her as &quot;the People's Princess&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Buerkle |first=Tom |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/09/01/news/01iht-london.html?pagewanted=1 |title=Charles Takes Diana's Body Home From Paris – World Mourns the 'People's Princess' |work=The New York Times  |date=1 September 1997 |accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1556863/Tony-coined-the-peoples-princess.html |title=Tony coined the 'people's princess' |publisher=Telegraph |date=9 July 2007 |accessdate=20 July 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After taking office in 1997, Blair gave particular prominence to his press secretary, who became known as the [[Prime Minister's Official Spokesman]] (the two roles have since been separated). Blair's first PMOS was Alastair Campbell, who served in that role from May 1997 to 8 June 2001, after which he served as the Prime Minister's Director of Communications and Strategy until his resignation on 29 August 2003 in the aftermath of the [[Hutton Inquiry]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

==Relationship with Labour Party==
Blair's apparent refusal to set a date for his departure was criticised by the British press and Members of Parliament. It has been reported that a number of cabinet ministers believed that Blair's timely departure from office would be required to be able to win a fourth election.&lt;ref name=independent-09-04-06/&gt; Some ministers viewed Blair's announcement of policy initiatives in September 2006 as an attempt to draw attention away from these issues.&lt;ref name=independent-09-04-06&gt;{{cite news|title='Deluded': Extraordinary attack on Blair by Cabinet |date=4 September 2006 |work=The Independent |location=UK |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/politics/article1325433.ece  | first=Francis | last=Elliott | accessdate=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blair forged friendships with several conservative European leaders, including [[Silvio Berlusconi]] of Italy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1873866.stm &quot;Blair attacked over right-wing EU links&quot;] BBC News, 15 March 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Angela Merkel]] of Germany&lt;ref&gt;Ed Vulliamy, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,3604,1601234,00.html &quot;By their friends shall we know the Sultans of Bling: Blair's relationships with Berlusconi, Bush and Murdoch have defined his premiership.

===Gordon Brown===
{{See also|Blair–Brown deal}}
After the death of [[John Smith (UK politician)|John Smith]] in 1994, Blair and his close colleague Gordon Brown (they shared an office at the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]]) were both seen as possible candidates for the party leadership. They agreed not to stand against each other, it is said, as part of a supposed Blair-Brown pact. Brown, who considered himself the senior of the two, understood that Blair would give way to him: opinion polls soon indicated, however, that Blair appeared to enjoy greater support among voters.&lt;ref&gt;A MORI opinion poll published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' on 15 May found that, among the general public, Blair had the support of 32%, John Prescott 19%, Margaret Beckett 14%, Gordon Brown 9% and [[Robin Cook]] 5%.&lt;/ref&gt; Their relationship in power became so turbulent that (it was reported) the [[Deputy Prime Minister|deputy prime minister]], John Prescott, often had to act as &quot;marriage guidance counsellor&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://politics.guardian.co.uk/labour2003/comment/0,,1056215,00.html | title = A marriage on the rocks | author=[[Andrew Rawnsley]] |work=The Observer |location=UK | publisher=Guardian Newspapers Ltd. | date = 5 October 2003 | accessdate =5 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2010 election campaign Blair publicly endorsed Gordon Brown's leadership, praising the way he had handled the financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2010/mar/30/tony-blair-speech-gordon-brown-tories Tony Blair throws himself into election campaign with praise for Gordon Brown and harsh words for Tories&quot;] The Guardian, 30 March 2010. Retrieved 30 March 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Prime Ministerial career==

===Diplomacy===
On 27 June 2007, Blair officially resigned as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] after ten years in office, and he was officially confirmed as Middle East [[Diplomacy|envoy]] for the United Nations, European Union, United States, and Russia.&lt;ref name=&quot;envoy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Blair becomes Middle East envoy |work=BBC News  |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/6244358.stm |date=27 June 2007 |accessdate=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair originally indicated that he would retain his parliamentary seat after his resignation as Prime Minister came into effect; however, on being confirmed for the Middle East role he resigned from the Commons by taking up an [[List of Stewards of the Chiltern Hundreds|office of profit]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent27June2007&quot; /&gt; President George W. Bush had preliminary talks with Blair to ask him to take up the envoy role. White House sources stated that &quot;both Israel and the Palestinians had signed up to the proposal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US 'wants Blair' for Mid-East job|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6222848.stm|publisher=BBC News |date=21 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blair may&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=US approves of Blair as possible Middle East envoy|author=Matthew Tempest and Mark Tran|date=20 June 2007|work=The Guardian |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/tonyblair/story/0,,2107523,00.html | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, Blair announced a new plan for peace and for Palestinian rights, based heavily on the ideas of the [[Peace Valley plan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article3927184.ece Israel may ease grip in Tony Blair deal to revive West Bank], The Times, 14 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

During the first nine days of the [[2008–2009 Israel-Gaza conflict]], Blair was allegedly spotted at the opening of the [[Armani]] store at [[Knightsbridge]]. Aides said he had been in phone contact with other world leaders since the fighting began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Matthew Kalman |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1105250/As-Gaza-torn-apart-war-Middle-East-peace-envoy-Tony-Blair-Hes-HOLIDAY.html |title=As Gaza is torn apart by war, where is Middle East peace envoy Tony Blair?

===Private sector===
In January 2008, it was confirmed that Blair would be joining investment bank [[JPMorgan Chase]] in a &quot;senior advisory capacity&quot;&lt;ref name=JPMC&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7180306.stm|title=Tony Blair joins investment bank|publisher=BBC News |date=10 January 2008|accessdate=10 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he would advise [[Zurich Financial Services]] on [[climate change]]. Some sources have claimed that his role at JP Morgan will pay more than $1m a year.&lt;ref name=JPMC/&gt; This additional salary will contribute to annual earnings of over £7m.&lt;ref&gt;Hencke, David [http://politics.guardian.co.uk/tonyblair/story/0,,2248529,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=networkfront Insurance job takes Blair's earnings above £7m], [[The Guardian]], 29 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tony Blair Associates===

Blair has established ''[[Tony Blair Associates]]''. This firm will &quot;allow him to provide, in partnership with others, strategic advice on a commercial and ''pro bono'' [free] basis, on political and economic trends and governmental reform.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/article5780937.ece Tony Blair Inc: a nice little earner] The Sunday Times, 22 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, Blair has been the subject of criticism for apparent conflicts of interest that allow the former prime minister, now a Middle East peace envoy, to earn large sums of money, both directly and through Tony Blair Associates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/tony-blair/8787053/Tony-Blairs-Byzantine-world-of-advisers-and-lucrative-deals.html Tony Blair's Byzantine world of advisers and lucrative deals] The Daily Telegraph, 24 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/tony-blair/8784596/On-the-desert-trail-of-Tony-Blairs-millions.html On the desert trail of Tony Blair's millions] The Daily Telegraph, 24 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, Blair negotiated a new advisory contract with Kazakhstan that will increase the total fee for working with the regime to £16m. Critics have accused him of &quot;whitewashing&quot; the image and human rights record of a dictatorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1= Kerbaj |first1= Richard |last2= Ungoed-Thomas |first2= Jon |last3= Fortson |first3= Danny |date= 23 September 2012 |title= Blair in £16m deal with Kazakhs |url= http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/People/article1132117.ece |newspaper= [[The Sunday Times]] |accessdate= 24 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the Quartet===
[[Nabil Shaath]], a senior Abbas associate, said that Blair was acting as Israel's &quot;defence attorney&quot; in face of Abbas' application for a [[International recognition of the State of Palestine|Palestinian state]] to be admitted as a full member of the United Nations. According to a recent episode of the investigative documentary series [[Dispatches (TV series)|''Dispatches,'']] on the UK's [[Channel 4]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/programmes/dispatches/episode-guide/series-102/episode-1 The Wonderful World of Tony Blair]&lt;/ref&gt; Blair has used his [[Quartet on the Middle East|Quartet]] role to gain introductions and proximity to Arab leaders, with whom he then signed private consulting contracts for Tony Blair Associates. He obtained one such contract, worth $40m from the [[Emir of Kuwait]], to advise on reforms, and another from the rulers of the [[United Arab Emirates]]. Blair was instrumental in lobbying Israel to release frequencies in November 2009 for mobile phone company [[Wataniya]] to operate in the [[occupied West Bank]]. Wataniya is owned by the Qatari telecoms giant [[Q-Tel]] which bought Wataniya in 2007 with a $2 billions, loan arranged by the bank [[JP Morgan]], according to ''Dispatches''. Blair also works for JP Morgan, which pays him over $2m a year for providing &quot;strategic&quot; advice. JP Morgan stood to make &quot;substantial profits&quot; if the deal went through, the British documentary said. Israel had tied approval of Wataniya's frequencies to the [[Palestinian National Authority|PA]] dropping efforts to pursue the [[Goldstone report]] on Israeli [[United Nations Fact Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict|war crimes in Gaza]], through the UN. Blair also brokered another major deal with Israel for [[British Gas plc|British Gas]] to secure contracts to exploit natural gas fields worth up to $6 billions, in the [[territorial waters]] of the Gaza Strip. Blair negotiated the deal directly with Israeli Prime Minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]. In 2007, the United Nations Programme of Assistance to the Palestinian People spent over $400,000 on three [[Armored car (VIP)|armoured cars]] for Blair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/10/201110375817236134.html Why the UN must abolish the 'Quartet'.] By [[Ali Abunimah]].

===European Council president speculation===
In 2009, there was speculation in the media that Blair was open to the idea of becoming the first President of the [[European Council]], a post created in the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] that would come into force in 2009, if successfully ratified. Gordon Brown added his support, but noted that it was premature to discuss candidates before the treaty was approved. A spokesman for Blair did not rule out him accepting the post, but said that he was concentrating on his current role in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Grice|first=Andrew|title=Blair emerges as candidate for 'President of Europe'|work=The Independent |location=UK |date=20 October 2007|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article3078889.ece|accessdate=21 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blair was later invited to speak on European issues at a rally of [[President Sarkozy]]'s party, the [[Union for a Popular Movement]], on 12 January 2008, which fuelled speculation further.&lt;ref&gt;AFP (2007).

There was opposition to Blair's candidacy for the job. In the UK, the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Liberal Democrats]] both said they would oppose Blair. In Germany, the leader of the [[Free Democratic Party (Germany)|Free Democrats]], [[Guido Westerwelle]], said that he preferred a candidate from a smaller European country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Blair | first=Tony | title=German party cool on Blair for EU | date=28 October 2009 | publisher=BBC World Service News | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8329554.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister of Luxembourg, [[Jean-Claude Juncker]] emerged as a rival to Blair's candidacy and had the backing for many of the smaller European member states.

===Charity===
On 14 November 2007, Blair launched the Tony Blair Sports Foundation, which aims to &quot;increase childhood participation in sports activities, especially in the North East of England, where a larger proportion of children are socially excluded, and to promote overall health and prevent childhood obesity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tonyblairsportsfoundation.org/ |title=Tony Blair Sports Foundation |publisher=Tony Blair Sports Foundation |accessdate=20 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 May 2008, Blair launched the [[Tony Blair Faith Foundation]] as a vehicle for encouraging different faiths to join together in promoting respect and understanding, as well as working to tackle poverty. Reflecting Blair's own faith but not dedicated to any particular religion, the Foundation aims to &quot;show how faith is a powerful force for good in the modern world&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tonyblairfaithfoundation.org/about-us/mission-statement.html &quot;Mission statement&quot;]{{dead link|date=February 2012}}, Tony Blair Faith Foundation, 30 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Foundation will use its profile and resources to encourage people of faith to work together more closely to tackle global poverty and conflict,&quot; says its mission statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/the-god-blog/2009/09/faith-foundation-blair-speech|title=Tony Blair's Faith Foundation speech|work=The New Statesman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accusations of war crimes===
Since the Iraq War, Blair has been the subject of accusations of [[war crime]]s. Critics of his actions, including [[Desmond Tutu]],&lt;ref name=observer2012-09-02&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2012/sep/02/tony-blair-iraq-war-desmond-tutu|title=Tony Blair should face trial over Iraq war, says Desmond Tutu|author=Toby Helm|publisher=The Observer|date=2 September 2012|accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Harold Pinter]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2005/dec/07/iraq.booksnews|title=Pinter demands war crimes trial for Blair|date=7 December 2005|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Arundhati Roy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/Iraq/Writer-says-Bush-Blair-war-criminals/2004/11/03/1099362221091.html|title=Writer says Bush, Blair war criminals|date=3 November 2004|publisher=The Age|accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; have called for his trial at the [[International Criminal Court]].

In 2007, the scenario of a possible war crimes trial for the former British Prime Minister was satirized by the British broadcaster [[Channel 4]], in a &quot;mockumentary&quot;, ''[[The Trial of Tony Blair]]'', with concluded with the fictional Blair being dispatched to the Hague.&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117933909?refCatId=32|title=The Trial of Tony Blair|publisher=Variety|date=14 June 2007|accessdate=3 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2011, a mock war-crimes tribunal put together by the [[Kuala Lumpur War Crimes Commission]] reached a unanimous conclusion that Tony Blair and George W. Bush are guilty of crimes against peace, crimes against humanity, and genocide as a result of their roles in the 2003 Iraq War. The mock trial, which lasted 4 days, consisting of 5 judges of judicial and academic backgrounds, a court-appointed defence team in lieu of the defendants or representatives, and a prosecution team including international law professor [[Francis Boyle]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/11/20111128105712109215.html Kuala Lumpur tribunal: Bush and Blair guilty] - Richard Falk, ''Al Jazeera''&lt;/ref&gt; The mock tribunal's finding received mixed responses, being labelled a &quot;circus&quot; by former UN Special Rapporteur [[Param Cumaraswamy]], and supported as &quot;necessary work&quot; by former US Congresswoman [[Cynthia McKinney]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=36581 Mahathir's War Crimes Court to Name and Shame] ''IPS News''&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2007, before his resignation, it was reported that Blair would be offered a knighthood in the [[Order of the Thistle]], owing to his Scottish connections (rather than the [[Order of the Garter]], which is usually offered to former Prime Ministers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2007/05/13/dp1301.xml#head1 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080121050131/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/opinion/main.jhtml?xml=/opinion/2007/05/13/dp1301.xml#head1 |archivedate=21 January 2008 |title=Queen makes Blair an offer that he can refuse  |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=13 May 2007 |accessdate=22 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; No such move has been made since, and Blair has reportedly indicated that he does not want the traditional knighthood or peerage bestowed on former prime ministers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/politics/1574027/Tony-Blair-spurns-honour-system.html |title=Tony Blair spurns honour system |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=30 December 2007 |accessdate=1 September 2010  | first=Melissa | last=Kite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 September 2010, Blair was awarded the [[Liberty Medal]] at the [[National Constitution Center]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. It was presented by former President Bill Clinton, and is awarded annually to men and women of courage and conviction who strive to secure the blessings of liberty to people around the globe.

Because Blair is credited as being instrumental in ending the conflict in [[Kosovo]], boys born in that country following the war have been given the name Toni or [[Tonibler]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/10576544 |title=Namesakes welcome Tony Blair during Kosovo visit |publisher=BBC |work=BBC News |date=9 July 2010 |accessdate=4 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
