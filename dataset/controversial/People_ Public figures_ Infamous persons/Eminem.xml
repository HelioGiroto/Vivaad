Eminem quickly gained popularity in 1999 with his major-label debut album, ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]''. That first album, ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'' and his third major album, ''[[The Eminem Show]]'', all won Grammy Awards, making Eminem the first artist to win [[Best Rap Album]] for three consecutive LPs. ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' is also considered one of Eminem's best and most successful albums. Eminem then went on hiatus after touring in 2005. He released his first album since 2004's ''[[Encore (Eminem album)|Encore]]'', titled ''[[Relapse (Eminem album)|Relapse]]'', on May 15, 2009. In 2010, Eminem released his seventh studio album ''[[Recovery (Eminem album)|Recovery]]'', which was an international success. ''Recovery'' was also named the best selling album worldwide of 2010 joining ''The Eminem Show'', which was the best seller of 2002.

==Life and career==

===1972–91: Early life and beginnings===
Eminem was born Marshall Bruce Mathers III on October 17, 1972, in [[Saint Joseph, Missouri]], the only child of Deborah R. (Nelson) Mathers-Briggs and Marshall Bruce Mathers, Jr.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox News&quot;/&gt; He is of Scottish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Silverman |first=Stephen M. |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,622481,00.html |title=Eminem's Scotland Concert Skirmish |work=People  |date=August 27, 2001 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; English, [[Germans|German]], [[Swiss people|Swiss]], [[Poles|Polish]], and [[Luxembourgers|Luxembourgian]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/mathers.html |title=Ancestry of Eminem |publisher=Wargs.com |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father abandoned the family when he was 18 months old, and he was raised solely by his mother. By the age of 12, Mathers and his mother had moved between various cities and towns in Missouri (including Saint Joseph, [[Savannah, Missouri|Savannah]], and [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=3:19&amp;nbsp;pm ET |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/27578186/ |title=Eminem's mom gives her side of the story today.msnbc.com – November 6, 2008 |publisher=Today.msnbc.msn.com |date=November 6, 2008 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; before they settled in [[Warren, Michigan]], and in Mathers' teenage years, Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7bCBYl1V2xAC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=dresden+michigan+eminem&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3TNVvqN5YE&amp;sig=lGVEYC2qRZXUhMNKWPYILyCPibk&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=XvE0Tpq8C-P40gHk44SJDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=dresden%20michigan%20eminem&amp;f=false |title=Happy days |publisher=Spin |date= August 2010|accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a child, Mathers developed an interest in storytelling and aspired to become a [[Comic book creator|comic book artist]] before discovering hip hop.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noshame?&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/may/14/entertainment/ca-29770|title=Has He No Shame?|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|work=The Los Angeles Times|publisher=Tribune Company|date=May 14, 2000|accessdate=2012-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Mathers was around 11 years old, his maternal uncle Ronald &quot;Ronnie&quot; Nelson introduced him to the genre after giving him a copy of [[Ice-T]]'s single &quot;Reckless&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Noshame?&quot;/&gt;  After obtaining a copy of the [[Beastie Boys]] album ''[[Licensed to Ill]]'' as a teenager, Mathers became interested in music, performing amateur raps at age 14 under the pseudonym &quot;M&amp;M&quot; and joining the group called &quot;[[Bassmint Productions]]&quot; and released their second [[extended play|EP]], ''[[Steppin' onto the Scene]]''. They later changed their name to &quot;Soul Intent&quot; and around 1995 they released their first single called &quot;Fuckin' Backstabber&quot; under the record label Mashin' Duck Records.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicbio&quot;/&gt; Although he was enrolled at [[Lincoln High School (Warren, Michigan)|Lincoln High School]] in Warren, he frequently participated in [[battle rap|freestyle battles]] at the now-defunct Osborn High School on Detroit's east side.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozza|2003|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite a well-documented struggle succeeding in a predominantly black industry, he gained the approval of [[underground hip hop]] audiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicbio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox News&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;60 mins Eminem&quot;&gt;CBSNewsOnline (October 10, 2010).

YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt; After repeating the ninth grade twice due to [[truancy]] and near-failing grades,&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;/&gt; he dropped out of high school at age 17.

In 1991, Mathers was devastated by the suicide of his uncle.  He has a tattoo reading &quot;Ronnie R.I.P.&quot; on his upper left arm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freewebs.com/slim_shady_world/other.htm#20752441 |title=Slim Shady World :: Last updated on February 7, 2005 |publisher=Freewebs.com |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ronnie was mentioned in the songs &quot;[[Stan (song)|Stan]],&quot; &quot;[[Cleanin' Out My Closet]],&quot; and &quot;My Dad's Gone Crazy&quot;.

===1992–99: Early career, ''Infinite'', and ''The Slim Shady LP''===

One of Mathers' early mentors as a rapper was local rapper [[Champtown]], who got Mathers his first studio time; Mathers made his first music video appearance in Champtown's 1992 video &quot;Do-Da-Dipity&quot;.&lt;ref name=briansmith&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith |first=Brian |url=http://www2.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=7099 |title=Music: Champ's town |publisher=Metro Times |accessdate=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mathers and Champtown later had a falling out.&lt;ref name=briansmith/&gt; Mathers was initially signed to FBT Productions in 1992, run by brothers Jeff and Mark Bass. Mathers also held a minimum-wage job of cooking and dishwashing at the restaurant Gilbert's Lodge at [[St. Clair Shores, Michigan|St. Clair Shores]] for some time.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozza|2003|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, his debut album ''[[Infinite (Eminem album)|Infinite]]'', which was recorded at the Bassmint, a recording studio owned by the [[Bass Brothers]], was released under their independent label [[Web Entertainment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozza|2003|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eminem recalled, &quot;Obviously, I was young and influenced by other artists, and I got a lot of feedback saying that I sounded like [[Nas]] and [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]]. 'Infinite' was me trying to figure out how I wanted my rap style to be, how I wanted to sound on the mic and present myself. It was a growing stage. I felt like 'Infinite' was like a demo that just got pressed up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.eminem.com/bio/bio.aspx|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080213185359/http://www.eminem.com/bio/bio.aspx|archivedate=2008-02-13|title=Eminem biography|work=Eminem.com|publisher=Interscope Records}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subjects covered in ''Infinite'' included his struggles with raising his newborn daughter Hailie Jade Mathers while on limited funds and his strong desire to get rich.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozza|2003|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in his career, Eminem collaborated with fellow Detroit MC [[Royce da 5'9&quot;]] under the stage name [[Bad Meets Evil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anziri|first=Jon|title=Royce da 5'9 – Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p469895|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|year=2002|accessdate=2008-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the release of ''Infinite'', Eminem's personal struggles and abuse of drugs and alcohol culminated in an unsuccessful suicide attempt.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicbio&quot;/&gt;

[[Jimmy Iovine]], CEO of [[Interscope Records]], requested a demo tape of Eminem's after he placed second at the 1997 [[Rap Olympics]]. Eminem had also won Wake Up Show's &quot;Freestyle Performer of the Year&quot; award, helping him acquire a record deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzle.com/editorials/4-28-2005-69211.asp |title=Eminem Biography |publisher=Buzzle.com |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iovine played the tape for record producer [[Dr. Dre]], founder of [[Aftermath Entertainment]]. The two began recording tracks for Eminem's upcoming major-label debut ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]'', and Eminem made a guest performance on the album ''[[Devil Without a Cause]]'' by [[Kid Rock]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicbio&quot;/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=November 2011}} Hip-hop magazine ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' featured Eminem in its &quot;Unsigned Hype&quot; column in March 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bozza 81&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bozza|2003|p=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Slim Shady EP'' was a debut [[extended play]] by Eminem, published by [[Web Entertainment]] in 1997. ''The Slim Shady EP'' was released on [[Compact Cassette|cassette]], [[Gramophone record|vinyl]], and CD. The vinyl and CD versions were released in 1998. Eminem first introduced his &quot;Slim Shady&quot; persona on this EP, and his lyrics are a marked departure from those found on ''[[Infinite (Eminem album)|Infinite]]'', featuring constant references to drug use, sexual acts, mental instability, and over-the-top violence. Another departure was his exploration of more serious themes of dealing with poverty, his direct and self-deprecating response to criticism, and of marital and family difficulties. His flow is also noticeably different than on ''Infinite''; whereas critics claimed he sounded too much like [[Nas]] and [[AZ (rapper)|AZ]] on that album. Eminem also began utilizing story telling on this EP. The production value of the music on the tracks&amp;nbsp;— from previous collaborators [[DJ Head]], The [[Bass Brothers]], and [[Mr. Porter]]&amp;nbsp;— was also noticeably higher than on prior album efforts. According to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', at this point in his life Eminem had &quot;realized his musical ambitions were the only way to escape his unhappy life&quot;.

After being signed to [[Aftermath Entertainment]]/[[Interscope Records]] in 1998, Eminem released his first major studio album, ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]'', heavily based on the production by [[Dr. Dre]], one year later in 1999. ''Billboard'' praised the album as &quot;light years ahead of the material he had been writing beforehand&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;billbard&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/bio/index.jsp?pid=315925|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080418142233/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/bio/index.jsp?pid=315925|archivedate=2008-04-18|title=Eminem|work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; It went on to be one of the most popular albums of 1999, going [[RIAA certification|triple platinum]] by the end of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;rotn&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.rockonthenet.com/artists-e/eminem_main.htm|title=Timeline|publisher=Rock on the Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the album's popularity came controversy surrounding many of the album's lyrics. In &quot;'97 Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, he describes a trip with his infant daughter, disposing of his wife's body. Another song, &quot;[[Guilty Conscience]]&quot;, ends with his encouraging a man to murder his wife and her lover. &quot;Guilty Conscience&quot; marked the beginning of the friendship and musical bond that Dr. Dre and Eminem would share. The two label-mates would later collaborate on a line of hit songs, including &quot;[[Forgot About Dre]]&quot; and &quot;What's the Difference&quot; from Dr. Dre's album ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]]'', &quot;[[Bitch Please II]]&quot; from ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'', &quot;Say What You Say&quot; from ''[[The Eminem Show]]'', &quot;[[Encore/Curtains Down]]&quot; from ''[[Encore (Eminem album)|Encore]]'' and &quot;[[Old Time's Sake]]&quot; and &quot;[[Crack a Bottle]]&quot; from ''[[Relapse (Eminem album)|Relapse]]''. Dr. Dre would go on to make at least one guest appearance on all of Eminem's studio albums under the label [[Aftermath Entertainment|Aftermath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/01/16/Artsandentertainment/Eminem_and_his_ex_wif.shtml|title=Eminem and his ex-wife remarry |publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album has now been certified 4× platinum by the RIAA. With the release of it, Eminem was accused of imitating the style and subject matter of underground rapper [[Cage (rapper)|Cage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Neil|last=Drumming|title=Smut Peddlers: Split-Level Raunch |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-417506.html |work=Washington Post|date=February 14, 2001 |accessdate=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-11923595_ITM |first=Matt |last=Dearborn |coauthors=Duke |title=Interview: His name is not Slim Shady |publisher=University Wire|date=December 1, 2005|accessdate=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000–02: ''The Marshall Mathers LP'' and ''The Eminem Show''===
''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'' was released in May 2000. It went on to sell 1.76&amp;nbsp;million copies in its first week, breaking the records set by [[Snoop Dogg]]'s ''[[Doggystyle]]'' as the fastest-selling hip hop album and [[Britney Spears]]' ''[[...Baby One More Time]]'' as the fastest-selling solo album in United States history.&lt;ref name=&quot;MMLP&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;criminal&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1271224.stm Eminem's criminal record]&quot;, ''BBC News'', April 11, 2001.

Eminem's third major album, ''[[The Eminem Show]]'', was released in summer 2002 and proved to be another hit for the rapper reaching number one on the charts and selling well over 1 million copies in its first week of release.&lt;ref name=&quot;rotn&quot;/&gt; It featured the single &quot;[[Without Me]]&quot;, in which he makes derogatory comments about [[boy band]]s, [[Limp Bizkit]], [[Dick Cheney]] and [[Lynne Cheney]], and [[Moby]], among others. ''The Eminem Show'' has been certified 10× Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA). The album reflected on the impact of his rise to fame, his relationship with his wife and daughter, and his status in the hip-hop community. He also addresses the charges he faced over assaulting a [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] he saw kissing his wife in 2000. [[Stephen Thomas Erlewine]] of [[Allmusic]] felt that while there was clear anger present on several tracks, this album was considerably less inflammatory than ''The Marshall Mathers LP''.&lt;ref name=&quot;eminem show&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=&quot;The Eminem Show&quot; – Overview|url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=Aiypzefrk2gf6|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071201143458/http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=Aiypzefrk2gf6|archivedate=2007-12-01|publisher=Allmusic|year=2002|accessdate=2008-02-01}} {{Dead link|date=January 2011|bot=CactusBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[L.

In 2004, Eminem released his fourth major album, [[Encore (Eminem album)|''Encore'']]. The album was another chart-topper, as it was driven by the single &quot;[[Just Lose It]]&quot;, notable for being disrespectful towards [[Michael Jackson]]. On October 12, 2004, a week after the release of &quot;[[Just Lose It]]&quot;, Eminem's first single from ''Encore'', [[Michael Jackson]] called into the Los Angeles-based [[Steve Harvey]] radio show to report his displeasure with the video, which parodies Jackson's [[child molestation]] trial, [[plastic surgery]], and an incident in which Jackson's hair caught on fire while filming a [[Pepsi]] commercial in 1984. The lyrics to &quot;Just Lose It&quot; refer to Jackson's legal troubles, however he does state in his song &quot;... and that's not a stab at Michael/That's just a metaphor/I'm just psycho....&quot; Many of Jackson's supporters and friends spoke out about the video, including [[Stevie Wonder]], who called the video &quot;kicking a man while he's down&quot; and &quot;bullshit&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;MJ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=3825|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080125055428/http://www.allhiphop.com/hiphopnews/?ID=3825|archivedate=2008-01-25|title=Stevie Wonder has words to say about Eminem|publisher=AllHipHop}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Steve Harvey]], who declared, &quot;Eminem has lost his ghetto pass.

In 2005, some industry insiders speculated that Eminem was considering ending his rapping career after six years and several multi-platinum albums. Speculation began in early 2005 about a double-disc album to be released late that year, rumored to be titled ''The Funeral''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.1strowseats.com/blog/category/eminem/the_funeral_new_eminem_album_6831.asp|title=The Funeral – New Eminem Album|publisher=1st Row Seats}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album later manifested itself as a [[greatest hits album]] under the name ''[[Curtain Call: The Hits]]'' in December. In July 2005, the ''Detroit Free Press'' broke news of a potential final bow for Eminem as a solo performer, quoting members of his inside circle who said that he would begin to fully embrace the role of producer and label executive. On the same day of the release of the compilation album, Eminem denied that he was retiring on Detroit-based WKQI's &quot;Mojo in the Morning&quot; radio show, but implied that he would at least be taking a break as an artist, saying &quot;I'm at a point in my life right now where I feel like I don't know where my career is going ...

Three days later, Eminem stated it was a staged act that they had planned together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Strause |first=Jackie |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/entertainment/tv/item_4DJHy5FZ42Hz8c4KIauPIL;jsessionid=C0AFE8F93A5B8D2B0D17CB4532B01274 |title=Eminem stunt faked |work=New York Post |date=June 2, 2009 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 30, Eminem performed at the [[Voodoo Music Experience]] in New Orleans as a headliner in his first full performance in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaufman |first=Gil |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1625294/20091102/eminem.jhtml |title=– Eminem Rocks New Orleans' Voodoo Fest With First Full Concert of 2009 |work=MTV |date=November 2, 2009 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performance included several songs from ''Relapse'', as well as many of Eminem's older hits and an appearance by D12. On November 19, Eminem announced on his website that ''Relapse: Refill'' would be released on December 21. The album was a re-release of the ''Relapse'' album with seven bonus tracks, including &quot;[[Forever (Drake song)|Forever]]&quot; and &quot;Taking My Ball&quot;. In a statement he described the forthcoming CD:

&quot;I want to deliver more material for the fans this year like I originally planned ... Hopefully these tracks on ''The Refill'' will tide the fans over until we put out ''Relapse 2'' next year ... I got back in with Dre and then a few more producers, including Just Blaze, and went in a completely different direction which made me start from scratch. The new tracks started to sound very different than the tracks I originally intended to be on ''Relapse 2'', but I still want the other stuff to be heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/eminem/48492|title=Eminem announces 'Relapse: Refill' album featuring five unreleased songs|work=NME |publisher=[[IPC Media]]|date=20 November 2009|accessdate=2011-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;

On April 14, 2010, Eminem [[twitter|tweeted]], &quot;There is no Relapse 2&quot;, to his followers. This caused people to believe that he was not releasing an album at all, but it simply meant that the album title would be changed to ''[[Recovery (Eminem album)|Recovery]]''. He confirmed this by tweeting, &quot;RECOVERY&quot;, with a link to his website. Eminem said, &quot;I had originally planned for ''Relapse 2'' to come out last year. But as I kept recording and working with new producers, the idea of a sequel to ''Relapse'' started to make less and less sense to me, and I wanted to make a completely new album. The music on ''Recovery'' came out very different from ''Relapse'', and I think it deserves its own title.&quot; His seventh studio album, ''Recovery'', was released on June 18.&lt;ref name=&quot;recovery&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rapradar.com/2010/04/14/eminem-speaks-on-new-album-recovery |title=Eminem Speaks On New Album Recovery |publisher=Rap Radar |date=April 14, 2010 |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, ''Recovery'' sold 741,000 in its first week to land atop the ''Billboard'' 200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1642712/20100630/eminem.jhtml|title=Eminem Notches Year's Highest Debut With Recovery|first=Gil|last=Kaufman|publisher=MTV|date=June 30, 2010|accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/#/news/eminem-s-recovery-explodes-at-no-1-on-billboard-1004101415.story|title=Eminem's 'Recovery' Explodes At No. 1 on Billboard 200 With 741,000|first=Keith|last=Caulfield|work=Billboard|date=June 30, 2010|accessdate=2010-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became Eminem's sixth consecutive number-one album in the US and achieved international commercial success, charting at number one in several other countries.

===Shady Records and D12===

As Eminem succeeded in multi-platinum record sales, Interscope granted him his own record label. He and his manager [[Paul Rosenberg (music manager)|Paul Rosenberg]] created [[Shady Records]] in late 1999. He followed this by signing his own Detroit collective D12 and rapper [[Obie Trice]] to the label. In 2002, Eminem signed 50 Cent through a joint venture between Shady and Dr. Dre's Aftermath label. In 2003, Eminem and Dr. Dre signed [[Atlanta]] rapper [[Stat Quo]] to the Shady/Aftermath roster. [[DJ Green Lantern]], the former DJ for Eminem, was signed to Shady Records until a dispute related to the 50 Cent and Jadakiss feud forced him to depart from the label; he is no longer associated with Eminem. [[The Alchemist (producer)|The Alchemist]] is now officially Eminem's tour DJ. In 2005, Eminem signed another Atlanta rapper, Bobby Creekwater, to his label along with West Coast rapper [[Cashis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9438449/Eminem|title=Eminem |publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was meant to help launch the new artists under the roster, like Stat Quo, Cashis and Bobby Creekwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://stores.musictoday.com/store/dept.asp?band_id=82&amp;dept_id=1305&amp;sfid=2|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080411222742/http://stores.musictoday.com/store/dept.asp?band_id=82&amp;dept_id=1305&amp;sfid=2|archivedate=2008-04-11|title= Re-Up CD|publisher=Encore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the time of recording ''Infinite'', Eminem and rappers Proof and Kon Artis gathered the group of rappers now collectively in the group D12, short for &quot;Detroit Twelve&quot; or &quot;Dirty Dozen&quot;, performing in the manner of the multi-man group [[Wu-Tang Clan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozza|2003|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Eminem brought his rap group, D12, to the popular music scene, and the group's debut album ''[[Devil's Night (album)|Devil's Night]]'' came out that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;d12 all music&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Kerry|title=D12 &gt; Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p457773|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|month=May| year=2006|accessdate=2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first single released off of the album was &quot;[[Shit on You]]&quot;, followed by &quot;[[Purple Pills]]&quot;, an ode to [[recreational drug use]]. For radio and television, the censored version was heavily rewritten to remove many of the song's references to drugs and sex and was renamed &quot;Purple Hills&quot;. While that single was a hit, the album's second single, &quot;[[Fight Music]]&quot;, was not as successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenison|first=David|date=June 27, 2001|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b41818_music_fans_possessed_by_devil.html|title=Music Fans Possessed by &quot;Devil&quot; |publisher=[[E!]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After their debut, D12 took a three-year break from the studio, later regrouping to release their second album, ''[[D12 World]]'', in 2004, which featured the popular hit single release &quot;[[My Band]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;d12 all music&quot;/&gt; In April 2006, D12 member (and Eminem's childhood friend) [[Proof (rapper)|Deshaun &quot;Proof&quot; Holton]] was killed in a club brawl on [[8 Mile Road]] in Detroit, Michigan, with US military veteran Keith Bender, Jr., who also died in the fray. The eruption is suspected to have been due to an argument over a game of pool. Proof was then allegedly shot by the bouncer Mario Etheridge, Bender's cousin. He was taken by private vehicle to St. John Health's Conner Creek Campus, an outpatient emergency treatment site, but pronounced dead on arrival. Eminem and former Detroit [[Shady Records]] artist [[Obie Trice]] spoke at the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1528973/20060419/proof_of_d_12.jhtml?headlines=true|title=Eminem, Obie Trice Speak At Packed Funeral For Proof |publisher=[[MTV News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; D12 member [[Bizarre (rapper)|Bizarre]] said that Eminem is not featured on his new album ''[[Blue Cheese &amp; Coney Island]]'' because &quot;he's busy doing his thing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.xxlmag.com/online/?p=15387|title=Bizarre: Split Personality|work=[[XXL (magazine)|XXL]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; D12 released a mixtape in 2011 titled ''Return of the Dozen Volume 2'' only featuring Eminem on one song, &quot;Fame&quot; unlike the group's previous mixtape ''Return of the Dozen'' where Eminem is not on any tracks.

===Acting career===
Although he had a small part in the 2001 film, ''[[The Wash (film)|The Wash]]'', Eminem made his official Hollywood acting debut with the semi-autobiographical ''[[8 Mile (film)|8 Mile]]'', released in November 2002. He has said the movie is not an account of his life, but a representation of growing up in Detroit. He recorded several new songs for the soundtrack, including &quot;[[Lose Yourself]],&quot; which won an Academy Award for [[Academy Award for Best Song|Best Original Song]] in 2003. &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; would go on to become the longest running No. 1 [[hip hop music|hip hop]] single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefalaja.com/worldrecords1.html |title=Lefalaja.com |publisher=Lefalaja.com |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the song was not performed at the ceremony, due to Eminem's absence at the ceremony. His collaborator, [[Luis Resto (musician)|Luis Resto]], who co-wrote the song, accepted the award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2008-08-08|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,625790,00.html|last=Elson|first=Rachel F.|title=Eminem Naps Through His Oscar Victory |work=[[People (magazine)|People]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eminem has participated in various voice acting roles. Some of these include the video game ''[[50 Cent: Bulletproof]]'', where he voices an aging corrupt police officer who speaks in [[African American Vernacular English|Ebonics]] and guest spots on the [[Comedy Central]] television show ''[[Crank Yankers]]'', and a web cartoon called ''[[The Slim Shady Show]]'', which has since been pulled off-line and is instead sold on DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.xboxsolution.com/2005/05/19/vu-games-eminem-and-dr-dre-debut-50-cent-bulletproof/|title=VU Games, Eminem, and Dr. Dre debut 50 Cent: Bulletproof |publisher=Xbox Solution|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070115014559/http://www.xboxsolution.com/2005/05/19/vu-games-eminem-and-dr-dre-debut-50-cent-bulletproof/ |archivedate =2007-01-15|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; He will be involved in either the soundtrack or scoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://news.usti.net/home/news/cn/?/living.tv/1/wed/bd/Uus-eminem.R_Ti_GuD.html|title= Eminem To Star In 'Have Gun, Will Travel' |publisher=ustinet news}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also in the running for the part of David Rice in 2008's film ''[[Jumper (film)|Jumper]]'' after [[Tom Sturridge]] was dropped just two weeks before filming. Concerns over not having a more prominent actor prompted the director, [[Doug Liman]], to consider other actors for the role. He eventually selected [[Hayden Christensen]] over Eminem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1581622/story.jhtml|title=Eminem Almost Had Hayden Christensen's Role In 'Jumper'|publisher=MTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also had a cameo appearance in the 2009 movie ''[[Funny People]]'', in which he is involved in an argument with [[Ray Romano]].

===Memoirs===
On October 21, 2008, Eminem released a tell-all autobiography entitled ''[[The Way I Am (book)|The Way I Am]]'', which details his struggles with poverty, drugs, fame, heartbreak and depression, along with stories about his rise to fame and commentary on past controversies. This book also contains some of the original lyric sheets from songs such as &quot;[[Stan (song)|Stan]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Real Slim Shady]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Eminem-memoir-release-27483.aspx Eminem, All Grown Up?

Eminem's mother, Debbie Nelson, also released an autobiography entitled ''[[My Son Marshall, My Son Eminem]]'', which explains Nelson's life growing up, meeting Marshall Bruce Mathers, Jr. (Eminem's father) and Eminem's rise to, and struggle with, fame.

===Advertising===
Eminem was featured in two commercials that aired during [[Super Bowl XLV]]. The first, for [[Lipton]]'s [[Brisk Iced Tea]], was a one-minute spot that featured him as a [[claymation]] figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Eminem to Star in Super Bowl Claymation Ad: Report|url=http://www.billboard.com/news/eminem-to-star-in-super-bowl-claymation-1005016312.story#/news/eminem-to-star-in-super-bowl-claymation-1005016312.story|date=January 31, 2011|work=Billboard |author=Monica Herrera}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other was a two-minute ad, at that time the longest in Super Bowl history, for the [[Chrysler]] [[Chrysler 200|200]]. It featured Eminem driving through Detroit and ended with him taking the stage at the [[Fox Theatre (Detroit, Michigan)|Fox Theatre]] with &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; playing as the soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1657401/eminem-chrysler-super-bowl-commercial.jhtml |title=Eminem Praised For Chrysler Super Bowl Commercial |first=Gil |last=Kaufmann |publisher=MTV |date=February 7, 2011 |accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thecelebritycafe.com/feature/eminem-s-chrysler-commercial-hailed-one-top-super-bowl-ads-2011-02-07-2011 |title=Eminem’s Chrysler Commercial Hailed as One of Top Super Bowl Ads of 2011 |work=TheCelebrityCafe.com |date=February 7, 2011 |accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity===
Eminem has also founded his own charity named The Marshall Mathers Foundation, assisting disadvantaged youth.  The foundation frequently works in conjunction with a charity founded by Norman Yatooma, a high profile Detroit attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.looktothestars.org/charity/268-marshall-mathers-foundation|title=Marshall Mathers Foundation: Celebrity Supporters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistry==

===Influences and rapping technique===
Eminem has named several MCs who influenced his [[rapping]] style.  First and foremost is his mentor, [[Dr. Dre]], whose thick, muscular, terror- and paranoia-evoking loops have seen reincarnations in the work of Eminem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pandora.com/music/artist/5eee6422e9312647 |title=Eminem – Pandora Internet Radio |publisher=Pandora.com |accessdate=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other influences have included [[Esham]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hess |first1=Mickey |title=Hip Hop in America: A Regional Guide: Volume 1: East Coast and West Coast |year=2009 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |isbn=0-313-34323-3 |pages=411–413 |chapter=Esham }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kool G Rap]],&lt;ref name=Edwards88&gt;Edwards, 2009, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Masta Ace]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Eminem 2008, p. 20&quot;&gt;Eminem, with Sacha Jenkins, 2008, ''The Way I Am'', Dutton Adult, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Big Daddy Kane]],&lt;ref name=Edwards88/&gt; [[Newcleus]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Eminem 2008, p. 20&quot;/&gt; [[Ice-T]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Eminem 2008, p. 20&quot;/&gt; [[Mantronix]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Eminem 2008, p. 20&quot;/&gt; [[Melle Mel]] (specifically the track &quot;[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]&quot;),&lt;ref name=&quot;Eminem 2008, p. 20&quot;/&gt; [[LL Cool J]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Eminem 2008, p. 20&quot;/&gt; [[Beastie Boys]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Eminem 2008, p. 20&quot;/&gt; [[Run-DMC]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Eminem 2008, p. 20&quot;/&gt; [[Rakim]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Eminem 2008, p. 20&quot;/&gt; and [[Boogie Down Productions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Eminem 2008, p. 20&quot;/&gt;

In the book ''[[How to Rap]]'', [[Guerilla Black]] notes that Eminem studied other MCs to create his rapping technique: &quot;Eminem listened to everything and that's what made him one of the greats&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 2009, p. x.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same book, Eminem is praised for various aspects of his rapping technique by numerous other MCs; these techniques include his varied and humorous subject matter,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 2009, pp. 5, 38.&lt;/ref&gt; connecting with his audience,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 2009, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; carrying a concept over a series of albums,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 2009, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; complex rhyme schemes,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 2009, pp. 66, 107.&lt;/ref&gt; his ability to bend words so that they [[rhyme]],&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 2009, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; his use of [[multisyllabic rhymes]],&lt;ref name=Edwards88/&gt; fitting many rhymes in each bar,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 2009, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; complex rhythms,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 2009, pp. 120, 129.&lt;/ref&gt; clear [[enunciation]],&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 2009, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt; use of [[melody]],&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 2009, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[syncopation]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 2009, p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known to write the majority of his lyrics down on paper, as documented in his book ''[[The Way I Am (book)|The Way I Am]]'', as well as taking a few days or a week to craft lyrics,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 2009, p. 160.&lt;/ref&gt; being a &quot;[[workaholic]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 2009, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;[[doubletracking|stacking]]&quot; vocals.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, 2009, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alter egos===
Eminem uses alter egos in his songs to use different styles of rapping and subject matters. His most famous and popular alter ego, &quot;Slim Shady&quot;, originated from ''The Slim Shady EP''. While under this personality, Eminem makes violent and dark songs with a comical twist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2011-03-07|url=
http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1002562,00.html|title=The Three Faces of Eminem|work=TIME |first=Josh|last=Tyrangiel|date=June 3, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though his Slim Shady persona has remained, Eminem did not include it in ''Recovery'' as much because he did not feel it fit the theme.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|accessdate=2011-03-07|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1641819/eminem-slim-shady-wasnt-right-recovery.jhtml|title=Eminem Says 'Slim Shady' Wasn't Right for Recovery|publisher=MTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another character Eminem has portrayed is Ken Kaniff.  Ken was originally played by fellow Detroit rapper Aristotle in the Slim Shady LP, who appeared in a prank call skit towards Eminem. After the Slim Shady LP, an argument led to Eminem taking the character of Ken Kaniff and playing him in several skits starting in the ''Marshall Mathers LP'' and onwards (except for ''Encore'' and ''Recovery''). In his Ken Kaniff personality, Ken is a homosexual who pokes fun at Eminem's songs. Aristotle, the original creator of Ken Kaniff, became angry over Eminem taking his character and created a [[mixtape]] in which he raps in his Ken persona dissing Eminem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answerbag.com/q_view/595735 |title=Who is Ken Kaniff? Is he a real person? And why eminem is so upset with him? |publisher=Answerbag |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Featurings and productions===
{{See also|Eminem production discography|Eminem discography#Guest appearances}}

Although he typically collaborates with various rappers under [[Aftermath Entertainment]] and [[Shady Records]], such as [[Dr. Dre]], [[50 Cent]], [[D12]], and [[Obie Trice]], Eminem has collaborated with many other artists, including [[Redman (rapper)|Redman]], [[Kid Rock]], [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]], [[Missy Elliott]], [[Jay-Z]], [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]], [[Xzibit]], [[Method Man]], [[Jadakiss]], [[Fat Joe]], [[Sticky Fingaz]], [[T.I.]] and others. Eminem rapped a verse in a live performance of [[Busta Rhymes]]' &quot;[[Touch It]]&quot; remix at the 2006 BET Music Awards on June 27, 2006. Eminem was featured on [[Akon]]'s single &quot;[[Smack That]]&quot; which appeared on his album ''[[Konvicted]]''. He was featured on [[Lil Wayne]]'s hit song [[Drop the World]].

Eminem is also an active rap producer. Besides being the executive producer of D12's first two albums, ''[[Devil's Night (album)|Devil's Night]]'' and ''[[D12 World]]'', he has executive produced Obie Trice's ''[[Cheers (album)|Cheers]]'' and ''[[Second Round's on Me]]'' as well as 50 Cent's ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (album)|Get Rich or Die Tryin']]'' and ''[[The Massacre]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A2834-2005Mar2.html|title=Guns &amp; Lovers: Two Sides of 50 Cent |work=Washington Post | first=Sean | last=Daly | date=March 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Eminem has produced songs by other famous rappers, such as [[Jadakiss]]' &quot;Welcome To D-Block&quot;, [[Jay-Z]]'s &quot;[[Renegade (Jay-Z song)|Renegade]]&quot; and &quot;Moment of Clarity&quot; [[Lloyd Banks]]' &quot;[[On Fire (Lloyd Banks song)|On Fire]]&quot;, &quot;Warrior Part 2&quot;, and &quot;[[Hands Up (Lloyd Banks song)|Hands Up]]&quot;, [[Tony Yayo]]'s &quot;Drama Setter&quot;, [[Trick-Trick]]'s &quot;[[Welcome 2 Detroit (song)|Welcome 2 Detroit]]&quot;, and Xzibit's &quot;My Name&quot; and &quot;Don't Approach Me&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1486416/20040416/eminem.jhtml?headlines=true|title=For The Record: Quick News On Eminem And Jadakiss, William Hung, Blink-182, Beastie Boys, The Darkness &amp; More |publisher=MTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of ''The Eminem Show'' was produced by Eminem himself, with co-production from longtime collaborator [[Bass Brothers|Jeff Bass]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0223,christgau,35393,22.html|title=White American |publisher=[[The Village Voice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He split the production with Dr. Dre on ''Encore''.

With regard to the productions on his own records, Eminem is seen as having an unusual style in that rather than write to beats he typically starts with an idea of how he wants his song to be structured based on the lyrics and then creates music according to that.&lt;ref name=&quot;hitquarters.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_MarcLabelle.html |title=Interview With Marc Labelle |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=November 28, 2005 |accessdate=2010-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A notable exception to this was the song &quot;Stan&quot;, which came from an idea and scratch track produced by Mark the 45 King.&lt;ref name=&quot;hitquarters.com&quot;/&gt;

===Comparisons to other artists===
As [[Asher Roth]] gained prominence being a white performer in a predominantly black musical genre, Roth has earned many comparisons to Eminem, so much so that he devoted a track on his album to the famed rapper, entitled &quot;As I Em.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philadelphiaweekly.com/news-and-opinion/cover-story/Asher-Roth-42983072.html?page=2&amp;comments=1&amp;showAll= |title=Asher Roth Is on His Way to Stardom &amp;#124; Cover Story &amp;#124; News and Opinion |publisher=Philadelphia Weekly |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eminem and [[Christian hip hop]] artist [[KJ-52]] were often compared to each other, as many called KJ-52 the &quot;Christian counterpart&quot; of Eminem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/iyf/music/bandsartists/3.29.html |title=The Christian Slim Shady? &amp;#124; Teens |publisher=Christianitytoday.com |date=January 3, 2001 |accessdate=2011-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most notable mainstream reactions to Gospel rap was to KJ-52 and his single &quot;Dear Slim&quot;, which was written to Eminem in an attempt reach him with the message of Christianity, though Eminem claims to be a Christian.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The song became famous and controversial among Eminem fans when it was featured on the hit show ''[[Total Request Live]]''.

In 2011, rapper [[Mac Miller]] was praised by Donald Trump, who called Miller &quot;the next Eminem&quot; in reaction to Miller's music video &quot;Donald Trump&quot; reached 20 million views on YouTube.

==Personal life==

===Family===
Eminem has been the subject of much scrutiny, both as a rapper as well as in his personal life.&lt;ref name=&quot;criminal&quot;/&gt; He was married twice to Kimberly Anne Scott, whom he met in high school. Kimberly had run away from her home as a teenager, along with her sister Dawn. They moved in with Marshall and his mother when he was 15. Kim and Marshall began their on-and-off relationship in 1989, and were married in 1999. In 2000, they filed for divorce shortly after Kim's second drunk driving conviction.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarshallMathers.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.marshallmathers.com/index.php/know/articles/45-all-about-kim All about Kim] MarshallMathers.com.

In early 2010, Mathers responded publicly to tabloid reports of his pending reunion with Kim with a firm denial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Eminem has adopted two other daughters: Alaina &quot;Lainie&quot; Mathers, the child of Kimberley Scott's sister,&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;/&gt; who has been referenced by name in some songs including &quot;[[Mockingbird (Eminem song)|Mockingbird]]&quot;, &quot;[[Airplanes Pt.

Whitney is mentioned in the song &quot;Deja Vu&quot; as well as &quot;Going Through Changes&quot;. Mathers is also the legal guardian of his younger half-brother, Nathan who has been mentioned in &quot;[[Cleanin' Out My Closet]]&quot; and &quot;My Mom&quot;.

===Legal troubles===
In 1999, Eminem's mother sued him for around US$10&amp;nbsp;million over alleged [[slander]] about her in his lyrics regarding ''The Slim Shady LP''; she won about US$1,600 in damages in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bozza|2003|p=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eminem was arrested on June 3, 2000 during an altercation at a car audio store in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]], with Douglas Dail, where he pulled out an unloaded gun and kept it pointed at the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;AOZ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.the411online.com/news18.html|title=Tour tickets available for a price |publisher=The 411 Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, in [[Warren, Michigan]], he allegedly saw his then wife, Kim, kiss bouncer John Guerrera in the parking lot of the ''Hot Rock Café'', and he assaulted him and was then arrested.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;personal life&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AOZ&quot;/&gt; Eminem recreated the Guerrera assault in a skit on his junior album ''[[The Eminem Show]]'' on a track called &quot;The Kiss (Skit).&quot; Mathers was charged with possession of a concealed weapon and assault. Mathers plead guilty to the charges and was given two years [[probation]] for both episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1442656/20010410/eminem.jhtml|title=Eminem Gets Two Years' Probation In Weapon Case|publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7, 2000, Eminem's then-wife, Kimberly Scott attempted suicide by slashing her wrists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/827159.stm |title=Eminem wife's suicide bid|publisher=BBC News |date=July 10, 2000 |accessdate=2011-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott sued Eminem for [[defamation]] after he depicted her violent death in his song &quot;[[Kim (song)|Kim]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;personal life&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4882092.stm Eminem and Kim to divorce again] [[BBC]]; Retrieved 2008-07-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 26, 2000, Eminem was to perform at a concert in Toronto's [[Rogers Centre|Skydome]].&lt;ref name = &quot;B&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title = Ontario wants rap star banned|first = Richard|last = Mackie|author2 = Marissa Nelson|format = newspaper|work=Globe and Mail |location=Canada |location = Toronto|date = October 26, 2000|pages = A1, A4|accessdate =2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Ontario]] Attorney General Jim Flaherty argued that Canada should stop Eminem at the border. &quot;I personally don't want anyone coming to Canada who will come here and advocate violence against women,&quot; he said.&lt;ref name = &quot;B&quot;/&gt; Flaherty claims to have been &quot;disgusted&quot; when reading transcriptions of Eminem's song &quot;Kill You&quot;, which includes lines like &quot;Slut, you think I won't choke no whore/till the vocal cords don't work in her throat no more?&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;B&quot;/&gt; The opinion of the general public to the requests made by the province were negative.

D'Angelo Bailey, a sanitation worker, sued Eminem in 2001 and accused him of invading his privacy by publicizing (in the song “Brain Damage”) unreasonable information that put him in a false light. Bailey admitted that he picked on Mathers but said he merely &quot;bumped&quot; him at school and threw a &quot;little shove.&quot; On October 20, 2003, the charges were dismissed in court.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox News&quot;/&gt;

On June 28, 2001, Eminem was sentenced to one year probation on weapons charges that stemmed from an argument with an employee of [[Psychopathic Records]], assessing him a fine around $2,000 as well as several hours of community service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=van Horn|first=Teri|title=Eminem Gets Probation|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1444843/20010628/eminem.jhtml|publisher=[[MTV News]]|date=June 28, 2001|accessdate=2008-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, 2002, French [[jazz]] pianist [[Jacques Loussier]] filed a $10&amp;nbsp;million lawsuit against Eminem and [[Dr. Dre]], claiming the beat for &quot;Kill You&quot; was stolen from his song.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1904507.stm|title=Eminem sued by jazz star |accessdate=2008-12-24 |publisher=BBC News |date=March 31, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Loussier demanded that all sales of the album be halted and any remaining copies destroyed.

On December 8, 2003, the United States Secret Service admitted it was &quot;looking into&quot; allegations that Eminem had threatened the President of the United States, [[George W. Bush]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Music/12/05/eminem.lyrics/ |publisher=CNN | title=Secret Service checks Eminem's 'dead president' lyric | date=December 5, 2003 | accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the song &quot;We as Americans&quot;, as an unreleased bootleg, circulated with the lyrics &quot;Fuck money, I don't rap for dead presidents. I'd rather see the president dead, it's never been said but I set precedents.&quot; The incident was later referenced in the video for his song [[Mosh (song)|&quot;Mosh&quot;]] as one of several news clips on a wall, along with other newspaper articles about other unfortunate incidents in Bush's career. The song eventually appeared on the album's bonus disc, where the lyrics were extensively censored.

In 2005, Eminem's aunt and uncle, Jack and Betty Schmitt, sued him, alleging that he has promised them a $350,000 house and the money to keep it up, and instead has kept it in his name and tried to evict them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox News&quot;/&gt;

In 2007, his music publishing company, ''Eight Mile Style LLC'', together with Martin Affiliated LLC, filed suit against [[Apple Inc.]] and [[Aftermath Entertainment]] claiming Aftermath did not have the appropriate authority to negotiate a deal with Apple for digital downloads of 93 Eminem songs on Apple's [[iTunes]] service.&lt;ref name=&quot;apple2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crainsdetroit.com/article/20090923/FREE/909239976# |title=Crainsdetroit.com |publisher=Crainsdetroit.com |date=September 23, 2009 |accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Apple, Eminem headed for trial as talks break down,&quot; Stempel, Jonathan, 2009 September 23, [http://www.reuters.com/article/internetNews/idUSTRE58M31S20090923 reuters.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The case against Apple was settled shortly after trial began in late September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/10/06/ap/music/main5366998.shtml |title=Eminem's Music Publisher, Apple Settle Dispute |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date=October 6, 2009 |accessdate=2010-09-12 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2010 the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] ruled in [[F.B.T. Productions, LLC v. Aftermath Records]] that F.B.T. Productions and Eminem were owed a royalty of 50% of the net revenue Aftermath obtained by licensing Eminem's recordings to companies like [[Apple Inc.]], [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint]], [[Nextel]], [[Cingular]], and [[T-Mobile]].  In March 2011 the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] upheld this ruling.&lt;ref name=scotus_appeal&gt;[http://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=12478269983023958737&amp;q=F.B.T.+Productions,+LLC+v.+Aftermath+Records&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,5, Petition for writ of certiorari to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit denied.], March 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug issues===
Eminem has spoken openly about his addiction to prescription drugs, including [[Vicodin]], [[Ambien]], [[Valium]] and [[Methadone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20276424,00.html|title=Eminem Bounces Back from 20-Pill-a-Day Addiction|last=McGee|first=Tiffany|date=May 4, 2009|accessdate=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; His group-mate [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]] from D12 stated that Mathers &quot;sobered up&quot; in 2002 from drug and alcohol dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452709/20020301/eminem.jhtml|title=Has Eminem Gone The Way Of Mase And MC Hammer?|publisher=[[MTV News]]|date=March 4, 2002|accessdate=2008-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he did turn to [[zolpidem]] (Ambien) sleeping pills for relief from sleeping troubles. This caused Mathers to cancel the European leg of the [[Anger Management Tour]] in August 2005 and eventually go into rehab for treatment for a &quot;dependency on sleep medication&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-04-23|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1638544.html|title=Drug of choice: Fame can be its own drug but for a select few, it's just not enough |work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2009 interview with British talk-show host [[Jonathan Ross]], Mathers admitted that at the height of his addiction, he considered suicide, saying that, &quot;I just wasn't taking care of myself, at times I wanted to just give it up.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;considered1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idiomag.com/peek/81707/eminem|title=Eminem considered suicide|accessdate=2009-05-14|date=May 13, 2009|publisher=[[idiomag]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also confirmed that he is now sober, commenting that, &quot;Rap was my drug ...

===Proof's death===
On April 11, 2006, Eminem’s best friend and fellow D12 member, [[Proof (rapper)|Proof]] was killed by a gunshot wound to the chest at the CCC Club by club [[Bouncer (doorman)|bouncer]] Mario Etheridge on [[8 Mile Road]] in Detroit, Michigan after fatally shooting Keith Bender, Jr. On April 19, 2006, Eminem, D12, 50 Cent, and thousands of others attended the funeral of Proof at The Fellowship Chapel, Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=D12, Eminem, 50 Cent and Others Attend Proof's Funeral|date=April 20, 2006|publisher=SixShot.com|url=http://www.sixshot.com/news/6031}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eminem made two songs about Proof's death on his album ''[[Recovery (Eminem album)|Recovery]]'' titled &quot;Going Through Changes&quot; and &quot;You're Never Over&quot;, and mentions him in songs on ''[[Relapse (Eminem album)|Relapse]]'' and ''[[Recovery (Eminem album)|Recovery]]'' (&quot;Deja Vu&quot;, &quot;[[Beautiful (Eminem song)|Beautiful]]&quot;, and &quot;Cinderella Man&quot;).

==Controversy==
Eminem was involved in many controversies over lyrics which have been perceived as being [[homophobic]]; an Australian politician attempted to ban entry for Eminem because of these lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/news/Australia_wants_to_ban_Eminem/470469 |title=Australia wants to ban Eminem |publisher=Hollywood.com |date=July 2, 2001 |accessdate=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eminem, however, denies that he is homophobic and defends that during his upbringing such obscene words as ''faggot'' and ''queer'' were commonly spoken as being derogatory in general and not implicitly singled towards homosexuals. During an interview with CBS ''[[60 Minutes]]'' program, gay journalist [[Anderson Cooper]] had a conversation about the issue with Eminem:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=EMINEM DISCUSSES HOMOPHOBIC LYRICS WITH ANDERSON COOPER|url=http://www.towleroad.com/2010/10/eminem-discusses-homophobic-lyrics-with-anderson-cooper.html|accessdate=2 October 2012|date=10 November 2010|agency=Towelroad.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:'''Cooper''': Some of the lyrics, like, you know, in the song &quot;Criminal&quot; you say &quot;My words are like a dagger with a jagged edge, That'll stab you in the head, whether you're a fag or lez, Or the homosex, hermaph or a trans-a-vest, Pants or dress - hate fags? The answer's &quot;yes&quot;&quot;
:'''Eminem''': Yeah, this scene I came up in. That word was thrown around so much, you know, faggot was like thrown around constantly to each other, like in battling.
:'''Cooper''': Do you not like gay people?
:'''Eminem''': No, I don't have any problem with nobody. You know what I mean? I'm just like whatever.

Eminem is, in fact, a friend of gay singer [[Elton John]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news-article/john-slams-eminems-homophobic-label |title=Elton John – John Slams Eminem's Homophobic Label – Contactmusic News |publisher=Contactmusic.com |date=April 8, 2005 |accessdate=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and publicly supports gay rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/37759634/ns/today-entertainment/t/new-tolerant-eminem-supports-gay-marriage/ |title=New ‘tolerant’ Eminem supports gay marriage – Entertainment – Music |publisher=Today.msnbc.msn.com |date=June 17, 2010 |accessdate=2012-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked in an interview with the ''[[New York Times]]'' about the subject of [[same-sex marriage]] being legalized in his home state of Michigan, Eminem responded, &quot;I think if two people love each other, then what the hell?
