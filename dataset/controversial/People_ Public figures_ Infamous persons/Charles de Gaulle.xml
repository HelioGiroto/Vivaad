During World War II, he earned the rank of [[brigadier general]] (retained throughout his life),&lt;ref name=&quot;Ledwidge p. 50-52&quot;&gt;Ledwidge p. 50-52&lt;/ref&gt; leading one of the few successful armoured counter-attacks during the 1940 [[Battle of France]] in May in [[Battle of Montcornet|Montcornet]], and then briefly served in the French government as France was falling. De Gaulle was the most senior French military officer to reject the June 1940 [[Second Armistice at Compiègne|armistice to Nazi Germany]] right from the outset.&lt;ref&gt;Keegan, John. Six Armies in Normandy: From D-Day to the Liberation of Paris. 1994, 1982. New York: Penguin Books. p 296&lt;/ref&gt;

He escaped to Britain and gave a famous radio address, broadcast by the [[BBC]] on 18 June 1940, [[Appeal of 18 June|exhorting the French people to resist]] [[Nazi Germany]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Berthon&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Allies at War|last=Berthon|first=Simon|year=2001|publisher=Collins|location=London|isbn=0-00-711622-5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and organised the [[Free French Forces]] with exiled French officers in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;

| accessdate =10 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the war progressed, de Gaulle gradually gained control of all French colonies except [[French Indochina|Indochina]]. By the time of the Allied invasion of France in 1944 he was heading what amounted to a French government in exile. From the very beginning, De Gaulle insisted that France be treated as a great power by the other Allies, despite her initial defeat. De Gaulle became [[Prime Minister of France|prime minister]] in the [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|French Provisional Government]], resigning in 1946 because of political conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;

After the war he founded his own political party, the [[Rally of the French People]] (RPF) on 14 April 1947. Although he retired from politics in the early 1950s after the RPF's failure to win power, and was banned from the government-controlled TV and radio, he was voted back to power as [[President of the Council of Ministers]] by the French Assembly during the [[May 1958 crisis (France)|May 1958 crisis]]. De Gaulle led the writing of a new constitution founding the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]],&lt;ref&gt;

and was elected [[President of France]].

As President, Charles de Gaulle ended the political chaos that preceded his return to power. A new French currency was issued in January 1960 to control inflation and industrial growth was promoted. Although he initially supported French rule over [[Algeria]], he controversially decided to grant independence to that country, ending an expensive and unpopular war but leaving France divided and having to face down opposition from the European settlers and French military who had originally supported his return to power.

Immensely patriotic, de Gaulle and his supporters held the view, known as [[Gaullism]], that France should continue to see itself as a major power and should not rely on other countries, such as the United States, for its national security and prosperity. Often criticized for his ''Politics of Grandeur'', de Gaulle oversaw the development of French atomic weapons and promoted a foreign policy independent of American and British influences. He withdrew France from [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] military command — although remaining a member of the western alliance—and twice vetoed Britain's entry into the [[European Community]]. He travelled widely in Eastern Europe and other parts of the world and recognised [[People's Republic of China|Communist China]]. On a visit to Canada in 1967, he gave encouragement to [[Quebec sovereignty movement|Québécois separatism]] with his historical &quot;[[Vive le Québec Libre]]&quot; speech.

During his term, de Gaulle also faced controversy and political opposition from [[French Communist Party|Communists]] and Socialists, as well as from the far right. Despite having been re-elected as President, this time by direct popular ballot, in 1965, in [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]] he appeared likely to lose power amidst widespread protests by students and workers, but survived the crisis with an increased majority in the Assembly. However, de Gaulle resigned in 1969 after losing a referendum in which he proposed more decentralization. He is considered by many to be the most influential leader in modern French history.

==Early life==
[[File:Maaison natale Ch de Gaulle Lille.jpg|thumb|De Gaulle's birth house in [[Lille]], now a national museum.]]
De Gaulle was born in the industrial region of [[Lille]] in [[French Flanders]], the third of five children&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/pages/l-homme/dossiers-thematiques/1890-1940-la-genese/jeunesse-et-formation/reperes/chronologie-1890-1913.php|title = Chronologie 1890–1913|accessdate =8 November 2010|publisher=La fondation Charles de Gaulle|language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Henri de Gaulle]], a professor of history and literature at a [[Jesuit]] college, who eventually founded his own school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grolier&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grolier.com/wwii/wwii_degaulle.html|title=Charles de Gaulle|accessdate=27 December 2008|publisher=Grolier Online}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in a family of devout Roman Catholics who were patriotic and traditionalist, but also quite progressive.&lt;ref&gt;

His father came from a long line of parliamentary [[gentry]] from [[Normandy]] and [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]], while his mother, Jeanne Maillot, descended from a family of wealthy entrepreneurs from [[Lille]]. His mother's family was of part [[Irish people|Irish]] (MacCartan),&lt;ref&gt;François Flohic, Souvenirs d’Outre-Gaulle, Paris, Plon, 1979, p. 208 (en citant Richard Hayes, Biographical Dictionary of Irishmen in France, Dublin, Gill, 1949, p. 163)One Anthony MacCartan, of Kinclary in County Down, after fighting for the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] cause in Ireland, left to enlist in the [[Irish Brigade (French)|Irish Brigade]] of the King of France,  like many veterans of that war. By the end of the 18th century, the MacCartan family had taken root in the north of France.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scottish people|Scottish]] (Fleming) and [[Germans|German]] (Kolb) ancestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crawley&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=De Gaulle|last=Crawley|first=Aidan|year=1969|publisher=The Literary Guild|location=London|pages=13–16|asin=B000KXPUCK}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(Ledwidge, Bernard (1982), De Gaulle. London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson. p. 6. ISBN 0-297-77952-4)&lt;/ref&gt; According to Henri, the paternal family's true origin was never determined, but could have been Celtic. He thought that the name could be derived from the word ''gaule''—a long pole which was used in the Middle Ages to beat fruits from the trees.&lt;ref&gt;Crawley p. 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crawley comments further: 'Henri's theory may have been known in scholastic circles, for in November 1940, a group of Paris students marched around the Arc de Triomphe each carrying two poles ('deux gaules') as a gesture of defiance to the uncomprehending Germans'.&lt;/ref&gt; Another source has the name deriving from ''Galle'', meaning &quot;oak&quot; in the [[Gaulish language]], and the sacred tree of the [[druids]].&lt;ref&gt;

The oldest recorded ancestor of de Gaulle could well be that of a Richard de Gaulle, squire of King [[Philippe Auguste]], who endowed the De Gaulle with a fiefdom in [[Elbeuf-en-Bray]] in [[Normandy]] in 1210.&lt;ref&gt;Paul-Marie de La Gorce, De Gaulle entre deux mondes, Fayard, 1964, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; 

De Gaulle's father, Henri, encouraged historical and philosophical debate between his children at mealtimes, and through his encouragement, Charles grew familiar with French history from an early age. Struck by his mother’s tale of how she cried as a child when she heard of the French capitulation to the Germans at [[Sedan, Ardennes|Sedan]] in 1870, he developed a keen interest in military strategy and endlessly questioned his father about the other failures of the brief war at Vionville and Mars-la-Tour, and though a naturally shy person his entire life, often organised other children to re-enact ancient French battles.

The wider de Gaulle family were also very literary and academic, and he was raised on tales of the flight of the Scottish Stuarts into France, to whom he was related on his mother's side. He was also impressed by his uncle, also called [[Charles de Gaulle (poet)|Charles de Gaulle]], who was a historian and passionate [[Celticist]] who wrote books and pamphlets advocating the union of the Welsh, Scots, Irish and [[Bretons]] into one people.  His grandfather Julien-Philippe was also a historian and his grandmother Josephine-Marie wrote poems which impassioned his Christian faith.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schoenbrun&quot;&gt;The Three Lives of Charles de Gaulle: David Schoenbrun, 1966&lt;/ref&gt;

When he was eight years old, the young Charles suffered what he regarded as the most traumatic event of his childhood; the French humiliation at being forced to withdraw its expeditionary force from the upper Nile region to prevent the [[Fashoda Incident]] developing into outright war with Britain. This marked the beginning of his lifelong mistrust of Great Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fenby&quot;&gt;The General Charles de Gaulle &amp; The France He Saved: Jonathan Fenby 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Always a voracious reader, he particularly loved to read his father’s books by such writers as [[Henri Bergson]], [[Charles Péguy]], and [[Maurice Barrès]]. In addition to the German philosophers [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Johann Goethe]], the works of the ancient Greeks (especially [[Plato]]) and the prose of the romanticist poet [[François-René de Chateaubriand]]. By the time he was ten, he was reading medieval history, such as the [[Chronicles of Froissart|Froissart’s Chronicles]] of the [[Hundred Years War]]. He began his own writing in his early teens, and later his family paid for one composition, a one-act play in verse about a traveller, to be privately published.

When he was 11, the family moved to Paris, where he loved to climb the tower at [[Notre Dame de Paris]] to look out over the city, and also visit the Catholic Church of [[Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]]&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt; with his parents to listen to the world famous organ music.

De Gaulle was educated in Paris at the [[Collège Stanislas de Paris|College Stanislas]] and also briefly in [[Belgium]] where he continued to display his interest in reading and studying history,&lt;ref name=&quot;Grolier&quot;/&gt; and shared the great pride many of his countrymen felt in their nation’s achievements. France made a significant contribution to European culture with its [[Impressionists|Impressionist painters]], the sculpture of [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]], writers such as [[Émile Zola]] and [[Marcel Proust]] and the music of [[Claude Debussy]], and helped lead the way with technological advances such as with the construction of the [[Suez Canal]] and the [[Eiffel Tower]] and in recent developments in aviation, the cinema and the motor car. As he grew older, he also developed a profound belief in his destiny to achieve great things, and, eager to avenge the French defeat of 1870, decided upon a military career as being the best way to make a name for himself.&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;

==Officer cadet==
Before he could become an officer cadet, regulations which had recently been introduced dictated that he had to spend a year as an ordinary soldier. As an individualist, de Gaulle was an average soldier. He was promoted to corporal after six months, then to sergeant. He disliked barrack life and what he saw as pointless regulations, not because he objected to military discipline, but because he considered the procedures to be time wasting and out of date to the point of possibly damaging the military potential of the best new recruits.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;

Afterwards, de Gaulle spent four years studying and training at the elite military academy, [[École Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr|Saint-Cyr]]. While there, and because of his height, high forehead, and nose, he acquired the nicknames of &quot;the great asparagus&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dallas&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dallas|first=Gregor|title=1945: The War That Never Ended|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, Conn.|year=2005|isbn=0-300-10980-6|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salem&quot;&gt;[https://salempress.com/Store/samples/great_lives_from_history_20th/great_lives_from_history_20th_de_gaulle.htm Gorman, Robert F. (ed.) (2008) &quot;Charles de Gaulle&quot; ''Great Lives from History: The 20th century'' Salem Press, Pasadena, Calif.], ISBN 978-1-58765-345-2&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;[[Cyrano de Bergerac (play)|Cyrano]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Debray&quot;&gt;Debray, Régis (1994) ''Charles de Gaulle: Futurist of the Nation'' translated by John Howe, Verso, New York, ISBN 0-86091-622-7; a translation of Debray, Régis (1990) ''A demain de Gaulle'' Gallimard, Paris, ISBN 2-07-072021-7&lt;/ref&gt;

He did well at the academy and received praise for his conduct, manners, intelligence, character, military spirit and resistance to fatigue. However, he often quarrelled with his company commander and other officers that there was a lack of preparation for war with Germany, and that the French training and equipment were inadequate to deal with a numerically superior adversary.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schoenbrun&quot;/&gt; Graduating in 1912 in 13th place out of 210 cadets, his passing out report noted that he was a highly gifted cadet who should go on to make an excellent officer. Preferring to serve in France rather than far away in North Africa or [[Indochina]], he joined the 33rd [[infantry]] regiment of the [[French Army]], based at [[Arras, France|Arras]] and commanded by Colonel (and future Marshal) [[Philippe Pétain]]. De Gaulle's career would follow Pétain's for the next 20 years.{{r|time19590105}}

==First World War==
While at Arras in the build up to [[World War I]], de Gaulle developed a good rapport with his commanding officer, Pétain, with whom he shared a number of ideas on French military affairs, and was often seen on exercise and in officer’s quarters with his superior debating great battles and the likely outcome of any coming war.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt; Both men agreed that the invention of the machine gun and rapid-firing artillery rendered cavalry virtually obsolete and would require a shift to semi-static positions from which attacks would be made under the protection of a heavy barrage at the enemy.

When war finally broke out in late July 1914, the 33rd Regiment, considered one of the best fighting units in France was immediately thrown into checking the German advance at [[Dinant]].  However, the traditionally minded French Fifth Army commander, General [[Charles Lanrezac]] threw his units into pointless bayonet charges with bugles and full colours flying against the German artillery, incurring heavy losses.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;

Promoted to platoon commander, de Gaulle was involved in fierce fighting from the outset but was among the first to be wounded. In hospital, he grew bitter at the tactics used, and spoke with other injured officers against the outdated methods of the French army. Yet, with General [[Joseph Joffre]]'s decision to stop the retreat and counter-attack, favoured by the arrival of British units and by changes in the command structure, the rapid German advance was eventually stalled by mid September at the [[First Battle of the Marne]]. Returning to find many of his former comrades dead, he was put in charge of a company. De Gaulle's unit gained recognition for repeatedly crawling out into [[No mans land|no-mans-land]] to listen to the conversations of the enemy in their trenches, and the information he brought back was so valuable that in January 1915 he received a citation for his bravery. After a more serious wound which incapacitated him for four months, he was promoted to ''capitaine'' (captain) in September 1915. Taking charge of his company, he narrowly escaped death shortly afterwards when he was blown up by a mine, leaving him with a wound in his left hand which obliged him later to wear his wedding ring on his right hand.

At the [[Battle of Verdun]] in March 1916, while leading a charge to try to break out of a position which had become surrounded by the enemy, he received a bayonet wound to the leg after being stunned by a shell and, passing out from the effects of poison gas, was captured at [[Douaumont]], one of the few survivors of his battalion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grolier&quot;/&gt; Initially giving him up for dead, Pétain, who was later to achieve great acclaim for his role in the battle, wrote in the regimental journal that de Gaulle had been &quot;an outstanding officer in all respects&quot;.&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;

In captivity de Gaulle acquired yet another nickname, ''Le Connétable'' (&quot;[[Constable of France|The Constable]]&quot;). This came about because of his reading German newspapers (he had learned German at school and spent a vacation in the [[Black Forest]] region) and giving talks on his view of the progress of the conflict to fellow prisoners. These were delivered with such patriotic ardour and confidence in victory that they called him by the title which had been given to the commander-in-chief of the French army during the monarchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ledwidge&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ledwidge|first=Bernard|title=De Gaulle|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicolson|location=London| year=1982|isbn=0-297-77952-4|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While being held as a [[prisoner of war]], de Gaulle wrote his first book, co-written by Matthieu Butler, ''L'Ennemi et le vrai ennemi'' (&quot;The Enemy and the True Enemy&quot;), analysing the issues and divisions within the [[German Empire]] and its forces; the book was published in 1924.

In all, he made five unsuccessful escape attempts,{{r|time19590105}} being moved to higher security accommodation and punished on his return with long periods of solitary confinement and with the withdrawal of privileges such as newspapers and tobacco. In his letters to his parents he constantly spoke of his frustration that the war was continuing without him, calling the situation &quot;a shameful misfortune&quot; and compared it to being [[cuckold]]ed. As the war neared its end, he grew depressed that he was playing no part in the victory, but despite his efforts, he remained in captivity until the German surrender. On 1 December 1918, three weeks after the armistice, he returned to his father's house in the Dordogne to be reunited with his three brothers, who had all served in the army yet somehow survived the war.

==Between the wars==
After the [[armistice]], de Gaulle continued to serve in the army, and was with the staff of the [[French Military Mission to Poland|French military mission to Poland]] as an instructor of Polish Infantry during its [[Polish-Soviet War|war with Communist Russia]] (1919–1921).&lt;ref name=&quot;Grolier&quot;/&gt; He distinguished himself in operations near the [[Zbrucz|River Zbrucz]] and won the highest Polish military decoration, the ''[[Virtuti Militari]]''&lt;ref&gt;

He was promoted to ''commandant'' in the Polish Army and offered a further career in [[Poland]], but chose instead to return to France, where he taught at the [[École Militaire]]. Although he was a protégé of his old commander, Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Grolier&quot;/&gt; De Gaulle believed in the use of tanks and rapid manoeuvres rather than trench warfare.

De Gaulle served with the Army of Occupation in the Rhineland in the mid 1920s. As a ''[[commandant]]'' (&quot;major&quot;) by the late 1920s, he briefly commanded a light infantry battalion at Treves (Trier) and then served a tour of duty in Syria, then a French protectorate under a [[French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon|mandate from the League of Nations]]. During the 1930s, now a lieutenant-colonel, he served as a staff officer in France. In 1934 he wrote ''Vers l’Armée de Métier'' (&quot;Toward a Professional Army&quot;), which advocated a professional army based on mobile armoured divisions. Such an army would both compensate for the poor French demography, and be an efficient tool to enforce international law, particularly the [[Treaty of Versailles]] which forbade Germany from rearming. The book sold only 700 copies in France, where Pétain advocated an infantry-based, defensive army, but 7,000 copies in Germany, where it was read aloud to [[Adolf Hitler]].&lt;ref name=&quot;time19590105&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Charles de Gaulle|url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/personoftheyear/archive/stories/1958.html|accessdate=9 October 2010|newspaper=Time|date=5 January 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outbreak of World War II, de Gaulle was still a [[colonel]], having antagonised the leaders of the military through the 1920s and 1930s with his bold views. Initially commanding a tank regiment in the French [[Fifth Army (France)|Fifth Army]], de Gaulle implemented many of his theories and tactics for armoured warfare against an enemy whose strategies resembled his own.{{r|time19590105}} After the German breakthrough at [[Sedan, France|Sedan]] on 15 May 1940 he was given command of the improvised [[4e Division cuirassée]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CDG&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 May, de Gaulle attacked [[Nazi Germany|German]] tank forces at [[Battle of Montcornet|Montcornet]] with 200 tanks but no air support. Although de Gaulle's tanks forced the German infantry to retreat to [[Caumont-sur-Durance|Caumont]] the action brought only temporary relief and did little to slow the spearhead of the German advance. Nevertheless, it was one of the few successes the French enjoyed while suffering defeats elsewhere across the country. In recognition for his efforts, De Gaulle was promoted to acting [[brigadier general]] on 24 May, a rank he would hold for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ledwidge p. 50-52&quot;/&gt; On 28, he took part in an attempt to rescue the Allied force trapped at Dunkirk by cutting an escape route through German forces at [[Battle of Abbeville|Abbeville]]. 

On 5 June, Prime Minister [[Paul Reynaud]] appointed him Under Secretary of State for [[Minister of Defence (France)|National Defence and War]] and put him in charge of coordination with the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;

As a junior member of the French government, he unsuccessfully opposed surrender, advocating instead that the government remove itself to [[North Africa]] and carry on the war as best it could from France's African colonies. While serving as a liaison with the British government, de Gaulle telephoned Reynaud from London on 16 June informing him of the [[Franco-British Union#World War II (1940)|offer by Britain of a Declaration of Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roussel&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; would have merged France and the United Kingdom into one country, with a single government and army.

In rejecting the proposal, Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]], believing that Germany would soon defeat Britain as well and who later went on to lead the collaborationist Vichy regime, told British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] that &quot;in three weeks, England will have its neck wrung like a chicken&quot; and that such a plan would be like &quot;fusion with a corpse&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;The Fall of France - Winston Churchill 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:De-gaulle-radio.jpg|thumb|right|General de Gaulle speaking on [[BBC Radio]] during the war.]]

Returning the same day to [[Bordeaux]], the temporary wartime capital, de Gaulle learned that Marshal Pétain had become prime minister and was planning to seek an [[armistice]] with Nazi Germany. De Gaulle and other allied officers rebelled against the new French government; on the morning of 17 June, de Gaulle and a few senior French officers flew to Britain with 100,000 gold francs in secret funds provided to him by the ex-prime minister Paul Reynaud. Narrowly escaping the [[Luftwaffe]], he landed safely in London that afternoon.

===Leader of the Free French===
[[File:De Gaulle - à tous les Français.jpg|thumb|upright|&quot;To all Frenchmen&quot; : De Gaulle exhorting the French to resist to the German occupation]]
De Gaulle strongly denounced the French government's decision to seek armistice with the Nazis and set about building the [[Free French Forces]] from the soldiers and officers deployed outside France or who had fled France with him. On 18 June, de Gaulle delivered a famous radio address via the [[BBC Radio]] service. Although the British cabinet initially attempted to block the speech, they were overruled by Churchill.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDG&quot;/&gt;

De Gaulle's ''[[Appeal of 18 June]]'' exhorted the French people not to be demoralised and to continue to resist the occupation of France and work against the collaborationist [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]], which had signed an armistice with Nazi Germany. Although the original broadcast could only be heard in a few parts of occupied France, de Gaulle's subsequent speeches reached many parts of the territories under the Vichy regime, helping to rally the French resistance movement and earning him much popularity amongst the French people and soldiers. On 4 July 1940, a [[court-martial]] in [[Toulouse]] sentenced de Gaulle ''in absentia'' to four years in prison. At a second court-martial on 2 August 1940 de Gaulle was condemned to death for [[treason]] against the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CDG&quot;/&gt;

With British support, the de Gaulle family made their exile home in England.  For the first four months they rented a home in [[Petts Wood]] near [[Bromley, London]], then moved further inland to [[Shropshire]], where they rented Gadlas Hall, [[Dudleston Heath]], near [[Ellesmere, Shropshire|Ellesmere]].&lt;ref name=Shropstar&gt;{{cite news|title=De Gaulle Dead (main story) The year of exile in Salop [ie Shropshire] (sub story)|work=Shropshire Star|date=10 November 1970|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They later lived at Rodinghead&lt;ref name=Shropstar /&gt; near [[Berkhamsted]], [[Hertfordshire]] (36 miles northwest of London) from October 1941 to September 1942.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mahrane&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| title = de Gaulle 1958–1970|journal=Le Point (Grand Angle) |date = June 2010| first = Said|last = Mahrane|issue = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; He organised the Free French forces and gradually the Allies gave increasing support and recognition to de Gaulle's efforts. In dealings with his British allies and the United States, de Gaulle insisted at all times on retaining full freedom of action on behalf of France and he was constantly on the verge of being cut off by the Allies. Many denials of the deep and mutual antipathy between de Gaulle and political leaders of Anglo-American allies of the French are on historical record.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cavortingwithstrangers.com/bookVIII-Gaulle.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/article995545.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=Charles | last=Bremner | title=Did De Gaulle really hate the British Mais non | date=18 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He harboured a suspicion of the British in particular, believing that they were surreptitiously seeking to steal France's colonial possessions in the [[Levant]]. A self-confessed [[francophile]], Winston Churchill was often frustrated at de Gaulle's patriotic egocentricity, but also wrote of his &quot;immense admiration&quot; for him during the early days of his British exile. Though their relationship later became strained, Churchill tried to explain the reasons for de Gaulle's behaviour in the second volume of his history of World War II;

:&quot;He felt it was essential to his position before the French people that he should maintain a proud and haughty demeanour towards &quot;perfidious Albion&quot;, although in exile, dependent upon our protection and dwelling in our midst. He had to be rude to the British to prove to French eyes that he was not a British puppet. He certainly carried out this policy with perseverance&quot;.

[[Clementine Churchill]], who admired de Gaulle, once cautioned him, &quot;General, you must not hate your friends more than you hate your enemies.&quot; De Gaulle himself stated famously, &quot;France has no friends, only interests.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TDQ&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Travellers' Dictionary of Quotation: Who Said What, About Where?|editor=Peter Yapp|year=1983|month=April|publisher=Routledge Kegan &amp; Paul|location=London|isbn=0-7100-0992-5, 9780710009920|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation was nonetheless complex, and de Gaulle's mistrust of both British and U.S. intentions with regards to France was mirrored by a mistrust of the Free French among the U.S. political leadership, who for a long time refused to recognise de Gaulle as the representative of France, preferring to deal with representatives of the Vichy government. Roosevelt in particular hoped that it would be possible to wean Pétain away from Germany.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berthon&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title=Allies at War: Churchill V Roosevelt V De Gaulle|last=Berthon|first=Simo|date=4 June 2001|publisher=Collins|location=London|isbn=0-00-711622-5|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Working with the [[French resistance]] and other supporters in France's colonial African possessions after the [[Operation Torch|Anglo-U.S. invasion of North Africa]] in November 1942, de Gaulle moved his headquarters to [[Algiers]] in May 1943. He became first joint head (with the less resolutely independent General [[Henri Giraud]], the candidate preferred by the U.S. who wrongly suspected de Gaulle of being a British puppet) and then – after squeezing out Giraud by force of personality – sole chairman of the [[French Committee of National Liberation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CDG&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Casablanca-shot0033.png|thumb|Rival French leaders [[Henri Giraud]] (left) and Charles de Gaulle sit down after shaking hands in presence of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Winston Churchill]] ([[Casablanca Conference]], 14 January 1943) – a public display of unity, but the handshake was only for show.&lt;ref&gt;Allies at War, part 3, BBC TV&lt;/ref&gt;]]

De Gaulle was held in high regard by Allied commander General [[Dwight Eisenhower]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Keegan, John 1994, p 298&quot;&gt;Keegan, John. Six Armies in Normandy: From D-Day to the Liberation of Paris. 1994, 1982. New York: Penguin Books. p 298&lt;/ref&gt; In Algiers in 1943, Eisenhower gave De Gaulle the assurance in person that a French force would liberate Paris and arranged that the army division of French General [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque]] would be transferred from North Africa to England to carry out that liberation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keegan, John 1994, p 298&quot;/&gt; Eisenhower was impressed by the combativeness of units of the [[Free French Forces]] and &quot;grateful for the part they had played in mopping up the remnants of German resistance&quot;; he also detected how strongly devoted many were to de Gaulle and how ready they were to accept him as the national leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keegan, John 1994, p 298&quot;/&gt;

===Preparations for D-Day===
As preparations for the liberation of Europe gathered pace, the Americans in particular found de Gaulle's tendency to view everything from the French perspective to be extremely tiring. Roosevelt, who refused to recognise any provisional authority in France until elections had been held, considered de Gaulle to be a potential dictator, a view backed by a number of leading Frenchmen in Washington, including [[Jean Monnet]], who later became an instrumental figure in the setting up of the [[European Coal and Steel Community]] that led to the modern [[European Union]]. He also refused to allow Churchill to provide de Gaulle with strategic details of the imminent invasion because he did not trust him to keep the information to himself. French codes were known to be weak, but because the Free French refused to use British or American codes, this posed a major security risk.&lt;ref&gt;D. Day, ''The Battle for Normandy''. Antony Beevor 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, a few days before D-Day Churchill, whose relationship with the General had deteriorated since the days he first came to Britain, decided he needed to keep him more or less informed of developments, and on 2 June he sent two passenger aircraft and his representative, [[Duff Cooper]] to Algiers to bring de Gaulle back to Britain. De Gaulle refused because of Roosevelt's intention to install a provisional Allied military government in the former occupied territories pending elections, but he eventually relented and flew to Britain the next day.

Upon his arrival at RAF Northolt on 4 June 1944 he received an official welcome, and a letter reading &quot;My dear general! Welcome to these shores, very great military events are about to take place!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;D. Day: Battle for Normandy. Antony Beevor 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Later, on his personal train, Churchill informed him that he wanted him to make a radio address, but when informed that the Americans continued to refuse to recognise his legitimate right to power in France, and after Churchill suggested he request a meeting with Roosevelt to improve his relationship with the president, de Gaulle became angry, demanding to know why he should &quot;lodge my candidacy for power in France with Roosevelt; the French government exists&quot;.&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;
[[File:Churchill De Gaulle HU 60057.jpg|thumb|upright|Winston Churchill and General de Gaulle at [[Marrakesh]], January 1944]]
De Gaulle was concerned at a general break down of civil order and of a potential communist takeover in the vacuum which might follow a German withdrawal of France.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;D. Day; Liberation of Normany. Antony Beevor 2009&lt;/ref&gt; During the general conversation which followed with those present, de Gaulle was involved in an angry exchange with the Labour minister, [[Ernest Bevin]], and, raising his concerns about the validity of the new currency to be circulated by the Allies after the liberation, de Gaulle commented scornfully, &quot;go and wage war with your false money&quot;. De Gaulle was much concerned that an American takeover of the French administration would just provoke a communist uprising.

Churchill then also lost his temper, saying that Britain could not act separately from America, and that under the circumstances, if they had to choose between France and the US, Britain would always choose the latter. De Gaulle replied that he realised that this would always be the case. The next day, de Gaulle refused to address the French nation because the script again made no mention of his being the legitimate interim ruler of France. It instructed the French people to obey Allied military authorities until elections could be held, and so the row continued, with de Gaulle calling Churchill a &quot;gangster&quot;. Churchill in turn accused the general of treason in the height of battle, and demanded he be flown back to Algiers &quot;in chains if necessary&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In the years to come, the hostile dependent wartime relationship of de Gaulle and his future political peers re-enacted the historical national and colonial rivalry and lasting enmity between the French and English,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeaninstitute.org/Summer/Fall-2007/europes-most-influential-love-hate-relationship.html The European Institute]&lt;/ref&gt; and foreshadowed the deep distrust of France for post-war Anglo-American partnerships.

===Return to France===
Perhaps inevitably, de Gaulle ignored ''les Anglo-Saxons'', and proclaimed the authority of the [[Free French Forces]] in France the next day. Under the leadership of [[Jean de Lattre de Tassigny|General de Lattre de Tassigny]], France fielded an entire army – a joint force of Free French together with French colonial troops from North Africa – on the western front. Initially landing as part of [[Operation Dragoon]], in the south of France, the [[French First Army]] helped to liberate almost one third of the country and actively rejoined the Allies in the struggle against Germany. As the invasion slowly progressed and the Germans were pushed back, de Gaulle made preparations to return to France.

On 14 June 1944 he left Britain for France for what was supposed to be a one day trip. Despite an agreement that he would take only two staff, he was accompanied by a large entourage with extensive luggage, and although many rural Normans remained mistrustful of him, he was warmly greeted by the inhabitants of the towns he visited, such as the badly damaged [[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]]. Finally he arrived at the city of [[Bayeux]], which he now proclaimed as the capital of Free France. Appointing his Aide-de-Camp Francois Coulet as head of the civil administration, de Gaulle returned to England that same night on a French destroyer, and although the official position of the supreme military command remained unchanged, local Allied officers found it more practical to deal with the fledgling administration in Bayeux in everyday matters.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;
[[File:DeGaulle in Chad.jpg|thumb|upright|Governor-General [[Félix Éboué]] welcomes de Gaulle to [[French Chad|Chad]].]]
De Gaulle flew to Algiers on 16 June and then went on to Rome to meet the Pope and the new Italian Government. At the beginning of July he at last visited Roosevelt in Washington, where he received the 17 gun salute of a senior military leader rather than the 21 guns of a visiting head of state. The visit was ‘devoid of trust on both sides’ according to the French representative,&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt; however Roosevelt did make some concessions towards recognising the legitimacy of the Bayeux administration.

Meanwhile, with the Germans retreating in the face of the Allied onslaught, harried all the way by the resistance, there were widespread instances of revenge attacks on those accused of collaboration. A number of prominent officials and members of the feared [[Milice]] were murdered, often by exceptionally brutal means, provoking the Germans into appalling reprisals, such as in the destruction of the village of [[Oradour-sur-Glane]] and the killing of its 642 inhabitants.&lt;ref&gt;Purnell’s History of the Second World War: No. 123 1966. The Liberation of Paris by Kenneth Macksey&lt;/ref&gt; Of little strategic value, Paris was initially not high on the list of Allied objectives, but both de Gaulle and the commander of the 2nd Armoured Division, General [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque|Philippe Leclerc]] were concerned that a possible communist attempt to take over the capital would plunge France into civil war. De Gaulle successfully lobbied for Paris to be made a priority for liberation on humanitarian grounds and obtained from Allied Supreme Commander General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] an agreement that French troops would be allowed to enter the capital first. A few days later, General Leclerc's French Armoured Division entered the outskirts of the city, and after [[Liberation of Paris|six days of fighting]] in which the resistance played a major part, the German garrison of 5000 men surrendered on 25 August, although some sporadic outbreaks of fighting continued for several days. In surrendering, the German commander General [[Dietrich von Choltitz]] ignored Hitler's orders to raze the city to the ground.

It was fortunate for de Gaulle that the Germans had forcibly removed members of the Vichy government and taken them to Germany a few days earlier on 20 August; it allowed him to enter Paris as a liberator in the midst of the general euphoria,&lt;ref name=&quot;Second World War 1966&quot;&gt;Purnell’s History of the Second World War: No. 72 1966. By Jacques Mondal&lt;/ref&gt; but there were serious concerns that communist elements of the resistance, which had done so much to clear the way for the military would try to seize the opportunity to proclaim their own 'Peoples' Government' in the capital. De Gaulle made contact with Leclerc and demanded the presence of the 2nd Armoured Division to accompany him on a massed parade down the [[Champs Elysees]], &quot;as much for prestige as for security&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Second World War 1966&quot;/&gt; This was in spite of the fact that Leclerc's unit was fighting as part of the American 1st Army and were under strict orders to continue their next objective without obeying orders from anyone else. In the event, the American General [[Omar Bradley]] decided that Leclerc's division would be indispensable for the maintenance of order and the liquidation of the last pockets of resistance in the French capital. Earlier, on 21 August, de Gaulle had appointed his military advisor [[General Koenig|General Marie Koenig]] as Governor of Paris.

[[File:HD-SN-99-02715.JPEG|thumb|General de Gaulle delivering a speech in liberated [[Cherbourg]] from the Hôtel de ville (town hall).]]
As his procession came along the Place de la Concorde on Saturday 26 August, it came under machine gun fire by Vichy militia and fifth columnists who were unable to give themselves up. Later, on entering the cathedral at Notre Dame to be received as head of the provisional government by the Committee of Liberation, loud shots broke out again, and Leclerc and Koenig tried to hustle him through the door, but De Gaulle shook off their hands and never faltered. While the battle began outside, he walked slowly down the aisle. Before he had gone far a machine pistol fired down from above, at least two more joined in, and from below the F.F.I, and police fired back. A BBC correspondent who was present reported;

:&quot;…the General is being presented to the people. He is being received…they have opened fire!… firing started all over the place... that was one of the most dramatic scenes I have ever seen.... General de Gaulle walked straight ahead into what appeared to me to be a hail of fire... but he went straight ahead without hesitation, his shoulders flung back, and walked right down the centre aisle, even while the bullets were pouring about him. It was the most extraordinary example of courage I have ever seen.. . there were bangs, flashes all about him, yet he seemed to have an absolutely charmed life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''TIME'' magazine, 4 September 1944&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in the great hall of the Hotel de Ville, de Gaulle was greeted by a jubilant crowd and, proclaiming the continuity of the Third Republic, delivered a characteristically Franco-centric proclamation;

:&quot;Paris outraged, Paris broken, Paris martyred, but Paris liberated! By herself, liberated by her people, with the help of the whole of France! We will not rest until we march, as we must, into enemy territory as conquerors. France has a right to be in the first line among the great nations who are going to organize the peace and the life of the world. She has a right to be heard in all four corners of the world. France is a great world power. She knows it and will act so that others may know it.&quot;

That night the Germans launched a massive artillery and air bombardment on Paris by way of revenge, killing over a thousand people and wounding several thousand others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Second World War 1966&quot;/&gt; The situation in Paris remained tense, and a few days later de Gaulle, still unsure of the trend of events asked General Eisenhower to send some American troops into Paris as a show of strength. This he did 'not without some satisfaction',&lt;ref name=&quot;Second World War 1966&quot;/&gt; and so on 29 August, the US 28th Infantry Division was rerouted from its journey to the front line and paraded down the Champs Elysees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The same day, Washington and London bowed to the inevitable and finally came to an agreement to accept the position of the Free French. The following day General Eisenhower gave his de facto blessing with a visit to the General in Paris.

==Prime Minister of France 1944–1946==
With the pre-war parties and many of their leaders discredited, there was little opposition to de Gaulle and his associates forming an interim administration.  In order not to be seen as presuming on his position in such austere times, de Gaulle did not use one of the grand official residences such as [[Hotel de Matignon]] or the Presidential palace on the Elysee, but resided briefly in his old office at the War Ministry. When he was joined by his wife and daughters a short while later, they moved into a small state owned villa on edge of [[Bois de Boulogne]] which had once been set aside for [[Hermann Göring]].&lt;ref name =&quot;Werth&quot;&gt;De Gaulle. Alexander Werth (1965)&lt;/ref&gt;

Living conditions immediately after the liberation were even worse than under Nazi rule.  A quarter of housing had been damaged or destroyed, basic public services were at a standstill, petrol and electricity was extremely scarce and, apart from the wealthy who could afford high prices, the population had to get by on very little food.  Large scale public demonstrations erupted all over France protesting at the apparent lack of action at improving the supply of food, while in Normandy, bakeries were pillaged.  The problem was that although wheat production was around 80% of pre war levels, transport was paralysed over virtually the whole of France.  Large areas of track had been destroyed by bombing, most modern equipment, rolling stock, lorries and farm animals had been taken to Germany and all the bridges over the [[Seine]], the [[Loire]] and the [[Rhone]] between Paris and the sea had been destroyed.  The black market pushed real prices to four times the level of 1939, causing the government to print money to try to improve the money supply, which only added to inflation.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;

===Curbing the Communist Resistance===
After the celebrations had died down, de Gaulle began conferring with leading Resistance figures who, with the Germans gone intended to continue as a political and military force, and asked to be given a government building to serve as their headquarters.  The Resistance, in which the Communists were competing with other trends for leadership, had developed its own manifesto for social and political change known as the [[National Council of the Resistance]] (CNR) Charter, and wanted special status to enter the army under their own flags, ranks and honours. Despite their decisive support in backing him against Giraud, de Gaulle disappointed some of the resistance leaders by telling them that although their efforts and sacrifices had been recognised, they had no further role to play and that unless they joined the regular army they should lay down their arms and return to civilian life.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; 

Believing them to be a dangerous revolutionary force, de Gaulle moved to break up the liberation committees and other militias. The political outlook of the Communists represented the complete opposite of his own views, and he was concerned at the amount of support they were receiving from the public. The potential power of the Communists also troubled the American government.  As early as May 1943, the US Secretary of State [[Cordell Hull]] had written to Roosevelt urging him of need to take action to attempt to curb the rise of Communism in France.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;

===The provisional government of the French republic===
On 10 September 1944, the Provisional Government of the French Republic, or Government of National Unanimity was formed.  It included many of de Gaulle’s Free French associates such as [[Gaston Palewski]], Claude Guy, [[Claude Mauriac]] and [[Jacques Soustelle]], together with members of the main parties, which included the Socialists and a new Christian Democratic Party, the MRP under the leadership of Georges Bidault, who served as Foreign Minister.  The President of the prewar Senate [[Jules Jeanneney]] was brought back as second ranking member, but because of their links with Russia, de Gaulle allowed the Communists only two minor positions in his government.  Although they were now a major political force with over a million members, of the full cabinet of 22 men, only [[Augustin Laurent]] and [[Charles Tillon]] - who as head of [[Francs-tireurs et partisans - Main-d'œuvre immigrée|Francs-Tireurs]]-Partisans had been one of the most active members of the resistance – were given ministries.  However, de Gaulle did pardon the Communists' leader [[Maurice Thorez]], who had been sentenced to death in absentia by the French government for desertion.  On his return home from Russia, Thorez delivered a speech supporting de Gaulle in which he said that for the present, the war against Germany was the only task that mattered.

There were also a number of new faces in the government, including a literary academic, [[Georges Pompidou]], who had written to one of de Gaulle’s recruiting agents offering his services, and Jean Monnet, who in spite of his past opposition to the General now recognised the need for unity and served as Commissoner for Economic Planning.  Of equal rank to Ministers and answerable only to the Prime Minister, a number of Commissioners of the Republic (Commissaires de la République) were appointed to re-establish the democratic institutions of France and to extend the legitimacy of the provisional government.  A number of former Free French associates served as Commissioners, including [[Henri Fréville]], [[Raymond Aubrac]] and [[Michel Debré]], who was charged with reforming the Civil Service.  Controversially, de Gaulle also appointed [[Maurice Papon]] as Commissioner for Aquitaine in spite of his involvement in the deportation of Jews while serving as a senior police official in the Vichy regime during the occupation.  Over the years, Papon remained in high official positions but would continue to be implicated in controversial events such as the [[Paris Massacre of 1961]],&lt;ref&gt;Daily Mail 22 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; eventually being convicted of crimes against humanity in 1998.

===Tour of major cities===
De Gaulle’s policy was to postpone elections as long as 2.6 million French were in Germany as prisoners of war and forced labourers.  In mid-September he embarked upon a tour of major provincial cities to increase his public profile and to help cement his position.  Although he received a largely positive reception from the crowds who came out to see him, he reflected that only a few months previously the very same people had come out to cheer Marshal Pétain when he was serving the Vichy regime.  Raymond Aubrac said that the General showed himself to be ill at ease at social functions; in [[Marseilles]] and [[Lyon]] he displayed great irritation when he was forced to sit next to local Resistance leaders at the post-rally banquet and was particularly scathing at what he regarded as the vulgar displays of exuberance among young men and women during the Masquisards parades which preceded his speech.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;  When he reached [[Toulouse]], de Gaulle also had to confront the leaders of a group which had proclaimed themselves to be the provincial government of the city.&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;

During the tour, de Gaulle showed his customary lack of concern for his own safety by mixing with the crowds and thus making himself an easy target for an assassin. Although he was naturally shy, the good use of amplification and patriotic music enabled him to deliver his message that though all of France was fragmented and suffering together they would rise again. During every speech he would stop halfway through to invite the crowd to join him in singing La Marseillaise, before continuing and finishing by raising his hands in the air and crying Vive la France!&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;

===The legal purges (Épuration légale)===
As the war entered its final stages, the nation was forced to confront the reality of how many of its people had behaved under German rule. In France, collaborators were more severely punished than in most other occupied countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; Immediately after the liberation, countless women accused of fraternising with the enemy were publicly shaved in the steets or daubed with feathers, although a significant number were less fortunate, being viciously killed.  With so many of their former members having been hunted down and killed by the Nazis and paramilitary Milice, the Partisans had already summarily executed an estimated 4500 people,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; and the Communists in particular continued to press for severe action against collaborators. In Paris alone, over 150,000 people were at some time detained on suspicion of collaboration, although most were later released. Famous figures accused included the industrialist [[Louis Renault (industrialist)|Louis Renault]], the actress [[Arletty]], who had lived openly with a German officer in [[The Ritz Hotel|the Ritz]], the opera star [[Tino Rossi]], the stage actor [[Sacha Guitry]] and [[Coco Chanel]], who was briefly detained but fled to Switzerland.&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;

Keenly aware of the need to seize the initiative and to get the process under firm judicial control, de Gaulle appointed Justice Minister [[François de Menthon]] to lead the Legal Purge ([[Épuration légale|Épuration Légale]]) to punish traitors and to clear away the traces of the Vichy regime. Knowing that he would need to excuse many of the ‘economic collaborators’ – such as police and civil servants who held minor roles under Vichy in order to keep the country running as normally as possible – he assumed, as head of state the right to commute death sentences.&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt; In all, of the near 2000 people who received the death sentence from the courts, less than 800 were actually executed. De Gaulle commuted 998 of the 1554 capital sentences submitted before him, including all those involving women. Many others were given jail terms or sentenced to national humiliation (loss of civil rights). It is generally agreed that the purge was not well conducted, with often absurdly severe or overly lenient punishments being handed down.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; It was also notable that the less well-off people who were unable to pay for lawyers were more harshly treated. As time went by and feelings grew less intense, a number of people who had held fairly senior positions under the Vichy government – such as Maurice Papon and [[René Bousquet]] – escaped justice by claiming to have worked secretly for the resistance or to have played a double game, working for the good of France by serving the established order.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;

Later, there was the question of what to do with the former Vichy leaders when they were finally returned to France. Marshal Pétain and [[Maxime Weygand]] were war heroes from World War I and were now extremely old; convicted of treason, Pétain received a death sentence which his old protégé de Gaulle commuted to life imprisonment, while Weygand was eventually acquitted. In all, three Vichy leaders were executed; [[Joseph Darnand]], who became an SS officer and led the Milice paramilitaries who hunted down members of the Resistance, was executed in October 1945, while [[Fernand de Brinon]], the third ranking Vichy official was found guilty of war crimes and executed in April 1947. The two trials of the most infamous collaborator of all, [[Pierre Laval]], who was heavily implicated in the murder of Jews were widely criticised as being unfair for depriving him of the opportunity to properly defend himself, although Laval antagonised the court throughout with his bizarre behaviour. He was found guilty of treason in May 1945 and de Gaulle was adamant that there would be no commuting the death sentence, saying that Laval’s execution was &quot;an indispenable symbolic gesture required for reasons of state&quot;. There was a widespread belief, particularly in the years that followed, that de Gaulle was trying to appease both the Third Republic politicians and the former Vichy leaders who had made Laval their scapegoat.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;

===Winter of 1944===
The winter of 1944-45 was a miserable time.  Inflation showed no sign of slowing down and the lives of ordinary people were still blighted by severe shortages.  The Prime Minister and the other Gaullists were forced to try to balance the desires of ordinary people and public servants for a return to normal life with pressure from Bidault’s MRP and the Communists for the large scale nationalisation programme and other social changes that formed the main tenets of the CNR Charter.  At end of 1944 the coal industry and other energy companies were nationalised, followed shortly afterwards by major banks and finance houses, the merchant navy, the main aircraft manufacturers, airlines and a number of major private enterprises such as the [[Renault]] car company at [[Boulogne-Billancourt]], whose owner had been implicated as a collaborator and accused of having made huge profits working for the Nazis.&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;  In some cases unions, feeling that things were not progressing quickly enough took matters into their own hands, occupying premises and setting up workers committees to run the companies.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; Women were also allowed the vote for the first time, a new social security system was introduced to cover most medical costs, unions were expanded and price controls introduced to try to curb inflation.  At de Gaulle’s request, the newspaper ''[[Le Monde]]'' was founded in December 1944 to provide France with a quality daily journal similar to those in other countries.  ''Le Monde'' took over the premises and facilities of the older ''[[Le Temps (Paris)|Le Temps]]'', whose independence and reputation had been badly compromised during the Vichy years.&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;

During this period there were a number of minor disagreements between the French and the other Allies. The British Ambassador to France [[Duff Cooper, 1st Viscount Norwich|Duff Cooper]] said that during this time de Gaulle seemed to seek out real or imagined insults to take offence at wherever possible.&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;  De Gaulle believed that Britain and America were intending to keep their armies in France after the war and were secretly working to take over her overseas possessions and to prevent her from regaining her political and economic strength.  In late October he complained that the Allies were failing to adequately arm and equip the new French army and instructed Bidault to use the French veto at the European Council.&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;

On Armistice Day in 1944, Winston Churchill made his first visit to France since the liberation and received a good reception in Paris where he laid a wreath to [[Georges Clemenceau|Clemenceau]].  The occasion also marked the first official appearance of de Gaulle’s wife Yvonne, but the visit was less friendly than it appeared.  De Gaulle had given strict instructions that there should be no excessive displays of public affection towards Churchill and no official awards without his prior agreement.  When crowds cheered Churchill during a parade down the Elysee, de Gaulle was heard to remark, &quot;Fools and cretins! Look at the rabble cheering the old bandit&quot;.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;

===Visit to USSR===
With the Russian forces making more rapid advances into German held territory than the Allies, there was a sudden public realisation that the Soviet Union was about to dominate large parts of Eastern Europe.  In fact, at the [[Cairo Conference (1943)|Cairo]] and [[Tehran Conference]]s in 1943 Britain and America had already agreed to allow Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary to fall under the Russian sphere of influence after the war, with shared influence in Yugoslavia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robottom&quot;&gt;Modern Russia. John Robottom (1972)&lt;/ref&gt;  Britain was to retain  hegemony over Greece, although there had been no agreement over Poland, whose eastern territories were already in Russian hands under the [[Brest-Litovsk]] agreement with Germany, and which retained a government in exile in London.&lt;ref name=Robottom /&gt;  De Gaulle had not been invited to any of the ‘[[Allies of World War II|Big Three]]’ Conferences, although the decisions made by Stalin, Churchill and Roosevelt in dividing up Europe were of huge importance to France.

By now it was clear that although for the time being they remained allies, in the coming years the western capitalist democracies would increasingly clash with the Communist ideology.  De Gaulle and his Foreign Minister Bidault stated that they were not in favour of a ‘Western Bloc’ that would be separate from the rest of Europe, and hoped that a resurgent France might be able to act as a ‘third force’ in Europe to temper the ambitions of the two emerging superpowers, America and Russia.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;  He began seeking an audience with Stalin to press his ‘facing both ways’ policy, and finally received an invitation in late 1944.  In his Memoirs, de Gaulle devoted 24 pages to his visit to Russia, but a number of writers make the point that his version of events differs significantly from that of the Russians, of foreign news correspondents, and with their own eye witness accounts.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;

De Gaulle wanted access to German coal in the [[Ruhr]], the left bank of the Rhine to be incorporated into French territory, and for the [[Oder-Neisse line]] in Poland to become Germany's official Eastern border.  De Gaulle began by requesting that France enter into a treaty with the Soviet Union on this basis, but Stalin, who remained in contact with Churchill throughout the visit, said that it would be impossible to make such an agreement without the consent of Britain and America. But he suggested that it might possible to add France’s name to the existing [[Anglo-Soviet Agreement]] if they agreed to recognise the Soviet-backed provisional Polish government known as the [[Lublin Committee]] as rightful rulers of Poland.  De Gaulle responded that this would be ‘un-French’, as it would mean her being a junior partner in an alliance.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;

During the visit, de Gaulle accompanied the deputy Russian leader [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] on a visit to the [[Stalingrad]] battleground where he was deeply moved by the scene of carnage he witnessed and surprised Molotov by referring to &quot;our joint sacrifice&quot;.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;

The treaty which was eventually signed by Bidault and Molotov was of little relevance to Stalin because of France’s lack of political and military power, and it did not affect the outcome of the post-war settlement, but it carried a symbolic importance in that it enabled de Gaulle to demonstrate that he was representing France as official head of state and that France’s voice was being heard.  However, Stalin later commented that he found Gaulle awkward and stubborn, that he lacked realism by claiming the same rights as the great powers and believed that he was ‘not a complicated person’&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;  He also did not object to Roosevelt's refusal to allow de Gaulle to attend the Big Three conferences that were to come at Yalta and Potsdam.

===Strasbourg===
At the end of 1944 French forces continued to advance as part of the American armies, but during the [[Ardennes Offensive]] there was a dispute over Eisenhower’s order to French troops to evacuate [[Strasbourg]], which had just been liberated so as to straighten the defensive line against the German counterattack.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;  Strasbourg was an important political and psychological symbol of French sovereignty in [[Alsace and Lorraine]], and de Gaulle, saying that its loss would bring down the government, refused to allow a retreat, predicting that &quot;Strasbourg will be our Stalingrad&quot;.&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;  At a cabinet meeting he said that the French should be willing to die there alone if the US pulled out its own troops.  Churchill backed the French, and Eisenhower was so impressed with the French resolve that he eventually left his own troops in the city even at the risk of being cut off, for which de Gaulle expressed his extreme gratitude.

By early 1945 it was clear that the price controls which had been introduced to control inflation had only served to boost the black market and prices continued to move ever upwards. By this time the army had swelled to over 1.2 million men and almost half of state expenditure was going to military spending.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;  De Gaulle was faced with his first major ministerial dispute when the very able but tough minded economics minister [[Pierre Mendes-France]] demanded a programme of severe monetary reform which was opposed by the Finance Ministry headed by [[Aimé Lepercq|Aime Lepercq]], who favoured a programme of heavy borrowing to stimulate the economy.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;  When de Gaulle, knowing there would be little appetite for further austerity measures sided with Lepercq, Mendes-France tendered his resignation, which was rejected because de Gaule knew he needed him.  Lepercq was killed in a road accident a short time afterwards and was succeeded by Pleven, but when in March, Mendes-France asked unsuccessfully for taxes on capital earnings and for the blocking of certain bank accounts, he again offered his resignation and it was accepted.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;

===The Yalta Conference===
After the Rhine crossings, the French First Army captured a large section of territory in southern Germany, but although this later allowed France to play a part in the signing of the German surrender, Roosevelt in particular refused to allow any discussion about de Gaulle participating in the Big Three conferences that would shape Europe in the post war world.&lt;ref name=Robottom /&gt;  Because the Americans were planning to bring their troops home from Europe soon after the war was over, Churchill, who shared many of de Gaulle’s concerns over the inexperience of Russia and America in world affairs, realised the need for French troops to help administer Germany and pressed very hard for France to be included ‘at the inter-allied table’, but on 6 December 1944 the American president wired both Stalin and Churchill to say that de Gaulle’s presence would &quot;merely introduce a complicating and undesirable factor&quot;.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;

At the [[Yalta Conference]] in February 1945, Churchill and Roosevelt agreed that Poland should be ruled by the [[Lublin Committee]] and that she should give Russia her eastern lands in return for German territory.  It was also agreed that Germany should be disarmed and occupied after the war, that [[war criminals]] would be brought to justice and that Russia would enter the war against Japan, from whom she would detach certain disputed territories.&lt;ref name=Robottom /&gt;

Despite Stalin’s opposition though, Churchill and Roosevelt insisted that France be allowed a post-war occupation zone in Germany, and also made sure that she was included among the five nations that invited others to the conference to establish the [[United Nations]].&lt;ref name=Robottom /&gt;  This was important because it guaranteed France a permanent seat on the [[UN Security Council]], a prestigious position that despite pressure from emerging nations she still holds today.  Although Churchill had tried to have him involved and went to great lengths to fight for French interests during Yalta, assistance he never acknowledged, de Gaulle never forgave the Big Three leaders for not inviting him to the summit and continued to rage against it as having been a negative factor in European politics for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;

===President Truman===
On his way back from Yalta, Roosevelt asked de Gaulle to meet him in Algiers for talks. The General refused, believing that there was nothing more to be said, and for this he received a rebuke from [[Georges Bidault]] and from the French press, and a severely angered Roosevelt criticised de Gaulle in the [[United States Congress]].  Soon after, on 12 April 1945, Roosevelt died, and despite their uneasy relationship de Gaulle declared a week of mourning in France and forwarded an emotional and conciliatory letter to the new American President [[Harry S. Truman]], in which he said of Roosevelt, &quot;all of France loved him&quot;.&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;

Unfortunately, de Gaulle’s relationship with Truman was to prove just as difficult as it had been with Roosevelt. With Allied forces advancing deep into Germany, another serious situation developed between American and French forces in [[Stuttgart]] and [[Karlsruhe]], when French soldiers were ordered  to transfer the occupation zones to US troops. Wishing to retain as much German territory in French hands as possible, de Gaulle ordered his troops, who were using American weapons and ammunition, to resist, and an armed confrontation seemed imminent.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; Truman threatened to cut off supplies to the French Army and to take the zones by force, leaving  De Gaulle with little choice but to back down. De Gaulle never forgave the new President, while Truman told his staff simply, &quot;I don’t like the son of a bitch.&quot;&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;

The first visit by de Gaulle to Truman in America was not a success.  Truman told his visitor that it was time that the French got rid of the Communist influence from her government, to which de Gaulle replied that this was France’s own business.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt; But Truman, who admitted that his feelings towards the French were becoming ‘less and less friendly’, went on to say that under the circumstances, the French could not expect much economic aid and refused to accept de Gaulle’s request for control of the West bank of the Rhine.  During the argument which followed, de Gaulle reminded Truman that the US was using the French island of [[Noumea]] in [[New Caledonia]] as a base against the Japanese.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;

===Victory in Europe===
When, in May 1945 the German armies surrendered to the Americans and British at Rheims, a separate armistice was signed with France in Berlin.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; De Gaulle refused to allow any British participation in the victory parade in Paris. However, among the vehicles that took part was an ambulance from the [[Hadfield-Spears Ambulance Unit]], staffed by French Doctors and British nurses. One of the nurses was Mary Spears, who had set up the unit and had worked almost continuously since the [[Battle of France]] with Free French forces in the Middle East, North Africa and Italy. Mary’s husband was General [[Edward Spears]], the British liaison to the Free French who had personally spirited de Gaulle to safety in Britain in 1940. When de Gaulle saw the [[Union Flag|Union flags]] and [[Flag of France|Tricolours]] side by side on the ambulance, and heard French soldiers cheering, &quot;Voilà Spears! Vive Spears!&quot; he ordered that the unit be closed down immediately and its British staff sent home. A number of French troops returned their medals in protest and Mary wrote, &quot;it is a pitiful business when a great man suddenly becomes small.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Day the War Ended. London. Martin Gilbert (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another confrontation with the Americans broke out soon after the armistice when the French sent troops to occupy the French-speaking Italian border region of [[Val d'Aoste]]. The French commander threatened to open fire on American troops if they tried to stop them, and an irate Truman ordered the immediate end to all arms shipments to France, and sent de Gaulle an angry letter saying that he found it unbelievable that the French could threaten to attack American troops after they had done so much to liberate France.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;

===Confrontation in the Levant===
On [[VE Day]], there were also serious riots in French [[Tunisia]], while soon after there came a dispute with Britain over [[Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] which quickly developed into a major diplomatic incident. The two Arabian countries, occupying a region known as the [[Levant]], had been ruled under a French mandate given by the [[League of Nations]] at the end of World War I, but for several months both countries had seen demonstrations against the French.&lt;ref name=&quot;PurnellHistory&quot;&gt;Purnell’s History of the Second World War: No. 119 (1966). France’s Retreat from Empire by Philippe Masson&lt;/ref&gt; Bidault told reporters that France intended to defend her economic and cultural rights in Syria and Lebanon, and that there would be &quot;no problem, as long as the British do not interfere&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''TIME'', 11 June 1945&lt;/ref&gt; In May, de Gaulle sent General Beynet to establish an air base in Syria and a naval base in the Lebanon, provoking an outbreak of nationalism in which some French nationals were attacked and killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;PurnellHistory&quot; /&gt;

On 20 May, French troops opened fire on demonstrators in [[Damascus]] with artillery and mortars while aircraft dropped bombs. Later, colonial Senegalese troops were sent in with machine guns and after several days hundreds of Syrians lay dead in the bazaars and narrow streets of the capital, with reports of looting by the attacking forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Magazine. 25 June 1945&quot;&gt;''TIME'' magazine, 25 June 1945&lt;/ref&gt; The British, who had substantial forces in the region, said that they would be forced to intervene if the violence did not stop. They were backed by President Truman, who declared &quot;those French ought to be taken out and castrated&quot;.&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;

Following the visit to Paris the previous year, and in spite of his efforts to preserve French interests at Yalta, Churchill’s relationship with de Gaulle was now at rock bottom. In January he told a colleague that he believed that de Gaulle was &quot;a great danger to peace and for Great Britain. After five years of experience, I am convinced that he is the worst enemy of France in her troubles… he is one of the greatest dangers to European peace.… I am sure that in the long run no understanding will be reached with General de Gaulle&quot;.&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;

Finally, on 31 May, with the death toll exceeding a thousand Syrians,&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt; Churchill sent de Gaulle a message saying; &quot;In order to avoid a collision between British and French forces, we request you immediately to order French troops to cease fire and withdraw to their barracks&quot;. Meanwhile the British, under General [[Bernard Paget]] moved in with troops and tanks and cut French General Oliva Roget's telephone line with his base at [[Beirut]]. Paget ordered Roget to tell his men to cease fire, but the Frenchman said that he would not take orders from the British.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Magazine. 25 June 1945&quot;/&gt; Eventually, heavily outnumbered, Roget ordered his men back to their base near the coast, angry that the British had arrived only after he had &quot;restored order&quot;. He told a Syrian journalist: &quot;You are replacing the easygoing French with the brutal British&quot;. But that night, with the Syrians killing any French or Senegalese troops they could find, the French were forced to accept the British escort back to the safety of their barracks. Later, Roget was sacked, but a furious row broke out between Britain and France.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Magazine. 25 June 1945&quot;/&gt;

In France, there were accusations that Britain had armed the demonstrators.&lt;ref name=&quot;PurnellHistory&quot; /&gt; De Gaulle raged against ‘Churchill’s ultimatum’, saying that &quot;the whole thing stank of oil&quot;.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; He summoned Duff Cooper and told him; &quot;I recognise that we are not in a position to wage war against you, but you have betrayed France and betrayed the West. That cannot be forgotten&quot;.&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;

France was isolated and suffering a diplomatic crisis. The secretary of the [[Arab League]] [[Edward Atiyah]] said; &quot;France put all her cards and two rusty pistols on the table&quot;. In turn, the French press attacked Britain as an enemy of France and accused the U.S. of helping Italy and Germany more than it helped France. It also criticised the Russians when they made it clear that they believed that France was in the wrong.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time Magazine. 25 June 1945&quot;/&gt;

===The Potsdam Conference===
During the [[Potsdam Conference]] in July, to which de Gaulle was again not invited, Churchill was defeated at the British general election and replaced by the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] leader [[Clement Attlee]]. The Potsdam Conference brought a decision to divide Vietnam, which had been a French colony for over a hundred years, into British and Chinese spheres of influence.&lt;ref name=Robottom /&gt; Soon after the surrender of Japan in August 1945, de Gaulle sent the [[French Far East Expeditionary Corps]] to re-establish French sovereignty in [[French Indochina]], making [[Georges Thierry d'Argenlieu|Admiral d'Argenlieu]] High Commissioner and [[Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque|General Leclerc]] commander-in-chief and commander of the expeditionary corps.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indochina&quot;&gt;Anthony Clayton, ''Three Marshals of France.'' p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; However, the resistance leaders in Indo-China proclaimed the freedom and independence of Vietnam.&lt;ref name=&quot;PurnellHistory&quot; /&gt;

==New elections and resignation==
Since the liberation, the only parliament in France had been an enlarged version of the Algiers Consultative Assembly, and at last, in October 1945, elections were held for a new Constituent Assembly whose main task was to provide a new constitution for the Fourth Republic. De Gaulle favoured a strong executive for the nation,{{r|time19590105}} but all three of the main parties wished to severely restrict the powers of the President. The Communists wanted an assembly with full constitutional powers and no time limit, whereas de Gaulle, the Socialists and the [[Popular Republican Movement]] (MRP) advocated one with a term limited to only seven months, after which the draft constitution would be submitted for another referendum.

In the election, which was run on the basis of proportional representation, the second option was approved by 13 million of the 21 million voters. The big three parties won 75% of the vote, with the Communists winning 158 seats, the MRP 152 seats, the Socialists 142 seats and the remaining seats going to the various far right parties.

On 13 November 1945, the new assembly unanimously elected Charles de Gaulle head of the government, but problems immediately arose when it came to selecting the cabinet, due to his unwillingness once more to allow the Communists any important ministries. The Communists, now the largest party and with their charismatic leader Maurice Thorez back at the helm, were not prepared to accept this for a second time, and a furious row ensued, during which de Gaulle sent a letter of resignation to the speaker of the Assembly and declared that he was unwilling to trust a party that he considered to be an agent of a foreign power (Russia) with authority over the police and armed forces of France.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;

Eventually, the new cabinet was finalised on 21 November, with the Communists receiving five out of the twenty two ministries, and although they still did not get any of the key portfolios, Thorez did manage to obtain one of the four prestigious Ministry of State posts.

De Gaulle found working under the new Constituent Assembly very different to the old Provisional Government, which ruled by decree. He found dealing with the &quot;regime of parties&quot; frustrating and believed that the draft constitution placed too much power in the hands of parliament with its shifting party alliances. One of his ministers described him as &quot;a man equally incapable of monopolizing power as of sharing it&quot;.

De Gaulle outlined a programme of further nationalisations and a new economic plan which were passed, but a further row came when the Communists demanded a 20% reduction in the military budget. Refusing to ‘rule by compromise', de Gaulle once more threatened to resign. There was a general feeling that he was trying to blackmail the assembly into complete subservience by threatening to withdraw his personal prestige which he insisted was what alone kept the ruling coalition together.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt; Although the MRP managed to broker a compromise which saw the budget approved with amendments, it was little more than a stop-gap measure.&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;

Barely two months after forming the new government, de Gaulle abruptly resigned on 20 January 1946. The move was called &quot;a bold and ultimately foolish political ploy&quot;, with de Gaulle hoping that as a war hero, he would be soon brought back as a more powerful executive by the French people.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, that did not turn out to be the case. With the war finally over, the initial period of crisis had passed.  Although there were still shortages, particularly of bread, France was now on the road to recovery, and de Gaulle suddenly did not seem so indispensable.  The Communist publication Combat wrote; &quot;There was no cataclym, and the empty plate didn’t crack&quot;.&lt;ref name=Werth /&gt;

He was succeeded by [[Félix Gouin]] ([[French Section of the Workers' International]], SFIO), then [[Georges Bidault]] (MRP) and finally [[Léon Blum]] (SFIO).&lt;ref&gt;

==1946–58: Out of power==
[[File:Charles de Gaulle Quotation 2011.jpg|thumb|The statement of Charles de Gaulle in reference to World War II]]

After monopolizing French politics for six years, Charles de Gaulle suddenly dropped out of sight, and returned to his home at [[Colombey-les-Deux-Eglises]] to write his war memoirs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grolier&quot;/&gt;

The famous opening paragraph of ''Mémoires de guerre'' begins by declaring, &quot;All my life, I have had a certain idea of France (une certaine idée de la France)&quot;, comparing his country to an old painting of a Madonna, and ends by declaring that, given the divisive nature of French politics, France cannot truly live up to this ideal without a policy of &quot;grandeur&quot; (roughly &quot;greatness&quot;). During this period of formal retirement, however, de Gaulle maintained regular contact with past political lieutenants from wartime and ''RPF'' days, including sympathizers involved in political developments in [[French Algeria]], becoming &quot;perhaps the best-informed man in France&quot;.{{r|time19590105}}

In April 1947 de Gaulle made a renewed attempt to transform the political scene by creating a ''[[Rassemblement du Peuple Français]]'' (Rally of the French People, or ''RPF''), which he hoped would be able to move above the familiar party squabbles of the parliamentary system. Despite the new party's taking 40% of vote in local elections and 121 seats in 1951, lacking its own press and access to television, its support ebbed away. In May 1953, he withdrew again from active politics,{{r|time19590105}} though the ''RPF'' lingered until September 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grolier&quot;/&gt;

As with a number of other European countries during this period, France began to suffer the loss of its overseas possessions amid the surge of nationalism which came in the aftermath of WW2. [[Indochina]] (now [[Vietnam]], [[Laos]] and [[Cambodia]]), colonised by France during the mid nineteenth century, had been lost to the Japanese after the defeat of 1940. Although de Gaulle had moved quickly to reclaim the territory during his brief tenure as president, the communist [[Vietminh]] under [[Ho Chi Minh]] began a determined campaign for independence from 1946 onwards.  The French fought a bitter 7 ½ year war (the [[First Indochina War]]) to hold onto Indochina until their decisive defeat after the siege of [[Dien Bien Phu]] in May 1954

With more than 70,000 French soldiers killed during the conflict, [[Pierre Mendes-France]] was made Prime Minister with the main objective of ending the war, and by July 1954 a ceasefire had been arranged, following which French Forces left and the country was partitioned into [[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]]. This was only a short interlude before the even more savage Second Indochina War, more widely known in the west as the [[Vietnam War]], in which America, not France, was the main antagonist.&lt;ref&gt;Purnell’s History of the Second World War no. 119. 1966 / 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

The defeat in Indochina had a profound influence on France’s North African empire and severely stretched the credibility of the Fourth Republic. By 1956, Morocco and Tunisia had all but won their independence, while in Algeria, some 350,000 French troops were fighting 150,000 members of the Algerian Liberation Movement (FLN), a conflict which was to become increasingly savage and bloody over the next few years, and threaten mainland France itself.

Between 1946 and 1958 there were no less than 24 separate ministries. The president retained relatively little real executive power, and manœuvrings among various radical and socialist groups in the Assembly led to the government being repeatedly overthrown. Governments were so short lived that they achieved little, and the politics of the 4th Republic began to show the same characteristics as the 3rd Republic. Endlessly frustrated by the divisiveness of the Fourth Republic, de Gaulle famously asked; how can you govern a country which has 246 varieties of cheese?&lt;ref&gt;TIME Magazine- 16 March 1962&lt;/ref&gt;

The public showed their frustration with a marked shift of support towards the extreme right, particularly the [[Poujadist]]s, a far right party who championed the cause of shopkeepers, farmers and other small businesses who were concerned at increased taxes and price controls brought in to try to curb inflation. Led by [[Pierre Poujade]], the party were anti-Semitic, anti-American and imperialist,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;Modern European History: K. Perry. WH Allen 1976&lt;/ref&gt; but won 2.6 million votes in 1956, giving them 52 seats.

==1958: Collapse of the Fourth Republic==
{{Further|May 1958 crisis}}
The [[French Fourth Republic|Fourth Republic]] was tainted by political instability, failures in [[French Indochina|Indochina]] and inability to resolve the [[Algerian War of Independence|Algerian question]]. It did, however, pass the 1956 ''loi-cadre Deferre'' which granted independence to [[Tunisia]] and [[Morocco]], while the Premier [[Pierre Mendès-France]] put an end to the Indochina War through the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] of 1954.&lt;ref&gt;

Under [[Guy Mollet]], while he survived the 1956 [[Suez Crisis]], French prestige suffered a humiliating defeat with the forced withdrawal from [[Egypt]] under international pressure.

On 13 May 1958, settlers seized the government buildings in Algiers, attacking what they saw as French government weakness in the face of demands among the Arab majority for Algerian independence. A &quot;Committee of Civil and Army Public Security&quot; was created under the presidency of General [[Jacques Massu]], a Gaullist sympathiser. General [[Raoul Salan]], Commander-in-Chief in Algeria, announced on radio that he was assuming provisional power, and appealed for &quot;confidence in the Army and its leaders&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Generals in Algiers revolt against Paris – Demand for &quot;Government of Public Safety&quot;|newspaper=The Times|date=14 May 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the pressure of Massu, Salan declared ''Vive de Gaulle!'' from the balcony of the Algiers Government-General building on 15 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Vive De Gaulle – General Salan's Public Utterance|newspaper=The Times|date=16 May 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle answered two days later that he was ready to &quot;assume the powers of the Republic&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=General de Gaulle's Bid for Authority – Ready to Assume Powers of Rebublic|newspaper=The Times|date=16 May 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many worried as they saw this answer as support for the army.

At a 19 May press conference, de Gaulle asserted again that he was at the disposal of the country. As a journalist expressed the concerns of some who feared that he would violate civil liberties, de Gaulle retorted vehemently:

{{quote|Have I ever done that? On the contrary, I have re-established them when they had disappeared. Who honestly believes that, at age 67, I would start a career as a dictator?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Party System has Failed State and People – General de Gaulle Explains his Views|newspaper=The Times|date=20&amp;nbsp;May 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;}}

A constitutionalist by conviction, he maintained throughout the crisis that he would accept power only from the lawfully constituted authorities. De Gaulle did not wish to repeat the difficulty the Free French movement experienced in establishing legitimacy as the rightful government. He told an aide that the rebel generals &quot;will not find De Gaulle in their baggage&quot;.{{r|time19590105}}

The crisis deepened as French paratroops from Algeria seized [[Corsica]] and a landing near Paris was discussed ([[Operation Resurrection]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=General Massu – Obituary|newspaper=The Times|date=29 October 2002|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/obituaries/article818845.ece|location=London|accessdate=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political leaders on many sides agreed to support the General's return to power, except [[François Mitterrand]], [[Pierre Mendès-France]], [[Alain Savary]], the [[Communist Party (France)|Communist Party]], and certain other leftists. On 29 May the French President, [[René Coty]], appealed to the &quot;most illustrious of Frenchmen&quot; to confer with him and to examine what was immediately necessary for the creation of a government of national safety, and what could be done to bring about a profound reform of the country's institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=President Coty speaks of Crumbling Republic|newspaper=The Times|date=30 May 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle remained intent on replacing the constitution of the Fourth Republic, which he blamed for France's political weakness. He set as conditions for his return that he be given wide emergency powers for six months and that a new constitution be proposed to the [[French people]].&lt;ref&gt;As he commissioned the [[Constitution of France|new constitution]] and was responsible for its overall framework, de Gaulle is sometimes described as the author of the constitution. De Gaulle's political ideas were written into a constitution by [[Michel Debré]] who then guided the text through the enactment process. Thus while the constitution reflects de Gaulle's ideas, Michel Debré was the actual author of the text.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June 1958, de Gaulle became Premier and was given emergency powers for six months by the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Gen de Gaulle given a majority of 105 – Full powers demanded for six months|newspaper=The Times|date=2 June 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt; fulfilling his desire for parliamentary legitimacy.{{r|time19590105}}

On 28 September 1958, a [[French constitutional referendum, 1958|referendum]] took place and 79.2 percent of those who voted supported the new constitution and the creation of the [[French Fifth Republic|Fifth Republic]]. The [[French Colonial Empire|colonies]] (Algeria was officially a part of France, not a colony) were given the choice between immediate [[independence]] and the new constitution. All African colonies voted for the new constitution and the replacement of the [[French Union]] by the [[French Community]], except [[Guinea]], which thus became the first French African colony to gain independence, at the cost of the immediate ending of all French assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sweeping Vote for General de Gaulle – 4:1 Majority says &quot;Yes&quot; to new Constitution|newspaper=The Times|date=29 September 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to de Gaulle, the head of state should represent &quot;the spirit of the nation&quot; to the nation itself and to the world: &quot;''une certaine idée de la France''&quot; (a certain idea of France).&lt;ref&gt;The citation in French is taken from [http://www.de-gaulle-edu.net/sentrainer/trois_commt/certaineidee.htm Charles de Gaulle, Mémoires de guerre, tome 1, Plon, 1954]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1958–62: Founding of the Fifth Republic==

In the [[French legislative election, 1958|November 1958 elections]], de Gaulle and his supporters (initially organised in the ''Union pour la Nouvelle République-Union Démocratique du Travail'', then the ''Union des Démocrates pour la Vème République'', and later still the ''[[Union des Démocrates pour la République]]'', UDR) won a comfortable majority. In December, de Gaulle was [[French presidential election, 1958|elected President by the electoral college]] with 78% of the vote, and inaugurated in January 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Landslide Vote Repeated for de Gaulle – President of Fifth Republic – Sweeping Powers|newspaper=The Times|date=22 December 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He oversaw tough economic measures to revitalise the country, including the issuing of a new [[franc]] (worth 100 old francs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=New Year Brings in New Franc|newspaper=The Times|date=2 January 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, he rebuffed both the United States and the [[Soviet Union]], pushing for an independent France with its own [[nuclear weapon]]s, and strongly encouraged a &quot;Free Europe&quot;, believing that a confederation of all European nations would restore the past glories of the great European empires.&lt;ref&gt;Crawley p.411, p.428&lt;/ref&gt;

He set about building [[Franco-German cooperation]] as the cornerstone of the [[European Community|European Economic Community]] (EEC), paying the first [[state visit]] to [[West Germany|Germany]] by a French head of state since [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Germans Give General de Gaulle a Hero's Welcome|newspaper=The Times|date=6 September 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1963, Germany and France signed a treaty of friendship, the [[Élysée Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;Crawley p.422&lt;/ref&gt; France also reduced its dollar reserves, trading them for gold from the U.S. government, thereby reducing the US' economic influence abroad.&lt;ref&gt;Crawley p.439&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 November 1959, in a speech in [[Strasbourg]], de Gaulle announced his vision for Europe:
{{quote|Oui, c’est l’Europe, depuis l’Atlantique jusqu’à l’Oural, c’est toute l’Europe, qui décidera du destin du monde.

''(&quot;Yes, it is Europe, from the [[Atlantic]] to the [[Urals]], it is the whole of Europe, that will decide the destiny of the world.&quot;)''}}
His expression, &quot;Europe, from the Atlantic to the Urals&quot;, has often been cited throughout the history of [[European integration]]. It became, for the next ten years, a favourite political rallying cry of de Gaulle's. His vision stood in contrast to the [[Atlanticism]] of the United States and Britain, preferring instead a Europe that would act as a third [[polarity (power)|pole]] between the United States and the Soviet Union. By including in his ideal of Europe all the territory up to the Urals, de Gaulle was implicitly offering [[détente]] to the [[Soviets]].

===Algeria===
Upon becoming president, de Gaulle was faced with the urgent task of finding a way to bring to an end the bloody and divisive war in Algeria. His intentions were obscure. He had immediately visited Algeria and declared, ''Je vous ai compris'' - 'I have understood you', and each competing interest had wished to believe it was them that he had understood. Whatever his intentions, &quot;he soon came to realize that Algerian independence was inevitable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Other Empire'', BBC Radio Three, episode 5/5, first broadcast 16 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; French left-wingers were in favour of granting independence to Algeria and urged him to seek a way to achieve peace while, at the same time, avoiding a French loss of face.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.eb.co.uk/eb/article-2620 Gaulle, Charles de. (2009)] In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved 8 July 2009, from Encyclopædia Britannica Online Library Edition:&lt;/ref&gt; Although the military's near-coup had contributed to his return to power, de Gaulle soon ordered all officers to quit the rebellious Committees of Public Safety. Such actions greatly angered the [[pieds-noirs|French settlers]] and their military supporters.{{r|time19590105}}

He was forced to suppress two uprisings in Algeria by French settlers and troops, in the second of which (the [[Generals' Putsch]] in April 1961) France herself was again threatened with invasion by rebel paratroops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Rebels Plot to Seize Power in Paris – Sirens to Warn Citizens of Algeria Parachutists – General De Gaulle Assumes Dictatorial Powers|newspaper=The Times|date=24 April 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle's government also covered up the [[Paris massacre of 1961]], issued under the orders of the police prefect [[Maurice Papon]], who had begun his career as a [[Vichy France|Vichy]] functionary deporting Jews from south-west France.&lt;ref&gt;[[Julian T. Jackson]], ''The Other Empire'' BBC Radio Three, epiode 5/5, first broadcast, 16 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He was also targeted by the settlers' resistance group [[Organisation de l'armée secrète]] (OAS) and several assassination attempts were made on him; the most famous is that of 22 August 1962, when he and his wife narrowly escaped an assassination attempt when their [[Citroën DS]] was targeted by [[machine gun]] fire arranged by Colonel [[Jean-Marie Bastien-Thiry]] at [[Clamart|Petit-Clamart]].&lt;ref&gt;Crawley p.381&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors to the French capital around this time heard, &quot;the eerie sounds of car horns, beating out the five count of ''Al-gé-rie-Fran-çaise''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''The Other Empire'', episode 5/5, BBC Radio Three, first broadcast 16 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

After a [[French referendum on Algerian self-determination, 1961|referendum on Algerian self-determination]] carried out in 1961, de Gaulle arranged a cease-fire in Algeria with the March 1962 [[Evian Accords]], legitimated by another [[French Évian Accords referendum, 1962|referendum]] a month later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Vote Of Confidence In General De Gaulle – Conclusive Referendum Verdict On Algeria Peace|newspaper=The Times|date=9 April 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Algerian issue was settled, Prime Minister Michel Debré resigned over the final settlement and was replaced with Georges Pompidou on 14 April 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=M. Pompidou Takes Over from M. Debre – Few Changes in New Cabinet |newspaper=The Times|date=16 April 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt; France recognised Algerian independence on 3 July 1962, while an amnesty was belatedly issued covering all crimes committed during the war, including the genocide against the [[Harkis]]. In just a few months in 1962, 900,000 French [[Pieds-Noirs|settlers]] left the country. After 5 July, the exodus accelerated in the wake of the French deaths during the [[Oran massacre of 1962]]. Historian [[Julian T. Jackson|Julian Jackson]] : &quot;The Pieds-Noirs peddled a fantasy of a harmonious country of Muslims and Europeans, but the history of the French in Algeria had ''always'' been one of violence, expropriation and exploitation. After the terrorist organisation OAS adopted a kind of ''scorched earth'' policy toward the end, it was made certain the [[Pieds-Noirs]] could not stay on in Algeria - [there followed] an influx of a million embittered and dispossessed refugees into France - where they now formed a reservoir of passionate, right-wing, anti-Gaullism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Julian Jackson, ''The Other Empire'', BBC Radio 3, episode 5/5, first broadcast 16 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct presidential elections===
In September 1962, de Gaulle sought a constitutional amendment to allow the president to be directly elected by the people and issued another [[French presidential election referendum, 1962|referendum to this end]]. After a [[motion of censure]] voted by the Parliament on 4 October 1962, de Gaulle dissolved the National Assembly and held [[French legislative election, 1962|new elections]]. Although the left progressed, the Gaullists won an increased majority—this despite opposition from the Christian democratic [[Popular Republican Movement]] (MRP) and the [[National Centre of Independents and Peasants]] (CNIP) who criticised de Gaulle's [[euroscepticism]] and [[presidentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=De Gaulle Challenge to Parliament – To Retire if Referendum not Approved – Call to Nation before Debate on Censure Motion|newspaper=The Times|date=5 October 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=De Gaulle against the Politicians – Clear Issue for October Referendum – Assembly Election Likely after Solid Censure Vote|newspaper=The Times|date=6 October 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle's proposal to change the election procedure for the French presidency was approved at the referendum on 28 October 1962 by more than three-fifths of voters despite a broad &quot;coalition of no&quot; formed by most of the parties, opposed to a presidential regime. Thereafter the President was to be elected by direct universal suffrage for the first time since Louis Napoleon in 1848.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=&quot;Yes&quot; Reply for Gen.

==1962–68: Politics of grandeur==
With the Algerian conflict behind him, de Gaulle was able to achieve his two main objectives: to reform and develop the French economy, and to promote an independent foreign policy and a strong stance on the international stage. This was named by foreign observers the &quot;politics of grandeur&quot; (''politique de grandeur'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolodziej&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Kolodziej|first= Edward A|title=French International Policy under de Gaulle and Pompidou: The Politics of Grandeur|year=1974|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=New Haven, Conn|isbn=0-300-10980-6|page=618}}&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Gaullism]].

===&quot;Thirty glorious years&quot;===
In the immediate post war years France was in a bad way;&lt;ref&gt;Purnell’s History of the Second World War: No. 123 1966. By Kenneth Macksey&lt;/ref&gt; wages remained at around half prewar levels, the winter of 1946-1947 did extensive damage to crops - leading to a reduction in the bread ration, hunger and disease remained rife and the black market continued to flourish. Germany was in an even worse position but after 1948 things began to improve dramatically with the introduction of [[Marshall Aid]] - large scale American financial assistance given to help rebuild European economies and infrastructure. This laid the foundations of a meticulously planned programme of investment in energy, transport and heavy industry, overseen by the government of prime minister [[Georges Pompidou]].

In the context of a population boom unseen in France since the 18th century, the government intervened heavily in the economy, using ''[[dirigisme]]'' — a unique combination of capitalism and state-directed economy — with indicative five-year plans as its main tool. This brought about a rapid transformation and expansion of the French economy.

[[File:Fpdegaulle.jpg|thumb|upright|Iranian Empress [[Farah Pahlavi]] meeting with Charles de Gaulle in France, 1961]]
High-profile projects, mostly but not always financially successful, were launched: the extension of [[Marseilles]] harbour (soon ranking third in Europe and first in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]]); the promotion of the [[Sud Aviation Caravelle|Caravelle]] passenger jetliner (a predecessor of [[Airbus]]); the decision to start building the supersonic Franco-British [[Concorde]] airliner in [[Toulouse]]; the expansion of the French auto industry with state-owned [[Renault]] at its centre; and the building of the first motorways between Paris and the provinces.

With these projects, the French economy recorded growth rates unrivalled since the 19th century. In 1964, for the first time in nearly 100 years&lt;ref&gt;France's GDP was slightly higher than the UK's at the beginning of the 19th century, with the UK surpassing France around 1870. See e.g. {{Cite book|last=Maddison|first=Angus|title=L'économie mondiale 1820–1992: analyse et statistiques|year=1995|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=92-64-24549-9, 9789264245495|page=248}}, Google Books link {{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=A5BFpqBqQ_gC&amp;lpg=PA248&amp;dq=pib%20france%201820&amp;pg=PA248#v=onepage&amp;q=pib%20france%201820|title=ibid|accessdate=13 May 2010|isbn=978-92-64-24549-5|author1=Maddison, Angus|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; France's GDP overtook that of the United Kingdom, a position it held until the 1990s. This period is still remembered in France with some nostalgia as the peak of the ''[[Trente Glorieuses]]'' (&quot;Thirty Glorious Years&quot; of economic growth between 1945 and 1974).&lt;ref name=&quot;Haine&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Haine|first=W.

===Fourth nuclear power===
During his first tenure as President, de Gaulle became enthusiastic about the possibilities of nuclear power. France had carried out important work in the early development of atomic energy and in October 1945 he established the French Atomic Energy Commission [[Commissariat à l'énergie atomique]], (CEA) responsible for all scientific, commercial, and military uses of nuclear energy. However, partly due to communist influences in government who opposed proliferation, research stalled, and France was excluded from American, British, and Canadian nuclear efforts.

By October 1952 Britain became the third country - after America and the Soviet Union - to independently test and develop nuclear weapons. This gave Britain the capability to launch a nuclear strike via its [[Vulcan bomber]] force and it began developing its own ballistic missile programme known as [[Blue Streak (missile)|Blue Streak]].

As early as April 1954 while out of power, de Gaulle had proposed that France should also have its own nuclear weapons; at the time nuclear weapons were seen as a national status symbol and a way of maintaining international prestige with a place at the ‘top table’ of the [[United Nations]]. Full-scale research began again in late 1954 when Prime Minister Pierre Mendes-France authorized a plan to develop the atomic bomb; large deposits of [[uranium]] had been discovered near [[Limoges]] in central France, providing the researchers with an unrestricted supply of nuclear fuel. France's independent [[Force de Frappe]] (strike force) came into being soon after de Gaulle’s election with his authorisation for the first nuclear test.

With the cancellation of Blue Streak, the US agreed to supply Britain with its [[GAM-87 Skybolt|Skybolt]] and later [[Polaris]] weapons systems, and in 1958 the two nations signed the Mutual Defence Agreement forging close links which have seen the US and UK cooperate on nuclear security matters ever since. Although at the time it was still a full member of NATO, France proceeded to develop its own independent nuclear technologies - this would enable it to become a partner in any reprisals and would give it a voice in matters of atomic control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Marshal Juin Defended – General de Gaulle on Moral Issue|newspaper=The Times|date=8 April 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After six years of development, on 13 February 1960 France became the [[France and nuclear weapons|world's fourth nuclear power]] when an extremely high powered nuclear device was exploded in the [[Sahara]] some 700 miles south-south-west of Algiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Weekend of Rejoicing in France|newspaper=The Times|date=15 February 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1963 France decided against signing the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]] designed to slow the arms race because it would have prohibited her from testing nuclear weapons above ground. France continued to carry out tests at the Algerian site until 1966, under an agreement with the newly independent Algeria. France's testing program then moved to the Mururoa and Fangataufa Atolls in the South Pacific.

In November 1967, an article by the French Chief of the General Staff (but inspired by de Gaulle) in the ''Revue de la Défense Nationale'' caused international consternation. It was stated that French nuclear force should be capable of firing &quot;in all directions&quot; – thus including even America as a target. This surprising statement was intended as a declaration of French national independence, and was in retaliation to a warning issued long ago by [[Dean Rusk]] that US missiles would be aimed at France if it attempted to employ atomic weapons outside an agreed plan. However, criticism of de Gaulle was growing over his tendency to act alone with little regard for the views of others.&lt;ref&gt;Ledwidge p. 341&lt;/ref&gt; In August, concern over de Gaulle's policies had been voiced by [[Valéry Giscard d’Estaing]] when he queried ‘the solitary exercise of power’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Independents Fear for France's Future – Gaullist Policy Queried|newspaper=The Times|date=18 August 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NATO===
With the onset of the Cold War and the perceived threat of invasion from the [[Soviet Union]] and the countries of the [[eastern bloc]], America, Canada and the other western European countries set up the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) to co-ordinate a military response to any possible attack. France played a key role during the early days of the organisation, providing a large military contingent and agreeing - after much soul-searching - to the participation of West German forces. But after his election in 1958 Charles de Gaulle took the view that the organisation was too dominated by the US and UK, and that with its problems in Vietnam, America would not fulfil its promise to defend Europe in the event of a Russian invasion.

De Gaulle demanded political parity with Britain and America in NATO, and for its geographic coverage to be extended to include French territories abroad, including Algeria, then experiencing civil war. This was not forthcoming, and so in March 1959 France, citing the need for it to maintain its own independent military strategy, withdrew its Mediterranean fleet from NATO, and a few months later de Gaulle demanded the removal of all US nuclear weapons from French territory.

In 1964 de Gaulle visited Russia, where he hoped to establish France as an alternative influence in the Cold War. Later, he proclaimed a new alliance between the nations, but although the Soviet statesman [[Alexei Kosygin]] made a return visit to France, the Russians did not accept France as a super power, knowing that in any future conflict they would have to rely on the overall protection of the Western Alliance. In 1965, de Gaulle pulled France out of SEATO, the Southeast Asian equivalent of NATO and refused to participate in any future NATO manoeuvres.

In February 1966, France withdrew from NATO military command, but remained within the organisation. However, secret protocols were agreed whereby French forces could quickly be re-integrated into NATO command, demonstrating that the move was little more that a symbolic show of defiance to America and Britain.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} De Gaulle, haunted by the memories of 1940, wanted France to remain the master of the decisions affecting it, unlike in the 1930s, when it had to follow in step with its British ally. He also declared that all foreign military personnel had to leave French territory and gave them one year to redeploy.&lt;ref&gt;Crawley p.431&lt;/ref&gt; This latter action was particularly badly received in the US, prompting [[Dean Rusk]], the US Secretary of State, to ask de Gaulle whether the removal of American military personnel was to include exhumation the 50,000 American war dead buried in French cemeteries.&lt;ref name=&quot;FontanaHistory&quot;&gt;Fontana History of England - Britain &amp; the World role; Robert Holland 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

===EEC===
Despite its success in the war, Britain experienced a difficult time in the post war world. While France and other European countries were enjoying booming economies, Britain experienced high inflation, stagnant growth and poor labour relations.
A number of her important colonial possessions - not least India - quickly gained independence, and following the [[Suez Crisis]], where Britain and France unsuccessfully sought to prevent the Egyptians from nationalising the [[Suez Canal]], Britain struggled to adjust to its reduced world position. The [[U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Dean Acheson]] commented that Britain had &quot;lost an empire and had not yet found a role&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Presentat&quot;&gt;Present at the Creation - My Years in the State Department - Dean Acheson 1969&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F011021-0002, Köln, Staatsbesuch de Gaulle, Begrüßung Adenauer.jpg|thumb|upright|De Gaulle and [[Konrad Adenauer]] in 1961]]
France meanwhile, experiencing the disintegration of her own empire and severe problems in Algeria, turned towards Europe after Suez, and to Germany in particular.&lt;ref name=&quot;FontanaHistory&quot; /&gt; In the years after, the economies of both nations came together and they became leading partners in the drive towards European unity.

One of the conditions of Marshall Aid was that the nation’s leaders must get together to co-ordinate economic efforts and to pool the supply of raw materials. By far the most critical commodities in driving growth were coal and steel. France assumed it would receive large amounts of high quality German coal from the Ruhr as reparations for the war, but America refused to allow this, fearing it could lead to a repeat of the renewed bitterness after the Treaty of Versailles which partly caused World War II.&lt;ref&gt;Purnell's history of the Second World War - number 123 - 1974&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the inspiration of the French statesmen [[Jean Monnet]] and [[Robert Schuman]], together with the German leader [[Konrad Adenauer]], the rift between the two nations had begun to heal and along with Italy and the [[Benelux]] countries, they formed the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], which following the [[Treaty of Rome]] of 1957 became the [[European Economic Community]], also known as the Common Market, beginning around the same time as de Gaulle's presidency. Though he had not been instrumental in setting up the new organisation, de Gaulle spoke enthusiastically of his vision of &quot;an imposing confederation&quot; of European states and of formulating a common European foreign policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME Magazine - 8 August 1960&quot;&gt;''TIME'' magazine, 8 August 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle, who in spite of recent history admired Germany and spoke excellent German in contrast to his poor, mumbling English,&lt;ref&gt;Futurist of the Nation: Regis Debray. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=September 2011}} established a good relationship with the ageing West Germany Chancellor Konrad Adenauer - culminating in the [[Elysee Treaty]] in 1963 - and in the first few years of the Common Market, France's industrial exports to the other five members tripled and its farm export almost quadrupled. The franc became a solid, stable currency for the first time in half a century, and the economy mostly boomed. Adenauer however, all too aware of the importance of American support in Europe, gently distanced himself from the general’s more extreme ideas, wanting no suggestion that any new European community would in any sense challenge or set itself at odds with the U.S. In Adenauer's eyes, the support of the U.S. was more important than any question of European prestige.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME Magazine - 8 August 1960&quot;/&gt; Adenauer was also anxious to reassure Britain that nothing was being done behind her back and was quick to inform British Prime Minister [[Harold Macmillan]] of any new developments.

Great Britain initially declined to join the Common Market, preferring to remain with another organisation known as the [[European Free Trade Area]], mostly consisting of the northern European countries and Portugal. By the late nineteen fifties German and French living standards began to exceed those in Britain, and the government of Harold Macmillan, realising that the EEC was a stronger trading bloc than EFTA, began negotiations to join.

De Gaulle vetoed the British application to join the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) in 1963, famously uttering the single word 'non' into the television cameras at the critical moment, a statement used to sum up French opposition and belligerence towards Britain for many years afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;R+Q&quot;&gt;Twentieth Century Britain. Denis Richards &amp; Antony Quick, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Macmillan said afterwards that he always believed that de Gaulle would prevent Britain joining, but thought he would do it quietly, behind the scenes. He later complained privately that &quot;all our plans are in tatters&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;FontanaHistory&quot; /&gt;

One reason given for de Gaulle's refusal was the recent American agreement to supply Britain with the Skybolt nuclear missile. He did it, he said, because he thought the United Kingdom lacked the necessary political will to be part of a strong Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;ECC&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=How the EU was built|accessdate=18 August 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/1055729.stm|work=BBC News |date=5 December 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further saw Britain as a &quot;[[Trojan Horse]]&quot; for the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fondation Charles de Gaulle|accessdate=13 January 2009|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=375}}&lt;/ref&gt; He maintained there were incompatibilities between continental European and British economic interests. In addition, he demanded that the United Kingdom accept all the conditions laid down by the six existing members of the EEC (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands) and revoke its commitments to countries within its own free trade area (which France had not done with its own). He supported a deepening and an acceleration of common market integration rather than an expansion.&lt;ref name='veto'&gt;{{cite web|title=European NAvigator (ENA) – General de Gaulle's first veto|url= http://www.ena.lu/general_gaulle_veto-020100862.html|accessdate=17 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in this latter respect, a detailed study of the formative years of the EEC argues that the defence of French economic interests, especially in agriculture, in fact played a more dominant role in determining de Gaulle's stance towards British entry than the various political and foreign policy considerations that have often been cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Moravscik|first=Andrew|title=The Choice for Europe: Social Purpose and State Power from Messina to Maastricht|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2008|month=December|isbn=0-8014-3509-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The General's attitude was also influenced by resentments which had come about during his exile in Britain during the Second World War.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Dean Acheson believed that Britain made a grave error in not signing up to the European idea right from the start, and that they continued to suffer the political consequences for at least two decades afterwards. However he also stated his belief that de Gaulle used the 'Common Market' (as it was then termed) as an &quot;exclusionary device to direct European trade towards the interest of France and against that of the United states, Britain and other countries.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Presentat&quot; /&gt;

Claiming continental European solidarity, de Gaulle again rejected British entry when they next applied to join the community in December 1967 under the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] leadership of [[Harold Wilson]]. During negotiations, de Gaulle chided Britain for relying too much on the Americans, saying that sooner or later they would always do what was in their best interests. Wilson said he then gently raised the spectre of the threat of a newly powerful Germany as a result of the EEC, which de Gaulle agreed was a risk.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Wilson Autobiography&lt;/ref&gt; The veto on British entry made de Gaulle unpopular in Ireland since it was clear that for economic reasons Ireland would be excluded from the EEC as long as Britain remained outside. After de Gaulle left office the United Kingdom applied again and finally became a member of the EEC in January 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Just a Normal Winter's Day in Dover|newspaper=The Times|date=2 January 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recognition of the People's Republic of China===
De Gaulle was convinced that a strong and independent France could act as a balancing force between the United States and the Soviet Union, a policy seen as little more than posturing and opportunism by his critics, particularly in Britain and the United States, to which France was formally allied. In January 1964, France established diplomatic relations with the [[People's Republic of China]] (PRC) — the first step towards formal recognition. This was done without first severing links with the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]), led by [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Hitherto the PRC had insisted that all nations abide by a &quot;one China&quot; condition, and at first it was unclear how the matter would be settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Recognition of Peking by France – Relations with two regimes – Chiang protest but no break|newspaper=The Times|date=28 January 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the agreement to exchange ambassadors was subject to a delay of three months and in February, Chiang Kai-shek resolved the problem by cutting off diplomatic relations with France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Chiang Breaks with France|newspaper=The Times|date=11 February 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years later U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] [[Nixon visit to China 1972|visited the PRC]] and began normalising relations – a policy which was confirmed in the [[Shanghai Communiqué]] of 28 February 1972.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As part of a European tour, Nixon visited France in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=De Gaulle's Warm Welcome to Nixon|newspaper=The Times|date=1 March 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; He and de Gaulle both shared the same non-Wilsonian approach to world affairs, believing in nations and their relative strengths, rather than in ideologies, international organisations, or multilateral agreements. De Gaulle is famously known for calling the UN the [[pejorative]] &quot;[[:fr:Machin|le Machin]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Visit to Latin America===
[[File:Illiadegaulle.jpg|thumb|De Gaulle and Argentine president [[Arturo Illia]] in 1964]]
In September and October 1964, despite a recent operation for [[prostate cancer]] and fears for his security, he set out on a punishing 20,000-mile tour of Latin America. He had visited Mexico the previous year and spoke, in Spanish, to the Mexican people on the eve of their celebrations of their independence at the [[National Palace (Mexico)|Palacio Nacional]] in Mexico City. During his new 26-day visit, he was again keen to gain both cultural and economic influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Gen. De Gaulle Takes His Legend To S. America – 40 Speeches To Be Made During 20,000-Mile Tour|newspaper=The Times|date=18 September 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke constantly of his resentment of US influence (hegemony) in Latin America – &quot;that some states should establish a power of political or economic direction outside their own borders&quot;. Yet France could provide no investment or aid to match that from Washington.&lt;ref&gt;Crawley p.427&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second term==
In December 1965, de Gaulle returned as president for a second seven-year term, but this time he had to go through a second round of voting in which he defeated [[François Mitterrand]], who did better than predicted, gaining 45% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=France Again Elects Gen. De Gaulle – M. Mitterrand Concedes Within 80 Minutes – Centre Votes Evenly Divided|newspaper=The Times|date=20 December 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1966, in a famous speech in [[Phnom Penh]] ([[Cambodia]]), he expressed France's disapproval of the U.S. involvement in the [[Vietnam War]], calling for a U.S. withdrawal from Vietnam as the only way to ensure peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

As the Vietnam War had its roots in the previous [[First Indochina War|Indochina War]], in which the United States had provided France with aid, this speech did little to endear de Gaulle to the Americans{{Who|date=November 2008}},{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} even if their leaders later came to the same conclusion. He later visited [[Guadeloupe]], in the aftermath of [[Hurricane Inez]] for 2 days, bringing aid which totalled billions of [[francs]].

===Empty Chair Crisis===

During the establishment of the [[European Community]], de Gaulle helped precipitate one of the greatest crises in the history of the EC, the ''Empty Chair Crisis''. It involved the financing of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]], but almost more importantly the use of [[qualified majority voting]] in the EC (as opposed to unanimity). In June 1965, after France and the other five members could not agree, de Gaulle withdrew France's representatives from the EC. Their absence left the organisation essentially unable to run its affairs until the [[Luxembourg compromise]] was reached in January 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= France Ends Boycott of Common Market – No Winners or Losers after Midnight Agreement|newspaper=The Times|date=31 January 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle succeeded in influencing the decision-making mechanism written into the Treaty of Rome by insisting on solidarity founded on mutual understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Six-Day War===
With tension rising in the Middle East in 1967, de Gaulle on 2 June declared an arms embargo against Israel, just three days before the outbreak of the [[Six-Day War]]. This, however, did not affect spare parts for the French military hardware with which the Israeli armed forces were equipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=French Emphasis on Long-Term Issues|newspaper=The Times|date=7 June 1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was an abrupt change in policy. In 1956 France, Britain, and Israel had cooperated in an elaborate effort to retake the [[Suez Canal]] from Egypt. Israel's air force operated French [[Mirage (aircraft)|Mirage]] and [[Dassault Mystère|Mystère]] jets in the Six-Day War, and its navy was building its new missile boats in [[Cherbourg-Octeville|Cherbourg]]. Though paid for, their transfer to Israel was now blocked by de Gaulle's government. But they were smuggled out in an operation that drew further denunciations from the French government. The last boats took to the sea in December 1969, directly after a major deal between France and now-independent Algeria exchanging French armaments for Algerian oil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/Cherbourg.html The Cherbourg Boats] by Doron Geller&lt;/ref&gt;

Under de Gaulle, following the independence of [[Algeria]], France embarked on foreign policy more favourable to the [[Arab]] side. General de Gaulle's position in 1967 at the time of the Six Day War played a part in France's newfound popularity in the Arab world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Fondation Charles de Gaulle – De Gaulle and the Third World|url=http://www.charles-de-gaulle.org/article.php3?id_article=180|accessdate =17 January 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel turned towards the United States for arms, and toward its own industry.

In a televised news conference on 27 November 1967, de Gaulle described the Jewish people as &quot;this elite people, sure of themselves and domineering&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/28101 |title=France-Israel: from De Gaulle's arms embargo to Sarkozy's election |publisher=Ejpress.org |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his letter to [[David Ben-Gurion]] dated 9 January 1968, he explained that he was convinced that Israel had ignored his warnings and overstepped the bounds of moderation by taking possession of Jerusalem, and so much Jordanian, Egyptian, and Syrian territory by force of arms. He felt Israel had exercised repression and expulsions during the occupation and that it amounted to annexation. He said that provided Israel withdrew her forces, it appeared that it might be possible to reach a solution through the UN framework which could include assurances of a dignified and fair future for refugees and minorities in the Middle East, recognition from Israel's neighbors, and freedom of navigation through the Gulf of Aqaba and the Suez Canal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10C11F73C541B7B93C2A8178AD85F4C8685F9&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=de+Gaulle+dignified+minorities&amp;st=p |title=Text of de Gaulle's Answer to Letter From Ben-Gurion |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date= 10 January 1968|accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigerian Civil War===
The Eastern Region of [[Nigeria]] declared itself independent under the name of The Independent Republic of [[Biafra]] on 30 May 1967. On 6 July the first shots in the Nigerian civil war were fired, marking the start of a conflict would last until January 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=920 Days of Fighting, Death and Hunger |newspaper=The Times|date=12 January 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt; Britain provided military aid to the Federal Republic of Nigeria — yet more was made available by the Soviet Union. Under de Gaulle's leadership, France embarked on a period of interference outside the traditional French zone of influence. A policy geared toward the break-up of Nigeria put Britain and France into opposing camps. Relations between France and Nigeria had been under strain since the third French nuclear explosion in the [[Sahara]] in December 1960. From August 1968, when its embargo was lifted, France provided limited and covert support to the breakaway province. Although French arms helped to keep Biafra in action for the final 15 months of the civil war, its involvement was seen as insufficient and counterproductive. The Biafran Chief of Staff stated that the French &quot;did more harm than good by raising false hopes and by providing the British with an excuse to reinforce Nigeria.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Saha&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last= Saha |first= Santosh C. |title= Perspectives on Contemporary Ethnic Conflict: Primal Violence Or the Politics of Conviction?|year= 2006|publisher=Lexington Books|location= Lanham MD|isbn= 0-7391-1085-3, 9780739110850|pages= 344, p.184–184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1967, de Gaulle visited Canada, which was celebrating its centennial with a [[world's fair|world fair]] in Montreal, [[Expo 67]]. On 24 July, speaking to a large crowd from a balcony at [[Montreal]]'s city hall, de Gaulle shouted &quot;Vive le Québec libre!&quot; (Long live free Quebec!) then added, &quot;Vive le Canada français!&quot; (Long live French Canada!), and finally, &quot;Et vive la France.&quot; (And long live France!)&lt;ref name =&quot;CBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In the following year, de Gaulle visited [[Brittany]], where he declaimed a poem written by his uncle (also called [[Charles de Gaulle (poet)|Charles de Gaulle]]) in the [[Breton language]]. The speech followed a series of crackdowns on [[Breton nationalism]]. De Gaulle was accused of hypocrisy, on the one hand supporting a &quot;free&quot; Quebec because of linguistic and ethnic differences from other Canadians, while on the other supposedly &quot;oppressing&quot; a regional and ethnic nationalist movement in Brittany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:May 68 poster 1.png|thumb|right|A May 1968 poster: &quot;Be young and shut up,&quot; with silhouette caricature of General de Gaulle.]] --&gt;

De Gaulle's government was criticised within France, particularly for its heavy-handed style. While the written press and elections were free, and private stations such as [[Europe 1]] were able to broadcast in French from abroad, the state's [[Radiodiffusion-Télévision Française|ORTF]] had a monopoly on television and radio. This monopoly meant that the executive was in a position to bias the news. In many respects, Gaullist France was conservative, Catholic, and repressive, with women viewed as inferior.&lt;ref&gt;

| accessdate =13 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many factors contributed to a general weariness of sections of the public, particularly the student youth, which led to the events of May 1968.

The huge demonstrations and strikes in France in May 1968 severely challenged de Gaulle's legitimacy. He and other government leaders feared that the country was on the brink of revolution or civil war. On 29 May de Gaulle disappeared without notifying Prime Minister Pompidou or anyone else in the government, stunning the country. He fled to [[Baden-Baden, Germany]] to meet with General Massu, now head of the French military there, to discuss possible army intervention against the protesters. De Gaulle returned to France after being assured of the military's support.&lt;ref name=&quot;dogan1984&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dogan|first=Mattei|title=How Civil War Was Avoided in France|journal=International Political Science Review / Revue internationale de science politique|year=1984|volume=5|issue=3|pages=245–277|jstor=1600894}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Autocrat of the Grand Manner|newspaper=The Times|date=28 April 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a private meeting discussing the students' and workers' demands for direct participation in business and government he coined the phrase &quot;La réforme oui, la [[chienlit]] non&quot;, which can be politely translated as 'reform yes, masquerade/chaos no.' It was a [[vernacular]] [[scatological]] [[pun]] meaning '[[chienlit|chie-en-lit]], no' (crap-in-bed, no). The term is now common parlance in French political commentary, used both critically and ironically referring back to de Gaulle.&lt;ref&gt;Crawley p.454&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Crawley (p.454) also writes that de Gaulle was undoubtedly using the term in his barrack-room style to mean 'shit in the bed'. De Gaulle had said it first in Bucharest while on an official visit from which he returned on 19 May 1968. Pompidou told the press that de Gaulle used the phrase after the Cabinet Meeting on 19 May.&lt;/ref&gt;

But de Gaulle offered to accept some of the reforms the demonstrators sought. He again considered a referendum to support his moves, but on 30 May Pompidou persuaded him to dissolve parliament (in which the government had all but lost its majority in the March 1967 elections) and hold new elections instead. The June 1968 elections were a major success for the Gaullists and their allies; when shown the spectre of revolution or civil war, the majority of the country rallied to him. His party won 352 of 487 seats,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Dropping the Pilot|newspaper=The Times|date=11 July 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; but de Gaulle remained personally unpopular; a survey conducted immediately after the crisis showed that a majority of the country saw him as too old, too self-centred, too authoritarian, too conservative, and too [[anti-American]].{{r|dogan1984}} The general consensus was that de Gaulle was out of touch with the average Frenchman, preoccupying himself with military and foreign affairs while giving scant attention to domestic issues.

De Gaulle vowed that if the referendum failed, he would resign his office. Despite an eight-minute-long speech by de Gaulle, the referendum failed and he duly resigned. Two months later [[Georges Pompidou]] was elected as his successor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1969/Charles-DeGaulle-Defeated/12303189849225-8/|title = Charles de Gaulle Defeated|accessdate =20 May 2010|year = 1969|publisher=UPI.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Gaulle retired once again to his beloved nine-acre country estate, La Boisserie (the woodland glade), in [[Colombey-les-Deux-Églises]], 120 miles southeast of Paris. There the General, who often described old age as a &quot;shipwreck,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME Magazine - 23 November 1970&quot;&gt;''TIME'' magazine, 23 November 1970&lt;/ref&gt; continued his memoirs, dictated to his secretary from notes. To visitors, de Gaulle said, &quot;I will finish three books, if God grants me life.&quot;  ''The Renewal'', the first of three planned volumes to be called ''Memoirs of Hope'', was quickly finished and immediately became the fastest seller in French publishing history. During the day he also usually took two strolls, one alone and the other with his wife Yvonne around the village.

He did not accept the sizable pensions to which he was entitled as a retired president and as a retired general, but only a much smaller colonel's pension. He was punctilious with regard to money, taking care to separate his private expenses from those of his official function. He paid for his own haircuts and the stamps for personal correspondence, and had an electricity meter installed in the private accommodation at his official residence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mahrane&quot;/&gt;

==Private life==
Charles de Gaulle married [[Yvonne de Gaulle|Yvonne Vendroux]] on 7 April 1921. They had three children: [[Philippe de Gaulle|Philippe]] (born 1921), Élisabeth (1924), who married General [[Alain de Boissieu]], and [[Anne de Gaulle|Anne]] (1928–1948). Anne had [[Down syndrome|Down's syndrome]] and died of pneumonia at the age of 20. De Gaulle always had a particular love for his handicapped daughter; one Colombey resident recalled how he used to walk with her hand-in-hand around the property, caressing her and talking quietly about the things she understood.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME Magazine - 23 November 1970&quot;/&gt;

Like her husband, Yvonne de Gaulle was a conservative Catholic, and campaigned against prostitution, to stop pornography from being sold in newsstands and sex and nudity from being shown on TV, for which she earned the nickname &quot;Tante (&quot;Auntie&quot;) Yvonne.&quot; Later she unsuccessfully tried to persuade de Gaulle to outlaw miniskirts in France.

Charles de Gaulle had an older brother Xavier (1887-1955) and sister Marie-Agnes (1889-1983), and two younger brothers, Jaques (1893-1946) and Pierre (1897-1959). He was particularly close to the youngest, Pierre, who so resembled him that Presidential bodyguards often saluted him by mistake when he visited his famous brother or accommpanied him on official visits.

One of Charles de Gaulle's grandsons, also named [[Charles de Gaulle (1948-)|Charles De Gaulle]], was a [[member of the European Parliament]] from 1994 to 2004, his last tenure being for the [[National Front (France)|National Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Death==
On 9 November 1970, two weeks short of what would have been his 80th birthday, Charles de Gaulle died suddenly, despite enjoying very robust health his entire life (except for a [[prostate]] operation a few years earlier). He had been watching the evening news on television and playing Solitaire around 7:40 PM when he suddenly pointed to his neck and said &quot;I feel a pain right here&quot; before collapsing. His wife called the doctor and the local priest, but by the time they arrived he had died from a [[aneurysm|ruptured blood vessel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;times&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=World Leaders to Gather in Paris to Honour General de Gaulle|newspaper=The Times|date=11 November 1970}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His wife asked that she be allowed to inform her family before the news was released. She was able to contact her daughter in Paris quickly, but their son, who was in the navy was difficult to track down and so the President, Georges Pompidou was not informed until 4:00 AM the next morning and went on television some 18 hours after the event to inform the nation of the general's death.  He said simply: &quot;General de Gaulle is dead. France is a widow.&quot;

De Gaulle had made arrangements that insisted that his funeral would be held at Colombey, and that no presidents or ministers attend his funeral – only his ''[[Compagnons de la Libération]]''.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

Despite his wishes, such were the number of foreign dignitaries who wanted to honour De Gaulle that Pompidou was forced to arrange a separate memorial service at the [[Notre Dame de Paris|Notre-Dame Cathedral]], to be held at the same time as his actual funeral. Among those at the memorial service were 63 present or former heads of state, including US President [[Richard Nixon]], Soviet President [[Nikolai Podgorny]], British Prime Minister [[Edward Heath]], the Indian Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]], the President of Italy, representatives of 17 of France’s former African colonies and the reigning monarchs of Ethiopia, Iran, The Netherlands, Belgium, Monaco and Luxembourg. Also in the congregation were [[David Ben-Gurion]], [[Anthony Eden]], [[Harold Macmillan]], [[Harold Wilson]], former West German Chancellors [[Ludwig Erhard]] and [[Kurt-Georg Kiesinger]], [[Marlene Dietrich]] and US Senator [[Edward Kennedy]], who remembered De Gaulle's immediate decision to attend the funeral of his brother [[John F. Kennedy|John]] following his [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination in 1963]]. The Chinese leader [[Mao Zedong]] was unable to attend but sent a wreath. The only notable absentee was Canadian PM [[Pierre Trudeau]], possibly because he was still angry over de Gaulle's cry of ''&quot;Vive le Quebec libre&quot;'' during his 1967 visit.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME Magazine - 23 November 1970&quot;/&gt;

The funeral on 12 November 1970 was the biggest such event in French history, with hundreds of thousands of French people - many carrying blankets and picnic baskets - and thousands of cars parked in the roads and fields along the routes to the two venues. Special trains were laid on to bring extra mourners to the region and the crowd was packed so tightly that those who fainted had to be passed overhead toward first-aid stations at the rear.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME Magazine - 23 November 1970&quot;/&gt;

The General was conveyed to the church on an armoured reconnaissance vehicle and carried to his grave, next to his daughter Anne, by eight young men of Colombey. As he was lowered into the ground, the bells of all the churches in France tolled, starting from Notre Dame and spreading out from there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1970/DeGaulle-and-Nasser-Die/12303235577467-8|title = 1970 – Year in Review.

Madame de Gaulle asked the undertaker to provide the same type of simple oak casket that he used for everyone else, but because of the General's extreme height, the coffin cost $9 more than usual.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME Magazine - 23 November 1970&quot;/&gt; He specified that his tombstone bear the simple inscription of his name and his years of birth and death. Therefore, it simply says: &quot;Charles de Gaulle, 1890–1970&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:TombeauChdG.JPG|thumb|Grave of Charles de Gaulle at [[Colombey-les-Deux-Églises]]]]

The French newspaper ''Le Monde'' referred to the days after his death as &quot;a planetary mourning.&quot;{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} At the service, President Pompidou said &quot;de Gaulle gave France her governing institutions, her independence and her place in the world.&quot;{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} [[André Malraux]], the writer and intellectual who served as his Minister of Culture, called him &quot;a man of the day before yesterday and the day after tomorrow.&quot;{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Legacy==
According to a 2005 survey, carried out in the context of the tenth anniversary of the death of Socialist President [[François Mitterrand]], 35% of respondents said Mitterrand was the best French President ever, followed by Charles de Gaulle (30%) and then [[Jacques Chirac]] (12%).&lt;ref&gt;Mitterrand, le préféré des Français [archive], site de TF1-LCI, 2 janvier 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Another poll by [[BVA (company)|BVA]] four years later, showed that 87% of French people regarded his presidency positively.&lt;ref&gt;Charles de Gaulle, ex-président préféré des Français » [archive], Le Nouvel Observateur, 4 novembre 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Statues have been erected in his honor in [[Warsaw]], [[Moscow]], and [[Quebec]]. The first [[Algeria]]n president [[Ahmed Ben Bella]], said of De Gaulle that before granting [[Algeria]] independence, that while he was the &quot;military leader who brought us the hardest blows&quot; he also &quot;saw further&quot; than other politicians, and that his &quot;universal dimension that is too often lacking in current leaders.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed Ben Bella, ''De Gaulle voyait plus loin'', in ''L'Express'', 26 October 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]], the first President of [[Senegal]], said that few Western leaders could boast of having risked their lives to grant a colony independence.  

In 1990, his old political enemy, the [[Socialist]] President [[Francois Mitterrand]] presided over the celebrations to mark the 100th anniversary of his birth. Mitterrand, having once written a vitriolic critique of him called the ‘Permanent Coup d’Etat’, quoted a then recent opinion poll, saying; &quot;As General de Gaulle, he has entered the pantheon of great national heroes, where he ranks ahead of [[Napoleon]] and behind only [[Charlemagne]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DeGaulle&quot;&gt;De Gaulle: Statesmanship, Grandeur and Modern Democracy: Daniel Mahoney 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he initially enjoyed good relations with U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]], who admired his stance against the Soviet Union - particularly when the Berlin Wall was being built - and who called him &quot;a great captain of the western world&quot;, their relationship later cooled.&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt; De Gaulle was Kennedy's most loyal ally during the [[Cuban Missile Crisis]] and supported the right that the United States claimed to defend its interests in the Western Hemisphere, in contrast to then German Chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]] who doubted Kennedy's commitment to Europe and thought the crisis could have been avoided.&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds D. One World Divisible: A Global History Since 1945. 2000. New York: W W Norton and Company.p182&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, De Gaulle was a prominent figure at Kennedy's funeral.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corbisimages.com/images/Corbis-U1403096.jpg?size=67&amp;uid=706e2e9a-f414-452f-a79b-1210f326cfac]&lt;/ref&gt; De Gaulle was very much admired by the later President Nixon, however. After a meeting at the [[Palace of Versailles]] just before the general left office, Nixon declared that &quot;He did not try to put on airs but an aura of majesty seemed to envelop him... his performance - and I do not use that word disparagingly - was breathtaking.&quot;&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt; On arriving for his funeral several months later, Nixon said of him &quot;greatness knows no national boundaries&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Time (magazine)|]]'', 23 November 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

The French professor and academic [[Régis Debray]], who served as Foreign Affairs adviser to President [[François Mitterrand]], in his book ''[http://dvd-copy.com/books/Biography-Autobiography/Charles-De-Gaulle/0860914526/free_online.htm Charles de Gaulle: Futurist of the Nation]''  (1994), wrote:  &quot;I cannot hope to get Charles of France intact across the Channel. The cliché-covered gravestone is too heavy. And how does one preserve some freedom of thought between the pomposities of official courtesy on the one hand and, on the other, the unshakeable suspicion with which many of my British friends regard an archaic, ungrateful xenophobe, authoritarian and vaguely fascist ? Neither the worldwide dissemination of images and capital, nor the digging of the Channel Tunnel, alters the fact that caricatures travel better than portraits. After all, the bowlers, umbrellas and thin drizzle of the City do not travel either, any more than the morning ''sfumato'' in the hills of Siena or the bouquet of great Bordeaux. I am afraid that, like them, this victorious soldier, who disdained the military and placed the writer above the warrior, may have to be consumed in his country of origin&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dvd-copy.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web

| url        = http://dvd-copy.com/books/Biography-Autobiography/Charles-De-Gaulle/0860914526/free_online.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Debray called de Gaule &quot;super-lucide&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;dvd-copy.com&quot;/&gt; and pointed out that virtually all of his predictions, such as the fall of communism, the reunification of Germany and the resurrection of ‘old’ Russia had come true since his death. Debray compared him with [[Napoleon Bonaparte|Napoleon]] ('the great political myth of the nineteenth century'), calling de Gaulle his twentieth century equivalent, &quot;The sublime, it seems, appears in France only once a century… Napoleon left two generations dead on battlefield. De Gaulle was more sparing with other people blood; even so, he left us, as it were, stranded, alive but dazed… A delusion, perhaps, but one that turns the world upside down: causes events and movements; divides people into supporters and adversaries; leaves traces in the form of civil and penal codes and railways, factories and institutions (the Fifth Republic has already lasted three times as long as the Empire). A statesman who gets something going, who has followers, escapes the reality of the reports and statistics and become part of imagination. Napoleon and de Gaulle modified the state of things because they modified souls”.&lt;ref name=&quot;dvd-copy.com&quot;/&gt; However, Debray pointed out that there is a difference between Napoleon and de Gaulle : «How can the exterminator be compared with the liberator ?... The former ran the whole enterprise into the ground, while the latter managed to save it. So that to measure the rebel against the despot, the challenger against the leader, is just glaringly idiotic. You simply do not put an adventurer who worked for himself or his family on the same level as a commander-in-chef serving his country… Regrettably, Gaullism and Bonopartism have a number of features in common, but Napoleon and de Gaulle do not have the same moral value. ... the first wanted a Holy French Empire without the faith, a Europe under French occupation. The second wanted to rescue the nation from the emperors and establish a free France in a free Europe&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dvd-copy.com&quot;/&gt; 

Debray continued that he could not say if the general ever loved Britain, but that ironically, as a result of reading his account of his time in exile in his autobiography, &quot;Probably no Frenchman since Hastings has done more to create a familiar, attractive and romantic image of the hereditary enemy Britain in the minds of Frenchmen of a certain age than this champion of the French self-interest&quot;.

On Algeria, the Australian historian [[Brian Crozier]] has written &quot;that he was able to part with Algeria without civil war was a great though negative achievement which in all probability would have been beyond the capacity of any other leader France possessed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;De Gaulle; the statesman: Brian Crozier (Methuen). 1974&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1961, when four rebel generals seized power in Algeria, he &quot;did not flinch in the face of this daunting challenge&quot;, but appeared on television in his general’s uniform to forbid Frenchmen to obey the rebels' orders in an &quot;inflexible display of personal authority&quot;.

The historian K. Perry, while referring to his handling of the Algerian settlement as &quot;a masterly performance&quot;, went on to say that &quot;his impatient shedding of the problem increased the price in human terms that had to be paid. He was so possessed by a burning ambition to restore French greatness and break American leadership in western international affairs that he wished for a speedy end to the Algerian problem, which had become a tiresome distraction for him&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; A number of commentators have been critical of de Gaulle for his failure to prevent the massacres after Algerian independence&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot; /&gt; while others take the view that the struggle had been so long and savage that it was perhaps inevitable.&lt;ref name=Fenby /&gt;

De Gaulle was an excellent manipulator of the media, as seen in his shrewd use of television to persuade around 80% of [[Metropolitan France]] to approve the new constitution for the Fifth Republic. In so doing, he refused to yield to the reasoning of his opponents who said that, if he succeeded in Algeria, he would no longer be necessary. He afterwards enjoyed massive approval ratings, and once said that &quot;every Frenchman is, has been or will be Gaullist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Futurist of the Nation'': Régis Debray. 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

In its obituary,&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME Magazine - 23 November 1970&quot;/&gt; ''TIME'' magazine said;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;He rescued his nation not once but twice, the first time from the shame of its capitulation to the Nazis in World War II, the second from its own quarrelling factions. With the Fifth Republic, he gave France its first strong governmental framework since the days of Louis Napoleon. He was indeed ‘l'homme du destin,’ (the man of destiny) as Winston Churchill once called him, and even his name, suggestive of both [[Charlemagne]] and [[ancient Gaul]], was perfectly suited to the role he took upon himself. But the fact was that France offered De Gaulle too limited a scope and power base. Try as he might, he could not change the basic reality that France simply lacked the specific gravity to offset the force of a superpower.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;Like most crusaders, De Gaulle was extraordinarily farsighted but sometimes, maddeningly, his imperious manner and fragile sensibilities infuriated his nation's closest allies. In a vain effort to force French leadership on Europe, he twice vetoed Britain's entry into the continent's first economic cooperative, the Common Market. At home, he stinted on public welfare in the form of new roads, telephones and a thousand other needed improvements, to pay for symbolically important but ultimately hollow shows of prestige, like the nuclear Force de Frappe&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Britain, his apparent betrayal at twice preventing the British attempt at joining the EEC was keenly felt for many years.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} That de Gaulle did not necessarily reflect mainstream French public opinion with his veto was suggested by the decisive majority of French people who voted in favour of British membership when the much more conciliatory Pompidou called a referendum on the matter in 1972. His early influence in setting the parameters of the EEC can still be seen today, most notably with the controversial Common Agricultural Policy.

Some writers take the view that Pompidou was a more progressive and influential leader than de Gaulle because, though also a Gaullist, he was less autocratic and more interested in social reforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;20th Century Britain. Denis Richards &amp; Anthony Quick. 1974&lt;/ref&gt; Although he followed the main tenets of de Gaulle’s foreign policy, he was keen to work towards warmer relations with the US. A banker by profession, Pompidou is also widely credited, as de Gaulle's Prime Minister from 1962–1968, with putting in place the reforms which provided the impetus for the economic growth which followed.

In 1968, shortly before leaving office, de Gaulle refused to devalue the Franc on grounds of national prestige, but upon taking over Pompidou reversed the decision almost straight away. It was ironic, that during the financial crisis of 1968, France had to rely on American (and West German) financial aid to help shore up the economy.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; Perry has written &quot;The events of 1968 illustrated the brittleness of de Gaulle’s rule. That he was taken by surprise is an indictment of his rule; he was too remote from real life and had no interest in the conditions under which ordinary French people lived. Problems like inadequate housing and social services had been ignored. The French greeted the news of his departure with some relief as the feeling had grown that he had outlived his usefulness. Perhaps he clung onto power too long, perhaps he should have retired in 1965 when he was still popular.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;

Brian Crozier has said &quot;the fame of de Gaulle outstrips his achievements, he chose to make repeated gestures of petulance and defiance that weakened the west without compensating advantages to France&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

However, [[Daniel Mahoney]] writes that &quot;such is the level to which de Gaulle has now passed into mythology in France that he is now claimed by all the political parties, though some more than others. No account of de Gaulle that wishes to capture the man and his works can simply be a profile of his time in power, for Charles de Gaulle was undoubtably one of the great human beings of the twentieth century, a member of that distinguished elite who deserve the appellation ‘statesman’.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DeGaulle&quot; /&gt;

Writing in 1995, another commentator, [[Pierre Manent]] attempted to explain why he remains so popular in France, yet not in the [[United States]];

&quot;It is true that de Gaulle wanted France to take its destiny into its own hands and wished it would cease to depend on American protection. As such, this ambition was legitimate, even if one disagrees with the manner in which it was formulated and put into practice. As for the wartime difficulties with Roosevelt, the great American president was simply mistaken about de Gaulle, whom he took to be an aspiring despot, and this error of judgement was the principal cause of grave political differences that could have been avoided.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DeGaulle&quot; /&gt;

Despite spending virtually his entire political career at odds with de Gaulle and his policies, the eminent diplomat and economist [[Jean Monnet]] had no doubt about the positive role he played in leading the Free French during the first years of the war and immediately after the liberation. Speaking in 1965 he told a journalist; ''First things first, before a united Europe and an Atlantic partnership there had to be a united France, strong, mobilized and able to assume a leading role among the Western allies. Without de Gaulle or against de Gaulle, we could not have liberated or reconstructed France. There was no one but de Gaulle. Whatever his faults, he was a tower of strength and inspiration.''&lt;ref name=Schoenbrun /&gt;

In 1948 he made a speech in Edinburgh regarding France's historical alliance with [[Scotland]];
Charles de Gaulle described the alliance between Scotland and France as &quot;the oldest alliance in the world&quot;. He also declared that:[8]
In every combat where for five centuries the destiny of France was at stake, there were always men of Scotland to fight side by side with men of France, and what Frenchmen feel is that no people has ever been more generous than yours with its friendship.
