'''Michael Joseph Jackson'''&lt;ref name=&quot;Legal name&quot;/&gt; (August 29, 1958 – June 25, 2009) was an American [[recording artist]], [[entertainer]] and [[businessman]]. Often referred to as the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|King of Pop]], or by his initials '''MJ''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001391/bio |title=Biography for Michael Jackson | publisher=Internet Movie Database | accessdate=October 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson is recognized as the most successful entertainer of all time by [[Guinness World Records]]. His unparalleled contributions to music, dance, and fashion, along with a much-publicized personal life, made him a global figure in [[popular culture]] for over four decades. The eighth child of the [[Jackson family]], he debuted on the professional music scene along with his brothers as a member of [[The Jackson 5]] in 1964, and began his solo career in 1971.

In the early 1980s, Jackson became a dominant figure in [[popular music]]. The music videos for his songs, including those of &quot;[[Beat It]]&quot;, &quot;[[Billie Jean]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Thriller (song)|Thriller]]&quot;, were credited with breaking down racial barriers and transforming the medium into an art form and promotional tool. The popularity of these videos helped to bring the then relatively new television channel [[MTV]] to fame. With videos such as &quot;[[Black or White]]&quot; and &quot;[[Scream/Childhood|Scream]]&quot; he continued to innovate the medium throughout the 1990s, as well as forging a reputation as a touring solo artist. Through stage and video performances, Jackson popularized a number of complicated dance techniques, such as the [[robot (dance)|robot]], and the [[moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]], to which he gave the name. His distinctive sound and style has influenced numerous [[hip hop music|hip hop]], [[post-disco]], [[contemporary R&amp;B]], pop and rock artists.

Jackson's 1982 album ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'' is the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling album of all time]]. His other records, including ''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]'' (1979), ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'' (1987), ''[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]]'' (1991), and ''[[HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I|HIStory]]'' (1995), also rank among the world's best-selling. Jackson is one of the few artists to have been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]] twice. He was also inducted into the Dance Hall of Fame as the first and only dancer from pop and rock music. Some of his other [[Records and achievements of Michael Jackson|achievements]] include multiple Guinness World Records; 13 [[Grammy Award]]s as well as the [[Grammy Legend Award]] and the [[Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award]]; 26 [[American Music Awards]], more than any other artist, including the &quot;Artist of the Century&quot; and &quot;Artist of the 1980s&quot;; 13 [[List of artists who reached number one in the United States#J|number-one singles in the United States]] in his solo career, more than any other male artist in the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] era; and the estimated sale of over 750&amp;nbsp;million records worldwide. Jackson won [[List of awards received by Michael Jackson|hundreds of awards]], which made him the most-awarded recording artist in the history of popular music.&lt;ref name=&quot;20 People Who Changed Black Music: Michael Jackson, the Child Star-Turned-Adult Enigma&quot;/&gt; He was also one of the world's most prominent humanitarians and philanthropists; personally, and through his [[Heal the World Foundation]], he donated more than $300 million in charity, holds the [[Guinness World Records|Guinness World Record]] for having supported the most charities out of any pop star, and echoed these themes throughout some of his notable songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-288836 |title=Humanitarian: Guinness Book Of Records Names Michael &quot;Most Support Charities&quot; |publisher=CNN |date=June 30, 2009 |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://simmerdown3.wordpress.com/2009/07/09/michael-jacksons-charity-work/ |title=Michael Jackson’s Charity Work |publisher=The Gholston Post |date=July 9, 2009 |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspects of Jackson's personal life, including his changing [[Michael Jackson's health and appearance|appearance]], [[Personal relationships of Michael Jackson|personal relationships]], and behavior, generated controversy. In 1993, he was [[1993 child sexual abuse accusations against Michael Jackson|accused of child sexual abuse]], but the case was settled out of court and no formal charges were brought. In 2005, he was [[People v. Jackson|tried and acquitted]] of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges after the jury found him not guilty on all counts. While preparing for his concert series titled ''[[This Is It (Michael Jackson concerts)|This Is It]]'', Jackson [[Death of Michael Jackson|died]] of acute [[propofol]] and [[benzodiazepine]] intoxication on June 25, 2009, after suffering from cardiac arrest. The [[Los Angeles County Coroner's Office|Los Angeles County Coroner]] ruled his death a homicide, and [[Trial of Conrad Murray|his personal physician]] was convicted of [[involuntary manslaughter]]. Jackson's death triggered a global outpouring of grief, and as many as one billion people around the world reportedly watched his [[Michael Jackson memorial service|public memorial service]] on live television.{{cn|date=October 2012}} In March 2010, [[Sony Music Entertainment]] and Jackson's estate signed the largest music contract ever, with a $250 million deal to retain distribution rights to his recordings until 2017, and to release seven posthumous albums over the decade following his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By&amp;nbsp;Daniel Kreps |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/michael-jackson-estate-sony-strike-massive-250-million-deal-to-release-king-of-pops-music-20100316 |title=Michael Jackson Estate, Sony Strike Massive 250 Million Deal to Release King of Pop's Music &amp;#124; Music News |work=Rolling Stone |date=March 16, 2010 |accessdate=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and career==

===Early life and The Jackson 5 (1958–1975)===
[[File:2300 Jackson Street Yuksel.jpg|thumb|alt=A house surrounded by yellow colored grass, flowers, trees, and a light blue colored sky can be seen. The house has white walls, two windows, a white door with a black door frame, and a black roof. In front of the house there is a walk way, yellow grass and multiple colored flowers and memorabilia. In the background, there are two tall trees and a light blue colored sky that has multiple clouds. |Jackson's childhood home in [[Gary, Indiana]], showing floral tributes after his death]]
Michael Jackson was born on August 29, 1958, the eighth of ten children in an African American working-class family who lived in a small 3-room house in [[Gary, Indiana]],&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson&quot;/&gt; an industrial city near Chicago. His mother, [[Katherine Jackson|Katherine Esther Scruse]], was a devout [[Jehovah's Witness]], and his father, [[Joe Jackson (manager)|Joseph Walter &quot;Joe&quot; Jackson]], was a steel mill worker who performed with an R&amp;B band called The Falcons. Jackson had three sisters: [[Rebbie Jackson|Rebbie]], [[La Toya Jackson|La Toya]], and [[Janet Jackson|Janet]], and five brothers: [[Jackie Jackson|Jackie]], [[Tito Jackson|Tito]], [[Jermaine Jackson|Jermaine]], [[Marlon Jackson|Marlon]], and [[Randy Jackson (The Jacksons)|Randy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson George overview 20&quot;/&gt; A sixth brother, Brandon, died shortly after birth.&lt;ref name=&quot;taraborrelli&quot;/&gt;

Jackson had a troubled relationship with his father, Joe.&lt;ref name=&quot;MJ's secret childhood&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tara 20-22&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt; Joseph acknowledged in 2003 that he regularly whipped Jackson as a boy.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.bbc.co.uk&quot;/&gt; Jackson stated that he was physically and emotionally abused during incessant rehearsals, though he also credited his father's strict discipline with playing a large role in his success.&lt;ref name=&quot;MJ's secret childhood&quot;/&gt; Jackson first spoke openly about his childhood abuse in an interview with [[Oprah Winfrey]], broadcast in February 1993. He admitted that he had often cried from loneliness and he would vomit on the sight of his father. Jackson's father was also said to have verbally abused Jackson, saying that he had a fat nose on numerous occasions.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot;/&gt; In fact, Michael Jackson's deep dissatisfaction with his appearance, his nightmares and chronic sleep problems, his tendency to remain hyper-compliant especially with his father, and to remain childlike throughout his adult life are in many ways consistent with the effects of this chronic maltreatment he endured as a young child.&lt;ref name=&quot;maltreatment&quot;/&gt;

In an interview with [[Martin Bashir]], later included in the 2003 broadcast of ''[[Living with Michael Jackson]]'', Jackson acknowledged that his father hurt him when he was a child, but was nonetheless a &quot;genius&quot;, as he admitted his father's strict discipline played a huge role in his success. When Bashir dismissed the positive remark and continued asking about beatings, Jackson put his hand over his face and objected to the questions. He recalled that Joseph sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, and that &quot;if you didn't do it the right way, he would tear you up, really get you&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;taraborrelli1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lewis 165-168&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Jackson 5 tv special 1972.JPG|thumb|left|Jackson (center) as a member of The Jackson 5 in 1972]]
In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by brothers Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing [[conga]]s and [[tambourine]]. Jackson later began performing backup vocals and dancing. When he was eight, Jackson began sharing the lead vocals with his older brother Jermaine, and the group's name was changed to [[The Jackson 5]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Nelson George overview 20&quot;/&gt; The band toured [[Midwestern United States|the Midwest]] extensively from 1966 to 1968, frequently performing at a string of black clubs known as the &quot;[[chitlin' circuit]]&quot;, where they often opened [[striptease]]s and other adult acts. In 1966, they won a major local talent show with renditions of [[Motown]] hits and [[James Brown]]'s &quot;[[I Got You (I Feel Good)]]&quot;, led by Michael.&lt;ref name=&quot;RRHF&quot;/&gt;

The Jackson 5 recorded several songs, including &quot;[[Big Boy (The Jackson 5 song)|Big Boy]]&quot;, for the local record label [[Steeltown Records|Steeltown]] in 1967, before signing with Motown Records in 1968.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nelson George overview 20&quot;/&gt; ''Rolling Stone'' magazine later described the young Michael as &quot;a prodigy&quot; with &quot;overwhelming musical gifts,&quot; writing that he &quot;quickly emerged as the main draw and lead singer.&quot;&lt;ref name=rollingstonebio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/michael-jackson/biography|title=Michael jackson bio|work=Rolling Stone|page=1|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group set a chart record when its first four singles (&quot;[[I Want You Back]]&quot;, &quot;[[ABC (song)|ABC]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Love You Save]]&quot;, and &quot;[[I'll Be There (The Jackson 5 song)|I'll Be There]]&quot;) peaked at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Nelson George overview 20&quot;/&gt; Between 1972 and 1975, Michael released four solo studio albums with Motown, among them ''[[Got to Be There]]'' and ''[[Ben (album)|Ben]]'', released as part of the Jackson&amp;nbsp;5 franchise, and producing successful singles such as &quot;[[Got to Be There (song)|Got to Be There]]&quot;, &quot;[[Ben (song)|Ben]]&quot;, and a remake of [[Bobby Day]]'s &quot;[[Rockin' Robin (song)|Rockin' Robin]]&quot;.

The Jackson 5 &quot;became a cutting-edge example of black crossover artists... five working-class black boys with [[afro]]s and [[Bell-bottoms|bell bottoms]], and they really didn't have to trade any of that stuff in order to become mainstream stars.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Overcoming racial barriers&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/Music/06/28/michael.jackson.black.community/|title=Michael Jackson Broke Down Racial Barriers|last=Alban|first=Debra|date=June 28, 2009|work=Black in America 2|publisher=CNN|accessdate=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group's sales began declining in 1973, and the band members chafed under Motown's strict refusal to allow them creative control or input. Although they scored several top&amp;nbsp;40 hits, including the top&amp;nbsp;5 [[disco]] single &quot;[[Dancing Machine]]&quot; and the top&amp;nbsp;20 hit &quot;[[I Am Love (song)|I Am Love]]&quot;, the Jackson&amp;nbsp;5 left Motown in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson George overview 22&quot;/&gt;

===Move to Epic and ''Off the Wall'' (1975–81)===
In June 1975, the Jackson 5 signed with [[Epic Records]], a subsidiary of [[Sony Music Entertainment|CBS Records]]&lt;ref name = &quot;Nelson George overview 22&quot;/&gt; and renamed themselves the Jacksons. Younger brother Randy formally joined the band around this time, while Jermaine left to pursue a solo career.&lt;ref name=&quot;tara 138–144&quot;/&gt; They continued to tour internationally, releasing six more albums between 1976 and 1984, during which Michael was the lead songwriter, writing hits such as &quot;[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]&quot;, &quot;[[This Place Hotel]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Can You Feel It]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RRHF&quot; /&gt; In 1978, he starred as the [[Scarecrow (Oz)|scarecrow]] in the musical, ''[[The Wiz (film)|The Wiz]]'', a box-office disaster. It was here that he teamed up with [[Quincy Jones]], who was arranging the film's musical score. Jones agreed to produce Jackson's next solo album, ''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson George overview 23&quot;/&gt; In 1979, Jackson broke his nose during a complex dance routine. His subsequent [[rhinoplasty]] was not a complete success; he complained of breathing difficulties that would affect his career. He was referred to Dr. [[Steven Hoefflin]], who performed Jackson's second rhinoplasty and subsequent operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;tara 205–210&quot;/&gt;

Jones and Jackson produced the ''Off the Wall'' album together. Songwriters for the album included Jackson, [[Rod Temperton]], [[Stevie Wonder]], and [[Paul McCartney]]. Released in 1979, it was the first solo album to generate four U.S. top&amp;nbsp;10 hits, including the chart-topping singles &quot;[[Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough]]&quot; and &quot;[[Rock with You (Michael Jackson song)|Rock with You]]&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nelson George overview 37-38&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MichaelJacksonIsBorn&quot;/&gt; It reached number three on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and eventually sold over {{Nowrap|20 million}} copies worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Off the Wall {{Nowrap|20 million}}&quot;&gt;[http://www.virginmedia.com/music/classicalbums/michaeljackson-offthewall.php Michael Jackson: Off the Wall], [[Virgin Media]]. Retrieved December 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980, Jackson won three awards at the [[American Music Awards]] for his solo efforts: Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Album, Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Male Artist, and Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Single for &quot;Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMAs 1980&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMAs 1980 2&quot;/&gt; That year, he also won [[Billboard Year-End]] for Top Black Artist and Top Black Album and a Grammy Award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance, also for &quot;Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson George overview 37-38&quot;/&gt; Jackson again won at the American Music Awards in 1981 for Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Album and Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Male Artist.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMAs 1981&quot;/&gt; Despite its commercial success, Jackson felt ''Off the Wall'' should have made a much bigger impact, and was determined to exceed expectations with his next release.&lt;ref name=&quot;taraborrelli2&quot;/&gt; In 1980, he secured the highest [[Royalties|royalty]] rate in the music industry: 37 percent of wholesale album profit.&lt;ref name=&quot;taraborrelli3&quot;/&gt;

===''Thriller'' and ''Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever'' (1982–83)===
In 1982, Jackson contributed the song &quot;Someone In the Dark&quot; to the [[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (album)|storybook]] for the film ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]''; the record won a Grammy for Best Recording for Children in 1984. In the same year he won another seven Grammys and eight American Music Awards (including the Award of Merit, the youngest artist to win it), making him the most awarded artist in one night for both award shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;MJ Grammy's&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMAs 1984&quot;/&gt; These awards were thanks to the ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]'' album, released in late 1982, which was 1983's best-selling album worldwide&lt;ref name=&quot;Thriller best seller&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thriller best seller 1&quot;/&gt; and became the best-selling album of all time in the United States,&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA certification&quot;/&gt; as well as the [[List of best-selling albums worldwide|best-selling album of all time worldwide]], selling an estimated {{Nowrap|110 million}} copies so far.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thriller {{Nowrap|110 million}} copies&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/china/learningenglish/specials/1430_jackson_photo/page7.shtml |title=Michael Jackson Photo Gallery 迈克•杰克逊影集 |work=[[BBC News|BBC China]] |accessdate=July 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart for 37 weeks and was in the top&amp;nbsp;10 of the 200 for 80 consecutive weeks. It was the first album to have seven ''Billboard'' Hot&amp;nbsp;100 top&amp;nbsp;10 singles, including &quot;[[Billie Jean]]&quot;, &quot;[[Beat It]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Wanna Be Startin' Somethin']]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;lewis&quot;/&gt; ''Thriller'' was certified for 29&amp;nbsp;million shipments by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], giving it [[List of music recording certifications|Double Diamond]] status in the United States. The album won also another Grammy for Best Engineered Recording&amp;nbsp;– Non Classical in 1984, awarding [[Bruce Swedien]] for his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce Grammy's&quot;/&gt;

Jackson's attorney [[John Branca]] noted that Jackson had the highest royalty rate in the music industry at that point: approximately $2 for every album sold. He was also making record-breaking profits from sales of his recordings. The videocassette of the documentary ''The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller'' sold over 350,000 copies in a few months. The era saw the arrival of novelties like dolls modeled after Michael Jackson, which appeared in stores in May 1984 at a price of $12.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME&quot;/&gt; Biographer [[J. Randy Taraborrelli]] writes that, &quot;''Thriller'' stopped selling like a leisure item—like a magazine, a toy, tickets to a hit movie—and started selling like a household staple.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tara 226&quot;/&gt; In 1985, ''The Making of Michael Jackson's Thriller'' won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Longform.&lt;ref name = &quot;MJ Grammy's&quot;/&gt; In December 2009, the music video for &quot;Thriller&quot; was selected for the [[National Film Registry]] by the [[Library of Congress]], &quot;Thriller&quot; is the first (and currently only) music video ever to be inducted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Jackson Thriller Induction&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters: U.S. registry 2009-12-30&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;'Thriller' Video Added to U.S. Film Registry&quot;/&gt;

''Time'' described Jackson's influence at that point as &quot;Star of records, radio, rock video. A one-man rescue team for the music business. A songwriter who sets the beat for a decade. A dancer with the fanciest feet on the street. A singer who cuts across all boundaries of taste and style and color too&quot;.&lt;ref name=TIME/&gt; ''The New York Times'' wrote that, &quot;in the world of pop music, there is Michael Jackson and there is everybody else&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimes&quot;/&gt; 

On March 25, 1983, Michael Jackson reunited with his brothers for a legendary live performance which was taped for a ''[[Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever]]'' television special. The show aired on May 16, 1983, to an audience of {{Nowrap|47 million}} viewers, and featured the Jacksons and a number of other Motown stars. It is best remembered for Jackson's solo performance of &quot;Billie Jean&quot; which gave him his first Emmy nomination.&lt;ref name=&quot;emmys.tv&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.tv/news/2009/fatal-cardiac-arrest-strikes-michael-jackson |title=Fatal Cardiac Arrest Strikes Michael Jackson |publisher=Emmys.tv |date=June 25, 2009 |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wearing a distinctive black [[sequin]] jacket and golf glove decorated with rhinestones, he debuted his signature dance move, the [[moonwalk (dance)|moonwalk]], which former [[Soul Train]] dancer and [[Shalamar]] member [[Jeffrey Daniel]] had taught him three years before. The Jacksons' performance drew comparisons to [[Elvis Presley]]'s and [[The Beatles]]' appearances on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;taraborrelli4&quot;/&gt; Anna Kisselgoff of ''The New York Times'' later wrote, &quot;The moonwalk that he made famous is an apt metaphor for his dance style. How does he do it? As a technician, he is a great illusionist, a genuine mime. His ability to keep one leg straight as he glides while the other bends and seems to walk requires perfect timing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dancing feet of Michael Jackson&quot;/&gt;

On January 27, 1984, Michael and other members of the Jacksons filmed a Pepsi Cola commercial, overseen by executive [[Phil Dusenberry]],&lt;ref name=&quot;nytt&quot;/&gt; from ad agency [[BBDO]] and Pepsi's Worldwide Creative Director, [[Alan Pottasch]] at the [[Shrine Auditorium]] in Los Angeles. In front of a full house of fans during a simulated concert, pyrotechnics accidentally set Jackson's hair on fire. He suffered second-degree burns to his scalp. Jackson underwent treatment to hide the scars on his scalp, and he also had his third [[rhinoplasty]] shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name = &quot;tara 205–210&quot;/&gt; Jackson never recovered from this injury. Pepsi settled out of court, and Jackson donated his $1.5&amp;nbsp;million settlement to the Brotman Medical Center in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]], California, which now has a &quot;Michael Jackson Burn Center&quot; in honor of his donation.&lt;ref name=&quot;tara 279–287&quot;/&gt; Dusenberry later recounted the episode in his memoir, ''Then We Set His Hair on Fire: Insights and Accidents from a Hall of Fame Career in Advertising''.

On May 14, 1984, Jackson was invited to the White House to receive an award from President [[Ronald Reagan]] for his support of charities that helped people overcome alcohol and drug abuse.&lt;ref name=&quot;taraborrelli5&quot;/&gt; Jackson won eight awards during the Grammys that year. Unlike later albums, ''Thriller'' did not have an official tour to promote it, but the 1984 [[Victory Tour (The Jacksons tour)|Victory Tour]], headlined by The Jacksons, showcased much of Jackson's new solo material to more than two million Americans. He donated all the funds (around {{Nowrap|$8 million}}) raised from the Victory Tour to charity.&lt;ref name=&quot;taraborrelli6&quot;/&gt; He also co-wrote the charity single &quot;[[We Are the World]]&quot; in 1985 with [[Lionel Richie]], which was released worldwide to aid the poor in the U.S. and Africa. It became one of the best-selling singles of all time, with nearly 30&amp;nbsp;million copies sold and millions of dollars donated to famine relief. In 1986, &quot;We Are the World&quot; won four Grammys (one for Jackson for Song of the Year). American Music Award directors removed the charity song from the competition because they felt it would be inappropriate, but recognized it with two special honors: one for the creation of the song and one for the [[USA for Africa]] idea. Michael won the award for the creation of the song.&lt;ref name=&quot;USA for Africa Grammy's&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMAs 1986&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMAs 1986 2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;taraborrelli7&quot;/&gt;

In 1984, [[ATV Music Publishing]], which had the copyrights to nearly 4000 songs, including the [[Northern Songs]] catalog that contained the majority of the [[Lennon–McCartney]] compositions recorded by [[The Beatles]], was put up for sale by [[Robert Holmes à Court]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hilburn&quot;/&gt; Jackson had become interested in owning [[music catalog]]s after working with Paul McCartney in the early 1980s. Jackson had learned McCartney made approximately $40&amp;nbsp;million a year from other people's songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;jdoyle&quot;/&gt; In 1981,&lt;ref name=&quot;tara 333-338&quot;/&gt; McCartney was offered the ATV music catalog for £20 million ($40 million).&lt;ref name=&quot;jdoyle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcca atv&quot;/&gt; According to McCartney, he contacted [[Yoko Ono]] about making a joint purchase by splitting the cost equally at £10 million each, but Ono thought they could buy it for £5 million each.&lt;ref name=&quot;jdoyle&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcca atv&quot; /&gt; When they were unable to make the joint purchase, McCartney let the offer fall through, not wanting to be the sole owner of the Beatles' songs.&lt;ref name = &quot;tara 333-338&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcca atv&quot;/&gt;

According to a negotiator for Holmes à Court in the 1984 sale, &quot;We had given Paul McCartney first right of refusal but Paul didn't want it at that time.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ch7news&quot;/&gt; Also, an attorney for McCartney assured Jackson's attorney, John Branca, that McCartney was not interested in bidding: McCartney reportedly said &quot;It's too pricey&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jdoyle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;tara 333-338&quot;/&gt; But there were several other companies and investors bidding. In September 1984, Jackson was first informed about the sale by Branca and sent a bid of $46 million on November 20, 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;hilburn&quot; /&gt; Jackson's agents thought they had a deal several times, but encountered new bidders or new areas of debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;hilburn&quot; /&gt; In May 1985, Jackson's team walked away from talks after having spent over $1 million on four months of [[due diligence]] and on the negotiations.&lt;ref name=&quot;hilburn&quot; /&gt;

In June 1985, Jackson and Branca learned that [[Charles Koppelman]]'s and Marty Bandier's The Entertainment Co. had made a tentative agreement with Holmes à Court to buy ATV Music for $50 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;hilburn&quot; /&gt; But in early August, Holmes à Court's team contacted Jackson and talks resumed. Jackson raised his bid to $47.5 million and it was accepted because he could close the deal more quickly, having already completed due diligence of ATV Music.&lt;ref name=&quot;hilburn&quot; /&gt; He also agreed to visit Holmes à Court in Australia, where he would appear on the [[Channel Seven Perth Telethon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hilburn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ch7news&quot;/&gt; Jackson's [[ATV Music Publishing#Acquisition|purchase of ATV Music]] was finalized August 10, 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;hilburn&quot;/&gt;

Jackson's skin had been a medium-brown color for the entire duration of his youth, but starting in the mid-1980s, it gradually grew paler. The change gained widespread media coverage, including rumors that he might be bleaching his skin.&lt;ref name=&quot;campbell (1995) 14-16&quot;/&gt; According to [[J. Randy Taraborrelli]]'s biography, in 1986, Jackson was diagnosed with [[vitiligo]] and [[Systemic lupus erythematosus|lupus]]; the vitiligo partially lightened his skin, and the lupus was in [[remission (medicine)|remission]]; both illnesses made him sensitive to sunlight. The treatments he used for his condition further lightened his skin tone, and, with the application of pancake makeup to even out blotches, he could appear very pale.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taraborrelli&quot;/&gt; Jackson was also diagnosed with vitiligo in his autopsy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Jackson case report&quot;/&gt; By the mid-1990s several surgeons speculated that he had undergone various nasal surgeries, a forehead lift, thinned lips, and cheekbone surgery—although Jackson denied this and insisted that he only had surgery on his nose.&lt;ref name=&quot;abcnews&quot;/&gt; Jackson claimed that he had only two rhinoplasties and no other surgery on his face, although at one point he mentioned having a dimple created in his chin.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson 229-230&quot;/&gt; Jackson lost weight in the early 1980s because of a change in diet and a desire for &quot;a dancer's body&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson 229-230&quot; /&gt; Witnesses reported that he was often dizzy and speculated that he was suffering from [[anorexia nervosa]]; periods of weight loss would become a recurring problem later in life.&lt;ref name=&quot;tara 312–313&quot;/&gt;

During the course of his treatment, Jackson made two close friends: his dermatologist, Dr. [[Arnold Klein]], and Klein's nurse [[Debbie Rowe]]. Rowe eventually became Jackson's second wife and the mother of his two eldest children. He also relied heavily on Klein for medical and business advice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Jackson Secret Boyfriend Claims Draw Fury&quot;/&gt;

Jackson became the subject of increasingly sensational reports. In 1986, the tabloids ran a story claiming that Jackson slept in a [[hyperbaric medicine|hyperbaric oxygen chamber]] to slow the aging process; he was pictured lying down in a glass box. Although the claim was untrue, according to tabloid reports that are widely cited, Jackson had disseminated the fabricated story himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;tara 355-361&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC, Jackson's image problems&quot;/&gt; When Jackson bought a chimpanzee called [[Bubbles (chimpanzee)|Bubbles]] from a laboratory, he was reported to be increasingly detached from reality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Is Michael Jackson for Real?&quot;/&gt; It was reported that Jackson had offered to buy the bones of [[Joseph Merrick]] (the &quot;elephant man&quot;) and although untrue, Jackson did not deny the story.&lt;ref name = &quot;tara 355-361&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC, Jackson's image problems&quot;/&gt; Although initially he saw these stories as opportunities for publicity, he stopped leaking untruths to the press as they became more sensational. Consequently the media began making up their own stories.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC, Jackson's image problems&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tara 370–373&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newswatch Magazine&amp;nbsp;– The Man, His Weird Ways&quot;/&gt; These reports became embedded in the public consciousness, inspiring the nickname &quot;Wacko Jacko&quot;, which Jackson came to despise.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson8&quot;/&gt; Responding to the gossip, Jackson remarked to Taraborrelli:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Why not just tell people I'm an alien from Mars? Tell them I eat live chickens and do a voodoo dance at midnight. They'll believe anything ''you'' say, because ''you're a reporter''. But if I, Michael Jackson, were to say, &quot;I'm an alien from Mars and I eat live chickens and do a voodoo dance at midnight,&quot; people would say, &quot;Oh, man, that Michael Jackson is ''nuts''. He's cracked up. You can't believe a single word that comes out of his mouth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;taraborrelli9&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jackson collaborated with [[George Lucas]] and [[Francis Ford Coppola]] on the 17-minute [[3-D film]] ''[[Captain EO]]'', which debuted in September 1986 at both the original [[Disneyland]] and at [[EPCOT]] in Florida, and in March 1987 at [[Tokyo Disneyland]]. The $30 million movie was a popular attraction at all three parks. A Captain EO attraction was later featured at [[Disneyland Park (Paris)|Euro Disneyland]] after that park opened in 1992. All four parks' Captain EO installations stayed open well into the 1990s: the Paris installation was the last one to close, in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson George overview 41&quot;/&gt; The attraction would later return to Disneyland in 2010 after Jackson's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Captain EO is Back to Change the World – Movies News at IGN&quot;/&gt;

In 1987, Jackson disassociated himself from the [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], in response to their disapproval of the ''Thriller'' video.&lt;ref name=&quot;ebony1&quot;/&gt; With the industry expecting another major hit, Jackson's first album in five years, ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'' (1987), was highly anticipated.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME2&quot;/&gt; It did not top ''Thriller'' as a commercial or artistic triumph, but ''Bad'' was still a substantial success in its own right.

The ''[[Bad (album)|Bad]]'' album spawned seven hit singles in the U.S., five of which (&quot;[[I Just Can't Stop Loving You]]&quot;, &quot;[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]&quot;, &quot;[[The Way You Make Me Feel]]&quot;, &quot;[[Man in the Mirror]]&quot; and &quot;[[Dirty Diana]]&quot;) reached number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot&amp;nbsp;100 charts. This was a record for most number one Hot 100 singles from any one album, including ''Thriller.''&lt;ref name=&quot;A life in the spotlight—cnn&quot;/&gt; Although the title track's video was arguably derivative of the video for the earlier single &quot;[[Beat It]]&quot;, the [[Bad (Michael Jackson song)#Music video|&quot;Bad&quot; video]] still proved to be one of Jackson's iconic moments. It was a gritty but colorful epic set against the backdrop of the [[New York City Subway]] system, with costuming and choreography inspired by ''[[West Side Story]].'' As of 2012, the album sold between 30 to 45 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Telegraph Bad 25&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/michael-jackson/8879265/Michael-Jackson-Bad-album-set-for-re-release.html|title=Michael Jackson Bad album set for re-release |accessdate=May 25, 2012 |publisher=Telegraphy|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NME Bad&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/photos/50-fastest-selling-albums-ever/213617/40/1|title=50 fastest selling albums ever |accessdate=May 25, 2012 |work=NME|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV Bad&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1651633/michael-jacksons-new-album-cover-decoded.jhtml|title = Michael Jackson's New Album Cover Decoded Painting is packed with iconic MJ images

The [[Bad (tour)|Bad]] world tour began on September 12 that year, finishing on January 14, 1989.&lt;ref name = &quot;lewis 95-96&quot;/&gt; In Japan alone, the tour had 14 sellouts and drew 570,000 people, nearly tripling the previous record of 200,000 in a single tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;WashPost&quot;/&gt; Jackson broke a ''Guinness World Record'' {{citation}} when 504,000 people attended seven sold-out shows at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]]. He performed a total of 123 concerts to an audience of 4.4&amp;nbsp;million people. The Bad Tour turned out to be the last of Jackson's concert tours to include shows in the continental United States, although later tours did make it to Hawaii.

In 1988, Jackson released his only autobiography, ''[[Moonwalk (book)|Moonwalk]]'', which took four years to complete and sold 200,000 copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Remembering Michael&quot;/&gt; Jackson wrote about his childhood, [[The Jackson 5]], and the abuse he had suffered.&lt;ref name=&quot;jackson10&quot;/&gt; He also wrote about his facial appearance, saying he had had two rhinoplastic surgeries and a [[cleft chin|dimple]] created in his chin.&lt;ref name = &quot;jackson 229-230&quot;/&gt; He attributed much of the change in the structure of his face to [[puberty]], weight loss, a strict vegetarian diet, a change in hair style, and stage lighting.&lt;ref name = &quot;jackson 229-230&quot;/&gt; ''Moonwalk'' reached the top position on ''The New York Times'' best sellers' list.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson George overview 42&quot;/&gt; The musician then released a film called ''[[Moonwalker]]'', which featured live footage and short films that starred Jackson and [[Joe Pesci]]. The film was originally intended to be released to theaters, but due to financial issues, the film was released [[direct-to-video]]. It saw a theatrical release in Germany, though. It debuted atop the ''Billboard'' Top Music Video Cassette chart, staying there for 22 weeks. It was eventually knocked off the top spot by ''Michael Jackson: The Legend Continues''.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nelson George overview 43-44&quot;/&gt;

In March 1988, Jackson purchased land near [[Santa Ynez, California|Santa Ynez]], California, to build [[Neverland Ranch]] at a cost of $17&amp;nbsp;million. He installed [[Ferris wheel]]s, a [[menagerie]], and a movie theater on the {{convert|2700|acre|km2|sing=on}} property. A security staff of 40 patrolled the grounds. In 2003, it was valued at approximately $100&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday finances&quot;/&gt; In 1989, his annual earnings from album sales, endorsements, and concerts was estimated at $125&amp;nbsp;million for that year alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Records&quot;/&gt; Shortly afterwards, he became the first Westerner to appear in a television ad in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Nelson George overview 43-44&quot;/&gt;

His success resulted in his being dubbed the &quot;[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|King of Pop]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;broadcasting&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Jackson coronated latest king of rock 'n' roll&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Is the thrill gone for singer Michael Jackson?&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Jackson's Black or White Blues&quot;/&gt;

===''Dangerous'', Heal the World Foundation and Super Bowl XXVII (1991–93)===
In March 1991, Jackson renewed his contract with Sony for $65 million, a record-breaking deal at the time,&lt;ref name=&quot;mtv&quot;/&gt; displacing [[Neil Diamond]]'s renewal contract with [[Columbia Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Deal record&quot;/&gt; He released his eighth album ''[[Dangerous (Michael Jackson album)|Dangerous]]'' in 1991. As of 2008, ''Dangerous'' had shipped seven million copies in the U.S. and had sold 32&amp;nbsp;million copies worldwide. The ''Dangerous'' album was co-produced by [[Teddy Riley (producer)|Teddy Riley]], one of the pioneers of &quot;[[new jack swing]]&quot; which convinced Michael to feature a [[Rapping|rapper]] on his album for the first time, the act worked and it turned out to be the best-selling album associated with that movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA certifications&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dangerous 32 million copies worldwide&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;New jack swing&quot;/&gt; In the United States, the album's first single &quot;[[Black or White]]&quot; was its biggest hit, reaching number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot&amp;nbsp;100 and remaining there for seven weeks, with similar chart performances worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;KOP achievements&quot;/&gt; The album's second single &quot;[[Remember the Time]]&quot; spent eight weeks in the top five in the United States, peaking at number three on the ''Billboard'' Hot&amp;nbsp;100 singles chart.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nelson George overview 45-46&quot;/&gt; At the end of 1992, ''Dangerous'' was awarded 1992's best-selling album worldwide and &quot;Black or White&quot; was awarded 1992's best-selling single worldwide at the Billboard Music Awards. Additionally, he won an award as best-selling artist of the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Best 1992&quot;/&gt; In 1993, Jackson performed the song at the [[Soul Train Music Awards]] in a chair, saying he had suffered an injury in rehearsals.&lt;ref name=&quot;taraborrelli12&quot;/&gt; In the UK and other parts of Europe, &quot;[[Heal the World]]&quot; was the biggest hit from the album; it sold 450,000 copies in the UK and spent five weeks at number two in 1992.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nelson George overview 45-46&quot;/&gt;

Jackson founded the [[Heal the World Foundation]] in 1992. The charity organization brought underprivileged children to Jackson's ranch to enjoy theme park rides that Jackson had built on the property. The foundation also sent millions of dollars around the globe to help children threatened by war, poverty, and disease. In the same year Jackson published his second book, the bestselling collection of poetry, ''[[Dancing the Dream]]''. While it was a commercial success and revealed a more intimate side to Jackson's nature, the collection was mostly critically unacclaimed at the time of release. In 2009, the book was republished by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]] and was more positively received by some critics in the wake of Jackson's untimely death. The [[Dangerous World Tour]] grossed {{Nowrap|$100 million}}. The tour began on June 27, 1992, and finished on November 11, 1993. Jackson performed to 3.5&amp;nbsp;million people in 70 concerts.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nelson George overview 45-46&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson to Tour Overseas&quot;/&gt; He sold the broadcast rights to his ''Dangerous'' world tour to [[HBO]] for $20&amp;nbsp;million, a record-breaking deal that still stands.&lt;ref name=&quot;taraborrelli13&quot;/&gt;

Following the illness and death of [[Ryan White]], Jackson helped draw public attention to HIV/AIDS, something that was still controversial at the time. He publicly pleaded with the [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]] at Bill Clinton's Inaugural Gala to give more money to HIV/AIDS charities and research.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stars line up for Clinton celebration&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Facing the music and the masses at the presidential gala&quot;/&gt; In a high-profile visit to Africa, Jackson visited several countries, among them [[Gabon]] and [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ebony&quot;/&gt; His first stop to Gabon was greeted with a sizable and enthusiastic reception of more than 100,000 people, some of them carrying signs that read, &quot;Welcome Home Michael.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ebony/&gt; In his trip to [[Côte d'Ivoire]], Jackson was crowned &quot;King Sani&quot; by a tribal chief.&lt;ref name=Ebony/&gt; He then thanked the dignitaries in French and English, signed official documents formalizing his kingship and sat on a golden throne while presiding over ceremonial dances.&lt;ref name=Ebony/&gt;

In January 1993, Jackson made a memorable appearance at the halftime show at [[Super Bowl&amp;nbsp;XXVII]]. The performance began with Jackson catapulting onto the stage as fireworks went off behind him. As he landed on the canvas, he maintained a motionless &quot;clenched fist, standing statue stance&quot;, dressed in a gold and black military outfit and sunglasses; he remained completely motionless for a minute and a half while the crowd cheered. He then slowly removed his sunglasses, threw them away and sang four songs: &quot;[[Jam (song)|Jam]]&quot;, &quot;Billie Jean&quot;, &quot;Black or White&quot; and &quot;Heal the World&quot;. It was the first Super Bowl where the audience figures increased during the half-time show, and was viewed by 135&amp;nbsp;million Americans alone; Jackson's ''Dangerous'' album rose 90 places up the album chart.&lt;ref name = &quot;campbell (1995) 14-16&quot;/&gt; Jackson was given the &quot;Living Legend Award&quot; at the [[35th Grammy Awards]] in Los Angeles. &quot;Black or White&quot; was Grammy-nominated for best vocal performance. &quot;Jam&quot; gained two nominations: Best R&amp;B Vocal Performance and Best R&amp;B Song.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nelson George overview 45-46&quot;/&gt; The ''Dangerous'' album won a Grammy for Best Engineered&amp;nbsp;– Non Classical, awarding the work of Bruce Swedien and Teddy Riley. In the same year, Michael Jackson won three American Music Awards for Favorite Pop/Rock Album (''Dangerous''), Favorite Soul/R&amp;B Single (&quot;[[Remember the Time]]&quot;) and was the first to win the International Artist Award, for his global performances and humanitarian concerns. This award will bear his name in the future.&lt;ref name = &quot;MJ Grammy's&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Bruce Grammy's&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMAs 1993&quot;/&gt;

Jackson gave a 90-minute interview to [[Oprah Winfrey]] on February 10, 1993, his second television interview since 1979. He grimaced when speaking of his childhood abuse at the hands of his father; he believed he had missed out on much of his childhood years, admitting that he often cried from loneliness. He denied tabloid rumors that he had bought the bones of [[Joseph Merrick|the Elephant Man]], slept in a [[hyperbaric]] oxygen chamber, or bleached his skin, stating for the first time that he had [[vitiligo]]. ''Dangerous'' re-entered the album chart in the top 10, more than a year after its original release.&lt;ref name = &quot;lewis 165-168&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;campbell (1995) 14-16&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Nelson George overview 45-46&quot;/&gt;

In the summer of 1993, Jackson was accused of [[child sexual abuse]] by a 13-year-old boy named Jordan Chandler and his father, Dr. Evan Chandler, a dentist.&lt;ref name=&quot;looking back on 1993&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tara 485-486&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tara 477-478&quot;/&gt; The Chandler family demanded payment from Jackson, and the singer initially refused. Jordan Chandler eventually told the police that Jackson had sexually abused him.&lt;ref name=&quot;tara 496-498&quot;/&gt;
Dr. Chandler was tape-recorded discussing his intention to pursue charges, saying, &quot;If I go through with this, I win big-time. There's no way I lose. I will get everything I want and they will be destroyed forever&amp;nbsp;... Michael's career will be over&quot;. Jordan's mother was, however, adamant that there had been no wrongdoing on Jackson's part.&lt;ref name=&quot;tara 477-478&quot;/&gt; Jackson later used the recording to argue that he was the victim of a jealous father whose only goal was to extort money from the singer.&lt;ref name = &quot;tara 477-478&quot;/&gt;

Later that year, on December 20, Jackson's home was raided by the police, and Jackson submitted to a 25-minute [[strip search]].&lt;ref name = &quot;tara 534-540&quot;/&gt; Jordan Chandler had reportedly given police a description of Jackson's [[intimate part]]s, notably claiming that his bleach-damaged [[human penis|penis]] was [[circumcision|circumcised]]; the strip search revealed, to the contrary, that Jackson was actually [[foreskin|uncircumcised]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Jackson Never Recovered from 1993 Police Strip Search&quot;/&gt; a fact confirmed in his autopsy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Autopsy of Jackson, Michael Joseph&quot;/&gt; His friends said he never recovered from the humiliation of the strip search.

In May 1994, Jackson married the daughter of [[Elvis Presley]], [[Lisa Marie Presley]]. They had first met in 1975, when a seven-year-old Presley attended one of Jackson's family engagements at the [[MGM Grand Hotel and Casino]], and were reconnected through a mutual friend.&lt;ref name=&quot;tara 500-507&quot;/&gt; According to a friend of Presley's, &quot;their adult friendship began in November 1992 in L.A.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gliatto&quot;/&gt; They stayed in contact every day over the telephone. As the child molestation accusations became public, Jackson became dependent on Presley for emotional support; she was concerned about his faltering health and addiction to drugs.&lt;ref name=&quot;tara 518–520&quot;/&gt; Presley explained, &quot;I believed he didn't do anything wrong and that he was wrongly accused and yes I started falling for him. I wanted to save him. I felt that I could do it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;taraborrelli15&quot;/&gt; She eventually persuaded him to settle the allegations out of court and go into rehabilitation to recover.&lt;ref name = &quot;tara 518–520&quot;/&gt;

Jackson proposed to Presley over the telephone towards the fall of 1993, saying, &quot;If I asked you to marry me, would you do it?&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;tara 518–520&quot;/&gt; They married in the [[Dominican Republic]] in secrecy, denying it for nearly two months afterwards.&lt;ref name=&quot;MJ &amp; Presley divorce&quot;/&gt; The marriage was, in her words, &quot;a married couple's life&amp;nbsp;... that was sexually active&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;taraborrelli16&quot;/&gt; At the time, the tabloid media speculated that the wedding was a ploy to prop up Jackson's public image.&lt;ref name=&quot;MJ &amp; Presley divorce&quot;/&gt; The marriage lasted less than two years and ended with an amicable divorce settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;tara 580–581&quot;/&gt; In a 2010 interview with Oprah, Presley admitted that they spent four more years after the divorce &quot;getting back together and breaking up&quot;, until she decided to stop.&lt;ref name=&quot;lmpoprah&quot;/&gt;

===''HIStory'', second marriage and fatherhood (1995–99)===
In 1995, Jackson merged his ATV Music catalog with Sony's music publishing division creating [[Sony/ATV Music Publishing]]. Jackson retained half-ownership of the company, earned $95&amp;nbsp;million upfront as well as [[List of Sony/ATV Music Publishing artists|the rights to even more songs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1995 music deal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sonydeal&quot;/&gt; He then released the double album ''[[HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book&amp;nbsp;I]]''. The first disc, ''HIStory Begins'', was a 15-track greatest hits album, and was later reissued as ''[[Greatest Hits: HIStory, Volume I]]'' in 2001, while the second disc, ''HIStory Continues'', contained 15 new songs. The album debuted at number one on the charts and has been certified for seven&amp;nbsp;million shipments in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Top 100 Albums (Page 2)&quot;/&gt; It is the best-selling multiple-disc album of all-time, with 20&amp;nbsp;million copies (40&amp;nbsp;million units) sold worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;KOP achievements&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HIStory {{Nowrap|20 million}} copies&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Laura |last=Putti |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2001/08/24/il-nuovo-michael-jackson-fa-un-tuffo.html |title=Il nuovo Michael Jackson fa un tuffo nel passato |work=La Repubblica |date=August 24, 2001 |accessdate=May 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''HIStory'' received a Grammy nomination for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Ultimate booklet 48–50&quot;/&gt;

&quot;[[Scream/Childhood]]&quot;. &quot;Scream&quot; was a duet, performed with Jackson's youngest sister [[Janet Jackson|Janet]]. The song fights against the media, mainly for what the media made him out to be during his 1993 child abuse allegations. The single had the highest debut on the ''Billboard''&amp;nbsp;Hot&amp;nbsp;100 at number five, and received a Grammy nomination for &quot;Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ultimate booklet 48–50&quot;/&gt; &quot;[[You Are Not Alone]]&quot; was the second single released from ''HIStory''; it holds the ''Guinness World Record'' for the first song ever to debut at number one on the ''Billboard''&amp;nbsp;Hot&amp;nbsp;100 chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Records&quot;/&gt; It was seen as a major artistic and commercial success, receiving a Grammy nomination for &quot;Best Pop Vocal Performance&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;Ultimate booklet 48–50&quot;/&gt; In late 1995, Jackson was rushed to a hospital after collapsing during rehearsals for a televised performance; the incident was caused by a stress-related [[panic attack]].&lt;ref name=&quot;taraborrelli17&quot;/&gt; &quot;[[Earth Song]]&quot; was the third single released from ''HIStory'', and topped the [[UK Singles Chart]] for six weeks over Christmas 1995; it sold a million copies, making it Jackson's most successful single in the UK.&lt;ref name = &quot;Ultimate booklet 48–50&quot;/&gt; The track &quot;[[They Don't Care About Us]]&quot; became controversial when the [[Anti-Defamation League]] and other groups criticized its allegedly [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] lyrics. Jackson quickly put out a revised version of the song without the offending lyrics.&lt;ref name=&quot;ADL&quot;/&gt; In 1996, Jackson won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form for &quot;Scream&quot; and an American Music Award for Favorite Pop/Rock Male Artist.&lt;ref name = &quot;MJ Grammy's&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMAs 1996&quot;/&gt;

The album was promoted with the successful [[HIStory World Tour]]. The tour began on September 7, 1996, and finished on October 15, 1997. Jackson performed 82 concerts in 58 cities to over 4.5&amp;nbsp;million fans, and grossed a total of {{Nowrap|$165 million}}. The show, which visited five continents and 35 countries, became Jackson's most successful in terms of audience figures.&lt;ref name=&quot;lewis 95-96&quot;/&gt; During the tour, Jackson married his [[Personal relationships of Michael Jackson#Debbie Rowe|longtime friend]] [[Debbie Rowe|Deborah Jeanne Rowe]], a dermatology nurse, in an impromptu ceremony in Sydney, Australia. Rowe was approximately six months pregnant with the couple's first child at the time. Originally, Rowe and Jackson had no plans to marry, but Jackson's mother Katherine persuaded them to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;taraborrelli18&quot;/&gt; Michael Joseph Jackson Jr (commonly known as Prince) was born on February 13, 1997; his sister Paris-Michael Katherine Jackson was born a year later on April 3, 1998.&lt;ref name = &quot;tara 580–581&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;taraborrelli19&quot;/&gt; The couple divorced in 1999, and Jackson got full custody of the children.

The proceeds went to the [[Nelson Mandela Children's Fund]], the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] and [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson &amp; Friends&quot;/&gt;

===Label dispute, ''Invincible'' and third child (2000–03)===
At the turn of the century, Jackson won an American Music Award as Artist of the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMAs Poll&quot;/&gt; Throughout 2000 and 2001, Jackson worked in the studio with Teddy Riley and [[Rodney Jerkins]], as well as other collaborators. These sessions would result in the album ''[[Invincible (Michael Jackson album)|Invincible]]'', released in October 2001. ''Invincible'' was Jackson's first full-length album in six years, and it would be the last album of new material he released while still alive. The release of the album was preceded by a dispute between Jackson and his record label, [[Sony Music Entertainment]]. Jackson had expected the licenses to the masters of his albums to revert to him sometime in the early 2000s. Once he had the licenses, he would be able to promote the material however he pleased and keep all the profits. However, due to various clauses in the contract, the revert date turned out to be many years away. Jackson discovered that the attorney who represented him in the deal was also representing Sony.&lt;ref name = &quot;tara 610–611&quot;/&gt; Jackson was also concerned about the fact that for a number of years, Sony had been pressuring him to sell his share in their music catalog venture. Jackson feared that Sony might have a conflict of interest, since if Jackson's career failed, he would have to sell his share of the catalog at a low price.&lt;ref name = &quot;tara 614–617&quot;/&gt; Jackson sought an early exit from his contract.&lt;ref name = &quot;tara 610–611&quot;/&gt; Just before the release of ''Invincible'', Jackson informed the head of Sony Music Entertainment, [[Tommy Mottola]], that he was leaving Sony.&lt;ref name = &quot;tara 610–611&quot;/&gt; As a result, all singles releases, video shootings and promotions concerning the ''Invincible'' album were suspended.

In September 2001, two [[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special|30th Anniversary concerts]] were held at Madison Square Garden to mark the singer's 30th year as a solo artist. Jackson appeared onstage alongside his brothers for the first time since 1984. The show also featured performances by [[Mýa]], [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher]], [[Whitney Houston]], [['N Sync]], [[Destiny's Child]], [[Monica (entertainer)|Monica]], Luther Vandross, and [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], among other artists.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nelson George overview 50-53&quot;/&gt; The second of the two shows took place the night before the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;/&gt; After 9/11, Jackson helped organize the [[United We Stand: What More Can I Give]] benefit concert at [[Robert F. Kennedy Memorial Stadium|RFK Stadium]] in Washington, D.C. The concert took place on October 21, 2001, and included performances from dozens of major artists, including Jackson, who performed his song &quot;[[What More Can I Give]]&quot; as the finale.&lt;ref name = &quot;tara 614–617&quot;/&gt; Jackson's solo performances were omitted from the televised version of the benefit concert, although he could still be seen singing background vocals. This omission happened because of contractual issues related to the earlier 30th Anniversary concerts: those concerts were boiled down into a two-hour TV special titled ''[[Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Special|Michael Jackson: 30th Anniversary Celebration]]'' which debuted in November 2001.

In spite of the events preceding its release, ''Invincible'' came out in October 2001 to much anticipation. ''Invincible'' proved to be a hit, debuting atop the charts in 13 countries and going on to sell approximately 13&amp;nbsp;million copies worldwide. It received double-platinum certification in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA certifications&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KOP achievements&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Invincible {{Nowrap|13 million}} copies&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Tamara |last=Conniff |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tamara-conniff/we-killed-michael-jackson_b_272174.html |title=We Killed Michael Jackson |work=Huffington Post |date=August 30, 2009 |accessdate=August 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the sales for ''Invincible'' were lower than those of his previous releases, due in part to a lack of promotion, no supporting world tour and the label dispute. The album also came out at a bad time for the music industry in general.&lt;ref name = &quot;tara 614–617&quot;/&gt; The album cost {{Nowrap|$30 million}} to record, not including promotional expenditures.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-February 7, 2008&quot; /&gt; ''Invincible'' spawned three singles, &quot;[[You Rock My World]]&quot;, &quot;[[Cry (Michael Jackson song)|Cry]]&quot; and &quot;[[Butterflies (Michael Jackson song)|Butterflies]]&quot;, the latter without a music video. Jackson alleged in July 2002 that Mottola was a &quot;devil&quot; and a &quot;racist&quot; who did not support his African-American artists, using them merely for his own personal gain.&lt;ref name=&quot;tara 614–617&quot;/&gt; He charged that Mottola had called his colleague [[Irv Gotti]] a &quot;fat [[nigger]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview with Jermaine Jackson&quot;/&gt; Sony refused to renew Jackson's contract, and claimed that a {{Nowrap|$25 million}} promotional campaign had failed because Jackson refused to tour in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-February 7, 2008&quot;/&gt;

{{anchor|Blanket Jackson}}
In 2002, Michael Jackson won his 22nd American Music Award for Artist of the Century.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMAs 2002&quot;/&gt; In the same year, Jackson's third child, Prince Michael Jackson&amp;nbsp;II (nicknamed &quot;Blanket&quot;) was born.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Jackson&quot;/&gt; The mother's identity is unknown, but Jackson has said the child was the result of [[artificial insemination]] from a [[surrogacy|surrogate mother]] and his own sperm.&lt;ref name=&quot;tara 599-600&quot;/&gt; On November 20 of that year, Jackson brought his newborn son onto the balcony of his room at the [[Hotel Adlon]] in Berlin, as fans stood below, holding him in his right arm, with a cloth loosely draped over the baby's face. The baby was briefly extended over a railing, four stories above ground level, causing widespread criticism in the media. Jackson later apologized for the incident, calling it &quot;a terrible mistake&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Balcony incident&quot;/&gt; Sony released ''[[Number Ones (Michael Jackson album)|Number Ones]]'', a compilation of Jackson's hits on CD and DVD. In the U.S., the album was certified triple platinum by the RIAA; in the UK it was certified six times platinum for shipments of at least {{Nowrap|1.2 million}} units.&lt;ref name=&quot;RIAA certifications&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BPI&quot;/&gt;

===Second child sexual abuse allegations and acquittal (2003–05)===
{{Further|Living with Michael Jackson|People v. Jackson}}
Beginning in May 2002, Jackson allowed a documentary film crew, led by British TV personality [[Martin Bashir]], to follow him around just about everywhere he went. Bashir's film crew was with Jackson during the &quot;baby-dangling incident&quot; in Berlin. The program was broadcast in March 2003 as ''[[Living with Michael Jackson]]'', and painted an extraordinarily unflattering portrait of the singer.

In a particularly controversial scene, Jackson was seen holding hands and discussing sleeping arrangements with a young boy.&lt;ref name=&quot;tara 640&quot;/&gt; As soon as the documentary aired, the Santa Barbara county attorney's office began a criminal investigation. Jackson was arrested in November 2003, and was charged with seven counts of child molestation and two counts of [[Alcoholic beverage#United States of America|administering an intoxicating agent]] in relation to the 13-year old boy shown in the film.&lt;ref name = &quot;tara 640&quot;/&gt; Jackson denied the allegations, saying the sleepovers were not sexual in nature. The ''[[People v. Jackson]]'' trial began on January 31, 2005, in [[Santa Maria, California|Santa Maria]], California, and lasted five months, until the end of May. On June 13, 2005, Jackson was acquitted on all counts.&lt;ref name=&quot;taraborrelli20&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Jackson health concerns&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Jackson jury reaches verdict&quot;/&gt; After the trial, in a highly publicized relocation he moved to the Persian Gulf island of [[Bahrain]], as a guest of [[Abdullah Bin Hamad Bin Isa Al-Khalifa|Sheikh Abdullah]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson settles down to his new life in the Persian Gulf&quot;/&gt; Bahrain was also where the family intended to send Jackson if he was convicted (though Jackson did not know about the plan), according to a statement by Jermaine Jackson printed in ''[[The Times]]'' of London in September 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jermaine Jackson reveals escape plan for Michael&quot;/&gt;

In March 2006, the main house at the Neverland Ranch was closed as a cost-cutting measure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson Closes Neverland House&quot;/&gt; There were numerous reports around that time that Jackson was having financial problems. Jackson had been delinquent on his repayments of a $270&amp;nbsp;million loan secured against his music publishing holdings, even though those holdings were reportedly making him as much as {{Nowrap|$75 million}} a year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Really Odd Facts About Michael Jackson&quot;/&gt; [[Bank of America]] sold the debt to [[Fortress Investment Group|Fortress Investments]]. Sony reportedly proposed a restructuring deal which would give them a future option to buy half of Jackson's stake in their jointly owned publishing company (leaving Jackson with a 25% stake).&lt;ref name=&quot;sonydeal&quot;/&gt; Jackson agreed to a Sony-backed refinancing deal in April 2006, although the exact details were not made public.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson strikes deal over loans&quot;/&gt; Jackson did not have a recording contract in place with Sony or any other major record label at the time.

In early 2006, there was an announcement that Jackson had signed a contract with a [[Bahrain]]-based startup called Two Seas Records. However, nothing ever came of that deal, and the CEO of Two Seas, [[Gut Records|Guy Holmes]], later stated that the deal had never been finalized.&lt;ref name=&quot;2seas-billboard&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2seas-bbc&quot;/&gt; Throughout 2006, Sony repackaged 20 singles from the 1980s and 1990s as the ''[[Visionary: The Video Singles|Michael Jackson: Visionary]]'' series, which subsequently became a [[box set]]. Most of those singles returned to the charts as a result. In September 2006, Jackson and his ex-wife Debbie Rowe confirmed reports that they had settled their long-running child custody suit. The terms were never made public. Jackson continued to be the custodial parent of the couple's two children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson settles with Ex wife&quot;/&gt; In October 2006, [[Fox News]] entertainment reporter Roger Friedman said that Jackson had been recording at a studio in rural [[County Westmeath|Westmeath, Ireland]]. It was not known at the time what Jackson might be working on, or who might be paying for the sessions, since his publicist had recently issued a statement claiming that he had left Two Seas.&lt;ref name=&quot;2seas-bbc&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Funding Jackson's Retreat to Irish Recording Studio?&quot;/&gt;

In November 2006, Jackson invited an ''[[Access Hollywood]]'' camera crew into the studio in Westmeath, and [[MSNBC]] broke the story that he was working on a new album, produced by [[will.i.am]] of [[The Black Eyed Peas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KOP achievements&quot;/&gt; Jackson performed at the [[2006 World Music Awards|World Music Awards]], in London on November 15, 2006, and accepted a Diamond Award for selling over {{Nowrap|100 million}} records.&lt;ref name=&quot;KOP achievements&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2006 World Music Awards&quot;/&gt; Jackson returned to the United States after Christmas 2006 to attend [[James Brown]]'s funeral in [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]], Georgia. He gave one of the eulogies, saying that &quot;James Brown is my greatest inspiration.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jb&quot;/&gt; In the spring of 2007, Jackson and Sony teamed up to buy yet another music publishing company: [[Famous Music|Famous Music LLC]], formerly owned by [[Viacom]]. This deal gave him the rights to songs by [[Eminem]], [[Shakira]] and [[Beck]], among others.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007 music deal&quot;/&gt; Jackson recorded extensively during this period in New York with songwriter and producer will.i.am and also in Las Vegas with producers [[Akon]] and [[RedOne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph-june09&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hitquarters.com&quot;/&gt; In March 2007, Jackson gave a brief interview to the [[Associated Press]] in Tokyo, where he said, &quot;I've been in the entertainment industry since I was 6 years old, and as [[Charles Dickens]] would say, 'It's been the best of times, the worst of times.' But I would not change my career&amp;nbsp;... While some have made deliberate attempts to hurt me, I take it in stride because I have a loving family, a strong faith and wonderful friends and fans who have, and continue, to support me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday&quot;/&gt;

In September 2007, Jackson was reportedly still working with will.i.am, but the album was apparently never completed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Will.i.am On Working With Michael Jackson&quot;/&gt; However, in 2008, Jackson and Sony released ''[[Thriller 25]]'' to mark the 25th anniversary of the original ''[[Thriller (album)|Thriller]]''. This album featured the previously unreleased song &quot;For All Time&quot; (an outtake from the original sessions) as well as remixes, where Jackson collaborated with younger artists who had been inspired by his work.&lt;ref name=&quot;National certifications for Thriller 25&quot;/&gt; Two of the remixes were released as singles with only modest success: &quot;[[The Girl Is Mine 2008]]&quot; (with [[will.i.am]]) and &quot;[[Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' 2008]]&quot; (with [[Akon]]). The first single was based on an early demo version, without [[Paul McCartney]].

[[File:NeverlandRides.jpg|thumb|left|alt=An aerial view of land that has roads and many rides |An aerial view of part of Jackson's 2,800 acre Neverland Valley Ranch near Los Olivos, CA showing the many rides]]In late 2008, Fortress Investments threatened to foreclose on [[Neverland Ranch]], which Jackson used as collateral for loans running into many tens of millions of dollars. However, Fortress opted to sell Jackson's debts to [[Colony Capital|Colony Capital LLC]]. In November, Jackson transferred Neverland Ranch's title to Sycamore Valley Ranch Company LLC, which was a joint venture between Jackson and Colony Capital LLC. This deal cleared Jackson's debt, and he reportedly even gained an extra {{Nowrap|$35 million}} from the venture. At the time of his death, Jackson still owned a stake in Neverland/Sycamore Valley, but it is unknown how large that stake was.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neverland peters out for pop's Peter Pan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;association&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ten Most Expensive Michael Jackson Collectibles&quot;/&gt; In September 2008, Jackson entered negotiations with [[Julien's Auctions|Julien's Auction House]] to display and auction a large collection of memorabilia amounting to approximately 1,390 lots.

In March 2009, Jackson held a press conference at London's [[The O2 Arena (London)|O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Arena]] and announced a series of comeback concerts titled [[This Is It (Michael Jackson concerts)|This Is It]]. The shows would be Jackson's first major series of concerts since the HIStory World Tour finished in 1997. Jackson suggested possible retirement after the shows; he said it would be his &quot;final curtain call&quot;. The initial plan was for 10 concerts in London, followed by shows in Paris, New York City and [[Mumbai]]. Randy Phillips, president and chief executive of AEG Live, stated that the first 10 dates alone would earn the singer approximately {{Nowrap|£50 million}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Jackson grand finale curtain-raiser&quot;/&gt; The London residency was increased to 50 dates after record breaking ticket sales: over one million were sold in less than two hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rolling Stone 50 dates, {{Nowrap|1 million}} tickets&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|first=Daniel |last=Kreps |title=Michael Jackson's &quot;This Is It!&quot; Tour Balloons to 50-Show Run Stretching Into 2010 |publisher=Jann Wenner LLC |work=Rolling Stone |date=March 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson rehearsed in Los Angeles in the weeks leading up to the tour under the direction of choreographer [[Kenny Ortega]].

Jackson's first posthumous song released entirely by his Estate was titled &quot;[[This Is It (Michael Jackson song)|This Is It]]&quot; which Jackson cowrote in the 1980s with [[Paul Anka]]. It was not on the set lists for the concerts, and the recording was based on an old demo tape. The surviving brothers reunited in the studio for the first time since 1989 to record backing vocals. On October 28, 2009, a documentary film about the rehearsals titled ''[[Michael Jackson's This Is It]]'' was released.&lt;ref name=&quot;Judge Approves Michael Jackson Film&quot;/&gt; Even though it ran for a limited two-week engagement, it became the highest grossing documentary or concert movie of all time, with earnings of more than {{Nowrap|$260 million}} worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;boxofficemojo&quot;/&gt; Jackson's estate received 90% of the profits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Judge OKs Jackson performance film deal&quot;/&gt; The film was accompanied by a [[Michael Jackson's This Is It (album)|compilation album of the same name]]. Two versions of the new song appear on the album, which also featured original masters of Jackson's hits in the order in which they appear in the movie, along with a bonus disc with previously unreleased versions of more Jackson hits as well as a spoken-word poem titled &quot;Planet Earth&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Michael Jackson Song, Album Due In October&quot;/&gt; At the [[American Music Awards of 2009|2009 American Music Awards]] Jackson won four posthumous awards, two for him and two for his album ''Number Ones'', bringing his total American Music Awards to 26.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMAs MJ&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMAs 2009&quot;/&gt;

On June 25, 2009, Jackson died while in his bed at his rented mansion at 100 North Carolwood Drive in the [[Holmby Hills, Los Angeles|Holmby Hills]] district of Los Angeles. Attempts at resuscitating him by [[Conrad Murray]], his [[personal physician]], were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=&quot;Times6580897&quot;/&gt; [[Los Angeles Fire Department]] paramedics received a [[9-1-1|911]] call at 12:22 ([[Pacific Time Zone|PDT]], 19:22 UTC), arriving three minutes later at Jackson's location.&lt;ref name=&quot;Los Angeles Fire Department recording of the emergency phone call made from Michael Jackson's home&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Transcript of 911 call&quot;/&gt; He was reportedly not breathing and [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] was performed.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSNBC&quot;/&gt; Resuscitation efforts continued en route to the [[Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center]], and for more than an hour after arriving there at 1:13 (20:13&amp;nbsp;UTC).

The news spread quickly online, causing websites to slow down and [[Crash (computing)|crash]] from user overload. Both [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' suffered outages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rawlinson&quot;/&gt; [[Google]] initially believed that the input from millions of people searching for &quot;Michael Jackson&quot; meant that the search engine was under [[Distributed denial-of-service attack|DDoS attack]], and blocked searches related to Michael Jackson for 30 minutes. Twitter reported a crash, as did Wikipedia at {{Nowrap|3:15&amp;nbsp;pm}} PDT (22:15&amp;nbsp;UTC).&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc21&quot;/&gt; The [[Wikimedia Foundation]] reported nearly a million visitors to Jackson's biography within one hour, probably the most visitors in a one-hour period to any article in Wikipedia's history.&lt;ref name=&quot;wikipedia&quot;/&gt; [[AOL Instant Messenger]] collapsed for 40 minutes. AOL called it a &quot;seminal moment in Internet history&quot;, adding, &quot;We've never seen anything like it in terms of scope or depth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WoodJune27&quot;/&gt;

Michael Jackson was reported to be one of the largest owners of [[Extraterrestrial real estate|property on the moon]]. In 2005, he bought a 1,200 acre plot in the Lake of Dreams and owned a smaller parcel in the Sea of Vapours. After his death, a crater on the moon was renamed Michael Joseph Jackson by The Lunar Republic Society in Jackson's honor. The crater, officially named Posidonius J, is located on an area of the moon known as the Lake of Dreams, or Lacus Somniorum. The crater is 22 kilometers across and is situated near Jackson's owned land. A spokesman for the society said: &quot;The official designation of a Lunar crater is a singular honour bestowed upon only a select few luminaries. &quot;Among those receiving this rare tribute over the past century are Leonardo da Vinci, Christopher Columbus, Sir Isaac Newton, Julius Caesar and Jules Verne.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Jackson |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/michael-jackson/5784734/Moon-crater-named-after-Michael-Jackson.html |title=Moon crater named after Michael Jackson |publisher=Telegraph |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/28417/michael-jackson-to-have-moon-crater-named-after-him/ |title=Michael Jackson to have Moon Crater named after him |publisher=Inquisitr.com |date=July 6, 2009 |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jackson's music took root in [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]], pop and [[soul music|soul]]. He had been influenced by the work of contemporary musicians such as [[Little Richard]], [[James Brown]], [[Jackie Wilson]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Gene Kelly]],&lt;ref name=slateinfo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2012/08/23/gene_kelly_turns_100_the_dancer_s_legacy_persists_in_popular_dance_.html|title=Why People Still Dance Like Gene Kelly|publisher=slate.com|accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Ruffin]],&lt;ref name=rollingstonedavid&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/david-ruffin-19691231|title=100 Greatest Singers Of All Time|work=Rolling Stone|page=65|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Isley Brothers]], the [[Bee Gees]] and the [[West Side Story]] dancers, to whom he made a tribute in &quot;[[Beat It]]&quot; and in the &quot;Bad&quot; video.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones2005&quot;/&gt; According to [[David Winters (choreographer)|David Winters]], who met and befriended Jackson while choreographing the 1971 [[Diana Ross]] TV Special &quot;[[Diana!]]&quot;, (which was also Jackson's first solo debut outside of [[The Jackson 5]]), Jackson watched [[West Side Story]] almost every week and it was his favorite film.&lt;ref name=&quot;Magickpapers.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thank you BigBearJohn: here's also David Winters&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Remembering Michael Jackson, On Screen&quot;/&gt; While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson,&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Jackson saved my life&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb&quot;/&gt; James Brown was Jackson's greatest inspiration. In reference to Brown, Jackson declared: &quot;Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I had never seen a performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do for the rest of my life because of James Brown.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;James Brown&amp;nbsp;– Jackson Attends Brown's Public Funeral&amp;nbsp;– Contactmusic News&quot;/&gt;

The young Michael Jackson owed his vocal technique in large part to Diana Ross. Not only a mother figure to him, she was often observed in rehearsal as an accomplished performer. He later expressed: &quot;I got to know her well. She taught me so much. I used to just sit in the corner and watch the way she moved. She was art in motion. I studied the way she moved, the way she sang&amp;nbsp;– just the way she was.&quot; He told her: &quot;I want to be just like you, Diana.&quot; She said: &quot;You just be yourself.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;taraborrelli23&quot;/&gt; But Jackson owed part of his enduring style—especially his use of the ''oooh'' interjection—to Ross. From a young age, Jackson often punctuated his verses with a sudden exclamation of ''oooh''. Diana Ross had used this effect on many of the songs recorded with [[The Supremes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;taraborrelli24&quot;/&gt;

===Musical themes and genres===
Unlike many artists, Jackson did not write his songs on paper. Instead he would dictate into a sound recorder, and when recording he would sing the lyrics from memory.&lt;ref name=&quot;taraborrelli25&quot;/&gt; In most of his songs, such as &quot;[[Billie Jean]]&quot;, &quot;[[Who Is It (Michael Jackson song)|Who Is It]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Tabloid Junkie]]&quot;, he would beatbox and imitate the instruments using his voice instead of playing the actual instruments, along with other sounds. Jackson noted that it is easier to sing a drum line, or sing a bass, instead of playing a drum line or a bass with an instrument. Several critics have said that Jackson's distinct voice was able to replace any instrument convincingly. Steve Huey of [[Allmusic]] said that, throughout his solo career, Jackson's versatility allowed him to experiment with various themes and genres.&lt;ref name=allmusic/&gt; As a musician, he ranged from Motown's dance fare and ballads to [[techno]] and [[house music|house]]-edged [[new jack swing]] to work that incorporates both [[funk]] rhythms and [[hard rock]] guitar.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Help/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Thriller&quot;/&gt;

In the new jack swing-funk-rock efforts &quot;[[Scream/Childhood|Scream]]&quot; and &quot;Tabloid Junkie&quot;, along with the R&amp;B ballad &quot;[[You Are Not Alone]]&quot;, Jackson retaliates against the injustice and isolation he feels, and directs much of his anger at the media.&lt;ref name=&quot;RS HIStory&quot;/&gt; In the introspective ballad &quot;[[Stranger in Moscow]]&quot;, Jackson laments over his &quot;fall from grace&quot;, while songs like &quot;[[Earth Song]]&quot;, &quot;[[Scream/Childhood|Childhood]]&quot;, &quot;Little Susie&quot; and &quot;Smile&quot; are all operatic pop pieces.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALG HIStory&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RS HIStory&quot;/&gt; In the track &quot;[[D.S.

Of the song, Sneddon said, &quot;I have not—shall we say—done him the honor of listening to it, but I've been told that it ends with the sound of a gunshot&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sneddon profile&quot;/&gt; ''Invincible'' found Jackson working heavily with producer Rodney Jerkins.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;/&gt; It is a record made up of urban soul like &quot;[[Cry (Michael Jackson song)|Cry]]&quot; and &quot;The Lost Children&quot;, ballads such as &quot;[[Speechless (Michael Jackson song)|Speechless]]&quot;, &quot;Break of Dawn&quot; and &quot;[[Butterflies (Michael Jackson song)|Butterflies]]&quot; and mixes [[hip hop music|hip-hop]], pop and [[R&amp;B]] in &quot;2000 Watts&quot;, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; and &quot;Invincible&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ALG Invincible&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NME Invincible&quot;/&gt;

===Vocal style===
Jackson sang from childhood, and over time his voice and vocal style changed noticeably. Between 1971 and 1975, Jackson's voice descended from boy soprano to high tenor.&lt;ref name=&quot;brac 414&quot;/&gt; His vocal range as an adult was F2-E♭6. Jackson first used a technique called the &quot;vocal hiccup&quot; in 1973, starting with the song &quot;It's Too Late to Change the Time&quot; from [[The Jackson 5]]'s ''[[G.I.T.: Get It Together]]'' album.&lt;ref name=&quot;brown&quot;/&gt; Jackson did not use the hiccup technique— somewhat like a gulping for air or gasping— fully until the recording of ''[[Off the Wall (album)|Off the Wall]]'': it can be seen in full force in the &quot;[[Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground)]]&quot; promotional video.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nelson George overview 22&quot;/&gt; With the arrival of ''Off the Wall'' in the late 1970s, Jackson's abilities as a vocalist were well regarded. At the time, ''Rolling Stone'' compared his vocals to the &quot;breathless, dreamy stutter&quot; of Stevie Wonder. Their analysis was also that &quot;Jackson's feathery-timbred tenor is extraordinarily beautiful. It slides smoothly into a startling [[falsetto]] that's used very daringly&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG OTW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RS OTW&quot;/&gt; 1982 saw the release of ''Thriller'', and ''Rolling Stone'' was of the opinion that Jackson was then singing in a &quot;fully adult voice&quot; that was &quot;tinged by sadness&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RS Thriller&quot;/&gt;

A distinctive deliberate mispronunciation of &quot;come on&quot;, used frequently by Jackson, occasionally spelled &quot;cha'mone&quot; or &quot;shamone&quot;, is also a staple in impressions and caricatures of him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pink Grease&quot;/&gt; The turn of the 1990s saw the release of the introspective album ''Dangerous''. ''The New York Times'' noted that on some tracks, &quot;he gulps for breath, his voice quivers with anxiety or drops to a desperate whisper, hissing through clenched teeth&quot; and he had a &quot;wretched tone&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT Dangerous&quot;/&gt; When singing of brotherhood or self-esteem the musician would return to &quot;smooth&quot; vocals.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT Dangerous&quot;/&gt; When commenting on ''Invincible'', ''Rolling Stone'' were of the opinion that—at the age of 43—Jackson still performed &quot;exquisitely voiced rhythm tracks and vibrating vocal harmonies&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RS Invincible&quot;/&gt; Nelson George summed up Jackson's vocals by stating &quot;The grace, the aggression, the growling, the natural boyishness, the falsetto, the smoothness—that combination of elements mark him as a major vocalist&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson George overview 24&quot;/&gt;

===Music videos and choreography===
[[File:Lot 324 - Sofitel Macau MJ Gallery - Michael Jackson White Rhinestone Glove.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=A single whited crystal studded glave|The iconic crystal rhinestone studded glove worn by Jackson when performing the moonwalk on Motown 25]]Jackson has also been referred to as the King of Music Videos,&lt;ref name=&quot;collecters&quot;/&gt; Steve Huey of Allmusic observed how Jackson transformed the music video into an art form and a promotional tool through complex story lines, dance routines, special effects and famous cameo appearances; simultaneously breaking down racial barriers.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot; /&gt; Before ''Thriller'', Jackson struggled to receive coverage on MTV, allegedly because he was African American.&lt;ref name=&quot;blender&quot;/&gt; Pressure from CBS Records persuaded MTV to start showing &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and later &quot;Beat It&quot;, leading to a lengthy partnership with Jackson, also helping other black music artists gain recognition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson changes the rules of the music video&quot;/&gt; MTV employees deny any racism in their coverage, or pressure to change their stance. MTV maintains that they played rock music, regardless of race.&lt;ref name=&quot;findarticles&quot;/&gt; The popularity of his videos on MTV helped to put the relatively young channel &quot;on the map&quot;; MTV's focus shifted in favor of pop and R&amp;B.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABCNews&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson changes the rules of the music video&quot;/&gt; His performance on ''Motown 25: Yesterday, Today, Forever'' changed the scope of live stage show; &quot;That Jackson lip-synced 'Billie Jean' is, in itself, not extraordinary, but the fact that it did not change the impact of the performance is extraordinary; whether the performance was live or lip-synced made no difference to the audience&quot; thus creating an era in which artists re-create the spectacle of music video imagery on stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;MT25&quot;/&gt; Short films like ''[[Michael Jackson's Thriller|Thriller]]'' largely remained unique to Jackson, while the group dance sequence in &quot;Beat It&quot; has frequently been imitated.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Thriller Special Edition Audio&quot;/&gt; The choreography in ''Thriller'' has become a part of global pop culture, replicated everywhere from [[Cinema of India|Indian films]] to [[Thriller (viral video)|prisons in the Philippines]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Philippine jailhouse rocks to Thriller&quot;/&gt; The ''Thriller'' short film marked an increase in scale for music videos, and has been named the most successful music video ever by the ''Guinness World Records''.&lt;ref name=&quot;World Records&quot;/&gt;

In the 19-minute music video for &quot;[[Bad (Michael Jackson song)|Bad]]&quot;—directed by [[Martin Scorsese]]—Jackson began using sexual imagery and choreography not previously seen in his work. He occasionally grabbed or touched his chest, torso and crotch. When asked by Oprah in the 1993 interview about why he grabbed his crotch, he replied, &quot;I think it happens subliminally&quot; and he described it as something that was not planned, but rather, as something that was compelled by the music. &quot;Bad&quot; garnered a mixed reception from both fans and critics; ''Time'' magazine described it as &quot;infamous&quot;. The video also featured [[Wesley Snipes]]; in the future Jackson's videos would often feature famous cameo roles.&lt;ref name=&quot;tara 370–373&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Who's Bad? TIME&quot;/&gt; For &quot;[[Smooth Criminal]]&quot;, Jackson experimented with an innovative &quot;anti-gravity lean&quot; in his performances. The maneuver required special shoes for which he was granted U.S. Patent No. 5,255,452.&lt;ref name=&quot;tompkins&quot;/&gt; Although the music video for &quot;[[Leave Me Alone]]&quot; was not officially released in the US, in 1989, it was nominated for three ''Billboard'' Music Video Awards;&lt;ref&gt;Lisa D. Campbell, ''Michael Jackson: The King of Pop'', p. 273.&lt;/ref&gt; the same year it won a Golden Lion Award for the quality of the special effects used in its production. In 1990, &quot;Leave Me Alone&quot; won a Grammy for [[Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video|Best Music Video, Short Form]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson George overview 43-44&quot;/&gt;

He received the [[MTV Video Vanguard Award]] in 1988 and the MTV Video Vanguard Artist of the Decade Award in 1990 to celebrate his accomplishments in the art form in the 1980s; in 1991 the first award was renamed in his honor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson George overview 45-46&quot;/&gt; &quot;[[Black or White]]&quot; was accompanied by a controversial music video, which, on November 14, 1991, simultaneously premiered in 27 countries with an estimated audience of 500&amp;nbsp;million people, the largest viewing ever for a music video.&lt;ref name=&quot;KOP achievements&quot;/&gt; It featured scenes construed as having a sexual nature as well as depictions of violence. The offending scenes in the final half of the 14-minute version were edited out to prevent the video from being banned, and Jackson apologized.&lt;ref name=&quot;''Dangerous'' on Film&quot;/&gt; Along with Jackson, it featured [[Macaulay Culkin]], [[Peggy Lipton]] and [[George Wendt]]. It helped usher in [[morphing]] as an important technology in music videos.&lt;ref name=&quot;campbell26&quot;/&gt;

&quot;[[Remember the Time]]&quot; was an elaborate production, and became one of his longest videos at over nine minutes. Set in [[ancient Egypt]], it featured groundbreaking [[visual effects]] and appearances by [[Eddie Murphy]], [[Iman (model)|Iman]] and [[Magic Johnson]], along with a distinct complex dance routine.&lt;ref name=&quot;campbell27&quot;/&gt; The video for &quot;[[In the Closet]]&quot; was Jackson's most sexually provocative piece. It featured supermodel [[Naomi Campbell]] in a courtship dance with Jackson. The video was banned in South Africa because of its imagery.&lt;ref name = &quot;Nelson George overview 45-46&quot;/&gt;

The music video for &quot;[[Scream/Childhood|Scream]]&quot;, directed by [[Mark Romanek]] and production designer Tom Foden, is one of Jackson's most critically acclaimed. In 1995, it gained 11 [[MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Award Nominations]]—more than any other music video—and won &quot;Best Dance Video&quot;, &quot;Best Choreography&quot;, and &quot;Best Art Direction&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TCI&quot;/&gt; The song and its accompanying video are a response to the backlash Jackson received from the media after being accused of child molestation in 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michael Jackson Interview Raises Questions, Answers&quot;/&gt; A year later, it won a Grammy for Best Music Video, Short Form; shortly afterwards ''Guinness World Records'' listed it as the [[List of most expensive music videos|most expensive music video ever made]] at a cost of $7&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name = &quot;Ultimate booklet 48–50&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guinness World Records 2006&quot;/&gt;

&quot;[[Earth Song]]&quot; was accompanied by an expensive and well-received music video that gained a Grammy nomination for Best Music Video, Short Form in 1997. The video had an environmental theme, showing images of animal cruelty, deforestation, pollution and war. Using special effects, time is reversed so that life returns, wars end, and the forests re-grow.&lt;ref name = &quot;Ultimate booklet 48–50&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;''HIStory'' on Film volume II&quot;/&gt; Released in 1997 and premiering at the 1996 [[Cannes Film Festival]], ''[[Michael Jackson's Ghosts]]'' was a short film written by Jackson and [[Stephen King]] and directed by [[Stan Winston]].

Jackson throughout his career transformed the art of the music video and paved the way for modern pop music.

==Earnings and wealth==

It's estimated that Michael Jackson earned about $750 million in his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=IANS, Jun 27, 2009, 11.43am IST |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-06-27/news-interviews/28175740_1_stress-michael-jackson-demerol |title=Stress killed MJ, says ex-publicist - Times Of India |publisher=Articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com |date=2009-06-27 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the last several decades of his life, sales of his recordings through Sony's music unit have earned him an estimated $300 million in royalties.  He may have also earned an additional $400 million from concerts, music publishing (including his share of the Beatles catalog) endorsements, merchandising and music videos. Estimating how much of these earnings Jackson was able to personally pocket is difficult because one has to account for taxes, recording costs and production costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeedsSorkin&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leeds|first1=This Article Was Reported By Jeff|last2=Sorkin|first2=Andrew Ross|last3=O'Brien|first3=Timothy L.|last4=O'Brien.|first4=Written By Mr.|title=Thriller: Rescuing A Sinking Pop Star|work=The New York Times|page=1|date=14 May 2006|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/business/yourmoney/14michael.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His net worth has been estimated several times.  In June 30, 2002, his balance sheet stated that his assets were worth $130 million, but he had debt of $415 million giving him a net worth of negative $285 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deutsch |first=Linda |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050504/news_1n4jackson.html |title=Forensic accountant tells court Jackson is in financial straits |publisher=Utsandiego.com |accessdate=2012-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the February 6, 2003, documentary ''Living with Michael Jackson'', Martin Bashir asked Michael Jackson how much he was worth, and Jackson replied &quot;It's way up there.&quot; Bashir then asked, &quot;A billion dollars?&quot; to which Jackson replied &quot;It's over there.&quot; Bashir asked for confirmation: &quot;Over a billion dollars!&quot; to which Jackson replied &quot;Yes.&quot; When the interview was aired in the US, broadcaster Barbara Walters replied, saying, “As for his claim to be worth over a billion dollars,” Walters explained, “his actual worth is in the two or three hundred million range. That’s hardly bad, but it’s nowhere near a billion”. 

In November 2003 Forbes magazine estimated that his assets were worth $550 million ($100 million in properties including Neverland ranch; Encino and Las Vegas homes and other properties and $450 million in music holdings including 50% stake in Sony ATV and other music publishing).  Forbes estimated his debt to be $200 million giving him a net worth of $350 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brett Pulley, 11.21.03, 4:45 PM ET |url=http://www.forbes.com/2003/11/21/cz_1121jackson.html |title=Michael Jackson's Ups And Downs |publisher=Forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 31, 2007, Jackson's statement of financial condition prepared by Washington-based accounting firm Thompson, Cobb, Bazilio &amp; Associates claimed that his assets were worth $567.6 million.  These included his 50% share of the Sony/ATV catalog valued at $390.6 million, Neverland valued at $33 million, cars, antiques, collectibles and other property valued at $20 million, and $668,215 in cash.  His debt was stated to be $331 million, giving him a net worth of $236 million.  CBS news claimed the report was the clearest account yet of Jackson's finances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=June 30, 2009, 1:47 PM |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-207_162-5125862.html |title=Family: Michael Jackson Had A Will |publisher=CBS News |date=2009-06-30 |accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MTV and [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] used the title in joint press releases and ads for the &quot;[[Black or White]]&quot; video at Jackson's request, but MTV denied a report that VJs were required to use it on-camera.
