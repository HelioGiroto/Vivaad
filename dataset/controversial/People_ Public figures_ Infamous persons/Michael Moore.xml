Following the [[Columbine High School massacre]], Moore acquired a life membership to the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA). Moore said that he initially intended to become the NRA's president and dismantle it, but he soon dismissed the plan as too difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2002/nov/11/usforeignpolicy.guardianinterviewsatbfisouthbank|title=Guardian/NFT interview: Michael Moore|first=Andrew|last=Collins|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=November 11, 2002|accessdate=August 22, 2011|quote=...I became a lifetime member after the Columbine massacre because my first thought after Columbine was to run against Charlton Heston for the presidency of the NRA.

In 2005 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine named Moore one of [[Time 100|the world's 100 most influential people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Joel Stein | title=Michael Moore: The Angry Filmmaker | url=http://www.time.com/time/subscriber/2005/time100/artists/100moore.html | publisher=Time | accessdate=2007-07-19 | date=2005-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2005, Moore started the annual [[Traverse City Film Festival]] in [[Traverse City, Michigan]].

==Career==
After dropping out of the [[University of Michigan–Flint]] following his freshman year (where he wrote for the student newspaper ''[[The Michigan Times]]''), Moore worked at the local [[Buick]] plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pww.org/archives95/95-09-23-3.html | title=Exclusive Interview with Michael Moore of TV Nation | author=Ron Sheldon | date=September 23, 1995 | work=People's Weekly World}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 22 he founded the alternative weekly magazine ''The Flint Voice'', which soon changed its name to ''The Michigan Voice'' as it expanded to cover the entire state. In 1986, when Moore became the editor of [[Mother Jones (magazine)|''Mother Jones'']], a liberal political magazine, he moved to California and ''The Michigan Voice'' was shut down.
[[File:Michael Moore 66ème Festival de Venise (Mostra) color.jpg|thumb|Moore at the [[66th Venice International Film Festival]] in 2008]]
After four months at ''Mother Jones'', Moore was fired. [[Matt Labash]] of ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' reported this was for refusing to print an article by [[Paul Berman]] that was critical of the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]] human rights record in Nicaragua.&lt;ref name=Schultz&gt;{{cite book|last=Schultz|first=Emily|title=Michael Moore: a biorgraphy|year=2005|publisher=ECW Press|location=47-54|isbn=1-55022-699-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore refused to run the article, believing it to be inaccurate. &quot;The article was flatly wrong and the worst kind of patronizing bullshit. You would scarcely know from it that the United States had been at war with Nicaragua for the last five years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cockburn, Alexander. &quot;Beat The Devil: Michael meets Mr. Jones&quot;, ''[[The Nation]]'', 1986-09-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Moore believes that ''Mother Jones'' fired him because of the publisher's refusal to allow him to cover a story on the GM plant closings in his hometown of [[Flint, Michigan]]. He responded by putting laid-off GM worker [[Ben Hamper]] (who was also writing for the same magazine at the time) on the magazine's cover, leading to his termination. Moore sued for wrongful dismissal, and settled out of court for $58,000, providing him with seed money for his first film, ''[[Roger &amp; Me]].''&lt;ref&gt;Matt Labash. &quot;Michael Moore, One-Trick Phony&quot;. ''[[The Weekly Standard]]''. 1998-06-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directing/producing===
; ''[[Roger &amp; Me]]'': Moore first became famous for his Emmy Award winning 1989 film, ''Roger &amp; Me'', a documentary about what happened to [[Flint, Michigan]], after [[General Motors Corporation|General Motors]] closed its factories and opened new ones in Mexico, where the workers were paid much less.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0601619/awards] ''Internet Movie Data Base''/ Accessed 20 July 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then Moore has been known as a critic of the [[neoliberal]] view of [[globalization]]. &quot;Roger&quot; is [[Roger B. Smith]], former CEO and president of General Motors.  [[Harlan Jacobson]], editor of ''[[Film Comment]]'' magazine, said that Moore muddled the chronology in ''Roger &amp; Me'' to make it seem that events that took place before G.M.’s layoffs were a consequence of them. Critic [[Roger Ebert]] defended Moore's handling of the timeline as an artistic and stylistic choice that had less to do with his credibility as a filmmaker and more to do with the flexibility of film as a medium to express a satiric viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Attacks on 'Roger &amp; Me' completely miss the point of the film |first=Roger|last=Ebert|date =1990-02-11|publisher=Sun Times|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19900211/COMMENTARY/22010306|accessdate =October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; ''[[Pets or Meat: The Return to Flint]]'': (1992) is a short (23-minute) documentary film that was aired on PBS. It is based on the feature-length film ''Roger &amp; Me'' (1989) by Michael Moore. The film's title refers to Rhonda Britton, a Flint, Michigan, resident featured in both the 1989 and 1992 films who sells rabbits as either pets or meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title='Roger and Me' Revisited |author=Diane Katz |publisher=[[The Detroit News]] |date=September 20, 1992 |accessdate=March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

; ''[[Canadian Bacon (film)|Canadian Bacon]]'': In 1995, Moore released a satirical film, ''Canadian Bacon'', which features a fictional US president (played by [[Alan Alda]]) engineering a fake war with Canada in order to boost his popularity. It is noted for containing a number of Canadian and American stereotypes, and for being Moore's only non-documentary film. The film is also one of the last featuring Canadian-born actor [[John Candy]], and also features a number of cameos by other Canadian actors. In the film, several potential enemies for America's next great campaign are discussed by the president and his cabinet. (The scene was strongly influenced by the [[Stanley Kubrick]] film ''[[Dr. Strangelove]].'') The President comments that declaring war on Canada was as ridiculous as declaring war on international terrorism. His military adviser, played by [[Rip Torn]], quickly rebuffs this idea, saying that no one would care about &quot;...&amp;nbsp;a bunch of guys driving around blowing up rent-a-cars.&quot;

; ''[[The Big One (film)|The Big One]]'': In 1997, Moore directed ''The Big One'', which documents the tour publicizing his book ''[[Downsize This!|Downsize This! Random Threats from an Unarmed American]]'', in which he criticizes mass layoffs despite record corporate profits. Among others, he targets [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] for outsourcing shoe production to [[Indonesia]].

; ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'': Moore's 2002 film, ''Bowling for Columbine'', probes the culture of [[Gun violence in the United States|guns and violence in the United States]], taking as a starting point the [[Columbine High School massacre]] of 1999. ''Bowling for Columbine'' won the Anniversary Prize at the [[2002 Cannes Film Festival]]&lt;ref name=&quot;cannes-2002.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3137379/year/2002.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Bowling for Columbine |accessdate=2009-10-24|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and France's [[César Award]] as the Best Foreign Film. In the United States, it won the 2002 [[Academy Award for Best Documentary (Feature)|Academy Award for Documentary Feature]]. It also enjoyed great commercial and critical success for a film of its type and became, at the time, the highest-grossing mainstream-released documentary (a record now held by Moore's ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'').&lt;ref name=mojorank/&gt; It was praised by some for illuminating a subject avoided by the mainstream media.

; ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'': ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' examines America in the aftermath of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], particularly the record of the Bush administration and alleged links between the families of [[George W. Bush]] and [[bin Laden family|Osama bin Laden]]. ''Fahrenheit'' was awarded the ''[[Palme d'Or]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;cannes-2004.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/4201423/year/2004.html |title=Festival de Cannes: Fahrenheit 9/11 |accessdate=2009-11-30|work=festival-cannes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the top honor at the [[2004 Cannes Film Festival]]; it was the first documentary film to win the prize since 1956. Moore later announced that ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' would not be in consideration for the 2005 [[Academy Award for Documentary Feature]], but instead for the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. He stated he wanted the movie to be seen by a few million more people via a television broadcast prior to election day. According to Moore, &quot;Academy rules forbid the airing of a documentary on television within nine months of its theatrical release&quot;, and since the November 2 election was fewer than nine months after the film's release, it would have been disqualified for the Documentary Oscar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/mikes-letter/why-i-will-not-seek-a-best-documentary-oscar-im-giving-it-up-in-the-hopes-more-voters-can-see-fahrenheit-911 |title=Why I Will Not Seek a Best Documentary Oscar (I'm giving it up in the hopes more voters can see &quot;Fahrenheit 9/11&quot;) |author=Michael Moore |date=September 6, 2004 |accessdate=March 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Fahrenheit received no Oscar nomination for Best Picture. The title of the film alludes to the classic book ''[[Fahrenheit 451]]'' about a future totalitarian state in which books are banned; according to the book, paper begins to burn at 451 degrees Fahrenheit. The pre-release subtitle of the film confirms the allusion: &quot;The temperature at which freedom burns.&quot; 
:As of August 2012, ''Fahrenheit 9/11'' is the highest-grossing documentary of all time, taking in over US$200&amp;nbsp;million worldwide, including United States box office revenue of almost US$120&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=mojorank/&gt; In February 2011, Moore sued producers [[Bob Weinstein|Bob]] and [[Harvey Weinstein]] for US$2.7 million in unpaid profits from the film, claiming they used &quot;Hollywood accounting tricks&quot; to avoid paying him the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-12402807 |title=Film-maker Michael Moore sues Weinstein brothers |publisher=BBC |date=February 9, 2011 |accessdate=February 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2012, Moore and the Weinsteins informed the court that they had settled their dispute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr-esq/michael-moore-harvey-weinstein-fahrenheit-911-lawsuit-291581 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | first=Matthew | last=Belloni | title=Michael Moore, Harvey Weinstein Settle 'Fahrenheit 9/11' Lawsuit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0850669|Captain Mike}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was later re-edited by Moore into ''[[Slacker Uprising]]''.

; ''[[Capitalism: A Love Story]]'': On September 23, 2009, Moore released a new movie titled ''Capitalism: A Love Story'', which looks at the [[late-2000s financial crisis]] and the U.S. economy during the transition between the incoming Obama Administration and the outgoing Bush Administration. Addressing a press conference at its release, Moore said, &quot;Democracy is not a spectator sport, it's a participatory event. If we don't participate in it, it ceases to be a democracy. So Obama will rise or fall based not so much on what he does but on what we do to support him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/lifestyleMolt/idUSTRE5850F320090906 &quot;Capitalism is evil&quot;, says new Michael Moore film] [[Reuters]], September 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
Moore has written or co-written eight non-fiction books, mostly on similar subject matter to his documentaries. ''[[Stupid White Men]]'' (2001) is ostensibly a critique of American domestic and foreign policy but, by Moore's own admission, is also &quot;a book of political humor.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opinionjournal.com/forms/printThis.html?id=110003233 Opinion Journal from the Wall Street Journal:] Unmoored from Reality. John Fund's Political Diary, 21 March 2003. URL accessed 2006-08-29.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dude, Where's My Country?]]'' (2003), is an examination of the [[Bush family]]'s relationships with [[House of Saud|Saudi royalty]], the [[Bin Laden family]], and the [[:Category:Energy companies of the United States|energy industry]], and a call-to-action for liberals in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 election]]. Several of his works have made bestseller lists.

===Acting===
Moore has dabbled in acting, following a 2000 supporting role in ''[[Lucky Numbers]]'' as the cousin of [[Lisa Kudrow]]'s character, who agrees to be part of the scheme concocted by [[John Travolta]]'s character. He also had a cameo in his ''[[Canadian Bacon]]'' as an anti-Canada activist. In 2004, he did a cameo, as a news journalist, in ''[[The Fever (2004 film)|The Fever]]'', starring [[Vanessa Redgrave]] in the lead.

===Television===
Between 1994 and 1995, he directed and hosted the [[BBC]] television series ''[[TV Nation]]'', which followed the format of news magazine shows but covered topics they avoid. The series aired on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in the UK. The series was also aired in the US on [[NBC]] in 1994 for 9 episodes and again for 8 episodes on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in 1995.

His other major series was ''[[The Awful Truth (TV show)|The Awful Truth]]'', which satirized actions by big corporations and politicians. It aired on [[Channel 4]] in the UK, and the [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] network in the US, in 1999 and 2000. Moore won the [[Hugh M. Hefner First Amendment Award]] in Arts and Entertainment for being the executive producer and host of ''The Awful Truth'', where he was also described as &quot;muckraker, author and documentary filmmaker&quot;.

Another 1999 series, ''[[Michael Moore Live]]'', was aired in the UK only on [[Channel 4]], though it was broadcast from New York. This show had a similar format to ''The Awful Truth'', but also incorporated phone-ins and a live stunt each week.

===Music videos===
Moore has directed several music videos, including two for [[Rage Against the Machine]] for songs from ''[[The Battle of Los Angeles (album)|The Battle of Los Angeles]]'': &quot;[[Sleep Now in the Fire]]&quot; and &quot;[[Testify (Rage Against the Machine song)|Testify]]&quot;. He was threatened with arrest during the shooting of &quot;Sleep Now in the Fire&quot;, which was filmed on [[Wall Street]]; the city of [[New York City|New York]] had denied the band permission to play there, although the band and Moore had secured a federal permit to perform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.greenleft.org.au/back/2000/397/397p24c.htm Green Left Weekly:] Rage against Wall Street. Michael Moore, via MichaelMoore.com, date unspecified. URL accessed 2006-07-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also directed the videos for [[R.E.M.]] single &quot;[[All the Way to Reno (You're Gonna Be a Star)]]&quot; in 2001 and the [[System of a Down]] song &quot;[[Boom! (song)|Boom!]]&quot;.

===Appearances in other documentaries===
* Moore appeared in ''The Drugging of Our Children'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0850665/| title=The Drugging of Our Children}} at the [[Internet Movie Database]].&lt;/ref&gt; a 2005 documentary about over-prescription of psychiatric medication to children and teenagers, directed by [[Gary Null]] a proponent of [[Alternative Medicine]]. In the film Moore agrees with [[Gary Null]] that Ritalin and other similar drugs are over-prescribed, saying that they are seen as a &quot;pacifier&quot;.
* Moore appeared on fellow Flint natives [[Grand Funk Railroad]]'s edition of [[Behind The Music]].
* Moore appeared as an off-camera interviewer in ''[[Blood in the Face (1991 film)|Blood in the Face]]'', a 1991 documentary about [[white supremacy]] groups. At the center of the film is a [[neo-Nazi]] gathering in Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|id=0101479|title=Blood in the Face}} Moore details his involvement in the audio commentary on the ''[[Roger &amp; Me]]'' DVD.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Moore appeared in ''[[The Yes Men (film)|The Yes Men]]'', a 2003 documentary about two men who pose as the [[World Trade Organization]]. He appears during a segment concerning working conditions in Mexico and Latin America.
* Moore briefly appears in [[Alex Jones (radio host)|Alex Jones]]'s documentary ''Martial Law 9/11: Rise of the Police State''. Jones criticises Moore for not going into more depth about the World Trade Center attacks in ''[[Fahrenheit 9/11]]'', particularly about NORAD standing down, and for portraying George W. Bush as an unassuming frontman instead of an active conspirator in 9/11. Jones manages to ask Moore why he didn't mention NORAD standing down, and Moore swiftly answers that &quot;it would be un-American&quot;.
* Moore was interviewed for the 2004 documentary, ''[[The Corporation (film)|The Corporation]].'' One of his highlighted quotes was: &quot;The problem is the [[profit motive]]: for corporations, there's no such thing as 'enough'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thecorporation.com/index.cfm?page_id=3 | title=Who's Who | work=The Corporation Film}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Having watched the July 1 show, I cannot see that this is correct. * Moore was interviewed by [[Charlie Rose]] in the summer of 2004, and was repeatedly asked what he thought the real reasons were for President Bush's alarmingly aggressive tactics and why so many liberties and rights were being flagrantly disregarded. Despite receiving the question five or six times, Moore's answer was consistently: &quot;I don't know&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|eBfChxsAQA4|Charlie Rose&amp;nbsp;— MICHAEL MOORE (FROM 7/6/04 &amp; 7/1/04)}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;
* Moore appeared in the 2006 documentary ''[[I'm Going to Tell You a Secret]]'', which chronicles [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s 2004 Re-Invention World Tour. Moore attended her show in New York City at [[Madison Square Garden]].

Although Moore has been noted for his liberal political activism,&lt;ref name=detnews /&gt; he rejects the label &quot;[[political activist]]&quot; saying such a description is redundant as a citizen of a democracy: &quot;I and you and everyone else has to be a political activist.

Moore was a high-profile guest at both the [[2004 Democratic National Convention]] and the [[2004 Republican National Convention]], chronicling his impressions in ''[[USA Today]]''. He was criticized in a speech by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Senator [[John McCain]] as &quot;a disingenuous film-maker.&quot; Moore laughed and waved as Republican attendees jeered, later chanting &quot;four more years.&quot; Moore [[Loser (hand gesture)|gestured his thumb and finger]] at the crowd, which translates into &quot;loser.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/08/31/mccain.moore/index.html ''Delegates relish McCain jab at filmmaker Moore''] CNN.com. 2006-08-31.&lt;/ref&gt;

During September and October 2004, Moore spoke at universities and colleges in [[swing state]]s during his &quot;Slacker Uprising Tour&quot;. The tour gave away [[ramen]] and underwear to students who promised to vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.10news.com/politics/3802561/detail.html |title=Moore Offers 'Hell raiser' Scholarship During Speech |work=10News.com |date=October 14, 2004 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO0809/S00509.htm |title=Michael Moore Offers Slacker Uprising Free Online |work=Scoop Independent News |date=September 23, 2008 |accessdate=December 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One stop during the tour was [[Utah Valley University|Utah Valley State College]].

Accessed 2006-07-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite having supported [[Ralph Nader]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]], Moore urged Nader not to run in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]] so as not to split the left vote. On ''[[Real Time with Bill Maher]]'', Moore and Maher knelt before Nader to plead with him to stay out of the race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A33257-2004Aug1.html |title=Bill Maher: Back for More |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2004-08-02 |accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moore drew attention in 2004 when he used the term &quot;deserter&quot; when he introduced Retired Army Gen. Wesley K. Clark at a Democratic Presidential debate in New Hampshire. Noting that Clark had been a champion debater at West Point, Moore told a laughing crowd, &quot;I know what you're thinking. I want to see that debate&quot; between Clark and [George W.] Bush &amp;ndash; &quot;the general versus the deserter.&quot;  Moore said he was referring to published reports in several media outlets including ''The Boston Globe'' which had reported that &quot;there is strong evidence that Bush performed no military service as required when he moved from Houston to Alabama to work on a U.S. Senate campaign from May to November 1972.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michaelmoore.com/words/mikes-letter/george-w-bush-awol#article2 |title=George W.
