==Biography==
Michael Roach was born in [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1952 to [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]] parents, and grew up in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]. After his high school graduation, he received the [[Presidential Scholars Program|Presidential Scholars Medallion]] from U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]], then attended [[Princeton University]] in 1972.  He traveled to India in 1973 to seek Buddhist instruction, while still in college. He returned to the United States and received a scholarship to return to study in India in 1974. While in India, Roach learned about a Tibetan Buddhist monastery in [[New Jersey]] led by a Mongolian-born lama, [[Sermey Khensur Lobsang Tharchin]]. Roach returned to Princeton, living at the monastery from 1975 to 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elephantjournal.com/2012/06/essays-to-answer-questions-from-my-friends-geshe-michael-roach/ Essays to Answer Questions from my Friends. ~ Geshe Michael Roach | elephant journal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In the year before his graduation in 1975, both of his parents died due to cancer and then his brother committed suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paine&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last =Paine| first =Jeffrey| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Adventures With The Buddha| publisher =[[W.

Beginning in 1981, Roach helped found and run Andin International, a jewelry manufacturer based in New York. He used proceeds from his work to set up [[financial endowment]]s to fund various projects, in particular the Sera Mey Food Fund.&lt;ref name=&quot;Furber&quot;/&gt; 

Roach used these experiences as the basis for a book, ''The Diamond Cutter'', in which he explains how to apply the lessons of the [[Diamond Sutra|Diamond Cutter Sutra]] in the context of business.&lt;ref name=&quot;dcbbw&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In 1987, Roach founded the Asian Classics Input Project (ACIP).  He founded ACIP with the goal of producing a complete and electronically searchable version of the [[Kangyur]] and [[Tengyur]], together with related philosophical commentaries and dictionaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;BiA2&quot;&gt;{{cite book

ACIP also provides a means of earning income for many Tibetan refugees.&lt;ref name=&quot;acip&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|month=|year=|title=Overview—Asian Classics Input Project|url=http://www.asianclassics.org/about/overview|format=|doi=|accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1993 to 1999, Roach developed and taught 18 courses on Tibetan Buddhism in New York City. These courses were based on the training monks receive in Tibetan monasteries, but organized to be taught in a conventional western setting.&lt;ref name=&quot;aci01&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=The Principal Teachings of Buddhism|work=|month=|year=1993|url=http://www.theknowledgebase.com/browse/products.php?product=ACI-Course-01%3A-The-Principal-Teachings-of-Buddhism-%281993%2C-New-York%2C-Geshe-Michael-Roach%29|format=|doi=|accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aci18&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|title=The Great Ideas of Buddhism, Part 3|work=|month=|year=1999|url=http://www.theknowledgebase.com/browse/products.php?product=ACI-Course-18%3A-The-Great-Ideas-of-Buddhism%2C-Part-3-%281999%2C-New-York%2C-Geshe-Michael-Roach%29|format=|doi=|accessdate=2011-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;adi&quot;&gt;{{cite web

From 2000 to 2003, Roach organized and led a three-year silent retreat in the [[Arizona]] desert with five other participants, modified from Tibetan traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Furber&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last =Furber| first =Matt| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =Yoga and meditation mix to improve business acumen| work =| publisher =Idaho Mountain Express| date =2004-04-09| url =http://www.mtexpress.com/2004/04-04-09/04-04-09monk.htm| doi =| accessdate = 2008-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wilson&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last =Wilson| first =Jeff| authorlink =| coauthors =| title =The Buddhist Guide to New York| publisher =[[St. Martin's Press]]| year =2000| location =| url =| doi =| id =  | isbn = 0-312-26715-0| page = 85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Roach established [[Diamond Mountain Center]], a Buddhist retreat center and seminary in Arizona.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;/&gt;

===Marriage and controversy===
{{criticism-section|date=July 2012}}
[[File:Allegra greeting Geshe Michael and Lama Christie.jpg|thumb|right|Geshe Michael Roach and Christie McNally]]

In 1996, Christie McNally, then a recent college graduate, became Roach's student. They began a &quot;spiritual partnership&quot; in which they took vows that included never being more than 15 feet apart, eating from the same plate, reading the same books together, etc. They were secretly married in a [[Christian]] ceremony in [[Rhode Island]] in 1998 and kept their relationship secret until 2003. When news of the marriage emerged, Roach explained to the ''New York Times'' that they had wished to honor their Christian heritage and that he wanted McNally to be entitled to his possessions if something happened to him.&lt;ref name=Santos&gt;Fernanda Santos, [http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/06/us/mysterious-yoga-retreat-ends-in-a-grisly-death.html &quot;Mysterious Yoga Retreat in the Desert Ends in a Grisly Death&quot;], ''New York Times'', 6 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1996 Asiaweek cover story the [[Dalai Lama]] commented; &quot;- a monk with a wife. This is wrong. A monk is celibate. Those who dress like a monk, with a wife, they are not monks. Of course, it's the individual's right. You can always give up a monk's vows, and then change your dress.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Asiaweek&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www-cgi.cnn.com/ASIANOW/asiaweek/96/0510/feat1.html |title=The Private Dalai Lama |accessdate=2012-07-26 |author=Ron Gluckman |date=May 10, 1996 |publisher=Asiaweek}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The controversy centers around a Buddhist practice in which two practitioners use sexual intercourse as a means of strongly focusing the consciousness in order to strengthen the realization of emptiness.   According to the Dalai Lama, &quot;Yogis who have achieved a high level of the path and are fully qualified can engage in sexual activity, and a monastic with this ability can maintain all the precepts...Such a practitioner can make spiritual use not only of delicious meat and drink, but even of human excrement and urine. A yogi’s meditation transforms these into real ambrosia. For people like us, however, this is beyond our reach. As long as you cannot transform piss and shit, these other things should not be done!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;htp193&quot;&gt;{{cite book

|ISBN=0-7434-2708-4
|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robert Thurman]], a former monk and fellow Buddhist scholar, expressed skepticism that Roach was at such a level of practice, referring to it as &quot;superhuman&quot;. Some Buddhist leaders, including Thurman, urged him to renounce his monastic vows and stop wearing his robes; Roach did not comply.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/15/garden/15buddhists.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5087&amp;em&amp;en=729a029c0a34c0e5&amp;ex=1211083200 |title=Making Their Own Limits in a Spiritual Partnership |accessdate=2008-05-29 |author=Leslie Kaufman |date=May 15, 2008 |publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Roach's practice of appearing in public with McNally raised concerns. When Roach proposed to teach in [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamshala]] in 2006, the Office of the Dalai Lama rebuffed his plan, stating that Roach's &quot;unconventional behavior does not accord with His Holiness’s teachings and practices&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;/&gt; the teaching took place in nearby [[Palampur]] instead. 

McNally left Roach in the middle of 2009&quot;&lt;ref name=Santos /&gt;&lt;ref name=PSM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nypost.com/pagesixmag/issues/20100211/Monk+y+Business+Controversial+NYC+guru+Michael+Roach |title=Monk-y Business: Controversial NYC guru Michael Roach |accessdate=2010-06-24 |author=Beth Landman |date=Feb 11, 2010 |publisher=Page Six Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Roach filed for divorce in September 2010.

===Student's death===

McNally married one of Roach's students, Ian Thorson, on October 3, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;/&gt;  McNally entered a three-year retreat with Thorson at the Diamond Mountain Center in December 2010.  Roach published an open letter stating that McNally admitted in February 2012 to a violation of the terms under which students are allowed to reside at the center, and the Diamond Mountain board of directors asked McNally and Thorson to leave the retreat. Thorson and McNally left the Diamond Mountain property, but secretly set up camp in a cave on [[Bureau of Land Management]] land nearby, within the retreat boundaries.  Thorson died in April 2012 of dehydration and exposure.&lt;ref name=ind/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;abcnews.go.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;slate.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2155340/Diamond-Mountain-retreat-death-Ian-Thorson-dies-fleeing-mysterious-yoga-retreat-wife.html Diamond Mountain retreat death: Ian Thorson dies after fleeing mysterious yoga retreat with wife | Mail Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.willcoxrangenews.com/news/article_9a724b6c-b4da-11e1-8c99-001a4bcf887a.html Case closed in death of former participant at Buddhist retreat - Arizona Range News: News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;open&quot;&gt;{{cite web
