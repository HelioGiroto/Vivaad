&lt;!-- Do not add &quot;Sir&quot;, see above--&gt;'''Edward Moore''' &quot;'''Ted'''&quot; '''Kennedy'''&lt;!-- Do not add &quot;KBE&quot;, see above--&gt; (February 22, 1932{{spaced ndash}}August 25, 2009) was a [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Massachusetts]] and a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. He was the [[List of United States Senators in the 111th Congress by seniority|second most senior]] member of the Senate when he died and was the [[List of members of the United States Congress by longevity of service|fourth-longest-serving senator]] in United States history, having served there for almost 47 years. As the most prominent living member of the [[Kennedy family]] for many years, he was also the last surviving son of [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.]]; the youngest brother of President [[John F. Kennedy]] and Senator [[Robert F. Kennedy]], both victims of assassination; and the father of [[United States House of Representatives|Congressman]] [[Patrick J. Kennedy]].

Kennedy entered the Senate in a [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 1962|November 1962 special election]] to fill the seat once held by his brother John. He was elected to a full six-year term in [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1964|1964]] and was reelected seven more times before his death. The controversial [[Chappaquiddick incident]] on July 18, 1969, resulted in the death of his automobile passenger [[Mary Jo Kopechne]]. Kennedy pleaded guilty to a charge of leaving the scene of an accident and the incident significantly damaged his chances of ever becoming [[President of the United States]]. His one attempt, in the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]], resulted in a Democratic primary campaign loss to incumbent President [[Jimmy Carter]].

Kennedy was known for his charisma and oratorical skills. His 1968 eulogy for his brother Robert and his [[1980 Democratic National Convention|1980 rallying cry]] for [[Modern liberalism in the United States|modern American liberalism]] were among his best-known speeches. He became recognized as &quot;The Lion of the Senate&quot; through his long tenure and influence. More than 300 bills that Kennedy and his staff authored were enacted into law. Unabashedly liberal, Kennedy championed an interventionist government emphasizing [[economic justice|economic]] and [[social justice]], but was also known for working with Republicans to find compromises between senators with disparate views. Kennedy played a major role in passing many laws, including laws addressing [[Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965|immigration]], [[National Cancer Act of 1971|cancer research]], [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985|health insurance]], [[Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986|apartheid]], [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|disability discrimination]], [[Ryan White AIDS Care Act|AIDS care]], [[Civil Rights Act of 1991|civil rights]], [[Mental Health Parity Act|mental health benefits]], [[State Children's Health Insurance Program|children's health insurance]], [[No Child Left Behind Act|education]] and [[Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act|volunteering]]. During the 2000s, he led several unsuccessful [[immigration reform]] efforts. Over the course of his Senate career and continuing into the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]], Kennedy continued his efforts to enact [[universal health care]], which he called the &quot;cause of my life.&quot;

In May 2008, Kennedy was diagnosed with a [[malignant]] [[brain tumor]] which limited his appearances in the Senate. He died on August 25, 2009, at his [[Hyannis Port, Massachusetts]] [[Kennedy Compound|home]]. By the time of his death, he had come to be viewed as a major figure and spokesman for [[American progressivism]].

== Early life, education, and military service ==
Kennedy was born in St. Margaret's Hospital on February 22, 1932 in the [[Dorchester, Boston|Dorchester]] section of [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], the youngest of nine children of [[Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy|Rose Fitzgerald]] and [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.]], who were members of prominent [[Irish-American]] families in Boston&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/02/15/chapter_1_teddy/ | title=Chapter 1: Teddy: A childhood of privilege, promise, and pain | author=English, Bella | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=February 15, 2009 | accessdate=February 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who constituted one of the wealthiest families in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-obit&quot;/&gt; His elder siblings included [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Robert F. Kennedy]], and [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver]]. John asked to be the newborn's godfather, a request his parents honored, though they did not agree to his request to name the baby George Washington Kennedy; instead, they named him after Joseph Sr.'s assistant.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title=Kennedy dead at 77 |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/08/26/kennedy_dead_at_77/ | last=Nolan| first=Martin F.| authorlink=Martin Nolan| newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=August 26, 2009 | accessdate=August 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frequently uprooted as a child as his family moved among [[Bronxville, New York]], [[Hyannis Port, Massachusetts]], [[Palm Beach, Florida]], and the [[Court of St. James's]] in London,&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-17&quot;&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 13, 16–17.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy attended ten different schools by the age of eleven.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-1&quot;/&gt; At age seven, he received his [[First Communion]] from [[Pope Pius XII]] in the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]].&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  He spent sixth and seventh grades in the [[Fessenden School]], where he was a mediocre student,&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-1&quot;/&gt; and eighth grade at Cranwell Preparatory School, both in Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-17&quot;/&gt; His parents were affectionate toward him as the youngest child but also compared him unfavorably with his older brothers.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-1&quot;/&gt; Between the ages of eight and sixteen he suffered the trauma of his sister [[Rosemary Kennedy]]'s failed [[lobotomy]] and the deaths of his brother [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Jr.]] in [[World War II]] and sister [[Kathleen Agnes Kennedy]] in an airplane crash.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-1&quot;/&gt; An early political and personal influence was his affable maternal grandfather, [[John F.

Kennedy entered [[Harvard College]], and in his spring semester was assigned to the athlete-oriented [[Winthrop House]], where his brothers had also lived.&lt;ref&gt;McGinnis, ''The Last Brother'', p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; He was as an [[End (American football)|offensive and defensive end]] on the freshman football team, with his play characterized by his large size and fearless style.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-1&quot;/&gt; In his first semester, Kennedy and his friends arranged to copy answers from another student during the final examination for a science class.&lt;ref&gt;Leamer, ''The Kennedy Men'', p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of his second semester, in May 1951, and anxious about maintaining his eligibility for athletics for the next year,&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-1&quot;/&gt; he had a friend who was knowledgeable on the subject take his [[Spanish language]] examination for him.&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-18&quot;/&gt; The two were quickly caught and expelled for cheating, but in a standard Harvard treatment for cases of this kind, they were told they could apply for readmission in a year or two after demonstrating good behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-18&quot;/&gt;

Kennedy enlisted in the [[United States Army]] in June 1951 (signing up for an optional four-year term, which was shortened to the minimum two years after his father intervened).&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-18&quot;&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[United States Army Basic Training|basic training]] at [[Fort Dix]], he requested assignment to [[Fort Holabird]] for [[Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)|Army Intelligence]] training, but was dropped after a few weeks without explanation.&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-18&quot;/&gt; He went to [[Camp Gordon]] for training in the [[Military Police Corps (United States Army)|Military Police Corps]].&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-18&quot;/&gt;  In June 1952, Kennedy was assigned to the [[honor guard]] at [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe|SHAPE]] headquarters in Paris.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-18&quot;/&gt; His father's political connections ensured he was not deployed to the ongoing [[Korean War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGinnis, ''The Last Brother'', p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;  While stationed in Europe he travelled extensively on weekends and climbed the [[Matterhorn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kennedyism&quot;/&gt; He was discharged in March 1953 as a [[private first class]].&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-18&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kennedyism&quot;/&gt;

Kennedy re-entered Harvard in summer 1953 and improved his study habits.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-1&quot;/&gt; He joined [[Owl Club (Harvard)|The Owl]] [[final club]] in 1954;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Kennedy Ends His Final Club Ties | newspaper=[[The Harvard Crimson]] | date=January 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was also chosen for the [[Hasty Pudding Club]] and the [[Pi Eta]] fraternity.&lt;ref&gt;McGinnis, ''The Last Brother'', p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; On athletic probation during his sophomore year, Kennedy returned as a second-string two way end for [[Harvard Crimson football]] during his junior year and barely missed earning his [[varsity letter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-20&quot;&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he received a recruiting feeler from [[Green Bay Packers]] head coach [[Lisle Blackbourn]], asking about his interest in playing professionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8406670.html | title=Sen.

Kennedy enrolled in the [[University of Virginia School of Law]] in 1956,&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-1&quot;/&gt; and also attended the [[Hague Academy of International Law]] during 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;cong-bio-dir&quot;/&gt; At Virginia he was in the middle of the class ranking but was the winner of the prestigious William Minor Lile Moot Court Competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UVALawWeekly2006&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=McCarten, Tim |title=UVA Law's 7 Senators |journal=Virginia Law Weekly |date=September 8, 2006 |volume=59 |issue=2 |url=http://www.lawweekly.org/?module=displaystory&amp;story_id=1252&amp;edition_id=38&amp;format=html |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there, his fast automotive habits were curtailed when he was charged with reckless driving and driving without a license.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-1&quot;/&gt; He was officially manager of his brother John's [[United States Senate election, 1958|1958 Senate re-election campaign]], and Ted's ability to connect to ordinary voters on the street helped bring a record-setting victory margin that gave credibility to John's presidential aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 25–27. In practice, [[Larry O'Brien]] and [[Kenneth O'Donnell]] were the actual campaign managers.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy graduated from law school in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;cong-bio-dir&quot;/&gt;

== Family and early career ==
While attending law school, Kennedy met [[Joan Bennett Kennedy|Virginia Joan Bennett]] when he was delivering a speech at [[Manhattanville College]] in October 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-23&quot;&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett was a senior there, had worked as a model and won beauty contests, but was unfamiliar with the world of politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-23&quot;/&gt; After their engagement she grew nervous about marrying someone she did not know that well, but his father insisted that the wedding should proceed.&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-23&quot;/&gt; They were married by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Francis Spellman]] on November 29, 1958, at St. Joseph's Church in [[Bronxville, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kennedyism&quot;/&gt; Together they had three children: [[Kara Kennedy|Kara]] (February 27, 1960 – September 16, 2011), [[Edward M. Kennedy, Jr.|Ted, Jr.]] (born September 26, 1961), and [[Patrick J. Kennedy|Patrick J.]] (born July 14, 1967). &lt;!--excessive detail for here on grandchildren Kara married Michael Allen on September 9, 1990, in [[Centerville, Massachusetts]]. They have two children: Grace Kennedy Allen (born September 19, 1994, in Washington, D.C.), and Max Greathouse Allen (born December 20, 1996, in [[Rockville, Maryland]]). Edward Jr. and his wife, Dr. Katherine (Kiki) Gershman, have two children, Kiley Elizabeth (born August 7, 1994) and Edward Moore Kennedy, III, (born February 25, 1998).--&gt; By the mid-1960s, their marriage was in trouble due to Ted's womanizing and Joan's growing alcoholism.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-2&quot;/&gt;

Kennedy was admitted to the Massachusetts Bar in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;KennedyKeynoteUVLaw2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=May 20, 2008 |url=http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2006_spr/pubservice.htm
|title=Sen. Ted Kennedy to Keynote Public Service Conference |date=March 1, 2006 |publisher=[[University of Virginia School of Law]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1960, [[United States presidential election, 1960|John ran for President of the United States]] and Ted managed his campaign in the Western states.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-1&quot;/&gt; Ted learned to fly and during the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1960|Democratic primary campaign]] he barnstormed around the western states, meeting with delegates and bonding with them by trying his hand at [[ski jumping]] and [[bronc riding]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kennedyism&quot;/&gt; The seven weeks he spent in [[Wisconsin]] helped his brother win the first contested primary of the season there and a similar time spent in [[Wyoming]] was rewarded when a unanimous vote from that state's delegates put his brother over the top at the [[1960 Democratic National Convention]].&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 27–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his victory in the presidential election, John vacated his seat as U.S. Senator from Massachusetts, but Ted was not eligible to fill the vacancy until February 22, 1962, when he would turn thirty. Initially Ted wanted to stay out West and do something other than run for office right away; he said, &quot;The disadvantage of my position is being constantly compared with two brothers of such superior ability.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-2&quot;/&gt; His brothers were not in favor of his running immediately either, but Ted coveted the Senate seat as an accomplishment to match his brothers' and their father overruled them.&lt;ref name=&quot;kennedyism&quot;/&gt; Therefore, John asked Massachusetts Governor [[Foster Furcolo]] to name Kennedy family friend [[Benjamin A. Smith II|Ben Smith]] as interim senator for John's unexpired term, which he did in December 1960.&lt;ref&gt;This was done so under the authority of the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] and Massachusetts state law.&lt;/ref&gt; This kept the seat available for Ted.&lt;ref name=&quot;kennedyism&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Teddy &amp; Kennedyism |url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,940066,00.html |date=September 28, 1962 |accessdate=May 23, 2008 | magazine=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Ted started work in February 1961 as an [[assistant district attorney]] for [[Suffolk County, Massachusetts]] (for which he took a nominal $1 salary), where he first developed a hard-nosed attitude towards crime.&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-33&quot;&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 33–35.&lt;/ref&gt; He took many overseas trips, billed as fact-finding tours with the goal of improving his foreign policy credentials.&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-33&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, ''Edward Kennedy'', p. 121, 132.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-fbi-61&quot;/&gt;  On a nine-nation [[Latin American]] trip in 1961, FBI reports from the time showed Kennedy meeting with [[Lauchlin Currie]], an alleged former Soviet spy, together with locals in each country whom the reports deemed left-wingers and Communist sympathizers.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-fbi-61&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-fbi-61&quot;/&gt;  Reports from the FBI and other sources had Kennedy renting a brothel and opening up bordellos after hours during the tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-fbi-61&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2011/03/01/fbi_memo_tied_kennedy_to_brothel_leftists_in_61/ | title=FBI memo tied Kennedy to brothel, leftists in '61 | author=Stockman, Farah | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=March 1, 2011 | accessdate=March 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ap-fbi-61&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Miga, Andrew | date=February 28, 2011 | url=http://www.salon.com/news/ted_kennedy/index.html?story=/news/feature/2011/02/28/Ted_Kennedy_rented_brothel_in_chile |title=Ted Kennedy rented a brothel in 1961 | magazine=[[Salon.com|Salon]] | agency= [[Associated Press]] |accessdate= February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-ek-132&quot;&gt;Hersh, ''Edward Kennedy'', p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Latin American trip helped to formulate Kennedy's foreign policy views, and in subsequent ''[[Boston Globe]]'' columns he warned that the region might turn to Communism if the U.S. did not reach out to it in a more effective way.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-fbi-61&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-ek-132&quot;/&gt; Kennedy also began speaking to local political clubs and organizations.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-2&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/02/16/chapter_2_the_youngest_brother/ | title=Chapter 2: The Youngest Brother: Turbulence and tragedies eclipse early triumphs | author=Swidey, Neil | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=February 16, 2009 | accessdate=February 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TedKennedy 1962.jpg|thumb|right|First Senate campaign, 1962]]
In the [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 1962|1962 U.S. Senate special election in Massachusetts]], Kennedy initially faced a Democratic Party primary challenge from [[Edward J. McCormack, Jr.]], the [[Massachusetts Attorney General|state Attorney General]]. Kennedy's slogan was &quot;He can do more for Massachusetts&quot;, the same one John had used in his first campaign for the seat ten years earlier.&lt;ref name=&quot;aap-08-791&quot;&gt;Barone and Cohen, ''Almanac of American Politics'' 2008, p. 791.&lt;/ref&gt; McCormack had the support of many liberals and intellectuals, who thought Kennedy inexperienced and knew of his suspension from Harvard, a fact which later became public during the race.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-2&quot;/&gt; Kennedy also faced the notion that with one brother President and another [[U.S. Attorney General]], &quot;Don't you think that Teddy is one Kennedy too many?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kennedyism&quot;/&gt; But Kennedy proved to be an effective street-level campaigner.&lt;ref name=&quot;kennedyism&quot;/&gt; In a televised debate, McCormack said &quot;The office of United States senator should be merited, and not inherited,&quot; and said that if his opponent's name was Edward Moore, not Edward Moore Kennedy, his candidacy &quot;would be a joke&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-2&quot;/&gt; Voters thought McCormack's performance overbearing, and with the family political machine's finally getting fully behind him, Kennedy won the September 1962 primary by a two-to-one margin.&lt;ref name=&quot;kennedyism&quot;/&gt; In the November special election, Kennedy defeated Republican [[George Cabot Lodge II]], product of another noted Massachusetts political family, gaining 55&amp;nbsp;percent of the vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;kennedyism&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wt-bio&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Edward Kennedy (Dem) | newspaper=[[The Washington Times]] | date=May 5, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States Senator==
===First years and assassinations of two brothers===
Kennedy was sworn in to the Senate on November 7, 1962.&lt;ref name=&quot;Senate-longest&quot;/&gt; He maintained a deferential attitude towards the older, seniority-laden Southern members when he first entered the Senate, avoiding publicity and focusing on committee work and local issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;ascent&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 43, 45–47.&lt;/ref&gt;  Compared to his brothers in office, he lacked John's sophistication and Robert's intense, sometimes grating drive, but was more affable than either of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;ascent&quot;/&gt;

On November 22, 1963, while Kennedy was [[Presiding Officer of the United States Senate|presiding over the Senate]]—a task given to junior members—an aide rushed in to tell him that his brother, President [[John F. Kennedy]], [[John F.

===Chappaquiddick incident===
{{Main|Chappaquiddick incident}}
[[File:Mary Jo Kopechne.jpg|thumb|right|upright|115px|Mary Jo Kopechne]]
On the night of July 18, 1969, Kennedy was on [[Martha's Vineyard]]'s [[Chappaquiddick Island]] at a party he gave for the &quot;[[Boiler Room Girls]]&quot;, a group of young women who had worked on his brother Robert's presidential campaign the year before.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-3&quot;/&gt; Kennedy left the party, driving a [[Oldsmobile Delmont 88#1965–68|1967 Oldsmobile Delmont 88]] with one of the women, 28-year-old [[Mary Jo Kopechne]], and later drove off Dike Bridge into the [[Poucha Pond]] inlet, a tidal channel on Chappaquiddick Island. Kennedy escaped the overturned vehicle, and, by his description, dove below the surface seven or eight times, vainly attempting to reach Kopechne. Ultimately, he swam to shore and left the scene. He contacted authorities the next morning, but Kopechne's body had already been discovered.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-3&quot;/&gt;

On July 25, Kennedy pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and was given a sentence of two months in jail, [[suspended sentence|suspended]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-3&quot;/&gt; That night, he gave a national broadcast in which he said, &quot;I regard as indefensible the fact that I did not report the accident to the police immediately,&quot; but denied driving under the influence of alcohol and denied any immoral conduct between him and Kopechne.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-3&quot;/&gt; Kennedy asked the Massachusetts electorate whether he should stay in office or resign, after getting a favorable response in messages sent to him, announced on July 30 that he would remain in the Senate and run for re-election the next year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=4AwwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7QEEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6648,3488972 | title=Kennedy Stays In Senate; Will Seek New Term | agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper=[[Toledo Blade|The Blade]] | location=Toledo | date=July 31, 1969 | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1970, an inquest into Kopechne's death was held in [[Edgartown, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-3&quot;/&gt; At the request of Kennedy's lawyers, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] ordered the inquest be conducted in secret.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fighting for Air: In the Trenches With Television News|isbn=0-8262-0952-1|year=1994|first=Liz|last=Trotta|location=Columbia, MO|publisher=University of Missouri Press}} p. 184&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bly_213&quot;&gt;Bly, ''The Kennedy Men'', p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;  The presiding judge, James A.

Kennedy's next time facing the voters was to be that Senate re-election bid in 1970.

Although Carter now had enough delegates to clinch the nomination,&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-309&quot;/&gt; Kennedy carried his campaign on to the [[1980 Democratic National Convention]] in August in New York, hoping to pass a rule there that would free delegates from being bound by primary results and open the convention.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-4&quot;/&gt;  This move failed on the first night of the convention, and Kennedy withdrew.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-4&quot;/&gt;  On the second night, August 12, Kennedy delivered the most famous speech of his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;guard082608&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/aug/26/democrats2008.uselections2008 | title=Ted Kennedy defies cancer diagnosis to inspire Democrats in Denver | author=Goldberg, Suzanne | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date=August 26, 2008 | accessdate=March 18, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drawing on allusions to and quotes of [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], and [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]] to say that [[American liberalism]] was not passé,&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-316&quot;&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 316–319.&lt;/ref&gt; he concluded with the words:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/tedkennedy1980dnc.htm | title=Ted Kennedy: 1980 Democratic National Convention Address | publisher=americanrhetoric.com | date=August 12, 1980 | accessdate=March 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Madison Square Garden]] audience reacted with wild applause and demonstrations for half an hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-4&quot;/&gt;  On the final night, Kennedy arrived late after Carter's acceptance speech and while he shook Carter's hand, he failed to raise Carter's arm in the traditional show of party unity.&lt;ref name=&quot;aap-08-792&quot;&gt;Barone and Cohen, ''Almanac of American Politics'' 2008, p. 792.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-316&quot;/&gt;  Carter's difficulty in securing Kennedy supporters during the election campaign was a contributory factor that led to his defeat in November by [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-316&quot;/&gt;

===1980s===
The 1980 election saw the Republicans capture not just the presidency but control of the Senate as well, and Kennedy was in the minority party for the first time in his career. Kennedy did not dwell upon his presidential loss,&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-4&quot;/&gt; but instead reaffirmed his public commitment to American liberalism.&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-321&quot;&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 321–322.&lt;/ref&gt;  He chose to become the ranking member of the [[United States Senate Committee on Labor and Public Welfare|Labor and Public Welfare Committee]] rather than of the Judiciary Committee, which he would later say was one of the most important decisions of his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-321&quot;/&gt;  Kennedy became a committed champion of women's issues and of gay rights,&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-321&quot;/&gt; and established relationships with select Republican senators to block [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan's actions]] and preserve and improve the [[Voting Rights Act]], funding for [[AIDS]] treatment, and equal funding for women's sports under [[Title IX]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-4&quot;/&gt;  To combat being in the minority, he worked long hours and devised a series of hearings-like public forums to which he could invite experts and discuss topics important to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-4&quot;/&gt;  Kennedy could not hope to stop all of Reagan's reshapings of government, but was often nearly the sole effective Democrat battling him.&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, ''The Shadow President'', pp. 55–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1981, Ted and Joan Kennedy announced they were getting a divorce.&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-div&quot;&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 325, 354.&lt;/ref&gt;  The proceedings were generally amicable,&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-div&quot;/&gt; and she received a reported $4 million settlement when the divorce was granted in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2005/02/25/kennedys_children_become_her_guardians/ | title=Kennedy's children become her guardians | author=Johnson, Glen | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=February 25, 2005 | accessdate=April 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, Kennedy created the [[Friends of Ireland (U.S. Congress)|Friends of Ireland]] organization with Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan|Daniel Moynihan]] and [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Tip O'Neill]] to support initiatives for peace and reconciliation in [[Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tedkennedy.org/service/item/foreign_policy Providing a Leading Voice for Human Rights and Democracy around the Globe] TedKennedy.org.

Kennedy easily defeated Republican businessman [[Ray Shamie]] to [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1982|win re-election in 1982]].&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, ''The Shadow President'', p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Senate leaders granted him a seat on the [[United States Senate Armed Services Committee|Armed Services Committee]], while allowing him to keep his other major seats despite the traditional limit of two such seats.&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-60&quot;&gt;Hersh, ''The Shadow President'', pp. 60–63.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy became very visible in opposing aspects of the [[foreign policy of the Reagan administration]], including U.S. intervention in the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] and U.S. support for the [[Contras]] in [[Nicaragua]], and in opposing Reagan-supported weapons systems, including the [[B-1 bomber]], the [[MX missile]], and the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-60&quot;/&gt;  Kennedy became the Senate's leading advocate for a [[nuclear freeze]]&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-60&quot;/&gt; and was a critic of Reagan's confrontational policies toward the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/22/world/kennedy-denouces-regan-for-voodoo-arms-control.html |title=Kennedy Denounces Reagan for 'Voodoo Arms Control' |agency=[[United Press International]] |newspaper=The New York Times |date=June 22, 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/09/world/reagan-finds-a-lesser-evil-in-indefinite-recess-of-talks.html |title=Reagan Finds a Lesser Evil in Indefinite Recess of Talks |author=Smith, Hedrick |newspaper=The New York Times |date=December 9, 1983 |authorlink=Hedrick Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/29858499/edward_kennedy_on_president_reagan_a_state_of_disunion/print |title=Edward Kennedy on President Reagan: A State of Disunion |author=Kennedy, Edward M. |magazine=Rolling Stone |date=March 15, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1983 memorandum from [[Chairman of the KGB|KGB Chairman]] [[Viktor Chebrikov]] to General Secretary [[Yuri Andropov]] noted this stance and asserted that Kennedy, through former Senator [[John Tunney]]'s discussions with Soviet contacts, had suggested that U.S.-Soviet relations might be improved if Kennedy and Andropov could meet in person to discuss arms control issues and if top Soviet officials, via Kennedy's help, were able to address the American public through the U.S. news media.&lt;ref name=&quot;times020292&quot;/&gt;  Andropov was unimpressed by the idea.&lt;ref name=&quot;times020292&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/19401082/Teddy-the-KGB-and-the-Top-Secret-File-Tim-Sabastian-the-Sunday-Times-Feb-2-1992 |title=Teddy, the KGB and the top secret file |author=Sebastian, Tim |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |date=February 2, 1992 |authorlink=Tim Sebastian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy's staff drew up detailed plans for a candidacy in the [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984 presidential election]] that he considered, but with his family opposed and his realization that the Senate was a fully satisfying career, in late 1982 he decided not to run.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 341–342.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy campaigned hard for Democratic presidential nominee [[Walter Mondale]] and defended vice presidential nominee [[Geraldine Ferraro]] from criticism over being a pro-choice Catholic, but Reagan was re-elected in a landslide.&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 360–361.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kennedy staged a tiring, dangerous, and high-profile trip to South Africa in January 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-77&quot;&gt;Hersh, ''The Shadow President'', pp. 77–78.&lt;/ref&gt; He defied both the [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid government]]'s wishes and militant anti-white [[AZAPO]] demonstrators by spending a night in the [[Soweto]] home of [[Bishop Desmond Tutu]] and also visited [[Winnie Mandela]], wife of imprisoned black leader [[Nelson Mandela]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-77&quot;/&gt;  Upon returning, Kennedy became a leader in the push for economic sanctions against South Africa; collaborating with Senator [[Lowell Weicker]], he secured Senate passage, and the overriding of Reagan's veto, of the [[Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act of 1986]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-77&quot;/&gt;  Despite their many political differences, Kennedy and Reagan had a good personal relationship,&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; and with the administration's approval Kennedy traveled to the Soviet Union in 1986 to act as a go-between in arms control negotiations with reformist Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-4&quot;/&gt;  The discussions were productive, and Kennedy also helped gain the release of a number of [[Refusenik|Soviet Jewish refuseniks]], including [[Anatoly Shcharansky]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 391–393.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Kennedy was an accomplished legislator, his personal life was troubled during this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-5&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/02/19/chapter_5_trials__redemption/ | title=Chapter 5: Trials &amp; Redemptions: An untidy private life, then a turn to stability | author=Kahn, Joseph P. | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=February 19, 2009 | accessdate=April 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His weight fluctuated wildly, he drank heavily at times – although not when it would interfere with his Senate duties – and his cheeks became blotchy.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, ''The Shadow President'', pp. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy later acknowledged, &quot;I went through a lot of difficult times over a period in my life where [drinking] may have been somewhat of a factor or force.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-5&quot;/&gt;  He chased women frequently,&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-385&quot;/&gt; and also was in a series of more serious romantic relationships but did not want to commit to anything long-term.&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-83&quot;&gt;Hersh, ''The Shadow President'', pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt; He often caroused with fellow Senator [[Chris Dodd]];&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-83&quot;/&gt; twice in 1985 they were in drunken incidents in Washington restaurants, with one involving unwelcome physical contact with a waitress.&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-385&quot;&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', p. 385.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987 Kennedy and a young female lobbyist were surprised in the back room of a restaurant in a state of partial undress.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly&quot;/&gt;

[[File:EdwardKennedyUSSTheodoreRooseveltFeb1987.jpeg|thumb|left|Senator Kennedy talking to sailors aboard [[USS Theodore Roosevelt (CVN-71)|USS ''Theodore Roosevelt'']], February 1987]]
After again considering a candidacy for the [[United States presidential election, 1988|1988 presidential election]],&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly&quot;/&gt; influenced by his personal difficulties and family concerns, and content with remaining in the Senate,&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-385&quot;/&gt; in December 1985 Kennedy publicly cut short any talk that he might run.  He added: &quot;I know this decision means I may never be president. But the pursuit of the presidency is not my life. Public service is.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-4&quot;/&gt;  Kennedy used his legislative skills to get passed the [[Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1985|COBRA Act]], which extended employer-based health benefits after leaving a job.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 382–383.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[United States Senate elections, 1986|1986 congressional elections]], the Democrats regained control of the Senate and Kennedy became chair of the Labor and Public Welfare Committee.  By now Kennedy had become what colleague [[Joe Biden]] termed &quot;the best strategist in the Senate,&quot; who always knew when best to move legislation.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-4&quot;/&gt;  Kennedy continued his close working relationship with ranking Republican Senator [[Orrin Hatch]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-6&quot;/&gt; and they were close allies on many health-related measures.&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', p. 415.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Kennedy's biggest battles in the Senate came with [[Robert Bork Supreme Court nomination|Reagan's July 1987 nomination]] of Judge [[Robert Bork]] to the [[U.S. Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-4&quot;/&gt;  Kennedy saw a possible Bork appointment as leading to a dismantling of civil rights law that he had helped put into place, and feared Bork's [[originalist]] judicial philosophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-4&quot;/&gt;  Kennedy's staff had researched Bork's writings and record, and within an hour of the nomination – which was initially expected to succeed – Kennedy went on the Senate floor to announce his opposition:&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-73&quot;&gt;Hersh, ''The Shadow President'', pp. 73–75.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Robert Bork's America is a land in which women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the Government, and the doors of the Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens ...}}
The incendiary rhetoric of what became known as the &quot;Robert Bork's America&quot; speech enraged Bork supporters, who considered it slanderous, and worried some Democrats as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-73&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Miranda&gt;{{cite news|title=The Original Borking|author=Miranda, Manuel|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=August 24, 2005|accessdate=August 10, 2007|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/nextjustice/?id=110007149}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Kennedy And Bork |accessdate=April 28, 2008 |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DF1E3EF936A35754C0A961948260 |author=Reston, James |date=July 5, 1987|newspaper=The New York Times |authorlink= James Reston}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the Reagan administration was unprepared for the assault, and the speech froze some Democrats from supporting the nomination and gave Kennedy and other Bork opponents time to prepare the case against him.&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-73&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chaddock&gt;{{cite news|title=Court nominees will trigger rapid response|newspaper=[[Christian Science Monitor]]|date=July 7, 2005|accessdate=August 10, 2007|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2005/0707/p02s01-uspo.html|author=Chaddock, Gail Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the September 1987 Judiciary Committee hearings began, Kennedy challenged Bork forcefully on civil rights, privacy, women's rights, and other issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-4&quot;/&gt;  Bork's own demeanor hurt him,&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-73&quot;/&gt; and the nomination was defeated both in committee and the full Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-4&quot;/&gt;  The tone of the Bork battle changed the way Washington worked – with controversial nominees or candidates now experiencing all-out war waged against them – and the ramifications of it were still being felt two decades later.&lt;ref name=Miranda/&gt;&lt;ref name=Chaddock/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', p. 428.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1988 presidential election, Kennedy supported the eventual Democratic nominee, Massachusetts Governor [[Michael Dukakis]], from the start of the campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 407, 439.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the fall, Dukakis lost to [[George H.

Malone]] in the easiest race of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy remained a powerful force in the Senate.  In 1988 Kennedy co-sponsored an amendment to the [[Fair Housing Act]] of 1968, which prohibits discrimination in the rental, sale, marketing, and financing of the nation's housing; the amendment strengthened the ability of the [[Office of Fair Housing and Equal Opportunity]] to enforce the Act and expanded the protected classes to include disabled persons and families with children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=sGsaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1ioEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6887,1166518&amp;dq=kennedy+fair-housing-act&amp;hl=en | title=Senate approves fair housing bill | agency=[[Los Angeles Times]] | newspaper=[[The Milwaukee Journal]] | date=August 3, 1988 | page=3A}}&lt;/ref&gt; After prolonged negotiations during 1989 with Bush chief of staff [[John H.

===Fall and rise===
Kennedy's personal life came to dominate his image. In 1989 the European [[paparazzi]] stalked him on a vacation there and photographed him having sex on a motorboat.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-5&quot;/&gt; In February 1990, [[Michael Kelly (editor)|Michael Kelly]] published his long, thorough profile &quot;Ted Kennedy on the Rocks&quot; in ''[[GQ]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://men.style.com/gq/features/landing?id=content_5585 | title=Ted Kennedy on the Rocks | author=Kelly, Michael | magazine=[[GQ]] | date=February 1990 | accessdate=April 19, 2009 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071101021225/http://men.style.com/gq/features/landing?id=content_5585 |archivedate = November 1, 2007 | authorlink= Michael Kelly (editor)}}&lt;/ref&gt; It captured Kennedy as &quot;an aging Irish boyo clutching a bottle and diddling a blonde,&quot; portrayed him as an out-of-control [[English Regency|Regency]] [[Rake (character)|rake]], and brought his behavior to the forefront of public attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;kelly&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-83&quot;/&gt;  The death from cancer of brother-in-law [[Stephen Edward Smith]] in August 1990 left Kennedy emotionally bereft at the loss of a close family member and troubleshooter.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, ''The Shadow President'', pp. 86–88.&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy pushed on, but even his legislative successes, such as the [[Civil Rights Act of 1991]], which expanded employee rights in discrimination cases, came at the cost of being criticized for compromising with Republicans and Southern Democrats.&lt;ref name=&quot;time-10-best&quot;/&gt;

On [[Easter weekend]] 1991, Kennedy was at a get-together at the family's [[Palm Beach, Florida]] estate when, restless and maudlin after reminiscing about his brother-in-law, he left for a late-night visit to a local bar, getting his son [[Patrick J. Kennedy|Patrick]] and nephew [[William Kennedy Smith]] to accompany him.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-94&quot;&gt;Hersh, ''The Shadow President'', pp. 89, 94–97.&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick Kennedy and Smith returned with women they met there, Michelle Cassone and Patricia Bowman.  Cassone said that Ted Kennedy subsequently walked in on her and Patrick, dressed only in a nightshirt and with a weird look on his face.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-94&quot;/&gt;  Smith and Bowman went out on the beach, where they had sex that he said was consensual and she said was rape.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-5&quot;/&gt;  The local police made a delayed investigation; soon Kennedy sources were feeding the press with negative information about Bowman's background and several mainstream newspapers broke a taboo by publishing her name.&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-94&quot;/&gt;  The case quickly became a [[media frenzy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-94&quot;/&gt;  While not directly implicated in the case, Kennedy became the frequent butt of jokes on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'' and other late-night television programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', p. 487.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine said Kennedy was being perceived as a &quot;Palm Beach boozer, lout and tabloid grotesque&quot; while ''[[Newsweek]]'' said Kennedy was &quot;the living symbol of the family flaws.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, ''The Shadow President'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with Bork, the other most contentious Supreme Court nomination in United States history has been the one for [[Clarence Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;Barone and Cohen, ''Almanac of American Politics'' 2008, p. 364.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Clarence Thomas Supreme Court nomination|When the Thomas hearings began]] in September 1991, Kennedy pressed Thomas on his unwillingness to express an opinion about ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', but the nomination appeared headed for success.&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt;  But when the sexual harassment charges by [[Anita Hill]] broke the following month, and the nomination battle dominated public discourse, Kennedy was hamstrung by his past reputation and the ongoing developments in the William Kennedy Smith case.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-493&quot;/&gt; He said almost nothing until the third day of the Thomas–Hill hearings, and when he did it was criticized by Hill supporters for being too little, too late.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-5&quot;/&gt;

Biographer [[Adam Clymer]] rates Kennedy's silence during the Thomas hearings as the worst moment of his Senate career.&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-493&quot;&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 493–499.&lt;/ref&gt;  Writer [[Anna Quindlen]] said &quot;[Kennedy] let us down because he had to; he was muzzled by the facts of his life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-493&quot;/&gt; On the day before the full Senate vote, Kennedy gave an impassioned speech against Thomas, declaring that the treatment of Hill had been &quot;shameful&quot; and that &quot;[t]o give the benefit of the doubt to Judge Thomas is to say that Judge Thomas is more important than the Supreme Court.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Welch, William | title='Benefit of the Doubt' – Key Senators Give Thomas Support for Confirmation | newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]] | date=October 15, 1991 | url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19911015&amp;slug=1311090}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He then voted against the nomination.&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-493&quot;/&gt;  Thomas was confirmed by a 52–48 margin, the narrowest ever for a successful nomination.&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-493&quot;/&gt;

Due to the Palm Beach media attention and the Thomas hearings, Kennedy's public image suffered. A [[Gallup Poll]] gave Kennedy a very low 22&amp;nbsp;percent national approval rating.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-5&quot;/&gt;  A ''[[Boston Herald]]''/[[WCVB-TV]] poll found that 62&amp;nbsp;percent of Massachusetts citizens thought Kennedy should not run for reelection, by a 2-to-1 margin thought Kennedy has misled authorities in the Palm Beach investigation, and had Kennedy losing a hypothetical Senate race to Governor [[William Weld]] by 25&amp;nbsp;points.&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, ''The Shadow President'', p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;
Meanwhile, at a June 17, 1991 dinner party, Kennedy saw [[Victoria Reggie Kennedy|Victoria Anne Reggie]], a Washington lawyer at [[Keck, Mahin &amp; Cate]], a divorced mother of two, and the daughter of an old Kennedy family ally, [[Louisiana]] judge [[Edmund Reggie]].&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-492&quot;&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 492–493.&lt;/ref&gt;  They began dating and by September were in a serious relationship.&lt;ref name=&quot;clymer-492&quot;/&gt;  In a late October speech at the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]], Kennedy sought to begin a political recovery, saying: &quot;I am painfully aware that the criticism directed at me in recent months involves far more than disagreements with my positions ... [It] involves the disappointment of friends and many others who rely on me to fight the good fight. To them I say, I recognize my own shortcomings — the faults in the conduct of my private life. I realize that I alone am responsible for them, and I am the one who must confront them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-5&quot;/&gt;  In December 1991, the William Kennedy Smith rape trial was held; it was nationally televised and the most watched until the [[O.

===Carrying on===
Kennedy's role as a liberal lion in the Senate came to the fore in 1995, when the [[Republican Revolution]] took control and legislation intending to fulfill the [[Contract with America]] was coming from [[Newt Gingrich]]'s House of Representatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-155&quot;&gt;Hersh, ''The Shadow President'', pp. 155–158.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Democrats in the Senate and the country overall were depressed, but Kennedy rallied forces to combat the Republicans.&lt;ref name=&quot;hersh-155&quot;/&gt;  By the beginning of 1996, the Republicans had overreached; most of the Contract had failed to pass the Senate; and the Democrats could once again move forward with legislation, almost all of it coming out of Kennedy's staff.&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, ''The Shadow President'', pp. 163–164.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the failure of the Clinton health care plan, Kennedy went against his past strategy and sought incremental measures instead.&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', p. 570.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy worked with Republican Senator [[Nancy Kassebaum]] to create and pass the [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act]] in 1996, which set new marks for portability of insurance and confidentiality of records.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-6&quot;/&gt;  The same year, Kennedy's [[Mental Health Parity Act]] forced insurance companies to treat mental health payments the same as others with respect to limits reached.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-6&quot;/&gt;  In 1997, Kennedy was the prime mover behind the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Hatch Joins Kennedy&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Robert | last=Pear | title= Hatch Joins Kennedy to Back a Health Program | date=March 14, 1997 | newspaper=The New York Times | url =http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=980CE4D81E39F937A25750C0A961958260 | accessdate = January 6, 2008 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which used increased tobacco taxes to fund the largest expansion of taxpayer-funded health insurance coverage for children in the U.S. since [[Medicaid]] began in the 1960s.

Kennedy was a stalwart backer of President Clinton during the 1998 [[Lewinsky scandal]], often trying to cheer up the president when he was gloomiest and getting him to add past Kennedy staffer [[Greg Craig]] to his defense team, which helped improve the president's fortunes.&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 600–603.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the trial after the 1999 [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton]], Kennedy voted to acquit Clinton on both charges, saying &quot;Republicans in the House of Representatives, in their partisan vendetta against the President, have wielded the impeachment power in precisely the way the framers rejected, recklessly and without regard for the Constitution or the will of the American people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/13/us/clinton-s-acquittal-excerpts-senators-talk-about-their-votes-impeachment-trial.html?pagewanted=4 | title=Clinton's Acquittal: Excerpts: Senators Talk About Their Votes in the Impeachment Trial | newspaper=The New York Times | date=February 13, 1999 | accessdate=May 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 1999, tragedy struck the Kennedy family again when a [[Piper PA-32R|Piper Saratoga]] light aircraft [[John F. Kennedy, Jr. plane crash|crashed]] into the Atlantic Ocean off the coast of [[Martha's Vineyard]]. The accident killed its pilot [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.]], and also [[Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy|his wife]] and sister-in-law.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-7&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2009/02/22/chapter_7_the_patriarch/ | title=Chapter 7: The Patriarch: Their sorrows, his cause | author=Aucoin, Don | newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=February 22, 2009 | accessdate=May 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As patriarch, Ted consoled his extended family along with President Clinton at the public memorial service.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-7&quot;/&gt; He paraphrased [[William Butler Yeats]] by saying of his nephew: &quot;We dared to think, in that other Irish phrase, that this John Kennedy would live to comb gray hair, with his beloved Carolyn by his side. But like his father, he had every gift but length of years.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-7&quot;/&gt; Ted now served as a role model for [[Maria Shriver]], [[Kerry Kennedy Cuomo]], [[Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.]], [[Joseph Patrick Kennedy II]], and other family members.&lt;ref&gt;Clymer, ''A Biography'', pp. 604–605.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' wrote of the changed role: &quot;It underscored the evolution that surprised so many people who knew the Kennedys: Teddy, the baby of the family, who had grown into a man who could sometimes be dissolute and reckless, had become the steady, indispensable patriarch, the one the family turned to in good times and bad.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-7&quot;/&gt;

===2000s===
Kennedy had an easy time with [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 2000|his re-election to the Senate in 2000]], as Republican lawyer and entrepreneur [[Jack E. Robinson III]] was sufficiently damaged by his past personal record that Republican state party officials refused to endorse him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.businessweek.com/archives/2000/b3706108.arc.htm | title=Commentary: A Two-Party System in Name Only  | author=Symonds, William | magazine=Business Week | date=November 6, 2000 | accessdate=June 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy got 73&amp;nbsp;percent of the general election vote, with Robinson splitting the rest with [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] [[Carla Howell]].  During the [[United States presidential election in Florida, 2000|long, disputed post-presidential election battle in Florida in 2000]], Kennedy supported Vice President [[Al Gore]]'s legal actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/09/us/contesting-vote-vice-president-miraculous-revival-brings-elation-but-no-rest-for.html | title=A Miraculous Revival Brings Elation but No Rest for Gore | author=Seelye, Katharine Q. | newspaper=The New York Times | date=December 9, 2000 | accessdate=June 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the bitter contest was over, many Democrats in Congress did not want to work with incoming President [[George W. Bush]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-6&quot;/&gt;  Kennedy, however, saw Bush as genuinely interested in a major overhaul of elementary and secondary education, Bush saw Kennedy as a potential major ally in the Senate, and the two partnered together on the legislation.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tac080105&quot;/&gt;  Kennedy accepted provisions governing mandatory student testing and teacher accountability that other Democrats and the [[National Education Association]] did not like, in return for increased funding levels for education.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-6&quot;/&gt;  The [[No Child Left Behind Act]] was passed by Congress in May and June 2001 and signed into law by Bush in January 2002.  Kennedy soon became disenchanted with the implementation of the act, however, saying for 2003 that it was $9 billion short of the $29 billion authorized.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-6&quot;/&gt;  Kennedy said, &quot;The tragedy is that these long overdue reforms are finally in place, but the funds are not,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tac080105&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/aug/01/00025/ | title=Leaving No Child Left Behind  | author=Antle III, W. James | magazine=[[The American Conservative]] | date=August 1, 2005 | accessdate=June 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accused Bush of not living up to his personal word on the matter.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time-10-best&quot;/&gt;  Other Democrats concluded that Kennedy's penchant for cross-party deals had gotten the better of him.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-6&quot;/&gt;  The White House defended its spending levels given the context of two wars going on.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-6&quot;/&gt;

Kennedy was in his Senate offices meeting with First Lady [[Laura Bush]] when the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001, attacks]] took place.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-7&quot;/&gt;  Two of the airplanes involved had taken off from Boston, and in the following weeks, Kennedy telephoned each of the 177 Massachusetts families who had lost members in the attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-7&quot;/&gt; He pushed through legislation that provided healthcare and grief counseling benefits for the families, and recommended the appointment of his former chief of staff [[Kenneth Feinberg]] as Special Master of the government's [[September 11th Victim Compensation Fund]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-7&quot;/&gt;  Kennedy maintained an ongoing bond with the Massachusetts 9/11 families in subsequent years.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-7&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.necn.com/Boston/Politics/2009/06/16/911-widow-reflects-on/1245158107.html | title=9/11 widow reflects on relationship with Senator Kennedy | author=King, Alison | publisher=[[New England Cable News]] | date=June 16, 2009 | accessdate=June 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the attacks, Kennedy was a supporter of the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|American-led 2001 overthrow]] of the [[Taliban|Taliban government]] in [[Afghanistan]]. However, Kennedy strongly opposed the [[Iraq War]] from the start, and was one of 23 senators voting against the [[Iraq War Resolution]] in October 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-7&quot;/&gt;  As the [[Iraqi insurgency]] grew in subsequent years, Kennedy pronounced that the conflict was &quot;Bush's Vietnam.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-7&quot;/&gt;  In response to losses of Massachusetts service personnel to roadside bombs, Kennedy became vocal on the issue of [[Humvee]] vulnerability, and co-sponsored enacted 2005 legislation that sped up production and Army procurement of up-armored Humvees.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-7&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Kennedy Feinstein Bush signing.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Kennedy at the 2002 signing of a border security bill, with Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] and President [[George W. Bush]]]]
Despite the strained relationship between Kennedy and Bush over No Child Left Behind spending, the two attempted to work together again on extending [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] to cover prescription drug benefits.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-6&quot;/&gt;  Kennedy's strategy was again doubted by other Democrats, but he saw the proposed $400 billion program as an opportunity that should not be missed.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-6&quot;/&gt;  However, when the final formulation of the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]] contained provisions to steer seniors towards private plans, Kennedy switched to opposing it.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-6&quot;/&gt;  It passed in late 2003, and led Kennedy to again say he had been betrayed by the Bush administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-6&quot;/&gt;

In the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2004|2004 Democratic Party presidential primaries]], Kennedy campaigned heavily for fellow Massachusetts Senator [[John Kerry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-7&quot;/&gt; and lent his chief of staff, [[Mary Beth Cahill]], to the Kerry campaign.  Kennedy's appeal was effective among blue collar and minority voters, and helped Kerry stage a come-from-behind win in the [[Iowa Democratic caucuses, 2004|Iowa caucuses]] that propelled him on to the Democratic nomination.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-7&quot;/&gt;

After Bush won a second term in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 general election]], Kennedy continued to oppose him on Iraq and many other issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usa051708&quot;/&gt;  However, Kennedy sought to partner with Republicans again on the matter of [[immigration reform]] in the context of the ongoing [[United States immigration debate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-6&quot;/&gt;  Kennedy was chair of the [[United States Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Border Security, and Refugees]], and in 2005, Kennedy teamed with Republican Senator [[John McCain]] on the [[Secure America and Orderly Immigration Act]].  The &quot;McCain-Kennedy bill&quot; did not reach a Senate vote, but provided a template for further attempts at dealing comprehensively with legalization, [[guest worker program]]s, and [[Illegal immigration to the United States#Enforcement|border enforcement]] components.  Kennedy returned again with the [[Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007]], which was sponsored by an ideologically diverse, bipartisan group of senators&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18842287/ | title='Gang of 12' mulls over immigration bill | agency=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=[[MSNBC]] | date=May 24, 2007 | accessdate=May 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and having strong support from the Bush administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-6&quot;/&gt;  The bill aroused furious grassroots opposition among [[talk radio]] listeners and others as an &quot;amnesty&quot; program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Preston, Julia | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/10/washington/10oppose.html | title=Grass Roots Roared and Immigration Plan Collapsed | newspaper=The New York Times | date=July 10, 2007 | accessdate=July 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and despite Kennedy's last-minute attempts to salvage it, failed a cloture vote in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/09/washington/09immig.html | title=Kennedy Plea Was Last Gasp for Immigration Bill | author=Hulse, Carl | newspaper=The New York Times | date=June 9, 2007 | accessdate=June 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kennedy was philosophical about the defeat, saying that often took several attempts across multiple Congresses for this type of legislation to build enough momentum for passage.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg-series-6&quot;/&gt;

In 2006, Kennedy released a children's book from the view of his dog [[Splash (dog)|Splash]], ''[[My Senator and Me: A Dog's-Eye View of Washington, D.C.|My Senator and Me: A Dog's-Eye View of Washington, D.C]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Ted Kennedy pens children's book | publisher=[[CBC News]] | date=January 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2006, Kennedy released a political history entitled ''America Back on Track''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5353270 | title=Sen.

==Political positions==
{{Main|Political positions of Ted Kennedy}}
Political scientists gauge [[ideology]] in part by comparing the annual ratings by the [[Americans for Democratic Action]] (ADA) with the ratings by the [[American Conservative Union]] (ACU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mayer, William|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A28761-2004Mar27?language=printer|title=Kerry's Record Rings a Bell|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=August 24, 2008|date=March 28, 2004|quote=The question of how to measure a senator's or representative's ideology is one that political scientists regularly need to answer. For more than 30 years, the standard method for gauging ideology has been to use the annual ratings of lawmakers' votes by various interest groups, notably the Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) and the American Conservative Union (ACU).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy had a lifetime [[American liberalism|liberal]] 90&amp;nbsp;percent score from the ADA through 2004,&lt;!-- Really want through 2007 or 2008, but ADA does not supply lifetime averages, and have not yet found a more recent reliable media source for it--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/judicial/2005-09-11-judiciarycommitteeprofiles_x.htm|title=Judging Judge Roberts: A look at the Judiciary Committee | newspaper=USA Today | date=September 12, 2005 | accessdate=March 2, 2009|author=Kiely, Kathy}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the ACU awarded Kennedy a lifetime [[American conservatism|conservative]] rating of 2&amp;nbsp;percent through 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acuratings.org/2008senate.htm|title= 2008 U.S. Senate Votes|publisher=[[American Conservative Union]]|accessdate=March 20, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}} Lifetime rating is given.&lt;/ref&gt;
Using another metric, Kennedy had a lifetime average liberal score of 88.7&amp;nbsp;percent, according to a ''[[National Journal]]'' analysis that places him ideologically as the third-most liberal senator of all those in office in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Committed Senate Liberals|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/njmagazine/cs_20090228_5247.php|date=February 28, 2009|accessdate=March 3, 2009|magazine=[[National Journal]]}} {{Dead link|date=November 2010|bot=H3llBot}} Kennedy's composite average only goes back to 1981, when ''National Journal'' began their ratings.&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of [[Princeton University]] and Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of [[Stanford University]] examined some of the difficulties in making this kind of analysis, and found Kennedy likely to be the 8th-to-15th-most liberal Senator during the [[108th Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |format=PDF |url=http://www.apsanet.org/imgtest/TheMostLiberalSenator-Clinton.pdf |title=&quot;The Most Liberal Senator&quot;? Analyzing and Interpreting Congressional Roll Calls |journal=[[Political Science &amp; Politics]] |month=October |year=2004 |pages=805–811 |author1=Clinton, Joshua D |author2=Jackman, Simon |author3=Rivers, Doug }}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[The Almanac of American Politics]]'' rates congressional votes as liberal or conservative on the [[political spectrum]], in three policy areas: economic, social, and foreign. For 2005–2006, Kennedy's average ratings were as follows: the economic rating was 91&amp;nbsp;percent liberal and 0&amp;nbsp;percent conservative, the social rating was 89&amp;nbsp;percent liberal and 5&amp;nbsp;percent conservative, and the foreign rating was 96&amp;nbsp;percent liberal and 0&amp;nbsp;percent conservative.&lt;ref name=&quot;aap-08&quot;&gt;Barone and Cohen, ''Almanac of American Politics'' 2008, p. 791. In 2005, the ratings were E 95 0, S 90 0, F 95 0; in 2006, E 87 0, S 88 11, F 98 0.  Examination of two previous volumes of ''The Almanac of American Politics'' shows similar scores for 2001–2002 and 1997–1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[interest group]]s gave Kennedy scores or grades as to how well his votes aligned with the positions of each group.&lt;ref name=&quot;pvs&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=53305 | title=Senator Edward M. 'Ted' Kennedy, Sr. (MA) | publisher=[[Project Vote Smart]] | accessdate=March 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] gave him an 84&amp;nbsp;percent lifetime score as of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://action.aclu.org/site/VoteCenter?congress=111&amp;repId=320&amp;session_num=0&amp;page=legScore|title=ACLU Congressional Scorecard|publisher=[[American Civil Liberties Union]]|accessdate=March 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the 1990s and 2000s, [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] and [[Planned Parenthood]] typically gave Kennedy ratings of 100&amp;nbsp;percent, while the [[National Right to Life Committee]] typically gave him a rating of less than 10&amp;nbsp;percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;pvs&quot;/&gt;
The [[Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]] gave Kennedy a lifetime rating of 100&amp;nbsp;percent through 2002, while [[National Rifle Association]] gave Kennedy a lifetime grade of 'F' (failing) as of 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;pvs&quot;/&gt;

==Cultural and political image==
When he died, Kennedy was the [[List of United States Senators in the 111th Congress by seniority|second most senior]] member of the Senate, after [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President pro tempore]] [[Robert Byrd]] of [[West Virginia]], and the third-longest serving senator of all time, behind Byrd and [[Strom Thurmond]] of [[South Carolina]] (he was passed later in 2009 by [[Daniel Inouye]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Senate-longest&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.senate.gov/senators/Biographical/longest_serving.htm |title=Longest Serving Senators|accessdate=November 17, 2009 |publisher=[[United States Senate]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
