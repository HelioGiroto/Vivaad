==Early life==
Cruise was born in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]], New York, the son of Mary Lee (née Pfeiffer), a special education teacher, and Thomas Cruise Mapother III (died 1984),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/europe/magazine/2002/0701/cruise/story2.html |title=Being Tom Cruise |work=Time|accessdate=June 5, 2011}} {{Dead link|date=June 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; an electrical engineer.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmref&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/26/Tom-Cruise.html|title=Tom Cruise Biography|accessdate=October 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruise has three sisters, Lee Anne, Marian, and Cass. Cruise's surname originates from his great-grandfather, Thomas Cruise O'Mara, who was adopted by a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] immigrant and renamed &quot;Thomas Cruise Mapother&quot;.&lt;ref name=oid&gt;Stated on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' interview with Cruise, January 11, 2004; can be viewed at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2xYsFLyTsDU&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;genes 1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Genealogy.com: Ancestry of Tom Cruise|url=http://www.genealogy.com/famousfolks/tomc/index.htm#toc|accessdate=March 31, 2010|publisher=[[Ancestry.com|Genealogy.com]]|date=August 8, 2002|work=Genealogy.com website}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC Wales 2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=North East Wales: Cruise's Welsh roots uncovered|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/north_east/3407861.stm|accessdate=March 31, 2010|publisher=BBC  |date=January 18, 2004|work=BBC News website}} {{Dead link|date=August 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruise is of [[German American|German]], Irish, and English ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/mapother.html |title=Ancestry of Tom Cruise |publisher=Wargs.com |accessdate=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in near poverty, and had a Catholic upbringing. The family was dominated by his abusive father, whom Cruise has described as &quot;a merchant of chaos&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;parade&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parade.com/articles/editions/2006/edition_04-09-2006/Tom_Cruise_cover|title=I Can Create Who I Am|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|date=April 9, 2006|accessdate=February 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was beaten by his father, who Cruise has said was a bully and coward. {{quote|He was the kind of person where, if something goes wrong, they kick you. It was a great lesson in my life—how he’d lull you in, make you feel safe and then, bang! For me, it was like, 'There's something wrong with this guy. Don't trust him. Be careful around him.'&lt;ref name=&quot;parade&quot;/&gt;}}

Cruise's family spent part of his childhood in Canada. They moved to the [[Ottawa]] suburb of [[Beacon Hill, Ottawa|Beacon Hill]] in late 1971 so that Cruise's father could take a position as a defense consultant with the [[Canadian Forces|Canadian Armed Forces]].
&lt;ref name=&quot;Unauthorized&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i.usatoday.net/life/books/tom_cruise_excerpt.pdf|title=Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography|accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; There, Cruise attended the just opened [[Robert Hopkins Public School]] for much of grade four as well as grade five.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unauthorized&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocdsb.ca/sch/20102011%20Elementary%20School%20Profile/RHOP.pdf|title=Robert Hopkins School Profile|accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was while in grade four that Cruise first became involved in drama, under the tutelage of George Steinburg. Cruise and six other boys put on an improvised play to music called ''IT'' at the Carlton Elementary School drama festival.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unauthorized&quot; /&gt; Drama organizer Val Wright, who was in the audience that night, reflected that &quot;the movement and improvisation were excellent. It was a classic ensemble piece&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unauthorized&quot; /&gt; Cruise also enjoyed sports at the school including playing floor hockey, though he was known more for his aggression than his talent. For grade six Cruise went to [[Henry Munro Middle School]]. However, in the spring of that year Cruise's mother left his father, taking Cruise and his sisters back to the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unauthorized&quot; /&gt;

He briefly attended a [[Franciscan]] [[seminary]] in [[Cincinnati]] on a church scholarship and aspired to become a Catholic priest.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography'', [http://books.google.com/books?id=zB_eC5Y8OEkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=tom+cruise+an+unauthorized+biography&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=t7dGTvTqKcLngQe1sunSBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=seminary&amp;f=false pp.24-26].&lt;/ref&gt; In his senior year, he played football for the varsity team as a linebacker, but he was cut from the squad after getting caught drinking beer before a game.&lt;ref&gt;Cf.

Retrieved on 2012-06-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Acting===
Cruise first appeared in a very small [[bit part]] in the 1981 film ''[[Endless Love (film)|Endless Love]]'', followed by a major supporting role as a crazed military school student in ''[[Taps (film)|Taps]]'' later that year. In 1983, Cruise was part of the ensemble cast of ''[[The Outsiders (film)|The Outsiders]]''. That same year he appeared in ''[[All the Right Moves]]'' and ''[[Risky Business]]'', which has been described as &quot;A Generation-X classic, and a career-maker for Tom Cruise&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;rottentomatoes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/1017641-risky_business/ |title=Risky Business|publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which, along with 1986's ''[[Top Gun]]'', cemented his status as a [[Superstar]]. Cruise also played the male lead (Jack O' the Green) in ''[[Legend (film)|Legend]]'' (released 1986).

Cruise followed up ''Top Gun'' with ''[[The Color of Money]]'', which came out the same year, and which paired him with  [[Paul Newman]]. 1988 saw him star in ''[[Cocktail (1988 film)|Cocktail]]'', which earned him a nomination for the [[Razzie Award for Worst Actor]]. Later that year he starred with [[Dustin Hoffman]] in ''[[Rain Man]]'', which won the [[Academy Award for Best Film]] and Cruise the [[Kansas City Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actor]]. Cruise portrayed real-life paralyzed [[Vietnam War]] veteran [[Ron Kovic]] in 1989's ''[[Born on the Fourth of July (film)|Born on the Fourth of July]]'', which earned him a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Drama]], the [[Chicago Film Critics Association Award for Best Actor]], the [[People's Choice Award]] for Favorite Motion Picture Actor, a nomination for [[BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role]], and Cruise's first Best Actor Academy Award nomination.

Cruise's next films were ''[[Days of Thunder]]'' (1990) and ''[[Far and Away]]'' (1992), both of which co-starred then-wife [[Nicole Kidman]] as his love interest. In 1994, Cruise starred along with [[Brad Pitt]], [[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Christian Slater]] in [[Neil Jordan]]'s ''[[Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles|Interview with the Vampire]]'', a gothic drama/horror film that was based on [[Anne Rice]]'s [[Interview with the Vampire|best-selling novel]]. The film was well received, although Rice was initially quite outspoken in her criticism of Cruise having been cast in the film, as [[Julian Sands]] was her first choice. Upon seeing the film however, she paid $7,740 for a two-page ad in ''[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]]'' praising his performance and apologizing for her previous doubts about him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,305073,00.html Go Figure], ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'', December 30, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Cruise appeared as superspy [[Ethan Hunt]] in the reboot of ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]],'' which he produced. In 1996, he took on the title role in ''[[Jerry Maguire]]'', for which he earned a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Golden Globe]] and his second nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Academy Award]]. In 1999, Cruise costarred with Kidman in the erotic [[Stanley Kubrick]] film ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'', and took a rare supporting role as a motivational speaker Frank T.J. Mackey in ''[[Magnolia (film)|Magnolia]]'', for which he received another [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture|Golden Globe]] and nomination for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Academy Award]].

In 2000, Cruise returned as [[Ethan Hunt]] in the second installment of the ''Mission Impossible'' films, releasing ''[[Mission: Impossible II]]''. The film was directed by Hong Kong director [[John Woo]] and branded with his [[gun fu]] style, and it continued the series' blockbuster success at the box office, taking in almost $547M in worldwide figures, like its predecessor, being the third highest grossing film of the year. Cruise received an [[MTV Movie Award]] as Best Male Performance for this film. His next five films were major critical and commercial successes.&lt;ref name=boxofficemojotomcruise&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?view=Actor&amp;id=tomcruise.htm |title=Tom Cruise |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/celebrity/tom_cruise/ |title=Tom Cruise Movies, News, and Pictures on Rotten Tomatoes |publisher=Rottentomatoes.com |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Cruise starred in the romantic thriller ''[[Vanilla Sky]]'' (2001) with [[Cameron Diaz]] and [[Penélope Cruz]]. In 2002, Cruise starred in the [[dystopia]]n science fiction thriller, ''[[Minority Report (film)|Minority Report]]'' which was directed by [[Steven Spielberg]] and based on the science fiction short story by [[Philip K. Dick]].

In 2003, he starred in the [[Edward Zwick]]'s historical drama ''[[The Last Samurai]]'', for which he received a Golden Globe nomination as best actor. In 2005, Cruise worked again with Steven Spielberg in ''[[War of the Worlds (2005 film)|War of the Worlds]]'', a loose adaptation of the [[H. G. Wells]] [[The War of the Worlds|novel of the same name]], which became the fourth highest grossing film of the year with US$591.4&amp;nbsp;million worldwide. Also in 2005, he won the People's Choice Award for Favorite Male Movie Star, and the MTV Generation Award. Cruise was nominated for seven [[Saturn Awards]] between 2002 and 2009, winning once. Nine of the ten films he starred in during the decade made over $100&amp;nbsp;million at the box office.&lt;ref name=boxofficemojotomcruise/&gt;
[[File:Tom Cruise 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|Cruise in 2006]]
In 2006, he reprised his role as Ethan Hunt in the third installment of the ''Mission Impossible'' film series, ''[[Mission: Impossible III]]''. The film was more positively received by critics than its predecessor, and grossed nearly $400&amp;nbsp;million at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mi3.htm |title=Mission: Impossible III (2006) |publisher=Boxofficemojo.com |accessdate=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Cruise took a rare supporting role for the second time in ''[[Lions for Lambs]]'', which was a commercial disappointment. This was followed by an unrecognizable appearance as &quot;Less Grossman&quot; in the 2008 comedy ''[[Tropic Thunder]]'' with [[Ben Stiller]] and [[Jack Black]]. This performance earned Cruise a [[Golden Globe]] nomination. Cruise played the central role in the historical thriller ''[[Valkyrie (film)|Valkyrie]]'' released on December 25, 2008 to box office success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=valkyrie.htm |title=Valkyrie (2008) |publisher=Box Office Mojo |date=April 16, 2009 |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, Cruise's films have grossed over $6.5&amp;nbsp;billion worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;the-numbers.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/people/TCRUI.php |title=Tom Cruise – Box Office Data Movie Star |publisher=The-numbers.com |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, Cruise completed filming the action-comedy ''[[Knight and Day]]'', in which he re-teamed with former costar Cameron Diaz; the film was released on June 23, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knightanddaymovie.com/ |title=Knight and Day |publisher=Knightanddaymovie.com |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On February 9, 2010, Cruise confirmed that he would star in ''[[Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol]]'', the fourth installment in the ''[[Mission: Impossible (film series)|Mission:Impossible]]'' series. The film was released in December 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/35321981 |title=Cruise to star in ‘Mission: Impossible 4’ – Entertainment – Access Hollywood |publisher=MSNBC |date=February 9, 2010 |accessdate=July 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to high critical acclaim&lt;ref name=rt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/mission_impossible_ghost_protocol/ |title=Mission: Impossible Ghost Protocol (2011) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and box office success.&lt;ref name=&quot;ox&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=mi4.htm |title=Mission: Impossible – Ghost Protocol (2011) |work=[[Box Office Mojo]] |accessdate=April 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also Cruise's biggest commercial success to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;Overseas5&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Subers|first=Ray|title=Around-the-World Roundup: 'M:I-4' Passes $600 Million Worldwide|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/news/?id=3364&amp;p=.htm|accessdate=February 13, 2012|newspaper=[[Box Office Mojo]]|date=February 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 6, 2011, Cruise was awarded a humanitarian award from the Simon Wiesenthal Centre and Museum of Tolerance for his work as a dedicated philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itn.co.uk/home/18258/Cruise|title=Tom Cruise wins humanitarian award |publisher=ITN|date=May 7, 2011 |accessdate=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In mid-2011, Cruise started shooting the movie ''[[Rock of Ages (2012 film)|Rock of Ages]]'', in which he played the character [[Stacee Jaxx]]. The film was released in June 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/movies/tom-cruise-flaunts-abs-fake-tattoos-rock-ages-inspired-photo-shoot-w-magazine-article-1.1078665 | title=Tom Cruise flaunts his abs, fake tattoos in 'Rock of Ages'-inspired photo shoot for W magazine| first=Christina | last=Everett | work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News)]]|location=New York| date= May 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Producing===
Cruise partnered with his former talent agent [[Paula Wagner]] to form [[Cruise/Wagner Productions]] in 1993,&lt;ref name=&quot;MGM&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=MGM Partners With Tom Cruise and Paula Wagner to Form New United Artists |url=http://sev.prnewswire.com/entertainment/20061102/LATH10602112006-1.html |agency=PR Newswire |publisher=Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios |date=November 2, 2006 |quote= |archiveurl=http://www.unitedartists.com/popups/pr/release_08.html |archivedate=November 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the company has since co-produced several of Cruise's films, the first being ''[[Mission: Impossible (film)|Mission: Impossible]]'' in 1996 which was also Cruise's first project as a producer.

Cruise is noted as having negotiated some of the most lucrative film deals in Hollywood, and was described in 2005 by Hollywood economist [[Edward Jay Epstein]] as &quot;one of the most powerful – and richest – forces in Hollywood&quot;. Epstein argues that Cruise is one of the few producers (the others being [[George Lucas]], [[Steven Spielberg]] and [[Jerry Bruckheimer]]) who are regarded as able to guarantee the success of a billion-dollar film franchise. Epstein also contends that the public obsession with Cruise's tabloid controversies obscures full appreciation of Cruise's exceptional commercial prowess.&lt;ref name=&quot;Epstein&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Epstein|first=Edward Jay|authorlink=Edward Jay Epstein|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2121617/ |title=Tom Cruise Inc. – By Edward Jay Epstein – Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |author=Edward Jay Epstein |accessdate=October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruise/Wagner Productions, Cruise's film production company, is said to be developing a screenplay based on [[Erik Larson (author)|Erik Larson]]'s ''[[New York Times]]'' bestseller, ''[[The Devil in the White City]]'' about a real life serial killer, [[H. H. Holmes]], at [[Chicago]]'s [[World's Columbian Exposition]]. Kathryn Bigelow is attached to the project to produce and helm. Meanwhile, [[Leonardo DiCaprio]]'s production company, Appian Way, is also developing a film about Holmes and the [[World's Fair]], in which DiCaprio will star.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thezreview.co.uk/comingsoon/d/devilinthewhitecitythe.htm |title=The Devil In The White City movie, trailer,review,pics,pictures,poster,news,DVD|publisher=Thezreview.co.uk |accessdate=October 31, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080705065258/http://www.thezreview.co.uk/comingsoon/d/devilinthewhitecitythe.htm |archivedate = July 5, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Breakup with Paramount====
On August 22, 2006, [[Paramount Pictures]] announced it was ending its 14-year relationship with Cruise. In the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', chairman of [[Viacom]] (Paramount's parent company) [[Sumner Redstone]] cited the economic damage to Cruise's value as an actor and producer from his controversial public behavior and views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/08/22/news/newsmakers/cruise_paramount/index.htm?cnn=yes |title=CNN: Paramount Pictures cuts ties with Tom Cruise |publisher=CNN  |date=August 23, 2006 |accessdate=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalledger.com/artman/publish/article_27267912.shtml |title=Sumner Redstone Rebuke of Tom Cruise: Now What? |publisher=National Ledger |accessdate=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruise/Wagner Productions responded that Paramount's announcement was a face-saving move after the production company had successfully sought alternative financing from [[private equity]] firms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lieberman |first=David |url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2006-08-23-hedge-films-usat_x.htm |title=Cruise seeks financial backing from hedge funds |work=USA Today |date=August 24, 2006 |accessdate=August 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industry analysts such as Edward Jay Epstein commented that the real reason for the split was most likely Paramount's discontent over Cruise/Wagner's exceptionally large share of DVD sales from the ''Mission: Impossible'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/d817b680-33a0-11db-981f-0000779e2340.html The Financial Times: Paramount vs. Cruise: all down the killer cut] by [[Edward Jay Epstein]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nicole |last=Sperling |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/thr/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003052563 |title=Biz eyeing economics of Cruise-Par breakup: DVD slowdown forcing restraint |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |date=August 24, 2006 |accessdate=August 8, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Management of United Artists====
In November 2006, Cruise and Paula Wagner announced that they had taken over [[United Artists]] film studio.&lt;ref name=&quot;MGM&quot;/&gt; Cruise acts as a producer and star in films for United Artists, while Wagner serves as UA's chief executive. Production began in 2007 of ''[[Valkyrie (film)|Valkyrie]]'', a thriller based on the July 20, 1944 assassination attempt against [[Adolf Hitler]]. The film was acquired in March 2007 by United Artists. On March 21, 2007 Cruise signed on to play [[Claus von Stauffenberg]], the [[protagonist]]. This project marks the second production to be greenlighted since Cruise and Wagner took control of United Artists. The first was its inaugural film, ''[[Lions for Lambs]]'', directed by [[Robert Redford]] and starring Redford, [[Meryl Streep]] and Cruise. ''Lambs'' was released on November 9, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsmax.com/archives/ic/2007/3/21/73153.shtml?s=en |title=Tom Cruise Takes on Adolf Hitler |publisher=Newsmax.com |date=2007-03-21 |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; opening to unimpressive box office revenue and critical reception. In August 2008, Wagner stepped down from her position at United Artists; she retains her stake in UA, which combined with Cruise's share amounts to 30 percent of the studio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2008/aug/14/business/fi-wagner14 Paula Wagner plans to step down at United Artists], an August 2008 article from the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===Litigation===
During Cruise's marriage to Nicole Kidman, the couple endured public speculation about their sex life and rumors that Cruise was gay. In 1998, he successfully sued the ''[[Daily Express]]'', a British tabloid which alleged that his marriage to Kidman was a [[sham marriage|sham]] designed to cover up his homosexuality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/203779.stm |title=Cruise and Kidman win libel case |publisher=BBC News |date=1998-10-29 |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2001 he filed a lawsuit against gay porn actor [[Kyle Bradford|Chad Slater]]. Slater had allegedly told the celebrity magazine ''Actustar'' that he had had an affair with Cruise. Both Slater and Cruise denied this,{{Clarify|date=May 2012}} and in August 2001, Slater was ordered to pay $10&amp;nbsp;million to Cruise in damages after Slater declared he could not afford to defend himself against the suit and would therefore default.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ricardo Cestero Tom Cruise's lawyer |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/2664159.stm |title=Cruise wins 'gay' claims legal battle |publisher=BBC News |date=2003-01-16 |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruise also sued Michael Davis, publisher of ''Bold Magazine'', who alleged but never confirmed that he had video that would prove Cruise was gay. The suit was dropped in exchange for a public statement by Davis that the video was not of Cruise, and that Cruise was heterosexual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/1686039.stm |title=Cruise gay claims dropped |publisher=BBC News |date=2001-12-01 |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''[[The Beast (newspaper)|The Beast]]''{{'}}s publication of their 50 Most Loathsome People of 2004, which included Cruise, Cruise's lawyer [[Bertram Fields]] threatened to sue. Seeing the opportunity for nationwide exposure, ''The Beast'' actively encouraged the lawsuit.

In early May 2008, Cruise reappeared on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' to celebrate 25 years in the film business. The feature was a two hour special: the first hour showed Oprah spending the day with Cruise at his home in [[Telluride, Colorado|Telluride]], Colorado on May 2.

===Scientology===
Cruise is an outspoken advocate for the [[Church of Scientology]]. He became involved with Scientology in 1990 through his first wife, Mimi Rogers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/showbiz/1791617.stm |title=Cruise lobbies over Scientology|publisher=BBC News |date=2002-01-30 |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has said that Scientology, specifically the [[L. Ron Hubbard]] [[Study Tech]], helped him overcome [[dyslexia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cruise credits Scientology for his success|publisher=msnbc.com|date=May 24, 2005|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7968809/|accessdate=May 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to promoting various programs that introduce people to Scientology, Cruise has campaigned for Scientology to be recognized as a religion in Europe. In 2005, the Paris city council revealed that Cruise had lobbied officials [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] and [[Jean-Claude Gaudin]], described him as a spokesman and militant for Scientology, and barred any further dealings with him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.examiner.ie/breaking/story.asp?j=182470131&amp;p=y8z47x994&amp;n=182471074&amp;x= |title=Paris snubs Scientology 'militant' Cruise |work=Irish Examiner|date=2005-07-13 |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prgparis.org/node/57 &quot;Tom Cruise ne sera pas citoyen d'honneur de Paris&quot;] (in French). July 12, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Cruise co-founded and raised donations for [[Downtown Medical]] to offer New York City [[9/11]] rescue workers [[Purification Rundown|detoxification therapy]] based on the works of L.

In January 2004, Tom Cruise said: &quot;I think psychiatry should be outlawed.&quot;&lt;ref name=Desai&gt;{{cite journal|last=Desai|first=Nimesh|title=Antipsychiatry: Meeting the challenge|journal=[[Indian Journal of Psychiatry]]|year=2005|month=Oct-Dec|volume=47|issue=4|pages=185–187|doi=10.4103/0019-5545.43048|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2921130/|accessdate=20 March 2012|pmid=20711302|pmc=2921130}}&lt;/ref&gt; A controversy erupted in 2005 after he openly criticized actress [[Brooke Shields]] for using the drug [[Paxil]] (paroxetine), an [[anti-depressant]] to which Shields attributes her recovery from [[postpartum depression]] after the birth of her first daughter in 2003. Cruise asserted that there is no such thing as a [[chemical imbalance]], and that psychiatry is a form of [[pseudoscience]]. Shields responded that Cruise &quot;should stick to saving the world from aliens and let women who are experiencing postpartum depression decide what treatment options are best for them&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Brooke Shields Lashes Out at Tom Cruise|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1067822,00.html|date=June 2, 2005|work=People}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a heated argument between [[Matt Lauer]] and Cruise on NBC's ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' on June 24, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/8344309/ &quot;In tense moment, Cruise calls Lauer 'glib{{'&quot;}}] [[msnbc.com]].

On January 15, 2008, a video produced by the Church of Scientology featuring an interview with Cruise was posted on [[YouTube]], showing Cruise discussing what being a Scientologist means to him.&lt;ref name=&quot;warne&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Warne | first =Dan | title ='Anonymous' threatens to 'dismantle' Church of Scientology via internet | work=[[APC Magazine]] | publisher=[[National Nine News]] | date =January 24, 2008 | url =http://www.apcmag.com/7905/anonymous_threatens_to_dismantle_church_of_scientology_via_internet | accessdate =January 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;knbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title =Hacker Group Declares War On Scientology: Group Upset Over Church's Handling Of Tom Cruise Video | publisher=[[KNBC]] |location=Los Angeles| date =January 24, 2008 | url =http://www.knbc.com/news/15132759/detail.html | accessdate =January 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Church of Scientology said the video had been &quot;pirated and edited&quot;, and was taken from a three-hour video produced for members of Scientology.&lt;ref name=&quot;knbc&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Church of Scientology Slams German Tabloid&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title =Report: Church of Scientology Slams German Tabloid for Publishing Comments Comparing Tom Cruise to Nazi Minister |publisher=Fox News | date =January 23, 2008 | url =http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,324885,00.html | accessdate =January 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; YouTube removed the Cruise video from their site under threat of litigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;vamosi anonymous hackers&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last =Vamosi | first =Robert | title =Anonymous hackers take on the Church of Scientology | work=[[CNET News]] | publisher=CNET Networks, Inc. | date =January 24, 2008 | url =http://www.news.com/8301-10789_3-9857666-57.html | accessdate =January 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cruise's more open attitude to Scientology has been attributed to the March 2004 departure of his publicist of 14 years, Pat Kingsley. He replaced her with his sister, fellow Scientologist Lee Anne DeVette, who served in that role until November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117932447?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1 |title=Cruise will go with pro|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first=Chris|last=Gardner|date= November 6, 2005|accessdate=October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; DeVette was replaced with Paul Bloch from the publicity firm Rogers and Cowan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://entertainment.tv.yahoo.com/entnews/eo/20051108/113151894008.html|title=Cruise Control Shifts Gears|date=November 8, 2005|publisher=Yahoo!
