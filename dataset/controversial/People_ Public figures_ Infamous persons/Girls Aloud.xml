'''Girls Aloud''' are&lt;!--DO NOT CHANGE, They have not split up.--&gt; an English-Irish&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hotpress.com/archive/4321155.html Nadine Coyle: I demanded an Irish flag for Girls Aloud album cover]&lt;/ref&gt; [[pop music|pop]] [[girl group]] based in [[London]]. They were created through the [[ITV1]] talent show ''[[Popstars: The Rivals]]'' in 2002. The group consists of [[Cheryl Cole]] (''née'' Tweedy), [[Nadine Coyle]], [[Sarah Harding]], [[Nicola Roberts]] and [[Kimberley Walsh]]. They are signed to [[Fascination Records]], a [[Polydor Records|Polydor]] imprint. The group achieved a string of twenty consecutive top ten singles, including four number ones: &quot;[[Sound of the Underground (song)|Sound of the Underground]]&quot;, &quot;[[I'll Stand by You]]&quot;, &quot;[[Walk This Way]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Promise (Girls Aloud song)|The Promsie]]. They also achieved two number one albums in the United Kingdom: ''[[The Sound of Girls Aloud: The Greatest Hits]]'' which sold over million copies and ''[[Out of Control (Girls Aloud album)|Out of Control]]''. All of their albums have been certified platinum. They have been nominated for five [[Brit Awards]], winning the 2009 Best Single for &quot;The Promise&quot;. 

Girls Aloud's collaborations with [[Brian Higgins (producer)|Brian Higgins]] and his songwriting and production team [[Xenomania]] have earned the group critical acclaim, due to an innovative approach to [[Mainstream#In music|mainstream]] pop music. The group has become one of the few UK reality television acts to achieve continued success, amassing a fortune of [[£]]30&amp;nbsp;million by May 2010. ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' lists them as &quot;Most Successful Reality TV Group&quot; in the 2007 edition. They also hold the record for &quot;Most Consecutive Top Ten Entries in the UK by a Female Group&quot; in the 2008 edition, and are credited again for &quot;Most Successful Reality TV Group&quot; in the 2011 edition. In 2012 Girls Aloud have been named the biggest selling girl group of the 21st century by the &quot;Offical Charts Company&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/girls-aloud-crowned-the-biggest-selling-girl-group-of-the-21st-century-1652/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===2002: Formation and ''Popstars: The Rivals''===
{{Main|Popstars: The Rivals}}
Girls Aloud were formed on 30 November 2002, in front of millions of viewers on the ITV1 programme ''[[Popstars: The Rivals]]''. The concept of the programme, hosted by ''[[Big Brother (UK)|Big Brother]]'' presenter [[Davina McCall]] was to produce a [[boy band|boyband]] and a [[girl group|girlgroup]] who would be &quot;rivals&quot; and compete for the 2002 Christmas number one single. Following the initial success of [[Hear'Say]] (winners of the original ''Popstars'' show), several thousand applicants attended auditions across the UK in hope of being selected. Ten girls and ten boys were chosen as finalists by judges [[Pete Waterman]], [[Louis Walsh]] and Spice Girls member [[Geri Halliwell]]. However, two of these were disqualified before the live shows began: Hazel Kaneswaren was found to be too old to participate&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.showbizireland.com/news/october02/02-kaneswarren02.shtml | title=Hazel is no longer a Popstar Rival... | publisher=ShowBiz Ireland | date=10 October 2002 | accessdate=20 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Nicola Ward]] refused to sign the contract, claiming the pay the group would receive was too low.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/tv_film/newsid_2324000/2324519.stm | title=Popstar Rivals' Nicola quits show | publisher=[[CBBC Newsround]]'' | date=13 October 2002 | accessdate=20 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kimberley Walsh]] and [[Nicola Roberts]], who had made it into the final fifteen but not the final ten, were chosen as their replacements.

During October and November, the finalists took to the stage participating in weekly Saturday night live performances (alternating week-by-week between the girls and boys). Each week the contestant polling the fewest phone votes was eliminated, until the final line-ups of the groups emerged. The five girls who made it into the group were (in the order announced by the host) Cheryl, Nicola, Nadine, Kimberley and Sarah; [[Javine Hylton]] missed out on a place in the group, despite previous expectations that she would be placed in the line-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2532667.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Popstars 'vote blunder' denied | date=2 December 2002 | accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was named Girls Aloud and were managed by Louis Walsh &lt;!-- given that one of the band members has the surname &quot;Walsh&quot;, care is needed to distinguish which &quot;Walsh&quot; is meant --&gt; until 2005 when Hilary Shaw replaced him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/x_factor/article71381.ece | location=London | work=The Sun | first=Derek | last=Robins | title=Sarahs dig at Louis | date=17 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The two groups competed to become 2002's [[Christmas number-one singles in the UK|Christmas number one]] single. Girls Aloud won the battle with their single &quot;[[Sound of the Underground (song)|Sound of the Underground]]&quot;, produced by [[Brian Higgins (producer)|Brian Higgins]] and [[Xenomania]]. The song spent four consecutive weeks at number one and was certified platinum in March 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chartstats.com/songinfo.php?id=30515 | title=Sound of the Underground | work=ChartStats.com | accessdate=28 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&amp;r_id=30821 | title=Certified Awards – Sound of the Underground | work=[[British Phonographic Industry]] | date=14 March 2003 | accessdate=24 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The song received critical acclaim; Alexis Petridis of ''[[The Guardian]]'' stated that &quot;it proved a first: it was a reality pop record that didn't make you want to do physical harm to everyone involved in its manufacture&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2003/may/23/popandrock.artsfeatures1 | title=Girls Aloud: Sound of the Underground | author=Alexis Petridis |work=The Guardian |location=UK | publisher=Guardian Media Group | date=23 May 2003 | accessdate=28 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2002–05: ''Sound of the Underground'' and ''What Will the Neighbours Say?''===
After the success of their first single &quot;Sound of the Underground&quot;, Girls Aloud spent five months recording the follow-up single and their debut album. ''[[Sound of the Underground (Girls Aloud album)|Sound of the Underground]]'' was completed in April 2003 and released the following month, described as a mix of &quot;Blondie and Bananarama, with a smattering of the Spice Girls at their best thrown in.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.digitalspy.com/popstars/a11004/girls-aloud-prepare-for-album-release.html | title=Girls Aloud prepare for album release | author=Neil Wilkes | work=[[Digital Spy]] | publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi Médias]] | date=30 April 2003 | accessdate=31 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album entered the charts at number two and was certified platinum by the [[British Phonographic Industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&amp;r_id=32027 | title=Certified Awards – Sound of the Underground (Platinum) | publisher=[[British Phonographic Industry]] | date=28 November 2003 | accessdate=24 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the tracks, &quot;Girls Allowed&quot;, was written for the group by ex-[[Westlife]] star [[Bryan McFadden]], while &quot;Some Kind of Miracle&quot; was co-written by former [[B*Witched]] member [[Edele Lynch]]. The second single, &quot;''[[No Good Advice]]''&quot;, was also released in May 2003 to similar success. Nadine Coyle said, &quot;We waited from December to May before releasing a second single because we knew it had to be our strong point or we might as well kiss our careers goodbye.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lipster&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thelipster.com/articles/3084395 | title=EXCLUSIVE: How Girls Aloud beat Louis Walsh at his own game | author=Sylvia Patterson | work=The Lipster | date=25 March 2008 | accessdate=27 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kimberley Walsh further exclaimed, &quot;We knew it was strong enough to come back with.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;lipster&quot;/&gt; Girls Aloud's third single, &quot;[[Life Got Cold (song)|Life Got Cold]]&quot;, charted at number three in August 2003.

In November 2003, Girls Aloud released a cover version of [[the Pointer Sisters]]' 1980s dance hit &quot;[[Jump (for My Love)#Girls Aloud version|Jump]]&quot;. The song appeared on the to the 2003 film ''[[Love Actually]]'', recorded at the request of director [[Richard Curtis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite album-notes |title=The Singles Boxset |artist=Girls Aloud |year=2009 |notestitle=Jump |first=Peter |last=Robinson |authorlink=Peter Robinson (journalist) |page=13 |format=Booklet |publisher=[[Fascination Records]] |location=London, England }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Cheryl Cole]] in Girls Aloud's 2008 autobiography ''[[Dreams That Glitter - Our Story]]'', the single &quot;was the point when we realised everything we'd been doing was quite down and moody [...] and that's not what people wanted.&quot; Nicola Roberts further stated it &quot;was meant to be. It was a turning point and everyone loved it.&quot; The single, which charted at number two, accompanied a new edition of ''Sound of the Underground''. The reissue featured a new album cover and the replacement of three original songs with &quot;Jump&quot;, &quot;You Freak Me Out&quot; (which appeared on the soundtrack of ''[[Freaky Friday (2003 film)|Freaky Friday]]'') and &quot;[[Girls on Film]]&quot; (a cover of a [[Duran Duran]] song originally a B-side to &quot;Life Got Cold&quot;).

After a brief hiatus, Girls Aloud released &quot;[[The Show (Girls Aloud song)|The Show]]&quot; in June 2004, the first single from ''[[What Will the Neighbours Say?]]'', the group's second album. It had an unusual structure for a pop song, consisting of a number of interchanged sections rather than the more typical [[verse-chorus form]]. Polydor built excitement for the release and the group's new look with a promotional campaign featuring five empty director's chairs with each of the girls' names on. &quot;The Show&quot; entered the charts at number two. The next single, &quot;[[Love Machine (Girls Aloud song)|Love Machine]]&quot;, also peaked at number two in September 2004. &quot;Love Machine&quot; was nominated for ITV's ''[[The Record of the Year]]'' and finished in sixth place. Girls Aloud recorded a cover of [[The Pretenders]]' &quot;[[I'll Stand by You#Girls Aloud version|I'll Stand by You]]&quot; as the official [[Children In Need]] charity single. The song was not well received by critics;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianwwtns&quot;&gt;{{ cite news | url= http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,11712,1359307,00.html | title=Girls Aloud, What Will The Neighbours Say? |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date=26 November 2004 | accessdate=7 May 2006  | first=Alexis | last=Petridis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.virginmedia.com/music/reviews/albumreviews/girlsaloud_whatwilltheneighbourssay.php | title=Girls Aloud – What Will The Neighbours Say? | work=[[Virgin Media]] | publisher=[[Virgin Group]] | accessdate=28 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/release/bwqv/ | title=Girls Aloud, What Will The Neighbours Say? | author=David Hooper | accessdate=28 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the cover became Girls Aloud's second number one single, holding the position for two weeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolpda/ukfs_news/hi/newsid_4030000/4030705.stm | title=Girls Aloud seize number one slot |publisher=BBC News  | date=21 November 2004 | accessdate=28 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theofficialcharts.com/all_singles_song.php?id=998 | title=Girls Aloud – I'll Stand By You | publisher=[[The Official UK Charts Company]] | date=27 November 2004 |  accessdate=28 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''What Will the Neighbours Say?'' was entirely written and produced by [[Xenomania]]. Higgins said, &quot;The pressure to come up with singles was, as always, immense. But [...] we were able to have a lot of fun working on ideas that were maybe a little too odd to be on the radio.&quot; The album received favourable reviews from music critics and was a commercial success, a feat in itself considering Girls Aloud's reality television background. A review by [[entertainment.ie]]'s Andrew Lynch said, &quot;Girls Aloud really shouldn't have made it as far as a second album. [...] There's just one problem – the girls have a knack of coming up with utterly infectious pop songs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://entertainment.ie/album-review/Girls-Aloud---What-Will-the-Neighbours-Say?/3611.htm | title=Girls Aloud – What Will the Neighbours Say? | author=Andrew Lynch |work=The Irish Times  | date=6 December 2004 | accessdate=30 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Guardian'' hailed ''Neighbours'' as &quot;a great album: funny, clever, immediate, richly inventive.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianwwtns&quot;/&gt; ''[[Stylus Magazine]]'' declared, &quot;There is no pop in the world like Girls Aloud today.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.stylusmagazine.com/review.php?ID=2592 | title=Girls Aloud – What Will The Neighbours Say? | author=William B. Swygart | work=[[Stylus Magazine]] | publisher=Todd Burns | date=13 December 2004 | accessdate=30 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its release on 29 November 2004, the album charted just outside of the top five and was quickly certified platinum.

The final single from the album, &quot;[[Wake Me Up (song)|Wake Me Up]]&quot;, was released in February 2005. It charted at number four, making it their first to miss the top three but still their eighth top-five single.
