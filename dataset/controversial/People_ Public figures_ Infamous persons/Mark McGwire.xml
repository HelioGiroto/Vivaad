'''Mark David McGwire''' (born October 1, 1963), nicknamed '''&quot;Big Mac&quot;''', is an American former professional baseball player who played his [[Major League Baseball|major league]] career with the [[Oakland Athletics]] and the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BaseballRefMain&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/m/mcgwima01.shtml Mark McGwire Statistics - Baseball-Reference.com]&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently the [[hitting coach]] for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].

For his career, McGwire averaged a home run once every 10.61 at bats, the best [[at bats per home run]] ratio in baseball history ([[Babe Ruth]] is second at 11.76).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/ABpHR_career.shtml Career Leaders &amp; Records for At Bats per Home Run - Baseball-Reference.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1987 in baseball|1987]], he broke the single-season [[home run]] record for [[rookie]]s, with 49. In [[1998 in baseball|1998]], McGwire and [[Sammy Sosa]] achieved national fame for their home run-hitting prowess [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|in pursuit of Roger Maris' single season home run record]]; McGwire broke the record and hit 70 home runs that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/HR_progress.shtml Progressive Leaders &amp; Records for Home Runs - Baseball-Reference.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barry Bonds]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=1937594 &quot;Bonds testified that substances didn't work&quot;, ESPN.com, December 4, 2004, accessed 02/03/11]&lt;/ref&gt; now holds the record, after hitting 73 home runs during the 2001 season. In 2010, McGwire publicly admitted to using performance-enhancing drugs throughout his career.

==Playing career==
===Oakland Athletics (1984–97)===
After three years at Southern California and a stint on the 1984 U.S. Olympic team, McGwire was drafted 10th overall by the [[Oakland Athletics]] in the [[1984 Major League Baseball Draft]].

McGwire made the major leagues in August. As a rookie in 1987 he hit 33 homers before the All-Star break and was a unanimous choice for AL Rookie of the Year after finishing with 49 homers, 118 RBI and a .289 average. His 49 longballs smashed the old rookie record of 38, jointly held by [[Frank Robinson]] and [[Wally Berger]]. He sat out the season's final two games and gave up a chance at 50 home runs to be present at the birth of his first child.

McGwire worked hard on his defense at first base and resisted being seen as a one-dimensional player. He was regarded as a good fielder in his early years, even winning a [[Gold Glove]] in [[1990 in baseball|1990]], the only one not won by [[Don Mattingly]] between {{By|1985}} and {{By|1994}}. In later years, his mobility decreased and, with it, his defense.

McGwire's total of 363 home runs with the Athletics surpassed the previous franchise record. He was selected or voted to nine [[American League]] All-Star Teams while playing for the A's, including six consecutive appearances from [[1987 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1987]] through [[1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1992]]. He was one of only four players to hit a ball over the roof in the left field of [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;The Final Season, p.90, Tom Stanton, Thomas Dunne Books, An imprint of St. Martin’s Press, New York, NY, 2001, ISBN 0-312-29156-6&lt;/ref&gt;

====1987–91====
In his first full Major League season in [[1987 Oakland Athletics season|1987]], McGwire hit 49 home runs, a single-season record for a rookie, surpassing [[Al Rosen]]'s AL rookie record;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/APAB/lib00581,122CA98E1CEF7498.html|date=August 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was named the American League Rookie of the Year. McGwire hit 32, 33, and 39 homers the next three seasons, the first Major Leaguer to hit 30+ home runs in each of his first 4 full seasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;BaseballRefMain&quot; /&gt; On July 3 and 4, [[1988 Oakland Athletics season|1988]], McGwire hit game-winning home runs in the 16th inning of each game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/TOR/TOR198807030.shtml July 3, 1988 Oakland Athletics at Toronto Blue Jays Play by Play and Box Score - Baseball-Reference.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CLE/CLE198807040.shtml July 4, 1988 Oakland Athletics at Cleveland Indians Play by Play and Box Score - Baseball-Reference.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Through May 2009 McGwire was tied for third all-time with [[Joe DiMaggio]] in home runs over his first two calendar years in the major leagues (71), behind [[Chuck Klein]] (83) and [[Ryan Braun]] (79).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalpost.com/sports/story.html?id=1633915 Sandler, Jeremy, &quot;NL Weekly: The Notebook,&quot; National Post, May 27, 2009, accessed 5/28/09]&lt;/ref&gt;

But McGwire's most famous home run with the A's was likely his game-winning solo shot in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 3 of the [[1988 World Series]] against the [[1988 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles Dodgers]] and former A's closer [[Jay Howell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/OAK/OAK198810180.shtml October 18, 1988 World Series Game 3 at Network Associates Coliseum Play by Play and Box Score - Baseball-Reference.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; McGwire's game-winner brought the A's their only victory in the 1988 World Series, which they lost in five games. However, Big Mac and his fellow Bash Brother [[José Canseco]] did play a large part in the 1989 World Champion A's team that defeated the [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] in the famous &quot;[[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake|Earthquake Series]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1989_WS.shtml 1989 World Series - OAK vs. SFG - Baseball-Reference.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

McGwire's batting average, .289 as a rookie, plummeted over the next three seasons to .260, .231, and .235, respectively. In [[1991 in baseball|1991]], he bottomed out with a .201 average and 22 homers. Manager [[Tony LaRussa]] sat him out the last game of the [[1991 Oakland Athletics season|season]] so his average could not dip below .200. Despite the declining [[batting average]]s during this time of his career, his high [[bases on balls]] totals allowed him to maintain acceptable [[on-base percentage]]s. In fact, when he hit .201, his adjusted OPS (OPS+) was 103, or just over league average.

McGwire stated in an interview with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' that 1991 was the &quot;worst year&quot; of his life, with his on-field performance and marriage difficulties, and that he &quot;didn't lift a weight&quot; that entire season. With all that behind him, McGwire re-dedicated himself to working out harder than ever and received visual therapy from a sports vision specialist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sdccd.edu/events/we/wepdf/we-sp99.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/features/mcgwire/flashbacks/060192/|work=CNN|accessdate=May 12, 2010|title=Oakland's Mark McGwire is smiling again, now that he's hitting homers at a record pace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1992–97====
He changed his clean-cut  look and grew a [[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]], a [[mustache]], and a [[goatee]] to look more fearsome. The &quot;new look&quot; McGwire hit 42 homers and batted .268 in [[1992 in baseball|1992]], with an outstanding OPS+ of 175 (the highest of his career to that point), and put on a home run hitting show at the [[Home Run Derby]] during the [[1992 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1992 All-Star break]]. His performance propelled the [[1992 Oakland Athletics season|A's]] to the American League West Division title in 1992, their fourth in five seasons. The A's lost in the [[1992 American League Championship Series|playoffs]] to the eventual [[1992 World Series|World Series]] champion, the [[1992 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto Blue Jays]].

Foot injuries limited McGwire to a total of 74 games in [[1993 Oakland Athletics season|1993]] and [[1994 Oakland Athletics season|1994]], and just 9 home runs in each of the two seasons. He played just 104 games in [[1995 Oakland Athletics season|1995]], but his proportional totals were much improved: 39 home runs in 317 at-bats. In [[1996 Oakland Athletics season|1996]], McGwire belted a major league leading 52 homers in 423 at-bats. He also hit a career high .312 average, and led the league in both slugging percentage and on base percentage.

===St. Louis Cardinals and the HR record chase (1997–2001)===
[[File:Mark mcgwire.jpg|250px|thumb|McGwire batting for the Cardinals.]]
On July 31, having already amassed 34 home runs to this point in the [[1997 in baseball|1997 season]], McGwire was traded from the [[1997 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] to the [[1997 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]], being the third member in just two seasons to go from Oakland to St. Louis (after [[Tony La Russa]] and [[Dennis Eckersley]]). He led the majors with 58 home runs in 1997. In the last year of his contract, there was speculation that McGwire would play for the Cardinals only for the remainder of the season, then seek a long-term deal, possibly in Southern California, where he still lives. However, McGwire signed a contract to stay in St. Louis instead. It is also believed that McGwire later encouraged [[Jim Edmonds]], another Southern California resident who was traded to St. Louis, to forgo free agency and sign a contract with the Cardinals in 2000.

As the [[1998 St. Louis Cardinals season|1998]] season progressed, it became clear that McGwire, [[Ken Griffey Jr.]], and [[1998 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] [[outfielder]] [[Sammy Sosa]] were all on track to break [[Roger Maris|Roger Maris']] single-season home run record. [[1998 Major League Baseball home run record chase|The race to break the record]] first attracted media attention as the home run leader changed often throughout the season. On August 19, Sosa hit his 48th home run to move ahead of McGwire. However, later that day McGwire hit his 48th and 49th home runs to regain the lead.

On September 8, 1998, McGwire hit a pitch by the Cubs' [[Steve Trachsel]] over the left field wall for his record-breaking 62nd home run, setting off huge celebrations at [[Busch Memorial Stadium|Busch Stadium]]. The fact that the game was against the Cubs meant that Sosa was able to congratulate McGwire personally on his achievement. Members of Roger Maris' family were also present at the game. The ball was freely, albeit controversially, given to McGwire in a ceremony on the field by the stadium worker who found it.

McGwire finished the 1998 season with 70 home runs (including five in his last three games), four ahead of Sosa's 66, a record that was broken three seasons later in 2001 by [[Barry Bonds]] with 73.

McGwire was honored with the inaugural [[Babe Ruth Home Run Award]] for leading MLB in home runs.&lt;ref name=harber&gt;{{cite new|last=Harber|first=Paul|title=A statue fit for a home run king|date=July 22, 2001|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8659756.html|accessdate=November 8, 2011|quote=The first award was given to Mark McGwire after his 70-home-run season in 1998.}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although McGwire had the prestige of the home run record, Sammy Sosa (who had fewer HR but more RBI and stolen bases) won the 1998 NL MVP award, as his contributions helped propel the Cubs to the [[1998 National League Division Series|playoffs]] (the [[1998 St. Louis Cardinals season|Cardinals]] in 1998 finished third in the NL Central). Many credited the Sosa-McGwire home run chase in 1998 with &quot;saving baseball,&quot; by both bringing in new, younger fans and bringing back old fans soured by the [[1994 Major League Baseball strike]] {{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}.

====1999–2001====
In [[1999 St. Louis Cardinals season|1999]], McGwire hit 66 home runs and drove in a league-leading 147 runs while only having 145 hits, the highest RBI-per-hit tally for a season in baseball history. Sammy Sosa, hitting 63 home runs, again closely trailed McGwire.

Statistically in 2000 and 2001, McGwire's numbers declined relative to previous years as McGwire struggled to avoid injury (32 HR in 89 games, and 29 HR in 97 games, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/m/mcgwima01.shtml Baseball-reference.om McGwire stats]&lt;/ref&gt;

McGwire ended his career with 583 home runs, which was then fifth-most in history. He led Major League Baseball in home runs five times. He hit 50 or more home runs four seasons in a row ([[1996 in baseball|1996]]–[[1999 in baseball|1999]]), leading Major League Baseball in homers all four seasons, and also shared the MLB lead in home runs in [[1987 in baseball|1987]], his rookie year, when he set the Major League record for home runs by a rookie with 49. McGwire had the fewest career triples (6) of any player with 5,000 or more at-bats.

==Coaching career==
On October 26, 2009, Tony LaRussa confirmed that McGwire will become the [[Coach (baseball)|hitting coach]] for the Cardinals, replacing [[Hal McRae]] as the fifth hitting coach in [[Tony LaRussa]]'s term as manager.

On January 7, 2010 Tony LaRussa mentioned that he might consider putting McGwire in the lineup as a pinch-hitter on August 31, should the Cardinals be in contention to make the playoffs, but LaRussa admitted it was a dream and he was only kidding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100107&amp;content_id=7887624&amp;vkey=news_stl&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=stl|title=McGwire to speak, but date not set: Cards GM hopeful new hitting coach will appear soon|publisher=MLB.com|date=2010-01-07|accessdate=2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGwire received a standing ovation prior to the Cardinals home opener on April 12, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news;_ylt=AjP3IcZXdVWvfZt.c6hW8uYRvLYF?slug=ap-cardinals-mcgwire]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors==
In [[1999 in baseball|1999]], ''[[The Sporting News]]'' released a list of the 100 Greatest Baseball Players. The list had been compiled during the [[1998 in baseball|1998]] season and included statistics through the [[1997 in baseball|1997]] season. McGwire was ranked at Number 91. That year, he was elected to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]] (though he received fewer votes than any other selected player). In 2005, ''[[The Sporting News]]'' published an update of their list and McGwire had been moved up to Number 84.

However, in the [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2007|2007]], [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2008|2008]], [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2009|2009]], [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2010|2010]], [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2011|2011]], and [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2012|2012]] balloting for the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]], McGwire failed to attain election receiving 128 of the 545 cast (23.5% of the vote) in 2007, 128 of 543 (23.6%) in 2008, 118 of 539 (21.9%) in 2009, 128 of 539 (23.7%) in 2010, 115 of 581 (19.8%) in 2011, and 112 of 573 (19.5%) in 2012.

A portion of [[Interstate 70#Missouri|Interstate 70]] (see also: [[Interstate 70 in Missouri#St. Louis|Interstate 70 in Missouri]]) in St. Louis and near Busch Stadium was named &quot;Mark McGwire Highway&quot; to honor his 70 home run achievement, along with his various good works for the city. In May, 2010, St. Louis politicians succeeded in passing a state bill to change the name of &quot;Mark McGwire Highway&quot;, a 5-mile stretch of Interstate 70, to &quot;Mark Twain Highway&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10187/1070716-63.stm|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|first=J. Brady|last=McCollough|title=McGwire learning the 'art of coaching' as hitting instructor with the Cardinals|date=July 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steroid use==

In a 1998 article by ''[[Associated Press]]'' writer [[Steve Wilstein]], McGwire admitted to taking [[androstenedione]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Who Knew? |work=ESPN.com |page= |date=11-9-2005|accessdate=12-22-2010 |quote= |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/eticket/story?page=steroids&amp;num=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; an over-the-counter muscle enhancement product that had already been banned by the [[World Anti-Doping Agency]], the [[National Football League|NFL]] and the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]].  At the time, however, use of the substance was not prohibited by [[Major League Baseball]] and it was not federally classified as an anabolic steroid in the United States until 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=108_cong_bills&amp;docid=f:s2195enr.txt.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jose Canseco]] released a book, ''[[Juiced: Wild Times, Rampant 'Roids, Smash Hits &amp; How Baseball Got Big]]'', in which he wrote positively about steroids and made various claims—among them, that McGwire had used performance enhancing drugs since the 1980s and that Canseco had personally injected him with them.

In 2005, McGwire and Canseco were among 11 baseball players and executives subpoenaed to testify at a congressional hearing on steroids. During his testimony on March 17, 2005, McGwire declined to answer questions under oath when he appeared before the [[House Government Reform Committee]].  In a tearful opening statement, McGwire said:

{{cquote|Asking me or any other player to answer questions about who took [[steroids]] in front of television cameras will not solve the problem. If a player answers 'No,' he simply will not be believed; if he answers 'Yes,' he risks public scorn and endless government investigations....My lawyers have advised me that I cannot answer these questions without jeopardizing my friends, my family, and myself. I will say, however, that it remains a fact in this country that a man, any man, should be regarded as innocent unless proven guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/ALLPOLITICS/03/17/steroids.baseball/ |work=CNN | date=March 18, 2005 | accessdate=May 12, 2010 | title=CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
On January 11, 2010, McGwire admitted to [[Banned substances in baseball in the United States|using steroids]] on and off for a decade and said, &quot;I wish I had never touched steroids. It was foolish and it was a mistake. I truly apologize. Looking back, I wish I had never played during the steroid era.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ESPNAdmission&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4816607|title=McGwire admits steroids use|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He admitted using them in the 1989/90 offseason and then after he was injured in 1993. He admitted using them on occasion throughout the '90s, including during the 1998 season. McGwire said that he used steroids to recover from injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100122&amp;content_id=7955290&amp;vkey=news_mlb&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=mlb|title=Steroid supplier disputes McGwire's motive|publisher=MLB.com|date=2010-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGwire's decision to admit using steroids was prompted by his decision to become hitting coach of the St. Louis Cardinals. According to McGwire, he took steroids for health reasons rather than to improve performance; however, a drug dealer who claimed to have provided steroids to McGwire asserted that his use was to improve his size and strength, rather than to just maintain his health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20100111&amp;content_id=7900244&amp;vkey=news_stl&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=stl|title=McGwire admits to steroid use: Will appear on MLB Network tonight to discuss admission|publisher=MLB.com|date=2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
