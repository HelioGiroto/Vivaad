'''Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin''' ({{Lang-rus|Бори́с Никола́евич Е́льцин|a=ru-Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin.ogg|p=bɐˈrʲis nʲɪkɐˈlaɪvʲɪtɕ ˈjelʲtsɨn}}; 1&amp;nbsp;February 1931{{spaced ndash}}23 April 2007) was a Russian politician and the first [[President of Russia|President]] of the [[Russia|Russian Federation]], serving from 1991 to 1999.

Originally a supporter of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], Yeltsin emerged under the [[perestroika]] reforms as one of Gorbachev's most powerful political opponents. On 29 May 1990 he was elected the chairman of the [[Russian Supreme Soviet]]. On 12 June 1991 he was elected by popular vote to the newly created post of President of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (SFSR), at that time one of the 15 constituent republics of the Soviet Union. He won 57% of the vote in a six-candidate contest and became the third democratically elected leader of Russia in history. Upon the resignation of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and the final [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]] on 25 December 1991, Yeltsin remained in office as the President of the Russian Federation, the USSR's [[successor state]]. Yeltsin was reelected in the [[Russian presidential election, 1996|1996 election]]; in the second round of the election Yeltsin defeated [[Gennady Zyuganov]] from the revived [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party]] by a margin of 13%. However, Yeltsin never recovered his early popularity after a series of economic and political crises in Russia in the 1990s.

He vowed to transform Russia's [[economy of the Soviet Union|socialist command economy]] into a free [[market economy]] and implemented [[shock therapy (economics)|economic shock therapy]], price liberalization and [[privatization in Russia|privatization programs]]. Due to the method of privatization, a good deal of the national wealth fell into the hands of a small group of [[Russian oligarch|oligarch]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Åslund|first=Anders|authorlink=Anders Åslund|title=Russia's Collapse|work=[[Foreign Affairs]] |publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|date=September/October 1999|accessdate=17 July 2007|url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19990901faessay1007/anders-aslund/russia-s-collapse.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Yeltsin era was marked by widespread corruption, inflation, [[economic collapse]] and enormous political and social problems that affected Russia and the other former states of the USSR. Within the first few years of his presidency, many of Yeltsin's political supporters turned against him and Vice President [[Alexander Rutskoy]] denounced the reforms as &quot;economic genocide&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Yeltsin Deputy calls reforms Economic Genocide|published=[[New York Times]]|date=February 1992|accessdate=23 September 2011|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/02/09/world/yeltsin-deputy-calls-reforms-economic-genocide.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|work=The New York Times|first=Celestine|last=Bohlen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ongoing confrontations with the Supreme Soviet climaxed in the [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993|October 1993 Russian constitutional crisis]] in which Yeltsin illegally ordered the dissolution of the parliament, which then attempted to remove Yeltsin from office. The military eventually sided with Yeltsin and besieged and shelled the [[Russian White House]], resulting in the deaths of 187 people. Yeltsin then scrapped the [[Russian Constitution of 1978|existing constitution]], temporarily banned political opposition and deepened his economic experimentation. He then introduced a [[Constitution of Russia|new constitution]] with stronger presidential power and it was approved by [[Russian constitutional referendum, 1993|referendum]] on 12 December 1993 with 58.5% of voters in favour.

On 31 December 1999, Yeltsin made a surprise announcement of his resignation, leaving the presidency in the hands of his chosen successor, then-Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]]. Yeltsin left office widely unpopular with the Russian population.&lt;ref&gt;Paul J. Saunders, &quot;U.S. Must Ease Away From Yeltsin&quot;, ''Newsday'', 14 May 1999. [http://www.nixoncenter.org/publications/articles/pjs-newsday.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; By some estimates, his approval ratings when leaving office were as low as 2%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Transcripts of 'Insight' on CNN|publisher=CNN|date=7 October 2002|accessdate=17 July 2007|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0210/07/i_ins.01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Boris Yeltsin was born in the village of Butka, in [[Talitsky District]] of [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]], [[Russian SFSR]] on 1 February 1931.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leon Aron 2000. page 739&quot;&gt;Leon Aron, ''Boris Yeltsin A Revolutionary Life''. Harper Collins, 2000. page 739.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932 after the state took away the entire harvest from the recently collectivised Butka peasants the Yeltsin family moved as far away as they could, to Kazan which was over 1,100 kilometres from Butka, where Boris` father, Nikolai Yeltsin, got work on a construction site.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Aron, ''Boris Yeltsin A Revolutionary Life''. Harper Collins, 2000. page 5.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934 Nikolai Yeltsin was convicted of [[Article 58 (RSFSR Penal Code)|anti-Soviet agitation]] and sentenced to hard labour in a [[gulag]] for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/newsinreview/oct98/russia/timeline.htm|title=Timeline of a Leader|publisher=[[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]]|month=October | year=1998|accessdate=17 April 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071016142813/http://cbc.ca/newsinreview/oct98/russia/timeline.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 16 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his release in 1936 after serving two years, Nikolai took his family to live in [[Berezniki]] in [[Perm Krai]] where his brother Ivan a blacksmith had been exiled the year before for failing to deliver his grain quota.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Aron, ''Boris Yeltsin A Revolutionary Life''. Harper Collins, 2000. page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Nikolai remained unemployed for a period of time and then worked again in construction. His mother, Klavdiya Vasilyevna Yeltsina, worked as a seamstress.

Boris Yeltsin studied at [[Pushkin High School]] in [[Berezniki]] in [[Perm Krai]]. He was fond of sports (in particular [[skiing]], gymnastics, volleyball, track and field, [[boxing]] and [[wrestling]]) despite losing the thumb and index finger of his left hand when he and some friends snuck into a [[Red Army]] supply depot, stole several grenades, and tried to disassemble them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/magazinemonitor/2007/04/10_things_we_didnt_know_last_w_21.shtml|title=10 things we didn't know last week|publisher=BBC |date=27 April 2007|accessdate=29 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1949 Yeltsin was admitted to the [[Ural State Technical University|Ural Polytechnic Institute]] in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]], majoring in construction, and he graduated in 1955. The subject of his degree paper was &quot;[[television tower|Television Tower]]&quot;.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

From 1955 to 1957 he worked as a foreman with the building trust Uraltyazhtrubstroy. From 1957 to 1963 he worked in Sverdlovsk, and was promoted from construction site superintendent to chief of the Construction Directorate with the Yuzhgorstroy Trust. In 1963 he became chief engineer, and in 1965 head of the Sverdlovsk House-Building Combine, responsible for sewerage and technical plumbing. He joined the ranks of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]] ''[[nomenklatura]]'' in 1968 when he was appointed head of construction with the Sverdlovsk Regional Party Committee. In 1975 he became secretary of the regional committee in charge of the region's industrial development. In 1976 the [[Politburo of the CPSU]] promoted him to the post of the first secretary of the CPSU Committee of [[Sverdlovsk Oblast]] (effectively he became the head of one of the most important industrial regions in the USSR), he remained in this position until 1985.

==Communist Party Member==
Yeltsin was a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU) from 17 March 1961&lt;ref&gt;Leon Aron, ''Boris Yeltsin A Revolutionary Life''. Harper Collins, 2000. page 30.&lt;/ref&gt; to 13 July 1990,&lt;ref&gt;Leon Aron, ''Boris Yeltsin A Revolutionary Life''. Harper Collins, 2000. page 740.&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[nomenklatura]] member from 1968. 

In 1977 as a party official in [[Yekaterinburg|Sverdlovsk]], Yeltsin was—on orders from Moscow—ordered to execute the order to destroy the [[Ipatiev House]] where the [[Nicholas II of Russia|last Russian tsar]] had been killed by [[Bolshevik]] troops. The [[Ipatiev House]] was demolished in one night, 27 July 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.searchfoundationinc.org/Chronology.html |title=Chronology |publisher=Searchfoundationinc.org |accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also during Yeltsin's time in Sverdlovsk, a CPSU palace was built which was named &quot;White Tooth&quot; by the residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.panorama.ru/works/oe/yeltsine.html |title=Yeltsin Boris Nikolayevich |publisher=Panorama.ru |accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Yeltsin developed connections with key people in the Soviet power structure.  In January 1981 Yeltsin was awarded the [[Order of Lenin]], the Soviet Union`s highest medal, for 'the service to the Communist Party and the Soviet State and in connection with the 50th birthday'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leon Aron 2000. page 739&quot;/&gt;  In March 1981 Yeltsin was `elected` Full Member of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Leon Aron 2000. page 739&quot;/&gt;

==Moscow==
On 11 March 1985 [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] was elected General Secretary of the CPSU by the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] after the death of [[Konstantin Chernenko]]. Gorbachev's primary goal was to revive the [[Soviet economy]] however he soon realized that fixing the Soviet economy would be nearly impossible without reforming the political and social structure of the Communist nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/ussr/ussr_state/gorbachev.php|title=Михаил Сергеевич Горбачёв (Mikhail Sergeyevičh Gorbačhëv)|accessdate=3 April 2009|date=27 March 2009|publisher=Archontology.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; To begin these reforms he immediately began gathering in Moscow a younger and more energetic governing team of Communist Party members.  On 4 April 1985 Yeltsin received a call from Gorbachev's leading protege [[Yegor Ligachev]] summoning him to Moscow to take up position as Head of the Construction Department of the Party`s Central Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Aron, ''Boris Yeltsin A Revolutionary Life''. Harper Collins, 2000. page 132.&lt;/ref&gt;  Less than three months later he was promoted to be Secretary for Construction of the Central Committee a position within the powerful [[Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU Central Committee Secretariat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Leon Aron 2000. page 739&quot;/&gt;

On 23 December 1985 [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] appointed Yeltsin [[First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party]] effectively `Mayor' of the Soviet capital, and as a result on 18 February 1986 Yeltsin was invited to become a Candidate (ie.non-voting) Member of the [[Politburo of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Politburo]] &lt;!-- ref name=&quot;StrangeDeath77&quot;&gt;''The Strange Death of the Soviet Empire'', page 77; ISBN 0-8050-4154-0&lt;/ref --&gt;. As a politburo member Yeltsin was also given a country house ([[dacha]]), his was previously occupied by Gorbachev who now moved to a much bigger and more luxurious purpose built dacha nearby. During this period Yeltsin portrayed himself as a reformer and [[Populism|populist]] (for example, he took a [[trolleybus]] to work), firing and reshuffling his staff several times. He became popular among Moscow residents for firing corrupt Moscow party officials.

==Rebel==
On September 10, 1987, after a lecture from hard-liner [[Yegor Ligachev]] at the Politburo for allowing two small unsanctioned demonstrations on Moscow streets, Yeltsin wrote a letter of resignation to Gorbachev who was holidaying on the Black Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Page 71 O'Clery, Conor.  ''Moscow December 25, 1991: The Last Day of the Soviet Union''. Transworld Ireland (2011). ISBN 978-1-84827-112-8&lt;/ref&gt; When Gorbachev received the letter he was stunned – nobody in Soviet history had voluntarily resigned from the ranks of the Politburo. Gorbachev phoned Yeltsin and asked him to reconsider. On October 27, 1987 at the plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|CPSU]], Yeltsin, frustrated that Gorbachev had not addressed any of the issues outlined in his resignation letter asked to speak. He expressed his discontent with both the slow pace of reform in society, the servility shown to the General Secretary, and opposition to him from Ligachev making his position untenable, before requesting to resign from the Politburo, adding that the City Committee would decide whether he should resign from the post of [[First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party]].&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Clery, Conor 2011&quot;&gt;Page 74 O'Clery, Conor.  ''Moscow December 25, 1991: The Last Day of the Soviet Union''. Transworld Ireland (2011). ISBN 978-1-84827-112-8&lt;/ref&gt; This was sensational.  Besides the fact that nobody had ever quit the Politburo, no one in the party had ever had the audacity to address a leader of the party in such a manner in front of the Central Committee since Leon Trotsky in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Clery, Conor 2011&quot;/&gt; In his reply, Gorbachev accused Yeltsin of &quot;political immaturity&quot; and &quot;absolute irresponsibility&quot;. Nobody in the Central Committee backed Yeltsin. 

Within days news of Yeltsin's actions leaked and rumours of his 'secret speech' at the Central Committee spread throughout Moscow.  Soon fabricated ''[[samizdat]]''  versions began to circulate – this was the beginning of Yeltsin's rise as a rebel and  growth in popularity as an anti-establishment figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/world/critic-of-gorbachev-offers-to-resign-his-moscow-party-post.html?scp=4&amp;sq=Yeltsin&amp;st=nyt | work=The New York Times | first=Bill | last=Keller | title=CRITIC OF GORBACHEV OFFERS TO RESIGN HIS MOSCOW PARTY POST | date=1 November 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gorbachev called a meeting of the Moscow City Party Committee for the November 11, 1987 to launch another crushing attack on Yeltsin and confirm his dismissal. On November 9, 1987 Yeltsin apparently tried to kill himself and was rushed to hospital bleeding profusely from self-inflicted cuts to his chest. Gorbachev ordered the injured Yeltsin from his hospital bed to the Moscow party plenum two days later where he was ritually denounced by the party faithful in what was reminiscent of a Stalinist show trial before he was fired from the post of [[First Secretary of the Moscow Communist Party]].  Yeltsin would never forgive Gorbachev for this 'immoral and inhuman' treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Page 81 O'Clery, Conor.  ''Moscow December 25, 1991: The Last Day of the Soviet Union''. Transworld Ireland (2011). ISBN 978-1-84827-112-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeltsin was demoted to the position of First Deputy Commissioner for the State Committee for Construction. At the next meeting of the Central Committee on February 24, 1988 Yeltsin was removed from his position as a Candidate member the Politburo. He was perturbed and humiliated but began plotting his revenge.&lt;ref name=&quot;StrangeDeath86&quot;&gt;''The Strange Death of the Soviet Empire'', page 86; ISBN 0-8050-4154-0&lt;/ref&gt; His opportunity came with Gorbachev's establishment of the [[Congress of People's Deputies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;StrangeDeath90&quot;&gt;''The Strange Death of the Soviet Empire'', page 90; ISBN 0-8050-4154-0&lt;/ref&gt; He recovered, and started intensively criticizing Gorbachev, highlighting the slow pace of reform in the Soviet Union as his major argument.

Yeltsin's criticism of the Politburo and Gorbachev led to a smear campaign against him, in which examples of Yeltsin's awkward behavior were used against him. An article published in ''[[Pravda]]'' described him as being drunk at a lecture during his visit to the United States, an allegation which appeared to be confirmed by a TV account of his speech. However, popular dissatisfaction with the regime was very strong, and these attempts to smear Yeltsin only added to his popularity. In another incident, Yeltsin fell from a bridge. Commenting on this event, Yeltsin hinted that he was helped to fall from the bridge by the enemies of [[perestroika]], but his opponents suggested that he was simply drunk.

On March 26, 1989, Yeltsin [[Soviet Union legislative election, 1989|was elected]] to the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union]] as the delegate from Moscow district with a hugely decisive 92% of the vote&lt;ref name=&quot;Leon Aron 2000. page 739&quot;/&gt; and on May 29, 1989 was elected by the [[Congress of People's Deputies]] to a seat on the [[Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Leon Aron 2000. page 739&quot;/&gt;  On July 19, 1989 Yeltsin announced the formation of the radical pro-reform faction in the [[Congress of People's Deputies]]: the Inter-Regional Group of Deputies, and on July 29, 1989 was elected one of the five co-Chairman of the Inter-Regional Group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leon Aron 2000. page 739&quot;/&gt;

==President of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic==

On 4 March 1990 Yeltsin was elected to the [[Congress of People's Deputies of Russia]] representing Sverdlovsk with 72% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Aron, ''Boris Yeltsin A Revolutionary Life''. Harper Collins, 2000. page 739-740.&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 May 1990, he was elected chairman of the [[Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR|Presidium of the Supreme Soviet]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (RSFSR), in spite of the fact that Gorbachev personally pleaded with the Russian deputies not to select Yeltsin. He was supported by both democratic and conservative members of the Supreme Soviet, which sought power in the developing political situation in the country. A part of this power struggle was the opposition between power structures of the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|RSFSR]]. In an attempt to gain more power, on 12 June 1990, the Congress of People's Deputies of the RSFSR adopted a declaration of sovereignty. On 12 July 1990, Yeltsin resigned from the CPSU in a dramatic speech before party members at the [[28th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]], some of whom responded by shouting &quot;Shame!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/july/12/newsid_4493000/4493177.stm |work=BBC News | title=1990: Yeltsin resignation splits Soviet Communists | date=12 July 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 June 1991, Yeltsin won 57% of the popular vote in the democratic [[Russian presidential election, 1991|presidential elections for the Russian republic]], defeating Gorbachev's preferred candidate, [[Nikolai Ryzhkov]] who got just 16% of the vote. In his election campaign, Yeltsin criticized the &quot;dictatorship of the center&quot;, but did not suggest the introduction of a market economy. Instead, he said that he would put his head on the railtrack in the event of increased prices. Yeltsin took office on 10 July, and reappointed [[Ivan Silayev]] as [[List of heads of government of the Soviet Union|Chairman]] of the [[Government of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Council of Ministers – Government]] of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]].

On 18 August 1991, a [[Soviet coup attempt of 1991|coup against Gorbachev]] was launched by the government members opposed to perestroika. Gorbachev was held in [[Crimea]] while Yeltsin raced to the [[White House of Russia]] (residence of the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR) in Moscow to defy the coup, making a memorable speech from atop the turret of a tank onto which he had climbed. The White House was surrounded by the military but the troops defected in the face of mass popular demonstrations. By 21 August most of the coup leaders had fled Moscow and Gorbachev was &quot;rescued&quot; from [[Crimea]] and then returned to Moscow. Yeltsin was subsequently hailed by his supporters around the world for rallying mass opposition to the coup.

Although restored to his position, Gorbachev had been destroyed politically. Neither union nor Russian power structures heeded his commands as support had swung over to Yeltsin.  Taking advantage of the situation, Yeltsin began taking what remained of the Soviet government, ministry by ministry—including the Kremlin.

On 6 November 1991, Yeltsin issued a decree banning all Communist Party activities on Russian soil.

In early December 1991, Ukraine voted for independence from the Soviet Union. A week later, on 8 December, Yeltsin met Ukrainian president [[Leonid Kravchuk]] and the leader of Belarus, [[Stanislav Shushkevich]], in [[Belovezhskaya Pushcha]].  In the [[Belavezha Accords]], the three presidents announced the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] and the formation of a voluntary [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) in its place. According to Gorbachev, Yeltsin kept the plans of the Belovezhskaya meeting in strict secrecy and the main goal of the dissolution of the Soviet Union was to get rid of Gorbachev, who by that time had started to recover his position after the events of August. Gorbachev has also accused Yeltsin of violating the people's will expressed in the referendum in which the majority voted to keep the Soviet Union united.

On 12 December, the Supreme Soviet of the RSFSR ratified the Belavezha Accords and denounced the 1922 [[Union Treaty]].  It also ordered the Russian deputies in the [[Soviet of the Union|Council of the Union]] to cease their work, leaving that body without a quorum.  In effect, the largest republic of the Soviet Union had seceded.

In a 17 December meeting with Yeltsin, Gorbachev accepted the ''fait accompli'' and agreed to dissolve the Soviet Union.  On 24 December, the Russian Federation, by mutual agreement of the other CIS states (which by this time included all of the remaining republics except Georgia) took the Soviet Union's seat in the United Nations. The next day, Gorbachev resigned and [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|the Soviet Union ceased to exist]]—thereby ending the world's oldest, largest and most powerful Communist state. Economic relations between the former Soviet republics were severely compromised. Millions of ethnic Russians found themselves in the newly formed foreign countries.

====Radical reforms====
{{Refimprove|date=November 2010}}
[[File:Russian economy since fall of Soviet Union.PNG|350px|thumb|Most of Yeltsin's time as president was plagued by economic contraction.]]
Just days after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Boris Yeltsin resolved to embark on a program of radical economic reform, with the aim of restructuring Russia's economic system—converting the world's largest command economy into a free-market one. During early discussions of this transition, Yeltsin's advisers debated issues of speed and sequencing, with an apparent division between those favoring a rapid approach and those favoring a gradual or slower approach.

In late 1991 Yeltsin turned to the advice of Western economists, and Western institutions such as the [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]], and the [[U.S. Treasury Department]], who had developed a standard policy recipe for transition economies in the late 1980s. This policy recipe came to be known as the &quot;[[Washington Consensus]]&quot; or &quot;[[shock therapy (economics)|shock therapy]]&quot;, a combination of measures intended to liberalize prices and stabilize the state's budget. Such measures had been attempted in Poland, and advocates of &quot;shock therapy&quot; felt the same could be done in Russia. Some Russian policymakers were skeptical that this was the way to go, but the approach was favored by Yeltsin's deputy, [[Yegor Gaidar]], a 35-year-old Russian economist inclined toward radical reform.

On 2 January 1992, Yeltsin, acting as his own [[Prime Minister of Russia|prime minister]], ordered the liberalization of [[foreign trade]], [[prices control|price]]s, and currency. At the same time, Yeltsin followed a policy of 'macroeconomic stabilization,' a harsh austerity regime designed to control inflation. Under Yeltsin's stabilization program, [[interest rate]]s were raised to extremely high levels to tighten [[Russian rouble|money]] and restrict [[credit]]. To bring state spending and revenues into balance, Yeltsin raised new taxes heavily, cut back sharply on government subsidies to industry and construction, and made steep cuts to state welfare spending.

In early 1992, prices skyrocketed throughout Russia, and a deep credit crunch shut down many industries and brought about a protracted depression. The reforms devastated the living standards of much of the population, especially the groups dependent on Soviet-era state subsidies and [[Welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] [[entitlement program]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Nolan 1995. pp. 17&quot;&gt;Peter Nolan, ''China's Rise, Russia's Fall''. Macmillan Press, 1995. pp. 17–18.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 1990s, Russia's GDP fell by 50 percent, vast sectors of the economy were wiped out, inequality and unemployment grew dramatically, while incomes fell. [[Hyperinflation]], caused by the [[Central Bank of Russia]]'s loose monetary policy, wiped out a lot of personal savings, and tens of millions of [[Russians]] were plunged into poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Treisman, &quot;Why Yeltsin Won: A Russian Tammany Hall&quot;, ''Foreign Affairs'', September/October 1996. [http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19960901faessay3402/daniel-treisman/why-yeltsin-won-a-russian-tammany-hall.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theodore P. Gerber, Michael Hout, &quot;More Shock than Therapy: Market Transition, Employment, and Income in Russia, 1991–1995&quot;, AJS Volume 104 Number 1 (July 1998): 1–50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some economists argue that in the 1990s Russia suffered an economic downturn more severe than the United States or Germany had undergone six decades earlier in the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Peter Nolan 1995. pp. 17&quot;/&gt; Russian commentators and even some Western economists, such as [[Marshall Goldman]], widely blamed Yeltsin's Western-backed economic program for the country's disastrous economic performance in the 1990s. Many politicians began to quickly distance themselves from the program. In February 1992, Russia's vice president, [[Alexander Rutskoy]] denounced the Yeltsin program as &quot;economic genocide.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Celestine Bohlen, &quot;Yeltsin Deputy Calls Reforms 'Economic Genocide,'&quot; ''[[The New York Times]]'', 9 February 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1993 conflict over the reform direction escalated between Yeltsin on the one side, and the opposition to radical economic reform in Russia's parliament on the other.

====Confrontation with parliament====
{{Main|1993 Russian constitutional crisis}}
Also throughout 1992, Yeltsin wrestled with the [[Supreme Soviet of Russia]] and the Congress of People's Deputies for control over government, government policy, government banking and property. In the course of 1992, the speaker of the Russian Supreme Soviet, [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]], came out in opposition to the reforms, despite claiming to support Yeltsin's overall goals. In December 1992, the 7th Congress of People's Deputies succeeded in turning down the Yeltsin-backed candidacy of Yegor Gaidar for the position of [[Prime Minister of Russia|Russian prime minister]]. An agreement was brokered by [[Valery Zorkin]], chairman of the Constitutional Court, which included the following provisions: a national referendum on the new constitution; parliament and Yeltsin would choose a new head of government, to be confirmed by the Supreme Soviet; and the parliament was to cease making constitutional amendments that change the balance of power between the legislative and executive branches. Eventually, on 14 December, [[Viktor Chernomyrdin]], widely seen as a compromise figure, was confirmed in the office.

The conflict escalated soon, however, with the parliament changing its prior decision to hold a referendum.
Yeltsin, in his turn, announced in a televised address to the nation on 20 March 1993, that he was going to assume certain &quot;special powers&quot; in order to implement his program of reforms. In response, the hastily called 9th Congress of People's Deputies attempted to remove Yeltsin from presidency through [[Impeachment in Russia|impeachment]] on 26 March 1993. Yeltsin's opponents gathered more than 600 votes for impeachment, but fell 72 votes short of the required two-thirds majority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acs.brockport.edu/~dgusev/Russian/bybio.html Boris Yeltsin]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RIAN archive 859348 US President George H. W. Bush and Russian President Boris Yeltsin.jpg|thumb|right|President Yeltsin with US President [[George H. W. Bush]], 1 June 1992]]

During the summer of 1993, a situation of [[dual power]] developed in Russia. Since July, two separate administrations of the [[Chelyabinsk Oblast]] functioned side by side, after Yeltsin refused to accept the newly elected pro-parliament head of the region. The Supreme Soviet pursued its own foreign policies, passing a declaration on the status of [[Sevastopol]].

In August, a commentator reflected on the situation as follows: &quot;The President issues decrees as if there were no Supreme Soviet, and the Supreme Soviet suspends decrees as if there were no President.&quot; ([[Izvestiya]], 13 August 1993).&lt;ref&gt;Executive decree authority By John M. Carey, Matthew Soberg. [http://books.google.com/books?id=2k9iI91GVt4C&amp;pg=PA76&amp;dq=yeltsin+decree+1400+1993&amp;ei=tZG3Sa3RGZaQyAST9rnXBA p. 76]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September 1993 Yeltsin announced in a televised address his decision to disband the Supreme Soviet and Congress of People's Deputies by decree.

In his address Yeltsin declared his intent to rule by decree until the election of the new parliament and a referendum on a new constitution, triggering the [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993|constitutional crisis of October 1993]]. On the night after Yeltsin's televised address, the Supreme Soviet declared Yeltsin removed from presidency, by virtue of his breaching the constitution, and Vice-President Alexander Rutskoy was sworn in as the acting president.

Between 21–24 September Yeltsin was confronted by significant popular unrest, encouraging the defenders of the parliament. Moscow saw what amounted to a spontaneous mass uprising of anti-Yeltsin demonstrators numbering in the tens of thousands marching in the streets resolutely seeking to aid forces defending the parliament building.{{clarify|date=December 2010}}&lt;!--This section makes no mention of an attack on the parliament building. Perhaps something is missing? --&gt; The demonstrators were protesting the new and terrible living conditions under Yeltsin. Since 1989 GDP had declined by half. Corruption was rampant, violent crime was skyrocketing, medical services were collapsing, food and fuel were increasingly scarce and life expectancy was falling for all but a tiny handful of the population; moreover, Yeltsin was increasingly getting the blame.

By early October, Yeltsin had secured the support of Russia's army and ministry of interior forces. In a massive show of force, Yeltsin called up tanks to shell the [[Russian White House]], Russia's parliament building. .

As Supreme Soviet was dissolved, in December 1993 elections to the newly established parliament, the [[State Duma]], were held. Candidates associated with Yeltsin's economic policies were overwhelmed by a huge anti-Yeltsin vote, the bulk of which was divided between the [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party]] and ultra-nationalists. The referendum, however, held at the same time, approved the new constitution, which significantly expanded the powers of the president, giving Yeltsin a right to appoint the members of the government, to dismiss the [[Prime Minister|prime minister]] and, in some cases, to dissolve the Duma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.departments.bucknell.edu/russian/const/ch4.html |title=Russian Constitution SECTION ONE Chapter 4 |publisher=Departments.bucknell.edu |accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Chechnya====
{{Main|First Chechen War}}

In December 1994, Yeltsin ordered the military invasion of [[Chechnya]] in an attempt to restore Moscow's control over the republic. Nearly two years later Yeltsin withdrew federal forces from the devastated Chechnya under a 1996 peace agreement brokered by [[Alexander Lebed]], then Yeltsin's security chief. The peace deal allowed Chechnya greater autonomy but not full independence.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The decision to launch the war in Chechnya dismayed many in the West. [[TIME magazine]] wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Then, what was to be made of Boris Yeltsin? Clearly he could no longer be regarded as the democratic hero of Western myth. But had he become an old- style communist boss, turning his back on the democratic reformers he once championed and throwing in his lot with militarists and ultranationalists? Or was he a befuddled, out-of-touch chief being manipulated, knowingly or unwittingly, by– well, by whom exactly? If there was to be a dictatorial coup, would Yeltsin be its victim or its leader?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982323-1,00.html | work=Time | title=Death Trap | date=16 January 1995 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Privatization and the rise of &quot;the oligarchs&quot;====
{{Main|Privatization in Russia}}

Following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Yeltsin promoted [[privatization in Russia|privatization]] as a way of spreading ownership of shares in former state enterprises as widely as possible to create political support for his economic reforms. In the West, privatization was viewed as the key to the transition from Communism in Eastern Europe, ensuring a quick dismantling of the Soviet-era command economy to make way for 'free market reforms.' In the early 1990s, [[Anatoly Chubais]], Yeltsin's deputy for economic policy, emerged as a leading advocate of privatization in Russia.

In late 1992, Yeltsin launched a program of free vouchers as a way to give mass privatization a jump-start. Under the program, all Russian citizens were issued vouchers, each with a nominal value of around 10,000 rubles, for purchase of shares of select state enterprises. Although each citizen initially received a voucher of equal face value, within months most of them converged in the hands of intermediaries who were ready to buy them for cash right away.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

In 1995, as Yeltsin struggled to finance Russia's growing foreign debt and gain support from the Russian business elite for his bid in the early-1996 presidential elections, the Russian president prepared for a new wave of privatization offering stock shares in some of Russia's most valuable state enterprises in exchange for bank loans. The program was promoted as a way of simultaneously speeding up privatization and ensuring the government a much-needed infusion of cash for its operating needs.

However, the deals were effectively giveaways of valuable state assets to a small group of tycoons in finance, industry, energy, telecommunications, and the media who came to be known as &quot;[[Business oligarch|oligarchs]]&quot; in the mid-1990s. This was due to the fact that ordinary people sold their vouchers for cash. The vouchers were bought out by a small group of investors. By mid-1996, substantial ownership shares over major firms were acquired at very low prices by a handful of people. [[Boris Berezovsky (businessman)|Boris Berezovsky]], who controlled major stakes in several banks and the national media, emerged as one of Yeltsin's most prominent backers. Along with Berezovsky, [[Mikhail Khodorkovsky]], [[Vladimir Potanin]], [[Vladimir Bogdanov]], [[Rem Viakhirev]], [[Vagit Alekperov]], [[Alexander Smolensky]], [[Victor Vekselberg]], [[Mikhail Fridman]] and a few years later [[Roman Abramovich]], were habitually mentioned in the media as Russia's oligarchs.

====Korean Air Lines Flight 007====
{{Main|Korean Air Lines Flight 007}}

On 5 December 1991, [[Jesse Helms|Senator Jesse Helms]], ranking member of the Minority on the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, wrote to Boris Yeltsin concerning U.S. servicemen who were POWs or MIAs. &quot;The status of thousands and thousands of American servicemen who are held by Soviet and other Communist forces, and who were never repatriated after every major war this century, is of grave concern to the American people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Moscow Bound 1993&quot;&gt;Moscow Bound: Policy, Politics, and the POW/MIA Dilemma, John M. G. Brown, Veteran Press, Eureka Springs, California, 1993, Chapt. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeltsin would ultimately respond with a statement made on 15 June 1992, while being interviewed aboard his presidential jet on his way to the United States, &quot;Our archives have shown that it is true&amp;nbsp;— some of them were transferred to the territory of the U.S.S.R. and were kept in labor camps... We can only surmise that some of them may still be alive.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moscow Bound 1993&quot; /&gt;
On 10 December 1991, just five days after Senator Helms had written Yeltsin concerning American servicemen, he again wrote to Yeltsin, this time concerning [[Korean Air Lines Flight 007]] (KAL 007) requesting information concerning possible survivors, including Congressman from Georgia [[Larry McDonald]], and their whereabouts.

&quot;One of the greatest tragedies of the Cold War was the shoot-down of the Korean Airlines Flight 007 by the Armed Forces of what was then the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983... The KAL-007 tragedy was one of the most tense incidences of the entire Cold War. However, now that relations between our two nations have improved substantially, I believe that it is time to resolve the mysteries surrounding this event. Clearing the air on this issue could help further to improve relations.&quot; In March 1992, Yeltsin would hand over KAL 007's Black Box without its tapes to Korean President [[Roh Tae-Woo]] at the end of the plenary session of the Korean National Assembly with this statement, &quot;We apologize for the tragedy and are trying to settle some unsolved issues.&quot;{{Cite quote|date=January 2009}}

Yeltsin would ultimately respond on 8 January 1992 by handing over to the [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) of the United Nations what the Russians had for so many years denied possessing: the tapes of the KAL 007's &quot;Black Box&quot; (its [[Digital]] [[Flight Data Recorder]] and [[Cockpit Voice Recorder]]).

The openness of Yeltsin about POW/MIA and KAL 007 matters may also have signaled his willingness for more openness to the West. In 1992, which he labelled the &quot;window of opportunity&quot;, he was willing to discuss biological weapons with the U.S. and admitted that the [[Sverdlovsk anthrax leak]] of 2 April 1979 had been caused as a result of a mishap at a military facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Evans |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB61/ |title=Anthrax at Sverdlovsk, 1979 |publisher=Gwu.edu |accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knoph JT, Westerdahl KS: Re-evaluating Russia's biological weapons policy, as reflected in the Criminal Code and Official Admissions: insubordination leading to a president's subordination. Crit Rev Microbiol. 2006;32(1):1–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian government had maintained that the cause was contaminated meat. The true number of victims in the anthrax outbreak at Sverdlovsk, about {{convert|850|mi|km|0}} east of Moscow, is not known.

====1996 presidential election====
In February 1996, Yeltsin announced that he would seek a second term in the [[Russian presidential election, 1996|spring 1996 Russian presidential election]]. The announcement followed weeks of speculation that Yeltsin was at the end of his political career because of his health problems and growing unpopularity in Russia. At the time Yeltsin was recuperating from a series of heart attacks. Domestic and international observers also noted his occasionally erratic behaviour. When campaigning opened at the beginning of 1996, Yeltsin's popularity was close to zero.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/pivotal.elections/1996/russia/candidate.html CNN, Russian presidential candidate profiles, 1906]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the opposition [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation]] had already gained ground in parliamentary voting on 17 December 1995, and its candidate, [[Gennady Zyuganov]], had a strong grass roots organization, especially in the rural areas and small towns, and appealed effectively to memories of the old days of Soviet prestige on the international stage and the socialist domestic order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/9602/russia_zyuganov/ |title=CNN, Gennady Zyuganov candidate profile, 1996 |publisher=CNN  |date=7 February 1996 |accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Panic struck the Yeltsin team when opinion polls suggested that the ailing president could not win; some members of his entourage urged him to cancel presidential elections and effectively rule as dictator from then on.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} Instead, Yeltsin changed his campaign team, assigning a key role to his daughter, [[Tatyana Dyachenko]], and appointing Chubais as campaign manager.&lt;ref&gt;http://vms.cc.wmich.edu/~97levintova/Ny.html&lt;/ref&gt; Chubais, acting as both Yeltsin's campaign manager and adviser on Russia's privatisation programme, used his control of the privatisation programme as an instrument of Yeltsin's reelection campaign.

In the spring of 1996, Chubais and Yeltsin recruited a team of a handful of financial and media oligarchs to bankroll the Yeltsin campaign and guaranteed favorable media coverage the president on national television and in leading newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Treisman, &quot;Blaming Russia First&quot;, ''Foreign Affairs'', November/December 2000. [http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20001101fareviewessay946/daniel-treisman/blaming-russia-first.html]&lt;/ref&gt; In return, Chubais allowed well-connected Russian business leaders to acquire majority stakes in some of Russia's most valuable state-owned assets.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Pekka Sutela, &quot;Insider Privatization in Russia: Speculations on Systemic Changes&quot;, ''Europe-Asia Studies'' 46:3 (1994), p. 420–21.&lt;/ref&gt; The media painted a picture of a fateful choice for Russia, between Yeltsin and a &quot;return to totalitarianism.&quot; The oligarchs even played up the threat of civil war if a Communist were elected president.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}
[[File:Boris Yeltsin with Bill Clinton-1.jpg|thumb|right|Yeltsin and [[Bill Clinton]] share a laugh in October 1995.]]
Yeltsin campaigned energetically, dispelling concerns about his health, and maintained a high media profile. To boost his popularity, Yeltsin promised to abandon some of his more unpopular economic reforms, boost welfare spending, end the war in Chechnya, and pay wage and pension arrears. Yeltsin's campaign also got a boost from the announcement of a $10&amp;nbsp;billion loan to the Russian government from the International Monetary Fund.&lt;ref&gt;CNN Interactive: Pivotal Elections: Russian Elections; Candidates: Boris Yeltsin [http://edition.cnn.com/WORLD/pivotal.elections/1996/russia/candidate.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Zyuganov, who lacked Yeltsin's resources and financial backing, saw his strong initial lead whittled away. After the first round on 16 June Yeltsin appointed a highly popular candidate [[Alexander Lebed]], who came in third in the first round, Secretary of the [[Security Council of Russia]], sacked at the latter's behest defence minister [[Pavel Grachev]] and on 20 June sacked a number of his ''[[siloviki]]'', one of them being his chief of presidential security [[Alexander Korzhakov]], viewed by many as Yeltsin's [[éminence grise]].

In the run-off on 3 July, with a turnout of 68.9%, Yeltsin won 53.8% of the vote and Zyuganov 40.3%, with the rest (5.9%) voting &quot;[[blank vote|against all]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://media.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/longterm/russiagov/stories/premier070596.htm |title=Lee Hockstader, Washington Post Foreign Service, Friday, 5 July 1996 |publisher=Media.washingtonpost.com |date=5 July 1996 |accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yeltsin's second term===
Yeltsin underwent an emergency [[Coronary artery bypass surgery#Number of bypasses|quintuple heart bypass surgery]] and remained in the hospital for months.

During Yeltsin's presidency, Russia received US$40&amp;nbsp;billion in funds from the [[International Monetary Fund]] and other international lending organizations. However, his opponents allege that most of these funds were stolen by people from Yeltsin's circle and placed in foreign banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/articles/?a=1999/7/26/125259|title=Where Is the IMF Money to Russia Really Going?|author=Stanislav Lunev|publisher=[[NewsMax.com]]|date=27 July 1999|accessdate=17 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-spark.net/csart264.html|title=Yeltsin, &quot;The Family&quot; and the Bureaucratic Mafia|author=the-spark.net|date=19 July 2003|accessdate=17 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/c-asia/AI11Ag01.html|title=Checkmate nears for Yeltsin|author=[[Asia Times Online]]|date=10 September 1999|accessdate=17 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, a political and economic crisis emerged when Yeltsin's government defaulted on its debts, causing financial markets to panic and the [[Russian ruble|ruble]] to collapse in the [[Russian financial crisis of 1998|1998 financial crisis]].

During the 1999 [[Kosovo war]], Yeltsin strongly opposed the [[NATO]] military campaign against [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], and warned of possible Russian intervention if NATO deployed ground troops to Kosovo. In televised comments he stated: &quot;I told NATO, the Americans, the Germans: Don't push us toward military action. Otherwise there will be a European war for sure and possibly world war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Yeltsin Warns Of European War Over Kosovo |agency=Reuters   |date=9 April 1999 }} Also, {{cite news |title=Yeltsin warns of possible world war over Kosovo |url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/europe/9904/09/kosovo.diplomacy.02/ |publisher=CNN |date=9 April 1999 |accessdate=23 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Boris Yeltsin 31 December 1999.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Yeltsin on the day of his resignation, together with Putin and [[Alexander Voloshin]]]]

On 15 May 1999, Yeltsin survived another attempt of [[impeachment in Russia|impeachment]], this time by the [[Yabloko|democratic]] and [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|communist]] opposition in the [[State Duma]]. He was charged with several unconstitutional activities, including the signing of the [[Belavezha Accords]] dissolving the [[Soviet Union]] in December 1991, the [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|coup-d'état in October 1993]], and initiating the war in [[Chechnya]] in 1994. None of these charges received the two-thirds majority of the Duma which was required to initiate the process of [[impeachment]] of the president.

On 9 August 1999 Yeltsin fired his prime minister, [[Sergei Stepashin]], and for the fourth time, fired his entire cabinet. In Stepashin's place he appointed [[Vladimir Putin]], relatively unknown at that time, and announced his wish to see Putin as his successor.

In late 1999 Yeltsin and President Clinton openly disagreed on the war in Chechnya. At the November meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, Clinton pointed his finger at Yeltsin and demanded he halt bombing attacks that had resulted in many civilian casualties. Yeltsin immediately left the conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Charles |last=Babington |title=Clinton Spars With Yeltsin On Chechnya, President Denounces Killing of Civilians |work=Washington Post |date=19 November 1999|pages= A01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December while visiting China to seek support on Chechnya, Yeltsin replied to Clinton’s criticism of a Russian ultimatum to citizens of Grozny. He bluntly pronounced: &quot;Yesterday, Clinton permitted himself to put pressure on Russia. It seems he has for a minute, for a second, for half a minute, forgotten that Russia has a full arsenal of nuclear weapons. He has forgotten about that.&quot; Clinton dismissed Yeltsin's comments stating: &quot;I didn't think he'd forgotten that America was a great power when he disagreed with what I did in Kosovo.&quot; It fell to Vladimir Putin to downplay Yeltsin's comments and present reassurances about U.S. and Russian relations.&lt;ref&gt;

====Resignation====
[[File:Boris Yeltsin-2.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Yeltsin appearing on TV announcing his resignation on 31 December 1999.]]
On 31 December 1999, in a surprise announcement aired at 12:00 (at noon) MSK on Russian television and taped in the morning of the same day, Yeltsin said he had resigned and Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] had taken over as acting president, with elections due to take place on 26 March 2000. Yeltsin asked for forgiveness for what he acknowledged were errors of his rule, and said Russia needed to enter the new century with new political leaders. Yeltsin said: &quot;I want to beg forgiveness for your dreams that never came true. And also I would like to beg forgiveness not to have justified your hopes.&quot;

==Illness==

Yeltsin suffered noticeably from heart disease during his first term as President of the Russian Federation, probably continuing for the rest of his life. Although the onset may have been earlier, his daughter has since said that he had a heart attack in September 1994 (see below). It is common knowledge that in early 1996 he was recuperating from a series of heart attacks and, soon after, he spent months in hospital recovering from a quintuple bypass operation (see above).  Eventually, the cause of his death in 2007 would be recorded as congestive heart failure.

According to numerous reports, Yeltsin struggled with alcoholism. The subject made headlines abroad during Yeltsin's visit to the U.S. in 1989 for a series of lectures on social and political life in the Soviet Union. That trip was described by a report in the Italian newspaper ''[[La Repubblica]]''. The article reported that Yeltsin often appeared drunk in public. The article was reprinted by ''[[Pravda]]''. Yeltsin's alleged alcoholism was also the subject of media discussion following his meeting with U.S. [[Deputy Secretary of State]] [[Strobe Talbott]] following Clinton's inauguration in 1993 and after his flight stop-over at [[Shannon Airport]], Ireland in September 1994 when the waiting Irish Taoiseach (prime minister) [[Albert Reynolds]] was told that Yeltsin was unwell and would not be leaving the aircraft. Reynolds tried to make excuses for him in an effort to offset his own humiliation in vainly waiting outside the plane to meet him. Speaking to the media in March 2010, Yeltsin's daughter [[Tatyana Yumasheva]], claimed that her father suffered a heart attack on the flight from the United States to Moscow and was therefore not in a position to leave the plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article7052415.ece|accessdate=7 March 2010|title=The sober truth behind Boris Yeltsin's drinking problem |work=The Times |location=London   | date=7 March 2010 | first=Mark | last=Franchetti}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to former Deputy Prime Minister of Russia [[Boris Nemtsov]], the bizarre behavior of Yeltsin resulted from &quot;strong drugs&quot; given to him by Kremlin doctors, which were incompatible even with a small amount of alcohol. This was discussed by journalist [[Yelena Tregubova]] from the &quot;[[Kremlin's pool]]&quot; in connection with an episode during Yeltsin's visit to [[Stockholm]] in 1997 when Yeltsin suddenly started talking nonsense (he allegedly told his bemused audience that Swedish meatballs reminded him of [[Björn Borg]]'s face),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article6849472.ece |work=The Times |location=London  | title=Understanding the news this week 26 September 2009  | date=25 September 2009 | accessdate=26 April 2010 | first=Tom | last=Whipple}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2009/02/17/office-party-the-top-ten-drunk-politicians-115875-21131145/ |title=Office party: The top ten worse for wear politicians |work=Daily Mirror |location=UK |accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; lost his balance, and almost fell down on the podium after drinking a single glass of Champagne.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yelena Tregubova]] ''Tales of a Kremlin Digger'' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Елена Трегубова.

Tregubova barely escaped an assassination attempt after publishing this material [http://www.cpj.org/news/2004/Russia02feb04na.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Yeltsin, in his memoirs, claimed no recollection of the event but did make a passing reference to the incident when he met Borg a year later at The World Circle Kabaddi Cup in Hamilton, Ontario, where the pair had been invited to present the trophy.&lt;ref&gt;Yeltsin, B &quot;Midnight Diaries&quot;, New York, p.344&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Yeltsin made a hasty withdrawal from the funeral of King [[Hussein of Jordan]] in February 1999.&lt;ref&gt;({{lang-ru|link=no|Елена Трегубова.

[http://www.perlentaucher.de/artikel/3350.html German translation].&lt;/ref&gt;

After Yeltsin's death, a Dutch neurosurgeon revealed that his team was secretly flown to Moscow to operate on Yeltsin in 1999. Yeltsin suffered from an unspecified neurological disorder that affected his sense of balance, causing him to wobble as if in a drunken state; the goal of the operation was to reduce the pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uk.rug.nl/archief/jaargang36/31/03f5.php|title=University professor reveals neurological disorder|publisher=Rijks Universiteit Groningen|date=3 May 2007|accessdate=31 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to author and historian [[Taylor Branch]]'s interviews with [[Bill Clinton]], on a 1995 visit to Washington D.C., Yeltsin was found on Pennsylvania Avenue, drunk, in his underwear and trying to hail a cab in order to find pizza.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Page, [http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-09-21-clinton-tapes_N.htm &quot;Secret interviews add insight to Clinton presidency&quot;], ''USA Today'', 21 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeltsin's personal and health problems received a great deal of attention in the global press. As the years went on, he was often viewed as an increasingly unstable leader, rather than the inspiring figure as whom he was once seen. The possibility that he might die in office was often discussed.
Starting in the last years of his presidential term, Yeltsin's primary residence was the ''Gorki-9'' presidential dacha west of Moscow. He made frequent stays at the nearby government sanatorium in [[Barvikha]].

==Life after resignation==
[[File:Boris Yeltsin 1 February 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|Yeltsin with [[Naina Yeltsina]] on his 75th birthday on 1 February 2006.]]

Yeltsin maintained a low profile after his resignation, making almost no public statements or appearances. However, on 13 September 2004, following the [[Beslan school hostage crisis]] and nearly concurrent terrorist attacks in Moscow, Putin launched an initiative to replace the election of regional governors with a system whereby they would be directly appointed by the president and approved by regional legislatures. Yeltsin, together with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], publicly criticized Putin's plan as a step away from democracy in Russia and a return to the centrally run political apparatus of the Soviet era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosnews.com/news/2004/09/16/exleaders.shtml|title=Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin Speak out Against Putin’s Reforms|publisher=MosNews.com|date=16 September 2004|accessdate=17 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, Yeltsin underwent a hip operation in Moscow after breaking his [[femur]] in a fall while vacationing on the Italian island of [[Sardinia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.com/p609848/r_1/Boris_Yeltsin_Leaves_Ward/|title=Boris Yeltsin Leaves Ward|author=Yulia Osipova|publisher=[[Kommersant]]|date=19 September 2005|accessdate=17 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February 2006, Yeltsin celebrated his 75th birthday. He used this occasion as an opportunity to criticize a &quot;monopolistic&quot; U.S. foreign policy, and to state that [[Vladimir Putin]] was the right choice for Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mosnews.com/interview/2006/01/30/yeltsin.shtml|title=Putin Was Right Choice for Russia—Boris Yeltsin|publisher=MosNews.com|date=30 January 2006|accessdate=17 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also disputed accusations of corruption.

Yeltsin was the first Russian head of state in 113 years to be buried in a church ceremony, after Emperor [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]. He was also the first leader in Russian and Soviet history to die quietly in retirement having overseen a peaceful transfer to his successor, [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] not having appointed a successor upon his death and [[Nikita Khrushchev|Khrushchev]] being ousted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article1695880.ece Tony Halpin. &quot;Yeltsin, the man who buried communism&quot;] ''The Times''. 24 April 2007{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

President Putin declared the day of his funeral a national [[day of mourning]], with the nation's flags flown at [[half mast]] and all entertainment programs suspended for the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kremlin.ru/text/docs/2007/04/125066.shtml|title=President's decree of mourning day|date=23 April 2007|accessdate=24 April 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070528213818/http://www.kremlin.ru/text/docs/2007/04/125066.shtml &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 28 May 2007}} {{Ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yeltsin is survived by his wife, [[Naina Yeltsina|Naina Iosifovna Yeltsina]], whom he married in 1956, and their two daughters Yelena and [[Tatyana Dyachenko|Tatyana]], born in 1957 and 1959 respectively.

Russian president [[Vladimir Putin]] said, declaring 25 April 2007 a [[National day of mourning|day of national mourning]], that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;[Yeltsin's] presidency has inscribed him forever in Russian and in world history. ... A new democratic Russia was born during his time: a free, open and peaceful country. A state in which the power truly does belong to the people. ... the first President of Russia’s strength consisted in the mass support of Russian citizens for his ideas and aspirations. Thanks to the will and direct initiative of President Boris Yeltsin a new constitution, one which declared human rights a supreme value, was adopted. It gave people the opportunity to freely express their thoughts, to freely choose power in Russia, to realise their creative and entrepreneurial plans. This Constitution permitted us to begin building a truly effective Federation. ... We knew him as a brave and a warm-hearted, spiritual person. He was an upstanding and courageous national leader. And he was always very honest and frank while defending his position. ... [Yeltsin] assumed full responsibility for everything he called for, for everything he aspired to. For everything he tried to do and did do for the sake of Russia, for the sake of millions of Russians. And he invariably took upon himself, let it in his heart, all the trials and tribulations of Russia, peoples’ difficulties and problems.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://president.kremlin.ru/eng/speeches/2007/04/23/2207_type82912_125079.shtml Vladimir Putin`s Address on the Occasion of Boris Yelstin’s Passing] Kremlin, 23 April 2007. Retrieved: 24 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shortly after the news broke, former Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] issued a statement, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt; &quot;I offer my deepest condolences to the family of a man on whose shoulders rested many great deeds for the good of the country and serious mistakes—a tragic fate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6584785.stm ''In quotes: Reactions to Yeltsin death''] 23 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In April 2008, a new memorial to Yeltsin was dedicated in Moscow's [[Novodevichy cemetery]], to mixed reactions.
At the memorial service, a military chorus performed [[Patrioticheskaya Pesnya|Russia's national anthem]]&amp;nbsp;— an anthem that was changed shortly after the end of Yeltsin's term, to [[National Anthem of Russia|follow the music]] of the [[National Anthem of the Soviet Union|old Soviet anthem]], with lyrics reflecting Russia's new status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/05/world/europe/05yeltsin.html?_r=1 | work=The New York Times | title=Reactions to a New Yeltsin Memorial, as to His Legacy, Are Mixed | first=Clifford J. | last=Levy | date=5 May 2008 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/archive/2008-04/2008-04-23-voa29.cfm |title=VOA &amp;#124; Russia Remembers Yeltsin &amp;#124; VOA &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; English |publisher=Voanews.com |date=23 April 2008 |accessdate=3 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
