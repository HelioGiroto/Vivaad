'''Patricia Campbell Hearst''' (born February 20, 1954), now known as '''Patricia Campbell Hearst Shaw''', is an American newspaper heiress, socialite, actress, kidnap victim, and convicted bank robber. Her kidnapping case is held by many as an example of [[Stockholm syndrome]].

The granddaughter of publishing magnate [[William Randolph Hearst]] and great-granddaughter of millionaire [[George Hearst]], she gained notoriety in 1974 when, following her [[kidnap]]ping by the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] (SLA), she ultimately joined her captors in furthering their cause. Apprehended after having taken part in a [[bank robbery]] with other SLA members, Hearst was imprisoned for almost two years before her sentence was [[Commutation (law)|commuted]] by President [[Jimmy Carter]].&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot;&gt;{{cite news

==Early life==
Hearst was born in [[San Francisco]], California, the third of five daughters of [[Randolph Apperson Hearst]] and Catherine Wood Campbell. She grew up primarily in [[Hillsborough, California|Hillsborough]]. She attended [[Crystal Springs Uplands School|Crystal Springs School for Girls]] in Hillsborough and the [[Santa Catalina School]] in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]]. Among her few close friends she counted Patricia Tobin, whose family founded the [[Hibernia Bank]], a branch of which Hearst would later aid in robbing.

===Kidnapping and the SLA===
[[Image:Hearst-hibernia-yell.jpg|left|thumb|Patty Hearst yelling commands at bank customers&lt;ref name=&quot;PH&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year = 2007 | url = http://www.famouspictures.org/mag/index.php?title=Patty_Hearst| title = Patty Hearst| publisher = Famous Pictures Magazine| accessdate = 2007-07-15 | last= Lucas, Dean}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

On February 4, 1974, the 19-year-old Hearst was kidnapped from the [[Berkeley, California]] apartment she shared with her fiancé Steven Weed by a left-wing urban guerrilla group called the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]]. When the attempt to swap Hearst for jailed SLA members failed, the SLA demanded that the captive's family distribute $70 worth of food to every needy Californian – an operation that would cost an estimated $400 million. In response, Hearst's father arranged the immediate donation of $6 million worth of food to the poor of the [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]]. After the distribution of food, the SLA refused to release Hearst because they deemed the food to have been of poor quality. (In a subsequent tape recording released to the press, Hearst commented that her father could have done better.)  On April 3, 1974, Hearst announced on an audiotape that she had joined the SLA and assumed the name &quot;Tania&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/guerrilla/timeline/timeline2.html | title = Timeline: Guerrilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst | publisher = [[American Experience]] | date = 2006-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (inspired by the ''[[nom de guerre]]'' of [[Haydée Tamara Bunke Bider]], [[Che Guevara]]'s comrade).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cuba honors the remains of 10 Guevara comrades&quot; JOSE LUIS MAGANA. ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''. Houston, Tex.: Dec 31, 1998. pg. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  For this reason, she is often referred to as a  victim of [[Stockholm Syndrome]].

On April 15, 1974, she was photographed wielding an [[M1 carbine]] while robbing the [[Sunset District]] branch of the Hibernia Bank at 1450 Noriega Street in San Francisco. Later communications from her were issued under the pseudonym ''Tania'' and asserted that she was committed to the goals of the SLA.&lt;ref&gt;1975 Year in Review: Patty Hearst Jailed-http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1975/Patty-Hearst-Jailed/12305821478075-9/&lt;/ref&gt; A warrant was issued for her arrest and in September 1975, she was arrested by the FBI and SFPD in a San Francisco apartment with other SLA member Wendy Yoshimura. FBI Agent Thomas Padden is credited with their actual arrests.

===Trial and imprisonment===
[[File:PattyHearstmug.jpg|thumb|250px|Arrest photo]]
While being booked into jail, she listed her occupation as &quot;Urban Guerilla&quot; and asked her attorney to relay the following message: &quot;Tell everybody that I'm smiling, that I feel free and strong and I send my greetings and love to all the sisters and brothers out there.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/printout/0,8816,913456,00.html | title = Patty's Twisted Journey | work = [[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date = 29 September 1975 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Hearst interviewer [[Margaret Singer]], a noted authority on [[prisoner of war]] and other victims including [[Maryknoll]] priests&lt;ref&gt;http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1310&amp;dat=19781229&amp;id=hAQVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=B-IDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3277,8989206&lt;/ref&gt; released from the [[People's Republic of China]] in the 1950s, this is not unusual in such cases. Singer strongly pleaded for understanding in Hearst's behalf before, during and after the trial. Court-appointed doctor [[Louis Jolyon West]] as well as interviewers Drs. [[Robert Jay Lifton]] and [[Martin Theodore Orne]] agreed.  Lifton went so far as to state after a 15-hour interview with Hearst that she was a &quot;classic case,&quot; about two weeks being needed for almost all persons undergoing that level of [[mind control]] to shuck off a good deal of the &quot;gunk&quot; that has filled the mind, as happened in his opinion with Hearst's case.  &quot;If (she) had reacted differently, that would have been suspect&quot; and Hearst was &quot;a rare phenomenon (in a first-world nation)... the first and as far as I know the only victim of a political kidnapping in the [[United States]]&quot; were direct quotes from Hearst's autobiography attributed to the doctor. Dr. West firmly asserted that while [[Donald DeFreeze|Donald &quot;Cinque&quot; DeFreeze]] and other movement members had used a rather coarse version, they did employ the classic Maoist formula for thought control; Hearst was young and apolitical enough to be at extreme risk and, in his professional experience, that it would have even broken many experienced soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/ctrl@listserv.aol.com/msg02163.html |title=[CTRL&amp;#93; Fwd: [MC&amp;#93; Patty Hearst on Joly West &amp; his friends |publisher=Mail-archive.com |date=1999-01-10 |accessdate=2010-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her trial, which commenced on January 15, 1976 (and in her dozens of previous interviews by [[FBI]] agents Charles Bates and Lawrence Lawler—any reference to which was not allowed by the presiding judge to be included in the trial), Hearst's attorney [[F. Lee Bailey]] claimed that Hearst had been blindfolded, imprisoned in a narrow closet and physically and sexually abused. Hearst's defense claimed that her actions were the result of a concerted brainwashing program.

The prosecution countered with two experts:  Dr. Joel Fort, who, unsolicited, had previously offered favorable testimony in paid service to the defense team, which was refused; and Dr. Harry L. Kozol, noted expert on [[brain disorders]], sex offenders and high-profile mentally ill criminals.  He formerly had been the long term doctor for [[Eugene O'Neill]] and evaluated the confessed Boston Strangler, [[Albert DeSalvo]], a case defended in 1967 by Bailey.  Kozol claimed Hearst was &quot;a rebel in search of a cause&quot; and that the robbery had been &quot;an act of free will.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/01/health/research/01kozol.html | work=The New York Times | title=Harry L. Kozol, Expert in Patty Hearst Trial, Is Dead at 102 | first=Benedict | last=Carey | date=2008-09-01 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During a pre-trial interview, Hearst accurately described the apartment where the SLA was captured, but neglected to mention the narrow closet where she was allegedly confined. In Kozol’s view, Hearst’s omission confirmed the prosecution’s thesis: returning the embrace of the SLA, she had ceased to be a victim. The rebel had come out of the closet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/12/28/magazine/28kozol-t.html?adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;adxnnlx=1280566991-UdEMvM5giWaVsydc6JiCng | work=The New York Times Magazine | title=Harry L. Kozol, born 1908 | first=Francis | last=Wilkinson | date=2008-12-24 | accessdate=2010-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kozol testified, Hearst turned “the dead white color of a fish’s belly,” according to journalist [[Shana Alexander]]. &quot;Harry never lost the spirit of the law,&quot; Dr. Harold W. Williams, then a psychiatrist at McLean Hospital in Belmont, told ''The New York Times'' in 1976, when prosecutors asked Dr. Kozol to examine Hearst. &quot;Harry is very much in personality a lawyer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/obituaries/articles/2008/08/31/harry_kozol_exposed_dark_side_of_human_behavior_102/| work=The Boston Globe | title=Harry Kozol, exposed dark side of human character 102| first=Brian | last=Marquard | date=2008-08-31 | accessdate=2010-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey argued that she had been coerced or intimidated into taking part in the bank robbery. However, she refused to give evidence against the other captured SLA members. This was seen as complicity by the prosecution team.

Hearst was convicted of bank robbery on March 20, 1976. She was sentenced to 35 years' imprisonment, but her sentence was later [[Commutation of sentence|commuted]] to seven years. Her prison term was also eventually commuted by President Jimmy Carter,&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot; /&gt; and Hearst was released from prison on February 1, 1979, having served 22 months. She was granted a full [[pardon]] by President [[Bill Clinton]] on January 20, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;time&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;doj&quot; /&gt;

==Personal life==
After her release from prison, she married her former bodyguard, Bernard Shaw. She and Shaw have two children, Gillian and [[Lydia Hearst-Shaw]], and reside in [[Garrison, New York|Garrison]], [[New York]].  Hearst has occasionally granted  interviews to national media regarding the SLA incidents and taken minor acting parts.

==Documentaries about Hearst==
*Hearst's 1982 autobiography, ''Every Secret Thing'', was made into the [[biopic]] [[Patty Hearst (film)|''Patty Hearst'']] by [[Paul Schrader]] in 1988, with [[Natasha Richardson]] portraying Hearst.
*Robert Stone in 2004 directed ''[[Guerrilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/guerrilla/ Guerrilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst] on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on the media frenzy surrounding the Symbionese Liberation Army, and includes new footage and interviews.  (The film was released in some countries under the title ''Neverland: The Rise and Fall of the Symbionese Liberation Army.'')

==Material produced by Hearst==
*Dissatisfied with other documentaries made on the subject, Hearst produced a special for the [[Travel Channel]] entitled ''Secrets of San Simeon with Patricia Hearst'' in which she took viewers inside her grandfather's mansion [[Hearst Castle]], providing unprecedented access to the property. (A video and DVD were later released of the special.){{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}
*Hearst co-authored a novel with Cordelia Frances Biddle titled ''Murder at San Simeon'' (Scribner, 1996), based upon the death of [[Thomas H. Ince|Thomas Ince]] on her grandfather's yacht.

==Acting roles==
Hearst has dabbled in a career as an actress. 
*Her notoriety intersected with the criminal obsessions and [[camp (style)|camp]] sensibilities of filmmaker [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], who has used Hearst in numerous small roles in films including ''[[Cry-Baby]]'', ''[[Serial Mom]]'', ''[[Pecker (film)|Pecker]]'', ''[[Cecil B. DeMented]]'', and ''[[A Dirty Shame]]''.
*Hearst appeared in the films ''[[Bio-Dome]]'' and ''Second Best''.
*Hearst supplied the voice for the character Haffa Dozen, an ex-stripper appearing on the October 19, 2005, episode of the Sci-Fi Channel's animated TV series ''[[Tripping the Rift]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/354165p-301901c.html | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051013061311/http://www.nydailynews.com/front/story/354165p-301901c.html | archivedate = 2005-10-13 | title = Hearst: U.S. needs defense against panic attacks, too | publisher = [[NY Daily News]] | date = 2005-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* She appeared in an episode of ''[[The Adventures of Pete &amp; Pete]]'' as Mrs. Kretchmar, the nicest housewife in the world.
* Notably playing against type, Hearst played a crack-addicted prostitute on an episode of the comedic ''[[Son of the Beach]]''.
* Hearst's voice was used as a caller in the ''[[Frasier]]'' episode, [[Frasier Crane's Day Off]] in 1994.
* She appeared as [[Anthony Clark (actor)|Anthony Clark]]'s mother on the sitcom ''[[Boston Common (TV series)|Boston Common]]''.
* She appeared in a [[Lord of the Pi's|season 3 episode]] of ''[[Veronica Mars]]'' portraying Selma Hearst, the granddaughter of the founder of Hearst College and college board member, who had faked her own kidnapping. Although Hearst College is fictional, it strongly echoes the real Stanford family history, with the founder being a railroad tycoon rather than a media baron.
