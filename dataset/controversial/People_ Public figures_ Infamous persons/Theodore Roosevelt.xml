A Republican, he is noted for his exuberant personality, range of interests and achievements, and his leadership of the [[Progressive Era|Progressive Movement]], as well as his &quot;[[cowboy]]&quot; persona and robust [[masculinity]].&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/content/theodore-roosevelts-wild-side Douglas Brinkley] &quot;TR's Wild Side,&quot; ''American Heritage'', Fall 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a leader of the [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]] and founder of the short-lived [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive (&quot;Bull Moose&quot;) Party of 1912]]. Before becoming President, he held offices at the city, state, and federal levels. Roosevelt's achievements as a naturalist, explorer, hunter, author, and soldier are as much a part of his fame as any office he held as a politician. Roosevelt was 42 years old when sworn in as President of the United States in 1901, making him the youngest president ever; he beat out the youngest elected president, [[John F. Kennedy]], by only one year. Roosevelt was also the first of only three sitting presidents to have won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;The other two Presidents who win the Nobel Peace Prize were [[Woodrow Wilson]] (1919) and [[Barack Obama]] ([[2009 Nobel Peace Prize|2009]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Born into a wealthy family in New York City, Roosevelt was a sickly child who suffered from [[asthma]] and stayed at home studying [[natural history]].  To compensate for his physical weakness, he embraced a strenuous life. Home-schooled, he became an eager student of nature. He attended [[Harvard University]], where he studied biology, boxed and developed an interest in naval affairs. In 1881, one year out of Harvard, he was elected to the [[New York State Assembly]], where he became a leader of the reform faction of his [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] (the &quot;GOP&quot;). His ''The Naval War of 1812'' (1882) established his professional reputation as a serious historian; he wrote numerous books on hunting, the outdoors, and current political issues, as well as frontier history. In 1884, his wife and his mother died on the same day. He left politics and went to the frontier, becoming a rancher in the &quot;Badlands&quot; in the Dakotas. Returning home, he ran for mayor in 1886, finishing third with 60,000 votes. He later gained fame by taking vigorous charge of the city police. At the national level, he was a leader in civil service reform. The [[Spanish–American War]] broke out in 1898 while Roosevelt was, effectively, running the [[United States Department of the Navy|Department of the Navy]]. He promptly resigned and formed the [[Rough Riders]] – a volunteer cavalry regiment that fought in [[Cuba]]. The war hero was elected [[List of Governors of New York|governor]] in 1898 and in 1900 was nominated for vice president. He successfully energized the GOP base as a highly visible campaigner to reelect President [[William McKinley]] on a platform of high tariffs, the gold standard, imperialism, prosperity at home and victory abroad.

In 1901, President [[William McKinley]] was [[assassination of William McKinley|assassinated]] and Roosevelt became President at the age of 42; he remains the youngest president.&lt;ref&gt;[[John F. Kennedy]] is the youngest person to be ''elected'' President. Roosevelt was not elected to the Presidency until 1904, when he was 46.&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt attempted to move the Republican Party (GOP) toward [[Progressive Era|Progressivism]], including [[trust busting]] and increased regulation of businesses. In [[United States presidential election, 1904|1904]] Roosevelt was elected to a full term of his own, becoming the first person to do so,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ragone |first=Nick |url=http://www.netplaces.com/american-government/the-vice-presidency/vice-president-as-successor.htm |title=Vice President As Successor - American Government |publisher=Netplaces.com |date=February 23, 2011 |accessdate=October 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as winning the largest percentage of the popular vote since the uncontested [[United States presidential election, 1820|election of 1820]]. Roosevelt coined the phrase &quot;[[Square Deal]]&quot; to describe his domestic agenda, emphasizing that the average citizen would get a fair share under his policies. As an outdoorsman and naturalist, he promoted the [[conservation movement]]. On the world stage, Roosevelt's policies were characterized by his slogan, &quot;[[Big Stick ideology|Speak softly and carry a big stick]]&quot;. Roosevelt was the force behind the completion of the [[Panama Canal]]; sent the [[Great White Fleet]] on a world tour to demonstrate American power; and negotiated an end to the [[Russo-Japanese War]], for which he won the [[Nobel Peace Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;Frederick W. Marks III, ''Velvet on Iron: The Diplomacy of Theodore Roosevelt'' (1979); Greg Russell, &quot;Theodore Roosevelt's Diplomacy and the Quest for Great Power Equilibrium in Asia,&quot; ''Presidential Studies Quarterly'' 2008 38(3): 433–455&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the end of his [[United States presidential election, 1904|second term]], Roosevelt promoted his friend [[William Howard Taft]] for the [[United States presidential election, 1908|1908 Republican nomination]]. He toured Africa and Europe. On his return in 1910 he broke bitterly with President Taft on issues of progressivism and personalities. In [[United States presidential election, 1912|the 1912 election]] Roosevelt tried and failed to block Taft's renomination. He launched the Bull Moose Party that called for far-reaching progressive reforms. He lost to Democrat [[Woodrow Wilson]], as the Taft conservatives gained control of the Republican party for decades to come. Roosevelt led a major expedition to the Amazon jungles but contracted diseases which ruined his health. He died relatively young at the age of 60. Roosevelt has consistently been ranked by scholars as one of the [[Historical rankings of United States Presidents|greatest U.S. Presidents]], having revived a declining presidency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vitello |first=Paul |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/22/nyregion/john-m-blum-historian-who-gave-theodore-roosevelt-his-due-dies-at-90.html?_r=0 |title=John M.

==Family==
{{Main|Roosevelt family}}

===Parents===
Roosevelt often described his ancestry as &quot;half Irish and half Dutch.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Speeches at New England Dinner and Union League Dinner, 1898. [http://pds.lib.harvard.edu/pds/view/3191962?n=10&amp;imagesize=1200&amp;jp2Res=.25&amp;printThumbnails=no Excerpts here.]&lt;/ref&gt; His patrilineal Roosevelt family, colonists of Dutch origin, had been in New York since the mid-17th century. Roosevelt was born into considerable wealth, for the family by the 19th century had grown in wealth and influence from the profits of several businesses, including hardware and plate-glass importing. The family was strongly [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] in its political affiliation until the mid-1850s, and then joined the new [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. Theodore's father, known in the family as &quot;Thee&quot;, was a New York philanthropist, merchant, and partner in the family glass-importing firm Roosevelt and Son. &quot;Father,&quot; as the children called him, was an ardent patriot and a prominent supporter of [[Abraham Lincoln]] and the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] effort during the Civil War. His mother Martha &quot;Mittie&quot; Bulloch was a [[Southern belle]] from a slave-owning family in [[Roswell, Georgia]], and she maintained [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] sympathies. Mittie's brother, Theodore's uncle, [[James Dunwoody Bulloch]], was a [[United States Navy]] officer who became a Confederate Navy commander and secret agent in Great Britain who was most responsible for the destruction of the United States merchant fleet and procuring ships and supplies to run through the Union blockade.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Walter E. and Gary L. McKay, ''James D. Bulloch; Secret Agent and Mastermind of the Confederate Navy'' (Jefferson, NC: McFarland, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; Another uncle, [[Irvine Bulloch]], was a midshipman on the Confederate raider {{Ship|CSS|Alabama}}; both remained in England after the war.&lt;ref&gt;Pringle (1931) p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

Theodore Roosevelt was distantly related by birth to the 32nd president of the United States, [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] (they were fifth cousins), and he was the uncle and guardian of Franklin D. Roosevelt's wife, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]].

===Childhood===
[[File:TR Age 11 Paris.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Theodore Roosevelt at age 11]]

Theodore Roosevelt was born on October 27, 1858, in a [[Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site|four-story brownstone at 28 East 20th Street]], in the modern-day [[Gramercy, New York|Gramercy]] section of [[New York City]], the second of four children of [[Theodore Roosevelt, Sr.]] (1831–1878) and [[Martha Bulloch Roosevelt|Martha &quot;Mittie&quot; Bulloch]] (1835–1884). He had an older sister, [[Bamie Roosevelt|Anna]], and two younger siblings: his brother [[Elliott Roosevelt I|Elliott]] (the father of future [[First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]]) and his sister [[Corinne Roosevelt Robinson|Corinne]].

Sickly and [[asthma]]tic as a child, Roosevelt had to sleep propped up in bed or slouching in a chair during much of his early years, and had frequent ailments. Despite his illnesses, he was hyperactive and often mischievous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.staff.ncl.ac.uk/t.d.griffiths/Wellcome_News_2006.pdf |title=Lost in tone |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=September 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lifelong interest in [[zoology]] was formed at age seven upon seeing a dead [[Pinniped|seal]] at a local market. After obtaining the seal's head, the young Roosevelt and two of his cousins formed what they called the &quot;Roosevelt Museum of Natural History&quot;. Learning the rudiments of [[taxidermy]], he filled his makeshift museum with animals that he killed or caught, studied, and prepared for display. At age nine, he codified his observation of insects with a paper titled &quot;The Natural History of Insects&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;environment&quot;&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/tr/envir.html &quot;TR's Legacy—The Environment&quot;.]. Retrieved March 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Encouraged by his father, the boy began exercising and boxing to combat his poor physical condition.&lt;ref&gt;Thayer, William Roscoe (1919). [http://www.bartleby.com/170/ ''Theodore Roosevelt: An Intimate Biography''], Chapter I, p. 20. Bartleby.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Two trips abroad had a lasting impact: family tours of Europe in 1869 and 1870, and [[Egypt]] 1872 to 1873.

Theodore, Sr., had a tremendous influence on his son, who wrote of him, &quot;My father, Theodore Roosevelt, was the best man I ever knew. He combined strength and courage with gentleness, tenderness, and great unselfishness. He would not tolerate in us children selfishness or cruelty, idleness, cowardice, or untruthfulness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Roosevelt, Theodore (1913). ''Theodore Roosevelt: An Autobiography'', Chapter I, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:5.5.12TeddyRooseveltTaxidermyKitByLuigiNovi3.jpg|thumb|left|Roosevelt's taxidermy kit.&lt;ref&gt;Sanabria, Santa (June 26, 2011). [http://www.hudsonreporter.com/view/full_stories_home/14475869/article-Mounted-in-New-Jersey-Lifelong-UC-resident-is-famous-taxidermist-?instance=union%20city_story_left_column &quot;Mounted in New Jersey&quot;]. ''[[The Hudson Reporter]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Young &quot;Teedie&quot;&lt;!-- Note to editors: Yes, he was called &quot;Teedie.&quot; This is not a typo. This is sourced, please do not alter it. --&gt;, as he was nicknamed as a child, was mostly [[Homeschooling|home schooled]] by tutors and his parents. A leading biographer says: &quot;The most obvious drawback to the home schooling Roosevelt received was uneven coverage of the various areas of human knowledge.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brands ''T. R.'' p. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt; He was solid in geography (thanks to his careful observations on all his travels) and well read in history, strong in biology, [[List of Presidents of the United States by languages spoken|French, and German]], but deficient in mathematics, Latin and Greek.

He matriculated at [[Harvard College]] in 1876. His father's death in 1878 was a tremendous blow, but Roosevelt redoubled his activities. He did well in science, philosophy and rhetoric courses but fared poorly in Latin and Greek. He studied biology with considerable interest and was already an accomplished [[naturalist]] and published [[ornithology|ornithologist]]. He had a [[eidetic memory|photographic memory]] and developed a lifelong habit of devouring books, memorizing every detail.&lt;ref&gt;Brands p. 62&lt;/ref&gt; He was an eloquent conversationalist who, throughout his life, sought out the company of the smartest people. He could multitask in impressive fashion, dictating letters to one secretary and memoranda to another, while browsing through a new book.  While at Harvard, Roosevelt was active in rowing, boxing, the [[Alpha Delta Phi]] literary society, the [[Delta Kappa Epsilon]] fraternity, and was a member of the [[Porcellian Club]]. He also edited ''[[The Harvard Advocate]]''. He was runner-up in the Harvard boxing championship.

Upon graduating, Roosevelt underwent a physical examination, and his doctor advised him that because of serious heart problems, he should find a desk job and avoid strenuous activity. He chose to embrace strenuous life instead.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, ''The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt'', pg 67&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] (22nd of 177) from Harvard with an [[Bachelors of Arts|A.B.]] ''[[magna cum laude]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2008/11/obama-joins-list-of-seven-presidents-with-harvard-degrees/ |title=Obama joins list of seven presidents with Harvard degrees &amp;#124; Harvard Gazette |publisher=News.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1880 and entered [[Columbia Law School]]. When offered a chance to run for [[New York Assembly]]man in 1881, he dropped out of law school to pursue his new goal of entering public life.&lt;ref&gt;Brands, pp 123–29&lt;/ref&gt;

===First marriage===
In 1880, Roosevelt married [[Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt|Alice Hathaway Lee]] (July 29, 1861&amp;nbsp;– February 14, 1884) of Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts.  She died young of an undiagnosed case of [[kidney failure]] (in those days called [[Bright's disease]]) two days after their infant [[Alice Roosevelt Longworth|Alice]] was born. Her pregnancy had masked the illness.  Theodore Roosevelt's mother Mittie died of [[typhoid fever]] on the same day, at 3&amp;nbsp;am, some eleven hours earlier, in the same house. After the nearly simultaneous deaths of his mother and wife, Roosevelt left his daughter in the care of his sister, Anna &quot;Bamie/Bye&quot; in New York City. In his diary, he wrote a large 'X' on the page and then, &quot;The light has gone out of my life.&quot; (See diary photo).[[File:Light has gone out.jpg|thumb|right|Diary entry February 14, 1884]]

For the rest of his life, Roosevelt never spoke of his wife Alice publicly or privately and did not write about her in his autobiography. As late as 1919, when Roosevelt was working with Joseph Bucklin Bishop on a biography that included a collection of his letters, Roosevelt did not mention either his first or second marriage, which took place in London.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, ''Rise of TR'', pg 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==

===''The Naval War of 1812''===
While at Harvard, Roosevelt began a systematic study of the role played by the nascent [[United States Navy|US Navy]] in the [[War of 1812]], largely completing two chapters of a book he would publish after graduation.&lt;ref&gt;Autobiography, pg 35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Rise of, pg 565&lt;/ref&gt; Helped in part by his two uncles, he did his own research using original source materials and official US Navy records. Roosevelt's carefully researched book was comparable to modern [[doctoral dissertation]]s, complete with drawings of individual and combined ship maneuvers, charts depicting the differences in iron throw weights of cannon shot between American and British forces, and analyses of the differences between British and American leadership down to the ship-to-ship level. Published after Roosevelt's graduation from college, ''The Naval War of 1812'' was praised for its scholarship and style. This book established Roosevelt's reputation as a serious historian.&lt;ref name=ijnh/&gt; One modern naval historian wrote: &quot;Roosevelt’s study of the War of 1812 influenced all subsequent scholarship on the naval aspects of the War of 1812 and continues to be reprinted.

===State Assemblyman===
Roosevelt was a [[History of the United States Republican Party|Republican]] activist during his years in the Assembly, writing more bills than any other New York state legislator did. Already a leading player in state politics, he attended the [[1884 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] in 1884 and fought alongside the [[Mugwump]] reformers; they lost to the [[Stalwart (politics)|Stalwart]] faction that nominated [[James G. Blaine]]. Refusing to join other Mugwumps in supporting [[Grover Cleveland]], the [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] nominee, he debated with his friend [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] the pros and cons of staying loyal. When asked by a reporter whether he would support Blaine, he replied, &quot;That question I decline to answer. It is a subject I do not care to talk about.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Rise of, pg 267.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon leaving the convention, he complained &quot;[[Journalism sourcing#Using confidential information|off the record]]&quot; to a reporter about Blaine's nomination. In a crucial moment of his budding political career, he resisted the instinct to bolt from the Party that would overwhelm his political sense in 1912. In an account of the convention, another reporter quoted Roosevelt as saying that he would give &quot;hearty support to any decent Democrat.&quot; He would later take great (and to some historical critics such as Henry Pringle, disingenuous) pains to distance himself from his earlier comment, indicating that while he made it, it had not been made &quot;for publication.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Theodore Roosevelt, A Biography, by Henry Pringle&quot;, pg 61&lt;/ref&gt; Leaving the convention with his idealism  disillusioned by party politics, Roosevelt said he had no further aspiration but to retire to his ranch in the [[Badlands]] of the [[Dakota Territory]], which he had purchased the previous year while on a buffalo hunting expedition.

==Cowboy in Dakota==
[[File:TR Buckskin Tiffany Knife.jpg|thumb|upright|Theodore Roosevelt as [[Badlands]] hunter in 1885. New York studio photo.]]
Roosevelt built a second ranch, which he named Elk Horn, thirty-five miles (56&amp;nbsp;km) north of the [[boomtown]] of [[Medora, North Dakota]]. On the banks of the [[Little Missouri River (North Dakota)|Little Missouri]], Roosevelt learned to ride western style, rope, and hunt. He rebuilt his life and began writing about frontier life for Eastern magazines, as well publishing three books:
* ''Hunting Trips of a Ranchman'', New York and London: [[G. P. Putnam's Sons]], 1885 ISBN 1-58734-042-9
* ''Ranch Life and the Hunting-Trail'', New York: [[The Century Company|The Century Co.]], 1888 ISBN 1-58734-044-5
* ''The Wilderness Hunter'', New York and London: [[G. P. Putnam's Sons]], 1893 ISBN 0-8398-1765-7

As a deputy [[Sheriffs in the United States|sheriff]], Roosevelt hunted down three outlaws who stole his riverboat and were escaping north with it up the Little Missouri. Capturing them, he decided against hanging them (apparently yielding to established law procedures in place of [[vigilante]] justice), and sending his foreman back by boat, he took the thieves back overland for trial in [[Dickinson, North Dakota|Dickinson]], guarding them forty hours without sleep and reading [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] to keep himself awake. When he ran out of his own books, he read a [[dime novel|dime store western]] that one of the thieves was carrying.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Hagedorn|first=Herman|year=1921|title=Roosevelt in the Bad Lands|publisher=Houghton-Mifflin|location=New York |page=379|author =}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While searching for a group of relentless horse thieves, Roosevelt met [[Seth Bullock]], the famous sheriff of [[Deadwood, South Dakota]]. The two would remain friends for life.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Rise of, 241–245, 247–250&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to New York==
After the uniquely severe U.S. [[winter of 1886-1887]] wiped out his herd of cattle (together with those of his competitors) and most of his $80,000 investment,&lt;ref&gt;Morris, The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt, pg 376&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt returned to the East.  In 1885, he had built [[Sagamore Hill]] in [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay]], [[New York]] on Long Island, which was his home and estate until his death. 

In 1886, Roosevelt ran as the Republican candidate for mayor of New York City, portraying himself as &quot;The Cowboy of the Dakotas.&quot; Due to information on the in-progress election, Republican insiders warned voters that George was leading and that Roosevelt was likely beat, thus causing a last-minute defection of Republican voters to the Democratic candidate Hewitt. Theodore Roosevelt took third place. The election results showed Hewitt (D) with 90,552 votes, George (United Labor) with 68,110, and Roosevelt (R) with 60,435.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt, pg 355&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second marriage===
Following the election, he went to [[London]] in 1886 and married his childhood sweetheart, [[Edith Roosevelt|Edith Kermit Carow]].&lt;ref&gt;Thayer, Chapter V, pp. 4, 6.&lt;/ref&gt; They honeymooned in Europe, and Roosevelt led a group to the summit of [[Mont Blanc]], an achievement that resulted in his induction into the [[British Royal Society]].&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica,'' 1910 Edition, Topic: Theodore Roosevelt&lt;/ref&gt; They had five children: [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.|Theodore Jr.]], [[Kermit Roosevelt|Kermit]], [[Ethel Roosevelt Derby|Ethel Carow]], [[Archibald Roosevelt|Archibald Bulloch]] &quot;Archie&quot;, and [[Quentin Roosevelt|Quentin]].&lt;ref&gt;Although Roosevelt's father was also named Theodore Roosevelt, he died while the future president was still childless and unmarried, so the future President Roosevelt took the suffix of Sr. and subsequently named his son Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.  Because Roosevelt was still alive when his grandson and namesake was born, his grandson was named [[Theodore Roosevelt III]], and the president's son retained the Jr. after his father's death.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reentering public life===

====Civil Service Commission====
In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1888|1888 presidential election]], Roosevelt campaigned in the Midwest for [[Benjamin Harrison]]. President Harrison appointed Roosevelt to the [[United States Civil Service Commission]], where he served until 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Thayer, ch. VI, pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; In his term, Roosevelt vigorously fought the [[spoils system|spoilsmen]] and demanded enforcement of civil service laws. His close associate, friend and biographer, [[Joseph Bucklin Bishop]], described Roosevelt's assault on the spoils system:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The very citadel of spoils politics, the hitherto impregnable fortress that had existed unshaken since it was erected on the foundation laid by Andrew Jackson, was tottering to its fall under the assaults of this audacious and irrepressible young man.... Whatever may have been the feelings of the (fellow Republican party) President (Harrison)&amp;nbsp;— and there is little doubt that he had no idea when he appointed Roosevelt that he would prove to be so veritable a bull in a china shop—he refused to remove him and stood by him firmly till the end of his term.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=KPMEAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Theodore+Roosevelt+and+His+Time+Shown+in+His+Own+Letters#PPA2,M1 |title=Bishop, ''Theodore Roosevelt and His Time'' Book I, pg 51 |publisher=Books.google.com |date=July 18, 2007 |accessdate=September 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;During this time, the ''New York Sun'' described Roosevelt as &quot;irrepressible, belligerent, and enthusiastic&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;

====New York City Police Commissioner====
Roosevelt became president of the board of [[New York City Police Commissioner]]s in 1895. During his two years in this post, Roosevelt radically reformed the police department. The police force was reputed as one of the most corrupt in America. The NYPD's history division records that Roosevelt was &quot;an iron-willed leader of unimpeachable honesty, (who) brought a reforming zeal to the New York City Police Commission in 1895.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, William, &quot;The Early Years: The Challenge of Public Order – 1845 to 1870&quot;, [http://web.archive.org/web/20060930063300/http://nyc.gov/html/nypd/html/3100/retro.html – New York City Police Department History Site]. Retrieved August 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt and his fellow commissioners established new disciplinary rules, created a [[police bicycle|bicycle squad]] to enforce New York's traffic laws, and standardized the use of pistols by officers.&lt;ref&gt;Editors, &quot;Leadership of the City of New York Police Department 1845–1901&quot;, [http://www.nycpolicemuseum.org/html/tour/leadr1845.htm – The New York City Police Department Museum]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}.  Retrieved August 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  He selected the [[Colt New Police Revolver]] in .32 Colt Caliber as the first standard issue pistol for the [[NYPD]]. Roosevelt implemented regular inspections of firearms and annual physical exams, appointed 1,600 recruits based on their physical and mental qualifications and not on political affiliation, established meritorious service medals, and closed corrupt police hostelries. During his tenure, a [[Municipal Lodging House]] was established by the Board of Charities, and Roosevelt required officers to register with the Board. He also had telephones installed in station houses.

In 1894, Roosevelt met [[Jacob Riis]], the [[muckraker|muckraking]] ''Evening Sun'' newspaper journalist who was opening the eyes of New York's rich to the terrible conditions of the city's millions of poor immigrants with such books as, ''[[How the Other Half Lives]].'' In Riis' autobiography, he described the effect of his book on the new police commissioner:

{{bquote|When Roosevelt read [my] book, he came....No one ever helped as he did. For two years we were brothers in (New York City's crime-ridden) Mulberry Street. When he left I had seen its golden age.... There is very little ease where Theodore Roosevelt leads, as we all of us found out. The lawbreaker found it out who predicted scornfully that he would “knuckle down to politics the way they all did,” and lived to respect him, though he swore at him, as the one of them all who was stronger than pull....that was what made the age golden, that for the first time a moral purpose came into the street. In the light of it everything was transformed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/207/13.html#Z54 Riis, Jacob, A, ''The Making of an American''] Chapter XIII, page 3, Bartleby Website&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Emergence as a national figure==

===Assistant Secretary of the Navy===
Roosevelt had always been fascinated by naval history. Urged by Roosevelt's close friend, Congressman [[Henry Cabot Lodge]], President [[William McKinley]] appointed Roosevelt to the post of [[Assistant Secretary of the Navy]] in 1897. Because of the inactivity of [[Secretary of the Navy]] [[John D. Long]], this gave Roosevelt control over the department. Ten days after the battleship ''[[USS Maine (ACR-1)|Maine]]'' exploded &lt;ref name=&quot;Destruction of the Maine (1898)&quot;&gt;Fisher, Louis [http://loc.gov/law/help/usconlaw/pdf/Maine.1898.pdf] The Law Library of Congress. Access date, 25 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; in the harbor of [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], the Secretary left for a massage, and Roosevelt became Acting Secretary for four hours. Roosevelt told the Navy worldwide to prepare for war, ordered ammunition and supplies, brought in experts, and went to Congress asking for authority to recruit as many sailors as he wanted, thus moving the nation toward war.&lt;ref&gt;Mansfield, Harvey C., ''Manliness'' (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, 2006 (ISBN 978-0-300-10664-0)), p. 97 (author prof. govt., Harvard Univ.).&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt was instrumental in preparing the Navy for the [[Spanish–American War]]&lt;ref&gt;Brands ch 12&lt;/ref&gt; and was an enthusiastic supporter of testing the U.S. military in combat, at one point saying, &quot;I should welcome almost any war, for I think this country needs one&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBS1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/crucible/tl7.html |title=April 16, 1897: T.

[[File:Theodore Rooseveltnewtry.jpg|thumb|upright|Col. Theodore Roosevelt]]

===War in Cuba===
Upon the 1898 [[Declaration of War]] launching the Spanish–American War, Roosevelt resigned from the Navy Department. With the aid of [[U.S. Army]] [[Colonel]] [[Leonard Wood]], Roosevelt found volunteers from [[cowboy]]s from the Western territories to [[Ivy League]] friends from New York, forming the [[Rough Riders|First U.S. Volunteer Cavalry Regiment]]. The newspapers called them the &quot;Rough Riders.&quot;

====Landing in Cuba====
The Rough Riders were part of the [[Calvary]] Division commanded by the former dashing Confederate cavalry officer turned US representative, [[Joseph Wheeler]]. Wheeler was given command of the Cavalry Division which was one of 3 divisions that were part of V Corps under Lt General [[William Rufus Shafter]]. After landing in [[Daiquiri]] on 23 June 1898, the Rough Riders quickly marched past the 1st Infantry Division commanded by Lawton and got to Siboney, Cuba on the late afternoon of 24 June. With Shafter still at sea, Wheeler as senior general, was in command of ground forces. Not willing to be put on the march toward Santiago de Cuba behind the Infantry and hearing of Spaniards dug in at [[Battle of Las Guasimas|Las Guasimas]], Cuba, without waiting for a change of orders from Schafter who said that the Cavalry Division was supposed to trail behind the infantry and that no one was to move forward until all soldiers had landed, after a conference with Cuban General, [[Calixto García]]. Hearing from Garcia, that Cuban [[insurrectos]] had clashed with the Spaniards left and right flanks that straddled the [[Camino Real]] road that went from Siboney to Santiago de Cuba, Wheeler was told that there were two largely parallel roads from the beaches of Siboney to Las Guasimas. Wheeler decided in a secret meeting with his brigade commanders late on 24 June that the following morning, 25 June 1898, that he would send elements of the 1st and 10th Regular Cavalry on the lower road northwest and the 1st Volunteers, &quot;Rough Riders,&quot; commanded by Wood and Roosevelt and future Arizona territorial governor, [[Alexander Brodie]] as his two squadron commanders on the parallel road running along a ridge up from the beach. To throw off his infantry rival, Wheeler would leave one regiment of his Cavalry Division, the 9th, at Siboney so that he could claim that his move north was only a limited reconnaissance if things went wrong.

====Las Guasimas====
The Rough Riders met the Spaniards on the left trail (hardly more than a bridle path)just after the Regulars came within canon fire distance of the Spaniards on the parallel Camino Real to their east. The ensuing fight was to be known as the [[Battle of Las Guasimas]]. While seen by some as a minor skirmish it was the first test of the new volunteer cavalry regiment under fire. The Rough Riders handled themselves fairly well and even though the Spaniards lines initially ran almost in an upside-down &quot;U&quot; shape around them, they fought their way through Spanish resistance and together with the Regulars forced the Spaniards to abandon their positions earlier than previously planned.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Rough Riders&quot;&gt;Roosevelt, Theodore (1898). [http://www.bartleby.com/51/ ''The Rough Riders''], Chapter III, p. 2. Bartleby.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

====San Juan Hill====
Originally, Roosevelt held the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant Colonel]] and served under Colonel Wood. In Roosevelt's own account, ''The Rough Riders'', &quot;after General Young was struck down with the fever, Wood took charge of the brigade. This left me in command of the regiment, of which I was very glad, for such experience as we had had is a quick teacher.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Rough Riders&quot;&gt;Roosevelt, Theodore (1898). [http://www.bartleby.com/51/ ''The Rough Riders''], Chapter III, p. 52. Bartleby.com.&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, Wood was promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] of Volunteer Forces, and Roosevelt was promoted to Colonel and given command of the Regiment.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Rough Riders&quot;/&gt;

[[File:TR San Juan Hill 1898.jpg|thumb|left|Colonel Roosevelt and the [[Rough Riders]] after capturing San Juan Hill]]

Under his leadership, the Rough Riders became famous for dual charges up [[Kettle Hill]] and [[Battle of San Juan Hill|San Juan Hill]] on July 1, 1898 (the battle was named after the latter &quot;hill,&quot; which was the shoulder of a ridge known as San Juan Heights). Out of all the Rough Riders, Roosevelt was the only one with a horse, as the troopers' horses had been left behind because transport ships were scarce.  He rode back and forth between rifle pits at the forefront of the advance up Kettle Hill, an advance that he urged in absence of any orders from superiors. He was forced to walk up the last part of Kettle Hill on foot, because of barbed wire entanglement and after his horse, Little Texas, tired.

For his actions, Roosevelt was nominated for the [[Medal of Honor]], which was later disapproved. As historian [[John Gable]] wrote, &quot;In later years Roosevelt would describe the Battle of San Juan Hill on July 1, 1898, as 'the great day of my life' and 'my crowded hour.'.... (but) Malaria and other diseases now killed more troops than had died in battle. In August, Roosevelt and other officers demanded that the soldiers be returned home.&quot;
[[File:cmoh army.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Medal of Honor]]]]
In 2001, Roosevelt was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions. He was the first and, to date, is the only President of the United States to be awarded America's highest military honor, and the only person in history to receive both his nation's highest honor for military valor and the world's foremost prize for peace.&lt;ref name=MedalofHonor&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=October 25, 2007

They are the second of only two fathers and sons to earn the Medal of Honor, the first being [[Arthur MacArthur, Jr.]] and his son [[Douglas MacArthur|Douglas]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2012}}

After return to civilian life, Roosevelt preferred to be known as &quot;Colonel Roosevelt&quot; or &quot;The Colonel.&quot; As a moniker, &quot;Teddy&quot; remained much more popular with the public, despite the fact he found it vulgar and called it &quot;an outrageous impertinence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Matuz, R.: &quot;The Presidents Fact Book&quot;, page 402. Black Dog and Leventhal Publishers, Inc., 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Political friends and others working closely with Roosevelt customarily addressed him by his rank.

===Governor and Vice-President===
On leaving the Army, Roosevelt was elected governor of New York in [[New York state election, 1898|1898]] as a Republican. He made such an effort to root out corruption and &quot;[[machine politics]]&quot; that Republican boss [[Thomas C. Platt|Thomas Collier Platt]] forced him on McKinley as a running mate in [[United States presidential election, 1900|the 1900 election]], against the wishes of McKinley's manager, Senator [[Mark Hanna]]. Roosevelt was a powerful campaign asset for the Republican ticket, which defeated [[William Jennings Bryan]] in a landslide based on restoration of prosperity at home and a successful war and new prestige abroad. Bryan stumped for [[Free Silver]] again, but McKinley's promise of prosperity through the [[gold standard]], high tariffs, and the restoration of business confidence enlarged his margin of victory. Bryan had strongly supported the war against Spain, but denounced the annexation of the [[Philippines]] as imperialism that would spoil America's innocence. Roosevelt countered with many speeches that argued it was best for the Filipinos to have stability, and the Americans to have a proud place in the world. Roosevelt's six months as Vice President (March to September 1901) were uneventful.&lt;ref&gt;Brands ch 14–15&lt;/ref&gt; On September 2, 1901, at the [[Minnesota State Fair]], Roosevelt first used in a public speech a saying that would later be universally associated with him: &quot;[[Big Stick ideology|Speak softly and carry a big stick, and you will go far.&quot;]]

==Presidency 1901–1909==
{{Main|Presidency of Theodore Roosevelt}}

[[File:Roosevelt-Fairbanks.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Roosevelt and Vice President Fairbanks.]]
On September 6, President McKinley was shot while at the [[Pan-American Exposition]] in [[Buffalo, New York]]. Initial reports in the succeeding days suggested his condition was improving, so Roosevelt embarked on a vacation at [[Mount Marcy]] in northeastern New York. He was returning from a climb to the summit on September 13 when a park ranger brought him a telegram informing him that McKinley's condition had deteriorated, and he was near death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Roosevelt's Correspondence on McKinley's Assassination|url=http://www.shapell.org/btl.aspx?2354473|work=Theodore Roosevelt's Original Letters: Primary Sources|publisher=Shapell Manuscript Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt and his family immediately departed for Buffalo. When they reached the nearest train station at [[North Creek, New York|North Creek]], at 5:22&amp;nbsp;am on September 14, he received another telegram informing him that McKinley had died a few hours earlier. Roosevelt arrived in Buffalo that afternoon, and was sworn in there as President at 3:30&amp;nbsp;pm by U.S. District Judge [[John R. Hazel]] at the [[Theodore Roosevelt Inaugural National Historic Site|Ansley Wilcox House]].

Roosevelt kept McKinley's Cabinet and promised to continue McKinley's policies. One of his first notable acts as president was to deliver a 20,000-word address to Congress&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theodore-roosevelt.com/sotu1.html |title=Theodore Roosevelt website |publisher=Theodore-roosevelt.com |date=June 7, 1910 |accessdate=September 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; asking it to curb the power of large [[corporation]]s (called &quot;trusts&quot;). For his aggressive attacks on trusts over his two terms, he has been called a &quot;trust-buster.&quot;

In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1904|1904 presidential election]], Roosevelt won the presidency in his own right in a landslide victory. His vice president was [[Charles Fairbanks]].

Roosevelt also dealt with union workers. In May 1902, [[United Mine Workers]] went on strike to get higher pay wages and shorter workdays. He set up a fact-finding commission that stopped the strike, and resulted in the workers getting more pay for fewer hours.

In August 1902, Roosevelt was the first president to be seen riding in an automobile in public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deadpresidentsdaily.blogspot.com/2007/08/august-22-1902-first-presidential.html The First Presidential Motorcade], August 22, 1902 (includes photo)&lt;/ref&gt; This took place in Hartford, CT. The car was a Columbia Electric Victoria Phaeton, manufactured in Hartford. The police squad rode bicycles alongside the car. (The reference includes a photo of the event.)

In 1905, he issued a corollary to the [[Monroe Doctrine]], which allows the United States to &quot;exercise international policy power&quot; so they can intervene and keep smaller countries on their feet.

[[File:Theodore Roosevelt 1925 Issue-5c.jpg|thumb|left|180px|[[US Presidents on US postage stamps|&lt;center&gt;The 1st Roosevelt stamp&lt;br /&gt;Issue of 1925&lt;/center&gt;]]]]

Roosevelt helped the wellbeing of people by passing laws such as The [[Meat Inspection Act]] of 1906 and The [[Pure Food and Drug Act]]. The Meat Inspection Act of 1906 banned misleading labels and preservatives that contained harmful chemicals. The Pure Food and Drug Act banned food and drugs that are impure or falsely labeled from being made, sold, and shipped.  Roosevelt was also served as honorary president of the school health organization [[American School Hygiene Association]] from 1907 to 1908, and in 1909 he convened the first [[White House]] Conference on the Care of Dependent Children.&lt;ref name = &quot;ProgHealth21&quot;&gt;{{cite book

The [[Gentlemen's Agreement of 1907|Gentlemen's Agreement]] with Japan came into play in 1907, banning all school segregation of Japanese, yet controlling Japanese immigration in California. That year, Roosevelt signed the proclamation establishing [[Oklahoma]] as the 46th state of the Union.

Building on McKinley's effective use of the press, Roosevelt made the [[White House]] the center of news every day, providing interviews and photo opportunities. After noticing the White House reporters huddled outside in the rain one day, he gave them their own room inside, effectively inventing the presidential press briefing.&lt;ref name=&quot;american chronicle&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

He chose not to run for another term in [[United States presidential election, 1908|1908]], and supported [[William Howard Taft|William Taft]] for the presidency, instead of Fairbanks. Fairbanks withdrew from the race, and would later support Taft for re-election against Roosevelt in the [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912 election]].

Roosevelt appointed a record 75 federal judges. Roosevelt appointed three Justices to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]: [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.]] (1902), [[William Rufus Day]] (1903), [[William Henry Moody]] (1906). In addition to these three, Roosevelt appointed 19 judges to the [[United States Courts of Appeals]], and 53 judges to the [[United States district courts]].

===African safari===
In March 1909, shortly after the end of his presidency, Roosevelt left New York for a [[safari]] in [[East Africa|east]] and [[central Africa]]. Roosevelt's party landed in [[Mombasa]], [[British East Africa]] (now [[Kenya]]), traveled to the [[Belgian Congo]] (now [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]) before following the [[Nile]] to [[Khartoum]] in modern [[Sudan]]. Financed by [[Andrew Carnegie]] and by his own proposed writings, Roosevelt's party hunted for specimens for the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and for the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York.&lt;ref name=SIA&gt;{{cite web|title=Roosevelt African Expedition Collects for SI|url=http://siarchives.si.edu/collections/siris_sic_193|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution Archives]]|accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group, led by the legendary hunter-tracker [[R. J. Cunninghame]], included scientists from the Smithsonian and was joined from time to time by [[Frederick Selous]], the famous big game hunter and explorer. Among other items, Roosevelt brought with him four tons of salt for preserving animal hides, a lucky rabbit's foot given to him by boxer [[John L. Sullivan]], a [[Holland and Holland]] double rifle in [[.500/450 Nitro Express|.500/450]] donated by a group of 56 admiring Britons, a [[Winchester 1895]] rifle in [[.405 Winchester]], an Army ([[M1903 Springfield|M1903]]) Springfield in [[.30-06 Springfield|.30-06]] caliber stocked and sighted for him, a Fox No. 12 shotgun, and the famous Pigskin Library, a collection of classics bound in pig leather and transported in a single reinforced trunk.

Roosevelt and his companions killed or trapped approximately 11,400&lt;ref name=SIA/&gt; animals, from [[insect]]s and [[Mole (animal)|moles]] to [[hippopotamus]]es and [[elephant]]s. These included 512 big game animals, including six rare [[White Rhinoceros|white rhinos]]. The expedition consumed 262 of the animals. Tons of salted animals and their skins were shipped to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]; the quantity was so large that it took years to [[taxidermy|mount]] them all, and the Smithsonian shared many duplicate animals with other [[museum]]s. Regarding the large number of animals taken, Roosevelt said, &quot;I can be condemned only if the existence of the [[National Museum of Natural History|National Museum]], the [[American Museum of Natural History]], and all similar zoological institutions are to be condemned.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;O'Toole, Patricia (2005) ''When Trumpets Call'', p. 67, Simon and Schuster, ISBN 0-684-86477-0&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the safari was ostensibly conducted in the name of [[science]], it was as much a political and social event as it was a hunting excursion; Roosevelt interacted with renowned professional hunters and land-owning families, and met many native peoples and local leaders. Roosevelt became a Life Member of the [[National Rifle Association]], while President, in 1907 after paying a $25 fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=From my cold, dead hands: Charlton Heston and American politics|first=Emilie|last=Raymond|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|year=2006|page=246|isbn=978-0-8131-2408-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later wrote a detailed account in the book ''African Game Trails'', where he describes the excitement of the chase, the people he met, and the [[flora]] and [[fauna]] he collected in the name of science.

===Republican Party schism===

Roosevelt certified [[William Howard Taft]] to be a genuine &quot;progressive&quot; in [[U.S. presidential election, 1908|1908]], when Roosevelt pushed through the nomination of his Secretary of War for the Presidency. Taft easily defeated three-time candidate [[William Jennings Bryan]]. Taft promoted a different progressivism, one that stressed the rule of law and preferred that judges rather than administrators or politicians make the basic decisions about fairness. Taft usually proved a less adroit politician than Roosevelt and lacked the energy and personal magnetism, not to mention the publicity devices, the dedicated supporters, and the broad base of public support that made Roosevelt so formidable. When Roosevelt realized that lowering the tariff would risk severe tensions inside the Republican Party—pitting producers (manufacturers and farmers) against merchants and consumers—he stopped talking about the issue. Taft ignored the risks and tackled the tariff boldly, on the one hand encouraging reformers to fight for lower rates, and then cutting deals with conservative leaders that kept overall rates high. The resulting [[Payne-Aldrich tariff]] of 1909 was too high for most reformers, but instead of blaming this on Senator [[Nelson Aldrich]] and big business, Taft took credit, calling it the best tariff ever. He again had managed to alienate all sides. While the crisis was building inside the Party, Roosevelt was touring Africa and Europe, to allow Taft to be his own man.&lt;ref&gt;Thayer, Chapter XXI, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TAFT1909.JPG|thumb|1909 cartoon: TR hands his policies to the care of Taft while [[William Loeb, Jr.]] carries the &quot;Big Stick&quot;]]
[[File:For Auld Lang Syne - Leonard Raven-Hill.jpg|thumb|The battle between [[William Howard Taft|Taft]] and Roosevelt bitterly split the Republican Party; Taft's people dominated the party until 1936.]]

Unlike Roosevelt, Taft never attacked business or businessmen in his rhetoric. However, he was attentive to the law, so he launched 90 antitrust suits, including one against the largest corporation, U.S. Steel, for an acquisition that Roosevelt had personally approved. Consequently, Taft lost the support of antitrust reformers (who disliked his conservative rhetoric), of big business (which disliked his actions), and of Roosevelt, who felt humiliated by his protégé. The left wing of the Republican Party began agitating against Taft. Senator [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.|Robert LaFollette]] of [[Wisconsin]] created the National Progressive Republican League (precursor to the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1924)]]) to defeat the power of political bossism at the state level and to replace Taft at the national level. More trouble came when Taft fired [[Gifford Pinchot]], a leading conservationist and close ally of Roosevelt. Pinchot alleged that Taft's Secretary of Interior [[Richard Ballinger]] was in league with big timber interests. Conservationists sided with Pinchot, and Taft alienated yet another vocal constituency.

[[File:Kaiser Wilhelm II und Theodore Roosevelt.jpg|thumb|Theodore Roosevelt (center) and his son at a military parade near Berlin with German [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II]] (May, 1910)]]

Roosevelt, back from Europe, unexpectedly launched an attack on the courts. His famous speech at Osawatomie, Kansas, in August 1910 was the most radical of his career and openly marked his break with the Taft administration and the conservative Republicans. Osawatomie was well known as the base used by [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] when he launched his bloody attacks on slavery. Taft was deeply upset. Roosevelt was attacking both the judiciary and the deep faith Republicans had in their judges (most of whom had been appointed by McKinley, Roosevelt or Taft). In the 1910 Congressional elections, Democrats swept to power, and Taft's reelection in 1912 was increasingly in doubt. In 1911, Taft responded with a vigorous stumping tour that allowed him to sign up most of the party leaders long before Roosevelt announced.

===Election of 1912===
{{Main|U.S. presidential election, 1912|Progressive Party (United States, 1912)}}

====Republican primaries====
Despite his new doubts about Taft's leadership abilities, Roosevelt still was friendly towards him&lt;ref name=gloriousr /&gt; and was in favor of his re-election. On October 27, 1911, however, Roosevelt and Taft's deteriorating friendship officially came to an end when Taft's administration filed an antitrust suit against US Steel,&lt;ref name=gloriousr /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Taft, Roosevelt, and the Limits of Friendship |last=Burton |first=David Henry |year=2004 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press |pages=92, 141–142 |isbn=978-0-8386-4042-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; which Roosevelt labeled as a &quot;good trust&quot;. After he finally broke with Taft, Roosevelt saw himself as the only person who could save the Republican party from defeat in the upcoming Presidential election and announced himself as a candidate for the Republican nomination.&lt;ref name=gloriousr&gt;{{cite book |title=The Glorious Burden: The American Presidency |last=Lorant |first=Stefan |year=1968 |page=512 |publisher=New York, Harper and Row |isbn=0-06-012686-8 9780060126865}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt, however, had delayed too long, and Taft had already won the support of most party leaders in the country. Because of LaFollette's nervous breakdown on the campaign trail before Roosevelt's entry, most of LaFollette's supporters went over to Roosevelt, the new progressive Republican candidate.

Roosevelt, stepping up his attack on judges, carried nine of the states that held preferential primaries, LaFollette took two, and Taft only one. The 1912 primaries represented the first extensive use of the [[United States presidential primary|presidential primary]], a reform achievement of the progressive movement. However, these primary elections, while demonstrating Roosevelt's continuing popularity with the electorate, were not nearly as pivotal as primaries became later in the century. There were fewer states where a common voter had an opportunity to express a recorded preference. Many more states selected convention delegates at state party conventions, or in caucuses, which were not as open as they later became. While Roosevelt was popular with the public, most Republican politicians and party leaders supported Taft, and their support proved difficult to counter in states without primaries.

====Formation of the Bull Moose Party====
At the [[Republican Convention]] in [[Chicago]], despite being the incumbent, Taft's victory was not immediately assured. After two weeks, Roosevelt, realizing he would not win the nomination outright, asked his followers to leave the convention hall. They moved to the [[Auditorium Building, Chicago|Auditorium Theatre]], and then Roosevelt, along with key allies such as [[Pinchot]] and [[Albert Beveridge]] created the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]], structuring it as a permanent organization that would field complete tickets at the presidential and state level. It was popularly known as the &quot;[[Bull Moose Party]]&quot;, which got its name after Roosevelt told reporters, &quot;I'm as fit as a bull moose.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carl M. Cannon, ''The Pursuit of Happiness in Times of War'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield: 2003, p. 142. ISBN 0-7425-2592-9.&lt;/ref&gt; At the convention Roosevelt cried out, &quot;We stand at [[Armageddon]] and we battle for the Lord.&quot; Roosevelt's platform echoed his 1907–08 proposals, calling for vigorous government intervention to protect the people from the selfish interests.&lt;ref&gt;Thayer, Chapter XXII, pp. 25–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assassination attempt====
[[File:TR Assissination Bullet Damage.jpg|thumb|left|The bullet-damaged speech and eyeglass case on display at the Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace]]
[[File:TR-Xray.jpg|thumb|X-Ray of Roosevelt's ribcage showing the bullet at lower left]]
While Roosevelt was campaigning in [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]], on October 14, 1912, a saloonkeeper named [[John Schrank]] shot him, but the bullet lodged in his chest only after penetrating his steel eyeglass case and passing through a thick (50 pages) single-folded copy of the speech he was carrying in his jacket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wisconsinhistory.org/museum/artifacts/archives/001692.asp |title=Wisconsin Historical Society |publisher=Wisconsinhistory.org |date= |accessdate=September 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt, as an experienced hunter and anatomist, correctly concluded that since he was not coughing blood, the bullet had not completely penetrated the chest wall to his lung, and so declined suggestions he go to the hospital immediately. Instead, he delivered his scheduled speech with blood seeping into his shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorzebra.com/prez/z_x26a_g.htm |title=Medical History of American Presidents |publisher=Doctorzebra.com |date= |accessdate=September 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spoke for 90 minutes. His opening comments to the gathered crowd were, &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, I don't know whether you fully understand that [[s:I have just been shot|I have just been shot]]; but it takes more than that to kill a Bull Moose.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historybuff.com/library/refteddy.html Excerpt from the [[Detroit Free Press]], at Historybuff.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, probes and x-ray showed that the bullet had traversed three inches (76&amp;nbsp;mm) of tissue and lodged in Roosevelt's chest muscle but did not penetrate the [[pleura]], and it would be more dangerous to attempt to remove the bullet than to leave it in place. Roosevelt carried it with him for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/life/timeline.htm |title=Roosevelt Timeline |publisher=Theodoreroosevelt.org |date= |accessdate=September 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the bullet wound, Roosevelt was taken off the campaign trail in the final weeks of the race (which ended election day, November 5). Though the other two campaigners stopped their own campaigns in the week Roosevelt was in the hospital, they resumed it once he was released. The bullet lodged in his chest caused his [[rheumatoid arthritis|chronic rheumatoid arthritis]] – which he had suffered from for years&lt;ref name=oimjjac /&gt; – to get worse and it soon prevented him from doing his daily stint of exercises;&lt;ref name=oimjjac /&gt; Roosevelt would soon become obese as well.&lt;ref name=oimjjac /&gt;  Roosevelt, for many reasons, failed to move enough Republicans in his direction. He did win 4.1&amp;nbsp;million votes (27%), compared to Taft's 3.5&amp;nbsp;million (23%). However, Wilson's 6.3&amp;nbsp;million votes (42%) were enough to garner 435 electoral votes. Roosevelt had 88 electoral votes to Taft's 8 electoral votes. This meant that Taft became the only incumbent president to place third in a re-election bid. But [[Pennsylvania]] was Roosevelt's only [[Eastern United States|eastern]] state; in the [[Midwest]], he carried [[Michigan]], [[Minnesota]] and [[South Dakota]]; in the [[Western United States|West]], [[California]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]; he did not win any southern states.

===1913–1914 South American Expedition===
Roosevelt's popular book ''Through the Brazilian Wilderness''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.s4ulanguages.com/theodore.html S4ulanguages.com], Facsimile of the first edition (1914)&lt;/ref&gt; describes his expedition into the [[Brazil]]ian jungle in 1913 as a member of the [[Roosevelt-Rondon Scientific Expedition]], co-named after its leader, [[Brazil]]ian explorer [[Cândido Rondon]]. The book describes the scientific discovery, scenic tropical vistas, and exotic flora and fauna experienced during the adventure. A friend, Father [[John Augustine Zahm]], had searched for new adventures and found them in the forests of South America. After a briefing of several of his own expeditions, he persuaded Roosevelt to commit to such an expedition in 1912. To finance the expedition Roosevelt received support from the [[American Museum of Natural History]], promising to bring back many new animal specimens.

[[File:River-doubt-team.jpg|left|thumb|The initial party.

Only Roosevelt, Kermit, Cherrie, Rondon and the Brazilians traveled down the River of Doubt.]]

Once in South America, a new far more ambitious goal was added: to find the headwaters of the Rio da Duvida, the [[River of Doubt]], and trace it north to the Madeira and thence to the [[Amazon River]]. It was later renamed [[Roosevelt River]] in honor of the former President. Roosevelt's crew consisted of his 24-year-old son Kermit, Colonel Rondon, a naturalist, George K. Cherrie, sent by the [[American Museum of Natural History]], Brazilian Lieutenant Joao Lyra, team physician Dr. José Antonio Cajazeira, and 16 skilled paddlers and porters (called camaradas in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]). The initial expedition started, probably unwisely, on December 9, 1913, at the height of the rainy season. The trip down the River of Doubt started on February 27, 1914.

During the trip down the river, Roosevelt suffered a minor leg wound after he jumped into the river to try to prevent two of his crew's canoes from smashing against the rocks.&lt;ref name=oimjjac&gt;{{cite web|author=Rudolph Marx M.D. |url=http://www.healthguidance.org/entry/8931/1/The-Health-Of-The-President-Theodore-Roosevelt.html |title=The Health Of The President: Theodore Roosevelt |publisher=Healthguidance.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jkmciuewrq /&gt;  The flesh wound he received, however, soon gave him [[tropical fever]] that resembled the [[malaria]] he contracted while in Cuba fifteen years before.&lt;ref name=oimjjac /&gt;&lt;ref name=jkmciuewrq /&gt;  Because the bullet lodged in his chest from the failed assassination attempt in 1912 was never removed, his health worsened from the infection.&lt;ref name=jkmciuewrq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/life/nytobit.htm |title=NY Times Obituary of Theodore Roosevelt |publisher=Theodoreroosevelt.org |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This weakened Roosevelt so greatly that six weeks into the adventure he had to be attended day and night by the expedition's physician and his son, Kermit. By then he could not walk because of both the infection in his injured leg and an infirmity in his other from a traffic accident a decade earlier. Roosevelt was riddled with chest pains, fighting a fever that soared to 103&amp;nbsp;°F (39&amp;nbsp;°C), and at times so delirious that he would repeat endlessly the opening line from Coleridge's poem [[Kubla Khan]].&lt;ref&gt;Millard, Candice. The River of Doubt. Broadway Books, New York. 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding his condition as a threat to the survival of the others, Roosevelt insisted he be left behind to allow the by then poorly provisioned expedition to proceed as rapidly as it could. Only an appeal by his son persuaded him to continue.

Despite Roosevelt's continued decline and loss of over 50 pounds (20&amp;nbsp;kg) of his original 220, Commander Rondon had been repeatedly slowing down the pace of the expedition in dedication to his commission's mapmaking and other geographical goals that demanded regular stops to fix the expedition's position by sun-based survey.

Upon Roosevelt's return to New York, friends and family were startled by his physical appearance and fatigue. Roosevelt wrote to a friend that the trip had cut his life short by ten years. He might not have known just how accurate that analysis would prove. For the rest of his few remaining years he would be plagued by flare-ups of malaria and leg inflammations so severe that they would require surgery.&lt;ref name=&quot;lion&quot;&gt;Hanson, David C. (2005). [http://www.vw.vccs.edu/vwhansd/HIS122/Teddy/TR_Lion.html &quot;Theodore Roosevelt: Lion in the White House&quot;]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}. Retrieved March 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thayer, Chapter XXIII, pp. 4–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Roosevelt had even completed his sea voyage home, doubts were raised over his claims of exploring and navigating a completely uncharted river over 625 miles (1,000&amp;nbsp;km) long. When he had recovered sufficiently he addressed a standing-room-only convention organized in Washington, D.C. by the [[National Geographic Society]] and satisfactorily defended his claims. The River of Doubt later was named the [[Rio Roosevelt]].

==World War I==

{{main|American entry into World War I}}
{{See also|Roosevelt's World War I volunteers}}
When [[World War I]] began in 1914, Roosevelt strongly supported the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] and demanded a harsher policy against [[German Empire|Germany]], especially regarding submarine warfare. Roosevelt angrily denounced the foreign policy of [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]], calling it a failure regarding the atrocities in Belgium and the violations of American rights.&lt;ref&gt;Brands, 749-51, 806-9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1916, he campaigned energetically for [[Charles Evans Hughes]] and repeatedly denounced Irish-Americans and German-Americans who Roosevelt said were unpatriotic because they put the interest of Ireland and Germany ahead of America's by supporting neutrality. He insisted one had to be 100% American, not a &quot;[[hyphenated American]]&quot; who juggled multiple loyalties. When the U.S. entered the war in 1917, Roosevelt sought to raise a volunteer infantry division, but Wilson refused.&lt;ref&gt;Brands 781–4; Cramer, C.H. ''Newton D. Baker'' (1961) 110–113&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt's attacks on Wilson helped the Republicans win control of Congress in the off-year elections of 1918. Roosevelt was popular enough to seriously contest the 1920 Republican nomination, but his health was broken by 1918, because of the lingering [[malaria]]. His family and supporters threw their support to Roosevelt's old military companion, General [[Leonard Wood]], who was ultimately defeated by Taft supporter [[Warren G. Harding]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Pietrusza|Pietrusza, David]]. ''1920: The Year of the Six Presidents'' (2007). pp. 55–71 (on Roosevelt's prospective candidacy), 167–175 (on Wood and his support by TR's family)&lt;/ref&gt;

His son [[Quentin Roosevelt|Quentin]], a daring pilot with the American forces in France, was shot down behind German lines in 1918. Quentin was his youngest son and probably his favorite. It is said the death of his son distressed him so much that Roosevelt never recovered from his loss.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dalton, 2002 p. 507&quot;&gt;Dalton, (2002) p. 507&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Despite his rapidly declining health, Roosevelt remained active to the end of his life. He was an enthusiastic proponent of the [[Scouting]] movement. The [[Boy Scouts of America]] gave him the title of '''Chief Scout Citizen''', the only person to hold such title. One early Scout leader said, &quot;The two things that gave Scouting great impetus and made it very popular were the uniform and Teddy Roosevelt's [[jingoism]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Larson, Keith (2006). [http://www.sossi.org/scouters/roosevelt.htm &quot;Theodore Roosevelt&quot;]. Retrieved March 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 6, 1919, Roosevelt died in his sleep at [[Oyster Bay (hamlet), New York|Oyster Bay]] of a [[coronary thrombosis]] (heart attack), preceded by a 2½-month illness described as inflammatory [[rheumatism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Political positions and speeches==
{{wikisource author|Theodore Roosevelt}}
{{Main|Political positions of Theodore Roosevelt}}

Theodore Roosevelt introduced the phrase &quot;[[Square Deal]]&quot; to describe his progressive views in a [[Political positions of Theodore Roosevelt#Square Deal|speech]] delivered after leaving the office of the Presidency in August 1910. In his broad outline, he stressed equality of opportunity for all citizens and emphasized the importance of fair government regulations of corporate 'special interests'.

Roosevelt was one of the first Presidents to make [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] a national issue. In a [[Political positions of Theodore Roosevelt#Conservationist|speech]] that Roosevelt gave at Osawatomie, Kansas, on August 31, 1910, he outlined his views on conservation of the lands of the United States. He favored using America's natural resources, but opposed wasteful consumption.&lt;ref name=&quot;TR: Conservation&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title= Theodore Roosevelt: An American Mind|last= DiNunzio|first= Mario|authorlink= Mario R.

Roosevelt was instrumental in conserving about {{convert|230|e6acre|km2}} of American soil among various parks and other federal projects.&lt;ref name=TRAssn&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theodoreroosevelt.org/life/conservation.htm |title=Conservationist Theodore Roosevelt |date = November 2005|publisher=Theodore Roosevelt Association |accessdate=February 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Eighth Annual [[Political positions of Theodore Roosevelt#Corporate Regulations|Message to Congress]] (1908), Roosevelt mentioned the need for federal government to regulate interstate corporations using the Interstate Commerce Clause, also mentioning how these corporations fought federal control by appealing to states' rights.

===Positions on immigration, minorities, and civil rights===
In an 1894 article on immigration, Roosevelt said, &quot;We must Americanize in every way, in speech, in political ideas and principles, and in their way of looking at relations between church and state. We welcome the German and the Irishman who becomes an American. We have no use for the German or Irishman who remains such...

Roosevelt was the first president to appoint a representative of the Jewish minority to a cabinet position – Secretary of Commerce and Labor, [[Oscar Straus (politician)|Oscar S. Straus]], 1906–09.

In 1886 he said: &quot;I don't go so far as to think that the only good Indians are dead Indians, but I believe nine out of ten are, and I shouldn't like to inquire too closely into the case of the tenth.&quot; He later became much more favorable.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, ''Rise of Theodore Roosevelt,'' p. 826 and ch. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dyer&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title= Theodore Roosevelt and the Idea of Race|last= Dyer|first= Thomas|authorlink= Thomas G.

About African Americans, Roosevelt said, &quot;I have not been able to think out any solution of the terrible problem offered by the presence of the Negro on this continent, but of one thing I am sure, and that is that inasmuch as he is here and can neither be killed nor driven away, the only wise and honorable and Christian thing to do is to treat each black man and each white man strictly on his merits as a man, giving him no more and no less than he shows himself worthy to have.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RonAM&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title= Theodore Roosevelt on Race, Riots, Reds, Crime|last= Roosevelt|first= Theodore|coauthors=ed. by Archibald Roosevelt |year= 1968|publisher= Probe|isbn= |page= 13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting the European conquest of North America with that of Australia, Roosevelt wrote: &quot;The natives [of Australia] were so few in number and of such a low type, that they practically offered no resistance at all, being but little more hindrance than an equal number of ferocious beasts&quot;;&lt;ref name = &quot;west 1 p14&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Roosevelt |first= Theodore |year= 1889 |title= The Winning of the West: Volume I |location= New York and London |publisher= G.&amp;nbsp;P.&amp;nbsp;Putnam's Sons |page= [http://archive.org/stream/winningwest16roosgoog#page/n34/mode/2up 14] }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the Native Americans were &quot;the most formidable savage foes ever faced ever encountered by colonists of European stock.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;west 1 p17&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= The Winning of the West: Volume I |page= [http://archive.org/stream/winningwest16roosgoog#page/n34/mode/2up 17] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He regarded slavery as &quot;a crime whose shortsighted folly was worse than its guilt&quot; because it &quot;brought hordes of African slaves, whose descendants now form immense populations in certain portions of the land.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;west 1 p8&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= The Winning of the West: Volume I |page= [http://archive.org/stream/winningwest16roosgoog#page/n34/mode/2up 8] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrasting the European conquest of North America with that of South Africa, Roosevelt felt that the fate of the latter's colonists would be different because, unlike the Native American, the African &quot;neither dies out nor recedes before their advance&quot;, meaning the colonists would likely &quot;be swallowed up in the overwhelming mass of black barbarism.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;west 1 pp15-16&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= The Winning of the West: Volume I |pages= [http://archive.org/stream/winningwest16roosgoog#page/n34/mode/2up 15–6]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1907 [[eugenicists]] in many States started the forced sterilization of the sick, unemployed, poor, criminals, prostitutes, and the disabled. Roosevelt said in 1914: &quot;I wish very much that the wrong people could be prevented entirely from breeding; and when the evil nature of these people is sufficiently flagrant, this should be done. Criminals should be sterilized and feeble-minded persons forbidden to leave offspring behind them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RonEugenics&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title= Theodore Roosevelt on Race, Riots, Reds, Crime|last= Roosevelt|first= Theodore|year= 1968|publisher= Probe|isbn= |page= 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt was a prolific author, writing with passion on subjects ranging from foreign policy to the importance of the national park system. Roosevelt was also an avid reader of [[poetry]]. American poet, [[Robert Frost]] said of TR, &quot;He was our kind. He quoted poetry to me. He knew poetry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.igougo.com/review-r1150273-Light_gone_out_-_TR_at_the_Library_of_Congress.html#ixzz1D3PWjMug |title=&quot;Light gone out&quot; – TR at the Library of Congress – Jefferson's Legacy: The Library of Congress Review – IgoUgo |publisher=Igougo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an editor of ''Outlook'' magazine, he had weekly access to a large, educated national audience. In all, Roosevelt wrote about 18 books (each in several editions), including his ''Autobiography'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Roosevelt | first = Theodore | title = An Autobiography | publisher = Echo Library | year = 2006 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=VZi1sGSjFfEC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Autobiography%2Broosevelt | isbn = 978-1-4068-0155-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Rough Riders''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Roosevelt | first = Theodore |title = The Rough Riders | publisher = The Review of Reviews Company | year = 1904 | location = New York | url = http://books.google.com/?id=jO4YAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Rough+Riders%2Broosevelt}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''History of the Naval War of 1812'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Roosevelt | first = Theodore |title = The Naval War of 1812 | publisher = G.P.

His most ambitious book was the four volume narrative ''The Winning of the West'', which connected the origin of a new &quot;race&quot; of Americans (i.e. what he considered the present population of the United States to be) to the frontier conditions their ancestors endured throughout the 17th, 18th, and early 19th centuries.

In 1907, Roosevelt became embroiled in a widely publicized literary debate known as the [[nature fakers controversy]]. A few years earlier, naturalist [[John Burroughs]] had published an article entitled &quot;Real and Sham Natural History&quot; in the ''Atlantic Monthly'', attacking popular writers of the day such as [[Ernest Thompson Seton]], [[Charles G. D. Roberts]] and [[William J. Long]] for their fantastical representations of wildlife. Roosevelt agreed with Burroughs' criticisms, and published several essays of his own denouncing the booming genre of &quot;naturalistic&quot; animal stories as &quot;yellow journalism of the woods&quot;. It was the President himself who popularized the negative term &quot;nature faker&quot; to describe writers who depicted their animal characters with excessive anthropomorphism.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, Gerald. February 1971. &quot;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/1971/2/1971_2_60.shtml T.R. and the 'nature fakers']{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&quot;. ''American Heritage Magazine''.

===Character and beliefs===
Roosevelt intensely disliked being called &quot;Teddy,&quot; and was quick to point out this fact to those who used the nickname, though it would become widely used by newspapers during his political career. He attended church regularly. Of including the motto &quot;In God We Trust&quot; on money, in 1907 he wrote, &quot;It seems to me eminently unwise to cheapen such a motto by use on coins, just as it would be to cheapen it by use on postage stamps, or in advertisements.&quot; He was also a member of the [[Freemasons]] and [[Sons of the American Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sar.org/About/Origins The Origins of the SAR]. Website accessed January 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt had a lifelong interest in pursuing what he called, in an 1899 speech, &quot;[[The Strenuous Life|the strenuous life]]&quot;. To this end, he exercised regularly and took up [[boxing]], [[tennis]], [[hiking]], [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]], [[polo]], and [[horseback riding]]. As governor of New York, he boxed with sparring partners several times a week, a practice he regularly continued as President until one blow detached his left [[retina]], leaving him blind in that eye (a fact not made public until many years later). Thereafter, he practiced [[judo]] attaining a third degree brown belt and continued his habit of [[skinny-dipping]] in the [[Potomac River]] during winter.&lt;ref&gt;Thayer, Chapter XVII, pp. 22–24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, K.B. &amp; Maiden, David (2006).

[[File:ROLES2.JPG|thumb|right|300px|1910 cartoon shows Roosevelt's multiple roles from 1899 to 1910]]

He was an enthusiastic [[singlestick]] player and, according to ''[[Harper's Weekly]]'', in 1905 showed up at a White House reception with his arm bandaged after a bout with General [[Leonard Wood]].&lt;ref&gt;Amberger, J Christoph, Secret History of the Sword Adventures in Ancient Martial Arts 1998, ISBN 1-892515-04-0.&lt;/ref&gt; Roosevelt was also an avid reader, reading tens of thousands of books, at a rate of several a day in multiple languages. Along with [[Thomas Jefferson]], Roosevelt is often considered the most well read of any [[American politician]].&lt;ref&gt;David H. Burton, ''The Learned Presidency'' 1988, p 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Historians credit Roosevelt for changing the nation's political system by permanently placing the presidency at center stage and making character as important as the issues. His notable accomplishments include trust busting and conservationism. However, he has been criticized for his interventionist and imperialist approach to nations he considered &quot;uncivilized&quot;. His friend, historian [[Henry Brooks Adams|Henry Adams]], proclaimed, &quot;Roosevelt, more than any other living man ....showed the singular primitive quality that belongs to ultimate matter{{spaced ndash}}the quality that mediaeval theology assigned to God{{spaced ndash}}he was pure act.&quot; Historians typically rank Roosevelt among the top five presidents.&lt;ref&gt;The Rector and Visitors of the University of Virginia (2005).

==Memorials==
Roosevelt was included with [[George Washington]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[Abraham Lincoln]] at the [[Mount Rushmore|Mount Rushmore Memorial]], designed in 1927 with the approval of Republican President [[Calvin Coolidge]].

For his gallantry at San Juan Hill, Roosevelt's commanders recommended him for the [[Medal of Honor]]. In the late 1990s, Roosevelt's supporters again took up the flag for him. On January 16, 2001, President [[Bill Clinton]] awarded Theodore Roosevelt the Medal of Honor posthumously for his charge up San Juan Hill, Cuba, during the Spanish–American War. Roosevelt's eldest son, Brigadier General [[Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.]], received the Medal of Honor for heroism at the [[Invasion of Normandy|Battle of Normandy]] in 1944. The Roosevelts thus became one of only two father-son pairs to receive this honor (the other pair being [[Arthur MacArthur, Jr.|Arthur]] and [[Douglas MacArthur]]).

[[File:MtRushmore TR close.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Roosevelt's face on [[Mount Rushmore]]]]

Roosevelt's legacy includes several other important commemorations. The [[United States Navy]] named two ships for Roosevelt: the {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|SSBN-600}}, a submarine that was in commission from 1961 to 1982; and the {{USS|Theodore Roosevelt|CVN-71}}, an aircraft carrier that has been on active duty in the Atlantic Fleet since 1986.

On November 18, 1956, the [[United States Postal Service]] released a 6¢ [[Liberty Issue]] postage stamp honoring Roosevelt.

The Roosevelt Memorial Association (now the [[Theodore Roosevelt Association]]) or &quot;TRA&quot;, was founded in 1920 to preserve Roosevelt's legacy. The Association preserved [[Theodore Roosevelt Birthplace National Historic Site|Roosevelt's birthplace]], &quot;[[Sagamore Hill]]&quot; home, papers, and video film. In 1941, it published the ''[[Theodore Roosevelt Cyclopedia]]'', a compendium of Roosevelt's key writings, sayings and conversations, which is available online.

Among the hundreds of schools and streets named in Roosevelt's honor are [[Roosevelt High School (Seattle)|Roosevelt High School]] in [[Seattle, Washington]], the surrounding [[Roosevelt, Seattle, Washington|Roosevelt neighborhood]], the district's main arterial, Roosevelt Way N.E., and Roosevelt Middle School in [[Eugene, Oregon]].

The [[Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel]] in Los Angeles is named after him, as is the [[Roosevelt Hotel (New York)|Roosevelt Hotel]] in New York City.

In Chicago, the city renamed 12th Street to [[Roosevelt Road]] four months after Roosevelt's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Scott | last = Broden | title = By The Numbers - Where Did Those Street Designations Come From? | date = 19 Feb 1995 | url = http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-19/features/9502190058_1_streets-presidents-chicago-historical-society | work = Chicago Tribune | accessdate = 2012-10-15 | archiveurl = http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:http%3A//articles.chicagotribune.com/1995-02-19/features/9502190058_1_streets-presidents-chicago-historical-society | archivedate = 15 Oct 2012 | quote = 12th Street was changed on May 25, 1919, in recognition of Theodore Roosevelt, who had died the previous January.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Philadelphia]], [[Roosevelt Boulevard (Philadelphia)|Roosevelt Boulevard]], also known as [[U.S. Route 1 in Pennsylvania|U.S. 1]], was named in his honor in 1918.

Roosevelt's 1901 saying &quot;[[Big Stick ideology|Speak Softly and Carry a Big Stick]]&quot; is still quoted by politicians and columnists in different countries—not only in English but also in translation to various other languages.

A quote from Roosevelt's 1912 Progressive Party platform was cited as an epigram by [[Julian Assange]], founder of [[WikiLeaks]], in his 2006 manifesto: &quot;Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government, owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility to the people. To destroy this invisible government, to dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;BuzzFlash, 2010 Dec. 2, [http://blog.buzzflash.com/node/12019 Theodore Roosevelt: &quot;Behind the Ostensible Government Sits Enthroned an Invisible Government]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The American Experience: The Presidents, [http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/presidents/26_t_roosevelt/psources/ps_trprogress.html &quot;Primary Sources, Theodore Roosevelt, 26th President: Platform of the Progressive Party August 7, 1912&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt's lasting popular legacy, however, is the stuffed toy bears—[[teddy bears]]—named after him following an incident on a hunting trip in Mississippi in 1902. Roosevelt famously ordered the mercy killing of a wounded [[American black bear|black bear]]. After the cartoonist [[Clifford K. Berryman]] illustrated the President with a bear, a toy maker heard the story and asked Roosevelt if he could use his name on a toy bear. Roosevelt approved, and the teddy bear was born. Bears and later bear cubs became closely associated with Roosevelt in political cartoons thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/od/tstartinventions/a/Teddy_Bear.htm &quot;History of the Teddy Bear&quot;].

On June 26, 2006, Roosevelt, again, made the cover of ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine with the lead story, &quot;The Making of America—Theodore Roosevelt—The 20th Century Express&quot;: &quot;At home and abroad, Theodore Roosevelt was the locomotive President, the man who drew his flourishing nation into the future.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;natfut&quot;&gt;{{cite news |year=2006 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1207820,00.html

In 1905, Roosevelt, an admirer of various western figures, named [[Captain Bill McDonald]] of the [[Texas Ranger Division|Texas Rangers]], as his bodyguard and entertained the legendary Texan in the [[White House]]. Ironically, in the 1912 campaign, McDonald was Woodrow Wilson's bodyguard. Wilson thereafter named the Democrat McDonald as [[U.S. Marshal]] for the Northern district of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/MM/fmc43.html|title=Harold J.

Roosevelt has been portrayed many times in film and on [[television]]. The [[actor]] [[Karl Swenson]] played him in the 1967 [[Western (genre)|western]] picture ''[[Brighty of the Grand Canyon]]'', the story of a real-life [[burro]] who guided Roosevelt on a hunting trip to find [[mountain lion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zunshine.com/swenson/intsteven.html|title=In Memory of Karl Swenson (1908–1978)|publisher=zunshine.com|accessdate=January 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Brian Keith]] portrayed Roosevelt in the 1975 film ''[[The Wind and the Lion]]'', a [[dramatization]] of the [[Perdicaris incident]] of 1904.

In the play [[Arsenic and Old Lace (play)|Arsenic and Old Lace]], and the [[Arsenic and Old Lace (film)|1944 film of the same name]], the character Teddy Brewster is convinced he's Roosevelt. He is enlisted in this role by his aunts to bury their victims' bodies in the cellar by asking him to dig &quot;another lock for the [[Panama Canal]]&quot;, then telling him someone has died of [[yellow fever]] and needs to be buried. When he runs up the stairs brandishing an imaginary sword and yelling &quot;Charge!&quot;, his aunt Abby Brewster explains to Officer Brophy, &quot;The stairs are always San Juan Hill&quot;. His bugle-blowing at all hours is the primary reason the aunts are being pressured to have him committed to a [[sanitarium]].

He was also portrayed by actor [[Tom Berenger]] in 1997 for the TNT movie ''[[Rough Riders (film)|Rough Riders]]'', a made-for-cable film about his exploits during the Spanish–American War in Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= ''Rough Riders'' | url= http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118453/ | work= TNT | publisher= Internet Movie Database | date= July 20, 1997 | accessdate=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robin Williams]] portrayed Roosevelt in the form of a wax [[mannequin]] that comes to life in ''[[Night at the Museum]]'' and its sequel ''[[Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian]]''.
[[File:Presidents-race-teddy-roosevelt.jpg|thumb|left|The Theodore Roosevelt mascot during a [[Washington Nationals]] home game.]]
Roosevelt was portrayed in several episodes of the comic book story ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'': the young [[Scrooge McDuck]] first meets Roosevelt in his Badlands years, later in a fictional siege of Fort Duckburg and finally in Panama during the construction of the Panama Canal.

[[George Burroughs Torrey]] painted a portrait of him.

Famed fictional [[gunslinger]] [[Morgan Kane]] was Roosevelt's bodyguard when Roosevelt was a general, and Kane worked as a [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] special agent.

Since 2000, Roosevelt has been portrayed by a number of reprisers including historian and Rhodes Scholar, [[Clay Jenkinson]] of [[North Dakota]] and [[Joe Wiegand]] of [[Tennessee]]. Wiegand has portrayed Roosevelt in all 50 US states. In 2008, Wiegand portrayed TR in the [[White House]] at TR's 150th Birthday.

Theodore Roosevelt is [[Historical characters in the Southern Victory Series#Roosevelt, Theodore|an important character]] in the [[Southern Victory Series]] (also known as Timeline-191), an [[alternate history]] series by [[Harry Turtledove]]. He was a New Yorker who moved to Montana to become a rancher after [[Alice Hathaway Lee Roosevelt]] rejects his marriage proposal. He raises and leads his own volunteer cavalry regiment (nicknamed the Unauthorized Regiment) in the [[Second Mexican War]], fighting alongside [[George Armstrong Custer]] to repulse the Anglo-Canadian army led by [[Charles George Gordon]]. He later becomes the Democratic 28th president of the United States and leads the United States to victory in the [[Great War]] on the side of the [[Central Powers]]. He runs for a third term as President, but is defeated by Socialist candidate, [[Upton Sinclair]] and dies of a [[brain hemorrhage]] in 1924. He is buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]] as a final insult to the [[Confederate States of America]] and is regarded as one of the most esteemed Presidents in United States (alternate) history.
