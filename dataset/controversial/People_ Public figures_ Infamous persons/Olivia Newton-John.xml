'''Olivia Newton-John''', [[Order of Australia|AO]], [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 26 September 1948) is an English born Australian singer and actress. She is a four-time [[Grammy Awards|Grammy award]] winner who has amassed five No. 1 and ten other Top Ten Billboard Hot 100 singles&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7Mo7xm-X1r4C&amp;pg=PA334&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22&amp;lr=|isbn=978-0-87930-475-1|title=All Music Guide to Country|first=Michael|last=Erlewine|publisher=Miller Freeman Books|location=San Francisco|year=1997|accessdate=13 August 2010|page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; and two No. 1 Billboard 200 solo albums. Eleven of her singles (including two platinum) and 14 of her albums (including two platinum and four double platinum) have been certified gold by the RIAA. Her music has been successful in multiple formats including pop, [[Country music|country]] and [[adult contemporary]] and has sold an estimated over 100 million albums worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;phoenixwoman.com233&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.phoenixwoman.com/articles/detail/233 |title='Grease' Star Olivia Newton-John Encourages Breast Cancer Survivors |work=Phoenix Woman|month=September–October|year=2010|first=Jessica|last=Parsons|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110715080225/http://www.phoenixwoman.com/articles/detail/233|archivedate=15 July 2011|accessdate=8 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She co-starred with [[John Travolta]] in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]],'' which featured one of the most successful [[Grease: The Original Soundtrack from the Motion Picture|film soundtracks]] in Hollywood history.

Newton-John has been a long-time activist for [[environmentalism|environmental]] and animal rights issues. Since surviving breast cancer in 1992,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=QqtinbjO0oEC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA173,M1 |title=1001 Australians You Should Know |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; she has been an advocate for health awareness becoming involved with various charities, health products and fundraising efforts. Her business interests have included launching several product lines for Koala Blue and co-owning the Gaia Retreat &amp; Spa in Australia.  

Newton-John has been married twice. She currently lives with her second husband, John Easterling, in [[Jupiter Inlet Colony, Florida|Jupiter Inlet Colony]], Florida. She is the mother of one daughter, [[Chloe Rose Lattanzi]], with her first husband, actor [[Matt Lattanzi]].

== Life and career ==
=== Early life and beginnings ===
Olivia Newton-John was born in [[Cambridge]], England, to a Welsh father, Brinley (&quot;Bryn&quot;) Newton-John, and a [[Berlin]]-born mother, Irene Helene (Born), the eldest child of the [[Nobel prize]]-winning atomic physicist [[Max Born]].&lt;ref name=maxborn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rsnr.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/56/2/219.full.pdf|title=The wide-ranging family history of Max Born|year=2002|author=G. V. R. Born|publisher=royalsocietypublishing.org|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tiemohollmann.de/Inhalt/Claussen/ppl/e/6/c0f949bd5342a64d66e.html&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother's family had left [[Germany]] before [[World War II]] to avoid the Nazi regime (Newton-John's maternal grandfather was [[Jew]]ish, and her maternal grandmother was of paternal Jewish ancestry). She is a distant relative to [[Ben Elton]].&lt;ref name=maxborn /&gt; Her maternal great-grandfather was jurist [[Victor Ehrenberg (jurist)|Victor Ehrenberg]] and her matrilineal great-grandmother's father was [[Germans|German]] jurist [[Rudolf von Jhering]]. Newton-John is the youngest of three children, following brother Hugh, a doctor, and sister Rona, an actress who was married to ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' co-star [[Jeff Conaway]] from 1980 until their divorce in 1985. Newton-John's father was an [[MI5|MI.5]] officer on the [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] project at [[Bletchley Park]] who took [[Rudolf Hess]] into custody during World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merrymedia.co.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2416&amp;Itemid=62 |title=Olivia Newton-John on The Biography Channel |publisher=Merrymedia.co.uk |date=3 February 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, when she was six, Newton-John's family emigrated to [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]], where her father worked as a professor of [[German language|German]] and as Master of [[Ormond College (University of Melbourne)|Ormond College]] at the [[University of Melbourne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20071391,00.html |title=Ohh Sandy! – Olivia Newton-John |work=People  |first=Robert |last=Windeler |date=31 July 1978 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At fourteen Newton-John formed a short-lived all-girl group, Sol Four, with three classmates often performing in a coffee shop owned by her brother-in-law.&lt;ref name=&quot;ilovethatsong1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilovethatsong.com/artist/default.aspx?aid=237 |title=Olivia Newton-John – Hip-O Records |publisher=Ilovethatsong.com |date=26 October 1987 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; She became a regular on local [[Australia]]n radio and television shows including [[HSV (TV station)|HSV-7]]'s ''[[Happy Hammond|The Happy Show]]'' where she performed as &quot;Lovely Livvy&quot;. She also appeared on the ''Go Show'' where she met future duet partner, [[Pat Carroll (singer)|Pat Carroll]], and future music producer [[John Farrar]] (Carroll and Farrar would later marry). She entered and won a talent contest on the television program ''Sing, Sing, Sing,'' hosted by 1960s Australian icon [[Johnny O'Keefe]], performing the songs &quot;[[Anyone Who Had a Heart (song)|Anyone Who Had a Heart]]&quot; and &quot;[[Everything's Coming Up Roses]]&quot;. Newton-John was initially reluctant to use the prize she had won, a trip to England, but travelled there nearly a year later after her mother encouraged her to broaden her horizons.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;

Newton-John recorded her first single, &quot;Till You Say You'll Be Mine&quot; b/w &quot;Forever&quot;, in England for [[Decca Records]] in 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt;  Newton-John was homesick in England for her then-boyfriend, [[Ian Turpie]], with whom she had co-starred in the Australian telefilm, ''Funny Things Happen Down Under.'' Newton-John would repeatedly book trips back to Australia that her mother would subsequently cancel.&lt;ref name=&quot;ilovethatsong1&quot;/&gt;  Newton-John's outlook changed when Pat Carroll also moved to England. The two formed a duo called &quot;Pat and Olivia&quot; and toured nightclubs in Europe. (In one incident, they were booked at Paul Raymond's Revue in [[Soho]], London. Dressed primly in frilly, high-collared dresses, they were unaware that this was a [[strip club]] until they began to perform onstage.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Pore-Lee-Dunn Productions |url=http://www.classicbands.com/olivia.html |title=Olivia Newton-John |publisher=Classicbands.com |date=26 September 1948 |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Carroll's visa expired forcing her to return to Australia, Newton-John remained in England to pursue solo work until 1975. She became engaged to [[the Shadows]]' guitarist [[Bruce Welch]], but they never married.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000556/bio john's bio at IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton-John was recruited for the group [[Toomorrow (soundtrack)|Toomorrow]]&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20064989,00.html |title=Pop's Hottest Pipes – Olivia Newton-John |work=People  |first=Robert |last=Windeler |date=24 February 1975 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; formed by American producer [[Don Kirshner]], who was also the music consultant for the earliest recordings of [[the Monkees]]. In 1970, the group starred in a &quot;science fiction musical&quot; film and recorded an accompanying soundtrack album both named after the group. The project bombed and the group disbanded.

=== Early success ===
Newton-John released her first solo album, ''If Not For You'' (No. 158 Pop), in 1971. The [[If Not For You|title track]], written by [[Bob Dylan]] and previously recorded by ex-[[The Beatles|Beatle]] [[George Harrison]] for his 1970 album ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'', was her first international hit (No. 25 Pop, No. 1 [[Adult Contemporary]] (&quot;AC&quot;)).&lt;ref name=ONJ.com_bio&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olivianewton-john.com/bio.html |title=Olivia Newton-John Biography |publisher=Olivianewton-john.com |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her follow-up single, &quot;[[Banks of the Ohio]]&quot;, was a top 10 hit in England and Australia. She was voted Best British Female Vocalist two years in a row by the magazine ''[[Record Mirror]]''. She made frequent appearances on [[Cliff Richard]]'s weekly show, ''It's Cliff Richard'',&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&amp;pg=PT499&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22#PPT387,M1 |title=The Billboard book of number 1 hits |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and starred with him in the telefilm, ''The Case''.

In 1974, Newton-John represented the United Kingdom in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] with the song &quot;[[Long Live Love (song)|Long Live Love]]&quot;. The song was chosen for Newton-John by the British public out of six possible entries. (Newton-John later admitted that she disliked the song.)&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History. Carlton Books, UK. 2007. ISBN 978-1-84442-994-3&lt;/ref&gt; Newton-John placed fourth at the contest held in [[Brighton]] behind [[ABBA]]'s winning &quot;[[Waterloo (ABBA song)|Waterloo]]&quot;. All six Eurovision contest song candidates were recorded by Newton-John and included on her ''Long Live Love'' album, her first for the [[EMI Records]] label. 

In the United States, Newton-John's career floundered after ''If Not For You.'' Subsequent singles including &quot;[[Banks of the Ohio]]&quot; (No. 94 Pop, No. 34 AC) and remakes of [[George Harrison]]'s &quot;[[What Is Life]]&quot; (No. 34 AC) and [[John Denver]]'s &quot;Take Me Home, Country Roads&quot; (No. 119 Pop) made minimal chart impact until the release of &quot;[[Let Me Be There]]&quot; in 1973. The song reached the American Top 10 on the Pop (No. 6), Country (No. 7),&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=eKicir5sZr4C&amp;pg=PA461&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA248,M1 |title=The Billboard Book of Top 40 Country ... |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and AC (No. 3) charts and earned her a [[Grammy Awards|Grammy]] for Best Country Female&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;/&gt; and an Academy of Country Music award for Most Promising Female Vocalist.&lt;ref name=ONJ.com_bio/&gt;  The album, ''Let Me Be There,'' charted No. 1 on Country Albums for two weeks as well as No. 54 on the Billboard 200.

The ''Long Live Love'' album was released in the United States as ''[[If You Love Me, Let Me Know]]'' with the six Eurovision songs dropped for four different, more country-oriented tracks intended to capitalize on the success of &quot;[[Let Me Be There]]&quot;. The title track was the first single reaching No. 5 Pop, No. 2 Country&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;/&gt; (her best country placement to date) and No. 2 AC. The next single, &quot;[[I Honestly Love You]]&quot;, became Newton-John's signature song. Written and composed by [[Jeff Barry]] and [[Peter Allen]],&lt;ref name=&quot;google1&quot;/&gt; the ballad became her first No. 1 Pop (two weeks), second No. 1 AC (three weeks) and third Top 10 Country (No. 6) hit and earned Newton-John two more [[Grammy Awards|Grammys]] for Record of the Year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=iAzZZI-jQv4C&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA5,M1 |title=At the Grammys!: Behind the Scenes ... |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Best Pop Vocal Performance-Female. The success of both singles helped the album reach No. 1 on both the Pop (one week)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dcvM0rFOR_cC&amp;pg=PA191&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3 |title=Notable Moments of Women in Music |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Country (eight weeks) Albums charts.

Newton-John's country success sparked a debate among purists who believed a foreigner singing country-flavoured pop music did not belong in country music.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt; In addition to her Grammy for &quot;Let Me Be There&quot;, Newton-John was also named the [[Country Music Association]] Female Vocalist of the Year in 1974, defeating more established nominees [[Loretta Lynn]], Canadian [[Anne Murray]], [[Dolly Parton]] and [[Tanya Tucker]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&amp;pg=PT499&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22#PPT405,M1 |title=The Billboard book of number 1 hits |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This outrage led to the formation of the short-lived Association of Country Entertainers (ACE).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Williams |first=Bill |title=50 Country Dissidents Organize New Assn., See Threat to CMA |journal=Billboard |pages=pages 3, 48 |publisher=[[Nielsen Company|Nielsen Business Media, Inc.]]/[[Google Books]] |date=23 November 1973 |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=eQkEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT61&amp;lpg=PT61&amp;dq=ace+olivia+cma&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=MIcZudTlld&amp;sig=CaDlXllbAFOWajsy3RTb537atNw&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=ace%20olivia%20cma&amp;f=false |accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Newton-John was eventually supported by the country music community. [[Stella Parton]], [[Dolly Parton|Dolly's]] sister, recorded &quot;Ode to Olivia&quot; and Newton-John recorded her 1976 album, ''[[Don't Stop Believin' (Olivia Newton-John album)|Don't Stop Believin']],'' in [[Nashville]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;  

[[File:Olivia Newton-John 930-0132.jpg|thumb|Olivia Newton-John in 1978]]Encouraged by expatriate Australian singer [[Helen Reddy]], Newton-John left England and moved to the United States. Newton-John topped the Pop (one week) and Country (six weeks) Albums charts with her next album, ''[[Have You Never Been Mellow]].'' The album generated two singles – the [[John Farrar]]-penned title track (No. 1 Pop, No. 3 Country,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; No. 1 AC)&lt;ref name=&quot;google2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7Mo7xm-X1r4C&amp;pg=PA335&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22&amp;lr= |title=All music guide to country: the ... |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;[[Please Mr. Please]]&quot; (No. 3 Pop, No. 5 Country, No. 1 AC).&lt;ref name=&quot;google2&quot;/&gt; Newton-John's pop career cooled with the release of her next album, ''[[Clearly Love]].'' Her streak of five consecutive gold Top 10 singles on the Billboard Hot 100 ended when the album's first single, &quot;[[Something Better to Do]]&quot;, stopped at No. 13 (also No. 19 Country and No. 1 AC). Although her albums still achieved gold status, she did not return to the Top 10 on the Hot 100 or Billboard 200 charts again until 1978.

Newton-John's singles continued to easily top the AC chart, where she ultimately amassed ten No. 1 singles including a record seven consecutively:

* &quot;[[I Honestly Love You]]&quot; (1974) – 3 weeks
* &quot;[[Have You Never Been Mellow (song)|Have You Never Been Mellow]]&quot; (1975) – 1 week
* &quot;[[Please Mr. Please]]&quot; (1975) – 3 weeks
* &quot;[[Something Better to Do]]&quot; (1975) – 3 weeks
* &quot;[[Let It Shine (Linda Hargrove song)|Let It Shine]]&quot;/&quot;[[He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother]]&quot; (1976) – 2 weeks
* &quot;[[Come on Over (1976 song)|Come on Over]]&quot; (1976) – 1 week
* &quot;[[Don't Stop Believin' (1976 song)|Don't Stop Believin']]&quot; (1976) – 1 week

She also provided a prominent, but uncredited, vocal on [[John Denver]]'s &quot;[[Fly Away (John Denver song)|Fly Away]]&quot; single which was succeeded by her own single, &quot;[[Let It Shine (Linda Hargrove song)|Let It Shine]]&quot;/&quot;[[He Ain't Heavy, He's My Brother]],&quot; at No. 1 on the AC chart. (&quot;[[Fly Away (John Denver song)|Fly Away]]&quot; returned to No. 1 after the two week reign of &quot;[[Let It Shine (Linda Hargrove song)|Let It Shine]]&quot;.)  Newton-John also continued to reach the Country Top 10 where she tallied seven Top 10 singles through 1976's &quot;[[Come on Over (1976 song)|Come on Over]]&quot; (No. 23 Pop, No. 5 Country,&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;  No. 1 AC) and six consecutive (of a career nine total) Top 10 albums through 1976's ''[[Don't Stop Believin' (Olivia Newton-John album)|Don't Stop Believin']]'' (No. 30 Pop, No. 7 Country).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; She headlined her first U.S. television special, ''A Special Olivia Newton-John,'' in November 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

By mid-1977, Newton-John's AC and country success also began to wane. Her ''[[Making a Good Thing Better]]'' album (No. 34 Pop, No. 13 Country) failed to be certified gold, and its only single, the title track (No. 87 Pop, No. 20 AC), did not reach even the AC Top 10 or the Country chart. Later that year, ''[[Olivia Newton-John's Greatest Hits]]'' (No. 13 Pop, No. 7 Country) became her first platinum album as she prepared to launch a new phase in her career.

=== ''Grease'' ===
[[File:John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Newton-John and [[John Travolta]]]]

Newton-John's career soared after starring in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical, ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'', in 1978. She was offered the lead role of Sandy after meeting producer [[Allan Carr]] at a dinner party at [[Helen Reddy]]'s home.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; Burned by her ''[[Toomorrow (film)|Toomorrow]]'' experience and concerned that she was too old to play a high school senior (she turned 29 during the latter 1977 filming), Newton-John insisted on a screen test with the film's co-star, [[John Travolta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt;  The film accommodated Newton-John's Australian accent by recasting her character from the play's original American Sandy Dumbrowski to Sandy Olsson, an Australian who vacations and then moves with her family to the United States. Newton-John previewed some of the film's soundtrack during her second American network television special, ''Olivia'', featuring guests [[ABBA]] and [[Andy Gibb]].  

''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' became the biggest box-office hit of 1978.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/boxoffice/alltimegross IMDB – Top Grossing Movies]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grease: The Original Soundtrack from the Motion Picture|The soundtrack album]] spent 12 non-consecutive weeks at No. 1 and yielded three Top 5 singles for Newton-John: the platinum &quot;[[You're The One That I Want]]&quot; (No. 1 Pop, No. 23 AC) with John Travolta, the gold &quot;[[Hopelessly Devoted to You]]&quot; (No. 3 Pop, No. 20 Country, No. 7 AC) and the gold &quot;[[Summer Nights (John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John song)|Summer Nights]]&quot; (No. 5 Pop, No. 21 AC) with John Travolta and the film's cast. The former two songs were written and composed by Newton-John's long-time music producer, [[John Farrar]], specifically for the film.  (&quot;[[Summer Nights (John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John song)|Summer Nights]]&quot; was from the original play written by [[Jim Jacobs]] and [[Warren Casey]].)  Newton-John became the second female (after [[Linda Ronstadt]] in 1977) to have two singles – &quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot; and &quot;Summer Nights&quot; – in the Billboard Top 5 simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&amp;pg=PT499&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22#PPT499,M1 |title=The Billboard book of number 1 hits |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton-John's performance earned her a People's Choice award for Favorite Motion Picture Actress. She was also nominated for a [[Golden Globe]] as Best Actress in a Musical and performed the Oscar-nominated &quot;Hopelessly Devoted to You&quot; at the 1979 [[Academy Awards]].  

The film's popularity has endured through the years. It was re-released for its 20th anniversary in 1998&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fQ4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22&amp;lr= |title=Billboard |publisher=Google Books |date=30 May 1998 |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ranked as the second highest grossing film behind ''[[Titanic movie|Titanic]]'' in its opening weekend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=1998&amp;wknd=13&amp;p=.htm Box Office Weekend, 27–29 March 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;  It was most recently re-released in July 2010 as a sing-along version in select American theatres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://greasemovie.com/ |title=Grease Sing-A-Long (2010) , Trailer &amp; Official Movie Site |publisher=Greasemovie.com |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The soundtrack still sells strongly enough to often appear on ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'s'' Top Soundtracks chart.

Newton-John's transformation in ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' from goody-goody &quot;Sandy 1&quot; to [[spandex|spandex-clad]] &quot;Sandy 2&quot; emboldened Newton-John to do the same with her music career. In November 1978, she released her next studio album, ''[[Totally Hot]],'' which became her first solo Top 10 (No. 7) album since ''Have You Never Been Mellow.'' Dressed on the cover all in leather, the album's singles &quot;A Little More Love&quot; (No. 3 Pop, No. 94 Country, No. 4 AC), &quot;Deeper than the Night&quot; (No. 11 Pop, No. 87 Country, No. 4 AC), and the title track (No. 52 Pop) all demonstrated a more aggressive and uptempo sound for Newton-John.&lt;ref name=&quot;google3&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=7Mo7xm-X1r4C&amp;pg=PA334&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22&amp;lr=#PPA335,M1 |title=All music guide to country: the ... |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the album de-emphasized country, it still reached No. 4 on the Country Albums chart. Newton-John released the B-side, &quot;Dancin' 'Round and 'Round,&quot; of the &quot;Totally Hot&quot; single to Country radio peaking at No. 29&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=eKicir5sZr4C&amp;pg=PA461&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA249,M1 |title=The Billboard Book of Top 40 Country ... |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (as well as No. 82 Pop and No. 25 AC), becoming her last charted solo Country airplay single to date.

Newton-John began 1980 by releasing &quot;I Can't Help It&quot; (No. 12 Pop, No. 8 AC), a duet with [[Andy Gibb]] from his ''After Dark'' album, and by starring in her third television special, ''Hollywood Nights.'' Later that year, she appeared in her first film since ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' starring in the musical ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]]'' with [[Gene Kelly]] and [[Michael Beck]]. Although the movie was a critical failure, its soundtrack (No. 4 Pop) was certified double platinum boasting five Top 20 singles on the Billboard Hot 100.&lt;ref name=&quot;google4&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&amp;pg=PT499&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22#PPT537,M1 |title=The Billboard book of number 1 hits |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton-John charted with &quot;[[Magic (Olivia Newton-John song)|Magic]]&quot; (No. 1 Pop, No. 1 AC), &quot;[[Suddenly (Xanadu song)|Suddenly]]&quot; with [[Cliff Richard]] (No. 20 Pop, No. 4 AC) and the title song with the [[Electric Light Orchestra]] (No. 8 Pop, No. 2 AC).  (The [[Electric Light Orchestra]] also charted with &quot;I'm Alive&quot; (No. 16 Pop, No. 48 AC) and &quot;All Over the World&quot; (No. 13 Pop, No. 46 AC).)  &quot;Magic&quot; was Newton-John's biggest Pop hit to that point (four weeks at No. 1)&lt;ref name=&quot;google4&quot;/&gt; and still ranks as the biggest AC hit of her career (five weeks at No. 1). The film has since become a cult classic and the basis for a well-reviewed Broadway show that ran for more than 500 performances beginning in 2007 and was nominated for four Tony Awards including Best Musical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadway.com/Xanadu-Moves-Up-Broadway-Closing-Date-to-928/broadway_news/571564 |title=Xanadu Moves Up Broadway Closing Date to 9/28 |publisher=Broadway.com |date=23 September 2008 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (A successful international tour of the show followed.)

In 1981, Newton-John released her most successful studio album, the double platinum ''[[Physical (Olivia Newton-John album)|Physical]]''. The title track, written by Steve Kipner and Terry Shaddick, spent ten weeks atop the ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' Hot 100,&lt;ref name=&quot;people1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20081457,00.html |title=Olivia Gets Physical – Personal Success, Matt Lattanzi, Olivia Newton-John |work=People  |first=Carl |last=Arrington |date=15 February 1982 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; matching the then record of most weeks spent at No. 1 in the rock era held by [[Debby Boone]]'s &quot;[[You Light Up My Life (song)|You Light Up My Life]].&quot; The single was certified platinum and it ultimately ranked as the biggest song of the decade. (In 2008, Billboard ranked the song No. 6 among all songs that charted in the 50-year history of the Hot 100.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/specials/hot100/charts/top100-titles-10.shtml |title=Billboard Hot 100 Chat 50th Anniversary – All-Time Top Songs |work=Billboard  |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Physical&quot; even earned Newton-John her only placement ever on the R&amp;B Singles (No. 28) and Albums (No. 32) chart. The ''[[Physical (Olivia Newton-John album)|Physical]]'' album spawned two more singles, &quot;[[Make a Move on Me]]&quot; (No. 5 Pop, No. 6 AC)&lt;ref name=&quot;google5&quot;&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=PgGqNrqfrsoC&amp;pg=PT499&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22#PPT559,M1 |title=The Billboard book of number 1 hits |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Landslide&quot; (No. 52 Pop). 
[[File:Olivia newtonjohn 1988b.jpg|thumb|left|Olivia Newton-John at the opening of a ''Koala Blue'' store in 1988.]]

The provocative lyrics of the title track prompted two [[Utah]] radio stations to ban the single from their playlists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cannon |first=Bob |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,308706,00.html |title=Olivia Gets 'Physical', News |work=Entertainment Weekly |date=19 November 1993 |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (In 2010, Billboard magazine ranked this as the most popular single ever about sex.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE61B5H620100213 |agency=Reuters | title=Olivia Newton-John's &quot;Physical&quot; sexiest song ever | date=13 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To counter its overtly suggestive tone, Newton-John filmed an exercise-themed video that turned the song into an aerobics anthem and made headbands a fashion accessory outside the gym.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/specials/hot100/charts/top50-no1s-80s.shtml |title=Billboard Hot 100 Chart 50th Anniversary – Songs of the Year 1980 to 1989 |work=Billboard  |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton-John became a pioneer in the nascent music video industry by recording a [[Olivia Physical|video album]] for ''Physical'' featuring videos of all the album's tracks and three of her older hits. The video album earned her a fourth Grammy and was aired as an ABC prime time special, ''Let's Get Physical,''&lt;ref name=&quot;people1&quot;/&gt; becoming a Top 10 Nielsen hit. The success of ''Physical'' led to an international tour and the release of her second hits collection, the double platinum ''[[Olivia's Greatest Hits Vol. 2]]'' (No. 16 Pop), which yielded two more Top 40 singles: &quot;[[Heart Attack (Olivia Newton-John song)|Heart Attack]]&quot; (No. 3 Pop)&lt;ref name=&quot;google5&quot;/&gt; and &quot;Tied Up&quot; (No. 38 Pop). The tour was filmed for her ''Olivia In Concert'' television special which premiered on HBO in January 1983. The special was subsequently released to video earning Newton-John another Grammy nomination.

Newton-John re-teamed with Travolta in 1983 for the critically and commercially unsuccessful ''[[Two of a Kind (1983 film)|Two of a Kind]],''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20086629,00.html |title=Animal Magnetism – Two of a Kind, John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John |work=People  |author=Carl Arrington |date=19 October 1983 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; redeemed by its platinum soundtrack (No. 26 Pop) featuring &quot;Twist of Fate&quot; (No. 5 Pop),&lt;ref name=&quot;google5&quot;/&gt; &quot;Livin' in Desperate Times&quot; (No. 31 Pop), and a new duet with Travolta, &quot;Take a Chance&quot; (No. 3 AC). Newton-John released another video package, the Grammy-nominated ''Twist of Fate,'' featuring videos of her four songs on the ''Two of a Kind'' soundtrack and the two new singles from ''[[Olivia's Greatest Hits Vol. 2]].'' 

The same year, Newton-John and Pat Carroll founded ''Koala Blue.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1987-04-13/features/8701240363_1_koala-blue-pat-farrar-olivia-newton-john |title=Olivia Newton-john: Hopelessly Devoted - Sun Sentinel |publisher=Articles.sun-sentinel.com |date=13 April 1987 |accessdate=31 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The store, originally for Australian imports, evolved into a chain of women's clothing boutiques. The chain was initially successful, but it eventually declared bankruptcy and closed in 1992.&lt;ref name=&quot;google3&quot;/&gt; Newton-John and Farrar would later license the brand name for a line of Australian produced wines, confections, and bed/bath products.
[[File:Olivia Newton-John (1989).jpg|thumb|right|Newton-John at the 1989 [[Academy Awards]].]]
Newton-John married her long-time boyfriend, actor [[Matt Lattanzi]], in December 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20089644,00.html |title=To Have and to Hold |work=People  |date=7 January 1985 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had met four years earlier while filming ''[[Xanadu (film)|Xanadu]].'' Their daughter, [[Chloe Rose Lattanzi]], was born in January 1986. (They divorced in 1995.)&lt;ref name=&quot;people2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20132405,00.html |title=Showing Her Mettle – Olivia Newton-John Cover |work=People  |first=Jill |last=Smolowe |date=25 September 2000 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton-John's music career cooled again with the release of her next studio album, the gold ''[[Soul Kiss]]'' (No. 29 Pop), in 1985. The album's only charted single was the title track (No. 20 Pop, No. 20 AC). Due to her pregnancy, Newton-John limited her publicity for the album. The video album for ''[[Soul Kiss]]'' featured only five of the album's ten tracks (concept videos for the album's singles &quot;Soul Kiss&quot; and &quot;Toughen Up&quot; as well as performance videos of the tracks &quot;Culture Shock&quot;, &quot;Emotional Tangle&quot; and &quot;The Right Moment&quot;).

===Motherhood and advocacy===
After a nearly three-year hiatus following the birth of Chloe, Newton-John resumed her recording career with the 1988 album, ''The Rumour.'' The album was promoted by an HBO special, ''Olivia Down Under'', and its first single, the title track, was written and produced by [[Elton John]]. Both the single (No. 62 Pop, No. 33 AC) and the album (No. 67 Pop) fizzled&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CieMGEblw6kC&amp;pg=PT225&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3 |title=His Song: The Musical Journey of ... |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the nearly 40-year-old Newton-John seemed &quot;old&quot; when compared with the teen queens [[Debbie Gibson]] and [[Tiffany (singer)|Tiffany]] ruling the Pop charts at that time. (Ironically, this album was praised by critics as more mature with Newton-John addressing topics such as AIDS, the environment and single-parent households.)  The second single, &quot;Can't We Talk It Over in Bed&quot;, did not chart, but was released in 1989 by [[Grayson Hugh]], the song's arranger, as &quot;Talk It Over&quot; becoming a Top 20 Pop hit. A year later, Newton-John recorded her self-described &quot;self-indulgent&quot; album, ''[[Warm and Tender (Olivia Newton-John album)|Warm and Tender]].'' Inspired by her daughter, who appeared on the album cover, the album featured lullabies and love songs for parents and their children.&lt;ref name=&quot;google3&quot;/&gt;  This album, the last one produced by John Farrar, also failed to revive her recording career struggling to No. 124 Pop.

Newton-John was primed for another comeback in 1992 when she compiled her third hits collection, ''Back to Basics – The Essential Collection 1971–1992'', and planned her first tour since her ''Physical'' trek ten years earlier. Shortly after the album's release, Newton-John was diagnosed with breast cancer forcing her to cancel all publicity for the album including the tour. (Newton-John received her diagnosis the same weekend her father died.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20113234,00.html |title=Toughing It Out |work=People  |date=3 August 1992 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Newton-John recovered&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20126583,00.html |title=Victors Valiant – Cancer, Coping and Overcoming Illness |work=People  |author=Schindehette, Susan |coauthors=Karen Schneider and Anne-Marie O'Neill |date=26 October 1998 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and since became a tireless advocate for breast cancer research and other health issues. She is a product spokesperson for the Liv-Kit, a breast self-examination product. She is also partial owner of the Gaia Retreat and Spa in [[Byron Bay]], Australia advertised as &quot;the ideal place to renew, refresh, and restore your mind, body and soul.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaiaretreat.com.au/flex/about_us/44/1 |title=About US |publisher=Gaiaretreat.com.au |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Newton-John's advocacy for health issues was presaged by her prior involvement with many humanitarian causes. Newton-John cancelled a 1978 concert tour of [[Japan]] to protest the slaughter of dolphins caught in tuna fishing nets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=9CQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT89&amp;lpg=PT89&amp;dq=newton-john+tour+cancel+japan+dolphins&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FU4YoCWiGX&amp;sig=2gR8KQBiHMsyKq04dNuPl2Hj4QE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=RMF2TKHjEIKClAe-2JDsCw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Billboard, 1978]&lt;/ref&gt; (She subsequently rescheduled the tour when the Japanese government assured her the matter was being addressed.) She was a performer on the 1979 ''[[Music for UNICEF Concert]]'' for the UN' [[International Year of the Child]] televised worldwide. During the concert, artists performed songs for which they donated their royalties, some in perpetuity, to benefit the cause. She was appointed a Goodwill Ambassador to the United Nations Environment Programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olivianewton-john.com/bio_text.html Bio at official web site]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1991, she became the National Spokesperson for the Colette Chuda Environmental Fund/CHEC (Children’s Health Environmental Coalition) following the death of four year old Colette Chuda, a family friend, from cancer. (Chuda was featured along with Newton-John and daughter Chloe on the cover of Newton-John's ''[[Warm and Tender (Olivia Newton-John album)|Warm and Tender]]'' album.)

Newton-John's cancer diagnosis also affected the type of music she recorded. In 1994, she released ''Gaia: One Woman's Journey'' which chronicled her ordeal. This was the first album on which Newton-John wrote all of the songs encouraging her to become more active as a songwriter thereafter. In 2005, she released ''Stronger Than Before,'' sold exclusively in the United States by Hallmark. Proceeds from the album's sales benefited breast cancer research. The album featured the song &quot;Phenomenal Woman&quot; based on the poem by [[Maya Angelou]] that featured guest vocals from [[Diahann Carroll]], [[Beth Nielsen Chapman]], [[Delta Goodrem]], [[Amy Holland]], [[Patti LaBelle]] and [[Mindy Smith]] – all survivors of or affected by cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/mndwebpages/newton-john%20records%20angelou%20poem%20for%20breast%20cancer |title=Newton-John Records Angelou Poem For Breast Cancer |publisher=Contactmusic.com |date=21 August 2005 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Newton-John released a healing CD, ''[[Grace and Gratitude]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,1538540,00.html |title=Olivia Newton-John Moves On – Personal Tragedy, Olivia Newton-John |work=People  |first=Sandra |last=Marquez |date=28 September 2006 |accessdate=200–11–10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was sold exclusively by Walgreens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=KQ8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA75&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3 |title=Billboard |publisher=Google Books |date=28 October 2006 |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; also benefitting various charities including [[Y-ME]] National Breast Cancer Organization. The CD was the &quot;heart&quot; of their ''Body – Heart – Spirit'' Wellness Collection which also featured a re-branded Liv-Kit and breast-health dietary supplements. Newton-John re-recorded some tracks from ''[[Grace and Gratitude]]'' in 2010 and re-released the album as ''[[Grace and Gratitude|Grace and Gratitude Renewed]]'' on the Green Hill music label. The ''Renewed'' CD includes a new track, &quot;Help Me to Heal,&quot; not featured on the original album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenhillmusic.com/item/GHD5759_Grace+And+Gratitude+Renewed |title=Green Hill Music-Grace And Gratitude Renewed |publisher=Greenhillmusic.com |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Renewed'' CD yielded Newton-John's first appearances on the Billboard Christian Albums (No. 36), Christian &amp; Gospel Albums (No. 54) and New Age Albums (No. 2) charts.

In 2008, Newton-John raised funds to help build the Olivia Newton-John Cancer and Wellness Centre in Melbourne, Australia. She led a three-week, 228&amp;nbsp;km. walk along the [[Great Wall of China]] during April joined by various celebrities and cancer survivors throughout her trek. The walk [http://www.greatwalktobeijing.com/] symbolized the steps cancer patients must take on their road to recovery. Newton-John released a companion CD, ''A Celebration In Song,'' the following month in Australia and later worldwide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/ask_bb/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003825438 |title=Ask Billboard |work=Billboard  |accessdate=10 November 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080801171830/http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/ask_bb/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003825438 |archivedate = 1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; featuring new and previously recorded duets by &quot;Olivia Newton-John &amp; Friends.&quot;  Her &quot;Friends&quot; included [[Jann Arden]], [[Jimmy Barnes]], [[John Farrar]], [[Barry Gibb]], [[Delta Goodrem]], [[Sun Ho]], [[Richard Marx]], [[Cliff Richard]], Melinda Schneider, [[Amy Sky]] and [[Keith Urban]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://live.greatwalktobeijing.com/index.php?act=news&amp;nID=47 |title=Olivia and friends release album to better cancer research |publisher=Great Walk to Beijing.com |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (The album was re-released by Green Hill Records with different artwork in 2011.)  In October, Newton-John helped launch the www.liv.com website and teamed with fitness franchise Curves to distribute one million Liv-Aid breast self-examination aids for [[Breast Cancer Awareness Month]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/olivia-newton-john-partners-several-musical/story.aspx?guid=%7B598D0B06-78EE-48AD-A39C-9D60FA2156D0%7D&amp;dist=hppr &quot;Olivia Newton-John Partners.&quot;] ''Market Watch.com.&lt;/ref&gt;  {{Dead link|date=November 2008}}

Newton-John collaborated with producer [[David Foster]] to record &quot;Hope Is Always Here&quot; for the November 2009 television special, ''Kaleidoscope.'' The song was written and composed for the show's performance by another breast cancer survivor, figure skater [[Dorothy Hamill]]. The song was released as a digital single after the show aired.

Newton-John was featured in UniGlobe Entertainment's breast cancer docu-drama, ''[[1 a Minute]],'' released in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/indian-star-rallies-celebrity-support-for-cancer-movie_1118440 |title=Mcg – Indian Star Rallies Celebrity Support For Cancer Movie – Contactmusic News |publisher=Contactmusic.com |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The documentary was made by actress [[Namrata Singh Gujral]] and featured other celebrities who survived breast cancer or were affected by the disease. During the same month, [[Bluewater Comics|Bluewater Productions]] released a comic book featuring Newton-John to coincide with [[Breast Cancer Awareness Month]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Up for Discussion Jump to Forums |url= http://www.billboard.com/news/justin-bieber-comic-book-to-track-his-rise-1004105913.story#/news/justin-bieber-comic-book-to-track-his-rise-1004105913.story |title=Justin Bieber Comic Book to Track His Rise to 'Fame' |work=Billboard |date=14 September 2009 |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newton-John was listed as president of the [[Isle of Man]] [[Basking Shark]] Society between 1998 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20050210085842/http://www.isle-of-man.com/interests/shark/intro.html Internet Archive cache] from 10 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Later career ===
Newton-John continued to record and perform pop-oriented music as well. In 1998, she returned to Nashville to record ''[[Back with a Heart]]'' (No. 59 Pop).&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; The album returned her to the Top 10 (No. 9) on the Country Albums chart. Its first single was a re-recording of &quot;[[I Honestly Love You]]&quot; produced by [[David Foster]] and featuring [[Babyface (musician)|Kenneth &quot;Babyface&quot; Edmonds]] on background vocals&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt; that charted Pop (No. 67) and AC (No. 18). Country radio dismissed the song, though it did peak at No. 16 on the Country Sales chart. The album track, &quot;Love Is a Gift,&quot; won Newton-John a 1999 Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Original Song after being featured on the daytime serial, ''[[As The World Turns]]''.

[[File:Olivia Newton John and John Easterling in 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Olivia Newton-John and Stephen Elliott in January 2012 at the premier of [[A Few Best Men]] in [[Sydney]], Australia]]
Newton-John's subsequent secular albums were released primarily in Australia. Newton-John, [[John Farnham]] and [[Anthony Warlow]] toured Australia as ''[[The Main Event (concert tour)|The Main Event]].'' The live album won an [[ARIA Music Awards|ARIA Award]] for Highest Selling Australian CD and was also nominated for Best Adult Contemporary Album. She and Farnham performed &quot;Dare to Dream&quot; at the Opening Ceremony of the [[2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Sydney Olympics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;people2&quot; /&gt;  In 2002, Newton-John released ''(2),'' a duets album featuring mostly Australian artists ([[Tina Arena]], [[Darren Hayes]], Jimmy Little, Johnny O'Keefe, Billy Thorpe, [[Keith Urban]]) as well as a heartfelt &quot;duet&quot; with the deceased [[Peter Allen]]. The same year, Newton-John was inducted into Australia's [[ARIA Hall of Fame]]. ''Indigo: Women of Song,'' a tribute album covering songs by female artists such as [[Joan Baez]], [[the Carpenters]], [[Doris Day]], [[Nina Simone]], [[Minnie Riperton]] and others, was released in 2004. Newton-John dedicated the album to her mother, who had died the previous year.

Newton-John also released several Christmas albums. In 2000, she teamed with [[Vince Gill]] and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] for '''Tis the Season'' sold exclusively through Hallmark. The following year, she released ''The Christmas Collection'' which compiled seasonal music previously recorded for her Hallmark Christmas album, her appearance on [[Kenny Loggins]]' 1999 TNN Christmas special and her contributions to the ''Mother and Child'' and ''Spirit of Christmas'' multi-artist collections. (Green Hill Records re-released this album with different artwork in 2010.) In 2007, she re-teamed with her ''Grace and Gratitude'' producer, [[Amy Sky]], for ''Christmas Wish'' (No. 187 Pop) which was sold exclusively by Target in its first year of release.

Newton-John acted occasionally since ''[[Two of a Kind (1983 film)|Two of a Kind]]''. She appeared in a supporting role in the 1996 AIDS drama, ''It's My Party''. In 2000, she appeared in a dramatically different role as Bitsy Mae Harling, a lesbian ex-con country singer, in [[Del Shores]]' ''[[Sordid Lives]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;people2&quot;/&gt;  Newton-John reprised her role for ''[[Sordid Lives: The Series]]'' which aired one season on the LOGO television network. The series featured five original songs written and composed by Newton-John specifically for the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN0954083620080109 |title=Gay channel Logo steps into Sordid realm |agency=Reuters  |date=9 January 2008 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2010, Newton-John starred in the film ''[[Score: A Hockey Musical]]'', released in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoreahockeymusical.com/home |title=Score a Hockey Musical |publisher=Score a Hockey Musical |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newton-John portrayed Hope Gordon, the mother of a home-schooled hockey prodigy. The film opened the 2010 [[Toronto International Film Festival]]. 

Newton-John's television work included starring in two Christmas films, ''A Mom for Christmas'' (1990)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20114007,00.html |title=Starring as a Mom for Christmas, Olivia Newton-John Returns to Acting in a Role She Plays All Year Round |work=People  |first=Jeannie |last=Park |date=24 December 1990 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''A Christmas Romance'' (1994) – both Top 10 Nielsen hits. Her daughter, [[Chloe Rose Lattanzi|Chloe]], starred as one of her children in both ''A Christmas Romance'' and in the 2001 Showtime film ''The Wilde Girls.'' Newton-John guest-starred as herself in the sitcoms ''[[Ned and Stacey]]'', ''[[Murphy Brown]]'', and ''[[Bette (TV series)|Bette]]'', and made two appearances as herself on ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''. For her first ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]'' appearance, Newton-John re-created her &quot;Physical&quot; video with series regular [[Jane Lynch]]. The performance was released as a digital single, returning Newton-John to the Billboard Hot 100 (No. 89) for the first time since her 1998 re-release of &quot;[[I Honestly Love You]]&quot;. In Australia, Newton-John hosted the animal and nature series ''Wild Life'' and guest starred as Joanna on two episodes of the Australian series ''[[The Man from Snowy River (TV series)|The Man From Snowy River]]''.

Newton-John met [[gaffer (motion picture industry)|gaffer]]/[[camera operator|cameraman]] [[Patrick McDermott]] a year after her 1995 divorce from [[Matt Lattanzi]]. The couple dated on and off for nine years. McDermott disappeared following a 2005 fishing trip off the [[California]] coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.com/books?id=QqtinbjO0oEC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=%22olivia+newton%22&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA174,M1 |title=1001 Australians You Should Know |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Various theories abounded regarding his disappearance ranging from his death by accident or foul play to McDermott staging his disappearance to avoid child support payments to his ex-wife, actress Yvette Nipar. Newton-John, who was in Australia at her Gaia Retreat &amp; Spa at the time of his disappearance, was never a suspect in McDermott's disappearance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Newton-John 'frantic.' |agency=[[Australian Associated Press]] |work=The Sydney Morning Herald  |date=22 August 2005 |url= http://www.smh.com.au/news/people/newtonjohn-frantic/2005/08/22/1124562799885.html?oneclick=true |accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has refused to comment on any speculation.

Newton-John returned to the tabloid headlines again in 2007 when it was revealed that her daughter [[Chloe Rose Lattanzi|Chloe]] was recovering from anorexia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=I Feel Grateful for Where I Am Now |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20196244,00.html |work=People  |first=Jessica |last=Herndon |coauthors=Michelle Tan |date=21 April 2008 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Newton-John released another concert DVD, ''Olivia Newton-John and the Sydney Symphony: Live at the [[Sydney Opera House]],'' and a companion CD, ''Olivia's Live Hits,'' in January 2008. An edited version of the DVD premiered on PBS station, WLIW (Garden City, New York), in October 2007 and subsequently aired nationally during the network's fund-raising pledge drives. This was Newton-John's third live album after the 1981 [[Japan]]ese release, ''Love Performance,'' and her 2000 Australian release, ''One Woman's Live Journey''.

In 2008, Newton-John took part in the [[BBC Wales]] programme ''[[Coming Home (UK TV series)|Coming Home]]'' about her Welsh family history.

In June 2008, Newton-John secretly wed John (&quot;Amazon John&quot;) Easterling, founder and president of natural remedy firm, Amazon Herb Company. The couple had first met 15 years earlier, but they only became romantically involved in 2007. (Like Newton-John, this was Easterling's second marriage.)  The couple married alone in a private Incan spiritual ceremony in [[Cuzco]], [[Peru]] on 21 June&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2008045935_eye11.html |title=seattletimes.nwsource, Newton-John marries |publisher=Seattletimes.nwsource.com |date=11 July 2008 |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed nine days later by a legal ceremony on the [[Jupiter Island, Florida|Jupiter Island]] beachfront in [[Florida]]. There were no guests at either service since the couple preferred to marry simply and privately. Only Newton-John's daughter, Chloe, was aware of the nuptials. The couple did not announce their marriage until a 4 July barbecue at Newton-John's [[Malibu, California|Malibu]], California home, where guests were surprised with the news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20210466,00.html |title=Olivia Newton-John Marries John Easterling – Twice! |work=People  |author=Michelle Tan |date=10 July 2008 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wedding was confirmed thereafter by ''HELLO!'' Magazine which published exclusive pictures of both weddings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/2008/07/15/newton-john-marriage/ |title=Olivia Newton-John shares wedding joy|publisher=Mycelebritynews.o.uk |date=15 July 2008 |accessdate=10 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2009, the Easterlings purchased a new $4.1&amp;nbsp;million home in [[Jupiter Inlet Colony|Jupiter Inlet]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcpalm.com/news/2009/jun/18/olivia-newton-john-and-hubby-buy-home-jupiter-inle/ |title=Olivia Newton-John and hubby buy home in Jupiter Inlet Colony |publisher=TCPalm.com |accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Newton-John sold her home in Malibu, California.

In January 2011, Newton-John began filming ''A Few Best Men'' in Australia with director [[Stephan Elliott]] in the role of mother of bride. The groom is played by ([[Xavier Samuel]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Olivia Newton-John's back, with a few good men |location=Melbourne, Australia |work=Herald Sun |publisher=[[The Herald and Weekly Times Ltd]] |date=14 January 2011 |url= http://www.heraldsun.com.au/entertainment/movies/olivia-newton-johns-back-with-a-few-good-men/story-e6frf9h6-1225987475798?from=public_rss |accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
