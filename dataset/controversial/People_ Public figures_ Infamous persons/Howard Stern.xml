'''Howard Allan Stern''' (born January 12, 1954) is an American radio personality, television host, author, actor, and photographer best known for [[The Howard Stern Show|his radio show]] which was nationally [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] from 1986 to 2005. He gained wide recognition in the 1990s and is labeled a &quot;[[shock jock]]&quot; for his outspoken and sometimes controversial style. Stern has been exclusive to [[Sirius XM Radio]], a subscription-based [[satellite radio]] service, since 2006. The son of a former recording and radio engineer, Stern wished to pursue a career in radio at the age of five. While at [[Boston University]] he worked at the campus station [[WTBU]] before a brief stint at [[WNTN]] in [[Newton, Massachusetts]].

He developed his on-air personality when he landed positions at [[WXPK|WRNW]] in [[Briarcliff Manor, New York|Briarcliff Manor]], [[WCCC-FM|WCCC]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] and [[WDTW-FM|WWWW]] in [[Detroit]]. In 1981, he was paired with his current newscaster and co-host [[Robin Quivers]] at [[WWDC-FM|WWDC]] in Washington, D.C. Stern then moved to [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] in New York City in 1982 to host afternoons until his firing in 1985. He re-emerged on [[WXRK]] that year, and became one of the nation's most popular radio personalities during his 20-year tenure at the station. Stern's show is the most-fined radio program, after the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) [[FCC fines of The Howard Stern Show|issued fines]] to station licensees for allegedly indecent material that totaled $2.5 million. Stern has won ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard's]]'' Nationally Syndicated Air Personality of the Year award eight times, and is one of the highest-paid figures in radio.&lt;ref name=newsmax&gt;{{cite news|url= http://w3.newsmax.com/radio_hosts.cfm|title=NewsMax Top 25 Radio Hosts|date=November 29, 2008 |publisher= Newsmax |accessdate=November 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stern describes himself as the '''King of All Media''' for his ventures outside radio. Since 1987, he has hosted numerous late night [[Howard Stern television shows|television shows]], [[Howard Stern videography and discography|pay-per-view events and home video releases]]. He embarked on a five-month political campaign for [[Governor of New York]] in 1994. His two books, ''[[Private Parts (book)|Private Parts]]'' (1993) and ''[[Miss America (book)|Miss America]]'' (1995), spent 20 and 16 weeks respectively on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]]. The former was adapted into ''[[Private Parts (1997 film)|Private Parts]]'' (1997), a biographical comedy film that starred Stern and his radio show [[The Howard Stern Show staff|staff]] that earned $41.2 million in domestic revenue. Stern performs on its [[Howard Stern videography and discography#Private Parts: The Album|soundtrack]] which topped the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. A published photographer, Stern's work has been featured in a number of magazines including ''[[Hamptons (magazine)|Hamptons]]'' and ''[[WHIRL Magazine|WHIRL]]''. In 2012, Stern became a judge on the television talent show ''[[America's Got Talent]]'', replacing former judge [[Piers Morgan]].

==Early life and education==
[[File:BU College of Communication.jpg|thumb|right|Stern graduated from the College of Public Communications at Boston University in 1976.]]
Stern was born on January 12, 1954 into a Jewish family who lived in [[Jackson Heights, Queens]] in New York City.&lt;ref name=col2&gt;Colford, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=oct2704&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1098849600 |title= Howard Confronts FCC Chairman Michael Powell! |publisher= howardstern.com |first= Jason |last= Kaplan |accessdate= August 2, 2010 |quote=His Hebrew name is &quot;Tzvi&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents Ben and Ray (née Schiffman) are children of [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] immigrants, and his sister Ellen is four years older than him.&lt;ref name=col2 /&gt; The family moved to the hamlet of [[Roosevelt, New York|Roosevelt]] on [[Long Island]] in 1955,&lt;ref&gt;Colford, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; where Stern developed an interest in radio at five years of age.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; While Ray was a homemaker and later an inhalation therapist,&lt;ref&gt;Stern, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stern, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Ben was a co-owner of Aura Recording, Inc., a recording studio in [[Manhattan]] where cartoons and commercials were produced.&lt;ref name=col7&gt;Colford, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; When he made occasional visits with his father, Stern witnessed actors [[Wally Cox]], [[Don Adams]] and [[Larry Storch]] voice his favorite cartoon characters,&lt;ref&gt;Stern, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0601/05/lkl.01.html |title= CNN Larry King Live - Interview With Howard Stern |publisher= CNN Transcripts | accessdate = March 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which influenced him to later talk on the air rather than play records.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; Ben was also an engineer at [[WZRC|WHOM]], a radio station in Manhattan.&lt;ref name=col7 /&gt; Upon completion of [[sixth grade]], Stern left Washington-Rose Elementary School for [[Roosevelt Junior-Senior High School]].&lt;ref&gt;Colford, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1969, the family moved to nearby [[Rockville Centre, New York|Rockville Centre]] and Stern transferred to [[South Side High School (Rockville Centre, New York)|South Side High School]].&lt;ref name=act1guide&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sirius.com/servlet/ContentServer?pagename=Sirius/Page&amp;c=FlexContent&amp;cid=1198688730431 |title=The History of Howard Stern Act I Interactive Guide |publisher = Sirius Satellite Radio | date=December 2007 | accessdate= August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stern spent the first two of four years at [[Boston University]] in the College of Basic Studies.&lt;ref name=pp115&gt;Stern, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, he started to work at [[WTBU]], the campus radio station where he spun records, read the news, and hosted interviews.&lt;ref name=pp115 /&gt; He also hosted a comedy program with three fellow students called ''The King Schmaltz Bagel Hour''.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, pp. 115–117.&lt;/ref&gt; Stern gained admission to the [[Boston University College of Communication|School of Public Communications]] in 1974&lt;ref&gt;Colford, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; and earned a diploma in July 1975 at the Radio Engineering Institute of Electronics in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]] which allowed him to apply for a [[General radiotelephone operator license|first class FCC radio-telephone license]].&lt;ref name=pp121&gt;Stern, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VWQzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tgcGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4720%2C66309 |title= Stern's Start |work= The Free Lance-Star |first= Michael |last= Zitz |date= July 1, 1994 |accessdate= May 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the license, Stern made his professional debut at [[WNTN]] in [[Newton, Massachusetts]], performing airshift, newscasting and production duties between August and December 1975.&lt;ref name=pp123&gt;Stern, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated [[Latin honors#Types|magna cum laude]] from Boston University in May 1976 with a degree in Communications&lt;ref name=oct2704 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pp115 /&gt; and now funds a scholarship at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bu.edu/bulletins/com/item19.html |title=Boston University 2009-10 College of Communication Bulletin |publisher=Boston University | accessdate= August 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{See also|The Howard Stern Show|Howard Stern television shows|Howard Stern videography and discography}}

===Early professional radio career (1976–1981)===
After his graduation in 1976, Stern declined an offer to work evenings at [[WXPK|WRNW]], a [[progressive rock]] station in [[Briarcliff Manor]], [[Westchester County, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Stern, p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; He was unsure of his talent, and questioned his future in the professional industry. Stern took creative and media planning roles at [[Benton &amp; Bowles]], a New York advertising agency, followed by a job in selling radio time to advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, pp. 118–119.&lt;/ref&gt; He realized the mistake of declining on-air work and contacted WRNW a second time where he agreed to work covering shifts over the Christmas holiday period.&lt;ref name=pp123 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stern, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Stern was hired full-time in 1977 and worked a four-hour midday shift, six days per week a $96 weekly salary.&lt;ref name=pp121 /&gt; He subsequently worked as the station's production and [[program director]] for an increased salary of $250.&lt;ref name=pp123 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stern, p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Stern spotted an advertisement for a &quot;wild, fun morning guy&quot; at rock station [[WCCC-FM|WCCC]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;Stern, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; He submitted a more outrageous audition tape with [[Robert Klein]] and [[Cheech and Chong]] records mixed with flatulence routines and one-liners.&lt;ref&gt;Colford, p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; Stern was hired with no change in salary with a more intense schedule. After four hours on the air he voiced and produced commercials for another four. On Saturdays, following a six-hour show, he did production work for the next three. As the station's public affairs director he also hosted a Sunday morning talk show which he favoured.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, pp. 126–127.&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of the [[1979 energy crisis]], Stern held a two-day boycott of [[Shell Oil Company]] which attracted media attention.&lt;ref&gt;Colford, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; Stern left WCCC a year later after he was declined a pay increase.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fred Norris]], the overnight disc jockey, has been Stern's producer and writer since 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Colford, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Management at rock outlet [[WDTW-FM|WWWW]] in [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]] praised Stern's audition tape in their search for a new morning man.&lt;ref name=col52&gt;Colford, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; Stern was hired for the job which he started on April 21, 1980.&lt;ref name=act1guide /&gt; He learned to become more open on the air and &quot;decided to cut down the barriers...strip down all the ego...and be totally honest&quot;, he later told ''[[Newsday]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Colford, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; His efforts earned him a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' award for &quot;Album-Oriented Rock Personality of the Year For a Major Market&quot; and the [[Drake-Chenault]] &quot;Top Five Talent Search&quot; title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Billboard's Radio Winners Named | date=August 1, 1981 | work= Billboard | accessdate = February 14, 2010 |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ASQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PT2&amp;dq=%22Radio%20Winners%20Named%22&amp;rview=1&amp;pg=PT2#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Radio%20Winners%20Named%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pp134&gt;Stern, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The station, however, ran into problems after Stern's quarterly [[Arbitron]] ratings had decreased while it struggled to compete with its stronger rock competitors. In January 1981, WWWW switched to a country music [[radio format|format]] much to Stern's dislike, who left the station soon after.&lt;ref&gt;Colford, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; He received offers to work at [[WXRT]] in [[Chicago]] and [[CHUM-FM|CHUM]] in [[Toronto]], but did not take them.&lt;ref name=pp134 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Stern warning | date= September 4, 1997 | first= Jeff | last= Craig | publisher= Jam! | accessdate = August 12, 2010 |url= http://jam.canoe.ca/Movies/Artists/S/Stern_Howard/1997/09/04/761973.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Washington and WNBC New York (1981–1985)===
Stern moved to Washington, D.C. to host mornings at rock station [[WWDC (FM)|WWDC]] on March 2, 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Colford, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colford, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to develop his show further, and looked for a co-worker with a sense of humor to riff with on news and current events.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; The station paired Stern with [[Robin Quivers]], a newscaster and consumer affairs reporter from [[WJZ (AM)|WFBR]] in [[Baltimore]].&lt;ref&gt;Colford, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Though he felt restricted and controlled by management who enforced a strict format, Stern had the second highest rated morning radio program in January 1982.&lt;ref&gt;Stern, pp. 138–140.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Colford, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; Impressed with his ratings success, [[NBC]] approached Stern with an offer to work afternoons at [[WNBC (AM)|WNBC]] in New York City. After Stern signed a five-year contract worth $1 million in March,&lt;ref&gt;Colford, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; his relationship with WWDC management worsened,&lt;ref&gt;Colford, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; and his contract with the station was terminated on June 25. He had more than tripled the station's morning ratings during his stay.&lt;ref&gt;Colford, pp. 87–89.&lt;/ref&gt; In its July issue ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|The Washingtonian]]'' named Stern the area's best disc jockey.&lt;ref&gt;Colford, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Stern released ''[[50 Ways to Rank Your Mother]]'', a comedy album of his radio bits. The record was re-released as ''Unclean Beaver'' in November 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Colford, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2, 1982, a news report by [[Douglas Kiker]] on raunch radio featuring Stern aired on ''NBC Magazine''.&lt;ref name=col91-95&gt;Colford, pp. 91–93.&lt;/ref&gt; The piece stimulated discussion among NBC management to withdraw Stern's contract. When he began his afternoon program in September,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= WNBC's Stern Is Rendered Speechless | date= September 11, 1982 | work= Billboard |accessdate = February 25, 2010 |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=OiQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PT15&amp;dq=%22howard%20stern%22&amp;rview=1&amp;pg=PT15#v=onepage&amp;q=%22howard%20stern%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; management closely monitored Stern, telling him to avoid talk of a sexual and religious nature.&lt;ref name=nymag92&gt;{{cite news |url = http://books.google.com/books?id=3-QCAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA38#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title = Bad Mouth.

This became the task of program director [[Kevin Metheny]], who Stern nicknamed &quot;Pig Virus&quot;.&lt;ref name=col91-95 /&gt; On May 21, 1984, Stern made his first appearance on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', launching him into the national spotlight.&lt;ref name=act1guide /&gt; A year later he claimed the highest ratings at WNBC in four years with a 5.7% market share.&lt;ref&gt;Colford, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, 1985, Stern and Quivers were fired for what management termed &quot;conceptual differences&quot; regarding the show.&lt;ref name='act2guide' /&gt; &quot;Over the course of time, we made a very conscious effort to make Stern aware that certain elements of the program should be changed...I don't think it's appropriate to say what those specifics were&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Luerssen, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; said program director [[John Hayes (radio)|John Hayes]], who Stern nicknamed &quot;The Incubus&quot;. In 1992, Stern believed Thornton Bradshaw, chairman of WNBC's owner [[RCA]], heard his &quot;Bestiality Dial-a-Date&quot; segment and ordered his firing.&lt;ref name=nymag92 /&gt; Stern and Quivers kept in touch with their audience throughout October and November where they toured club venues with a stage show.&lt;ref name='act2guide'&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.sirius.com/wo/i/howard/history_II/part_a/hoh-120908_a.swf |title = The History of Howard Stern Act II Interactive Guide |publisher = Sirius Satellite Radio |date=December 2008 |accessdate=November 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Stern launched the Howard Stern Production Company for original and joint production and development ventures. He intended to make a film adaptation of ''Brother Sam'', the biography of the late comedian [[Sam Kinison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=KOcTAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=-gcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=howard-stern-production&amp;pg=4647%2C1535965 |title= Entertainment News |work= Star-Banner |date= June 24, 1994 |accessdate= April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1999, [[UPN]] announced the production of ''Doomsday'', an animated science-fiction comedy series executively produced by Stern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.google.co.uk/newspapers?id=pyIyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=b6YFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=doomsday%20howard-stern&amp;pg=3357%2C1102446 |title= Stern's 'Doomsday' dawns at UPN |work= Reading Eagle |date= September 17, 1999 |accessdate= August 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally set for a 2000 release, Stern starred as Orinthal, a family dog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/1999/09/16/1999-09-16_upn_show_enlists_stern_as_an.html |title= UPN Show Enlists Stern As An Animated Talker |work= [[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |date= September 16, 1999 |accessdate= August 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=August 2012|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was eventually abandoned. From 2000 to 2002, Stern was the executive producer of ''[[Son of the Beach]]'', a sitcom which ran for three seasons on [[FX (TV network)|FX]]. In late 2001, Howard Stern Productions was reportedly developing a new sitcom titled ''Kane''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.animaux.net/stern/kane.html |first= Michael |last= Schneider |title= Stern, CBS part for sitcom |agency=Reuters |date= November 16, 2001 |accessdate= April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot episode was never filmed. In 2002, Stern acquired the rights to comedy films ''[[Rock 'n' Roll High School]]'' (1979) and ''[[Porky's]]'' (1982). He filed a $100 million lawsuit in March 2003 against [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and the producers of ''[[Are You Hot?]]'', claiming the series was based on his radio segment called &quot;The Evaluators&quot;.

With an annual budget of $100 million for all production, staff and programming costs, Stern launched two channels on Sirius in 2005 named [[Howard 100 and Howard 101]]. He assembled the [[Howard 100 News]] team that covered stories about his show and those associated with it, and a new dedicated studio was constructed at Sirius' headquarters in New York.&lt;ref name=8k&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.secinfo.com/dsvRa.13ej.htm | title = Sirius Satellite Radio Inc. 8-K For 10/1/04 | publisher = SEC Info | date = October 1, 2004 | accessdate = March 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 9, 2006, the day of his first broadcast, Stern and his agent received 34.3 million shares of stock from the company worth $218 million for exceeding subscriber targets set in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/05/news/newsmakers/stern/index.htm | title=Howard Stern &amp; Co.
