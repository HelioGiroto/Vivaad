'''Kathie Lee Gifford''' (born '''Kathryn Lee Epstein''' on August 16, 1953) is an [[United States of America|American]] [[television host]], [[singing|singer]], [[songwriter]] and [[actress]], best known for her 15-year run (1985&amp;ndash;2000) on the [[talk show]] ''[[Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee]]'', which she co-hosted with [[Regis Philbin]]. She has received 11 [[Daytime Emmy]] nominations and won her first [[Daytime Emmy]] in 2010 as part of ''The Today Show'' team.

Before her long stint in [[talk show]]s, Gifford's first television exposure was that of [[Tom Kennedy (television presenter)|Tom Kennedy]]'s singer/sidekick on ''[[Name That Tune]]'', from 1974-78. On April 7, 2008, Gifford began co-hosting the fourth hour of [[NBC|NBC's]] ''[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]'', alongside [[Hoda Kotb]].

==Early life==
Kathie Lee Gifford, born '''Kathryn Lee Epstein''' in [[Paris]], [[France]], is the daughter of Joan (née Cuttell; born January 20, 1930), a singer, and Aaron Epstein (March 19, 1924 &amp;ndash; November 19, 2002), a musician and former [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] officer. Aaron Epstein was stationed with his family in [[France]] at the time of Gifford's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/88/Kathie-Lee-Gifford.html|title=Kathie Lee Gifford Film Reference biography|publisher=Filmreference.com|date=|accessdate=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gifford grew up in [[Bowie, Maryland]], and attended [[Bowie High School (Maryland)|Bowie High School]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Daily News&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/gossip/1996/05/13/1996-05-13_kathie_lee_s_high-school_cla.html|title=Daily News|accessdate=2009-02-19|author=George Rush and Joanna Molloy|quote=|location=New York|date=1996-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; During high school, Gifford was a singer in a [[folk music|folk]] group, &quot;Pennsylvania Next Right,&quot; which performed frequently at school assemblies. During her senior year at high school she dated and went to the prom with [[Michael Bray]], who would later become an anti-abortion activist who was convicted for acts of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;Juergensmeyer, M., &quot;Soldiers for Christ&quot;, ''Terror in the Mind of God'', p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; After high school graduation, Gifford attended [[Oral Roberts University]] in [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]], studying drama and music.

Gifford's paternal grandfather was of [[Russians|Russian]] [[Jew]]ish descent and her paternal grandmother was of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] ancestry. Her mother, a relative of writer [[Rudyard Kipling]], was of [[French Canadian]], [[English people|English]] and [[Germans|German]] descent and was raised in a [[snake handler]] family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=OuECAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=%22Her+grandfather,+Meyer+Epstein,+was+a+snake-charmer+and+carnival+barker%22&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Her%20grandfather%2C%20Meyer%20Epstein%2C%20was%20a%20snake-charmer%20and%20carnival%20barker%22&amp;f=false |title=New York Magazine - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date=1996-07-22 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldcat.org/wcpa/servlet/DCARead?standardNo=9780345512062&amp;standardNoType=1&amp;excerpt=true |title=Just When I Thought I'd Dropped My Last Egg |publisher=Worldcat.org |date=2007-11-16 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After seeing the [[Billy Graham (evangelist)|Billy Graham]]-produced film, ''The Restless Ones'' at age 12, Gifford became a [[born-again Christian]]. She told interviewer [[Larry King]], &quot;I was raised with many Jewish traditions and raised to be very grateful for my Jewish heritage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0005/11/lkl.00.html &quot;What's Next for Kathie Lee?&quot;], ''Transcripts.cnn.com''&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother, Rev. David Paul Epstein, is an [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Baptist]] preacher and pastor of [[Calvary Baptist Church (Manhattan, New York)|Calvary Baptist Church]] in [[New York City]].

==1970s==
In 1970, Gifford represented Maryland in [[America's Junior Miss]] Pageant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800206733/bio Kathie Lee Gifford profile at Yahoo! Movies]&lt;/ref&gt;

During one summer in the early 1970s, she was a live-in secretary/babysitter for [[Anita Bryant]] at her home in [[Miami]]. Gifford's career took off in the 1970s (during her first marriage to Christian [[composer]]/[[Arrangement|arranger]]/[[Record producer|producer]]/publisher Paul Johnson) as a vocalist on the game show ''[[Name That Tune]]'' with [[Tom Kennedy (television presenter)|Tom Kennedy]] (she performed the &quot;sing a tune&quot; segment as Kathie Lee Johnson). In 1978, she joined the cast of the short-lived ''[[Hee Haw]]'' spinoff, ''Hee Haw Honeys''.

She also appeared in television advertisements for [[Carnival Cruise Lines]] beginning in 1984.

==''Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee''==
Following her divorce from Johnson in 1983, Gifford met sports commentator [[Frank Gifford]] (born August 16, 1930) during an episode of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Good Morning America]]''; the couple married in 1986. By that time, she was several months into her most famous television role, as a full-time morning talk show personality. On June 24, 1985, she replaced Ann Abernathy as co-host of ''The Morning Show'' on [[WABC-TV]] with [[Regis Philbin]]. The program went into national broadcast in 1988 as ''[[Live! with Regis and Kathie Lee]]'', and Gifford became well-known across the country. Throughout the 1990s, millions of morning-TV viewers watched her descriptions of life at home with her sportscaster husband and their two children: Cody Newton Gifford (born in 1990) and Cassidy Erin Gifford (born in 1993). She appeared as a spokesperson for [[Slim Fast]] diet shakes after Cody was born. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} She was also the face of Carnival Cruises in the late 1980s and early 1990s, singing &quot;If my friends could see me now!&quot;

===1996 sweatshop scandal===
In 1996, the [[National Labor Committee in Support of Human and Worker Rights|National Labor Committee]], a [[human rights]] group, reported that [[sweatshop]] labor was used to make clothes for the Kathie Lee line, sold at [[Wal-Mart]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/30/AR2005073001413_pf.html &quot;The Man Who Made Kathie Lee Cry&quot;, ''Washington Post'', July 31, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The group reported that a worker in [[Honduras]] smuggled a piece of clothing out of the factory, which had a Kathie Lee label on it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americas.org/bookstore/category_5006_product_2607 &quot;Zoned for Slavery: The Child Behind the Label&quot;, 1995; a Crowning Rooster Production]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the workers, Wendy Diaz, came to the United States to testify about the conditions under which she worked. She commented, &quot;I wish I could talk to [Kathie Lee]. If she's good, she will help us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2003/07/ma_447_01.html|title=Keeper of the Fire|publisher=Motherjones.com|date=|accessdate=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Labor activist [[Charles Kernaghan]] spoke to the media and accused Gifford of being responsible for the sweatshop management activity. Gifford addressed Kernaghan's allegations on the air during ''Live'', explaining that she was not involved with hands-on project management in factories.&lt;ref&gt;[http://66.244.199.219/CKUA_Archives/eng/archive/news_gifford.aspx Kathie Lee Gifford's clothing line and its connection to sweatshop work]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gifford later contacted Federal authorities to investigate the issue and worked with U.S. Federal legislative and executive branch agencies to support and enact laws to protect children against sweat shop conditions. She appeared with President [[Bill Clinton]] at the [[White House]] in support of the government's initiatives to counter international sweatshop abuses.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

==Current career==
Since ''Live'', Gifford has made guest appearances in films and television series, and has several independently released albums on [[compact disc|CD]], including 2000's ''The Heart of a Woman'', featuring the single &quot;Love Never Fails&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Love Never Fails video on [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l3m812cQ4d0 YouTube]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/Love-Never-Fails/dp/B000VZRBOW Amazon.com website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005 she became a special correspondent on ''[[The Insider (television show)|The Insider]]'', a syndicated entertainment magazine television show, ending her relationship with that program upon her co-hosting role with ''Today''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tv.com/story/544.html &quot;Kathie Lee Gifford lands role on ''The Insider''&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

She played the role of Miss Hannigan in a concert performance of ''[[Annie (musical)|Annie]]'' at [[Madison Square Garden]] in December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://broadwayworld.com/article/Kathie_Lee_Gifford_is_Miss_Hannigan_in_MSG_Annie_20061012 &quot;Kathie Lee Gifford plays Miss Hannigan in MSG production of ''Annie''&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, 2008, NBC announced that Gifford was to join its morning show, ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'', as co-host of the fourth hour, alongside [[Hoda Kotb]]. This marked her return to morning television; in many markets, she now airs directly after her old show, now called ''[[Live! with Kelly and Michael]]''. Because the fourth hour of ''Today'' airs live at 10:00am ET, and ''Live! with Kelly and Michael'' airs live at 9:00am ET, Gifford's hour does not compete directly with her former show in most markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/23871853|title=Kathie Lee Gifford returns to morning TV at ''Today''|publisher=Today.msnbc.msn.com|date=2008-03-31|accessdate=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kotb and Gifford replaced [[Ann Curry]] and [[Natalie Morales]]. The show's ratings decreased after Gifford's arrival, having drawn 1.9 million viewers the weeks before her arrival and 1.7 million a few months after, although the network maintains that the drop in viewers was seasonal and unrelated to the on-air talent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/11/business/11today.html?adxnnl=1&amp;adxnnlx=1218467024-ykRhEu4bWKe7KMx4jf4Ugg &quot;Forthright or Clueless? Kathie Lee Draws Fire&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  More recently, the 4th hour of ''Today'' has averaged 2.148 million total viewers, an increase of 26 percent over those 2008 numbers. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcumv.com/mediavillage/networks/nbcnews/today/pressreleases?pr=contents/press-releases/2011/03/31/todayrtgswin1301594221263.xml &quot;TODAY is the No. 1 Morning Program for 797 Weeks Straight and Counting&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

She is a recipient of the [[Mousecar]] Award (as in &quot;Oscar&quot;), a silver Mickey Mouse statue award that was personally designed by [[Walt Disney]] himself. The award was presented personally by [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], [[Michael Eisner]], who said that only five had been given out previously.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/entertainment/2000/07/29/2000-07-29_the_long_goodbye_is_over.html|title=The Long Goodbye Is Over|publisher=Nydailynews.com|date=2000-07-29|accessdate=2009-12-16|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2010, she guest starred on ''[[The Suite Life on Deck]]'', along with her real-life daughter, Cassidy.

Gifford is a celebrity ambassador for the non-profit organization [[Childhelp]]. She regularly makes appearances at fund raisers and events for the child abuse prevention and treatment organization and is an ardent supporter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/community/scottsdale/articles/2009/01/02/20090102sr-shocket0103.html &quot;Childhelp goes Hollywood for fundraiser&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank and Kathie Lee Gifford raised the money to build and continue to financially support two shelters in [[New York City]] for babies born with [[HIV]] or a congenital [[crack cocaine]] addiction. These shelters were named in honor of her children, Cody and Cassidy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kathieleegifford.com/lamb04/charity/abccharity.php|title=Charities, Assoc. to Benefit Children|publisher=KathieLeeGifford.com|date=2008-11-04|accessdate=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 1, 2008, Gifford appeared on NBC's ''[[Celebrity Family Feud]]''. She and her friends and family competed against the cast of ''[[Dog The Bounty Hunter]]'' for their favorite charity. Gifford's family won the $50,000 for The Association to Benefit Children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/2008/06/23/2008-06-23_kathie_lee_gifford_other_celebs_fuel_al_.html|title=Kathie Lee Gifford, other celebs fuel Al Roker's 'Celebrity Family Feud'|publisher=Nydailynews.com|date=2008-06-22|accessdate=2009-12-16|location=New York|first=Cristina|last=Kinon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Musical theatre==
In the late 1990s, Gifford began working in musical theatre. She contributed a number of musical numbers to ''Hats'', and wrote and produced ''Under The Bridge'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kathieleegifford.com/lamb04/messages/6706mesg.php |title=Under The Bridge |publisher=KathieLeeGifford.com |date=2008-11-04 |accessdate=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; based upon the children's book ''The Family Under The Bridge'' by Natalie Savage Carlson.

In 2007, she premiered ''[[Saving Aimee (musical)|Saving Aimee]]'', a stage musical about evangelist [[Aimee McPherson]], at the [[Signature Theatre (Arlington VA)|Signature Theatre]] in [[Arlington, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kathieleegifford.com/lamb04/messages/sablog.php|title=Saving Aimee|publisher=KathieLeeGifford.com|date=2007-05-15|accessdate=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/24/AR2007042402428.html|title=Kathie Lee Gifford's Leap of Faith|publisher=washingtonpost.com|date=2007-04-25|accessdate=2009-12-16|first=Jane|last=Horwitz}}&lt;/ref&gt; The premiere starred [[Tony Award|Tony]]-nominated actress [[Carolee Carmello]] in the lead role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/107157.html &quot;Carmello Is Famed Evangelist in Kathie Lee Gifford's Saving Aimee Musical&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 16, 2007, Gifford was a guest presenter at the Washington, DC [[Helen Hayes Award]] Ceremony, honoring contributions and professional accomplishments in theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonian.com/blogarticles/Arts%20&amp;%20Events/afterhours/3930.html Celebrating the Stars at the Helen Hayes Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Gifford and [[David Friedman (composer)|David Friedman]] wrote a junior high school musical entitled ''Key Pin It Real''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allday.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/04/21/929229.aspx|title=Kathie Lee: At home on TODAY|publisher=Allday.msnbc.msn.com|date=|accessdate=2009-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play depicts a coming-of-age story about a young girl named Key Pin. The first production took place in December 2008 in [[Kendallville, Indiana]] at [[East Noble High School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tradingmarkets.com/.site/news/Stock%20News/1987797 www.tradingmarkets.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gifford is currently working on a musical adaptation of ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'' with [[John McDaniel (musician)|John McDaniel]]; McDaniel is composing music while Gifford is writing lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stlmag.com/St-Louis-Magazine/June-2011/Meet-John-McDaniel-Director-of-Opera-Theatre-of-Saint-Louis-039-The-Daughter-of-the-Regiment/# |title=Meet John McDaniel, Director of Opera Theatre of Saint Louis' The Daughter of the Regiment - St. Louis Magazine - June 2011 - St. Louis, Missouri |publisher=Stlmag.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
