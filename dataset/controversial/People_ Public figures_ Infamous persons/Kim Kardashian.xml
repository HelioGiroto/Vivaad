Sanford Siegal, the creator of the [[Cookie diet|Cookie Diet]], sued Kardashian, claiming she [[defamation|defamed]] him on Twitter. According to Siegal, Kardashian tweeted in October 2009 that he was &quot;falsely promoting&quot; that she was on the cookie diet. Siegal filed a claim in a Florida state court claiming the statements are false and defamatory. He also alleges that Kardashian was on QuickTrim's payroll when she posted the tweet. Kardashian's tweet appears to stem from an article on CookieDiet.com, that named Kardashian as one of many celebrities who saw positive results on the diet. Kardashian sent a cease-and-desist order to Siegal, demanding the link be removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Gina DiNunno | title=Kim Kardashian Sued by Cookie Diet Doc Over a Tweet| url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Kim-Kardashian-Sued-1013430.aspx| work=TVGuide.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Kardashian sparked controversy over the way she held a cat for a photograph.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/04/20/entertainment/main6414472.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Kim Kardashian Sparks Controversy Over Cat Photo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, animal rights organization [[PETA]] criticized Kardashian for repeatedly wearing fur coats, and named her as one of the five worst people or organizations of 2010 when it came to animal welfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=PETA Has Bone To Pick With Kim Kardashian |publisher=[[Popcrunch]] | date =November 17, 2010 | url =http://www.popcrunch.com/peta-has-bone-to-pick-with-kim-kardashian/ |accessdate=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, ''[[The Guardian]]'' commented on her ability to attract payments of up to US$10,000 from sponsors for each [[Twitter|tweet]] that she broadcasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |date=June 6, 2011 |page=2 (G2 section) |title=Repair the finances}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, Kardashian filmed a music video for a song titled &quot;[[Jam (Turn It Up)]]&quot;.  The video was directed by [[Hype Williams]]; [[Kanye West]] makes a cameo in the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/2010/12/29/kim-kardashian-music-video-with-kanye-west-hype-williams-the-dream-shoot/?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter |title=Kim Kardashian Locks Down Kanye for Music Video |publisher=TMZ.com |date=December 29, 2010 |accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kardashian premiered the song during a New Year's Eve party at TAO Las Vegas on December 31, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rap-up.com/2011/01/02/kim-kardashian-debuts-the-dream-penned-single-in-vegas/ |title=Kim Kardashian Debuts The-Dream-Penned Single in Vegas |publisher=Rap-Up.com |accessdate=July 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song was produced by [[The-Dream]] and [[Christopher Stewart (music producer)|Tricky Stewart]]. When asked if an album is in the works, Kardashian replied, &quot;There's no album in the works or anything—just one song we did for ''[[Kourtney and Kim Take New York]]'', and a video Hype Williams directed, half of the proceeds we're giving away to a cancer foundation, because The-Dream's and one of my parents passed away from cancer.

Kardashian's 2010 earnings were the highest among Hollywood-based reality stars, being estimated at $6&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;Dorian, John. &quot;[http://au.ibtimes.com/articles/89368/20101207/kim-kardashian-top-earning-reality-star-for-year-2010.htm Kim Kardashian top-earning reality star for year 2010]&quot;.

Kardashian has supported the recognition of the [[Armenian Genocide]] on numerous occasions and has encouraged [[Barack Obama]] and the [[United States government]] to consider its acknowledgement. On April 21, 2011, a few days before the 96th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, she wrote about the issue on her blog in an effort to put it under spotlight and also sent a tweet to her fans urging [[Armenian Genocide recognition|its recognition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=‘Time to Recognize the Armenian Genocide,’ Says Kim Kardashian |publisher=[[Asbarez]] | date =April 21, 2011 | url =http://asbarez.com/95342/kim-kardashian-blogs-tweets-about-obama-protest-%E2%80%98national-day-of-prayer%E2%80%99/ |accessdate=May 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kardashian began dating NBA player [[Kris Humphries]] of the [[New Jersey Nets]] in October 2010. They became engaged in May 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1673479/kim-kardashian-kris-humphries-timeline.jhtml?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+MTVNewsLatest+%28MTV+News+Latest+Headlines%29|title=Kim Kardashian And Kris Humphries: A Timeline|first=Jocelyn |last=Vena |date=October 31, 2011 |accessdate=October 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and married on August 20, 2011, in [[Montecito, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20521390,00.html |title=Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries Are Married!|first=Jennifer |last=Garcia |date=August 20, 2011 |accessdate=August 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A two-part TV special showing the preparations and the wedding itself aired on ''E!'' in early October 2011, amidst what the ''Washington Post'' called a &quot;media blitz&quot; related to the wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/celebritology/post/kim-kardashian-wedding-special-to-air-this-sunday-will-you-watch-video/2011/10/07/gIQATLFQTL_blog.html |title=Kim Kardashian wedding special to air this Sunday: Will you watch?|first=Sarah Anne |last=Hughes |date=October 7, 2011 |accessdate=December 2, 2011 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After 72 days of marriage, Kardashian filed for divorce from Humphries on October 31, 2011, citing irreconcilable differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kim Kardashian to file for divorce from Kris Humphries|url=http://www.tmz.com/2011/10/31/kim-kardashian-divorce-kris-humphries-files/|work=TMZ.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After filing for the divorce, Kardashian asked the court to order Humphries to pay his own legal expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kim Kardashian Divorcing Kris Humphries and Doesn’t Want to Pay His Attorney Fees | url=http://www.louislsternberglaw.com/wordpress/2011/10/31/kim-kardashian-divorcing-kris-humphries-pay-counsel-fees/|accessdate=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 1, 2011, Humphries filed his response to Kardashian's petition, requesting an annulment on the grounds of fraud or if the court will not grant an annulment, a decree of legal separation rather than Kardashian's requested divorce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kris Humphries' Annulment Filing: Read It Here Now!|url=http://ca.eonline.com/news/kris_humphries_annulment_filing_read_it/277969|publisher=E Online |date=December 1, 2011 |accessdate=December 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several news outlets have surmised that Kardashian's marriage to Humphries was merely a publicity stunt to promote the Kardashian family's brand and their subsequent television ventures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Was Kardashian marriage a sham?|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/video/breaking/chi-video-was-kim-kardashian-marriage-divorce-a-sham-20111101,0,7143953.htmlstory|work=Chicago Tribune |date=November 1, 2011 |accessdate=November 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her former publicist has also claimed that her short-lived wedding was indeed staged and a ploy to generate money. Kardashian has since filed suit against him, saying his claims were untrue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/11/14/kim-kardashian-suing-ex-publicist-jonathan-jaxson_n_1092652.html |work=Huffington Post | first=Stephanie | last=Marcus | title=Kim Kardashian Suing Ex-Publicist Jonathan Jaxson | date=November 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A widely circulated petition asking to remove all Kardashian related programing off the air has been followed since their split.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2011/11/thousands-sign-no-more-kardashian-petition/ |title=Thousands Sign ‘No More Kardashian’ Petition – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2011-11-16 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, Kardashian and her sisters Kourtney and Khloe were named in a $5 million class action lawsuit against QuickTrim, the weight loss supplement they endorse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2012/03/kardashian-sisters-sued-over-endorsement-of-weight-loss-product/ |title=Kardashian Sisters Sued over Endorsement of Weight-Loss Product – ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2012-03-05 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complaint, filed in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York]], accuses the Kardashians (along with QuickTrim’s manufacturer, Windmill Health Products; the retailer GNC; and others in the sales and marketing chain) of false and deceptive marketing of the diet aid. The plaintiffs, hailing from several states, brought claims under their respective states’ consumer protection laws.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=In Time for Bikini Season, Kardashians Face Lawsuit Over Endorsement of Diet Aids  |url= http://www.natlawreview.com/article/time-bikini-season-kardashians-face-lawsuit-over-endorsement-diet-aids|publisher=Ifrah Law |work=The National Law Review|date=2012-07-08|accessdate=2012-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
