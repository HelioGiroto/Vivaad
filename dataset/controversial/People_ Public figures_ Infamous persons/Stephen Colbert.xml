'''Stephen Tyrone Colbert''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|k|oʊ|l|ˈ|b|ɛər}} or {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|l|b|ər|t}};&lt;ref name=&quot;dowd&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--talks about how he changed the pronunciation of his name on p 6--&gt; born May 13, 1964) is an American [[political satire|political satirist]], [[writer]], [[comedian]], [[presenter|television host]], and [[actor]]. He is the host of [[Comedy Central]]'s ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', a [[fake news|satirical news show]] in which Colbert portrays a [[Stephen Colbert (character)|caricatured version]] of [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Pundit (expert)|political pundits]].

Colbert originally studied to be an actor, but became interested in [[improvisational theatre]] when he met famed [[The Second City|Second City]] director [[Del Close]] while attending [[Northwestern University]]. He first performed professionally as an [[understudy]] for [[Steve Carell]] at [[The Second City|Second City]] [[Chicago]]; among his troupe mates were comedians [[Paul Dinello]] and [[Amy Sedaris]], with whom he developed the critically acclaimed sketch comedy series ''[[Exit 57]]''.

Colbert also wrote and performed on the short-lived ''[[The Dana Carvey Show|Dana Carvey Show]]'' before collaborating with Sedaris and Dinello again on the cult television series ''[[Strangers with Candy]]''. He gained considerable attention for his role on the latter as closeted gay history teacher [[Strangers with Candy characters#Mr. Charles “Chuck” Noblet|Chuck Noblet]]. It was his work as a correspondent on [[Comedy Central]]'s news-parody series ''[[The Daily Show]]'', however, that first introduced him to a wide audience.

In 2005, he left ''The Daily Show with Jon Stewart'' to host a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series, ''[[The Colbert Report]]''. Following ''The Daily Show's'' news-parody concept, ''The Colbert Report'' is a parody of personality-driven political opinion shows such as ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''. Since its debut, the series has established itself as one of Comedy Central's highest-rated series, earning Colbert three [[Emmy Award]] nominations and an invitation to perform as featured entertainer at the [[Stephen Colbert at the 2006 White House Correspondents' Association Dinner|White House Correspondents' Association Dinner]] in 2006. Colbert was named one of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'s'' [[Time 100|100 most influential people]] in 2006 and 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;time100&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1975813_1975838_1976306,00.html|title = Stephen Colbert - The 2006 TIME 100 - TIME|author=Brian Williams|publisher = ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date = May 8, 2006|accessdate = July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;time100-1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2111975_2111976_2111953,00.html|title= Stephen Colbert - 2012 TIME 100: The Most Influential People in the World - TIME|author=Garry Trudeau|publisher = ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date = April 16, 2012|accessdate = July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; His book ''[[I Am America (And So Can You!)]]'' was No. 1 on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].

Many of his ancestors immigrated to [[North America]] from [[Ireland]] in the 1800s before and during the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Famine]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Faces&quot;&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wnet/facesofamerica/profiles/stephen-colbert/11/ &quot;Faces of America: Stephen Colbert&quot;], PBS, ''[[Faces of America (PBS series)|Faces of America]]'' series, with Professor [[Henry Louis Gates|Henry Louis Gates, Jr.]], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pedigree&quot;&gt;[http://colbert.ancestortree.net/pedigree.php &quot;Pedigree of Stephen Colbert&quot;], Ancestor Tree.

His father, James William Colbert, Jr., was the vice president for academic affairs at the [[Medical University of South Carolina]]. His mother, Lorna Colbert (née Tuck), was a homemaker.&lt;ref name=&quot;Faces&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;web2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Family &amp; Education|publisher=Medical University of South Carolina Library|year=2009|url=http://www.library.musc.edu/exhibits/colbert/EarlyYears.php|format=|accessdate=February 17, 2010}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews, Colbert describes his parents as devout people who also strongly value [[intellectual]]ism and taught their children that it was possible to question the Church and still be [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]].&lt;ref name=TimeOut&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.timeout.com/newyork/DetailsAr.do?file=hotseat/506/506.hotseat.html|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060820014908/http://www.timeout.com/newyork/DetailsAr.do?file=hotseat/506/506.hotseat.html|archivedate = August 20, 2006|title = Joyce Words|first = David|last = Cote|publisher = ''[[Time Out (company)|Time Out New York]]''|date = June 9, 2005|accessdate = July 30, 2008}} Via the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis his family placed on intelligence and his observation of negative stereotypes of [[American South|Southerners]] led Colbert to train himself to suppress his [[Southern American English|Southern accent]] while he was still quite young. As a child, he observed that [[Southern United States|Southerners]] were often depicted as being less intelligent than other characters on scripted television; to avoid that stereotype, he taught himself to imitate [[General American|the speech]] of American [[news presenter|news anchors]].&lt;ref name=&quot;freshair1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4464017|title = A Fake Newsman's Fake Newsman: Stephen Colbert|first = Terry|last = Gross|authorlink= Terry Gross|work= [[Fresh Air]]|publisher = [[National Public Radio]]|date = January 24, 2005|accessdate = July 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;60minutes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/27/60minutes/main1553506.shtml|title = The Colbert Report: Morley Safer Profiles Comedy Central's 'Fake' Newsman|first = Morley|last = Safer|authorlink= Morley Safer|publisher = [[60 Minutes]]|date = August 13, 2006|accessdate =August 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colbert sometimes comedically claims his surname is [[French people|French]], but his family is actually of [[Irish people|Irish]], [[English people|English]], and distant German descent.&lt;ref name=&quot;dowd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gatesref&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Gagnon|first=Geoffrey|coauthors=|title=Top of Mind: Extended Q &amp; A with Henry Louis Gates Jr.|pages=|publisher=Boston|year=2010|url=http://www.bostonmagazine.com/articles/skipgates/page2|accessdate=February 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, the name was pronounced {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|oʊ|l|b|ər|t}} in English; Stephen Colbert's father, James, wanted to pronounce the name {{IPAc-en|k|oʊ|l|ˈ|b|ɛər}}, but maintained the {{IPA|/ˈkoʊlbərt/}} pronunciation out of respect for his own father. However, James offered his children the option to pronounce the name whichever way they preferred.&lt;ref name=&quot;charlestonian&quot;/&gt; Stephen started using {{IPA|/koʊlˈbɛər/}} later in life when he transferred to [[Northwestern University]], taking advantage of the opportunity to reinvent himself in a new place where no one knew him.&lt;ref name=&quot;dowd&quot;/&gt; Stephen's brother Ed, an intellectual property attorney, retained {{IPA|/ˈkoʊlbərt/}}; this was shown in a February 12, 2009 appearance on ''The Colbert Report'', when his youngest brother asked him, &quot;{{IPA|/ˈkoʊlbərt/}} or {{IPA|/koʊlˈbɛər/}}?&quot; Ed responded &quot;{{IPA|/ˈkoʊlbərt/}}&quot;, to which Stephen jokingly replied, &quot;See you in Hell&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/218732/february-12-2009/obama-poster-debate---david-ross-and-ed-colbert|title = Obama Poster Debate&amp;nbsp;– David Ross and Ed Colbert|publisher = [[The Colbert Report]]|date = February 12, 2009|accessdate = February 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11, 1974, when Colbert was ten years old, his father and two of his brothers, Peter and Paul, were killed in the crash of [[Eastern Air Lines Flight 212]] while it was attempting to land in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]. They were en route to enroll the two boys at [[Canterbury School (Connecticut)|Canterbury School]] in [[New Milford, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=25questions/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title = Obituaries|publisher = Washington Post|date = September 14, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly thereafter, Lorna Colbert relocated the family downtown to the more urban environment of East Bay Street in [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]]. By his own account, Colbert found the transition difficult and did not easily make new friends in his new neighborhood.&lt;ref name=&quot;charlestonian&quot;/&gt; Colbert later described himself during this time as detached, lacking a sense of importance regarding the things with which other children concerned themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;60minutes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ign&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/433/433111p1.html|title = An Interview with Stephen Colbert|first = Ken|last = P.|publisher = IGN|date =August 11, 2003|accessdate = July 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He developed a love of [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] novels, especially the works of [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], of which he remains an avid fan. During his adolescence, he also developed an intense interest in fantasy [[role-playing game]]s, especially ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;ign&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gamespy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pc.gamespy.com/pc/dungeons-dragons-online/537989p1.html|title = Stephen Colbert on D&amp;D|first = Allen|last = Rausch|publisher = [[GameSpy]]|date = August 17, 2004|accessdate = July 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; a pastime which he later characterized as an early experience in acting and [[improvisation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub&quot;/&gt;

Colbert attended Charleston's [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] [[Porter-Gaud School]], where he participated in several school plays and contributed to the school newspaper but, by his own assessment, was not highly motivated academically.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign&quot;/&gt; During his adolescence, he briefly fronted a [[Rolling Stones]] [[cover band]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Daly|first=Steven|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/3673509/Stephen-Colbert-the-second-most-powerful-idiot-in-America.html|title= Stephen Colbert: the second most powerful idiot in America&amp;nbsp;– Page 3|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=May 18, 2008|accessdate=May 18, 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; called &lt;i&gt;A Shot in the Dark&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen Colbert's Most Meaningful Musical Moments|url=http://www.npr.org/2012/10/24/163547250/stephen-colberts-most-meaningful-musical-moments|work=Fresh Air|publisher=NPR|accessdate=10/25/12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When he was younger, he had hoped to study [[marine biology]], but surgery intended to repair a severely [[perforated eardrum]] caused him inner ear damage. The damage was severe enough that he was unable to pursue a career that would involve [[scuba diving]].

There he continued to participate in plays while studying mainly [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ballots&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ign&quot;/&gt; He found the curriculum rigorous, but was more focused than he had been in high school and was able to apply himself to his studies. Despite the lack of a significant theater community at Hampden-Sydney, Colbert's interest in acting escalated during this time. After two years, he transferred to [[Northwestern University]] as a Theater Major to study performance, emboldened by the realization that he loved performing, even when no one was coming to shows.&lt;ref name=ign/&gt;

==Early career in comedy==
[[File:Time 100 Stephen Colbert and wife.jpg|thumb|Stephen Colbert and his wife Evelyn McGee-Colbert at the 2006 [[Time 100]]]]
While at Northwestern, Colbert studied with the intent of becoming a dramatic actor; mostly he performed in experimental plays and was uninterested in comedy. He began performing improvisation while in college, both in the campus improv team No Fun Mud Piranhas&lt;ref name=&quot;northwestern-magazine&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.northwestern.edu/magazine/winter2010/feature/the-real-stephen-colbert.html|title = The Real Stephen Colbert|publisher = Northwestern Magazine|accessdate = 2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[Annoyance Theatre]] in Chicago as a part of [[Del Close]]'s [[I.O.|ImprovOlympic]] at a time when the project was focused on competitive, long form [[improvisation]], rather than improvisational comedy. &quot;I wasn't gonna do [[The Second City|Second City]]&quot;, Colbert later recalled, &quot;because those Annoyance people looked down on Second City because they thought it wasn't pure improv—there was a slightly snobby, mystical quality to the Annoyance people&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub&quot;/&gt; After Colbert graduated in 1986, however, he was in need of a job.  A friend who was employed at Second City's box office offered him work answering phones and selling souvenirs.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign&quot;/&gt; Colbert accepted and discovered that Second City employees were entitled to take classes at their training center for free.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub&quot;/&gt; Despite his earlier aversion to the comedy group, he signed up for improvisation classes and enjoyed the experience greatly.

Shortly thereafter, he was hired to perform with Second City's touring company, initially as an understudy for [[Steve Carell]]. It was there he met [[Amy Sedaris]] and [[Paul Dinello]], with whom he often collaborated later in his career. By their retelling, the three comedians did not get along at first—Dinello thought Colbert was uptight, pretentious and cold, while Colbert thought of Dinello as &quot;an illiterate thug&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wiggingout&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title = Wigging Out|first = Darel|last = Jevens|publisher = [[Chicago Sun-Times]]|date = April 27, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;—but the trio became close friends while touring together, discovering that they shared a similar comic sensibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign&quot;/&gt;

When Sedaris and Dinello were offered the opportunity to create a television series for [[HBO Downtown Productions]], Colbert left The Second City and relocated to [[New York]] in order to work with them on the sketch comedy show ''[[Exit 57]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign&quot;/&gt; The series debuted on [[Comedy Central]] in 1995 and aired through 1996. Although it lasted for only 12 episodes, the show received favorable reviews&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Critic's Corner|first = Matt|last = Roush|publisher = [[USA TODAY]]|date = August 18, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = The new skitcoms: Sketches of pain|first = David|last = Lipsky|publisher = Rolling Stone|date = January 21, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for five [[CableACE Award]]s in 1995, in categories including best writing, performance, and comedy series.&lt;ref name=&quot;ccbio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/news_team/correspondents/stephen_colbert.jhtml|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20051026174626/http://www.comedycentral.com/shows/the_daily_show/news_team/correspondents/stephen_colbert.jhtml|archivedate = October 26, 2005|title = Biography of Stephen Colbert at ''The Daily Show'' official website|publisher = [[Comedy Central]]|accessdate = July 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the cancellation of ''Exit 57'', Colbert worked for six months as a cast member and writer on ''[[The Dana Carvey Show]]'', alongside former Second City castmate Steve Carell, as well as [[Robert Smigel]], [[Charlie Kaufman]], [[Louis C.K.]], and [[Dino Stamatopoulos]], among others. The series, described by one reviewer as &quot;[[kamikaze]] satire&quot; in &quot;borderline-questionable taste&quot;, had sponsors pull out after its first episode aired and was cancelled after seven episodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;saloncarvey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.salon.com/09/reviews/carvey1.html|title = Dana Carvey bites the hand that feeds him|first = Joyce|last = Millman|publisher = [[Salon.com]]|date = February 15, 1996|accessdate = November 25, 2006|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061125183623/http://www.salon.com/09/reviews/carvey1.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate = November 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert then worked briefly as a freelance writer for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' with Robert Smigel. Smigel brought his animated sketch, ''[[The Ambiguously Gay Duo]]'', to ''SNL'' from ''The Dana Carvey Show''; Colbert provided the voice of Ace on both series, opposite Steve Carell as Gary. Needing money, he also worked as a script consultant for [[VH1]] and [[MTV]], before taking a job filming humorous correspondent segments for ''[[Good Morning America]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign&quot;/&gt; Only two of the segments he proposed were ever produced and only one aired, but the job led his agent to refer him to ''[[The Daily Show]]'s'' then-producer, [[Madeline Smithberg]], who hired Colbert on a trial basis in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediabistro&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mediabistro.com/articles/cache/a238.asp|title = So What Do You Do, Stephen Colbert?|first = Jacqueline|last = Schneider|publisher = [http://www.mediabistro.com/ Mediabistro.com]|date = May 6, 2003|accessdate = July 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television career==
===''Strangers with Candy''===
{{main|Strangers with Candy}}

During the same time frame, Colbert worked again with Sedaris and Dinello to develop a new comedy series for Comedy Central, ''[[Strangers with Candy]]''. Comedy Central picked up the series in 1998 after Colbert had already begun working on ''The Daily Show''. As a result he accepted a reduced role, filming only around twenty ''Daily Show'' segments a year while he worked on the new series.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign&quot;/&gt;

''Strangers with Candy'' was conceived of as a parody of [[after school special]]s, following the life of [[Strangers with Candy characters#Geraldine &quot;Jerri&quot; Antonia Blank|Jerri Blank]], a 46-year-old [[Dropping out|dropout]] who returns to finish [[high school]] after 32 years of life on the street. Most noted by critics for its use of offensive humor, it concluded each episode by delivering to the audience a skewed, politically incorrect moral lesson.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvgswc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Review—Strangers With Candy|first = Ken|last = Fox|publisher = [[TV Guide]]|url = http://movies.tvguide.com/strangers-candy/review/281396|accessdate = July 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert served as a main writer alongside Sedaris and Dinello, as well as portraying Jerri's strict but uninformed history teacher, [[Strangers with Candy characters#Mr. Charles &quot;Chuck&quot; Noblet|Chuck Noblet]], seen throughout the series dispensing inaccurate information to his classes. Colbert has likened this to the character he played on ''The Daily Show'' and later ''The Colbert Report'', claiming that he has a very specific niche in portraying &quot;poorly informed, high-status idiot&quot; characters.&lt;ref name=&quot;25questions&quot;/&gt; Another running joke throughout the series was that Noblet, a [[The closet|closeted homosexual]], was having a &quot;secret&quot; affair with fellow teacher [[Strangers with Candy characters#Geoffrey Jellineck|Geoffrey Jellineck]] despite the fact that their relationship was apparent to everyone around them. This obliviousness also appears in Colbert's ''Daily Show'' and ''Colbert Report'' character.

Thirty episodes of ''Strangers with Candy'' were made, which aired on Comedy Central in 1999 and 2000. Though its ratings were not remarkable during its initial run, it has been characterized as a cult show with a small but dedicated audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;ewswc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title = 50 Best TV Shows on DVD|first = Mandi|last = Bierly|publisher = [[Entertainment Weekly]]|date = November 26, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert reprised his role for a [[Strangers with Candy (film)|film adaptation]], which premiered at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] in 2005 and had a limited release in 2006. The film received mixed reviews. Colbert also co-wrote the [[screenplay]] with Sedaris and Dinello.&lt;ref name=&quot;metaswc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Strangers With Candy (2006): Reviews|publisher = [[Metacritic]]|url = http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/strangerswithcandy?q=strangers%20with%20candy|accessdate = July 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Daily Show''===
{{main|The Daily Show}}
Stephen Colbert joined the cast of Comedy Central's parody-news series ''The Daily Show'' in 1997, when the show was in its second season. Originally one of four [[correspondent]]s who filmed segments from remote locations in the style of network news field reporters, Colbert was referred to as &quot;the new guy&quot; on-air for his first two years on the show, during which time [[Craig Kilborn]] served as host. When Kilborn left the show prior to the 1999 season, [[Jon Stewart]] took over hosting duties, also serving as a writer and co-executive producer. From this point, the series gradually began to take on a more political tone and increase in popularity, particularly in the latter part of the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. presidential election]] season. The roles of the show's correspondents were expanded to include more in-studio segments, as well as international reports which were almost always done in the studio with the aid of a [[bluescreen|greenscreen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ign&quot;/&gt;

Unlike Stewart, who essentially hosts ''The Daily Show'' as himself,&lt;ref name=&quot;baldego&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title = The American Bald Ego|first = James|last = Poniewozik|publisher = ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date = November 6, 2005|accessdate = October 30, 2006|url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1126747,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert developed a [[Stephen Colbert (character)|correspondent character]] for his pieces on the series. Colbert has described his correspondent character as &quot;a fool who has spent a lot of his life playing not the fool&amp;nbsp;— one who is able to cover it at least well enough to deal with the subjects that he deals with&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ign&quot;/&gt; Colbert was frequently pitted against knowledgeable interview subjects, or against Stewart in scripted exchanges, with the resultant dialogue demonstrating the character's lack of knowledge of whatever subject he is discussing.&lt;ref name=&quot;steinberg&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ign&quot;/&gt; Colbert also made generous use of humorous [[Fallacy|fallacies of logic]] in explaining his point of view on any topic. Other ''Daily Show'' correspondents have adopted a similar style; former correspondent [[Rob Corddry]] recalls that when he and [[Ed Helms]] first joined the show's cast in 2002, they &quot;just imitated Stephen Colbert for a year or two&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Corddry Interview&quot;/&gt; Correspondent [[Aasif Mandvi]] has stated &quot;I just decided I was going to do my best Stephen Colbert impression&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mandvi&quot;/&gt;

Colbert has appeared in several recurring segments for ''The Daily Show'', including &quot;[[List of The Daily Show recurring segments#Even Stevphen|Even Stevphen]]&quot; with [[Steve Carell]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/340910/july-07-2010/steve-carell|title=Steve Carell&amp;nbsp;— The Colbert Report&amp;nbsp;— July 7, 2010 - Video Clip {{!}} Comedy Central|author=Colbert Nation|publisher=Comedy Central|date=July 7, 2010|accessdate=November 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which both characters were expected to debate a selected topic but instead would unleash their anger at one another. Colbert commonly hosted &quot;[[This Week in God]]&quot;, a report on topics in the news pertaining to religion, presented with the help of the &quot;God Machine&quot;. Colbert filed reports from the floor of the [[Democratic National Convention]] and the [[Republican National Convention]] as a part of ''The Daily Show's'' award-winning coverage of the 2000 and [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 U.S. Presidential elections]]; many from the latter were included as part of their ''[[The Daily Show: Indecision 2004]]'' DVD release. In several episodes of ''The Daily Show'', Colbert filled in as anchor in the absence of Jon Stewart, including the full week of March 3, 2002, when Stewart was scheduled to host ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. After Colbert left the show, [[Rob Corddry]] took over &quot;This Week in God&quot; segments, although a recorded sample of Colbert's voice is still used as the sound effect for the God Machine. Later episodes of ''The Daily Show'' have reused older Colbert segments under the label &quot;Klassic Kolbert&quot;. Colbert won three [[Emmy Award|Emmys]] as a writer of ''The Daily Show'' in 2004, 2005, and 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;emmycolbert&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://comedians.about.com/od/comediansal/p/stephencolbert.htm|title=Stephen Colbert Biography&amp;nbsp;— Biography of Comedian Stephen Colbert|author=Patrick Bromley|publisher=The New York Times Company|accessdate=November 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Colbert Report''===
{{main|The Colbert Report}}
[[File:Colbert report.jpg|thumb|upright|The set of ''The Colbert Report'' satirizes cable-personality political talk shows.]]
[[File:Colbertreport.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Colbert as his television series persona]]
Since October 17, 2005, Colbert has hosted his own television show, ''The Colbert Report'', a ''Daily Show'' spin-off which parodies the conventions of television [[news broadcasting]],&lt;ref name=&quot;freshair1&quot;/&gt; particularly cable-personality political talk shows like ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' and ''[[Glenn Beck]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;avclub&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2006/03/27/060327fa_fact|title = Bill O'Reilly's baroque period.|first = Nicholas|last = Lemann|publisher = [[The New Yorker]]|date = March 27, 2006|accessdate = July 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colbert hosts the show [[Stephen Colbert (character)|in-character]] as a blustery [[Right-wing politics|right-wing]] [[Pundit (expert)|pundit]], generally considered to be an extension of his character on ''The Daily Show''. Conceived by co-creators Stewart, Colbert, and [[Ben Karlin]] in part as an opportunity to explore &quot;the character-driven news&quot;, the series focuses less on the day-to-day news style of the ''Daily Show'', instead frequently concentrating on the foibles of the host-character himself.

The concept for ''The Report'' was first seen in a series of ''Daily Show'' segments which advertised the then-fictional series as a joke. It was later developed by Stewart's [[Busboy Productions]] and pitched to [[Comedy Central]], which [[greenlight]]ed the program; Comedy Central had already been searching for a way to extend the successful ''Daily Show'' franchise beyond a half hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;medialife&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.medialifemagazine.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=121&amp;num=778|title = The wit and sense of 'Colbert Report'|publisher = ''[http://www.medialifemagazine.com/ Media Life]''|first = Toni|last = Fitzgerald|date = October 20, 2005|accessdate = July 11, 2007}}{{dead link|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series opened to strong ratings, averaging 1.2&amp;nbsp;million viewers nightly during its first week on the air. [[Comedy Central]] signed a long-term contract for ''The Colbert Report'' within its first month on the air, when it immediately established itself among the network's highest-rated shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;renewal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b51015_Comedy_Central_Keeps_Colbert.html|first = Charlie|last = Amter|title = Comedy Central Keeps Colbert|publisher = [[E!|E!

Much of Colbert's personal life is reflected in his character on ''The Colbert Report''. With the extended exposure of the character on the show, he often references his interest in and knowledge of [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholicism]], [[science fiction]], and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', as well as using real facts to create his character's history. His alternate persona was also raised in [[South Carolina]], is the youngest of 11 siblings and is married.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colbertnation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Gordon|first=Avery|title=Stephen's bio from Colbertnation.com|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/cn/stephens-bio.php|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080325224351/http://www.colbertnation.com/cn/stephens-bio.php|archivedate=March 25, 2008|publisher = [[Comedy Central]]|accessdate =June 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actual Colbert's career history in acting and comedy, however, is often downplayed.

In July 2012, Colbert added two years to his contract with Comedy Central, extending the run of the Colbert Report until at least the end of 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/07/25/stewart-and-colbert-extend-comedy-central-contracts/?smid=tw-nytimes |title=Stewart and Colbert Extend Comedy Central Contracts - NYTimes.com | work=The New York Times | first=Bill |last=Carter |date=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under his fictional persona in ''The Colbert Report'', Colbert dropped hints of a potential presidential run throughout 2007, with speculation intensifying following the release of his book, ''I Am America (And So Can You!)'', which was rumored to be a sign that he was indeed testing the waters for a future bid for the White House. On October 16, 2007, he announced his candidacy on his show, stating his intention to run both on the [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] and [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] platforms, but only as a &quot;[[favorite son]]&quot; in his native South Carolina.&lt;ref name=&quot;Presidential bid&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url = http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hFzxF7XLwi7Il2DVEE6la0NVo--gD8SB07VO0|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071019004644/http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hFzxF7XLwi7Il2DVEE6la0NVo--gD8SB07VO0|archivedate = October 19, 2007|title = Colbert Announces Presidential Pursuit|agency = Associated Press|date = October 17, 2007|accessdate =October 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later abandoned plans to run as a Republican due to the $35,000 fee required to file for the South Carolina primary,&lt;ref name=&quot;dysfunction&quot;&gt;Starr, Michael (October 18, 2007).

Colbert teamed up with [[Donorschoose.org|DonorsChoose.org]] again in 2008 by asking supporters of [[Barack Obama]] and [[Hillary Clinton]] to do the same. As a lead-up to the Pennsylvania primary, he created a &quot;straw poll that makes a difference&quot;, where people could donate to Pennsylvania classroom projects in honor of their favorite candidate.&lt;ref name=&quot;children&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = Children's Drawings|year = 2009|date = April 8, 2008|url = http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/165029/april-08-2008/children-s-drawings|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Colbert viewers donated $185,000 to projects reaching 43,000 students in Pennsylvania public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Stephen Colbert Joins DonorsChoose.org Board of Directors|url = http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS142637+12-Jan-2009+MW20090112|publisher = reuters.com|date = January 12, 2009|accessdate = April 6, 2009|postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 1, 2007, the South Carolina Democratic Party executive council voted 13–3 to refuse Colbert's application onto the ballot. &quot;The general sense of the council was that he wasn't a serious candidate and that was why he wasn't selected to be on the ballot&quot;, stated John Werner, the party's director. In addition, he was declared &quot;not viable&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/laws11072007.html|title=What We Learned from Stephen Colbert's Presidential Campaign|work=[[Counterpunch.org]]|accessdate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he was only running in one state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1107/6674.html|title=S.C.

One anonymous member of the council told CNN that former State Superintendent of Education [[Inez Tenenbaum]] had placed pressure on them to refuse Colbert's application despite his steady rise in polls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2007/11/06/obama-supporters-pressed-democratic-party-officials-to-keep-colbert-off-ballot/|title=Obama supporters pressed Dems to keep Colbert off ballot|work=[[cnn.com]]|accessdate=April 6, 2009|date=November 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Colbert's real-life presidential campaign had ended, current [[Marvel Comics]] editor-in-chief [[Joe Quesada]] established in an interview on ''The Colbert Report'' that Colbert's campaign was still going strong in the fictional [[Marvel Universe]], citing the cover art of a then-recent issue of ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' which featured a Colbert campaign billboard in the background. Background appearances of Colbert campaign ads continued to appear in Marvel Comics publications, as recently as August 2008's ''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #5 (which also features a [[cameo appearance|cameo]] of an alien [[Skrull]] posing as Colbert). In October 2008, Colbert made an extended 8-page appearance webslinging with Spider-Man in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' issue #573.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Stephen Colbert is a swinger for Marvel|date=September 29, 2008|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2008/09/stephen-colbert.html|first=Geoff|last=Boucher|accessdate=April 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 Congressional testimony===
On September 24, 2010, Colbert testified in character before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, and Border Security. He was invited by committee chairwoman [[Zoe Lofgren]] to describe his experience participating in the [[United Farm Workers]]' &quot;Take Our Jobs&quot; program, where he spent a day working alongside [[migrant workers]] in upstate New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;capitolhill1&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | title = Colbert storms Capitol Hill for migrant workers | first = Alan | last = Silverleib | work = CNN | date = September 24, 2010 | url = http://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/09/24/colbert.house.immigration/?hpt=T2 | accessdate = September 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;capitolhill2&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | title = Stephen Colbert, in GOP pundit character, testifies on immigration in D.C. | first = Dan | last = Zak | work = The Washington Post | date = September 25, 2010 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/24/AR2010092402734.html | accessdate = September 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;capitolhill3&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | title = Stephen Colbert testifies before Congress | work = The Spy Report | publisher = Media Spy | date = September 25, 2010 | url = http://www.mediaspy.org/report/2010/09/25/us-stephen-colbert-testifies-before-congress/ | accessdate = September 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of his often-humorous testimony, Colbert broke character in responding to a question from Rep. [[Judy Chu]], D-CA, and explained his purpose for being at the hearing:

{{cquote2|I like talking about people who don't have any power, and this seems like one of the least powerful people in the United States are migrant workers who come and do our work, but don't have any rights as a result. And yet we still invite them to come here and at the same time ask them to leave. And that's an interesting contradiction to me. And, you know, 'Whatsoever you do for the least of my brothers,' and these seem like the least of our brothers right now...

Democratic committee member [[John Conyers]] questioned whether it was appropriate for the comedian to appear before Congress and asked him to leave the hearing.&lt;ref name=&quot;knowles&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/news/politics/politicalintelligence/2010/09/colbert_asked_t.html|work=The Boston Globe|publisher=New York Times Co.|date=September 24, 2010|accessdate=November 11, 2010|title=Stephen Colbert cracks jokes at Capitol Hill hearing|author=Donovan Stack}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Though Colbert offered to depart at the direction of the committee chairwoman, Lofgren requested that he stay at least until all opening testimony had been completed, whereupon Conyers withdrew his request.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/09/stephen-colbert-testifies-to-congress-today-on-immigration/1|publisher=USA Today On Deadline|date=September 24, 2010|accessdate=May 4, 2011|title=Colbert seriously jokes to Congress about migrant agricultural work|author=Douglas Stanglin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 Washington D.C. rallies===
{{main|Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear}}
In September 2010, following [[Glenn Beck|Glenn Beck's]] ''[[Restoring Honor rally]]'', a campaign developed that called for Colbert to hold his own rally at the [[Lincoln Memorial]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/03/restoring-truthiness-colbert-rally-beck_n_704578.html &quot;Internet Petitions Stephen Colbert To Hold 'Restoring Truthiness' Rally At Lincoln Memorial&quot;], [http://www.colbertrally.com/ ColbertRally.com] [http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/09/14/reddit-campaign-for-colbert-rally-breaks-charity-records &quot;Time&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; On the September 10, 2010 episode of the ''Daily Show''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title=&quot;September 10, 2010&quot;|url= |series=The Daily Show with Jon Stewart|serieslink= |credits=Executive Producers: [[Rory Albanese]], Josh Lieb, [[Jon Stewart]]|network=[[Comedy Central]]|station= |city= |airdate=September 10, 2010|began= |ended= |season= |seriesno= |number= |minutes= |transcript= |transcripturl= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Colbert Report'' Stewart and Colbert made preannouncements of a future event. On September 16, 2010, Stewart and Colbert announced competing rallies on the Washington, DC Mall on October 30, 2010, Stewart's &quot;''Rally to Restore Sanity''&quot;, and Colbert's &quot;''March to Keep Fear Alive''&quot;. Both were eventually merged into the [[Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear]].

===Super PAC and 2012 Presidential campaign===
{{main|Colbert Super PAC}}
{{See also|South Carolina Republican primary, 2012}}

In May 2011, Colbert filed a request with the [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC) asking for a media exemption for coverage of his [[political action committee]], ColbertPAC, on ''The Colbert Report''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Knott|first=Alex|title=Stephen Colbert Files FEC Request for Colbert PAC (VIDEO)|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/Stephen-Colbert-PAC-FEC-video-205563-1.html?utm_source=twitterfeed&amp;utm_medium=twitter|newspaper=Roll Call|date=May 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vogel|first=Kenneth P.|title=Stephen Colbert at the FEC?

In June 2011, during a public meeting, the [[Federal Election Commission|FEC]] voted 5-1 to grant ''The Colbert Report'' a limited media exemption. The exemption allows unlimited donations of airtime and show resources to promote the Colbert Super PAC without requiring disclosure to the FEC, but only for ads appearing on ''The Colbert Report''. Following the hearing, Colbert formally filed paperwork for the creation of his [[Super PAC]]  with the FEC secretary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = Shear| first = Michael | title = Colbert Gets Permission to Form Super-PAC|url =http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/30/colbert-gets-permission-to-form-super-pac/| work=The New York Times| date=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2012 New Hampshire primary, a poll for the subsequent South Carolina primary taken by Public Policy Polling (of 1,112 likely GOP voters, Jan 5-7, 2012) was reported to place Stephen Colbert at 5%, one point ahead of Jon Huntsman polling at 4%, in spite of the fact that Colbert was not on the ballot. This poll showed Colbert to be closely behind Rick Perry's 7% and Ron Paul's 8% (with Romney at 27%, Gingrich 23% and Santorum at 18%). On the January 11 episode of the Colbert Report, Colbert asked his audience if he should run for President in South Carolina, to which he received strong applause. He then stated that he would be making a &quot;Major Announcement&quot; during the next day's show. On January 12, Colbert started his show by discussing his role in the Presidential campaign, then addressed the law preventing him from being a Presidential candidate while running his Super PAC. With the help of his lawyer Trevor Potter, he then signed over control of his Super PAC to Jon Stewart, with the organization title then being referred to as &quot;The Definitely Not Coordinating With Stephen Colbert Super PAC&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertsuperpac.com/ |title=Colbert Super PAC Under New Management! |publisher=Colbertsuperpac.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after this legal block was out of the way, Colbert announced that &quot;I am forming an exploratory committee to lay the groundwork for my possible candidacy for the President of the United States of South Carolina. I'm doin' it!&quot; He reiterated in the interview portion of that show that &quot;I'm still in the exploratory phase&quot; of his Presidential campaign.

On the January 16, 2012 episode, Colbert encouraged his viewers to vote for [[Herman Cain]] in the South Carolina primary. As Cain was still on the ballot, despite having recently dropped out of the race, Colbert announced that he would consider any votes cast for Cain to be in direct support of his own possible candidacy.

===Other work===
Stephen Colbert is co-author of the satirical text-and-picture novel ''[[Wigfield|Wigfield: The Can Do Town That Just May Not]]'', which was published in 2003 by [[Hyperion (publisher)|Hyperion Books]]. The novel was a collaboration between Colbert, [[Amy Sedaris]], and [[Paul Dinello]], and tells the story of a small town threatened by the impending destruction of a massive dam. The narrative is presented as a series of fictional interviews with the town's residents, accompanied by photos. The three authors toured performing an adaptation of ''Wigfield'' on stage the same year the book was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = 'Daily Show' meets Second City in 'Wigfield' tour|first = Nina|last = Metz|publisher = Chicago Tribune|date = April 27, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colbert filled in for Sam Seder on the second episode of ''[[The Majority Report]]'' on [[Air America Radio]], and has also done reports for ''[[The Al Franken Show]]''. He appeared on a track on ''[[Wig in a Box]]'', a tribute album for ''[[Hedwig and the Angry Inch (musical)|Hedwig and the Angry Inch]]''. Colbert read the part of [[Leopold Bloom]] in ''Bloomsday on Broadway XXIV: Love Literature Language Lust: Leopold's Women Bloom'' on June 16, 2005 at Symphony Space in New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeOut&quot;/&gt; He appeared in a series of TV commercials for [[General Motors]], as a not-too-bright investigator searching for the elusive (and non-existent in real life) &quot;[[GM Goodwrench|Mr. Goodwrench]]&quot;. He also portrayed the letter Z in ''[[Sesame Street]]: All-Star Alphabet'', a 2005 video release.

Colbert is a producer of ''[[The 1 Second Film]]'', the world's largest nonprofit collaborative art film. His [http://youtube.com/watch?v=OBa5xAsxwLM video request] that [[IMDb]] list his credit for ''The 1 Second Film'' (&quot;it is as valid as most of my credits&quot;) enabled thousands of the film's producers to be listed in the massive movie database until they were removed in early 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the1secondfilm.com/blog/nirvan/why_did_imdb_remove_thousands_our_producers |title=Why did IMDb remove thousands of our producers? {{!}} The 1 Second Film |author=Mullick, Nirvan |date=February 5, 2007 |accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colbert has released one book associated with ''The Colbert Report'', ''[[I Am America (And So Can You!)]]''. It was released on October 7, 2007 by [[Hachette Book Group USA|Grand Central Publishing]]. Grand Central Publishing is the successor to Warner Books, which published ''[[America (The Book)]]'', written by ''The Daily Show'' staff. The book contains similar political satire, but was written primarily by Colbert himself rather than as a collaboration with his ''Colbert Report'' writing staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Colbert riffs put to paper|first = Steven|last = Zeitchik|publisher = ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]''|date = March 20, 2006|url = http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117940055.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|accessdate = July 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|The Colbert Report#Awards}}

In 2000 Colbert and the other Daily Show writers were the recipients of three [[Emmy Award]]s as writers for ''The Daily Show'' and again in 2005 and 2006. In 2005 he was nominated for a [[Satellite Award]] for his performance on ''The Colbert Report'' and again in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;emmycolbert&quot; /&gt;

He was also nominated for three Emmys for ''The Colbert Report'' in 2006, including Best Performance in a Variety, Musical Program or Special, which he lost to [[Barry Manilow]]. Manilow and Colbert would go on to jokingly sign and notarize a revolving biannual custody agreement for the Emmy on the ''Colbert Report'' episode aired on October 30, 2006. He lost the same category to [[Tony Bennett]] in 2007 and [[Don Rickles]] in 2008.

In January 2006, the [[American Dialect Society]] named ''[[truthiness]]'', which Colbert coined on the premiere episode of ''The Colbert Report'', as its 2005 [[Word of the year|Word of the Year]]. Colbert devoted time on five successive episodes to [[Heather Clark (American Journalist)|bemoaning the failure]] of the [[Associated Press]] to mention his role in popularizing the word ''truthiness'' in its news coverage of the Word of the Year.&lt;ref name=ADO&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.americandialect.org/index.php/amerdial/truthiness_voted_2005_word_of_the_year/|title = Truthiness Voted 2005 Word of the Year|publisher = [[American Dialect Society]]|date = January 6, 2006|accessdate = April 15, 2007}}{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=newsweek2&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11182033/site/newsweek/|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060425101629/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11182033/site/newsweek/|archivedate=April 25, 2006|title = The Truthiness Teller|first = Marc|last = Peyser|work = [[Newsweek]]|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|date = February 16, 2006|accessdate = February 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 9, 2006, [[Merriam-Webster]] also announced that it selected ''truthiness'' as its Word of the Year for 2006.

===COLBERT Treadmill===
{{Wikinews|Comedian Stephen Colbert wins NASA space station name contest}}
In 2009 NASA engineered a new treadmill for the [[International Space Station]]. It was brought to the ISS by the [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Space Shuttle ''Discovery'']] during the STS-128 mission in August 2009. The complex machine is now used eight hours daily by astronauts and cosmonauts aboard the space station in order to maintain their muscle mass and bone density while spending long periods of time in a zero gravity environment. While engineers at NASA were constructing this treadmill it was simply called T-2 for more than two years. However, on April 14, 2009 the treadmill became the most famous piece of exercise equipment in the world when NASA renamed it the &quot;Combined Operational Load-Bearing External Resistance Treadmill&quot;, or COLBERT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/behindscenes/colberttreadmill.html|title=NASA&amp;nbsp;— COLBERT Ready for Serious Exercise|publisher=Nasa.gov|date=2010-10-23|accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; NASA named the treadmill after Colbert,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/29841715/|title=Oops: Colbert wins space station name contest - Technology &amp; science - Space - Human spaceflight - msnbc.com|publisher=MSNBC|date=2009-03-23|accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; who took an interest during the Node 3 naming census for the ISS module, [[Tranquility (ISS module)|''Tranquility'']].

Colbert urged his followers to post the name &quot;Colbert&quot;, which upon completion of the census received the most entries totaling 230,539, some 40,000 votes more than the second-place choice, Serenity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colbertnation.com/the-colbert-report-videos/220492/march-03-2009/name-the-nasa-module-after-stephen|title=Name the NASA Module After Stephen|publisher=colbertnation.com|date=2008-03-03|accessdate=2008-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The COLBERT is expected to last the life of the ISS and will have seen about 38,000 miles of running when the Space Station is retired in 2020 but was also built with 150,000 mile lifespan if needed till 2028 or longer. Colbert realized he was the recipient of an extremely rare honor when astronaut [[Suni Williams]] came on ''The Colbert Report'' to announce that NASA had named the treadmill after him. Despite being an acronym, the COLBERT is the only piece of NASA engineered equipment in space that is named after a living human being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/externalflash/name_ISS/index.html|title=Help NASA Name Node 3!|publisher=Nasa.gov|date=2009-01-30|accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
