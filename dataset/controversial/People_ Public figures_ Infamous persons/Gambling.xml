[[Image:The Cardsharps.jpg|thumb|280px|[[Caravaggio]], ''[[Cardsharps|The Cardsharps]]'', c.&amp;nbsp;1594]]
'''Gambling''' is the [[wikt:wager#Verb|wagering]] of [[money]] or something of material [[Value (economics)|value]] (referred to as &quot;the stakes&quot;) on an [[Event (probability theory)|event]] with an uncertain outcome with the primary intent of winning additional money and/or material goods. Typically, the outcome of the wager is evident within a short period.

The term '''gaming'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1990/Ukpga_19900026_en_1.htm |title=United Kingdom Office of Public Sector Information: Definition as Gaming |publisher=Opsi.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; in this context typically refers to instances in which the activity has been specifically permitted by [[law]]. The two words are not mutually exclusive; ''i.e.'', a “gaming” company offers (legal) “gambling” activities to the public&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Humphrey |first=Chuck |url=http://www.gambling-law-us.com/ |title=Gambling Law US |publisher=Gambling Law US |date= |accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may be regulated by one of many [[gaming control board]]s, for example, the [[Nevada Gaming Control Board]].  However, this distinction is not universally observed in the English-speaking world.  For instance, in the&amp;nbsp;[[UK]], the regulator of gambling activities is called the [[Gambling Commission]] (not the Gaming Commission).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/ |title=UK Gambling Commission |publisher=Gamblingcommission.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the word ''[[wiktionary:gaming|gaming]]'' is frequently used to describe activities that do not involve wagering, especially [[online game|online]].

Gambling is also a major international commercial activity, with the legal gambling market totaling an estimated $335 billion in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/16539402 | work=The Economist | title=You bet | date=July 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In other forms, gambling can be conducted with materials which have a value, but aren't real money. For example, players of [[Marble (toy)#Marbles games|marbles games]] might wager marbles, and likewise games of  ''[[Pogs]]'' or [[Magic: The Gathering#Gambling|''Magic: The Gathering'']] can be played with the collectible game pieces (respectively, small discs and trading cards) as stakes, resulting in a [[meta-game]] regarding the value of a player's collection of pieces.

==History==
===Religious===
Religious perspectives on gambling have been mixed. Both the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Judaism|Jewish]] traditions have even set aside days for gambling,&lt;ref name=Barlow&gt;{{cite news
|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2007/12/01/gambling_had_role_in_religious_history/
|title=Gambling had role in religious history
|first=Rich
|last=Barlow
|publisher=The Boston Globe
|date=December 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (for Jews [[Hanukkah]]), although [[religious]] authorities generally disapprove of gambling. Ancient Jewish authorities frowned on gambling, even disqualifying professional gamblers from testifying in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.torah.org/features/secondlook/gambling.html |title=Gambling |author=Berel Wein |date= |work= |publisher=torah.org |accessdate=July 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church holds the position that there is no moral impediment to gambling, so long as it is fair, all bettors have a reasonable chance of winning, there is no fraud involved, and the parties involved do not have actual knowledge of the outcome of the bet (unless they have disclosed this knowledge)

Gambling has often been seen as having [[social cost|social consequences]]. For these social and religious reasons, most legal jurisdictions limit gambling.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Some Islamic nations prohibit gambling; most other countries [[Gaming regulation|regulate it]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iagr.org/members/members.htm International Association of Gaming Regulators: Members]{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:GamblersSOF.jpg|thumb|073 of Gamblers]]

===Origins===
Many popular games played in modern casinos originate from [[Europe]] and [[China]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=July 29, 2012 |url=http://www.casino.org/blog/history-of-american-gambling/ |title=title=The History of American Gambling |publisher=Casino.org |date=2012-07-29 |accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Games such as [[craps]], [[baccarat]], [[roulette]], and [[blackjack]] originate from different areas of [[Europe]]. A version of [[keno]], an ancient Chinese lottery game, is played in casinos around the world.  In addition, [[pai gow poker]], a hybrid between [[pai gow]] and [[poker]] is also played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamblinginfo.com/1_History_of_Gambling.htm|title=Gambling History, from the beginning.|publisher=Gambling Info|accessdate=June 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
Many jurisdictions, local as well as national, either ban gambling or heavily control it by licensing. Such regulation generally leads to [[Tourism#Special forms of tourism|gambling tourism]] and illegal gambling in the areas where it is not allowed. The involvement of governments, through regulation and taxation, has led to a close connection between many governments and gaming organizations, where legal gambling provides significant government revenue, such as in [[Monaco]] or [[Macau]].

===Insurance===
Because contracts of [[insurance]] have many features in common with wagers, insurance contracts are often distinguished under law as agreements in which either party has an interest in the &quot;bet-upon&quot; outcome ''beyond'' the specific financial terms. ''E.g.'': a “bet” with an insurer on whether one's house will burn down is not gambling, but rather ''insurance'' — as the homeowner has an obvious interest in the continued existence of his/her home ''independent of'' the purely financial aspects of the &quot;bet&quot; (''i.e.'', the insurance policy).  Nonetheless, both insurance and gambling contracts are typically considered [[aleatory contract]]s under most legal systems, though they are subject to different types of regulation.

There is generally legislation requiring that the odds in gaming devices are [[statistical randomness|statistically random]], to prevent manufacturers from making some high-payoff results impossible.  Since these high-payoffs have very low [[probability]], a house bias can quite easily be missed unless checking the odds carefully.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gaming.nv.gov/stats_regs_history.htm#tech_standards Nevada State Gaming Control Board: Technical Standards (Adopted)]{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of gambling ==
=== Casino games ===
While almost any game can be played for money, and any game typically played for money can also be played just for fun, some games are generally offered in a [[casino]] setting.

==== Table games ====
{{Main|Table game}}

[[Image:Tokyo Racecourse 3.jpg|thumb|right|[[Tokyo Racecourse]] in [[Tokyo]], Japan.]]

==== Electronic gaming ====
*[[Pachinko]]
*[[Slot machine]]
*[[Video poker]]

==== Other gambling ====
*[[Bingo (U.S.)|Bingo]]
*[[Keno]]

=== Non-casino gambling games ===
Gambling games that take place outside of casinos include Bingo (as played in the [[Bingo (US)|US]] and [[Bingo (UK)|UK]]), [[dead pool]], [[lottery|lotteries]], [[pull-tab]] games and [[scratchcard]]s, and [[Mahjong]].

Other non-casino gambling games include:
*[[Card game]]s, such as [[Liars poker|Liar's poker]], [[Contract bridge|Bridge]], [[Basset (card game)|Basset]], [[Lansquenet]], [[Piquet]], [[Put option|Put]], [[Teen patti]]
*[[Carnival game|Carnival Games]] such as [[Razzle (game)|The Razzle]] or [[Hanky Pank (game)|Hanky Pank]]
*[[Coin|Coin-tossing]] games such as [[Head and Tail]], [[Two-up]]&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;
*[[Confidence trick]]s such as [[Three-card Monte]] or the [[Shell game]]
*[[Dice game|Dice-based]] games, such as [[Backgammon]], [[Liar's dice]], [[Passe-dix]], [[Hazard (game)|Hazard]], [[Threes]], [[Pig (dice)|Pig]], or [[Mexico (game)|Mexico]]

&lt;nowiki&gt;*Although coin tossing isn't usually played in a casino, it has been known to be an official gambling game in some Australian casinos&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamblinginfo.com/95_The_Game_of_Two_up.htm |title=The Game of Two up |publisher=Gambling Info |date= |accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fixed-odds betting ===
{{Main|Fixed-odds betting}}
Fixed-odds betting and [[Parimutuel betting]] frequently occur at many types of sporting events, and political elections. In addition many [[bookmaker]]s offer fixed odds on a number of non-sports related outcomes, for example the direction and extent of movement of various [[stock market index|financial indices]], the winner of [[television]] competitions such as ''[[Big Brother television program|Big Brother]]'', and [[election]] results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2004/s1229517.htm |title=US election betting backs Bush |publisher=ABC.net |date=2004-10-28 |accessdate=2012-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactive [[prediction market]]s also offer trading on these outcomes, with &quot;shares&quot; of results trading on an open market.

==== Parimutuel betting ====
{{Main|Parimutuel betting}}
One of the most widespread forms of gambling involves betting on [[horse racing|horse]] or [[greyhound racing]].  Wagering may take place through [[parimutuel betting|parimutuel]] pools, or [[bookmaker]]s may take bets personally. Parimutuel wagers pay off at prices determined by support in the wagering pools, while bookmakers pay off either at the odds offered at the time of accepting the bet; or at the median odds offered by track bookmakers at the time the race started.

==== Sports betting ====
{{Main|Sports betting}}
Betting on team sports has become an important [[service industry]] in many countries. For example, millions of [[United Kingdom|Britons]] play the [[football pools]] every week.  In addition to organized sports betting, both legal and illegal, there are many side-betting games played by casual groups of spectators, such as [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Basketball Tournament]] Bracket Pools, [[Super Bowl]] Squares, [[Fantasy sport|Fantasy Sports Leagues]] with monetary entry fees and winnings, and in-person spectator games like [[Moundball]].

=== Arbitrage betting ===
{{Main|Arbitrage betting}}
Arbitrage betting is a theoretically risk-free betting system in which every outcome of an event is bet upon so that a known profit will be made by the bettor upon completion of the event, regardless of the outcome. Arbitrage betting is a combination of the ancient art of [[arbitrage]] trading and gambling, which has been made possible by the large numbers of bookmakers in the marketplace, creating occasional opportunities for arbitrage.

=== Other types of betting ===
One can also bet with another person that a statement is true or false, or that a specified event will happen (a &quot;back bet&quot;) or will not happen (a &quot;lay bet&quot;) within a specified time. This occurs in particular when two people have opposing but strongly held views on truth or events. Not only do the parties hope to gain from the bet, they place the bet also to demonstrate their certainty about the issue. Some means of determining the issue at stake must exist. Sometimes the amount bet remains nominal, demonstrating the outcome as one of principle rather than of financial importance.

[[Bet exchange|Betting exchanges]] allow consumers to both back and lay at odds of their choice. Similar in some ways to a stock exchange, a bettor may want to back a horse (hoping it will win) or lay a horse (hoping it will lose, effectively acting as bookmaker).

== Staking systems ==
{{Main|Betting strategy}}
Many betting systems have been created in an attempt to &quot;beat the bookie&quot; but most still accept that no system can make an unprofitable bet profitable over time. Widely used systems include:
*[[Card counting]] - Many systems exist for [[Blackjack]] to keep track of the ratio of ten values to all others; when this ratio is high the player has an advantage and should increase the amount of their bets. Keeping track of cards dealt confers an advantage in other games as well.
*[[Due-column betting]] &amp;ndash; A variation on fixed profits betting in which the bettor sets a target profit and then calculates a bet size that will make this profit, adding any losses to the target.
*Fixed profits &amp;ndash; the stakes vary based on the odds to ensure the same profit from each winning selection.
*Fixed stakes &amp;ndash; a traditional system of staking the same amount on each selection.
*[[Kelly criterion|Kelly]] &amp;ndash; the optimum level to bet to maximize your future median bank level.
*[[Martingale (betting system)|Martingale]] &amp;ndash; A system based on staking enough each time to recover losses from previous bet(s) until one wins.

== Other uses of the term &quot;gambling&quot; ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2010}}
{{Original research|section|date=August 2010}}
Many risk-return choices are sometimes referred to colloquially as &quot;gambling.&quot; Whether this terminology is acceptable is a matter of debate:
*Emotional or physical risk-taking, where the risk-return ratio is not quantifiable (e.g., [[skydiving]], [[political campaign|campaigning]] for political office, asking someone for a date, etc.)
*[[Insurance]] is a method of shifting risk from one party to another. Insurers use actuarial methods to calculate appropriate premiums, which is similar to calculating gambling odds.  Insurers set their premiums to obtain a long term positive expected return in the same manner that professional gamblers select which bets to make.  While insurance is sometimes distinguished from gambling by the requirement of an [[insurable interest]], the equivalent in gambling is simply betting against one's own best interests (e.g., a sports coach betting against his own team to mitigate the financial repercussions of a losing season).
*Situations where the possible return is a secondary reason for the wager/purchase (e.g. buying a [[raffle]] ticket to support a [[charitable gambling|charitable]] cause)

[[Investments]] are also usually not considered gambling, although some investments can involve significant risk.  Examples of investments include [[stock]]s, [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and [[real estate]]. Starting a business can also be considered a form of investment. Investments are generally not considered gambling when they meet the following criteria:
*Economic utility
*Positive expected returns (at least in the long term)
*Underlying value independent of the risk being undertaken

Some [[speculation|speculative]] investment activities are particularly risky, but are sometimes perceived to be different from gambling:
*Foreign currency exchange ([[forex]]) transactions
*[[Prediction markets]]
*Securities [[derivative (finance)|derivatives]], such as [[Option (finance)|options]] or [[Futures contract|futures]], where the value of the derivative is dependent on the value of the underlying asset at a specific point in time (typically the derivative's associated expiration date)

==Psychological aspects==
{{Main|Problem gambling}}
Studies show that though many people participate in gambling as a form of [[recreation]] or even as a means to gain an income, gambling, like any behavior which involves variation in [[neurochemistry|brain chemistry]], can become a [[Behavioral addiction|psychologically addictive]] and harmful behavior in some people. [[Reinforcement]] schedules may also make gamblers persist in gambling even after repeated losses.  

The Russian writer [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]] (himself a problem gambler) portrays in his novella ''[[The Gambler (novella)|The Gambler]]'' the psychological implications of gambling and how gambling can affect gamblers.  He also associates gambling and the idea of &quot;[[get rich quick|getting rich quick]]&quot;, suggesting that Russians may have a particular affinity for gambling. Dostoevsky shows the effect of betting money for the chance of gaining more in 19th-century Europe.  The association between Russians and gambling has fed legends of the origins of [[Russian roulette]].

[[Evolutionary psychology]] suggests that women more than men tend to select mating partners based on their resources. Thus, from an evolutionary perspective men may have had more to gain from a large increase in resources than women have had, which may be one explanation for why men, and especially poor men, tend to gamble more than women.&lt;ref name=Oxford2007&gt;The Oxford Handbook of Evolutionary Psychology, Edited by Robin Dunbar and Louise Barret, Oxford University Press, 2007, Chapter 32 Evolutionary Psychology and Mental Health, Randolph M. Nesse&lt;/ref&gt;
