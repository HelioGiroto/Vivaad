'''Nicolas Sarkozy''' ({{IPA-fr|ni.kɔ.la saʁ.kɔ.zi|lang|Sarkozy.ogg}};&lt;!--Please do not add a stress mark: French is not stressed in this way (see the talk page)--&gt; born '''Nicolas Paul Stéphane Sarközy&lt;!-- Please do not add an acute accent on the a --&gt; de Nagy-Bocsa&lt;!--Please do not add an acute accent on the o--&gt;'''; 28 January 1955) is a French politician who served as the [[List of Presidents of the French Republic|23rd]] [[President of the French Republic]] from 16 May 2007 until 15 May 2012.

Before his presidency, he was leader of the [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP). Under [[Jacques Chirac]]'s [[Jacques Chirac's second term|presidency]] he served as [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]] in [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]]'s (UMP) first two governments (from May 2002 to March 2004), then was appointed [[Minister of Finances (France)|Minister of Finances]] in Raffarin's last government (March 2004 to May 2005) and again Minister of the Interior in [[Dominique de Villepin]]'s government (2005–2007).

Sarkozy was also president of the [[General council (France)|General council]] of the [[Hauts-de-Seine]] department from 2004 to 2007 and mayor of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], one of the wealthiest [[communes of France]],&lt;!--without this comma, it sounds like the commune was wealthy only within the given years--&gt; from 1983 to 2002. He was [[Minister of the Budget (France)|Minister of the Budget]] in the government of [[Édouard Balladur]] ([[Rally for the Republic|RPR]], predecessor of the UMP) during [[François Mitterrand]]'s last term.

In [[Foreign policy of France|foreign affairs]], he promised a strengthening of the [[entente cordiale]] with the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=David Byers | title =Nicolas Sarkozy calls for 'Franco-British brotherhood' as state visit begins | url =http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3624398.ece |work=The Times |location=UK | date =26 March 2008 | accessdate =26 March 2008}}

He also married Italian-French singer-songwriter [[Carla Bruni]] on 2 February 2008 at the [[Élysée Palace]] in Paris.

On 6 May 2012, Sarkozy was defeated in the 2012 election by Socialist [[François Hollande]] by a margin of 3.2 percent, or 1,139,983 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elections.interieur.gouv.fr/PR2012/FE.html|title=Results of the French Presidential Election}} – French Ministry of the Interior.

==Personal life==
===Family background===
{{Main|Family history of Nicolas Sarkozy}}
Sarkozy is the son of Pál István Ernő Sárközy de Nagy-Bócsa&lt;ref&gt;It is the &quot;westernised&quot;, or &quot;internationalised&quot;, version of his Hungarian name, in which the given name is put first (whereas in Hungarian given names come last), and the French aristocratic particle &quot;de&quot; is used instead of the Hungarian aristocratic ending &quot;-i&quot;. This &quot;westernisation&quot; of Hungarian names is frequent, particularly for people with an aristocratic name. Check for example the leader of Hungary from 1920 to 1944, whose Hungarian name is nagybányai Horthy Miklós, but who is known in English as [[Miklós Horthy|Miklós Horthy de Nagybánya]]. The French name of Pál Sárközy de Nagy-Bócsa from 1948 is Paul Étienne Arnaud Sarközy de Nagy-Bocsa, where the given name Pál has been translated into Paul in French, and the acute accents on the &quot;a&quot; of Sarközy and the &quot;o&quot; of Bocsa were dropped as these letters never carry an acute accent (''accent aigu'') in French. The [[diaeresis (diacritic)|trema]] on the &quot;o&quot; of Sárközy was kept, probably because French typewriters allow this combination, whereas it is impossible to write &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; with an acute accent using a French typewriter.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-hu|&lt;!--Leave the lower case 'n' please, it's not an error!--&gt;nagybócsai Sárközy Pál}} {{IPA-hu|nɒɟ͡ʝboːt͡ʃɒi ʃaːrkøzi paːl||Pal_sarkozy.ogg}}; in some sources ''Nagy-Bócsay Sárközy Pál István Ernő''),&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/15/opinion/15tue4.html?_r=2&amp;th&amp;emc=th&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin | title = The New French President's Roots Are Worth Remembering | date =15 May 2007 | accessdate=28 September 2008 | work=The New York Times | first=Serge | last=Schmemann}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Hungarian people|Hungarian]] [[aristocracy|aristocrat]], and Andrée Jeanne &quot;Dadu&quot; Mallah (b.

===Early life===
During Sarkozy's childhood, his father founded his own advertising agency and became wealthy. The family lived in a mansion owned by Sarkozy's maternal grandfather, Benedict Mallah, in the [[17th Arrondissement]] of Paris. The family later moved to [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], one of the wealthiest [[Commune in France|communes]] of the [[Île-de-France (region)|Île-de-France]] ''[[Régions in France|région]]'' immediately west of the 17th Arrondissement just outside of Paris. According to Sarkozy, his staunchly [[Gaullist]] grandfather was more of an influence on him than his father, whom he rarely saw. Sarkozy was, accordingly, raised Catholic.&lt;ref name=BBCProf/&gt;

Sarkozy said that being abandoned by his father shaped much of who he is today. He also has said that, in his early years, he felt inferior in relation to his wealthier and taller classmates.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;''see Catherine Nay's semi-official biography''&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;What made me who I am now is the sum of all the humiliations suffered during childhood&quot;, he said later.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

===Education===
Sarkozy was enrolled in the ''Lycée Chaptal'', a well regarded public middle and high school in Paris's [[8th arrondissement of Paris|8th arrondissement]], where he failed his ''[[Education in France#Secondary education|sixième]]''. His family then sent him to the ''Cours Saint-Louis de Monceau'', a private Catholic school in the 17th arrondissement, where he was reportedly a mediocre student,&lt;ref&gt;''Un pouvoir nommé désir'', Catherine Nay, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; but where he nonetheless obtained his ''[[baccalauréat]]'' in 1973. He enrolled at the ''[[University of Paris X: Nanterre|Université Paris X Nanterre]]'', where he graduated with an MA in [[Private law]], and later with a [[DEA (former French degree)|DEA]] degree in Business law. Paris X Nanterre had been the starting place for the [[May '68]] student movement and was still a stronghold of [[leftist]] students. Described as a quiet student, Sarkozy soon joined the right-wing student organization, in which he was very active. He completed his military service as a part-time Air Force cleaner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsnours.com/2008/07/le-service-mili.html |title=Le service militaire de Sakozy|publisher=Nousnours |date=22 February 1999 |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating, he entered the ''[[Paris Institute of Political Studies|Institut d'Études Politiques de Paris]]'', better known as Sciences Po, (1979–1981) but failed to graduate&lt;ref&gt;Augustin Scalbert, [http://www.rue89.com/2007/09/18/un-soupcon-de-vantardise-sur-les-cv-ministeriels Un soupçon de vantardise sur les CV ministériels], ''[[Rue 89]]'', 18 September 2007 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to an insufficient command of the English language.&lt;ref name=&quot;cath_nay&quot;&gt;See Catherine Nay's semi-official biography&lt;/ref&gt; After passing the [[bar (law)|bar]], he became a lawyer specializing in [[business law|business]] and [[family law]],&lt;ref name=&quot;cath_nay&quot;/&gt; and was one of [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s top French lawyers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tempsreel.nouvelobs.com/actualites/international/europe/20090629.OBS2316/berlusconi__le_bon_nicolas_sarkozy_a_ete_mon_avocat.html |title=Berlusconi : le &quot;bon Nicolas Sarkozy&quot; a été mon avocat |work=Le Nouvel Observateur |location=France |date=29 June 2009|accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2009/06/sezioni/politica/berlusconi-varie-2/berlusconi-russia/berlusconi-russia.html |title=Corfù, il vertice del disgelo &quot;Riparte collaborazione Nato-Russia&quot; Il Cavaliere: &quot;Mandai il mio avvocato Sarkozy da lui per la Georgia...&quot; |publisher=Repubblica |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unionesarda.ilsole24ore.com/Articoli/Articolo/131694 |title=Berlusconi al vertice Nato-Russia &quot;Quando mandai l'avvocato Sarkozy&quot; |publisher=L'UNIONE SARDA.it|date=20 November 1948 |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriages===
====Marie-Dominique Culioli====
Sarkozy married his first wife, Marie-Dominique Culioli, on 23 September 1982; her father was a [[pharmacist]] from [[Vico, Corse-du-Sud|Vico]] (a village north of [[Ajaccio]], Corsica), her uncle was [[Achille Peretti]], the mayor of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] from 1947–1983 and Sarkozy's political mentor. They had two sons, Pierre (born in 1985), now a hip-hop producer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Indrisek |first=Scott |url=http://blog.rhapsody.com/2008/01/pierre-sarkozy-hip-hop-producer.html |title=Pierre Sarkozy: Hip-Hop Producer|publisher=Rhapsody Blog|date=7 January 2008|accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jean Sarkozy|Jean]] (born in 1986) now a local politician in the city of Neuilly-sur-Seine where Sarkozy started his own political career. Sarkozy's best man was the prominent right-wing politician [[Charles Pasqua]], later to become a political opponent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,476255-2,00.html Sarkozy Closes in on his Goal: Ambition and Honesty on the French Campaign Trail] Spiegel.de, 4 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Sarkozy divorced Culioli in 1996, after they had been separated for several years.

====Cécilia Ciganer-Albéniz====
As mayor of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]], Sarkozy met former fashion model and public relations executive [[Cécilia Attias|Cécilia Ciganer-Albéniz]] (great-granddaughter of composer [[Isaac Albéniz]] and daughter of a Moldovan father), when he officiated at her wedding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cécilia Sarkozy: The First Lady vanishes|date=24 June 2007|work=The Independent |location=UK |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/europe/ccilia-sarkozy-the-first-lady-vanishes-454247.html | location=London | accessdate=31 March 2010 |deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=December 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; to television host [[Jacques Martin (TV host)|Jacques Martin]]. In 1988, she left her husband for Sarkozy, and divorced Martin one year later. Sarkozy married her in October 1996, with witnesses [[Martin Bouygues]] and [[Bernard Arnault]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netglimse.com/celebs/pages/cecilia_sarkozy/index.shtml |title=Cecilia Sarkozy Biography|publisher=NetGlimse.com |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have one son, Louis, born 23 April 1997.

Between 2002 and 2005, the couple often appeared together on public occasions, with Cécilia Sarkozy acting as the chief aide for her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wyatt |first=Caroline |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6656717.stm |title=Sarkozy soap opera grips Paris |publisher=BBC News |date=15 May 2007 |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 May 2005, however, the Swiss newspaper ''[[Le Matin (Switzerland)|Le Matin]]'' revealed that she had left Sarkozy for French-Moroccan national [[Richard Attias]], head of [[Publicis]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huliq.com/38585/nicolas-sarkozy-divorce-official |title=Nicolas Sarkozy divorce official|publisher=HULIQ|date=18 October 2007 |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were other accusations of a private nature in ''Le Matin'', which led to Sarkozy [[lawsuit|suing]] the paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globaljournalist.org/stories/2005/12/01/french-roast-served-up-american-style/ |title=Globaljournalist.org |publisher=Global Journalist |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the meantime, he was said to have had an affair with a journalist of ''[[Le Figaro]]'', [[Anne Fulda]].&lt;ref name=&quot;telegraph3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=The Daily Telegraph |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=SNKICWL0BRPGRQFIQMGCFFWAVCBQUIV0?xml=/news/2006/02/19/wsark19.xml&amp;page=2|title=The Sarkozy saga|accessdate=12 August 2007 | location=UK | first=Kim | last=Willsher | date=19 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarkozy and Cécilia ultimately divorced on 15 October 2007, soon after his election as President.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/afxnewslimited/feeds/afx/2007/10/18/afx4234519.html |title=French president Sarkozy separation is 'divorce' – official UPDATE|author=AFX News Limited|work=Forbes |date=18 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarkozy declared to the [[Constitutional Council (France)|Constitutional Council]] a [[net worth]] of €2&amp;nbsp;million, most of the assets being in the form of [[life insurance]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |coauthor=AFP |title=L'homme qui valait 2 millions |trans_title=The man worth 2 million |work=Libération |location=France |language=French |date=11 May 2007 |url=http://www.liberation.fr/politiques/010119057-l-homme-qui-valait-2-millions |accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the French President, one of his first actions was to give himself a pay raise: his yearly salary went from €101,000 to €240,000 (to match his European/French peers).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Jon Boyle |title=Jokes and anger in France over Sarkozy pay rise |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKL3132522020071031 |agency=Reuters UK |date=31 October 2007 |accessdate=12 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also entitled to a mayoral pension as a former mayor of [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]].

==Member of National Assembly==
Sarkozy is recognised by both the right and left's French parties as a skilled politician and striking [[orator]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;French Populism&quot;, by Ignacio Ramonet, [[Le Monde Diplomatique]], June 2007 Edition, [http://www.monde-diplomatique.fr/2007/06/RAMONET/14842 French version] {{Fr icon}}, [http://www.truthout.org/docs_2006/053107G.shtml English translation] {{En icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; His supporters within France emphasize his [[charisma]], political innovation and willingness to &quot;make a dramatic break&quot; amid mounting disaffection against &quot;politics as usual&quot;. Overall, he is considered more pro-United States and pro-Israeli than most French politicians.

Since November 2004, Sarkozy has been president of the [[Union for a Popular Movement|Union pour un Mouvement Populaire]] (UMP), France's major right-wing political party, and he was [[Minister of the Interior (France)|Minister of the Interior]] in the government of Prime Minister [[Dominique de Villepin]], with the honorific title of [[Minister of State]], making him effectively the number three official in the French State after President [[Jacques Chirac]] and Villepin. His ministerial responsibilities included law enforcement and working to co-ordinate relationships between the national and local governments, as well as [[Minister of Worship (France)|Minister of Worship]] (in this role he created the [[French Council of the Muslim Faith|CFCM]], French Council of Muslim Faith). Previously, he was a deputy to the [[French National Assembly]]. He was forced to resign this position in order to accept his ministerial appointment. He previously also held several ministerial posts, including [[Finance Minister]].

===In government===
Sarkozy's political career began when he was 23, when he became a city councillor in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]]. A member of the [[Neo-Gaullist]] party RPR, he went on to be elected mayor of that town, after the death of the incumbent mayor [[Achille Peretti]]. Sarkozy had been close to Peretti, as his mother was Peretti's secretary. The senior RPR politician at the time, [[Charles Pasqua]], wanted to become mayor, and asked Sarkozy to organize his campaign. Instead Sarkozy profited from Pasqua's short illness to propel himself into the office of mayor.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Le Parisien]]'', 11 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; He was the youngest mayor of any town in France with a population of over 50,000. He served from 1983 to 2002. In 1988, he became a deputy in the [[French National Assembly|National Assembly]].

In 1993, Sarkozy was in the national news for personally negotiating with the &quot;Human Bomb&quot;, a man who had taken small children hostage in a [[kindergarten]] in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine|Neuilly]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesWin&quot;&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=8 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;Human Bomb&quot; was killed after two days of talks by [[French National Police|policemen]] of the [[Recherche Assistance Intervention Dissuasion|RAID]], who entered the school stealthily while the attacker was resting.

At the same time, from 1993 to 1995, he was Minister for the Budget and spokesman for the executive in the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Édouard Balladur]]. Throughout most of his early career, Sarkozy had been seen as a protégé of [[Jacques Chirac]]. During his tenure, he increased France's public debt more than any other French Budget Minister, by the equivalent of €200&amp;nbsp;billion (USD260&amp;nbsp;billion) (FY 1994–1996). The first two budgets he submitted to the parliament (budgets for FY1994 and FY1995) assumed a yearly budget deficit equivalent to six percent of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;[[:fr:Dette publique de la France|Dette publique de la France]] {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Maastricht Treaty]], the French yearly budget deficit may not exceed three percent of France's GDP.

In 1995, he spurned Chirac and backed [[Édouard Balladur]] for [[President of France]]. After Chirac won the election, Sarkozy lost his position as Minister for the Budget, and found himself outside the circles of power.

However, he returned after the right-wing defeat at the [[French legislative election, 1997|1997 parliamentary election]], as the number two candidate of the RPR. When the party leader [[Philippe Séguin]] resigned, in 1999, he took the leadership of the Neo-Gaullist party. But it obtained its worst result at the [[European Parliament election, 1999 (France)|1999 European Parliament election]], winning 12.7% of the votes, less than the dissident [[Rally for France]] of Charles Pasqua. Sarkozy lost the RPR leadership.
[[File:Sarkozy-congres-ump.jpg|thumb|Nicolas Sarkozy speaking at the congress of his party, 28 November 2004]]
In 2002, however, after his re-election as President of the French Republic (see [[French presidential election, 2002]]), Chirac appointed Sarkozy as French Minister of the Interior in the cabinet of Prime Minister [[Jean-Pierre Raffarin]], despite Sarkozy's support of Edouard Balladur for French President in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouthindependent.com/archives/2007/10/french-presiden.html Sauced Sarkozy] Felice E. Baker, The Dartmouth Independent, 31 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Following Chirac's 14 July keynote speech on road safety, Sarkozy as interior minister pushed through new legislation leading to the mass purchase of speed cameras and a campaign to increase the awareness of dangers on the roads.

In the cabinet reshuffle of 30 April 2004, Sarkozy became Finance Minister. Tensions continued to build between Sarkozy and Chirac and within the UMP party, as Sarkozy's intentions of becoming head of the party after the resignation of [[Alain Juppé]] became clear.

In party elections of 10 November 2004, Sarkozy became leader of the UMP with 85% of the vote. In accordance with an agreement with Chirac, he resigned as Finance Minister. Sarkozy's ascent was marked by the division of UMP between ''sarkozystes'', such as Sarkozy's &quot;first lieutenant&quot;, [[Brice Hortefeux]], and Chirac loyalists, such as [[Jean-Louis Debré]].

Sarkozy was made Chevalier de la Légion d'honneur (Knight of the [[Legion of Honour]]) by President Chirac in February 2005. He was re-elected on 13 March 2005 to the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]] (as required by the constitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.assemblee-nationale.fr/english/8ab.asp#TITLE%20III |title=French Constitution, article 23 |publisher=Assemblee Nationale|accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; he had to resign as a deputy when he became minister in 2002).

On 31 May 2005 the main French news radio station ''[[France Info]]'' reported a rumour that Sarkozy was to be reappointed Minister of the Interior in the government of [[Dominique de Villepin]] without resigning from the UMP leadership. This was confirmed on 2 June 2005, when the members of the government were officially announced.

===First term as Minister of the Interior===

Towards the end of his first term as Minister of the Interior, in 2004, Sarkozy was the most divisive conservative politician in France, according to polls conducted at the beginning of 2004.

Sarkozy has sought to ease the sometimes tense relationships between the general French population and the [[Islam in France|Muslim community]]. Unlike the Catholic Church in France with their official leaders or Protestants with their umbrella organisations, the French Muslim community had a lack of structure with no group that could legitimately deal with the French government on their behalf. Sarkozy supported the foundation in May 2003 of the private non-profit [[French Council of the Muslim Faith|Conseil français du culte musulman]] (&quot;French Council of the Muslim Faith&quot;), an organisation meant to be representative of French Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Journal Officiel de la République Française|JO associations]]'', 28 May 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Sarkozy has suggested amending the [[1905 French law on the separation of Church and State|1905 law on the separation of Church and State]], mostly in order to be able to finance mosques and other Muslim institutions with public funds&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwrn.org/article.php?idd=19272&amp;sec=59&amp;con=2 WorldWide Religious News]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that they are less reliant on money from outside of France. It was not followed by any concrete measure.

===Minister of Finance===
During his short appointment as [[Minister of Finance (France)|Minister of Finance]], Sarkozy was responsible for introducing a number of policies. The degree to which this reflected ''libéralisme'' (a hands-off approach to running the economy) or more traditional French state ''dirigisme'' (intervention) is controversial. He resigned the day following his election as president of the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]].

* In September 2004, Sarkozy oversaw the reduction of the government ownership stake in [[France Télécom]] from 50.4 percent to 41 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Thorel |first=Jerome |title=Le gouvernement finalise la privatisation de France Télécom |language=French |publisher=ZDNet France |date=1 September 2004 |url=http://www.zdnet.fr/actualites/business/0,39020715,39169571,00.htm |accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sarkozy backed a partial [[nationalisation]] of the large engineering company [[Alstom]] decided by his predecessor when the company was exposed to bankruptcy in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bruxelles valide le sauvetage d'Alstom |work=[[L'Expansion]] |publisher=[[L'Express (France)|L'Express]] |location=France |language=French |date=22 September 2003 |url=http://www.lexpansion.com/art/17.363.70036.0.html |accessdate=18 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In June 2004, Sarkozy reached an agreement with the major retail chains in France to concertedly lower prices on household goods by an average of two percent; the success of this measure is disputed, with studies suggesting that the decrease was close to one percent in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Grande distribution&amp;nbsp;: l'accord Sarkozy à moitié appliqué |work=L'Expansion |location=France |language=French |date=30 September 2004 |url=http://www.lexpansion.com/art/2576.78716.0.html |accessdate=18 March 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Taxes: Sarkozy avoided taking a position on the ISF ([[solidarity tax on wealth]]). This is considered an ideological symbol by many on the [[political left|left]] and [[political right|right]]. Some in the business world and on the liberal right, such as [[Alain Madelin]], wanted it abolished. For Sarkozy, that would have risked being categorised by the left as a gift to the richest classes of society at a time of economic difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Martine |first=Gilson |title=ISF, la tentation des députés |trans_title=press review |work=Le Nouvel Observateur |location=France |language=French |date=20 May 2004 |url=http://www.nouvelobs.com/articles/p2063/a241461.html |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20050208204557/http://www.nouvelobs.com/articles/p2063/a241461.html |archivedate=8 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Villepin government===
===Second term as Minister of the Interior===
[[File:2006 09 12 sarkozy 600.jpg|thumb|Sarkozy as Minister of the Interior with then U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]], after their bilateral meeting in Washington, D.C., 12 September 2006]]
During his second term at the Ministry of the Interior, Sarkozy was initially more discreet about his ministerial activities: instead of focusing on his own topic of law and order, many of his declarations addressed wider issues, since he was expressing his opinions as head of the UMP party.

{{Main|Response to the 2005 civil unrest in France}}
However, the [[2005 civil unrest in France|civil unrest in autumn 2005]] put law enforcement in the spotlight again. Sarkozy was accused of having provoked the unrest by calling young delinquents from [[housing project]]s &quot;rabble&quot; ''(&quot;[[wikt:racaille|racaille]]&quot;)'' in [[Argenteuil]] near Paris, and controversially suggested [[ethnic cleansing|cleansing]] the minority suburbs with a [[Kärcher]]. After the accidental death of two youths, which sparked the riots, Sarkozy first blamed it on &quot;hoodlums&quot; and gangsters. These remarks were sharply criticised by many on the left wing and by a member of his own government, Delegate Minister for Equal Opportunities [[Azouz Begag]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/cgi-bin/ACHATS/acheter.cgi?offre=ARCHIVES&amp;type_item=ART_ARCH_30J&amp;objet_id=921072 Azouz Begag, principal opposant à Nicolas Sarkozy], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 2 November 2005 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the rioting, he made a number of announcements on future policy: selection of immigrants, &lt;!--better/worse--&gt; greater tracking of immigrants, and a reform on the 1945 ordinance government justice measures for young delinquents.

===UMP leader===
Before he was elected President of France, Sarkozy was president of [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]], the French conservative party, elected with 85 percent of the vote. During his presidency, the number of members has significantly increased. In 2005, he supported a &quot;yes&quot; vote in the [[French referendum on the European Constitution]], but the &quot;No&quot; vote won.
[[File:Flickr - europeanpeoplesparty - EPP Summit 14 December 2006 (15).jpg|thumb|Nicolas Sarkozy in 2006 with Cypriot opposition leader [[Nicos Anastasiades]]]]
Throughout 2005, Sarkozy called for radical changes in France's economic and social policies. These calls culminated in an interview with ''[[Le Monde]]'' on 8 September 2005, during which he claimed that the French had been misled for 30 years by false promises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sarkozyblog.free.fr/index.php?2005/09/07/170-le-meilleur-pour-la-france |title=Interview with ',Le Monde',, 8 September 2005 |publisher=Sarkozy Blog|date=19 September 2004 |accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other issues:
* he called for a simplified and &quot;fairer&quot; [[tax code|taxation system]], with fewer loopholes and a maximum taxation rate (all ''direct'' taxes combined) at 50 percent of revenue;
* he approved measures reducing or denying social support to [[unemployment|unemployed]] workers who refuse work offered to them;
* he pressed for a reduction in the [[budget deficit]], claiming that the French state has been living off [[credit (finance)|credit]] for some time.

Such policies are what are called in France ''libéral'' (that is, in favour of [[laissez-faire]] economic policies) or, with a pejorative undertone, ''ultra-libéral''. Sarkozy rejects this label of ''libéral'' and prefers to call himself a pragmatist.

Sarkozy opened another avenue of controversy by declaring that he wanted a reform of the immigration system, with [[:wikt:quota|quota]]s designed to admit the skilled workers needed by the French economy. He also wants to reform the current French system for foreign students, saying that it enables foreign students to take open-ended curricula in order to obtain residency in France; instead, he wants to select the best students to the best curricula in France.

In early 2006, the [[French parliament]] adopted a controversial bill known as [[DADVSI]], which reforms [[French copyright law]]. Since his party was divided on the issue, Sarkozy stepped in and organised meetings between various parties involved. Later, groups such as the Odebi League and EUCD.info alleged that Sarkozy personally and unofficially supported certain amendments to the law, which enacted strong penalties against designers of [[peer-to-peer]] systems.

==Presidential campaigns==
===2007 presidential campaign===

[[File:Segolene Royal Arcueil 18 septembre 2010 6.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Ségolène Royal]] was Sarkozy's final opponent during the second (last) round of the 2007 presidential election.]]
Sarkozy was a likely candidate for the presidency in 2007; in an oft-repeated comment made on television channel [[France 2]], when asked by a journalist whether he thought about the presidential election when he shaved in the morning, Sarkozy commented, &quot;Not just when I shave&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtl.fr/rtlinfo/article.asp?dicid=159060 Broadcast of &quot;France 2&quot;], 19 November 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2007, Sarkozy was chosen by the [[Union for a Popular Movement|UMP]] to be its candidate in the 2007 presidential election. Sarkozy, who was running unopposed, won 98 percent of the votes. Of the 327,000 UMP members who could vote, 69 percent participated in the online ballot.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6260275.stm Sarkozy nod for presidential run]&quot;, ''BBC News'', 14 January 2007. Retrieved 14 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2007, Sarkozy appeared on a televised debate on [[TF1]] where he expressed his support for [[affirmative action]] and the freedom to work overtime. Despite his opposition to [[same-sex marriage]], he advocated [[civil unions]] and the possibility for same-sex partners to inherit under the same regime as married couples. The law was voted in July 2007.&lt;ref&gt;It was included in the ''paquet fiscal'' that has been one of the first laws passed in Parliament&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 February, Sarkozy decided in favour of a projected second, non-[[nuclear power|nuclear]], [[Future French aircraft carrier|aircraft carrier]] for the national Navy (adding to the nuclear [[Charles de Gaulle (R 91)|''Charles de Gaulle'']]), during an official visit in [[Toulon]] with Defence Minister [[Michèle Alliot-Marie]]. &quot;This would allow permanently having an operational ship, taking into account the constraints of maintenance&quot;, he explained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marianne2007.info/index.php?id_plugin=266&amp;path=newsAFP/page2News.php&amp;ftpUrl=070207164849.bmmbl7vt.txt&amp;pos=1&amp;action=plugin Sarkozy pour un deuxième porte-avions français] (AFP)&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 March, President Jacques Chirac announced his support for Sarkozy. Chirac pointed out that Sarkozy had been chosen as presidential candidate for the ruling UMP party, and said: &quot;So it is totally natural that I give him my vote and my support.&quot; To focus on his campaign, Sarkozy stepped down as interior minister on 26 March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsmax.com/archives/articles/2007/3/21/92845.shtml?s=os France's Jacques Chirac Backs Nicolas Sarkozy]. 21 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the campaign, rival candidates had accused Sarkozy of being a &quot;candidate for brutality&quot; and of presenting hard-line views about France's future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6566649.stm French confused over the real Sarkozy]. 18 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents also accused him of courting conservative voters in policy-making in a bid to capitalise on right-wing sentiments among some communities. However, his popularity was sufficient to see him polling as the frontrunner throughout the later campaign period, consistently ahead of rival Socialist candidate, Ségolène Royal.

The first round of the presidential election was held on 22 April 2007. Sarkozy came in first with 31.18 percent of the votes, ahead of [[Ségolène Royal]] of the Socialists with 25.87 percent. In the second round, Sarkozy came out on top to win the election with 53.06 percent of the votes ahead of [[Ségolène Royal]] with 46.94 percent.&lt;ref&gt;Élection présidentielle de 2007—[http://www.interieur.gouv.fr/sections/a_votre_service/resultats-elections/PR2007/FE.html résultats définitifs] French Ministry of the Interior&lt;/ref&gt; In his speech immediately following the announcement of the election results, Sarkozy stressed the need for France's modernisation, but also called for national unity, mentioning that Royal was in his thoughts. In that speech, he claimed &quot;The French have chosen to break with the ideas, habits and behaviour of the past. I will restore the value of work, authority, merit and respect for the nation.&quot;

==Presidency==
{{Main|Presidency of Nicolas Sarkozy}}

On 6 May 2007, Nicolas Sarkozy became the sixth person to be elected President of the Fifth Republic (which was established in 1958), and the 23rd president in French history. He is the first French president to have been born after [[World War II]]. Indeed, his predecessor Jacques Chirac, the president born most recently apart from Sarkozy himself, was born in 1932.

The official transfer of power from Chirac to Sarkozy took place on 16 May at 11:00&amp;nbsp;am (9:00 UTC) at the [[Élysée Palace]], where he was given the authorization codes of the [[Force de Frappe|French nuclear arsenal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Samuel |first=Henry |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2007/05/17/wfra17.xml |title=Radiant Cécilia puts Sarkozy in the shade |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=17 May 2007 |accessdate=9 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the afternoon, the new President flew to Berlin to meet with German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]].

In addition to Kouchner, three more Sarkozy ministers are from the left, including [[Eric Besson]], who served as [[Ségolène Royal]]'s economic adviser at the beginning of her campaign. Sarkozy also appointed seven women to form a total cabinet of 15; one, Justice Minister [[Rachida Dati]], is the first woman of Northern African origin to serve in a French cabinet. Of the 15, two attended the elite [[École nationale d'administration]] (ENA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=9226982 France's New Government – A study in perpetual motion], ''[[The Economist]]'', 23 June 2007 {{En icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ministers were reorganised, with the controversial creation of a 'Ministry of Immigration, Integration, National Identity and Co-Development'—given to his right-hand man [[Brice Hortefeux]]—and of a 'Ministry of Budget, Public Accounts and Civil Administration'—handed out to [[Éric Wœrth]], supposed to prepare the replacement of only a third of all civil servants who retire. However, after the 17 June parliamentary elections, the Cabinet has been adjusted to 15 ministers and 16 deputy ministers, totalling 31 officials.

Shortly after taking office, Sarkozy began negotiations with Colombian president [[Álvaro Uribe]] and the left-wing [[guerrilla]] [[FARC]], regarding the release of hostages held by the rebel group, especially Franco-Colombian politician [[Ingrid Betancourt]]. According to some sources, Sarkozy himself asked for Uribe to release FARC's &quot;chancellor&quot; [[Rodrigo Granda]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacronica.com/EdicionEnLinea/Notas/Internacional/08062007/244942.aspx Llama G8 a FARC contribuir a liberación de rehenes], ''La Cronica'', 8 June 2007 {{Es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he announced on 24 July 2007, that French and European representatives had obtained the extradition of the [[HIV trial in Libya|Bulgarian nurses detained in Libya]] to their country.

On 8 June 2007, during the [[33rd G8 summit]] in [[Heiligendamm]], Sarkozy set a goal of reducing French [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] emissions by 50 percent by 2050 in order to prevent [[global warming]]. He then pushed forward Socialist [[Dominique Strauss-Kahn]] as European nominee to the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/economie/20070710.WWW000000271_fmi_strauss_kahn_candidat_officiel_de_lunion_europeenne.html FMI: Strauss-Kahn candidat officiel de l'Union européenne], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 10 July 2007 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics alleged that Sarkozy proposed to nominate Strauss-Kahn as managing director of the IMF to deprive the Socialist Party of one of its more popular figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSPAB00331220070707 France's Sarkozy wants Strauss-Kahn as IMF head] [[Reuters]], 7 July 2007 {{En icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Union for a Popular Movement]] (UMP), Sarkozy's party, won a majority at the [[French legislative election, 2007|June 2007 legislative election]], although by less than expected. In July, the UMP majority, seconded by the ''[[Nouveau Centre]]'', ratified one of Sarkozy's electoral promises, which was to partially revoke the [[inheritance tax]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/pratique-patrimoine/20070713.FIG000000211_les_deputes_votent_la_quasi_suppression_des_droits_de_succession.html Les députés votent la quasi-suppression des droits de succession], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', 13 July 2007 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/actualite/politiques/266891.FR.php Les droits de succession (presque) supprimés], ''[[Libération]]'', 13 July 2007 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inheritance tax formerly brought eight billion euros into state coffers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanite.fr/2007-06-07_Politique_Droits-de-succession-pour-une-minorite-de-menages-aises Droits de succession: pour une minorité de ménages aisés], ''[[L'Humanité]]'', 7 June 2007 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:G8 summit in L'Aquila, family photo.jpg|thumb|Sarkozy (at left) attending the [[35th G8 summit|G-8 Summit]] in 2009]]
Sarkozy's UMP majority prepared a budget that reduced taxes, in particular for [[upper middle-class]] people, allegedly in an effort to [[Supply-side economics|boost GDP growth]], but did not reduce state expenditures.&lt;!-- The vote of the budget hasn't taken place yet !! --&gt; He was criticised by the European Commission for doing so.

Sarkozy broke with the custom of [[amnesty]]ing traffic tickets and of releasing thousands of prisoners from overcrowded jails on [[Bastille Day]], a tradition that [[Napoleon]] had started in 1802 to commemorate the [[storming of the Bastille]] during the [[French Revolution]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WP Moore&quot; /&gt;

Sarkozy's government issued a [[decree]] on 7 August 2007 to generalise a voluntary [[biometric]] profiling program of travellers in airports. The program, called 'Parafes', was to use fingerprints. The [[governmental databases|new database]] would be interconnected with the [[Schengen Information System]] (SIS) as well as with a national database of wanted persons ([[Fichier des Personnes Recherchées|FPR]]). The Commission nationale de l'informatique et des libertés ([[CNIL]]) protested against this new decree, opposing itself to the recording of fingerprints and to the interconnection between the SIS and the FPR.&lt;ref name=Parafes&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-942808@51-931629,0.html Généralisation du fichage biométrique volontaire des voyageurs dans les aéroports français], ''[[Le Monde]]'', 8 August 2007 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 July 2008, the French parliament passed constitutional reforms which Sarkozy had made one of the key pledges of his presidential campaign. The vote was 539 to 357, one vote over the three-fifths majority required; the changes are not yet finalized. They would introduce a two-term limit for the presidency, and end the president's right of collective pardon. They would allow the president to address parliament in-session, and parliament, to set its own agenda. They would give parliament a veto over some presidential appointments, while ending government control over parliament's committee system. He has claimed that these reforms strengthen parliament, while some opposition socialist lawmakers have described it as a &quot;consolidation of a monocracy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;France backs constitution reform; [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/7517505.stm France backs constitution reform] BBC News, 21 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 July 2008, parliament voted the &quot;loi de modernisation de l'économie&quot; (Modernization of the Economy Law) which loosened restrictions on retail prices and reduced limitations on the creation of businesses. The Government has also made changes to long-standing French work-hour regulations, allowing employers to negotiate overtime with employees and making all hours worked past the traditional French 35-hour week tax-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displayStory.cfm?source=hptextfeature&amp;story_id=11792306|title=France—The reformist president|date=24 July 2008|accessdate=27 July 2008|work=The Economist }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, as a result of the [[global financial crisis of 2008|global financial crisis]] that came to a head in September 2008, Sarkozy has returned to the [[state interventionism]] of his predecessors, declaring that &quot;laissez-faire capitalism is over&quot; and denouncing the &quot;dictatorship of the market&quot;.

Sarkozy wielded special international power when France held the rotating EU Council Presidency from July 2008 through December 2008. Sarkozy has publicly stated his intention to attain EU approval of a [[progressivism|progressive]] energy package before the end of his EU Presidency. This energy package would clearly define climate change objectives for the EU and hold members to specific reductions in emissions. In further support of his collaborative outlook on climate change, Sarkozy has led the EU into a partnership with China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eubusiness.com/China/climate-change.23 New chapter opens in EU-China Climate Change Partnership] EUbusiness.com, 29 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 December 2008, Nicolas Sarkozy, as part of France's then presidency of the Council of the EU, met the [[Tenzin Gyatso|Dalai Lama]] in Poland and outraged China, which has announced that it would postpone the China-EU summit indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hm4uz6lCdhPdwJhNTl63SxPrkKhA |title=France's Sarkozy meets Dalai Lama as China fumes |publisher=Google |date=6 December 2008 |accessdate=9 March 2010|agency=AFP}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 April 2009, at the [[NATO]] Summit in [[Strasbourg]], Sarkozy announced that France would offer [[Right of asylum|asylum]] to a former [[Guantanamo captive]].&lt;ref name=HoustonChronicle2009-04-02&gt;

On 27 February 2011, Sarkozy did for the 10th time of his presidency a government reshuffle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dowjones.de/site/2011/02/frances-sarkozy-confirms-government-reshuffle.html |title=France's Sarkozy Confirms Government Reshuffle (Dow Jones Deutschland) |publisher=Dowjones.de |accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June 2011, he did an 11th government reshuffle, after the resignation of [[Christine Lagarde]], who was appointed to head the [[International Monetary Fund]]. Five new ministers were appointed.

===Middle East===

===Involvement in Libya===
[[File:Nicolas Sarkozy addresses the E-G8 Forum.jpg|thumb|Nicolas Sarkozy address the E-G8 Forum in Paris in 2011]]
In March 2011, after having been criticized for his unwillingness to support the Egyptian and Tunisian revolutions, and persuaded by the philosopher [[Bernard-Henri Levy]] to have France actively engage against the forces of the Libyan leader, [[Muammar Gaddafi]], Nicolas Sarkozy was amongst the first Heads of State to demand the resignation of Gaddafi and his government, which was then fighting a [[Libyan civil war|civil war in Libya]]. On 10 March 2011, Nicolas Sarkozy welcomed to the Elysee Palace, three emissaries from the [[National Transitional Council|Libyan National Transitional Council]] (NTC), brought to him by Bernard-Henri Levy who mediated at the meeting. Nicolas Sarkozy promised them a no-fly zone would be imposed on Gaddafi's aeroplanes. He also promised them France's military assistance. On 17 March 2011, at the behest of France, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973|resolution 1973]] was adopted by the Security Council of the United Nations, permitting the creation of a &quot;no fly&quot; zone over Libya, and for the undertaking of &quot;necessary measures&quot; for the protection of the country's civilian population. On 19 March 2011, Nicolas Sarkozy officially announced the beginning of a [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military intervention in Libya]], with [[Opération Harmattan|France's participation]]. These actions of Nicolas Sarkozy were favorably received by the majority of the French political class and public opinion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lejdd.fr/International/Actualite/La-Libye-un-veritable-succes-diplomatique-pour-Sarkozy-285403/ |title=La Libye, un véritable succès diplomatique pour Sarkozy? |publisher=leJDD.fr |accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.newyorker.com/?i=2011-12-12#folio=CV1] &quot;No Exit&quot; by Philip Gourevitch, 12 December 2011, New Yorker&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/02/world/africa/02levy.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Erlanger | title=In His Telling, One Man Made Libya a French Cause | date=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-Presidency==
After his defeat at the 2012 election, Nicolas Sarkozy asked his followers to respect Hollande's victory. He invited his successor with François Hollande to attend his last 8 May [[Victory in Europe Day]] commemoration. His last day as President of the French Republic was 15 May. 

He then went on holiday, invited by several heads of state, clearly signifying that he would not return to national politics in a short term. However, on 8 August, faced with the rising civil war in [[Syria]], he asked the government (particularly François Hollande and [[Laurent Fabius]], his Foreign Minister) to act quickly, speaking publicly for the first time since his defeat.

Former ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' journalist Colin Randall has highlighted Sarkozy's tighter control of his image and frequent interventions in the media: &quot;he censors a book, or fires the chief editor of a weekly.&quot;&lt;ref name=Leprince/&gt; Sarkozy is reported by Reuters to be sensitive about his height (believed to be {{convert|165|cm|ftin|abbr=on}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Socialists say Sarkozy has &quot;small man syndrome&quot; | url=http://www.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUSL2186523220070921 |agency=Reuters | date=21 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French media have pointed out that [[Sarkosy#Carla Bruni|Carla Bruni]] frequently wears flats when in public with him. In 2009, this was the subject of a political row, when a worker at a factory where Sarkozy gave a speech said she was asked to stand next to him because she was of a similar height (this story was corroborated by some trade union officials). The president's office called the accusation &quot;completely absurd and grotesque&quot;, while the Socialist Party mocked his fastidious preparation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8243486.stm#graphic|title=Sarkozy height row grips France |publisher=BBC News |date=8 August 2009|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarkozy lost a suit against a manufacturer of Sarkozy [[voodoo doll]]s, in which he claimed that he had a right to his own image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2008/10/30/europe/france.php &quot;France enjoys Sarkozy's voodoo doll setback&quot;] by Katrin Bennhold, [[International Herald Tribune]], 30 October 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
{{Criticism section|date=May 2011}}
Generally, Sarkozy is strongly disliked by the Left, and is also criticised by some on the Right, most vocally by supporters of [[Jacques Chirac]] and [[Dominique de Villepin]], such as [[Jean-Louis Debré]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marianne2007.info/Cette-droite-qui-dit-non-a-Sarkozy_a313.html|title=Cette droite qui dit &quot;non&quot; à Sarkozy|publisher=Marianne2007.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.la-croix.com/article/index.jsp?docId=2288253&amp;rubId=4076|title=Boutin renonce à se présenter et soutient Sarkozy|work=La Croix |location=France}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine ''[[Marianne (magazine)|Marianne]]'' accused Sarkozy of changing opinion in an [[Airbus]] affair.&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:kUwVpYZ23QMJ:www.marianne2.fr/Le-retournement-de-Sarkozy-sur-Airbus_a884.html Marianne – Le retournement de Sarkozy sur la recapitulisation de la société Airbus], 5 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[French Communist Party|communist]]-leaning magazine ''[[L'Humanité]]'' accused Sarkozy of being a [[populism|populist]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[L'Humanité]]'', [http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2005-06-11/2005-06-11-808328 Humanite.presse.fr], 11 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Anti Sarko 480342767 8b13c8532f o d.jpg|thumb|Many on the Left have a particular distrust for Nicolas Sarkozy; specific &quot;anti-Sarko&quot; movements have been started]]

In 2004 Sarkozy co-authored a book, ''La République, les religions, l'espérance'' (''The Republic, Religions, and Hope''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|coauthors=Thibaud Collin, Philippe Verdin|last=Sarkozy|first=Nicolas|title=La République, les religions, l'espérance|publisher=[[Les éditions du Cerf]]|year=2004|isbn=2-204-07283-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he argued that the young should not be brought up solely on secular or [[republicanism|republican]] values. He advocated reducing the [[separation of church and state]], arguing for the government [[subsidy]] of mosques in order to encourage Islamic integration into French society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=L'Etat Doit-Il Financer La Construction de Mosquées&amp;nbsp;?|publisher=Libres.org|language=French|date=2 July 2007|url=http://www.libres.org/francais/actualite/archives/actualit%E9_1004/mosquees_a5_4504.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He opposes financing of religious institutions with funds from outside France. After meeting with [[Tom Cruise]], Sarkozy was criticised by some for meeting with a member of the [[Church of Scientology]], which is seen as a cult in France (see [[Parliamentary Commission on Cults in France]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Worldwide Religious News'', 2 September 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Sarkozy stated that &quot;the roots of France are essentially Christian&quot; at December 2007 speech in Rome. He called Islam &quot;one of the greatest and most beautiful civilizations the world has known&quot; at a speech in [[Riyadh]] in January 2008. Both comments drew criticism from Christians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=French President's religious mixing riles critics|url=http://www.christiantoday.com/article/french.presidents.religious.mixing.riles.critics/16423.htm|date=23 January 2008|work=Christianity Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of a tense period and following the accidental death of an 11-year-old boy in the Paris suburb of [[La Courneuve]] in June 2005, Sarkozy quoted a local resident and vowed to clean the area out &quot;with a [[Kärcher]]&quot; (''nettoyer la cité au Kärcher'', referring to a well-known German brand of pressure-cleaning equipment), and two days before the [[2005 civil unrest in France|2005 Paris riots]] he referred to the criminal youth of the housing projects as ''voyous'' (thugs) and ''racaille'', a slang term which can be translated into English as ''rabble'', ''scum'' or ''riff-raff'';&lt;ref&gt;answering to a resident who addressed Sarkozy with &quot;''Quand nous débarrassez-vous de cette racaille ?''&quot; (When will you rid us of these dregs?) – {{cite news|title=Banlieues&amp;nbsp;: filmer et raconter avec Françoise Laborde, Claude Dilain, Nicolas Comte, Guillaume Biet (Les videos)|work=Arrêt sur images|language=French|publisher=[[France 5]]|date=6 November 2005|url=http://www.france5.fr/asi/007548/10/129836.cfm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070703031423/http://www.france5.fr/asi/007548/10/129836.cfm|archivedate=3 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[French Communist Party]]'s publication ''L'Humanité'' branded this language as inappropriate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Nicolas Sarkozy pompier pyromane|work=L'Humanité |location=France|date=2 November 2005|url=http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2005-11-02/2005-11-02-817109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Sarkozy's use of the word ''racaille'' many people in the ''banlieues'' identified him as a politician of the far right. His period as Interior Minister had seen the use of police as shock troops in the ''banlieues'' and a police &quot;raid&quot; on the suburb of [[Clichy-sous-Bois]] in October 2005 had led to two boys being electrocuted in a power sub-station. The riots began that night.&lt;ref&gt;The Independent, 17 April 2007, p.20 ''The banlieues prepare to vote: &quot; We hate Sarkozy because he hates us&quot; ''&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005 Sarkozy was accused of pushing for a hasty inquiry into an arson attack on a police station in [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]], of which the alleged perpetrators were [[acquittal|acquitted]] for lack of proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Incendie de Pau&amp;nbsp;: les 8 accusés acquittés|agency=[[Associated Press]]|work=Le Nouvel Observateur |location=France|language=French|date=1 October 2005|url=http://permanent.nouvelobs.com/societe/20051001.OBS0822.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080529212216rn_1/archquo.nouvelobs.com/cgi/articles?ad=societe/20051001.OBS0822.html&amp;host=http://permanent.nouvelobs.com/|archivedate=29 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 June 2005 Sarkozy told law enforcement officials that he had questioned the Minister of Justice about the future of &quot;the judge&quot; who had freed a man on parole who had later committed a murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nicolas Sarkozy veut faire &quot;&amp;nbsp;payer&amp;nbsp;&quot; un juge pour &quot;&amp;nbsp;sa faute&amp;nbsp;&quot;|work=Le Monde|language=French|format=Fee required for full article|date=23 June 2005|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3224,36-665357@51-660372,0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarkozy opposed the U.S.-led [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]]. However, he was critical of the way Jacques Chirac and his foreign minister [[Dominique de Villepin]] expressed France's opposition to the war. Talking at the French-American Foundation in Washington, D.C. on 12 September 2006, he denounced what he called the &quot;French arrogance&quot; and said: &quot;It is bad manners to embarrass one's allies or sound like one is taking delight in their troubles.&quot;&lt;ref name=Iraq_speech&gt;{{Fr icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/actualite/politiques/205032.FR.php|title=Chirac juge &quot;lamentable&quot; l'atlantisme de Sarkozy|author=[[Libération]]|date=18 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added: &quot;We must never again turn our disagreements into a crisis.&quot; Jacques Chirac reportedly said in private that Sarkozy's speech was &quot;appalling&quot; and &quot;a shameful act&quot;.&lt;ref name=Iraq_speech/&gt;

Even though his former foreign minister [[Bernard Kouchner]] (excluded from the Socialist party after his inclusion in [[François Fillon]]'s government) had been one of the few supporters in France of removal of [[Saddam Hussein]] from power, Sarkozy's stance on the war has not changed.

A few weeks before the first round of the 2007 presidential elections, Sarkozy said during an interview with philosopher [[Michel Onfray]]&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophie Magazine'', nr 8, April 2007; [http://philomag.com/article,dialogue,nicolas-sarkozy-et-michel-onfray-confidences-entre-ennemis,288.php online extracts]&lt;/ref&gt; that he thinks disorders such as [[paedophilia]] and depression have a [[gene]]tic as well as social basis, saying &quot;I don't agree with you, I'd be inclined to think that one is born a paedophile, and it is actually a problem that we do not know how to cure this disease&quot;; he also claimed that suicides among youth were linked to genetic predispositions by stating, &quot;I don't want to give parents a complex. It's not exclusively the parents' fault every time a youngster commits suicide.&quot; These statements were criticised by some scientists, including controversial geneticist [[Axel Kahn]].&lt;ref&gt;[[L'Humanité]], 4 April 2007, ''[http://www.humanite.presse.fr/journal/2007-04-04/2007-04-04-848961 « Un gène ne commande jamais un destin humain »]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Le Monde]], 11 April 2007, ''[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-823448,36-894367@51-893376,0.html Tollé dans la communauté scientifique après les propos de Nicolas Sarkozy sur la génétique]''&lt;/ref&gt; Sarkozy later said, &quot;What part is innate and what part is acquired? At least let's debate it, let's not close the door to all debate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian'', 10 April 2007, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/france/story/0,,2053956,00.html &quot;Row over Sarkozy's paedophilia comment refuses to go away&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 July 2007, Sarkozy delivered a speech in Senegal, written by Henri Guaino, in which he made reference to &quot;African [[peasant]]s&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;news24Africa&quot;&gt;''News24.com''; 28 July 2007; [http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/News/0,,2-11-1447_2154961,00.html Sarkozy's Africa vision under fire]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianAfrica&quot;&gt;Chris McGreal;''The Guardian'' (UK) 27 August 2007 [http://www.guardian.co.uk/france/story/0,,2156809,00.html Mbeki criticised for praising 'racist' Sarkozy]&lt;/ref&gt; The controversial remarks were widely condemned by Africans, who viewed them as racist.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianAfrica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michel Agier, [http://www.vacarme.eu.org/article1493.html l'Afrique en France après le discours de Dakar], ''Vacarme'' n°42 {{Fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mgAfrica&quot;&gt;[[Achille Mbembe]]; ''Mail and Guardian (South Africa)''; 27 August 2007; [http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=317571&amp;area=/insight/insight__comment_and_analysis/ Sacré bleu! Mbeki and Sarkozy?]&lt;/ref&gt; South African president [[Thabo Mbeki]] praised Sarkozy's speech, which raised criticism by some in the South African media.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardianAfrica&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mgAfrica&quot;/&gt;

On 23 February 2008, Sarkozy was filmed by a reporter for French newspaper ''[[Le Parisien]]'' having the following exchange while visiting the [[Paris International Agricultural Show]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Premiers pas mouvementés de Sarkozy au salon de l'agriculture |work=Le Parisien |location=France|language=French|format=[[SWF]]|date=23 February 2008|url=http://videos.leparisien.fr/video/iLyROoaftL1D.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
While quickly crossing the hall Saturday morning, in the middle of the crowd, Sarkozy encounters a recalcitrant visitor who refuses to shake his hand. &quot;Ah no, don't touch me!&quot;, said the man. The president retorted immediately: &quot;Get lost, then.&quot; &quot;You're making me dirty&quot;, yelled the man. With a frozen smile, Sarkozy says, his teeth glistening, a refined &quot;Get lost, then, poor dumb-ass, go.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;In French: ''Lors de sa traversée éclair du salon samedi matin, en plein bain de foule, Sarkozy croise un visiteur récalcitrant qui refuse sa poignée de main. «Ah non, touche-moi pas», prévient-il. Le chef de l'État rétorque sans détour : «Casse-toi, alors.» «Tu me salis», embraye l'homme. Le sourire se crispe. Sarkozy lâche, desserrant à peine les dents, un raffiné «Casse-toi alors, pauv'con, va».''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This exchange has been cause for much humour and debate regarding its propriety in the French press. It should also be noted that a precise translation into English has many possible variations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Goldhammer|first=Arthur|authorlink=Arthur Goldhammer|url=http://artgoldhammer.blogspot.com/2008/02/found-on-web.html|title=Found on the web|work=French Politics|publisher=An American observer comments on French politics|date=25 February 2008|accessdate=9 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.za/News/Article.aspx?id=713778 &quot;French supporters defend Sarkozy&quot;] [[Agence France-Presse]], 25 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=334307|title=Sarkozy runs afoul of critics with rank reply|author=Crispian Balmer|agency=[[Reuters]]|location=Toronto|work=National Post |location=Canada |page=A2|date=26 February 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;br&gt;&amp;bull; Article noted at [http://www.fpinfomart.ca/news/ar_results.php?q=1136115&amp;sort=pubd&amp;page=1&amp;n%5Bdb%5D%5B%5D=ntnp&amp;n%5Bby%5D%5B%5D=Crispian+Balmer fpinfomart.ca], but is not available.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August 2008, Hervé Eon, from [[Laval, Mayenne|Laval]] came to an anti-Sarkozy demonstration with a sign bearing the words ''Casse-toi pov' con'', the exact words Sarkozy had uttered. Eon was arrested for causing offence to the presidential function and the prosecutor, who in France indirectly reports to the president, requested a fine of 1000€.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Poignard |first=Anne-Claire|title=&quot;&amp;nbsp;Casse-toi, pauvre con&amp;nbsp;!&amp;nbsp;&quot;&amp;nbsp;: quatre mots à 1&amp;nbsp;000 euros|work=Le Monde|language=French|format=Fee required for full article|date=24 October 2008|url= http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2008/10/24/casse-toi-pauvre-con-quatre-mots-a-1-000-euros_1110685_823448.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Eon|title=&quot;&amp;nbsp;Casse-toi pov'con&amp;nbsp;&quot;&amp;nbsp;: au tribunal pour outrage au Président|language=French|publisher=[[Rue 89]]|date=4 September 2008|url=http://www.rue89.com/2008/09/04/casse-toi-povcon-au-tribunal-pour-outrage-au-president}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court eventually imposed a symbolic 30€ suspended fine, which has generally been interpreted as a defeat for the prosecution side.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rue89.com/2008/11/06/casse-toi-povcon-30-euros-avec-sursis-pour-herve-eon |title=&quot; Casse-toi pov'con&quot; : 30 euros avec sursis pour Hervé Eon |publisher=Rue89 |date=14 November 2008 |accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident was widely reported on, in particular as Sarkozy, as president of the Republic, is [[Sovereign immunity|immune from prosecution]], notably restricting Eon's rights to sue Sarkozy for defamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Raphaëlle Besse Desmoulières|title=Le délit d'outrage est une infraction obsolète|work=Le Monde|language=French|date=23 October 2008|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2008/10/23/le-delit-d-outrage-est-une-infraction-obsolete_1110460_3224.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 November 2009, Sarkozy posted on his Facebook page a picture supposedly showing him chipping away at the [[Berlin Wall]] during its fall. However, the dates were inconsistent and the picture was proven to be fake – and later archived footage confirmed this. This news of forgery spread in France, and later evolved into a meme, &quot;Sarkozy Was There&quot;, where Sarkozy is photoshopped into historical events.

On 5 July 2010, following its investigations on the [[Bettencourt affair]], online newspaper [[Mediapart]] ran an article in which Claire Thibout, an ex-accountant working for [[Liliane Bettencourt]], accused Nicolas Sarkozy and [[Eric Woerth]] of receiving illegal campaign donations in 2007, in cash.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediapart.fr/ ''L'ex-comptable des Bettencourt accuse: des enveloppes d'argent à Woerth et à Sarkozy''], original report, in French&lt;!-- right now on the main page, no other URL --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e72598de-88d5-11df-8925-00144feab49a.html?ftcamp=rss|title=Financial Times article|work=Financial Times |date=6 July 2010|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 July 2010, Sarkozy suggested a new policy of security, and he proposed &quot;stripping foreign-born French citizens who opted to acquire their nationality at their majority of their citizenship if they are convicted of threatening the life of a police officer or other serious crimes&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Casting Out the Un-French&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/06/opinion/06fri2.html?_r=1&amp;ref=nicolas_sarkozy|work=The New York Times|title=Casting Out the Un-French|date=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This policy has been criticized for example by the US newspaper ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Casting Out the Un-French&quot;/&gt; by Sarkozy's political opponents, including the leader of the [[Socialist Party (France)|PS]], [[Martine Aubry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lepoint.fr/politique/securite-aubry-denonce-la-derive-antirepublicaine-de-sarkozy-et-de-sa-majorite-01-08-2010-1221034_20.php |title=Réaction : SÉCURITÉ – Aubry dénonce la &quot;dérive antirépublicaine&quot; de Sarkozy et de sa majorité, actualité Politique : Le Point|work=Le Point |location=France|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by experts of French law, including the ex-member of the [[Constitutional Council of France]], [[Robert Badinter]], who said that such action would be unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2010/08/02/badinter-rappelle-a-sarkozy-l-egalite-de-tous-les-francais-devant-la-loi_1394701_823448.html|title=Badinter rappelle à Sarkozy l'égalité de tous les Français devant la loi|work=Le Monde |location=France|accessdate=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
