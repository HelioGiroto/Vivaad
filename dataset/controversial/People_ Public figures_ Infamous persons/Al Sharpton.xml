In 1963 Sharpton's father left his wife to have a relationship with Al Sharpton's half-sister. Ada Sharpton took a job as a maid, but her income was so low that the family qualified for [[welfare (financial aid)|welfare]] and had to move from [[middle class]] [[Hollis, Queens|Hollis]], [[Queens]], to the [[public housing]] projects in the [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]] neighborhood of Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/politics/national/2004race/5570/ |title=Rev Vs.

==Activism==
{{Wikinews|Al Sharpton speaks out on race, rights and what bothers him about his critics}}
In 1969, Sharpton was appointed by [[Jesse Jackson]] as youth director of [[Operation Breadbasket]], a group that focused on the promotion of new and better jobs for [[African-Americans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN 2004&quot;&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/special/president/candidates/sharpton.html Candidates - Al Sharpton], CNN's &quot;America Votes 2004&quot;, Retrieved April 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 Sharpton founded the [[National Youth Movement]] to raise resources for impoverished youth.&lt;ref name=&quot; &quot;&gt;[http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/biography.asp?bioindex=171 Sharpton Biography], thehistorymakers.com, web site access April 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bernhard Goetz===
{{details|Bernhard Goetz}}
[[Bernhard Goetz]] shot four African-American men on a New York subway train on December 22, 1984, when they approached him and allegedly tried to rob him. At his trial Goetz was cleared of all charges except criminal possession of a weapon. Sharpton led several marches protesting what he saw as the weak prosecution of the case.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Slackman, &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/05/us/sharpton-runs-for-presidency-and-influence.html Sharpton Runs for Presidency, and Influence]&quot;, ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 5, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharpton and other civil rights leaders said Goetz's actions were racist and requested a federal civil rights investigation.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/1985/01/29/nyregion/the-city-us-prosecution-of-goetz-sought.html U.S. Prosecution Of Goetz Sought]&quot;, ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 29, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; A federal investigation concluded the shooting was due to an attempted robbery and not race.&lt;ref&gt;David E. Pitt, &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/1987/06/18/nyregion/blacks-see-goetz-verdict-as-blow-to-race-relations.html Blacks See Goetz Verdict As Blow To Race Relations]&quot;, ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 18, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Howard Beach===
On December 20, 1986 three African-American men were assaulted in the [[Howard Beach, Queens|Howard Beach]] neighborhood of [[Queens]] by a mob of white men. The three men were chased by their attackers onto the [[Belt Parkway]], where one of them, [[Michael Griffith (manslaughter victim)|Michael Griffith]], was struck and killed by a passing motorist.&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. McFadden, &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/21/nyregion/black-man-dies-after-beating-by-whites-in-queens.html Black Man Dies After Beating In Queens]&quot;, ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 21, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

A week later, on December 27, Sharpton led 1,200 [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrators]] on a march through the streets of Howard Beach. Residents of the neighborhood, who were overwhelmingly white, screamed [[Nigger|racial epithets]] at the protesters, who were largely black.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Smothers, &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/28/nyregion/1200-protesters-of-racial-attack-march-in-queens.html 1,200 Protesters Of Racial Attack March In Queens]&quot;, ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 28, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; Sharpton's role in the case, which led to the appointment of a [[special prosecutor]] by [[New York]] Governor [[Mario Cuomo]] after the two surviving victims refused to co-operate with the Queens [[district attorney]], helped propel him to national prominence.

===Bensonhurst===
[[Image:Al Sharpton, 1989 Protest March, Brooklyn NY.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Sharpton leading the first protest march over the death of Yusef Hawkins in Bensonhurst, 1989]]
On August 23, 1989, four African-American teenagers were beaten by a group of 10 to 30 white Italian-American youths in [[Bensonhurst, Brooklyn|Bensonhurst]], a [[Brooklyn]] neighborhood. One Bensonhurst resident, armed with a handgun, shot and killed sixteen-year-old [[Yusef Hawkins]].

In the weeks following the assault and murder, Sharpton led several marches through Bensonhurst. The first protest, just days after the incident, was greeted by neighborhood residents shouting &quot;Niggers go home&quot; and holding watermelons to mock the demonstrators.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Ravo, &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/27/nyregion/marchers-and-brooklyn-youths-trade-racial-jeers.html Marchers and Brooklyn Youths Trade Racial Jeers]&quot;, ''[[The New York Times]]'', August 27, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharpton also threatened that Hawkins' three companions would not cooperate with prosecutor [[Elizabeth Holtzman]] unless her office agreed to hire more black attorneys. In the end, they cooperated.&lt;ref&gt;John DeSantis. ''For the Color of His Skin: The Murder of Yusuf Hawkins and the Trial of Bensonhurst''. 1991. New York: Pharos Books. ISBN 978-0-88687-621-0. p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1990 when one of the two leaders of the mob was acquitted of the most serious charges brought against him, Sharpton led another protest through Bensonhurst. In January 1991, when other members of the gang were given light sentences, Sharpton planned another march for January 12, 1991. Before that demonstration began, neighborhood resident [[Michael Riccardi]] tried to kill Sharpton by stabbing him in the chest.&lt;ref&gt;Robert D. McFadden, &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/13/nyregion/sharpton-is-stabbed-at-bensonhurst-protest.html Sharpton Is Stabbed at Bensonhurst Protest]&quot;, ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 13, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; Sharpton recovered from his wounds, and later asked the judge for leniency when Riccardi was sentenced.&lt;ref&gt;Lee A. Daniels, &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/1992/03/17/nyregion/attacker-of-sharpton-is-sentenced.html Attacker Of Sharpton Is Sentenced]&quot;, ''[[The New York Times]]'', March 17, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

===National Action Network===
[[Image:Al Sharpton 2 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|Al Sharpton at National Action Network's headquarters.]]
In 1991, Sharpton founded the [[National Action Network]], an organization designed to increase voter education, to provide services to those in [[poverty]], and to support small community businesses.&lt;ref name=NAN/&gt;

===Crown Heights Riot===
{{details|Crown Heights riot}}
The [[Crown Heights riot]] began on August 19, 1991 after a car driven by a Jewish man, and part of a procession led by an unmarked police car, went through an intersection and was struck by another vehicle causing it to veer onto the sidewalk where it accidentally struck and killed a seven-year-old [[Guyana|Guyanese]] boy named [[Gavin Cato]] and severely injured his cousin Angela. Witnesses could not agree upon the speed and could not agree whether the light was yellow or red. One of the factors that sparked the riot was the arrival of a private ambulance, which was later discovered to be on the orders of a police officer who was worried for the Jewish driver's safety, removed him from the scene while Cato lay pinned under his car.&lt;ref name=forget/&gt; Cato and his cousin were treated soon after by a city ambulance (without visibly Jewish EMTs). Caribbean-American and African-American residents of the neighborhood rioted for four consecutive days fueled by rumors that the private ambulance had refused to treat Cato.&lt;ref name=forget&gt;{{cite news | title= As a Divided Community Begins to Forget, a Court Reopens Old Wounds in Crown Heights | date= January 22, 2002 | publisher= | url =http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0203,kamber,31532,1.html | work =The Village Voice | accessdate = April 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=closet/&gt; During the riot black youths looted stores,&lt;ref name=forget/&gt; beat Jews in the street,&lt;ref name=forget/&gt; and clashed with groups of Jews, hurling rocks and bottles at one another&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= John Kifner | title= A Boy's Death Ignites Clashes in Crown Heights | work= The New York Times| url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D0CE1D6173EF932A1575BC0A967958260 | date= August 21, 1991 | accessdate = March 28, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; after Yankel Rosenbaum, a visiting student from Australia, was stabbed and killed by a member of a mob while some chanted &quot;Kill the Jew&quot;, and &quot;get the Jews out&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Things Go Seriously Wrong | date= June 1, 2003 | publisher= | url =http://www.gothamgazette.com/article//20030602/4/408 | work =The Gotham Gazette | accessdate = April 6, 2007 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070427090825/http://www.gothamgazette.com/article//20030602/4/408| archivedate= April 27, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sharpton marched through Crown Heights and in front of [[770 Eastern Parkway|&quot;770&quot;]], shortly after the riot, with about 400 protesters (who chanted &quot;Whose streets? Our streets!&quot; and &quot;No justice, no peace!&quot;), in spite of Mayor [[David Dinkins]]'s attempts to keep the march from happening.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1991/08/25/nyregion/tension-in-brooklyn-blacks-march-by-hasidim-through-a-corridor-of-blue.html?pagewanted=all &quot;Tension in Brooklyn; Blacks March by Hasidim Through a Corridor of Blue&quot;].

===Freddie's Fashion Mart===
In 1995 a black Pentecostal Church, the United House of Prayer, which owned a retail property on [[125th Street (Manhattan)|125th Street]], asked Fred Harari, a [[Jewish]] tenant who operated Freddie's &lt;!-- this is the verified spelling --&gt; Fashion Mart, to evict his longtime subtenant, a black-owned record store called The Record Shack. Sharpton led a protest in [[Harlem]] against the planned eviction of The Record Shack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/09/nyregion/bad-luck-and-horror-for-seven-in-a-shop.html |title=Bad Luck and Horror for Seven in a Shop| work = [[The New York Times]]| last=Sexton| first=Joe| date=December 9, 1995| accessdate=April 13, 2007| page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New Yorker Reflect on a Massacre in Harlem|publisher=Albany Times Union/Associated Press |last=Pyle|first=Richard |date=December 12, 1995| accessdate=April 13, 2007| page=B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Barry | first = Dan | author-link = Dan Barry (reporter) | title = Death on 128th street: The dispute; Plans to Evict Record-Shop Owner Roiled Residents | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | page = 31 | date = December 9, 1995 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/1995/12/09/nyregion/death-128th-street-dispute-plans-evict-record-shop-owner-roiled-residents.html | accessdate = July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharpton told the protesters, &quot;We will not stand by and allow them to move this brother so that some white interloper can expand his business.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Sharpton's Victory |first=Rich |last=Lowry|authorlink=Rich Lowry |journal=National Review |date=December 3, 2003 |accessdate=April 16, 2007 |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/lowry/lowry200312030840.asp| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070416024237/http://www.nationalreview.com/lowry/lowry200312030840.asp| archivedate= April 16, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 8, 1995 Roland J. Smith Jr., one of the protesters, entered Harari's store with a gun and flammable liquid, shot several customers and set the store on fire.

In 1999, Sharpton led a protest to raise awareness about the death of [[Amadou Diallo]], an immigrant from [[Guinea]] who was shot to death by [[NYPD]] officers. Sharpton claimed that Diallo's death was the result of [[police brutality]] and [[racial profiling]]. Diallo's family was later awarded $3&amp;nbsp;million in a wrongful death suit filed against the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= $3 Million Deal in Police Killing of Diallo in '99 | date= July 1, 2004 | publisher= | url =http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/07/nyregion/07DIAL.html?pagewanted=all | work =The New York Times | accessdate = April 6, 2007 | first=Alan | last=Feuer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{details|Sean Bell shooting incident}}
On November 25, 2006 Sean Bell was shot and killed in the [[Jamaica, Queens|Jamaica]] section of [[Queens]] in [[New York City]] by plainclothes detectives from the New York Police Department in a hail of 50 bullets. The incident sparked fierce criticism of the police from the public and drew comparisons to the 1999 killing of Amadou Diallo. Three of the five detectives involved in the shooting went to trial in 2008 on charges ranging from manslaughter to reckless endangerment but were found not guilty.

===Dunbar Village===
On March 11, 2007 Sharpton held a press conference to highlight what he said was unequal treatment of four suspected rapists in a high-profile crime in the Dunbar Village Housing Projects in [[West Palm Beach, Florida]]. The suspects, who were young black men, were arrested for allegedly raping and beating a black [[Haiti]]an woman at gunpoint. The crime also involved forcing the woman to perform oral sex on her 12-year-old son.&lt;ref name=Dunbar&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/palmbeach/sfl-311sharpton,0,1042033.story |title=Sharpton says Dunbar Village defendants being treated unfairly |accessdate=October 28, 2009 |last=Othón |first=Nancy L. |date=March 11, 2008 |work=[[South Florida Sun-Sentinel]] |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080314141109/http://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/local/palmbeach/sfl-311sharpton,0,1042033.story |archivedate=March 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At his press conference Sharpton said that any violent act toward a woman is inexcusable but he felt that the accused youths were being treated unfairly because they were black. Sharpton contrasted the treatment of the suspects, who remain in jail, with white suspects involved in a gang rape—which he claimed was equivalent to the Dunbar Village attack—who were released after posting bond.&lt;ref name=Dunbar/&gt;

==Political views==

===2008 presidential race===
In September 2007 when he was asked whether he thought it was important for the US to have a black president, Sharpton said, &quot;It would be a great moment as long as the black candidate was supporting the interest that would inevitably help our people. A lot of my friends went with [[Clarence Thomas]] and regret it to this day. I don't assume that just because somebody's my color, they're my kind.

===Gay rights===
Sharpton is a supporter of equal rights for [[gay]]s and [[lesbian]]s, including [[same-sex marriage]]. During his presidential campaign in 2003, Sharpton said he thought it was insulting to be asked to discuss the issue of gay marriage. &quot;It's like asking do I support black marriage or white marriage.... The inference of the question is that gays are not like other human beings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Democrats divided on gay marriage |first=Marc |last=Sandalow |date=July 16, 2003 |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2003/07/16/MN75663.DTL |accessdate=January 11, 2008 |publisher=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comments on Jews===
During the [[Crown Heights Riot]], Sharpton (who arranged a rally in Crown Heights after Cato's death&lt;ref name=forget/&gt;) has been seen by some commentators as inflaming tensions by making remarks that included &quot;If the Jews want to get it on, tell them to pin their yarmulkes back and come over to my house&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sharpton Calls For a Boycott Of Classes|

During 2007 Sharpton was accused of bigotry for comments he made on May 7, 2007, concerning presidential candidate [[Mitt Romney]] and his religion, [[Mormonism]]:
:&quot;As for the one Mormon running for office, those who really believe in God will defeat him anyways, so don't worry about that; that's a temporary situation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/05/09/romney.sharpton.ap/ Sharpton accused of 'bigotry' after remark on faith], CNN, May 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 9 during an interview on ''[[Paula Zahn NOW]]'', Sharpton said that his views on Mormonism were based on the &quot;[[Black people and Mormonism|Mormon Church's traditionally racist views regarding blacks]]&quot; and its interpretation of the so-called &quot;[[Curse of Ham#In the Latter-day Saint Movement|Curse of Ham]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/10/us/politics/10romney.html Romney Accuses Sharpton of a Bigoted Remark], ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 10, Sharpton called two [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] and apologized to them for his remarks and asked to meet with them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,660219496,00.html Sharpton apologizes to LDS Church apostles], ''[[Deseret News]]'', May 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for the Church confirmed that Sharpton had called and said that &quot;we appreciate it very much, Rev.

===Tawana Brawley controversy===
{{details|Tawana Brawley rape allegations}}
[[File:Al Sharpton to David Shankbone on whether he is tired of hearing about Tawana Brawley.ogg|thumb|Al Sharpton interviewed in 2007 on whether he is tired of hearing about Tawana Brawley twenty years later.]]
On November 28, 1987, [[Tawana Brawley]], a 15-year-old African-American girl, was found smeared with [[feces]], lying in a garbage bag, her clothing torn and burned and with various slurs and epithets written on her body in charcoal. Brawley claimed she had been assaulted and [[rape]]d by six white men, some of them police officers, in the town of [[Wappinger, New York]].

Attorneys [[Alton H. Maddox]] and [[C. Vernon Mason]] joined Sharpton in support of Brawley. A [[grand jury]] was convened; after seven months of examining police and medical records, the jury determined that Brawley had fabricated her story. Sharpton, Maddox, and Mason accused the [[Dutchess County, New York|Dutchess County]] prosecutor, [[Steven Pagones]], of racism and of being one of the perpetrators of the alleged abduction and rape. The three were successfully sued for slander and ordered to pay $345,000 in damages, the jury finding Sharpton liable for making seven defamatory statements about Pagones, Maddox for two, and Mason for one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Winner in Brawley suit says victory is bittersweet | date= 1998-14-01 | url =http://www.cnn.com/US/9807/13/brawley.verdict.02/ | publisher = CNN | accessdate = April 6, 2007 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070320025016/http://www.cnn.com/US/9807/13/brawley.verdict.02/ |archivedate = March 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharpton refused to pay his share of the damages; it was later paid by a number of black business leaders.&lt;ref name=closet&gt;{{cite news | title= The skeletons and suits in Sharpton's closet | url =http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/06/20/sharpton/index.html?pn=2 | publisher =Salon | accessdate = April 6, 2007 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070418001602/http://dir.salon.com/story/news/feature/2003/06/20/sharpton/index.html?pn=2| archivedate= April 18, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 Sharpton said he would have accepted the case the same as he does today. The only difference would be he would not have made it so personal with Pagones, but he still felt Brawley had a good case to go to trial. &quot;I disagreed with the grand jury on Brawley,&quot; said Sharpton in an interview. &quot;I believed there was enough evidence to go to trial. Grand jury said there wasn't. Okay, fine. Do I have a right to disagree with the grand jury? Many Americans believe [[O.J. Simpson]] was guilty. A jury said he wasn't. So I have as much right to question a jury as they do. Does it make somebody a racist? No! They just disagreed with the jury. So did I.&quot; &lt;ref name=DS&gt;[[n:Al Sharpton speaks out on race, rights and what bothers him about his critics|Interview with Al Sharpton]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', December 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thurmond was notable as the longest serving Senator (at the time of his death) who was a major advocate of [[racial segregation]] during the middle of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Goldman, [http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20070225/ap_on_re_us/sharpton_thurmond Slavery ties Sharpton to Thurmond], Associated Press, February 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Thurmond's illegitimate daughter, [[Essie Mae Washington-Williams]], stated she would welcome Sharpton to the family if a [[DNA]] test shows he is a relative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Katrina A. |last=Goggins |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/02/27/AR2007022700763.html |title=Thurmond Child Says Sharpton Overreacted |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=February 27, 2007 |accessdate=April 15, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Sharpton said he has no plans for the DNA test to see if he is related.&lt;ref name=DS/&gt;

The Sharpton family name originated with Coleman Sharpton's previous slave-owner, who was named Alexander Sharpton.&lt;ref&gt;Al Sharpton Jr.,
[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-sharpton1mar01,0,7761346,print.story My link to Strom Thurmond], ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', March 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tax issues===
On May 9, 2008 the [[Associated Press]] reported that Sharpton and his businesses owed almost $1.5&amp;nbsp;million in unpaid taxes and penalties. Sharpton owed $931,000 in federal income tax and $366,000 to New York, and his for-profit company, Rev. Al Communications, owed another $176,000 to the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taxes&quot; /&gt;

On June 19, 2008 the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that the [[Internal Revenue Service]] had sent [[subpoena]]s to several corporations that had donated to Sharpton's [[National Action Network]]. In 2007 New York State Attorney General Andrew Cuomo began investigating the National Action Network, because it failed to make proper financial reports, as required for non-profits.&lt;ref&gt;Chuck Bennett, [http://www.nypost.com/seven/06192008/news/regionalnews/subpoena_blitz_puts_heat_on_al_116165.htm &quot;Subpoena Blitz Puts Heat on Al&quot;], ''[[New York Post]]'', June 19, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Post'', several major corporations, including [[Anheuser-Busch]] and [[Colgate-Palmolive]], have donated thousands of dollars to the National Action Network. The ''Post'' asserted that the donations were made to prevent [[boycott]]s or rallies by the National Action Network.&lt;ref&gt;Isabel Vincent and Susan Edelman, [http://www.nypost.com/seven/06152008/news/regionalnews/rev__al_soaks_up_boycott_bucks_115554.htm &quot;Rev. Al Soaks Up Boycott Bucks: Biz Giants Pay or Face Race Rallies&quot;], ''New York Post'', June 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sharpton countered the investigative actions with a charge that they reflected a political agenda by United States agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Marzulli|title=Sharpton gets big gun to fend off feds|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/06/19/2008-06-19_sharpton_gets_big_gun_to_fend_off_feds.html|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |date=June 20, 2008|accessdate=June 20, 2008 | location = New York | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080623192331/http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/06/19/2008-06-19_sharpton_gets_big_gun_to_fend_off_feds.html| archivedate= June 23, 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, 2010 Robert Snell of ''[[The Detroit News]]'' reported that the Internal Revenue Service had filed a notice of federal [[tax lien]] against Sharpton in New York City in the amount of over $538,000.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Snell, &quot;Sharpton faced with fresh tax woe,&quot; ''[[The Detroit News]]'', September 29, 2010, at [http://apps.detnews.com/apps/blogs/taxingdetroitblog/index.php?blogid=79].&lt;/ref&gt; Sharpton's lawyer asserts that the notice of federal tax lien relates to Sharpton's year 2009 federal income tax return, the due date of which has been extended to October 15, 2010, according to the lawyer. However, the Snell report states that the lien relates to taxes ''assessed during 2009''.&lt;ref&gt;Id.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political campaigns==
Sharpton has run unsuccessfully for elected office on multiple occasions. Of his unsuccessful runs, he said that winning office may not have been his goal. &quot;Much of the media criticism of me assumes their goals and they impose them on me,&quot; said Sharpton in an interview. &quot;Well, those might not be my goals. So they will say, 'Well, Sharpton has not won a political office.' But that might not be my goal! Maybe I ran for political office to change the debate, or to raise the social justice question.&quot;&lt;ref name=DS/&gt; Sharpton ran for a [[United States Senate]] seat from [[New York]] in 1988, 1992, and 1994. In 1997, he ran for Mayor of [[New York City]]. During his 1992 bid, he and his wife lived in a home in [[Englewood, New Jersey]], though he said his residence was an apartment in [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref&gt;Staff. [http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=6eUcAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=9pYEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=al-sharpton%20englewood&amp;pg=6468%2C2435939 &quot;Sharpton to run for U.S. Senate&quot;], ''[[Pittsburgh Press]]'', January 21, 1992. Retrieved February 17, 2011. &quot;Sharpton, who lives with his wife and two daughters in Englewood, N.J., and also shares an apartment in Brooklyn with a friend, said his legal residence was New York.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 15, 2005 Sharpton agreed to repay $100,000 in public funds he received from the federal government for his 2004 Presidential campaign. The repayment was required because Sharpton had exceeded federal limits on personal expenditures for his campaign. At that time his most recent [[Federal Election Commission]] filings (from January 1, 2005) stated that Sharpton's campaign still had debts of $479,050 and owed Sharpton himself $145,146 for an item listed as &quot;Fundraising Letter Preparation — Kinko's.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Sharpton Returns Public Funds | date= December 16, 2007 | publisher= | url =http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/15/AR2005121501824.html | work =[[The Washington Post]] | accessdate = April 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the Federal Election Commission announced it had levied a fine of $285,000 against Sharpton's 2004 presidential campaign for breaking campaign finance rules during his presidential campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fec.gov/press/press2009/20090430MUR_Sharpton.shtml |title=FEC Reaches Settlement with Rev.

Caruso |date=April 30, 2009 |accessdate=April 15, 2012 | work=The Seattle Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 2, 2007 Sharpton announced that he would not enter the 2008 presidential race. &quot;I am not going to run,&quot; he said.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN 2004&quot;&gt;[www.nydailynews.com/news/wn_report/2007/04/02/2007-04-02_rev_al_is_bowing_out.html], Rev. Al is Bowing Out, Retrieved April 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
