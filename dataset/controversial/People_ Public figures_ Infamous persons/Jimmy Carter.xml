'''James Earl &quot;Jimmy&quot; Carter, Jr.''' (born October 1, 1924) is an American politician who served as the [[List of Presidents of the United States|39th]] [[President of the United States]] (1977–1981) and was the recipient of the 2002 [[Nobel Peace Prize]], the only U.S. President to have received the Prize after leaving office. Before he became President, Carter, a Democrat, served as a U.S. Naval officer, was a [[peanut]] farmer, served two terms as a [[Georgia Senate|Georgia State Senator]] and one as [[List of Governors of Georgia|Governor of Georgia]] (1971–1975).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-676 |title=Jimmy Carter |encyclopedia=New Georgia Encyclopedia |publisher=Georgia Humanities Council |accessdate=December 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Carter's term as President, two new cabinet-level departments were created: the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]]. He established a [[Energy policy of the United States|national energy policy]] that included conservation, price control, and new technology. In foreign affairs, Carter pursued the [[Camp David Accords]], the [[Panama Canal Treaties]], the second round of [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] (SALT II), and returned the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to Panama. He took office during a period of international [[stagflation]], which persisted throughout his term. The end of his presidential tenure was marked by the 1979–1981 [[Iran hostage crisis]], the [[1979 energy crisis]], the [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island nuclear accident]], the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], United States boycott of the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow (the only U.S. boycott in Olympic history), and the [[eruption of Mount St. Helens]].

By 1980, Carter's popularity had eroded. He survived a primary challenge against [[Ted Kennedy]] for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nomination in the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 election]], but lost the election to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Ronald Reagan]]. On January 20, 1981, minutes after Carter's term in office ended, the 52 U.S. captives held at the U.S. embassy in Iran were released, ending the 444-day Iran hostage crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/iran-hostage-crisis-ends |title=Iran Hostage Crisis ends – History.com This Day in History – 1/20/1981 |publisher=History.com |date= |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving office, Carter and his wife [[Rosalynn Carter|Rosalynn]] founded the [[Carter Center]] in 1982,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.cartercenter.org/about/history/chronology.html Timeline and History of The Carter Center]&quot;. The Carter Center. Retrieved February 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; a nongovernmental, [[not-for-profit organization]] that works to advance human rights. He has traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, observe elections, and advance disease prevention and [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] in developing nations. Carter is a key figure in the [[Habitat for Humanity]] project,&lt;ref name=Habitat&gt;{{cite web |accessdate= |url=http://www.habitat.org/how/carter.aspx |title=Jimmy Carter and Habitat for Humanity |publisher=Habitat for Humanity Int'l}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also remains particularly vocal on the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].

==Early life==
[[File:Jimmy Carter with his dog Bozo 1937.gif|upright|thumb|Jimmy Carter (around age 13) his dog, Bozo, in 1937.]]James Earl Carter, Jr., was born at the [[Wise Sanitarium]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidentialavenue.com/jec.cfm |title=Whois Lookup |publisher=Presidentialavenue.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; on October 1, 1924, in the tiny southwest [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] city of [[Plains, Georgia|Plains]], near [[Americus, Georgia|Americus]]. The first president born in a hospital,&lt;ref name=USA-Presidents&gt;{{cite web |accessdate= |url=http://www.usa-presidents.info/carter.htm |title=Jimmy Carter |publisher=USA-Presidents.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; he is the eldest of four children of [[James Earl Carter, Sr.|James Earl Carter]] and [[Lillian Gordy Carter|Bessie Lillian Gordy]]. Carter's father was a prominent business owner in the community and his mother was a registered nurse.

Carter has Scotch-Irish and English ancestry (one of his paternal ancestors arrived in the American Colonies in 1635).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,915294,00.html The Nation: Magnus Carter: Jimmy's Roots]&quot;. ''Time''. August 22, 1977.

Carter has documented ancestors who fought in the American Revolution, and he is a member of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]].&lt;ref name=calsarspring07&gt;{{cite news |title=The California Compatriot |publisher=California Society SAR |date=Spring 2007 |page=23 |url= http://www.californiasar.org/images/SpringCompatriot07_R.pdf |accessdate= September 4, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter's great-grandfather, Private L.B. Walker Carter (1832–1874), served in the [[Confederate States Army]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=hTFYp2-cnMkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Jimmy+Carter,+American+Moralist,+by+Kenneth+Earl+Morris&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=junCqi5YXO&amp;sig=AYFDaW3kdt9m2w_yS5EeYqNMoV8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=FwJkTdmKFIGs8AaarqyDDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBcQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Jimmy Carter, American Moralist], by Kenneth Earl Morris, 1996, page 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter was a gifted student from an early age who always had a fondness for reading. By the time he attended Plains High School, he was also a star in basketball. He was greatly influenced by one of his high school teachers, Julia Coleman (1889–1973). While he was in high school he was in the [[Future Farmers of America]], which later changed its name to the [[National FFA Organization]], serving as the Plains FFA Chapter Secretary.&lt;ref name=FFA&gt;{{cite web |accessdate= |url=http://www.ffa.org/documents/about_prominentmembers.pdf |title=National FFA Organization: Prominent Former Members |publisher=National FFA Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter had three younger siblings: sisters [[Gloria Carter Spann]] (1926–1990) and [[Ruth Carter Stapleton]] (1929–1983), and brother [[Billy Carter|William Alton &quot;Billy&quot; Carter]] (1937–1988). During Carter's Presidency, Billy was often in the news, usually in an unflattering light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= Robert D. Hershey Jr|title= Billy Carter Dies of Cancer at 51; Troubled Brother of a President| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/26/obituaries/billy-carter-dies-of-cancer-at-51-troubled-brother-of-a-president.html|work= [[The New York Times]] |date= September 26, 1988|accessdate=2011-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He married [[Rosalynn Carter|Rosalynn Smith]] in 1946; they have four children.

He is a first cousin of politician [[Hugh Carter]] and a [[Law-cousin|half-second cousin]] of Motown founder [[Berry Gordy|Berry Gordy Jr.]] on his mother's side, and a cousin of [[June Carter Cash]].&lt;ref&gt;Cash, John R. with Patrick Carr. (1997) Johnny Cash, the Autobiography. [[Harper Collins]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naval career===
After high school, Carter enrolled at [[Georgia Southwestern College]], in Americus. Later, he applied to the [[United States Naval Academy]] and, after taking additional mathematics courses at [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]], he was admitted in 1943. Carter graduated 59th out of 820 midshipmen at the Naval Academy with a Bachelor of Science degree with an unspecified major, as was the custom at the academy at that time.&lt;ref name=DeGregorio2005&gt;{{cite book
|last=DeGregorio |first=William A. |title=The Complete Book of US Presidents. |volume=Volume 1
|location=Fort Lee |publisher=Barricade Books |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter served on surface ships and on diesel-electric submarines in the [[US Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic]] and [[US Pacific Fleet|Pacific fleets]]. As a junior officer, he completed qualification for command of a diesel-electric submarine. He applied for the [[United States Navy|US Navy's]] fledgling [[nuclear submarine]] program run by then Captain [[Hyman G. Rickover]]. Rickover's demands on his men and machines were legendary, and Carter later said that, next to his parents, Rickover had the greatest influence on him. Carter has said that he loved the Navy, and had planned to make it his career. His ultimate goal was to become [[Chief of Naval Operations]]. Carter felt the best route for promotion was with submarine duty since he felt that nuclear power would be increasingly used in submarines.  Carter was based in [[Schenectady, New York]], and working on developing training materials for the nuclear propulsion system for the prototype of a new submarine.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Post, ''Soldiers of Saratoga County: From Concord to Kabul'' (2010)  p 105&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, 1952, an accident with the experimental NRX reactor at [[Atomic Energy of Canada|Atomic Energy of Canada's]] [[Chalk River Laboratories]] caused a partial meltdown. The resulting explosion caused millions of liters of radioactive water to flood the reactor building's basement, and the reactor's core was no longer usable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=nN9FAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=chalk+river+nuclear+accident+1952&amp;dq=chalk+river+nuclear+accident+1952&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=hIhzTeGSFYP88Ab63-CUDw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAQ Great Events from History II: 1945–1966], Frank Northen Magill, 1995, page 554&lt;/ref&gt; Carter was now ordered to Chalk River, joining other American and Canadian service personnel. He was the officer in charge of the U.S. team assisting in the shutdown of the Chalk River Nuclear Reactor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=6YElaxt6fv4C&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=jimmy+carter+chalk+river&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=34dzTezyLcO2tgfgtuTuDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=jimmy%20carter%20chalk%20river&amp;f=false Memoirs of a Hayseed Physicist], by Peter Martel, 2008, page 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Once they arrived, Carter's team used a model of the reactor to practice the steps necessary to disassemble the reactor and seal it off. During execution of the actual disassembly each team member, including Carter, donned protective gear, was lowered individually into the reactor, stayed for only a few seconds at a time to minimize exposure to radiation, and used hand tools to loosen bolts, remove nuts and take the other steps necessary to complete the disassembly process.

During and after his presidency Carter indicated that his experience at Chalk River shaped his views on nuclear power and nuclear weapons, including his decision not to pursue completion of the [[neutron bomb]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ottawariverkeeper.ca/news/when_jimmy_carter_faced_radioactivity_head_on/ Newspaper article, When Jimmy Carter faced radioactivity head-on], by Arthur Milnes, The Ottawa Citizen, Wednesday, January 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the death of his father James Earl Carter, Sr., in July 1953, he was urgently needed to run the family business. Lieutenant Carter resigned his commission, and he was discharged from the Navy on October 9, 1953.

===Farming and personal belief===
Though Carter's father, Earl, died a relatively wealthy man, between Earl's forgiveness of debts owed to him and the division of his wealth among his heirs, Jimmy Carter inherited comparatively little.  For a year, due to a limited real estate market, the Carters lived in [[public housing]] (Carter is the only U.S. president to have lived in housing subsidized for the poor).&lt;ref name=moralist&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=3M1KlBNm7WcC&amp;pg=PA115&amp;dq=%22jimmy+carter%22+public+housing&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oa0yT7_4HpCd0gG7l6jCBw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22jimmy%20carter%22%20public%20housing&amp;f=false Jimmy Carter, American Moralist] By Kenneth E. Morris, page 115&lt;/ref&gt;  

Knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects and raised on a farm, Carter took over the family peanut farm.  Carter took to the county library to read up on agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the businesses financials.&lt;ref name=moralist/&gt; Though they barely broke even the first year, Carter managed to expand in Plains. His farming business was successful, and during the 1970 gubernatorial campaign, he was considered a wealthy peanut farmer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,904462-1,00.html New Crop of Governors – TIME&lt;!-- Bot-generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

From a young age, Carter showed a deep commitment to Christianity, serving as a Sunday School teacher throughout his life. Even as President, Carter prayed several times a day, and professed that Jesus Christ was the driving force in his life. Carter had been greatly influenced by a sermon he had heard as a young man, called, &quot;If you were arrested for being a Christian, would there be enough evidence to convict you?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Conversations with Carter| isbn=1-55587-801-6|year=1998|page=14| first1=Jimmy |last1= Carter| first2= Don |last2= Richardson|publisher=Lynne Rienner Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early political career==

===Georgia State Senate===
Jimmy Carter started his political career by serving on various local boards, governing such entities as the schools, hospitals, and libraries, among others. In the 1960s, he served two terms in the [[Georgia Senate]] from the fourteenth district of Georgia.

His 1961 election to the state Senate, which followed the end of Georgia's [[County Unit System]] (per the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Gray v. Sanders]]''), was chronicled in his book ''Turning Point: A Candidate, a State, and a Nation Come of Age''. The election involved corruption led by Joe Hurst, the sheriff of [[Quitman County, Georgia|Quitman County]]; system abuses included votes from deceased persons and tallies filled with people who supposedly voted in alphabetical order. It took a challenge of the fraudulent results for Carter to win the election. Carter was reelected in 1964, to serve a second two-year term.

For a time in State Senate he chaired its Education Committee.&lt;ref name=&quot;georgiaencyclopedia.org&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?path=/GovernmentPolitics/Politics/PoliticalFigures&amp;id=h-676 Jimmy Carter (b. 1924)]&quot;. ''New Georgia Encyclopedia''. Updated May 9, 2008. Retrieved February 16, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, Carter declined running for re-election as a state senator to pursue a gubernatorial run. His first cousin, [[Hugh Carter]], was elected as a Democrat and took over his seat in the Senate.

===Campaigns for Governor===
{{Main|Georgia gubernatorial election, 1966}}
In 1966, during the end of his career as a state senator, he flirted with the idea of running for the [[United States House of Representatives]]. His Republican opponent, [[Howard Callaway]], dropped out and decided to run for Governor of Georgia. Carter did not want to see a Republican Governor of his state, and, in turn, dropped out of the race for Congress and joined the race to become Governor. Carter lost the Democratic primary, but drew enough votes as a third-place candidate to force the favorite, liberal former governor [[Ellis Arnall]], into a [[two-round system|runoff election]], setting off a chain of events which resulted in the nomination of segregationist Democrat [[Lester Maddox]]. Maddox would go on to be selected governor of Georgia by the Georgia General Assembly despite finishing a close second in a three-way general election race between Maddox, Callaway, and Arnall, who ran as a [[Write-in candidate]]. During the primary Carter ran as a moderate alternative to both liberal Arnall and conservative Maddox.&lt;ref name=&quot;georgiaencyclopedia.org&quot;/&gt; Although he lost, his strong third place finish was viewed as a success for a little-known state senator.&lt;ref name=&quot;georgiaencyclopedia.org&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|Georgia gubernatorial election, 1970}}

For the next four years, Carter returned to his agriculture business and carefully planned for his next campaign for Governor in 1970, making over 1,800 speeches throughout the state.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

During his 1970 campaign, he ran an uphill populist campaign in the Democratic primary against former Governor [[Carl Sanders]], labeling his opponent &quot;Cufflinks Carl&quot;. Carter was never a [[racial segregation|segregationist]], and refused to join the segregationist [[White Citizens' Council]], prompting a boycott of his peanut warehouse. His family was also one of only two that voted to admit blacks to the Plains Baptist Church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/biography/carter-bio/ People &amp; Events: James Earl (&quot;Jimmy&quot;) Carter Jr. (1924–)] – [[American Experience]], [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. Retrieved March 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Carter himself was not a segregationist in 1970. But he did say things that the segregationists wanted to hear. He was opposed to busing. He was in favor of private schools. He said that he would invite segregationist governor George Wallace to come to Georgia to give a speech.&quot;, according to historian [[E. Stanly Godbold]].{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

Carter's campaign aides handed out a photograph of Sanders celebrating with black basketball players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.claremont.org/publications/crb/id.977/article_detail.asp The Claremont Institute – Malaise Forever&lt;!-- Bot-generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/5kwrtgWxP &quot;Jimmy Carter&quot;], Microsoft [[Encarta]] Online Encyclopedia 2005, accessed March 18, 2006. Archived October 31, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Following his close victory over Sanders in the primary, he was elected Governor over Republican [[Hal Suit]].

After his election, Carter would make a statement that would displease the segregationists:  &quot;I've traveled the state more than any other person in history and I say to you quite frankly that the time for racial discrimination is over. Never again should a black child be deprived of an equal right to health care, education, or the other privileges of society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Till | first1 = Brian Michael | title = Conversations with Power: What Great Presidents and Prime Ministers Can Teach Us about Leadership | publisher = Macmillan | year = 2011 | page = 180 | accessdate = 2012-08-09 | isbn = 978-0230110588}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leroy Johnson, Georgia State Senator reflected: &quot;We were extremely pleased. Many of the white segregationists were displeased. And I'm convinced that those people that supported him, would not have supported him if they had thought that he would have made that statement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/transcript/carter-transcript/ American Experience | Jimmy Carter | Transcript&lt;!-- Bot-generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governor of Georgia==
Carter was sworn in as the 76th Governor of Georgia on January 12, 1971, and held this post for one term, until January 14, 1975. Governors of Georgia were not allowed to succeed themselves at the time. His predecessor as Governor, [[Lester Maddox]], became the [[Lieutenant Governor of Georgia|Lieutenant Governor]].

===Civil rights politics===
Carter declared in his inaugural speech that the time of racial segregation was over, and that racial discrimination had no place in the future of the state, the first statewide office holder in the [[Deep South]] to say this in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackjournalism.com/?p=183 |title=President Jimmy Carter, still far ahead of his time at Black Journalism Review |publisher=Blackjournalism.com |date= |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Carter appointed many African Americans to statewide boards and offices. He was often called one of the &quot;New Southern Governors&quot;{{spaced ndash}}much more moderate than their predecessors, and supportive of racial desegregation and expanding African-Americans' rights.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Abortion===
Although &quot;personally opposed&quot; to abortion, after the landmark [[US Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', 410 US 113 (1973) Carter supported legalized abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

He explained how difficult it was for him, given his strong Christian beliefs, to uphold Roe v. Wade while he was president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://atlanta.cbslocal.com/2012/03/30/carter-jesus-would-not-approve-of-abortions/ Carter: Jesus Would Not Approve Of Abortions]. CBS Atlanta, March 30, 2012.

===State government reforms===
Carter improved government efficiency by merging about 300 state agencies into 30 agencies. One of his aides recalled that Governor Carter &quot;was right there with us, working just as hard, digging just as deep into every little problem. It was his program and he worked on it as hard as anybody, and the final product was distinctly his.&quot; He also pushed reforms through the legislature, providing equal state aid to schools in the wealthy and poor areas of Georgia, set up community centers for mentally handicapped children, and increased educational programs for convicts. Carter took pride in a program he introduced for the appointment of judges and state government officials. Under this program, all such appointments were based on merit, rather than political influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.worldbook.com/content-spotlight/item/1156-lives-and-times-of-american-presidents-1961-present/1156-lives-and-times-of-american-presidents-1961-present?start=5|title=Carter, Jimmy|publisher=World Book Student|author=Hugh S.

===Vice-Presidential aspirations in 1972===
In 1972, as US Senator [[George McGovern]] of South Dakota was marching toward the Democratic nomination for President, Carter called a news conference in Atlanta to warn that McGovern was unelectable. Carter criticized McGovern as too liberal on both foreign and domestic policy, yet when McGovern's nomination became a foregone conclusion, Carter lobbied to become his vice-presidential running mate.

During the [[1972 Democratic National Convention]] he endorsed the candidacy of Senator [[Henry M. Jackson]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=58482 Our Campaigns – US President – D Convention Race – July 10, 1972&lt;!-- Bot-generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; Carter received 30 votes at the [[1972 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] in the chaotic ballot for Vice President.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} McGovern offered the second spot to [[Reubin Askew]], from next door Florida and one of the &quot;new southern governors&quot;, but he declined.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Death penalty and crime===
After the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Georgia's death penalty law in 1972, Carter quickly proposed state legislation to replace the death penalty with life in prison without parole (an option that previously did not exist).&lt;ref&gt;Craig Brandon, ''The Electric Chair: An Unnatural American History'', 1999, p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Georgia legislature passed a new [[death penalty|death penalty statute]], Carter, despite voicing reservations about its constitutionality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nodeathpenalty.org/new_abolitionist/september-2008-issue-46/can-we-expect-change-democrats|title=Campaign to End the Death Penalty |publisher=Nodeathpenalty.org |date= |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; signed new legislation on March 28, 1973&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/state_by_state &quot;State by State Database&quot;]. Death Penalty Information Center. Retrieved February 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; to authorize the death penalty for murder, rape and other offenses, and to implement trial procedures that conformed to the newly announced constitutional requirements. In 1976, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld Georgia's new death penalty for murder. In the case of ''[[Coker v. Georgia]]'', the Supreme Court ruled that the death penalty was unconstitutional as applied to rape.

Many in America were outraged by [[William Calley]]'s life sentence at [[Fort Benning]] for his role in the [[My Lai Massacre]]; Carter instituted &quot;American Fighting Man's Day&quot; and asked Georgians to drive for a week with their lights on in support of Calley.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 84&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|coauthors= |year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= |pages=84–85 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Indiana's governor asked all state flags to be flown at half-staff for Calley, and Utah's and Mississippi's governors also disagreed with the verdict.&lt;ref name=&quot;'70s 84&quot;/&gt;

Despite his earlier support, Carter soon became a death penalty opponent, and during Presidential campaigns (like previous nominee George McGovern and two successive nominees, [[Walter Mondale]] and [[Michael Dukakis]]), this was noted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2003/12/07/democrats_shift_on_death_penalty/ &quot;Democrats shift on death penalty&quot;]. ''[[The Boston Globe]]''. December 7, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Carter is known for his outspoken opposition to the death penalty in all forms; in his [[Nobel Prize]] lecture, he urged &quot;prohibition of the death penalty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/12/10/carter.transcript/ &quot;Carter Nobel Peace Prize speech&quot;]. CNN. December 10, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States Senate appointment===
&lt;!-- article is about Carter ''not'' Russell. Remember that senatorial appointment was an important act of Carter as Governor --&gt;
[[Richard Russell, Jr.]], then-[[President pro tempore of the United States Senate]], died in office on January 21, 1971. Carter, only nine days into his governorship, appointed state Democratic Party chair [[David H. Gambrell]] to fill an unexpired Russell term in the Senate on February 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=G000034 GAMBRELL, David Henry – Biographical Information&lt;!-- Bot-generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; Gambrell was defeated in the next Democratic [[primary election|primary]] by the more conservative [[Sam Nunn]].

===Other activities===
In 1973, while Governor of Georgia, Carter filed a report on his [[Jimmy Carter UFO incident|1969 UFO sighting]] with the International UFO Bureau in [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma|Oklahoma City]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin|first=Robert Scott|title=Celebrities Have Close Encounters, Too|publisher=Space.com|date=October 15, 1999|url=http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/phenomena/celebrity_ufo_991015.html|doi= |accessdate=April 16, 2004|archiveurl=http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090524230119/http://www.space.com/sciencefiction/phenomena/celebrity_ufo_991015.html|archivedate=May 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Horvath|first=Alex|title=Bolinas man's film says we are not alone|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|date=February 7, 2003|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2003/02/07/NB128511.DTL&amp;type=printable|accessdate=April 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Stenger|first=Richard|title=Clinton aide slams Pentagon's UFO secrecy|publisher=CNN|date=October 22, 2002|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/TECH/space/10/22/ufo.records/index.html |accessdate=April 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Carter stated that he did not remember why he filed the report and that he believes he probably only did it at the request of one of his children. He also stated he does not believe it was an alien spacecraft, but rather that it was likely some sort of military experiment being conducted from a nearby military base.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Skeptics' Guide to the Universe]], [http://www.theskepticsguide.org/archive/podcastinfo.aspx?mid=1&amp;pid=105 July 25, 2007 episode].&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter made an appearance as the first guest of the evening on an episode of the game show ''[[What's My Line]]'' in 1974, signing in as &quot;X&quot;, lest his name give away his occupation. After his job was identified on question seven of ten by [[Gene Shalit]], he talked about having brought movie production to the state of Georgia, citing ''[[Deliverance]]'', and the then-unreleased ''[[The Longest Yard (1974 film)|The Longest Yard]]''.

In 1974, Carter was chairman of the [[Democratic National Committee]]'s congressional, as well as gubernatorial, campaigns.

==1976 presidential campaign==
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1976}}
[[File:ElectoralCollege1976.svg|thumb|300px|right|The electoral map of the 1976 election]]
When Carter entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries in 1976, he was considered to have little chance against nationally better-known politicians. He had a [[name recognition]] of only two percent. When he told his family of his intention to run for President, his mother asked, &quot;President of what?&quot;{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} The [[Watergate scandal]] was still fresh in the voters' minds, and so his position as an outsider, distant from Washington, D.C., became an asset. The centerpiece of his campaign platform was government reorganization. Carter published ''Why Not the Best?'' in June 1976 to help introduce himself to the American public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30B1FFC3E5B167493C4A8178CD85F428785F9 | work=The New York Times | first=Charles | last=Mohr | title=Choice of Mondale Helps To Reconcile the Liberals; Choice of Mondale as Running Mate Helps Carter to Reconcile Liberal Critics Candidate Tells of Painstaking Search In Effort to Avoid Mistake Like 1972's | date=July 16, 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carter and Ford in a debate, September 23, 1976.jpg|right|thumb|Carter and President [[Gerald Ford]] debating at the [[Walnut Street Theater]] in [[Philadelphia]].]]
Carter became the front-runner early on by winning the [[Iowa caucus]]es and the [[New Hampshire primary]]. He used a two-prong strategy: In the South, which most had tacitly conceded to Alabama's George Wallace, Carter ran as a moderate favorite son. When Wallace proved to be a spent force, Carter swept the region. In the North, Carter appealed largely to conservative Christian and rural voters and had little chance of winning a majority in most states. He won several Northern states by building the largest single bloc. Carter's strategy involved reaching a region before another candidate could extend influence there. He traveled over 50,000 miles, visited 37 states, and delivered over 200 speeches before any other candidates even announced that they were in the race.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/carter/player/#v276 PBS Amex Jimmy Who?].&lt;/ref&gt; Initially dismissed as a regional candidate, Carter proved to be the only Democrat with a truly national strategy, and he eventually clinched the nomination.

The national news media discovered and promoted Carter, as Lawrence Shoup noted in his 1980 book ''The Carter Presidency and Beyond'':

{{quote|''What Carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media. It was their favorable coverage of Carter and his campaign that gave him an edge, propelling him rocket-like to the top of the opinion polls. This helped Carter win key primary election victories, enabling him to rise from an obscure public figure to President-elect in the short space of 9 months.''}}

Carter was interviewed by [[Robert Scheer]] of ''[[Playboy]]'' for its November 1976 issue, which hit the newsstands a couple of weeks before the election. It was here that in the course of a digression on his religion's view of pride, Carter admitted: &quot;I've looked on a lot of women with lust. I've committed adultery in my heart many times.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Playboy Interview: Jimmy Carter.&quot; Robert Scheer. ''Playboy'', November 1976, Vol. 23, Iss. 11, pp. 63–86.&lt;/ref&gt; He remains the only American president to be interviewed by this magazine.

As late as January 26, 1976, Carter was the first choice of only four percent of Democratic voters, according to a [[Gallup poll]]. Yet &quot;by mid-March 1976 Carter was not only far ahead of the active contenders for the Democratic presidential nomination, he also led President [[Gerald Ford|Ford]] by a few percentage points&quot;, according to Shoup.

He chose Senator [[Walter Mondale|Walter F. Mondale]] as his running mate. He attacked Washington in his speeches, and offered a religious salve for the nation's wounds.&lt;ref name = &quot;Dyer-2004&quot;&gt;American Presidency, Brinkley and Dyer, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter began the race with a sizable lead over Ford, who was able to narrow the gap over the course of the campaign, but was unable to prevent Carter from narrowly defeating him on November 2, 1976. Carter won the popular vote by 50.1 percent to 48.0 percent for Ford and received 297 [[electoral college|electoral votes]] to Ford's 240. The electoral vote was so close that if Ford had carried Texas and Arkansas (instead of Carter), Ford would have won the election.  Carter became the first contender from the [[Deep South]] to be elected President since the [[US presidential election, 1848|1848 election]]. Carter carried fewer states than Ford—23 states to the defeated Ford's 27—yet Carter won with the largest percentage of the popular vote (50.1&amp;nbsp;percent) of any non-incumbent since [[Dwight Eisenhower]], and only half a percent less than what Ronald Reagan would defeat him with in 1980.

==Presidency==
{{Main|Presidency of Jimmy Carter}}
[[File:Inauguration of Jimmy Carter.jpg|thumb|right|Jimmy Carter is sworn in as the 39th President of the United States by [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[Warren E. Burger|Warren Burger]], January 20, 1977.]]Carter was elected over Gerald Ford in 1976. His tenure was a time of continuing inflation and recession, as well as an energy crisis. On January 7, 1980, Carter signed [http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=32978 Law H.R. 5860 aka Public Law 96-185] known as ''The Chrysler Corporation Loan Guarantee Act of 1979'' bailing out [[Chrysler Corporation]] and canceled military pay raises during a time of high inflation and government deficits.

While attempting to calm various conflicts around the World, most visibly in the Middle East resulting in the signing of the Camp David Accords, giving back the Panama Canal and signing the SALT II nuclear arms reduction treaty with Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]], the final year of his administration was marred by the [[Iran hostage crisis]], which contributed to his losing his 1980 re-election campaign to Ronald Reagan.

===U.S. Energy Crisis===
On  April 18, 1977 Carter delivered a televised speech declaring that the U.S. energy crisis during the 1970s was the [[President Jimmy Carter's Moral Equivalent of War Speech|moral equivalent of war]].  Carter encouraged energy conservation by all U.S. citizens  and installed [[White House solar panels|solar water heating panels on the White House]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unity.edu/news/solar1004.htm|title= Maine college to auction off former White House solar panels|date=October 28, 2004|accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/01/27/white-house-solar-panels_n_160575.html|work=The Huffington Post|title=White House Solar Panels: What Ever Happened To Carter's Solar Thermal Water Heater?

===EPA Love Canal Superfund===
In 1978, Carter declared a federal emergency in the neighborhood of [[Love Canal]] in the city of [[Niagara Falls, New York]]. More than 800 families were evacuated from the neighborhood, which was built on top of a [[toxic waste]] landfill. The [[Superfund]] law was created in response to the situation. Federal disaster money was appropriated to demolish the approximately 500 houses, the 99th Street School, and the 93rd Street School, which were built on top of the dump and to remediate the dump and construct a containment area. This was the first time that such a thing had been done. He then said that there were several more &quot;Love Canals&quot; across the country, and that discovering such dumpsites was &quot;one of the grimmest discoveries of our modern era&quot;.

===Deregulation===

====American beer industry====
[[Image:AirlineDeregulationAct.gif|thumb|right|U.S. President Jimmy Carter signs the &lt;br /&gt;[[Airline Deregulation Act]].]]
During 1979, Carter deregulated the American beer industry by opening access of the home-brew market back up to the [[Microbrewery|craft brewers]], making it again legal to sell [[malt]], [[hops]], and [[yeast]] to American [[Homebrewing|home brewers]] for the first time since the effective 1920 beginning of [[Prohibition in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherjones.com/tom-philpott/2011/08/beer-charts |title=Beer Charts of the Day|first=Tom|last=Philpott|publisher=Motherjones.com |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====U.S. Airline Industry====
In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed [[Alfred E. Kahn]], a professor of [[economics]] at [[Cornell University]], to be chair of the CAB. A concerted push for the legislation had developed, drawing on leading economists, leading 'think tanks' in Washington, a civil society coalition advocating the reform (patterned on a coalition earlier developed for the truck-and-rail-reform efforts), the head of the regulatory agency, Senate leadership, the Carter administration, and even some in the airline industry. This coalition swiftly gained legislative results in 1978.

The [[Airline Deregulation Act]] ({{USPL|95|504}}) is [[United States federal law|United States enacted federal legislation]] signed into law by President Carter on October 24, 1978. The main purpose of the act was to [[Airline deregulation|remove government control]] over fares, routes and market entry (of new airlines) from [[commercial aviation]].  The [[Civil Aeronautics Board|Civil Aeronautics Board's]] powers of regulation were to be phased out, eventually allowing passengers to be exposed to market forces in the [[airline]] industry.  The Act, however, did not remove or diminish the FAA's regulatory powers over all aspects of airline safety.

===U.S. Boycott of the Moscow Olympics===
One of Carter's most bitterly controversial decisions was his boycott of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow in response to the 1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. This marks the only time since the founding of the modern Olympics in 1896 that the United States has ever failed to participate in a Summer or Winter Olympics. The Soviet Union retaliated by boycotting the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles and did not withdraw troops from Afghanistan until 1989 (eight years after Carter left office).

==1980 presidential campaign==
{{Main|United States presidential election, 1980}}
[[File:ElectoralCollege1980.svg|thumb|300px|right|The electoral map of the 1980 election]]
Carter wrote that the most intense and mounting opposition to his policies came from the liberal wing of the Democratic Party, which he attributed to [[Ted Kennedy]]'s ambition to replace him as president.&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Jimmy ''Our Endangered Values: America's Moral Crisis'', p. 8, (2005), Simon &amp; Schuster&lt;/ref&gt; Kennedy, originally on board with Carter's health plan, pulled his support from that legislation in the late stages; Carter states that this was in anticipation of Kennedy's own candidacy, and when neither won, the tactic effectively delayed comprehensive health coverage for decades.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/09/16/60minutes/main6872344.shtml. Retrieved 09/16/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[United States presidential election, 1980|Carter's campaign for re-election in 1980]] was one of the most difficult, and least successful, in history. He faced strong challenges from the right ([[Ronald Reagan]]), the center ([[John B. Anderson]]), and the left ([[Ted Kennedy]]). He had to run against his own &quot;[[stagflation]]&quot;-ridden economy. He alienated liberal college students, who were expected to be his base, by re-instating registration for the draft. He was defeated by Ronald Reagan in a landslide.

==Post-Presidency==
[[File:Former President and First Lady Carter wave from their aircraft.jpeg|thumb|right|Former President and First Lady Carter wave from their aircraft after the [[First inauguration of Ronald Reagan|inauguration of Ronald Reagan]] on January 20, 1981.]]

In 1981, Carter returned to Georgia to his peanut farm, which he had placed into a [[blind trust]] during his presidency to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest. He found that the trustees had mismanaged the trust, leaving him over one million dollars in debt. In the years that followed, he has led an active life, establishing The Carter Center, building his presidential library, teaching at Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, and writing numerous books.&lt;ref name = &quot;Dyer-2004&quot;/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Carter has also received mixed reviews in both television and film documentaries, such as the ''[[Man from Plains]]'' (2007), the 2009 documentary, ''[[Back Door Channels: The Price of Peace]]'', credits Carter's efforts at Camp David, which brought peace between Israel and Egypt, with bringing the only meaningful peace to the Middle East.

Jimmy Carter and [[Walter Mondale]] are the longest-living post-presidential team in American history. On December 11, 2006, they had been out of office for 25 years and 325 days, surpassing the former record established by President [[John Adams]] and Vice President [[Thomas Jefferson]], who both died on July 4, 1826.  On September 7, 2012, Carter surpassed [[Herbert Hoover]] as the President with the longest retirement from the office.

Jimmy Carter is one of only four presidents, and the only one in modern history, who did not have an opportunity to nominate a justice to serve on the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]. The other three are [[William Henry Harrison]], [[Zachary Taylor]], and [[Andrew Johnson]]. Of these four, Carter is the only to have served a full term.

Despite being honest and truthful, Carter's administration suffered from his inexperience in politics. Carter paid too much attention to detail. He frequently backed down from confrontation and was always quick to retreat when under fire from political rivals. He frequently appeared to be indecisive and ineffective, and did not define his priorities clearly.  He seemed to be distrustful and uninterested in working with other groups, or even with Congress when controlled by his own party, which he denounced for being controlled by special interest groups.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt;  Though he made efforts to address many of these issues in 1978, the approval he won from his reforms did not last long.

When Carter ran for reelection, [[Ronald Reagan]]'s nonchalant self-confidence contrasted to Carter's serious and introspective temperament.  Carter's personal attention to detail, his pessimistic attitude, his seeming indecisiveness and weakness with people was also accentuated by Reagan's charismic charm and easy delegation of tasks to subordinates.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/18/us/washington-talk-carter-begins-to-shed-negative-public-image.html?pagewanted=all|title=Washington Talk; Carter Begins to Shed Negative Public Image|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2009-01-28|first=E. J.|last=Dionne Jr|date=May 18, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the combination of the economic problems, the [[Iran hostage crisis]], and lack of Washington cooperation made it very easy for Reagan to portray Carter as a weak and ineffectual leader, which resulted in Carter to become the first elected president since 1932 to lose a reelection bid, and his presidency was largely considered to be a failure.

Notwithstanding perceptions while Carter was in office, his reputation has much improved.  Carter's presidential approval rating, which sat at 31&amp;nbsp;percent just prior to the 1980 election, was polled in early 2009 at 64&amp;nbsp;percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/01/07/time-kind-to-former-presidents-cnn-poll-finds | publisher=CNN | title=Time kind to former presidents, CNN poll finds | date=January 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Carter's continued post-Presidency activities have also been favorably received.  Carter explains that a great deal of this change was owed to Reagan's successor, [[George H. W. Bush]], who actively sought him out and was far more courteous and interested in his advice than Reagan had been.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

===Carter Center===

As President, Carter expressed a goal of making government &quot;competent and compassionate.&quot; In pursuit of that vision, he has been involved in a variety of national and international public policy, conflict resolution, human rights and charitable causes.

In 1982, he established [[The Carter Center]] in Atlanta to advance human rights and alleviate unnecessary human suffering. The non-profit, nongovernmental Center promotes democracy, mediates and prevents conflicts, and monitors the electoral process in support of free and fair elections. It also works to improve global health through the control and [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] of diseases such as [[Guinea worm disease]], [[Onchocerciasis|river blindness]], [[malaria]], [[trachoma]], [[lymphatic filariasis]], and [[schistosomiasis]]. It also works to diminish the stigma of mental illnesses and improve nutrition through increased crop production in Africa. A major accomplishment of The Carter Center has been the elimination of more than 99&amp;nbsp;percent of cases of [[Guinea worm disease]], a debilitating parasite that has existed since ancient times, from an estimated 3.5&amp;nbsp;million cases in 1986 to 3,190 reported cases in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartercenter.org/health/guinea_worm/index.html Carter Center Guinea Worm Eradication Program].

Retrieved September 19, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It has worked to resolve conflicts in [[Haiti]], [[Bosnia]], [[Ethiopia]], [[North Korea]], [[Sudan]] and other countries. Carter and the [[The Carter Center|Center]] actively support human rights defenders around the world and have intervened with heads of state on their behalf.

===Nobel Peace Prize {{anchor|Nobel Peace Prize}}===
In 2002, President Carter received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work &quot;to find peaceful solutions to international conflicts, to advance democracy and human rights, and to promote economic and social development&quot; through The Carter Center.&lt;ref&gt;[[Norwegian Nobel Committee]], 2002 Nobel Peace Prize announcement,[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/2002/press.html], October 11, 2002. Retrieved August 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Three sitting presidents, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Woodrow Wilson]] and [[Barack Obama]], have received the prize; Carter is unique in receiving the award for his actions after leaving the presidency. He is, along with [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], one of only two native Georgians to receive the Nobel.

===Diplomacy===
[[File:US President Jimmy Carter Presidential Trips.PNG|thumb|right|300px|Foreign trips of Jimmy Carter during his presidency]]

====North Korea====
In 1994, [[North Korea]] had expelled investigators from the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] and was threatening to begin processing spent nuclear fuel. In response, then-President Clinton pressured for US sanctions and ordered large amounts of troops and vehicles into the area to brace for war.

Bill Clinton secretly recruited Carter to undertake a peace mission to North Korea,&lt;ref&gt;Marion V. Creekmore, ''A Moment of Crisis: Jimmy Carter, The Power of a Peacemaker, and North Korea's Nuclear Ambitions'' (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; under the guise that it was a private mission of Carter's. Clinton saw Carter as a way to let North Korean President [[Kim Il-sung]] back down without losing face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Washington Monthly Online |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0405.kaplan.html |title=&quot;Rolling Blunder&quot; by Fred Kaplan |publisher=Washingtonmonthly.com |date= |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter negotiated an understanding with Kim Il-sung, but went further and outlined a treaty, which he announced on CNN without the permission of the Clinton White House as a way to force the US into action. The Clinton Administration signed a later version of the [[Agreed Framework]], under which North Korea agreed to freeze and ultimately dismantle its current nuclear program and comply with its [[nonproliferation]] obligations in exchange for oil deliveries, the construction of two [[light water reactors]] to replace its [[graphite moderated reactors|graphite reactors]], and discussions for eventual diplomatic relations.

The agreement was widely hailed at the time as a significant diplomatic achievement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Bush Administration]] and the North Korean government of [[Kim Jong-il]]. In 2001, Bush had taken a confrontational position toward North Korea and, in January 2002, named it as part of an &quot;[[Axis of Evil]]&quot;. Meanwhile, North Korea began developing the capability to [[enriched uranium|enrich uranium]]. Bush Administration opponents of the [[Agreed Framework]] believed that the North Korean government never intended to give up a nuclear weapons program, but supporters believed that the agreement could have been successful and was undermined.&lt;ref name = &quot;commentary10824&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

In August 2010, Carter traveled to North Korea in an attempt to secure the release of [[Aijalon Mahli Gomes]]. Gomes, a [[Citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizen]], was sentenced to eight years of hard labor after being found guilty of illegally entering North Korea. Carter successfully secured the release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Justin McCurry |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/27/north-korea-us-prisoner-jimmy-carter |title=North Korea releases US prisoner after talks with Jimmy Carter |work=[[The Guardian]] |date= August 27, 2010|accessdate=September 6, 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Middle East====
Carter and experts from The Carter Center assisted unofficial Israeli and Palestinian negotiators in designing a model agreement for peace–-called the [[Geneva Accord]]–-in 2002–2003.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News Online]], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/3252530.stm &quot;Moderates launch Middle East plan&quot;], December 1, 2003. Retrieved August 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter has also in recent years become a frequent critic of Israel's policies in [[Lebanon]], [[West Bank]], and [[Gaza]].&lt;ref&gt;Douglas G. Brinkley. ''The Unfinished Presidency: Jimmy Carter's Journey to the Nobel Peace Prize'' (1999), pp. 99–123.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth W. Stein]], &quot;[http://www.meforum.org/1633/my-problem-with-jimmy-carters-book My Problem with Jimmy Carter's Book]&quot;, ''[[Middle East Quarterly]]'' 14.2 (Spring 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, at the UK [[Hay Festival]], Carter stated that [[Israel]] has at least 150 [[nuclear weapons]]. He expressed his support for Israel as a country, but criticized its domestic and foreign policy;
&quot;One of the greatest human rights crimes on earth is the starvation and imprisonment of 1.6m Palestinians,&quot; said Carter.

He mentioned statistics showing nutritional intake of some Palestinian children was below that of the children of Sub-Saharan Africa and described the European position on Israel as &quot;[[Wikt:supine|supine]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/7420573.stm | publisher=[[BBC News Online]] | title=Israel 'has 150 nuclear weapons' | date=May 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, the London-based Arabic newspaper ''[[Al-Hayat]]'' reported that Carter met with exiled [[Hamas]] leader [[Khaled Mashaal]] on his visit to [[Syria]]. The Carter Center initially did not confirm nor deny the story. The [[US State Department]] considers Hamas a terrorist organization.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1207649973153&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Jimmy Carter Planning to meet Mashaal]&quot;, Jerusalem Post, April 9, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Within this Mid-East trip, Carter also laid a wreath on the grave of [[Yasser Arafat]] in [[Ramallah]] on April 14, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1208246574923&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull PA to Carter: Don't meet with Mashaal].&quot; Associated Press.

In May 2007, while arguing that the United States should directly talk to Iran, Carter again stated that Israel has 150 nuclear weapons in its arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/middle_east/article4004300.ece Jimmy Carter says Israel had 150 nuclear weapons], Times.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2008, Carter visited Damascus again, where he met with Syrian President [[Bashar Assad]], and the Hamas leadership. During his visit he gave an exclusive interview to [[Forward Magazine]], the first ever interview for any American president, current or former, with a Syrian media outlet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pr-usa.net/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=160253&amp;Itemid=96 |title=PR-USA.net |publisher=PR-USA.net |date=November 1, 2007 |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fw-magazine.com/content/president-jimmy-carter-speaks-forward Jimmy Carter speaks to Forward Magazine]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter visited with three officials from Hamas who have been living at the International Red Cross office in [[Jerusalem]] since July 2010. Israel believes that these three Hamas legislators had a role in the 2006 kidnapping of Israeli soldier [[Gilad Shalit]], and has a deportation order set for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Erick Stakelbeck |url=http://www.cbn.com/cbnnews/insideisrael/2011/March/Intl-Red-Cross-Aids-Hamas-Terrorist-Officials/ |title=Int'l Red Cross Sheltering Hamas Terrorist Officials |publisher=Cbn.com |date=2011-03-24 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 during the [[Syrian Civil War]], Carter was part of the UN peace envoy to Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edward Yeranian, Jessica Golloher |url=http://www.voanews.com/content/un-envoy-says-syrian-government-some-rebels-agree-to-truce/1532181.html |title=UN Envoy: Syria, Some Rebels Agree to Holiday Truce |publisher=Voanews.com |date=October 24, 2012 |accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 18, 2007, Carter joined [[Nelson Mandela]] in Johannesburg, South Africa, to announce his participation in a new humanitarian organization called [[Global Elders|The Elders]]. In October 2007, Carter toured [[Darfur]] with several of [[Global Elders|The Elders]], including [[Desmond Tutu]]. Sudanese security prevented him from visiting a Darfuri tribal leader, leading to a heated exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2007/10/03/idUKL03712818._CH_.242020071003 | work=Jimmy Carter blocked from meeting Darfur chief | date=Oct.3, 2007 | agency=Reuters | accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 18, 2007, Carter, accompanied by his wife, arrived in Dublin, Ireland, for talks with President [[Mary McAleese]] and [[Bertie Ahern]] concerning human rights. On June 19, Carter attended and spoke at the annual Human Rights Forum at [[Croke Park]]. An agreement between Irish Aid and The Carter Center was also signed on this day.

In November 2008, President Carter, former UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]], and Graca Machel, wife of Nelson Mandela, were stopped from entering [[Zimbabwe]], to inspect the human rights situation, by President [[Robert Mugabe]]'s government.

====Americas====
Carter led a mission to Haiti in 1994 with Senator [[Sam Nunn]] and former chairman of the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] [[Colin Powell|General Colin Powell]] to avert a US-led multinational invasion and restore to power Haiti's democratically elected president, [[Jean-Bertrand Aristide]].&lt;ref&gt;Larry Rohter, [http://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/18/world/showdown-with-haiti-diplomacy-carter-in-haiti-pursues-peaceful-shift.html?pagewanted=all &quot;Showdown with Haiti: Diplomacy; Carter, in Haiti, pursues peaceful shift&quot;], ''The New York Times'', September 18, 1994.

Carter visited Cuba in May 2002 and had full discussions with [[Fidel Castro]] and the [[Cuban government]]. He was allowed to address the Cuban public uncensored on national television and radio with a speech that he wrote and presented in Spanish. In the speech, he called on the US to end &quot;an ineffective 43-year-old economic embargo&quot; and on Castro to hold free elections, improve human rights, and allow greater [[civil liberties]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cartercenter.org/documents/1053.pdf Carter Center News], July–December 2002.

On May 19, 2007, Mr. Blair made his final visit to Iraq before stepping down as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]], and Carter criticized him afterward.

|title=Carter attacks Blair's Iraq role
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter described Blair's actions as &quot;abominable&quot; and stated that the British Prime Minister's &quot;almost undeviating support for the ill-advised policies of President Bush in Iraq have been a major tragedy for the world.&quot; Carter said he believes that had Blair distanced himself from the Bush administration during the run-up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq in 2003]], it might have made a crucial difference to American political and public opinion, and consequently the invasion might not have gone ahead. Carter states that &quot;one of the defenses of the Bush administration ... has been, okay, we must be more correct in our actions than the world thinks because Great Britain is backing us. So I think the combination of Bush and Blair giving their support to this tragedy in Iraq has strengthened the effort and has made the opposition less effective, and prolonged the war and increased the tragedy that has resulted.&quot; Carter expressed his hope that Blair's successor, [[Gordon Brown]], would be &quot;less enthusiastic&quot; about Bush's Iraq policy.&lt;ref name=bbc080705/&gt;

In June 2005, Carter urged the closing of the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay Prison]] in Cuba, which has been a focal point for recent claims of [[prisoner abuse]].&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/08/national/nationalspecial3/08carter.html &quot;Carter says US should close detention center at Guantanamo&quot;], June 8, 2005. Retrieved August 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2006, Carter was interviewed on the BBC's current affairs program ''[[Newsnight]]'', voicing his concern at the increasing influence of the [[Christian right|Religious Right]] on US politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediaselector/check/player/nol/newsid_5340000/newsid_5347800?redirect=5347830.stm&amp;news=1&amp;bbwm=1&amp;bbram=1&amp;nbram=1&amp;nbwm=1 Newsnight audio recording], September 2006, BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to his status as former President, Carter was a [[superdelegate]] to the 2008 [[Democratic National Convention]]. Carter announced his endorsement of Senator (now president) Barack Obama.

Speaking to the English Monthly Forward magazine of [[Syria]], Carter was asked to give one word that came to mind when mentioning President George W. Bush. His answer was: the end of a very disappointing administration. His reaction to mentioning Barack Obama was: honesty, intelligence, and politically adept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fw-magazine.com/content/president-jimmy-carter-speaks-forward Jimmy Carter Speaks to Forward Magazine.]{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 16, 2011, the 40th anniversary of [[Richard Nixon]]'s official declaration of America's [[War on Drugs]], he wrote an [[op-ed]] in ''[[The New York Times]]'' urging the United States and the rest of the world to &quot;Call Off the Global War on Drugs&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/17/opinion/17carter.html | work=The New York Times | first=Jimmy | last=Carter | title=Call Off the Global Drug War | date=June 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly endorsing the initiative released by the [[Global Commission on Drug Policy]] earlier that month and quoting a message he gave to Congress in 1977 saying that &quot;[p]enalties against possession of a drug should not be more damaging to an individual than the use of the drug itself.&quot;

===Death penalty===
Carter continues to speak out against the death penalty in the US and abroad. Most recently, in his letter to the Governor of New Mexico, [[Bill Richardson]], Carter urged him to sign a bill to eliminate the death penalty and institute life in prison without parole instead. New Mexico abolished the [[death penalty]] in 2009. Carter wrote: ''As you know, the United States is one of the few countries, along with nations such as Saudi Arabia, China, and Cuba, which still carry out the death penalty despite the ongoing tragedy of wrongful conviction and gross racial and class-based disparities that make impossible the fair implementation of this ultimate punishment''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deathpenaltyinfo.org/new-voices-jimmy-carter-urges-new-mexico-governor-support-death-penalty-repeal |title=NEW VOICES: Jimmy Carter Urges New Mexico Governor to Support Death Penalty Repeal &amp;#124; Death Penalty Information Center |publisher=Deathpenaltyinfo.org |date= |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}{{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torture===
In a 2008 interview with [[Amnesty International]], Carter criticized the alleged use of torture at [[Guantanamo Bay]], saying that it &quot;contravenes the basic principles on which this nation was founded.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|tkz_FLxaKnI|Torture can never be justified}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that the next President should publicly apologize upon his inauguration, and state that the [[United States]] will &quot;never again torture prisoners.&quot;

===Abortion===
In a March 29, 2012 interview with [[Laura Ingraham]], Carter expressed his current view of abortion and his wish to see the Democratic Party becoming more pro-life: &quot;I never have believed that Jesus Christ would approve of abortions and that was one of the problems I had when I was president having to uphold Roe v. Wade and I did everything I could to minimize the need for abortions. I made it easy to adopt children for instance who were unwanted and also initiated the program called Women and Infant Children or WIC program that's still in existence now. But except for the times when a mother's life is in danger or when a pregnancy is caused by rape or incest I would certainly not or never have approved of any abortions. I've signed a public letter calling for the Democratic Party at the next convention to espouse my position on abortion which is to minimize the need, requirement for abortion and limit it only to women whose life{{sic|?}} are in danger or who are pregnant as a result of rape or incest. I think if the Democratic Party would adopt that policy that would be acceptable to a lot of people who are now estranged from our party because of the abortion issue.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2012/03/29/jimmy_carter_democratic_party_should_be_more_pro-life.html Jimmy Carter: Democratic Party Should Be More Pro-Life, March 29, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2007 speech to Brandeis University, Carter stated: &quot;I have spent a great deal of my adult life trying to bring peace to Israel and its neighbors, based on justice and righteousness for the Palestinians. These are the underlying purposes of my new book.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cartercenter.org/news/editorials_speeches/brandeis.html Remarks by Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter at Brandeis University], The Carter Center, January 23, 2007.

In his book ''[[Palestine Peace Not Apartheid]]'', published in November 2006, Carter states:

Retrieved April 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He declares that Israel's current policies in the [[Palestinian territories]] constitute &quot;a system of [[crime of apartheid|apartheid]], with two peoples occupying the same land, but completely separated from each other, with Israelis totally dominant and suppressing violence by depriving Palestinians of their basic human rights.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;excerpt&quot;/&gt; In an Op-Ed titled &quot;Speaking Frankly about Israel and Palestine,&quot; published in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and other newspapers, Carter states:
{{quote|The ultimate purpose of my book is to present facts about the Middle East that are largely unknown in America, to precipitate discussion and to help restart peace talks (now absent for six years) that can lead to permanent peace for Israel and its neighbors. Another hope is that Jews and other Americans who share this same goal might be motivated to express their views, even publicly, and perhaps in concert. I would be glad to help with that effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes&quot;&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/commentary/la-oe-carter8dec08,0,7999232.story?coll=la-home-commentary] &quot;Speaking Frankly about Israel and Palestine&quot;, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', December 8, 2006, Op-Ed.

In December 2009, Carter apologized for any words or deeds that may have upset the Jewish community in an open letter meant to improve an often tense relationship. He said he was offering an ''Al Het'', a prayer said on [[Yom Kippur]], the Jewish Day of Atonement.&lt;ref name=&quot;apology&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/34578915/ns/us_news-faith/t/ex-president-carter-offers-apology-jews/|title=Ex-President Carter offers apology to Jews|date=December 23, 2009|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Involvement with Bank of Credit and Commerce International===
After Carter left the presidency, his interest in the developing countries led him to having a close relationship with [[Agha Hasan Abedi]], the founder of [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International]] (BCCI). Abedi was a Pakistani, whose bank had offices and business in a large number of developing countries. He was introduced to Carter in 1982 by Bert Lance, one of Carter's closest friends. (Unknown to Carter, BCCI had secretly purchased an interest in 1978 in National Bank of Georgia, which had previously been run by Lance and had made loans to Carter's peanut business.) Abedi made generous donations to the [[Carter Center]] and the Global 2000 Project. Abedi also traveled with Carter to at least seven countries in connection with Carter's charitable activities. The main purpose of Abedi's association with Carter was not charitable activities, but to enhance BCCI's influence, in order to open more offices and develop more business. In 1991, BCCI was seized by regulators, amid allegations of criminal activities, including illegally having control of several U.S. banks. Just prior to the seizure, Carter began to disassociate himself from Abedi and the bank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/1992_rpt/bcci/16ga.htm |title=16 – BCCI And Georgia Politicians |publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=September 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter serves as Honorary Chair for the [[Continuity of Government Commission]] (he was co-chair with [[Gerald Ford]] until the latter's death). The Commission recommends improvements to [[continuity of government]] measures for the federal government.

===Participation in ceremonial events===
Carter has participated in many ceremonial events such as the opening of his own presidential library and those of Presidents Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush, and Bill Clinton. He has also participated in many forums, lectures, panels, funerals and other events. Carter delivered a eulogy at the funeral of [[Coretta Scott King]] and, most recently, at the [[Death and state funeral of Gerald Ford|funeral of his former political rival]], but later his close, personal friend and diplomatic collaborator, Gerald Ford.

===Race in politics===
Carter ignited debate in September 2009 when he stated, &quot;I think an overwhelming portion of the intensely demonstrated animosity toward President Barack Obama is based on the fact that he is a black man, that he is African-American.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032619/ns/nightly_news_with_brian_williams#32884816 |title=NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams: News and videos from the evening broadcast NBC Nightly News with Brian Williams: News and videos from the evening broadcast- msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date= |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=7:27&amp;nbsp;pm ET |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/32869276/ns/politics-capitol_hill/ |title=White House disputes Carter's analysis - Capitol Hill- msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=September 16, 2009 |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Obama disagreed with Carter's assessment. On CNN Obama stated, &quot;Are there people out there who don't like me because of race? I'm sure there are...that's not the overriding issue here.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Brien |first=Michael |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/59451-obama-plays-down-role-of-race-in-criticism |title=Obama plays down role of race in criticism – The Hill's Blog Briefing Room |publisher=Thehill.com |date=September 19, 2009 |accessdate=June 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 Presidential race===
In the [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2012|Republican party 2012 Presidential primary]], Carter endorsed former [[Massachusetts]] governor [[Mitt Romney]] in mid-September, not because he supports Romney, but because he feels Obama's re-election bid would be strengthened in a race against Romney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/215259/20110916/mitt-romney-jimmy-carter-massachusetts-health-care.htm|title=Could Jimmy Carter's Comments Doom Mitt Romney?|accessdate=2011-09-22|publisher=The International Business Times Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter added that he thinks Romney would lose in a match up against Obama, and that he supports the president's re-election.&lt;ref&gt;Yahoo News, [http://news.yahoo.com/blogs/ticket/jimmy-carter-wants-mitt-romney-republican-nominee-141827488.html Jimmy Carter wants Mitt Romney to be the Republican nominee], September 16, 2011. Retrieved October 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====2012 Democratic National Convention====

Carter addressed the gathering in [[North Carolina]] by videotape, and did not attend the convention in person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Camia|first=Catalina|title=Jimmy Carter to speak by video at Dem convention|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2012/08/jimmy-carter-democratic-convention-speaker-barack-obama/1#.UCE0t2HY8bA|accessdate=7 August 2012|newspaper=USA TODAY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticisms of President Obama====
Carter has criticized the Obama administration for their use of [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] strikes against suspected terrorists.
Carter also said that he disagrees with President Obama's decision to keep [[Guantanamo Bay]] open, saying that the inmates &quot;have been tortured by [[waterboarding]] more than 100 times or intimidated with semiautomatic weapons, power drills or threats to sexually assault their mothers.&quot; He claimed that the U.S. government had no moral leadership, and was committing human rights violations, and is no longer &quot;the global champion of human rights&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bingham|first=Amy|title=Jimmy Carter Accuses U.S. of 'Widespread Abuse of Human Rights'|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2012/06/jimmy-carter-accuses-u-s-of-widespread-abuse-of-human-rights/|publisher=[[ABC News]]|accessdate=26 June 2012|date=25 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funeral and burial plans===
Carter intends to be buried in front of his home in Plains, Georgia. In contrast, most Presidents since [[Herbert Hoover]] have been buried at their presidential library or presidential museum, with the exception of [[John F. Kennedy]], who is buried at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], and [[Lyndon B. Johnson]], who is buried at his own [[Lyndon B. Johnson National Historical Park|ranch]]. Both President Carter and his wife, Rosalynn, were born in Plains. Carter also noted that a funeral in [[Washington, D.C.]] with visitation at the Carter Center is being planned as well.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, [http://web.archive.org/web/20080509034756/http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8LPLR1G0&amp;show_article=1 President Carter Talks of Funeral Plans], December 3, 2006.
