'''George Denis Patrick Carlin''' (May 12, 1937&amp;nbsp;– June 22, 2008) was an American [[stand-up comedy|stand-up comedian]], [[social criticism|social critic]], [[satirist]], [[actor]] and writer/[[author]], who won five [[Grammy Award]]s for his comedy albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/entertainmentNews/idUSTRE5171UA20090208|title=Comedian George Carlin wins posthumous Grammy|date=February 8, 2009|accessdate=2009-02-08|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin was noted for his [[black humor]] as well as his thoughts on [[politics]], the [[English language]], [[psychology]], [[religion]], and various [[taboo]] subjects. Carlin and his &quot;[[Seven dirty words|Seven Dirty Words]]&quot; comedy routine were central to the 1978 [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation]]'', in which a 5–4 decision by the justices affirmed the government's power to regulate indecent material on the public [[Radio waves|airwaves]].

The first of his fourteen stand-up comedy specials for [[HBO]] was filmed in 1977. From the late 1980s, Carlin's routines focused on socio-cultural criticism of modern American society. He often commented on contemporary political issues in the United States and satirized the excesses of [[American culture]]. His final HBO special, ''[[It's Bad for Ya]]'', was filmed less than four months before his death.

In 2004, Carlin placed second on the [[Comedy Central]] list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time, ahead of [[Lenny Bruce]] and behind [[Richard Pryor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy-zone.net/standup/comedian/index.htm|title=Stand Up Comedy &amp; Comedians|accessdate=2006-08-10|publisher=Comedy Zone}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a frequent performer and guest host on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson|The Tonight Show]]'' during the three-decade [[Johnny Carson]] era, and hosted the first episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. In 2008, he was posthumously awarded the [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]].

==Early life==
Carlin was born in [[Manhattan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Carlin, George|title=[[Complaints and Grievances]]|medium=TV|publisher=[[HBO]]|date=2001-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Last Words (book)|Last Words]]|last=Carlin|first=George|chapter=The Old Man and the Sunbeam|publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]]|date=2009-11-10|location=New York|page=6|isbn=1-4391-7295-1|quote=Lying there in New York Hospital, my first definitive act on this planet was to vomit.}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second son of Mary (Beary), a secretary, and Patrick Carlin, a national advertising manager for the ''[[New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;filmr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/52/George-Carlin.html|title=George Carlin Biography (1937-)|publisher=Filmreference.com|date=|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carlin was of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent and was raised a [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Carlin, George|title=[[It's Bad for Ya!]]|medium=TV|publisher=[[HBO]]|date=2008-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Class Clown]]'', &quot;I Used to Be Irish Catholic&quot;, 1972, [[Little David Records]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.cnn.com/cnn/archive/archive/detail/80004/full|title=George Carlin knows what's 'Bad for Ya'|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|agency=Associated Press|date=2008-02-28|accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He grew up on West 121st Street, in a neighborhood of Manhattan which he later said, in a stand-up routine, he and his friends called &quot;White Harlem&quot;, because that sounded a lot tougher than its real name of [[Morningside Heights]].  He was raised by his mother, who left his father when Carlin was two months old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.psychologytoday.com/blog/brainstorm/200806/george-carlins-last-interview ''Psychology Today: George Carlin's last interview'']. Retrieved August 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He attended Corpus Christi School, a Roman Catholic parish school of the [[Corpus Christi Church (New York City)|Corpus Christi Church]], in Morningside Heights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgecarlin.com/update_10-29-08/timeline/early_years.html &quot;George Carlin: Early Years&quot;], George Carlin website (''georgecarlin.com'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flegenheimer, Matt, [http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/25/pondering-a-carlin-street-and-keeping-the-7-words-in-check/ &quot;'Carlin Street' Resisted by His Old Church.

He also briefly attended the Salesian High School in Goshen, NY.

He was stationed at [[Barksdale Air Force Base]] in [[Bossier City, Louisiana]].

During this time he began working as a [[disc jockey]] at radio station KJOE, in the nearby city of [[Shreveport]]. He did not complete his Air Force enlistment. Labeled an &quot;unproductive airman&quot; by his superiors, Carlin was discharged on July 29, 1957. During his time in the Air Force he was [[court martial]]ed three times, and also received many disciplinary punishments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117987925 Comedian George Carlin dies at 71] [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]], June 22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1959, Carlin and [[Jack Burns]] began as a comedy team when both were working for radio station [[KMNY|KXOL]] in [[Fort Worth, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texasradiohalloffame.com/georgecarlin.html|title=Texas Radio Hall of Fame: George Carlin}}&lt;/ref&gt; After successful performances at Fort Worth's beat coffeehouse, The Cellar, Burns and Carlin headed for California in February 1960 and stayed together for two years as a team before moving on to individual pursuits.

===1960s===
Within weeks of arriving in California in 1960, Burns and Carlin put together an audition tape and created ''The Wright Brothers'', a morning show on [[KDAY]] in Hollywood. The comedy team worked there for three months, honing their material in [[beatnik]] coffeehouses at night.&lt;ref name=bio60s&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3B.html|title=Timeline - 1960s|work=George Carlin Biography|accessdate=2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Years later when he was honored with a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], Carlin requested that it be placed in front of the KDAY studios near the corner of Sunset Boulevard and Vine Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/calendar/index.cfm?fuseaction=showIndividual&amp;entity_id=19830&amp;source_type=A|title=Biographical information for George Carlin|publisher=Kennedy Center|date=|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burns and Carlin recorded their only album, ''[[Burns and Carlin at the Playboy Club Tonight]]'', in May 1960 at Cosmo Alley in Hollywood.&lt;ref name=bio60s/&gt;

In the 1960s, Carlin began appearing on television variety shows, notably ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' and ''[[The Tonight Show]]''. His most famous routines were:
* The Indian Sergeant (&quot;You wit' the beads... get outta line&quot;)
* Stupid disc jockeys (&quot;Wonderful WINO...&quot;)—&quot;The Beatles' latest record, when played backwards at slow speed, says 'Dummy! You're playing it backwards at slow speed!'&quot;
* Al Sleet, the &quot;hippie-dippie weatherman&quot;—&quot;Tonight's forecast: Dark. Continued dark throughout most of the evening, with some widely scattered light towards morning.&quot;
* Jon Carson—the &quot;world never known, and never to be known&quot;

Variations on the first three of these routines appear on Carlin's 1967 debut album, ''[[Take Offs and Put Ons]]'', recorded live in 1966 at The Roostertail in [[Detroit, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/home/home.html|title=George Carlin's official site (see Timeline) . Retrieved August 14, 2006|publisher=Georgecarlin.com|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:George Carlin Buddy Greco Away We Go 1967.JPG|thumb|left|180px|Carlin with singer [[Buddy Greco]] in ''Away We Go''.  The summer replacement show also starred drummer [[Buddy Rich]].]]
During this period, Carlin became more popular as a frequent performer and guest host on ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', initially with [[Jack Paar]] as host, then with [[Johnny Carson]]. Carlin became one of Carson's most frequent substitutes during the host's three-decade reign. Carlin was also cast in ''Away We Go'', a 1967 comedy show that aired on CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0061235/|title=Away We Go|year=1967|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His material during his early career and his appearance, which consisted of suits and short-cropped hair, had been seen as &quot;conventional&quot;, particularly when contrasted with his later anti-establishment material.&lt;ref&gt;''[[ABC World News Tonight]]''; June 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin was present at [[Lenny Bruce]]'s arrest for obscenity. As the police began attempting to detain members of the audience for questioning, they asked Carlin for his identification. Telling the police he did not believe in government-issued IDs, he was arrested and taken to jail with Bruce in the same vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Profanity|episodelink=List of Bullshit! episodes|series=Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|serieslink=Penn &amp; Teller: Bullshit!|network=[[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]|airdate=2004-08-12|season=2|number=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1970s===
Eventually, Carlin changed both his routines and his appearance. He lost some TV bookings by dressing strangely for a comedian of the time, wearing faded jeans and sporting long hair, a beard, and earrings at a time when clean-cut, well-dressed comedians were the norm. Using his own persona as a springboard for his new comedy, he was presented by [[Ed Sullivan]] in a performance of &quot;The Hair Piece&quot; and quickly regained his popularity as the public caught on to his sense of style.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Georgecarlinmugshot.jpg|thumb|George Carlin's 1972 mugshot.{{Deletable image-caption|Friday, 13 November 2009|date=February 2012}}]] --&gt;
In this period he also perfected what is perhaps his best-known routine, &quot;[[Seven dirty words|Seven Words You Can Never Say on Television]]&quot;, recorded on ''[[Class Clown]]''. Carlin was arrested on July 21, 1972, at [[Milwaukee]]'s [[Summerfest]] and charged with violating [[obscenity]] laws after performing this routine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=626471|title=Carlin's naughty words still ring in officer's ears|author=Jim Stingl|publisher=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|date=June 30, 2007|accessdate=2008-03-23|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070929124942/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=626471|archivedate=September 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case, which prompted Carlin to refer to the words for a time as &quot;the Milwaukee Seven,&quot; was dismissed in December of that year; the judge declared that the language was indecent but Carlin had the freedom to say it as long as he caused no disturbance. In 1973, a man complained to the [[Federal Communications Commission]] after listening with his son to a similar routine, &quot;Filthy Words&quot;, from ''[[Occupation: Foole]]'', broadcast one afternoon over [[WBAI]], a [[Pacifica Foundation]] [[Frequency modulation|FM]] [[radio station]] in [[New York City]]. Pacifica received a citation from the FCC that sought to fine the company for violating FCC regulations that prohibited broadcasting &quot;obscene&quot; material. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] upheld the FCC action by a vote of 5 to 4, ruling that the routine was &quot;indecent but not obscene&quot; and that the FCC had authority to prohibit such broadcasts during hours when children were likely to be among the audience. (''[[F.C.C. v. Pacifica Foundation]]'', 438 U.S. 726 (1978). The court documents contain a complete transcript of the routine.)&lt;ref name=&quot;EFF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/FCC_v_Pacifica/fcc_v_pacifica.decision|title=FCC vs. Pacifica Foundation|date=July 3, 1978|publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]|accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversy only increased Carlin's fame. Carlin eventually expanded the dirty-words theme with a seemingly interminable end to a performance (ending with his voice fading out in one HBO version and accompanying the credits in the ''[[Carlin at Carnegie]]'' special for the 1982-83 season) and a set of 49 web pages&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/dirty/2443.html|title=BBS|publisher=George Carlin|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; organized by subject and embracing his &quot;Incomplete List Of Impolite Words.&quot;

It was on-stage during a rendition of his &quot;Dirty Words&quot; routine that Carlin learned that his previous comedy album ''FM &amp; AM'' had won the Grammy. Midway through the performance on the album ''Occupation: Foole'', he can be heard thanking someone for handing him a piece of paper. He then exclaims &quot;Shit!&quot; and proudly announces his win to the audience.

Carlin hosted the premiere broadcast of [[NBC]]'s ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', on October 11, 1975, the only episode as of at least 2007 in which the host had no involvement (at his request) in sketches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Geoffrey Hammill, The Museum of Broadcast Communications|url=http://www.museum.tv/archives/etv/S/htmlS/saturdaynigh/saturdaynigh.htm|title=Saturday Night Live|accessdate=May 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, 1976–77, Carlin also appeared regularly on [[CBS]] Television's ''[[Tony Orlando &amp; Dawn]]'' variety series.
    
Carlin unexpectedly stopped performing regularly in 1976, when his career appeared to be at its height. For the next five years, he rarely performed stand-up, although it was at this time that he began doing specials for HBO as part of its ''[[On Location (TV series)|On Location]]'' series. He later revealed that he had suffered the first of three [[myocardial infarction|heart attacks]] during this layoff period.&lt;ref name=&quot;bravo&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=George Carlin|episodelink=Inside the Actors Studio|series=Inside the Actors Studio|serieslink=Inside the Actors Studio|network=[[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo TV]]|airdate=2004-10-31|season=1|number=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His first two HBO specials aired in 1977 and 1978.

===1980s and 1990s===
In 1981, Carlin returned to the stage, releasing ''[[A Place for My Stuff]]'' and returning to HBO and New York City with the ''[[Carlin at Carnegie]]'' [[TV special]], videotaped at [[Carnegie Hall]] and airing during the 1982-83 season. Carlin continued doing HBO specials every year or every other year over the following decade and a half. All of Carlin's albums from this time forward are from the HBO specials.

He hosted ''SNL'' for the second time on November 10, 1984, this time appearing in several sketches.
Carlin's acting career was primed with a major supporting role in the 1987 comedy hit ''[[Outrageous Fortune (film)|Outrageous Fortune]]'', starring [[Bette Midler]] and [[Shelley Long]]; it was his first notable screen role after a handful of previous guest roles on television series. Playing drifter Frank Madras, the role poked fun at the lingering effect of the [[1960s counterculture]]. In 1989, he gained popularity with a new generation of teens when he was cast as Rufus, the time-traveling mentor of the titular characters in ''[[Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'', and reprised his role in the film sequel ''[[Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey]]'' as well as the first season of the [[Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventures (1990 TV series)|cartoon series]]. From 1991 to 1995, he narrated the American version of the children's show ''[[Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends]]'', and played &quot;Mr. Conductor&quot; on ''[[Shining Time Station]]'' from 1991 to 1993. Also in 1991, Carlin had a major supporting role in the movie ''[[The Prince of Tides]]'', which starred [[Nick Nolte]] and [[Barbra Streisand]].

Carlin began a weekly [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] [[sitcom]], ''[[The George Carlin Show]]'', in 1993, playing New York City [[taxicab]] driver George O'Grady. &lt;!--He quickly included a variation of the &quot;seven words&quot; in the plot.--&gt; The show, created and written by ''[[The Simpsons]]'' co-creator [[Sam Simon]], ran 27 episodes through December 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgecarlin.com/time/time3E.html|title=1990-1999|publisher=GeorgeCarlin.com|date=|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his final book, the posthumously published ''[[Last Words (book)|Last Words]]'', Carlin said about ''The George Carlin Show'', &quot;I was incredibly happy when the show was canceled. I was frustrated that it had taken me away from my true work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Last Words', Simon &amp; Schuster, 2009'&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, his first hardcover book, ''[[Brain Droppings]]'', was published.  The book sold nearly 900,000 copies and spent 40 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kennedy-center.org/explorer/artists/?entity_id=19830|title=The Kennedy Center|accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Carlin was honored at the 1997 [[Aspen Comedy Festival]] with a retrospective, ''[[George Carlin: 40 Years of Comedy]]'', hosted by [[Jon Stewart]].

In 1999, Carlin played a supporting role as a satirical [[Roman Catholic]] [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinal]] in filmmaker [[Kevin Smith]]'s movie ''[[Dogma (film)|Dogma]]''. He worked with Smith again with a [[cameo appearance]] in ''[[Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back]]'' and later played an atypically serious role in ''[[Jersey Girl (2004 movie)|Jersey Girl]]'' as the [[blue-collar]] father of [[Ben Affleck]]'s character.

===2000s===
In 2001, Carlin was given a [[Lifetime Achievement Award]] at the 15th Annual [[American Comedy Awards]].
In December 2003, California U.S. Representative [[Doug Ose]] (Republican), introduced a bill (H.R. 3687) to outlaw the broadcast of Carlin's &quot;seven dirty words&quot;,&lt;ref name=HR3687&gt;Library of Congress. [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:h3687: Bill Summary &amp; Status 108th Congress (2003 - 2004) H.R.3687]. THOMAS website. Retrieved July 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; including &quot;compound use (including hyphenated compounds) of such words and phrases with each other or with other words or phrases, and other grammatical forms of such words and phrases (including verb, adjective, gerund, participle, and infinitive forms).&quot; (The bill omits &quot;tits&quot;, but includes &quot;asshole&quot;, which was not part of Carlin's original routine.) This bill was never voted on. The last action on this bill was its referral to the [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties|House Judiciary Committee on the Constitution]] on January 15, 2004.&lt;ref name=HR3687/&gt;

For years, Carlin had performed regularly as a headliner in Las Vegas, but in 2005 he was fired from his headlining position at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas]] in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], after an altercation with his audience. After a poorly received set filled with dark references to suicide bombings and beheadings, Carlin stated that he could not wait to get out of &quot;this fucking hotel&quot; and Las Vegas, claiming he wanted to go back east, &quot;where the real people are.&quot; He continued to insult his audience, stating:
{{quotation|People who go to Las Vegas, you've got to question their fucking intellect to start with. Traveling hundreds and thousands of miles to essentially give your money to a large corporation is kind of fucking moronic. That's what I'm always getting here is these kind of fucking people with very limited intellects.}}
An audience member shouted back that Carlin should &quot;stop degrading us&quot;, at which point Carlin responded, &quot;Thank you very much, whatever that was. I hope it was positive; if not, well, blow me.&quot; He was immediately fired by MGM Grand and soon after announced he would enter rehab for alcohol and prescription painkiller addiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;tagreviewj&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2004/Dec-04-Sat-2004/news/25407915.html|title=reviewjournal.com|publisher=reviewjournal.com|date=2004-12-04|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2004-12-27/entertainment/george.carlin_1_rehab-jeff-abraham-pork-chops?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ|title=George Carlin enters rehab|publisher=[[CNN.com]]|date=2004-12-29|accessdate=2010-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He began a tour through the first half of 2006 following the airing of his thirteenth HBO Special on November 5, 2005, entitled ''[[Life is Worth Losing]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hbo.com/events/gcarlin/?ntrack_para1=insidehbo3_text|title=Carlin: Life is Worth Losing|publisher=HBO|date=|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was shown live from the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]] in [[New York City]] and in which he stated early on: &quot;I've got 341 days of sobriety,&quot; referring to the rehab he entered after being fired from MGM. Topics covered included [[suicide]], [[natural disaster]]s (and the desire to see them escalate in severity), [[cannibalism]], [[genocide]], [[human sacrifice]], threats to [[civil liberties]] in America, and how an argument can be made that humans are inferior to other animals.

On February 1, 2006, during his ''Life Is Worth Losing'' set at the Tachi Palace Casino in [[Lemoore, California]], Carlin mentioned to the crowd that he had been discharged from the hospital only six weeks previously for [[heart failure]] and [[pneumonia]], citing the appearance as his &quot;first show back&quot;.

Carlin provided the voice of Fillmore, a character in the [[Disney]]/[[Pixar]] animated feature ''[[Cars (film)|Cars]]'', which opened in theaters on June 9, 2006. The character Fillmore, who is presented as an anti-establishment hippie, is a [[VW Microbus]] with a [[psychedelic]] paint job whose front license plate reads &quot;51237&quot;, Carlin's birthday. In 2007, Carlin provided the voice of the wizard in ''[[Happily N'Ever After]]'', along with [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]], [[Freddie Prinze Jr.]], [[Andy Dick]], and [[Wallace Shawn]], his last film.

Carlin's last HBO stand-up special, ''[[It's Bad for Ya]]'', aired live on March 1, 2008, from the [[Wells Fargo Center for the Arts]] in [[Santa Rosa, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/movies/dvd/2007-09-24-carlin-collection_N.htm|title=George Carlin reflects on 50 years (or so) of 'All My Stuff'|author=Wloszczyna, Susan|publisher=''[[USA Today]]''|date=2007-09-24|accessdate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The themes that appeared in this HBO special included &quot;American Bullshit&quot;, &quot;Rights&quot;, &quot;Death&quot;, &quot;Old Age&quot;, and &quot;Child Rearing&quot;.  In his routine, he brought to light many of the problems facing America, and he told his audience to cut through the &quot;bullshit&quot; of the world and &quot;enjoy the carnival&quot;.  Carlin had been working on the new material for this HBO special for several months prior in concerts all over the country.

==Personal life==
In 1961, Carlin married Brenda Hosbrook (August 5, 1936 – May 11, 1997), whom he had met while touring the previous year. The couple's only child, a daughter named Kelly, was born on June 15, 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Last Words|last=Carlin|first=George|coauthors=[[Tony Hendra]]|year=2009|publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]]|isbn=978-1-4391-7295-7|pages=150–151}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, George and Brenda renewed their wedding vows in Las Vegas. Brenda died of [[liver cancer]] a day before Carlin's 60th birthday, in 1997.

Carlin later married Sally Wade on June 24, 1998, in a private, unregistered ceremony. The marriage lasted until his death, two days before their tenth anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|title=George Carlin's Loved Ones Speak Out|url=http://www.etonline.com/news/2008/06/62841/index.html|publisher=''Entertainment Tonight''|date=2008-06-23|accessdate=2008-06-23|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080625032232/http://www.etonline.com/news/2008/06/62841/index.html|archivedate=June 25, 2008}}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carlin often criticized elections as an illusion of choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=April 06, 2008|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VOWe4-KXqMM|title=1:37|publisher=Youtube.com|date=2008-04-06|accessdate=2009-07-30}}{{dead link|date=September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said the last time he voted was in 1972, for [[George McGovern]] who ran for President against [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://althouse.blogspot.com/2004/11/george-carlin.html|title=George Carlin.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Although raised in the [[Roman Catholic]] faith, which he describes anecdotally on the albums ''[[FM &amp; AM]]'' and ''[[Class Clown]]'', religion, God, and particularly religious adherents were frequent subjects of criticism in Carlin's routines. He described his opinion of the flaws of organized religion in interviews and performances, notably with his &quot;Religion&quot; and &quot;There Is No God&quot; routines as heard in ''[[You Are All Diseased]]''. His views on religion are also mentioned in his last HBO stand up show ''It's Bad for Ya'' where he mocked the traditional swearing on the Bible as &quot;bullshit&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MeSSwKffj9o George Carlin - Religion is bullshit. - YouTube&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;make believe&quot;, and &quot;kids' stuff&quot;. In ''It's Bad for Ya'', Carlin ridiculed religion by listing the types of hats religions ban or require as part of their practices. He mentions that he would never want to be a part of a group that requires or bans the wearing of hats. Carlin also joked in his second book, ''[[Brain Droppings]]'', that he worshipped the [[Sun]], one reason being that he could see it.

==Themes==
Carlin's material falls under one of three self-described categories: &quot;the little world&quot; (observational humor), &quot;the big world&quot; (social commentary), and the peculiarities of the English language ([[euphemisms]], [[doublespeak]], [[business jargon]]), all sharing the overall theme of (in his words) &quot;humanity's bullshit&quot;, which might include murder, genocide, war, rape, corruption, religion and other aspects of human civilization. He was known for mixing observational humour with larger social commentary. His delivery frequently treated these subjects in a [[misanthropy|misanthropic]] and [[nihilism|nihilistic]] fashion, such as in his statement during the ''Life is Worth Losing'' show:
{{quotation|I look at it this way... For centuries now, man has done everything he can to destroy, defile, and interfere with nature: clear-cutting forests, strip-mining mountains, poisoning the atmosphere, over-fishing the oceans, polluting the rivers and lakes, destroying wetlands and aquifers... so when nature strikes back, and smacks him on the head and kicks him in the nuts, I enjoy that. I have absolutely no sympathy for human beings whatsoever. None. And no matter what kind of problem humans are facing, whether it's natural or man-made, I always hope it gets worse.}}

Language was a frequent focus of Carlin's work. Euphemisms that, in his view, seek to distort and lie and the use of language he felt was pompous, presumptuous, or silly were often the target of Carlin's routines. When asked on ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' what turned him on, he responded, &quot;Reading about language.&quot; When asked what made him most proud about his career, he said the number of his books that have been sold, close to a million copies.

Carlin also gave special attention to prominent topics in [[American Culture|American]] and [[Western Culture]], such as obsession with fame and celebrity, [[consumerism]], conservative [[Christianity]], [[political alienation]], corporate control, hypocrisy, child raising, [[fast food]] diet, news stations, [[self-help]] publications, blind [[patriotism]], sexual taboos, certain uses of technology and surveillance, and the [[pro-life]] position,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Abortion&quot; in the HBO Special ''[[Back in Town]]''&lt;/ref&gt; among many others.

[[File:Carlin does Trenton.jpg|thumb|upright|George Carlin in [[Trenton, New Jersey]] April 4, 2008]]
Carlin openly communicated in his shows and in his interviews that his purpose for existence was entertainment, that he was &quot;here for the show.&quot; He professed a hearty ''[[schadenfreude]]'' in watching the rich spectrum of humanity slowly self-destruct, in his estimation, of its own design, saying, &quot;When you're born, you get a ticket to the freak show. When you're born in America, you get a front-row seat.&quot; He acknowledged that this is a very selfish thing, especially since he included large human catastrophes as entertainment. In his ''[[You Are All Diseased]]'' concert, he elaborated somewhat on this, telling the audience, &quot;I have always been willing to put myself at great personal risk for the sake of entertainment. And I've always been willing to put ''you'' at great personal risk, for the same reason!&quot;

In the same interview, he recounted his experience of a California [[earthquake]] in the early 1970s, as &quot;[a]n amusement park ride. Really, I mean it's such a wonderful thing to realize that you have ''absolutely'' no control, and to see the dresser move across the bedroom floor unassisted is just exciting.&quot;

A routine in Carlin's 1999 HBO special ''[[You Are All Diseased]]'' focusing on [[airport security]] leads up to the statement: &quot;Take a fucking chance! Put a little fun in your life! Most Americans are soft and frightened and unimaginative and they don't realize there's such a thing as dangerous fun, and they certainly don't recognize a good show when they see one.&quot;

Along with wordplay and sex jokes, Carlin had always included politics as part of his material, but by the mid 1980s he had become a strident social critic in both his HBO specials and the book compilations of his material, bashing both [[conservative]]s and [[Liberalism|liberals]] alike. His HBO viewers got an especially sharp taste of this in his take on the [[Ronald Reagan]] administration during the 1988 special ''[[What Am I Doing In New Jersey?]]'', broadcast live from the [[Park Performing Arts Center|Park Theatre]] in [[Union City, New Jersey]].

==Death and legacy==
Carlin had a history of cardiac problems spanning several decades. These included three heart attacks (in 1978 at age 41, 1982 and 1991), an [[arrhythmia]] requiring an [[ablation]] procedure in 2003, and a significant episode of [[heart failure]] in late 2005.  He twice underwent [[angioplasty]] to reopen narrowed arteries.&lt;ref&gt;Carlin, G. (2009). Last words. New York, NY: Simon &amp; Schuster.  pp. 75–76.&lt;/ref&gt;  In early 2005 he entered a drug rehabilitation facility for treatment of [[Substance use disorder|addictions]] to alcohol and [[Vicodin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|last=|first=|title=George Carlin enters rehab|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SHOWBIZ/books/12/27/george.carlin/index.html|publisher=''CNN''|date=2004-12-29|accessdate=2008-01-19|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On June 22, 2008, Carlin was admitted to [[Saint John's Health Center]] in Santa Monica after experiencing chest pain, and he died later that day at 5:55 p.m. Pacific Time of heart failure.

In tribute, HBO broadcast eleven of his fourteen HBO specials from June 25–28, including a twelve-hour marathon block on their ''HBO Comedy'' channel.  NBC scheduled a rerun of the premiere episode of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', which Carlin hosted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suntimes.com/entertainment/1021949,carlintv062408.article ''HBO, 'SNL' to replay classic Carlin this week'']{{dead link|date=September 2012}} Retrieved on June 24, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvdecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/06/23/george-carlins-televised-stage/ George Carlin Televised] Retrieved on June 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hbo.com/apps/schedule/ScheduleServlet?ACTION_TODAY=TODAY HBO schedule] Retrieved on June 27, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Both [[Sirius Satellite Radio]]'s &quot;Raw Dog Comedy&quot; and [[XM Satellite Radio]]'s &quot;XM Comedy&quot; channels ran a memorial marathon of George Carlin recordings the day following his death.  [[Larry King]] devoted his entire June 23 show to a tribute to Carlin, featuring interviews with [[Jerry Seinfeld]], [[Bill Maher]], [[Roseanne Barr]] and [[Lewis Black]], as well as Carlin's daughter Kelly and his brother, [[Patrick Carlin (writer)|Patrick]].

On June 24, ''[[The New York Times]]'' printed an op-ed piece on Carlin by Jerry Seinfeld.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|last=Seinfeld|first=Jerry|title=Dying Is Hard.

[[Louis C.K.]] dedicated his stand-up special ''Chewed Up'' to Carlin, and Lewis Black dedicated his entire second season of ''[[Lewis Black's Root of All Evil|Root of All Evil]]'' to him.

For a number of years, Carlin had been compiling and writing his autobiography, to be released in conjunction with a one-man Broadway show tentatively titled ''New York City Boy.'' After his death [[Tony Hendra]], his collaborator on both projects, edited the autobiography for release as ''[[Last Words (book)|Last Words]]'' (ISBN 1-4391-7295-1). The book, chronicling most of Carlin's life and future plans (including the one-man show) was published in 2009.

==Internet hoaxes==
Since the birth of [[spam email]] on the internet, many chain-forwards, usually rantlike and with blunt statements of belief on political and social issues and attributed to being written (or stated) by George Carlin himself, have made continuous rounds on the junk email circuit. The website [[Snopes]], an online resource that debunks historic and present [[urban legend]]s and myths, has extensively covered these forgeries. Many of the falsely attributed email attachments have contained material that runs directly opposite to Carlin's viewpoints, with some being especially volatile toward racial groups, gays, women, the homeless, etc. Carlin himself, when he was made aware of each of these bogus emails, would debunk them on his own website, writing: &quot;Nothing you see on the Internet is mine unless it comes from one of my albums, books, HBO specials, or appeared on my website,&quot; and that &quot;it bothers me that some people might believe that I would be capable of writing some of this stuff.&quot;&lt;ref name=SnopesAging&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/glurge/aging.asp Barbara Mikkelson. &quot;George Carlin on Aging&quot; [[snopes.com]]; June 27, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/soapbox/paradox.asp|title=Barbara Mikkelson. &quot;The Paradox of Our Time&quot; snopes.com; November 1, 2007|publisher=Snopes.com|date=|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/soapbox/carlin.asp|title=&quot;The Bad American&quot; snopes.com; October 2, 2005|publisher=Snopes.com|date=|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/katrina/soapbox/carlin.asp|title=Barbara Mikkelson &quot;Hurricane Rules&quot; snopes.com; October 23, 2005|publisher=Snopes.com|date=|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/soapbox/carlingas.asp|title=Barbara Mikkelson &quot;Gas Crisis Solution&quot; snopes.com; February 5, 2007|publisher=Snopes.com|date=|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/politics/soapbox/newrules.asp|title=&quot;New Rules for 2006&quot; January 12, 2006|publisher=Snopes.com|date=|accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
