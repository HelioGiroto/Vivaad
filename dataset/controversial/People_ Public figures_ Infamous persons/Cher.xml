'''Cher''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|ʃ|ɛər}};&lt;ref name=&quot;pronunciation&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://inogolo.com/pronunciation/d1638/Cher| title = Pronunciation of Cher| work=inogolo| accessdate =2010-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--(Armenian: Չերիլյն Սարկիսիան )--&gt; born '''Cherilyn Sarkisian'''; May 20, 1946) is an American singer, actress, television personality, director, record producer and entrepreneur. Well known for having worked extensively across media, she has won an [[Academy Award]], a [[Grammy Award]], an [[Emmy Award]], three [[Golden Globe Award]]s, and the [[Best Actress Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actress Award]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] for her work in film, music and television. She is the only person in history to receive all of these awards. Referred to as the [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Goddess of Pop]] for being an influential figure in [[popular culture]], she is also known for continuously reinventing both her music and image, her distinctive [[contralto]], the considerable [[eclecticism]] of her work and her outrageous imagery which have been known to induce controversy.

Cher first caught the eye and ear of the public in 1965 as one-half of the [[pop rock]] duo [[Sonny &amp; Cher]], which have popularized a peculiar smooth sound that competed successfully with the predominant [[British Invasion]] and [[Motown Sound]] of the era. After a period in which the duo became obsolete thanks to the rise of the drug culture, she re-emerged in the 1970s as a television personality with her shows ''[[The Sonny &amp; Cher Comedy Hour]]'' and ''[[The Cher Show|Cher]]''. With the latter, she became a fashion trendsetter with her daring [[Bob Mackie]]-designed outfits, and was noted as being the first woman to expose her navel on television. At the same time, she established herself as a solo artist with chart-topping hits such as &quot;[[Bang Bang (My Baby Shot Me Down)]]&quot;, &quot;[[Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves]]&quot;, &quot;[[Half-Breed (song)|Half-Breed]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Dark Lady (song)|Dark Lady]]&quot;. After the duo separated in 1975, she had successful delves into disco music before becoming a top-earning live act in Las Vegas.

In the early 1980s, Cher made a critically-acclaimed appearance on Broadway and starred in the film ''[[Silkwood]]'', which earned her a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] in 1983. In the following years, she established herself as one of the most acclaimed film actresses of the decade, starring in a string of hit films that includes ''[[Mask (film)|Mask]]'', ''[[The Witches of Eastwick (film)|The Witches of Eastwick]]'', and ''[[Moonstruck]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] in 1988.  Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, she made a musical comeback by releasing a series of multi-platinum rock albums and hit singles such as &quot;[[I Found Someone]]&quot;, &quot;[[If I Could Turn Back Time]]&quot;, and &quot;[[The Shoop Shoop Song (It's in His Kiss)]]&quot;. After facing professional struggles by appearing in a series of cosmetic infomercials in the mid-1990s, she returned to popularity by making her directing debut in the film ''[[If These Walls Could Talk]]'' (1996) and releasing the biggest-selling single of her career, &quot;[[Believe (Cher song)|Believe]]&quot;, which was also the best-selling single of 1998 and 1999. Cher ended her three-year-long [[Living Proof: The Farewell Tour]] in 2005 as the most successful tour by a female artist at that time. In 2008, she signed a US $60 million per-year deal with [[Caesars Palace]] in Las Vegas to perform a series of shows titled [[Cher at the Colosseum]], which ended in February 2011.

Biographer [[Mark Bego]] says of her impact: &quot;No one in the history of show business has had a career of the magnitude and scope of Cher's&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bego legacy&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bego|2004|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Called &quot;an authentic feminist hero&quot; by ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine and the &quot;Queen of the Comeback&quot; by ''[[The New York Times]]'', she has been praised by critics for first bringing the sense of reinvention and self-actualization into entertainment industry. She has sold more than 100 million records worldwide and is recognized as one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists of all time]]. She is the only artist to have notched a number-one single on a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' chart in each of the past six decades.

== Early life ==

Cher was born Cherilyn Sarkisian in [[El Centro, California]], on May 20, 1946.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 17&quot; /&gt; Her father, John Sarkisian, was an [[Armenian American]] truck driver and [[drug addict]] with a gambling habit, and her mother, Georgia Holt ([[married and maiden names|born]] Jackie Jean Crouch), was an aspiring actress and model with Irish, English, German and [[Cherokee]] descent.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoomovies&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 17&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Berman|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Georgia's descent&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Cheever |first=Susan |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20110424,00.html |title=In a Broken Land |work=People |date=1993-05-17 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents had a stormy relationship, eventually divorcing in [[Reno]], when Cher was ten months old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 17&quot; /&gt; Holt and John married and divorced two more times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 17&quot; /&gt; The third of Holt's eight marriages was to actor John Southall, the father of Cher's half-sister, actress [[Georganne LaPiere]]. Although their marriage ended when Cher was nine years old, she considers Southall her real father and remembers him as a &quot;good-natured man who turned belligerent when he drank too much&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 18&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Berman|2001|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Holt married and divorced, the family moved from place to place (including New York, Texas and California)&lt;ref name=&quot;hollywoodsongsters-p147&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; and often had little money.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 18&quot; /&gt; At one point, Holt had to put Cher in an orphanage. Although they met every day, Holt and Cher found the experience traumatic.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 18&quot; /&gt;

Cher's family noticed her creativity when she produced the musical ''[[Oklahoma!]]'' for her teacher and her class. According to biographer Connie Berman, &quot;Cher got a group of girls together and directed and created the dance routines. Since she couldn't get the boys to take part, Cher acted the men's roles and sang their songs. Even at that age, she had an unusually low voice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berman|2001|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the difficult times and the instability of her mother's marriages, Cher wanted to be famous since childhood, but felt that she was &quot;unattractive&quot; and &quot;not very talented&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 21&quot; /&gt; She later commented in an interviewer, &quot;I couldn't think of anything that I could do&amp;nbsp;... I didn't think I'd be a singer or dancer. I just thought, well, I'll be famous. That was my goal.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 21&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Berman|2001|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cher HS Yearbook.jpg|thumb|left|170px|Cher in high school years]]
In 1961, Holt married bank manager Gilbert LaPiere, who adopted both Cher and her half-sister and enrolled them in a private school, [[Montclair College Preparatory School|Montclair Prep]], in the prosperous community of [[Encino, Los Angeles]]. Like Cher's stepfather, the fathers of Montclair Prep students were financially successful. Such &quot;posh&quot; surroundings presented a challenge for Cher, as Berman wrote she &quot;stood out from the others in both her striking appearance and outgoing personality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 21&quot; /&gt; A former classmate recalled, &quot;I'll never forget seeing Cher for the first time. She was so special&amp;nbsp;... She was like a movie star, right then and there&amp;nbsp;... She said she was going to be a movie star and we knew she would.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 21&quot; /&gt; Despite not being a top student, Cher was considered intelligent and creative. She usually got good [[Grade (education)|grades]] and did well in French and English. Later, as an adult, she would discover that she had suffered from a learning disability called [[dyslexia]]. She also achieved notoriety for her unconventional behavior: she would entertain other students during lunch hour performing songs and shock a few when she'd wear a midriff-baring top, being the first young woman in her crowd to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 22&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Berman|2001|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She recalled later, &quot;I was never really in school. I was always thinking about when I was grown up and famous.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hollywoodsongsters-p147&quot; /&gt; In those years, Cher had a brief relationship with actor [[Warren Beatty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoomovies&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.yahoo.com/movie/contributor/1800023318/bio |title=Cher Biography |work=Yahoo!

== Career and public life ==

=== 1960s: Rise and fall ===
[[File:Sonny-and-Cher.jpg|thumb|left|Cher with [[Sonny Bono]] in 1966]]
At the age of 16, Cher dropped out of school, left her mother's house, and moved in to Los Angeles with a friend, where she took acting classes and had numerous jobs to support herself. She came to dance in small [[nightclub|club]]s along Hollywood's [[Sunset Strip]], introducing herself to performers, managers, and agents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 23&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Berman|2001|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to biographer Connie Berman, &quot;The teen did not hesitate to approach anyone she thought could help her get a break, make a new contact, or get an audition.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 24&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Berman|2001|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cher met [[Sonny Bono]], 11 years her senior, in November 1962 when he was working for &quot;[[Wall of Sound]]&quot; record producer [[Phil Spector]].&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoomovies&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 24&quot; /&gt; Shortly after, Cher's friend moved out of their apartment, and Cher took up Sonny's offer to move in with him as his [[Housekeeper (servant)|housekeeper]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 27&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Berman|2001|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They became inseparable friends, eventual lovers, and were unofficially married in October 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 28&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Berman|2001|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonny brought Cher to Spector, who used her as a [[Backing vocalist|backup singer]] on many of his classic recordings, including [[The Righteous Brothers]]' &quot;[[You've Lost That Loving Feeling]]&quot; and [[The Ronettes]]' &quot;[[Be My Baby]]&quot;, and produced her first single, the unsuccessful &quot;[[Ringo, I Love You]]&quot;, issued under the name '''Bonnie Jo Mason'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 28&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic-overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic |class=artist |id=cher-mn0000107090 |pure_url=yes}} |title=Allmusic &lt;nowiki&gt;&amp;#124;&lt;/nowiki&gt; Cher |last=Eder |first=Bruce |work=Allmusic |publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]] |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1964, Cher emerged with Sonny as a duo, initially called Caesar &amp; Cleo, and cut the singles &quot;The Letter&quot;, &quot;Do You Wanna Dance&quot; and &quot;Love Is Strange&quot;, with little attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic-overview&quot; /&gt;

By the end of 1964, Cher (then known as Cherilyn) was signed to [[Liberty Records]]' [[Imperial Records|Imperial]] imprint, and Sonny came along as producer. Her second solo single, &quot;Dream Baby&quot;, managed to get airplay in Los Angeles, becoming a local hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic-overview&quot; /&gt; Suspecting she was onto something, Cher released in 1965 her debut solo album, ''[[All I Really Want to Do (album)|All I Really Want to Do]]'', which was later described by Tim Sendra of [[Allmusic]] as &quot;one of the stronger folk-pop records of the era&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;All I Really Want to Do Allmusic Review&quot; /&gt; The album reached the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] top 20 and was on the albums charts for six months. The album's cover of the [[Bob Dylan]] song &quot;[[All I Really Want to Do]]&quot; peaked at number 15 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]]. Meanwhile, [[Sonny &amp; Cher]], as they were now known, signed to [[Reprise Records]] and released their first single, &quot;[[Baby Don't Go]]&quot;. The song became a major local hit in Los Angeles (later peaking at number eight on the Hot 100), after which the duo moved from Reprise to the [[Atco Records|Atco]] label, a division of [[Atlantic Records]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic-overview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baby Don't No.8 Hot 100&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100?chartDate=1965-10-09 |title=Hot 100 Songs &amp; New Music: Oct 9, 1965 &amp;#124; Billboard Music Charts Archive |work=Billboard |date=1965-10-09 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their first album, ''[[Look at Us]]'' (1965), spent five weeks at number two on the ''Billboard'' 200 and yielded the single &quot;[[I Got You Babe]]&quot;, which topped the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 chart and became &quot;one of the biggest-selling and most beloved pop/rock hits of the mid-'60s&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic-overview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Look at Us 5 weeks&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bronson|first=Fred|date=1999-02-27|title=Chart Beat: Look at her|journal=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media|location=New York|volume=111|issue=9|page=88|issn=0006-2510|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AQ4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA88|accessdate=2012-10-28|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;I Got No.1 Hot 100&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100?chartDate=1965-08-15 |title=Hot 100 Songs &amp; New Music: Aug 15, 1965 &amp;#124; Billboard Music Charts Archive |work=Billboard |date=1965-08-14 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several more mid-level hits followed, notably &quot;Just You&quot;, &quot;[[But You're Mine]]&quot;, &quot;[[What Now My Love (song)|What Now My Love]]&quot; and &quot;[[Little Man (Sonny &amp; Cher song)|Little Man]]&quot;, before &quot;[[The Beat Goes On]]&quot; returned the duo to the U.S. top ten.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sonny &amp; Cher Billboard Chart History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/sonny-cher/chart-history/105881 |title=Sonny &amp; Cher Album &amp; Song Chart History |work=Billboard |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sonny &amp; Cher charted 11 ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'' top 40 hits between 1965 and 1972, including six top-ten hits, and sold 80 million records worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vanity Fair 2010 Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Krista |last=Smith |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/features/2010/12/cher-201012 |title=Forever Cher |work=Vanity Fair |date=December 2010 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;S&amp;C 80 million&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=They don&amp;#039;t make songs like they used to |url=http://www.virginmedia.com/music/pictures/toptens/60s-stars-where-are-they-now.php?ssid=10 |title=Then: Sonny and Cher - 60s stars - where are they now? |work=Virgin Media |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, they had five songs in the top 20, a feat equaled only by [[Elvis Presley]] and [[The Beatles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cher.com Biography&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cher.com/about-cher/about/ |title=About Cher |work=Cher.com |accessdate=2012-10-28 |first=Josiah |last=Howard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Good Times 3.jpg|thumb|Cher in ''[[Good Times (film)|Good Times]]'' (1967)]]

As the 1960s came to a close, Sonny and Cher's openly monogamous, drug-free lifestyle had become obsolete, thanks to the rise of [[hard rock]], [[psychedelia]], and the drug culture.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoomovies&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 31&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Berman|2001|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, according to Berman, &quot;The heavy, loud sound of groups like [[Jefferson Airplane]] and [[Cream (band)|Cream]] made the folk-rock music of Sonny and Cher seem too bland.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 31&quot; /&gt; In an attempt to recapture their young audience, the duo produced and starred in the film ''[[Good Times (film)|Good Times]]'', in which they were featured in various &quot;silly&quot; skits.

In 1970, Cher co-starred with Sonny in her first television special, ''The Sonny &amp; Cher Nitty Gritty Hour''.

But the image of me in beaded gowns on the cover of the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' was very heavy to fight.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cher Lost Recordings 2&quot; /&gt; By the time of the band's break up, Cher began a successful [[Take Me Home Tour|nightclub act]] in Las Vegas for which she earned US $300,000 a week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 47&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Berman|2001|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981, Cher released the UK top-five hit &quot;[[Dead Ringer for Love]]&quot;, a duet with musician [[Meat Loaf]] which was later described as &quot;one of the more inspired rock duets of the 1980's&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Guarisco |first=Donald A. |url=http://www.allmusic.com/song/dead-ringer-for-love-mt0004520252 |title=Dead Ringer for Love - Meat Loaf |work=AllMusic |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Cher released for [[Columbia Records]] the album ''[[I Paralyze]]'' (1982), which was deemed as her &quot;strongest and most consistent solo album in years&quot; but faced low sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bego 159&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bego|2004|p=159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With album sales and hit singles again at a standstill, Cher decided to expand her career into serious film acting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 49&quot; /&gt; Her earliest entertainment ambitions had always lain in film, as opposed to music;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 21&quot; /&gt; however, she had no films to her credit except the poorly received ''Good Times'' and ''Chastity'', and producers and directors in Hollywood did not take her seriously as an actor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 49&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Berman|2001|p=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, by this time of her career, she was considered &quot;a bit of a joke&quot; and a &quot;has-been&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoomovies&quot; /&gt; In 1982, Cher moved to New York to take acting lessons with [[Lee Strasberg]], founder of the [[Actors Studio]], but she never got to do it.&lt;ref name=&quot;salon.com bio&quot; /&gt; She auditioned for and was signed by director [[Robert Altman]] (whose wife was a friend of Cher's mother) for the Broadway stage production ''[[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (play)|Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean]]''. That same year, she was cast by Altman in [[Come Back to the Five and Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean (film)|the film version]], which earned her a [[Golden Globe]] nomination.&lt;ref name=&quot;hollywoodsongsters-p151&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Parish|Pitts|2003|p=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was next cast alongside [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Kurt Russell]] in the [[Mike Nichols]]' drama ''[[Silkwood]]'', in which she played Streep's lesbian girlfriend and plant coworker. When the film opened in 1983, audiences were skeptical about Cher's ability as an actress. According to biographer Connie Berman, &quot;She has often repeated the story about the audience's reception at a preview that Cher attended. At the beginning of the film, when her name flashed across the screen in the credits, the audience laughed. Cher was devastated. Her sister, who was with her, began to cry. Cher didn't cry, but she was deeply hurt. The preview audience changed its attitude by the end of the film. Hollywood also took notice at last, and so did the critics.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 54&quot; /&gt; For her &quot;intense, unvarnished performance&quot;, Cher received her first Academy Award nomination, as [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]], and won a Golden Globe Award.&lt;ref name=&quot;hollywoodsongsters-p151&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Berman Pg. 54&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Berman|2001|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2000s: Legacy of achievement, touring success ===

In 2000, Cher released an independent album titled ''[[Not.com.mercial]]'', which was written mostly by her after attending a songwriters' conference in 1994. Because the album was quickly rejected by her record label for being &quot;not commercial&quot;, she chose instead to sell it only on her website. Full of personal revelations, &quot;blunt&quot; language and &quot;bleak&quot; content, ''Not.com.mercial'' marked the first time that Cher had written a majority of the material for one of her albums. One song from the album, &quot;Sisters of Mercy&quot;, in which she called the [[Nun#Roman Catholic|Catholic nuns]] who cared for her when she was a child &quot;cruel, heartless and wicked&quot; for keeping her in their orphanage long after her mother attempted to retrieve her, caused controversy among church leaders, who quickly issued denouncements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Deborah |last=Wilker|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2000-11-14/features/0011130180_1_cher-songwriting-record |title='I've Got E, Babe' |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=2000-11-14 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Cher recorded a duet with Italian singer [[Eros Ramazzotti]] called &quot;[[Più che puoi]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Promis |first=Jose F. |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/stilelibero-mw0000620776 |title=Stilelibero - Eros Ramazzotti |work=AllMusic |date=2000-11-07 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2000, Cher made a [[cameo appearance]] on the [[NBC]] sitcom ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'' in the episode &quot;[[Gypsies, Tramps and Weed]]&quot;.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Cher worked in music genres ranging from [[girl group]] ballads to [[Jackie Deshannon]] folk-influenced pop, to [[adult contemporary]] pop.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic-overview&quot; /&gt; Her first album, ''All I Really Want to Do'' (1965), was, like most of her solo work in the 1960s, predominantly folk-rock and based in the songbooks of writers like Bob Dylan, [[Pete Seeger]], DeShannon, and her musical partner Sonny Bono, who produced a large part of her 1960s material.&lt;ref name=&quot;All I Really Want to Do Allmusic Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Sendra |first=Tim |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/all-i-really-want-to-do-mw0000457386 |title=All I Really Want to Do - Cher |work=AllMusic |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joe Viglione of Allmusic wrote that her 1967 album ''With Love, Chér'' &quot;shows why the singer endeared herself to listeners and got to play in the same ballpark as [[Dusty Springfield|Dusty [Springfield&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] and [[Petula Clark|Petula [Clark&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;With Love, Cher Allmusic Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Viglione |first=Joe |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/with-love-cher-mw0000373039 |title=With Love, Cher - Cher |work=AllMusic |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; A song from this album, &quot;You Better Sit Down Kids&quot;, dealt with divorce, an unusual subject for a 1960s pop record, and was one of a series of releases on which Cher's music broached difficult areas such as unwanted pregnancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic-overview&quot; /&gt; While Cher's first albums were &quot;expressive and radiant&quot;, her early-1970s material presented a more adult point of view and personality, as &quot;Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves&quot;.

Viglione wrote that she &quot;never minded [[Androgyny|androgynous]] or neutral gender identity in her songs&quot; and that &quot;her solo material could soar to heights not possible in a partnership&quot; because of her ability to carry both male and female ranges.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves Allmusic Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Viglione |first=Joe |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/gypsys-tramps-thieves-mw0000309635 |title=Gypsys, Tramps &amp; Thieves - Cher |work=AllMusic |date=1971-06-18 |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, Cher cut two [[disco music]] albums: ''Take Me Home'' and ''Prisoner''. The former presented &quot;loud, rhythmic, danceable&quot; beats, while the latter was an autobiographical mix of disco and rock songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;disco music&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Berman|2001|pp=44–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;prisoner bio&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Bego|2004|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her 1980's album ''Black Rose'' contained all-male background singers, guitar work, multilayered keyboards, and an &quot;ass-kicking attitude&quot; in her vocals to cement her new &quot;rock and roll&quot; persona.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bego|2004|p=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by a series of rock albums that had revitalized her pop career: ''Cher'' (1987), ''Heart of Stone'' (1989) and ''Love Hurts'' (1991).&lt;ref name=&quot;Love Hurts Allmusic Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=McCombs |first=Joseph |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/love-hurts-mw0000264020 |title=Love Hurts - Cher |work=AllMusic |accessdate=2012-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those albums shared a distinctive production style, characterized by &quot;stressing&quot; power chords, numerous backup singers, resonant keyboard blasts, and a repertoire of pop rock power ballad songs.

Cher's youthful-looking appearance has long been the subject of intense scrutiny, both by the public and the press. [[Grant McCracken]], author of ''Transformations: Identity Construction in Contemporary Culture'', commented that &quot;Cher has been called the 'poster girl' of plastic surgery.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McCracken&quot; /&gt; He also drew a parallel between her plastic surgeries and the transformations in her career: &quot;There is no public record of when&amp;nbsp;...

Cher's primary philanthropic endeavors have included support of health research and patient quality of life, anti-poverty initiatives, veterans rights, and vulnerable children. After her portrayal of the mother of a boy with a facial skull deformity in the 1985 film ''[[Mask]]'', Cher served as a donor and the National Chairperson and Honorary Spokesperson of the [[Children's Craniofacial Association]], whose mission is to &quot;empower and give hope to facially disfigured children and their families&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;looktothestars&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PRNewswire Tereza&quot; /&gt; She has held that title since 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;looktothestars&quot; /&gt; The annual Cher's Family Retreat is held each June to provide craniofacial patients, their siblings and parents an opportunity to interact with others who have endured similar experiences.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRNewswire Tereza&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/cher-presents-love-sees-no-color-premiere-at-los-angeles-fundraiser-party-59839397.html |title=Cher Presents 'Love Sees No Color' Premiere at Los Angeles Fundraiser Party |publisher=PRNewswire |work=Nassiri |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the years, Cher has often donated concert tickets to families and non-profit groups for children with facial deformities.&lt;ref name=&quot;looktothestars&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.looktothestars.org/celebrity/cher#ixzz2AhVdrxhq |title=Cher's Charity Work, Events and Causes |work=Look to the Stars |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cher also supports and actively promotes Get A-Head Charitable Trust, which aims to improve the quality of life for people with head and neck diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRNewswire Tereza&quot; /&gt;

In 1993, Cher participated in a humanitarian effort in Armenia, taking food and medical supplies to the war-torn region. In 1998, she co-hosted the annual [[amfAR, The Foundation for AIDS Research|American Foundation for AIDS Research]] Benefit at the Cannes Film Festival with [[Elizabeth Taylor]]. She is also the namesake of the Cher Charitable Foundation, which contributes &quot;time and money to charities and causes close to her heart&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;looktothestars&quot; /&gt;

Cher has been a vocal supporter of American soldiers and returning veterans.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRNewswire Tereza&quot; /&gt; She has donated over US $130,000 to Operation Helmet, an organization that provides free helmet upgrade kits to troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;looktothestars&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PRNewswire Tereza&quot; /&gt; Cher has also contributed to the [[Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund]] which serves military personnel who have been disabled in operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and those severely injured in other operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRNewswire Tereza&quot; /&gt; Cher has engaged in the construction of houses with [[Habitat for Humanity]] and served as the Honorary National Chair of a Habitat's elimination of poverty housing initiative &quot;Raise the Roof&quot;, an effort to engage artists in the organization's work while on tour.

In 2007, Cher became the primary supporter of the Peace Village School (PVS) in [[Ukunda]], Kenya, which &quot;provides nutritious food, medical care, education and extracurricular activities for more than 300 orphans and vulnerable children, ages 2 to 13 years.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PRNewswire Tereza&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cher.com/about-cher/love-cher/cher-helps-save-kenyan-school/ |title=Cher Helps Save Kenyan School |work=Cher.com |accessdate=2012-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cher's support enabled the school to acquire land and build permanent housing and school facilities, and in partnership with [[Malaria No More]] and other organizations, she piloted an effort to eliminate [[malaria]] mortality and morbidity for the children, their caregivers and the surrounding community.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRNewswire Tereza&quot; /&gt;

On October 27, 2003, Cher anonymously called a [[C-SPAN]] phone-in program. She recounted a visit she had made to maimed soldiers at the [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center]] and criticized the lack of media coverage and government attention given to injured servicemen. She also remarked that she watches C-SPAN every day. Though she simply identified herself as an unnamed entertainer, she was recognized by the C-SPAN host, who subsequently questioned her about her 1992 support for independent presidential candidate [[Ross Perot]]. She said, &quot;When I heard him talk right in the beginning, I thought that he would bring some sort of common-sense business approach and also less partisianship, but then&amp;nbsp;... I was completely disappointed like everyone else when he just kind of cut and run and no one knew exactly why&amp;nbsp;...

They do what they're told to do. They do it with a really good heart. They do the best they can.

Cher supported [[Hillary Clinton]] in her Presidential campaign: &quot;I like Hillary. I think she'd make the best president. I think &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Barack Obama]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'s a good man. I think he's altruistic. I think he's smart. I think at some point he can be a great leader.
