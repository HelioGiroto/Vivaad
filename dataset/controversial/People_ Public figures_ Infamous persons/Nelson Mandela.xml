{{Apartheid}}
'''Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela''' ({{IPA-xh|xoˈliːɬaɬa manˈdeːla|[[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] pronunciation:}}; born 18 July 1918) is a [[South African people|South African]] [[politician]] who served as [[president of South Africa]] from 1994 to 1999, the first ever to be elected in a [[universal suffrage|fully representative]] democratic election. Before being elected president, Mandela was a militant anti-[[Apartheid in South Africa|apartheid]] activist, and the leader and co-founder of [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]], the armed wing of the [[African National Congress]] (ANC). In 1962 he was arrested and convicted of [[sabotage]] and other charges, and sentenced to life imprisonment. Mandela went on to serve 27 years in prison, spending many of these years on [[Robben Island]]. Following his release from prison on 11 February 1990, Mandela led his party in the negotiations that led to the establishment of democracy in 1994. As president, he frequently gave priority to reconciliation, while introducing policies aimed at combating poverty and inequality in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceri-sciencespo.com/archive/octo99/artmk.pdf |title=Home page &amp;#124; Sciences Po ./ CERI |publisher=Ceri-sciencespo.com |date=2012-10-09 |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1994&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eisa.org.za/WEP/souoverview8.htm |title=EISA South Africa: The presidency of Nelson Mandela (1994-1999) |publisher=Eisa.org.za |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In South Africa, Mandela is often known as '''''Madiba''''', his [[Xhosa clan name]]; or as ''tata'' ({{lang-xh|father}}).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nelsonmandela.org/index.php/memory/views/names/ Madiba’s Many Names] ''Nelson Mandela Foundation''&lt;/ref&gt; Mandela has received [[List of Nelson Mandela awards and honours|more than 250 awards]] over four decades, including the 1993 [[Nobel Peace Prize]].

==Early life==

Nelson Mandela belongs to a [[cadet branch]] of the [[Thembu]] dynasty, which [[reign]]s in the [[Transkei|Transkei region]] of South Africa's [[Eastern Cape Province]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AllAfrica&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200807180124.html|title=South Africa: Celebrating Mandela At 90|date=17 July 2008|publisher=AllAfrica.com|accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was born in [[Mvezo]], a small village located in the district of [[Umtata]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AllAfrica&quot;/&gt; He has [[Khoisan]] ancestry on his mother's side.&lt;ref name=&quot;M-Net&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beta.mnet.co.za/carteblanche/Article.aspx?Id=2619|title=So, where do we come from?|date=19 September 2004|publisher=beta.mnet.co.za|accessdate=11 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[patrilineality|patrilineal]] great-grandfather [[Ngubengcuka]] (who died in 1832), ruled as the ''Inkosi Enkhulu'', or king, of the Thembu people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,316920,00.html|title=Book Review – ''Higher than Hope''|last=Kopkind|first=Andrew|authorlink=Andrew Kopkind|date=16 March 1990 |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the king's sons, named ''Mandela'', became Nelson's grandfather and the source of his surname. However, because he was only the ''Inkosi's'' child by a wife of the Ixhiba [[clan]] (the so-called &quot;Left-Hand House&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mafela&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://epress.anu.edu.au/aborig_history/indigenous_biog/mobile_devices/ch08.html|title=The revelation of African culture in Long Walk to Freedom|last=Mafela|first=Munzhedzi James|date=October 2008|work=Indigenous Biography and Autobiography|publisher=[[Australian National University]]|accessdate=18 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), the descendants of his branch of the royal family were not eligible to [[order of succession#Monarchies and nobility|succeed]] to the Thembu throne.

[[File:Young Mandela.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Nelson Mandela circa 1937&lt;ref&gt;[[#mandela1996|Mandela 1996]], pp. 16, 17&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Mandela's father, [[Gadla Henry Mphakanyiswa]], served as [[Tribal chief|chief]] of the town of Mvezo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Guiloineau  | first = Jean  | last2 = Rowe  | first2 = Joseph  | title = Nelson Mandela: the early life of Rolihlahla Mandiba  | publisher=[[North Atlantic Books]]  | year = 2002  | page = 13  | url = http://books.google.com/?id=4iKSlwuya1YC&amp;pg=PA13  | isbn =1-55643-417-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  However, upon alienating the colonial authorities, they deprived Mphakanyiswa of his position and moved his family to [[Qunu]]. Despite this, Mphakanyiswa remained a member of the ''Inkosi's'' [[Privy Council]] and served an instrumental role in Jongintaba Dalindyebo's ascension to the Thembu throne. Dalindyebo would later return the favour by informally adopting Mandela upon Mphakanyiswa's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;GreatSouls&quot;&gt;[[#Aikman|Aikman (2003)]], pp 70–71&lt;/ref&gt; Mandela's father had four wives, with whom he fathered thirteen children (four boys and nine girls).&lt;ref name=&quot;GreatSouls&quot;/&gt; Mandela was born to his third wife ('third' by a complex royal ranking system), Nosekeni Fanny. Fanny was a daughter of Nkedama of the Mpemvu Xhosa clan, the [[dynasty|dynastic]] Right Hand House, in whose ''umzi'' or [[homestead (small African settlement)|homestead]] Mandela spent much of his childhood.&lt;ref name=port&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.nextreads.com/display2.aspx?recid=126238&amp;FC=1|title=Mandela: The Authorized Portrait|accessdate=26 May 2008|author=Mandela, Nelson|year=2006|page =13|isbn=0-7407-5572-2|publisher=Andrews McMeel Pub|location=Kansas City, Mo.}}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[given name]] ''Rolihlahla'' means &quot;to pull a branch of a tree&quot;, or more colloquially, &quot;troublemaker&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#mandela1996|Mandela 1996]], p.7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=longwalk/&gt;

Rolihlahla Mandela became the first member of his family to attend a school, where his teacher, Miss Mdingane, gave him the English name &quot;Nelson&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[[#mandela1996|Mandela 1996]], p. 9.
&quot;No one in my family had ever attended school [...] On the first day of school my teacher, Miss Mdingane, gave each of us an English name. This was the custom among Africans in those days and was undoubtedly due to the British bias of our education. That day, Miss Mdingane told me that my new name was Nelson. Why this particular name I have no idea.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

When Mandela was nine, his father died of tuberculosis and the [[regent]], Jongintaba, became his [[legal guardian|guardian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GreatSouls&quot;/&gt;  Mandela attended a [[Methodism|Wesleyan]] mission school located next to the palace of the regent. Following Thembu custom, he was initiated at age sixteen and attended Clarkebury Boarding Institute.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC90th&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/7500615.stm|title=Mandela celebrates 90th birthday|date=17 July 2008|publisher=BBC  |accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandela completed his [[Junior Certificate]] in two years, instead of the usual three.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC90th&quot;/&gt; Designated to inherit his father's position as a privy councillor, in 1937 Mandela moved to [[Healdtown Comprehensive School|Healdtown]], the Wesleyan college in [[Fort Beaufort]] which most Thembu [[royal family|royalty]] attended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historicschools.org.za/view.asp?ItemID=1&amp;tname=tblComponent2&amp;oname=Schools&amp;pg=front&amp;subm=Pilot%20Schools|title=Healdtown Comprehensive School|publisher=Historic Schools Project: South Africa|accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At nineteen, he took an interest in boxing and running at the school.&lt;ref name=port/&gt;

After [[matriculation|enrolling]], Mandela began to study for a Bachelor of Arts at the [[Fort Hare University]], where he met [[Oliver Tambo]]. Tambo and Mandela became lifelong friends and colleagues. Mandela also became close friends with his [[kinship and descent|kinsman]], [[Kaiser Matanzima|Kaiser (&quot;K.D.&quot;) Matanzima]] who, as royal [[kinship|scion]] of the Thembu Right Hand House, was in line for the throne of Transkei,&lt;ref name=&quot;mafela&quot;/&gt; a role that would later lead him to embrace [[Bantustan]] policies. His support of these policies would place him and Mandela on opposing political sides.&lt;ref name=port/&gt; At the end of Nelson's first year, he became involved in a [[Students' Representative Council]] boycott against university policies.  He was told to leave [[Fort Hare]] and not return unless he accepted election to the SRC.&lt;ref&gt;[[#mandela1996|Mandela 1996]], pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; Later in his life, while in prison, Mandela studied for a [[Bachelor of Laws]] from the [[University of London External Programme]].

Shortly after leaving Fort Hare, Jongintaba announced to Mandela and Justice (the regent's son and heir to the throne) that he had arranged marriages for both of them. The young men, displeased by the arrangement, elected to relocate to [[Johannesburg]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mandela1996pp10,20&quot;&gt;[[#mandela1996|Mandela 1996]], pp. 10, 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his arrival, Mandela initially found employment as a guard at a mine.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMF&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nelsonmandela.org/index.php/memory/views/biography/|title=Nelson Mandela Biography – Early Years|publisher=Nelson Mandela Foundation|accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the employer quickly terminated Mandela after learning that he was the Regent's runaway [[Ward (law)|ward]]. Mandela later started work as an [[articled clerk]] at a Johannesburg law firm, Witkin, Sidelsky and Edelman, through connections with his friend and mentor, realtor [[Walter Sisulu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NMF&quot;/&gt;  While working at Witkin, Sidelsky and Edelman, Mandela completed his B.A. degree at the [[University of South Africa]] via correspondence, after which he began law studies at the [[University of Witwatersrand]], where he befriended fellow students and future anti-apartheid political activists [[Joe Slovo]], [[Harry Schwarz]] and [[Ruth First]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counter-currents.com/2011/06/nelson-mandela-and-the-jews/ |title=Nelson Mandela and the Jews &amp;#124; Counter-Currents Publishing |publisher=Counter-currents.com |date=03 June 2011 |accessdate=2012-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Slovo would eventually become Mandela's Minister of Housing, while Schwarz would become his [[South African ambassador to the United States|Ambassador to Washington]]. During this time, Mandela lived in [[Alexandra, South Africa|Alexandra]] township, north of Johannesburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmcf.co.za/organize.html|title=[[Nelson Mandela Children's Fund]] – Organise|publisher=Nelson Mandela Children's Fund|accessdate=28 October 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political activity==
After the 1948 election victory of the [[Afrikaner]]-dominated [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]], which supported the [[apartheid]] policy of [[racial segregation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/governence-projects/SA-1948-1976/1948-election.htm|title=The 1948 election and the National Party Victory|publisher=South African History Online|accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mandela began actively participating in politics. He led prominently in the ANC's 1952 [[Defiance Campaign]] and the 1955 [[Congress of the People (1955)|Congress of the People]], whose adoption of the [[Freedom Charter]] provided the fundamental basis of the anti-apartheid cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/struggles/defiance.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080713192018/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/struggles/defiance.html|archivedate=13 July 2008|title=The Defiance Campaign|publisher=African National Congress|accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/campaigns/cop/index.html|title=Congress of the People, 1955|publisher=African National Congress|accessdate=28 October 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080622053030/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/campaigns/cop/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 22 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Mandela and fellow lawyer [[Oliver Tambo]] operated the law firm of [[Mandela and Tambo]], providing free or low-cost legal counsel to many blacks who lacked attorney representation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Callinicos|first=Luli|title=Oliver Tambo: Beyond the Engeli Mountains|publisher=New Africa Books|year=2004|page=173|isbn=0-86486-666-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] influenced Mandela's approach, and subsequently the methods of succeeding generations of South African anti-apartheid activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Mandela, Nelson|title=The Sacred Warrior|work=[[Time 100: The Most Important People of the Century]]|date=31 December 1999|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,993025,00.html | accessdate=30 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Making of a Political Reformer: Gandhi in South Africa, 1893–1914|author=Bhana, Surendra;  Vahed, Goolam|year=2005|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Mandela later took part in the 29–30 January 2007 conference in New Delhi marking the 100th anniversary of Gandhi's introduction of [[satyagraha]] (non-violent resistance) in South Africa).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bhalla, Nita|title=Mandela calls for Gandhi's non-violence approach|agency=Reuters (via ''Mail and Guardian'') | date=29 January 2007 |url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2007-01-29-mandela-calls-for-gandhis-nonviolence-approach | accessdate=30 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially committed to [[nonviolent resistance]], Mandela and 150 others were arrested on 5 December 1956 and charged with treason. The marathon [[Treason Trial]] of 1956–1961 followed, with all defendants receiving [[acquittal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/mandela/1960s/treason.html|title=Nelson Mandela's Testimony at the Treason Trial 1956–60|publisher=African National Congress|accessdate=28 October 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080802140822/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/mandela/1960s/treason.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1952–1959, a new class of black activists known as the Africanists disrupted ANC activities in the townships, demanding more drastic steps against the National Party regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANCStatement&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/misc/trcall.html|title=ANC – Statement to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission|date=August 1996|publisher=African National Congress|accessdate=28 October 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080522154321/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/misc/trcall.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 22 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ANC leadership under [[Albert Luthuli]], [[Oliver Tambo]] and [[Walter Sisulu]] felt not only that the Africanists were moving too fast but also that they challenged their leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANCStatement&quot;/&gt; The ANC leadership consequently bolstered their position through alliances with small White, Coloured, and Indian political parties in an attempt to give the appearance of wider appeal than the Africanists.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANCStatement&quot;/&gt;  The Africanists ridiculed the 1955 [[Freedom Charter]] Kliptown Conference for the concession of the 100,000-strong ANC to just a single vote in a Congressional alliance. Four secretaries-general of the five participating parties secretly belonged to the reconstituted [[South African Communist Party]] (SACP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shillington|first=Kevin|title=Encyclopedia of African History|publisher=CRC Press|year=2005|page=1449|isbn=1-57958-245-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/charter.html|title=The Freedom Charter|publisher=African National Congress|accessdate=28 October 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080703180122/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/charter.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 3 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 [[Blade Nzimande]], the SACP General Secretary, revealed that [[Walter Sisulu]], the ANC Secretary-General, secretly joined the SACP in 1955&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/people/sisulu/condolences/sacp.html SACP Salutes Walter Sisulu&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which meant all five Secretaries General were SACP and thus explains why Sisulu relegated the ANC from a dominant role to one of five equals.

In 1959, the ANC lost its most militant support when most of the Africanists, with financial support from [[Ghana]] and significant political support from the [[Transvaal Province|Transvaal]]-based [[Basotho]], broke away to form the [[Pan Africanist Congress]] (PAC) under the direction of [[Robert Sobukwe]] and [[Potlako Leballo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leeman|first=Bernard|title=The PAC of Azania ''in'' Africa Today|editor=Alexander, Peter; Hutchison, Ruth; Schreuder, Deryck|publisher=The Australian National University Canberra|location=The Humanities Research Centre, The Australian National University Canberra|year=1996|isbn=0-7315-2491-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armed anti-apartheid activities===
In 1961 Mandela became leader of the ANC's armed wing, [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] (translated ''Spear of the Nation'', and also abbreviated ''MK''), which he co-founded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/mk/mk-born.html|title=Umkhonto is Born|publisher=African National Congress|accessdate=28 October 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080507171208/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/mk/mk-born.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 7 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He coordinated sabotage campaigns against military and government targets, making plans for a possible [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] if the sabotage failed to end apartheid.&lt;ref name=&quot;TerrorismReader&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Whittaker|first=David J. |title=The Terrorism Reader|edition=Updated|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|page=244|isbn=0-415-30101-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandela also raised funds for MK abroad and arranged for paramilitary training of the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;TerrorismReader&quot;/&gt;

Fellow ANC member Wolfie Kodesh explains the bombing campaign led by Mandela: &quot;When we knew that we [sic] going to start on 16 December 1961, to blast the symbolic places of apartheid, like pass offices, native magistrates courts, and things like that ... post offices and ... the government offices. But we were to do it in such a way that nobody would be hurt, nobody would get killed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pbsfrontline&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/mandela/revolution/kodesh.html | title=Tell me about the bomb at the brickworks – Frontline The Long Walk of Nelson Mandela | publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandela said of Wolfie: &quot;His knowledge of warfare and his first hand battle experience were extremely helpful to me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;longwalk&quot;/&gt;

Mandela described the move to armed struggle as a last resort; years of increasing repression and violence from the state convinced him that many years of [[non-violence|non-violent]] protest against apartheid had not and could not achieve any progress.&lt;ref name=&quot;longwalk&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Nelson|last=Mandela|title=[[Long Walk to Freedom (book)|Long Walk to Freedom]]|year=1994|publisher=[[Little, Brown and Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rivonia&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author=Mandela, Nelson | title=&quot;I am Prepared to Die&quot; – Nelson Mandela's statement from the dock at the opening of the defence case in the Rivonia Trial | publisher=African National Congress |date=20 April 1964 | url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/mandela/1960s/rivonia.html | accessdate=26 May 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080522154428/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/mandela/1960s/rivonia.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 22 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1961, Mandela sent a letter to South African newspapers warning the government, that if they did not meet their demands, the Umkhonto we Sizwe would embark on a campaign of sabotage. The letter demanded the government accept a call for a national constitutional convention.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;Douglas O. Linder (2010) [http://law2.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/mandela/mandelaaccount.html The Nelson Mandela (Rivonia) Trial: An Account]&lt;/ref&gt; The demands were not met by the government and beginning on 16 December 1961, the Umkhonto we Sizwe with Mandela as its leader, launched a bombing campaign against government targets with the first action of the campaign being the bombing of an electricity sub-station.&lt;ref&gt;Denis Cummings (2011) [http://www.findingdulcinea.com/news/on-this-day/June/Nelson-Mandela-Sentenced-to-Life-in-Prison.html On This Day: Nelson Mandela Sentenced to Life in Prison]. findingDulcinea&lt;/ref&gt; In total, over the next eighteen months, the Umkhonto we Sizwe would initiate dozens more acts of sabotage and bombings. The South African government alleged more acts of sabotage had been carried out and at the Rivonia trial the accused would be charged with 193 acts of sabotage in total.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=73 Umkhonto we Sizwe - timeline]. ANC.org&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign of sabotage against the government included attacks on government posts, machines, power facilities, and crop burning in various places including [[Johannesburg]], [[Port Elizabeth]] and [[Durban]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;/&gt;

Later, mostly in the 1980s, MK, the organisation co-founded by Mandela, waged a guerrilla war against the apartheid government in which many civilians became casualties.&lt;ref name=&quot;TerrorismReader&quot;/&gt; For example, the [[Church Street bombing|Church Street bomb]] in Pretoria killed 19 people and injured 217. After he had become President, Mandela later admitted that the ANC, in its struggle against apartheid, also violated human rights, criticising those in his own party who attempted to remove statements mentioning this from the reports of the [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and Reconciliation Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mandela admits ANC violated rights, too|work=Financial Times |date=2 November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until July 2008 Mandela and ANC party members were barred from entering the United States—except to visit the United Nations headquarters in [[Manhattan]]—without a special waiver from the [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]], because of their South African apartheid-era designation as terrorists.&lt;ref name=bbcvisa&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7340248.stm|title=BBC News: US shamed by Mandela terror link|date=10 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7484517.stm|title=Mandela taken off US terror list|work=BBC News  |date =1 July 2008|accessdate=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest and Rivonia trial===
[[File:Mandela Capture Site.JPG|thumb|Mandela Capture Site near Howick, KwaZulu-Natal]]
{{Main|Rivonia Trial}}
On 5 August 1962 Mandela was arrested after living on the run for seventeen months, and was imprisoned in the Johannesburg Fort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistorychannel.co.uk/site/this_day_in_history/this_day_August_5.php|title=5&amp;nbsp;August – This day in history|publisher=[[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]]|accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of groups have been accused of tipping off the police about Mandela’s whereabouts including the South African Communist Party, Mandela’s host in Durban GR Naidoo, and the CIA, but Mandela himself considers none of these connections to be credible and instead attributes his arrest to his own carelessness in concealing his movements.&lt;ref name=longwalk/&gt; Of the CIA link in particular, Mandela's official biographer Anthony Sampson believes that &quot;the claim cannot be substantiated.&quot;&lt;ref name=sampson/&gt;

Three days later, the charges of leading workers to strike in 1961 and leaving the country illegally were read to him during a court appearance. On 25 October 1962, Mandela was sentenced to five years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2001/feb/11/nelsonmandela.southafrica2|title=The Rivonia Trial|last=Katwala |first=Sunder|date=11 February 2001|work=The Guardian|accessdate=28 October 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Mandela was imprisoned, police arrested prominent ANC leaders on 11 July 1963, at [[Liliesleaf Farm]], [[Rivonia]], north of Johannesburg. Mandela was brought in, and at the [[Rivonia Trial]] they were charged by the chief prosecutor Dr. [[Percy Yutar]] with four charges of the capital crimes of sabotage (which Mandela admitted) and crimes which were equivalent to [[treason]], but easier for the government to prove.&lt;ref name=&quot;SAHistoryOnline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/chronology/thisday/1963-07-11ii.htm|title=ANC Lilliesleaf Farm arrests|date=11 July 1963|publisher=South African History Online|accessdate=28 October 2008}}{{dead link|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/chronology/thisday/1963-07-11ii.htm|date=October 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charge sheet at the trial listed 193 acts of sabotage in total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?id=73 |title=Umkhonto we Sizwe - timeline |publisher=Anc.org.za |date= |accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were charged with the preparation and manufacture of explosives, according to evidence submitted, included 210,000 hand grenades, 48,000 anti-personnel mines, 1,500 time devices, 144 tons of ammonium nitrate, 21.6 tons of aluminum powder and a ton of black powder.&lt;ref&gt;The State v.

In his statement from the dock at the opening of the defence case in the trial on 20 April 1964 at [[Pretoria]] Supreme Court, Mandela laid out the reasoning in the ANC's choice to use violence as a tactic.&lt;ref name=&quot;GuardianMadiba&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/apr/23/nelsonmandela|title=An ideal for which I am prepared to die|last=Mandela|first=Nelson|date=20 April 1964|work=The Guardian|accessdate=28 October 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His statement described how the ANC had used peaceful means to resist apartheid for years until the [[Sharpeville Massacre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeMag&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,869441-1,00.html|title=The Sharpeville Massacre|date=4 April 1960|work=[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]|accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That event coupled with the referendum establishing the Republic of South Africa and the declaration of a [[state of emergency]] along with the banning of the ANC made it clear to Mandela and his compatriots that their only choice was to resist through acts of sabotage and that doing otherwise would have been tantamount to unconditional surrender.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimeMag&quot;/&gt; Mandela went on to explain how they developed the Manifesto of [[Umkhonto we Sizwe]] on 16 December 1961 intent on exposing the failure of the National Party's policies after the economy would be threatened by foreigners' unwillingness to risk investing in the country.&lt;ref name=mk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/manifesto-mk.html|title=Manifesto of Umkhonto we Sizwe|publisher=African National Congress|date=16 December 1961|accessdate=26 May 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080521064728/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/manifesto-mk.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 21 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He closed his statement with these words: &quot;During my lifetime I have dedicated myself to the struggle of the African people. I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination. I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons live together in harmony and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for and to achieve. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rivonia&quot;/&gt;

All except Rusty Bernstein were found guilty, but they escaped the gallows and were sentenced to life imprisonment on 12 June 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANCRivonia&quot;/&gt; Although many saw Mandela as a [[political prisoner]], [[Amnesty International]] did not consider him as the group &quot;rejects the proposal to recognize as prisoners of conscience people who use or advocate the use of force.&quot; However, Amnesty International campaigned against the harsh conditions Mandela experienced while imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnesty.org/en/who-we-are/history The history of Amnesty International].

===Imprisonment===

Mandela was imprisoned on [[Robben Island]] where he remained for the next eighteen of his twenty-seven years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/7671712.stm|title=Mandela's jail overrun by rabbits |date=15 October 2008 |publisher=BBC  |accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in jail, his reputation grew and he became widely known as the most significant black leader in South Africa.&lt;ref name=nobel/&gt; On the island, he and others performed [[Penal labour|hard labour]] in a lime quarry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/a-monument-to-mandela-the-robben-island-years-401137.html|title=A monument to Mandela: the Robben Island years|date=2 September 2007 |work=The Independent |location=UK | publisher=Independent Print Limited|accessdate=28 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prison conditions were very basic.

Whilst in prison Mandela undertook study with the University of London by correspondence through its [[University of London External Programme|External Programme]] and received the degree of [[Bachelor of Laws]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ObserverGM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observer.gm/africa/gambia/article/2008/7/25/the-big-read-nelson-mandela-a-living-legend-1|title=The Big Read: Nelson Mandela: a living legend|date=25 July 2008|work=Daily Observer|accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently nominated for the position of [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] of the University of London in the [[University of London Chancellor election, 1981|1981 election]], but lost to [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ObserverGM&quot;/&gt;

In his 1981 memoir ''Inside BOSS''&lt;ref name=&quot;InsideBOSS&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Winter, Gordon|title=Inside BOSS|publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; secret agent Gordon Winter describes his involvement in a plot to rescue Mandela from prison in 1969: this plot was infiltrated by Winter on behalf of South African intelligence, who wanted Mandela to escape so they could shoot him during recapture. The plot was foiled by Britain's [[Secret Intelligence Service]].&lt;ref name=&quot;InsideBOSS&quot;/&gt;

In March 1982 Mandela was transferred from Robben Island to [[Pollsmoor Prison]], along with other senior ANC leaders Walter Sisulu, Andrew Mlangeni, [[Ahmed Kathrada]] and [[Raymond Mhlaba]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Memoirs&quot;/&gt; It was speculated that this was to remove the influence of these senior leaders on the new generation of young black activists imprisoned on Robben Island, the so-called &quot;Mandela University&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/mandela/index.html|title=Nelson Mandela and the Rainbow of Culture|last=Hallengren|first=Anders|date=11 September 2001|work=Nobelprize.org|publisher=The Nobel Foundation|accessdate=28 October 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080822063757/http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/articles/mandela/index.html|archivedate=22 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] minister [[Kobie Coetsee]] says that the move was to enable discreet contact between them and the South African government.&lt;ref name=sparks/&gt;

In February 1985 President [[P.W.

The first meeting between Mandela and the National Party government came in November 1985 when Kobie Coetsee met Mandela in Volks Hospital in [[Cape Town]] where Mandela was recovering from prostate surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mandela-children.ca/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=109|title=Key Dates in South African History|publisher=Nelson Mandela Children's Fund|accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next four years, a series of tentative meetings took place, laying the groundwork for further contact and future negotiations, but little real progress was made.&lt;ref name=sparks/&gt;

In 1988 Mandela was moved to [[Victor Verster Prison]] and would remain there until his release. Various restrictions were lifted and people such as [[Harry Schwarz]] were able to visit him.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/cgi-bin/getpdf?id=2164009&lt;/ref&gt; Schwarz, a lifelong friend of Mandela, had known him since university when they were in the same law class.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samedia.uovs.ac.za/Imagedir/Image4/1989/026/04205.tif&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a defence barrister at the Rivonia Trial and would become Mandela's ambassador to [[Washington D.C.|Washington]] during his presidency.

Throughout Mandela's imprisonment, local and international pressure mounted on the South African government to release him, under the resounding slogan ''Free Nelson Mandela!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/campaigns/prisoner.html|title=Free Nelson Mandela|date=July 1988|publisher=ANC|accessdate=28 October 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080802140816/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/campaigns/prisoner.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, South Africa reached a crossroads when Botha suffered a stroke and was replaced as president by [[F.

Mandela was visited several times by delegates of the International Committee of the Red Cross, while at Robben Island and later at Pollsmoor prison.

The factors which necessitated the armed struggle still exist today. We have no option but to continue. We express the hope that a climate conducive to a negotiated settlement would be created soon, so that there may no longer be the need for the armed struggle.&quot;

He also said his main focus was to bring peace to the black majority and give them the right to vote in both national and local elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANCSpeech&quot;/&gt;

===Negotiations===
{{Main|Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa}}
Following his release from prison, Mandela returned to the leadership of the ANC and, between 1990 and 1994, led the party in the [[Negotiations to end apartheid in South Africa|multi-party negotiations]] that led to the country's first multi-racial elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sahistory.org.za/pages/library-resources/online%20books/crime-humanity/menu.htm|title=A Crime Against Humanity – Analysing the Repression of the Apartheid State|publisher=South African History Online|accessdate=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the ANC held its first national conference in South Africa after its unbanning, electing Mandela as President of the organisation. His old friend and colleague Oliver Tambo, who had led the organisation in exile during Mandela's imprisonment, became National Chairperson.&lt;ref name=ancprofile&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/people/mandela.html|publisher=African National Congress|title=Profile of Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela|accessdate=8 May 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070505133611/http://www.anc.org.za/people/mandela.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 5 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandela's leadership through the negotiations, as well as his relationship with President [[F. W. de Klerk]], was recognised when they were jointly awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1993. However, the relationship was sometimes strained, particularly so in a sharp exchange in 1991 when he furiously referred to De Klerk as the head of &quot;an illegitimate, discredited, minority regime&quot;. The talks broke down following the [[Boipatong massacre]] in June 1992 when Mandela took the ANC out of the negotiations, accusing De Klerk's government of complicity in the killings.&lt;ref name=boipatong&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/pr/1992/pr0618.html|title=Boipatong Massacre|date=18 June 1992|accessdate=26 May 2008|publisher=African National Congress |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080306075135/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/pr/1992/pr0618.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 6 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, talks resumed following the [[Bisho massacre]] in September 1992, when the spectre of violent confrontation made it clear that negotiations were the only way forward.&lt;ref name=longwalk/&gt;

Mandela said &quot;tonight I am reaching out to every single South African, black and white, from the very depths of my being. A white man, full of prejudice and hate, came to our country and committed a deed so foul that our whole nation now teeters on the brink of disaster. A white woman, of Afrikaner origin, risked her life so that we may know, and bring to justice, this assassin. The cold-blooded murder of Chris Hani has sent shock waves throughout the country and the world. ...Now is the time for all South Africans to stand together against those who, from any quarter, wish to destroy what Chris Hani gave his life for – the freedom of all of us&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/show.php?doc=ancdocs/history/mandela/1993/pr930410.html|title=Statement of the President of the ANC, Nelson Mandela on the assassination of Martin Chris Hani|date=10 April 1993|accessdate=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some riots did follow the assassination, the negotiators were galvanised into action, and soon agreed that democratic elections should take place on 27 April 1994, just over a year after Hani's assassination.&lt;ref name=sparks/&gt;

South Africa's [[South African general election, 1994|first multi-racial elections]] in which full enfranchisement was granted were held on 27 April 1994. The ANC won 62% of the votes in the election, and Mandela, as leader of the ANC, was inaugurated on 10 May 1994 as the country's first black [[President of South Africa|President]], with the National Party's de Klerk as his first [[Deputy President of South Africa|deputy]] and [[Thabo Mbeki]] as the second in the [[Government of National Unity (South Africa)|Government of National Unity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Mandela becomes SA's first black president |publisher=BBC   | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/may/10/newsid_2661000/2661503.stm  | accessdate=26 May 2008 | date=10 May 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; As President from May 1994 until June 1999, Mandela presided over the transition from minority rule and apartheid, winning international respect for his advocacy of national and international reconciliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1993/presentation-speech.html|title=The Nobel Peace Prize 1993 – Presentation Speech|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandela encouraged black South Africans to get behind the previously hated [[South African national rugby union team|''Springboks'']] (the South African national rugby team) as South Africa hosted the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/rugby_world_cup/team_pages/south_africa/3167692.stm|title=Mandela rallies Springboks|date=6 October 2003|publisher=BBC Sport  |accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Springboks won an epic final over New Zealand, Mandela presented the trophy to captain [[Francois Pienaar]], an Afrikaner, wearing a Springbok shirt with Pienaar's own number 6 on the back.

During the course of his presidency, a wide range of progressive social reforms were enacted by Mandela's government, aimed at reducing long entrenched social and economic inequalities in [[South Africa]]. 

Free health care was introduced in 1994 for all children under the age of six together with pregnant and breastfeeding women making use of public sector health facilities (a provision extended to all those using primary level public sector health care services in 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.org.za/depts/ci/pubs/pdf/general/gauge2006/gauge2006_healing.pdf |title=South African Child Gauge 2006 - FINAL.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=15 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Reconstruction and Development Programme]] was lauched, which invested in essential social services such as housing and health care. Increases in welfare spending were carried out, with public spending on welfare and social grants increased by 13% in 1996/97, 13% in 1997/98, and 7% in 1998/99.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;Democracy and governance review: Mandela's legacy 1994-1999 by Yvonne G. Muthien, Meshack M.

The application of the child maintenance grant was extended to blacks in rural areas, who had been previously excluded from the system. A significant increase in public spending on education was carried out, with expenditure raised by 25% in 1996/97, 7% in 1997/98 and 4% in 1998/99.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; In addition, reproductive health services were expanded.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rrojasdatabank.info/policymodel.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Land Restitution Act of 1994 enabled people who had lost their property as a result of the [[Natives Land Act, 1913]] to claim back their land, leading to the settlement of tens of thousands of land claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngopulse.org/article/land-redistribution-case-land-reform-south-africa |title=Land Redistribution: A Case for Land Reform in South Africa |publisher=NGO Pulse |date= |accessdate=2011-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Land Reform Act 3 of 1996 safeguarded the rights of labour tenants who live and grow crops or graze livestock on farms.

President Mandela took a particular interest in helping to resolve the long-running dispute between [[Muammar al-Gaddafi|Gaddafi]]'s Libya, on the one hand, and the United States and Britain on the other, over bringing to trial the two Libyans who were indicted in November 1991 and accused of sabotaging [[Pan Am Flight 103]], which crashed at the Scottish town of [[Lockerbie]] on 21 December 1988, with the loss of 270 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/jan/31/lockerbie.derekbrown|title=Lockerbie trial: what happened when|last=Brown|first=Derek|date=31 January 2001|work=The Guardian|accessdate=28 October 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1992, Mandela informally approached President [[George H.W.

Later the same year, at the [[Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 1997|1997 Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting]] (CHOGM) at [[Edinburgh]] in October 1997, Mandela warned:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;No one nation should be [[complainant]], [[prosecutor]] and judge.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A compromise solution was then agreed for a trial to be held at [[Camp Zeist, Netherlands|Camp Zeist]] in the Netherlands, governed by [[Scots law]], and President Mandela began negotiations with Colonel [[Muammar al-Gaddafi|Gaddafi]] for the handover of the two accused ([[Abdelbaset al-Megrahi|Megrahi]] and [[Lamin Khalifah Fhimah|Fhimah]]) in April 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/1144147.stm | title=Analysis: Lockerbie's long road |publisher=BBC  |accessdate=26 May 2008 | date=31 January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of their nine-month trial, the verdict was announced on 31 January 2001.

Their first daughter died aged nine months, and they named [[Makaziwe Mandela|their second daughter]] in her honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/blackhistory/nelson-mandela.jsp|title=Nelson Mandela Biography – Black History|publisher=Biography.com|accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; All their children were educated at the [[United World College]] of [[Waterford Kamhlaba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwc.org/about_us/international_movement/presidents_and_patrons|title=UWC – Presidents and Patrons|publisher=[[United World Colleges]]|accessdate=28 October 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080518175724/http://www.uwc.org/about_us/international_movement/presidents_and_patrons|archivedate=18 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thembi was killed in a car crash in 1969 at the age of 23, while Mandela was imprisoned on Robben Island, and Mandela was not allowed to attend the funeral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Charlene |coauthors=Tutu, Desmond |title=Mandela: In Celebration of a Great Life|publisher=Struik|year=2004|page=41|isbn=1-86872-828-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Makgatho died of AIDS in 2005, aged 54.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | last = Timberg  | first = Craig  | title = Mandela Says AIDS Led to Death of Son  | newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]  | publisher=[[The Washington Post Company]]  | date = 7 January 2005  | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52781-2005Jan6.html  | accessdate =16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second marriage===
Mandela's second wife, [[Winnie Madikizela-Mandela]], also came from the Transkei area, although they, too, met in Johannesburg, where she was the city's first black social worker.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANCWinnie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anc.org.za/people/mandela_nw.html|title=Winnie Mandela|publisher=ANC|accessdate=27 October 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080722092427/http://www.anc.org.za/people/mandela_nw.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 22 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They had two daughters, Zenani (Zeni), born 4 February 1958, and Zindziswa (Zindzi) Mandela-Hlongwane, born 1960.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANCWinnie&quot;/&gt; Zindzi was only 18 months old when her father was sent to Robben island. Later, Winnie would be deeply torn by family discord which mirrored the country's political strife; while her husband was serving a [[Life imprisonment|life sentence]] in the Robben Island prison, her father became the agriculture minister in the Transkei.&lt;ref name=&quot;ANCWinnie&quot;/&gt; The marriage ended in separation (April 1992) and divorce (March 1996), fueled by political estrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-18170308.html|title=Nelson and Winnie Mandela divorce; Winnie fails to win $5&amp;nbsp;million settlement |date=8 April 1996|publisher=Jet|accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandela was still in prison when his daughter Zenani was married to [[House of Dlamini|Prince Thumbumuzi Dlamini]] in 1973, elder brother of King [[Mswati III of Swaziland|Mswati III]] of [[Swaziland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://main.wgbh.org/ton/programs/5069_01.html|title=Swaziland prince and princess attend Boston University|date=13 May 1987|publisher=WGBH Boston|accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although she had vivid memories of her father, from the age of four up until sixteen, South African authorities did not permit her to visit him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1353217.html|title=Daddy Stayed In Jail.

In July 2012, Zenani was appointed ambassador to Argentina, becoming the first of Mandela's three remaining children to enter public life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-18703172 | title=Zenani Mandela | date= 4July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Zindzi Mandela-Hlongwane made history worldwide when she read out Mandela's speech refusing his conditional pardon in 1985. She is a businesswoman in South Africa with three children, the eldest of whom is a son, Zondwa Gadaffi Mandela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://auroraempowerment.com/mandela.html|title=Zondwa Gadaffi Mandela  |publisher=Aurora Empowerment Systems|accessdate=20 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third marriage===
Mandela was remarried, on his 80th birthday in 1998, to [[Graça Machel]] ''née'' Simbine, widow of [[Samora Machel]], the former [[Mozambique|Mozambican]] president and ANC ally who was killed in an air crash 12&amp;nbsp;years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/africa/9807/18/mandela.wedding.02/|title=Mandela gets married on 80th birthday|date=18 July 1998|publisher=CNN|accessdate=27 October 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080614111828/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/africa/9807/18/mandela.wedding.02/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 14 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The wedding followed months of international negotiations to set the unprecedented [[bride price]] to be remitted to Machel's clan. Said negotiations were conducted on Mandela's behalf by his traditional sovereign, King Buyelekhaya Zwelibanzi Dalindyebo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/2007/10/09/Easterncape/aking.html|title=andela, Kaunda honour king|last=Ngcukana|first=Lubabalo|work=Daily Dispatch|accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[paramount chief]]'s grandfather was the regent Jongintaba Dalindyebo, who had arranged a marriage for Mandela, which he eluded by fleeing to [[Johannesburg]] in 1940.&lt;ref name=&quot;mandela1996pp10,20&quot; /&gt;

Mandela still maintains a home at Qunu in the realm of his royal nephew (second cousin thrice-removed in Western reckoning), whose university expenses he defrayed and whose privy councillor he remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.see.org.za/xsite/workshop_report1.htm | title=Zuidelijk Afrika | accessdate=26 May 2008 | last=de Bruyne | first=Marnix | publisher=Netherlands Institute for Southern Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement==
Mandela became the oldest elected President of South Africa when he took office at the age of 75 in 1994. He decided not to stand for a second term and retired in 1999, to be succeeded by [[Thabo Mbeki]].

After his retirement as President, Mandela went on to become an advocate for a variety of social and human rights organisations. He has expressed his support for the international [[Make Poverty History]] movement of which the [[ONE Campaign]] is a part.&lt;ref name=povertyhistory&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.makepovertyhistory.org/theyearof | title=2005: The year of Make Poverty History | publisher=Make Poverty History | accessdate=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nelson Mandela Invitational]] charity golf tournament, hosted by [[Gary Player]], has raised over twenty million [[South African rand|rand]] for children's charities since its inception in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;MandelaInv&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nelsonmandelainvitational.co.za/default.asp?id=227875&amp;des=article|title=SA's best to join international stars for charity|date=5 September 2007|publisher=Nelson Mandela Invitational|accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This annual special event has become South Africa's most successful charitable sports gathering and benefits both the Nelson Mandela Children's Fund and Gary Player Foundation equally for various children's causes around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://garyplayer.com/news/news_detail/nelson_mandela_invitational_tees_off/|title=Nelson Mandela Invitational Tees Off|date=14 November 2003 |publisher=GaryPlayer.com|accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandela is a vocal supporter of [[SOS Children's Villages]], the world's largest organisation dedicated to raising orphaned and abandoned children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sos-childrensvillages.org/Get-involved/Celebrities-as-partners/Pages/Nelson-Mandela.aspx|title=Nelson Mandela|publisher=SOS Children's Villages|accessdate=1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandela appeared in a televised advertisement for the [[2006 Winter Olympics]], and was quoted for the [[International Olympic Committee]]'s ''Celebrate Humanity'' campaign:&lt;ref name=ioc&gt;{{cite web | url=http://multimedia.olympic.org/pdf/en_report_902.pdf | publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]] | format=PDF | title=Celebrate Humanity 2004 | year=2004 | accessdate=1 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
For seventeen days, they are roommates.
For seventeen days, they are soulmates.
And for twenty-two seconds, they are competitors.
Seventeen days as equals. Twenty-two seconds as adversaries.
What a wonderful world that would be.
That's the hope I see in the Olympic Games.
}}

Three organisations associated with Mandela have been established: the [[Nelson Mandela Foundation]], the [[Nelson Mandela Children's Fund]], and the [[Mandela Rhodes Scholarship|Mandela Rhodes Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nelsonmandela.org/index.php/foundation/about/ About The Foundation]''Nelson Mandela Foundation''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-retirement health===
In July 2001 Mandela was diagnosed and treated for [[prostate cancer]]. He was treated with a seven-week course of radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC   | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/1492865.stm | title=Mandela 'responding well to treatment' | date=15 August 2001|accessdate=26 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Mandela's death was [[List of premature obituaries|incorrectly announced]] by CNN when his pre-written obituary (along with those of several other famous figures) was inadvertently published on CNN's web site due to a fault in password protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/cnnobit1.html | title=The Smoking Gun: Archive | year=2003 | accessdate=1 May 2007|publisher=[[The Smoking Gun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 a fringe right-wing group distributed hoax email and SMS messages claiming that the authorities had covered up Mandela's death and that white South Africans would be massacred after his funeral. Mandela was on holiday in Mozambique at the time.&lt;ref name=hoaxdeath&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=300707&amp;area=/insight/insight__national | title=Not yet uhuru | author=Groenewald, Yolandi;  Joubert, Pearlie | work=[[Mail &amp; Guardian]] | date=2 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2004, at age 85, Mandela announced that he would be retiring from public life. His health had been declining, and he wanted to enjoy more time with his family. Mandela said that he did not intend to hide away totally from the public, but wanted to be in a position &quot;of calling you to ask whether I would be welcome, rather than being called upon to do things and participate in events. My appeal therefore is: Don't call me, I will call you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=I'll call you | publisher=SouthAfrica.info | date=2 June 2004 | url=http://www.southafrica.info/mandela/mandela-retirement.htm | accessdate=26 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2003, he has appeared in public less often and has been less vocal on topical issues.&lt;ref name=retirement/&gt;  He is white-haired and walks slowly with the support of a stick. There are reports that he may be suffering from age-related dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who2.com/blog/2009/12/is-nelson-mandela-losing-his-memory.html|title=Is Nelson Mandela Losing His Memory?|publisher=Who2.com|date=7 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandela's 90th birthday was marked across the country on 18 July 2008, with the main celebrations held at his home town of Qunu.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOXNews&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,385561,00.html|title=Nelson Mandela Celebrates 90th Birthday by Urging Rich to Help Poor|date= 18 July 2008|publisher=[[Fox News Channel|Fox News]]|accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Nelson Mandela 90th Birthday Tribute|concert in his honour]] was also held in [[Hyde Park, London]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/hyde-park-concert-to-mark--mandelas-90th-821776.html|title=Hyde Park concert to mark Mandela's 90th|last=Bingham|first=John|date=6 May 2008|work=The Independent| publisher=Independent Print Limited|accessdate=27 October 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech to mark his birthday, Mandela called for the rich people to help poor people across the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;FOXNews&quot;/&gt; Despite maintaining a low-profile during the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa, Mandela made a rare public appearance during the closing ceremony, where he received a &quot;rapturous reception.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/jul/11/nelson-mandela-world-cup-final | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Nelson Mandela attends World Cup closing ceremony | date=11 July 2010 | first=David | last=Batty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, he was admitted to the private [[Milpark Hospital]] in Johannesburg, for what were at the time described as &quot;routine tests&quot; by his foundation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/29/world/africa/29safrica.html?partner=rss&amp;emc=rss|title=Nelson Mandela Returns Home From Hospital|last=Dugger|first=Celia|date=18 January 2011|work=The New York Times |accessdate=30 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to intense media speculation about the health condition of the increasingly frail Mandela.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/south-africa/gauteng/tell-us-what-s-going-on-editors-1.1018115|title='Tell us what's going on' – Editors|date=28 January|publisher=IoL|accessdate=30 January}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later emerged that he had been suffering from a [[respiratory infection]], which had responded well to treatment. He was discharged after two and a half days in hospital in a stable condition, and returned to his [[Houghton Estate|Houghton]], Johannesburg home in an ambulance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/SouthAfrica/News/Nelson-Mandela-breathing-on-his-own-20110128|title=Nelson Mandela 'breathing on his own'|date=18 January|publisher=News 24|accessdate=30 January}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elders===
On 18 July 2007, Mandela, [[Graça Machel]], and [[Desmond Tutu]] convened a group of world leaders in Johannesburg to contribute their wisdom and independent leadership to address the world's toughest problems. Mandela announced the formation of this new group, [[Global Elders|The Elders]], in a speech he delivered on the occasion of his 89th birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19836050 | title=Mandela joins 'Elders' on turning 89 | publisher=[[MSNBC]]|accessdate=26 May 2008 | date=20 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archbishop Tutu serves as the chair of The Elders. The founding members of this group also include Graça Machel, [[Kofi Annan]], [[Ela Bhatt]], [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]], [[Jimmy Carter]], [[Li Zhaoxing]], [[Mary Robinson]] and [[Muhammad Yunus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.southafrica.info/mandela/theelders.htm|title=Mandela launches The Elders|date=19 July 2007 |publisher=SAinfo|accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;This group can speak freely and boldly, working both publicly and behind the scenes on whatever actions need to be taken&quot;, Mandela commented.  &quot;Together we will work to support courage where there is fear, foster agreement where there is conflict, and inspire hope where there is despair.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=26 May 2008|url=http://www.theelders.org/transcript.aspx|title=Nelson Mandela announces The Elders|publisher=The Elders|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080420045636/http://www.theelders.org/transcript.aspx|archivedate=20 April 2008}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

===AIDS engagement===
Since his retirement, one of Mandela's primary commitments has been to the fight against AIDS. He gave the closing address at the [[XIII International AIDS Conference, 2000|XIII International AIDS Conference]] in 2000, in Durban, South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Tebas, MD, &quot;Closing Ceremony,&quot; http://www.thebody.com/content/art16140.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, he had already lent his support to the [[46664 (concerts)|46664]] AIDS fundraising campaign, named after his prison number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.46664.com/2|title=About 46664|publisher=46664.com|accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2004, he flew to [[Bangkok]] to speak at the [[XV International AIDS Conference, 2004|XV International AIDS Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kaisernetwork.org/aids2004/kffsyndication.asp?show=portal_071504.html|title=XV International AIDS Conference – Daily Coverage|date=15 July 2004|publisher=Kaisernetwork|accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His son, [[Makgatho Mandela]], died of AIDS on 6 January 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/4151159.stm|title=Mandela's eldest son dies of Aids|date=6 January 2005|publisher=BBC  |accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mandela's AIDS activism is chronicled in [[Stephanie Nolen]]'s book, ''[[28 (book)|28: Stories of AIDS in Africa]]''.

===Criticism of US and UK foreign policy===
Nelson Mandela had strongly opposed the 1999 [[War in Kosovo|NATO intervention in Kosovo]] and called it an attempt by the world's powerful nations to police the entire world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/iraq/doc/mandela1.html |title=Equipo Nizkor – Mandela slams Western action in Kosovo, Iraq |publisher=Derechos.org |accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2002 and 2003, Mandela criticised the foreign policy of the [[George W. Bush administration|administration]] of US president [[George W. Bush]] in a number of speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2228971.stm|title=Mandela warns Bush over Iraq|date=1 September 2002|publisher=BBC  |accessdate=27 October 2008 | first=John | last=Pienaar}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/mandela-lambastes-arrogant-bush-over-iraq-609026.html|title=Mandela lambastes 'arrogant' Bush over Iraq|last=Cornwell|first=Rupert |date=31 January 2003|work=The Independent| publisher=Independent Print Limited|accessdate=27 October 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Criticising the lack of UN involvement in the decision to begin the [[War in Iraq]], he said, &quot;It is a tragedy, what is happening, what Bush is doing. But Bush is now undermining the United Nations.&quot; Mandela stated he would support action against [[Iraq]] only if it is ordered by the UN. Mandela also insinuated that the United States may have been motivated by racism in not following the UN and its secretary-general [[Kofi Annan]] on the issue of the war. &quot;Is it because the secretary-general of the United Nations is now a black man? They never did that when secretary-generals [''sic''&lt;!-- should have been secretaries-general --&gt;] were white&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS30012003&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Fenton, Tom | publisher=[[CBS]] | title=Mandela Slams Bush On Iraq | date=30 January 2003 | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/30/iraq/main538607.shtml | accessdate=26 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; General [[Colin Powell]], the first of two African-Americans appointed by Bush to the position of US Secretary of State, presented to the United Nations Assembly the case for the war in Iraq and overthrow of Saddam Hussein.

Mandela urged the people of the US to join massive protests against Bush and called on world leaders, especially those with vetoes in the [[UN Security Council]], to oppose him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/01/30/iraq/main538607.shtml|title=Mandela Slams Bush On Iraq|date=30 January 2003|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;What I am condemning is that one power, with a president who has no foresight, who cannot think properly, is now wanting to plunge the world into a holocaust.&quot; He attacked the United States for its record on [[human rights]] and for dropping [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|atomic bombs on Japan]] during World War II. &quot;If there is a country that has committed unspeakable atrocities in the world, it is the United States of America. They don't care.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS30012003&quot;/&gt; Nelson Mandela also harshly condemned British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] and referred to him as the &quot;foreign minister of the United States&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.derechos.org/nizkor/iraq/doc/mandela2.html |title=Equipo Nizkor – Angry Mandela attacks Warmonger Blair |publisher=Derechos.org |accessdate=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandela, and Kofi Annan, also strongly criticised George W Bush’s [[PEPFAR]] initiative at an international AIDS conference in 2004.

===Ismail Ayob controversy===
{{Further|Ismail Ayob}}
[[Ismail Ayob]] was a trusted friend and personal attorney of Mandela for over 30&amp;nbsp;years. In May 2005, Ayob was asked by Mandela to stop selling [[printmaking|prints]] signed by Mandela and to account for the proceeds of their sale. This bitter dispute led to an extensive application to the [[High Court of South Africa]] by Mandela that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=Mail &amp; Guardian | title=Mandela sues over forged sketches | author=Chanda, Abhik Kumar | date=10 May 2005 | url=http://www.mg.co.za/articledirect.aspx?articleid=237663|accessdate=26 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayob denied any wrongdoing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/specialreports.aspx?ID=BD4A67853 | publisher=Business Day | date=13 July 2005 | title=Ayob denies gain from Mandela art | first=Ernest | last=Mabuza|accessdate=26 May 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080331212824/http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/specialreports.aspx?ID=BD4A67853|archivedate=31 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed that he was the victim of a smear campaign orchestrated by Mandela's advisors, in particular, lawyer [[George Bizos]].&lt;ref name=poorismail&gt;{{cite news|title=Poor Ismail Ayob|first=Fikile-Notsikelelo|last=Moya|date=5 August 2005|work=Mail &amp; Guardian|url=http://www.mg.co.za/articlePage.aspx?articleid=247331&amp;area=/insight/insight__comment_and_analysis/|accessdate=26 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 and 2006, Ayob, his wife, and son were subjected to a verbal attack by Mandela's advisors. The dispute was widely reported in the media, with Ayob being portrayed in a negative light, culminating in the action by Mandela to the High Court. There were public meetings at which Mandela associates attacked Ayob and there were calls for Ayob and his family to be ostracised by society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/specialreports.aspx?ID=BD4A71659|date=21 July 2005|title=Courts 'have final word on Mandela-Ayob clash'|first=Jacques|last=Keet|publisher=Business Day|accessdate=26 May 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080107214205/http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/specialreports.aspx?ID=BD4A71659|archivedate=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The defence of Ismail and Zamila Ayob (his wife, and a fellow [[respondent]]) included documents signed by Mandela and witnessed by his secretaries, that, they claimed, refuted many of the allegations made by Nelson Mandela and his advisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/specialreports.aspx?ID=BD4A70054|date=18 July 2005|title=Bizos behind vicious campaign to discredit, defame me – Ayob|first=Ernest|last=Mabuza|publisher=Business Day|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080331195835/http://www.businessday.co.za/articles/specialreports.aspx?ID=BD4A70054|archivedate=31 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dispute again made headlines in February 2007 when, during a hearing in the Johannesburg High Court, Ayob promised to pay R700 000 to Mandela, which Ayob had transferred into trusts for Mandela's children, and apologised,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,9294,2-7-1442_2075833,00.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080627111956/http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/News/0,9294,2-7-1442_2075833,00.html|archivedate=27 June 2008|title=Ayob to pay back Mandela money|date=27 February 2007|publisher=[[News24]]|accessdate=26 May 2008}}

====Allegations====
Ayob, George Bizos and Wim Trengove were trustees of the Nelson Mandela Trust, which was set up to hold millions of rands donated to Nelson Mandela by prominent business figures, including the [[Nicky Oppenheimer|Oppenheimer]] family, for the benefit of his children and grandchildren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2007-02-25-mandelas-lawyers-take-ismail-to-court-over-money|title=Mandela's lawyers take Ismail to court over money|date=25 February 2007 |work=Mail &amp; Guardian|accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayob later resigned from the Trust. In 2006, the two remaining trustees of the Nelson Mandela Trust launched an application against Ayob for disbursing money from the trust without their consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/City_Press/News/0,7515,186-187_2078129,00.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080627111944/http://www.news24.com/City_Press/News/0,7515,186-187_2078129,00.html|archivedate=27 June 2008|date=3 March 2007|title=Madiba set me up, says Ayob|author=Sefara, Makhudu;  Mapiloko, Jackie|publisher=[[News24]]|accessdate=26 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ayob claimed that this money was paid to the [[South African Revenue Service]], to Mandela's children and grandchildren, to Mandela himself, and to an accounting company for four years of accounting work.&lt;ref name=whatcaused/&gt;

Bizos and Trengrove refused to ratify the payments to the children and grandchildren of Nelson Mandela and the payments to the accounting firm. A court settlement was reached in which this money, totalling over R700,000 was paid by Ismail Ayob to the trust on the grounds that Ayob had not sought the express consent of the other two trustees before disbursing the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=13&amp;art_id=vn20060708085708263C605474|title='Ayob tried to cover up unlawful spending' |last=Adams |first=Sheena |date=8 July 2006|publisher=IOL|accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was alleged that Ayob made defamatory remarks about Mandela in his affidavit, for which the court order stated that Ayob should apologise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-159966227.html|title=Lawyer to pay back R800000 to Mandela trust|last=Mkhwanazi |first=Siyabonga|date=28 February 2007|publisher=Pretoria News (South Africa)|accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was pointed out that these remarks, which centred on Nelson Mandela holding foreign bank accounts and not paying tax on these, had not originated from Ayob's affidavit but from Nelson Mandela's and George Bizos's own affidavits.&lt;ref name=ismailnocash&gt;{{cite news|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200703100051.html|title=Ayob Runs Out of Cash But Accuses Mandela Again|publisher=Business Day|date=10 March 2007|first=Ernest|last=Mabuza|accessdate=26 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood Diamond controversy===
In a ''[[The New Republic]]'' article in December 2006, Nelson Mandela was criticised for a number of positive comments he had made about the diamond industry. There were concerns that this would benefit suppliers of [[blood diamond]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jckonline.com/article/CA6346260.html|title=Nelson Mandela to speak out for diamond industry|last=Bates|first=Rob|date=22 June 2006|publisher=Jewelers' Circular Keystone|accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to [[Edward Zwick]], the director of the motion picture ''[[Blood Diamond (film)|Blood Diamond]]'', Mandela had noted that:

{{quote|...it would be deeply regrettable if the making of the film inadvertently obscured the truth, and, as a result, led the world to believe that an appropriate response might be to cease buying mined diamonds from Africa. ... We hope that the desire to tell a gripping and important real life historical story will not result in the destabilisation of African diamond producing countries, and ultimately their peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20061218&amp;s=chotiner121806|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070308142504/http://www.tnr.com/doc.mhtml?i=20061218&amp;s=chotiner121806|archivedate=8&amp;nbsp;March 2007 |title=Half Nelson – Mandela, diamond shill|work=[[The New Republic]]|date=8 December 2006|accessdate=26 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The ''New Republic'' article claims that this comment, as well as various pro-diamond-industry initiatives and statements during his life and during his time as a president of South Africa, were influenced by both his friendship with [[Harry Oppenheimer]], former chairman of [[De Beers]], as well as an outlook for 'narrow national interests' of South Africa (which is a major diamond producer).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/thedishrag/2006/06/mandela-to-defe.html|title=Mandela to defend De Beers from bad &quot;Blood&quot;|last= Snead|first=Elizabeth|date=15 June 2006|work=LA Times|accessdate=27 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zimbabwe and Robert Mugabe===
[[Robert Mugabe]], the president of [[Zimbabwe]] who has led the country since independence in 1980, has been widely criticised internationally for the 1980s [[Gukurahundi|fighting which killed tens of thousands of people]] as well as corruption, incompetent administration, political oppression and [[cronyism]] that has ultimately led to the economic collapse of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thezimbabwetimes.com/?p=97|title=Gukurahundi and current wave of violence similar|last=Chimuka|first=Garikai|date=14 May 2008|work=The Zimbabwe Times|accessdate=26 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/1709488.stm|title=Mugabe's descent into dictatorship|last= Winter|first=Joseph|date=13 March 2002|publisher=BBC  |accessdate=26 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandela and Mugabe were seldom seen as close. Mandela criticised Mugabe in 2000, referring to African leaders who had liberated their countries but had then overstayed their welcome.&lt;ref name=mugabe&gt;{{cite news|title=Mandela expresses anger at Mugabe

Mugabe did not respond to this approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/Zimbabwe/0,,2-11-1662_2214253,00.html|title=Mugabe snubs Mandela|date=5 November 2007|publisher=News24|accessdate=16 June 2010}}{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2008, at the height of the crisis over the [[Zimbabwean presidential election, 2008|Zimbabwean presidential election]], Mandela condemned the &quot;tragic failure of leadership&quot; in Zimbabwe.&lt;ref name=zimfailure&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/Zimbabwe/0,,2-11-1662_2347143,00.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080803034209/http://www.news24.com/News24/Africa/Zimbabwe/0,,2-11-1662_2347143,00.html|archivedate=3 August 2008|title=Failure of leadership in Zim – Mandela|publisher=News24|date=25 June 2008|accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example of his popular foreign acclaim, during his tour of Canada in 1998, 45,000 school children greeted him with adulation at a speaking engagement in the [[Rogers Centre|SkyDome]] in the city of Toronto.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rooneyproductions.com/events/m_child.htm |title=Mandela and the Children |publisher=Rooney Productions |accessdate=26 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he was the first living person to be made an [[Honorary Citizenship of Canada|honorary Canadian citizen]] (the only previous recipient, [[Raoul Wallenberg]], was awarded honorary citizenship posthumously).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2001/11/19/mandela_011119.html|title=Mandela to be honoured with Canadian citizenship|date=19 November 2001 |publisher=CBC News|accessdate=26 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While in Canada, he was also made an honorary Companion of the [[Order of Canada]], one of the few foreigners to receive the honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gg.ca/honours/search-recherche/honours-desc.asp?TypeID=orc&amp;id=3904&amp;lang=e |title=Order of Canada – Nelson Mandela, C.C |publisher=Governor General of Canada |accessdate=26 October 2008}}{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musical tributes===
Many artists have dedicated songs to Mandela. One of the most popular was from [[The Special AKA]] who recorded the song &quot;[[Free Nelson Mandela]]&quot; in 1983. [[Stevie Wonder]] dedicated his 1985 [[Academy Award for Best Original Song|Oscar]] for the song &quot;[[I Just Called to Say I Love You]]&quot; to Mandela, resulting in his music being banned by the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]].&lt;ref name=wonder&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E4DD1438F934A15750C0A963948260 |title=Stevie Wonder Music Banned in South Africa |date=27 March 1985 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=26 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, [[Youssou N'Dour]]'s album ''Nelson Mandela'' was the [[Senegal]]ese artist's first United States release.

In 1988, the [[Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute]] concert at London's [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] was a focal point of the anti-apartheid movement, with many musicians voicing their support for Mandela.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mandela70&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/mandela/awards/wembley88.html |title=The Mandela Concert, Wembley 1988 |last=Ketchum |first=Mike |publisher=African National Congress |accessdate=23 December 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080709063908/http://www.anc.org.za/ancdocs/history/mandela/awards/wembley88.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerry Dammers]], the author of ''Nelson Mandela'', was one of the organisers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mandela70&quot;/&gt; [[Simple Minds]] wrote and performed the song &quot;Mandela Day&quot; for the concert (it would appear on their next album six months later),&lt;ref name=&quot;Mandela70&quot;/&gt; [[Santana (band)|Santana]] recorded the instrumental &quot;Mandela&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mandela70&quot;/&gt; [[Tracy Chapman]] performed &quot;Freedom Now&quot;, dedicated to Mandela and released on her album ''[[Crossroads (Tracy Chapman album)|Crossroads]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Mandela70&quot;/&gt; [[Salif Keita]] from [[Mali]], who played at the concert, later visited South Africa and in 1995 recorded the song &quot;Mandela&quot; on his album ''[[Folon]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mandela70&quot;/&gt; and [[Whitney Houston]] performed and dedicated the gospel song &quot;He I Believe&quot;.

===Published biographies===
Mandela's autobiography, ''[[Long Walk to Freedom (book)|Long Walk to Freedom]]'', was published in 1994, an extended version of ''No Easy Walk to Freedom'', published by Heinemann in 1965. Mandela had begun work on it secretly while in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[[#mandela1996|Mandela 1996]], p. 144-148.&lt;/ref&gt; In that book Mandela did not reveal anything about the alleged complicity of [[F. W. de Klerk]] in the violence of the eighties and nineties, or the role of his ex-wife [[Winnie Mandela]] in that bloodshed. However, he later co-operated with his friend, journalist [[Anthony Sampson]] who discussed those issues in ''[[Mandela: The Authorised Biography]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/1999/aug1999/mand-a05.shtml |title=Biography falls short of penetrating myth surrounding ANC leader |last=Ann |first=Talbot |date=5 August 1999 |publisher=International Committee of the Fourth International (ICFI)|accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another detail that Mandela omitted was the allegedly fraudulent book, ''[[Goodbye Bafana]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewStatesman&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/film/2007/05/goodbye-bafana-mandela-life |title=Whitewashed and watered down |last= Gilbey |first=Ryan |date=14 May 2007 |work=New Statesman |location=UK |accessdate=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its author, Robben Island warder [[James Gregory (writer)|James Gregory]], claimed to have been Mandela's confidant in prison and published details of the prisoner's family affairs.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewStatesman&quot;/&gt; Sampson maintained that Mandela had not known Gregory well, but that Gregory censored the letters sent to the future president and thus discovered the details of Mandela's personal life. Sampson also averred that other warders suspected Gregory of spying for the government and that Mandela considered suing Gregory.&lt;ref name=sampson&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Mandela: The Authorised Biography]] |first=Anthony |last=Sampson |authorlink=Anthony Sampson |page=217 |year=1999 |publisher=[[HarperCollins]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cinema and television===
The film ''Mandela and De Klerk'' told the story of Mandela's release from prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/161621/Mandela-and-de-Klerk/overview |title=''Mandela and de Klerk'' (1997) |work=The New York Times |accessdate=26 October 2008 | first=Bill | last=Keller}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandela was played by [[Sidney Poitier]]. ''[[Goodbye Bafana]]'', a feature film that focuses on Mandela's life, had its world premiere at the Berlin film festival on 11 February 2007. The film starred [[Dennis Haysbert]] as Mandela and chronicled Mandela's relationship with prison guard [[James Gregory (writer)|James Gregory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goodbyebafana.com/synopsis/ |title=''Goodbye Bafana'' – Synopsis |publisher=Goodbye Bafana – Official site |accessdate=26 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the American television series ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' Cliff and Claire Huxtable's grandchildren were named Nelson and Winnie in honour of Mandela and his then wife Winnie.

In the [[BBC television]] [[sitcom]] [[Only Fools and Horses]] (1981–2003) the two main characters, [[Del Boy]] and [[Rodney Trotter]] live at flat 368 on the twelfth floor of the fictional Nelson Mandela House on the Dockside Estate, [[Peckham]], [[London]].

In the final scene of the 1992 movie ''[[Malcolm X (film)|Malcolm X]]'', Mandela – recently released after 27&amp;nbsp;years of political imprisonment – appears as a schoolteacher in a [[Soweto]] classroom.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2004/jun/03/features.matthewcunningham |title=Creme cameos |last=Cunningham |first=Matthew |date=3 June 2004 |work=The Guardian |accessdate=26 October 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recites a portion of one of [[Malcolm X]]'s most famous speeches, including the following sentence: ''&quot;We declare our right on this earth to be a human being, to be respected as a human being, to be given the rights of a human being in this society, on this earth, in this day, which we intend to bring into existence...&quot;''
The famous final phrase of that sentence is &quot;''[[by any means necessary]]''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EdGuerrero&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Guerrero |first=Ed |title=Framing Blackness: The African American Image in Film |publisher=Temple University Press |year=1993 |page=202 |isbn=1-56639-126-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandela informed director [[Spike Lee]] that he could not utter the phrase on camera fearing that the apartheid government would use it against him if he did. Lee obliged, and the final seconds of the film feature black-and-white footage of Malcolm X himself delivering the phrase.&lt;ref name=&quot;EdGuerrero&quot;/&gt;

Mandela and [[Springboks]] captain, [[François Pienaar]], are the focus of a 2008 book by John Carlin, ''Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation'',&lt;ref&gt;Carlin, John (2008). ''Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation''. New York: Penguin Press. ISBN 978-1-59420-174-5&lt;/ref&gt; that spotlights the role of the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]] win in post-apartheid South Africa. Carlin sold the film rights to [[Morgan Freeman]].&lt;ref name=KellerB-NYTBR-2008-08-17&gt;Keller, Bill. – &quot;Entering the Scrum&quot;. – ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''. – 17 August 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The film, entitled ''[[Invictus (film)|Invictus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planet-rugby.co.za/Story/0,18259,3551_4695695,00.html |title=The cast of the World Cup film revealed! |date=24 December 2008 |publisher=Planet Rugby |accessdate=10 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; was directed by [[Clint Eastwood]], and featured Freeman as Nelson Mandela and [[Matt Damon]] as Pienaar.&lt;ref name=KellerB-NYTBR-2008-08-17 /&gt;

In the [[BBC television]] one-off drama ''Mrs Mandela'', Nelson Mandela was portrayed by [[David Harewood]] and [[Sophie Okonedo]] played his former wife [[Winnie Mandela]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Dowell, Ben |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/mar/11/bbc-commissions-winnie-mandela-drama |title=BBC commissions Winnie Mandela drama |work=The Guardian |date=11 March 2009 |accessdate=11 March 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 April 2001, Nelson Mandela Gardens in [[Millennium Square, Leeds|Millennium Square]], [[Leeds]] was officially opened and Nelson Mandela was awarded the [[freedom of the city]] and awarded a commemorative 'golden owl' (the heraldic symbol of Leeds). In a speech outside [[Leeds Civic Hall]] in front of 5000 people, mistakenly Mandela famously thanked 'the people of [[Liverpool]] for their generosity'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Independent | publisher=Independent Print Limited|title=Mandela vindicates 'loony left' of Leeds for honouring struggle |author=Ian Herbert North |date=1 May 2001 |accessdate=24 January 2008 |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20010501/ai_n14389284|location=London}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 March 2004, Sandton Square in [[Johannesburg]] was renamed [[Nelson Mandela Square]], after a 6-metre statue of Nelson Mandela was installed on the square to honour the famous South African statesman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-16564833.html |title=S.

On 29 August 2007, a statue of Nelson Mandela was unveiled at [[Parliament Square]] in London by [[Richard Attenborough]], [[Ken Livingstone]], Wendy Woods (widow of [[Donald Woods]]), and [[Gordon Brown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6967927.stm |title=Nelson Mandela statue is unveiled |date=29 August 2007 |publisher=BBC News   |accessdate=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign to erect the statue was started in 2000 by the late [[Donald Woods]], a South African journalist driven into exile because of his anti-apartheid activities. Mandela stated that it represented not just him, but all those who have resisted oppression, especially those in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.london.gov.uk/view_press_release.jsp?releaseid=1752 |title=Broad Parliamentary Support for Trafalgar Square Mandela statue |date=21 May 2003 |publisher=London |accessdate=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added: &quot;The history of the struggle in South Africa is rich with the stories of heroes and heroines, some of them leaders, some of them followers. All of them deserve to be remembered.&quot;&lt;ref name=News24&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_2173453,00.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080527112148/http://www.news24.com/News24/World/News/0,,2-10-1462_2173453,00.html |archivedate=27 May 2008 |publisher=[[News24]] |title=Mandela salutes apartheid heroes |date=29 August 2007 |accessdate=26 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier London statue resides on the [[South Bank]] of [[The Thames]], dating from 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Walk This way – discover history and architecture at your feet..|url=http://www.southbanklondon.com/walkthisway/SculptureStroll.html|work=South Bank London|publisher=South Bank Employers' Group|accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 27 August 2008, a statue of Nelson Mandela was unveiled at Groot [[Drakenstein Correctional Centre]] between Paarl and Franshhoek on the R301 road, near Cape Town. Formerly known as Victor Verster, this was where Mandela spent the last few years of his 27 years in jail in relative comfort, as he and other ANC stalwarts negotiated with the apartheid government on the terms of his release and the nature of the new South Africa.
It stands on the very spot where Mandela took his first steps as a free man. Just outside the prison gates – the culmination of the Long Walk to Freedom – the title of Mandela's autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediaclubsouthafrica.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=703:mandelastatue270808&amp;catid=42:land_news&amp;Itemid=110|title=Long walk immortalised in bronze |last=Stern |first=Jennifer |date=27 August 2008 |publisher=Media Club South Africa |accessdate=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nelsonmandela.org/index.php/news/article/nelson_mandela_statue_unveiled_in_cape_town/ |title=Nelson Mandela statue unveiled in Cape Town |publisher=Nelson Mandela Foundation|accessdate=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1989's [[Loma Prieta earthquake]] demolished the [[Cypress Street Viaduct]] portion of the [[Nimitz Freeway]] in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], California, the city renamed the street-level boulevard that replaced it Mandela Parkway in his honour.

In [[Leicester]], England there is a Nelson Mandela Park with the slogan &quot;South Africa belongs to all those who live there, Black and White&quot;. It is opposite [[Leicester Tigers]] ground [[Welford Road Stadium|Welford Road]].

===Mandela Day===
[[Mandela Day]] on his birthday, 18 July, is an annual international day adopted by the United Nations. Individuals, communities and organisations are asked to donate 67 minutes to doing something for others, commemorating the 67 years that Nelson Mandela gave to the struggle for social justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nelson Mandela Day – How To Get Involved|url=http://www.nelsonmandela.org/mandeladay/how_to_get_involved.html|work=The Nelson Mandela Foundation|publisher=Nelson Mandela Foundation|accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of Mandela's presence is honoured. An example is that his signature on a [[green room]] wall was rapidly covered by a plastic cover to preserve the artifact. 

In 2004, zoologists Brent E. Hendrixson and Jason E.
