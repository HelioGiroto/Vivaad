'''Anita Jane Bryant''' (born March 25, 1940) is an [[People of the United States|American]] singer, former [[Miss Oklahoma]] beauty pageant winner, and outspoken critic of homosexuality. She scored four [[Top 40]] hits in the United States in the late 1950s and early 1960s, including &quot;[[Paper Roses]]&quot;, which reached #5. She later became known for her strong views against [[homosexuality]] and for her campaigning in 1977 to repeal a local ordinance in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County, Florida]], that prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, an involvement that significantly damaged her popularity and career.&lt;ref name=&quot;sptimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2002/04/28/State/Bankruptcy__ill_will_.shtml |title=Bankruptcy, ill will plague Bryant |first=Thomas C. |last=Tobin |publisher=''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' |date=April 28, 2002 |accessdate=June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Bryant was born in [[Barnsdall, Oklahoma|Barnsdall]], [[Oklahoma]]. After her parents divorced, her father went into the [[U.S. Army]] and her mother went to work, taking her children to live with their grandparents temporarily. When Bryant was two years old, her grandfather taught her to sing &quot;[[Jesus Loves Me]]&quot;. She was singing at the age of six onstage on local fairgrounds in [[Oklahoma]]. She sang occasionally on radio and television, and was invited to audition when [[Arthur Godfrey]]'s talent show came to town.

Bryant became Miss Oklahoma in 1958 and was a second runner-up in the 1959 [[Miss America]] [[beauty pageant]] at age 19, right after graduating from Tulsa's [[Will Rogers High School]].{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

In 1960, she married Bob Green (1931–2012), a [[Miami]] [[disc jockey]], with whom she eventually raised four children: Robert Jr. (Bobby), Gloria, Billy, and Barbara. She divorced him in 1980, drawing criticism of hypocrisy from the [[Christian right]] regarding the indissolubility of Christian marriage which Bryant had championed and &quot;the deterioration of the family&quot; against which she had preached.&lt;ref name=&quot;sptimes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sinclair |first=Kip |year=1980 |title=Anita Bryant Rates Family Bliss Next to Godliness, but After 20 Years She's Divorcing Bob Green |journal= |volume=13 |issue=23 |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20076683,00.html |accessdate= December 5, 2010| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110110175146/http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20076683,00.html| archivedate= 10 January 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Elinor J.

}}
Bryant placed a total of 11 songs on the U.S. Hot 100, although most were at the bottom reaches of the chart. She had a moderate [[pop music|pop]] hit with &quot;[[Till There Was You]]&quot; (1959, US #30). She also saw three hits in &quot;[[Paper Roses]]&quot; (1960, US #5, and covered by [[Marie Osmond]] 13 years later); &quot;[[My Little Corner of the World|In My Little Corner of the World]]&quot; (1960, US #10); and &quot;[[Wonderland by Night]]&quot; (1961, US #18).

Bryant released several albums on the Carlton and [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] labels. The 1959 Carlton LP ''Anita Bryant'' contained &quot;Till There Was You&quot; (from ''[[The Music Man]]''). The 1963 Columbia ''Greatest Hits'' LP contained both Carlton and Columbia songs, including &quot;Paper Roses&quot; and &quot;Step by Step, Little by Little&quot;. In 1964 she released ''The World of Lonely People'', containing, in addition to the title song, &quot;Welcome, Welcome Home&quot; and a new rendition of &quot;Little Things Mean a Lot&quot;, arranged by Frank Hunter.

In 1969 she became a spokeswoman for the Florida Citrus Commission, and nationally televised commercials featured her singing &quot;Come to the Florida Sunshine Tree&quot; and stating the commercials' tagline: &quot;Breakfast without orange juice is like a day without sunshine.&quot; (Later, the slogan became, &quot;It isn't just for breakfast any more!&quot;) All the commercials are now preserved and owned by the Lynn and Louis Wolfson II Florida Moving Image Archives in [[Miami]]. In addition, during this time, she also appeared in advertisements for [[Coca-Cola]], [[Kraft Foods]], [[Holiday Inn]] and [[Tupperware]].

She sang &quot;[[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]]&quot; during the graveside services for [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] in 1973, and performed the National Anthem at [[Super Bowl III]] in 1969.

She was interviewed by ''[[Playboy]]'' in May 1978.

==Political campaigning==
{{Further|Save Our Children|1977 in LGBT rights}}
In 1977, [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Dade County, Florida]] passed an [[local ordinance|ordinance]] sponsored by Bryant's former good friend [[Ruth Shack]], that prohibited [[discrimination]] on the basis of [[sexual orientation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;upi.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1977/Miami-Demonstrations/12361881614363-7 1977|title=Year in Review: Miami Demonstrations|publisher=United Press International}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant led a highly publicized campaign to repeal the ordinance as the leader of a coalition named [[Save Our Children]]. The campaign was based on conservative [[Christian]] beliefs regarding the sinfulness of [[homosexuality]] and the perceived threat of [[homosexual recruitment]] of children and [[Sexual abuse#Child sexual abuse|child molestation]]. Bryant stated: 
{{quote|&quot;What these people really want, hidden behind obscure legal phrases, is the legal right to propose to our children that theirs is an acceptable alternate way of life. [...] I will lead such a crusade to stop it as this country has not seen before.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;At Any Cost&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title= At Any Cost|last= Bryant|first=Anita |coauthors= Green, Bob |year= 1978|publisher= Fleming H. Revell |location= Grand Rapids, Michigan, US|isbn= B004V8W7OO|accessdate= Sept 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The campaign began an organized opposition to [[gay rights]] that spread across the nation. [[Jerry Falwell]] went to Miami to help her. Bryant made the following statements during the campaign: &quot;As a mother, I know that homosexuals cannot biologically reproduce children; therefore, they must recruit our children&quot; and &quot;If gays are granted rights, next we'll have to give rights to prostitutes and to [[bestiality|people who sleep with]] [[St. Bernard (dog)|St. Bernards]] and to nail biters.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;At Any Cost&quot;/&gt; She also added that &quot;All America and all the world will hear what the people have said, and with God's continued help we will prevail in our fight to repeal similar laws throughout the nation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;upi.com&quot; /&gt;

===Victory and defeat===
[[File:Anita Bryant Sucks Oranges button.jpg|thumb|right|Gay Rights campaigners organized their own high profile opposition to Bryant's campaign which publicly denounced her and included a boycott of Florida Citrus products for which Bryant was the spokesperson at the time.]]On June 7, 1977, Bryant's campaign led to a repeal of the anti-discrimination ordinance by a margin of 69 to 31 percent. However, the success of Bryant's campaign galvanized her opponents and the gay community retaliated against her by organizing a boycott of orange juice.&lt;ref name=&quot;At Any Cost&quot;/&gt; [[Gay bar]]s all over [[North America]] took [[screwdriver (cocktail)|screwdrivers]] off their drink menus and replaced them with the &quot;Anita Bryant&quot;, which was made with [[vodka]] and apple juice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcus&quot;/&gt; Sales and proceeds went to gay civil rights activists to help fund their fight against Bryant and her campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcus&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title= Making Gay History: The Half-Century Fight for Lesbian and Gay Equal Rights |last= Marcus|first=Eric |coauthors= |year= 2002|publisher= Harper |location= New York, US|isbn= 0-06-093391-7|accessdate= Sept 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, Florida legislators approved a measure prohibiting [[LGBT adoption in the United States|gay adoption]].&lt;ref name=&quot;At Any Cost&quot;/&gt; The ban was overturned more than 30 years later when, on November 25, 2008, Miami-Dade Circuit Court Judge Cindy S. Lederman declared it unconstitutional and &quot;not rational.&quot;&lt;ref name=FloridaGay&gt;{{Cite news

Bryant led several more campaigns around the country to repeal local anti-discrimination ordinances including [[St. Paul, Minnesota]], [[Wichita, Kansas]], and [[Eugene, Oregon]]. Her success led to an effort to pass the [[Briggs Initiative]] in [[California]] which would have made pro- or neutral statements regarding homosexuals or [[homosexuality]] by any [[Public school (government funded)|public school]] employee cause for dismissal.&lt;ref name=&quot;At Any Cost&quot;/&gt; Grass-roots [[Liberalism|liberal]] organizations, chiefly in [[Los Angeles]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], sprang up to defeat the initiative. Days before the election, the [[California Democratic Party]] opposed the proposed legislation. Former Governor and future President Ronald Reagan voiced opposition to the initiative, and it ultimately suffered a massive defeat at the polls.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcus&quot;/&gt;

In 1998 Dade County repudiated Bryant's successful campaign of 20 years earlier, and re-authorized an anti-discrimination ordinance protecting individuals from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation by a seven to six vote. In 2002 a ballot initiative to repeal the 1998 law called Amendment 14 was voted down by 56 percent of the voters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcus&quot;/&gt; The Florida statute forbidding gay adoption was upheld in 2004 by a federal [[appellate court]] against a constitutional challenge, but was overturned by a Miami-Dade Circuit Court in November 2008.&lt;ref name=FloridaGay/&gt;

[[File:Anita Bryant Pie October 14 1977.jpg|thumb|250 px|Bob Green and Anita Bryant at a press conference in [[Des Moines, Iowa]], where she was famously &quot;[[pieing|pied]]&quot; on camera by a gay rights activist.]]
Bryant became one of the first persons to be publicly &quot;[[pieing|pied]]&quot; as a political act (in her case, on television), in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]] in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/Movies/article/293551 'For the Bible Tells Me So': Setting us straight]&lt;/ref&gt; Bryant quipped &quot;At least it's a fruit pie&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0804/26/cnr.04.html CNN Transcripts]&lt;/ref&gt; apparently making a pun on the derogatory term for a gay man (&quot;fruit&quot;). While covered in pie, she began to pray to God to forgive the activist &quot;for his deviant lifestyle&quot; before bursting into tears as the cameras kept rolling. Bryant's husband, after promising not to retaliate, later took another pie and threw it at the protesters who had pied his wife.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcus&quot;/&gt; By this time, gay activists had ensured the boycott on Florida orange juice had become more prominent and it was supported by many celebrities including [[Barbra Streisand]], [[Bette Midler]], [[Paul Williams (songwriter)|Paul Williams]], [[John Waters (filmmaker)|John Waters]], [[Carroll O'Connor]], [[Mary Tyler Moore]], [[Linda Lavin]] and [[Jane Fonda]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcus&quot;/&gt; In 1978, Bryant and Green told the story of their campaign in the book, ''At Any Cost''.&lt;ref name=&quot;At Any Cost&quot;/&gt; Even many years after her campaign, the gay community continued to regard her name as synonymous with [[bigotry]] and [[homophobia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcus&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis-Georges Tin, ''Dictionary of Homophobia: A Global History of Gay &amp; Lesbian Experience'' (2003), ISBN 978-1-55152-229-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryant's 1977 political efforts are chronicled in Elizabeth Whitney's one-woman show ''A Day Without Sunshine''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/bryant_anita,5.html Bryant, Anita]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career decline and bankruptcies==
The fallout from her political activism hurt her business and entertainment career. Her contract with the Florida Citrus Commission was allowed to lapse in 1979 because of the controversy and the negative publicity generated by her political campaigns and the resulting boycott of Florida orange juice.&lt;ref name=sptimes/&gt;

Her marriage to Bob Green also failed at that time, and in 1980 she divorced him, citing emotional abuse and latent suicidal thoughts.&lt;ref name=&quot;A New Day&quot;/&gt; Green refused to accept this, saying that his [[Christian fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] religious beliefs did not recognize civil divorce and that she was &quot;still&quot; his wife &quot;in [[God]]'s eyes.&quot;  In 2007, Green stated: &quot;Blame gay people? I do.  Their stated goal was to put her out of business and destroy her career.  And that's what they did.  It's unfair.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Rothaus |url=http://miamiherald.typepad.com/gaysouthflorida/2007/06/bob_green_anita.html |title=Bob Green: Anita's ex paid dearly in the fight |publisher=The Miami Herald |date= |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some fundamentalist audiences and venues shunned her after her divorce. As she was no longer invited to appear at their events, she lost another major source of income. With three of her four children, she moved from Miami to [[Selma, Alabama]], and later to [[Atlanta, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;A New Day&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title= A New Day|last= Bryant|first=Anita |coauthors= |year= 1992|publisher= Broadman |location= Nashville, TN|isbn= B000LEM04E|accessdate= Sept 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1980 ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]'' article she said, &quot;The church needs to wake up and find some way to cope with divorce and women's problems.&quot; She also expressed some sympathy for feminist aspirations, given her own experiences of emotional abuse within her previous marriage.&lt;ref name=&quot;LHJ&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Jahr|first1= Cliff|last2= |first2= |year= 1980|title= Anita Bryant's Startling Reversal|journal= Ladies Home Journal |volume= |issue= December 1980|pages=60–68 |publisher= Charter Company|doi= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bryant appeared in [[Michael Moore]]'s 1989 documentary film ''[[Roger &amp; Me]]'', in which she is interviewed and travels to [[Flint, Michigan]], as part of the effort to revitalize the devastated local economy.

She married her second husband, Charlie Hobson Dry, in 1990.&lt;ref name=&quot;A New Day&quot;/&gt; The couple tried to reestablish her music career in a series of small venues, including [[Branson, Missouri]], and [[Pigeon Forge, Tennessee]] where they opened &quot;Anita Bryant's Music Mansion&quot;. The establishment combined Bryant's performances of her successful songs from early in her career with a &quot;lengthy segment in which she preached her Christian beliefs.&quot; The venture was not successful and the Music Mansion, which had missed meeting payrolls at times, filed for bankruptcy in 2001 with Bryant and Dry leaving behind a series of unpaid employees and creditors.&lt;ref name=&quot;sptimes&quot;/&gt;

Bryant also spent part of the 1990s in the country music mecca of Branson, Missouri, where the state and federal governments filed liens claiming more than $116,000 in unpaid taxes. Bryant and Dry had also filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in [[Arkansas]] in 1997 after piling up bills from a failed Anita Bryant show in [[Eureka Springs]], a tourist area in northwest Arkansas. Among the debts were more than $172,000 in unpaid state and federal taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;sptimes&quot;/&gt; 

In 2005, Bryant returned to Barnsdall, Oklahoma, for the town's 100th anniversary celebration and to have a street renamed in her honor. She returned to her high school in Tulsa on April 21, 2007, to perform in the school's annual musical revue. She now lives in [[Edmond, Oklahoma]], and says she does charity work for various youth organizations while heading Anita Bryant Ministries International.

In a 1980 ''[[Ladies Home Journal]]'' interview, following her divorce and in the aftermath of her anti-gay activism, Bryant commented on her anti-gay views and said, &quot;I'm more inclined to say live and let live, just don't flaunt it or try to legalize it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LHJ&quot;/&gt; However, the biography page on her Anita Bryant Ministries website (written in 2006) continues to defend her earlier anti-gay activism and views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Anita Bryant Biography| work = Anita Bryant Ministries International| accessdate = 2009-09-14| year = 2006| url = http://www.anitabmi.org/3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of Bryant's former husband Robert Green in 2012, Robert Green Jr. said, &quot;I think she is certainly more willing now to live and let live, I guess.  She's about 70, and she's still amazingly energetic, and she would be putting a lot more energy into fighting gay rights if she still felt as strongly.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Materville Studios – Host of Windy City Times |url=http://www.windycitymediagroup.com/lgbt/Talking-with-the-son-of-Bob-Green-and-Anita-Bryant/36564.html |title=Talking with the son of Bob Green and Anita Bryant |publisher=Windy CIty Times |date= |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Green added that all of Bryant's four children were more moderate than their parents.

==Cultural references==
Bryant's public persona has led to her being referred to (and often satirized) throughout popular culture:
*In the comic book, ''[[Howard the Duck]]'', a character called The Sinister SOOFI (with her organization &quot;Save Our Offspring from Indecency&quot;) is a parody of Bryant.  After Howard smashes her mask (in the shape of an orange) on her head, he recognizes her, and she says, &quot;And what's a girl from the Sunshine State doing in the trenches...A day without imposing my morality on someone else is like a day without--well, you know!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Steve Gerber.  &quot;If You Knew Soofi...&quot; ''Howard the Duck'' #21, Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the TV series ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]'', the character [[Karen Walker (Will &amp; Grace)|Karen Walker]] refers to Anita Bryant as being her enemy who fell in love with her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Dance Cars and Greetings Cards |accessdate= Sept 16, 2011|series= Will &amp; Grace|credits= Gail Lerner (w)|network= NBC|airdate= Feb 10, 2005|began= 1998|ended= 2006|season= 7|number= 16 |quote= First Anita Bryant and now this...}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bryant was often lampooned by comedy actress [[Jane Curtin]] who was a regular on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''. The first was in a 1976 edition in which she portrayed Bryant being held captive in [[Beirut]] by two Arab terrorists but tries to promote orange juice to them. Her captors drink the juice and agree it is delicious, but as Bryant starts to sing her infamous jingle from the TV commercials, they place a bag over her head and order a firing squad to shoot her.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Dyan Cannon|accessdate= Sept 16, 2011|series= Saturday Night Live|network= NBC|airdate= May 15, 1976|began= 1975|ended= |season= 1|number= 20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1977 edition of &quot;Weekend Update&quot; showed a photo of a scowling Bryant as Curtin reports: &quot;Our top story tonight: A report from Florida states that Anita Bryant plans to undergo a sex-change operation this Spring. The exact date will not be set until the popular TV personality decides which sex to change to.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Steve Martin|accessdate= Mar 30, 2012|series= Saturday Night Live|network= NBC|airdate= Feb 26, 1977|began= 1975|ended= |season=  2|number= 14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another 1977 edition in which Curtin played a newscaster on a spoof news show &quot;Weekend Update&quot;, the then-recent clip of Bryant being pied on television was shown. Returning to the news studio, Curtin stated &quot;Fortunately, Ms. Bryant, who was not injured, enjoyed a good laugh, and said it was okay if the assailant dated her husband.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Hugh Hefner |accessdate= Sept 16, 2011|series= Saturday Night Live|network= NBC|airdate= Oct 15, 1977|began= 1975|ended= |season= 3|number= 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another was in 1980 in which she portrayed Bryant planning an anti-gay [[sting operation]] with police and gets angry when one of the officers turns down her offer of orange juice by saying he'd already had some for breakfast (Bryant's famous slogan when she did her Florida Orange Juice commercials was &quot;it's not just for breakfast&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Burt Reynolds|accessdate= Sept 16, 2011|series= Saturday Night Live|network= NBC|airdate= April 12, 1980|began= 1975|ended= |season= 5|number= 16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the TV series ''[[Designing Women]]'', Bryant is mentioned in several episodes by Suzanne Sugarbaker (played by [[Delta Burke]]), referencing both her [[beauty pageant]] history, as well as her political activism which Suzanne disagreed with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Monette |accessdate= Sept 16, 2011|series= Designing Women|network= NBC|airdate= Feb 8, 1987|began= 1986|ended= 1993|season= 1|number= 13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In an episode of the TV sitcom ''[[The Golden Girls]]'', an effeminate male wedding planner is overcome with emotion, causing character [[Blanche Devereaux]] to sarcastically comment, &quot;You're ready to fly right outta here, aren't you?&quot;  The man replies, &quot;Well, excuse me for living, Anita Bryant!&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Sophia's Wedding (1) |accessdate= Sept 16, 2011|series= The Golden Girls|network= NBC|airdate= Nov 19, 1988|began= 1985|ended= 1992|season= 4|number= 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In another episode, character [[Dorothy Zbornak]] complains that although she and [[Rose Nylund]] placed second in a song-writing contest about [[Miami]], they still got &quot;treated badly&quot; because the judges told them &quot;to get out of the way as they took the winner's picture with Anita Bryant.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Big Daddy's Little Lady |accessdate= Sept 16, 2011|series= The Golden Girls|network= NBC|airdate= Nov 15, 1986|began= 1985|ended= 1992|season= 2|number= 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine's parody of the television sitcom ''[[Three's Company]]'' (where [[John Ritter]]'s character, Jack, pretends to be gay to share an apartment with two women) ends with a visit from the &quot;new landlord&quot;, a whip-wielding Anita Bryant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |year= 1978|title= He's Company|journal= Mad Magazine |volume= #196|issue= January 1978|publisher= DC Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In an episode of TV's ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', Lorelai says to her father that he could fill a huge gap after Anita Bryant because her father always has half a grapefruit for breakfast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Richard in Stars Hollow|accessdate= Sept 16, 2011|series= Gilmore Girls|network= WB|airdate= Jan 29, 2002|began= 2000|ended= 2007|season= 2|number= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the song &quot;Fuck Aneta Briant&quot; {{sic}} on his 1978 album ''[[Nothing Sacred (David Allan Coe album)|Nothing Sacred]]'', country singer [[David Allan Coe]] expresses his feelings for Bryant.&lt;ref&gt;David Allen Coe – ''Nothing Sacred'' (lyrics/liner notes) (DAC Records, 1978)&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Armistead Maupin]]'s 1980 novel ''[[More Tales of the City (novel)|More Tales of the City]]'', Michael Tolliver's parents write to him praising Anita Bryant's &quot;Save Our Children&quot; campaign, prompting him to write back and come out of the closet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= More Tales of the City|last= Maupin|first= Armistead |authorlink= Armistead Maupin |year= 1980|publisher= Harper &amp; Row|location= New York, US|isbn= 0-06-090726-6|accessdate=Sept 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1977, the album ''[[Lesbian Concentrate]]'' was released by [[Olivia Records]] in protest to Bryant's anti-gay campaigning. The album featured a collection of songs and poems by different artists. The liner notes to the album referred to Bryant as &quot;a part-time orange juice pusher&quot;. Part of the proceeds from the album went to the Lesbian Mothers National Defense Fund, an organization dedicated to helping lesbian mothers keep their children.&lt;ref&gt;''Lesbian Concentrate: A Lesbianthology of Songs and Poems'' (liner notes) (Olivia Records, 1977)&lt;/ref&gt;
