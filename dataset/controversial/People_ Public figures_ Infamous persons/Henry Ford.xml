'''Henry Ford''' (July 30, 1863 – April 7, 1947) was an American industrialist, the founder of the [[Ford Motor Company]], and sponsor of the development of the [[assembly line]] technique of [[mass production]]. Although Ford did not invent the automobile, he developed and manufactured the first automobile that many middle class Americans could afford to buy.  His introduction of the [[Ford Model T|Model T]] [[History of the automobile|automobile]] revolutionized transportation and American industry. As owner of the Ford Motor Company, he became one of the richest and best-known people in the world. He is credited with &quot;[[Fordism]]&quot;: mass production of inexpensive goods coupled with high wages for workers. Ford had a global vision, with consumerism as the key to peace. His intense commitment to systematically lowering costs resulted in many technical and business innovations, including a [[Franchising|franchise]] system that put dealerships throughout most of North America and in major cities on six continents. Ford left most of his vast wealth to the [[Ford Foundation]] but arranged for his family to control the company permanently.

Ford was also widely known for his [[pacifism]] during the first years of World War I, but also for being the publisher of [[antisemitism|antisemitic]] texts such as the book ''[[The International Jew]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Neil Baldwin|Baldwin, N.]] (2001). ''Henry Ford and the Jews''. New York: Public Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Ford was born July 30, 1863, on a farm in [[Greenfield Township, Michigan|Greenfield Township]] (near
[[Detroit]], Michigan).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/hf/default.asp www.hfmgv.org The Henry Ford Museum: ''The Life of Henry Ford'']&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[William Ford (business)|William Ford]] (1826–1905), was born in [[County Cork]], Ireland, of a family originally from western England, who were among migrants to Ireland as the English created plantations. {{citation needed|date=December 2010}} His mother, Mary Litogot Ford (1839–1876), was born in Michigan; she was the youngest child of [[Belgian]] immigrants; her parents died when Mary was a child and she was adopted by neighbors, the O'Herns. Henry Ford's siblings include Margaret Ford (1867–1938); Jane Ford (c. 1868–1945); William Ford (1871–1917) and Robert Ford (1873–1934).

His father gave him a pocket watch in his early teens. At 15, Ford dismantled and reassembled the timepieces of friends and neighbors dozens of times, gaining the reputation of a watch repairman.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, ''My Life and Work'', 22–24; Nevins and Hill, ''Ford TMC'', 58.&lt;/ref&gt; At twenty, Ford walked four miles to their [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopal]] church every Sunday.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Harold &quot;They Made America&quot; Little, Brown and Company. New York&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford was devastated when his mother died in 1876. His father expected him to eventually take over the family farm, but he despised farm work. He later wrote, &quot;I never had any particular love for the farm—it was the mother on the farm I loved.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ford, ''My Life and Work'', 24; Edward A. Guest &quot;Henry Ford Talks About His Mother,&quot; ''American Magazine'', July, 1923, 11–15, 116–120.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1879, he left home to work as an apprentice [[machinist]] in the city of [[Detroit]], first with James F. Flower &amp; Bros., and later with the [[Detroit Dry Dock]] Co. In 1882, he returned to Dearborn to work on the family farm, where he became adept at operating the Westinghouse portable [[steam engine]]. He was later hired by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] company to service their steam engines. During this period Ford also studied bookkeeping at [[Goldsmith, Bryant &amp; Stratton Business College]] in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Watts, The People's Tycoon: Henry Ford and the American Century (Random House, Inc., 2006), pg. 28 http://books.google.com/books?id=LIDyU91YMHAC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Henry Ford 1888.jpg|frame|right|150px|Henry Ford in 1888, aged 25.]]

==Marriage and family==
Ford married Clara Ala Bryant (1866–1950) in 1888 and supported himself by farming and running a sawmill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Widow of Automobile Pioneer, Victim of Coronary Occlusion, Survived Him Three Years|quote=Friday, Sept. 29 (Associated Press) Mrs. Clara Bryant Ford, 84&amp;nbsp;year-old widow of Henry Ford, died at 2 A. M. today in Henry Ford Hospital. A family spokesman said her death was the result of an acute coronary occlusion.|agency=Associated Press|date=1950-09-29|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had one child: [[Edsel Ford]] (1893–1943).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Edsel Ford Dies in Detroit at 49. Motor Company President, the Only Son of Its Founder, Had Long Been Ill.|quote=Edsel Ford, 49-year-old president of the Ford Motor Company, died this morning at his home at [[Grosse Pointe]] Shores following an illness of six weeks.|agency=Associated Press|date=1943-05-26|accessdate=2007-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1891, Ford became an engineer with the [[Edison Illuminating Company]]. After his promotion to Chief Engineer in 1893, he had enough time and money to devote attention to his personal experiments on gasoline engines. These experiments culminated in 1896 with the completion of a self-propelled vehicle which he named the [[Ford Quadricycle]]. He test-drove it on June 4. After various test-drives, Ford brainstormed ways to improve the Quadricycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hfmgv.org/exhibits/showroom/1896/quad.html The Showroom of Automotive History: 1896 Quadricycle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1896, Ford attended a meeting of Edison executives, where he was introduced to [[Thomas Edison]]. Edison approved of Ford's automobile experimentation. Encouraged by Edison, Ford designed and built a second vehicle, completing it in 1898.&lt;ref name=birth&gt;Ford R. Bryan, [http://hfha.org/HenryFord.htm &quot;The Birth of Ford Motor Company&quot;], Henry Ford Heritage Association, retrieved August 20, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Backed by the capital of Detroit [[lumber baron]] William H. Murphy, Ford resigned from the Edison Company and founded the [[Detroit Automobile Company]] on August 5, 1899.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; However, the automobiles produced were of a lower quality and higher price than Ford wanted. Ultimately, the company was not successful and was dissolved in January 1901.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt;

With the help of [[C. Harold Wills]], Ford designed, built, and successfully raced a 26-horsepower automobile in October 1901. With this success, Murphy and other stockholders in the Detroit Automobile Company formed the [[Henry Ford Company]] on November 30, 1901, with Ford as chief engineer.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; In 1902, Murphy brought in [[Henry M. Leland]] as a consultant; Ford, in response, left the company bearing his name. With Ford gone, Murphy renamed the company the [[Cadillac Automobile Company]].&lt;ref name=birth/&gt;

Teaming up with former racing cyclist [[Tom Cooper (driver)|Tom Cooper]], Ford also produced the 80+ horsepower racer &quot;999&quot; which [[Barney Oldfield]] was to drive to victory in a race in October 1902. Ford received the backing of an old acquaintance, [[Alexander Y. Malcomson]], a Detroit-area coal dealer.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; They formed a partnership, &quot;Ford &amp; Malcomson, Ltd.&quot; to manufacture automobiles. Ford went to work designing an inexpensive automobile, and the duo leased a factory and contracted with a machine shop owned by [[John F. Dodge|John]] and [[Horace E. Dodge]] to supply over $160,000 in parts.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; Sales were slow, and a crisis arose when the Dodge brothers demanded payment for their first shipment.

==Ford Motor Company==
[[Image:Ford Edison Firestone1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Henry Ford with [[Thomas Edison]] and [[Harvey Firestone]]. [[Ft. Myers]], Florida, February 11, 1929.]]

In response, Malcomson brought in another group of investors and convinced the Dodge Brothers to accept a portion of the new company.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; Ford &amp; Malcomson was reincorporated as the [[Ford Motor Company]] on June 16, 1903,&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; with $28,000 capital. The original investors included Ford and Malcomson, the Dodge brothers, Malcomson's uncle [[John S. Gray (Michigan)|John S. Gray]], Malcolmson's secretary [[James Couzens]], and two of Malcomson's lawyers, John W. Anderson and [[Horace Rackham]]. Ford then demonstrated a newly-designed car on the ice of [[Lake Saint Clair (North America)|Lake St. Clair]], driving 1&amp;nbsp;mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) in 39.4 seconds and setting a new [[land speed record]] at 91.3 miles per hour (147.0&amp;nbsp;km/h). Convinced by this success, the race driver [[Barney Oldfield]], who named this new Ford model &quot;999&quot; in honor of the fastest locomotive of the day, took the car around the country, making the Ford brand known throughout the United States. Ford also was one of the early backers of the [[Indianapolis 500]].

===Model T===
The [[Model T]] was introduced on October 1, 1908. It had the steering wheel on the left, which every other company soon copied. The entire engine and transmission were enclosed; the four cylinders were cast in a solid block; the suspension used two semi-elliptic springs. The car was very simple to drive, and easy and cheap to repair. It was so cheap at $825 in 1908 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|825|1908|r=-1}}}} today) (the price fell every year) that by the 1920s, a majority of American drivers had learned to drive on the Model T.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Bak, ''Henry and Edsel: The Creation of the Ford Empire'' (2003) pp 54–63&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford created a massive publicity machine in Detroit to ensure every newspaper carried stories and ads about the new product. Ford's network of local dealers made the car ubiquitous in virtually every city in North America. As independent dealers, the franchises grew rich and publicized not just the Ford but the very concept of automobiling; local motor clubs sprang up to help new drivers and to encourage exploring the countryside. Ford was always eager to sell to farmers, who looked on the vehicle as a commercial device to help their business. Sales skyrocketed—several years posted 100% gains on the previous year. Always on the hunt for more efficiency and lower costs, in 1913 Ford introduced the moving assembly belts into his plants, which enabled an enormous increase in production. Although Ford is often credited with the idea, contemporary sources indicate that the concept and its development came from employees [[Clarence Avery]], [[Peter E. Martin]], [[Charles E. Sorensen]], and [[C. Harold Wills]].&lt;ref&gt;Nevins (1954) 1:387–415&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Piquette Plant]])

[[Image:Ford assembly line - 1913.jpg|left|thumb|Ford Assembly Line, 1913]]

Sales passed 250,000 in 1914. By 1916, as the price dropped to $360 for the basic touring car, sales reached 472,000.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis 1976, pp 41–59&lt;/ref&gt; (Using the consumer price index, this price was equivalent to $7,020 in 2008 dollars.)

By 1918, half of all cars in America were Model T's. However, it was a monolithic black; as Ford wrote in his autobiography, &quot;Any customer can have a car painted any color that he wants so long as it is black&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ford_Crowther_1922_p72&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [http://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA72#v=onepage&amp;f=false p. 72].&lt;/ref&gt; Until the development of the assembly line, which mandated black because of its quicker drying time, Model T's were available in other colors, including red. The design was fervently promoted and defended by Ford, and production continued as late as 1927; the final total production was 15,007,034. This record stood for the next 45 years. This record was achieved in just 19 years from the introduction of the first [[Model T]] (1908).

President [[Woodrow Wilson]] asked Ford to run as a Democrat for the [[United States Senate]] from Michigan in 1918. Although the nation was at war, Ford ran as a peace candidate and a strong supporter of the proposed [[League of Nations]].&lt;ref&gt;Watts, pp 243–48&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry Ford turned the presidency of Ford Motor Company over to his son Edsel Ford in December 1918. Henry, however, retained final decision authority and sometimes reversed his son. Henry started another company, Henry Ford and Son, and made a show of taking himself and his best employees to the new company; the goal was to scare the remaining holdout stockholders of the Ford Motor Company to sell their stakes to him before they lost most of their value. (He was determined to have full control over strategic decisions.) The ruse worked, and Henry and Edsel purchased all remaining stock from the other investors, thus giving the family sole ownership of the company.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins and Hill (1957) vol 2&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1920s, sales of the Model T began to decline due to rising competition. Other auto makers offered payment plans through which consumers could buy their cars, which usually included more modern mechanical features and styling not available with the Model T. Despite urgings from Edsel, Henry steadfastly refused to incorporate new features into the Model T or to form a customer credit plan.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:409-36&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model A and Ford's later career===
By 1926, flagging sales of the Model T finally convinced Henry to make a new model. He pursued the project with a great deal of technical expertise in design of the engine, chassis, and other mechanical necessities, while leaving the body design to his son. Edsel also managed to prevail over his father's initial objections in the inclusion of a sliding-shift transmission.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sorensen1956p223&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=223}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The result was the successful [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Ford Model A]], introduced in December 1927 and produced through 1931, with a total output of more than 4&amp;nbsp;million. Subsequently, the Ford company adopted an annual model change system similar to that recently pioneered by its competitor General Motors (and still in use by automakers today). Not until the 1930s did Ford overcome his objection to finance companies, and the Ford-owned [[Universal Credit Corporation]] became a major car-financing operation.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:459-78&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford did not believe in accountants; he amassed one of the world's largest fortunes without ever having his company [[audit]]ed under his administration.

===Labor philosophy===
====The five-dollar workday====
[[Image:Timehenryford.jpg|thumb|''[[TIME|Time]] Magazine'', January 14, 1935.]]
Ford was a pioneer of &quot;[[welfare capitalism]]&quot;, designed to improve the lot of his workers and especially to reduce the heavy [[turnover (employment)|turnover]] that had many departments hiring 300 men per year to fill 100 slots. Efficiency meant hiring and keeping the best workers.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:508-40&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford astonished the world in 1914 by offering a $5 per day wage (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|5|1914|r=-1}}}} today), which more than doubled the rate of most of his workers.&lt;ref&gt;Using the [[consumer price index]], this was equivalent to $111.10 per day in 2008 dollars.&lt;/ref&gt; A Cleveland, Ohio newspaper editorialized that the announcement &quot;shot like a blinding rocket through the dark clouds of the present industrial depression.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''Public Image'' p 71&lt;/ref&gt; The move proved extremely profitable; instead of constant turnover of employees, the best mechanics in Detroit flocked to Ford, bringing their human capital and expertise, raising productivity, and lowering training costs.&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, ''Ford'' 1:528-41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watts, ''People's Tycoon,'' pp. 178–94&lt;/ref&gt; Ford announced his $5-per-day program on January 5, 1914, raising the minimum daily pay from $2.34 to $5 for qualifying workers. It also set a new, reduced workweek, although the details vary in different accounts. Ford and Crowther in 1922 described it as six 8-hour days, giving a 48-hour week,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ford_Crowther_1922_p126&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [http://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;f=false p. 126].&lt;/ref&gt; while in 1926 they described it as five 8-hour days, giving a 40-hour week.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel Crowther [http://www.worklessparty.org/timework/ford.htm Henry Ford: &quot;Why I Favor Five Days' Work With Six Days' Pay&quot;], ''World's Work,'' October 1926 pp. 613–616&lt;/ref&gt; (Apparently the program started with Saturdays as workdays and sometime later it was changed to a day off.)

Detroit was already a high-wage city, but competitors were forced to raise wages or lose their best workers.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, ''People's Tycoon,'' pp. 193–94&lt;/ref&gt; Ford's policy proved, however, that paying people more would enable Ford workers to afford the cars they were producing and be good for the economy. Ford explained the policy as profit-sharing rather than wages.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ford_Crowther_1922_pp126-130&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [http://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA126#v=onepage&amp;f=false pp. 126–130].&lt;/ref&gt; It may have been [[James Couzens|Couzens]] who convinced Ford to adopt the $5 day.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, ''Public Image,'' 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;

The profit-sharing was offered to employees who had worked at the company for six months or more, and, importantly, conducted their lives in a manner of which Ford's &quot;Social Department&quot; approved. They frowned on heavy drinking, gambling, and what might today be called &quot;[[deadbeat dads]]&quot;. The Social Department used 50 investigators, plus support staff, to maintain employee standards; a large percentage of workers were able to qualify for this &quot;profit-sharing.&quot;

Ford's incursion into his employees' private lives was highly controversial, and he soon backed off from the most intrusive aspects. By the time he wrote his 1922 memoir, he spoke of the Social Department and of the private conditions for profit-sharing in the past tense, and admitted that &quot;paternalism has no place in industry. Welfare work that consists in prying into employees' private concerns is out of date. Men need counsel and men need help, oftentimes special help; and all this ought to be rendered for decency's sake. But the broad workable plan of investment and participation will do more to solidify industry and strengthen organization than will any social work on the outside. Without changing the principle we have changed the method of payment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ford_Crowther_1922_p130&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [http://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA130#v=onepage&amp;f=false p. 130].&lt;/ref&gt;

====Labor unions====
Ford was adamantly against [[trade union|labor unions]]. He explained his views on unions in Chapter 18 of ''My Life and Work''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ford_Crowther_1922_pp253-266&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [http://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA253#v=onepage&amp;f=false pp. 253–266].&lt;/ref&gt; He thought they were too heavily influenced by some leaders who, despite their ostensible good motives, would end up doing more harm than good for workers. {{Anchor|No_prosperity_without_productivity}} Most wanted to restrict productivity as a means to foster employment, but Ford saw this as self-defeating because, in his view, productivity was necessary for any economic prosperity to exist.

He believed that productivity gains that obviated certain jobs would nevertheless stimulate the larger economy and thus grow new jobs elsewhere, whether within the same corporation or in others. Ford also believed that union leaders had a [[perverse incentive]] to foment perpetual socio-economic crisis as a way to maintain their own power. Meanwhile, he believed that smart managers had an incentive to do right by their workers, because doing so would maximize their own profits. (Ford did acknowledge, however, that many managers were basically too bad at managing to understand this fact.) But Ford believed that eventually, if good managers such as he could fend off the attacks of misguided people from both left and right (i.e., both socialists and bad-manager reactionaries), the good managers would create a socio-economic system wherein neither bad management nor bad unions could find enough support to continue existing.

To forestall union activity, Ford promoted [[Harry Bennett]], a former [[United States Navy|Navy]] boxer, to head the Service Department. Bennett employed various intimidation tactics to squash union organizing.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, J: ''Henry Ford'', pages 91–92. Moffa Press, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous incident, on May 26, 1937, involved Bennett's security men beating with clubs UAW representatives, including [[Walter Reuther]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace&quot;&gt;Wallace, Max. (2003). ''The American axis: Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh, and the rise of the Third Reich''. New York: St. Martin’s Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While the Bennett's men were beating the UAW representatives, the supervising police chief on the scene was Carl Brooks, an alumnus of Bennett’s Service Department, and [Brooks] &quot;did not give orders to intervene.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, 2003, p. 311.&lt;/ref&gt; The incident became known as [[The Battle of the Overpass]].

In the late 1930s and early 1940s, Edsel (who was president of the company) thought Ford had to come to some sort of [[collective bargaining]] agreement with the unions because the violence, work disruptions, and bitter stalemates could not go on forever. But Henry (who still had the final veto in the company on a ''de facto'' basis even if not an official one) refused to cooperate. For several years, he kept Bennett in charge of talking to the unions that were trying to organize the Ford Motor Company. Sorensen's memoir&lt;ref name=&quot;Sorensen1956p261&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|p=261}}.&lt;/ref&gt; makes clear that Henry's purpose in putting Bennett in charge was to make sure no agreements were ever reached.

The Ford Motor Company was the last Detroit automaker to recognize the [[United Auto Workers]] union (UAW). A sit-down strike by the UAW union in April 1941 closed the [[River Rouge Plant]]. Sorensen recounted that a distraught Henry Ford was very close to following through with a threat to break up the company rather than cooperate but that his wife Clara told him she would leave him if he destroyed the family business. She wanted to see their son and grandsons lead it into the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sorensen1956pp266-272&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=266–272}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Henry complied with his wife's ultimatum. Overnight, the Ford Motor Co. went from the most stubborn holdout among automakers to the one with the most favorable UAW contract terms.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} The contract was signed in June 1941.

==Ford Airplane Company==
Ford, like other automobile companies, entered the aviation business during [[World War I]], building Liberty engines. After the war, it returned to auto manufacturing until 1925, when Ford acquired the [[Stout Metal Airplane Division of the Ford Motor Company|Stout Metal Airplane Company]].

Ford's most successful aircraft was the [[Ford Trimotor|Ford 4AT Trimotor]], often called the &quot;Tin Goose&quot; because of its corrugated metal construction. It used a new alloy called [[Alclad]] that combined the corrosion resistance of aluminum with the strength of [[duralumin]]. The plane was similar to [[Fokker]]'s V.VII-3m, and some say that Ford's engineers surreptitiously measured the Fokker plane and then copied it. The Trimotor first flew on June 11, 1926, and was the first successful U.S. passenger airliner, accommodating about 12 passengers in a rather uncomfortable fashion. Several variants were also used by the [[U.S. Army]]. Ford has been honored by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] for changing the aviation industry. 199 Trimotors were built before it was discontinued in 1933, when the Ford Airplane Division shut down because of poor sales during the [[Great Depression]].

==Peace and war==
===World War I era===
Ford opposed war, which he thought was a terrible waste.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ford-Bio-A&amp;E&quot;&gt;Henry Ford, Biography (March 25, 1999). ''A&amp;E Television''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michigan History, January/February 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Ford became highly critical of those who he felt financed war, and he tried to stop them. In 1915, the pacifist [[Rosika Schwimmer]] gained favor with Ford, who agreed to fund a peace ship to Europe, where World War I was raging. He and about 170 other prominent peace leaders traveled there. Ford's Episcopalian pastor, Reverend Samuel S. Marquis, accompanied him on the mission. Marquis headed Ford's Sociology Department from 1913 to 1921. Ford talked to President Wilson about the mission but had no government support. His group went to neutral Sweden and the Netherlands to meet with peace activists. A target of much ridicule, Ford left the ship as soon as it reached Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, ''The People's Tycoon'' (2005) pp 225–49&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford plants in Britain produced tractors to increase the British food supply, as well as trucks and aircraft engines. When the U.S. entered the war in 1917 the company became a major supplier of weapons, especially the Liberty engine for airplanes, and anti-submarine boats.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Nevins and Frank Ernest Hill, ''Ford: Expansion and Challenge, 1915–1933'' (1957) pp 55–85&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, with the war on and the [[League of Nations]] a growing issue in global politics, President [[Woodrow Wilson]], a Democrat, encouraged Ford to run for a Michigan seat in the U.S. Senate. Wilson believed that Ford could tip the scales in Congress in favor of Wilson's proposed [[League of Nations|League]]. &quot;You are the only man in Michigan who can be elected and help bring about the peace you so desire,&quot; the president wrote Ford. Ford wrote back: &quot;If they want to elect me let them do so, but I won't make a penny's investment.&quot; Ford did run, however, and came within 4,500 votes of winning, out of more than 400,000 cast statewide.&lt;ref&gt;Banham, Russ. (2002) ''The Ford Century.'' Tehabi Books. ISBN 1-887656-88-X, p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The coming of World War II and Ford's mental collapse===
Ford had opposed America's entry into World War II &lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, Neil (2001). ''Henry Ford and the Jews: The Mass Production of Hate''. New York: Public Affairs.&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to believe that international business could generate the prosperity that would head off wars. Ford &quot;insisted that war was the product of greedy financiers who sought profit in human destruction&quot;; in 1939 he went so far as to claim that the torpedoing of U.S. merchant ships by German submarines was the result of conspiratorial activities undertaken by financier war-makers.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Watts, ''The People's Tycoon'' (2005) p 505&lt;/ref&gt; The financiers to whom he was referring was Ford's code for Jews; he had also accused Jews of fomenting the First World War (see the section on his anti-Semitism below).&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace&quot;/&gt; In the run-up to World War II and when the war erupted in 1939, he reported that he did not want to trade with belligerents. Like many other businessmen of the Great Depression era, he never liked or entirely trusted the Franklin Roosevelt Administration, and thought Roosevelt was inching the U.S. closer to war. However, Ford continued to do business with Nazi Germany, including the manufacture of war materiel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace&quot;/&gt; Beginning in 1940, with the requisitioning of between 100 and 200 French [[Prisoner of war|POWs]] to work as slave laborers, ''[[Ford Germany|Ford-Werke]]'' contravened Article 31 of the 1929 [[Geneva Conventions|Geneva Convention]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace&quot;/&gt; At that time, which was before the U.S. entered the War and still had full diplomatic relations with Nazi Germany, ''Ford-Werke'' was under the control of the Ford Motor Company. The number of slave laborers grew as the war expanded although Wallace made it clear that companies in Germany were not required by the Nazi authorities to use slave laborers. 

When [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]] sought a U.S. manufacturer as an alternative source for the [[Rolls-Royce Merlin|Merlin]] engine (as fitted to [[Supermarine Spitfire|Spitfire]] and [[Hawker Hurricane|Hurricane]] fighters), Ford first agreed to do so and then [[Rolls-Royce Merlin#Packard V-1650|reneged]]. He &quot;lined up behind the war effort&quot; when the U.S. entered in late 1941.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Watts, ''The People's Tycoon'' (2005) p 508&lt;/ref&gt; His support of the American war effort, however, was problematic. 

Once the U.S. entered the war, Ford directed the [[Ford Motor Company]] to construct a vast new purpose-built factory at [[Willow Run]] near [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]]. Ford broke ground on Willow Run in the spring of 1941, with the first [[Consolidated B-24 Liberator|B-24]] coming off the line in October 1942. It had the largest assembly line in the world (3,500,000&amp;nbsp;ft²/330,000&amp;nbsp;m²). At its peak, the Willow Run plant produced 650 B-24s per month in 1944. By 1945, Ford was making a B-24s in eighteen hours. At Willow Run, Ford produced 9,000 B-24s (half of 18,000 total B-24s).&lt;ref name=Willowrun&gt;Nolan, Jenny. [http://info.detnews.com/redesign/history/story/historytemplate.cfm?id=73&amp;category=locations &quot;Michigan History: Willow Run and the Arsenal of Democracy.&quot;] ''The Detroit News,'' 28 January 1997. Retrieved: 7 August 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a series of strokes in the late 1930s he became increasingly debilitated and was more of a figurehead; other people made the decisions in his name.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, ''The People's Tycoon'' (2005) p 503&lt;/ref&gt; After Edsel Ford's premature death, Henry Ford nominally resumed control of the company in 1943, but his mental ability was fading. In reality the company was controlled by a handful of senior executives led by [[Charles Sorensen]], an important engineer and production executive at Ford, and [[Harry Bennett]], the chief of Ford's Service Unit, Ford's paramilitary force that spied, and enforced discipline, on employees. As Ford became increasingly sidelined, he grew jealous of the publicity Sorensen received; Ford forced Sorensen out in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, ''The People's Tycoon'' (2005) p 522-5&lt;/ref&gt; Henry Ford II (Ford's grandson), in a purge of the old guard, forced out Bennett in 1947. Ford's incompetence led to discussions in Washington about how to restore the company, whether by wartime government fiat or by instigating some sort of coup among executives and directors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sorensen1956pp324–333&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=324–333}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing happened until 1945, with bankruptcy a serious risk. Edsel's widow led an ouster and installed her son, [[Henry Ford II]], as president; the young man took full control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Yates, p.45&quot;&gt;Yates, p.45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watts, ''The People's Tycoon'' (2005) p 522-7&lt;/ref&gt;

==''The Dearborn Independent'' and anti-Semitism==
&lt;!--THIS SECTION HEADING WAS DETERMINED, BY CONSENSUS, TO BE THE MOST NEUTRAL IN TONE. DO NOT CHANGE IT TO 'ANTISEMITISM', AS IT WILL BE REVERTED.--&gt;

{{main|Dearborn Independent}}[[Image:1920 International Jew reprint from Dearborn Independent.jpg|thumb|''The Ford publication [[The International Jew|The International Jew, the World's Foremost Problem]]''. Articles from ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]'', 1920]]

Ford in the early 1920s sponsored a weekly newspaper that published (among many non-controversial articles) strongly anti-Semitic views. At the same time Ford had a reputation as one of the few major corporations actively hiring black workers; he was not accused of discrimination against Jewish workers or suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;He also hired women and handicapped men at a time that was uncommon. Howard P. Segal, ''Recasting the Machine Age: Henry Ford's Village Industries'' (2008) p 46&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, Ford's closest aide and private secretary, Ernest G. Liebold, purchased an obscure weekly newspaper for Ford, ''[[The Dearborn Independent]]''. The ''Independent'' ran for eight years, from 1920 until 1927, during which Liebold was editor. Every Ford franchise nation-wide had to carry the paper and distribute it to its customers.

The newspaper published ''[[The Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]'', which was discredited by ''[[The Times]]'' of London as a forgery during the ''Independent'''s publishing run. The [[American Jewish Historical Society]] described the ideas presented in the magazine as &quot;[[Nativism (politics)|anti-immigrant]], anti-labor, anti-liquor, and [[Anti-Semitism|anti-Semitic]].&quot; In February 1921, the ''[[New York World]]'' published an interview with Ford, in which he said: &quot;The only statement I care to make about the Protocols is that they fit in with what is going on.&quot; During this period, Ford emerged as &quot;a respected spokesman for right-wing extremism and religious prejudice,&quot; reaching around 700,000 readers through his newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;Glock, Charles Y. and Quinley, Harold E. (1983). ''Anti-Semitism in America''. Transaction Publishers. ISBN 0-87855-940-X, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 documentary film ''[[Jews and Baseball: An American Love Story]]'' (written by [[Pulitzer Prize]] winner [[Ira Berkow]]) noted that Ford wrote on May 22, 1920: “If fans wish to know the trouble with American baseball they have it in three words—too much Jew.”&lt;ref name=&quot;nyblueprint1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nyblueprint.com/articles/view.aspx?id=824|title=Jews and Baseball Is A Film You Should Catch|first=Alan|last=Zeitlin|publisher=The New York Blueprint|date=2010-11-15|accessdate=2010-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horn|first=Jordana|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/133023/|title=Coming Out Of Left Field; How the Jews Love Baseball|work=[[The Forward]]|date=2010-11-10|accessdate=2010-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=B3wX21fXD-QC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;lpg=PA45&amp;dq=%22too+much+jew%22+henry+ford#v=onepage&amp;q=%22too%20much%20jew%22%20henry%20ford&amp;f=false|author=Stephen A.

In Germany, Ford's anti-Semitic articles from ''The Dearborn Independent'' were issued in four volumes, cumulatively titled ''[[The International Jew|The International Jew, the World's Foremost Problem]]'' published by [[Theodor Fritsch]], founder of several anti-Semitic parties and a member of the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]. In a letter written in 1924, [[Heinrich Himmler]] described Ford as &quot;one of our most valuable, important, and witty fighters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pfal-Traughber|first=Armin|title=Der antisemitisch-antifreimaurerische Verschwörungsmythos in der Weimarer Republik und im NS-Staat|year=1993|publisher=Braumüller|location=Vienna|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford is the only American mentioned in ''[[Mein Kampf]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''Mein Kampf'', p. 639&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baldwin, p. 181&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adolf Hitler]] wrote, &quot;only a single great man, Ford, [who], to [the Jews'] fury, still maintains full independence...[from] the controlling masters of the producers in a nation of one hundred and twenty millions.&quot; Speaking in 1931 to a ''[[Detroit News]]'' reporter, Hitler said he regarded Ford as his &quot;inspiration,&quot; explaining his reason for keeping Ford's life-size portrait next to his desk.&lt;ref name='WP'/&gt; [[Steven Watts]] wrote that Hitler &quot;revered&quot; Ford, proclaiming that &quot;I shall do my best to put his theories into practice in Germany,&quot; and modeling the [[Volkswagen]], the people's car, on the Model T.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Service Cross of the German Eagle.png|thumb|150px|left|[[Grand Cross of the German Eagle]], an award bestowed on Ford by Nazi Germany]]
On February 1, 1924, Ford received [[Kurt Ludecke]], a representative of Hitler, at home. Ludecke was introduced to Ford by [[Siegfried Wagner]] (son of the composer [[Richard Wagner]]) and his wife [[Winifred Wagner|Winifred]], both [[Nazi]] sympathizers and anti-Semites. Ludecke asked Ford for a contribution to the Nazi cause, but was apparently refused.&lt;ref&gt;Max Wallace ''The American Axis: Henry Ford, Charles Lindbergh, and the Rise of the Third Reich'', (Macmillan, 2004), pp.50–54, ISBN 0-312-33531-8. Years later, in 1977, Winifred claimed that Ford had told her that he had helped finance Hitler. This anecdote is the suggestion that Ford made a contribution. The company has always denied that any contribution was made, and no documentary evidence has ever been found. ''Ibid'' p. 54. See also [[Neil Baldwin]], ''Henry Ford and the Jews: The Mass Production of Hate'', (Public Affairs, 2002), pp. 185–89, ISBN 1-58648-163-0.&lt;/ref&gt;

While Ford's articles were denounced by the [[Anti-Defamation League]] (ADL), the articles explicitly condemned [[Pogram|pogroms]] and violence against Jews (Volume 4, Chapter 80), but blamed the Jews for provoking incidents of mass violence.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Henry (2003). ''The International Jew: The World's Foremost Problem''. Kessinger Publishing. ISBN 0-7661-7829-3, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; None of this work was written by Ford, but he allowed his name to be used as author. According to trial testimony, he wrote almost nothing. Friends and business associates have said they warned Ford about the contents of the ''Independent'' and that he probably never read the articles. (He claimed he only read the headlines.)&lt;ref&gt;Watts pp x, 376–387; Lewis (1976) pp 135–59.&lt;/ref&gt; However, court testimony in a [[libel]] suit, brought by one of the targets of the newspaper, alleged that Ford did know about the contents of the ''Independent'' in advance of publication.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace&quot;/&gt;

The libel lawsuit, which was brought by San Francisco lawyer and Jewish farm cooperative organizer [[Aaron Sapiro]] in response to anti-Semitic remarks, led Ford to close the ''Independent'' in December 1927. News reports at the time quoted him as saying he was shocked by the content and unaware of its nature. During the trial, the editor of Ford's &quot;Own Page,&quot; William Cameron, testified that Ford had nothing to do with the editorials even though they were under his byline. Cameron testified at the libel trial that he never discussed the content of the pages or sent them to Ford for his approval.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, (1976) pp. 140–56; Baldwin p 220–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Investigative journalist [[Max Wallace]] noted that &quot;whatever credibility this absurd claim may have had was soon undermined when James M. Miller, a former ''Dearborn Independent'' employee, swore under oath that Ford had told him he intended to expose Sapiro.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Max. (2003). ''The American Axis: Ford, Lindbergh, and the Rise of the Third Reich''. New York: St. Martin's Press. p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Barkun]] observed, &lt;blockquote&gt;That Cameron would have continued to publish such anti-Semitic material without Ford's explicit instructions seemed unthinkable to those who knew both men. Mrs. Stanley Ruddiman, a Ford family intimate, remarked that 'I don't think Mr. Cameron ever wrote anything for publication without Mr. Ford's approval.'&lt;ref&gt;Barkun, Michael (1996). ''Religion and the Racist Right: The Origins of the Christian Identity Movement''. UNC Press. ISBN 0-8078-4638-4, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to Spencer Blakeslee,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ADL mobilized prominent Jews and non-Jews to publicly oppose Ford's message. They formed a coalition of Jewish groups for the same purpose and raised constant objections in the Detroit press. Before leaving his presidency early in 1921, [[Woodrow Wilson]] joined other leading Americans in a statement that rebuked Ford and others for their anti-Semitic campaign. A boycott against Ford products by Jews and liberal Christians also had an impact, and Ford shut down the paper in 1927, recanting his views in a public letter to [[Sigmund Livingston]], ADL.&lt;ref&gt;Blakeslee, Spencer (2000). ''The Death of American Antisemitism''. Praeger/Greenwood. ISBN 0-275-96508-2, p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wallace also found that Ford's apology was likely, at least partly, motivated by a business that was slumping as result of his anti-Semitism repelling potential buyers of Ford cars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace&quot;/&gt; Up until the apology, a considerable number of dealers, who had been required to make sure that buyers of Ford cars received the ''Independent'', bought up and destroyed copies of the newspaper rather than alienate customers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wallace&quot;/&gt;

Ford's 1927 apology was well received. &quot;Four-Fifths of the hundreds of letters addressed to Ford in July 1927 were from Jews, and almost without exception they praised the Industrialist.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;{{Cite book|first=David I.|last=Lewis|title=The Public Image of Henry Ford: An American Folk Hero and His Company|publisher=Wayne State University Press|year=1976|isbn=0-8143-1553-4}}, pp. 146–154.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1937, a Ford statement to the ''Detroit Jewish Chronicle'' disavowed &quot;any connection whatsoever with the publication in Germany of a book known as the ''International Jew''.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;

In July 1938, prior to the outbreak of war, the German consul at [[Cleveland]] gave Ford, on his 75th birthday, the award of the [[Grand Cross of the German Eagle]], the highest medal Nazi Germany could bestow on a foreigner.&lt;ref name='WP'&gt;{{cite news|title=Ford and GM Scrutinized for Alleged Nazi Collaboration|date=November 30, 1998|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/nov98/nazicars30.htm|work=Washington Post|pages=A01|accessdate=March 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; James D. Mooney, vice-president of overseas operations for [[General Motors]], received a similar medal, the Merit Cross of the German Eagle, First Class.&lt;ref name='WP'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farber, David R. (2002). ''Sloan Rules: Alfred P. Sloan and the Triumph of General Motors''. University of Chicago Press, ISBN 0-226-23804-0, p. 228.&lt;/ref&gt;

Distribution of ''International Jew'' was halted in 1942 through legal action by Ford, despite complications from a lack of copyright.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt; It is still banned in Germany. Extremist groups often recycle the material; it still appears on [[antisemitic]] and [[neo-Nazi]] websites.

One Jewish public figure who was said to have been friendly with Ford was Detroit Judge [[Harry Keidan]]. When asked about this connection, Ford replied that Keidan was only half-Jewish.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} A close collaborator of Ford during [[World War II]] reported that Ford, at the time over 80 years old, was shown a movie of the [[Nazi concentration camps]] and was horrified by the atrocities documented in it.&lt;ref&gt;Lacey, Robert (1987). ''Ford: Des Hommes et des Machines'', Libre Expression editor, ISBN 2-89111-335-7, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

The damage, however, had been done. Testifying at [[Nuremberg Trials|Nuremberg]], convicted [[Hitler Youth]] leader [[Baldur von Schirach]] who, in his role as military governor of [[Vienna]] deported 65,000 Jews to camps in Poland, stated,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The decisive anti-Semitic book I was reading and the book that influenced my comrades was [...] that book by Henry Ford, &quot;The International Jew.&quot; I read it and became anti-Semitic. The book made a great influence on myself and my friends because we saw in Henry Ford the representative of success and also the representative of a progressive social policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Baldur von Schirach before the International Military Tribunal at Nuremburg|date=May 23, 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=See German Wikipedia for the untranslated version|url=http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Der_internationale_Jude}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==International business==
Ford's philosophy was one of economic independence for the United States. His River Rouge Plant became the world's largest industrial complex, pursuing [[vertical integration]] to such an extent that it could produce its own steel. Ford's goal was to produce a vehicle from scratch without reliance on foreign trade. He believed in the global expansion of his company. He believed that international trade and cooperation led to international peace, and he used the assembly line process and production of the Model T to demonstrate it.&lt;ref&gt;Watts 236–40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Fordslindbergh.jpg|thumb|[[Edsel Ford]], [[Charles Lindbergh]], and Henry Ford pose in the Ford hangar during Lindbergh's August 1927 visit.]]
He opened Ford assembly plants in Britain and Canada in 1911, and soon became the biggest automotive producer in those countries. In 1912, Ford cooperated with [[Giovanni Agnelli]] of [[Fiat]] to launch the first Italian automotive assembly plants. The first plants in Germany were built in the 1920s with the encouragement of [[Herbert Hoover]] and the Commerce Department, which agreed with Ford's theory that international trade was essential to world peace.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s, Ford also opened plants in Australia, India, and France, and by 1929, he had successful dealerships on six continents. Ford experimented with a commercial rubber plantation in the [[Amazon Rainforest|Amazon]] jungle called [[Fordlândia]]; it was one of his few failures. In 1929, Ford accepted [[Joseph Stalin]]'s invitation to build a model plant (NNAZ, today [[GAZ]]) at Gorky, a city now known under its historical name [[Nizhny Novgorod]]. He sent American engineers and technicians to the Soviet Union to help set it up,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sorensen1956pp193-216&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=193–216}}.&lt;/ref&gt; including future labor leader [[Walter Reuther]].&lt;ref&gt;Nevins and Hill (1957) 2:673-83&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ford Motor Company had the policy of doing business in any nation where the United States had diplomatic relations. It set up numerous subsidiaries that sold cars and trucks and sometimes assembled them:

By 1932, Ford was manufacturing one third of all the world’s automobiles. Ford's image transfixed Europeans, especially the Germans, arousing the &quot;fear of some, the infatuation of others, and the fascination among all&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Germans who discussed &quot;Fordism&quot; often believed that it represented something quintessentially American. They saw the size, tempo, standardization, and philosophy of production demonstrated at the Ford Works as a national service—an &quot;American thing&quot; that represented the [[culture of United States]]. Both supporters and critics insisted that Fordism epitomized American capitalist development, and that the auto industry was the key to understanding economic and social relations in the United States. As one German explained, &quot;Automobiles have so completely changed the American's mode of life that today one can hardly imagine being without a car. It is difficult to remember what life was like before Mr. Ford began preaching his doctrine of salvation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nolan, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; For many Germans, Ford embodied the essence of successful Americanism.

In ''My Life and Work'', Ford predicted that if greed, racism, and short-sightedness could be overcome, then economic and technological development throughout the world would progress to the point that international trade would no longer be based on (what today would be called) colonial or [[neocolonialism|neocolonial]] models and would truly benefit all peoples.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ford_Crowther_1922_pp242-244&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [http://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA242#v=onepage&amp;f=false pp. 242–244].&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas in this passage were vague, but they were idealistic.

==Racing==
[[File:Henry Ford and Barney Oldfield with Old 999, 1902.jpg|thumb|Ford (standing) launched [[Barney Oldfield]]'s career in 1902]]

Ford maintained an interest in auto racing from 1901 to 1913 and began his involvement in the sport as both a builder and a driver, later turning the wheel over to hired drivers. He entered stripped-down [[Model T]]s in races, finishing first (although later disqualified) in an &quot;ocean-to-ocean&quot; (across the United States) race in 1909, and setting a one-mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) oval speed record at Detroit Fairgrounds in 1911 with driver Frank Kulick. In 1913, Ford attempted to enter a reworked Model T in the [[Indianapolis 500]] but was told rules required the addition of another 1,000 pounds (450&amp;nbsp;kg) to the car before it could qualify. Ford dropped out of the race and soon thereafter dropped out of racing permanently, citing dissatisfaction with the sport's rules, demands on his time by the booming production of the Model Ts, and his low opinion of racing as a worthwhile activity.

In ''My Life and Work'' Ford speaks (briefly) of racing in a rather dismissive tone, as something that is not at all a good measure of automobiles in general. He describes himself as someone who raced only because in the 1890s through 1910s, one had to race because prevailing ignorance held that racing was the way to prove the worth of an automobile. Ford did not agree. But he was determined that as long as this was the definition of success (flawed though the definition was), then his cars would be the best that there were at racing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ford_Crowther_1922_p50&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|Crowther|1922}}, [http://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA50#v=onepage&amp;f=false p. 50].&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the book, he continually returns to ideals such as transportation, production efficiency, affordability, reliability, fuel efficiency, economic prosperity, and the automation of drudgery in farming and industry, but rarely mentions, and rather belittles, the idea of merely going fast from point A to point B.

Nevertheless, Ford did make quite an impact on auto racing during his racing years, and he was inducted into the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 1996.

==Later career==
When Edsel, president of Ford Motor Company, died of cancer in May 1943, the elderly and ailing Henry Ford decided to assume the presidency. By this point in his life, he had had several cardiovascular events (variously cited as heart attack or stroke) and was mentally inconsistent, suspicious, and generally no longer fit for such a job.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sorensen1956pp100_266_et_al&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=100,266,271–272,310–314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the directors did not want to see him as president. But for the previous 20 years, though he had long been without any official executive title, he had always had ''de facto'' control over the company; the board and the management had never seriously defied him, and this moment was not different. The directors elected him,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sorensen1956pp325–326&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956|pp=325–26}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and he served until the end of the war. During this period the company began to decline, losing more than $10&amp;nbsp;million a month (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|10000000|1943|r=-4}}}} a month today). The administration of President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] had been considering a government takeover of the company in order to ensure continued war production,&lt;ref name=&quot;Sorensen1956pp324–333&quot; /&gt; but the idea never progressed.

[[Image:Henry Ford grave Ford Cemetery Detroit.JPG|thumb|150px|right|Ford grave, Ford Cemetery]]
In ill health, Ford ceded the presidency to his grandson [[Henry Ford II]] in September 1945 and went into retirement. He died in 1947 of a [[cerebral hemorrhage]] at age 83 in [[Fair Lane]], his Dearborn estate. A public viewing was held at Greenfield Village where up to 5,000 people per hour filed past the casket. Funeral services were held in Detroit's [[Cathedral Church of St. Paul, Detroit|Cathedral Church of St. Paul]] and he was buried in the Ford Cemetery in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|coauthors=|title=Leader in Production Founded Vast Empire in Motors in 1903.

&lt;!--On the night of his death, the [[River Rouge (Michigan)|River Rouge]] had flooded the local power station and had left Ford's house without electricity. Before going to sleep, Henry and his wife lit candles and oil lamps to light the house. Later that evening, just before dawn, he died.--&gt;

==Sidelights==
===Interest in materials science and engineering===
Henry Ford long had an interest in [[Materials science|materials science and engineering]]. He enthusiastically described his company's adoption of vanadium steel alloys and subsequent metallurgic R&amp;D work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ford1922pp18_65-67&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|1922}}, pp. [http://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA18#v=onepage&amp;f=false 18],[http://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA65#v=onepage&amp;f=false 65–67].&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford long had an interest in plastics developed from agricultural products, especially [[soybean]]s. He cultivated a relationship with [[George Washington Carver]] for this purpose.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Soybean-based plastics were used in Ford automobiles throughout the 1930s in plastic parts such as car horns, in paint, etc. This project culminated in 1942, when Ford [[Soybean Car|patented an automobile made almost entirely of plastic]], attached to a tubular welded frame. It weighed 30% less than a steel car and was said to be able to withstand blows ten times greater than could steel. Furthermore, it ran on grain alcohol ([[ethanol]]) instead of gasoline. The design never caught on.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis1995&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Lewis|1995}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford was interested in [[engineered wood]]s (&quot;Better wood can be made than is grown&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ford1922p281&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|1922}}, [http://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA281#v=onepage&amp;f=false p. 281].&lt;/ref&gt;) (at this time plywood and particle board were little more than experimental ideas); [[Biofuel|corn as a fuel source]], via both corn oil and ethanol;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ford1922pp275-276&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|1922}}, [http://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA275#v=onepage&amp;f=false pp. 275–276].&lt;/ref&gt; and the potential uses of cotton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ford1922p281&quot; /&gt; Ford was instrumental in developing charcoal [[Briquette|briquets]], under the brand name &quot;[[Kingsford (charcoal)|Kingsford]]&quot;. His brother in law, [[E.G. Kingsford]], used wood scraps from the Ford factory to make the briquets.

Ford was a [[List of prolific inventors|prolific inventor]] and was awarded 161 U.S. patents.

===Georgia residence and community===
Ford maintained a vacation residence (known as the &quot;Ford Plantation&quot;) in [[Richmond Hill, Georgia|Richmond Hill]], Georgia. He contributed substantially to the community, building a chapel and schoolhouse and employing numerous local residents.

===Preserving Americana===
Ford had an interest in &quot;[[Americana]]&quot;. In the 1920s, Ford began work to turn [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]], Massachusetts, into a themed historical village. He moved the schoolhouse supposedly referred to in the nursery rhyme, &quot;[[Mary had a little lamb]]&quot;, from [[Sterling, Massachusetts|Sterling]], Massachusetts, and purchased the historic [[Wayside Inn]]. This plan never saw fruition. Ford repeated the concept of collecting historic structures with the creation of [[Greenfield Village]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], Michigan. It may have inspired the creation of [[Old Sturbridge Village]] as well. About the same time, he began collecting materials for his museum, which had a theme of practical technology. It was opened in 1929 as the Edison Institute. Although greatly modernized, the museum continues today.

===On the idea that he invented the automobile===
Henry Ford did not invent the automobile, as is occasionally believed. Indeed, he began as a race driver of other people's cars. As Ford himself noted, by the 1870s, the notion of a &quot;horseless carriage was a common idea&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ford1922p25&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ford|1922}}, [http://books.google.com/books?id=4K82efXzn10C&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;f=false p. 25]&lt;/ref&gt; Many people worked toward the idea, as the [[history of steam road vehicles]] and [[history of the automobile|of automobiles]] shows. Ford was, however, more influential than any other single person in changing the paradigm of the automobile from a very expensive, heavy, hand-built toy for rich people into a lightweight, reliable, affordable, mass-produced mode of transportation for working-class people.

===On the idea that he invented the assembly line===
Both Ford and [[Ransom E. Olds]] are sometimes credited with the invention of the assembly line, although (as is the case with many inventions) the assembly line's development included many inventors. It combined the idea of [[interchangeable parts]] (another gradual technological development that is often mistakenly attributed to one individual or another). After 5 years of empirical development, Ford's first moving assembly line (employing conveyor belts) began mass production on or around April 1, 1913. The concept was first applied to subassemblies, and shortly after to the entire chassis. Although it is inaccurate to say that Ford personally invented the assembly line, his sponsorship of its development and use was central to its explosive success in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sorensen|1956}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hounshell|1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miscellaneous===
{{trivia|date=November 2012}}
Ford was the winner of the award of [[Car Entrepreneur of the Century]] in 1999.

Ford published a book, circulated to youth in 1914, called &quot;The Case Against the Little White Slaver&quot; which documented many dangers of cigarette smoking attested to by many researchers and luminaries.&lt;ref&gt;The Case Against the Little White Slaver
 http://medicolegal.tripod.com/ford1914.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford dressed up as [[Santa Claus]] and gave sleigh rides to children at Christmas time on his estate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ford-Bio-A&amp;E&quot;/&gt;

A compendium of short biographies of famous [[Freemasonry|Freemasons]], published by a Freemason lodge, lists Ford as a member.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denslow2004p62&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Denslow|2004|p=62}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ford was especially fond of [[Thomas Edison]], and on Edison's deathbed, he demanded Edison's son catch his final breath in a test tube. The test tube can still be found today in [[Henry Ford Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://corpse.org/issue_1/palmer.html Exquisite Corpse&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Ford's pastor, and head of his sociology department, Episcopal minister Samuel S. Marquis, claimed that Ford believed, or &quot;once believed,&quot; in [[reincarnation]].&lt;ref&gt;Marquis, Samuel S. ([1923]/2007). Henry Ford: An Interpretation. ''Wayne State University Press.''&lt;/ref&gt; Though it is unclear whether or how long Ford kept such a belief, the ''[[San Francisco Examiner]]'' from August 26, 1928, published a quote which described Ford's beliefs:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I adopted the theory of Reincarnation when I was twenty six. Religion offered nothing to the point. Even work could not give me complete satisfaction. Work is futile if we cannot utilise the experience we collect in one life in the next. When I discovered Reincarnation it was as if I had found a universal plan I realised that there was a chance to work out my ideas. Time was no longer limited. I was no longer a slave to the hands of the clock. Genius is experience. Some seem to think that it is a gift or talent, but it is the fruit of long experience in many lives. Some are older souls than others, and so they know more. The discovery of Reincarnation put my mind at ease. If you preserve a record of this conversation, write it so that it puts men’s minds at ease. I would like to communicate to others the calmness that the long view of life gives to us.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His eldest grandson, Henry Ford II, became president on Sept. 21, 1945. Even as Henry Ford II drove the industry's first postwar car off the assembly line, he was making plans to reorganize and decentralize the company to resume its prewar position as a major force in a fiercely competitive auto industry. Henry Ford II provided strong leadership for Ford Motor Company from the postwar era into the 1980s. He was president from 1945 until 1960 and chief executive officer from 1945 until 1979. He was chairman of the board of directors from 1960 until 1980, and remained as chairman of the finance committee from 1980 until his death in 1987. }}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
