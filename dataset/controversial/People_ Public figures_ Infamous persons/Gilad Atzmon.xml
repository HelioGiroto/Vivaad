'''Gilad Atzmon''' ({{lang-he|גלעד עצמון}}; born June 9, 1963) is an [[Israel]]i-born British [[jazz]] [[saxophone|saxophonist]], novelist, political activist and writer.&lt;ref name=&quot;CryFreedom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gilchrist222&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lewis&gt;John Lewis [http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/mar/06/gilad-atzmon-israel-jazz-interview#history-byline &quot;Manic beat preacher&quot;], ''The Guardian'', March 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rizzo&quot;&gt;Mary Rizzo, [http://www.counterpunch.org/atzmon06172005.html &quot;Who's Afraid of Gilad Atzmon?&quot;], [[CounterPunch]], June 17, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Atzmon's album ''Exile'' was BBC jazz album of the year in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;JazzHot&quot;&gt;Gilad Atzmon,[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/music/rockandjazzmusic/3647173/How-jazz-got-hot-again.html How jazz got hot again], ''The Daily Telegraph'', October 13, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Playing over 100 dates a year,&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt; he has been called &quot;surely the hardest-gigging man in British jazz.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Bungey [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/cd_reviews/article5852689.ece &quot;Gilad Atzmon: In Loving Memory of America&quot;,] ''The Times'', March 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; His albums, of which he has recorded thirteen to date,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gilad.co.uk/discography/ Discography] at Gilad Atzmon website.&lt;/ref&gt; often explore the music of the Middle East and political themes. He has described himself as a &quot;devoted political artist.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CryFreedom&quot;&gt;Stuart Nicholson [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200308/ai_n9275160  &quot;Cry freedom&quot;], ''[[The Spectator]]'', August 9, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

A profile in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in 2009 which described Atzmon as &quot;one of London's finest saxophonists&quot; stated: &quot;It is Atzmon's blunt anti-Zionism rather than his music that has given him an international profile, particularly in the Arab world, where his essays are widely read.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt; His criticisms of [[Zionism]], [[Jewish identity]], and [[Judaism]], as well as his controversial views on [[The Holocaust]] and [[Jewish history]] have led to allegations of [[antisemitism]] and [[racism]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/blog/article/1493/gilad-atzmon-supporting-holocaust-deniers-and-spreading-hatr GILAD ATZMON: Supporting Holocaust Deniers and spreading hatred of Jews], [[Hope not Hate]] web site, November 24, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Disavow&gt;{{cite web|title=Palestinian writers, activists disavow racism, anti-Semitism of Gilad Atzmon|url=http://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/palestinian-writers-activists-disavow-racism-anti-semitism-gilad-atzmon|publisher=Electronic Intifada|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; from both [[Zionists]] and [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionists]].

==Early life==
Atzmon was born in a [[secular Jew]]ish family in [[Tel Aviv]], and trained at the [[Jerusalem Academy of Music and Dance|Rubin Academy of Music]] in [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GMF-GA&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

He first became interested in British [[jazz]] when he discovered some in a British record shop in Jerusalem in the 1970s. He initially was inspired by the work of [[Ronnie Scott]] and [[Tubby Hayes]] and regarded London as &quot;the Mecca of Jazz.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JazzHot&quot;/&gt; He also was influenced to become a jazz musician by the work of [[Charlie Parker]], in particular ''[[Charlie Parker with Strings]]'' recorded in 1949. Atzmon said of the album that he &quot;loved the way the music is both beautiful and subversive&amp;nbsp;– the way he basks in the strings but also fights against them.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt; He worked with top bands as a musical producer.&lt;ref&gt;Barnaby Smith, [http://www.tourdates.co.uk/LondonTourdates/issue-007/2007/10/05/222-Sax-With-An-Axe-To-Grind Sax With An Axe To Grind], [http://www.tourdates.co.uk/ London Tour Dates], October 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Atzmon emigrated from Israel to London, where he attended the [[University of Essex]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.essex.ac.uk/news/2007/nr20071214.htm University of Essex news release],
Dec 14, 2007 notes Atzmon is a &quot;graduate&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and earned a Masters degree in Philosophy.&lt;ref name=&quot;CryFreedom&quot;/&gt; He has lived there since then,&lt;ref name=&quot;gilchrist222&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/features/39I-thought-music-could-heal.3804991.jp?CommentPage=1&amp;CommentPageLength=1000|title='I thought music could heal the wounds of the past.

==Music==
While Atzmon's main instrument is the [[alto saxophone]], he also plays [[soprano saxophone|soprano]], [[tenor saxophone|tenor]] and [[baritone saxophone]]s and [[clarinet]], [[Sol (instrument)|sol]], [[zurna]] and [[flute]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GMF-GA&quot; /&gt; Atzmon's jazz style has been described as [[bebop]]/[[hard bop]], with forays into [[free jazz]] and [[Swing music|swing]], and seemingly inspired by [[John Coltrane]] and [[Miles Davis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RainLore bio&quot; /&gt; Atzmon sometimes plays the alto and soprano sax simultaneously.&lt;ref name=&quot;RainLore bio&quot; /&gt;

Atzmon's works have also explored the music of the Middle East, [[North Africa]], and [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Atzmonhomepage&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Atzmon told ''The Guardian'' that he draws on [[Arabic music]] which he says cannot be notated like western music but must be internalised, which he calls &quot;reverting to the primacy of the ear&quot;. Atzmon's musical method has been to play with notions of cultural identity, flirting with genres such as tango and klezmer as well as various Arabic, Balkan, Gypsy and Ladino folk forms. Atzmon's recordings deliberately differ from his live shows. &quot;I don't think that anyone can sit in a house, at home, and listen to me play a full-on bebop solo. It's too intense. My albums need to be less manic.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;

===Collaborations and groups===
Atzmon joined the veteran [[punk rock]] band [[Ian Dury and the Blockheads]] in 1998, and continued with The Blockheads after Dury's death.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Robb, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6253257.stm &quot;The old Blockheads shows go on&quot;], [[BBC News]], January 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sara Greek, [http://www.hertfordshiremercury.co.uk/Whats-On-Leisure/Music/Blockheads-come-to-Hertford-Corn-Exchange-28102011.htm Blockheads come to Hertford Corn Exchange], [[Hertfordshire Mercury]], October 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He also has recorded and performed with [[Shane McGowan]], [[Robbie Williams]], [[Sinéad O'Connor]], [[Robert Wyatt]] and [[Paul McCartney]].&lt;ref name=&quot;GMF-GA&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atzmonhomepage&quot; /&gt; He has recorded two albums with Robert Wyatt, who describes him as &quot;one of the few musical geniuses I've ever met&quot;.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;

Atzmon has collaborated, recorded and performed with musicians from all around the world, including the Palestinian singer, [[Reem Kelani]], Tunisian singer and [[oud]] player [[Dhafer Youssef]], violinist [[Marcel Mamaliga]], accordion player [[Romano Viazzani]], bassist [[Yaron Stavi]], violinist and trumpet-violin player, [[Dumitru Ovidiu Fratila]], and [[Guillermo Rozenthuler]] on vocals.&lt;ref name=&quot;RainLore bio&quot; /&gt;

Atzmon founded the Orient House Ensemble band in London in 2000 with [[Asaf Sirkis]] on drums, Frank Harrison on piano and Oli  Hayhurst on bass.  In 2003 Yaron Stavi replaced Hayhurst. In 2009 Eddie Hick replaced Sirkis.&lt;ref name=Ensemble&gt;[http://www.gilad.co.uk/the-orient-house-ensemble/ Orient House Ensemble description at Gilad Atzmon home page.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Fordham, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/oct/14/asaf-sirkis-letting-go-review Asaf Sirkis Trio: Letting Go – review], [[The Guardian]],  October 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  The group was named after [[Orient House]], the former [[East Jerusalem]] headquarters of the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], later seized by the [[Israeli Defense Forces]].&lt;ref name=Searle&gt;Chris Searle, [http://www.morningstaronline.co.uk/index.php/news/content/view/full/97593 Gilad Atzmon and The Orient House Ensemble], [[Morning Star (UK newspaper)]], November 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Massarik, [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-140930139.html Gilad Atzmon and the Orient House Ensemble], [[Evening Standard]],  January 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The band has produced eight albums. Orient House celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2010, announcing a 40-date tour and a new album.&lt;ref name=Searle/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fordham&gt;John Fordham, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/oct/05/gilad-atzmon-orient-house-ensemble-review Gilad Atzmon Orient House Ensemble - review], [[The Guardian]], October 5, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Wyatt]], who has said that Atzmon combines &quot;great artistry with a sense of the intrinsically non-racialist philosophy that's implicit in jazz,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lester Paul [http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/jun/26/best-band-rock-pop &quot;So who is top of the pops&quot;], ''[[The Guardian]]'', June 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; worked with Atzmon and others on his 2007 album [[Comercopia]] .&lt;ref&gt;Chris Jones, [http://www.bbc.co.uk/music/reviews/gwcz A national treasure makes another peerless album], [[BBC]], October 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Wyatt collaborated with Atzmon and Ros Stephens, as well as lyricist [[Alfreda Benge]], on the 2010 album ''For the Ghosts Within'', released on [[Domino Records]].&lt;ref&gt;Andy Gill, [http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/album-wyatt--atzmon--stephen-for-the-ghosts-within-domino-2102994.html Album: Wyatt, Atzmon, Stephen, For The Ghosts Within (Domino)], [[The Independent]], October 8, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alex Hudson, [http://www.exclaim.ca/articles/generalarticlesynopsfullart.aspx?csid1=145&amp;csid2=844&amp;fid1=47938 &quot;Robert Wyatt Unveils New Collaborative Album&quot;], [[Exclaim!]], July 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Atzmon produced and arranged 2 albums for British-American singer songwriter [[Sarah Gillespie]] ''Stalking Juliet ''(2009) and ''In The Current Climate ''(2011). Both albums were critically acclaimed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;John Fordham [http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/apr/10/sarah-gillespie-stalking-juliet-review &quot;Stalking Juliet review&quot;], ''The Guardian'', 10 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mail&quot;&gt;[http://sarahgillespie.com/reviews/the-mail-on-sunday/ Mail on Sunday, In The Current Climate review - January 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Atzmon tours extensively as part of Sarah Gillespie's band, playing saxophone, clarinet and accordion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metro&quot;&gt;[http://www.metro.co.uk/music/852007-jazz-your-cd-collection-up &quot;Robert Shaw, Guitarist Keeps Her Finger on the Pulse&quot;], ''Metro'', 6 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Atzmon is on the creative panel of the [[Global Music Foundation]],&lt;ref name=&quot;GMF-GA&quot; /&gt; a non-profit organization formed in December 2004 which runs residential educational and performance workshops and events in different countries around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;GMF&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Reviews===
Atzmon and his ensemble have received favorable reviews from ''[[Hi-Fi World]]'', ''[[Financial Times]]'', ''[[The Scotsman]]'', ''[[Birmingham Post]]'', ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' and ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gilad.co.uk/ Gilad Atzmon web site].&lt;/ref&gt; Reviews of his 2007 album ''Refuge'' included:
:''[[Manchester Evening News]]'': &quot;The individuality of the music is extraordinary. No one is more willing to serve his music with raw political passion, and that curious [[Hazzan|cantor]]-like tone on clarinet is immediately arresting, like [[Artie Shaw]] writhing in his death throes.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Alan Brownlee, [http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/entertainment/music/world_music/s/1015/1015003_gilad_atzmon__the_orient_house_ensemble__refuge_enja.html Gilad Atzmon &amp; The Orient House Ensemble&amp;nbsp;– Refuge (Enja)], [[Manchester Evening News]], August 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009 ''[[The Guardian]]'' jazz critic [[John Fordham]] reviewed Atzmon's newest album ''In loving memory of America'' which was described by Atzmon as &quot;a memory of America I had cherished in my mind for many years&quot;. It includes five standards and six originals &quot;inspired by the sumptuous harmonies and impassioned sax-playing of [[Charlie Parker|(Charlie) Parker]]'s late-40s recordings with classical strings&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;John Fordham, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2009/feb/27/gilad-atzmon-loving-memory-america &quot;Gilad Atzmon: In Loving Memory of America&quot;], ''[[The Guardian]]'', February 27, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

While the music journalist John Lewis praises much of Atzmon's work, he notes that &quot;trenchant politics often sit uneasily alongside music, particularly when that music is instrumental&quot;. Lewis criticized his 2006 comedy klezmer project, ''Artie Fishel and the Promised Band'', as &quot;a clumsy satire on what he regards as the artificial nature of Jewish identity politics.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;

===Awards===
Atzmon was the recipient of the [[HMV]] Top Dog Award at the [[Birmingham International Jazz Festival]] in 1996–1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;RainLore bio&quot; /&gt; Gilad Atzmon's ''Exile'' was [[BBC]] jazz album of the year in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/entertainment/3107607.stm Jazz winners span generations], [[BBC]], July 30, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activism==

Gilad Atzmon's service as a [[paramedic]] in the [[Israeli Defense Forces]] during the [[1982 Lebanon War]] caused him to conclude that &quot;I was part of a colonial state, the result of plundering and [[1948 Palestinian exodus|ethnic cleansing]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;St. Clair&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;/&gt; He told an interviewer that it was there he first learned about Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, [[Israeli land and property laws|legislation to prevent their return]], and the wiping out of Palestinian villages. “We were indoctrinated into a denial of the Palestinian Cause. We were not aware of it.”&lt;ref name=Panayides&gt;Theo Panayides, [http://www.cyprus-mail.com/living/wandering-jazz-player/20100221 Wandering jazz player], [[Cyprus Mail]], February 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has condemned “Jewishness” as &quot;very much a supremacist, racist tendency&quot;. He states that &quot;I don't have anything against Jews in particular and you won't find that in my writings.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gilchrist222&quot;/&gt; Regarding the one-state solution, Atzmon concedes that such a state probably would be controlled by [[Islamist]]s, but says, &quot;That's their business.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt;

Atzmon has compared the Jewish Ideology to that of the [[Nazis]] and has described Israel's policy toward the Palestinians as [[genocide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gibson&quot;/&gt; [[David Hirst (journalist)|David Hirst]], in his 2003 book ''The Gun and the Olive Branch,'' quotes Atzmon as saying America was “about to lose its sovereignty...becoming a remote colony of an apparently far greater state, the Jewish state.”&lt;ref&gt;David Hirst, ''The Gun and the Olive Branch: the roots of violence in the Middle East,'' Nation Books,  2003, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Oisa_1Dc69kC&amp;pg=PA49&amp;dq=gun+and+olive+branch+atzmon&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZgdFTM-YAsP98Abntc3aAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false p.  49]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 [[Turkey|Turkish]] prime minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] cited Atzmon's written comment &quot;Israeli barbarity is far beyond even ordinary cruelty&quot; during a debate with Israeli president [[Shimon Peres]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;/&gt;

===Novels===
Atzmon's ''[[A Guide to the Perplexed]]'', published in 2001, is set in 2052 when Israel has been replaced by a Palestinian state. It largely reviews memoirs of the alienated Israeli Gunther Wunker’s rise to fame as a &quot;peepologist,&quot; or voyeur. The perplexed are defined as &quot;the unthinking Chosen&quot; who &quot;cling to clods of earth that don't belong to them.&quot; The novel excoriates what it describes as the commercialization of the Holocaust and &quot;argues that the Holocaust is invoked as a kind of reflexive propaganda designed to shield the Zionist state from responsibility for any transgression against Palestinians.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;St. Clair&quot;/&gt; A reviewer for ''[[The Independent]]'' wrote that &quot;Those who still thrill to the pages of Sixties underground &quot;comix&quot; may find some of this amusing, however laboured. Yet even those semi-sympathetic to its politics will find it cheap and &quot;provocative&quot; in the worst possible sense.&quot; He also wrote that the book has &quot;just enough connection with reality to give it a certain unsettling power&quot; but concludes &quot;His writing, alas, represents a completely false start.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Reisz [http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/a-guide-to-the-perplexed-by-gilad-atzmon-trans-philip-simpson-609999.html A crude – and rude – assault on Israel misfires], ''The Independent'', December 7, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' observed it is &quot;odd to mix knob gags with highly serious assertions&quot; but thought it works because &quot;Atzmon writes with so much style and his gags are so hilarious.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Darren King [http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2003/jan/25/featuresreviews.guardianreview16 Mr. Peepology], ''The Guardian'', January 25, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Publisher's Weekly]]'' noted &quot;Atzmon clearly wants to provoke, but his approach is so familiar that few readers will take the bait.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-85242-826-6 &quot;A Guide to the Perplexed&quot;], [[Publisher's Weekly]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Atzmon's second novel, ''My One and Only Love'' was published in 2005, and features as a protagonist a trumpeter who chooses to play only one note (extremely well) as well as a spy who uncovers Nazi war criminals and locks them inside double bass cases which then tour permanently in the protagonist's orchestra's luggage.&lt;ref&gt;Sholto Byrnes [http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/talking-jazz-529796.html &quot;Talking Jazz&quot;,] ''The Independent'', March 25, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; The book also is comedic take on &quot;Zionist espionage and intrigue&quot; which explores &quot;the personal conflict between being true to one’s heart and being loyal to The Jews&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/cambridgeshire/content/articles/2004/10/01/gilad_event_feature.shtml &quot;Gilad Atzmon's Orient House Ensemble - The JunctionBBC book launch announcement&quot;], BBC Cambridgeshire, June 3, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Wandering Who?''===
In 2011, [[Zero Books]] published Atzmon's book ''The Wandering Who? A Study of Jewish Identity Politics'' whose publisher states the book &quot;examines Jewish identity politics and Jewish contemporary ideology using both popular culture and scholarly texts.&quot;&lt;ref name = WanderingBook&gt;Gilad Atzmon, &quot;The Wandering Who? A Study of Jewish Identity Politics&quot;, Zero books, 2011, ISBN 978-1-84694-875-6&lt;/ref&gt; Five academics, a journalist and an author were quoted in [[blurb]]s in the front of the book. [[John Mearsheimer]] of the [[University of Chicago]] wrote that &quot;Gilad Atzmon has written a fascinating and provocative book on Jewish identity in the modern world&quot; and that the book &quot;should be widely read by Jews and non-Jews alike.&quot; [[Richard Falk]] wrote it was &quot;absorbing and moving&quot; book that everyone who &quot;care[s] about real peace&quot; should &quot;not only read, but reflect upon and discuss widely.&quot; [[James Petras]] wrote that the book is &quot;a series of brilliant illuminations and critical reflections on Jewish ethnocentrism and the hypocrisy of those who speak in the name of universal values and act tribal&quot; which &quot;uncovers the links between Jewish identity politics in the Diaspora with their ardent support for the oppressive policies of the Israeli state.&quot; He also wrote that Atzmon “has the courage to...speak truth to the power of highly placed and affluent Zionists who shape the agendas of war and peace in the English-speaking world.&quot;&lt;ref name = WanderingBook/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gilad.co.uk/the-wandering-who/2011/9/30/endorsements-for-gilad-atzmons-the-wandering-who.html “Endorsements” of The Wandering Who from the book] on Gilad Atzmon web site.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten anti-Zionist authors, including [[Laurie Penny]] and [[Richard Seymour (writer)|Richard Seymour]], all of whom have also been published by [[Zero Books]], publicly condemned the publisher in an open letter for releasing the book.&lt;ref name=newrepublic/&gt; They signed a statement arguing:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The thrust of Atzmon’s work is to normalise and legitimise anti-Semitism. We do not believe that Zero’s decision to publish this book is malicious. Atzmon’s ability to solicit endorsements from respectable figures such as Richard Falk and John Mearsheimer shows that he is adept at muddying the waters both on his own views and on the question of anti-Semitism. But at a time when dangerous forces are attempting to racialise political antagonisms, we think the decision is grossly mistaken.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leninology.blogspot.com/2011/09/zero-authors-statement-on-gilad-atzmon.html|title=Zero Authors Statement on Gilad Atzmon|publisher=Lenin's Tomb|date=Setempber 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In ''[[The Atlantic]]'' [[Jeffrey Goldberg]] quoted Atzmon on the Holocaust, Jewish “persecution of Hitler” and Jewish “trafficking in body parts” and took John Mearsheimer to task for “endorsing the writing of a man who espouses neo-Nazi views.”&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Goldberg, [http://www.theatlantic.com/national/archive/2011/09/john-mearsheimer-endorses-a-hitler-apologist-and-holocaust-revisionist/245518/ John Mearsheimer Endorses a Hitler Apologist and Holocaust Revisionist], [[The Atlantic]], September 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Mearsheimer replied via his co-author professor [[Stephen Walt]]’s blog that “There is no question that the book is provocative, both in terms of its central argument and the overly hot language that Atzmon sometimes uses. But it is also filled with interesting insights that make the reader think long and hard about an important subject. Of course, I do not agree with everything that he says in the book -- what blurber does?”&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Walt, [http://walt.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/09/25/mearsheimer_responds_to_goldbergs_latest_smear Mearsheimer responds to Goldberg's latest smear], [[Foreign Policy]], September 26, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Dershowitz]] wrote a critical opinion piece arguing that “some of Israel’s most vocal detractors are crossing a red line between acceptable criticism of Israel and legitimizing anti-Semitism.” Dershowitz uses numerous quotes from the book to support his position that Atzmon is an antisemite who states Jews seek to control the world, conflates “the Jew” and “the Zionist”, writes that Jews are evil and a menace to humanity, encourages readers to doubt the Holocaust and Jewish history, and holds that &quot;Jews are corrupt and responsible for ‘why’ they are ‘hated’ and that Israel is worse than the Nazis.&quot; Dershowitz argues that “Even the most radical anti-Zionists in England have distanced themselves from Atzmon.” He writes that “hard-core neo-Nazis, racists, anti-Semites and Holocaust deniers” endorse Atzmon, including [[David Duke]], [[Kevin B. MacDonald]] and [[Israel Shamir]].&lt;ref name=newrepublic&gt;[http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/97030/atzmon-wandering-who-anti-semitism-israel Why are John Mearsheimer and Richard Falk Endorsing a Blatantly Anti-Semitic Book?] by Alan Dershowitz, The New Republic, November 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

He criticizes John Mearsheimer and Richard Falk for endorsing the book and encouraging colleagues, students, and others to read and “reflect upon” Atzmon’s views. He also criticizes other academics who have defended Atzmon, including [[Brian Leiter]], William A. Cook, [[Oren Ben-Dor]], and Makram Khoury-Machool. Dershowitz then challenged professors Mearsheimer and Falk to a “public debate about why they have endorsed and said such positive things about so hateful and anti-Semitic a book by so bigoted and dishonest a writer.”&lt;ref name=newrepublic/&gt; Falk rejected Dershowitz' call to debate and wrote to ''[[The Daily Caller]]'' “I have a limited taste for the sort of defamatory polemics that the Dershowitz attack mounts.” He wrote that &quot;if the book is fairly read, and not denounced, it is concerned exclusively with ‘Jewish identity,’ not with Jews, and explores this reality in a highly personal, passionate, provocative, and honest manner.”&lt;ref name = DailyCaller&gt;[http://dailycaller.com/2011/11/09/princeton-prof-turns-down-dershowitz-challenge/ Princeton prof turns down Dershowitz challenge], ''The Daily Caller'', November 9, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of antisemitism and racism==
John Lewis writes that Atzmon's anti-Jewish rhetoric has created many foes for Atzmon,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;/&gt; even onetime associates. Some Palestinian activists see his statements as discrediting their cause,&lt;ref name=&quot;Newman&quot;&gt;Andy Newman [http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/sep/25/gilad-atzmon-antisemitism-the-left?newsfeed=true &quot;Gilad Atzmon, antisemitism and the left&quot;], ''[[The Guardian]]'', September 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; while the British [[Socialist Workers' Party (Britain)|Socialist Workers Party]], which at one time regularly invited him to their annual Marxism event, now distances itself from Atzmon.&lt;ref name=Lewis/&gt; 

Several of Atzmon's statements regarding [[Jews]] and [[Judaism]] have led to allegations of [[antisemitism]].  In 2004 the [[Board of Deputies of British Jews]] criticized Atzmon for saying, &quot;I'm not going to say whether it is right or not to burn down a synagogue, I can see that it is a rational act.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ges2004&quot;&gt;Curtis, Polly.

This does not make it right.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gilad Atzmon, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2005/apr/24/letters.theobserver Letters to the Editor], ''The Observer'', April 4, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 piece [[David Aaronovitch]] criticized Atzmon for writing in his essay &quot;On Anti-Semitism&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;onanti&quot;&gt;Gilad Atzmon, [http://web.archive.org/web/20050213011436/http://www.gilad.co.uk/html%20files/onanti.html On Anti-Semitism], originally at his personal web site, December 20, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; that &quot;We must begin to take the accusation that the Jewish people are trying to control the world very seriously.&quot; and &quot;American Jewry makes any debate on whether the '[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]' are an authentic document or rather a forged irrelevant. American Jews do control the world, by proxy.

Aaronovitch wrote that Atzmon said he had a &quot;slightly different&quot; view than Eisen: &quot;the Holocaust like any other historical narrative is a dynamic process of realisation and interpretation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Aaronovitch&quot;/&gt; Atzmon has said he does not deny the Holocaust or the “Nazi Judeocide” but insists “that both the Holocaust and World War II should be treated as historical events rather than as religious myth. . . . But then, even if we accept the Holocaust as the new Anglo-American liberal-democratic religion, we must allow people to be atheists.”&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Talens, [http://www.redress.btinternet.co.uk/gatzmon14.htm Beauty as a political weapon; Three in one: jazzman, writer and activist&amp;nbsp;– A conversation with Gilad Atzmon], originally published in the Mexican monthly magazine Memoria, No.  202, December 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2006 piece in ''[[The Guardian]]'', [[David Hirsh]] cited Atzmon's &quot;On Anti-Semitism&quot; essay, and particularly its [[Jewish deicide]] claim that &quot;the Jews were responsible for the killing of Jesus,&quot; as an example of Atzmon's &quot;openly anti-Jewish rhetoric.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Hirsh, David.

According to Irish academic David Landy, a former chair of the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, Atzmon's words, &quot;if not actually anti-Semitic, certainly border on it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Landy|first=David|title=Jewish Identity and Palestinian Rights: Disapora Jewish Opposition to Israel|year=2011|publisher=Zed Books|location=London|isbn=978-1-84813-926-8|pages=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ynetnews]] has used Atzmon as an example of Jewish anti-Semitism: &quot;Gilad Atzmon, an Israeli jazz musician, defines himself as anti-Jewish and sees the torching of synagogues as a rational move.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4106265,00.html|title=Jewish anti-Semites do exist|publisher=[[Ynetnews]]|date=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of [[Howard Jacobson]]'s 2010 [[Man Booker Prize]]-winning novel ''[[The Finkler Question]]'', Edward Alexander writes, &quot;the novel’s Holocaust-denying Israeli ''[[Yerida|yored]]'' drummer is in fact based upon one Gilad Atzmon, who is better known in England for endorsing the ideology of the ''Protocols of the Elders of Zion'' and describing the burning of British synagogues as a 'rational act' in retaliation for Israeli actions.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Alexander, [http://spme.net/cgi-bin/articles.cgi?ID=7444 Ashamed Jews: The Finkler Question], [http://spme.net [[Scholars for Peace in the Middle East]] Reviews and Recommendations], December, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011 trade unionist and blogger Andy Newman&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/profile/andy-newman Andy Newman profile] on ''[[The Guardian]]'' website&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in ''[[The Guardian]]'' that Atzmon's political writing are &quot;a wild conspiracy argument, dripping with contempt for Jews&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newman&quot;/&gt; In a letter to the editor printed by the Guardian Atzmon wrote that Newman had &quot;misrepresented&quot; his views and that &quot;how to define a Jew is a loaded topic since Jews define themselves in many different ways, some contradictory, and use those definitions to try to achieve political aims.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gilad Atzmon, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/sep/28/moral-obligation-and-jewish-identity?newsfeed=true Letter: Moral obligation and Jewish identity], ''[[The Guardian]]'', September 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, [[Hope not Hate]], a [[United Kingdom]] [[anti-fascism]] and [[anti-racism]] campaign group issued a call to cancel a Gilad Atzmon performance at the &quot;Raise Your Banners&quot; festival of political song, stating &quot;Bradford TUC has long been at the fore of the anti-fascist movement in the area and it is in this tradition that we demand the withdrawl of Atzmon’s invitation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hopenothate.org.uk/blog/article/1487/pull-the-plug-on-gilad-atzmon Pull the Plug on Gilad Atzmon], [[Hope not Hate]] web site, November 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  Bradford Trades Union Council condemned the appearance and the Board of Deputies of British Jews asked the Arts Council, which had funded the festival, to stop the performance.&lt;ref name=Griffiths&gt;Kathie Griffiths, [http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/9376005.Jazz_saxophonist_Gilad_Atzmon_at_centre_of_Raise_Your_Banners_festival_row/ Calls for musician's show to be cancelled], [[Telegraph &amp; Argus]], November 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arts Council refused the request. Gerry Sutcliffe, the Labour MP for Bradford South, and the Right Reverend David Ison of the Bradford Cathedral also called for the festival to rescind their invitation to Atzmon.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Rocker, [http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/58942/more-calls-gilad-atzmon-concert-ban More calls for Gilad Atzmon concert ban], [[The Jewish Chronicle]], November 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Raise Your Banners director said organisers did not believe the claims of anti-semitism. Atzmon said the Trade Union Council’s letter “stitched together” into one quote phrases from five separate paragraphs to make him look racist. He said he wanted an apology.&lt;ref name=Griffiths/&gt;

In March 2012, a group of leading Palestinian activists issued a statement calling for &quot; the disavowal of Atzmon by fellow Palestinian organizers, as well as Palestine solidarity activists, and allies of the Palestinian people&quot;. Describing him as a racist and antisemite, the statement affirmed that &quot;we regard any attempt to link and adopt antisemitic or racist language, even if it is within a self-described anti-imperialist and anti-Zionist politics, as reaffirming and legitimizing Zionism.&quot; Signatories to the statement included [[Ali Abunimah]], [[Naseer Aruri]], [[Omar Barghouti]], [[Nadia Hijab]], [[Joseph Massad]] and several others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Granting No Quarter: A Call for the Disavowal of the Racism and Antisemitism of Gilad Atzmon|url=http://uspcn.org/2012/03/13/granting-no-quarter-a-call-for-the-disavowal-of-the-racism-and-antisemitism-of-gilad-atzmon/|publisher=US Palestinian Community Network|accessdate=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Disavow /&gt;

Atzmon refers to charges of antisemitism as being a &quot;common Zionist silencing apparatus.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Barnaby Smith, [http://www.tourdates.co.uk/LondonTourdates/issue-007/2007/10/05/222-Sax-With-An-Axe-To-Grind Sax With An Axe To Grind], Interview with Gilad Atzmon in ''London Tour Dates'' magazine, October 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; He denies both that he is an antisemite and the very existence of antisemitism, stating that &quot;'Anti-Semite' is an empty signifier, no one actually can be an Anti-Semite and this includes me of course. In short, you are either a racist which I am not or have an ideological disagreement with Zionism, which I have.&quot;&lt;ref name=1001Lies&gt;Gilad Atzmon, [http://gilad.co.uk/html%20files/1001lies.html 1001 Lies About Gilad Atzmon], at his personal web site.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Atzmon said &quot;I've got nothing against the [[Semite]] people, I don't have anything against people&amp;nbsp;— I'm anti-Jewish, not anti-Jews.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gibson&quot;&gt;Gibson, Martin. &quot;No choice but to speak out&amp;nbsp;— Israeli musician ‘a proud self-hating Jew’&quot;.
