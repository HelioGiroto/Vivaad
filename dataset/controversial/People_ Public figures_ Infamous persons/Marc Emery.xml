'''Marc Scott Emery''' (born February 13, 1958) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] policy reform advocate, a politician, and media publisher as well as a former cannabis seed seller. He is currently serving a five-year sentence in a [[United States]] federal prison for selling [[cannabis]] seeds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/content/2010/09/10/Prince-Pot-Marc-Emery-Sentenced-Five-Years-US-Prison 'Prince of Pot' Marc Emery Sentenced To Five Years in US Prison]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.freemarc.ca/group/freemarcca/who-marc-emery-0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent judicial history==
He is formerly a [[retailer]] of cannabis seeds for cultivation, having started Marc Emery Direct Marijuana Seeds in 1995, which he ran until it was closed by a raid by [[Vancouver Police Department|Vancouver police]] acting on the request of the United States [[Drug Enforcement Administration]] (DEA) on July 29, 2005.

US Government officials have described Emery as a [[drug dealer]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2008-03-29|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/28/AR2006032801619_pf.html|publisher=Washington Post|date=2006-03-29|title=A Drug Dealer's Toll on Americans}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2005-08-31|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/canadas-prince-of-pot-faces-extradition/2005/08/30/1125302570332.html|title=Canada's 'Prince of Pot' faces extradition|publisher=[[The Age]]|date=2005-08-31|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2006-03-05|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/03/02/60minutes/main1363340.shtml?CMP=ILC-SearchStories|publisher=[[CBS News]]|title=The Prince of Pot|date=2006-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2005-07-29|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/07/29/pot-raid050729.html|publisher=[[CBC News]]|title=U.S. seeks extradition of Canadian pot crusader|date=2005-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his efforts to sell marijuana seeds in Canada and abroad. He was the publisher of ''[[Cannabis Culture magazine|Cannabis Culture]]'' magazine, a founding member of the [[Freedom Party of Ontario]], the [[Marijuana Party of Canada]] and the [[BC Marijuana Party]], founder of the Iboga Therapy House and founder of [[Pot TV]]. He ran for mayor of the city of [[Vancouver]] in 1996, 2002 and 2008.

Emery was taken into custody on September 28, 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/content/marc-emery-be-taken-custody |title=Marc Emery to be Taken Into Custody &amp;#124; Cannabis Culture Magazine |publisher=Cannabisculture.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v09/n898/a07.html |title=CN BC: Emery's Tearful Goodbye |publisher=Mapinc.org |date=2009-09-29 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and held at the North Fraser Pretrial Centre in [[Port Coquitlam]], BC, to await [[extradition]] to the USA. On November 18, 2009, Emery was released on bail, pending the Canadian Minister of Justice signing the extradition order;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v09/n1035/a07.html |title=CN BC: Emery Out on Bail Till Extradition |publisher=Mapinc.org |date=2009-11-18 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on May 10, 2010, Justice Minister [[Rob Nicholson]] signed the order and ordered Emery to surrender to authorities, which he did that same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Canada |url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/british-columbia/prince-of-pot-will-be-extradited/article1563251/ |title=‘Prince of Pot’ will be extradited |publisher=The Globe and Mail |date= 2010-05-10|accessdate=2010-08-01 |location=Toronto}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 10, 2010, Justice Minister Nicholson ruled Emery be extradited to the United States. He faces 5 years in the US penal system. The possibility exists Emery may be allowed to serve all or part of his sentence in Canada. US authorities have not rejected this option, should Canada make such a formal request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news1130.com/news/local/article/53287--marc-emery-turns-himself-in-justice-minister-signs-off-on-extradition/ Marc Emery Turns Himself In. News 1130 All News Radio]&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 20, 2010, Emery was extradited to the United States. On May 24, he appeared in a Seattle courtroom and pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to manufacture marijuana.

On June 3, officials at the [[Federal Detention Center, SeaTac|Federal Detention Center in SeaTac]], [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] gave Emery an official citation for allowing his wife, BC Green Party Director-at-Large Jodie Emery, to record a message from him over the phone, claiming it broke the prison's rule forbidding third-party calls. Emery was locked in a Segregated Housing Unit (SHU) for three weeks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/content/2010/06/09/Marc-Emery-Put-Solitary-Confinement-US-Prison-Recording-Podcast&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 10, 2010 in a Seattle court room, Marc Emery was sentenced to 5 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theprovince.com/news/Update+Prince+Marc+Emery+sentenced+years+prison+judge/3507601/story.html?cid=megadrop_story Prince Of Pot Marc Emery Sentenced To 5 Years In Prison By US Judge. Damian Inwood. The Province. Retrieved Sept 10, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; US district court judge Ricardo Martinez sentenced Emery, stating there was no question his actions were criminal and that Emery ensured others broke the law by selling them the seeds. The court noted Emery claimed on his website to have made some $3 million a year from selling seeds from his Vancouver headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ca.msn.com/canada/cp-article.aspx?cp-documentid=25532372 Pot Prince Gets 5 Years. Canadian Press. Retrieved Sept 10, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Emery donated almost all of the money generated from his seed sales to marijuana policy reform efforts. Emery's claims that his arrest was political were disputed by the prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/426360_Emery08.html | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first=Levi | last=Pulkkinen | title=Prince of Pot' prepares for prison, calls prosecution 'political | date=2010-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opposingviews.com/i/marc-emery-s-former-prosecutor-denounces-pot-prohibition&lt;/ref&gt;
On November 19, 2010 Marc Emery was transferred to the D. Ray James Correctional Facility in Folkston, GA. He has since been transferred to FCI Correctional Institution in Yazoo City, MS to serve the rest of his sentence.

==Early career==
At the age of 9 he started a business from his parents' home called Stamp Treasure, buying and selling stamps by mail order. Two years later he started another mail-order business called Marc's Comic Room.&lt;ref name=&quot;cannabisculture.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/articles/1423.html |title=1999 FLASHBACK - Marc Emery: The Prince of Pot speaks out &amp;#124; Cannabis Culture Magazine |publisher=Cannabisculture.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He dropped out of high school in 1975 at age 17 to purchase a used book store on Richmond Street in downtown [[London, Ontario]] which he renamed City Lights Bookshop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo; |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YGdGvXdokt8 |title=Marc Emery for City Lights Bookshop in London, Ontario |publisher=YouTube |date=2008-05-05 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emery operated the store for 17 years, selling it in 1992.

Shortly after opening the store, Emery began a three-year fight against the London Downtown Business Association for extracting mandatory fees from all core area shops for beautification and other programs.

Emery also ran an emergency garbage service in London for three weeks during a municipal garbage strike in 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;cannabisculture.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/13/international/americas/13emery.html?pagewanted=2 | work=The New York Times | title=This Johnny Appleseed Is Wanted by the Law | first=Clifford | last=Krauss | date=13 August 2005 | accessdate=12 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He first became politically active with the [[Libertarian Party of Canada]], and ran for the [[Canadian House of Commons]] under that party's banner in the [[Canadian federal election, 1980|1980 federal election]]. He received 197 votes in [[London East]], finishing fourth.

Emery later left the Libertarians and became a London-area organiser for the [[Unparty]]. In 1983 [[Robert Metz]], who had worked with Emery since 1980, was made president of the Unparty and later that year announced the Unparty would change its name to the [[Freedom Party of Ontario]], which continues to be a registered political party in the Province of Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elections.on.ca/en-CA/CandidatesAndParties/PoliticalParties/RegisteredPoliticalPartiesinOntario.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Emery served as the Freedom Party's Action Director from 1984 to 1990.

In 1984, Emery, the Freedom Party, and the No Tax for Pan-Am Games Committee (founded by Emery and Metz) successfully campaigned against London's bid for the 1991 [[Pan American Games]], saying the city would lose millions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.notaxforpanam.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo; |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CdBmCaGLBXM |title=No Tax for Pan Am (Toronto 2015) |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emery ran as a candidate of the Freedom Party in the rural constituency of [[Middlesex (electoral district)|Middlesex]], near London, in the [[Ontario general election, 1987|1987 provincial election]]. He received 499 votes for a distant fifth-place finish.

In 1986 and 1987, Emery defied Ontario's [[Sunday shopping#Ontario|Sunday shopping laws]], finally facing eight charges after opening for eight Sundays in a row. In June 1988, he spent four days in jail after being convicted on the first of the charges and then refusing to pay the fine.&lt;ref name=&quot;cannabisculture.com&quot;/&gt;

He also campaigned against London's by-law prohibiting sidewalk signs. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

After resigning from the Freedom Party in 1990, Emery rented the London Regional Art &amp; Historical Museum (now called Museum London) for his first pro-pot rally. {{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

In 1991, Emery was convicted for selling copies of [[2 Live Crew]]'s rap CD [[As Nasty As They Wanna Be]] which had been deemed obscene and banned in  Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Karen Selick |url=http://www.karenselick.com/CL9609.html |title=A Modern Day Thoreau CL9609.html |publisher=Karenselick.com |date=2000-06-12 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westernstandard.ca/website/article.php?id=2705&amp;start=1 |title=Western Standard - Seeding Sovereignty |publisher=Westernstandard.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was given one year probation, but immediately after sentencing he began selling marijuana-related literature and [[High Times]] Magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo; |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z0-WGcFwUHY |title=Marc Emery 2of3: Messing Up the System, The History of the Prince of Pot 1992 |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-09-20 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; all in violation of Canadian law.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/articles/932.html |title=Censorship in Canada: 462.2 &amp;#124; Cannabis Culture Magazine |publisher=Cannabisculture.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/cc/cc.462.2.html |title=462.2 Offense |publisher=Efc.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emery invited local police to his store to arrest him, and even sold copies of the banned marijuana grow books right outside the London Ontario police station, but the police refused to charge him or interfere.&lt;ref name=&quot;greentide.ca&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greentide.ca/young.htm |title=:: Green Truth - The Green Tide Shadow Summit :: |publisher=Greentide.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also sponsored visits from marijuana luminaries such as [[Ed Rosenthal]], [[Steven Hager]], [[Jack Herer]] and [[Paul Mavrides]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cannabisculture.com&quot;/&gt;

Much of this early period of Emery's life is featured in the 1992 documentary film ''Marc Emery: Messing Up the System'' scripted by London writers [[Chris Doty]] and Jason Rip.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/PotTVNetwork#p/u/5/Ji-KA_OVBz0 |title=Kanaal van PotTVNetwork |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hightimes.com/news/ht_admin/2949 |title=&gt; Prince Of Pot |publisher=Hightimes.Com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a play called ''Citizen Marc: The Adventures of Marc Emery''. The play was directed by John Gerry which opened in London on January 27, 2006. Emery was in attendance for the premiere. Doty committed suicide in the days that followed. The play won the Brickenden Awards for Best Ballyhoo, Best Actor and Best Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brickenden.org/history/nominees-and-winners-2006/ |title=Nominees and Winners 2006 &quot; The Brickenden Awards |publisher=Brickenden.org |date=2007-01-22 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marijuana seed business==
Emery moved to Vancouver, [[British Columbia]] in March 1994, and founded a store called Hemp BC on July 7. His store played a major part in expanding Canada's then very small and underground industry in cannabis-related paraphernalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.cannabisculture.com/v2/articles/1307.html |title=HempBC &amp;#124; Cannabis Culture Magazine |publisher=.cannabisculture.com |date=2000-02-08 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bongs and pipes are illegal in Canada under section 462.2 of the Criminal Code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalantidrugstrategy.gc.ca/parents/observe/drugs-drogues.html |title=Drug Lingo and Drug Paraphernalia |publisher=National Anti-Drug Strategy |date=2009-07-21 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were not readily available in Canada at the time. Emery imported and wholesaled a variety of bongs, pipes and other cannabis-related items, and encouraged other people to open their own &quot;Hemp Stores&quot; across Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/articles/1307.html |title=HempBC &amp;#124; Cannabis Culture Magazine |publisher=Cannabisculture.com |date=2000-02-08 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/backissues/cc03/hempstore/hempstore.html |title=Opening a Hempstore |publisher=Cannabisculture.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1994, a court challenge sponsored by Emery convinced an Ontario judge to overturn the Canadian prohibition on marijuana and drug-related literature, making it legal for ''[[High Times Magazine]]'' and marijuana grow books to be sold in Canada once more.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;greentide.ca&quot;/&gt;

Emery began selling marijuana seeds in late 1994, after attending the [[High Times]] [[Cannabis Cup]] and being inspired by a Dutch seed store named Sensi Seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/2644.html |title=Marc Emery, Canada's Prince of Pot &amp;#124; Cannabis Culture Magazine |publisher=Cannabisculture.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1995 he launched ''Cannabis Canada Magazine'', which was renamed ''[[Cannabis Culture Magazine]]'' in 1998.

In December 1995, Emery and his seed business were featured on the front page of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.ca/books?id=yyjnqwvaC0wC&amp;pg=PA131 |title=Drug war, American style: the ... - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01|isbn=978-0-8153-3405-7|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to a deluge of media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/articles/3124.html |title=Marc Emery Puts Pot Industry on the Business Map &amp;#124; Cannabis Culture Magazine |publisher=Cannabisculture.com |date=2003-10-20 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month later, in January 1996, Hemp BC was raided by Vancouver police who seized Emery's bongs and seeds and charged him with selling marijuana seeds and &quot;promoting vaporizers.&quot; He was later convicted and given a $2200 fine, $500 for each of four counts of selling marijuana seeds and $200 for vaporizer promotion.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/content/marc-emerys-sentence-reeks-injustice-and-mocks-our-sovereignty |title=Marc Emery's Sentence Reeks of Injustice and Mocks our Sovereignty &amp;#124; Cannabis Culture Magazine |publisher=Cannabisculture.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emery re-opened his store the next day, and continued to sell paraphernalia and marijuana seeds. By 1997 he had expanded his store to include a Grow Shop, a Legal Assistance Centre, and the Cannabis Cafe, which featured a custom-built vaporizer built into every table.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/articles/3510.html |title=Celebrating a decade of cannabis activism &amp;#124; Cannabis Culture Magazine |publisher=Cannabisculture.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, 1997, Marc Emery was featured on ''[[CNN]] Impact'' in an episode called &quot;Canada Cannabis.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo; |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPxXCojBfGYM |title=The Prince of Pot - Marc Emery and BC Bud on CNN Impact (1997) - Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcer referred to Emery as the &quot;Prince of Pot&quot; and the label stuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v97/n477/a01.html |title=Transcript: CNN IMPACT: Canada Cannabis |publisher=Mapinc.org |date=1997-10-12 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; This drew major international media attention to Emery and his Hemp BC store once more.

The Vancouver police returned on December 16, 1997, once again emptying his store of seeds and paraphernalia, as well as taking the vaporizers out of the Cannabis Cafe. Police claimed to have seized about $1.6 million worth of marijuana-related merchandise, plus tens of thousands of marijuana seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v97/n698/a02.htm |title=Canada: BC: Raid Fails to Get Tokers Off the Pot |publisher=Mapinc.org |date=1997-12-18 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emery was jailed but not charged with any seed or paraphernalia offences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v97/n693/a03.html |title=Canada: BC: Cops Pull Pot Pals Off to the Slammer |publisher=Mapinc.org |date=1997-12-17 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was charged and convicted of &quot;assaulting a police officer&quot; because he spat on a police officer while they were forcibly removing protestors from in front of the store. In a later interview, Emery stated &quot;I was found guilty and fined two hundred dollars. My defence was that it was justifiable as they were assaulting my employees. We have video tape of them kicking, shoving objects at, using a truncheon, and pulling on the hair of David Malmo-Levine and Ian Roberts.

Emery's seed business was raided again at its office location on April 30, 1998, and Emery was charged with selling marijuana seeds. Another raid on September 2, 1998, saw Emery jailed overnight again and his seeds confiscated, but no charges were laid. He was convicted from the April raid in 1999, and given a $2000 fine.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceC&quot;/&gt;

In August 1998, Vancouver Mayor [[Philip Owen]] had told the ''[[New York Times]]'' that Hemp BC was &quot;going to be toast by September.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v98/n726/a01.html |title=Canada BC: In Vancouver, Tolerance Of Drugs Draws Addicts |publisher=Mapinc.org |date=1998-08-21 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Court documents showed that four American navy undercover agents attempted to buy marijuana and smoke it at the Cannabis Cafe. The documents showed the [[Naval Criminal Investigative Service]] agents worked in a joint operation with Vancouver police in April 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v99/n626/a02.html |title=Canada: Judge Orders Cannabis Cafe Closed |publisher=Mapinc.org |date=1999-06-10 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2002, then US [[Drug Czar]] [[John P. Walters|John Walters]] visited Vancouver to give a speech at a luncheon sponsored by the [[Vancouver Board of Trade]]. Emery bought a table for himself and other local cannabis activists, and heckled Walters as he spoke about the need for Canada to embrace the &quot;War on Drugs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo; |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qkFCC49SXCM |title=The Prince of Pot - The John Walters Project - Part 1 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZG1-NXWaPoQ Youtube]&lt;/ref&gt;

Emery has described himself as a &quot;major financial backer of almost every pro-pot effort in North America and many more around the world.&quot; He claims that he spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in election campaigning for the Canadian Marijuana Party, [[BC Marijuana Party]] and the Vancouver Marijuana Party. He also claims to have funded numerous marijuana activist groups, paid for several major legal challenges to aspects of Canada's cannabis laws, and made large donations to various pro-pot ballot initiatives in US states such as California, Nevada, Alaska and Arizona, plus financially backed pro-cannabis activities in New Zealand, Australia, Russia and elsewhere around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/2644.html cannabisculture.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marijuana political parties==

In 2000 he was a founding member of the [[Marijuana Party of Canada]], a political party running to fully [[Drug legalization|legalize]] (not just [[Decriminalization|decriminalize]]) cannabis. In 2001 he helped found the [[British Columbia Marijuana Party]] (BCMP), which he currently leads.

Emery ran for the Canadian House of Commons as a Marijuana Party Candidate in the [[Canadian federal election, 2000|2000 federal election]], and finished sixth out of ten candidates in [[Vancouver Centre]] with 1,116 votes. Liberal [[Hedy Fry]] won the riding.

The BCMP placed fifth in the [[British Columbia general election, 2001|2001 provincial election]] and was only a few hundred votes short of fourth place. Emery himself received 905 votes in [[Vancouver-Burrard (provincial electoral district)|Vancouver-Burrard]], finishing fourth against [[British Columbia Liberal Party|BC Liberal]] [[Lorne Mayencourt]].

Emery has been the BC Marijuana Party's president since its founding, and also became party leader in 2003, when Leader [[Dana Larsen]] resigned to join the NDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v03/n1914/a09.html |title=CN BC: Ex-Marijuana Party Leader Goes To NDP |publisher=Mapinc.org |date=2003-12-12 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v03/n1907/a10.html |title=Canada: Ex-Marijuana Party Leader To Run For NDP In Federal Election |publisher=Mapinc.org |date=2003-12-11 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[British Columbia general election, 2005|2005 British Columbia election]], Emery ran for the BC Marijuana in [[Fort Langley-Aldergrove]] against provincial [[solicitor|Solicitor General]] [[Rich Coleman]], but was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/1114885586480_33/?hub=Canada CTV News] April 30, 2005 CP report.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 30, 2008, Emery announced he was running for mayor of Vancouver in the November election, and [[Member of the Legislative Assembly|MLA]] in the upcoming [[by-election]] for the constituency of [[Vancouver-Fairview]] which remains vacant after [[Gregor Robertson (politician)|Gregor Robertson]] won the [[Vision Vancouver]] nomination to run for mayor.

==Iboga Therapy House==

In 2002, Emery founded the Iboga Therapy House, an ibogaine-assisted detoxification therapy program located on BC's Sunshine Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thismagazine.ca/issues/2008/07/lastrefuge.php |title=This Magazine: The addict’s last refuge? |publisher=Thismagazine.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v03/n011/a09.html |title=CN BC: Ibogaine A One-Way Trip To Sobriety, Pot Head Says |publisher=Mapinc.org |date=2003-01-03 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emery and his staff offered free ibogaine therapy to volunteer heroin and cocaine addicts with a plant-based alkaloid called [[ibogaine]], which eliminates withdrawal symptoms and helps produce the mental change needed to quit using.

Emery's Iboga Therapy House treated almost 60 people before he stopped funding in 2004, at a cost Emery states of over $2000 per person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cannabisculture.com/v2/articles/2814.html |title=Psychedelic addiction therapy &amp;#124; Cannabis Culture Magazine |publisher=Cannabisculture.com |date=2003-01-27 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Iboga Therapy House became a non-profit society &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibogatherapyhouse.net/cms/content/view/23/42/ |title=Iboga Therapy House |publisher=Iboga Therapy House |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005 and continues to offer ibogaine therapy as an independent organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibogatherapyhouse.net/ |title=Iboga Therapy House |publisher=Iboga Therapy House |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 29, 2005, Canadian police, acting on a request from the United States Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v05/n1303/a05.html |title=Canada: This Johnny Appleseed Is Wanted by the Law |publisher=Mapinc.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; simultaneously raided the BC Marijuana Party Bookstore and Headquarters in Vancouver and arrested Emery for extradition to the United States outside a local storefront in the community of [[Lawrencetown, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Lawrencetown]], [[Nova Scotia]] where he was attending a HempFest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v05/n1326/a01.html |title=CN BC: Marijuana's Martyr |publisher=Mapinc.org |date=2005-08-13 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v05/n1230/a06.html |title=Canada: OPED: Just Say No To Uncle Sam's DEA |publisher=Mapinc.org |date=2005-08-03 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v05/n1210/a09.html |title=CN BC: 'Prince Of Pot' Arrested |publisher=Mapinc.org |date=2005-07-30 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American authorities charged Emery and co-defendants Gregory Keith Williams, 50, of Vancouver, BC and Michelle Rainey-Fenkarek, 34, of Vancouver, BC with &quot;'Conspiracy to Distribute Marijuana&quot;, &quot;Conspiracy to Distribute Marijuana Seeds&quot; and &quot;Conspiracy to Engage in Money Laundering&quot;. Even though all the alleged offenses occurred in Canada, Canadian police did not lay any charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20050802/emery_court_050802?s_name=Autos&amp;no_ads= |title=B.C. pot activist Marc Emery granted bail - CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |date=2005-08-02 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day of Emery's arrest, American DEA Administrator Karen Tandy admitted reasons behind the arrest were politically motivated by releasing the following statement, which praised blows dealt to the legalization movement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Today's DEA arrest of Marc Scott Emery, publisher of Cannabis Culture Magazine, and the founder of a marijuana legalization group -- is a significant blow not only to the marijuana trafficking trade in the U.S. and Canada, but also to the marijuana legalization movement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;His marijuana trade and propagandist marijuana magazine have generated nearly $5 million a year in profits that bolstered his trafficking efforts, but those have gone up in smoke today.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Emery and his organization had been designated as one of the Attorney General's most wanted international drug trafficking organizational targets -- one of only 46 in the world and the only one from Canada.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Hundreds of thousands of dollars of Emery's illicit profits are known to have been channeled to marijuana legalization groups active in the United States and Canada. Drug legalization lobbyists now have one less pot of money to rely on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/articles/4685.html |title=DEA Release Admits Marc Emery Extradition Politically Motivated &amp;#124; Cannabis Culture Magazine |publisher=Cannabisculture.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Emery was freed on a $50,000 bail and prepared to fight extradition in the courts.

==International protests and rallies==
On September 10, 2005, about seven weeks after Emery's arrest, over 40 demonstrations were held around the world to protest his impending extradition to the United States. Locations included Moscow, Prague, Wellington, Sydney, Mexico City, Paris, and London.&lt;ref name=&quot;cannabisculture1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabisculture.com/v2/content/worldwide-rally-prince-pot-marc-emery |title=Free Marc Emery: Rally For The Prince of Pot - Saturday, September 19 &amp;#124; Cannabis Culture Magazine |publisher=Cannabisculture.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v05/n1467/a06.html |title=CN BC: Fuming Crowd Yells For Emery |publisher=Mapinc.org |date=2005-09-12 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mapinc.org/drugnews/v05/n1465/a05.html |title=CN ON: Edu: T.O.

On September 19, 2009, rallies were held in over 100 cities around the world in support of Marc Emery and opposition to his extradition to the USA.

On May 22, 2010, rallies and protests in support of Marc Emery were held in over 80 cities representing a dozen countries. Nations with rallies included Australia, Germany, Sweden, Norway, the Philippines, Denmark and Ireland. There were 40 participating cities across Canada and another two dozen across the USA.&lt;ref&gt;|url=http://freemarc.ca/group/freemarcca/free-marc-emery-world-wide-rally |title=Free Marc Global Rally&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proceedings and guilty plea==
[[File:FDC Seatac.jpg|thumb|[[Federal Detention Center, SeaTac]], where Emery resided in 2010.]]
Emery and his two associates, all charged in the United States with drug and money laundering offences, each faced a minimum 10-year sentence and the possibility of life imprisonment if convicted there.

On January 14, 2008, Emery had agreed to a tentative plea-bargain with U.S. authorities. The terms of the agreement were a 5-year prison term to be served in both [[Correctional Service of Canada|Canadian]] and [[Incarceration in the United States|U.S. prisons]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-01-14|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/story.html?id=e343fa43-da3c-4864-a3fd-999a218650b0&amp;k=80077|title=Emery agrees to 5 years in Canadian prison|work=[[The Vancouver Sun]]|date=2008-01-14|author=Mulgrew, Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt; In return, he demanded the charges against his friends Michelle Rainey and Greg Williams be dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;sunjan21&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-01-21|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=2372dbe6-eb70-4743-81c9-d5a4a1e9b5da&amp;k=76805|publisher=The Vancouver Sun|title=Marc Emery's extradition proceedings postponed|date=2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(An [[British Columbia Court of Appeal|appeal court]] judge ruled on March 7, 2008 in a similar case that a one-month jail sentence and probation constituted an adequate sentence for the crime of marijuana seed selling in Canada. This could possibly have been used to Emery's advantage in his fight against extradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-10|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=f879d36a-e19c-4de3-a5dd-74eaa1a53ed1|title=Ruling shines different light on Emery's case|publisher=Vancouver Sun|date=2008-03-10|author=Mulgrew, Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

On March 27, 2008 the plea-bargain deal collapsed because of the refusal of the Canadian Conservative government to approve its side of the arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-28|date=2008-03-28|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/story.html?id=15fb70ba-0128-403c-b0a0-0f4029a39e83|publisher=The Vancouver Sun|title=Prince of Pot's deal with U.S. shot down by Ottawa|author=Mulgrew, Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2008, an extradition hearing was scheduled for June, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Help Save Canadian Activist and Hero, Marc Emery.&quot; ''Cannabis Culture Marijuana Magazine''.

On September 21, 2009, Emery entered his guilty plea, and on September 28, he was incarcerated in a British Columbia prison awaiting [[extradition]] to a US federal prison to serve the five-year sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kelowna.com/2009/09/28/pot-activist-marc-emery-taken-into-custody-for-extradition-to-the-u-s/ |title=Pot activist Marc Emery taken into custody for extradition to the U.S. |publisher=Kelowna.com |date=2009-09-28 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo; |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0rB5qXTFOk |title=Marc Emery Taken into Custody for Extradition, September 28th 2009 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is a 30 day appeal period before extradition.

Emery was granted bail on November 18, after seven weeks in the pre-trial centre, to await the Justice Minister's decision on the extradition order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metronews.ca/vancouver/local/article/372346--emery-out-on-bail-till-extradition |title=Metro - Emery out on bail till extradition |publisher=Metronews.ca |date=2009-11-18 |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;ldquo;&amp;rdquo; |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EsADAD6H2WE |title=Jodie @ Marc EMERY JOYTV Part1 |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 10, 2010, Emery was sentenced to 5 years in prison minus time served.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://hawaiinewsdaily.com/2010/09/11/cannabis-activist-marc-emery-sentenced-5-years/] Emery sentencing&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business licence==
Emery says he has{{When|date=February 2011}} been having troubles with the [[Government and politics of Vancouver|City of Vancouver]], as he has been refused a licence renewal for his Vancouver businesses on [[Hastings Street (Vancouver)|West Hastings Street]]. This comes despite his having made thousands of dollars worth of renovations as requested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vancouver.24hrs.ca/News/local/2009/04/03/8988086-sun.html |title=24 Hours Vancouver |publisher=Vancouver.24hrs.ca |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
