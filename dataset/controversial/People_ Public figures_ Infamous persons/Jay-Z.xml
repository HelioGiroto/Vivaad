According to his mother, Gloria Carter, her son Shawn used to wake his siblings up at night banging out drum patterns on the kitchen table. Eventually, she bought him a [[boom box]] for his birthday, sparking his interest in music. He began [[freestyling]], writing lyrics, and followed the music of many artists popular at the time.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;December 4&quot;, [[The Black Album (Jay-Z album)|The Black Album]] – Jay-Z&lt;/ref&gt; In his neighborhood, Carter was known as &quot;Jazzy&quot;, a nickname that eventually developed into his showbiz/stage name, &quot;Jay-Z&quot;.

== Music career ==

=== 1995–97: ''Reasonable Doubt'' and ''In My Lifetime, Vol. 1'' ===
From the beginning of his professional recording career, when no major label gave him a record deal, Jay-Z, [[Damon Dash]], and Kareem Biggs created [[Roc-A-Fella Records]] as their own independent label in 1995. After striking a deal with [[Priority Records|Priority]] to distribute his material, Jay-Z released his 1996 debut album ''[[Reasonable Doubt (album)|Reasonable Doubt]]'' with beats from acclaimed producers such as [[DJ Premier]] and [[Clark Kent (producer)|Super DJ Clark Kent]] and a notable appearance by [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]. The album reached number 23 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and was well received by critics.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicbio&quot;/&gt; This album would later be included in ''Rolling Stone'''s &quot;[[500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]&quot; as No.248 and eventually reach platinum status.&lt;ref name=&quot;riaacertification&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=&amp;artist=JAY-Z&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2009&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=100|title=RIAA – Gold &amp; Platinum|accessdate=August 22, 2009|publisher=RIAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After reaching a new distribution deal with [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]] in 1997, Jay-Z released his follow-up ''[[In My Lifetime, Vol. 1]]''. Executively produced by [[Sean Combs|Sean &quot;Puff Daddy&quot; Combs]], it sold better than his previous effort. Jay-Z later explained that the album was made during one of the worst periods of his life, he was reeling from the death of his close friend The Notorious B.I.G. The album was a personal revelation for Jay-Z as he spun the tale of his hard knock upbringing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.askmen.com/men/entertainment_60/82_jay_z.html |title=Jay-Z – |publisher=Askmen.com |date=December 4, 1969 |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album's glossy production stood as a contrast to his first release, and some dedicated fans felt he had &quot;sold out&quot;. However, the album did feature some beats from producers who had worked with him on ''Reasonable Doubt'', namely DJ Premier and [[Ski (producer)|Ski]]. Like its predecessor, ''[[In My Lifetime, Vol. 1]]'' earned Platinum status in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;riaacertification&quot; /&gt;

=== 1998–2000: ''Vol. 2...'', criminal charges and mainstream success ===
In 1998, Jay-Z released ''[[Vol. 2... Hard Knock Life]]'' which spawned the biggest hit of his career at the time, &quot;[[Hard Knock Life (Ghetto Anthem)]]&quot;. He relied more on flow and wordplay, and he continued with his penchant for mining beats from the popular producers of the day such as [[Swizz Beatz]], an upstart in-house producer for [[Ruff Ryders]], and [[Timbaland]]. Other producers included [[DJ Premier]], [[Erick Sermon]], [[DJ Mark the 45 King|The 45 King]], and [[Kid Capri]]. Charting hits from this album included &quot;Can I Get A...&quot;, featuring [[Ja Rule]] and [[Amil]], and &quot;[[Nigga What, Nigga Who (Originator 99)|Nigga What, Nigga Who]]&quot;, also featuring Amil. ''Vol. 2'' would eventually become Jay-Z's most commercially successful album; it was certified 5× Platinum in the United States and has to date sold over five million copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;riaacertification&quot; /&gt; The album went on to win a Grammy Award, although Jay-Z boycotted the ceremony protesting DMX's failure to garner a Grammy nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1452653/20020227/jay_z.jhtml|title=Where's The Love? Jay-Z Disses Grammys Again|accessdate=August 15, 2009|date=February 27, 2002|first=Shaheem|last=Reid|publisher=MTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1999, Jay-Z dueted with [[Mariah Carey]] on &quot;[[Heartbreaker (Mariah Carey song)|Heartbreaker]]&quot;, a song from her seventh album, ''[[Rainbow (Mariah Carey album)|Rainbow]]''. In that same year, Jay-Z released ''[[Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter]]'', the album proved to be successful and sold over 3 million records.&lt;ref name=&quot;riaacertification&quot; /&gt; ''Vol. 3'''s most successful single was &quot;[[Big Pimpin']]&quot;, featuring [[UGK]]. Around the same time, Jay-Z was accused of stabbing record executive Lance &quot;Un&quot; Rivera for what Jay-Z perceived was Rivera's bootlegging of ''Vol. 3... Life and Times of S. Carter''. The stabbing allegedly occurred at the record release party for [[Q-Tip (rapper)|Q-Tip's]] debut solo album ''[[Amplified (Q-Tip album)|Amplified]]'' at the Kit Kat Klub, a now defunct night club in [[Times Square]], New York City, on December 9. Jay-Z's associates at the party were accused of causing a commotion within the club, which Jay-Z allegedly used as cover when he supposedly stabbed Rivera in the stomach with a five-inch (127&amp;nbsp;mm) blade.&lt;ref&gt;Handlin, Sam. [http://www.courttv.com/archive/trials/jay-z/101701_ctv.html Jay-Z pleads guilty to stabbing record executive]. Courttv.com. October 18, 2001. Retrieved June 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Decoded'', Jay-Z addresses his assault case. While he didn't apologize for his actions, he did express regret that the incident happened and attributed it to a loss of control, saying that there was no reason for him to get into a situation that put him and people who depended on him at risk. He also vowed to never get involved in a similar situation again.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Jay-Z initially denied the incident and pleaded not guilty when a grand jury returned the indictment. Jay-Z and his lawyers contended he was nowhere around Rivera during the incident and they had witnesses and videotape evidence from the club that showed Jay-Z's whereabouts during the disturbance. Nevertheless, he later pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge that resulted in a sentence of three years probation.&lt;ref name=&quot;guiltyplea&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=D'Angelo|first=Joe|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1450090/20011017/jay_z.jhtml|title=Jay-Z Pleads Guilty To Stabbing, Faces Three Years' Probation|accessdate=June 25, 2009 |date=October 17, 2001 |publisher=MTV }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, Jay-Z released ''[[The Dynasty: Roc La Familia]]'', which was originally intended to become a compilation album for Roc-A-Fella artists but somehow turned into a Jay-Z album.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Steve |last=Jones |title=Jay-Z's rap dominates |newspaper=USA Today |publisher=Gannett Company, Inc. |date=November 7, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album helped to introduce newcomer producers [[The Neptunes]], [[Just Blaze]], [[Kanye West]] and [[Bink (producer)|Bink]], which have all gone on to achieve notable success. This is also the first album where Jay-Z utilizes a more soulful sound than his previous albums. ''The Dynasty'' sold over two million units in the U.S. alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;riaacertification&quot; /&gt;

=== 2001–02: Feud with Nas, ''The Blueprint'' and ''The Blueprint&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' ===
In 2001, Jay-Z spoke out against [[Prodigy (rapper)|Prodigy]] after he took an issue with a Jay-Z line from &quot;[[Money, Cash, Hoes]]&quot; that he felt were subliminal shots at Mobb Deep and referenced Mobb Deep's beef with [[Tupac Shakur]], [[Snoop Dogg]], and [[Death Row Records]]. He later performed the song &quot;[[Takeover (song)|Takeover]]&quot;, at [[Summer Jam]] 2001, which initially attacked Prodigy and revealed photos of Prodigy dressed like [[Michael Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1451428/20011211/mobb_deep.jhtml|title=Mobb Deep Strike Back At Jay-Z On Infamy|accessdate=August 14, 2009|date=December 12, 2001|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|publisher=MTV}}&lt;/ref&gt; A line at the end of &quot;Takeover&quot; referenced Nas, who criticized him on &quot;We Will Survive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Selwyn Seyfu Hinds |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/music/0203,hinds,31529,22.html |title=Kings of New York by Selwyn Seyfu Hinds |publisher=village voice |date=January 15, 2002 |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nas responded with a diss track called &quot;[[Ether (song)|Ether]]&quot; and almost instantly, Jay-Z added a verse to &quot;Takeover&quot; which dissed Nas and [[Jay-Z vs. Nas feud|would start a feud between the two rappers]]. Jay-Z later released his sixth studio album ''[[The Blueprint]]'' which was later considered by many to be one of hip hop's &quot;classic&quot; albums, receiving the coveted [[The Source (magazine)#The Source's Five Mic Albums|5 mic review]] from ''[[The Source (magazine)|The Source]]'' magazine. Released during the wake of [[September 11 attacks]], the album managed to debut at number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], selling more than 427,000 units;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1058742|title=Jay-Z Draws 'Blueprint' For Chart Dominance|last=Martens|first=Todd|date=September 20, 2001|work=Billboard|accessdate=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; the album's success was overshadowed by the tragic event. ''The Blueprint'' has been certified 2x Platinum in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;riaacertification&quot; /&gt; ''The Blueprint'' was applauded for its production and the balance of &quot;mainstream&quot; and &quot;hardcore&quot; rap, receiving recognition from both audiences. ''The Blueprint'' was written in only two days.&lt;ref&gt;Recounted by Jay-Z on the documentary ''[[Collision Course (album)|Collision Course]]'' . ''Collision Course''. Jay-Z and Linkin Park. Roc-A-Fella/Warner Bros./Machine Shop Recordings. 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eminem]] was the only guest rapper on the album, producing and rapping on the song &quot;Renegade&quot;. Four of the thirteen tracks on the album were produced by [[Kanye West]] and represents one of West's first major breaks in the industry.

Jay-Z's next solo album was 2002's ''[[The Blueprint 2: The Gift &amp; the Curse|The Blueprint&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: The Gift &amp; the Curse]]'', a double-album. The album debuted on the ''Billboard'' 200 at number one, selling over 3 million units in the U.S. alone&lt;ref name=&quot;riaacertification&quot; /&gt; and surpassing ''The Blueprint''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1765966#/bbcom/search/google/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1765966|title=Jay-Z Scores 5th Chart-Topper With 'Blueprint'|last=Martens|first=Todd|date=November 20, 2002|work=Billboard|accessdate=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later reissued in a single-disc version, ''[[The Blueprint 2.1]]'', which retained half of the tracks from the original. The album spawned two massive hit singles, &quot;[[Excuse Me Miss]]&quot; and &quot;[['03 Bonnie &amp; Clyde]]&quot;, which featured Jay-Z's future wife [[Beyoncé Knowles]]. &quot;Guns &amp; Roses&quot;, a track featuring rock musician [[Lenny Kravitz]], and &quot;[[Hovi Baby]]&quot; were two successful radio singles as well. The album also contained the tracks &quot;A Dream&quot;, featuring [[Faith Evans]] and the late [[The Notorious B.I.G.]]; and &quot;The Bounce&quot;, featuring [[Kanye West]]. ''The Blueprint 2.1'' featured tracks that do not appear on ''The Blueprint&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: The Gift &amp; the Curse'', such as &quot;Stop&quot;, &quot;La La La (Excuse Me Again)&quot;, &quot;What They Gonna Do, Part II&quot; and &quot;Beware&quot; produced by and featuring [[Panjabi MC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nriinternet.com/ENTERTAINMENT/Bhangra/1Bhangra_London/b_Rajibder_Missy.htm|title=

Notable songs on the album included &quot;[[What More Can I Say]]&quot;, &quot;[[Dirt Off Your Shoulder]]&quot;, &quot;[[Change Clothes]]&quot;, and &quot;[[99 Problems]]&quot;. ''The Black Album'' has sold 3 million copies in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;riaacertification&quot; /&gt; Jay-Z collaborated with [[R. Kelly]] and released a collaborative studio album, ''[[The Best of Both Worlds (Jay-Z and R. Kelly album)|The Best of Both Worlds]]''.

On November 25, 2003, Jay-Z held a concert at [[Madison Square Garden]], which would later be the focus of his film ''[[Fade to Black (documentary)|Fade to Black]]''. This concert was his &quot;retirement party&quot;. All proceeds went to charity. Other performers included collaborators like [[The Roots]] (in the form of his backing band), [[Missy Elliott]], [[Memphis Bleek]], [[Beanie Siegel]], Freeway, [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Beyoncé]], [[Twista]], [[Ghostface Killah]], [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]], [[Pharrell]] and [[R. Kelly]] with special appearances by [[Voletta Wallace]] and [[Afeni Shakur]], the mothers of [[The Notorious B.I.G.]] and [[Tupac Shakur]] respectively.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} While Jay-Z had attested to a retirement from making new studio albums, various side projects and appearances soon followed. Included in these were a greatest hits record, as well as the release and tour of ''[[Unfinished Business (Jay-Z and R. Kelly album)|Unfinished Business]]'', the second collaborative album between Jay-Z and R. Kelly.

In 2004, Jay-Z collaborated with rock group [[Linkin Park]], in which they released their collaborative [[Remix album|remix]] [[Extended play|EP]] ''[[Collision Course (album)|Collision Course]]'', which featured [[Mashup (music)|mashups]] of both artists' songs, as well as a concert DVD. The album's only single, &quot;[[Numb/Encore]]&quot;, went on to win a Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration, and was performed with Linkin Park live at the Grammys, with a special appearance by [[Paul McCartney]], who added verses from the song &quot;[[Yesterday]]&quot;. The EP sold over 1 million copies in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;riaacertification&quot; /&gt; Jay-Z was the executive producer of ''[[The Rising Tied]]'', the debut album of [[Fort Minor]], the hip hop [[side project]] of Linkin Park rapper [[Mike Shinoda]].

Later in 2004, Jay-Z was named president of Def Jam Records, which led to Jay-Z, Dash and Biggs selling their remaining interests in Roc-A-Fella Records and Jay-Z taking control of both of the companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1494616/20041208/jay_z.jhtml|title=Jay-Z, Dame Dash Sell Roc-A-Fella Records; Jay Named Def Jam Prez|accessdate=August 15, 2009|date=December 8, 2004|last=Hall|first=Rashaun|publisher=MTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly this major industry move was prompted by disagreements between Jay-Z and Dash as to what direction Roc-A-Fella could undertake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/news/profiles/17268/|title=Why Former Roc-A-Fella Records Partner Damon Dash Hates Mondays|accessdate=August 15, 2009|date=June 12, 2006|last=Konigsberg|first=Eric|publisher=New York Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The publicized split between Jay-Z, Dash and Biggs led to the former partners sending jabs at each other in interviews.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2006/04/damon_dash_speaks_about_jay_z/ Damon Dash Speaks About Jay-Z]'', Vibe.com, April 10, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2005–07: &quot;I Declare War&quot;, comeback with ''Kingdom Come'' and ''American Gangster'' ===
[[File:Jay-Z concert (cropped).jpg|right|thumb|Jay-Z at a concert in 2006.]]

On October 27, 2005, Jay-Z headlined New York's [[WWPR-FM|Power 105.1]] annual concert, Powerhouse. The concert was entitled the &quot;I Declare War&quot; concert leading to intense speculation in the weeks preceding the event on whom exactly Jay-Z would declare war. As he had previously &quot;declared war&quot; on other artists taking lyrical shots at him at other events, many believed that the Powerhouse show would represent an all-out assault by Jay-Z upon his rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1509668/09152005/jay_z.jhtml?headlines=true|title= 'I Declare War!'

Many artists made appearances such as the old roster of [[Roc-A-Fella]] records artists, as well as [[Ne-Yo]], [[Teairra Marí]], [[T.I.]], [[Young Jeezy]], [[Akon]], [[Kanye West]], [[Paul Wall]], [[The LOX]], and [[Sean Combs|Diddy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allhiphop&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2005/10/27/18130470.aspx|title= Hip-Hop Harmony: Jay-Z And Nas Officially Dead Beef |accessdate=August 6, 2009|author=Seandra Sims and Houston Williams |date= October 27, 2005|publisher=AllHipHop.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the conclusion of the concert, Jay-Z put many arguments to rest to the surprise of hip hop fans. The most significant development in this show was closure to the infamous hip hop rivalry between Jay-Z and [[Nas]]. The two former rivals shook hands and shared the stage together to perform Jay-Z's &quot;Dead Presidents&quot; blended with Nas's song &quot;The World is Yours&quot;.&lt;ref name=mtvnews2&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1512432/20051028/jay_z.jhtml|title= Jay-Z And Nas Put Beef To Sleep In Onstage Show Of Unity|accessdate=August 6, 2009|last= Reid|first= Shaheem|date= October 28, 2005|publisher=MTV News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jay-Z returned with his comeback album on November 21, 2006 titled ''[[Kingdom Come (Jay-Z album)|Kingdom Come]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.mp3.com/news/stories/6293.html|title= Jay-Z preps ''Kingdom Come''|accessdate=September 13, 2006|last= Welte|first= Jim|date= September 13, 2006|publisher=MP3.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jay-Z's comeback single, &quot;[[Show Me What You Got]]&quot;, was leaked on the Internet in early October 2006, scheduled to be released later on that month, received heavy air-play after its leak, causing the [[FBI]] to step in and investigate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.pr-inside.com/legal-action-to-be-taken-over-jay-z-single-leak-r21513.htm|title= Legal Action to be Taken over Jay-Z Single Leak?|accessdate=September 13, 2006|date= October 9, 2006|publisher=World Entertainment News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jay-Z worked with video director [[Hype Williams]], and the single's video was directed by [[F.

Jay-Z released his tenth album entitled ''[[American Gangster (album)|American Gangster]]'' on November 6, 2007. After viewing the Ridley Scott [[American Gangster (film)|film of the same name]], he was heavily inspired to create a new &quot;concept&quot; album that depicts his experiences as a street-hustler.&lt;ref name=&quot;newyorktimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/20/arts/music/20jayz.html?hp | title = For Jay-Z, Inspiration Arrives in a Movie | accessdate =September 19, 2007 | author=DAVID M.

The album is not the film's official soundtrack, although it was distributed by [[Def Jam Recordings|Def Jam]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hiphopdx&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.5728/title.jay-z-to-release-american-gangster | title = Jay-Z to Release 'American Gangster' | accessdate =September 20, 2007 | author=Shake | date = September 20, 2007 | publisher=HipHopDX}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Jay-Z's ''American Gangster'' depicts his life in correlation to the movie ''American Gangster''. At the start of the album's first single, &quot;Blue Magic&quot;, Jay-Z offers a dealer's manifesto while making references to political figures of the late 1980s with the lyric: &quot;Blame [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] for making me to into a monster, blame [[Oliver North]] and [[Iran-Contra]], I ran contraband that they sponsored, before this rhymin' stuff we was in concert.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Biddle |first=Sam |url=http://www.jhunewsletter.com/media/storage/paper932/news/2007/11/15/ArtsEntertainment/New-Vibrations-3105603.shtml |title=Johns Hopkins Newsletter: New Vibrations |publisher=jhunewsletter.com |date=November 15, 2007 |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also notable about the &quot;Blue Magic&quot; music video was Jay-Z flashing 500 euro notes, in what [[Harvard Business School]] professor [[Rawi Abdelal]] has called a &quot;turning point in American pop culture's response to globalization.&quot; The album has sold 1 million copies in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;riaacertification&quot; /&gt; On December 24, 2007, Jay-Z stated that he would not remain at Def Jam as the company's President, and vacated the position effective of January 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2007/12/24/19046792.aspx|title=BREAKING NEWS: Jay-Z Leaves Def Jam|publisher=AllHipHop.com|date=December 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2008–2011: Glastonbury, new record deal, ''The Blueprint 3'' and ''Watch the Throne'' ===
It was announced on February 2, 2008 that Jay-Z would headline the [[Glastonbury Festival 2008|2008 Glastonbury Festival]], becoming the first major hip hop artist to headline the British festival.&lt;ref name=&quot;glastonbury&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7223232.stm|title=Jay-Z confirmed for Glastonbury|accessdate=February 1, 2008|date=February 1, 2008|publisher=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/glastonbury/34049 |title=Jay-Z confirmed to headline Glastonbury 2008  |work=NME  |location=UK  |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tickets sold out before the opening of the festival. One of the more outspoken critics of his selection was [[Noel Gallagher]] of [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] fame, who criticized the organizers of the festival for scheduling Jay-Z as a headliner for the traditionally guitar-driven festival, stating ''&quot;I'm sorry, but Jay-Z? No chance. Glastonbury has a tradition of guitar music and even when they throw the odd curve ball in on a Sunday night you go 'Kylie Minogue?' I don't know about it. But I'm not having hip hop at Glastonbury.

Controversy ensued in the months leading up to the event with artists, promoters and fans weighing in both for and against. Jay-Z responded to this saying, ''&quot;We don't play guitars, Noel, but hip hop has put in its work like any other form of music. This headline show is just a natural progression. Rap music is still evolving. We have to respect each other's genre of music and move forward.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ndtvmusic.com/story.asp?id=ENTEN20080049721|title=Noel Gallagher is narrow minded: Jay-Z|publisher=NDTVmusic.com|date=May 13, 2008|accessdate=May 13, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to Gallagher's criticism, Jay-Z opened his Glastonbury set with a tongue-in-cheek cover of Oasis's iconic song &quot;[[Wonderwall (song)|Wonderwall]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;glastonbury3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/latest/2008/06/29/jay-z-s-glastonbury-wonderwall-dig-at-noel-gallagher-98487-20625795/|title=Jay-Z's Glastonbury Wonderwall dig at Noel Gallagher|date=June 29, 2008|publisher=Sunday Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Glastonbury performance was heralded as a successful response to pre-festival criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5hxVV-7FKB6uR5m8-tlLVFPsBUoQw |title=Jay-Z answers critics in Glastonbury performance |agency=AFP |publisher=Google  |date=June 29, 2008 |accessdate=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song's existence, along with several other tracks from the album, was confirmed during a listening session hosted by Jay-Z.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Osorio, [http://www.bet.com/news/music/2011/07/08/jay-z-unveils-watch-the-throne-at-exclusive-listening-session.html Jay-Z Unveils Watch The Throne At Exclusive Listening Session], ''BET.com'', July 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The album was first released on the iTunes Store, five days prior to it being released in physical format, a strategy Jay-Z later said was used to block an [[internet leak]]. It debuted at No. 1 on the iTunes Store in 23 countries. It also broke [[Coldplay]]'s record for most albums sold in one week on the online retailer, selling 290,000 copies on iTunes alone. It held that record, until [[Lil Wayne]]'s ''[[Tha Carter IV]]'' was released twenty-one days later, selling only 10,000 copies more. It debuted on the US [[Billboard 200]] chart at No. 1, selling 436,000 copies in its first week. The album received generally positive reviews.  Jay-Z and West later gave a surprise performance of &quot;Otis&quot; at the [[2011 MTV Video Music Awards]]. In April 2011, Jay-Z launched a blog-like, lifestyle website by the name of ''Life + Times''. It covers everything from music, to fashion, to technology, to sports. The site is curated based on Jay-Z's interests, and he himself works with a small staff to produce every single piece of content.

=== Politics ===
Jay-Z got actively involved in politics during the 2008 presidential campaign, where he supported increased voter participation and helped send voters to polling stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allhiphop.com/stories/news/archive/2010/10/12/22435436.aspx |title=Daily News – : Jay-Z Gets Political In New PSA To Encourage Voters |publisher=Allhiphop.com |accessdate=July 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an early supporter for the candidacy of Illinois senator and subsequent U.S. president [[Barack Obama]], performing for free in voter-drive concerts financed by the Democrats' campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2008/10/01/jay-z-to-perform-at-obama_n_130982.html |work=Huffington Post | title=Jay-Z To Perform At Obama Voter Drive | date=October 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also became acquainted with Obama himself, who stated &quot;Every time I talk to Jay-Z, who is a brilliant talent and a good guy, I enjoy how he thinks. That's somebody who is going to start branching out and can help shape attitudes in a real positive way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/13511/73040 |title=Inside Barack Obama's  &amp;#124; Rolling Stone Music |work=Rolling Stone  |date=June 25, 2008 |accessdate=July 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During the 2010 [[mid-term elections]]' campaign, Jay-Z appeared, along with other artists, in an ad prepared by the [[HeadCount]] organization, urging voters, and especially younger ones, to register and vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilkie |first=Christina |url=http://thehill.com/capital-living/in-the-know/123953-rapper-jay-z-hits-the-political-airwaves |title=Rapper Jay-Z hits the political airwaves |publisher=TheHill.com |date=October 20, 2010 |accessdate=July 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, Jay-Z announced his endorsement of President Obama's support of [[same-sex marriage]] for gay couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/05/14/jay-z-gay-marriage-obama_n_1516614.html?ref=fb&amp;src=sp&amp;comm_ref=false Jay-z, gay marriage stance right thing to do] retrieved 16 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
