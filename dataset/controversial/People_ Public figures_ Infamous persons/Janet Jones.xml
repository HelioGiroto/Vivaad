'''Janet Marie Gretzky''' (born January 10, 1961) is an [[United States|American]] [[actress]]. She is married to [[ice hockey]] icon [[Wayne Gretzky]].

==Entertainment career==
Jones performed in ''[[Annie (film)|Annie]]'' ([[1982 in film|1982]]), ''[[Staying Alive (1983 film)|Staying Alive]]'' ([[1983 in film|1983]]) and ''Snow White Live'' ([[1980 in film|1980]]), and had a bit part in ''[[The Beastmaster (film)|The Beastmaster]]'' ([[1982 in film|1982]]). Her big break came in ''[[The Flamingo Kid]]'' ([[1984 in film|1984]]), which was followed by the film version of ''[[A Chorus Line]]'' ([[1985 in film|1985]]). Later in 1986, she appeared in ''[[American Anthem]]'', co-starring gymnast [[Mitch Gaylord]]. In 1987, she appeared on the cover and in a semi-nude pictorial in the March issue of ''[[Playboy]]''.

Other credits include [[1988 in film|1988]]'s ''[[Police Academy 5: Assignment Miami Beach]]'' and the baseball film ''[[A League of Their Own]]'' ([[1992 in film|1992]]) with [[Geena Davis]] and [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]].

Jones served as host of an [[infomercial]] for [[Jackie Chan]] and as the &quot;master instructor&quot; for a workout video produced by The FIRM. She and daughter [[Paulina Gretzky|Paulina]] were featured in the movie ''[[Alpha Dog]]''.

Playing on her surname, she appeared in a 1986 TV commercial endorsing Jones Sausage along with other people who shared her last name.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

==Personal life==
Jones was born '''Janet Marie Jones''' in [[Bridgeton, Missouri]], the daughter of a business executive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.filmreference.com/film/29/Janet-Jones.html&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Pattonville High School]] in [[Maryland Heights, Missouri]].

Jones met Gretzky when he was a judge on [[Merv Griffin]]'s show ''[[Dance Fever]]'' in 1984. They met at a [[Los Angeles Lakers]] game in 1987, and on July 16, 1988, they were married in a ceremony at [[St. Joseph's Basilica, Edmonton|St. Joseph's Basilica]] that was broadcast live across [[Canada]]. Jones was four months [[pregnant]] at the time with their daughter [[Paulina Gretzky|Paulina]] (born December 19, 1988). They now have four other children: Ty Robert (born 1990), Trevor Douglas (born 1992), Tristan Wayne (born 2000), and Emma Marie (born 2003).

==Gambling ring controversy==
On February 7, 2006, Jones and a half-dozen NHL players were among those implicated in a [[New Jersey]]-based sports gambling ring allegedly financed by [[Phoenix Coyotes]] assistant coach [[Rick Tocchet]]. Then-Coyotes' general manager and Gretzky's former agent, Michael Barnett, admitted to placing a bet on [[Super Bowl XL]] through Tocchet.

Gretzky told reporters that Jones &quot;would sit down at some point and answer questions that everybody has for her and be her own person&quot; while denying any involvement. Jones released a statement through the Coyotes: &quot;At no time did I ever place a wager on my husband's behalf. Other than the occasional horse race, my husband does not bet on any sports.&quot;

The ''[[Newark Star-Ledger]]'' revealed that [[New Jersey State Police]] [[wiretaps]] have Gretzky speaking about the ring. Lawyers for the couple later announced that there was no evidence of any betting on their part, and neither would face criminal charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/11219916/from/RSS/ 'I didn't bet,' Gretzky repeats after allegations] Associated Press via NBC Sports February 10, 2006. Retrieved July 31, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;They were trying to paint something that just wasn't true,&quot; Jones later told ''Chatelaine Magazine''. &quot;It's unfair that Wayne and I have had a great marriage for 20 years and a nice family, and the people in the media could care less if they are trying to cause friction in your marriage, trouble in your family, and make your kids feel a certain way. That was a little hurtful because it was like, 'Why? What have we ever done to you?'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.chatelaine.com/english/life/article.jsp?content=20070213_095916_6172 Growing Up Gretzky ''Chatelaine Magazine''] May 2007. Retrieved July 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, she took part in a high-stakes [[golf]] tournament broadcast by [[ESPN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pokernews.com/news/2007/8/sextons-corner-six-high-stakes-golf-gretzky.htm High Stakes Golf and Janet Jones-Gretzky] ''PokerNews.com'' August 20, 2007. Retrieved July 31, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The NHL prohibits personnel from betting on its own games, but does not have a policy against other sports betting.

On March 15, 2006, the New Jersey Attorney General's Office announced it would [[subpoena]] Jones to testify about the alleged ring as soon as a grand jury convenes. On May 8, Tocchet and Jones filed notices in [[New Jersey]] that they intend to sue the state for defamation, claiming each lost business opportunities in the wake of the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azcentral.com/sports/coyotes/articles/0526gretzky0526.html Tocchet, Gretzky's wife start suits&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
