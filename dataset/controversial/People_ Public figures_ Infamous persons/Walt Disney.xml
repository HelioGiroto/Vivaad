'''Walter Elias''' &quot;'''Walt'''&quot; '''Disney''' (December 5, 1901&amp;nbsp;– December 15, 1966) was an American film producer, director, screenwriter, voice actor, [[animator]], entrepreneur, entertainer, [[Cultural icon|international icon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Walt Disney Helped Wernher von Braun Sell Americans on Space|url=http://www.space.com/news/spacehistory/vonbraun_disney_020813.html| agency=Associated Press |author= Dave Bryan |date= August 13, 2002|accessdate=2010-09-27|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090524060442/http://www.space.com/news/spacehistory/vonbraun_disney_020813.html |archivedate=May 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and philanthropist, well known for his influence in the field of entertainment during the 20th century. Along with his brother [[Roy O. Disney]], he was co-founder of Walt Disney Productions, which later became one of the best-known motion picture producers in the world. The corporation is now known as [[The Walt Disney Company]] and had an annual revenue of approximately US$36 billion in the 2010 financial year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1001039/000119312510268910/d10k.htm|title=2010 Form 10-K, Walt Disney Company|publisher=United States Securities and Exchange Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disney is particularly noted as a film producer and a popular showman, as well as an innovator in animation and [[theme park]] design. He and his staff created some of the world's most well-known fictional characters including [[Mickey Mouse]], for whom Disney himself provided the original voice. During his lifetime he received four honorary [[Academy Award]]s and won 22 Academy Awards from a total of 59 nominations, including a record four in one year,&lt;ref name=&quot;academyaward&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Walt Disney Academy awards | url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/index.jsp | publisher=[[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]]|accessdate=2008-05-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; giving him [[List of Academy Awards for Walt Disney|more awards and nominations]] than any other individual in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://awardsdatabase.oscars.org/ampas_awards/help/helpMain.jsp?helpContentURL=statistics/indexStats.html|title=Results Page – Academy Awards Database|accessdate=February 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disney also won seven [[Emmy Award]]s and gave his name to the [[Disneyland]] and [[Walt Disney World Resort]] theme parks in the U.S., as well as the international resorts [[Tokyo Disney Resort]], [[Disneyland Paris]], and [[Hong Kong Disneyland]].

The year after his December 15, 1966 death from lung cancer in [[Burbank, California]], construction began on Walt Disney World Resort in Florida. His brother Roy Disney inaugurated the [[Magic Kingdom]] on October 1, 1971.

==1901–1937: Beginnings==

===Childhood===
[[Image:Flora and Elias Disney.JPG|thumb|Walt’s parents, Elias and Flora (Call) Disney]]
Disney was born on December 5, 1901, at 2156 N. Tripp Avenue in Chicago's [[Hermosa, Chicago|Hermosa]] [[community areas in Chicago|community area]] to [[Irish-Canadian]] father [[Elias Disney]] and [[Flora Call Disney]], who was of [[German-American|German]] and English descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.suntimes.com/lifestyles/1790811,disney-walt-museum-san-francisco-092709.article| title=Walt Disney, the man behind the mouse| date=September 27, 2009| accessdate=2010-10-21| work=Chicago Sun-Times| author=Lori Rackl| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091003001653/http://www.suntimes.com/lifestyles/1790811,disney-walt-museum-san-francisco-092709.article |archivedate=October 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;disneybio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Walt Disney biography|url=http://www.justdisney.com/WaltDisney100/biography01.html|publisher=Just Disney|accessdate=2008-05-21|archivedate=June 5, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080605151444/http://www.justdisney.com/WaltDisney100/biography01.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His great-grandfather, Arundel Elias Disney, had emigrated from [[Gowran]], [[County Kilkenny]], Ireland where he was born in 1801. Arundel Disney was a descendant of Robert d'[[Isigny-sur-Mer|Isigny]], a Frenchman who had travelled to England with [[William the Conqueror]] in 1066.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Disneyland Paris|publisher=[[Michelin]]|date=August 7, 2002|isbn=2-06-048002-7|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the d'Isigny name [[anglicised]] as &quot;Disney&quot;, the family settled in a village now known as [[Norton Disney]], south of the city of [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]], in the county of [[Lincolnshire]].

In 1878, Disney's father Elias had moved from [[Huron County, Ontario]], Canada to the United States at first seeking gold in California before finally settling down to farm with his parents near [[Ellis, Kansas]], until 1884. Elias worked for the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] and married Flora Call on January 1, 1888, in [[Acron, Florida]], just 40 miles north of where [[Walt Disney World]] would ultimately be developed. The family moved to [[Chicago, Illinois]], in 1890,&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler7&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  hometown of his brother Robert&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler7&quot; /&gt; who helped Elias financially for most of his early life.&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler7&quot; /&gt;  In 1906, when Walt was four, Elias and his family moved to a farm in [[Marceline, Missouri]],&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler4&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; where his brother Roy had recently purchased farmland.&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler4&quot; /&gt;  In Marceline, Disney developed his love for drawing&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler15&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; with one of the family's neighbors, a retired doctor named &quot;Doc&quot; Sherwood, paying him to draw pictures of Sherwood's horse, Rupert.&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler15&quot; /&gt; His interest in trains also developed in Marceline, a town that owed its existence to the [[Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway]] which ran through it. Walt would put his ear to the tracks in anticipation of the coming train&lt;ref name=&quot;disneybio&quot;/&gt; then try and spot his uncle, engineer Michael Martin, conducting the train.

The Disneys remained in Marceline for four years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.waltdisneymuseum.org/|title=Walt Disney Hometown Museum|publisher=Walt Disney Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; before moving to [[Kansas City Metropolitan Area|Kansas City]] in 1911&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler19&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  where Walt and his younger sister Ruth attended the Benton Grammar School. At school he met Walter Pfeiffer who came from a family of theatre aficionados, and introduced Walt to the world of vaudeville and motion pictures. Before long Walt was spending more time at the Pfeiffers' than at home.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1991|pp=33–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As well as attending Saturday courses at the [[Kansas City Art Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kchistory.org/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/Biographies&amp;CISOPTR=31&amp;CISOBOX=1&amp;REC=2 |title=Biography of Walt Disney, Film Producer – kchistory.org – Retrieved September 14, 2009 |publisher=Kchistory.org |accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walt often took Ruth to [[Electric Park, Kansas City|Electric Park]], 15 blocks from their home, which Disney would later acknowledge as a major influence of his design of [[Disneyland]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

===Teenage years===

In 1917, Elias acquired shares in the O-Zell jelly factory in Chicago and moved his family back to the city,&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler30&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;  where in the fall Disney began his freshman year at [[List of schools in Chicago Public Schools#Former High Schools|McKinley High School]] and took night courses at the [[Chicago Art Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Thomas|1991|pp= 42–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became the cartoonist for the school newspaper, drawing patriotic topics and focusing on World War I. Despite dropping out of high school at the age of sixteen to join the [[United States Army|army]], Disney was rejected for being underage.&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler36&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his rejection by the army, Walt and a friend decided to join the [[Red Cross]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler37&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  Soon after joining he was sent to France for a year, where he drove an ambulance, but only after the armistice was signed on November 11, 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler380&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Walt01.jpg|thumb|Disney as an [[List of ambulance drivers during World War I|ambulance driver]] immediately after World War I]]
Hoping to find work outside the Chicago O-Zell factory,&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler42&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1919 Walt moved back to Kansas City to begin his artistic career.&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler44&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt; After considering whether to become an actor or a newspaper artist, he decided on a career as a newspaper artist, drawing political caricatures or comic strips. But when nobody wanted to hire him as either an artist or even as an ambulance driver, his brother Roy, then working in a local bank, got Walt a temporary job through a bank colleague at the Pesmen-Rubin Art Studio&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler44&quot; /&gt; where he created advertisements for newspapers, magazines, and movie theaters.&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler45&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;  At Pesmen-Rubin he met cartoonist [[Ub Iwerks|Ubbe Iwerks]]&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler46&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;  and when their time at the studio expired, they decided to start their own commercial company together.&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler48&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1920, Disney and Iwerks formed a short-lived company called, &quot;Iwerks-Disney Commercial Artists&quot;. However, following a rough start, Disney left temporarily to earn money at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, and was soon joined by Iwerks who was not able to run their business alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler51&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;  While working for the Kansas City Film Ad Company, where he made commercials based on [[cutout animation]]s, Disney became interested in animation, and decided to become an animator.&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler62&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt; The owner of the Ad Company, A.V. Cauger, allowed him to borrow a camera from work to experiment with at home. After reading the Edwin G. Lutz book ''Animated Cartoons: How They Are Made, Their Origin and Development'', Disney considered [[cel]] animation to be much more promising than the cutout animation he was doing for Cauger. Walt eventually decided to open his own animation business,&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler56&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; and recruited a fellow co-worker at the Kansas City Film Ad Company, [[Fred Harman]], as his first employee.&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler56&quot; /&gt; Walt and Harman then secured a deal with local theater owner Frank L. Newman, arguably the most popular &quot;showman&quot; in the Kansas City area at the time,&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler57&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; to screen their cartoons at his local theater, which they titled ''Laugh-O-Grams''.&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler57&quot; /&gt;

===Laugh-O-Gram Studio===
Presented as &quot;Newman Laugh-O-Grams&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler57&quot; /&gt;  Disney's cartoons became widely popular in the Kansas City area&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler58&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt;  and through their success, he was able to acquire his own studio, also called [[Laugh-O-Gram Studio|Laugh-O-Gram]],&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler64&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; for which he hired a vast number of additional animators, including Fred Harman's brother [[Hugh Harman]], [[Rudolf Ising]], and his close friend Ubbe Iwerks.&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler6471&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 64-71.&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, studio profits were insufficient to cover the high salaries paid to employees. Unable to successfully manage money,&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler68&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Disney's studio became loaded with debt&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler68&quot; /&gt; and wound up bankrupt&lt;ref name = &quot;gabler72&quot;/&gt; whereupon he decided to set up a studio in the movie industry's capital city, Hollywood, California.&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler76&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hollywood===
Disney and his brother Roy pooled their money and set up a cartoon studio in Hollywood&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler78&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;
where they needed to find a distributor for Walt's new [[Alice Comedies]], which he had started making while in Kansas City&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler72&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; but never got to distribute. Disney sent an unfinished print to New York distributor [[Margaret Winkler]], who promptly wrote back to him that she was keen on a distribution deal for more live-action/animated shorts based upon ''Alice's Wonderland''.&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler80&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Alice Comedies====
[[Virginia Davis]], the live-action star of ''Alice’s Wonderland'' and her family relocated from Kansas City to Hollywood at Disney's request, as did Iwerks and his family. This was the beginning of the [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney Brothers' Studio]] located on Hyperion Avenue in the [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake district]], where it remained until 1939. In 1925, Disney hired a young woman named [[Lillian Disney|Lillian Bounds]] to ink and paint celluloid. After a brief courtship, the pair married that same year.

The new series, ''[[Alice Comedies]]'', proved reasonably successful, and featured both [[Dawn O'Day]] and Margie Gay as Alice with Lois Hardwick also briefly assuming the role. By the time the series ended in 1927, its focus was more on the animated characters and in particular a cat named Julius who resembled [[Felix the Cat]], rather than the live-action Alice.

====Oswald the Lucky Rabbit====
{{Main|Oswald the Lucky Rabbit}}
By 1927, [[Charles Mintz]] had married Margaret Winkler and assumed control of her business. He then ordered a new, all-animated series to be put into production for distribution through [[Universal Pictures]]. The new series, ''[[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit]]'', was an almost instant success, and the character, Oswald – drawn and created by Iwerks – became a popular figure. The Disney studio expanded and Walt re-hired Harman, Rudolph Ising, [[Carman Maxwell]], and [[Friz Freleng]] from Kansas City.

Disney went to New York in February 1928 to negotiate a higher fee per short and was shocked when Mintz told him that not only did he want to reduce the fee he paid Disney per short but also that he had most of his main animators, including Harman, Ising, Maxwell, and Freleng—but not Iwerks, who refused to leave Disney—under contract and would start his own studio if Disney did not accept the reduced production budgets.  Universal, not Disney, owned the Oswald trademark, and could make the films without Walt. Disney declined Mintz's offer and as a result lost most of his animation staff whereupon he found himself on his own again.&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler109&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt;

It subsequently took his company 78 years to get back the rights to the Oswald character when in 2006 the [[Walt Disney Company]] reacquired the rights to Oswald the Lucky Rabbit from [[NBC Universal]], through a trade for longtime ABC sports commentator [[Al Michaels]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2324417 Stay 'tooned: Disney gets 'Oswald' for Al Michaels], at ESPN web site. Retrieved January 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mickey Mouse====
{{Main|Mickey Mouse}}
After losing the rights to Oswald, Disney felt the need to develop a new character to replace him, which was based on a mouse he had adopted as a pet while working in his Laugh-O-Gram studio in Kansas City.&lt;ref name=&quot;DisneyMuseum&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/exhibits/articles/mickeymousegoldenage/index.html |title=The Golden Age of Mickey Mouse|publisher=[[Disney]]|author=Solomon, Charles |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080710052034/http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/exhibits/articles/mickeymousegoldenage/index.html |archivedate = July 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ub Iwerks reworked the sketches made by Disney to make the character easier to animate although Mickey's voice and personality were provided by Disney himself until 1947. In the words of one Disney employee, &quot;Ub designed Mickey's physical appearance, but Walt gave him his soul.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DisneyMuseum&quot;/&gt; Besides Oswald and Mickey, a similar mouse-character is seen in the ''Alice Comedies'', which featured &quot;Ike the Mouse&quot;. Moreover, the first [[Flip the Frog]] cartoon called Fiddlesticks showed a Mickey Mouse look-alike playing fiddle. The initial films were animated by Iwerks with his name prominently featured on the title cards. Originally named &quot;Mortimer&quot;, the mouse was later re-christened &quot;Mickey&quot; by Lillian Disney who thought that the name Mortimer did not fit. Mortimer later became the name of Mickey's rival for Minnie – taller than his renowned adversary and speaking with a Brooklyn accent.

The first animated short to feature Mickey, ''[[Plane Crazy]]'' was a [[silent film]] like all of Disney's previous works. After failing to find a distributor for the short and its follow-up, ''[[The Gallopin' Gaucho]]'', Disney created a Mickey cartoon with [[talking picture|sound]] called ''[[Steamboat Willie]]''.

====''Silly Symphonies''====
Following in the footsteps of ''Mickey Mouse series'', a series of musical shorts titled, ''[[Silly Symphonies]]'' were released in 1929. The first, ''[[The Skeleton Dance]]'' was entirely drawn and animated by Iwerks, who was also responsible for drawing the majority of cartoons released by Disney in 1928 and 1929. Although both series were successful, the Disney studio thought it was not receiving its rightful share of profits from Pat Powers,&lt;ref name=&quot;gabler142&quot;&gt;Neal Gabler, &quot;Walt Disney:The Triumph of the American Imagination&quot; (2006), p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1930, Disney signed a new distribution deal with [[Columbia Pictures]]. The original basis of the cartoons was their musical novelty with the first Silly Symphony cartoons featuring scores by [[Carl Stalling]].&lt;ref name=DisneyMuseum2&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/exhibits/articles/sillysymphonies/index.html|title=THE BIRTH OF THE SILLY SYMPHONIES  |publisher=[[Disney]]|author=Merritt, Russell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iwerks was soon lured by Powers into opening his own studio with an exclusive contract, while Stalling would also later leave Disney to join Iwerks.&lt;ref name=Islandnet-Chronology&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/disnehis/disn1930.htm|title=Chronology of the Walt Disney Company|publisher=Island Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iwerks launched his ''[[Flip the Frog]]'' series with the first voiced color cartoon ''Fiddlesticks'', filmed in two-strip [[Technicolor]]. Iwerks also created two other cartoon series, ''[[Willie Whopper]]'' and the ''[[Comicolor]]''. In 1936, Iwerks shut down his [[Ub Iwerks Studio|studio]] in order to work on various projects dealing with animation technology. He would return to Disney in 1940 and go on to pioneer a number of film processes and specialized animation technologies in the studio's research and development department.

By 1932, although Mickey Mouse had become a relatively popular cinema character, ''Silly Symphonies'' was not as successful. The same year also saw competition increase as [[Max Fleischer]]'s flapper cartoon character, [[Betty Boop]], gained popularity among theater audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.awn.com/mag/issue2.4/AWNMag2.4.pdf|author= Langer, Mark|title=Popeye From Strip To Screen|publisher=[[Animation Magazine]]|date=July 1997|volume=2|issue=4|pages=17–19|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleischer, considered Disney's main rival in the 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9106382/Fleischer-brothers|title=Fleischer brothers|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; was also the father of [[Richard Fleischer]], whom Disney would later hire to direct his 1954 film ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]''.

===First Academy Award===
In 1932, Disney received a special Academy Award for the creation of &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot;, a series which switched to color in 1935 and soon launched spin-offs for supporting characters such as [[Donald Duck]], [[Goofy]], and [[Pluto (dog)|Pluto]]. Pluto and Donald became standalone cartoons in 1937,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/disnehis/disn1937.htm|title=Chronology of the Walt Disney Company|publisher=Island Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Goofy following in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://members.tripod.com/~kariv/bio.html|title=GOOFY BIOGRAPHY|publisher=[[Tripod.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of all Mickey's partners, Donald Duck, who first teamed up with Mickey in the 1934 cartoon, ''[[Orphan's Benefit]]'', was arguably the most popular, going on to become Disney's second most successful cartoon character of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9096160/Donald-Duck|title=Donald Duck|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Children===
The Disneys' first attempt at pregnancy ended in miscarriage. Lillian became pregnant again and gave birth to a daughter, [[Diane Marie Disney]], on December 18, 1933.&lt;ref name=&quot;wordpress1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wdwcentral.wordpress.com/2008/12/01/the-windows-on-main-street-sharon-lund/ |title=The Windows on Main Street: Sharon Lund « WDW Central |publisher=Wdwcentral.wordpress.com |date=December 1, 2008 |accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Disneys adopted [[Sharon Mae Disney]] (December 31, 1936 – February 16, 1993).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com |title=Social Security Death Index |publisher=Ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date=May 26, 2011 |accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1937–1941: Golden age of animation==

===&quot;Disney's Folly&quot;: ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs''===

[[Image:Walt Disney Snow white 1937 trailer screenshot (13).jpg|left|thumb|Walt Disney introduces
each of the Seven Dwarfs in a scene from the original 1937 ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]'' theatrical trailer.]]

Following the creation of two cartoon series, in 1934 Disney began planning a full-length feature. The following year, opinion polls showed that another cartoon series, ''[[Popeye the Sailor]]'', produced by Max Fleischer, was more popular than Mickey Mouse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://forums.goldenagecartoons.com/showthread.php?t=2907|title=Popeye's Popularity – Article from 1935  |publisher=Golden Age Cartoons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Disney was able to put Mickey back on top as well as increase his popularity by colorizing and partially redesigning the character to become what was considered his most appealing design to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;DisneyMuseum&quot; /&gt; When the film industry learned of Disney's plans to produce an ''animated'' feature-length version of ''[[Snow White]]'', they were certain that the endeavor would destroy the Disney Studio and dubbed the project &quot;Disney's Folly&quot;. Both Lillian and Roy tried to talk Disney out of the project, but he continued plans for the feature, employing [[Chouinard Art Institute]] professor Don Graham to start a training operation for the studio staff. Disney then used the ''Silly Symphonies'' as a platform for experiments in realistic human animation, distinctive character animation, special effects, and the use of specialized processes and apparatus such as the [[multiplane camera]] – a new technique first used by Disney in the 1937 ''Silly Symphonies'' short ''[[The Old Mill]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.justdisney.com/walt_disney/biography/long_bio.html |title=Walt Disney, Biography|publisher=Just Disney |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070710012642/http://www.justdisney.com/walt_disney/biography/long_bio.html |archivedate = July 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All of this development and training was used to increase quality at the studio and to ensure that the feature film would match Disney's quality expectations. Entitled ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs]]'', the feature went into full production in 1934 and continued until mid-1937, when the studio ran out of money. To obtain the funding to complete ''Snow White'', Disney had to show a rough cut of the motion picture to loan officers. The film premiered at the Carthay Circle Theater on December 21, 1937 and at its conclusion the audience gave ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' a standing ovation. ''Snow White'', the first animated feature in America made in Technicolor, was released in February 1938 under a new distribution deal with [[RKO Radio Pictures]]. RKO had been the distributor for Disney cartoons in 1936, after it closed down the Van Beuren Studios in exchange for distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.imagesjournal.com/issue08/reviews/vanbeuren/|title=Cartoons that Time Forgot|publisher=Images Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film became the most successful motion picture of 1938 and earned over $8 million on its initial release, the equivalent of ${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|8000000|1938|r=-1}}}} today.

===Golden age of animation===
Following the success of ''Snow White'', for which Disney received one full-size, and seven miniature Oscar statuettes, he was able to build a new campus for the [[Walt Disney Studios (Burbank)|Walt Disney Studios]] in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], which opened for business on December 24, 1939. ''Snow White'' was not only the peak of Disney's success, but also ushered in a period that would later be known as the Golden Age of Animation for the studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.animationusa.com/resources/aboutdisney.html|title=Walt Disney Studio Biography |publisher=Animation USA|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100531022524/http://www.animationusa.com/resources/aboutdisney.html |archivedate=May 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/exhibits/articles/goldenage/index.html|title=The Golden Age of Animation  |publisher=[[Disney]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feature animation staff, having just completed ''[[Pinocchio (1940 film)|Pinocchio]]'', continued work on ''[[Fantasia (film)|Fantasia]]'' and ''[[Bambi]]'' as well as the early production stages of ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'', ''[[Peter Pan (1953 film)|Peter Pan]]'' and ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad|Wind in the Willows]]'' while the shorts staff carried on working on the ''Mickey Mouse'', ''Donald Duck'', ''Goofy'', and ''Pluto'' cartoon series, ending the ''Silly Symphonies'' at this time.{{Clarify|post-text=More info needed on end of the Silly Symphonies to make a new and separate sentence.|date=May 2011}} Animator Fred Moore had redesigned Mickey Mouse in the late 1930s after Donald Duck overtook him in popularity among theater audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.bcdb.com/bcdb/cartoon.cgi?film=15&amp;m=r|title=Fantasia Review|publisher=The Big Cartoon Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pinocchio'' and ''Fantasia'' followed ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs'' into the movie theaters in 1940, but both proved financial disappointments. The inexpensive ''[[Dumbo]]'' was then planned as an income generator, but during production most of the animation staff [[Disney animators' strike|went on strike]], permanently straining relations between Disney and his artists.

==1941–1945: World War II era==

In 1941, the U.S. State Department sent Disney and a group of animators to South America as part of its [[Good Neighbor policy]], at the same time guaranteeing financing for the resultant movie, ''[[Saludos Amigos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.waltandelgrupo.com/ Walt &amp; El Grupo] (documentary film, 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the release of ''Dumbo'' in October 1941, the US entered World War II. The [[U.S. Army]] and [[United States Navy|Navy]] [[Bureau of Aeronautics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/ref/USN-Act/CA.html|title=U.S. Naval Activities World War II by State|publisher=Patrick Clancey|accessdate=2012-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; contracted most of the Disney studio's facilities where the staff created training and instruction films for the military, home-front morale-boosting shorts such as ''[[Der Fuehrer's Face]]'' and the 1943 feature film ''[[Victory Through Air Power (film)|Victory Through Air Power]]''. However, military films did not generate income, and the feature film ''[[Bambi]]'' underperformed on its release in April 1942. Disney successfully re-issued ''Snow White'' in 1944, establishing a [[Disney Vault|seven-year re-release tradition]] for his features. In 1945, ''[[The Three Caballeros]]'' was the last animated feature released by the studio during the war.

In 1944, ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' publisher [[William Benton (senator)|William Benton]], entered into unsuccessful negotiations with Disney to make six to twelve educational films per annum. Disney was asked by the US [[Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs]], Office of Inter-American Affairs (OIAA), to make an educational film about the [[Amazon Basin]], which resulted in the 1944 animated short, ''The Amazon Awakens''.&lt;ref&gt;Gabler, 2006, p.444&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cramer, Gisela; Prutsch, Ursula, [http://hahr.dukejournals.org/cgi/content/citation/86/4/785 &quot;Nelson A.

==1945–1955: Post-war period==
Disney studios also created inexpensive package films, containing collections of cartoon shorts, and issued them to theaters during this period. These included ''[[Make Mine Music]]'' (1946), ''[[Melody Time]]'' (1948), ''[[Fun and Fancy Free]]'' (1947) and ''[[The Adventures of Ichabod and Mr. Toad]]'' (1949). The latter had only two sections, the first based on ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' by [[Kenneth Grahame]], and the second on ''[[The Legend of Sleepy Hollow]]'' by [[Washington Irving]]. During this period, Disney also ventured into full-length dramatic films that mixed live action and animated scenes, including ''[[Song of the South]]'' and ''[[So Dear to My Heart]]''. After the war ended, Mickey's popularity would also fade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/exhibits/articles/mickeymousepostwar/index.html|title=Mickey in the Post-War Era|publisher=[[Disney]]|author=Solomon, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1940s, the studio had recovered enough to continue production on the full-length features ''[[Alice in Wonderland (1951 film)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' and ''[[Peter Pan (1953 movie)|Peter Pan]]'', both of which had been shelved during the war years. Work also began on ''[[Cinderella (1950 film)|Cinderella]]'', which became Disney's most successful film since ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs''. In 1948 the studio also initiated a series of live-action nature films, titled ''True-Life Adventures'', with ''On Seal Island'' the first. Despite its resounding success with feature films, the studio's animation shorts were no longer as popular as they once were, with people paying more attention to Warner Bros. and their animation star [[Bugs Bunny]]. By 1942, [[Leon Schlesinger Productions]], which produced the Warner Bros. cartoons, had become the country's most popular animation studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.animationusa.com/resources/aboutwb.html|title=Warner Bros.

During the mid-1950s, Disney produced a number of educational films on the space program in collaboration with [[NASA]] rocket designer [[Wernher von Braun]]: ''Man in Space'' and ''Man and the Moon'' in 1955, and ''Mars and Beyond'' in 1957.

Disney was a founding member of the anti-communist group [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals]].{{citation}} In 1947, during the [[Second Red Scare]],&lt;ref name=CNN&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.cnn.com/SPECIALS/cold.war/episodes/06/documents/huac/disney.html|title=Testimony of Walter E.

All three men denied the allegations and Sorrell went on to testify before the HUAC in 1946 when insufficient evidence was found to link him to the Communist Party.&lt;ref&gt;Cogley, John (1956) Report on Blacklisting, Volume I, Movies Fund for the Republic, New York, p. 34 OCLC 3794664; reprinted in 1972 by Arno Press, New York ISBN 0-405-03915-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Communist brochure&quot; Screen Actors Guild Retrieved October 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Disney also accused the [[Screen Cartoonists Guild]] of being a Communist front, and charged that the 1941 strike was part of an organized Communist effort to gain influence in Hollywood.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt;

On a business trip to Chicago in the late-1940s, Disney drew sketches of his ideas for an [[amusement park]] where he envisioned his employees spending time with their children. The idea for a children's theme park came after a visit to [[Children's Fairyland]] in [[Oakland, California]]. It also said that Disney may have been inspired to create Disneyland in the park [[Republic of the Children]] located in [[Manuel B. Gonnet]], [[La Plata]], Argentina, and opened in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fundacionvalorar.org.ar/republica2008/Historia.asp |title=República de los Niños – Historia del Proyecto |publisher=Fundacionvalorar.org.ar |accessdate=April 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This plan was originally intended to be built on a plot located across the street to the south of the studio. These original ideas developed into a concept for a larger enterprise that would become [[Disneyland Park (Anaheim)|Disneyland]]. Disney spent five years developing Disneyland and created a new subsidiary company, [[WED Enterprises]], to carry out planning and production of the park. A small group of Disney studio employees joined the Disneyland development project as engineers and planners, and were dubbed [[Walt Disney Imagineering|Imagineer]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

As Disney explained one of his earliest plans to [[Herbert Ryman|Herb Ryman]], who created the first aerial drawing of Disneyland presented to the [[Bank of America]] during fund raising for the project, he said, &quot;Herbie, I just want it to look like nothing else in the world. And it should be surrounded by a train.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://disneyspace.tripod.com/id1.html|title=Walt Disney Quotes|publisher=[[Tripod.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entertaining his daughters and their friends in his backyard and taking them for rides on his [[Carolwood Pacific Railroad]] had inspired Disney to include a railroad in the plans for Disneyland.

===Disneyland grand opening===
[[Image:Waltopening.jpg|thumb|right|Walt Disney giving the dedication day speech July 17, 1955]]
On Sunday, July 17, 1955, Disneyland hosted a live TV preview, among the thousands of people in attendance were [[Ronald Reagan]], [[Bob Cummings]] and [[Art Linkletter]], who shared cohosting duties, as well as the mayor of Anaheim. Walt gave the following dedication day speech:
{{cquote|To all who come to this happy place; welcome. Disneyland is your land. Here age relives fond memories of the past .... and here youth may savor the challenge and promise of the future. Disneyland is dedicated to the ideals, the dreams and the hard facts that have created America ... with the hope that it will be a source of joy and inspiration to all the world.}}

===Carolwood Pacific Railroad===
[[Image:LillybelleDland.jpg|thumb|The Lilly Belle on display at Disneyland Main Station in 1993. The caboose's woodwork was done entirely by Walt himself.]]
{{Main|Carolwood Pacific Railroad}}
During 1949, Disney and his family moved to a new home on a large piece of land in the [[Holmby Hills]] district of Los Angeles, California. With the help of his friends [[Ward Kimball|Ward and Betty Kimball]], who already had their own [[backyard railroad]], Disney developed blueprints and immediately set to work on creating a miniature [[live steam]] railroad for his backyard. The name of the railroad, [[Carolwood Pacific Railroad]], came from his home's location on Carolwood Drive. The railroad's half-mile long layout included a {{convert|46|ft|m|adj=mid}} long trestle bridge, loops, overpasses, gradients, an elevated berm, and a {{convert|90|ft|m|sing=on}} tunnel underneath his wife's flowerbed. He named the miniature working steam locomotive built by Disney Studios engineer [[Roger E. Broggie]] ''Lilly Belle'' in his wife's honor and had his attorney draw up right-of-way papers giving the railroad a permanent, legal easement through the garden areas, which his wife dutifully signed; however, there is no evidence of the documents ever recorded as a restriction on the property's title.{{Clarify|date=May 2011}}

===Expansion into new areas===
As Walt Disney Productions began work on Disneyland, it also began expanding its other entertainment operations. In 1950, ''[[Treasure Island (1950 film)|Treasure Island]]'' became the studio's first all-live-action feature, soon followed by ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (in [[CinemaScope]], 1954), ''[[Old Yeller (1957 film)|Old Yeller]]'' (1957), ''[[The Shaggy Dog (1959 film)|The Shaggy Dog]]'' (1959), ''[[Pollyanna (1960 film)|Pollyanna]]'' (1960), ''[[Swiss Family Robinson (1960 film)|Swiss Family Robinson]]'' (1960), ''[[The Absent-Minded Professor]]'' (1961), and ''[[The Parent Trap (1961 film)|The Parent Trap]]'' (1961). The studio produced its first TV special, ''[[One Hour in Wonderland]]'', in 1950. Disney began hosting a [[Walt Disney anthology series|weekly anthology series]] on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] entitled ''[[Disneyland TV show|Disneyland]]'', after the park, on which he aired clips of past Disney productions, gave tours of his studio, and familiarized the public with Disneyland as it was being constructed in Anaheim. The show also featured a [[Davy Crockett]] miniseries, which started the &quot;Davy Crockett craze&quot; among American youth, during which millions of coonskin caps and other Crockett memorabilia were sold across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/exhibits/articles/tvworldsofdisney/index.html|title=The Television Worlds of Disney – PART II|publisher=[[Disney]]|author=Cotter, Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, the studio's first daily television show, ''[[Mickey Mouse Club]]'' debuted on ABC. It was a groundbreaking comedy/variety show aimed specifically for children. Disney took a strong personal interest in the show and even returned to the animation studio to voice Mickey Mouse in its animated segments during its original 1955–59 production run. [[The Mickey Mouse Club]] would continue in various incarnations in syndication and on the Disney Channel into the 1990s.

As the studio expanded and diversified into other media, Disney devoted less of his attention to the animation department, entrusting most of its operations to his key animators, whom he dubbed the [[Nine Old Men]]. Although he was spending less time supervising the production of the animated films, he was always present at story meetings.&lt;ref&gt;John Lasseter-Commentary-Sleeping Beauty-2008 DVD&lt;/ref&gt; During Disney's lifetime, the animation department created the successful ''[[Lady and the Tramp]]'' (the first animated film in [[CinemaScope]]) in 1955, ''[[Sleeping Beauty (1959 film)|Sleeping Beauty]]'' (the first animated film in [[Super Technirama]] [[70mm]]) in 1959, ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' (the first animated feature film to use [[cel|Xerox cels]]) in 1961, and ''[[The Sword in the Stone (film)|The Sword in the Stone]]'' in 1963.

Production of short cartoons kept pace until 1956, when Disney shut down the responsible division although special shorts projects would continue for the remainder of the studio's duration on an irregular basis. These productions were all distributed by Disney's new subsidiary, [[Buena Vista Distribution]], which had taken over all distribution duties for Disney films from [[RKO]] by 1955. Disneyland, one of the world's first theme parks, finally opened on July 17, 1955, and was immediately successful. Visitors from around the world came to visit Disneyland, which contained attractions based on a number of successful Disney characters and films.

After 1955, the ''Disneyland'' TV show was renamed ''Walt Disney Presents''. It switched from black-and-white to color in 1961 and changed its name to ''Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color'', at the same time moving from ABC to NBC,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/disnehis/disn1961.htm|title=Chronology of the Walt Disney Company|publisher=Island Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; and eventually evolving into its current form as ''[[Walt Disney anthology series|The Wonderful World of Disney]]''. The series continued to air on NBC until 1981, when it was picked up by CBS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/disnehis/disn1981.htm|title=Chronology of the Walt Disney Company|publisher=Island Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, it has aired on ABC, NBC, the Hallmark Channel and the Cartoon Network via separate broadcast rights deals. During its run, the Disney series offered some recurring characters, such as the newspaper reporter and sleuth &quot;Gallegher&quot; played by [[Roger Mobley]] with a plot based on the writings of [[Richard Harding Davis]].

Disney had already formed his own music publishing division in 1949 and in 1956, partly inspired by the huge success of the television theme song [[The Ballad of Davy Crockett]], he created a company-owned record production and distribution entity called [[Disneyland Records]].

===Early 1960s successes===
[[Image:Shermans042.jpg|thumb|left|(Left to right) [[Robert B. Sherman]], [[Richard M. Sherman]] and Walt Disney sing &quot;[[There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow]]&quot; (1964)]]
By the early 1960s, the Disney empire had become a major success, and Walt Disney Productions had established itself as the world's leading producer of family entertainment. Walt Disney was the Head of Pageantry for the [[1960 Winter Olympics]].

After decades of pursuit, Disney finally acquired the rights to [[P.L. Travers]]' books about a magical nanny. ''[[Mary Poppins (film)|Mary Poppins]]'', released in 1964, was the most successful Disney film of the 1960s and featured a memorable song score written by Disney favorites, the [[Sherman Brothers]]. The same year, Disney debuted a number of exhibits at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]], including [[sound reproduction|Audio]]-[[Animatronic]] figures, all of which were later integrated into attractions at Disneyland and a new theme park project which was to be established on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]].

Although the studio would probably have proved major competition for [[Hanna-Barbera]], Disney decided not to enter the race and mimic Hanna-Barbera by producing Saturday morning TV cartoon series. With the expansion of Disney's empire and constant production of feature films, the financial burden involved in such a move would have proven too great.

===Plans for Disney World and EPCOT===
In early 1964, Disney announced plans to develop another theme park to be called Disney World a few miles southwest of [[Orlando, Florida]]. Disney World was to include &quot;the Magic Kingdom&quot;, a larger, more elaborate version of Disneyland. It would also feature a number of golf courses and resort hotels. The heart of Disney World, however, was to be the Experimental Prototype City (or Community) of Tomorrow, known as [[Experimental Prototype Community of Tomorrow (concept)|EPCOT]] for short.

===Mineral King Ski Resort===
During the early-to-mid 1960s, Walt Disney developed plans for a ski resort in [[Mineral King]], a glacial valley in California's [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range. He brought in experts such as the renowned Olympic ski coach and ski-area designer [[Willy Schaeffler]], who helped plan a visitor village, ski runs and ski lifts among the several bowls surrounding the valley. Plans finally moved into action in the mid 1960s, but Walt died before the actual work started. Disney's death and opposition from conservationists ensured that the resort was never built.

===Death===
Walt Disney was a chain smoker his entire adult life, although he made sure he was not seen smoking around children.&lt;ref&gt;Gabler, Neal 2006 ''Walt Disney: The Triumph of Imagination'', Alfed A. Knofph Inc, New York City&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1966, Disney was scheduled to undergo surgery to repair an old neck injury&lt;ref name=&quot;Wadisea&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/exhibits/articles/waltspassing/index.html|title=The Day Walt Died |publisher=[[Disney]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; caused by many years of playing [[polo]] at the Riviera Club in Hollywood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.mouseplanet.com/articles.php?art=ww070711ws|title=Horsing Around With Walt and Polo|publisher=Mouse Planet}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 2, during pre-operative X-rays, doctors at [[Providence St. Joseph Medical Center]], across the street from the Disney Studio, discovered a [[lung cancer|tumor in his left lung]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wa tumor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-05-21|url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/disnehis/disn1966.htm|title=Chronology of the Walt Disney Company|publisher=Island Net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five days later a biopsy showed the tumor to be malignant and to have spread throughout the entire left lung.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wa tumor&quot; /&gt; After removal of the lung, doctors informed Disney that his life expectancy was six months to two years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wa tumor&quot; /&gt; After several [[chemotherapy]] sessions, Disney and his wife spent a short amount of time in [[Palm Springs, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wadisea&quot; /&gt; On November 30, Disney collapsed at his home. He was revived by fire department personnel and rushed to St. Joseph's where on December 15, 1966, at 9:30&amp;nbsp;am, ten days after his 65th birthday, Disney died of acute circulatory collapse, caused by lung cancer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wadisea&quot; /&gt;  The last thing he reportedly wrote before his death was the name of actor [[Kurt Russell]], the significance of which remains a mystery, even to Russell.&lt;ref name=&quot;KR_Last_Word&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2007-04-24|url=http://www.starpulse.com/news/index.php/2007/04/24/kurt_russell_confirms_that_walt_disney_s|title=Kurt Russell Confirms Disney's Last Words|publisher=Star Pulse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roy O. Disney continued out with the Florida project, insisting that the name be changed to [[Walt Disney World Resort|Walt Disney World]] in honor of his brother.

The final productions in which Disney played an active role were the animated feature ''[[The Jungle Book (1967 film)|The Jungle Book]]'' and the animated short ''[[Winnie the Pooh and the Blustery Day]]'', as well as the live-action musical feature ''[[The Happiest Millionaire]]'', all released in 1967. Songwriter [[Robert B. Sherman]] recalled of the last time he saw Disney:
{{cquote|He was up in the third floor of the animation building after a run-through of ''The Happiest Millionaire''. He usually held court in the hallway afterward for the people involved with the picture. And he started talking to them, telling them what he liked and what they should change, and then, when they were through, he turned to us and with a big smile, he said, 'Keep up the good work, boys.' And he walked to his office. It was the last we ever saw of him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = K&amp;R | last = Greene | title = Inside The Dream: The Personal Story Of Walt Disney | year = 2001 | page = 180 | isbn = 0-7868-5350-6| publisher = Disney Editions}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Hibernation urban legend====
A long-standing [[urban legend]] maintains that Disney was [[Cryopreservation|cryogenically frozen]], and his frozen corpse stored beneath the [[Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction)|Pirates of the Caribbean]] ride at Disneyland.&lt;ref name = Snopes&gt;{{cite web|title= Suspended Animation | publisher = [[Snopes.com]] |url= http://www.snopes.com/disney/waltdisn/frozen.asp|accessdate=2008-05-21 | date = August 24, 2007 | last = Mikkelson | first = B &amp; DP}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, Disney's remains were cremated on December 17, 1966, and his ashes interred at the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Glendale, California]]. The [[James Bedford|first known human cryogenic freezing]] did not occur until January 1967, more than a month after Disney's death.&lt;ref name = Snopes/&gt;

According to &quot;at least one Disney publicist&quot;, as reported in the French magazine ''Ici Paris'' in 1969,  the source of the rumor was a group of Disney Studio animators with &quot;a bizarre sense of humor&quot; who were playing a final prank on their late boss.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/disney/info/wd-ice.htm &quot;Suspended Animation&quot;] Urban Legends Reference Pages  1995–2001 by Barbara and David P. Mikkelson&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the rumor is acknowledged as false by most historians, Robert Mosley (in ''Disney’s World'' (1986)) and Marc Eliot (in ''Walt Disney – Hollywood’s Dark Prince'' (1993)) argue that Disney may have known of cryonics and may have had an interest in the science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/Hoaxipedia/Walt_Disney_Frozen/ Walt Disney Frozen] Hoaxipedia.  museumofhoaxes.com &quot;Walt Disney Frozen&quot; by Elliot Feldman  2008 Alex Boese&lt;/ref&gt; However his daughter Diane wrote in 1972, &quot;There is absolutely no truth to the rumor that my father, Walt Disney, wished to be frozen. I doubt that my father had ever heard of cryonics.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

==Legacy: 1967–present==

===Continuing Disney Productions===
[[Image:Disneyland plaque.jpg|right|thumb|Plaque at the entrance that embodies the intended spirit of Disneyland by Walt Disney: to leave reality and enter fantasy]]
After Walt Disney's death, Roy Disney returned from retirement to take full control of Walt Disney Productions and WED Enterprises. In October 1971, the families of Walt and Roy met in front of [[Cinderella Castle]] at the Magic Kingdom to officially open the Walt Disney World Resort.

After giving his dedication for Walt Disney World, Roy asked Lillian Disney to join him. As the orchestra played &quot;[[When You Wish upon a Star]]&quot;, she stepped up to the podium accompanied by Mickey Mouse. He then said, &quot;Lilly, you knew all of Walt's ideas and hopes as well as anybody; what would Walt think of it [Walt Disney World]?&quot;. &quot;I think Walt would have approved,&quot; she replied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=  Griffiths, Bill|title=Grand opening of Walt Disney world|url=http://www.startedbyamouse.com/archives/GrandOpeningWDW01.shtml|accessdate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roy died from a cerebral hemorrhage on December 20, 1971, the day he was due to open the Disneyland Christmas parade.
[[Image:Disney1968.jpg|left|thumb|upright|1968 US postage stamp]]
During the second phase of the &quot;Walt Disney World&quot; theme park, EPCOT was translated by Disney's successors into [[EPCOT Center]], which opened in 1982. As it currently exists, EPCOT is essentially a living [[world's fair]], different from the actual functional city that Disney had envisioned. In 1992, Walt Disney Imagineering took the step closer to Disney's original ideas and dedicated [[Celebration, Florida]], a town built by the Walt Disney Company adjacent to Walt Disney World, that hearkens back to the spirit of EPCOT. EPCOT was also originally intended to be devoid of Disney characters which initially limited the appeal of the park to young children. However, the company later changed this policy and Disney characters can now be found throughout the park, often dressed in costumes reflecting the different pavilions.

===Disney entertainment empire===
Today, Walt Disney's animation/motion picture studios and theme parks have developed into a multi-billion dollar television, motion picture, vacation destination and media corporation that carry his name. Among other assets [[The Walt Disney Company]] owns five vacation resorts, eleven theme parks, two water parks, thirty-nine hotels, eight motion picture studios, six record labels, eleven cable television networks, and one terrestrial television network. As of 2007, the company had annual revenues of over U.S. $35 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Walt Disney corporate website|url= http://corporate.disney.go.com/investors/index.html|accessdate=2008-05-21|publisher=[[Disney]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disney Animation===
Walt Disney was a pioneer in [[character animation]]. He was one of the first people to move away from basic cartoons with just ''&quot;impossible outlandish gags&quot;'' and crudely drawn characters to an art form with heartwarming stories and characters the audience can connect to on an emotional level. The personality displayed in the characters of his films and the technological advancements remain influential when animating today. He was also considered by many of his colleagues to be a master storyteller and the animation department did not fully recover from his demise until the late 1980s in a period known as the [[Disney Renaissance]]. The most financially and critically successful films produced during this time include ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' (1988), ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' (1989), ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'' (1991), ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'' (1992) and ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994). In 1995, Walt Disney Pictures distributed [[Pixar]]'s [[Toy Story]], the first [[computer animation|computer animated]] feature film. Walt Disney's nephew [[Roy E. Disney]] claimed that Walt would have loved ''Toy Story'' and that it was ''&quot;his kind of movie&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;Roy E. Disney-The Legacy of Toy Story-Toy Story-2005, DVD&lt;/ref&gt; With the rise of computer animated films a stream of financially unsuccessful [[Traditional animation|Traditional hand-drawn animated]] features in the early years of the 2000s (decade) emerged. This led to the company's controversial decision to close the traditional animation department. The two satellite studios in Paris and [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]] were closed, and the main studio in [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] was converted to a computer animation production facility, firing hundreds of people in the process. In 2004, Disney released what was announced as their final &quot;traditionally animated&quot; feature film, ''[[Home on the Range (2004 film)|Home on the Range]]''. However, since the 2006 acquisition of [[Pixar]], and the resulting rise of [[John Lasseter]] to Chief Creative Officer, that position has changed with the largely successful 2009 film ''[[The Princess and the Frog]]''. This marked Disney's return to traditional hand-drawn animation and the studio hired back staff who had been laid-off in the past. Today, Disney produces both traditional and computer animation.

===CalArts===
In his later years, Disney devoted substantial time to funding [[The California Institute of the Arts]] (CalArts). Formed in 1961 through a merger of the [[Los Angeles Conservatory of Music]] and the [[Chouinard Art Institute]], which had helped in the training of the animation staff during the 1930s, when Disney died, one-fourth of his estate went to CalArts, which helped in building its campus. In his will, Disney paved the way for the creation of several charitable trusts which included one for the California Institute of the Arts and other for the Disney Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Walt Disney's will|url= http://www.doyourownwill.com/disney.asp|accessdate=2008-01-03|publisher=Do Your Own Will}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also donated {{convert|38|acre|km2|3|abbr=on}} of the Golden Oaks ranch in [[Valencia, California|Valencia]] for construction of the school. CalArts moved onto the Valencia campus in 1972.

In an early admissions bulletin, Disney explained: &quot;A hundred years ago, [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]] conceived of a perfect and all-embracing art, combining music, drama, painting, and the dance, but in his wildest imagination he had no hint what infinite possibilities were to become commonplace through the invention of recording, radio, cinema and television. There already have been geniuses combining the arts in the mass-communications media, and they have already given us powerful new art forms. The future holds bright promise for those who imaginations are trained to play on the vast orchestra of the art-in-combination. Such supermen will appear most certainly in those environments which provide contact with all the arts, but even those who devote themselves to a single phase of art will benefit from broadened horizons.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sunshine Muse: Art on the West Coast, 1945–1970|author=Plagens, Peter|page=159|year=2000|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|isbn=0-520-22392-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Walt Disney Family Museum===
In 2009, [[The Walt Disney Family Museum]] opened in the [[Presidio of San Francisco]].  Thousands of artifacts from Disney's life and career are on display, including 248 awards that he received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Exploring the Man Behind the Animation | first = Edward | last = Rothstein | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/01/arts/design/01disney.html?pagewanted=1 | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | date = September 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===Accusations of antisemitism and racism===
Disney was long rumored to be [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] during his lifetime, and such rumors persisted after his death. Indeed, in the 1930s he welcomed German filmmaker and Nazi propagandist [[Leni Riefenstahl]] to Hollywood to promote her film ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]''.&lt;ref name=Dargis&gt;{{cite news|last=Dargis|first=Manohla|title=And Now a Word From the Director|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/25/movies/conflicting-voices-in-lars-von-triers-words-and-works.html?scp=1&amp;sq=And%20Now%20a%20Word%20from&amp;st=Search|accessdate=September 26, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=21September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after news of [[Kristallnacht]] broke in November 1938, Disney did not cancel his invitation to Riefenstahl.&lt;ref name=Tunzelmann&gt;{{cite news|last=Tunzelmann|first=Alex von|title=The shameful legacy of the Olympic Games|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/2012/jun/14/shameful-legacy-olympics-1936-berlin|accessdate=June 15, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=June 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James, Clive (March 25, 2007). [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/books/review/James.t.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=1 &quot;Reich Star&quot;].

Graham (LOC), Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television, Vol. 13, No. 4,1993&lt;/ref&gt; 

However in 2006, Disney biographer [[Neal Gabler]], the first writer to gain unrestricted access to the Disney archives, concluded that available evidence does not support accusations of antisemitism. In a CBS interview Gabler summarized his findings: {{Cquote|That's one of the questions everybody asks me... My answer to that is, not in the conventional sense that we think of someone as being an antisemite. But he got the reputation because, in the 1940s, he got himself allied with a group called the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, which was an anti-Communist and antisemitic organization. And though Walt himself, in my estimation, was not antisemitic, nevertheless, he willingly allied himself with people who were antisemitic, and that reputation stuck. He was never really able to expunge it throughout his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/01/earlyshow/leisure/books/main2141735.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Walt Disney: More Than 'Toons, Theme Parks | date=November 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Disney eventually distanced himself from the [[Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals|Motion Picture Alliance]] in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabler 2007 458&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Gabler|first=Neal|title=Walt Disney: The Triumph of the American Imagination|year=2007|publisher=Random House|isbn=978-0-679-75747-4|page=458|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=41e-Ru0wRkEC&amp;pg=PA458}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The Walt Disney Family Museum acknowledges that Disney did have &quot;difficult relationships&quot; with some Jewish individuals, and that ethnic stereotypes common to films of the 1930s were included in some early cartoons, such as [[Three Little Pigs]] and [[The Opry House]].  However, the museum points out that he befriended many Jewish school mates;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabler 2007 458&quot;/&gt; donated to several Jewish charities (The Hebrew Orphan Asylum, [[Yeshiva College (Yeshiva University)|Yeshiva College]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabler 2007 458&quot;/&gt; Jewish Home for the Aged, [[A Flag is Born|The American League for a Free Palestine]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabler 2007 458&quot;/&gt;) and was named &quot;1955 Man of the Year&quot; by the [[B'nai B'rith]] chapter in Beverly Hills.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabler 2007 458&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disney.go.com/disneyatoz/familymuseum/collection/insidestory/inside_1933d.html |title=Walt Disney Family Museum |publisher=Disney.go.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disney was also rumoured to be a racist. According to Gabler, he was not, never expressing any hatred or bigotry against any racial group. However he would occasionally make racially insensitive remarks that were commonly used by white Americans at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabler, Neal 2006&quot;&gt;Gabler, Neal (2006) ''Walt Disney, The Triumph of American Imagination'', Page 433, Alfred A.
