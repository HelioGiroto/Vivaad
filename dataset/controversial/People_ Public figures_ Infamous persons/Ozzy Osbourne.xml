'''John Michael''' &quot;'''Ozzy'''&quot; '''Osbourne''' (born 3 December 1948) is an English [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] vocalist and songwriter, whose musical career has spanned over 40 years. Osbourne rose to prominence as lead singer of the pioneering English band [[Black Sabbath]], whose dark and hard sound helped spawn the heavy metal genre. Due to Sabbath's dark style, Osbourne became known as the &quot;Prince of Darkness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1259577/Prince-Darkness-Ozzy-Osbourne-ventures-sun-rare-family-day-wife-Sharon-daughter-Kelly.html |title=Prince of Darkness Ozzy Osbourne ventures into the sun for a rare family day out with wife Sharon and daughter Kelly | Mail Online |work=Daily Mail |location=London |accessdate=13 October 2010  |first=Georgina |last=Littlejohn |date=22 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Osbourne is also known as the &quot;[[Honorific nicknames in popular music|Godfather of Heavy Metal]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2002/ozzy_int.asp|title=Ozzy Osbourne: the Godfather of Metal|first=Gabriella|date=June 2002|publisher=[[NY Rock]]|accessdate=16 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 2000s, Osbourne's career expanded when he became a star in his own reality show ''[[The Osbournes]]'', alongside wife/manager [[Sharon Osbourne|Sharon]] and two of their three children, [[Kelly Osbourne|Kelly]] and [[Jack Osbourne|Jack]]. A documentary about his life and career, ''God Bless Ozzy Osbourne'', premiered in April 2011 at the [[Tribeca Film Festival]] and was released on DVD in November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicfilmweb.com/2011/08/ozzy-osbourne-music-film-premiere/ Two Nights of Ozzy Doc at a Multiplex Near You] ''MusicFilmWeb.com'' Retrieved 8 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Osbourne has achieved multi-[[RIAA certification|platinum]] status as a solo artist and with Black Sabbath and has sold over 100&amp;nbsp;million albums worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wall&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Mick Wall|title=Diary of a Madman – The Official Biography|publisher=Zomba Books|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/news/ozzy-osbourne-to-receive-billboard-s-legend-1004013639.story#/news/ozzy-osbourne-to-receive-billboard-s-legend-1004013639.story Ozzy Osbourne To Receive Billboard's Legend Of Live Award] ''Billboard'' Retrieved 8 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Early life===
John Michael &quot;Ozzy&quot; Osbourne was born in [[Aston]], Birmingham, England, on 3&amp;nbsp;December&amp;nbsp;1948. His father Jack worked shifts as a [[Tool and die maker|toolmaker]] at [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]]. His mother Lillian worked for the car components firm [[Lucas Industries|Lucas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ozzy&quot;&gt;Sue Crawford (2003),&quot;Ozzy Unauthorized&quot; ISBN 978-1-84317-016-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;esquire&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Ross|title=What I've Learned: Ozzy Osbourne|url=http://men.msn.com/articlees.aspx?cp-documentid=760888|work=Esquire (magazine)|month=January | year=2005|accessdate=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; John was the fourth of six children. Ozzy had two brothers (Paul and Tony) and three sisters (Jean, Iris and Gillian); they lived in a small two-bedroom home at 14&amp;nbsp;Lodge Road in Aston. The nickname &quot;Ozzy&quot; was first used when he was in primary school. Although called &quot;John&quot; by his first wife Thelma, Osbourne states that it has been a long time since he's recognized himself when called by his formal name.&lt;ref name=&quot;I Am Ozzy&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last1 = Osbourne | first1=Ozzy | last2 = Ayres | first2 = Chris | title = I Am Ozzy | publisher=Grand Central Publishing | page = 84 | isbn = 0-446-56989-5 |ref = harv |postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osbourne grew up dealing with [[dyslexia]] and other learning disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Appleyard |first = Bryan | title=Blizzard of Oz |work=[[The Sunday Times]] (magazine) | date=27 November 2005 | url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2099-1879431,00.html|accessdate=17 September 2006 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0211/30/pitn.00.html|title= Profiles of Ozzy Osbourne, Elvis Costello, David Bowie, Norah Jones|publisher=CNN | accessdate=20 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; General abuse from teachers at Prince Albert Road Junior School, and Birchfield Road [[Secondary modern school|Secondary Modern School]] in [[Perry Barr]] made his childhood difficult for him. Drawn to the stage, Osbourne took part in school plays such as ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]''. Upon hearing their first hit single at age&amp;nbsp;14, he became a great fan of [[The Beatles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ozzy&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;esquire&quot;/&gt; He left school at 15 and was then employed as a construction site labourer, trainee [[plumber]], apprentice toolmaker, car factory horn-tuner and [[slaughterhouse]] worker.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ozzy&quot;/&gt; He spent six weeks in [[Birmingham (HM Prison)|Winson Green Prison]] when he was unable to pay a fine after being found guilty of burglary of a clothes shop.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ozzy&quot;/&gt;

In late 1967, [[Geezer Butler]] formed his first band, Rare Breed, with Osbourne. The band played two shows, then broke up. Osbourne and Butler reunited in Polka Tulk Blues, along with guitarist [[Tony Iommi]] and drummer [[Bill Ward (musician)|Bill Ward]]. They renamed themselves Earth, but after being accidentally booked for a show instead of a different band with the same name, they decided to change their name again. They finally chose the name [[Black Sabbath]] in early 1969, based on [[Black Sabbath (film)|the film of the same name]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last=Ankeny |first = Jason | title=Biography-Geezer Butler | url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p61332|pure_url=yes}}|accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band had noticed how people enjoyed being frightened; inspired, the band decided to play a heavy [[blues]] style of music laced with gloomy sounds and lyrics.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Weber|first=Barry|coauthors=Prato, Greg|title=Ozzy Osbourne – Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5079|pure_url=yes}}|year=2007|accessdate=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; While recording their first album in a castle, Butler read an occult book and had a dream of a dark figure at the end of his bed. Butler told Osbourne about the dream and together they wrote the lyrics to &quot;[[Black Sabbath (song)|Black Sabbath]]&quot;, one of their first songs in a darker vein.&lt;ref name=&quot;black sabbath&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Ruhlmann|first=William|title = Black Sabbath – Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3693|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|year=2003|accessdate=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Black Sabbath===
{{Main|Black Sabbath}}
[[File:BlackSabbath19720012200.sized.jpg|right|thumb|Black Sabbath: Osbourne (right) with Tony Iommi in 1973]]
Despite only a modest investment from their U.S. record label [[Warner Bros. Records]], Black Sabbath met with swift and enduring success. Built around Tony Iommi's guitar riffs, Geezer Butler's [[lyrics]], Bill Ward's dark tempo drumbeats, and topped by Osbourne's eerie vocals, early records such as [[Black Sabbath (album)|their debut album ''Black Sabbath'']] and ''[[Paranoid (album)|Paranoid]]'' sold huge numbers, as well as getting considerable airplay. Osbourne recalls a band lament, &quot;in those days, the band wasn't very popular with the women&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;I Am Ozzy&quot;/&gt;

Just five months after the release of ''Paranoid'' the band released ''[[Master of Reality]]''. The album reached the top ten in both the United States and UK, and was certified gold in less than two months.&lt;ref name=MOR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=master%20of%20reality&amp;artist=black%20sabbath&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2009&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|title=RIAA Gold &amp; Platinum database-&quot;Master of Reality&quot;|accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s it received platinum certification&lt;ref name=MOR/&gt; and went Double Platinum in the early 21st&amp;nbsp;century.&lt;ref name=MOR/&gt; Reviews of the album were unfavorable. [[Lester Bangs]] of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' dismissed ''Master of Reality'' as &quot;naïve, simplistic, repetitive, absolute [[doggerel]]&quot;, although the very same magazine would later place the album at number 298 on their 500&amp;nbsp;Greatest Albums of All Time list, compiled in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;Master of Reality Album Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/reviews/album/2747/21209|title=Master of Reality Rolling Stone Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black Sabbath's ''[[Black Sabbath Vol. 4|Volume&amp;nbsp;4]]'' was released in September&amp;nbsp;1972. Critics were again dismissive of the album, yet it achieved gold status in less than a month. It was the band's fourth consecutive release to sell one million copies in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Biography&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=AMG Biography |author=Ruhlmann, William |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3693|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=14 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=V4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=BLACK%20SABBATH%20-%20VOL.%204&amp;artist=black%20sabbath&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2009&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|title=RIAA Gold &amp; Platinum database-&quot;Vol. 4&quot;|accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November&amp;nbsp;1973, Black Sabbath released the critically acclaimed ''[[Sabbath Bloody Sabbath]]''. For the first time, the band received favourable reviews in the mainstream press. Gordon Fletcher of ''Rolling Stone'' called the album &quot;an extraordinarily gripping affair&quot;, and &quot;nothing less than a complete success&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fletcher, Gordon |title=''Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath'' Album Review |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blacksabbath/albums/album/227113/review/5946174/sabbath_bloody_sabbath |work=Rolling Stone Magazine  |work=14 February 1974 |accessdate=25 February 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071230064106/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blacksabbath/albums/album/227113/review/5946174/sabbath_bloody_sabbath |archivedate = 30 December 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Allmusic]]'s'' Eduardo Rivadavia call the album a &quot;masterpiece, essential to any heavy metal collection&quot;, while also claiming the band displayed &quot;a newfound sense of finesse and maturity&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SBS AMG Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Rivadavia, Eduardo |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r2002|pure_url=yes}} |title=Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath AMG Review |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=25 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album marked the band's fifth consecutive platinum selling album in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=SABBATH,%20BLOODY%20SABBATH&amp;artist=Black%20Sabbath&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2009&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|title=RIAA Gold &amp; Platinum database-''Sabbath Bloody Sabbath''|accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Sabotage (Black Sabbath album)|Sabotage]]'' was released in July 1975. Again there were favourable reviews. ''Rolling Stone'' stated, &quot;''Sabotage'' is not only Black Sabbath's best record since ''Paranoid'', it might be their best ever.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=1975 |month=September |author=Altman, Billy |title=''Sabotage'' Album Review |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blacksabbath/albums/album/170807/review/5946986/sabotage |work=25 September 1975 |accessdate=25 February 2008|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071231125738/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/blacksabbath/albums/album/170807/review/5946986/sabotage |archivedate = 31 December 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Allmusic'' was not so favourable. They noted that &quot;the magical chemistry that made such albums as ''Paranoid'' and ''Volume&amp;nbsp;4'' so special was beginning to disintegrate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AMG Sabotage&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Prato, Greg |title=''Sabotage'' AMG Album Review |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r2003|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=20 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Technical Ecstasy]]'', released on 25&amp;nbsp;September&amp;nbsp;1976, was also met with mixed reviews. ''AllMusic'' gave the album two stars, and noted that the band was &quot;unravelling at an alarming rate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;TE AMG Review&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Prato, Greg |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r2004|pure_url=yes}} |title=Technical Ecstasy AMG Review |publisher=Allmusic.com |accessdate=17 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departure===
In 1978, Osbourne left the band for three months to pursue interest in a solo project he called ''Blizzard of Ozz.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Necromandus&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Pete Sarfas (Taken from the CD reissue of “Orexis Of Death plus...”) (AACD 051), March 2005| url=http://www.alexgitlin.com/npp/necromandus.htm |title=Necromandus|publisher=alexgitlin.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Necr1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://orexisofdeath.blogspot.com/2007/08/necromandus.html|title=Necromandus|publisher=http://orexisofdeath.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three members of the band ''[[Necromandus]]'', who had supported Black Sabbath in Birmingham when they were called ''Earth,'' did backup for Osbourne in the studio and briefly became the first incarnation of his solo band. At the request of the other members, Osbourne rejoined Sabbath.&lt;ref name=&quot;Necr2&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.btinternet.com/~fenderstrat2/Necromandus.htm|title=Cumbrian Bands of the Seventies: Necromandus|publisher=http://www.btinternet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band spent five months at Sounds Interchange Studios in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario, Canada]], writing and recording what would become ''[[Never Say Die!]]'' &quot;It took quite a long time,&quot; Iommi said. &quot;We were getting really drugged out, doing a lot of dope. We'd go down to the sessions, and have to pack up because we were too stoned, we'd have to stop. Nobody could get anything right, we were all over the place, everybody's playing a different thing. We'd go back and sleep it off, and try again the next day.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosen93-94&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|1996|pp=93–94}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Touring in support of ''Never Say Die!'' began in May 1978 with openers [[Van Halen]]. Reviewers called Black Sabbath's performance &quot;tired and uninspired&quot;, in stark contrast to the &quot;youthful&quot; performance of Van Halen, who were touring the world for the first time.&lt;ref name=&quot;MusicMight&quot;&gt;{{cite web| author=Sharpe-Young, Garry |url=http://www.musicmight.com/artist/united+kingdom/west+midlands/birmingham/black+sabbath |title=MusicMight.com Black Sabbath Biography|publisher=MusicMight.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band filmed a performance at the [[Hammersmith Apollo|Hammersmith Odeon]] in June 1978, which was later released on DVD as ''Never Say Die''. The final show of the tour, and Osbourne's last appearance with the band (until later reunions) was in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]] on 11 December.

In 1979, back in the studio, tensions and conflict between band members were present continually. Osbourne recalls being asked to record his vocals over and over, and tracks being manipulated endlessly by Iommi.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1 = Osbourne | first1=Ozzy | last2 = Ayres | first2 = Chris | title = I Am Ozzy | publisher=Grand Central Publishing | isbn = 0-446-56989-5 |ref = harv |postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a point of contention between Osbourne and Iommi. At Iommi's insistence, and with the support of Butler and Ward, Osbourne was again fired from Black Sabbath. The reasons provided to him were that he was unreliable and had excessive [[substance abuse]] issues as compared to the other band members. Osbourne claims his drug use and alcohol consumption at that time were no better nor worse than that of the other band members.&lt;ref name = IAmOzzy/&gt;

Conflict of a sort had existed between Iommi and Osbourne from the beginning. When responding to a flyer reading &quot;Ozzy Zig Needs Gig- has own PA&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title= &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; |episodelink= |series= Seven Ages of Rock|serieslink= |credits= |network= |station= [[Yesterday (TV channel)|Yesterday]] |airdate= 5 March 2009|minutes= 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; posted in a record store, Iommi and Ward arrived at the address listed to speak with ''Ozzy Zig.'' When Osbourne answered the door, Iommi left upon discovering it was him. He knew of and disliked Osbourne from back in their school days.&lt;ref name = &quot;I Am Ozzy&quot;/&gt; The band replaced him with former [[Rainbow (band)|Rainbow]] singer [[Ronnie James Dio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;black sabbath&quot;/&gt;

===Solo career===
In 1980, under the management of Osbourne's then girlfriend (later wife), [[Sharon Osbourne|Sharon Arden]], the Ozzy Osbourne Band formed again as The Blizzard of Ozz. The first line-up of the band featured drummer [[Lee Kerslake]] (of [[Uriah Heep (band)|Uriah Heep]]), bassist / lyricist [[Bob Daisley]] (of Rainbow and later Uriah Heep), keyboardist [[Don Airey]], and guitarist [[Randy Rhoads]] (of [[Quiet Riot]]). The record company would eventually title the record ''[[Blizzard of Ozz]]'' credited simply under Osbourne's name. Co-written with Daisley and Rhoads, the album brought Osbourne considerable success on his first solo effort. The album sold very well with hard rock/heavy metal fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;/&gt; Though it is generally accepted that Osbourne and Rhoads started the band, bassist Daisley later claimed that he and Osbourne formed the band before Rhoads joined.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rockcellarmagazine.com/2012/01/12/former-ozzy-bassist-has-an-axe-to-grind-with-the-osbournes/ Former Ozzy Bassist Has An Axe To Grind With The Osbournes&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:OzzyOsbourne.jpg|thumb|upright|Osbourne performing in Cardiff, 1981|left]]
Blizzard of Ozz is one of the very few albums amongst the 100 best selling albums of the 1980s to have achieved multi-platinum status without the benefit of a Top 40 single. As of August 1997, it achieved Quadruple Platinum status according to [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]. The album is known for the globally recognised singles &quot;[[Crazy Train]]&quot; and &quot;[[Mr Crowley]]&quot;, and fan favourites &quot;Goodbye to Romance&quot; and &quot;Revelation (Mother Earth)&quot;. Although Kerslake and Daisley are credited as the studio musicians for The Blizzard of Ozz, the touring band in support of the album consisted of Osbourne, Rhoads, [[Rudy Sarzo]] (Bass) and [[Tommy Aldridge]] (Drums).

Osbourne's second album, ''[[Diary of a Madman (album)|Diary of a Madman]]'', featured more songs co-written with Bob Daisley. For his work on this album and [[Blizzard of Ozz]], [[Randy Rhoads]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;/&gt; was ranked the 85th greatest guitarist of all time by ''Rolling Stone'' magazine in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5937559/the_100_greatest_guitarists_of_all_time/|work=Rolling Stone |date=27 August 2003|accessdate=17 February 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080216161812/http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/5937559/the_100_greatest_guitarists_of_all_time/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 16 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This album is known for the singles &quot;Over the Mountain&quot; and &quot;Flying High Again&quot;; additionally, Osbourne explains in his autobiography that ''Diary'' is his own personal favourite album.&lt;ref name=&quot;I Am Ozzy&quot;/&gt;

On 19 March 1982 while Rhoads was in Florida for the follow-up ''Diary of a Madman'' tour, and a week away from playing [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City, a light aircraft piloted by Andrew Aycock (the band's tour bus driver) carrying guitarist [[Randy Rhoads]] crashed while performing low passes over the band's tour bus. In a prank turned deadly, the left wing of the aircraft clipped the bus, grazed a tree, and crashed into the attached garage of a nearby mansion killing Rhoads, Aycock, and the band's hairdresser, Rachel Youngblood. On autopsy, cocaine was found to be present in Aycock's urine.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} The crash was officially ruled the result of &quot;poor judgement by the pilot in buzzing the bus and misjudging clearance of obstacles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.planecrashinfo.com/1982/1982-15.htm|title= NTSB Accident Report for Rhoads' plane crash}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiencing firsthand the horrific death of his close friend and band mate, Osbourne fell into a deep depression.

Ex-[[Gillan]] guitarist [[Bernie Tormé]] was the first guitarist to replace Randy once the tour resumed. Torme's tenure with the band would last less than one month. During an audition for guitarists in a hotel room, Osbourne selected [[Brad Gillis]] (who went on to be one of two guitarists in [[Night Ranger]]) to finish the tour. The tour culminated in the release of the 1982 live album, ''[[Speak of the Devil (Ozzy Osbourne album)|Speak of the Devil]]'' recorded at the Ritz in New York City. A [[Tribute (Ozzy Osbourne album)|live tribute album for Rhoads]] was also later released.

Despite the difficulties, Osbourne moved on after Rhoads' death. ''Speak of the Devil'', known in the United Kingdom as ''Talk of the Devil'', was originally planned to consist of live recordings from 1981, primarily from Osbourne's solo work. Under contract to produce a live album, it ended up consisting entirely of Black Sabbath covers recorded with [[Brad Gillis]], bassist Rudy Sarzo, and drummer Tommy Aldridge. Osbourne later commented (inside the cover of &quot;Tribute&quot;) &quot;I don't give a fuck about that album. It was just a bunch of bullshit Sabbath covers.&quot;

In 1982 Osbourne appeared as lead vocalist on the [[Was (Not Was)]] pop dance track &quot;[[Shake Your Head|Shake Your Head (Let's Go to Bed)]]&quot;. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] performed backing vocals. Osbourne's cut was remixed and re-released in the early 1990s for a Was (Not Was) greatest hits album in Europe, and it cracked the UK pop chart. Madonna asked that her vocal not be restored for the hits package, so new vocals by [[Kim Basinger]] were added to complement Osbourne's lead.

In 1983 a new guitarist was recruited to play with Osbourne. [[Jake E. Lee]], formerly of [[Ratt]] and [[Rough Cutt]], joined the band to record ''[[Bark at the Moon]]''. The album, co-written with Bob Daisley, featured [[Tommy Aldridge]], and former Rainbow keyboard player Don Airey. The album contains the fan favourite &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot;. The music video for &quot;Bark at the Moon&quot; was partially filmed at the Holloway Sanitorium outside of London, England. Within weeks the album became certified gold. To date it has sold three million copies in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Billboard'' album chart history-Ozzy Osbourne|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Albums&amp;model.vnuArtistId=5355&amp;model.vnuAlbumId=942077|accessdate=15 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1986's ''[[The Ultimate Sin]]'' followed (with bassist [[Phil Soussan]] and drummer [[Randy Castillo]]), and touring behind both albums with ex-Uriah Heep keyboardist John Sinclair joining prior to the Ultimate Sin tour. A rich, bold album, it features &quot;[[Shot in the Dark (song)|Shot in the Dark]]&quot; and fan favourites &quot;Killer of Giants&quot;, &quot;Lightning Strikes&quot;, and &quot;Secret Loser&quot;. At the time of its release, ''The Ultimate Sin'' was Osbourne's highest charting studio album. The [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] awarded the album Platinum status on 14 May 1986, soon after its release; it was awarded Double Platinum status on 26 October 1994.&lt;ref name=RIAA&gt;{{cite web|title=RIAA Gold &amp; Platinum database|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=ultimate%20sin&amp;artist=ozzy%20osbourne&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2009&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|accessdate=15 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jake E. Lee and Osbourne parted ways in 1987. Osbourne continued to struggle with chemical dependency. That year he commemorated the fifth anniversary of Rhoads' death with ''[[Tribute (Ozzy Osbourne album)|Tribute]]'', live recordings from 1981 that had gone unreleased for years. In 1988 Osbourne appeared in ''[[The Decline of Western Civilization Part II: The Metal Years]]'' and told the director, [[Penelope Spheeris]], that &quot;sobriety fucking sucks&quot;. Meanwhile, Osbourne found [[Zakk Wylde]], who was the most enduring replacement for Rhoads to date. Together they recorded ''[[No Rest for the Wicked (Ozzy Osbourne album)|No Rest for the Wicked]]'' with Castillo on drums, Sinclair on keyboards, and Daisley co-writing lyrics and playing bass. The subsequent tour saw Osbourne reunited with erstwhile Black Sabbath bandmate Geezer Butler on bass. A live EP (entitled ''[[Just Say Ozzy]]'') featuring Geezer was released two years later. Butler continued to tour with Osbourne for the subsequent four tours, and was a major stage presence throughout. In 1989 Ozzy Osbourne performed at the [[Moscow Music Peace Festival]].

While very successful as a heavy metal act through the 1980s, Osbourne sustained commercial success into the 1990s, starting with 1991's ''[[No More Tears]]''. The album enjoyed much radio and [[MTV]] exposure. It also initiated a practice of bringing in outside composers to help pen Osbourne's solo material instead of relying solely upon his recording ensemble to write and arrange the music. The album was mixed by veteran rock producer [[Michael Wagener]]. Osbourne was awarded his only solo [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] for the track &quot;I Don't Want to Change the World&quot; from live album [[Live &amp; Loud]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance|Best Metal Performance]] of [[36th Grammy Awards|1994]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AllMusic No More Tears-awards&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r14650|pure_url=yes}}|title=AllMusic ''No More Tears''-awards|accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wagener also mixed the live album ''[[Live &amp; Loud]]'' released in 28&amp;nbsp;June&amp;nbsp;1993. At the time, it was to be Osbourne's final album. The album went [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] four times over,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=RIAA Gold &amp; Platinum database-''No More Tears''|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=no%20more%20tears&amp;artist=&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2009&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|accessdate=22 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ranked at number 10 on that year's [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|''Billboard'' rock charts]]. At this point Osbourne expressed his fatigue with the process of touring, and proclaimed his &quot;retirement tour&quot; (which was to be short-lived). It was called &quot;No More Tours&quot;, a pun on his No More Tears album. Prior to the tour [[Mike Inez]] took over on bass and Kevin Jones on keyboards as Sinclair was touring with The Cult. Osbourne's entire CD catalogue was remastered and reissued in 1995.

In 1995 Osbourne released ''[[Ozzmosis]]'' and returned to touring, dubbing his concert performances &quot;''The Retirement Sucks Tour''&quot;. The album reached number&amp;nbsp;4 on the U.S.&amp;nbsp;[[Billboard&amp;nbsp;200]]. The ''Recording Industry Association of America ([[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]])'' certified the album gold and platinum in that same year, and double platinum in April&amp;nbsp;1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5079|pure_url=yes}} |title=Ozzy Osbourne &gt; Charts &amp; Awards &gt; Billboard Albums |publisher=allmusic |accessdate=11 December 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album features the hard rocking fan favourites &quot;Perry Mason&quot;, &quot;Ghost Behind My Eyes&quot;, &quot;Thunder Underground&quot;, and the power ballad &quot;See You on the Other Side&quot;.

The line-up on ''Ozzmosis'' was [[Zakk Wylde]], [[Geezer Butler]] (who had just quit Black Sabbath again) and ex-''[[Bad English]]'', [[Steve Vai]] and ''[[Hardline]]'' drummer [[Deen Castronovo]], now in [[Journey (band)|Journey]]. Keyboards were played by ''[[Yes (band)|Yes]]'''s [[Rick Wakeman]] and producer Michael Beinhorn. The tour maintained Butler and Castronovo and saw Sinclair return, but a major line-up change was the introduction of ex-[[David Lee Roth]] guitarist [[Joe Holmes]]. Wylde was considering an offer to join ''[[Guns&amp;nbsp;N'&amp;nbsp;Roses]].'' Unable to wait for a decision on ''Wylde's'' departure decision, Osbourne replaced him. In early&amp;nbsp;1996, Butler and Castronovo left. Mike Inez (''[[Alice in Chains]]'') and [[Randy Castillo]] (''[[Lita Ford]]'', ''[[Mötley Crüe]]'') filled in. Ultimately, ''[[Faith No More]]'s'' [[Mike Bordin]] and ex-''[[Suicidal Tendencies]]'' bassist [[Robert Trujillo]] joined on drums and bass respectively. A greatest hits package, ''[[The Ozzman Cometh]]'' was issued in 1997.

===Ozzfest===
Osbourne's biggest financial success of the 1990s was a venture named [[Ozzfest]], created and managed by his wife/manager Sharon and assisted by his son [[Jack Osbourne|Jack]]. The first Ozzfest was held in [[Phoenix, Arizona]] on 25&amp;nbsp;October&amp;nbsp;1996 and in [[Devore, San Bernardino, California|Devore, California]] on 26&amp;nbsp;October. Ozzfest was an instant hit with metal fans, spiralling many up-and-coming groups who were featured there to broad exposure and commercial success. Some acts shared the bill with a reformed Black Sabbath during the 1997&amp;nbsp;Ozzfest tour, beginning in West Palm Beach, Florida. Osbourne reunited with the original members of Sabbath in 1997 and has performed periodically with them ever since. Ozzfest reinstated the integrity and public familiarity with the band name ''Black Sabbath''.

Since its beginning, five million people have attended Ozzfest, which has grossed over US$100&amp;nbsp;million. The festival helped promote many new hard rock and heavy metal acts of the late 1990s and early 2000s. Ozzfest helped Osbourne to become the first hard rock and heavy metal star to hit $50&amp;nbsp;million in merchandise sales. In 2005 Osbourne and his wife Sharon starred in an MTV competition reality show entitled &quot;[[Battle for Ozzfest]]&quot;. A number of yet unsigned bands send one member to compete in a challenge to win a spot on the 2005&amp;nbsp;Ozzfest and a possible recording contract. Shortly after [[Ozzfest]] 2005, Osbourne announced that he will no longer headline Ozzfest. Although he announced his retirement from Ozzfest, Osbourne came back headlining the tour. In 2006 Ozzy closed the event for just over half the concerts, leaving the others to be closed by [[System of a Down]]. He also played the closing act for the second stage at [[Shoreline Amphitheatre]] in [[Mountain View, California]] on 1&amp;nbsp;July as well as [[Randall's Island]], New York on 29&amp;nbsp;July. After the concert in [[Bristol, Virginia]], Osbourne announced he would return for another year of Ozzfest in 2007.

Tickets for the [[Ozzfest#2007: FreeFest|2007 tour]] were offered to fans free of charge, which led to some controversy. In 2008, Ozzfest was reduced to a one-day event in [[Dallas]], Texas, where Osbourne played, along with [[Metallica]] and [[King Diamond]]. In 2010, Ozzy appeared as the headliner closing the show after opening acts Halford and Mötley Crüe. The tour, though small (only six U.S.&amp;nbsp;venues and one UK&amp;nbsp;venue were played), generated rave reviews: &quot;Ozzy Osbourne is one of the greatest entertainers in history—regardless of genre or medium.&quot;—Artist Direct, 16 August 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Live Review |url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/news/article/0,,7352663,00.html |title=Live Review: OZZfest 2010, San Bernardino – Ozzy Osbourne, Mötley Crüe, Devildriver, Black Label Society, Halford |date=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;...we the eager maniacs of metal give OZZY the horns up for yet another blistering day of metal on two stages. &quot;—Hard Rock Haven, 9 September 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steve Trager |url=http://hardrockhaven.net/online/2010/ozzfest-2010/ |title=Ozzfest 2010 |date=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-army.com/?p=12252 |title=LIVE REVIEW: OZZFEST 2010 PART II |date=17 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; “Ozzfest rises up again, exceeding expectations...”—ORANGE COUNTY REGISTER, 16 August 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ozzfest.com/index.php?page=news&amp;n_id=567 |title=OZZfest 2010 Reviews / Ozzy Launches European Tour Leg |date=2 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===
[[File:Ozzy on tour in Japan.jpg|thumb|upright|Osbourne on tour in Japan]]
''[[Down to Earth (Ozzy Osbourne album)|Down to Earth]]'', Osbourne's first album of new studio material in seven years, was released on 16&amp;nbsp;October&amp;nbsp;2001. A live version filmed in Japan, ''[[Live at Budokan (Ozzy Osbourne album)|Live at Budokan]]'' followed. ''Down to Earth'' went gold in 2001, and platinum in 2003. The album features the fan favourite &quot;[[Dreamer (Ozzy Osbourne song)|Dreamer]]&quot;, a song which peaked at number&amp;nbsp;10 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard']]''s [[Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|Mainstream Rock Tracks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Billboard'' singles chart history-Ozzy Osbourne|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/retrieve_chart_history.do?model.chartFormatGroupName=Singles&amp;model.vnuArtistId=5355&amp;model.vnuAlbumId=942077|accessdate=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2002, Osbourne performed the Black Sabbath anthem &quot;Paranoid&quot; at the [[Party at the Palace]] concert in the grounds of [[Buckingham Palace]], an event in commemoration of the [[Golden Jubilee of Elizabeth II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/2024971.stm &quot;Palace party draws 15m viewers&quot;]. BBC. Retrieved 15 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Osbourne recruited former Metallica bassist [[Jason Newsted]] after he left the band in 2000 (and Trujillo replaced him on Metallica's line-up). Both Newsted and Osbourne were enthusiastic about recording an album together.

On 8 December 2003, Osbourne was rushed into emergency surgery at Wexham Park Hospital in [[Slough]], England when he had an accident with his [[all-terrain vehicle]] on his estate in [[Jordans, Buckinghamshire]]. Osbourne broke his [[Clavicle|collar bone]], eight ribs, and a neck [[Human vertebral column|vertebra]]. An operation was performed to lift the collarbone, which was believed to be resting on a major artery and interrupting blood flow to the arm. Sharon later revealed that Osbourne had stopped breathing following the crash and was resuscitated by Osbourne's then personal bodyguard, Sam Ruston. While in hospital, Osbourne achieved his first ever UK number one single, a duet of the Black Sabbath ballad, &quot;Changes&quot; with daughter Kelly. In doing so, he broke the record of the longest period between an artist's first UK chart appearance (with Black Sabbath's &quot;[[Paranoid (song)|Paranoid]]&quot;, number four in August&amp;nbsp;1970) and their first number one hit: a gap of 33&amp;nbsp;years. Since the quad accident, aside from some short-term memory problems, he fully recovered and headlined the 2004&amp;nbsp;Ozzfest, in the reunited Black Sabbath.

In 2005 Osbourne released a box set called ''[[Prince of Darkness (Ozzy Osbourne album)|Prince of Darkness]]''. The first and second discs are collections of live performances, B-sides, demos and singles. The third disc contained duets and other odd tracks with other artists, including &quot;[[Born to Be Wild]]&quot; with [[Miss Piggy]]. The fourth disc is entirely new material where Osbourne covers his favourite songs by his biggest influences and favourite bands, including [[The Beatles]], [[John Lennon]], [[David Bowie]] and others. Ozzy also helped judge the 2005 series of [[The X Factor (UK)|the X-Factor]].

In March 2006, he said that he hoped to release a new studio album soon with long time on-off guitarist, [[Zakk Wylde]] of Black Label Society. In October&amp;nbsp;2006, it was announced that Tony Iommi, Ronnie James Dio, [[Vinny Appice]], and Geezer Butler would be touring together again, though not as Black Sabbath, but under the moniker [[Heaven &amp; Hell (band)|''Heaven and Hell'']] (the title of Dio's first Black Sabbath [[Heaven and Hell (Black Sabbath album)|album]]). The response to the news on Osbourne's website was that Osbourne wished Tony and Ronnie well and that there is only one Sabbath. Osbourne's album, titled ''[[Black Rain (Ozzy Osbourne album)|Black Rain]]'', was released on 22&amp;nbsp;May&amp;nbsp;2007. Osbourne's first new studio album in almost six years, it featured a more serious tone than previous albums. &quot;I thought I'd never write again without any stimulation...But you know what? Instead of picking up the bottle I just got honest and said, 'I don't want life to go [to pieces]'&quot;, Osbourne stated in a ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' interview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/13/music.ozzy.reut/index.html|title= Ozzy Osbourne: New Album First I've done Sober|publisher=CNN |date= 13 April 2007|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osbourne revealed in July&amp;nbsp;2009 that he was currently seeking a new guitar player. While he states that he has not fallen out with [[Zakk Wylde]], he said he felt his songs were beginning to sound like [[Black Label Society]] and fancied a change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=123387|title=Ozzy Seeks New Guitarist: I Felt Like My Stuff Was Beginning To Sound Like Black Label Society|date=10 July 2009|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net|Blabbermouth]]|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, Osbourne performed at the gaming festival [[BlizzCon]] with a new guitarist in his line-up [[Gus G]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://gaming.freedomblogging.com/2009/08/11/ozzy-to-end-blizzcon-2009/2763/|title=Ozzy to end BlizzCon 2009|date=11 August 2009|work=[[The Orange County Register]]|publisher=Terry Horne|accessdate=14 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 April 2010, Osbourne announced the release date for ''Scream'' would be 15 June 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ozzy.com/news/ozzy-osbourne-to-release-new-album-scream-june-15-on-epic-records |title=OZZY OSBOURNE TO RELEASE NEW ALBUM &quot;SCREAM&quot; JUNE&amp;nbsp;22 ON EPIC RECORDS &amp;#124; The Official Ozzy Osbourne Site |publisher=Ozzy.com |accessdate=4 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release date was later changed to 22 June. A single from the album, &quot;Let Me Hear You Scream,&quot; debuted on 14 April 2010 episode of ''[[CSI: NY]]''. The song spent 8 weeks on the Billboard Rock Songs, peaking at #7. Osbourne held a Meet-And-Greet album signing at the main branch of HMV in his home-town Birmingham, followed later that day by an intimate show in the Birmingham Town Hall. The first four hundred fans that arrived at the store earlier in the day were given wrist bands, enabling free access to the show.

On 9 August, Ozzy announced that the second single from the album would be &quot;Life Won't Wait&quot; and the video for the song would be directed by his son [[Jack Osbourne|Jack]]. When asked of his opinions on ''Scream'' in an interview, Osbourne announced that he is &quot;already thinking about the next album&quot;. Osbourne's current drummer, Tommy Clufetos, has reflected this sentiment, saying that &quot;We are already coming up with new ideas backstage, in the hotel rooms and at soundcheck and have a bunch of ideas recorded&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blabbermouth&quot;&gt;{{cite web | work=Blabbermouth.net| url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=154543| title=OZZY OSBOURNE: 'Heavy Metal Thunder' Interview Available For Streaming – Feb.&amp;nbsp;25, 2011| accessdate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work===
[[File:Ozzy Osbourne band.jpg|thumb|Ozzy Osbourne band in 2011]]
Osbourne achieved greater celebrity status via his own brand of reality television. ''[[The Osbournes]]'', a series featuring the domestic life of Osbourne and his family (wife Sharon, children Jack and Kelly, occasional appearances from his son Louis, but eldest daughter Aimee did not participate). The program became one of MTV's greatest hits. It premiered on 5&amp;nbsp;March&amp;nbsp;2002, and the final episode aired 21&amp;nbsp;March&amp;nbsp;2005.

President Bush noted Osbourne's presence by joking: &quot;The thing about Ozzy is, he's made a lot of big hit recordings – 'Party with the Animals', '[[Sabbath Bloody Sabbath]]', 'Facing Hell', 'Black Skies' and 'Bloodbath in Paradise'.

Osbourne experienced [[tremor]]s for some years and linked them to his continuous drug abuse. In May&amp;nbsp;2005 he found out it was actually [[Parkin (ligase)|Parkin Syndrome]], a genetic condition, the symptoms of which are very similar to [[Parkinson's disease]].

Early in his career, Christian groups accused Osbourne of being a negative influence for teenagers, and that rock music was used to glorify [[Satanism]]. Scholar Christopher M. Moreman compared the controversy to those levelled against the occultist [[Aleister Crowley]]. Both were demonised by the media and some religious groups for their antics. Osbourne tempts the comparison with his song &quot;[[Mr Crowley]]&quot;. Both Osbourne and Crowley enjoyed the infamy of being labelled Satanists, though Osbourne firmly denies the charge and has said that he is a member of the [[Church of England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last =Moreman| first =Christopher M.| title =Devil Music and the Great Beast: Ozzy Osbourne, Aleister Crowley, and the Christian Right| journal=Journal of Religion and Popular Culture| volume =V| publisher=Department of Religious Studies and Anthropology, The University of Saskatchewan| date =Fall 2003| url =http://www.usask.ca/relst/jrpc/art5-devilmusic.html| accessdate =9 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/23/garden/at-tea-with-ozzy-osbourne-family-man-fights-fat-is-good-with-kids.html?pagewanted=4&amp;src=pm | work=The New York Times | title=AT TEA WITH: Ozzy Osbourne; Family Man.

In 1985 California teenager John McCollum committed suicide while listening to Ozzy Osbourne's &quot;[[Suicide Solution]]&quot;. The song deals with the dangers of alcohol abuse. McCollum's suicide led to allegations that Osbourne promoted suicide in his songs. Despite knowing McCollum suffered clinical depression, his parents sued Ozzy Osbourne (''McCollum v. CBS''&lt;ref&gt;Listed at FindLaw.com: 202 Cal.App.3d 989, [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/ca/calapp3d/year/1988_7.html McCollum v. CBS, Inc.], 12 July 1988.

Don't you know what it's really about?&quot; convinced McCollum to commit suicide. The family's lawyer suggested that Osbourne should be criminally charged for encouraging a young person to commit suicide, but the courts ruled in Osbourne's favour, saying there was no connection between the song and McCollum's suicide. Osbourne was sued for the same reason in 1991 (''Waller v. Osbourne''), by the parents of Michael Waller, for $9&amp;nbsp;million, but the courts ruled in Osbourne's favour again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Nuzum| first = Eric| title = [[Parental Advisory: Music Censorship in America]]| publisher=[[HarperCollins]]| year = 2001| location = New York City| pages = 57–58| isbn =0-688-16772-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; One critic claims that Osbourne sings &quot;Get the gun, get the gun, shoot, shoot, shoot,&quot; a charge firmly denied by Osbourne.

In lawsuits filed in 2000 and 2002 which were dismissed by the courts in 2003, former session musicians Bob Daisley, Lee Kerslake, and Phil Soussan claimed that Osbourne was delinquent in paying them royalties and had denied them due credit on albums they played on.&lt;ref&gt;Cosmic Debris Magazine [http://www.cosmik.com/aa-august02/daisley.html Bob Daisley].
