Mother Teresa founded the [[Missionaries of Charity]], a Roman Catholic [[Congregation (Catholic)|religious congregation]], which in 2012 consisted of over 4,500 sisters and is active in 133 countries. Members of the order must adhere to the vows of chastity, poverty and obedience, and the fourth vow, to give &quot;Wholehearted and Free service to the poorest of the poor&quot;. The Missionaries of Charity at the time of her death had 610 missions in 123 countries including hospices and homes for people with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]], leprosy and tuberculosis, soup kitchens, children's and family counselling programmes, orphanages and schools.

For over 45 years, she ministered to the poor, sick, orphaned, and dying, while guiding the Missionaries of Charity's expansion, first throughout India and then in other countries. Her [[beatification]] by [[Pope John Paul II]] following her death gave her the title &quot;Blessed Teresa of Calcutta&quot;.

She was the recipient of numerous honours including the 1979 [[Nobel Peace Prize]]. She refused the conventional ceremonial banquet given to laureates, and asked that the $192,000 funds be given to the poor in India. Her awards include the first Pope John XXIII Peace Prize, the Philippines-based Ramon Magsaysay Award, the Pacem in Terris Award, an honorary Companion of the Order of Australia, the Order of Merit from both the United Kingdom and the United States, Albania's Golden Honour of the Nation, honorary degrees, the Balzan Prize, and the Albert Schweitzer International Prize amongst many others.

Mother Teresa stated that earthly rewards were important only if they helped her help the world's needy. When Mother Teresa received the Nobel Peace Prize, she was asked, &quot;What can we do to promote world peace?&quot; She answered &quot;Go home and love your family.&quot; In her Nobel Lecture, she said: &quot;Around the world, not only in the poor countries, but I found the poverty of the West so much more difficult to remove. When I pick up a person from the street, hungry, I give him a plate of rice, a piece of bread, I have satisfied. I have removed that hunger. But a person that is shut out, that feels unwanted, unloved, terrified, the person that has been thrown out from society—that poverty is so hurtable {{sic}} and so much, and I find that very difficult.&quot; She also singled out abortion as 'the greatest destroyer of peace in the world'.

During her lifetime, Mother Teresa was named 18 times in the yearly [[Gallup's most admired man and woman poll]] as one of the ten women around the world that Americans admired most. In 1999, a poll of Americans ranked her first in [[Gallup's List of Most Widely Admired People of the 20th Century]]. In that survey, she out-polled all other volunteered answers by a wide margin, and was in first place in all major demographic categories except the very young.

Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhiu (''gonxha'' meaning &quot;rosebud&quot; or &quot;little flower&quot; in Albanian) was born on 26 August 1910, but she considered 27 August, the day she was baptized, to be her &quot;true birthday&quot;.&lt;ref name=MToC&gt;(2002) [http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20031019_madre-teresa_en.html &quot;Mother Teresa of Calcutta (1910–1997)]&quot;.

She was the youngest of the children of [[Nikollë Bojaxhiu|Nikollë]] and Dranafile Bojaxhiu (Bernai).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lester|first=Meera|title=Saints' Blessing|publisher=Fair Winds|year=2004|page=138|isbn=1-59233-045-2|url=http://books.google.com/?id=HSg6f3JaN1IC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;lpg=PA139&amp;dq=Nikolle+bojaxhiu|accessdate=14 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, who was involved in Albanian politics, died in 1919 when she was eight years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vatican.va&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Although some sources state she was 10 when her father died, in an interview with her brother, the Vatican documents her age at the time as &quot;about eight&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; After her father's death, her mother raised her as a Roman Catholic.

According to a biography by Joan Graff Clucas, in her early years Agnes was fascinated by stories of the lives of [[missionaries]] and their service in [[Bengal]], and by age 12 was convinced that she should commit herself to a religious life.&lt;ref&gt;Clucas, Joan Graff. (1988). ''Mother Teresa''. New York. Chelsea House Publications, p. 24. [[Special:Booksources/1-55546-855-1|ISBN 1-55546-855-1]].&lt;/ref&gt; Her final resolution was taken on 15 August 1928, while praying at the shrine of the [[Black Madonna]] of Letnice, where she often went on pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;Meg Greene, Mother Teresa: A Biography, Greenwood Press, 2004, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

She left home at age 18 to join the [[Sisters of Loreto]] as a missionary. She never again saw her mother or sister.&lt;ref&gt;Sharn, Lori (5 September 1997). &quot;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/mothert/mother01.htm Mother Teresa dies at 87]&quot;. ''USA Today''. Retrieved 30 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Agnes initially went to the [[Rathfarnham#Loreto Abbey|Loreto Abbey]] in [[Rathfarnham]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]], to learn English, the language the Sisters of Loreto used to teach school children in India.&lt;ref&gt;Clucas, Joan Graff. (1988). ''Mother Teresa''. New York. Chelsea House Publications, pp. 28–29. [[Special:Booksources/1-55546-855-1|ISBN 1-55546-855-1]].&lt;/ref&gt;
She arrived in India in 1929, and began her [[novitiate]] in [[Darjeeling]], near the Himalayan mountains,&lt;ref&gt;Clucas, Joan Graff. (1988). ''Mother Teresa''. New York. Chelsea House Publications, p. 31. [[Special:Booksources/1-55546-855-1|ISBN 1-55546-855-1]].&lt;/ref&gt; where she learnt [[bengali language|Bengali]] and taught at the St. Teresa’s School, a schoolhouse close to her convent.&lt;ref&gt;Meg Greene, Mother Teresa: A Biography, Greenwood Press, 2004, page 17.&lt;/ref&gt; She took her first [[religious vows]] as a nun on 24 May 1931. At that time she chose to be named after [[Thérèse de Lisieux]], the patron saint of missionaries,&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, Anne (1997).''Mother Teresa: Beyond the Image''. New York. Doubleday, p.35. [[Special:Booksources/0385489528|ISBN 0-385-48952-8]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thereseoflisieux.org/blessed-mother-teresa-of-calcu/|title=Blessed Mother Teresa of Calcutta and St. Therese of Lisieux: Spiritual Sisters in the Night of Faith|publisher=Thereseoflisieux.org|date=4 September 2007|accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but because one nun in the convent had already chosen that name, Agnes opted for the Spanish spelling ''Teresa''.&lt;ref&gt;Meg Greene, Mother Teresa: A Biography, Greenwood Press, 2004, page 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

She took her solemn vows on 14 May 1937, while serving as a teacher at the Loreto convent school in Entally, eastern Calcutta.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vatican.va&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20031019_madre-teresa_en.html|title=Mother Teresa of Calcutta (1910–1997)|publisher=Vatican.va|date=October 19, 2003|accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;spink&quot;&gt;Spink, Kathryn (1997).

''Mother Teresa''. New York. Chelsea House Publications, p. 32. [[Special:Booksources/1-55546-855-1|ISBN 1-55546-855-1]].&lt;/ref&gt; Teresa served there for almost twenty years and in 1944 was appointed headmistress.&lt;ref&gt;Meg Greene, Mother Teresa: A Biography, Greenwood Press, 2004, page 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Teresa enjoyed teaching at the school, she was increasingly disturbed by the poverty surrounding her in [[Calcutta]] ([[Kolkata]]).&lt;ref&gt;Spink, Kathryn (1997). ''Mother Teresa: A Complete Authorized Biography''. New York. HarperCollins, pp.18–21. [[Special:Booksources/0062508253|ISBN 0-06-250825-3]].&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Bengal famine of 1943]] brought misery and death to the city; and the outbreak of [[Direct Action Day|Hindu/Muslim violence in August 1946]] plunged the city into despair and horror.&lt;ref&gt;Spink, Kathryn (1997). ''Mother Teresa: A Complete Authorized Biography''. New York. HarperCollins, pp.18, 21–22. [[Special:Booksources/0062508253|ISBN 0-06-250825-3]].&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 September 1946, Teresa experienced what she later described as &quot;the call within the call&quot; while traveling by train to the [[Loreto Convent, Darjeeling|Loreto convent]] in [[Darjeeling]] from [[Calcutta]] for her annual retreat. &quot;I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them. It was an order. To fail would have been to break the faith.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Clucas, Joan Graff. (1988). ''Mother Teresa''. New York. Chelsea House Publications, p. 35. [[Special:Booksources/1-55546-855-1|ISBN 1-55546-855-1]].&lt;/ref&gt; As one author later noted, &quot;Though no one knew it at the time, Sister Teresa had just become ''Mother'' Teresa&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Langford2008&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Langford|first=Joseph|title=Mother Teresa's Secret Fire: The Encounter That Changed Her Life, and How It Can Transform Your Own|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=20jT6DZziQsC&amp;pg=PA44|accessdate=9 September 2011|date=2008-10|publisher=Our Sunday Visitor Publishing|isbn=978-1-59276-309-2|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She began her missionary work with the poor in 1948, replacing her traditional Loreto habit with a simple white cotton ''sari'' decorated with a blue border. Mother Teresa adopted Indian citizenship, spent a few months in [[Patna]] to receive a basic medical training in the ''Holy Family Hospital'' and then ventured out into the slums.&lt;ref&gt;Clucas, Joan Graff. (1988). ''Mother Teresa''. New York. Chelsea House Publications, p. 39. [[Special:Booksources/1-55546-855-1|ISBN 1-55546-855-1]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Blessed Mother Teresa|work=Encyclopædia Britannica Online|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9071751|accessdate=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially she started a school in Motijhil (Calcutta); soon she started tending to the needs of the destitute and starving.&lt;ref&gt;Clucas, Joan Graff. (1988). ''Mother Teresa''. New York. Chelsea House Publications, pp. 48–49. [[Special:Booksources/1-55546-855-1|ISBN 1-55546-855-1]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning of 1949 she was joined in her effort by a group of young women and laid the foundations to create a new religious community helping the ''&quot;poorest among the poor&quot;''.

Her efforts quickly caught the attention of Indian officials, including the prime minister, who expressed his appreciation.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2002). ''Mother Teresa''. Indianapolis. Alpha Books, p. 57. [[Special:Booksources/0028642783|ISBN 0-02-864278-3]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Teresa wrote in her diary that her first year was fraught with difficulties. She had no income and had to resort to begging for food and supplies. Teresa experienced doubt, loneliness and the temptation to return to the comfort of convent life during these early months. She wrote in her diary:

{{quote|Our Lord wants me to be a free nun covered with the poverty of the cross. Today I learned a good lesson. The poverty of the poor must be so hard for them. While looking for a home I walked and walked till my arms and legs ached. I thought how much they must ache in body and soul, looking for a home, food and health. Then the comfort of Loreto [her former order] came to tempt me. 'You have only to say the word and all that will be yours again,' the Tempter kept on saying ... Of free choice, my God, and out of love for you, I desire to remain and do whatever be your Holy will in my regard. I did not let a single tear come.&lt;ref&gt;Spink, Kathryn (1997). ''Mother Teresa: A Complete Authorized Biography''. New York. HarperCollins, p.37. [[Special:Booksources/0062508253|ISBN 0-06-250825-3]].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Teresa received [[Holy See|Vatican]] permission on 7 October 1950 to start the diocesan congregation that would become the Missionaries of Charity.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Paul (2002). ''Mother Teresa''. Indianapolis. Alpha Books, p. 62. [[Special:Booksources/0028642783|ISBN 0-02-864278-3]].&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission was to care for, in her own words, &quot;the hungry, the naked, the homeless, the crippled, the blind, the lepers, all those people who feel unwanted, unloved, uncared for throughout society, people that have become a burden to the society and are shunned by everyone.&quot;

It began as a small order with 13 members in Calcutta; by 1997 it had grown to more than 4,000 sisters running orphanages, AIDS hospices and charity centers worldwide, and caring for refugees, the blind, disabled, aged, alcoholics, the poor and homeless, and victims of floods, epidemics, and famine.&lt;ref&gt;Spink, Kathryn (1997). ''Mother Teresa: A Complete Authorized Biography''. New York. HarperCollins, p.284. [[Special:Booksources/0062508253|ISBN 0-06-250825-3]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952 Mother Teresa opened the first Home for the Dying in space made available by the city of Calcutta ([[Kolkata]]). With the help of Indian officials she converted an abandoned [[Hinduism|Hindu]] temple into the [[Kalighat Home for the Dying]], a free hospice for the poor. She renamed it Kalighat, the Home of the Pure Heart (Nirmal Hriday).&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, Anne (1997).''Mother Teresa: Beyond the Image''. New York. Doubleday, pp. 58–60. [[Special:Booksources/0385489528|ISBN 0-385-48952-8]].&lt;/ref&gt; Those brought to the home received medical attention and were afforded the opportunity to die with dignity, according to the rituals of their faith; Muslims were read the Quran, Hindus received water from the Ganges, and Catholics received the Last Rites.&lt;ref name=Spink55&gt;Spink, Kathryn (1997). ''Mother Teresa: A Complete Authorized Biography''. New York. HarperCollins, p.55. [[Special:Booksources/0062508253|ISBN 0-06-250825-3]].&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;A beautiful death,&quot; she said, &quot;is for people who lived like animals to die like angels—loved and wanted.&quot;&lt;ref name=Spink55 /&gt;

Mother Teresa soon opened a home for those suffering from [[Hansen's disease]], commonly known as leprosy, and called the hospice Shanti Nagar (City of Peace).&lt;ref&gt;Sebba, Anne (1997).''Mother Teresa: Beyond the Image''. New York. Doubleday, pp. 62–63. [[Special:Booksources/0385489528|ISBN 0-385-48952-8]].&lt;/ref&gt; The Missionaries of Charity also established several leprosy outreach clinics throughout Calcutta, providing medication, bandages and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianideology.com/ideals_of_health-care.html|title=Mother Theresa|work=www.indianideology.com|accessdate=11 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Missionaries of Charity took in increasing numbers of lost children, Mother Teresa felt the need to create a home for them. In 1955 she opened the Nirmala Shishu Bhavan, the Children's Home of the Immaculate Heart, as a haven for orphans and homeless youth.&lt;ref&gt;Clucas, Joan Graff. (1988). ''Mother Teresa''. New York. Chelsea House Publications, pp. 58–59. [[Special:Booksources/1-55546-855-1|ISBN 1-55546-855-1]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The order soon began to attract both recruits and charitable donations, and by the 1960s had opened hospices, orphanages and leper houses all over India. Mother Teresa then expanded the order throughout the globe. Its first house outside India opened in Venezuela in 1965 with five sisters.&lt;ref&gt;Spink, Kathryn (1997). ''Mother Teresa: A Complete Authorized Biography''. New York. HarperCollins, p.82. [[Special:Booksources/0062508253|ISBN 0-06-250825-3]].&lt;/ref&gt; Others followed in Rome, Tanzania, and Austria in 1968; during the 1970s the order opened houses and foundations in dozens of countries in Asia, Africa, Europe and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Spink, Kathryn (1997). ''Mother Teresa: A Complete Authorized Biography''. New York. HarperCollins, pp.286–287. [[Special:Booksources/0062508253|ISBN 0-06-250825-3]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Missionaries of Charity Brothers was founded in 1963, and a contemplative branch of the Sisters followed in 1976. Lay Catholics and non-Catholics were enrolled in the Co-Workers of Mother Teresa, the Sick and Suffering Co-Workers, and the Lay Missionaries of Charity. In answer to the requests of many priests, in 1981 Mother Teresa also began the Corpus Christi Movement for Priests,&lt;ref&gt;[http://corpuschristimovement.com/ God's People Yearn For Holy Priests, Founded by Blessed Mother Teresa of Calcutta.

==Declining health and death==
Mother Teresa suffered a [[heart attack]] in Rome in 1983, while visiting [[Pope John Paul II]]. After a second attack in 1989, she received an [[artificial pacemaker]]. In 1991, after a battle with [[pneumonia]] while in Mexico, she suffered further heart problems. She offered to resign her position as head of the Missionaries of Charity, but the sisters of the order, in a [[secret ballot]], voted for her to stay.

She had [[Cardiac surgery|heart surgery]] but it was clear that her health was declining.

==Recognition and reception==
===In India===
Mother Teresa had first been recognised by the Indian government more than a third of a century earlier when she was awarded the [[Padma Shri]] in 1962 and the [[Jawaharlal Nehru Award for International Understanding]] in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iccrindia.net/jnawardlist.html|title=List of the recipients of the Jawaharlal Nehru Award|publisher=[[ICCR]] website}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued to receive major Indian awards in subsequent years, including India's highest civilian award, the [[Bharat Ratna]], in both 1972 and 1980.&lt;ref name=Frontline /&gt; Her official biography was authored by an Indian civil servant, [[Navin Chawla]], and published in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Mother Teresa: The Authorized Biography&quot; ISBN 978-0-7567-5548-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 August 2010, to commemorate the 100th anniversary of her birth, the government of India issued a special 5 Rupee coin, being the sum she first arrived in India with. President [[Pratibha Patil]] said of Mother Teresa, &quot;Clad in a white sari with a blue border, she and the sisters of Missionaries of Charity became a symbol of hope to many – the aged, the destitute, the unemployed, the diseased, the terminally ill, and those abandoned by their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commemorative coin on Mother Teresa released|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-08-28/india/28290014_1_agnes-gonxha-bojaxhiu-mother-teresa-coin|work=[[Timesofindia]]|date=28 August 2010|accessdate=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indian views on Mother Teresa were not uniformly favourable. Her critic [[Aroup Chatterjee]], who was born and raised in Calcutta but lived in London, reports that &quot;she was not a significant entity in Calcutta in her lifetime&quot;. Chatterjee blames Mother Teresa for promoting a negative image of Calcutta, exaggerating the work done by her Mission, and misusing the funds and privileges at her disposal.&lt;ref name=Chatterjee /&gt; Her presence and profile grated in parts of the Indian political world, as she often opposed the [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu Right]]. The [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] clashed with her over the Christian [[Dalit]]s, but praised her in death, sending a representative to her funeral. The [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]], on the other hand, opposed the government's decision to grant her a state funeral. Its secretary [[Giriraj Kishore]] said that &quot;her first duty was to the Church and social service was incidental&quot; and accused her of favouring Christians and conducting &quot;secret baptisms&quot; of the dying.&lt;ref name=&quot;ianpaisley1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ianpaisley.org/article.asp?ArtKey=puppet|title=EIPS – Hell's Puppet Beatified: The Unseen Hands Behind Mother Teresa Of Calcutta|publisher=Ianpaisley.org|date=October 20, 2003|accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;usislam1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usislam.org/revise/6211Baptism.htm|title=Secret Baptism|publisher=Usislam.org|accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But, in its front page tribute, the Indian fortnightly ''[[Frontline (magazine)|Frontline]]''  dismissed these charges as &quot;patently false&quot; and said that they had &quot;made no impact on the public perception of her work, especially in Calcutta&quot;. Although praising her &quot;selfless caring&quot;, energy and bravery, the author of the tribute was critical of Mother Teresa's public campaigning against abortion and that she claimed to be non-political when doing so.&lt;ref name=Frontline&gt;Parvathi Menon  [http://www.hinduonnet.com/fline/fl1419/14190130.htm Cover story: ''A life of selfless caring'']{{dead link|date=October 2011}}, ''Frontline'', Vol.14 :: No. 19 :: 20 September–3 October 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Mother Teresa received the Philippines-based [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] for International Understanding, given for work in South or East Asia. The citation said that &quot;the Board of Trustees recognizes her merciful cognizance of the abject poor of a foreign land, in whose service she has led a new congregation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation (1962) ''[http://www.rmaf.org.ph/Awardees/Citation/CitationMotherTer.htm Citation for Mother Teresa]''.&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1970s, Mother Teresa had become an international celebrity. Her fame can be in large part attributed to the 1969 [[documentary film|documentary]] ''Something Beautiful for God'', which was filmed by [[Malcolm Muggeridge]] and his 1971 book of the same title. Muggeridge was undergoing a spiritual journey of his own at the time.&lt;ref name=Timecrisis /&gt; During the filming of the documentary, footage taken in poor lighting conditions, particularly the Home for the Dying, was thought unlikely to be of usable quality by the crew. After returning from India, however, the footage was found to be extremely well lit.

''Mother Teresa: Saint or Celebrity?''. Routledge Press, pp. 9. [[Special:Booksources/0415392462|ISBN 0-415-39246-2]].&lt;/ref&gt; Muggeridge later converted to Catholicism.

Around this time, the Catholic world began to honor Mother Teresa publicly. In 1971, [[Paul VI]] awarded her the first [[Pope John XXIII]] Peace Prize, commending her for her work with the poor, display of Christian charity and efforts for peace.&lt;ref&gt;Clucas, Joan Graff.

===Criticism===
{{Main|Criticism of Mother Teresa}}

Towards the end of her life, Mother Teresa attracted some negative attention in the Western media. The journalist [[Christopher Hitchens#Critiques of specific individuals|Christopher Hitchens]] was one of her most active critics. He was commissioned to co-write and narrate the documentary ''Hell's Angel'' about her for the British [[Channel 4]] after [[Aroup Chatterjee]] encouraged the making of such a programme, although Chatterjee was unhappy with the &quot;sensationalist approach&quot; of the final product.&lt;ref name=Chatterjee&gt;Chatterjee, Aroup, [http://www.meteorbooks.com/introduction.html Introduction to ''The Final Verdict'']&lt;/ref&gt; Hitchens expanded his criticism in a 1995 book, ''[[The Missionary Position]]''.&lt;ref name=MacIntyre&gt;{{Cite news|last=MacIntyre|first=Donal|date=22 August 2005|title=The Squalid Truth Behind the Legacy of Mother Teresa|periodical=New Statesman|volume=134|issue=4754|pages=24–25|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200508220019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chatterjee writes that while she was alive Mother Teresa and her official biographers refused to collaborate with his own investigations and that she failed to defend herself against critical coverage in the Western press. He gives as examples a report in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in Britain whose &quot;stringent (and quite detailed) attack on conditions in her orphanages ... [include] charges of gross neglect and physical and emotional abuse&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sins of the Missions.|publisher=The Guardian|date=14 October 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another  documentary ''Mother Teresa: Time for Change?'' broadcast in several European countries.&lt;ref name=Chatterjee /&gt;

The German magazine ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' published a critical article on the first anniversary of Mother Teresa's death. This concerned allegations regarding financial matters and the spending of donations. The medical press has also published criticism of her, arising from very different outlooks and priorities on patients' needs.&lt;ref name=BMJ /&gt; Other critics include [[Tariq Ali]] of the ''[[New Left Review]]'' and the Irish investigative journalist [[Donal MacIntyre]].&lt;ref name=MacIntyre /&gt;

She has also been criticized for her view on suffering. She felt that suffering would bring people closer to Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Byfield|first=Ted|title=If the real world knew the real Mother Teresa there would be a lot less adulation|periodical=Alberta Report/Newsmagazine|date=20 October 1997|volume=24|issue=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sanal Edamaruku]], President of Rationalist International, criticised the failure to give painkillers, writing that in her Homes for the Dying, one could &quot;hear the screams of people having maggots tweezered from their open wounds without pain relief. On principle, strong painkillers were not administered even in severe cases. According to Mother Teresa's philosophy, it is 'the most beautiful gift for a person that he can participate in the sufferings of Christ'.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mukto-mona.com/Articles/mother_teresa/sanal_ed.htm|title=&quot;India has no reason to be grateful to Mother Teresa&quot;, Sanal Edamaruku|publisher=Mukto-mona.com|accessdate=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quality of care offered to terminally ill patients in the Homes for the Dying has been criticised in the medical press.  ''[[The Lancet]]'' and the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' reported the reuse of hypodermic needles, poor living conditions, including the use of cold baths for all patients, and an approach to illness and suffering that precluded the use of many elements of modern medical care, such as systematic diagnosis.&lt;ref name=BMJ&gt;Loudon, Mary. (1996)[http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/312/7022/64/a The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice], Book Review, ''BMJ'' vol.312, no.7022, 6 January 2006, pp.64–5. Retrieved 2 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Robin Fox, editor of ''[[The Lancet]]'', described the medical care as &quot;haphazard&quot;, as volunteers without medical knowledge had to make decisions about patient care, because of the lack of doctors. He observed that her order did not distinguish between curable and incurable patients, so that people who could otherwise survive would be at risk of dying from infections and lack of treatment.  Dr. Fox makes it a point to contrast the term &quot;[[hospice]]&quot;, on the one hand, with what he calls &quot;Mother Teresa's Care for the Dying&quot; on the other hand; noting that, while hospice emphasizes minimizing suffering with professional medical care and attention to expressed needs and wishes of the patient, her approach does not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fox|first=Robin|title=Mother Theresa's care for the dying|journal=The Lancet|volume=344|page=807|year=1994|issue=8925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colette Livermore, a former Missionary of Charity, describes her reasons for leaving the order in her book ''Hope Endures: Leaving Mother Teresa, Losing Faith, and Searching for Meaning''. Livermore found what she called Mother Teresa's &quot;theology of suffering&quot; to be flawed, despite being a good and courageous person. Though Mother Teresa instructed her followers on the importance of spreading the Gospel through actions rather than theological lessons, Livermore could not reconcile this with some of the practices of the organization. Examples she gives include unnecessarily refusing to help the needy when they approached the sisters at the wrong time according to the prescribed schedule, discouraging sisters from seeking medical training to deal with the illnesses they encountered (with the justification that God empowers the weak and ignorant), and imposition of &quot;unjust&quot; punishments, such as being transferred away from friends. Livermore says that the Missionaries of Charity &quot;infantilized&quot; its sisters by prohibiting the reading of secular books and newspapers, and emphasizing obedience over independent thinking and problem-solving.&lt;ref&gt;[http://podcastdownload.npr.org/anon.npr-podcasts/podcast/77/510036/98314432/KERA_98314432.mp3 KERA's Think Podcast: Leaving Mother Teresa, Losing Faith, and Searching for Meaning]. 15 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitchens and ''Stern'' have said Mother Teresa did not focus donated money on alleviating poverty or improving the conditions of her hospices, but on opening new convents and increasing missionary work.&lt;ref&gt;Hitchens, Christopher (20 October 2003). &quot;[http://www.slate.com/id/2090083 Mommie Dearest]&quot;. ''Slate Magazine''. Retrieved 30 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Mother Teresa accepted donations from the autocratic and corrupt [[Duvalier|Duvalier family]] in Haiti and openly praised them.

==Spiritual life==
Analyzing her deeds and achievements, [[John Paul II]] asked: &quot;Where did Mother Teresa find the strength and perseverance to place herself completely at the service of others? She found it in prayer and in the silent contemplation of Jesus Christ, his Holy Face, his Sacred Heart.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/2003/october/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_20031020_pilgrims-mother-teresa_en.html|title=Address Of John Paul II To The Pilgrims Who Had Come To Rome For The Beatification Of Mother Teresa|work=Vatican.va|date=20 October 2003|author=John Paul II|accessdate=13 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Privately, Mother Teresa experienced doubts and struggles over her religious beliefs which lasted nearly 50 years until the end of her life, during which &quot;she felt no presence of God whatsoever&quot;, &quot;neither in her heart or in the eucharist&quot; as put by her [[postulator]] Rev.

When I try to raise my thoughts to Heaven, there is such convicting emptiness that those very thoughts return like sharp knives and hurt my very soul ...

With reference to the above words, the Rev. Brian Kolodiejchuk, her [[postulator]] (the official responsible for gathering the evidence for her sanctification) indicated there was a risk that some might misinterpret her meaning, but her faith that God was working through her remained undiminished, and that while she pined for the lost sentiment of closeness with God, she did not question his existence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.beliefnet.com/story/223/story_22353_1.html New Book Reveals Mother Teresa's Struggle with Faith] Beliefnet, AP 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and that she may have experienced something similar to what is believed of [[Jesus Christ]] when crucified who was heard to say &quot;Eli Eli lama sabachthani?&quot; which is translated to &quot;My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?&quot;   Many other saints had similar experiences of [[spiritual dryness]], or what Catholics believe to be spiritual tests (&quot;passive purifications&quot;), such as Mother Teresa's namesake, St. Therese of Lisieux, who called it a &quot;night of nothingness.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  Contrary to the mistaken belief by some that the doubts she expressed would be an impediment to canonization, just the opposite is true; it is very consistent with the experience of canonized mystics.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Mother Teresa described, after ten years of doubt, a short period of renewed faith. At the time of the death of Pope Pius XII in the fall of 1958, praying for him at a requiem mass, she said she had been relieved of &quot;the long darkness: that strange suffering.&quot; However, five weeks later, she described returning to her difficulties in believing.&lt;ref name=Newsweekteresa /&gt;

Mother Teresa wrote many letters to her confessors and superiors over a 66-year period. She had asked that her letters be destroyed, concerned that &quot;people will think more of me—less of Jesus.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Timecrisis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/524638,CST-NWS-mother24.article|title=Mother Teresa's Crisis of Faith|accessdate=26 August 2007|work=Sun Times|deadurl=yes}}{{Dead link|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his first encyclical ''[[Deus Caritas Est]]'', [[Benedict XVI]] mentioned Teresa of Calcutta three times and he also used her life to clarify one of his main points of the encyclical. &quot;In the example of Blessed Teresa of Calcutta we have a clear illustration of the fact that time devoted to God in prayer not only does not detract from effective and loving service to our neighbour but is in fact the inexhaustible source of that service.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pope Benedict XVI]] (25 December 2005).

Although there was no direct connection between Mother Teresa's order and the Franciscan orders, she was known as a great admirer of [[St. Francis of Assisi]].&lt;ref name=AmeriCath&gt;&quot;Mother Teresa of Calcutta Pays Tribute to St. Francis of Assisi&quot; on the [http://www.americancatholic.org/Features/Teresa/Teresa_Assisi.asp ''American Catholic'' website].

After Mother Teresa's death in 1997, the [[Holy See]] began the process of [[beatification]], the third step toward possible [[canonization]]. This process requires the documentation of a [[miracle]] performed from the [[intercession]] of Mother Teresa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mother Teresa: The Road to Official Sainthood|url=http://www.americancatholic.org/features/teresa/sainthood.asp|work=www.americancatholic.org|accessdate=13 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Vatican recognized as a miracle the healing of a tumor in the abdomen of an Indian woman, Monica Besra, after the application of a locket containing Mother Teresa's picture. Besra said that a beam of light emanated from the picture, curing the cancerous tumor. Critics—including some of Besra's medical staff and, initially, Besra's husband—insisted that conventional medical treatment had eradicated the tumor.&lt;ref&gt;Orr, David (10 May. 2003).

''The Telegraph''. Retrieved 30 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Ranjan Mustafi, who told ''The New York Times'' he had treated Besra, said that the cyst was not cancer at all but a cyst caused by tuberculosis. He insisted, &quot;It was not a miracle....

An opposing perspective of the claim is that Besra's medical records contain sonograms, prescriptions, and physicians' notes that could prove whether the cure was a miracle or not. Besra has claimed that Sister Betta of the [[Missionaries of Charity]] is holding them. The publication has received a &quot;no comments&quot; statement from Sister Betta. The officials at the Balurghat Hospital where Besra was seeking medical treatment have claimed that they are being pressured by the Catholic order to declare the cure a miracle.&lt;ref name=time/&gt;&lt;!-- very unlikely that a vatican investigation would call a single witness to decide on a matter of such importance.

She said, ‘I'm not a social worker. I don't do it for this reason. I do it for Christ. I do it for the church.’”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/10/19/60minutes/main578794.shtml?tag=mncol;lst;1 The Debate Over Sainthood]. (11 February 2009). ''CBS News''.

In the process of examining Teresa's suitability for [[beatification]] and [[canonization]], the [[Roman Curia]] (the Vatican) pored &lt;!-- pore: read or study carefully! --&gt; over a great deal of documentation of published and unpublished criticism of her life and work. Vatican officials say Hitchens's allegations have been investigated by the agency charged with such matters, the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]], and they found no obstacle to Mother Teresa's beatification.
