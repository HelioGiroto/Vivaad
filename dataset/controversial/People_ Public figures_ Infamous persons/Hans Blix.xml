'''Hans Martin Blix''' ({{Audio|sv-Hans_Blix.ogg|listen}}; born 28 June 1928) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[diplomat]] and [[politician]] for the Liberal People's Party. He was [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Sweden)|Swedish Minister for Foreign Affairs]] (1978–1979). Blix was also the head of the [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission]] from March 2000 to June 2003, when he was succeeded by [[Dimitris Perrikos]]. In 2002, the commission began searching [[Iraq]] for [[weapons of mass destruction]], ultimately finding none. In February 2010, the Government of the United Arab Emirates announced that Blix will be the head of an advisory board for its nuclear power program.

==Early life and career==
Blix was born in [[Uppsala]], [[Sweden]]. He is the son of professor Gunnar Blix and Hertha Wiberg and grandson of professor [[Magnus Blix]]. He comes from a family of [[Jämtland|Jamtlandic]] origin. Blix studied at [[Uppsala University]] and [[Columbia University]], earning his Ph.D. from the [[University of Cambridge]] ([[Trinity Hall, Cambridge|Trinity Hall]]).&lt;ref&gt;2002 Friedmann Award Given to Dr. Hans Blix  http://www.law.columbia.edu/media_inquiries/news_events/2002/friedmann_2002 Retrieved 21 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, he became a [[Juris Doctor]] in [[International Law]] at the [[Stockholm University]], where he was appointed Associate Professor in International Law the next year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wmdcommission.org/sida.asp?ID=33 Retrieved 21 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1962 and 1978 Blix was a member of the Swedish delegation at the Disarmament Conference in Geneva. He held several other positions in the Swedish administration between 1963 and 1976, and from 1961 to 1981 served on the Swedish delegation to the United Nations. From 1978 to 1979, Blix was the Swedish Foreign Minister.

Blix chaired the Swedish [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal Party]]'s campaign during the 1980 [[Referendums in Sweden|referendum]] on [[nuclear power]], campaigning in favor of retention of the Swedish nuclear energy program.

==Head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (1981-1997)==
Blix became Director General of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] between 1981 and 1997  after [[Sigvard Eklund]].

Blix personally made repeated inspection visits to the Iraqi nuclear reactor ''[[Osiraq]]'' before its attempted destruction by the [[Iran]]ians, in 1980, and its eventual destruction by the [[Israeli Air Force]] in 1981 during [[Operation Opera]]. Although most agreed that Iraq was years away from being able to build a [[nuclear weapon]], the Iranians and the Israelis felt any raid must occur well before nuclear fuel was loaded to prevent [[nuclear fallout]]. The attack was regarded as being in breach of the [[United Nations Charter]] (S/RES/487) and international law and was widely condemned.
Iraq was alternately praised and admonished by the IAEA for its cooperation and lack thereof. It was only after the first [[Gulf War]] that the full extent of Iraq's nuclear programs, which had switched from a [[plutonium]] based weapon design to a highly [[enriched uranium]] design after the destruction of Osiraq, became known.

Another significant event during his time as head of the IAEA was the [[Chernobyl disaster]] on 26 April 1986, a [[nuclear accident]] rated at the highest level 7 on the IAEA's [[International Nuclear Event Scale]].

==Iraq disarmament 'crisis' (2002-2003)==
During the [[Iraq disarmament crisis]] before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Blix was called back from retirement by UN Secretary General [[Kofi Annan]] to lead [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission]] in charge of monitoring Iraq.  Kofi Annan originally recommended [[Rolf Ekéus]], who worked with UNSCOM in the past, but both [[Russia]] and [[France]] vetoed his appointment. &lt;!--&quot;Called back from retirement&quot; is mentioned in &quot;Disarming Iraq&quot;; should check for more details. Much has to be written about the work done in Iraq. &quot;Disarming Iraq&quot; is a good reference --&gt;

Hans Blix personally admonished Saddam for &quot;cat and mouse&quot; games&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/1413384/Dont-mess-with-us-UN-warns-Saddam.html |title=Don't mess with us, UN warns Saddam |first=Marcus |last=Warren |date=2002-11-16 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher= |accessdate=2012-05-09 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and warned Iraq of &quot;serious consequences&quot; if it attempted to hinder or delay his mission. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/2485209.stm | work=BBC News | title=Blix warns Iraq over inspections | date=17 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his report to the [[UN Security Council]] on 14 February 2003, Blix claimed that &quot;If Iraq had provided the necessary cooperation in 1991, the phase of disarmament -- under resolution 687 -- could have been short and a decade of sanctions could have been avoided.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,,895882,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Full text: Hans Blix's briefing to the UN security council | date=14 February 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blix's statements about the [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraq WMD program]] came to contradict the claims of the [[George W. Bush administration]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/cia/reports/iraq_wmd/Iraq_Oct_2002.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted a great deal of criticism from supporters of the invasion of Iraq. In an interview on [[BBC 1|BBC TV]] on 8 February 2004, Dr. Blix accused the US and [[United Kingdom|British]] [[government]]s of dramatising the threat of [[weapons of mass destruction]] in [[Iraq]], in order to strengthen the case for the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 war]] against the regime of [[Saddam Hussein]]. Ultimately, no stockpiles of [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] were ever found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-03-26-chemical-suits_x.htm | work=USA Today | title=U.S. finds 3,000 chemical suits in Iraq | date=26 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with London's ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' newspaper, Hans Blix said, &quot;I have my detractors in Washington. There are bastards who spread things around, of course, who planted nasty things in the media&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/US/06/12/blix.interview.cnna/ | work=CNN | title=Blix takes Washington to task | date=12 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Blix published a book, ''Disarming Iraq'', where he gives his account of the events and inspections before the coalition began its invasion.

Blix said he suspected his home and office were bugged by the United States, while he led teams searching for Saddam Hussein's supposed weapons of mass destruction.&lt;ref name='bug'&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title=Blix suspected U.S. spied on him | date= | publisher= | url =http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/02/28/un.britain/index.html | work =[[cnn]] | pages = | accessdate = 2007-09-20 | language = |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080407085915/http://www.cnn.com/2004/US/02/28/un.britain/index.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although these suspicions were never directly substantiated, evidence of bugging of UN security council representatives around the time the US was seeking approval from the council came to light after a British government translator leaked a document &quot;allegedly from an American National Security Agency&quot; requesting that British intelligence put wiretaps on delegates to the UN security council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first= | last= | coauthors= | title= Iraq war 'spy memo case' collapses | date= 25 February 2004| publisher= | url =http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/europe/02/25/uk.gchq/index.html | work =[[cnn]] | pages = | accessdate = 2008-04-21 | language = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission==
{{Expand section|date=July 2007}}
Since 2003 Blix has been chairman of the [[Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission]] (WMDC), an independent body funded by the Swedish government and based in Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wmdcommission.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006, the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission said in a report that [[Pakistan]]’s infamous and controversial nuclear proliferator [[Abdul Qadeer Khan]] could not have acted alone or ''“without the awareness of the [[Pakistani government]]”''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deccanherald.com/deccanherald/dec82006/foreign2156302006127.asp  &quot;A Q Khan did not act alone&quot; says Hans Blix team]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humanitarian initiatives==
In 2009 joined the project &quot;Soldiers of Peace&quot;, a movie against all wars and for a global peace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soldiersofpeacemovie.com/about/the-cast/16/dr-hans-blix/ |title=Hans Blix&amp;nbsp;— The Cast&amp;nbsp;— Soldiers of Peace |publisher=Soldiersofpeacemovie.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soldatidipace.blogspot.com/ |title=Soldati di Pace (Soldiers of Peace) |publisher=Soldatidipace.blogspot.com |date=2009-10-18 |accessdate=2009-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Head of Advisory Board for United Arab Emirates Nuclear Program ==
Blix will chair a panel of advisors who will oversee the establishment of the UAE’s Dh150 billion atomic energy programme. He will lead the nine-person board, which will meet twice a year. The International Advisory Board (IAB) will oversee progress of the nation’s nuclear energy plan and issue reports on potential improvements to the scheme. The IAB is expected to hold its first meeting later this month{{when|date=December 2010}} and will include other distinguished nuclear experts, such as Lady Barbara Judge, the chairman of the UK Atomic Energy Authority.
