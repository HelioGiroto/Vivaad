'''Norman Milton Lear''' (born July 27, 1922) is an American [[television]] writer and [[Television producer|producer]] who produced such 1970s [[sitcoms]] as ''[[All in the Family]]'', ''[[Sanford and Son]]'', ''[[One Day at a Time]]'', ''[[The Jeffersons]]'', ''[[Good Times]]'' and ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]''. As a political activist, he founded the advocacy organization [[People For the American Way]] in 1981 and has supported [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights and progressive causes.

==Early life==
Lear was born in [[New Haven, Connecticut]], the son of Jeanette (née Seicol) and Herman Lear, who worked in sales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/8/Norman-Lear.html]&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in a [[Jewish]] home and had a [[Bar Mitzvah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aish.com/ci/be/48880147.html Interview with Aish.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Lear went to high school in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] and subsequently attended [[Emerson College]] in [[Boston]], but dropped out in 1942 to join the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. During [[World War II]], he served in the Mediterranean Theater as a radio operator/gunner on [[Boeing]] [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] bombers with the 772nd Bombardment Squadron, 463rd Bombardment Group (Heavy) of the [[Fifteenth Air Force]]. He flew 52 combat missions, for which he was awarded the [[Air Medal]] with four Oak Leaf Clusters.  Lear was discharged from the Army in 1945.  He and his fellow World War II crew members are featured in the book &quot;Crew Umbriago&quot; by Daniel P.Carroll (tail gunner), and also in another book: ''772nd Bomb Squadron: The Men, The Memories'' by Turner Publishing Company.

==Career==
In 1954, Lear was enlisted as a writer hoping to salvage the new [[Celeste Holm]] [[CBS]] [[sitcom]], ''[[Honestly, Celeste!]]'', but the program was canceled after eight episodes. During this time, he became the producer of [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Martha Raye Show]]'', after [[Nat Hiken]] left as the series director. In 1959, Lear created his first television series starring [[Henry Fonda]], a half-hour western for [[Universal Media Studios|Revue Studios]] called ''[[The Deputy (TV series)|The Deputy]]''.

===1970s===
Starting out as a comedy writer, then a [[film]] director (he wrote and produced the 1967 film ''[[Divorce American Style]]'' and directed the 1971 film ''[[Cold Turkey (film)|Cold Turkey]]'', both starring [[Dick Van Dyke]]), Lear tried to sell a concept for a sitcom about a [[blue collar|blue-collar]] American family to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. They rejected the show after two pilots were filmed. After a third pilot was shot, CBS picked up the show, known as ''[[All in the Family]]''. It premiered January 12, 1971 to disappointing ratings, but it took home several [[Emmy Awards]] that year, including Outstanding Comedy Series. The show did very well in summer reruns, and it flourished in the 1971-1972 season, becoming the top-rated show on TV for the next five years. After falling from the #1 spot, ''All in the Family'' still remained in the top ten, well after it transitioned into ''[[Archie Bunker's Place]]''. The show was based on the [[Great Britain|British]] sitcom ''[[Til Death Us Do Part]]'', about an irascible working-class [[Tory]] and his [[Socialist]] son-in-law.

Lear's second big TV hit was also based on a British sitcom, ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'', about a west [[London]] junk dealer and his son.  Lear changed the setting to the [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]] section of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and the characters to [[African-Americans]], and the [[NBC]] show ''[[Sanford and Son]]'' was an instant hit. Numerous hit shows followed thereafter, including ''[[Maude (TV series)|Maude]]'' (the lead character of which was reportedly based on Lear's then-wife [[Frances Lear|Frances]]), ''[[The Jeffersons]]'' (both [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]]s of ''All in the Family''), ''[[One Day at a Time]]'' and [[Good Times]].

What most of the Lear sitcoms had in common was that they were character-driven, had sets that more resembled stage plays than common sitcom sets, were shot on [[videotape]] in place of [[film]], used a live studio audience, and most importantly dealt with the social and political issues of the day.  Ironically, although Lear's shows are often considered somewhat autobiographical and closely identified with his personal experiences, his early hits were actually all adapted from someone else's creations: the two aforementioned British adaptations and ''Maude'', while reputedly based on Lear's wife, was actually the brainchild of series producer [[Charlie Hauck]]. Bud Yorkin was also the major force behind ''All in the Family'', ''Sanford and Son'', ''The Jeffersons'', and countless others.

Lear's longtime producing partner was [[Bud Yorkin]], who created/produced ''All in the Family'', ''Sanford and Son'', ''[[What's Happening!!]]'', ''Maude'', and ''The Jeffersons'', split with Lear in 1975. He started a production company with writer/producers [[Saul Turteltaub]] and [[Bernie Orenstein]], but they had only two shows that ran more than a year: ''What's Happening!!'' and ''[[Carter Country]]''. The Lear/Yorkin company was known as ''Tandem Productions''. Lear and talent agent [[Jerry Perenchio]] founded T.A.T. Communications (T.A.T. stood for &quot;Tuchus Affen Tisch&quot;, which is Yiddish for &quot;Putting one's butt on the line&quot;) in 1974, which co-existed with Tandem Productions and was often referred to in periodicals as Tandem/T.A.T. The Lear organization was one of the most successful independent TV producers of the 1970s. TAT produced the influential and award-winning 1981 film ''[[The Wave (1981 film)|The Wave]]'' about [[Ron Jones (teacher)|Ron Jones]]' social experiment.

Lear also developed the cult favorite TV series ''[[Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman]]'' (''MH MH'') which was turned down by the networks as &quot;too controversial&quot; and placed it into first run syndication with 128 stations in January 1976. A year later, Lear added another program into first run syndication along with ''MH MH'', ''[[All That Glitters (TV series)|All That Glitters]]''.  He planned in 1977 to offer three hours of prime time Saturday programming directly, with the stations placing his production company in the position of an [[Fourth television network|occasional network]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nadel&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nadel|first=Gerry|date=1977-05-30|title=Who Owns Prime Time? The Threat of the 'Occasional' Networks|journal=New York Magazine|location=New York|pages=34–35|url=http://books.google.com/?id=YeMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;lpg=PA35&amp;dq=%22MetroNet%22%2B%22Metromedia%22&amp;q=%22MetroNet%22%2B%22Metromedia%22|accessdate=2009-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lear himself stepped down as production supervisor on his shows in 1978 to work on a film dealing with his concerns about the growing influence of radical right-wing evangelists. The film was never fully developed, but the process stimulated his long engagement in political activism.

===1980s===
In 1982, the company bought out [[Embassy Pictures|Avco Embassy Pictures]] from Avco Financial Corporation, and the Avco part of its name was dropped. Embassy Pictures was led by [[Alan Horn]] and Martin Schaeffer, later co-founders of [[Castle Rock Entertainment]] with [[Rob Reiner]]. In 1985, Lear sold all his film and television production holdings to [[Columbia Pictures]] (then owned by the [[Coca-Cola]] Company) which acquired Embassy's film and television division (which included Embassy's in-house television productions and the television rights to the Embassy theatrical library) for $485 million in shares of The Coca-Cola Company. Lear and his longtime partner Jerry Perenchio split the net proceeds (about $250&amp;nbsp;mm). Coke later sold the film division to Dino De Laurentiis and the home video arm to Nelson entertainment (led by Barry Spikings).

The brand Tandem Productions was abandoned in 1986 with the cancellation of ''[[Diff'rent Strokes]]'', and Embassy ceased to exist as a single entity in late 1987, having been split into different components owned by different entities.  The Embassy TV division became ELP Communications in 1988, but shows originally produced by Embassy were now under the [[Columbia Pictures Television]] banner from 1988–1994 and the [[Columbia TriStar Television]] banner from 1994-1998.

Lear is unofficially credited with giving [[Rob Reiner]], son of [[Carl Reiner]] (and a star of ''[[All in the Family]]'') his start as a director by financing the [[mockumentary]] ''[[This is Spinal Tap]]''.   Lear's Act III Communications, founded in 1986 with [[Tom McGrath (media executive)|Tom McGrath]] as President, produced several notable films, including Rob Reiner's next three films: ''[[The Sure Thing]]'', ''[[Stand By Me (film)|Stand By Me]]'',  and ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'', as well as ''[[Fried Green Tomatoes (film)|Fried Green Tomatoes]]''.

===1990s===
Lear attempted to return to TV production in the 1990s with the shows ''[[Sunday Dinner (TV series)|Sunday Dinner]]'', ''[[The Powers That Be (TV series)|The Powers That Be]]'', and ''[[704 Hauser]]'', the last one putting a different family in the house from ''[[All in the Family]]''.  None of the series proved successful, despite critical acclaim.

Today, Lear's TV library is owned by [[Sony Pictures Television]].

However, Lear was successful as a businessman, especially with his leveraged acquisition vehicle Act III Communications, founded in 1986 and led initially by [[Tom McGrath (media executive)|Tom McGrath]] (who met Lear while negotiating on behalf of Coca-Cola the acquisition of Lear's old company) and later by Hal Gaba, a former Embassy executive.  This included: Act III Theatres, sold to KKR in 1997 at what is to this day considered a record premium; Act III Broadcasting, sold to Abry Communications; and Act III Publishing, sold to PriMedia.  Lear is also the owner of Concord Records and in 2005 consummated a 50% interest in the film library and production assets of Village Roadshow Productions Pty Ltd.

In 1997, Lear teamed up with Jim George to produce the [[Kids' WB]] cartoon series, ''[[Channel Umptee-3]]''. It premiered on Kids WB's Saturday morning lineup on October 25, 1997. The cartoon made television history, as it was the first to meet the [[Federal Communications Commission]]'s then-new educational/informal programming requirements. Like Lear's other television works, it received positive reviews, but ratings were low due to the network's focus on their core high-rated programming at the time. A time switch from a concrete Saturday schedule to a revolving Friday timeslot caused the show's ratings to dip even more, and it was eventually canceled after one season. September 4, 1998 marked the last airing of ''Umptee-3'' on the WB.

===2000s===
In 2003, Lear made an appearance on ''[[South Park]]'' during the &quot;[[I'm a Little Bit Country]]&quot; episode, providing the voice of [[Benjamin Franklin]]. He also served as a consultant on the episodes &quot;I'm a Little Bit Country&quot; and &quot;[[Cancelled (South Park)|Cancelled]]&quot;. Lear has attended a South Park writers' retreat,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,432604,00.html &quot;Bigger, Longer &amp; Lear&quot; Entertainment Weekly]&lt;/ref&gt; and served as the officiant at [[Trey Parker|Trey Parker's]] wedding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2006/10/30/8391792/index.htm |title = How Trey Parker and Matt Stone made South Park a success |accessdate = 2010-01-23 |publisher = CNNMoney.com | date=2010-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In 1967, Lear was nominated for an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for writing ''Divorce, American Style''.  Lear was among the first seven television pioneers inducted into the [[Television Academy Hall of Fame]] in 1984. He received four [[Emmy Award]]s (two in 1971, and one each in 1972 and 1973) and a [[Peabody Award]] in 1978. He received the Humanist Arts Award from the [[American Humanist Association]] in 1977. His star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] is located at
6615 [[Hollywood Boulevard]].

In 1999, President [[Bill Clinton]] awarded the [[National Medal of Arts]] to Lear, noting that “Norman Lear has held up a mirror to American society and changed the way we look at it.” Also in 1999, he and [[Bud Yorkin]] received the [[Women in Film Los Angeles|Women in Film]] [[Women_in_Film_Crystal_+_Lucy_Awards#THE_LUCY_AWARD|Lucy Award]] in recognition of excellence and innovation in creative works that have enhanced the perception of women through the medium of television.&lt;ref&gt;http://wif.org/past-recipients&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political and cultural activities==
In addition to his success as a TV producer and businessman, Lear is an outspoken supporter of [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] and [[Liberalism|liberal]] causes. The only time that he did not support the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate for [[President of the United States|President]]  was in 1980:&lt;ref name=klo&gt;http://theoscarsite.com/whoswho5/lear_n.htm&lt;/ref&gt; he voted for [[John B. Anderson|John Anderson]] because he considered the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration to be &quot;a complete disaster&quot;.&lt;ref name=klo /&gt;

In 1981, Lear founded [[People For the American Way]]&lt;!-- NOTE: 'For' is capitalized in the official name of the organization. --&gt;, a civil liberties advocacy organization. People For ran several advertising campaigns opposing the interjection of religion in politics. In 1987, People For campaigned against [[Robert Bork]]'s nomination to the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. The organization is still active.

In 1989, Lear founded the [[Business Enterprise Trust]], an educational program that used annual awards, business school case studies, and videos to spotlight exemplary social innovations in American business. In 2000, he provided an endowment for a multidisciplinary research and public policy center that explored the convergence of entertainment, commerce, and society at the [[University of Southern California]] [[USC Annenberg School for Communication|Annenberg School for Communication]]. It was later named the [[Norman Lear Center]] in recognition.

Lear serves on the National Advisory Board of the [[Young Storytellers Foundation]]. He has written articles for ''[[The Huffington Post]]''.

Lear is a trustee emeritus at [[The Paley Center for Media]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paleycenter.org/about-leadership-board-of-trustees/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Declaration of Independence===
In 2001, Lear and his wife, Lyn, purchased a [[Dunlap broadside]]—one of the first published copies of the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]—for $8.1 million. Not a document collector, Lear said in a press release and on the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show that his intent was to tour the document around the United States so that the country could experience its &quot;birth certificate&quot; firsthand.&lt;ref&gt;Today Show interview with Katie Couric on February 8, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Through the end of 2004, the document traveled throughout the United States in the [[Declaration of Independence]] Roadtrip, which Lear organized, visiting several presidential libraries, dozens of museums, as well as the [[2002 Olympics]], [[Super Bowl XXXVI]], and the [[Live 8]] concert in Philadelphia.

Lear and [[Rob Reiner]] produced a filmed, dramatic reading of the Declaration of Independence—the last project filmed by famed [[cinematographer]] [[Conrad Hall]]—on July 4, 2001, at [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]]. The film, introduced by [[Morgan Freeman]], features [[Kathy Bates]], [[Benicio del Toro]], [[Michael Douglas]], [[Mel Gibson]], [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Graham Greene (actor)|Graham Greene]], [[Ming-Na]], [[Edward Norton]], [[Winona Ryder]], [[Kevin Spacey]], and [[Renée Zellweger]] as readers. The film was directed by [[Arvin Brown]] and scored by [[John Williams (composer)|John Williams]].

===Declare Yourself===
In 2004, Lear established Declare Yourself, a national nonpartisan, nonprofit campaign created to empower and encourage eligible 18-29 year-olds in America to register and vote.  Since then, it has registered almost 4 million young people and contributed significantly to the unprecedented turnout of young voters.

===Born Again American===
As part of the ongoing drive to promote active and thoughtful citizenship, Lear premiered BornAgainAmerican.org at the Presidential Inauguration in 2009. The BornAgainAmerican campaign includes a specially commissioned song and an interactive website, reminding visitors of the American values expressed in the Declaration of Independence.
