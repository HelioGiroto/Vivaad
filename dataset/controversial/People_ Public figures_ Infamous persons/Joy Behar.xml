==Early life==
Behar was born Josephina Victoria Occhiuto, in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, New York, to a Catholic family of [[Italian-American|Italian]] descent. Her mother, Rose (''née'' Carbone), was a seamstress, and her father, Gino Occhiuto, was a truck driver for [[Coca-Cola]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nymag&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Dinitia|title=Joy Shtick|journal=New York Magazine|pages=50–51 |publisher=New York Media|date=1992-11-09|id=ISSN0028-7369|accessdate=2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bookref1&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Zukerman|first=Eugenia|title=In My Mother's Closet: An Invitation to Remember|publisher=Sorin Books|year=2003|pages=192–193|isbn=1-893732-47-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; From January 1965 to 1981, she was married to Joe Behar, a college professor, and they had a daughter, Eve Behar, who was born on November 26, 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Righi|first=Len|title=Joy Behar relishes her &quot;View&quot;|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/television/2008367719_joybehar10.html|accessdate=August 1, 2012|newspaper=The Seattle Times (from The Morning Call)|date=November 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=imdb&gt;{{IMDb name|0066877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===The early years and ''The View''===
Behar started her career in show business in the early 1980s as a stand up comedian, including appearances on ABC's ''[[Good Morning America]]'', and ''[[The New Show]]'', a short lived Lorne Michaels NBC project. In 1987 she had a talk show on Lifetime Television called ''Way Off Broadway''. From there she continued to work the comedy club circuit, was a regular on NBC's ''[[Baby Boom (TV series)|Baby Boom]]'', and had minor film roles including ''[[Cookie (film)|Cookie]]'', ''[[This Is My Life (film)|This Is My Life]]'', and ''[[Manhattan Murder Mystery]]''. She also was a [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] radio talk show host, and made appearances on HBO Comedy Specials ''One Night Stand'' and ''Women Of The Night 2''.

In 1997, Behar became one of the original cast members of [[Barbara Walters]]'s [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television creation, ''The View''. Originally, Behar appeared only on the days when Walters was away from the show; ultimately, Behar became a regular co-host, with the panel expanding to five when Walters rejoined. Behar often hosts a segment called &quot;Joy's Comedy Corner&quot; in which she presents up-and-coming comedians.

[[Star Jones]], former co-host on ''The View,'' and Behar had well-publicized disputes. On March 27, 2006, Star Jones called in to the show to discuss a recent operation that she had undergone. After talking with the show's co-hosts, Behar abruptly stated to Jones, &quot;OK, Star. That's enough about you. On to us. Bye. Keep your tits perky!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fox&quot;&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,189337,00.html &quot;Star, Joy Bleeped, Cut Off in On-Air Fight on 'View{{'&quot;}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Jones then responded, &quot;Even today, you [Behar] are still a bitch.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fox&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rybqL5yxjGE &quot;The View Joy Behar Star Jones&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, Behar and her co-hosts, [[Whoopi Goldberg]], [[Elisabeth Hasselbeck]], [[Sherri Shepherd]], and [[Barbara Walters]], won the [[36th Daytime Emmy Awards|Daytime Emmy Award]] for Outstanding Talk Show Host following over a decade of nominations for the show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://goldderby.latimes.com/awards_goldderby/2009/08/bold-and-the-beautiful-scores-bold-victory-at-daytime-emmy-awards.html &quot;Bold wins at Daytime Emmy Awards&quot;], ''Los Angeles Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Joy Behar Show''===
Beginning in 2007, she has occasionally filled in as a [[guest host]] on ''[[Larry King Live]]''. On June 11, 2009, Behar announced that she would be hosting her own news/talk program on CNN's HLN beginning in the fall of 2009, titled ''The Joy Behar Show''. She did not leave ''The View'', but worked on both shows simultaneously.&lt;ref name=&quot;people.com&quot;/&gt;  Despite reportedly being the network's second highest-rated show, HLN decided to cancel the talk show after only two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/06/18/joy-behar-on-her-comeback-talk-show-on-current-tv.html|title=Joy Behar on Her Comeback Talk Show on Current TV|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final broadcast of the ''The Joy Behar Show'' aired on December 15, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news/2012/06/11/joy-behar-to-anchor-new-primetime-show-the-joy-behar-show-for-current-tv-beginning-september-589305/20120611currenttv01|title=Joy Behar to Anchor New Primetime Show &quot;The Joy Behar Show&quot;|publisher=The Futon Critic|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Joy Behar: Say Anything!''===
In June 2012, it was formally announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/252898/joy-behar-to-host-show-on-al-gores-current-tv/|title=Joy Behar To Host Show On Al Gore’s Current TV|work=The Inquisitr|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Behar would be getting another talk show, ''Joy Behar: Say Anything!'',&lt;ref name=&quot;current.com&quot;/&gt; premiering September 4, 2012&lt;ref name=&quot;current.com&quot;/&gt; on the [[Current TV]] network. Its content is expected to be in line with her previous HLN series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/joy-behar-joins-current-tv-335772|title=Joy Behar Joins Current TV|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the new show's launch, Behar began acting as fill-in host for [[Eliot Spitzer]]'s Current TV talk show, ''[[Viewpoint with Eliot Spitzer]]'', starting on July 18, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2012/06/al-gore-announces-new-joy-behar-show/1#.UBSZrGGe5n8|title=Al Gore announces new Joy Behar show|work=USA Today|accessdate=28 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other work===
Behar has also made theater appearances in ''The Food Chain'' and ''[[The Vagina Monologues]].'' Behar wrote a book of humorous essays and stories called ''Joy Shtick – Or What is the Existential Vacuum and Does It Come with Attachments?'', published in 1999. She has also written a children's book called ''Sheetzucacapoopoo: My Kind of Dog'', published in 2006.

Behar frequently incorporates her Italian-American culture into her comedy and once told [[Charlie Rose]] on his PBS program that her grandmother kept a picture of [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] in her home.

She appeared on the eighth season of [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]'s [[Celebrity Poker Showdown]] and finished in fourth place, behind [[Robin Tunney]], [[Christopher Meloni]] and [[Macy Gray]], but ahead of [[Andy Dick]]. She played for the [[U.S. Fund for UNICEF]].

Behar played the part of &quot;Dr. Lucy&quot; in the 2011 comedy film ''[[Hall Pass (film)|Hall Pass]]''.&lt;ref name=hallpass_imdb&gt;{{cite web|title=Hall Pass (2011) - Full cast and crew|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0480687/fullcredits|work=IMDb|accessdate=February 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Since July 12, 1982, Behar has been in a relationship with Steve Janowitz, to whom she referred as her &quot;spousal equivalent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Talk show host Joy Behar weds boyfriend of 29 years|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-08-13/entertainment/joy.behar.married_1_joy-behar-steve-janowitz-hln?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ|newspaper=CNN|date=August 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 17, 2009, Behar announced on ''The View'' that she might eventually marry Janowitz,&lt;ref name=&quot;people-partner&quot;&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20266245,00.html Joy Behar May Marry Boyfriend] People, March 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but she called off the engagement three months later&lt;ref name=&quot;engagement-cold-feet&quot;&gt;[http://www.okmagazine.com/2009/07/red-carpet-confidential-joy-behar-says-marriage-grandchildren-can-wait/ Joy Behar Marriage Can Wait] OK!, July 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; because she wanted people to stop talking about it. On August 11, 2011, Behar and Janowitz married, but she chose to maintain her last name.&lt;ref name=married&gt;{{cite news|last=Shira|first=Dahvi|title=Joy Behar Marries Steve Janowitz|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20518166,00.html|accessdate=August 13, 2011|newspaper=People|date=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple resides in [[Manhattan]], [[New York]].
