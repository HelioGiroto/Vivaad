'''Karl Christian Rove''' (born December 25, 1950) is an American [[political consultant]] and policy advisor. He was [[Senior Advisor]] and [[White House Deputy Chief of Staff|Deputy Chief of Staff]] during the [[George W. Bush]] administration until Rove's resignation on August 31, 2007. He has headed the Office of Political Affairs, the [[Office of Public Liaison]], and the [[White House Office of Strategic Initiatives]]. Since leaving the [[George W. Bush administration|White House]], Rove has worked as a political analyst and contributor for [[Fox News]], ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''.

Prior to his White House appointments, Rove was a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[political consulting|political consultant]] and strategist.  He is credited with the 1994 and 1998 Texas gubernatorial victories of [[George W. Bush]], as well as Bush's 2000 and 2004 successful presidential campaigns. In his 2004 victory speech Bush referred to Rove as &quot;the Architect&quot;.  Rove has also been credited for the successful campaigns of [[John Ashcroft]] (1994 U.S. Senate election), [[Bill Clements]] (1986 Texas gubernatorial election), Senator [[John Cornyn]] (2002 U.S. Senate election), [[Governor of Texas|Governor]] [[Rick Perry]] (1990 Texas Agriculture Commission election), and [[Phil Gramm]] (1982 [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House]] and 1984 U.S. Senate elections).

==Early years==
===Family, upbringing, early education===
Rove was born in [[Denver, Colorado]], the second of five children, and was later raised in [[Sparks, Nevada]]. His biological father left the family when Rove and his older brother were children. His mother, Reba Louise (née Wood), was a gift shop manager, and his mother's second husband, Louis Claude Rove, Jr. (1928–2004), who adopted him&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/11/us/politics/11BAKER.html?pagewanted=4&amp;hp &quot;Rove on Rove: A Conversation With the Former Bush Senior Adviser&quot; p. 4] Interview with Peter Baker, ''The New York Times'', 2010-03-11. Retrieved 2010-03-14.&lt;/ref&gt; and whom Rove knew as his father, was a [[geology|geologist]] whose ancestry was [[Norwegian American|Norwegian]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bookref1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Alexander|first=Paul|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Machiavelli's Shadow: The Rise and Fall of Karl Rove|publisher=Rodale|year=2008|location=|page=17|month=|url=|isbn=1-59486-825-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Social Security Death Index]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, his family moved to [[Salt Lake City]], where Rove entered high school, becoming a skilled debater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brendan |last=Banaszak |first2=Ron |last2=Elving |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5481603 |title=Karl Rove, the President's 'Boy Genius' |publisher=NPR |date=June 13, 2006 |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rove described his high school years as &quot;I was the complete nerd. I had the briefcase. I had the [[pocket protector]]. I wore [[Hush Puppies]] when they were not cool. I was the thin, scrawny little guy. I was definitely uncool.&quot; Encouraged by a teacher to run for class senate, Rove won the election.  As part of his campaign strategy he rode in the back of a convertible inside the school gymnasium sitting between two attractive girls before his election speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/architect/interviews/slater.html Frontline interview with author William Slater] NPR published PBS Frontline interview, posted April 12, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; While at [[Olympus High School]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20050720/ai_n14776589 Newsmakers go forth from Utah Olympus] by Lee Benson, Deseret Morning News, July 20, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; he was elected student council president his junior and senior years. Rove was also a [[Teenage Republicans|Teenage Republican]] and served as Chairman of the Utah Federation of Teenage Republicans.

===Entry into politics===
Rove began his involvement in American politics in 1968. In a 2002 ''[[Deseret News]]'' interview, Rove explained, &quot;I was the Olympus High chairman for (former [[United States Senator]]) [[Wallace F. Bennett]]'s re-election campaign, where he was opposed by the dynamic, young, aggressive political science professor at the [[University of Utah]], J.D. Williams.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;underdog&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/952840/Triumph-of-the-underdog.html|title=Triumph of the underdog | author=Lee Davidson |publisher=Deseret News | date=December 8, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett was reelected to a third six-year term in November 1968. Through Rove's campaign involvement, Bennett's son, [[Robert Foster Bennett|Bob Bennett]]&amp;mdash;a future United States Senator from [[Utah]]&amp;mdash;would become a friend. Williams would later become a mentor to Rove.

In December 1969, the man Rove had known as his father left the family, and [[divorce]]d Rove's mother soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Rove has expressed great love and admiration for his adoptive father and for &quot;how selfless&quot; his love had been.&lt;ref name=&quot;new-yorker-profile-2003&quot;&gt;''[[The New Yorker]]'' profile: [http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/05/12/030512fa_fact_lemann The Controller: Karl Rove is working to get George Bush reelected, but he has bigger plans.] by Nicholas Lemann &quot;Profiles&quot;, ''The New Yorker.'', May 12, 2003.  [http://bnfp.org/neighborhood/Lemann_Rove_NYM.htm (mirror)].&lt;/ref&gt; On September 11, 1981, Rove's mother committed [[suicide]] in [[Reno, Nevada]].&lt;ref name=&quot;situation_room_transcripts&quot;&gt;''[[CNN]]'' Transcripts: [http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1003/05/sitroom.03.html The Situation Room: Reversal on 9/11 Trials; Karl Rove's Book; Shooting outside the Pentagon; Violent Incidents; Millennial Second Thoughts; Mitt Romney Interview.], ''CNN: The Situation Room'', Aired March 5, 2010 - 19:00 ET.&lt;/ref&gt;

===College and the Dixon campaign incident===
In the fall of 1969, Rove entered the [[University of Utah]], on a $1,000 scholarship,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=Rove: Ex-Utahn in crisis; Unethical revenge would not surprise his U. poli-sci prof; Rove known as a fierce competitor|publisher=The Salt Lake Tribune | author=Matt Canham and Thomas Burr | date=November 6, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a [[political science]] major and joined the [[Pi Kappa Alpha]] fraternity. Through the University's [[Hinckley Institute of Politics]], he got an [[intern]]ship with the [[Utah Republican Party]]. That position, and contacts from the 1968 Bennett campaign, helped him land a job in 1970 on [[Ralph Tyler Smith]]'s unsuccessful re-election campaign for [[United States Senate|Senate]] from [[Illinois]] against [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Adlai E. Stevenson III]].

In the fall of 1970, Rove used a false identity to enter the campaign office of Democrat [[Alan J. Dixon]], who was running for [[Treasurer of Illinois]]. He stole 1000 sheets of paper with campaign letterhead, printed fake campaign rally fliers promising &quot;free beer, free food, girls and a good time for nothing&quot;, and distributed them at rock concerts and [[homeless]] shelters, with the effect of disrupting Dixon's rally. (Dixon eventually won the election). Rove's role would not become publicly known until August 1973. Rove told the ''Dallas Morning News'' in 1999, &quot;It was a youthful prank at the age of 19 and I regret it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;balz-2003-strategist&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/wh2000/stories/rove072399.htm | title=Karl Rove - The Strategist|publisher=The Washington Post|author=Dan Balz|date=July 23, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his memoir, Rove wrote that when he was later nominated to the Board for International Broadcasting by President George H.W. Bush, Senator Dixon did not kill his nomination.  In Rove's account, &quot;Dixon displayed more grace than I had shown and kindly excused this youthful prank.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rove, Karl. Courage and Consequence: My Life as a Conservative in the Fight (2010) pg. 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

===College Republicans, Watergate, and the Bushes===
In June 1971, after the end of the semester, Rove [[Dropping out|dropped out]] of the University of Utah to take a paid position as the Executive Director of the [[College Republicans|College Republican National Committee]]. Joe Abate, who was National Chairman of the College Republicans at the time, became a mentor to Rove.&lt;ref name=&quot;new-yorker-profile-2003&quot;/&gt; He enrolled at the [[University of Maryland in College Park]] in the Fall of 1971, but withdrew from classes during the first half of the semester.&lt;ref name=&quot;Draft&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=Salt Lake Tribune |date=September 18, 2004 |title=Did Karl Rove dodge the draft? |url=http://www.sltrib.com/ci_2416757 |author=Rebecca Walsh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rove traveled extensively, participating as an instructor at weekend seminars for campus [[conservative]]s across the country. He was an active participant in [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[U.S. presidential election, 1972|1972 Presidential campaign]]. A CBS report on the organization of the Nixon campaign from June 1972 includes an interview with a young Rove working for the College Republican National Committee.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Rove held the position of executive director of the College Republicans until early 1973. He left the job to spend five months, without pay, campaigning full-time for the position of national chairman of the organization, for the 1973-1975 term in the same years he attended [[George Mason University]].&lt;ref name=&quot;new-yorker-profile-2003&quot;/&gt; [[Lee Atwater]], the group's Southern regional coordinator, who was two months younger than Rove, managed Rove's campaign. The two spent the spring of 1973 crisscrossing the country in a [[Ford Pinto]], lining up the support of Republican state chairs.

The College Republicans summer 1973 convention at the Lake of the Ozarks resort in [[Missouri]] was quite contentious. Rove's opponent was [[Robert Edgeworth]] of [[Michigan]]. The other major candidate, [[Terry Dolan (US political figure)|Terry Dolan]] of [[California]], dropped out, supporting Edgeworth. A number of states had sent two competing delegates, because Rove and his supporters had made credentials challenges at state and regional conventions. For example, after the Midwest regional convention, Rove forces had produced a version of the Midwestern College Republicans constitution which differed significantly from the constitution that the Edgeworth forces were using, in order to justify the unseating of the Edgeworth delegates on procedural grounds,&lt;ref name=&quot;new-yorker-profile-2003&quot;/&gt; including delegations, such as [[Ohio]] and Missouri, which had been certified earlier by Rove himself. In the end, there were two votes, conducted by two convention chairs, and two winners&amp;mdash;Rove and Edgeworth, each of whom delivered an acceptance speech. After the convention, both Edgeworth and Rove appealed to [[Republican National Committee]] Chairman [[George H. W. Bush]], each contending that he was the new College Republican chairman.

While resolution was pending, Dolan went (anonymously) to the ''[[Washington Post]]'' with recordings of several training seminars for young Republicans where a co-presenter of Rove's, Bernie Robinson, cautioned against doing the same thing he had done: rooting through opponents' garbage cans. The tape with this story on it, as well as Rove's admonition not to copy similar tricks as Rove's against Dixon, was secretly recorded and edited by Rich Evans, who had hoped to receive an appointment from Rove's competitor in CRNC chairmanship race.&lt;ref&gt;Rove, Karl.  Courage and Consequence: My Life as a Conservative in the Fight (2010), pg. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;  On August 10, 1973, in the midst of the Watergate scandal, the ''Post'' broke the story in article titled &quot;GOP Party Probes Official as Teacher of Tricks&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardbrains&quot;/&gt;

In response, then RNC Chairman George H.W. Bush had an FBI agent question Rove. As part of the investigation, Atwater signed an [[affidavit]], dated August 13, 1973, stating that he had heard a &quot;20 minute anecdote similar to the one described in the ''Washington Post''&quot; in July 1972, but that &quot;it was a funny story during a coffee break&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/architect/rove/cron.html ''[[Frontline (US TV series)|Frontline]]'': Karl Rove - the Architect: Mastermind: Chronology - Karl Rove's life and political career] at PBS.org&lt;/ref&gt; Former Nixon White House Counsel [[John Dean]], who was implicated in the Watergate break-in and became the star witness for the prosecution, has been quoted as saying &quot;based on my review of the files, it appears the Watergate prosecutors were interested in Rove's activities in 1972, but because they had bigger fish to fry they did not aggressively investigate him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/03/31/dean/index1.html Creepier Than Nixon] by David Talbot on Salon.com. March 31, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 1973, three weeks after announcing his intent to investigate the allegations against Rove, [[George H.W. Bush]] chose Rove to be chairman of the College Republicans. Bush then wrote Edgeworth a letter saying that he had concluded that Rove had fairly won the vote at the convention. Edgeworth wrote back, asking about the basis of that conclusion. Not long after that, Edgeworth stated &quot;Bush sent me back the angriest letter I have ever received in my life. I had leaked to the ''[[Washington Post]]'', and now I was out of the Party forever.&quot;

As National Chairman, Rove introduced Bush to Atwater, who had taken Rove's job as the College Republican's executive director, and who would become Bush's main campaign strategist in future years. Bush hired Rove as a special assistant in the Republican National Committee, a job Rove left in 1974 to become executive assistant to the co-chair of the RNC, [[Richard D. Obenshain]].

As special assistant, Rove also performed small personal tasks for Bush. In November 1973, Bush asked Rove to take a set of car keys to his son [[George W. Bush]], who was visiting home during a break from [[Harvard Business School]]. It was the first time the two met. &quot;Huge amounts of charisma, swagger, cowboy boots, flight jacket, wonderful smile, just charisma - you know, wow&quot;, Rove recalled years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardbrains&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uselections2004/story/0,13918,1165126,00.html|title=The Brains|work=[[The Guardian]], March 9, 2004 | location=London | first=Julian | last=Borger | date=March 9, 2004 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Texas years and notable political campaigns==

===1977–1991===
Rove's initial job in Texas was as a legislative aide for Fred Agnich, a Texas state representative, in Agnich's Dallas office. Later in 1977, Rove got a job as executive director of the Fund for Limited Government, a political action committee (PAC) in Houston headed by [[James Baker]], a Houston lawyer (later President George H.W. Bush's Secretary of State). The PAC eventually became the genesis of the Bush-for-President campaign of 1979–1980.

His work for [[William Clements]] during the Texas [[Governor of Texas|gubernatorial]] election of 1978 helped Clements become the first Republican Governor of Texas in over 100 years. Clements was elected to a four-year term, succeeding Democrat [[Dolph Briscoe]]. Rove was deputy director of the Governor William P. Clements Junior Committee in 1979 and 1980, and deputy executive assistant to the governor of Texas (roughly, Deputy Chief of Staff) in 1980 and 1981.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marquiswhoswho.com/ MarquisWhosWho.com] (commercial site).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981, Rove founded a [[direct mail]] consulting firm, '''Karl Rove &amp; Co.''', in Austin. The firm's first clients included Texas Governor Bill Clements and [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] congressman [[Phil Gramm]], who later became a Republican congressman and [[United States Senate|United States Senator]]. Rove operated his consulting business until 1999, when he sold the firm to take a full-time position in George W. Bush's presidential campaign.

Between 1981 and 1999, Rove worked on hundreds of races. Most were in a supporting role, doing direct mail fundraising. A November 2004 ''[[Atlantic Monthly]]'' article estimated that he was the primary strategist for 41 statewide, congressional, and national races, and Rove's candidates won 34 races.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karl Rove in a Corner&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200411/green/3|title=Karl Rove in a Corner|author=Green, Joshua|publisher=The Atlantic Monthly|date=November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rove also did work during those years for non-political clients. From 1991 to 1996, Rove advised tobacco giant [[Altria Group|Philip Morris]], and ultimately earned $3,000 a month via a consulting contract. In a [[Deposition (law)|deposition]], Rove testified that he severed the tie in 1996 because he felt awkward &quot;about balancing that responsibility with his role as Bush's top political advisor&quot; while Bush was governor of Texas and Texas was suing the [[tobacco industry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nerdbehind&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dallasobserver.com/Issues/1999-05-13/news/feature_print.html|author=Rozen, Miriam|publisher=The Dallas Observer|date=May 13, 1999|title=The Nerd Behind the Throne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1978 George W. Bush congressional campaign====
Rove advised the younger Bush during his unsuccessful Texas congressional campaign in 1978.

====1980 George H. W. Bush presidential campaign====
In 1977, Rove was the first person hired by [[George H. W. Bush]] for his unsuccessful [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential campaign]], which ended with Bush as the vice-presidential nominee.

====1982 William Clements, Jr. gubernatorial campaign====
In 1982, [[Bill Clements]] ran for reelection, but was defeated by Democrat [[Mark White]].

====1982 Phil Gramm congressional campaign====
In 1982, [[Phil Gramm]] was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives as a conservative Texas Democrat.

====1984 Phil Gramm senatorial campaign====
In 1984, Rove helped Gramm, who had become a Republican in 1983, defeat Republican [[Ron Paul]] in the primary and Democrat [[Lloyd Doggett]] in the race for U.S. Senate.

====1984 Ronald Reagan presidential campaign====
Rove handled direct-mail for the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]]-Bush campaign.

====1986 William Clements, Jr. gubernatorial campaign====
In 1986, Rove helped Clements become governor a second time. In a strategy memo Rove wrote for his client prior to the race, now among Clements's papers in the [[Texas A&amp;M University]] library, Rove quoted [[Napoleon]]: &quot;The whole art of war consists in a well-reasoned and extremely circumspect defensive, followed by rapid and audacious attack.&quot;

In 1986, just before a crucial debate in campaign, Rove claimed that his office had been bugged by Democrats. The police and [[FBI]] investigated and discovered that the bug's battery was so small that it needed to be changed every few hours, and the investigation was dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogcritics.org/archives/2004/09/04/135514.php|title=Bush's Brain| date=September 4, 2004 |author=El Bicho|publisher=blogcritics.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics, including other Republican operatives, suspected Rove had bugged his own office to garner sympathy votes in the close governor's race.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/transcripts_060404_roving.html | title= Roving Reporters|date=June 4, 2004| publisher=onthemedia.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====1988 Texas Supreme Court races====
In 1988, Rove helped [[Thomas R. Phillips]] become the first Republican elected as Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme Court. Phillips had been appointed to the position in November 1987 by Clements. Phillips was re-elected in 1990, 1996 and 2002.

Phillips' election in 1988 was part of an aggressive grassroots campaign called &quot;Clean Slate '88&quot;, a conservative effort that was successful in getting five of its six candidates elected. (Ordinarily there were three justices on the ballot each year, on a nine-justice court, but, because of resignations, there were six races for the Supreme Court on the ballot in November 1988.) By 1998, Republicans held all nine seats on the Court.

====1990 Texas gubernatorial campaign====
In 1989, Rove encouraged George W. Bush to run for Texas governor, brought in experts to tutor him on policy, and introduced him to local reporters. Eventually, Bush decided not to run, and Rove backed another Republican for governor who lost in the primary.

====Other 1990 Texas statewide races====
In 1990, two other Rove candidates won: [[Rick Perry]], the future governor of the state, became agricultural commissioner, and [[Kay Bailey Hutchison]] became state treasurer. 

One notable aspect of the 1990 election was the charge that Rove had asked the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) to investigated major Democratic officeholders in Texas. In his autobiography, Rove called the whole thing a &quot;myth&quot;, saying:

* The FBI did investigate Texas officials during that span, but I had nothing to do with it. The investigation was called &quot;[[Brilab]]&quot; and was part of a broad anti[[corruption]] probe that looked at officials in Louisiana, Oklahoma, Los Angelele, and Washington, D.C., as well as Texas. ... An official for the U.S. Department of Agriculture spotted expenses claimed by [[Jim Hightower|Hightower]]'s shop that raised red flags ... enough to indict some of Hightower's top aides; they were later found guilty and sent to prison.
* The myth that I had something to do both with spurring the investigation and with airing all of this has stuck around because it is convenient for some to blame me rather than those aides who ran afoul of the law.

====1991 Richard L. Thornburgh senatorial campaign and lawsuit====
In 1991, [[United States Attorney General]] [[Dick Thornburgh]] resigned to run for a Senate seat in [[Pennsylvania]], one made vacant by [[John Heinz]]'s death in a helicopter crash. Rove's company worked for the campaign, but it ended with an upset loss to Democrat [[Harris Wofford]]. Rove subsequently sued Thornburgh alleging non-payment for services rendered. The [[Republican National Committee]], worried that the suit would make it hard to recruit good candidates, urged Rove to back off. When Rove refused, the RNC hired [[Kenneth Starr]] to write an [[amicus brief]] on Thornburgh's behalf. After a trial in Austin, Rove prevailed.&lt;ref name=&quot;new-yorker-profile-2003&quot;/&gt; ''Karl Rove &amp; Co. v. Thornburgh'' was heard by U.S. Federal Judge [[Sam Sparks]] (who had been appointed by George H.W. Bush in 1991).

===1992 George H. W. Bush presidential campaign===
Rove was fired from the 1992 Bush presidential campaign after he planted a negative story with columnist [[Robert Novak]] about dissatisfaction with campaign fundraising chief [[Robert Mosbacher Jr.]] (''[[Esquire Magazine]]'', January 2003). Novak provided some evidence of motive in his column describing the firing of Mosbacher by former Senator [[Phil Gramm]]: &quot;Also attending the session was political consultant Karl Rove, who had been shoved aside by Mosbacher.&quot; Novak and Rove deny that Rove was the leaker, but Mosbacher maintained that &quot;Rove is the only one with a motive to leak this. We let him go. I still believe he did it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/06/politics/06novak.html|title=Rove and Novak, a 20-Year Friendship Born in Texas|date=August 6, 2005|author=Bumiller, Elisabeth|work=The New York Times|page=A8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During testimony before the [[CIA leak grand jury investigation|CIA leak grand jury]], Rove apparently confirmed his prior involvement with Novak in the 1992 campaign leak, according to ''[[National Journal]]'' reporter [[Murray Waas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.nationaljournal.com/articles/0525nj1.htm|title=Rove-Novak Call Was Concern To Leak Investigators|date=May 25, 2006|author=Waas, Murray|publisher=National Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1993–2000===
'''1993 Kay Bailey Hutchison senatorial campaign'''
Rove helped Hutchison win a special Senate election in June 1993. Hutchison defeated Democrat [[Bob Krueger]] to fill the last two years of [[Lloyd Bentsen]]'s term. Bentsen resigned to become [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]] in the Clinton administration.

'''1994 Alabama Supreme Court races'''
In 1994, a group called the '''Business Council of Alabama''' hired Rove to help run a slate of Republican candidates for the state supreme court. No Republican had been elected to that court in more than a century. The campaign by the Republicans was unprecedented in the state, which had previously only seen low-key contests. After the election, a court battle over absentee and other ballots followed that lasted more than 11 months. It ended when a federal appeals court judge ruled that disputed absentee ballots could not be counted, and ordered the [[Alabama Secretary of State]] to certify the Republican candidate for Chief Justice, [[Perry Hooper]], as the winner. An appeal to the Supreme Court by the Democratic candidate was turned down within a few days, making the ruling final. Hooper won by 262 votes.

Another candidate, [[Harold See]], ran against [[Mark Kennedy (politician)|Mark Kennedy]], an incumbent Democratic justice and the son-in-law of [[George Wallace]]. The race included charges that Kennedy was mingling campaign funds with those of a [[non-profit]] children's foundation he was involved with. A former Rove staffer reported that some within the See camp initiated a [[whisper campaign]] that Kennedy was a [[pedophile]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Karl Rove in a Corner&quot; /&gt; Kennedy won by less than one percentage point.

'''1994 John Ashcroft senatorial campaign'''
In 1993, according to the ''[[New York Times]]'', Karl Rove &amp; Company was paid $300,000 in consulting fees by Ashcroft's successful 1994 Senate campaign. Ashcroft paid Rove's company more than $700,000 over the course of three campaigns.

'''1994 George W. Bush gubernatorial campaign'''
In 1993, Rove began advising George W. Bush in his successful campaign to become governor of Texas. Bush announced his candidacy in November 1993. By January 1994, Bush had spent more than $600,000 on the race against incumbent Democrat [[Ann Richards]], with $340,000 of that paid to Rove's firm.

Rove has been accused of using the [[push poll]] technique to call voters to ask such things as whether people would be &quot;more or less likely to vote for Governor Richards if [they] knew her staff is dominated by [[lesbian]]s&quot;. Rove has denied having been involved in circulating these rumors about Richards during the campaign,&lt;ref&gt;Mark, David. ''Going Dirty: The Art of Negative Campaigning''. 2007, p. 204&lt;/ref&gt; although many critics nonetheless identify this technique, particularly as utilized in this instance against Richards, as a hallmark of his career.&lt;ref&gt;Burbach, Roger and Tarbell, Jim. ''Imperial Overstretch: George W. Bush and the Hubris of Empire''. 2004, p. 118

'''1996 Harold See's campaign for Associate Justice, Alabama Supreme Court'''
A former campaign worker charged that, at Rove's behest, he distributed flyers that anonymously attacked [[Harold See]], their own client. This put the opponent's campaign in an awkward position; public denials of responsibility for the scurrilous flyers would be implausible. Rove's client was elected.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

'''1998 George W. Bush gubernatorial campaign'''
Rove was an adviser for Bush's 1998 reelection campaign. From July through December 1998, Bush's reelection committee paid '''Rove &amp; Co.''' nearly $2.5 million, and also paid the Rove-owned Praxis List Company $267,000 for use of mailing lists. Rove says his work for the Bush campaign included direct mail, voter contact, phone banks, computer services, and travel expenses. Of the $2.5 million, Rove said, ''&quot;[a]bout 30 percent of that is postage&quot;''. In all, Bush (primarily through Rove's efforts) raised $17.7 million, with $3.4 million unspent as of March 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.texasobserver.org/showArticle.asp?ArticleID=942|date=February 5, 1999|publisher=The Texas Observer|title=Political Intelligence: Bush Goes A-Rove-ing}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of this campaign Rove's much-reported feud with Rick Perry began, with Perry's strategists believing Rove gave Perry bad advice in order to help Bush get a larger share of the Hispanic vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0711/59687.html |title=POLITICO: If Rick Perry gets in, will Karl Rove be out? |date= |accessdate=2010-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2000 Harold See campaign for Chief Justice'''
For the race to succeed Perry Hooper, who was retiring as [[Alabama]]'s chief justice, Rove lined up support for See from a majority of the state's important Republicans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karl Rove in a Corner&quot;/&gt;

===2000 George W. Bush presidential campaign and the sale of Karl Rove &amp; Co.===
In early 1999, Rove sold his 20-year-old direct-mail business, '''Karl Rove &amp; Co.''', which provided campaign services to candidates, along with '''Praxis List Company''' (in whole or part) to Ted Delisi and Todd Olsen, two young political operatives who had worked on campaigns of some other Rove candidates. Rove helped finance the sale of the company, which had 11 employees. Selling '''Karl Rove &amp; Co.''' was a condition that [[George W. Bush]] had insisted on before Rove took the job of chief strategist for Bush's presidential bid.&lt;ref name=&quot;nerdbehind&quot;/&gt;

==George W. Bush Administration==
{{Main|Karl Rove in the George W. Bush administration}}
[[File:RoveBush.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Rove with George W. and Laura Bush]]
When George W. Bush was first inaugurated in January 2001, Rove accepted an appointment as Senior Advisor. He was later given the title Deputy Chief of Staff to the President after the successful 2004 Presidential election. In a November 2004 speech, Bush publicly thanked Rove, calling him &quot;the architect&quot; of his victory over [[John Kerry]] in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2004/11/20041103-3.html| title=President Bush Thanks Americans in Wednesday Acceptance Speech| publisher=White House press release| date= 2004-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, Rove was reassigned from his policy development role to one focusing on strategic and tactical planning in anticipation of the November 2006 congressional elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-04-19-whitehouseshakeup_x.htm|work=USA Today|publisher=Gannett|title=White House 'transition' continues|author=David Jackson and Richard Benedetto|date=April 20, 2006|accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rove resigned from his position effective August 31, 2007.  Bush hugged his old friend saying, &quot;Karl Rove is moving on down the road ... I'll be on the road behind you here in a little bit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/13/AR2007081300180.html |title=Rove to Leave White House Post |publisher=The Washington Post |date=August 14, 2007 |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities since leaving the White House==
{{recentism|date=October 2010}}
Shortly after leaving the White House, Rove was hired to write about the [[2008 Presidential Election]] for ''[[Newsweek]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.washingtonpost.com/the-trail/2007/11/15/karl_roves_new_gig.html |title=Karl Rove's New Gig |publisher=The Washington Post |date=November 15, 2007 |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also later hired as a contributor for the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' and a political analyst for [[Fox News]]. Rove was an informal advisor to 2008 Republican Presidential candidate [[John McCain]], and donated $2,300 to his campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=8B58A658-3048-5C12-006F9CBBFFC54DE3 &quot;Mehlman, Rove boost McCain campaign&quot;]. ''Politico''.&lt;/ref&gt; His memoir, ''Courage and Consequence'', was published in March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/16/AR2008031602748_pf.html &quot;Rove on Fox: It's Fair to Say He's Mellowed&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; One advance reviewer, [[Dana Milbank]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', said of the book that Rove &quot;revives claims discredited long ago&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Milbank| first = Dana| author-link = Dana Milbank| title = Karl Rove sets the record straight – sort of| newspaper = [[The Washington Post]]| date = March 7, 2010| url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/05/AR2010030502872.html?sid=ST2010030301920&amp;sub=AR| accessdate =2010-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversial book has inspired a [[grassroots]] rock and roll compilation of a similar name [[Courage and Consequence]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karlrovebook.net Karlrovebook.net]&lt;/ref&gt; that was released a week before the memoir.

Rove has also spent significant time on the road giving speeches to schools and other groups. Rove was scheduled to give the commencement address at [[Choate Rosemary Hall]], a New England boarding school, but canceled after protests from students and faculty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/29/nyregion/29choate.html?_r=2&amp;ref=education&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin &quot;Rove Passes Up Commencement Speech at Choate After the Students Object&quot;]. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; He instead made a private appearance at the school on February 11, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtopnews.com/?nid=104&amp;sid=1333127 &quot;Karl Rove Drops Prep School Speech&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 9, 2008, Rove appeared at the [[University of Iowa]] as a paid speaker to a crowd of approximately 1,000. He was met with hostility and two students were removed by police after attempting a [[citizen's arrest]] for alleged crimes committed during his time with the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]. Near the end of the speech, a member of the audience asked, &quot;Can we have our $40,000 back?&quot; Rove replied, &quot;No, you can't.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Rove taunted at University of Iowa|author=Mooney, Alexander|date=March 10, 2008|publisher=CNN|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/03/10/rove-taunted-at-university-of-iowa/|accessdate=2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 22, 2008, Rove was [[subpoena]]ed by [[House Judiciary Committee]] Chairman [[John Conyers]] to testify on the politicization of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]. However, on July 10, Rove refused to acknowledge his congressional subpoena citing [[executive privilege]] as his reason.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Ben (July 10, 2008). &quot;Rove ignores subpoena, refuses to testify on Hill&quot;.

On June 24, 2008, Rove said of Democratic presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]], &quot;Even if you never met him, you know this guy. He's the guy at the country club with the beautiful date, holding a martini and a cigarette that stands against the wall and makes snide comments about everyone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jason |last=Carroll |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/06/26/obama.rove/ |title=Rove, critics try to pin 'arrogant' label on Obama |publisher=CNN |date=June 26, 2008 |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rove agreed to debate one-time presidential candidate and former Senator [[John Edwards]] on September 26, 2008, at the [[University at Buffalo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buffalonews.com/home/story/384676.html &quot;Edwards, Rove to face off in UB debate&quot;]. ''The Buffalo News''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Edwards dropped out and was replaced with [[General Wesley Clark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/news/9620 |title=Wesley Clark to Replace John Edwards in Debate with Rove |publisher=University of Buffalo |date=September 5, 2008 |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rove, who was hired by Fox News to provide analysis for the network's election coverage, defended his role on the news team to the Television Critics Association.&lt;ref name=&quot;re-tools&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last=Hibberd| first=James| url= http://www.thrfeed.com/2008/07/fox-news-defend.html | title= Fox News defends hiring Karl Rove |publisher=The Live Feed}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 3, 2008, Rove spoke on the campus of [[Washington University in St. Louis]] on the eve of [[Election Day (politics)|Election Day]].

On February 23, 2009, Rove was again required by Congressional subpoena to testify before the House Judiciary Committee concerning his knowledge of the U.S. Attorney firings and the alleged political prosecution of former Alabama Governor [[Don Siegelman]] but did not appear on this date. He and former [[White House Counsel]] [[Harriet Miers]] later agreed to testify under oath before Congress about these matters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/03/04/karl-rove-harriet-miers-t_n_171961.html &quot;Karl Rove, Harriet Miers To Testify Before House Judiciary Committee&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 7 and July 30, 2009, Rove testified before the House Judiciary Committee regarding questions about the dismissal of seven U.S. Attorneys under the Bush Administration. Rove was also questioned regarding the federal prosecution of former Alabama Governor Don Siegleman, who was convicted of fraud. The Committee concluded that Rove had played a significant role in the attorney firings.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} No conclusions were made public regarding Siegleman's prosecution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://judiciary.house.gov/issues/issues_Rove2.html |title=Rove Interview |publisher=U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary |date= |accessdate=2012-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://google.com/search?q=cache:Auie-f7iL04J:www.ca11.uscourts.gov/opinions/ops/200713163.pdf+Don+Siegelman+11th+Circuit+Court+of+appeals&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=firefox-a |title=US v.

In 2010, Rove became an advisor to [[American Crossroads]], a Republican [[527 organization]] raising money in competition with the [[Republican National Committee]].&lt;ref&gt;Cillizza, Chris (April 5, 2010). [http://voices.washingtonpost.com/thefix/morning-fix/20100405-tea-party-poll.html &quot;Republicans plan $50 million independent effort in 2010&quot;]. ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rove made appearances at a number of campuses, including [[UC Merced]] on October 8 as conservatives students, in the [[College Republicans]] at UC Merced, sought to provide an alternative perspective since First Lady [[Michelle Obama]] and Former President [[Jimmy Carter]] spoke at the young campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucmerced.edu/news_articles/07122010_student_group_to_bring.asp Student Group to Bring Karl Rove to UC Merced], &quot;[[UC Merced]]'', July 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Rove was the guest host of ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'' on Monday, August 9, 2010.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_080910/content/01125104.guest.html Rushlimbaugh.com]&lt;/ref&gt; marking his first time hosting a radio talk show.

In a profile which appeared in the December 15, 2011 issue of ''The New Republic'', Rove, with his hands-on involvement with American Crossroads, is described as one of the shrewdest navigators of the political climate after the [[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission|Supreme Court's Citizens United decision]] which exempted political broadcasts funded by corporations and unions from campaign finance limits. &quot;Rove had no role in creating this new legal environment...but if Rove and his allies did not invent it, they certainly were adroit at exploiting it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Shapiro | first = Walter | title = Organization Man: Karl Rove and the Rise of the SuperPAC | url = http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/magazine/97760/karl-rove-crossroads-superpac-2012?passthru=NDliOWE3MDI1YzkzYThiOWMxNThmZmM1NmEyMjY1MGY | work = The New Republic | date = 2011-12-15 | accessdate=2011-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following [[Todd Akin|Todd Akin's]] comments regarding &quot;[[Todd Akin 'legitimate rape' and pregnancy comment controversy|legitimate rape]]&quot; and the notion that [[Pregnancy from rape|raped women are unlikely to become pregnant]], Rove joked about murdering the Missouri Senate candidate, saying &quot;We should sink Todd Akin.

==Personal life==
Rove married [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] socialite Valerie Mather Wainwright, on July 10, 1976. He moved to [[Texas]] in January 1977.
