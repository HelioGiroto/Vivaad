His first lead role in a film was in ''[[Half Baked]]'' in 1998. In 2003, he became widely known for his popular [[sketch comedy]] television series, ''[[Chappelle's Show]]'', which ran until his abrupt retirement from the show in 2005.

==Early life==
Chappelle was born '''David Khari Webber Chappelle''' in [[Washington, D.C.]] on August 24, 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;esquire&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/ESQ0506CHAPPELLE_92|title=Heaven Hell Dave Chappelle|publisher=''[[Esquire Magazine|Esquire]]''|author=Powell, Kevin|authorlink=Kevin Powell|date=2006-04-30|accessdate=2008-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bravo&quot;/&gt;  His father, William David Chappelle III, was a professor at [[Antioch College]] in [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bravo&quot;/&gt; His mother, Yvonne ([[married and maiden names|née]] Reed), was a professor at [[Howard University]], [[Prince George's Community College]], and the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] and is also a [[Unitarian Universalist]] [[Minister of religion|minister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Yvonne Seon Biography|publisher=The History Makers.com|url=http://www.thehistorymakers.com/biography/biography.asp?bioindex=611&amp;category=educationMakers|accessdate=2007-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Dave Chappelle is Alive and Well|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/27/arts/television/27itzkoff.html?pagewanted=print | work=The New York Times | date=November 27, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Comedy In Oakland: Dave Chappelle|url=http://www.oaklandseen.com/2010/02/17/comedy-in-oakland-dave-chappelle-on-alicia-keys-john-mayer/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chappelle grew up in [[Silver Spring, Maryland]] and attended [[Woodlin Elementary School]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bravo&quot;/&gt; During young Chappelle's formative years, his comic inspiration came from various comedians, particularly [[Eddie Murphy]] and [[Richard Pryor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bravo&quot;/&gt;

After his parents separated, Chappelle stayed in Washington with his mother while spending summers with his father in [[Ohio]]. In 1991, he graduated from Washington's [[Duke Ellington School of the Arts]] where he studied [[theatre arts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bravo&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title = Dave Chappelle|episodelink = Inside the Actors Studio|series = Inside the Actors Studio|serieslink = Inside the Actors Studio|network = [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]|airdate = 2006-02-12|season = 12|number = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chappelle moved to New York City to pursue a career as a comedian. He gathered the courage to perform at [[Harlem]]'s famed [[Apollo Theater]] in front of the infamous &quot;Amateur Night&quot; audience. The performance resulted in him being [[booing|boo]]ed off the stage. Chappelle has described the experience as the moment that gave him the courage to continue his show business aspirations.&lt;ref name=&quot;bravo&quot;/&gt; He quickly made a name for himself in the New York comedy circuit, even performing in the city's parks. At the age of 19, Chappelle made his film debut as &quot;Ahchoo&quot; in [[Mel Brooks]]' ''[[Robin Hood: Men in Tights]]''. In the same year, Chappelle was offered the role of Benjamin Buford &quot;Bubba&quot; Blue in ''[[Forrest Gump]]''. Concerned the character was demeaning and the movie would bomb, he turned down the part.&lt;ref name=&quot;ajc2007&quot;&gt;Staff report (August 23, 2007).

J. Simpson murder case|OJ Simpson being accused of murder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gore1998&quot;&gt;Gore, Chris (January 26, 1998). [http://www.filmthreat.com/festivals/161/ Park City Madness: Sundance, Slamdance, and Slamdunk 1998.] ''[[Film Threat]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Chappelle played another supporting movie role in the 1994 film ''[[Getting In]]''.

He attracted the attention of TV network executives and developed numerous [[television pilot|pilot]]s but none of them were picked up for series.&lt;ref name=&quot;bravo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=freedom/&gt; In 1995, he made a guest appearance in an episode of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s highly rated [[situation comedy|sitcom]] ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]''. The storyline had Chappelle and real-life friend comedian [[Jim Breuer]] ask [[Tim Taylor (fictional character)|Tim Taylor]] for advice on their girlfriends. The characters' single outing in the episode proved so popular that ABC decided to give them their own [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] sitcom titled ''[[Buddies (TV series)|Buddies]]''. However, after taping a [[Television pilot|pilot episode]], Jim Breuer was fired and replaced with actor [[Christopher Gartin]]. ''Buddies'' premiered in March 1996 to disappointing [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]]. The show was cancelled after only four episodes out of thirteen that were produced. Nine years later, in May 2005, ten of the episodes were released on a single-disc [[DVD]] to capitalize on Chappelle's new-found fame.

After the failure of ''Buddies'', Chappelle starred in another pilot. According to Chappelle, the network was uncomfortable with the [[African-American]] cast and wanted [[White American|white]] actors added. Chappelle resisted and subsequently accused the network of racism. Shortly after this incident, Chappelle's father died. Chappelle returned to Ohio and considered leaving the entertainment business.&lt;ref name=&quot;bravo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=freedom/&gt;

He later appeared as a nightclub comedian in the 1996 comedy ''[[The Nutty Professor (1996 film)|The Nutty Professor]]'' starring [[Eddie Murphy]], one of his major comedic influences. He also had a minor role in 1997's ''[[Con Air]]''. He and [[Neal Brennan]] co-wrote the 1998 [[cult film|cult]] [[stoner film]] ''[[Half Baked]]'', Chappelle's first starring role, about a group of [[Cannabis|marijuana]]-smoking friends trying to get their friend out of jail. That same year, he appeared in &quot;Pilots and Pens Lost&quot;, a 1998 episode of ''[[The Larry Sanders Show]]'''s sixth season, in which he and the executives of the show's nameless [[television network]] satirized the treatment to which scriptwriters and show creators were subjected, as well as the executives' knee-jerk tendencies toward racial stereotypes. In December of that year Chappelle appeared as [[Tom Hanks]]' friend and confidant in ''[[You've Got Mail]]''. In 1999, he appeared in the [[Martin Lawrence]] film ''[[Blue Streak (film)|Blue Streak]]''.

In 2000, Chappelle recorded his first [[HBO]] special, ''Dave Chappelle: Killin' Them Softly'', in [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000095J1K ''Dave Chappelle: Killin' Them Softly''] at Amazon.com; Accessed September 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this up with an appearance as &quot;Conspiracy Brother&quot; in the 2002 racial satire ''[[Undercover Brother]]''.

==2003–2006: Standup and ''Chappelle's Show''==
{{main|Chappelle's Show}}
In 2003, Chappelle debuted his own weekly sketch comedy show on [[Comedy Central]] called ''[[Chappelle's Show]]''. The show parodied many aspects of [[American culture]] including [[Ethnic stereotype|racial stereotypes]], [[politics]] and [[pop culture]]. Along with comedy skits, the show also featured musical performances by mostly [[hip-hop music|hip-hop]] and [[soul (music)|soul]] artists.

Chappelle's pointed social and political commentary quickly helped the show garner critical and commercial success as well as controversy.&lt;ref name=freedom/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Feeney|first =Matt|title =Why is Dave Chappelle's Malice So Winning?|publisher =[[Slate.com]]|url =http://www.slate.com/id/2096599/|date=March 4, 2004|accessdate =2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Pryor]], one of Chappelle's comedic influences, was a fan of the show and stated that he had &quot;passed the [[torch]]&quot; to Chappelle.&lt;ref name=freedom&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/10/19/60II/main650149.shtml|title = Chappelle: 'An Act Of Freedom'|publisher= ''[[60 Minutes II]]'', [[CBS News]]|author=Leung, Rebecca|date=December 29, 2004|accessdate = 2007-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chappelle received two [[Emmy]] nominations for the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =|first =|title =Awards for Dave Chappelle|publisher =[[IMDb.com]]|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0152638/awards}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the DVD set became the best-selling DVD of a television show to date, overtaking the previous best-selling, ''[[The Simpsons]]'' first season DVD. It had sold over 3 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videobusiness.com/article/CA627685.html|title = Latest Chappelle DVD is Selling Like Crazy|publisher= Video Business|first = Susanne|last = Ault|date=June 3, 2005|accessdate = 2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the show's popularity, Comedy Central's parent company [[Viacom]] reportedly offered Chappelle a $55 million contract (giving Chappelle a share of DVD sales) to continue production of ''Chappelle's Show'' for two more years while allowing him to do side projects. Chappelle had stated that sketches are not his favorite form of comedy, and that the characteristics of the show's format were somewhat like [[short film]]s.

In June 2004, based on the popularity of the &quot;Rick James&quot; sketch, it was announced that Chappelle was in talks to portray [[Rick James]] in a [[biopic]] from [[Paramount Pictures]] (also owned by Viacom).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1488300/06102004/story.jhtml|title = Dave Chappelle Is Rick James, Bitch!|publisher= [[MTV News]]|first = Alyssa|last = Rashbaum|date=June 10, 2004|accessdate = 2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; James's estate disagreed with the proposed comical tone of the film and put a halt to the talks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117955707.html?categoryid=13&amp;cs=1|title = Turner to script singer James's biopic|publisher= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|first = Michael|last = Fleming|date=December 13, 2006|accessdate = 2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Chappelle recorded his second comedy special, this time airing on Showtime - ''Dave Chappelle: For What It's Worth'', at [[San Francisco]]'s [[The Fillmore|Fillmore Auditorium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0009VRHLU ''Dave Chappelle: For What It's Worth''] at Amazon.com; Accessed September 29, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season three turbulence===
In a June 2004 stand-up performance in [[Sacramento, California]], Chappelle walked off the stage after berating his audience for constantly shouting &quot;I'm [[Rick James]], bitch!,&quot; which became a [[catchphrase]] from the popular &quot;Rick James&quot; sketch. After a few minutes, Chappelle returned and continued by saying, &quot;The show is ruining my life.&quot; He stated that he disliked working &quot;20 hours a day&quot; and that the popularity of the show was making it difficult for him to continue his stand-up career, which was &quot;the most important thing&quot; to him. He also told the audience:

{{quote|You know why my show is good? Because the network officials say you're not smart enough to get what I'm doing, and every day I fight for you. I tell them how smart you are. Turns out, I was wrong. You people are stupid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Dave Chappelle lets rude crowd have it, sticks up for Cosby's comment.|publisher= [[Sacramento Bee]]|first = Jim|last = Carnes|date=June 18, 2004|accessdate = 2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Season 3 was scheduled to air on May 31, 2005, but in that month, Chappelle stunned fans and the entertainment industry when he abruptly left during production of the third season of ''Chappelle's Show'' and took a trip to South Africa. Chappelle has since stated that he was unhappy with the direction the show had taken.

{{quote|Coming here I don't have the distractions of fame. It quiets the ego down. I'm interested in the kind of person I've got to become. I want to be well rounded and the industry is a place of extremes. I want to be well balanced.

===Return===
In June 2005, Chappelle performed impromptu stand-up shows in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1065847,00.html|title = The Buckeye Stops Here|publisher= [[Entertainment Weekly]]|first = Gary|last = Susman|date=May 26, 2005|accessdate = 2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1068717,00.html|title = True Hollywood Story|publisher= [[Entertainment Weekly]]|first = Gary|last = Susman|date=June 3, 2005|accessdate = 2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/11/27/arts/television/27itzkoff.html?pagewanted=1&amp;ei=5090&amp;en=d4621faea456d339&amp;ex=1290747600&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss|title = Dave Chappelle Is Alive and Well (and Playing Las Vegas)|publisher= [[The New York Times]]|first = Dave|last = Itzkoff|date=November 27, 2005|accessdate = 2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on a tour that began in [[Newport, Kentucky]], not far from his Ohio home.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1509344/20050912/index.jhtml?headlines=true|title = Dave Chappelle Is Back Onstage|publisher= [[MTV News]]|first = Gil|last = Kaufman|date=September 12, 2005|accessdate = 2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also made a surprise appearance on [[HBO]]'s ''[[Def Poetry]]'' where he performed two poems, titled ''Fuck [[Ashton Kutcher]]'' and ''How I Got the Lead on &quot;[[Jeopardy!]].&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[HBO]]|url=http://www.hbo.com/defpoetry/episodes/season5/episode01.html|title=''Def Poetry'': Season 5: Episode 1: Summary}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interviewed for ''[[Inside the Actors Studio]]'' on December 18, 2005 at [[Pace University]]'s [[Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts]]. The show premiered on February 12, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bravotv.com/Inside_the_Actors_Studio/guests/Dave_Chappelle.shtml|publisher=[[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]]|title=''Inside The Actors Studio'': Dave Chappelle's Bio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chappelle stated that the death of his father in 1998 had an impact on his decision to go to South Africa. By throwing himself into his work, he had not taken a chance to mourn his father's death. He also said the rumors that he was in drug or psychiatric treatment only persuaded him to stay in South Africa.&lt;ref name=&quot;bravo&quot;/&gt;

He continued:
{{quote|I would go to work on the show and I felt awful every day, that's not the way it was. ... I felt like some kind of prostitute or something. If I feel so bad, why keep on showing up to this place? I'm going to Africa. The hardest thing to do is to be true to yourself, especially when everybody is watching.}}

Chappelle also said that he felt some of his sketches were &quot;socially irresponsible.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;oprah&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Chappelles-Story/5|title=Chappelle's Story: Dave's Moral Dilemma|publisher=''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insidecable.blogsome.com/2006/07/07/dave-chappelle-on-360-tonight/ |title=Transcript: Interview With Dave Chappelle, July 7, 2006|publisher=''[[Anderson Cooper 360]]'' [[CNN]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He singled out the &quot;[[pixie]] sketch&quot; in which pixies appear to people and encourage them to reinforce stereotypes of their races. In the sketch, Chappelle is wearing [[blackface]] and is dressed as a character in a [[minstrel show]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fears&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7773670/site/newsweek/|title = Fears of a Clown|publisher= [[Newsweek]]|first = Devin|last = Gordon|date=May 16, 2005|accessdate = 2007-03-20 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070205143048/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7773670/site/newsweek/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chappelle, during the filming of the sketch, a crew member was laughing in a way that made him feel uncomfortable and made him rethink the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;oprah&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot; /&gt; Chappelle said, &quot;it was the first time I felt that someone was not laughing with me but laughing at me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;oprah&quot; /&gt;

During these interviews, Chappelle did not rule out returning to ''Chappelle's Show'' to &quot;finish what we started,&quot; but promised that he would not return without changes to the production, such as a better working environment. He also stated he would like to donate half of the DVD sales to charity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/Chappelles-Story/9|title=Chappelle's Story: Future of 'Chappelle's Show'|publisher=''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chappelle expressed disdain at the possibility of his material from the unfinished third season being aired, saying that to do so would be &quot;a bully move,&quot; and that he would not return to the show if Comedy Central were to air the unfinished material.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot; /&gt; On July 9, 2006, Comedy Central aired the first episode of ''[[Chappelle's Show: The Lost Episodes]]''. An uncensored DVD release of the episodes was made available on July 25.

The show still plays in syndication on several television networks despite the relatively small number of episodes compared to most American syndicated television programs.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==''Dave Chappelle's Block Party''==
[[File:Broken Angel House.jpg|alt=|thumb|right|The site of ''[[Dave Chappelle's Block Party]]'' in [[Brooklyn]].]]
Chappelle was the star and [[Film producer|producer]] of the [[Michel Gondry]]-directed documentary ''[[Dave Chappelle's Block Party]]'', which chronicles a Chappelle-hosted concert in the [[Clinton Hill]] neighborhood of [[Brooklyn]] on September 18, 2004. Several musical artists, including [[Kanye West]], [[The Roots]], [[Erykah Badu]], [[Mos Def]], [[Dead Prez]] and [[Jill Scott]] are featured in the movie both performing in the concert and in conversation off-stage. The most surprising highlight of the event was the &quot;last minute&quot; reunion of popular 1990s hip hop group [[The Fugees]]. Chappelle toured several cities in February and March 2006 to promote the film under the moniker &quot;Block Party All-Stars featuring Dave Chappelle&quot;. [[Universal Pictures]]' genre division [[Rogue Pictures]] released the film in the United States on March 3, 2006.

==2007–present==
In April 2007, Chappelle set a stand-up endurance record at the [[Laugh Factory]] Sunset Strip comedy club, beating comedian [[Dane Cook]]'s record of 3 hours and 50 minutes. In December of the same year, Chappelle broke his own record with a time of 6 hours and 12 minutes. Cook reclaimed the record in January 2008, with a time of 7 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,320330,00.html|title = Dane Cook Breaks Dave Chappelle's Laugh Factory Endurance Record|publisher= [[Fox News]]|[[Associated Press]]|date=January 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 19, 2009 Chappelle performed at the Laugh Factory in Los Angeles, where it was speculated that he would aim to take back the record. However, he was disqualified according to the club owner, after he left the stage, five hours into his routine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/10/20/dave-chappelle-fails-to-s_n_327977.html &quot;Dave Chappelle Fails To Set Comedy Endurance Record When Nature Calls&quot;] ''[[The Huffington Post]]''; October 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Chappelle again appeared on ''Inside the Actors Studio'' and in celebration of the show's 200th episode, he humorously interviewed the show's usual host, [[James Lipton]]. The episode aired on November 11, 2008.

==Personal life==
Chappelle lives with his wife Elaine, two sons,&lt;ref name=&quot;fears&quot;/&gt; Sulayman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22774|title = The sixth man|work= [[The A.V.

Regarding his home in [[Yellow Springs, Ohio]], Chappelle says, &quot;Turns out you don't need $50 million to live around these parts, just a nice smile and a kind way about you. You guys are the best neighbors ever,&quot; he stated at a blues and jazz festival in the town in mid-September 2006. &quot;That's why I came back and that's why I'm staying.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[The Associated Press]]|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-09-11-chappelle-ohio_x.htm|title = Chappelle plans to stay in Ohio town|publisher= [[USA Today]]|date=September 11, 2006|accessdate = 2007-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chappelle converted to [[Islam]] in 1998. He told ''[[Time Magazine]]'' in a May 2005 interview, &quot;I don’t normally talk about my [[religion]] publicly because I don’t want people to associate me and my flaws with this beautiful thing. And I believe it is beautiful if you learn it the right way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Van Agtmael, Peter.
