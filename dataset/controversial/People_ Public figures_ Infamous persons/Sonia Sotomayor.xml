For an English adaptation, see [http://inogolo.com/pronunciation/d1936/Sonia_Sotomayor inogolo: pronunciation of Sonia Sotomayor].&lt;/ref&gt; born June 25, 1954) is an [[Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States|Associate Justice]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], serving since August 2009. Sotomayor is the Court's [[List of Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States|111th justice]], its first [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic]] justice, and its third female justice.

Sotomayor was born in [[The Bronx]], New York City and is of Puerto Rican descent. Her father died when she was nine, and she was subsequently raised by her mother. Sotomayor graduated ''[[summa cum laude]]'' from [[Princeton University]] in 1976 and received her [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from [[Yale Law School]] in 1979, where she was an editor at the ''[[Yale Law Journal]]''. She was an advocate for the hiring of Latino faculty at both schools. She worked as an [[assistant district attorney]] in New York for four and a half years before entering private practice in 1984. She played an active role on the boards of directors for the [[LatinoJustice PRLDEF|Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund]], the [[State of New York Mortgage Agency]], and the [[New York City Campaign Finance Board]].

Sotomayor was nominated to the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York]] by President [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1991, and her nomination was confirmed in 1992. In 1997, she was nominated by President [[Bill Clinton]] to the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]]. Her nomination was slowed by the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] majority in the [[United States Senate]], but she was eventually confirmed in 1998. On the Second Circuit, Sotomayor heard appeals in more than 3,000 cases and wrote about 380 opinions. Sotomayor has taught at the [[New York University School of Law]] and [[Columbia Law School]].

In May 2009, President [[Barack Obama]] [[Sonia Sotomayor Supreme Court nomination|nominated Sotomayor]] to the Supreme Court to replace retired Justice [[David Souter]]. Her nomination was confirmed by the Senate in August 2009 by a vote of 68–31.  On the court, Sotomayor has been a reliable member of the liberal bloc when the justices divide along the commonly perceived ideological lines.

==Early legal career==
On the recommendation of Cabranes, Sotomayor was hired out of law school as an [[assistant district attorney]] under [[New York County]] District Attorney [[Robert Morgenthau]] starting in 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;abc7-052609&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt062109jac&quot;/&gt;  She said at the time that she did so with conflicted emotions: &quot;There was a tremendous amount of pressure from my community, from the third world community, at Yale.

===Judgeship===
Sotomayor generally kept a low public profile as a district court judge.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot; /&gt; She showed a willingness to take anti-government positions in a number of cases, and during her first year in the seat, she received high ratings from liberal public-interest groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKinley&quot;/&gt;  Other sources and organizations regarded her as a centrist during this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hoffman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name =&quot;McKinley&quot;/&gt; In criminal cases, she gained a reputation for tough sentencing and was not viewed as a pro-defense judge.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj060509&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124415867263187033.html | title=Nominee's Criminal Rulings Tilt to Right of Souter | author=Bravin, Jess and Koppel, Nathan |work=The Wall Street Journal | date=June 5, 2009 | accessdate=June 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Syracuse University]] study found that in such cases, Sotomayor generally handed out longer sentences than her colleagues, especially when [[white-collar crime]] was involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2009-07-09-sotomayor_N.htm | title=Study: Sotomayor tough on white-collar criminals | agency=[[Associated Press]] |work=USA Today | date=July 9, 2009 | accessdate=August 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fellow district judge [[Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum]] was an influence on Sotomayor in adopting a narrow, &quot;just the facts&quot; approach to judicial decision-making.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt062109jac&quot;/&gt;

As a trial judge, she garnered a reputation for being well-prepared in advance of a case and moving cases along a tight schedule.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKinley&quot;/&gt;  Lawyers before her court viewed her as plain-spoken, intelligent, demanding, and sometimes somewhat unforgiving; one said, &quot;She does not have much patience for people trying to snow her.

===Notable rulings===
On March 30, 1995, in ''Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc.'',&lt;ref&gt;''Silverman v. Major League Baseball Player Relations Committee, Inc.'', 880 F.

In ''[[New York Times Co. v.

Sotomayor ruled that the publisher had the right to license the freelancer's work. This decision was reversed on appeal, and the Supreme Court upheld the reversal; two dissenters ([[John Paul Stevens]] and [[Stephen Breyer]]) took Sotomayor's position.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn-resume&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/26/sotomayor.resume/?iref=hpmostpop |title=Sotomayor's resume, record on notable cases |publisher=CNN  | date=May 26, 2009 | accessdate=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Castle Rock Entertainment, Inc. v. Carol Publishing Group]]'' (also in 1997), Sotomayor ruled that a book of trivia from the television program ''[[Seinfeld]]'' infringed on the copyright of the show's producer and did not constitute legal [[fair use]]. The [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] upheld Sotomayor's ruling.

In the Court of Appeals seat, Sotomayor gained a reputation for vigorous and blunt behavior toward lawyers appealing before her, sometimes to the point of brusque and curt treatment or testy interruptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-witn-09&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt052809bl&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/29/us/politics/29judge.html | title=Sotomayor's Blunt Style Raises Issue of Temperament | author=Becker, Jo and Liptak, Adam |work=The New York Times | date=May 28, 2009 | accessdate=May 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was known for extensive preparation for oral arguments and for running a &quot;hot bench&quot;, where judges ask lawyers plenty of questions.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt052809bl&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kcs060609&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2009Jun07/0,4670,USSotomayorTemperament,00.html | title=Taking the measure of Sotomayor's courtroom manner | work=Fox News | date=June 6, 2009 | agency=[[Associated Press]] | accessdate=May 30, 2012 | author=Neumeister, Larry}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unprepared lawyers suffered the consequences, but the vigorous questioning was an aid to lawyers seeking to tailor their arguments to the judge's concerns.&lt;ref name=&quot;kcs060609&quot;/&gt;  The 2009 ''Almanac of the Federal Judiciary'', which collected anonymous evaluations of judges by lawyers who appear before them, contained a wide range of reactions to Sotomayor.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-witn-09&quot;/&gt;  Comments also diverged among lawyers willing to be named. Attorney Sheema Chaudhry said, &quot;She's brilliant and she's qualified, but I just feel that she can be very, how do you say, temperamental.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt052809bl&quot;/&gt;  Defense lawyer [[Gerald B.

Wesley]] said that his interactions with Sotomayor had been &quot;totally antithetical to this perception that has gotten some traction that she is somehow confrontational.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt052809bl&quot;/&gt;  Second Circuit Judge and former teacher [[Guido Calabresi]] said his tracking showed that Sotomayor's questioning patterns were no different from other members of the court and added, &quot;Some lawyers just don’t like to be questioned by a woman. [The criticism] was sexist, plain and simple.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt052809bl&quot;/&gt;
Sotomayor's [[law clerk]]s regarded her as a valuable and strong mentor, and she said that she viewed them like family.&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo050709&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/05/06/AR2009050603762.html | title=N.Y.

===Notable rulings===
;Abortion
In the 2002 decision ''[[Center for Reproductive Law and Policy v. Bush]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;crlpvb&quot;&gt;''[[Center for Reproductive Law and Policy v. Bush]]'', [http://openjurist.org/304/f3d/183/center-for-reproductive-law-and-policy-v-w-bush 304 F.3d 183] (2d Cir. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Sotomayor upheld the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]]'s implementation of the [[Mexico City Policy]], which states that &quot;the United States will no longer contribute to separate nongovernmental organizations which perform or actively promote abortion as a method of family planning in other nations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aul.org/2010/04/the-mexico-city-policy/|title=The Mexico City Policy|publisher=[[Americans United for Life]]|accessdate=May 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sotomayor held that the policy did not constitute a violation of [[Equal Protection Clause|equal protection]], as &quot;the government is free to favor the anti-abortion position over the pro-choice position, and can do so with public funds.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;crlpvb&quot;/&gt;

;First Amendment rights
In ''[[Pappas v. Giuliani]]'' (2002),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pappas v. Giuliani]]'', 290 F.3d 143 (2d Cir. 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Sotomayor dissented from her colleagues' ruling that the [[New York Police Department]] could terminate an employee from his desk job who sent racist materials through the mail. Sotomayor argued that the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] protected speech by the employee &quot;away from the office, on [his] own time&quot;, even if that speech was &quot;offensive, hateful, and insulting&quot;, and that therefore the employee's First Amendment claim should have gone to trial rather than being dismissed on summary judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2009_05/018353.php|title=Sotomayor: The Record|last=Benen|first=Steve|date=May 27, 2009|work=[[The Washington Monthly]]|accessdate=June 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Judge Sotomayor wrote the opinion for ''United States v. Quattrone''.&lt;ref name=USvQuattroneOpenJurist&gt;''United States v. Quattrone'', [http://openjurist.org/402/f3d/304/united-states-v-quattrone-abc-lp-lllp-lp 402 F.3d 304] (2d Cir. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; Frank Quattrone had been on trial on charges of obstructing investigations related to technology IPOs. Some members of the media had wanted to publish the names of the jurors deciding Quattrone's case, and a district court had issued an order to forbid the publication of the juror's names. In ''United States v. Quattrone'', Judge Sotomayor wrote the opinion for the Second Circuit panel striking down this order on First Amendment grounds, stating that the media should be free to publish the names of the jurors. The first trial ended in a deadlocked jury and a mistrial, and the district court ordered the media not to publish the names of jurors, even though those names had been disclosed in open court. Judge Sotomayor held that although it was important to protect the fairness of the retrial, the district court's order was an unconstitutional prior restraint on free speech and violated the right of the press to &quot;to report freely on events that transpire in an open courtroom&quot;.&lt;ref name=USvQuattroneOpenJurist /&gt;

In 2008, Sotomayor was on a three-judge panel in ''[[Doninger v. Niehoff]]''&lt;ref name=Doninger&gt;''[[Doninger v. Niehoff]]'', [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/data2/circs/2nd/073885p.pdf Doninger v. Niehoff, 527 F.3d 41] (2d Cir. 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; that unanimously affirmed, in an opinion written by Second Circuit Judge [[Debra Livingston]], the district court's judgment that [[Lewis S. Mills High School]] did not violate the First Amendment rights of a student when it barred her from running for student government after she called the superintendent and other school officials &quot;douchebags&quot; in a blog post written while off-campus that encouraged students to call an administrator and &quot;piss her off more&quot;.&lt;ref name=Doninger /&gt; Judge Livingston held that the district judge did not abuse her discretion in holding that the student's speech &quot;foreseeably create[d] a risk of substantial disruption within the school environment&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;''Doninger v. Niehoff'', p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; which is the precedent in the Second Circuit for when schools may regulate off-campus speech.&lt;ref name=Doninger /&gt;  Although Sotomayor did not write this opinion, she has been criticized by some who disagree with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newbritainherald.com/articles/2009/05/28/news/doc4a1df5e55148d604572983.txt |title=Sotomayor had key role in Doninger case |work=[[New Britain Herald]] |date=May 28, 2009 |author=Collins, Steve }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Second Amendment rights
Sotomayor was part of the three-judge Second Circuit panel that affirmed the district court's ruling in ''[[Maloney v. Cuomo]]'' (2009).&lt;ref name=&quot;maloney-v-cuomo&quot;&gt;''Maloney v. Cuomo'', 554 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  Maloney was arrested for possession of [[nunchucks]], which are illegal in New York; Maloney argued that this law violated his [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] right to bear arms. The Second Circuit's ''[[per curiam]]'' opinion noted that the Supreme Court has not, so far, ever held that the Second Amendment is binding against state governments. On the contrary, in ''[[Presser v.

While Sotomayor agreed that some of the strip searches at issue in the case were lawful, she would have held that due to &quot;the severely intrusive nature of strip searches&quot;,&lt;ref name=NGvConnOpenJurist /&gt; they should not be allowed &quot;in the absence of individualized suspicion, of adolescents who have never been charged with a crime&quot;.&lt;ref name=NGvConnOpenJurist /&gt; She argued that an &quot;individualized suspicion&quot; rule was more consistent with Second Circuit precedent than the majority's rule.&lt;ref name=NGvConnOpenJurist /&gt;

She held that, &quot;Even though [the employee] had some expectation of privacy in the contents of his office computer, the investigatory searches by the DOT did not violate his Fourth Amendment rights&quot;&lt;ref name=LeventhalvKnapekOpenJurist /&gt; because here &quot;there were reasonable grounds to believe&quot; that the search would reveal evidence of &quot;work-related misconduct&quot;.&lt;ref name=LeventhalvKnapekOpenJurist /&gt;

;Alcohol in commerce
In 2004, Sotomayor was part of the judge panel that ruled in ''[[Granholm v. Heald|Swedenburg v. Kelly]]'' that New York's law prohibiting out-of-state wineries from shipping directly to consumers in New York was constitutional even though in-state wineries were allowed to. The case, which invoked the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution|21st Amendment]], was appealed and attached to another case. The case reached the Supreme Court later on as ''Swedenburg v. Kelly'' and was overruled in a 5–4 decision that found the law was discriminatory and unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Daley, Bill |title=Sotomayor and wine: One pro's perspective |url=http://leisureblogs.chicagotribune.com/thestew/2009/05/sotomayor-and-wine-one-pros-perspective.html |work=Chicago Tribune |date=May 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sotomayor was involved in the high-profile case ''[[Ricci v.

(No black firefighters qualified for promotion under the test, whereas some had qualified under tests used in previous years.) The City was concerned that minority firefighters might sue under [[Title VII]] of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. The City chose not to certify the test results and a lower court had previously upheld the City's right to do this. Several white firefighters and one Hispanic firefighter who had passed the test, including the lead plaintiff who has dyslexia and had put much extra effort into studying, sued the City of New Haven, claiming that their rights were violated. A Second Circuit panel that included Sotomayor first issued a brief, unsigned [[summary order]] (not written by Sotomayor) affirming the lower court's ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/06/us/politics/06ricci.html | title=New Scrutiny of Judge's Most Controversial Case | author=Liptak, Adam |work=The New York Times | date=June 5, 2009 | accessdate=July 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sotomayor's former mentor [[José A.

[[Maurice Clarett]] challenged these rules, which were part of the collective bargaining agreement between the NFL and its players, on antitrust grounds. Sotomayor held that Clarett's claim would upset the established &quot;federal labor law favoring and governing the collective bargaining process&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A52299-2004May24.html?nav=rss_sports|title=Judges Rule Against Clarett |last=Maske|first=Mark|date=May 24, 2004|work=The Washington Post |page=D3|accessdate=June 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Civil rights
In ''[[Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko]]'' (2000),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Correctional Services Corp. v. Malesko]]'', 299 F.3d 374 (2d Cir. 2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Sotomayor, writing for the court, supported the right of an individual to sue a private corporation working on behalf of the federal government for alleged violations of that individual's constitutional rights. Reversing a lower court decision, Sotomayor found that an existing Supreme Court doctrine, known as &quot;[[Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents|Bivens]]&quot;—which allows suits against individuals working for the federal government for constitutional rights violations—could be applied to the case of a former prisoner seeking to sue the private company operating the federal halfway house facility in which he resided. The Supreme Court reversed Sotomayor's ruling in a 5–4 decision, saying that the Bivens doctrine could not be expanded to cover private entities working on behalf of the federal government. Justices Stevens, Souter, Ginsburg, and Breyer dissented, siding with Sotomayor's original ruling.

In ''Gant v. Wallingford Board of Education'' (1999),&lt;ref&gt;''Gant v. Wallingford Board of Education'', 195 F.3d 134 (1999).&lt;/ref&gt; the parents of a black student alleged that he had been harassed due to his race and had been discriminated against when he was transferred from a first grade class to a kindergarten class without parental consent, while similarly situated white students were treated differently. Sotomayor agreed with the dismissal of the harassment claims due to lack of evidence, but would have allowed the discrimination claim to go forward. She wrote in dissent that the grade transfer was &quot;contrary to the school's established policies&quot; as well as its treatment of white students, which &quot;supports the inference that race discrimination played a role&quot;.

;Property rights
In ''[[Krimstock v. Kelly]]'' (2002),&lt;ref&gt;''Krimstock v. Kelly'', 306 F.3d 40 (2d Cir. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; Sotomayor wrote an opinion halting New York City's practice of seizing the motor vehicles of drivers accused of driving while intoxicated and some other crimes and holding those vehicles for &quot;months or even years&quot; during criminal proceedings. Noting the importance of cars to many individuals' livelihoods or daily activities, she held that it violated individuals' due process rights to hold the vehicles without permitting the owners to challenge the City's continued possession of their property.

In ''[[Brody v. Village of Port Chester]]'' (2003 and 2005),&lt;ref&gt;''Brody v. Village of Port Chester'', 345 F.3d 103 (2d Cir. 2003) and ''Brody v. Village of Port Chester'', 434 F.3d 121 (2d Cir. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; a takings case, Sotomayor first ruled in 2003 for a unanimous panel that a property owner in [[Port Chester, New York]] was permitted to challenge the state's Eminent Domain Procedure Law. A district court subsequently rejected the plaintiff's claims and upon appeal the case found itself again with the Second Circuit. In 2005, Sotomayor ruled with a panel majority that the property owner's due process rights had been violated by lack of adequate notice to him of his right to challenge a village order that his land should be used for a redevelopment project. However, the panel supported the village's taking of the property for public use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/package/supremecourt/sotomayor-on-the-issues.html?hpid=topnews | title=Sotomayor on the Issues |work=The Washington Post | accessdate=August 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Village of Port Chester, 173 Fed.Appx. 931, 2006 WL 898093 (2d Cir. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; an unrelated case brought about by the same town's actions, Sotomayor joined a unanimous panel's summary order to uphold a trial court's dismissal – due to a statute of limitations lapse – of a property owner's objection to his land being condemned for a redevelopment project. The ruling further said that even without the lapse, the owner's petition would be denied due to application of the Supreme Court's recent ''[[Kelo v. City of New London]]'' ruling. The Second Circuit's reasoning drew criticism from [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] commentators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/05/26/supreme-court-nomination-obama-opinions-columnists-sonia-sotomayor.html |title=The Sotomayor Nomination |work=[[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes]] |date=May 26, 2009 |author=Epstein, Richard A. |authorlink=Richard Allen Epstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://reason.com/blog/show/133709.html |title=Sotomayor on Takings |work=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] |date=May 26, 2009 |author=Balko, Radley}}&lt;/ref&gt;
