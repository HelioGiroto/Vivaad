Love initially gained notoriety in the Los Angeles indie rock scene as the lead vocalist and [[rhythm guitarist]] for alternative rock band [[Hole (band)|Hole]], which she formed in 1989 with [[lead guitar|lead guitarist]] [[Eric Erlandson]]. Their debut album, ''[[Pretty on the Inside]]'' (1991) garnered them critical praise, and they went on to achieve international critical and commercial success for their following albums, ''[[Live Through This]]'' (1994) and ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'' (1998).

Love also had a career in acting, originally landing small roles in [[Alex Cox]] films in the 1980s. In 1996, Love starred in ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'' and was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Motion Picture|Golden Globe]] for her performance. She later had a brief solo music career in the early 2000s after the dissolution of Hole, releasing ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'' (2004), and went through several rehab sentences and run-ins with the law until achieving sobriety. In 2009, Love reformed Hole with new members and released ''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'' (2010). In 2012, she debuted an art exhibit featuring a collection of her own paintings and drawings titled &quot;And She's Not Even Pretty&quot;.

Love was married to [[Kurt Cobain]], frontman of the [[grunge]] band [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], with whom she has a daughter, [[Frances Bean Cobain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20041022-9999-lz1c22love.html|title=Courtney Love is back from the brink and hoping music will be her saving grace|last=Peterson|first=Karla|date=October 22, 2004 |publisher=SignOnSanDiego.com|accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout her career, Love's wild stage antics and subversive feminist attitude have polarized audiences and critics,&lt;ref name=&quot;slut&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://bad.eserver.org/issues/1995/20/nicolini.html|journal=Bad Subjects |title=Staging the Slut: Hyper-Sexuality in Performance |first=Kim |last= Nicolini |work=bad.eserver.org |date=April 1995|issue=20 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=2618266&amp;page=1|work=NBC News|title=Courtney Love's Trip Back From the Bottom|date=October 31, 2006|accessdate=2010-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' once calling her &quot;the most controversial woman in the history of rock.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://music.guardian.co.uk/rock/story/0,,1969245,00.html |title=Love me do Rock &amp;#124; Guardian Unlimited Music |publisher=Music.guardian.co.uk |date= December 11, 2006|accessdate=2009-05-16 | location=London | first=Laura | last=Barton}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RSQuote&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sirota |first1=Peggy |date=November 13, 1997 |title=Women of Rock: Courtney Love |magazine=Rolling Stone |issue=773 |page=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Courtney Michelle Harrison was born in 1964 in San Francisco, California, to [[Linda Carroll]], now a psychotherapist, and Hank Harrison, a publisher who had some association with the [[Grateful Dead]]; consequently, Love was included in a group picture on the back of the band's album ''[[Aoxomoxoa]]'' (1969).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McLeod |first=Kembrew |url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_g1epc/is_bio/ai_2419200753 |title=Courtney Love |work=St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture |year=2002 |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ykLfChaPoRcC&amp;pg=PA197 |title=The 27s: The Greatest Myth of Rock &amp; Roll|author= Eric Segalstad, Josh Hunter |page=197 |publisher=Samadhi Creations|year=2009  |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s5cfYb1l994|network=Vh1|airdate=June 21, 2010|title=Courtney Love|series=Behind the Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love's parents divorced in 1969 and she was placed in the custody of her mother after it was alleged that her father had fed her [[LSD]].&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=uQ2I9cpJWYIC&amp;pg=PA188#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Sexual Trauma: A Challenge Not Insanity  |first=K Elan|last= Jung|pages=188–189 |publisher=The Hudson Press|year=2010 |accessdate=2011-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carroll remarried and moved the family to [[Eugene, Oregon]], giving birth to two more daughters and adopting a son before divorcing and re-marrying once again.
Carroll, in an autobiography, claimed to be the daughter of [[Marlon Brando]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film1.nl/blog/4646-Is-Marlon-Brando-de-opa-van-Courtney-Love.html |title=Is Marlon Brando de opa van Courtney Love? |language={{Nl icon}} |publisher=Film1.nl |date=August 13, 2003 |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;etrue&quot; /&gt; alleging that she had [[DNA profiling|DNA tests]] done to prove it.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-192384/Brando-Courtneys-grandad.html|work=Daily Mail|title=Brando 'is Courtney's grandad'|date=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love's biological grandmother, [[Paula Fox]], had an affair with Brando in the 1940s. 

In 1971, Love relocated with her family to a [[commune]] in [[Marcola, Oregon]], where they lived in what she described as &quot;a teepee&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;poppy&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Love struggled in school and exhibited various signs of emotional and social problems,  later being diagnosed as mildly [[autism|autistic]].&lt;ref name=poppy&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1972, her mother purchased a farm in [[New Zealand]] and moved the family there, but left Love in the United States under the care of her former stepfather and various friends due to her increasingly hostile behavior.&lt;ref name=&quot;etrue&quot; /&gt; 

In 1978, Love was arrested in [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] for shoplifting a t-shirt and was sent to [[Hillcrest Youth Correctional Facility]] in [[Salem, Oregon]],&lt;ref name=&quot;etrue&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hilldoc&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|pages=29–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; spending the following two years in and out of [[juvenile hall]] and numerous foster homes.&lt;ref name=&quot;hilldoc&quot; /&gt; In 1980, Love ran away to Portland where she began working illegally as an [[exotic dancer]],&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;etrue&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marysclub.com/history.php|work=Mary's Club|title=History|accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;poppy&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lovechild&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.vanityfair.com/hollywood/features/1995/06/courtney-love-199506|work=Vanity Fair|title=Love Child|date=June 1995|accessdate=3 May 2012|author=Sessums, Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occasionally as a DJ at nightclubs.&lt;ref name=&quot;superrock&quot;&gt;{{cite interview|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ovgo4h9_lQc|program=MTV|title=Courtney Love: Super Rock Interview|subject=Love, Courtney|year=1995|city=New York City, New York|interviewer=Farry, Jackie}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also took job opportunities working briefly at dance halls in Japan and Taiwan,&lt;ref name=&quot;etrue&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;maer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefix.com/content/courtney-intro?page=1|title=The Courtney Chronicles|work=The Fix|date=May 26, 2011|accessdate=2011-05-27|author=Roshan, Maer}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote two missives under the name &quot;Courtney Michelle&quot; in punk-zine ''[[Maximumrocknroll]]'' on local bands [[Poison Idea]] and Rancid Vat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=Spin|date=July 1998|page=94|title=This Was Hardcore|author=Weisbard, Eric|quote=Courtney Love filed a Portland scene report in Issue 4 as &quot;Courtney Michelle&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nobody likes you: inside the turbulent life, times, and music of Green Day|author=Spitz, Marc|publisher=Hyperion Publishing|page=26|date=November 1, 2006|isbn=978-1-4013-0274-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hole (1989-2002)===
{{Main|Hole (band)}}
[[File:Hole 1991 ad.png|thumb|right|220px|[[Flyer (pamphlet)|Flyer]] made by Courtney Love promoting a Hole show in 1991, Los Angeles]]
In 1989, Love taught herself to play guitar and moved to Los Angeles, where she placed an ad in ''[[Flipside (fanzine)|Flipside]]'', reading: &quot;I want to start a band. My influences are [[Big Black]], [[Sonic Youth]], and [[Fleetwood Mac]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wkkc54&quot;&gt;Who Killed Kurt Cobain?: The Mysterious Death of an Icon (pg. 54)&lt;/ref&gt; to which guitarist [[Eric Erlandson]] replied. Love then bought her neighbor Lisa Roberts a bass guitar, and recruited drummer Caroline Rue at a [[Gwar]] concert. Love named the band Hole.

Hole played their first show in November 1989 at [[Raji's]] after three months of rehearsal, and began making [[single (music)|singles]] on the [[Long Beach, California]], independent label [[Sympathy for the Record Industry]]. Their first single, titled &quot;[[Retard Girl]],&quot; was issued in early 1990. Disc jockey [[Rodney Bingenheimer]] jokingly said that Love would often &quot;stalk him&quot; at a [[Denny's]] restaurant, insisting that he should give &quot;Retard Girl&quot; air time on his station, [[KROQ-FM|KROQ]].&lt;ref name=&quot;etrue&quot; /&gt; One year later, the band debuted their second single, &quot;[[Dicknail]]&quot; through [[Sub Pop Records]].

Influenced by the sounds and style of [[no wave]] and [[noise rock]] bands, Love convinced [[Sonic Youth]] bassist [[Kim Gordon]] to produce Hole's first studio album. The album, titled ''[[Pretty on the Inside]]'', was released in August 1991 on [[Caroline Records]], produced by Gordon and [[Gumball (band)|Gumball]]'s Don Fleming. The album gained a following in the United Kingdom, charting at 59 on the [[UK Albums Chart]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chartstats.com/albuminfo.php?id=10997|work=Chart Stats|title=Hole – Pretty on the Inside|accessdate=2011-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as its lead single, &quot;[[Teenage Whore]]&quot; entering the country's Indie chart at number one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Indie Charts: September 28, 1991|series=[[The Chart Show|The ITV Chart Show]]|network=Channel 4|language=English|date=28 September 1991}} [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FfnOji_bk_M]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pretty on the Inside'' received generally positive critical acclaim,&lt;ref name=&quot;real&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Courtney Love: The Real Story|last=Brite|first=Poppie Z|year=1998|page=117|publisher=Touchstone|isbn=0-684-84800-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was labelled one of the 20 best albums of the year by ''[[Spin Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|work=SPIN|date=December 1991|title=20 Best Albums of the Year|page=122|author=Spencer, Lauren}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band toured the United States and Europe in support of the record.

Hole recorded their second album, ''[[Live Through This]]'', in late 1993 in Atlanta and released it in April 1994, just four days after Love's husband, Kurt Cobain, was found dead of a self-inflicted shotgun wound in their home. The album featured a new lineup, with [[Kristen Pfaff]] on bass and Patty Schemel on drums. In June 1994, Pfaff died of an apparent heroin overdose,&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot; /&gt; and Love recruited bassist [[Melissa Auf der Maur]] for the band's upcoming tour. Throughout the months preceding the tour, Love was rarely seen in public, spending her time in her home or visiting the [[Namgyal Monastery Institute of Buddhist Studies|Namgyal Buddhist Monastery]] in New York.&lt;ref name=&quot;thepoweroflove&quot; /&gt;

Meanwhile, ''Live Through This'' was an immense commercial and critical success, receiving rave reviews from major music periodicals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,301841,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=April 15, 1994|author=Browne, David|title=Live Through This|accessdate=2011-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and going certified [[gold record|gold]]. By April 1995, it went [[platinum record|platinum]]. It went on to be declared one of the best albums of all time by ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine in their ''[[The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time|500 Greatest Albums of All Time]]'' issue in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/500-greatest-albums-of-all-time-20120531/hole-live-through-this-19691231|work=Rolling Stone|title=Live Through This (#466): Rolling Stone's Greatest Albums of all Time|accessdate=2011-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The live performances for Hole's 1994 and 1995 tours became notorious in the media due to Love's fraught emotional state,&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot; /&gt; with Love often altering hurtful song lyrics toward herself, dedicating songs to Cobain and Pfaff, provoking fans, throwing guitars into the audience,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/music/articles/2010/09/09/20100909mtv-vmas-memorable-moments.html?page=4|title=10 most memorable moments of the MTV Video Music Awards – Living through this (1995)|last1=Masley |first1=Ed |last2= |first2= |date=September 9, 2010 |work=[[The Arizona Republic|azcentral.com]] |accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and breaking into screaming fits onstage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beatweek.com/music/musicianinterviews/4499-cypress-hill-the-beatweek-cover-story-interview/|work=Beat Week|title=Cypress Hill: Interview|accessdate=2011-02-28|date=April 20, 2010|author=Anderson, Lance|quote= “Those were really great shows.

People were throwing shot gun shells at her feet. It was a spectacle.” Despite Courtney Love’s outrageous behavior and her smack talk about Cypress Hill early on the tour, B-Real respects Courtney Love as an artist, “Nobody could take that away from her.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the band released a compilation album, ''[[My Body, The Hand Grenade]]'', which featured material from the band's earliest recordings in 1989 up until 1995, and, in September 1998, released their third studio album, ''[[Celebrity Skin]]'', which featured a stark [[power pop]] sound as opposed to the group's earlier punk rock influences. ''Rolling Stone'' called the album &quot;accessible, fiery and intimate—often at the same time [...] a basic guitar record that's anything but basic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=(Posted: Sep 1, 1998) |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/celebrity-skin-19980901|title=James Hunter reviews Celebrity Skin |work=Rolling Stone  |date=September 1, 1998|accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Celebrity Skin'' went on to go multi-platinum, and topped &quot;Best of Year&quot; lists at ''Spin'', the ''Village Voice'', and other periodicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.celebrityhollywoodnews.com/erlandson-also-declared-that-patty/ |title=Erlandson also declared that Patty |publisher=Celebrity Hollywood News |date=October 10, 2008 |accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album garnered the band their first and only No.&amp;nbsp;1 hit single on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart with the title track &quot;[[Celebrity Skin (song)|Celebrity Skin]]&quot;.

During the release and promotion of ''Celebrity Skin'', Love and [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] designed a low-price [[Squier]] brand guitar, called [[Squier Venus|Vista Venus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drownsoda.free.fr/vistavenus.htm |title=Fender Squier Vista Venus |publisher=Drown Soda |accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The instrument featured a shape inspired by Mercury, [[Fender Stratocaster|Stratocaster]], and [[Rickenbacker]]'s solidbodies and had a single-coil and a humbucker pickup. In an early 1999 interview, Love said about the Venus: &quot;I wanted a guitar that sounded really warm and pop, but which required just one box to go dirty (...) And something that could also be your first band guitar. I didn't want it all teched out. I wanted it real simple, with just one pickup switch. Because I think that cultural revolutions are in the hands of guitar players&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/erictribute/gw199.html&amp;date=2009-10-25+21:53:33 |title=Hole Tones: The Secrets Of Celebrity Skin's Smooth Sound |publisher=Guitar World |date=January 1999 |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After touring for ''Celebrity Skin'' finished, Auf der Maur left the band to tour with The Smashing Pumpkins; Hole's touring drummer Samantha Maloney left soon after. Love and Erlandson continued to pursue with the band, and released the single &quot;[[Be A Man]]&quot;— an outtake from the ''Celebrity Skin'' sessions— for the soundtrack of the [[Oliver Stone]] film ''[[Any Given Sunday]]'' (1999). The group became dormant in the following two years, and on May 24, 2002, officially announced their breakup amid continuing litigation with [[Universal Music Group]] over their record contract.

===Solo career (2003-2008)===
[[File:Courtney Love on stage crop.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Love performing in London, England on her 43rd birthday (2007).]]With Hole in disarray, Love began a &quot;punk rock femme [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]]&quot; called Bastard during autumn 2001, enlisting Schemel, [[Veruca Salt (band)|Veruca Salt]] co-frontwoman [[Louise Post]], and bassist Gina Crosley, whom Post recommended. Though a demo was completed, the project never reached fruition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weston |first=Colin |url=http://www.drownedinsound.com/articles/1018 |title=Sort The 'Bastard' Out |publisher=Drownedinsound.com |date=May 4, 2001|accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juicemagazine.com/COREYPARKS.html |title=Corey Parks |publisher=Juicemagazine.com |accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Love began composing an album with [[Linda Perry]]; the record, ''[[America's Sweetheart (album)|America's Sweetheart]]'', was released on [[Virgin Records]] in February 2004, was embraced by critics with mixed reviews. ''Spin'' called it a &quot;jaw-dropping act of artistic will and a fiery, proper follow-up to 1994’s ''Live Through This''&quot; and awarded it eight out of ten stars,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spin.com/reviews/courtney-love-americas-sweetheart-virgin|title=Courtney Love, America's Sweetheart Review|author=Aaron, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Rolling Stone'' suggested that, &quot;for people who enjoy watching celebrities fall apart, ''America's Sweetheart'' should be more fun than an [[The Osbournes|Osbournes]] marathon.&quot; The album sold 86,000 copies in its first three months, with the singles &quot;[[Mono (Courtney Love song)|Mono]]&quot; and &quot;Hold on to Me&quot;, both of which earned competent spots on album charts. 

Love has publicly expressed her regret over the record several times, calling it &quot;a crap record&quot;, reasoning that her drug issues at the time were to blame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/hole/49737|work=NME |location=UK|title=Courtney Love blasts UK music scene and slags off 'America's Sweetheart' during Oxford Union speech|date=February 13, 2010|accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the record was released, Love told Kurt Loder on [[TRL]]: &quot;I cannot exist as a solo artist. It's a joke.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Love, Courtney. Interview with Kurt Loder, 2004. Total Request Live on MTV&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Love started recording what was going to be her second solo album, ''How Dirty Girls Get Clean'',&lt;ref name=&quot;returnclove&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nobodysdaughter&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2007/04/18/courtney-love-is-nobodys-daughter |title=Courtney Love Is 'Nobody's Daughter' |publisher=Spinner.com |date=April 18, 2007|accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; collaborating with again with Perry and Billy Corgan in the writing and recording. Love had written several songs, including an anti-cocaine song titled &quot;Loser Dust&quot;, during her time in rehab in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;readytorock&quot;/&gt; 

Some tracks and demos from the album (initially planned for release in 2008) were leaked on the internet in 2006, and a documentary entitled ''[[The Return of Courtney Love]]'', detailing the making of the album, aired on the British television network in the fall of that year. A rough acoustic version of &quot;Never Go Hungry Again&quot;, recorded during an interview for ''[[The Times]]'' in November, was also released. Incomplete audio clips of the song &quot;[[Samantha (Hole song)|Samantha]]&quot;, originating from an interview with [[NPR]], were also distributed on the internet in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ulaby |first=Neda |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=10189167 |title=Rebuilding Courtney Love, One Song at a Time |publisher=Npr.org |date=May 15, 2007 |accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hole reformation (2009-present)===
[[File:CourtneyLove1045.png|thumb|left|180px|Love performing in Philadelphia, 2010]]
On June 17, 2009, ''[[NME]]'' reported that Hole would be reuniting. Former Hole guitarist Erlandson stated in ''Spin'' magazine that contractually no reunion can take place without his involvement; therefore ''Nobody's Daughter'' would remain Love's solo record, as opposed to a &quot;Hole&quot; record. Love responded to Erlandson's comments in a [[Twitter]] post, claiming &quot;he's out of his mind, Hole is my band, my name, and my Trademark&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;CourtneyLoveUK (verified account) Twitter posting (June 18, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Nobody's Daughter]]'' was released worldwide as a Hole album on April 27, 2010. For the new line-up, Love recruited guitarist [[Micko Larkin]], Shawn Dailey (bass guitar), and Stu Fisher (drums, percussion). ''Nobody's Daughter'' featured a great deal of material written and recorded for Love's aborted solo album, ''How Dirty Girls Get Clean'', including &quot;Pacific Coast Highway&quot;, &quot;Letter to God&quot;, &quot;Samantha&quot;, and &quot;Never Go Hungry&quot;, although they were re-produced with Larkin. The first single from ''Nobody's Daughter'' was &quot;[[Skinny Little Bitch]]&quot;, which was the most added song on alternative rock radio in early March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courtney-love.org/skinny-little-bitch-most-added-song-on-alternative-radio|title=Skinny Little Bitch, most added song on alternative radio|date=March 15, 2010|accessdate=2010-11-04|first=Mel|work=courtney-love.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hole performed on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' and ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]''. 

In an interview with Love, she stated that she remained [[celibacy|celibate]] for nearly five years in the process of working on the album: &quot;I needed to put all of my energy into this record. Like, all of it, and [sex and love] can be really distracting&quot;, she said.&lt;ref name=&quot;fuseotr&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The album received mixed reviews. ''Rolling Stone'' gave the album three out of five stars, saying that Love &quot;worked hard on these songs, instead of just babbling a bunch of druggy bullshit and assuming people would buy it, the way she did on her 2004 flop, ''America's Sweetheart''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/nobodys-daughter-20100426|author=Sheffield, Robert|title=Nobody's Daughter by Hole|work=Rolling Stone|date=April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Slant Magazine'' also gave the album three out of five stars, saying &quot;It's [[Marianne Faithfull]]'s substance-ravaged voice that comes to mind most often while listening to songs like &quot;Honey&quot; and &quot;For Once in Your Life.&quot; The latter track is, in fact, one of Love's most raw and vulnerable vocal performances to date. Co-penned by Linda Perry, the song offers a rare glimpse into the mind of a woman who, for the last 15 years, has been as famous for being a rock star as she's been for being a victim.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slantmagazine.com/music/review/hole-nobodys-daughter/2083|work=Slant|date=April 21, 2010|author=Cinquemani, Sal|title=Hole: Nobody's Daughter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album's subject matter was largely centered on Love's tumultuous life between 2003 and 2007, and featured a polished folk-rock sound with much more acoustic work than previous Hole albums. Love toured Europe, Japan, and the United States promoting the album in the spring and summer of 2010, ending the tour at Seattle's [[Bumbershoot]] festival in September. In the summer of 2011, the band played at several festivals in Russia, and toured in Australia and Brazil in early 2012.

In October 2012, Love told ''Rolling Stone'' that she was returning to a solo career and had just recorded a single, titled &quot;This Is War&quot;, which was produced by [[James Iha]]. She also saId she was looking to release the song in February 2013: &quot;I'd put it out right now because it's a two-minute, 59-second song and it's sick, slamming, great&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/stevie-nicks-headlines-elton-johns-aids-foundation-gala-in-new-york-20121016|work=Rolling Stone|title=Stevie Nicks Headlines Elton John's AIDS Foundation Gala in New York|author=Horowitz, Steven J.|date=2012-10-16|accessdate=2012-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acting career==
Love worked with director [[Alex Cox]] on her first two films; she gained a small part in the [[Sid Vicious]] biopic ''[[Sid and Nancy]]'' (1986), and was then given the leading role in his following film, ''[[Straight to Hell (film)|Straight to Hell]]'' (1987),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=La0S3EZ0uysC&amp;pg=PA187#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=A-Z of cult films and film-makers |first=Steven Paul  |last=Davies  |page=187 |publisher=Batsford|year= 2003 |accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; which caught the attention of artist [[Andy Warhol]]. That year, Love appeared in an episode of ''[[Andy Warhol's Fifteen Minutes]]'' with [[Robbie Nevil]] in a segment titled &quot;C'est la Vie&quot;, in which she is dressed in vintage clothes and discussed &quot;[[bag lady|bag ladies]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTm0oIAszdQ |title=Courtney on Andy Warhol's 15 Minutes presented by Debbie Harry |publisher=YouTube |year=1987 |accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warholstars.org/warhol/warhol1/andy/warhol/film/tv.html|work=Warhol Stars|title=Andy Warhol's TV and Fifteen Minutes|accessdate=2011-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also had a part in the 1988 [[Ramones]] music video for &quot;[[I Wanna Be Sedated]]&quot;, appearing as a bride among dozens of party guests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhino.com/video-ramones-i-wanna-be-sedated|Rhino.com|title=Video: I Wanna Be Sedated by The Ramones|accessdate=2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Girl Culture: An Encyclopedia, Volume 1|author=Mitchell, Claudia; Jacqueline Reid-Walsh|page=409|publisher=Greenwood Publishing|isbn=978-0-313-33909-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Love abandoned her career as an actress to pursue music.

In 1996, Love began obtaining small acting parts again  in ''[[Basquiat (film)|Basquiat]]'' and ''[[Feeling Minnesota]]'' (1996), before landing the co-starring role of [[Larry Flynt]]'s wife, Althea, in [[Miloš Forman]]'s 1996 film ''[[The People vs. Larry Flynt]]'', against [[Columbia Pictures]]' reluctance due to her low profile and &quot;troubled&quot; past.&lt;ref name=&quot;ic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.industrycentral.net/director_interviews/MIFO01.HTM|work=Industry Cental|title=Milos Forman (The People vs Larry Flynt)|accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love received critical acclaim, a [[Golden Globe]] nomination for Best Actress, and a [[New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Supporting Actress]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/people_vs_larry_flynt/ |title=The People Vs.

Other roles include: starring opposite [[Jim Carrey]] in the [[Andy Kaufman]] biopic ''[[Man on the Moon (film)|Man on the Moon]]'' (1999); as [[Joan Vollmer]] in ''[[Beat (film)|Beat]]'' (2000) alongside [[Kiefer Sutherland]]; and a leading role in ''[[Julie Johnson]]'' (2001) as [[Lili Taylor]]'s lesbian lover, for which she won an Outstanding Actress award at L.A.'s [[Outfest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.outfest.org/winners/film.comp.01.html |title=Outfest  |work=outfest.org |year=2011 [last update] |accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; She followed with another leading part in the thriller film ''[[Trapped (2002 film)|Trapped]]'' (2002), alongside [[Kevin Bacon]] and [[Charlize Theron]].

==Other projects==
[[File:CLTR.jpg|thumb|Courtney Love with [[Terry Richardson]] during New York Fashion Week 2011]]
In 2004, Love collaborated with illustrators Misaho Kujiradou and [[Ai Yazawa]] to create a [[manga]] comic, ''[[Princess Ai]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2004-07-14-princess-ai_x.htm |title=USATODAY.com – Courtney Love: Cartoon character |first=Kathy  |last=Balog|work=USA Today |date=July 15, 2004  |publisher=[[Gannett Company|Gannett]] |location=McLean, VA |issn=0734-7456 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story is based in part on Love's life, and involves the main character's search for her place in the world; it was written by [[Stu Levy]] under the name D.J.

Although Love said she would &quot;never write a book&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;dirtyblonde&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|page=I}}&lt;/ref&gt; she did publish a memoir in 2006 titled ''[[Dirty Blonde: The Diaries of Courtney Love]]''. The memoir was diary entries, poems, letters, drawings, personal photos, and lyric compositions spanning from Love's childhood up until the year 2006, shortly after her release from a six-month rehab sentence.  The book was generally well-reviewed by critics,&lt;ref&gt;''The Stranger'', ''Salon'', ''Playboy'', ''New York Times'', and ''Venus Zine'' all gave the book positive reviews, as exhibited on the back cover artwork.&lt;/ref&gt; and Love did book readings in promotion for it.

Love has also expressed interest in fashion, having modeled for [[Versace]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1998/04/06/1998_04_06_049_TNY_LIBRY_000015291|work=New Yorker|title=Versace advertising spread featuring Courtney Love|author=Avedon, Richard|date=1998-04-06|accessdate=2012-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Givenchy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.harpersbazaar.com/bazaar-blog/givenchy-courtney-love-audrey-hepburn-020711|work=Harper's Bazaar|title=Remember This Mondays: Givenchy with Courtney Love and Audrey Hepburn|date=2011-02-07|accessdate=2012-09-16|author=Blasberg, Derek}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has also frequented numerous fashion shows over the years. In October 2010, Love and Michael Mouris created an animated short film detailing Love's &quot;kooky&quot; fashion sense, titled ''The Dark Night of the Soul''. Love also started a fashion blog in 2010, titled &quot;What Courtney Wore Today&quot;.

In May 2012, Love debuted an art show at Fred Torres Collaborations in New York titled &quot;''And She's Not Even Pretty''&quot;, which contained over forty drawings and paintings by Love composed in ink, colored pencil, pastels, and watercolors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vogue.com/vogue-daily/article/and-shes-not-even-pretty-courtney-loves-autobiographical-art-show-opens-tomorrow/|work=Vogue|title=&quot;And She's Not Even Pretty&quot;; Courtney Love's Autobiographical Art Show Opens Tomorrow|date=1 May 2012|accessdate=10 June 2012|author=Yaeger, Lynn}}&lt;/ref&gt; The works feature various women in different emotional states, some accompanied by poems and song lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/arts/culture/la-et-cm-courtney-love-20120429,0,7941399.story|title=Courtney Love attempts her first gallery show|work=Los Angeles Times|author=Ng, David|date=30 April 2012|accessdate=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Love's varying genre interests were illustrated in a 1991 interview, in which she stated: &quot;There's a part of me that wants to have a [[grindcore]] band and another that wants to have a [[Raspberries (band)|Raspberries]]-type pop band.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;first&quot; /&gt; Over the course of Hole's career, the band experimented with several different styles, from punk to noise rock as well as more mellow alternative rock, power pop, and folk techniques.

In a 1995 interview with [[Kurt Loder]], Love divulged that in the late 1980s, guitarist [[Joe Strummer]] of [[The Clash]] told her that she was &quot;the worst guitar player he'd ever heard&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;loder&quot;&gt;{{cite interview |last=Love|first=Courtney|interviewer=Loder, Kurt|program=MTV Networks|title=The Hole Story|date= September 1, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; but she insisted she had improved by the early 1990s: &quot;I'm fine... I have my style... and, you know what's funny, is most of the songs [from ''Pretty on the Inside''] are complete [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] rip-offs.&quot; During the same interview, Love said she was greatly influenced by guitarists [[Will Sergeant]] of Echo and the Bunnymen and [[Johnny Marr]] of The Smiths.&lt;ref name=&quot;loder&quot; /&gt;

===Writing style===
Love's song lyrics are predominantly told from a female's point of view, and her earlier work, particularly on Hole's first two albums, was noted for being highly aggressive and critical toward cultural definitions of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/3/2/9/6/4/p329640_index.html|work=National Communication Association|author=Morris, Matthew|date=November 11, 2009|accessdate=2010-11-15|title=Writing (Courtney) Love into the History of Rhetoric: Articulation of a Feminist Consciousness in Live Through This}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common themes and references present in Love's lyrics from her early career included body image, rape, suicide, [[misogyny]], conformity, [[elitism]], pregnancy, prostitution, and death. According to Love, her main focus in the band from very early on was on lyrics: &quot;For me, I was just about lyrics and performance. I didn't really care about [[hook (music)|hooks]] or finesse.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;npa&quot;/&gt;

Her later work was more introspective in its lyrics as opposed to aggressive; Hole's ''Celebrity Skin'' and Love's solo album, ''America's Sweetheart'', focused more on celebrity life, Hollywood, and drug addiction, while also carrying on past themes of vanity and body image, and ''Nobody's Daughter'' was lyrically reflective of Love's past relationships and her struggle to sobriety, with the majority of its lyrics having been written while Love was in rehab in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/hole-nobodys-daughter,40501/|work=The A.V. Club|title=Hole: Nobody's Daughter|author=Heller, Jason|date=April 27, 2010|accessdate=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hole's sound changed over the course of the band's career, the pretty/ugly dynamic has often been noted as a consistent theme in Love's music, most prominently in Hole's first two studio albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;oct91&quot;&gt;{{cite article|work=Spin|date=October 1991|title=Hole Lotta Love|page=32|author=Von Furth, Daisy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with the extremes between beauty and ugliness, Love's musical style has also been remarked for its layering of harsh and abrasive riffs which often bury more sophisticated musical arrangements.&lt;ref name=&quot;oct91&quot; /&gt;

===Live performances===
[[File:Courtney Love Atlanta 1994.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Love performing with Hole in 1994, adorned in &quot;[[kinderwhore]]&quot; attire with smeared makeup and a dress.]]
Over the years Love gained considerable notoriety for her unpredictable live performances, distinguished by subversive, confrontational behavior and verbose interaction with the audience.&lt;ref name=&quot;npa&quot;&gt;Interview with Hole on ''Nulle Part Ailleur'' in Paris, France. 21 June 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pattydoc&quot;&gt;{{cite video|title=Hit So Hard: The Life and Near Death of Patty Schemel|year=2011|medium=Motion picture|format=DVD|publisher=Well Go USA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hatefest&quot;&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,298095,00.html|work=Entertainment Weekly|title=Love's Hate Fest|date=28 July 1995|accessdate=15 September 2012|author=Smith, Ethan}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-'90s, Love was known to [[stage dive]] frequently, wearing dresses and [[slip (clothing)|slips]] which would often be torn off of her by the crowd, and resulted in her losing teeth and sustaining other injuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;walters&quot;&gt;{{cite interview|last=Walters|first=Barbara|interviewer=Courtney Love|program=The Barbara Walters Special|callsign=ABC|date=August 1995|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Love's fraught state during Hole's 1994 and 1995 tours drew significant media attention from [[MTV]] and other music outlets due to her erratic behavior, which included throwing instruments and equipment, breaking into screaming fits, and provocation both to and from audiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/thingstodo/music/articles/2010/09/09/20100909mtv-vmas-memorable-moments.html?page=4|title=10 Most Memorable Moments of the MTV Music Video Awards|author=Masley, Ed|work=The Arizona Republic|accessdate=July 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During sets, it was not unusual for Love to go on monologist rants between songs, or to bring fans onstage and give impromptu guitar lessons.&lt;ref name=&quot;pattydoc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;loderfiles&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; On the opening date of [[Lollapalooza]] in 1995, Love notoriously got into a physical fight backstage with [[Kathleen Hanna]] and punched her in the face.&lt;ref name=hatefest&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In retrospect of those tours, Love said: &quot;I was completely high on dope, I cannot remember much about it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pattydoc&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book ''Rockin' out of the Box: Gender Maneuvering in Alternative Hard Rock'', one instance of Love's [[subversion|culturally subversive]] stage antics was noted at a 1995 concert:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[A man in the audience] yelled, &quot;Fucking bitch! Go home!&quot;
:[Love responded] &quot;Okay, yeah. That's nice. When I say ''three'' I want you to scream ''bitch'' as loud as you can. One—two—three—&quot;
:The audience took great pleasure in screaming, &quot;BITCH!&quot;
:&quot;Nice, very good. Again, one—two—three—&quot; 
:&quot;BITCH!&quot;
:&quot;Okay, now on the count of three, I want you all to yell ''[[nigger]]''. One—two—three—&quot;
:The audience was silent. People [...] were visibly uncomfortable and appeared to be confused, saying things like &quot;What the fuck, man?&quot; 
:Love proceeded, &quot;How 'bout ''[[kike]]''? Wouldn't you guys just love to be able to scream ''kike'' at the top of your lungs? One—two—three—&quot; 
:Again, the audience was quiet. With that, Love sort of whispered, &quot;Fucking idiots,&quot; and launched the band into its next song.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Rockin' out of the Box: Gender Maneuvering in Alternative Hard Rock|author=Schippers, Mimi A.|publisher=Rutgers University Press|date=2002|isbn= 978-0813530758
 |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Love's aesthetic image, particularly in the 1990s, was a large part of her live performances. Her attire often consisted of &quot;thrift shop&quot; [[babydoll|babydoll dresses]], and her face adorned with smeared makeup;&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Spree: A Cultural History of Shopping|author=Klaffke, Pamela|date=2003|publisher=Arsenal Pulp Press|isbn=978-1551521435|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spinner.com/2010/01/22/courtney-love-nobodys-daughter/|work=Spinner|date-22 January 2010|title=Courtney Love Is Learning to Rein In the 'Courtney Monster'|author=Baltin, Steve|accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; MTV reporter Kurt Loder described  her as looking like &quot;a debauched rag doll&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;loderfiles&quot;&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1585956/courtney-love-opens-up-about-kurt-cobains-death-loder-files.jhtml|work=MTV|title=Courtney Love Opens Up About Kurt Cobain's Death (The Loder Files)|date=22 April 2008|accessdate=15 September 2012|author=Loder, Kurt}}&lt;/ref&gt; The style, widely popularized by Love, was dubbed the title &quot;[[kinderwhore]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Courtney Love successfully introduced the kinderwhore look: filmy Victorian nightgowns with fright-wig doll hair and heavy makeup.&quot;  Cintra Wilson.

Love has struggled with substance abuse problems for a great deal of her life. She experimented with various opiates in her early adult years, and tried [[cocaine]] at age 19.&lt;ref name=&quot;maer&quot; /&gt; In 1992, ''Vanity Fair'' published an article by journalist Lynn Hirschberg which alluded that Love was addicted to [[heroin]] during her pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;Love, Courtney. MTV Interview, 1994: &quot;If you read Vanity Fair, you probably think I swig Jack Daniel's first thing in the morning, after I smoke my crack and don't see my daughter for ten days.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Love claimed she was misquoted, and asserted that she immediately quit using the drug during her [[Pregnancy#First_trimester|first trimester]] after she discovered she was pregnant.&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|work=Elle Magazine UK|title=Truly Madly Courtney: Up All Night With Rock's Coolest Blonde|date=January 2009|author=Thoman, Sasa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the publication of the article led to a lengthy battle with the Los Angeles County Court in which custody of newborn Frances was taken away from Love and Cobain and placed with Love's sister, Jamie, for several months.&lt;ref name=&quot;vh1&quot; /&gt;

After Cobain committed suicide in 1994, Love began using heroin again regularly, but quit using the drug in 1996 at the insistence of director Miloš Forman when she landed a starring role in ''The People vs. Larry Flynt''. Love was ordered urine tests under the supervision of Columbia Pictures while filming the movie, and passed all of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;ic&quot; /&gt;

Love has lived in several cities throughout her life; in the 1980s, she mainly resided in [[Portland, Oregon]] and [[Los Angeles]], and lived in [[Seattle]] between 1993 and 1995 during her marriage to Cobain. She was mainly based in Los Angeles until the mid-2000s, and has largely resided in [[New York City]] since 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2114260/Courtney-Love-moves-new-Manhattan-apartment-legal-battle-ex-landlord.html|work=Daily Mail|title=Courtney Love moves into new Manhattan apartment after legal battle with ex-landlord|author=Sheridan, Emily|date=2012-03-13|accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love has also stated in interviews that she never learned how to [[driving|drive a car]]: &quot;I lived in L.A. for twenty years not knowing how to drive... that will get ya.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Love, Courtney.

===Relationships===
When Love was 17, she began an on-and-off relationship with [[Rozz Rezabek]] of the band [[Theatre of Sheep]] after the two met  at [[Dante's|The Metropolis]] in Portland, Oregon, where Love occasionally worked as a [[disc jockey|DJ]].&lt;ref name=&quot;poppy&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The two bonded over [[barbiturate]] use and eventually stopped seeing one another. Love was briefly married to James Moreland (vocalist of [[The Leaving Trains]]) in 1989 for several months, but has said that Moreland was a [[transvestite]] and that their marriage was &quot;a joke&quot;, ending in an annulment filed by Love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyrock.com/features/courtneylove.htm|work=NY Rock|title=Courtney Love: The Life of Love|author=Apter, Jeff|accessdate=2011-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recordssitereviews.com/divorcerecords/courtney-love-james-moreldivorce.html|work=Public Records Site|title=The Courtney Love and James Moreland Divorce|accessdate=2011-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amg&gt;Bush, John.

Once labelled by ''Rolling Stone'' as &quot;the most controversial woman in the history of rock&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=RSQuote /&gt; Love's sometimes outrageous behavior has given her a lasting place in pop culture, as well as a polarizing reputation in the media.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimesblog&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2010/04/live-review-hole-at-the-henry-fonda-theater.html|work=Los Angeles Times|title=Live Review: Hole at the Music Box|date=April 23, 2010|author=Brown, August|accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1996 ''[[New York Magazine]]'' piece on women in rock music, it was noted that Love &quot;had the ambition most people would associate with a male rock star... one thing you have to admire her for is that she refuses— just refuses— to be overlooked in any way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=New York Magazine|date=June 3, 1996|title=Feminism Amplified|pages=34–39|author=France, Kim}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1994 interview, [[Pamela Des Barres]] likened Love to &quot;[[Iggy Pop]] in a shredded antique wedding dress,&quot; or &quot;a female [[Lou Reed]] who screams like [[Exene]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;desbarres&quot;&gt;

Cross|Charles Cross]] said of her, &quot;[Her work] is not always great art, but it's always interesting art. She is certainly capable of taking her clothes off, crowdsurfing, grabbing some kid and pulling them onstage— and rarely does it seem like artifice.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;etrue&quot;/&gt;

Love has been cited as a gay icon by several [[LGBT]] publications, such as ''[[The Advocate]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;CLADV&quot;&gt;{{cite article|work=The Advocate|date=August 17, 1997|title=Evens that shaped the under-30 mind|author=Romseburg, Don; Finlay, Jennifer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Love's devoted gay fanbase was later written about in a [http://www.nypress.com/article-21137-unconditional-love.html New York Press article] in 2010,&lt;ref name=&quot;UL&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nypress.com/article-21137-unconditional-love.html|work=New York Press|title=Unconditional Love|author=Russell, John|date=April 21, 2010|accessdate=2010-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which said {{quote|Of course, it’s never been easy to be a Courtney Love fan. Even when she was at the top of her game there was always some kind of controversy, some reason to write her off as either a sell-out or a nut job, or both. And people don’t exactly take you seriously when you say that you love Courtney Love. Rock snobs—straight guys in particular—tend to turn their noses up at you... [gay men] adopted Courtney as their patron saint while others knelt at the altar of [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]. And while riot grrrl culture may have long ago disowned her, Love’s queer fanbase doggedly sticks by her.&lt;ref name=&quot;UL&quot; /&gt;}}

In 2004, ''Spin'' magazine ranked Love No.&amp;nbsp;18 in their list of &quot;The 50 Greatest Rock Frontmen Of All Time&quot;, calling her &quot;a great band leader because onstage or off, she always makes sure we're paying attention&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|work=Spin|date=2004|title=The 50 Greatest Rock Frontmen Of All Time|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2002, Love ranked at No.&amp;nbsp;14 in ''Q Magazine'''s list of &quot;100 Women Who Rock the World&quot;. [[The Biography Channel]] called Love &quot;outspoken, brash, and sometimes out of control&quot;, and &quot;one of alternative rock's most fascinating figures&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/articles/Courtney-Love-9542145|work=A&amp;E Networks|title=Courtney Love Biography: Biography.com|accessdate=2011-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
