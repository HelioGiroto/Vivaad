'''Saddam Hussein Abd al-Majid al-Tikriti''' ([[Arabic alphabet|Arabic]]: {{lang|ar|صدام حسين عبد المجيد التكريتي}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|Ṣaddām Ḥusayn ʿAbd al-Maǧīd al-Tikrītī}}'';&lt;ref name=&quot;ref1&quot;&gt;''[[Saddam (name)|Saddam]]'', pronounced {{IPA-ar|sˤɑdˈdæːm|}}, is his personal name, and means ''the stubborn one'' or ''he who confronts'' in Arabic (in Iraq also a term for a car's bumper). ''Hussein'' (Sometimes also transliterated as '''''Hussayn''''' or '''''Hussain''''') is not a surname in the Western sense, but a [[patronymic]], his father's given personal name; ''Abid al-Majid'' his grandfather's; ''al-Tikriti'' means he was born and raised in (or near) [[Tikrit]]. He was commonly referred to as ''Saddam Hussein'', or ''Saddam'' for short. The observation that referring to the deposed Iraqi president as only ''Saddam'' is derogatory or inappropriate may be based on the assumption that Hussein is a family name: thus, the ''[[New York Times]]'' refers to him as &quot;Mr. Hussein&quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/02/international/middleeast/02IRAQ.html?8br], while [[Encyclopædia Britannica]] uses just ''Saddam'' [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article?eu=42559]. A full discussion can be found [http://www.cbc.ca/news/indepth/words/saddam_hussein.html] (Blair Shewchuk, [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC News Online]]).&lt;/ref&gt; 28 April 1937&lt;ref name=&quot;ref2&quot;&gt;Under his government, this date was his official date of birth. His real date of birth was never recorded, but it is believed to be a date between 1935 and 1939.

As vice president under the ailing General [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]], and at a time when many groups were considered capable of overthrowing the government, Saddam created security forces through which he tightly controlled conflict between the government and the armed forces. In the early 1970s, Saddam nationalized [[Iraq Petroleum Company|oil]] and other industries. The state-owned banks were put under his control, leaving the system eventually insolvent mostly due to the [[Iran–Iraq War]], the [[Persian Gulf War]], and [[Iraq sanctions|UN sanctions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;economist2004&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/2792407?story_id=2792407 |title=Banking in Iraq&amp;nbsp;— A tricky operation |date=24 June 2004 |work=The Economist }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the 1970s, Saddam cemented his authority over the apparatuses of government as oil money helped Iraq's economy to grow at a rapid pace.{{CN|date=July 2012}} Positions of power in the country were filled with [[Sunni Muslim|Sunnis]], a minority that made up only a fifth of the population.

Saddam formally rose to power in 1979, though he had been the de facto head of Iraq for several years prior (see [[#section Succession|Succession]]). He suppressed several movements, particularly [[Shia Islam|Shi'a]] and [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] movements seeking to overthrow the government or gain independence, respectively&lt;ref&gt;{{cite document

|accessdate=15 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and maintained power during the [[Iran–Iraq War]] of 1980 through 1988. In 1990 he ordered the invasion and looting of [[Kuwait]]. An international coalition came to free Kuwait in the [[Gulf War]] of 1991, but did not end Saddam's rule. Whereas some venerated him for his aggressive stance against [[Israel]], including firing missiles at Israeli targets,&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News]], 16 October 2000 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/974987.stm]&lt;/ref&gt; he was widely condemned for the brutality of his dictatorship.

In March 2003, a coalition of countries led by the U.S. and U.K. [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invaded Iraq]] to depose Saddam, after [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] and [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] accused him of possessing [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] and having [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations|ties to al-Qaeda]]. Saddam's Ba'ath party was disbanded and the nation made a transition to a democratic system. Following [[Operation Red Dawn|his capture]] on 13 December 2003, the [[Trial of Saddam Hussein|trial of Saddam]] took place under the [[Iraqi Interim Government|Iraqi interim government]]. On 5 November 2006, Saddam was convicted of charges related to the 1982 killing of 148 Iraqi [[Shi'ite]]s and was sentenced to death by [[hanging]]. [[execution of Saddam Hussein|His execution]] was carried out on 30 December 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCexecution&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6218485.stm |publisher=BBC News  |title=Saddam Hussein executed in Iraq |date=30 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Youth==
'''Saddam Hussein''' Abd al-Majid al-Tikriti was born in the town of [[Al-Awja]], 13&amp;nbsp;km (8&amp;nbsp;mi) from the Iraqi town of [[Tikrit]], to a family of shepherds from the [[al-Begat]] tribal group, a sub-group of the [[Al-Bu Nasir]] (البو ناصر) tribe. His mother, Subha Tulfah al-Mussallat, named her newborn son ''[[Saddam (name)|Saddam]]'', which in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] means &quot;One who confronts&quot;; he is always referred to by this [[Arabic name|personal name]], which may be followed by the patronymic and other elements. He never knew his father, Hussein 'Abid al-Majid, who disappeared six months before Saddam was born. Shortly afterward, Saddam's 13-year-old brother died of cancer. The infant Saddam was sent to the family of his maternal uncle [[Khairallah Talfah]] until he was three.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref5&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://hnn.us/roundup/entries/5225.html | title=Was a Tyrant Prefigured by Baby Saddam? |work=The New York Times | author=Elisabeth Bumiller | date=15 May 2004 | accessdate=2 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His mother remarried, and Saddam gained three half-brothers through this marriage. His stepfather, Ibrahim al-Hassan, treated Saddam harshly after his return. At about age 10, Saddam fled the family and returned to live in [[Baghdad]] with his uncle Kharaillah Tulfah. Tulfah, the father of Saddam's future wife, was a devout [[Sunni]] Muslim and a veteran from the 1941 [[Anglo-Iraqi War]] between [[Iraqi nationalism|Iraqi nationalists]] and the United Kingdom, which remained a major colonial power in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Davis, ''Memories of State: Politics, History, and Collective Identity in Modern Iraq'', [[University of California Press]], 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later in his life relatives from his native Tikrit became some of his closest advisors and supporters. Under the guidance of his uncle he attended a nationalistic high school in Baghdad. After secondary school Saddam studied at an Iraqi law school for three years, dropping out in 1957 at the age of 20 to join the revolutionary pan-Arab Ba'ath Party, of which his uncle was a supporter. During this time, Saddam apparently supported himself as a secondary school teacher.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref6&quot;&gt;

[[Image:SaddamCairo.jpg|thumb|250px|Saddam Hussein and the [[Ba'ath Party]] student cell, [[Cairo]], in the period 1959–1963]]
Revolutionary sentiment was characteristic of the era in Iraq and throughout the Middle East. In Iraq [[progressivism|progressive]]s and socialists assailed traditional political elites (colonial era bureaucrats and landowners, wealthy merchants and tribal chiefs, monarchists).&lt;ref&gt;R. Stephen Humphreys, ''Between Memory and Desire: The Middle East in a Troubled Age'', University of California Press, 1999, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the pan-Arab nationalism of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] in Egypt profoundly influenced young Ba'athists like Saddam. The rise of Nasser foreshadowed a wave of revolutions throughout the Middle East in the 1950s and 1960s, with the collapse of the monarchies of Iraq, [[Egypt]], and [[Libya]]. Nasser inspired nationalists throughout the Middle East by fighting the British and the French during the [[Suez Crisis|Suez Crisis of 1956]], modernizing Egypt, and uniting the [[Arab world]] politically.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, 68&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, a year after Saddam had joined the Ba'ath party, army officers led by General [[Abd al-Karim Qasim]] overthrew [[Faisal II of Iraq]] in the [[14 July Revolution]].

==Rise to power==
{{Ba'athism sidebar}}
Of the 16 members of Qasim's cabinet, 12 were Ba'ath Party members; however, the party turned against Qasim due to his refusal to join [[Gamel Abdel Nasser]]'s United Arab Republic.&lt;ref name=&quot;iraqfirst&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Con Coughlin|Coughlin, Con]] |  pages = 24–25 | title = Saddam: His Rise and Fall | location = | publisher = [[Harper Perennial]] | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-06-050543-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To strengthen his own position within the government, Qasim created an alliance with the [[Iraqi Communist Party]], which was opposed to any notion of pan-Arabism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Con Coughlin|Coughlin, Con]] |  pages = 25–26 | title = Saddam: His Rise and Fall | location = | publisher = [[Harper Perennial]] | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-06-050543-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later that year, the Ba'ath Party leadership was planning to assassinate Qasim.  Saddam was a leading member of the operation. At the time, the Ba'ath Party was more of an ideological experiment than a strong anti-government fighting machine.  The majority of its members were either educated professionals or students, and Saddam fit the bill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Con Coughlin|Coughlin, Con]] |  page = 26 | title = Saddam: His Rise and Fall | location = | publisher = [[Harper Perennial]] | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-06-050543-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The choice of Saddam was, according to historian [[Con Coughlin]], &quot;hardly surprising&quot;.  The idea of assassinating Qasim may have been Nasser's, and there is speculation that some of those who participated in the operation received training in [[Damascus]], which was then part of the UAR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Con Coughlin|Coughlin, Con]] |  page = 27 | title = Saddam: His Rise and Fall | location = | publisher = [[Harper Perennial]] | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-06-050543-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The assassins planned to ambush Qasim at Al-Rashid Street on 7 October 1959: one man was to kill those sitting at the back of  the car, the rest killing those in front. During the ambush it is claimed that Saddam began shooting prematurely, which disorganised the whole operation. Qasim's chauffeur was killed, and Qasim was hit in the arm and shoulder. The assassins believed they had killed him and quickly retreated to their headquarters, but Qasim survived.  At the time of the attack the Ba'ath Party had less than 1,000 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Con Coughlin|Coughlin, Con]] |  page = 30 | title = Saddam: His Rise and Fall | location = | publisher = [[Harper Perennial]] | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-06-050543-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the plotters quickly managed to leave the country for [[Syria]], the spiritual home of [[Ba'athism|Ba'athist ideology]]. There Saddam was given full-membership in the party by [[Michel Aflaq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Con Coughlin|Coughlin, Con]] |  page = 33 | title = Saddam: His Rise and Fall | location = | publisher = [[Harper Perennial]] | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-06-050543-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the operation were arrested and taken into [[custody]] by the Iraqi government. At the [[show trial]], six of the defendants were given the [[death sentence]]; for unknown reasons the sentences were not carried out.  Aflaq, the leader of the Ba'athist movement, organised the expulsion of leading Iraqi Ba'athist members, such as [[Fuad al-Rikabi]], on the grounds that the party should not have initiated the attempt on Qasim's life. At the same time, Aflaq managed to secure seats in the Iraqi Ba'ath leadership for his supporters, one them being Saddam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Con Coughlin|Coughlin, Con]] |  page = 34 | title = Saddam: His Rise and Fall | location = | publisher = [[Harper Perennial]] | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-06-050543-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Saddam fled to [[Egypt]] in 1959, and he continued to live there until 1963.

Many foreign countries opposed Qasim, particularly after he threatened to invade [[Kuwait]].  In February 1960, the [[CIA]] created an unrelated plan to oust Qasim by giving him a poisoned handkerchief, although it may have been aborted.&lt;ref name=Church181&gt;{{citation

Army officers with ties to the [[Ba'ath Party]] overthrew Qasim in the [[Ramadan Revolution]] [[coup]] of 1963. [[Ba'athist]] leaders were appointed to the cabinet and [[Abdul Salam Arif]] became president.  The governments of the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]] were complicit in the coup.&lt;ref&gt;JFK Library, Memorandum for The President from Robert W. Komer, 8 February 1963 (JFK, NSF, Countries, Iraq, Box 117, &quot;Iraq 1/63-2/63&quot;, document 18), p. 1.  &quot;We will make informal friendly noises as soon as we can find out whom to talk with, and ought to recognize as soon as we’re sure these guys are firmly in the saddle. CIA had excellent reports on the plotting, but I doubt either they or UK should claim much credit for it.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Arif dismissed and arrested the [[Ba'athist]] leaders later that year in the [[November 1963 Iraqi coup d'état]].  

Arif died in a plane crash in 1966, in what was probably an act of sabotage by Ba'athist elements in the Iraqi military.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/25/world/middleeast/25aref.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world &quot;Abdel-Rahman Aref, 91, Former Iraqi President, Is Dead&quot;]  ''The New York Times.''  25 August 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Abdul Rahman al-Bazzaz]] became acting president for three days, and a power struggle for the presidency occurred.  In the first meeting of the Defense Council and cabinet to elect a president, Al-Bazzaz needed a two-thirds majority to win the presidency.  Al-Bazzaz was unsuccessful, and [[Abdul Rahman Arif]] was elected president.  He was viewed by army officers as weaker and easier to manipulate than his brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Charles R. H.

Saddam returned to Iraq, but was imprisoned in 1964.  In 1966, [[Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr]] appointed him Deputy Secretary of the Regional Command.  Saddam escaped from prison in 1967.  Saddam, who would prove to be a skilled organiser, revitalised the party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Charles R. H. Tripp|Tripp, Charles]] |  page = 183 | title = A History of Iraq | location = | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | year = 2010 | isbn = 978-0-521-87823-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was elected to the Regional Command, as the story goes, with help from [[Michel Aflaq]]--the founder of [[Ba'athism|Ba'athist thought]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hanna Batatu&quot;&gt;''The Old Social Classes and the Revolutionary Movements of Iraq'' (Princeton 1978).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, Saddam participated in a bloodless coup led by Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr that overthrew Abdul Rahman Arif.  Arif was given refuge in [[London]] and then [[Istanbul]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;  Al-Bakr was named president and Saddam was named his deputy, and deputy chairman of the Ba'athist [[Iraqi Revolutionary Command Council|Revolutionary Command Council]]. According to biographers, Saddam never forgot the tensions within the first Ba'athist government, which formed the basis for his measures to promote Ba'ath party unity as well as his resolve to maintain power and programs to ensure social stability.  Although Saddam was al-Bakr's deputy, he was a strong behind-the-scenes party politician. Al-Bakr was the older and more prestigious of the two, but by 1969 Hussein clearly had become the moving force behind the party.

[[Ali Ibrahim al-Tikriti]], an Iraqi general and friend of Saddam who defected in 1991, has alleged that the [[Soviet Union]] covertly assisted the Iraqi Ba'athists in gaining and holding onto power in the sixties.   &quot;I was there helping with the revolution and worked on two occasions with Soviet [[KGB]] officials to help train us,&quot; he said.&lt;ref&gt;Mauro, Ryan, [http://globalpolitician.com/21610-iraq-syria-wmd &quot;Interview with Ali Ibrahim al-Tikriti,&quot;] Global Politician.com, 14 February 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  For thirty years, the KGB and [[Federal Security Service|FSB]] trained Iraqi secret police; some 70,000 Russian military advisors, many of them intelligence and security specialists, served in Iraq from 1973-2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strategypage.com/htmw/htintel/articles/20061010.aspx Russian Assassins in Iraq], ''Strategy Page,''  10 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political program===
[[Image:Saddam1970s.jpg|thumb|250px|Promoting women's literacy and education in the 1970s]]

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, as vice chairman of the Revolutionary Command Council, formally the al-Bakr's second-in-command, Saddam built a reputation as a progressive, effective politician.&lt;ref&gt;CNN, &quot;Hussein was symbol of autocracy, cruelty in Iraq,&quot; 30 December 2003. [http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/12/29/hussein.obit/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Saddam moved up the ranks in the new government by aiding attempts to strengthen and unify the Ba'ath party and taking a leading role in addressing the country's major domestic problems and expanding the party's following.

After the Ba'athists took power in 1968, Saddam focused on attaining stability in a nation riddled with profound tensions. Long before Saddam, Iraq had been split along social, ethnic, religious, and economic fault lines: [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] versus [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'ite]], Arab versus [[Kurds|Kurd]], tribal chief versus urban merchant, nomad versus peasant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Humphreys, 78&quot;&gt;Humphreys, 78&lt;/ref&gt;  The desire for stable rule in a country rife with [[Political faction|factionalism]] led Saddam to pursue both massive repression and the improvement of living standards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Humphreys, 78&quot;/&gt;

Saddam actively fostered the modernization of the Iraqi economy along with the creation of a strong security apparatus to prevent coups within the power structure and insurrections apart from it. Ever concerned with broadening his base of support among the diverse elements of Iraqi society and mobilizing mass support, he closely followed the administration of state welfare and development programs.

At the center of this strategy was Iraq's oil. On 1 June 1972, Saddam oversaw the seizure of international oil interests, which, at the time, dominated the country's oil sector. A year later, world oil prices rose dramatically as a result of the [[1973 energy crisis]], and skyrocketing revenues enabled Saddam to expand his agenda.

Within just a few years, Iraq was providing social services that were unprecedented among Middle Eastern countries. Saddam established and controlled the &quot;National Campaign for the Eradication of Illiteracy&quot; and the campaign for &quot;Compulsory Free Education in Iraq,&quot; and largely under his auspices, the government established universal free schooling up to the highest education levels; hundreds of thousands learned to read in the years following the initiation of the program. The government also supported families of soldiers, granted free hospitalization to everyone, and gave subsidies to farmers. Iraq created one of the most modernized public-health systems in the Middle East, earning Saddam an award from the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/iraq/saddam_hussein.html Saddam Hussein], CBC News, 29 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Moore, [http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/iraq/war/player1.html The Iraq War player profile: Saddam Hussein's Rise to Power], PBS Online Newshour&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of increasing oil revenues, Saddam diversified the largely oil-based [[economy of Iraq|Iraqi economy]]. Saddam implemented a national infrastructure campaign that made great progress in building roads, promoting mining, and developing other industries. The campaign helped Iraq's energy industries. Electricity was brought to nearly every city in Iraq, and many outlying areas.

Before the 1970s, most of Iraq's people lived in the countryside and roughly two-thirds were peasants. This number would decrease quickly during the 1970s as global oil prices helped revenues to rise from less than a half billion dollars to tens of billions of dollars and the country invested into industrial expansion.

Saddam was lucky for the revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;economist2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/8492668 | title=Saddam Hussein&amp;nbsp;— The blundering dictator | date=4 January 2007 |work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Economist described the sentiments, stating that &quot;Much as Adolf Hitler won early praise for galvanising German industry, ending mass unemployment and building autobahns, Saddam earned admiration abroad for his deeds. He had a good instinct for what the &quot;Arab street&quot; demanded, following the decline in Egyptian leadership brought about by the trauma of Israel's six-day victory in the 1967 war, the death of the pan-Arabist hero, Gamal Abdul Nasser, in 1970, and the &quot;traitorous&quot; drive by his successor, Anwar Sadat, to sue for peace with the Jewish state. Saddam's self-aggrandising propaganda, with himself posing as the defender of Arabism against Jewish or [[Iran|Persian]] intruders, was heavy-handed, but consistent as a drumbeat. It helped, of course, that [[Iraqi Intelligence Service|his mukhabarat]] (secret police) put dozens of Arab news editors, writers and artists on the payroll.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;economist2007&quot;/&gt;

In 1972, Saddam started developing his chemical weapons program{{citation needed|date=May 2012}} and signed a 15-year Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation with the [[Soviet Union]].

According to former CIA Near East Division Chief James Chritchfield, after al-Bakr and Saddam seized power in 1968, &quot;America slowly developed, not a hostility, but enormous reservations about the ability of the Ba'ath to constructively bring Iraq along.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Frontline. &quot;James Chritchfield Interview.&quot; 1995. PBS. http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/saddam/interviews/critchfield.html&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1973-5, the CIA colluded with [[Shah]] [[Mohammed Reza Pahlavi]] of [[Iran]] to finance and arm Kurdish rebels in the [[Second Kurdish-Iraqi War]] in an attempt to overthrow al-Bakr.  When Iran and Iraq signed the [[Algiers Agreement]] in 1975, the support ceased.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Ugly Truth About Gerald Ford&quot;&gt;Hitchens, Christopher, [http://www.slate.com/id/2156400 &quot;The Ugly Truth About Gerald Ford&quot;], ''Slate''&lt;/ref&gt;

Saddam focused on fostering loyalty to the Ba'athists in the rural areas. After nationalizing foreign oil interests, Saddam supervised the modernization of the countryside, mechanizing agriculture on a large scale, and distributing land to peasant farmers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ref6&quot;&gt;Khadduri, Majid. ''Socialist Iraq''. The Middle East Institute, Washington, D.C., 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The Ba'athists established farm cooperatives and the government also doubled expenditures for agricultural development in 1974–1975.
Saddam's welfare programs were part of a combination of &quot;carrot and stick&quot; tactics to enhance support for Saddam. The state-owned banks were put under his thumb. Lending was based on cronyism.&lt;ref name=&quot;economist2004&quot;/&gt;

Development went forward at such a fevered pitch that two million people from other Arab countries and even [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] worked in Iraq to meet the growing demand for labor.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

===Succession===
In 1976, Saddam rose to the position of general in the Iraqi armed forces, and rapidly became the [[Strongman (politics)|strongman]] of the government. As the ailing, elderly al-Bakr became unable to execute his duties, Saddam took on an increasingly prominent role as the face of the government both internally and externally. He soon became the architect of Iraq's foreign policy and represented the nation in all diplomatic situations. He was the ''de facto'' leader of Iraq some years before he formally came to power in 1979. He slowly began to consolidate his power over Iraq's government and the Ba'ath party. Relationships with fellow party members were carefully cultivated, and Saddam soon accumulated a powerful circle of support within the party.

In 1979 al-Bakr started to make treaties with [[Syria]], also under Ba'athist leadership, that would lead to unification between the two countries. Syrian President [[Hafez al-Assad]] would become deputy leader in a union, and this would drive Saddam to obscurity. Saddam acted to secure his grip on power. He forced the ailing al-Bakr to resign on 16 July 1979, and formally assumed the presidency.

Shortly afterwards, he convened an assembly of Ba'ath party leaders on 22 July 1979. During the assembly, which he ordered videotaped (viewable via this reference&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHBF8EKt-zc A Documentary on Saddam Hussein 5]'', YouTube&lt;/ref&gt;), Saddam claimed to have found a [[fifth column]] within the Ba'ath Party and directed Muhyi Abdel-Hussein to read out a confession and the names of 68 alleged co-conspirators. These members were labelled &quot;disloyal&quot; and were removed from the room one by one and taken into custody. After the list was read, Saddam congratulated those still seated in the room for their past and future loyalty. The 68 people arrested at the meeting were subsequently tried together and found guilty of [[treason]]. 22 were sentenced to execution. Other high-ranking members of the party formed the firing squad. By 1 August 1979, hundreds of high-ranking Ba'ath party members had been executed.&lt;ref&gt;Bay Fang. &quot;[http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/040719/19iraq.htm When Saddam ruled the day].&quot; ''U.S. News and World Report''. 11 July 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Mortimer. &quot;[http://www.nybooks.com/articles/3519 The Thief of Baghdad].&quot; ''New York Review of Books''. 27 September 1990, citing Fuad Matar.

===Genocidal campaign against Kurds===
{{Main|Al-Anfal Campaign}}
The [[Al-Anfal Campaign]] was a [[genocide|genocidal]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2006/08/14/genocide-iraq-anfal-campaign-against-kurds ] The Anfal Campaign Against the Kurds. A Middle East Watch Report: Human Rights Watch 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; campaign against the [[Kurdish people]] (and many others) in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] led by the [[Iraq]]i government of Saddam Hussein and headed by [[Ali Hassan al-Majid]]. The campaign takes its name from [[Sura]]t [[al-Anfal]] in the [[Qur'an]], which was used as a [[code name]] by the former Iraqi [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Iraq Region|Ba'ath]]ist administration for a series of attacks against the ''[[peshmerga]]'' rebels and the mostly [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] civilian population of rural Northern Iraq, conducted between 1986 and 1989 culminating in 1988. This campaign also targeted [[Shabak people|Shabaks]] and [[Yazidi]]s, [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], [[Iraqi Turkmen|Turkoman people]] and [[Mandeans]] and many villages belonging to these ethnic groups were also destroyed. Some reports cite Saddam Hussein's army as being responsible for 200,000 civilian deaths.&lt;ref&gt;William Ochsenwald &amp; Sydney N.

==Political repression==
{{Main|Human rights in Saddam Hussein's Iraq}}

Iraqi society is divided along lines of language, religion and ethnicity; Saddam's government rested on the support of the 20% minority of Sunnis. The Ba'ath Party was increasingly concerned about potential Shi'a Islamist influence following the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979. The Kurds of [[Iraqi Kurdistan|northern Iraq]] (who are Sunni, but not Arabs) were also permanently hostile to the Ba'athist party's pan-Arabism. To maintain power Saddam tended either to provide them with benefits so as to co-opt them into the regime, or to take repressive measures against them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iraq: A Country Study&quot;&gt;Helen Chapin Metz (ed) ''[http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/iqtoc.html Iraq: A Country Study:]'' &quot;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+iq0115) Internal Security in the 1980s&quot;], [[Library of Congress Country Studies]], 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

The major instruments for accomplishing this control were the paramilitary and police organizations. Beginning in 1974, [[Taha Yassin Ramadan]] (himself a Kurd Ba'athist), a close associate of Saddam, commanded the People's Army, which was responsible for internal security. As the Ba'ath Party's paramilitary, the People's Army acted as a counterweight against any coup attempts by the regular armed forces. In addition to the People's Army, the Department of General Intelligence ([[Iraqi Intelligence Service|Mukhabarat]]) was the most notorious arm of the state security system, feared for its use of [[torture]] and assassination. It was commanded by [[Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti]], Saddam's younger [[Sibling|half-brother]]. Since 1982, foreign observers believed that this department operated both at home and abroad in their mission to seek out and eliminate Saddam's perceived opponents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iraq: A Country Study&quot;/&gt;

Saddam was notable for terror against his own people. ''[[The Economist]]'' described Saddam as &quot;one of the last of the 20th century's great dictators, but not the least in terms of egotism, or cruelty, or morbid will to power&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;economist2007&quot;/&gt; Saddam's regime was accused of killing hundreds of thousands of Iraqi citizens and committing [[war crimes]] in Iran, Kuwait, and Saudi Arabia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=By Dexter Filkins |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/magazine/07MAKIYA-t.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=310195565a77e9ff&amp;ex=1349409600&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |title=Iraq – Kanan Makiya – Saddam Hussein – New York Times |location=Iraq |work=The New York Times  |date=7 October 2007 |accessdate=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indict.org.uk/newsarticles.php?article=news180603 |title=News |publisher=Indict |date=18 June 2003 |accessdate=2 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/889tngrz.asp?pg=2 |title=A Lifesaving War |publisher=The Weekly Standard |date=29 March 2004 |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/03/17/1047749719178.html |title=Bland words, vivid images wait to nail Saddam's crimes |work=The Age |location=Melbourne |date=18 March 2003 |accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrw.org/reports/1992/Iraq926.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]] issued regular reports of widespread [[imprisonment]] and torture.

==Personality cult==
As a sign of his consolidation of power, Saddam's [[personality cult]] pervaded Iraqi society. He had thousands of portraits, posters, statues and murals erected in his honor all over Iraq. His face could be seen on the sides of office buildings, schools, airports, and shops, as well as on Iraqi currency. Saddam's personality cult reflected his efforts to appeal to the various elements in Iraqi society. This was seen in his variety of apparel: he appeared in the costumes of the [[Bedouin]], the traditional clothes of the Iraqi peasant (which he essentially wore during his childhood), and even [[Kurdish clothing]], but also appeared in Western suits fitted by his favorite tailor, projecting the image of an urbane and modern leader. Sometimes he would also be portrayed as a devout Muslim, wearing full headdress and robe, praying toward [[Mecca]].

He also conducted two [[show election]]s, in 1995 and in 2002. In the [[Iraqi presidential referendum, 1995|1995 referendum]], conducted on 15 October, he reportedly received 99.96% of the votes in a 99.47% turnout, getting only 3052 negative votes among an electorate of 8.4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/10/17/world/no-surprise-in-iraqi-vote.html |title=No surprise in Iraqi vote |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=29 January 2012 |date=17 October 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6507/is_4_57/ai_n28932894/ |title=Iraq - July 22 - Saddam Plans Referendum |publisher=FindArticles |accessdate=29 January 2012 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Iraqi presidential referendum, 2002|October 15, 2002 referendum]] he officially achieved 100% of approval votes and 100% turnout, as the electoral commission reported the next day that every one of the 11,445,638 eligible voters cast a &quot;Yes&quot; vote for the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/2331951.stm |title=Saddam 'wins 100% of vote' |publisher=BBC |accessdate=29 January 2012 |date=16 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He erected statues around the country, which Iraqis toppled after his fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toppledsaddam.org/ |title=Toppled Saddam |publisher=toppledsaddam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign affairs==
{{See also|Cuba-Iraq relations|France–Iraq relations|Iraq-Lebanon relations|Iraq–Russia relations|Iraq – Saudi Arabia relations|Iraqi-Israeli relations|Iraq-United States relations|Iraq-Syria relations}}

Iraq's relations with the Arab world have been extremely varied. Relations between Iraq and [[Egypt]] violently ruptured in 1977, when the two nations broke relations with each other following Iraq's criticism of Egyptian President [[Anwar Sadat]]'s peace initiatives with [[Israel]]. In 1978, [[Baghdad]] hosted an [[Arab League]] summit that condemned and ostracized Egypt for accepting the [[Camp David accords]]. However, Egypt's strong material and diplomatic support for Iraq in the war with Iran led to warmer relations and numerous contacts between senior officials, despite the continued absence of ambassadorial-level representation. Since 1983, Iraq has repeatedly called for restoration of Egypt's &quot;natural role&quot; among Arab countries.

[[File:Arab Summit 1978.jpg|thumb|230px|Saddam Hussein and [[Hafez al-Assad]] of Syria at an [[Arab League#Summits|Arab Summit]] in Baghdad in November 1978.]]
Saddam developed a reputation for liking expensive goods, such as his diamond-coated [[Rolex]] wristwatch, and sent copies of them to his friends around the world. To his ally [[Kenneth Kaunda]] Saddam once sent a Boeing 747 full of presents&amp;nbsp;— rugs, televisions, ornaments. Kaunda sent back his own personal [[magician (paranormal)|magician]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-484756/The-great-Saddam-bling-buy-sale-includes-100-000-Rolex-left-palace.html |title=The great Saddam bling and buy sale includes £100, 000 Rolex left behind in palace |work=The Daily Mail |location=UK  |first=Mark |last=Nicol |date=29 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saddam had close relationship with Russian intelligence agent [[Yevgeny Primakov]] and apparently Primakov helped Saddam to stay in power in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=28397&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=226 |title=Saving Saddam&amp;nbsp;— the sequel? |date=4 March 2003 |publisher=The Jamestown Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saddam's only visit to a Western country took place in September 1975 when he met with his friend, Prime Minister [[Jacques Chirac]] in [[Paris, France]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The Chirac Doctrine&quot;/&gt;

Several Iraqi leaders, Lebanese arms merchant Sarkis Soghanalian and others have told that Saddam financed Chirac's party. In 1991 Saddam threatened to expose those who had taken largesse from him: &quot;From Mr. Chirac to Mr. Chevènement, politicians and economic leaders were in open competition to spend time with us and flatter us. We have now grasped the reality of the situation. If the trickery continues, we will be forced to unmask them, all of them, before the French public.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Chirac Doctrine&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meforum.org/772/the-chirac-doctrine |title=The Chirac Doctrine |publisher=The Middle East Quarterly |date=Fall 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
France armed Saddam and it was Iraq's largest trade partner throughout Saddam's rule. Seized documents show how French officials and businessmen close to Chirac, including [[Charles Pasqua]], his former interior minister, personally benefitted from the deals with Saddam.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Chirac Doctrine&quot;/&gt;

Because Saddam Hussein rarely left Iraq, [[Tariq Aziz]], one of Saddam's aides, traveled abroad extensively and represented Iraq at many diplomatic meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Healy, Jack. &quot;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/27/world/middleeast/27iraq.html?ref=world Iraq Court Sentences Tariq Aziz to Death].&quot; ''[[The New York Times]]''. 26 October 2010. Retrieved on 26 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In foreign affairs, Saddam sought to have Iraq play a leading role in the Middle East. Iraq signed an aid pact with the Soviet Union in 1972, and arms were sent along with several thousand advisers. However, the 1978 crackdown on [[Communist Party of Iraq|Iraqi Communists]] and a shift of trade toward the West strained Iraqi relations with the Soviet Union; Iraq then took on a more Western orientation until the [[Gulf War]] in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Chapin Metz (ed) ''[http://memory.loc.gov/frd/cs/iqtoc.html Iraq: A Country Study:]'' &quot;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field(DOCID+iq0083) The West&quot;], [[Library of Congress Country Studies]], 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[1973 oil crisis|oil crisis]] of 1973, France had changed to a more pro-Arab policy and was accordingly rewarded by Saddam with closer ties. He made a state visit to France in 1975, cementing close ties with some French business and ruling political circles. In 1975 Saddam negotiated an accord with Iran that contained Iraqi concessions on border disputes. In return, Iran agreed to stop supporting opposition Kurds in Iraq. Saddam led Arab opposition to the [[Camp David Accords]] between Egypt and Israel (1979).

Saddam initiated Iraq's nuclear enrichment project in the 1980s, with French assistance. The first Iraqi nuclear reactor was named by the French &quot;[[Osirak]]&quot;. Osirak was destroyed on 7 June 1981&lt;ref name=&quot;Osirak&quot;&gt;BBC, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/june/7/newsid_3014000/3014623.stm 1981: Israel bombs Baghdad nuclear reactor], ''BBC On This Day 7 June 1981'' referenced 6 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; by an Israeli air strike ([[Operation Opera]]).

Nearly from its founding as a modern state in 1920, Iraq has had to deal with Kurdish separatists in the northern part of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, 120&lt;/ref&gt; Saddam did negotiate an agreement in 1970 with separatist Kurdish leaders, giving them autonomy, but the agreement broke down. The result was brutal fighting between the government and Kurdish groups and even Iraqi bombing of Kurdish villages in Iran, which caused Iraqi relations with Iran to deteriorate. However, after Saddam had negotiated the 1975 treaty with Iran, the Shah withdrew support for the Kurds, who suffered a total defeat.

===Iran–Iraq War===

Rumsfeld, who became [[United States Secretary of Defense|U.S. Secretary of Defense]] during the [[George W. Bush administration]], led the coalition forces during the [[Iraq War]]]]
In early 1979, Iran's Shah [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] was overthrown by the [[History of Iran#Islamic Revolution|Islamic Revolution]], thus giving way to an Islamic republic led by the [[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini]]. The influence of revolutionary Shi'ite Islam grew apace in the region, particularly in countries with large Shi'ite populations, especially Iraq. Saddam feared that radical Islamic ideas—hostile to his secular rule—were rapidly spreading inside his country among the majority Shi'ite population.

There had also been bitter enmity between Saddam and Khomeini since the 1970s. Khomeini, having been exiled from Iran in 1964, took up residence in Iraq, at the Shi'ite holy city of [[An Najaf]]. There he involved himself with Iraqi Shi'ites and developed a strong, worldwide religious and political following against the Iranian Government, whom Saddam tolerated. However, when Khomeini began to urge the Shi'ites there to overthrow Saddam and under pressure from the Shah, who had agreed to a rapprochement between Iraq and Iran in 1975, Saddam agreed to expel Khomeini in 1978 to France. However this turned out to be an imminent failure and a political catalyst, for Khomeini had access to more media connections and also collaborated with a much larger Iranian community under his support whom he used to his advantage.

After Khomeini gained power, skirmishes between Iraq and revolutionary Iran occurred for ten months over the sovereignty of the disputed [[Shatt al-Arab]] waterway, which divides the two countries. During this period, Saddam Hussein publicly maintained that it was in Iraq's interest not to engage with Iran, and that it was in the interests of both nations to maintain peaceful relations. However, in a private meeting with [[Salah Omar Al-Ali]], Iraq's permanent ambassador to [[United Nations|the United Nations]], he revealed that he intended to invade and occupy a large part of Iran within months. Later (probably to appeal for support from the United States and most Western nations), he would make toppling the Islamic government one of his intentions as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;PIRRR&quot;&gt;Esposito, John, &quot;Political Islam Revolution, Radicalism, or Reform&quot;, &quot;Political Islam and Gulf Security&quot;, Lynne Rienner Publishers, ISBN 1-55587-262-X, pp. 56–58&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraq invaded Iran, first attacking [[Mehrabad Airport]] of [[Tehran]] and then entering the oil-rich Iranian land of [[Khuzestan Province|Khuzestan]], which also has a sizable Arab minority, on 22 September 1980 and declared it a new province of Iraq. With the support of the Arab states, the United States, and Europe, and heavily financed by the Arab states of the Persian Gulf, Saddam Hussein had become &quot;the defender of the Arab world&quot; against a revolutionary Iran. The only exception was the Soviet Union, who initially refused to supply Iraq on the basis of neutrality in the conflict, although in his memoirs, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] claimed that [[Leonid Brezhnev]] refused to aid Saddam over infuriation of Saddam's treatment of Iraqi communists. Consequently, many viewed Iraq as &quot;an agent of the civilized world&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PIRRR&quot;/&gt; The blatant disregard of international law and violations of international borders were ignored. Instead Iraq received economic and military support from its allies, who conveniently overlooked Saddam's use of chemical warfare against the Kurds and the Iranians and Iraq's efforts to develop nuclear weapons.&lt;ref name=&quot;PIRRR&quot;/&gt;

In the first days of the war, there was heavy ground fighting around strategic ports as Iraq launched an attack on Khuzestan. After making some initial gains, Iraq's troops began to suffer losses from [[human wave]] attacks by Iran. By 1982, Iraq was on the defensive and looking for ways to end the war.

At this point, Saddam asked his ministers for candid advice. Health Minister [[Riyadh Ibrahim|Dr. Riyadh Ibrahim]] suggested that Saddam temporarily step down to promote peace negotiations. Initially, Saddam Hussein appeared to take in this opinion as part of his cabinet democracy. A few weeks later, Dr. Ibrahim was sacked when held responsible for a fatal incident in an Iraqi hospital where a patient died from intravenous administration of the wrong concentration of potassium supplement.

Dr. Ibrahim was arrested a few days after he started his new life as a sacked Minister. He was known to have publicly declared before that arrest that he was &quot;glad that he got away alive.&quot; Pieces of Ibrahim's dismembered body were delivered to his wife the next day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Woods&quot;&gt;Kevin Woods, James Lacey, and Williamson Murray, [http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20060501faessay85301-p20/kevin-woods-james-lacey-williamson-murray/saddam-s-delusions-the-view-from-the-inside.html &quot;Saddam's Delusions: The View From the Inside&quot;], ''Foreign Affairs,'' May/June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iraq quickly found itself bogged down in one of the longest and most destructive [[Attrition warfare|wars of attrition]] of the 20th century. During the war, Iraq used [[chemical weapons]] against Iranian forces fighting on the southern front and Kurdish separatists who were attempting to open up a northern front in Iraq with the help of Iran. These chemical weapons were developed by Iraq from materials and technology supplied primarily by [[West Germany|West German]] companies as well as &lt;ref name=&quot;Isa&quot;&gt;Dr. Khalil Ibrahim Al Isa, [http://www.fas.org/nuke/guide/iraq/cw/az120103.html Iraqi Scientist Reports on German, Other Help for Iraq Chemical Weapons Program], ''Al Zaman (London),'' 1 December 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] of the [[Federal government of the United States|United States]] which also supplied Iraq with &quot;satellite photos showing Iranian deployments&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dickey, Christopher|first=Thomas, Evan|title=How Saddam Happened|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2002/09/22/how-saddam-happened.html|accessdate=20 August 2011|newspaper=Newsweek|date=22 September 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and advised Hussein to bomb civilian targets in [[Tehran]] and other Iranian cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Waas, Murray|first=Unger, Craig|title=In the Loop: Bush's Secret Mission|url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1992/11/02/1992_11_02_064_TNY_CARDS_000359993|accessdate=20 August 2011|newspaper=The New Yorker|date=2 November 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a US bid to open full diplomatic relations with Iraq, the country was removed from the US list of [[State Sponsors of Terrorism]].

France sold 25&amp;nbsp;billion dollars worth arms to Saddam.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Chirac Doctrine&quot;/&gt;

Saddam reached out to other Arab governments for cash and political support during the war, particularly after Iraq's oil industry severely suffered at the hands of the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Navy|Iranian navy]] in the [[Persian Gulf]]. Iraq successfully gained some military and financial aid, as well as diplomatic and moral support, from the Soviet Union, China, France, and the United States, which together feared the prospects of the expansion of revolutionary Iran's influence in the region. The Iranians, demanding that the international community should force Iraq to pay war reparations to Iran, refused any suggestions for a cease-fire. Despite several [[United Nations Security Council Resolutions concerning Iraq|calls for a ceasefire]] by the [[United Nations Security Council]], hostilities continued until 20 August 1988.

On 16 March 1988, the Kurdish town of [[Halabja]] was attacked with a mix of [[mustard gas]] and [[nerve agent]]s, killing 5,000 civilians, and maiming, disfiguring, or seriously debilitating 10,000 more. (''see [[Halabja poison gas attack]]'')&lt;ref name=&quot;Halabja&quot;&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/rls/18714.htm Saddam's Chemical Weapons Campaign: Halabja, 16 March 1988]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&amp;nbsp;— ''Bureau of Public Affairs''&lt;/ref&gt; The attack occurred in conjunction with the 1988 [[al-Anfal campaign]] designed to reassert central control of the mostly Kurdish population of areas of northern Iraq and defeat the Kurdish [[peshmerga]] rebel forces.

[[File:Saddam Hussein 1982.jpg|thumb|200px|Saddam Hussein in 1982]]
The bloody eight-year war ended in a stalemate. There were hundreds of thousands of casualties with estimates of up to one million dead. Neither side had achieved what they had originally desired and at the borders were left nearly unchanged. The southern, oil rich and prosperous Khuzestan and Basra area (the main focus of the war, and the primary source of their economies) were almost completely destroyed and were left at the pre 1979 border, while Iran managed to make some small gains on its borders in the Northern Kurdish area. Both economies, previously healthy and expanding, were left in ruins.

Saddam borrowed tens of billions of dollars from other Arab states and a few billions from elsewhere during the 1980s to fight Iran, mainly to prevent the expansion of Shiite radicalism. However, this had proven to completely backfire both on Iraq and on the part of the Arab states, for Khomeini was widely perceived as a hero for managing to defend Iran and maintain the war with little foreign support against the heavily backed Iraq and only managed to boost Islamic radicalism not only within the Arab states, but within Iraq itself, creating new tensions between the Sunni Ba'ath Party and the majority Shiite population. Faced with rebuilding Iraq's infrastructure and internal resistance, Saddam desperately sought out cash once again, this time for postwar reconstruction.

===Tensions with Kuwait===
The end of the war with Iran served to deepen latent tensions between Iraq and its wealthy neighbor [[Kuwait]]. Saddam urged the Kuwaitis to forgive the Iraqi debt accumulated in the war, some $30&amp;nbsp;billion, but they refused.&lt;ref name=&quot;Humphreys, 105&quot;&gt;Humphreys, 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Saddam pushed oil-exporting countries to raise oil prices by cutting back production; Kuwait refused, however. In addition to refusing the request, Kuwait spearheaded the opposition in [[OPEC]] to the cuts that Saddam had requested. Kuwait was pumping large amounts of oil, and thus keeping prices low, when Iraq needed to sell high-priced oil from its wells to pay off a huge debt.

Saddam had always argued that Kuwait was historically an integral part of Iraq, and that Kuwait had only come into being through the maneuverings of British imperialism; this echoed a belief that Iraqi nationalists had voiced for the past 50 years. This belief was one of the few articles of faith uniting the political scene in a nation rife with sharp social, ethnic, religious, and ideological divides.&lt;ref name=&quot;Humphreys, 105&quot;/&gt;

The extent of Kuwaiti oil reserves also intensified tensions in the region. The oil reserves of Kuwait (with a population of 2 million next to Iraq's 25) were roughly equal to those of Iraq. Taken together, Iraq and Kuwait sat on top of some 20 percent of the world's known oil reserves; as an article of comparison, [[Saudi Arabia]] holds 25 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Humphreys, 105&quot;/&gt;

Saddam complained to the [[U.S. State Department]] that Kuwait had slant drilled oil out of wells that Iraq considered to be within its disputed border with Kuwait. Saddam still had an experienced and well-equipped army, which he used to influence regional affairs. He later ordered troops to the Iraq–Kuwait border.

[[Image:Glaspie hussein.jpg|thumb|right|[[United States Ambassador to Iraq|U.S. Ambassador to Iraq]] [[April Glaspie|April Catherine Glaspie]] meets Saddam for an emergency meeting.]]As Iraq-Kuwait relations rapidly deteriorated, Saddam was receiving conflicting information about how the U.S. would respond to the prospects of an invasion. For one, Washington had been taking measures to cultivate a constructive relationship with Iraq for roughly a decade. The [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]] gave Saddam roughly $40&amp;nbsp;billion in aid in the 1980s to fight Iran, nearly all of it on credit. The U.S. also gave Saddam billions of dollars to keep him from forming a strong alliance with the [[Soviet Union|Soviets]].&lt;ref&gt;A free-access on-line archive relating to U.S.–Iraq relations in the 1980s is offered by ''The National Security Archive'' of the [[George Washington University]].

U.S. ambassador to Iraq [[April Glaspie]] met with Saddam in an emergency meeting on 25 July 1990, where the Iraqi leader stated his intention to ''give negotiations only... one more brief chance'' before forcing Iraq's claims on Kuwait.&lt;ref&gt;'''Transcript from Hussein/Glaspie meeting'''&lt;br /&gt;'''Saddam Hussein:''' As you know, for years now I have made every effort to reach a settlement on our dispute with Kuwait. There is to be a meeting in two days; I am prepared to give negotiations only this one more brief chance. (pause) When we (the Iraqis) meet (with the Kuwaitis) and we see there is hope, then nothing will happen. But if we are unable to find a solution, then it will be natural that Iraq will not accept death.&lt;br /&gt;'''U.S. Ambassador Glaspie:''' What solutions would be acceptable?&lt;br /&gt;'''Saddam Hussein:''' If we could keep the whole of the Shatt al Arab, our strategic goal in our war with Iran, we will make concessions (to the Kuwaitis). But, if we are forced to choose between keeping half of the Shatt and the whole of Iraq (including Kuwait) then we will give up all of the Shatt to defend our claims on Kuwait to keep the whole of Iraq in the shape we wish it to be. (pause) What is the United States' opinion on this?&lt;br /&gt;'''U.S. Ambassador Glaspie:''' I think I understand this. I have lived here for years. I admire your extraordinary efforts to rebuild your country. I know you need funds. We understand that and our opinion is that you should have the opportunity to rebuild your country. But we have no opinion on the Arab-Arab conflicts, like your border disagreement with Kuwait. I was in the American Embassy in Kuwait during the late 60s. The instruction we had during this period was that we should express no opinion on this issue and that the issue is not associated with America. (Secretary of State) James Baker has directed our official spokesmen to emphasize this instruction. We hope you can solve this problem using any suitable methods via Klibi or via President Mubarak. All that we hope is that these issues are solved quickly. With regard to all of this, can I ask you to see how the issue appears to us?. (Saddam smiles)&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. officials attempted to maintain a conciliatory line with Iraq, indicating that while [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[James Baker]] did not want force used, they would not take any position on the Iraq–Kuwait boundary dispute and did not want to become involved.&lt;ref&gt;Greg Palast:&quot;Armed Madhouse&quot; Chapter 2 , Plume.&lt;/ref&gt; Whatever Glaspie did or did not say in her interview with Saddam, the Iraqis assumed that the United States had invested too much in building relations with Iraq over the 1980s to sacrifice them for Kuwait.&lt;ref&gt;Humphreys, 106&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later, Iraq and Kuwait met for a final negotiation session, which failed. Saddam then sent his troops into Kuwait. As tensions between Washington and Saddam began to escalate, the [[Soviet Union]], under [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], strengthened its military relationship with the Iraqi leader, providing him military advisers, arms and aid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heritage.org/dataconvert/pdf/em0280.pdf &quot;Bush to Gorbachev: Choose Between Saddam and the West,&quot; by Jay P.

==Gulf War==
{{Main|Invasion of Kuwait|Gulf War}}

On 2 August 1990, Saddam invaded Kuwait, initially claiming assistance to &quot;Kuwaiti revolutionaries,&quot; thus sparking an international crisis. On 4 August an Iraqi-backed &quot;[[Republic of Kuwait|Provisional Government of Free Kuwait]]&quot; was proclaimed, but a total lack of legitimacy and support for it led to an 8 August announcement of a &quot;merger&quot; of the two countries. On 28 August Kuwait formally became the 19th [[Governorates of Iraq|Governorate]] of Iraq. Just two years after the 1988 Iraq and Iran truce, &quot;Saddam Hussein did what his Gulf patrons had earlier paid him to prevent.&quot; Having removed the threat of Iranian fundamentalism he &quot;overran Kuwait and confronted his Gulf neighbors in the name of Arab nationalism and Islam.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PIRRR&quot;/&gt;

When later asked why he invaded Kuwait, Saddam first claimed that it was because Kuwait was rightfully Iraq's 19th province and then said &quot;When I get something into my head I act. That's just the way I am.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;economist2007&quot;/&gt; After Saddam's seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, a UN coalition led by the United States drove Iraq's troops from Kuwait in February 1991. The ability for Saddam Hussein to pursue such military aggression was from a &quot;military machine paid for in large part by the tens of billions of dollars Kuwait and the Gulf states had poured into Iraq and the weapons and technology provided by the Soviet Union, Germany, and France.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PIRRR&quot;/&gt;

Shortly before he invaded Kuwait, he shipped 100 new [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes]] 200 Series cars to top editors in Egypt and Jordan. Two days before the first attacks, Saddam reportedly offered Egypt's [[Hosni Mubarak]] 50 million dollars in cash, &quot;ostensibly for grain&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/002/605fgcob.asp |title=Saddam's Cash |date=5 May 2003 |publisher=The Weekly Standard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. President [[George H. W. Bush]] responded cautiously for the first several days. On one hand, Kuwait, prior to this point, had been a virulent enemy of [[Israel]] and was the Persian Gulf monarchy that had had the most friendly relations with the Soviets.&lt;ref&gt;Walter LaFeber, ''Russia, America, and the Cold War, McGraw-Hill, 2002, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Washington foreign policymakers, along with Middle East experts, military critics, and firms heavily invested in the region, were extremely concerned with stability in this region.&lt;ref&gt;For a statement asserting the overriding importance of oil to U.S. national security and the U.S. economy, see, e.g., the declassified document, &quot;Responding to Iraqi Aggression in the Gulf,&quot; The White House, National Security Directive (NSD 54), top secret, 15 January 1991. This document can be read on line in [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB21/ George Washington University's National Security Archive Electronic Briefing Book No. 21] at [http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB21/06-01.htm].&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion immediately triggered fears that the world's [[Crude oil#Pricing|price of oil]], and therefore control of the world economy, was at stake. Britain profited heavily from billions of dollars of Kuwaiti investments and bank deposits. Bush was perhaps swayed while meeting with British prime minister [[Margaret Thatcher]], who happened to be in the U.S. at the time.&lt;ref&gt;See Margaret Thatcher, ''The Downing Street Years'' (1979–1990), 817.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooperation between the United States and the Soviet Union made possible the passage of resolutions in the [[United Nations Security Council]] giving Iraq a deadline to leave Kuwait and approving the use of force if Saddam did not comply with the timetable. U.S. officials feared Iraqi retaliation against oil-rich [[Saudi Arabia]], since the 1940s a close ally of Washington, for the Saudis' opposition to the invasion of Kuwait. Accordingly, the U.S. and a group of allies, including countries as diverse as [[Egypt]], Syria and [[Czechoslovakia]], deployed a massive amount of troops along the Saudi border with Kuwait and Iraq in order to encircle the Iraqi army, the largest in the Middle East.

Saddam's officers looted Kuwait, stripping even the marble from its palaces to move it to Saddam's own palace.&lt;ref name=&quot;economist2004&quot;/&gt;

During the period of negotiations and threats following the invasion, Saddam focused renewed attention on the [[Palestine|Palestinian]] problem by promising to withdraw his forces from Kuwait if [[Israel]] would relinquish the occupied territories in the [[West Bank]], the [[Golan Heights]], and the [[Gaza Strip]]. Saddam's proposal further split the Arab world, pitting U.S.- and Western-supported Arab states against the Palestinians. The allies ultimately rejected any linkage between the Kuwait crisis and Palestinian issues.

Saddam ignored the Security Council deadline. Backed by the Security Council, a U.S.-led coalition launched round-the-clock missile and aerial attacks on Iraq, beginning 16 January 1991. Israel, though subjected to attack by Iraqi missiles, refrained from retaliating in order not to provoke Arab states into leaving the coalition. A ground force consisting largely of U.S. and British armoured and infantry divisions ejected Saddam's army from Kuwait in February 1991 and occupied the southern portion of Iraq as far as the [[Euphrates]].

On 6 March 1991, Bush announced:

{{cquote|What is at stake is more than one small country, it is a big idea&amp;nbsp;— a [[New world order (politics)|new world order]], where diverse nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal aspirations of mankind: peace and security, freedom, and the rule of law.}}

In the end, the over-manned and under-equipped Iraqi army proved unable to compete on the battlefield with the highly mobile coalition land forces and their overpowering air support. Some 175,000 Iraqis were taken prisoner and casualties were estimated at over 85,000. As part of the cease-fire agreement, Iraq agreed to scrap all poison gas and [[biological warfare|germ weapons]] and allow UN observers to inspect the sites. UN trade sanctions would remain in effect until Iraq complied with all terms. Saddam publicly claimed victory at the end of the war.

==Postwar period==
Iraq's ethnic and religious divisions, together with the brutality of the conflict that this had engendered, laid the groundwork for postwar rebellions. In the aftermath of the fighting, social and ethnic unrest among Shi'ite Muslims, Kurds, and dissident military units threatened the stability of Saddam's government. Uprisings erupted in the Kurdish north and Shi'a southern and central parts of Iraq, but were ruthlessly repressed.

The United States, which had urged Iraqis to rise up against Saddam, did nothing to assist the rebellions. The Iranians, despite the widespread Shi'ite rebellions, had no interest in provoking another war, while [[Turkey]] opposed any prospect of Kurdish independence, and the Saudis and other conservative Arab states feared an Iran-style Shi'ite revolution. Saddam, having survived the immediate crisis in the wake of defeat, was left firmly in control of Iraq, although the country never recovered either economically or militarily from the Gulf War.&lt;ref name=&quot;PIRRR&quot;/&gt;

Saddam routinely cited his survival as &quot;proof&quot; that Iraq had in fact won the war against the U.S. This message earned Saddam a great deal of popularity in many sectors of the Arab world. John Esposito, however, claims that &quot;Arabs and Muslims were pulled in two directions. That they rallied not so much to Saddam Hussein as to the bipolar nature of the confrontation (the West versus the Arab Muslim world) and the issues that Saddam proclaimed: Arab unity, self-sufficiency, and social justice.&quot; As a result, Saddam Hussein appealed to many people for the same reasons that attracted more and more followers to Islamic revivalism and also for the same reasons that fueled [[Anti-Western sentiment|anti-Western]] feelings.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PIRRR&quot;/&gt;

As one U.S. Muslim observer noted: People forgot about Saddam's record and concentrated on America&amp;nbsp;... Saddam Hussein might be wrong, but it is not America who should correct him.&quot; A shift was, therefore, clearly visible among many Islamic movements in the post war period &quot;from an initial Islamic ideological rejection of Saddam Hussein, the secular persecutor of Islamic movements, and his invasion of Kuwait to a more populist Arab nationalist, anti-imperialist support for Saddam (or more precisely those issues he represented or championed) and the condemnation of foreign intervention and occupation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PIRRR&quot;/&gt;

Saddam, therefore, increasingly portrayed himself as a devout Muslim, in an effort to co-opt the conservative religious segments of society. Some elements of Sharia law were re-introduced, and the ritual phrase &quot;[[Allahu Akbar]]&quot; (&quot;God is great&quot;), in Saddam's handwriting, was added to the national flag. Saddam also commissioned the production of a &quot;[[Blood Qur'an]]&quot;, written using 27 litres of his own blood, to thank God for saving him from various dangers and conspiracies.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-2000&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/monitoring/media_reports/941490.stm Iraqi leader's Koran 'written in blood']. BBC News, 25 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations between the United States and Iraq remained tense following the Gulf War. The U.S. launched a [[Cruise missile strikes on Iraq (June 1993)|missile attack]] aimed at Iraq's intelligence headquarters in [[Baghdad]] 26 June 1993, citing evidence of repeated Iraqi violations of the &quot;no fly zones&quot; imposed after the Gulf War and for incursions into Kuwait.

The United Nations sanctions placed upon Iraq when it invaded Kuwait were not lifted, blocking Iraqi oil exports. This caused immense hardship in Iraq and virtually destroyed the Iraqi economy and state infrastructure. Only smuggling across the [[Syria]]n border, and humanitarian aid ameliorated the humanitarian crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.alternet.org/story/11933 |title = A Hard Look at Iraq Sanctions &amp;#124; AlterNet |accessdate =16 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 December 1996 the UN allowed Saddam's government to begin selling limited amounts of oil for food and medicine. Limited amounts of income from the United Nations started flowing into Iraq through the United Nations [[Oil for Food program]].

U.S. officials continued to accuse Saddam of violating the terms of the Gulf War's cease fire, by developing [[weapons of mass destruction]] and other banned weaponry, and violating the UN-imposed sanctions. Also during the 1990s, President [[Bill Clinton]] maintained sanctions and ordered air strikes in the &quot;Iraqi no-fly zones&quot; ([[Bombing of Iraq (December 1998)|Operation Desert Fox]]), in the hope that Saddam would be overthrown by political enemies inside Iraq. Western charges of Iraqi resistance to UN access to suspected weapons were the pretext for crises between 1997 and 1998, culminating in intensive U.S. and British missile strikes on Iraq, 16–19 December 1998. After two years of intermittent activity, U.S. and British warplanes struck harder at sites near Baghdad in February 2001.

Saddam's support base of Tikriti tribesmen, family members, and other supporters was divided after the war, and in the following years, contributing to the government's increasingly repressive and arbitrary nature. Domestic repression inside Iraq grew worse, and Saddam's sons, [[Uday Hussein|Uday]] and [[Qusay Hussein]], became increasingly powerful and carried out a private reign of terror.

Iraqi co-operation with UN weapons inspection teams was intermittent throughout the 1990s.

Saddam continued involvement in politics abroad. Video tapes retrieved after show his intelligence chiefs meeting with Arab journalists, including a meeting with the former managing director of Al-Jazeera, Mohammed Jassem al-Ali, in 2000. In the video Saddam's son Uday advised al-Ali about hires in Al-Jazeera: &quot;During your last visit here along with your colleagues we talked about a number of issues, and it does appear that you indeed were listening to what I was saying since changes took place and new faces came on board such as that lad, Mansour.&quot; He was later sacked by Al-Jazeera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/593ehwjg.asp |title=Uday's Oil-for-News Program |date=16 May 2005 |publisher=The Weekly Standard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 Austrian prosecutors investigated Saddam government's transactions with [[Fritz Edlinger]] that possibly violated Austrian [[money laundering]] and embargo regulations.&lt;ref name=&quot;format&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.news.at/articles/0243/10/43765/format-staatsanwalt-fritz-edlinger | title=FORMAT: Staatsanwalt ermittelt gegen Fritz Edlinger | date=23 October 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fritz Edlinger, president of the ''General Secretary of the Society for Austro-Arab relations'' (GÖAB) and a former member of [[Socialist International]]'s Middle East Committee, was an outspoken supporter of Saddam Hussein. In 2005 an Austrian journalist revealed that Fritz Edlinger's GÖAB had received $100,000 from an Iraqi front company as well as donations from Austrian companies soliciting business in Iraq.&lt;ref name=&quot;pfeifer&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.z-word.com/uploads/assets/documents/KP%20WEB%20UPLOAD_d4e6FprY.pdf | title=Victim Competition: Antisemitism and the Austrian Left | author=Karl Pfeifer | date=December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, a resolution sponsored by the [[European Union]] was adopted by the Commission for Human Rights, which stated that there had been no improvement in the human rights crisis in Iraq. The statement condemned President Saddam Hussein's government for its &quot;systematic, widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights and [[international humanitarian law]]&quot;. The resolution demanded that Iraq immediately put an end to its &quot;summary and arbitrary executions&amp;nbsp;... [[War rape|the use of rape as a political tool]] and all enforced and involuntary disappearances&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1940050.stm |work=BBC News  | title=UN condemns Iraq on human rights | date=19 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The international community, especially the U.S., continued to view Saddam as a bellicose tyrant who was a threat to the stability of the region.
After the [[September 11 attacks]], [[Vladimir Putin]] began to tell the United States that Iraq was preparing terrorist attacks against the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A53096-2004Jun18.html |title=Russia Warned U.S. About Iraq, Putin Says |date=18 June 2004 |work=Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his January 2002 [[State of the Union|state of the union address]] to Congress, President [[George W.

Moreover, Bush announced that he would possibly take action to topple the Iraqi government, because of the threat of its weapons of mass destruction. Bush stated that &quot;The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop [[anthrax]], and [[nerve gas]], and [[nuclear weapons]] for over a decade&amp;nbsp;...

During the renewed inspections beginning in November 2002, Blix found no stockpiles of WMD and noted &quot;proactive&quot; but not always the &quot;immediate&quot; Iraqi cooperation as called for by [[UN Security Council Resolution 1441]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=6383&amp;Cr=iraq&amp;Cr1=inspect |title=UN news briefing |publisher=Un.org |date=7 March 2003 |accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With war still looming on 24 February 2003, Saddam Hussein took part in [[February 2003 Saddam Hussein interview|an interview]] with [[CBS News]] reporter [[Dan Rather]]. Talking for more than three hours, he denied possessing any [[weapons of mass destruction]], or any other weapons prohibited by [[U.N.]] guidelines. He also expressed a wish to have a live televised debate with [[George W. Bush]], which was declined. It was his first interview with a U.S. reporter in over a decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/02/24/eveningnews/main541817.shtml |title=Behind The Scenes With Saddam |publisher=CBS News |date=24 February 2003 |accessdate=31 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; CBS aired the taped interview later that week. Saddam Hussein later told an FBI interviewer that he once left open the possibility that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction in order to appear strong against Iran.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2009/07/02/us-iran-saddam-idUSTRE56113O20090702 |title=FBI says Saddam's weapons bluff aimed at Iran |publisher=Reuters |date=2 July 2009 |accessdate=8 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iraqi government and military collapsed within three weeks of the beginning of the U.S.-led [[2003 invasion of Iraq]] on 20 March. By the beginning of April, U.S.-led forces occupied much of Iraq. The resistance of the much-weakened Iraqi Army either crumbled or shifted to [[guerrilla]] tactics, and it appeared that Saddam had lost control of Iraq. He was last seen in a video which purported to show him in the Baghdad suburbs surrounded by supporters. When Baghdad fell to U.S-led forces on 9 April, marked symbolically by the [[Firdos Square statue destruction|toppling of his statue]] by [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/art.php?id=7107 | title=Smashing statues through the ages | publisher=[[Socialist Worker]] | accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saddam was nowhere to be found.

In April 2003, Saddam's whereabouts remained in question during the weeks following the fall of Baghdad and the conclusion of the major fighting of the war. Various sightings of Saddam were reported in the weeks following the war, but none was authenticated. At various times Saddam released audio tapes promoting popular resistance to his ousting.

Saddam was placed at the top of the U.S. list of &quot;[[U.S. list of most-wanted Iraqis|most-wanted Iraqis]]&quot;. In July 2003, his sons [[Uday Hussein|Uday]] and [[Qusai Hussein|Qusay]] and 14-year-old grandson [[Mustapha Hussein|Mustapha]] were killed in a three-hour&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,,1004168,00.html |title = Dead: the sons of Saddam | accessdate =16 July 2008 |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date = 23 July 2003 |author=Julian Borger and Gary Younge }}&lt;/ref&gt; gunfight with U.S. forces.

On 13 December 2003, Saddam Hussein was captured by American forces at a farmhouse in [[ad-Dawr]] near Tikrit in a hole in [[Operation Red Dawn]]. Following his capture on 13 December Saddam was transported to a U.S. base near Tikrit, and later taken to the American base near Baghdad. The day after his capture he was reportedly visited by longtime opponents such as [[Ahmed Chalabi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

On 14 December 2003, U.S. administrator in Iraq [[L. Paul Bremer]] confirmed that Saddam Hussein had indeed been captured at a farmhouse in [[ad-Dawr]] near Tikrit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/12/14/sprj.irq.saddam.operation/ |title = Saddam 'caught like a rat' in a hole |accessdate =16 July 2008 | date=14 December 2003 |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bremer presented video footage of Saddam in custody.

Saddam was shown with a full beard and hair longer than his familiar appearance. He was described by U.S. officials as being in good health. Bremer reported plans to put Saddam on trial, but claimed that the details of such a trial had not yet been determined. Iraqis and Americans who spoke with Saddam after his capture generally reported that he remained self-assured, describing himself as a &quot;firm, but just leader.&quot;{{Citation needed|reason=please give a source for this assertion and quote.|date=May 2011}}

British tabloid newspaper ''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' posted a picture of Saddam wearing white briefs on the front cover of a newspaper. Other photographs inside the paper show Saddam washing his trousers, shuffling, and sleeping. The [[United States government]] stated that it considers the release of the pictures a violation of the [[Geneva Convention]], and that it would investigate the photographs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4565505.stm Saddam underwear photo angers U.S.] BBC May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/WORLD/meast/05/20/saddam.photos/|publisher=CNN|title=Pentagon vows to probe Saddam photos|date=21 May 2005|accessdate=22 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guards at the Baghdad detention facility called their prisoner &quot;Vic,&quot; and let him plant a little garden near his cell. The nickname and the garden are among the details about the former Iraqi leader that emerged during a 27 March 2008 tour of prison of the [[Baghdad]] cell where Saddam slept, bathed, and kept a journal in the final days before his execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://edition.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/03/27/hussein.journal/index.html |title = Tour of prison reveals the last days of Saddam Hussein&amp;nbsp;— CNN.com |accessdate =16 July 2008 | date=27 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trial===
{{Main|Trial of Saddam Hussein}}
[[Image:Saddam Hussein at trial, July 2004-edit1.JPEG|thumb|250px|Saddam speaking at a pre-trial hearing]]
On 30 June 2004, Saddam Hussein, held in custody by U.S. forces at the U.S. base &quot;[[Camp Cropper]]&quot;, along with 11 other senior [[Ba'athist]] leaders, were handed over legally (though not physically) to the interim Iraqi government to stand trial for [[crimes against humanity]] and other offences.

A few weeks later, he was charged by the [[Iraqi Special Tribunal]] with crimes committed against residents of [[Dujail]] in 1982, following a failed assassination attempt against him. Specific charges included the murder of 148 people, [[torture]] of women and children and the illegal arrest of 399 others.&lt;ref name=&quot;HRW1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| date = 19 November 2006 | title = Judging Dujail | work=[[Human Rights Watch]] | url = http://www.hrw.org/en/node/11112/section/1 | accessdate =14 December 2009 }}&lt;br /&gt;393 members of the pro Iranian Dawa Party (a banned organisation) were arrested as suspects of which 148, including ten children, confessed to taking part in the plot. It is believed more than 40 suspects died during interrogation or while in detention. Those arrested who were found not guilty were either exiled if relatives of the convicted or released and returned to Dujail. Only 96 of the 148 condemned were actually executed, two of the condemned were accidentally released while a third was mistakenly transferred to another prison and survived. The 96 executed included four men mistakenly executed after having been found not guilty and ordered released. The ten children were originally believed to have been among the 96 executed, but they had in fact been imprisoned near the city of Samawah.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Saddam-Formally-Charged-23683.shtml | title=Saddam Formally Charged | publisher=Softpedia | date=15 May 2006 | accessdate=2 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Main|Dujail Massacre}}
Among the many challenges of the trial were:
*Saddam and his lawyers' contesting the court's authority and maintaining that he was still the [[President of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,187923,00.html |title=Judge Closes Trial During Saddam Testimony |publisher=Fox News |date=15 March 2006 |accessdate=31 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The assassinations and attempts on the lives of several of Saddam's lawyers.
*The replacement of the chief presiding judge, midway through the trial.

On 5 November 2006, Saddam Hussein was found guilty of crimes against humanity and [[death penalty|sentenced to death]] by hanging. Saddam's half brother, [[Barzan Ibrahim]], and [[Awad Hamed al-Bandar]], head of Iraq's Revolutionary Court in 1982, were convicted of similar charges. The verdict and sentencing were both appealed, but subsequently affirmed by Iraq's Supreme Court of Appeals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/26/AR2006122600297_pf.html | title=Iraq court upholds Saddam death sentence |agency=Reuters   | date=26 December 2006 | accessdate=12 November 2008 | author=Mariam Karouny and Ibon Villelabeitia | work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 December 2006, Saddam was [[execution of Saddam Hussein|hanged]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCexecution&quot;/&gt;

==Execution==
{{Main|Execution of Saddam Hussein}}
Saddam was hanged on the first day of [[Eid al-Adha|Eid ul-Adha]], 30 December 2006, despite his wish to be shot (which he felt would be more dignified).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30000-1228824,00.html | title = &quot;I Want a Firing Squad&quot;, Web | author=Sky News | date = 5 November 2006 | accessdate =7 March 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071011232542/http://news.sky.com/skynews/article/0,,30000-1228824,00.html |archivedate = 11 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The execution was carried out at [[Camp Justice, Kadhimiya|Camp Justice]], an Iraqi army base in [[Kadhimiya]], a neighborhood of northeast Baghdad.

The execution was videotaped on a mobile phone and his captors could be heard insulting Saddam. The video was leaked to electronic media and posted on the Internet within hours, becoming the subject of global controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/20070102/saddam-web-tv.htm | title = Saddam Execution Images Shown on TV, Web | author=Bauder, David | work=International Business Times |date=2 January 2007 | accessdate =2 January 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080205073754/http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/20070102/saddam-web-tv.htm |archivedate = 5 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later claimed by the head guard at the tomb where his body remains that Saddam's body was stabbed six times after the execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/iraq/article5058550.ece| title = Saddam Hussein's body was stabbed in the back, says guard | author=Haynes, Deborah | work=The Times |date=1 November 2008 | accessdate =1 November 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not long before the execution, Saddam's lawyers released his last letter. The following includes several excerpts:

{{cquote2|To the great nation, to the people of our country, and humanity,

Many of you have known the writer of this letter to be faithful, honest, caring for others, wise, of sound judgment, just, decisive, careful with the wealth of the people and the state&amp;nbsp;... and that his heart is big enough to embrace all without discrimination.

You have known your brother and leader very well and he never bowed to the despots and, in accordance with the wishes of those who loved him, remained a sword and a banner.

This is how you want your brother, son or leader to be&amp;nbsp;... and those who will lead you (in the future) should have the same qualifications.

Here, I offer my soul to God as a sacrifice, and if He wants, He will send it to heaven with the martyrs, or, He will postpone that&amp;nbsp;... so let us be patient and depend on Him against the unjust nations.

Remember that God has enabled you to become an example of love, forgiveness and brotherly coexistence&amp;nbsp;... I call on you not to hate, because hate does not leave a space for a person to be fair and it makes you blind and closes all doors of thinking and keeps away one from balanced thinking and making the right choice.

I also call on you not to hate the peoples of the other countries that attacked us and differentiate between the decision-makers and peoples. Anyone who repents&amp;nbsp;— whether in Iraq or abroad&amp;nbsp;— you must forgive him.

You should know that among the aggressors, there are people who support your struggle against the invaders, and some of them volunteered for the legal defence of prisoners, including Saddam
Hussein&amp;nbsp;... some of these people wept profusely when they said goodbye to me.

Dear faithful people, I say goodbye to you, but I will be with the merciful God who helps those who take refuge in him and who will never disappoint any faithful, honest believer&amp;nbsp;... God is Great&amp;nbsp;... God is great&amp;nbsp;... Long live our nation&amp;nbsp;... Long live our great struggling people&amp;nbsp;... Long live Iraq, long live Iraq&amp;nbsp;... Long live Palestine&amp;nbsp;... Long live jihad and the mujahedeen.

Saddam Hussein
President and Commander in Chief of the Iraqi Mujahed Armed Forces

Additional clarification note:

I have written this letter, because the lawyers told me that the so-called criminal court&amp;nbsp;— established and named by the invaders&amp;nbsp;— will allow the so-called defendants the chance for a last word. But that court and its chief judge did not give us the chance to say a word, and issued its verdict without explanation and read out the sentence&amp;nbsp;— dictated by the invaders&amp;nbsp;— without presenting the evidence. I wanted the people to know this.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hussein's last letter&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/dailytelegraph/story/0,22049,20990518-5001021,00.html | title=Saddam's final words |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK | date=30 December 2006 | accessdate=12 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|Letter by Saddam Hussein}}

A second unofficial video, apparently showing Saddam's body on a trolley, emerged several days later. It sparked speculation that the execution was carried out incorrectly as Saddam Hussein had a gaping hole in his neck.&lt;ref name=&quot;newvideo&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/09/AR2007010900258.html | title = New Video of Saddam's Corpse on Internet | author=Qassum Abdul-Zahra | agency=Associated Press |date= 9 January 2007 | accessdate =9 January 2006 | work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saddam was buried at his birthplace of [[Al-Awja]] in Tikrit, Iraq, 3&amp;nbsp;km (2&amp;nbsp;mi) from his sons [[Uday Hussein|Uday]] and [[Qusay Hussein]], on 31 December 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;burial&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11669236/ | title=Tribal chief: Saddam buried in native village |agency=Reuters   | date=30 December 2006 | accessdate=30 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sajida is the daughter of Khairallah Talfah, Saddam's uncle and mentor. Their marriage was arranged for Hussein at age five when Sajida was seven. They were married in [[Egypt]] during his exile. The couple had five children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheri &amp; Bob Stritof&quot;/&gt;
:*[[Uday Hussein]] (18 June 1964 – 22 July 2003), was Saddam's oldest son, who ran the [[Iraqi Football Association]], [[Fedayeen Saddam]], and several media corporations in Iraq including [[Iraqi TV]] and the newspaper ''[[Babel (newspaper)|Babel]]''. Uday, while originally Saddam's favorite son and raised to succeed him he eventually fell out of favour with his father due to his erratic behavior; he was responsible for many car crashes and rapes around Baghdad, constant feuds with other members of his family, and killing his father's favorite valet and food taster [[Kamel Hana Gegeo]] at a party in Egypt honoring Egyptian first lady [[Suzanne Mubarak]]. He became well known in the west for his involvement in looting Kuwait during the Gulf War, allegedly taking millions of dollars worth of gold, cars, and medical supplies (which were in short supply at the time) for himself and close supporters. He was widely known for his paranoia and his obsession with torturing people who disappointed him in any way, which included tardy girlfriends, friends who disagreed with him and, most notoriously, Iraqi athletes who performed poorly. He was briefly married to [[Izzat Ibrahim ad-Douri]]'s daughter, but later divorced her. The couple had no children.

:*[[Qusay Hussein]] (17 May 1966 – 22 July 2003), was Saddam's second&amp;nbsp;— and, after the mid-1990s, his favorite&amp;nbsp;— son. Qusay was believed to have been Saddam's later intended successor, as he was less erratic than his older brother and kept a low profile. He was second in command of the military (behind his father) and ran the elite [[Iraqi Republican Guard]] and the [[Iraqi Special Security Organization|SSO]]. He was believed to have ordered the army to kill thousands of rebelling [[Marsh Arabs]] and was instrumental in suppressing Shi'ite rebellions in the mid-1990s. He was married once and had three children.

:*[[Raghad Hussein]] (born 2 September 1968) is Saddam's oldest daughter. After the war, Raghad fled to [[Amman]], Jordan where she received sanctuary from the royal family. She is currently wanted by the [[Iraqi Government]] for allegedly financing and supporting the insurgency and the now banned Iraqi Ba'ath Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/02/iraq.main/ |publisher=CNN | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=July 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://euronews.net/create_html.php?page=detail_info&amp;article=366962&amp;lng=1 ]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jordanian royal family refused to hand her over.

:*[[Rana Hussein]] (born c. 1969), is Saddam's second daughter. She, like her sister, fled to Jordan and has stood up for her father's rights. She was married to [[Saddam Kamel]] and has had four children from this marriage.

:*[[Hala Hussein]] (born c. 1972), is Saddam's third and youngest daughter. Very little information is known about her. Her father arranged for her to marry General Kamal Mustafa Abdallah Sultan al-Tikriti in 1998. She fled with her children and sisters to [[Jordan]].
*Saddam married his second wife, [[Samira Shahbandar]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheri &amp; Bob Stritof&quot;/&gt; in 1986. She was originally the wife of an [[Iraqi Airways]] executive, but later became the mistress of Saddam. Eventually, Saddam forced Samira's husband to divorce her so he could marry her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheri &amp; Bob Stritof&quot;/&gt; There have been no political issues from this marriage. After the war, Samira fled to [[Beirut]], Lebanon. She is believed to have mothered Hussein's sixth child.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sheri &amp; Bob Stritof&quot;/&gt; Members of Hussein's family have denied this.
*Saddam had allegedly married a third wife, [[Nidal al-Hamdani]], the general manager of the Solar Energy Research Center in the Council of Scientific Research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.news.com.au/sundayheraldsun/story/0,,20999268-5006029,00.html| title=Saddam's billions|publisher=The Herald Sun |date=2 January 2007 |accessdate=6 January 2007 |author=Michael Harvey}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Wafa el-Mullah al-Howeish]] is rumoured to have married Saddam as his fourth wife in 2002. There is no firm evidence for this marriage. Wafa is the daughter of Abdul Tawab el-Mullah Howeish, a former minister of military industry in Iraq and Saddam's last deputy Prime Minister.

In August 1995, Raghad and her husband [[Hussein Kamel al-Majid]] and Rana and her husband, [[Saddam Kamel|Saddam Kamel al-Majid]], defected to [[Jordan]], taking their children with them. They returned to Iraq when they received assurances that Saddam would pardon them. Within three days of their return in February 1996, both of the Kamel brothers were attacked and killed in a gunfight with other clan members who considered them traitors.

In August 2003, Saddam's daughters Raghad and Rana received sanctuary in [[Amman]], Jordan, where they are currently staying with their nine children. That month, they spoke with [[CNN]] and the Arab satellite station [[Al-Arabiya]] in Amman. When asked about her father, Raghad told CNN, &quot;He was a very good father, loving, has a big heart.&quot; Asked if she wanted to give a message to her father, she said: &quot;I love you and I miss you.&quot; Her sister Rana also remarked, &quot;He had so many feelings and he was very tender with all of us.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;daughtersinterview&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-08-01-saddams-daughters_x.htm | title=Saddam's daughters express love for dad |work=USA Today | date=1 August 2003 | accessdate=31 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
