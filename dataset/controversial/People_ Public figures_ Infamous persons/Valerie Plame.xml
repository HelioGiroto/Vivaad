'''Valerie Elise Plame Wilson''' (born April 19, 1963), known as '''Valerie Plame''', '''Valerie E. Wilson''', and '''Valerie Plame Wilson''', is a former [[United States]] [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] [[National Clandestine Service#NCS_Officers|Operations Officer]] and the author of a memoir detailing her career and the events leading up to her resignation from the CIA.

==Early life==
Valerie Elise Plame was born on April 19, 1963, on [[Elmendorf Air Force Base]], in [[Anchorage, Alaska]], to Diane (née McClintock) and Samuel Plame III.&lt;ref name=GTN/&gt;&lt;ref name=APbio&gt;[[Associated Press]], [http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001392451 &quot;The Real Valerie Plame&quot;], reposted in ''[[Editor and Publisher]]'', May 30, 2005, accessed August 12, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson Fair Game pg. 314&lt;/ref&gt; Plame's paternal grandfather was Jewish, the son of a [[rabbi]] who emigrated from [[Ukraine]]; the original family surname was &quot;Plamevotski&quot;.&lt;ref name=wislfa1&gt;Wilson Fair Game pg. 173&lt;/ref&gt; Plame was raised in her paternal grandmother's and mother's Protestant religion, and was unaware of her grandfather's ancestry until she was an adult.&lt;ref name=wislfa1/&gt;

She was reared in &quot;a military family ... imbued her with a sense of public duty&quot;; her father was a lieutenant colonel in the [[United States Air Force]], who worked for the [[National Security Agency]] for three years, and, according to her close friend Janet Angstadt, her parents &quot;are the type who are still volunteering for the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]] and [[Meals on Wheels]] in the [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] suburb where they live,&quot; having moved to that area while Plame was still in school.&lt;ref name=VanityFair&gt;{{cite web | first = Vicky | last = Ward | url = http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/features/2004/01/plame200401?printable=true&amp;currentPage=all | title = Double Exposure | publisher = ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' | date = January 2004 | archiveurl = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-6240455_ITM | archivedate = 2004-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
She graduated in 1981 from [[Lower Moreland Township School District|Lower Moreland High School]], in [[Huntingdon Valley, Pennsylvania]],&lt;ref name=Spivak&gt;Rachel Spivak, [http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2003/10/10-09-03tdc/10-09-03dnews-08.asp &quot;CIA Agent Linked to Collegian&quot;], ''The Daily Collegian Online'', October 9, 2003, accessed December 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goffard&gt;Christopher Goffard, [http://www.tampabay.com/SearchForwardServlet.do?articleId=258941 &quot;Valerie Plame: Smart, Private, 'Waltons' Fan&quot;], ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'', ''tampabay.com'', August 8, 2005, accessed June 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and attended [[Pennsylvania State University]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in advertising in 1985.&lt;ref name=VanityFair/&gt;  While a student at Penn State, she joined [[Pi Beta Phi]] [[Fraternities and sororities|sorority]]&lt;ref name=FG&gt;&quot;[[Fair Game: My Life as a Spy, My Betrayal by the White House]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; and worked for the business division of the ''[[The Daily Collegian (Pennsylvania)|Daily Collegian]]'' [[student newspaper]].&lt;ref name=VanityFair/&gt;

By 1991, Plame had earned two [[master's degree]]s, one from the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]] and in 1995 one from the [[College of Europe]] (Collège d'Europe), in [[Bruges]], [[Belgium]].&lt;ref name=GTN/&gt;&lt;ref name=VanityFair/&gt;  In addition to [[English language|English]], she speaks [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], and [[Modern Greek|Greek]].&lt;ref name=VanityFair/&gt;

==Marriages and family==
After graduating from Penn State in 1985, Plame was briefly married to Todd Sesler, her college boyfriend.&lt;ref name=VanityFair/&gt;  In 1997, while she was working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA), Plame met former Ambassador [[Joseph C. Wilson|Joseph C. Wilson, IV]] &quot;at a reception in Washington &quot;...&quot; at the residence of the [[Turkey|Turkish]] Ambassador.&quot;&lt;ref name=WilsonPolitics&gt;Joseph C. Wilson, ''[[The Politics of Truth]]: Inside the Lies that Led to War and Betrayed my Wife's CIA Identity: A Diplomat's Memoir'' (2004; New York: Carroll &amp; Graf, 2005) 240–42.  (Additional page references appear within parentheses in the text.)&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Wilson, because Plame was unable to reveal her [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] role to him on their first date, she told him that she was an energy trader in [[Brussels]], and he thought at that time that she was &quot;an up-and-coming international executive.&quot;&lt;ref name=Goffard/&gt;  After they began dating and became &quot;close,&quot; Plame revealed her employment with the CIA to Wilson.&lt;ref name=Goffard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Politics of Truth'' 242&lt;/ref&gt;  They were married on April 3, 1998, Plame's second marriage and Wilson's third.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, ''Politics of Truth'' 273&lt;/ref&gt;

Professionally and socially, she has used variants of her name.  Professionally, while a [[Non-official cover|covert]] CIA officer, she used her given first name and her maiden surname, &quot;Valerie Plame.&quot;  Since leaving the CIA, as a speaker, she has used the name &quot;Valerie Plame Wilson,&quot; and she is referred to by that name in the [[civil suit]] that the Wilsons brought against former and current government officials, ''Plame v. Cheney''.&lt;ref name=GTN&gt;[http://www.greatertalent.com/speakers/speakers.php?speakerid=649 &quot;Valerie Plame Wilson:] 'Outed' Former CIA Agent: Exclusive Representation by Greater Talent Network&quot;.  Accessed July 10, 2007. (Official biography listed in Speaker's Bureau of [http://www.greatertalent.com/ Greater Talent Network Inc.]).&lt;/ref&gt;  Socially, and in public records of her political contributions, since her marriage in 1998, she has used the name &quot;Valerie E. Wilson.&quot;

At the time that they met, Wilson relates in his memoir, he was [[Legal separation|separated]] from his second wife Jacqueline, a former [[French people|French]] diplomat; they [[divorce]]d after 12 years of marriage so that he could marry Plame. His divorce had been &quot;delayed because I was never in one place long enough to complete the process,&quot; though he and she had already been living separate lives since the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name=WilsonPolitics/&gt;  Plame and Wilson are the parents of twins, Trevor Rolph, and Samantha Finnell Diana, born in January 2000. From his first marriage (1973–1986), to Susan Dale Otchis, Wilson is also the father of another set of twins (also a boy and a girl), Sabrina Cecile and Joseph Charles, who were born in 1979.

Prior to the disclosure of her classified CIA identity, Valerie and Joe Wilson and their twins lived in [[The Palisades, Washington, D.C.|the Palisades]], an affluent neighborhood of [[Washington, D.C.]], on the fringe of [[Georgetown, Washington, D.C.|Georgetown]].&lt;ref name=VanityFair/&gt;  After she resigned from the CIA following the disclosure of her covert status, in January 2006, they moved to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name=WilsonIndependent&gt;Andrew Buncombe and [[Joseph C.

In his press conference of October 28, 2005, Special Prosecutor [[Patrick Fitzgerald]] explained in considerable detail the necessity of secrecy about his [[grand jury]] investigation that began in the fall of 2003 &amp;mdash; &quot;when it was clear that Valerie Wilson's cover had been blown&quot; &amp;mdash; and the background and consequences of the [[indictment]] of then high-ranking Bush Administration official [[Lewis Libby]] as it pertains to Valerie E. Wilson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fitzgeraldpress&quot; /&gt;

Fitzgerald's subsequent replies to reporters' questions shed further light on the parameters of the leak investigation and what, as its lead prosecutor, bound by the rules of grand jury secrecy, he could and could not reveal legally at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fitzgeraldpress&quot; /&gt; Official court documents released later, on April 5, 2006, reveal that Libby testified that &quot;he was specifically authorized in advance&quot; of his meeting with ''[[New York Times]]'' reporter [[Judith Miller (journalist)|Judith Miller]] to disclose the &quot;key judgments&quot; of the October 2002 [[Classified information|classified]] [[National Intelligence Estimate]] (NIE).

A court filing by Libby's defense team argued that Plame was not foremost in the minds of administration officials as they sought to rebut charges – made by her husband – that the White House manipulated intelligence to make a case for invasion. The filing indicated that Libby's lawyers did not intend to say that he was told to reveal Plame's identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/news/nationalnews/62399.htm &quot;'Scooter' Won't Play Plame Blame Game&quot;], ''[[New York Post]]'', April 14, 2006, accessed July 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The court filing also stated that &quot;Mr. Libby plans to demonstrate that the indictment is wrong when it suggests that he and other government officials viewed Ms. Wilson's role in sending her husband to [[Africa]] as important,&quot; indicating that Libby's lawyers planned to call [[Karl Rove]] to the stand. According to Rove's lawyer, Fitzgerald has decided against pressing charges against Rove.&lt;ref name=Solomon&gt;John Solomon, [http://www.breitbart.com/news/2006/06/13/D8I7C7N00.html &quot;Rove Won't Be Charged in CIA Leak Case&quot;], ''[[Newsweek]], June 13, 2006, accessed July 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The five-count indictment of Libby included [[perjury]] (two counts), [[obstruction of justice]] (one count), and [[making false statements]] to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|federal investigators]] (two counts).

===Libby trial===
{{main|United States v. Libby}}
On March 6, 2007, Libby was convicted of obstruction of justice, making false statements, and two counts of perjury. He was [[acquittal|acquitted]] on one count of making false statements. He was not charged for revealing Plame's CIA status. His sentence included a $250,000 fine, 30 months in prison and two years of probation. On July 2, 2007, President [[George W. Bush]] [[commutation of sentence|commuted]] Libby's sentence, removing the jail term but leaving in place the fine and [[probation]], calling the sentence &quot;excessive.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/07/20070702-4.html Grant of Executive Clemency]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/07/20070702-3.html Statement by the President on Executive Clemency for Lewis Libby]&lt;/ref&gt;  In a subsequent press conference, on July 12, 2007, Bush noted, &quot;...the Scooter Libby decision was, I thought, a fair and balanced decision.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/07/20070712-5.html Press Conference by the President], July 12, 2007, accessed August 11, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Wilsons responded to the commutation in statements posted by their legal counsel, [[Melanie Sloan]], executive director of [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW), and on their own legal support website.{{See also|Joseph C.

===House Oversight Committee hearing===
On March 8, 2007, two days after the verdict in the [[United States v. Libby|Libby trial]], Congressman [[Henry Waxman]], chair of the [[U.S. House Committee on Government Reform]], announced that his committee would ask Plame to testify on March 16, in an effort by his committee to look into &quot;whether White House officials followed appropriate procedures for safeguarding Plame's identity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Reuters]], [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/09/AR2007030900549.html &quot;Plame to Testify to Congress on Leak&quot;], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', March 9, 2007, accessed March 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oversight&gt;[http://oversight.house.gov/story.asp?ID=1205 &quot;Disclosure of CIA Identity&quot;], online posting, [[U.S. House Committee on Government Reform]], ''oversight.house.gov'', March 16, 2007, accessed March 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 16, 2007, at these hearings about the disclosure, Waxman read a statement about Plame's CIA career that had been cleared by [[Director of Central Intelligence|CIA director]] Gen. [[Michael Hayden (general)|Michael V. Hayden]] and the CIA, stating that she was undercover and that her employment status with the CIA was classified information prohibited from disclosure under [[Executive Order 12958]]. 

Subsequent reports in various news accounts focused on the following parts of her testimony:

In May 2006, the ''New York Times'' reported that Valerie Wilson agreed to a $2.5-million book deal with [[Crown Publishing Group]], a division of [[Random House]]. Steve Ross, senior vice president and publisher of Crown, told the Times that the book would be her &quot;first airing of her actual role in the American intelligence community, as well as the prominence of her role in the lead-up to the war.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rich1&gt;Motoko Rich, [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/05/books/05cnd-plame.html &quot;Valerie Plame Gets Book Deal&quot;], ''[[New York Times]]'', May 5, 2006, accessed July 15, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the ''New York Times'' reported that the book deal fell through and that Plame was in exclusive negotiations with [[Simon &amp; Schuster]].&lt;ref name=Rich2&gt;Motoko Rich, [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/01/books/01plam.html?hp&amp;ex=1149220800&amp;en=79440cf211d66068&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage|title=Valerie Plame Gets Book Deal&quot;], ''[[New York Times]]'', June 1, 2006, accessed June 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Simon and Schuster publicly confirmed the book deal, though not the financial terms and, at first, no set publication date.&lt;ref name=Corn/&gt;&lt;ref name=Italie&gt;Hillel Italie ([[Associated Press]]), [http://www.mercurynews.com/mld/mercurynews/entertainment/gossip/15032040.htm &quot;Ex-CIA Officer Finds New Memoir Publisher&quot;], ''[[The Mercury News]]'' July 13, 2006, accessed July 15, 2006.

Therefore, the ruling stated that Plame would not be able to describe in her memoir the precise dates she had worked for the CIA. In 2009, the federal court of appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed Judge Jones's ruling.

On October 31, 2007, in her interview with [[Charlie Rose]] broadcast on ''[[The Charlie Rose Show]]'' , Valerie Wilson discussed many aspects relating to her memoir: the [[CIA leak grand jury investigation]]; ''United States v. Libby,'' the civil suit which she and her husband are still pursuing against Libby, Cheney, Rove, and Armitage; and other matters presented in her memoir relating to her covert work with the CIA.&lt;ref name=RoseWilson&gt;[[Charlie Rose]], [http://www.charlierose.com/shows/2007/10/31/2/a-conversation-with-valerie-plame-wilson &quot;A Conversation with Valerie Plame Wilson&quot;], ''[[The Charlie Rose Show]],'' [[PBS]], [[WNET]] (New York), recorded October 29, 2007, broadcast October 31, 2007, 12:30 a.m. ET-1:00 a.m. ET, accessed November 6, 2007 (video clip).&lt;/ref&gt;

The film, [[Fair Game (2010 film)|''Fair Game'']], was released November 5, 2010, starring [[Naomi Watts]] and [[Sean Penn]].
