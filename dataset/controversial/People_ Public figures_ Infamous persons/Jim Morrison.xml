'''James Douglas &quot;Jim&quot; Morrison''' (December 8, 1943&amp;nbsp;– July 3, 1971) was an [[United States|American]] [[singer-songwriter]] and [[poetry|poet]], best remembered as the [[lead singer]] of [[Los Angeles|Angeleno]] [[Rock music|rock]] band [[The Doors]].&lt;ref name=&quot;climate&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6316743.stm ''See e.g.'', Morrison poem backs climate plea]&quot;, ''[[BBC News]]'', January 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Following The Doors' explosive rise to fame in 1967, Morrison developed a severe alcohol and drug dependency that culminated in his [[27 Club|death at the age of 27]] in Paris.  He is alleged to have died of a [[heroin overdose]], but as no autopsy was performed, the exact cause of his death is still disputed.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday.com&quot;&gt;http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2007-07-11-morrison-questions_N.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrison was well known for often improvising [[spoken word]] poetry passages while the band played live. Due to his wild personality and performances, he is regarded by critics and fans as one of the most iconic, charismatic and pioneering frontmen in rock music history.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Huey. [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/jim-morrison-p13722/biography Jim Morrison: Biography]. [[Allmusic]].&lt;/ref&gt; Morrison was ranked number 47 on ''[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone's]]'' list of the &quot;100 Greatest Singers of All Time&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-singers-of-all-time-19691231/jim-morrison-19691231 |title=100 Greatest Singers: Jim Morrison |work=Rolling Stone |accessdate=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and number 22 on ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock Magazine's]]'' &quot;50 Greatest Singers In Rock&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;May 2009. ''[[Classic Rock (magazine)|Classic Rock Magazine]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

James Douglas Morrison was born in [[Melbourne, Florida]], to future [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[George Stephen Morrison]] and Clara Morrison. Morrison had a sister, Anne Robin, who was born in 1947 in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]; and a brother, Andrew Lee Morrison, who was born in 1948 in [[Los Altos, California]]. He was of [[Irish people|Irish]] and [[Scottish people|Scottish]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/1930:2450/1/Jim_Morrison.htm Dead Famous: Jim Morrison].&quot; ''[[The Biography Channel]]''. Retrieved December 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1947, Morrison, then four years old, allegedly witnessed a car accident in the [[desert]], in which a family of Native Americans were injured and possibly killed. He referred to this incident in a spoken word performance on the song &quot;Dawn's Highway&quot; from the album ''[[An American Prayer]]'', and again in the songs &quot;[[Peace Frog]]&quot; and &quot;[[Ghost Song]].&quot;

Morrison believed this incident to be the most formative event of his life,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Davis |first=Stephen |title=Jim Morrison: Life, Death, Legend |publisher=[[Ebury Press]] |year=2004 | page=8 |quote=It was the first time I discovered death, he recounted many years later, as the tape rolled in a darkened West Hollywood Recording studio. |isbn=978-0-09-190042-7 | postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; and made repeated references to it in the imagery in his songs, poems, and interviews. His family does not recall this incident happening in the way he told it. According to the Morrison biography ''[[No One Here Gets Out Alive]]'', Morrison's family did drive past a car accident on an [[Indian reservation]] when he was a child, and he was very upset by it. The book ''The Doors'', written by the remaining members of The Doors, explains how different Morrison's account of the incident was from the account of his father. This book quotes his father as saying, &quot;We went by several Indians. It did make an impression on him [the young James]. He always thought about that crying Indian.&quot; This is contrasted sharply with Morrison's tale of &quot;Indians scattered all over the highway, bleeding to death.&quot; In the same book, his sister is quoted as saying, &quot;He enjoyed telling that story and exaggerating it. He said he saw a dead Indian by the side of the road, and I don't even know if that's true.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

With his father in the [[United States Navy]], Morrison's family moved often. He spent part of his childhood in San Diego. While his father was stationed at NAS Kingsville, he attended Flato Elementary in Kingsville, Texas{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}.  In 1958 Morrison attended [[Alameda High School]] in [[Alameda, California]]. He graduated from George Washington High School (now [[George Washington Middle School (Virginia)|George Washington Middle School]]) in [[Alexandria, Virginia]] in June 1961{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. His father was also stationed at [[Naval Station Mayport|Mayport Naval Air Station]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}.

Morrison was inspired by the writings of philosophers and poets. He was influenced by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], whose views on aesthetics, morality, and the [[Apollonian and Dionysian]] duality would appear in his conversation, poetry and songs{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. He read [[Plutarch]]’s &quot;[[Parallel Lives|Lives of the Noble Greeks and Romans]]&quot;.  He read the works of the French [[Symbolist]] poet [[Arthur Rimbaud]], whose style would later influence the form of Morrison’s short prose poems{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. He was influenced by [[Jack Kerouac]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[Lawrence Ferlinghetti]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Molière]] and [[Franz Kafka]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. [[Honoré de Balzac]] and [[Jean Cocteau]], along with most of the French [[existentialism|existentialist]] philosophers{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. His senior-year English teacher said that, &quot;Jim read as much and probably more than any student in class, but everything he read was so offbeat I had another teacher, who was going to the [[Library of Congress]], check to see if the books Jim was reporting on actually existed. I suspected he was making them up, as they were English books on sixteenth- and seventeenth-century [[demonology]]. I’d never heard of them, but they existed, and I’m convinced from the paper he wrote that he read them, and the Library of Congress would’ve been the only source.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Hopkins |coauthors= Jerry and Daniel Sugerman |title= [[No One Here Gets Out Alive]] |publisher= [[Warner Books]] |year= 1980 |isbn= 978-0-446-69733-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:JimMorrisonMugShot1963.jpg|thumb|Morrison was arrested in Tallahassee after pulling a prank while drunk at a football game]]
Morrison went to live with his paternal grandparents in [[Clearwater, Florida]], where he attended classes at [[St. Petersburg College]] (then known as a junior college). In 1962, he transferred to [[Florida State University]] (FSU) in [[Tallahassee, Florida|Tallahassee]], where he appeared in a school recruitment film.&lt;ref name=&quot;fsufilm&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Florida State University: Toward a Greater University |url=http://floridamemory.com/items/show/232390 |accessdate=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; While attending FSU, Morrison was arrested for a prank, following a home [[American football|football]] game.&lt;ref name=&quot;FSU arrest&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=FSU Arrest|url=http://www.americanlegends.com/Interviews/morrison.htm|accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1964, Morrison moved to Los Angeles to attend the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). He enrolled in [[Jack Hirschman]]'s class on [[Antonin Artaud]] in the Comparative Literature program within the UCLA English Department. Artaud's brand of [[surrealist]] theatre had a profound impact on Morrison's dark poetic sensibility of cinematic theatricality{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}.

Morrison completed his undergraduate degree at UCLA's film school within the Theater Arts department of the College of Fine Arts in 1965. He never went to the graduation ceremony, instead having his degree diploma mailed to him{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}.  He made several short films while attending UCLA. ''First Love'', the first of these films, made with Morrison's classmate and roommate Max Schwartz, was released to the public when it appeared in a documentary about the film ''Obscura''. During these years, while living in [[Venice, Los Angeles, California|Venice Beach]], he became friends with writers at the ''[[Los Angeles Free Press]]''. Morrison was an advocate of the underground newspaper until his death in 1971.  He later conducted a lengthy and in-depth interview with Bob Chorush and Andy Kent, both working for the Free Press at the time (January 1971), and was planning on visiting the headquarters of the busy newspaper shortly before leaving for Paris.&lt;ref&gt;Goldsmith, Melissa Ursula Dawn. &quot;Criticism ''Lighting His Fire'': Perspectives on Jim Morrison from the ''[[Los Angeles Free Press]]'', ''[[Down Beat]]'', ''[[The Miami Herald]]'' (master's thesis, Interdepartmental Program in Liberal Arts, [[Louisiana State University]], 2007).

==The Doors==

{{Main|The Doors}}
In the summer of 1965, after graduating with a degree from the UCLA film school, Morrison led a [[bohemianism|bohemian]] lifestyle in Venice Beach. Living on the rooftop of a building inhabited by his old UCLA cinematography friend, Dennis Jakobs, he wrote the lyrics of many of the early songs the Doors would later perform live and record on albums, the most notable being ''&quot;[[Moonlight Drive]]&quot;'' and ''&quot;[[Hello, I Love You]]&quot;''{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}.  According to Jakobs, he lived on canned beans and LSD for several months{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. Morrison and fellow UCLA student, [[Ray Manzarek]], were the first two members of the Doors, forming the group during that same summer of 1965.  They had previously met months earlier as fellow cinematography students.  The now-legendary story claims that Manzarek was lying on the beach at Venice one day, where he accidentally encountered Morrison{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}.  He was impressed with Morrison's poetic lyrics, claiming that they were &quot;rock group&quot; material.  Subsequently, drummer [[John Densmore]] and guitarist [[Robby Krieger]] joined. Krieger auditioned at Densmore's recommendation and was then added to the lineup.  All three musicians shared a common interest in the [[Maharishi Mahesh Yogi]]'s meditation practices at the time, attending scheduled classes, but Morrison was not involved in this series of classes, claiming later that he &quot;did not meditate&quot;{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}.
[[File:Doors electra publicity photo.JPG|thumb|Promotional photo of the Doors in late 1966]]
The Doors took their name from the title of [[Aldous Huxley]]'s book ''[[The Doors of Perception]]'' (a reference to the unlocking of doors of perception through [[psychedelic drug]] use). Huxley's own title was a quotation from [[William Blake]]'s ''[[The Marriage of Heaven and Hell]]'', in which Blake wrote: &quot;If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear to man as it is, infinite.&quot;

Although Morrison was known as the lyricist of the group, Krieger also made significant lyrical contributions, writing or co-writing some of the group's biggest hits, including &quot;[[Light My Fire]]&quot;, &quot;[[Love Me Two Times]]&quot;, &quot;[[Love Her Madly]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Touch Me (The Doors song)|Touch Me]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Getlen |first=Larry |title=Opportunity Knocked So The Doors Kicked It Down |url=http://www.bankrate.com/brm/news/investing/20030616a1.asp |accessdate=2008-08-24 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Morrison, who didn't write most songs using an instrument, would come up with vocal melodies for his own lyrics, with the other band members contributing chords and rhythm nor did he play an instrument live (except for [[maracas]] and [[tambourine]] for most shows, and [[harmonica]] on a few occasions) or in the studio (excluding [[maracas]], [[tambourine]], [[handclaps]], and [[whistling]]). However, he did play the [[grand piano]] on &quot;[[The Lost Paris Tapes|Orange County Suite]]&quot; and a [[Moog synthesizer]] on &quot;[[Strange Days (The Doors song)|Strange Days]]&quot;.

In June 1966, Morrison and the Doors were the opening act at the [[Whisky a Go Go]] on the last week of the residency of [[Van Morrison]]'s band [[Them (band)|Them]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archives.waiting-forthe-sun.net/Pages/Venues/whisky_them.html|author=Lawrence, Paul (2002)|title=The Doors and Them: Twin Morrisons of Different Mothers|publisher=waiting-forthe-sun.net|accessdate=2008-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Van's influence on Jim's developing stage performance was later noted by John Densmore in his book ''Riders On The Storm'': &quot;Jim Morrison learned quickly from his near-namesake's stagecraft, his apparent recklessness, his air of subdued menace, the way he would improvise poetry to a rock beat, even his habit of crouching down by the bass drum  during instrumental breaks.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HintonPage67&quot;&gt;Hinton (1997), page 67.&lt;/ref&gt; On the final night, the two Morrisons and their two bands jammed together on &quot;[[Gloria (Them song)|Gloria]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chickenonaunicycle.com/Whisky-A-Go-Go%20History.htm|author=Corry Arnold|date=2006-01-23|title=The History of the Whisky-A-Go-Go|publisher=chickenonaunicyle.com |accessdate=2008-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VanM&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.harbour.sfu.ca/~hayward/van/glossary/doors.html |title= Glossary entry for The Doors |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070310195120/http://www.harbour.sfu.ca/~hayward/van/glossary/doors.html |archivedate=2007-03-10}} from Van Morrison website.

[[File:Jim Morrison in 1968.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Jim Morrison performing in [[Copenhagen]] in September 1968]]
The Doors achieved national recognition after signing with [[Elektra Records]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Leopold |first=Todd |date=April 20, 2007|title=Confessions of a Record Label Owner |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/SHOWBIZ/Music/04/19/holzman.elektra/index.html |accessdate=November 18, 2010|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single &quot;[[Light My Fire]]&quot; spent three weeks at number one on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] chart in July/August 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/#/charts/hot-100?chartDate=1967-08-12 |title=Billboard.com – Hot 100 – Week of August 12, 1967 |work=Billboard  |accessdate=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Doors appeared on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'', a popular Sunday night variety series that had introduced [[the Beatles]] and [[Elvis Presley]] to the United States. [[Ed Sullivan]] requested two songs from the Doors for the show, &quot;[[People Are Strange]]&quot; and &quot;Light My Fire&quot;. Sullivan's censors insisted that the Doors change the lyrics of the song &quot;Light My Fire&quot; from &quot;Girl we couldn't get much higher&quot; to &quot;Girl we couldn't get much better&quot; for the television viewers; this was reportedly due to what was perceived as a reference to drugs in the original lyrics. After giving assurances of compliance to Sullivan, Morrison then proceeded to sing the song with the original lyrics anyway{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. When Morrison was later asked why he defied Sullivan's instructions to change the lyrics to the song, he flatly said that he simply forgot to make the change{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. This infuriated Sullivan, and he refused to shake hands with Morrison or any other band member after their performance.  He had a show producer tell the band that they will never do ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' again. Morrison reportedly said to the producer, in a defiant tone, &quot;Hey man. We just ''did'' the Sullivan Show!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/the-doors |title=The Doors |publisher=The Ed Sullivan Show (SOFA Entertainment) |accessdate=November 24, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, Morrison and the Doors produced a promotional film for &quot;[[Break on Through (To the Other Side)]]&quot;, which was their first single release. The video featured the four members of the group playing the song on a darkened set with alternating views and close-ups of the performers while Morrison lip-synched the lyrics. Morrison and the Doors continued to make music videos, including &quot;[[The Unknown Soldier (song)|The Unknown Soldier]]&quot;, &quot;[[Moonlight Drive]]&quot;, and &quot;[[People Are Strange]]&quot;.

By the release of their second album, ''[[Strange Days (album)|Strange Days]]'', the Doors had become one of the most popular rock bands in the United States. Their blend of [[blues]] and dark rock tinged with [[psychedelic|psychedelia]] included a number of original songs and distinctive cover versions, such as their rendition of &quot;[[Alabama Song]]&quot;, from [[Bertolt Brecht]] and [[Kurt Weill]]'s opera, ''[[Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny]]''. The band also performed a number of extended concept works, including the songs &quot;[[The End (The Doors song)|The End]]&quot;, &quot;[[When the Music's Over]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Celebration of the Lizard]]&quot;.

In 1967, photographer [[Joel Brodsky]] took a series of [[Photography#Black-and-white|black-and-white]] photos of Morrison, in a photo shoot known as &quot;The Young Lion&quot; photo session. These photographs are considered among the most iconic images of Jim Morrison and are frequently used as covers for compilation albums, books, and other memorabilia of the Doors and Morrison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/music/story/2007/04/02/joel-brodsky.html |title=Album photographer Joel Brodsky dies – Arts &amp; Entertainment |date=April 2, 2007 |publisher=CBC News |accessdate=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sunjournal.com/node/630550 |title=Photographer Brodsky dies |date=April 1, 2007 |publisher=Sun Journal |accessdate=September 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Jimlaughingw-dogs.jpg|left|thumb|150px]] --&gt;
In 1968, the Doors released their third studio album, ''[[Waiting for the Sun]]''. Their fourth album, ''[[The Soft Parade]]'', was released in 1969. It was the first album where the individual band members were given credit on the inner sleeve for the songs they had written. Previously, each song on their albums had been credited simply to &quot;The Doors.&quot;

On September 6 and 7, 1968, the Doors played four performances at The Roundhouse, London, England with Jefferson Airplane which were filmed by Granada for a television documentary  &quot;The Doors are Open&quot; directed by John Sheppard.

Around this time, Morrison—who had long been a heavy drinker—started showing up for recording sessions visibly inebriated{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. He was also frequently late for live performances. As a result, the band would play instrumental music or force Manzarek to take on the singing duties to subdue the impatient audience.

[[File:Jim Morrison performing 1967.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Performing with The Doors, 1967]] 
 
By 1969, the formerly svelte singer had gained weight, grown a beard and mustache, and had begun dressing more casually—abandoning the leather pants and concho belts for slacks, jeans and T-shirts.

During a March 1, 1969 concert at the [[Dinner Key Auditorium]] in Miami, Morrison attempted to spark a riot in the audience. He failed, but a [[arrest warrant|warrant]] for his arrest was issued by the [[Miami-Dade Police Department|Dade County Police department]] three days later for [[indecent exposure]]. Consequently, many of The Doors' scheduled concerts were canceled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Doors: Biography: Rolling Stone |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thedoors/biography |accessdate=2008-08-24 |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Following ''[[The Soft Parade]]'', The Doors released ''[[Morrison Hotel]]''. After a lengthy break the group reconvened in October 1970 to record what would become their final album with Morrison, entitled ''[[L.A. Woman]]''.  Shortly after the recording sessions for the album began, producer [[Paul A. Rothchild]]—who had overseen all of their previous recordings—left the project. Engineer [[Bruce Botnick]] took over as producer.

==Poetry and film==
Morrison began writing in earnest during his adolescence. At UCLA he studied the related fields of theater, film, and [[cinematography]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Notable Actors – UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television|url=http://www.tft.ucla.edu/alumni/notable-actors/ |accessdate=2008-12-03 |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He self-published two separate volumes of his poetry in 1969, entitled ''The Lords / Notes on Vision'' and ''The New Creatures''. ''The Lords'' consists primarily of brief descriptions of places, people, events and Morrison's thoughts on cinema. ''The New Creatures'' verses are more poetic in structure, feel and appearance. These two books were later combined into a single volume titled ''The Lords and The New Creatures''. These were the only writings published during Morrison's lifetime.

Morrison befriended [[Beat generation|Beat poet]] [[Michael McClure]], who wrote the [[afterword]] for [[Danny Sugerman]]'s biography of Morrison, ''[[No One Here Gets Out Alive]]''. McClure and Morrison reportedly collaborated on a number of unmade film projects, including a film version of McClure's infamous play ''The Beard'', in which Morrison would have played [[Billy the Kid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McClure |first=Michael |title=Michael McClure Recalls an Old Friend |url=http://archives.waiting-forthe-sun.net/Pages/Players/Personal/mcclure_recalls.html |accessdate=2008-09-09 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his death, a further two volumes of Morrison's poetry were published. The contents of the books were selected and arranged by Morrison's friend, photographer Frank Lisciandro, and girlfriend [[Pamela Courson]]'s parents, who owned the rights to his poetry. ''The Lost Writings of Jim Morrison'' Volume I is entitled ''Wilderness,'' and, upon its release in 1988, became an instant ''[[New York Times]]'' Bestseller. Volume II, ''[[American Night|The American Night]],'' released in 1990, was also a success.

Morrison recorded his own poetry in a professional sound studio on two separate occasions. The first was in March 1969 in Los Angeles and the second was on December 8, 1970. The latter recording session was attended by Morrison's personal friends and included a variety of sketch pieces. Some of the segments from the 1969 session were issued on the [[bootleg recording|bootleg]] album ''[[The Lost Paris Tapes]]'' and were later used as part of the Doors' ''[[An American Prayer]]'' album,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Morrison |first=Jim |url=http://www.amazon.com/American-Prayer-Jim-Morrison-Doors/dp/B000002HJD |title=American Prayer: Jim Morrison &amp; The Doors: Music |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; released in 1978. The album reached No. 54 on the music charts. Some poetry recorded from the December 1970 session remains unreleased to this day and is in the possession of the Courson family.

Morrison's best-known but seldom seen cinematic endeavor is ''[[HWY: An American Pastoral]]'', a project he started in 1969. Morrison financed the venture and formed his own production company in order to maintain complete control of the project. [[Paul Ferrara]], Frank Lisciandro and Babe Hill assisted with the project. Morrison played the main character, a hitchhiker turned killer/car thief. Morrison asked his friend, composer/pianist Fred Myrow, to select the soundtrack for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Unterberger |first=Richie |title=Liner Notes for Diane Hildebrand's &quot;Early Morning Blues and Greens |url=http://www.richieunterberger.com/diane.html |accessdate=2008-08-24 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

==Personal life==

===Morrison's family===
[[File:Bonhommerichard.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Morrison and his father on the bridge of the [[USS Bon Homme Richard (CV-31)|USS ''Bon Homme Richard'']] in January, 1964]]
Morrison's early life was a nomadic existence typical of [[Military brat (U.S. subculture)|military families]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jim Morrison Biography |url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/1930:2450/1/Jim_Morrison.htm |accessdate=2008-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerry Hopkins recorded Morrison's brother, Andy, explaining that his parents had determined never to use physical [[corporal punishment]] such as [[spanking]] on their children. They instead instilled discipline and levied punishment by the military tradition known as ''dressing down''. This consisted of yelling at and berating the children until they were reduced to tears and acknowledged their failings.

Once Morrison graduated from UCLA, he broke off most contact with his family. By the time Morrison's music ascended to the top of the charts (in 1967) he had not been in communication with his family for more than a year and falsely claimed that his parents and siblings were dead (or claiming, as it has been widely misreported, that he was an only child). This misinformation was published as part of the materials distributed with The Doors' [[The Doors (album)|self-titled debut album]].

George &quot;Steve&quot; Morrison was not supportive of his son's career choice in music. One day, an acquaintance brought over a record thought to have Jim on the cover. The record was the Doors self-titled debut. The young man played the record for Morrison's father and family. Upon hearing the record, Morrison's father wrote him a letter telling him &quot;to give up any idea of singing or any connection with a music group because of what I consider to be a complete lack of talent in this direction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.idafan.com/cleveland_plain_dealer-exhbit-preview.html | title = Love Them Two Times | accessdate = 2010-05-18 | last = Soeder | first = John | date = 2007-05-20 | work = Plain Dealer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to the Florida Probation and Parole Commission District Office dated October 2, 1970, Morrison's father acknowledged the breakdown in family communications as the result of an argument over his assessment of his son's musical talents. He said he could not blame his son for being reluctant to initiate contact and that he was proud of him nonetheless.&lt;ref name=&quot;fatherletter&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.idafan.com/FloridaProbation-ParoleLetters.htm |title=Letter from Jim's Father to probation department 1970 |publisher=Idafan.com |accessdate=December 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
Morrison met his long-term companion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Hoover |first=Elizabeth D. |date=July 3, 2006|title=The Death of Jim Morrison |url=http://www.americanheritage.com/entertainment/articles/web/20060703-jim-morrison-doors-drugs-rock-n-roll-aldous-huxley-paris-heroin-pamela-courson.shtml |publisher=''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]''|accessdate=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pamela Courson]], well before he gained any fame or fortune,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jim Morrison Biography |url=http://www.thebiographychannel.co.uk/biography_story/1930:2450/4/Jim_Morrison.htm |accessdate=2008-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she encouraged him to develop his poetry. At times, Courson used the surname &quot;Morrison&quot; with his apparent consent or at least lack of concern. After Courson's death on April 25, 1974, the [[probate]] court in California decided that she and Morrison had what qualified as a [[common-law marriage]] (see below, under &quot;Estate Controversy&quot;).

Morrison and Courson's relationship was a stormy one, with frequent loud arguments and periods of separation. Biographer [[Danny Sugerman]] surmised that part of their difficulties may have stemmed from a conflict between their respective commitments to an [[open relationship]] and the consequences of living in such a relationship.

In 1970, Morrison participated in a [[Celtic Neopaganism|Celtic Pagan]] [[handfasting]] ceremony with rock critic and science fiction/[[fantasy]] author [[Patricia Kennealy-Morrison|Patricia Kennealy]]. Before witnesses, one of them a [[Presbyterian]] [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pkm1&quot;&gt;{{Cite book | first =Patricia | last =Kennealy | authorlink = Patricia Kennealy-Morrison| year =1992 | title =Strange Days: My Life With And Without Jim Morrison  | chapter = | editor = | others = | edition = | page =63 | publisher =Dutton/Penguin | location =New York| isbn =0-525-93419-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the couple signed a document declaring themselves wed,&lt;ref name=&quot;pkm2&quot;&gt;Kennealy (1992) plate 7, p.175&lt;/ref&gt; but none of the necessary paperwork for a legal marriage was filed with the state. Kennealy discussed her experiences with Morrison in her autobiography ''Strange Days: My Life With and Without Jim Morrison'' in an interview reported in the book ''Rock Wives''.

Morrison also reportedly regularly had sex with fans (&quot;groupies&quot;) and had numerous short flings with female celebrities, including [[Nico]], the singer associated with [[The Velvet Underground]], a [[one night stand]] with singer [[Grace Slick]] of [[Jefferson Airplane]], an on-again-off-again relationship with ''[[16 Magazine]]'''s [[Gloria Stavers]] as well as an alleged alcohol-fueled encounter with [[Janis Joplin]]. [[Alice Cooper]], declared on his syndicated radio show that Jim was scrupulously true to Pamela on tour, eschewing all sexual encounters.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}  Linda Ashcroft, in her book, ''Wild Child: My Life With Jim Morrison'' details her life with Morrison as well. Judy Huddleston also recalls her relationship with Morrison in ''This is The End...My Only Friend: Living and Dying with Jim Morrison''. At the time of his death there were as many as twenty [[Paternity (law)|paternity]] actions pending against him, although no claims were made against his estate by any of the putative paternity claimants.

==Death==
Morrison joined Pam in Paris in March 1971. They took up residence in the city in a rented apartment on the rue Beautreillis (in the [[4th arrondissement of Paris]] on the [[Rive Droite (Paris)|Right Bank]]), and went for long walks throughout the city,&lt;ref name=&quot;pkm3&quot;&gt;Kennealy (1992) pp.314–16&lt;/ref&gt; admiring the city's architecture. During this time, Morrison shaved his beard and lost some of the weight he had gained in the previous months.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davis&quot;&gt;Davis, Steven (2004) &quot;[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/6185019/the_last_days_of_jim_morrison The Last Days of Jim Morrison]&quot;.

Retrieved December 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; His last studio recording was with two American street musicians—a session dismissed by Manzarek as &quot;drunken gibberish&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript (April 10, 2002).

Accessed November 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The session included a version of a song-in-progress, &quot;Orange County Suite&quot;, which can be heard on the bootleg ''[[The Lost Paris Tapes]]''. Morrison died on July 3, 1971 at age 27.&lt;ref name=&quot;Death announced&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title=Jim Morrison: Lead rock singer dies in Paris|newspaper=The Toronto Star|date=1971-07-09|author=United Press International|agency=UPI|location=Toronto|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the official account of his death, he was found in a Paris apartment bathtub (at 17–19 rue Beautreillis, [[4th arrondissement of Paris|4th arrondissement]]) by Courson.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymail.co.uk&quot;&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-466947/The-shocking-truth-pal-Jim-Morrison-REALLY-died.html&lt;/ref&gt; Pursuant to French law, no [[autopsy]] was performed because the [[medical examiner]] stated that there was no evidence of [[crime|foul play]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymail.co.uk&quot;/&gt; The absence of an official autopsy has left many questions regarding Morrison's cause of death.&lt;ref name=&quot;usatoday.com&quot;/&gt; 

In ''Wonderland Avenue'', [[Danny Sugerman]] discussed his encounter with Courson after she returned to the United States. According to Sugerman's account, Courson stated that Morrison had died of a heroin [[drug overdose|overdose]], having [[Insufflation (medicine)|insufflated]] what he believed to be [[cocaine]]. Sugerman added that Courson had given him numerous contradictory versions of Morrison's death, saying at times that she had killed Morrison, or that his death was her fault. Courson's story of Morrison's unintentional ingestion of heroin, followed by his accidental overdose, is supported by the confession of Alain Ronay, who has written that Morrison died of a [[hemorrhage]] after snorting Courson's heroin, and that Courson nodded off instead of phoning for medical help, leaving Morrison bleeding to death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ronay&quot;&gt;Ronay, Alain (2002). [http://archives.waiting-forthesun.net/Pages/Articles/jims_last_days.html &quot;Jim and I – Friends until Death&quot;]. Originally published in ''[[King (magazine)|King]]''.  Retrieved December 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Ronay confessed in an article in ''Paris'' that he then helped cover up the circumstances of Morrison's death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ronay2&quot;&gt;Kennealy (1992) pp: 385–392 quotes from Ronay's interview in ''[[Paris Match]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the epilogue of ''No One Here Gets Out Alive'', Hopkins and Sugerman write that Ronay and [[Agnès Varda]] say Courson lied to the police who responded to the death scene, and later in her deposition, telling them Morrison never took drugs. 

In the epilogue to ''No One Here Gets Out Alive'', Hopkins says that 20 years after Morrison's death, Ronay and Varda broke their silence and gave this account: They arrived at the house shortly after Morrison's death and Courson said that she and Morrison had taken heroin after a night of drinking. Morrison had been coughing badly, had gone to take a bath, and vomited blood. Courson said that he appeared to recover and that she then went to sleep. When she awoke sometime later Morrison was unresponsive, so she called for medical assistance. Hopkins and Sugerman also claim that Morrison had [[asthma]] and was suffering from a [[respiratory system|respiratory]] condition involving a chronic cough and vomiting blood on the night of his death. This theory is partially supported in ''The Doors'' (written by the remaining members of the band) in which they claim Morrison had been coughing up blood for nearly two months in Paris, but it should be noted that none of the members of [[The Doors]] were in Paris with Morrison in the months prior to his death. 

According to a Madame Colinette, who was at the cemetery that day mourning the recent loss of her husband, she witnessed Morrison's funeral at [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;forum.johndensmore.com&quot;&gt;http://forum.johndensmore.com/index.php?showtopic=2446&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony was &quot;pitiful&quot;, with several of the attendants muttering a few words, throwing flowers over the casket, then leaving quickly and hastily within minutes as if their lives depended upon it.&lt;ref name=&quot;forum.johndensmore.com&quot;/&gt; Those who attended included Alain Ronay, Agnes Varda, Bill Siddons (manager), Courson, and Robin Wertle (Morrison's Canadian private secretary at the time for a few months).&lt;ref name=&quot;forum.johndensmore.com&quot;/&gt; 

In the first version of ''No One Here Gets Out Alive'' published in 1980, Sugerman and Hopkins gave some credence to the rumor that Morrison may not have died at all, calling the fake death theory “not as far-fetched as it might seem”.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins, Jerry; Sugerman, Danny. ''No One Here Gets Out Alive''. pg. 373.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory led to considerable distress for Morrison's loved ones over the years, notably when fans would [[stalking|stalk]] them, searching for evidence of Morrison's whereabouts.&lt;ref name=&quot;sugerman&quot;&gt;Hopkins, Jerry; Sugerman, Danny (1980).

====Grave site====
Morrison is buried in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris, one of the city's most visited tourist attractions. The grave had no official marker until French officials placed a shield over it, which was stolen in 1973. The site previous to the 1973 theft (pictured, right) was covered with shells and letters.

===Estate controversy===
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
In his last [[will (law)|will]], notarized in Los Angeles on February 12, 1969, Morrison (who described himself as &quot;an unmarried person&quot;) [[bequest|bequeathed]] his entire estate to Pamela Courson, naming her co-executor with his attorney, Max Fink{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. Subsequently, she inherited everything upon Morrison’s death.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. Courson died of a heroin overdose in 1974, leaving her parents as her heirs{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. Like Morrison, she was also 27 years old at the time of her death.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.findagrave.com/cgi-bin/fg.cgi?GRid=4355&amp;page=gr&lt;/ref&gt; 

Morrison's parents then contested Morrison's will{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. Courson's parents then produced a document they claimed she had acquired in [[Colorado]], an application for a declaration that she and Morrison had contracted a [[common-law marriage]] under the law of that state. Courson, as Morrison's spouse, would inherit even if the will was invalid.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} The ability to contract a common-law marriage was abolished in California in 1896. However, California's [[conflict of laws]] rule provided for recognition of common-law marriages when lawfully contracted in foreign jurisdictions,{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}} and Colorado recognizes common-law marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmarriagelaws.com/search/united_states/colorado/ Marriage license Laws in the state of Colorado]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic influences==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2012}}
[[File:Jim Morrison Memorial Berlin1.JPG|left|150px|thumb|Jim Morrison Memorial in Germany (Berlin-Baumschulenweg)]]
As a naval family the Morrisons relocated frequently. Consequently Morrison's early education was routinely disrupted as he moved from school to school. Nonetheless he was drawn to the study of literature, poetry, religion, philosophy and [[psychology]], among other fields.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Biographers have consistently pointed to a number of writers and [[philosophers]] who influenced Morrison's thinking and, perhaps, his behavior{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. While still in his teens Morrison discovered the work of philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. He was also drawn to the poetry of [[William Blake]], [[Charles Baudelaire]] and [[Arthur Rimbaud]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. [[Beat Generation]] writers such as [[Jack Kerouac]] also had a strong influence on Morrison's outlook and manner of expression; Morrison was eager to experience the life described in Kerouac's ''[[On the Road]]''{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. He was similarly drawn to the work of French writer [[Louis-Ferdinand Céline]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. Céline's book, ''Voyage au Bout de la Nuit'' (''[[Journey to the End of the Night]]'') and Blake's ''[[Auguries of Innocence]]'' both echo through one of Morrison's early songs, &quot;End of the Night&quot;{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}. Morrison later met and befriended Michael McClure, a well known beat poet. McClure had enjoyed Morrison's lyrics but was even more impressed by his poetry and encouraged him to further develop his craft.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Morrison's vision of performance was colored by the works of 20th century French playwright [[Antonin Artaud]] (author of ''Theater and its Double'') and by [[Julian Beck]]'s [[Living Theater]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Other works relating to religion, [[mysticism]], ancient [[Mythology|myth]] and [[symbol]]ism were of lasting interest, particularly [[Joseph Campbell]]'s ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]].'' [[James Frazer]]'s ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' also became a source of inspiration and is reflected in the title and lyrics of the song &quot;Not to Touch the Earth&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Morrison was particularly attracted to the myths and religions of [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Jim Morrison |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_gx5221/is_2005/ai_n19141572/pg_2 |accessdate=2008-08-24 | work=UXL Newsmakers | year=2005 |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he was still in school, his family moved to [[New Mexico]] where he got to see some of the places and artifacts important to the [[American Southwest]] indigenous cultures. These interests appear to be the source of many references to creatures and places such as [[lizards]], snakes, [[deserts]] and &quot;ancient lakes&quot; that appear in his songs and poetry. His interpretation of the practices of a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] &quot;[[shaman]]&quot; were worked into parts of Morrison's stage routine, notably in his interpretation of the [[Ghost Dance]], and a song on his later poetry album, ''The Ghost Song''.

Jim Morrison's vocal influences included [[Elvis Presley]] and [[Frank Sinatra]], which is evident in his own baritone [[Crooner|crooning]] style used in several of [[The Doors]] songs and in the 1981 documentary The Doors: A Tribute to Jim Morrison, Producer Paul Rothchild refers his first impression of Morrison as being a &quot;Rock and Roll Bing Crosby&quot;. It is mentioned within the pages of &quot;No One Here Gets Out Alive&quot; by Danny Sugerman, that Morrison as a teenager was such a fan of Presley's music that he demanded people be quiet when Elvis was on the radio. The Frank Sinatra influence is mentioned in the pages of &quot;The Doors, The Illustrated History&quot; also by Sugerman, where Frank Sinatra is listed on Morrison's Band Bio as being his favorite singer. Reference to this can also be found in a [[Rolling Stone Magazine|Rolling Stone]] article about Jim Morrison, regarding the Top 100 rock singers of all time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/6027/32782/33583&lt;/ref&gt;

Morrison was, and continues to be, one of the most popular and influential singer-songwriters in rock history. [[The Doors]]' catalog has become an unequivocal staple of [[classic rock]] radio stations. To this day Morrison is widely regarded as the prototypical rock-star: surly, sexy, scandalous and mysterious.&lt;ref&gt;Andy Bennett (2004), ''Remembering Woodstock'', [[Ashgate Publishing]], p.52.&lt;/ref&gt; The leather pants he was fond of wearing both onstage and off have since become stereotyped as rock-star apparel.&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Hemmer (2007), ''Encyclopedia of beat literature'', [[Infobase Publishing]], p.217.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' readers' pick placed Jim Morrison in fifth place of the magazine's &quot;Best Lead Singers of All Time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollingstone.com/music/photos/rolling-stone-readers-pick-the-best-lead-singers-of-all-time-20110412/5-jim-morrison-0003004 Rolling Stone Readers Pick the Best Lead Singers of All Time (5.Jim Morrison)]. ''Rolling Stone''. Retrieved July 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Iggy and the Stooges]] are said to have formed after lead singer [[Iggy Pop]] was inspired by Morrison while attending a Doors concert in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Stooges: Biography: Rolling Stone |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/thestooges/biography |accessdate=2008-08-24 |postscript= &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

[[Wallace Fowlie]], professor emeritus of [[French literature]] at [[Duke University]], wrote ''Rimbaud and Jim Morrison,'' subtitled ''&quot;The Rebel as Poet&amp;nbsp;– A Memoir&quot;.'' In this he recounts his surprise at receiving a fan letter from Morrison who, in 1968, thanked him for his latest translation of [[Arthur Rimbaud]]'s verse into English. &quot;I don't read French easily&quot;, he wrote, &quot;...your book travels around with me.&quot; Fowlie went on to give lectures on numerous campuses comparing the lives, philosophies and poetry of Morrison and Rimbaud.

[[Eddie Vedder]], lead singer of the band [[Pearl Jam]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zimbio.com/Pearl+Jam/articles/kBPbSW2dnDv/Eddie+Vedder Eddie Vedder – Pearl Jam]. Zimbio. Retrieved on 2010-11-06.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Layne Staley]], the late vocalist of [[Alice in Chains]], [[Scott Weiland]], the vocalist of [[Stone Temple Pilots]] and [[Velvet Revolver]], [[Julian Casablancas]] of [[The Strokes]], [[James LaBrie]] of [[Dream Theater]], as well as [[Scott Stapp]] of [[Creed (band)|Creed]], have all claimed Morrison to be their biggest influence and inspiration. [[Stone Temple Pilots]] and [[Velvet Revolver]] have both covered &quot;[[Roadhouse Blues]]&quot; by The Doors. Weiland also filled in for Morrison to perform &quot;[[Break On Through (To The Other Side)]]&quot; with the rest of The Doors. Stapp filled in for Morrison for &quot;[[Light My Fire]]&quot;, &quot;[[Riders on the Storm]]&quot; and &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot; on ''[[VH1 Storytellers]]''. Creed performed their version of &quot;Roadhouse Blues&quot; with [[Robby Krieger]] for the [[Woodstock 1999|1999 Woodstock Festival]].

The book ''The Doors'' by the remaining Doors quotes Morrison's close friend Frank Lisciandro as saying that too many people took a remark of Morrison's that he was interested in revolt, disorder, and chaos “to mean that he was an anarchist, a revolutionary, or, worse yet, a [[nihilism|nihilist]]. Hardly anyone noticed that Jim was restating Rimbaud and the [[surrealism|Surreal]] poets.”&lt;ref&gt;The Doors (remaining members Ray Manzarek, Robby Krieger, John Densmore) with Ben Fong-Torres, ''The Doors'', page 104&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock band [[Bon Jovi]] featured Morrison's grave in their &quot;[[I'll Sleep When I'm Dead (Bon Jovi song)|I'll Sleep When I'm Dead]]&quot; video clip.

Professional wrestler [[John Hennigan (professional wrestler)|John Hennigan]]'s persona ''John Morrison'' was inspired by Jim Morrison, and the name of his finishing move was taken from The Doors' [[Moonlight Drive]].

The band Radiohead mentions Jim Morrison in their song &quot;Anyone Can Play Guitar,&quot; stating &quot;I wanna be wanna be wanna be Jim Morrison.&quot;

*''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'' (1991), A fiction film by director [[Oliver Stone]], starring [[Val Kilmer]] as Morrison and with cameos by Krieger and Densmore.

[[Ray Manzarek]], The Doors' keyboardist, harshly criticized Stone's portrayal of Morrison, and noted that numerous events depicted in the movie were pure fiction.  [[David Crosby]] on an album by [[CPR (band)|CPR]] wrote and recorded a song about the movie with the lyric: ''&quot;And I have seen that movie – and it wasn’t like that – he was mad and lonely – and blind as a bat.&quot;''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Morrison-lyrics-David-Crosby/D9CF2701F7AE98FA48257011000CFC9C| Sing 365 lyrics listing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
