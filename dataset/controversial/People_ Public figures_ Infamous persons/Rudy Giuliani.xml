'''Rudolph William Louis &quot;Rudy&quot; Giuliani''', [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|r|uː|d|i|_|ˌ|dʒ|uː|l|i|ˈ|ɑː|n|i}};&lt;ref&gt;See [http://inogolo.com/pronunciation/d1444/Rudy_Giuliani inogolo: pronunciation of Rudy Giuliani].&lt;/ref&gt; born May 28, 1944) is an American lawyer, businessman, former politician, and public speaker from New York. He served as [[Mayor of New York City]] from 1994 to 2001.

A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] in the 1970s, and a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] since the 1980s, Giuliani served in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|United States Attorney's Office, for the Southern District of New York]], eventually becoming [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]]. He prosecuted a number of high-profile cases, including ones against [[organized crime]] and [[Wall Street]] [[financier]]s.

Giuliani served two terms as Mayor of New York City, having run on the Republican and [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal]] lines. He was credited with initiating improvements and with a reduction in crime pressing the city's quality of life initiatives. He ran for the [[United States Senate]] in [[United States Senate election in New York, 2000|2000]] but withdrew after he was diagnosed with [[prostate cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/20/nyregion/the-mayor-s-decision-the-overview-cancer-is-concern.html&lt;/ref&gt; Giuliani gained international attention for his leadership during and after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on the [[World Trade Center]]. For those actions, he was named [[Time Person of the Year]] in 2001,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/0,28757,2020227,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; and received an [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honorary knighthood]] from [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,623496,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving office as mayor, Giuliani founded [[Giuliani Partners]], a security consulting business; acquired Giuliani Capital Advisors (later sold), an [[investment banking]] firm; and joined the [[Bracewell &amp; Giuliani]] [[law firm]], which changed its name when he became a partner. In 2008, Giuliani ran unsuccessfully for the Republican Party nomination in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election]]. Giuliani was considered a potential candidate for either [[New York state elections, 2010|Governor or Senator of New York in 2010]], as well as the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]], but decided not to run and remain active in his business career.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rightpundits.com/?p=2428&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/22/rudy-giuliani-2010-ex-may_n_400419.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1011/65648.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/election-2012/post/rudy-giuliani-doesnt-regret-sitting-out-2012-race/2012/02/05/gIQAd8Y7rQ_blog.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/01/13/giuliani-says-decision-on-governors-race-unlikely-before-summer/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rudolph Giuliani was born in an Italian-American enclave in East Flatbush in the New York City borough of [[Brooklyn]], the only child of [[working-class]] parents, Harold Angelo Giuliani (1908–1981) and Helen (née D'Avanzo; 1909–2002), both first-generation Americans, children of Italian [[Immigration to the United States|immigrants]].&lt;ref name=&quot;usa020707&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Danielle|last=Burton|title=10 Things You Didn't Know About Rudy Giuliani|url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070207/7giulianifacts.htm|work=U.S. News &amp; World Report|date=February 7, 2007|accessdate=June 21, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;a&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Fairchild|flolirst=Mary|url=http://christianity.about.com/od/religionpolitics/p/giulianifaithss.htm|title=Presidential Candidate Rudy Giuliani|work=[[About.com]]|accessdate=2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harold Giuliani had trouble holding a job and had been convicted of [[felony]] assault and [[robbery]] and served time in [[Sing Sing]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mondaymemo.net/020218feature.htm|title=Rudy Giuliani: The Long View of Leadership|accessdate=October 26, 2007|last=Bock|first=Wally|work=Wally Bock's Monday Memo}}&lt;/ref&gt; after his release he served as an [[loan shark#20th century gangsters|enforcer]] for his brother-in-law Leo D'Avanzo, who ran an [[organized crime]] operation involved in [[loan shark]]ing and [[gambling]] at a restaurant in Brooklyn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0027,barrett,16192,1.html|title=Thug Life: The Shocking Secret History of Harold Giuliani, the Mayor's Ex-Convict Dad|accessdate=April 6, 2007|last=Barrett|first=Wayne|authorlink=Wayne Barrett|date=July 4, 2000|work=[[The Village Voice]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in life, Rudy Giuliani developed a [[lisp|lateral lisp]] which he still has to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2007/08/20/070820fa_fact_boyer/|title=Mayberry Man|accessdate=July 31, 2008|last=Boyer|first=Peter J.|date=August 20, 2007|work=[[The New Yorker]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, when Giuliani was seven, his family moved from Brooklyn to [[Garden City South, New York|Garden City South]], where he attended the local [[Catholic school]], St. Anne's.&lt;ref name=&quot;America'sMayor&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Profiles/People_Profile/0,2540,162,00.html|title=Rudy Giuliani: America's Mayor|accessdate=October 26, 2007|last=Mott|first=Gordon|work=Cigar Aficionado}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, he commuted back to Brooklyn to attend [[Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School]], graduating in 1961 with an 85 percent average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0028,barrett,16371,1.html|title=A Readers' Guide to the Good Stuff From ''Rudy!''|accessdate=October 26, 2007|last=Barrett|first=Wayne|date=July 11, 2000|work=The Village Voice}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Giuliani attended [[Manhattan College]] in [[Riverdale, Bronx]], where he majored in [[political science]] with a minor in [[philosophy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Raceforcityhall&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Bearak|first=Barry|last2=Fisher|first2=Ian|publication-date=October 19, 1997|title=A Mercurial Mayor's Confident Journey| periodical=New York Times|pages=|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E4D61E3FF93AA25753C1A961958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|accessdate=June 10, 2007|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; There he considered becoming a priest,&lt;ref name=&quot;Raceforcityhall&quot;/&gt; after having studied [[theology]] for four years in college.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/08/us/politics/08repubs.html?_r=3&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;ref=politics&amp;adxnnlx=1197666210-yZWYeUYaefolrbs5pUz/DA &quot;In a Surprise, Pat Robertson Backs Giuliani&quot;], ''New York Times'', November 8, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
Giuliani was elected president of his class in his sophomore year, but was not re-elected in his junior year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raceforcityhall&quot;/&gt; He joined the [[Phi Rho Pi]] [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]], and was active in shaping its direction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raceforcityhall&quot;/&gt; He graduated in 1965. Giuliani eventually decided to forego the priesthood,&lt;ref name=&quot;Raceforcityhall&quot;/&gt; instead attending [[New York University School of Law]] in [[Manhattan]], where he made [[NYU Law Review|law review]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Raceforcityhall&quot;/&gt; and graduated ''[[cum laude]]'' with a [[Juris Doctor]] in 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/records/rwg/html/bio.html|title=A Biography of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani|accessdate=November 18, 2006|publisher=New York City}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuliani started his political life as a Democrat. He has stated that he admires the [[Kennedy family]],&lt;ref name=&quot;usa020707&quot;/&gt; and volunteered for [[Robert F. Kennedy]]'s presidential campaign in 1968. He also worked as a Democratic party committeeman on Long Island in the mid-1960s,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democrats.org/a/2006/11/dnc_statement_o_9.php The Democratic Party| DNC Statement on Giuliani's Potential Presidential Bid]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nationrudy&quot;&gt;Jack Newfield, [http://www.thenation.com/doc/20020617/newfield/4 &quot;The Full Rudy: The Man, the Mayor, the Myth&quot;], ''[[The Nation]]'', May 30, 2002; retrieved June 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; and voted for [[George McGovern]] for president in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2007/03/13/swiftboat_rudy &quot;What an anti-Giuliani ad should say&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal career==
Upon graduation, Giuliani [[law clerk|clerked]] for Judge [[Lloyd Francis MacMahon]], United States District Judge for the Southern District of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Giuliani, Rudy|year=2002|title=Leadership|publisher=Hyperion|isbn=0-7868-6841-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuliani did not serve in the military during the [[Vietnam War]]. His [[Conscription in the United States|conscription]] was deferred while he was enrolled at Manhattan College and NYU Law. Upon graduation from NYU Law in 1968, he was [[Selective Service System|classified]] as 1-A, available for military service. He applied for a deferment but was rejected. In 1969, Judge Lloyd Francis MacMahon wrote a letter to Giuliani's draft board, asking that he be reclassified as 2-A, civilian occupation deferment, because Giuliani, who was a law clerk for MacMahon, was an essential employee. The deferment was granted. In 1970, Giuliani received a high draft lottery number; he was not called up for service although by then he had been reclassified 1-A.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/0212072giuliani18.html|title=Rudolf W.

In 1975, Giuliani switched his party registration from Democratic to Independent&lt;ref name=&quot;nationrudy&quot;/&gt; as he was recruited to Washington, D.C. during the [[Ford administration]], where he was named Associate Deputy Attorney General and [[Chief of staff (politics)|chief of staff]] to [[United States Deputy Attorney General|Deputy Attorney General]] Harold &quot;Ace&quot; Tyler.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationrudy&quot; /&gt; His first high-profile prosecution was of [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Bertram L. Podell]] ([[New York's 13th congressional district|NY-13]]), who was convicted of corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/.../AR2005082101051_pf.html ''Washington Post'' report on Bertram L. Podell]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1977 to 1981, during the [[Carter Administration]], Giuliani practiced law at the [[Patterson, Belknap, Webb and Tyler]] [[law firm]], as chief of staff to his previous DC boss, Ace Tyler. Tyler later became critical of Giuliani's turn as a prosecutor, calling his tactics &quot;overkill&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationrudy&quot;/&gt;

On December 8, 1980, one month after [[United States presidential election, 1980|the election of Ronald Reagan]] brought Republicans back to power in Washington, he switched his party affiliation from Independent to Republican.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationrudy&quot;/&gt; Giuliani later said the switches were because he found Democratic policies &quot;naïve&quot;, and that &quot;by the time I moved to Washington, the Republicans had come to make more sense to me&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;usa020707&quot;/&gt; Others suggested that the switches were made in order to get positions in the Justice Department.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationrudy&quot;/&gt; Giuliani's mother maintained in 1988 that: {{quote|He only became a Republican after he began to get all these jobs from them. He's definitely not a conservative Republican. He thinks he is, but he isn't. He still feels very sorry for the poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;nationrudy&quot;/&gt;}}

In 1981, Giuliani was named [[United States Associate Attorney General|Associate Attorney General]] in the [[Reagan administration]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://article.nationalreview.com/print/?q=M2NlNmM5MjRhMDYwMDdiMjM5NDFlYzYzNmYxNTg1ZWY= &quot;Doing Rudy Justice&quot;], ''National Review'', November 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; the third-highest position in the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]]. As Associate Attorney General, Giuliani supervised the U.S. Attorney Offices' federal law enforcement agencies, the [[Department of Corrections]], the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], and the [[United States Marshals Service]]. In a well-publicized 1982 case, Giuliani testified in defense of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government's]] &quot;detention posture&quot; regarding the internment of over 2,000 [[Haiti]]an [[asylum seeker]]s who had entered the country illegally. The U.S. government disputed the assertion that most of the detainees had fled their country due to political persecution, alleging instead that they were &quot;economic migrants&quot;. In defense of the government's position, Giuliani testified that &quot;political repression, at least in general, does not exist&quot; under [[President of Haiti]] [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]]'s regime.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raceforcityhall&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9400E7D61539F930A35757C0A964948260 Around the World; U.S. Official Finds No Repression in Haiti]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, Giuliani was appointed [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York]], which was technically a demotion but was sought by Giuliani because of his desire to personally litigate cases. It was in this position that he first gained national prominence by prosecuting numerous high-profile cases, resulting in the convictions of [[Wall Street]] figures [[Ivan Boesky]] and [[Michael Milken]]. He also focused on prosecuting drug dealers, [[organized crime]], and corruption in government.&lt;ref name=&quot;bio&quot;/&gt; He amassed a record of 4,152 convictions and 25 reversals. As a federal prosecutor, Giuliani was credited with bringing the &quot;[[perp walk]]&quot;, parading of suspects in front of the previously alerted media, into common use as a prosecutorial tool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.com/jsp/ihc/PubArticleIHC.jsp?id=1142862090121|title=How to Avoid Letting a 'Perp Walk' Turn Into a Parade|author=William Mitchelson Jr.|work=National Law Journal|date= March 21, 2006|accessdate=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Giuliani &quot;patented the [[perp walk]]&quot;, the tool was used by increasing numbers of prosecutors nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Breaking Down the &quot;Perp Walk&quot;|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2006/03/22/breaking-down-the-perp-walk|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=March 22, 2006|accessdate=June 1, 2007|first=Peter|last=Lattman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuliani's critics claim he arranged public arrests of people, then dropped charges for lack of evidence on high-profile cases rather than going to trial. In a few cases, his public arrests of alleged white-collar criminals at their workplaces with charges later dropped or lessened, sparked controversy, and damaged the reputations of the alleged &quot;perps&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No more ‘perp walks’|url=http://www.stroock.com/SiteFiles/Pub123.pdf|publisher=National Law Journal|date=August 5, 2002|accessdate=June 1, 2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that veteran stock trader Richard Wigton, of [[Kidder, Peabody &amp; Co.]] was guilty of [[insider trading]]; in February 1987 he had officers handcuff Wigton and march him through the company's trading floor, with Wigton in tears. Giuliani had his agents arrest Tim Tabor, a young arbitrageur and former colleague of Wigton, so late that he had to stay overnight in jail before posting bond.&lt;ref&gt;Peter J. Boyer, &quot;Mayberry Man&quot;, ''The New Yorker'', August 20, 2007, pg. 49&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Collins-cnr02&quot;&gt;Heidi Collins, Allan Chernoff, Crystal McCrary Anthony, http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0705/23/cnr.02.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Rudy Giuliani:America's Mayor or America's Fraud&quot; http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TfCnMKycHaY&amp;mode=related&amp;search=&lt;/ref&gt; Within three months charges were dropped against both Wigton and Tabor; Giuliani said, &quot;We're not going to go to trial. We're just the tip of the iceberg&quot;, but no further charges were forthcoming and the investigation did not end until Giuliani's successor was in place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collins-cnr02&quot;/&gt; Giuliani's high-profile raid of the Princeton/Newport firm ended with the defendants having their cases overturned on appeal on the grounds that what they had been convicted of were not crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Nocera|first=Joseph| publication-date=August 6, 1995|title=Junk Bondage|periodical=New York Times|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=990CE0D81130F935A3575BC0A963958260&amp;n=Top%2FNews%2FBusiness%2FColumns%2FJoseph%20Nocera|accessdate=June 8, 2007|work=The New York Times|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mafia Commission trial===
In the [[Mafia Commission Trial]] (February 25, 1985–November 19, 1986), Giuliani indicted eleven [[organized crime]] figures, including the heads of New York's so-called &quot;[[Five Families]]&quot;, under the [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) on charges including extortion, labor racketeering, and murder for hire. ''Time'' magazine called this &quot;[[Case of Cases]]&quot; possibly &quot;the most significant assault on the infrastructure of organized crime since the high command of the Chicago Mafia was swept away in 1943&quot;, and quoted Giuliani's stated intention: &quot;Our approach is to wipe out the five families.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;passionate&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101860210-143096,00.html|title=The Passionate Prosecutor|accessdate=November 15, 2006|last=Stengel|first=Richard|date =June 24, 2001|publisher=Time Magazine online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eight defendants were found guilty on all counts and subsequently sentenced on January 13, 1987 to hundreds of years of prison time.

===Boesky, Milken trials===
Ivan Boesky was a Wall Street [[arbitrage]]ur who had amassed a fortune of about $200 million by betting on corporate takeovers. He was investigated by the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] for making investments based on tips received from corporate insiders. These stock acquisitions were sometimes brazen, with massive purchases occurring only a few days before a corporation announced a takeover.

==Mayoral campaigns==
Giuliani was U.S. Attorney until January 1989, resigning as the [[Reagan Administration]] ended. He garnered criticism until he left office for his handling of cases, and was accused of prosecuting cases to further his political ambitions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raceforcityhall&quot; /&gt; He joined the law firm White &amp; Case in New York City as a partner. He remained with White &amp; Case until May 1990, when he joined the law firm Anderson Kill Olick &amp; Oshinsky, also in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bracewellgiuliani.com/index.cfm/fa/lawyer.profile/attorney/f4d1303d-9dce-43d1-b132-1f858ee82613/Rudolph_W_Giuliani.cfm Rudolph W.

===1989===
Giuliani first ran for [[Election results for mayor of New York|New York City Mayor]] in 1989, attempting to unseat three-term incumbent [[Ed Koch]]. He won the September 1989 Republican Party [[primary election]] against business magnate [[Ronald Lauder]], in a campaign marked by claims that Giuliani was not a true Republican and by an acrimonious debate.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt050307&quot;&gt;Katharine Q.

In the general election, Giuliani ran as the [[electoral fusion|fusion]] candidate of both the Republican and [[Liberal Party of New York|Liberal]] Parties. The [[Conservative Party of New York|Conservative Party]], which had often co-lined the Republican party candidate, withheld support from Giuliani and ran Lauder instead.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Lynn, [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE4DC153AF932A15754C0A96F948260 &quot;Giuliani Files 2 Challenges To Take Lauder off Ballot&quot;], ''The New York Times'', July 21, 1989.

Four years after he was beaten by Dinkins, Giuliani again ran for mayor. Once again, Giuliani also ran on the Liberal Party line but not the Conservative Party line, which ran activist [[George Marlin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nysun032107&quot;&gt;[http://www.latestpolitics.com/article/17 &quot;Q&amp;A: George Marlin&quot;], ''[[The New York Sun]]'', March 21, 2007; accessed June 24, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The city was suffering from a spike in unemployment associated with the nationwide recession, with local unemployment rates going from 6.7% in 1989 to 11.1% in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;New York State Department of Labor statistics,{{cite web|url=http://www.labor.state.ny.us/workforceindustrydata/apps.asp?reg=nys&amp;app=laus|title=Workforce industry data|accessdate=November 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuliani ran an aggressive campaign, parlaying his image as a tough leader who had cleaned up the city. Giuliani's popularity was at its highest point to date, with a late October 1997 [[Quinnipiac University Polling Institute]] poll showing him as having a 68 percent approval rating; 70 percent of New Yorkers were satisfied with life in the city and 64 percent said things were better in the city compared to four years previously.&lt;ref name=&quot;qu102997&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1302.xml?ReleaseID=808|title=Giuliani Approval, Satisfaction With City Hit New Highs, Quinnipiac College Poll Finds; Mayor's Lead Over Messinger Nears 2–1|publisher= [[Quinnipiac University]]|date=October 29, 1997|accessdate=June 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the campaign he was well ahead in the polls and had a strong fund-raising advantage over Messinger.

==Mayoralty==

Giuliani served as mayor of New York City from 1994 through 2001.

===Law enforcement===
In Giuliani's first term as mayor, the [[New York City Police Department]] at the instigation of Commissioner [[Bill Bratton]] adopted an aggressive enforcement/deterrent strategy based on [[James Q. Wilson]]'s &quot;[[Broken Windows]]&quot; approach.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amazon.com/Turnaround-Americas-Reversed-Crime-Epidemic/dp/0679452516&lt;/ref&gt; This involved crackdowns on relatively minor offenses such as graffiti, turnstile jumping, [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] possession, and aggressive panhandling by &quot;squeegee men&quot;, on the theory that this would send a message that order would be maintained. Bratton, with Deputy Commissioner [[Jack Maple]], also created and instituted [[CompStat]], a computer-driven comparative statistical approach to mapping crime geographically and in terms of emerging criminal patterns, as well as charting officer performance by quantifying criminal apprehensions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.govtech.com/magazines/gt/Jack-Maple-Betting-on-Intelligence.html&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the system assert that it creates an environment in which police officials are encouraged to underreport or otherwise manipulate crime data.&lt;ref name=&quot;study&quot;&gt;Patrick A.

Additional contributing factors to the overall decline in crime during the 1990s were federal funding of an additional 7,000 police officers and an overall improvement in the national economy. Changing demographics were a key factor contributing to crime rate reductions, which were similar across the country during this time.&lt;ref&gt;Greene ''Crime Delinquency''

Giuliani's supporters cite studies concluding that New York's drop in crime rate in the 1990s and 2000s exceeds all national figures and therefore should be linked with a local dynamic that was not present as such anywhere else in the country: what [[University of California]] sociologist Frank Zimring calls &quot;the most focused form of policing in history&quot;. In his book ''The Great American Crime Decline'', Zimring claims that &quot;up to half of New York’s crime drop in the 1990s, and virtually 100 percent of its continuing crime decline since 2000, has resulted from policing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Heather MacDonald [http://www.city-journal.org/html/16_3_ny_cops.html New York Cops: Still the Finest] CityJournal.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zimring|first=Franklin E.|title=The Great American Crime Decline (Studies in Crime and Public Policy)|publisher=Oxford University Press|date=November 3, 2006|location=|pages=272|isbn=0-19-518115-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his mayoralty, gay and [[lesbian]] New Yorkers received [[domestic partner]]ship rights. Giuliani induced the city's Democratic-controlled New York City Council, which had avoided the issue for years, to pass legislation providing broad protection for [[same-sex partner]]s. In 1998, he codified local law by granting all city employees equal benefits for their domestic partners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isebrand.com/article_Rudy's_gay_friends.htm &quot;What will Rudy say to his gay friends?&quot;], Salon.com, February 26, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to [[term limits]], Giuliani could not run in 2001 for a third term as Mayor. In November 1998, long-serving Democratic New York Senator [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]] announced his retirement and Giuliani immediately indicated an interest in running in the 2000 election for the now-open seat.

====Response====
Giuliani was prominent in the aftermath of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] on the World Trade Center. He made frequent appearances on radio and television on September 11 and afterwards– for example, to indicate that tunnels would be closed as a precautionary measure, and that there was no reason to believe that the dispersion of [[chemical weapon|chemical]] or [[biological weapon]]ry into the air was a factor in the attack. In his public statements, Giuliani said: {{quote|Tomorrow New York is going to be here. And we're going to rebuild, and we're going to be stronger than we were before... I want the people of New York to be an example to the rest of the country, and the rest of the world, that terrorism can't stop us.&lt;ref name=&quot;POY2001&quot;/&gt;}}

The 9/11 attacks occurred on the scheduled date of the mayoral primary to select the Democratic and Republican candidates to succeed Giuliani. The primary was immediately delayed two weeks to September 25. During this period, Giuliani sought an unprecedented three-month emergency extension of his term from January 1 to April 1 under the [[New York State Constitution]] (Article 3 Section 25).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Content Removed|url=http://assembly.state.ny.us/leg/?co=5|accessdate=November 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He threatened to challenge the law imposing term limits on elected city officials and run for another full four-year term, if the primary candidates did not consent to the extension of his mayoralty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Conservative Party and Courts May Hold Key to NYC Mayor's Race&amp;nbsp;— October 1, 2001| url=http://www.cnsnews.com/Politics/archive/200110/POL20011001c.html| accessdate=November 15, 2005 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20020116071502/http://www.cnsnews.com/Politics/archive/200110/POL20011001c.html |archivedate = January 16, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end leaders in the [[New York State Assembly|State Assembly]] and [[New York Senate|Senate]] indicated that they did not believe the extension was necessary. The election proceeded as scheduled, and the winning candidate, the Giuliani-endorsed Republican convert [[Michael Bloomberg]], took office on January 1, 2002 per normal custom.

Giuliani claimed to have been at the [[Ground Zero#World Trade Center|Ground Zero]] site &quot;as often, if not more, than most workers.... I was there working with them. I was exposed to exactly the same things they were exposed to. So in that sense, I'm one of them.&quot; Some 9/11 workers have objected to those claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/08/10/2007-08-10_911_workers_outraged_by_new_rudy_claim.html|title=9/11 workers outraged by new Rudy claim|author=Celeste Katz|publisher=''New York Daily News''|date=August 10, 2007|accessdate=October 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,22227731-663,00.html|title=

When Saudi Prince [[Alwaleed bin Talal]] suggested that the attacks were an indication that the United States &quot;should re-examine its policies in the Middle East and adopt a more balanced stand toward the [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] cause&quot;, Giuliani asserted, &quot;There is no moral equivalent for this act. There is no justification for it... And one of the reasons I think this happened is because people were engaged in moral equivalency in not understanding the difference between liberal democracies like the United States, like Israel, and terrorist states and those who condone terrorism. So I think not only are those statements wrong, they're part of the problem.&quot; Giuliani subsequently rejected the prince's $10 million donation to disaster relief in the aftermath of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/11/rec.giuliani.prince/|title=Giuliani rejects $10 million from Saudi prince|publisher=CNN|date=October 12, 2001|accessdate=October 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Preparedness====

Giuliani has been widely criticized for his decision to locate the Office of Emergency Management headquarters on the 23rd floor inside the [[7 World Trade Center]] building. Those opposing the decision perceived the office as a target for a terrorist attack in light of the previous [[World Trade Center bombing|terrorist attack against the World Trade Center in 1993]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Trade Center: Profile|url=http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/entity.jsp?entity=world_trade_center|accessdate=June 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;VV20070808&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Grand Illusion: The untold story of Rudy Giuliani and 9/11|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0635%2Cbarrett%2C74322%2C6.html|author=[[Wayne Barrett]] and [[Dan Collins (journalist)|Dan Collins]]|publisher=[[The Village Voice]]|date=2006-09|accessdate=September 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The office was unable to coordinate efforts between police and firefighters properly while evacuating its headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open and Shut|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0549,murphy,70685,6.html|accessdate=June 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large tanks of diesel fuel were placed in 7 World Trade to power the command center. In May 1997, Giuliani put responsibility for selecting the location on [[Jerome M. Hauer]], who had served under Giuliani from 1996 to 2000 before being appointed by him as New York City’s first Director of Emergency Management. Hauer has taken exception to that account in interviews and provided Fox News and ''[[New York Magazine]]'' with a memo demonstrating that he recommended a location in [[Brooklyn]] but was overruled by Giuliani. Television journalist [[Chris Wallace (journalist)|Chris Wallace]] interviewed Giuliani on May 13, 2007, about his 1997 decision to locate the command center at the World Trade Center. Giuliani laughed during Wallace's questions and said that Hauer recommended the World Trade Center site and claimed that Hauer said that the WTC site was the best location. Wallace presented Giuliani a photocopy of Hauer's directive letter. The letter urged Giuliani to locate the command center in Brooklyn, instead of lower Manhattan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,271917,00.html|title=Transcript: Rudy Giuliani on Fox News Sunday|date=May 14, 2007|accessdate=September 29, 2007|quote=Then why did he say the building– he said it's not– the place in Brooklyn is not as visible a target as buildings in Lower Manhattan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;audio and video from interview available on Robert Greenwald's &quot;The REAL Rudy: Command Center&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Onetime Giuliani Insider Is Now a Critic|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/22/us/politics/22giuliani.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=2&amp;oref=slogin|accessdate=June 12, 2007|work=The New York Times|first=Russ|last=Buettner|date=May 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Angry Giuliani Aide Lashes Back|url=http://empirezone.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/05/15/angry-giuliani-aide-lashes-back|accessdate=June 12, 2007|work=The New York Times|date=May 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wayne Barrett and Dan Collins, &quot;The Real Rudy: From the September print issue: The image of Rudy Giuliani as the hero of September 11 has never been seriously challenged.

In January 2008, an eight-page memo was revealed which detailed the New York City Police Department's opposition in 1998 to location of the city's emergency command center at the Trade Center site. The Giuliani administration overrode these concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/26/us/politics/26emergency.html|title=Memo Details Objections to Command Center Site|accessdate=January 27, 2008|last=Rashbaum|first=William K.|date=January 26, 2008|work=Politics|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[9/11 Commission Report]] noted that lack of preparedness could have led to the deaths of first responders at the scene of the attacks. The Commission noted that the radios in use by the fire department were the same radios which had been criticized for their ineffectiveness following the 1993 World Trade Center bombings. Family members of 9/11 victims have said that these radios were a complaint of emergency services responders for years.&lt;ref name=&quot;survivorsprotest&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Rudy gets earful at stop here: Some FDNY survivors rally against him|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/04/24/2007-04-24_rudy_gets_earful_at_stop_here.html|accessdate=June 12, 2007|location=New York|work=Daily News|date=April 24, 2007|first=David|last=Saltonstall}}&lt;/ref&gt; The radios were not working when Fire Department chiefs ordered the 343 firefighters inside the towers to evacuate, and they remained in the towers as the towers collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=3367678 ''Urban Legend video'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6294198.stm &quot;NY Firefighters attack Giuliani&quot;, BBC News, July 12, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; However, when Giuliani testified before the 9/11 Commission he said that the firefighters ignored the evacuation order out of an effort to save lives.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Baker, &quot;A Fate Worse than Bush: Rudy Giuliani and the Politics of Personality&quot;, ''Harpers'', August 2007, pg. 37, citing Jim Dwyer and Kevin Flynn, ''102 Minutes'' (Times Books, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Jon Weiner, &quot;Rudy: Worse than Bush?&quot;, thenation.com, August 1, 2007 http://www.alternet.org/story/58480/]&lt;/ref&gt; Giuliani testified to the Commission, where some family members of responders who had died in the attacks appeared to protest his statements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Giuliani Faces 9/11 Questions|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,,-6519758,00.html|accessdate=June 12, 2007|work=The Guardian|location=London|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070506073310/http://www.guardian.co.uk/worldlatest/story/0,,-6519758,00.html |archivedate = May 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1994 mayoral office study of the radios indicated that they were faulty. Replacement radios were purchased in a $33 million [[no-bid contract]] with [[Motorola]], and implemented in early 2001. However, the radios were recalled in March 2001 after a probationary firefighter's calls for help at a house fire could not be picked up by others at the scene, leaving firemen with the old [[Analog transmission|analog]] radios from 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=3367678 ABC News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thechief-leader.com/news/2007/0608/Razzle_Dazzle|title=Razzle Dazzle: Rudy Ducking and Running}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book later published by Commission members [[Thomas Kean]] and [[Lee H.

====Public reaction====
In the wake of the attacks, Giuliani gained international attention and was widely hailed for his leadership during the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/books/displaystory.cfm?story_id=4221390|title=Rudolph Giuliani– America's Mayor: Review of ''The Prince of the City: Giuliani, New York and the Genius of American Life'' By Fred Siegel|publisher=''The Economist''|date=July 28, 2005|accessdate=November 15, 2006}} [subscription site]&lt;/ref&gt;
When polled just six weeks after the attack Giuliani received a 79 percent approval rating among New York City voters, a dramatic increase over the 36 percent rating he had received a year earlier– average at the end of a two-term mayorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1302.xml?ReleaseID=547|title=Quinnipiac University Poll|publisher=[[Quinnipiac University]]|date=October 24, 2001|accessdate= March 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quinnipiac.edu/x1318.xml?ReleaseID=603|title= Quinnipiac University Poll|publisher= Quinnipiac University|date=March 2, 2000|accessdate= November 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oprah Winfrey]] called him &quot;America's Mayor&quot; at a 9/11 memorial service held at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] on September 23, 2001;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Giuliani rejects $10 million from Saudi prince|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2001/US/10/11/rec.giuliani.prince/0|work=War Against Terror|publisher=CNN|date=October 12, 2001|accessdate=December 1, 2007|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=July 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interfaithalliance.org/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=8dJIIWMCE&amp;b=172143&amp;ct=147383|accessdate=November 15, 2006|title=City Mourns at Stadium Prayer Service|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061109013723/http://www.interfaithalliance.org/site/apps/nl/content2.asp?c=8dJIIWMCE&amp;b=172143&amp;ct=147383|archivedate=November 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Politico]]'' wrote years later that Giuliani &quot;became known across the world simply by his first name ... a global icon known as 'America’s Mayor'.&lt;ref name=&quot;pol122309&quot;/&gt; Other voices denied it was the mayor who had pulled the city together. &quot;You didn't bring us together, our pain brought us together and our decency brought us together.

====Time person of the year====
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:1101011231 400.jpg|thumb|right|Rudy Giuliani, 2001 ''Time'' [[Person of the Year]].]] --&gt;

After 9/11, and perhaps owing also to his bout with prostate cancer, his public image had been reformed to that of a man who could be counted on to unite a city in the midst of its greatest crisis. Historian Vincent J. Cannato concluded in September 2006: {{quote|With time, Giuliani's legacy will be based on more than just 9/11. He left a city immeasurably better off– safer, more prosperous, more confident– than the one he had inherited eight years earlier, even with the smoldering ruins of the World Trade Center at its heart. Debates about his accomplishments will continue, but the significance of his mayoralty is hard to deny.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/31/AR2006083101160.html ''Washington Post Book World'' September 3, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Giuliani was praised by some for his close involvement with the rescue and recovery efforts, but others argue that &quot;Giuliani has exaggerated the role he played after the terrorist attacks, casting himself as a hero for political gain.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/us/politics/17firefighters.html|title=Among Firefighters in New York, Mixed Views on Giuliani|accessdate=December 1, 2007|last=Wilson|first=Michael|coauthors=Kate Hammer, Trymaine Lee and Matthew Sweeney|date=June 17, 2007|work=Politics|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giuliani has collected $11.4 million from speaking fees in a single year (his demand increasing after the attacks).&lt;ref&gt;[http://cbs2chicago.com/national/topstories_story_138032337.html cbs2chicago.com - Many Wonder, Did Giuliani Profit From 9/11?]&lt;/ref&gt; Before September 11, Giuliani's assets were estimated to be somewhat less than $2 million, but his net worth could now be as high as 30 times that amount.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/17/us/politics/17candidates.html?hp &quot;Wealth Is a Common Factor Among GOP Hopefuls&quot;], ''New York Times'', May 17, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However one must take into account that since then he has been working in the private sector.  As is the case with many politicians, he has made most of his money since leaving office.

====Aftermath====
For his leadership on and after September 11, Giuliani was given an honorary [[knighthood]] ([[Order of the British Empire|KBE]]) by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II]] on February 13, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/europe/02/13/knighthoods/|title=Giuliani joins a distinguished club|publisher=CNN|author=Renolds, Dylan|date=February 13, 2002|accessdate=November 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuliani initially downplayed the [[health effects arising from the September 11, 2001 attacks]] in the [[Financial District, Manhattan|Financial District]] and lower Manhattan areas in the vicinity of the [[World Trade Center site]].&lt;ref name=&quot;smith&quot;&gt;Ben Smith, &quot;Rudy's Black Cloud&quot;, ''New York Daily News'', September 18, 2006, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; He moved quickly to reopen [[Wall Street]], and it was reopened on September 17. In the first month after the attacks, he said &quot;The air quality is safe and acceptable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Anita Gates, &quot;Buildings Rise from Rubble while Health Crumbles,&quot; &quot;New York Times,&quot; September 11, 2006, reporting on the documentary, &quot;Dust to Dust: The Health Effects of 9/11&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the weeks after the attacks, the [[United States Geological Survey]] identified hundreds of [[asbestos]] 'hot spots' of debris dust that remained on buildings. By the end of the month the USGS reported that the toxicity of the debris was akin to that of drain cleaner.&lt;ref name=&quot;alternet&quot;&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/911oneyearlater AlterNet: Special Coverage: 9/11: One Year Later]&lt;/ref&gt; It would eventually be determined that a wide swath of lower Manhattan and Brooklyn had been heavily contaminated by highly caustic and toxic materials.&lt;ref name=&quot;alternet&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/cen/NCW/8142aerosols.html C&amp;En: Cover Story - Chemical Analysis Of A Disaster]&lt;/ref&gt; The city's health agencies, such as the [[Department of Environmental Protection]], did not supervise or issue guidelines for the testing and cleanup of private buildings. Instead, the city left this responsibility to building owners.&lt;ref name=&quot;alternet&quot;/&gt;

Giuliani took control away from agencies such as the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]], the [[Army Corps of Engineers]] and the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]], leaving the &quot;largely unknown&quot; city Department of Design and Construction in charge of recovery and cleanup. Documents indicate that the Giuliani administration never enforced federal requirements requiring the wearing of [[respirators]]. Concurrently, the administration threatened companies with dismissal if cleanup work slowed.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony DePalma, [http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/14/nyregion/14giuliani.html?hp &quot;Ground Zero Illness Clouding Giuliani's Legacy&quot;], ''New York Times'', May 14, 2007 or&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/22/opinion/22tue1.html?ex=1181534400&amp;en=b54c78a3a378b5b1&amp;ei=5070 Macho Mistakes at Ground Zero] NY Times, May 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007, [[Christie Todd Whitman]], former Republican Governor of [[New Jersey]] and director of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]], reportedly stated that the EPA had pushed for workers at the WTC site to wear respirators but that she had been blocked by Giuliani. She stated that she believed that the subsequent [[lung disease]] and deaths suffered by WTC responders were a result of these actions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/news/2007/06/23/2007-06-23_christie_blasts_rudy_on_wtc_air-1.html &quot;Christie blasts Rudy on WTC air&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, former deputy mayor [[Joe Lhota]], then with the Giuliani campaign, replied, &quot;All workers at Ground Zero were instructed repeatedly to wear their respirators.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Murray|first=Mark|title=Pushing Back Against Whitman|date=June 25, 2007|url=http://firstread.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2007/06/25/234621.aspx|accessdate= July 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuliani asked the city's Congressional delegation to limit the city's [[Legal liability|liability]] for Ground Zero illnesses be limited to a total of $350 million.

In February 2007, the [[International Association of Fire Fighters]] issued a letter asserting that Giuliani rushed to conclude the recovery effort once gold and silver had been recovered from World Trade Center vaults and thereby prevented the remains of many victims from being recovered: &quot;Mayor Giuliani's actions meant that fire fighters and citizens who perished would either remain buried at Ground Zero forever, with no [[closure (psychology)|closure]] for families, or be removed like garbage and deposited at the [[Fresh Kills Landfill]]&quot;, it said, adding: &quot;Hundreds remained entombed in Ground Zero when Giuliani gave up on them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/09/giuliani.firefighters.ap/index.html Giuliani &amp; New York firefighters]&lt;/ref&gt; Lawyers for the International Association of Fire Fighters seek to interview Giuliani under oath as part of a federal legal action alleging that New York City negligently dumped body parts and other human remains in the Fresh Kills Landfill.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-giuliani8apr08,0,2321840,print.story?coll=la-home-headlines &quot;Giuliani foes plan to use 9/11 against him&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since leaving office as Mayor, Giuliani has remained politically active by campaigning for Republican candidates for political offices at all levels. He was a speaker at the [[2004 Republican National Convention]], where he endorsed President [[George W. Bush]] for re-election by recalling that immediately after the World Trade Center towers fell, {{quote|Without really thinking, based on just emotion, spontaneous, I grabbed the arm of then-Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, and I said to him, 'Bernie, thank God George Bush is our president'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.cnn.com/2004-08-30/politics/giuliani.transcript_1_giuliani-governor-pataki-mayor-bloomberg/2?_s=PM:ALLPOLITICS | title=Giuliani: 'Thank God that George Bush is our president' | publisher=CNN | date=August 31, 2004 | accessdate=July 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Similarly, in June 2006, Giuliani started a website called [http://wayback.archive.org/web/20060615000000*/http://solutionsamerica.org/ Solutions America] to help elect Republicans candidates across the nation.

After campaigning on Bush's behalf in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 election]], he was reportedly the top choice for [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] after [[Tom Ridge]]'s resignation. When suggestions were made that Giuliani's confirmation hearings would be marred by details of his past affairs and scandals, he turned down the offer and instead recommended his friend and former New York Police Commissioner [[Bernard Kerik]]. After the formal announcement of Kerik's nomination, information about Kerik's past– most notably, that he had ties to organized crime, had been sued for [[sexual harassment]] and had employed an undocumented alien as a domestic servant– became known.

====2008 presidential campaign====
{{Main|Rudy Giuliani presidential campaign, 2008}}
[[File:Rudy08.png|right|thumb|Presidential campaign logo]]
In November 2006 Giuliani announced the formation of an [[exploratory committee]] toward a run for [[United States presidential election, 2008|President of the United States in 2008]]. In February 2007 he filed a &quot;statement of candidacy&quot; and confirmed on the television program ''[[Larry King Live]]'' that he was indeed running.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/02/14/giuliani.lkl/index.html Giuliani 'not confident' war will turn around - CNN.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Early polls showed Giuliani with one of the highest levels of name recognition and support among the Republican candidates. Throughout most of 2007 he was the leader in [[Nationwide opinion polling for the Republican Party 2008 presidential candidates|most nationwide opinion polling among Republicans]]. Original front-runner Senator [[John McCain]] had faded, and most polls showed Giuliani to have more support than any of the other declared Republican candidates, with only former Senator [[Fred Thompson]] and former Governor [[Mitt Romney]] showing greater support in some [[Opinion polling for the Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|per-state Republican polls]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pollingreport.com/wh08rep.htm WH2008: Republicans]&lt;/ref&gt; On November 7, 2007, Giuliani's campaign received an endorsement from [[Evangelicalism|evangelist]], [[Christian Broadcasting Network]] founder, and past presidential candidate [[Pat Robertson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Paul|last=Steinhauser|title=Giuliani, McCain pick up key Christian conservative backing|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/11/07/conservatives.endorsements/index.html#cnnSTCText|publisher=CNN|date=November 7, 2007|accessdate=November 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was viewed by political observers as a possibly key development in the race, as it gave credence that [[Christian evangelism|evangelicals]] and other [[social conservative]]s could support Giuliani despite some of his positions on social issues such as abortion and gay rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc110707&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/21669328|title=Pat Robertson endorses Giuliani|publisher=[[NBC news]]|date=November 7, 2007|accessdate=November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuliani's campaign hit a difficult stretch during November and December 2007, in which [[Bernard Kerik]], whom Giuliani had appointed to or recommended for several top positions, was indicted on 16 counts of tax fraud and other federal charges;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt111007&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/10/nyregion/10kerik.html|title=A Defiant Kerik Vows to Battle U.S. Indictment|author=Russ Buettner and William K.

On March 15, 2006, Congress formed the [[Iraq Study Group]] (ISG). This [[Bipartisanship|bipartisan]] ten-person panel, of which Giuliani was one of the members, was charged with assessing the [[Iraq War]] and making recommendations.

Giuliani has been married three times. On October 26, 1968, soon after he graduated from law school, he married his [[second cousin]] [[Regina Peruggi]], whom Giuliani had known since childhood. In the mid-70s the marriage was in trouble and in 1975 they agreed to a trial separation.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsday102289&quot;&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2007/0212072giuliani12.html Rudy Giuliani's Vulnerabilities - February 12, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Peruggi did not accompany him to Washington when he accepted the job in the [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]]'s Office.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raceforcityhall&quot;/&gt; Giuliani met local television personality [[Donna Hanover]] sometime in 1982, and they began dating when she was working in Miami.

&lt;ref&gt;Giuliani biographer [[Wayne Barrett]] reports that Peruggi's brother believes that Giuliani knew at the time of the marriage that they were second cousins. [[Alan Placa]], Giuliani's best man, later became a priest and helped get the annulment through proper channels.

Andrew first became a familiar sight by misbehaving at Giuliani's first mayoral inauguration, then with his father at [[New York Yankees]] games, of whom Rudy Giuliani is an enthusiastic fan. Andrew became an accomplished [[golf|junior golfer]], although he was later kicked off the golf team at [[Duke University]] on the grounds of misbehavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Anne|last=Blythe|title=Andrew Giuliani flubs Duke golf suit|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/story/1536270.html|work=newsobserver.com|publisher=The News &amp; Observer|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090522112135/http://www.newsobserver.com/news/story/1536270.html|archivedate=May 22, 2009|date=May 21, 2009|accessdate=May 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteen years after Giuliani's father died at age 73 in April 1981 of [[prostate cancer]] at [[Memorial Sloan–Kettering Cancer Center]], Giuliani was diagnosed at age 55 in April 2000 with prostate cancer on [[prostate biopsy]] after an elevated [[prostate cancer screening|screening]] [[prostate specific antigen|PSA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bumiller, Elisabeth|date=April 28, 2000|title=Giuliani fighting prostate cancer; Unsure on Senate|work=The New York Times|page=A1|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/28/nyregion/giuliani-fighting-prostate-cancer-unsure-on-senate.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Giuliani chose a combination prostate cancer treatment consisting of four months of [[neoadjuvant chemotherapy|neoadjuvant]] [[leuprolide|Lupron]] [[Prostate cancer#Hormonal therapy|hormonal therapy]], then low dose-rate [[prostate brachytherapy]] with permanent implantation of ninety TheraSeed radioactive [[palladium-103]] seeds in his prostate in September 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bumiller, Elisabeth|date=September 16, 2000|title=Mayor undergoes cancer treatment; Radioactive seeds implanted in Giuliani's prostate gland|work=The New York Times|page=A1|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/09/16/nyregion/mayor-undergoes-cancer-treatment.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed two months later by five weeks of fifteen-minute, five-days-a-week [[external beam radiotherapy]] at [[Mount Sinai Hospital, New York|Mount Sinai Medical Center]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Bumiller, Elisabeth|date=November 22, 2000|title=Giuliani starts final phase of cancer treatment|work=The New York Times|page=B4|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/11/22/nyregion/giuliani-starts-final-phase-of-cancer-treatment.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; with five months of [[adjuvant chemotherapy|adjuvant]] Lupron hormonal therapy.

===Religion and beliefs===
Giuliani has declined to comment publicly on his religious practice and beliefs, although he identifies religion as an important part of his life. When asked if he is a practicing Catholic, Giuliani answered, &quot;My religious affiliation, my religious practices and the degree to which I am a good or not-so-good Catholic, I prefer to leave to the priests.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,299205,00.html Fox News, October 3, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;
