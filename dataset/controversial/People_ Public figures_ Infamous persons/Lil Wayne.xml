'''Dwayne Michael Carter, Jr.''' (born September 27, 1982), better known by his stage name '''Lil Wayne''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˌ|l|ɪ|l|_|ˈ|w|eɪ|n}}), is an American [[rapping|rapper]].  At the age of nine, Lil Wayne joined [[Cash Money Records]] as the youngest member of the label, and half of the duo, [[The B.G.'z]], with [[B.G. (rapper)|B.G.]]. In 1996, Lil Wayne joined the group [[Hot Boys]], which also included rappers [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]], [[B.G. (rapper)|B.G.]], and [[Turk (rapper)|Young Turk]]. Hot Boys debuted with ''[[Get It How U Live!]]'' that year. Lil Wayne gained most of his success with the group's major selling album ''[[Guerrilla Warfare (album)|Guerrilla Warfare]]'', released in 1999. Also in 1999, Lil Wayne released his Platinum debut album ''[[Tha Block Is Hot]]'', selling over one million copies in the U.S. 

Although his next two albums ''[[Lights Out (Lil Wayne album)|Lights Out]]'' (2000) and ''[[500 Degreez]]'' (2002) were not as successful (only reaching Gold status), Lil Wayne reached higher popularity in 2004 with ''[[Tha Carter]]'', which included the single &quot;[[Go D.J.]]&quot; Wayne also appeared on the [[Destiny's Child]] top ten single &quot;[[Soldier (Destiny's Child song)|Soldier]]&quot; that year. In 2005, the sequel to ''Tha Carter'', ''[[Tha Carter II]]'', was released. In 2006 and 2007, Lil Wayne released several mixtapes and appeared on several popular rap and R&amp;B singles. His most successful album, ''[[Tha Carter III]]'', was released in 2008 and sold over 1 million copies in the U.S. its first week of release. It included the number-one single &quot;[[Lollipop (Lil Wayne song)|Lollipop]]&quot; featuring [[Static Major]]. It also includes the singles &quot;[[A Milli]]&quot; and &quot;[[Got Money]]&quot; featuring [[T-Pain]] and won the [[Grammy Award]] for [[Best Rap Album]]. 

Lil Wayne released his debut rock album, ''[[Rebirth (Lil Wayne album)|Rebirth]]'', in 2010 to primarily negative reception from critics. The album eventually went gold. In March 2010, Lil Wayne began serving an 8-month prison sentence in New York after being convicted of criminal possession of a weapon stemming from an incident in July 2007. While in prison he released another album entitled ''[[I Am Not a Human Being]]'' in September 2010, featuring Young Money artists such as [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]], [[Nicki Minaj]] and [[Lil Twist]]. His ninth studio album and first since being released from prison, ''[[Tha Carter IV]]'', was released on August 29, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Markman |first=Rob |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1667052/lil-wayne-tha-carter-iv.jhtml |title=Lil Wayne's Carter IV 'Totally Done' |publisher=MTV |date=2011-07-11 |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album includes the songs &quot;[[6 Foot 7 Foot]]&quot; featuring [[Cory Gunz]], &quot;[[How to Love]]&quot; and &quot;[[She Will]]&quot; featuring Drake. It sold 964,000 copies in the U.S. its first week out.

He passed [[Elvis Presley]] as the male with the most entries on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart with 109 songs as of September 27, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lil Wayne tops Elvis Presley’s Billboard record|url=http://dailycaller.com/2012/09/27/lil-wayne-tops-elvis-presleys-billboard-record/|publisher=The Daily Caller|accessdate=28 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Lil Wayne was born '''Dwayne Michael Carter, Jr.''' on September 27, 1982, and grew up in the [[Hollygrove, New Orleans|Hollygrove]] neighborhood of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicguide&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|title=Lil Wayne&amp;nbsp;– Biography|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p384397|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|year=2010|accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Carter was born when his mother, a cook, was 19 years old. His parents were divorced when he was 2, and his father permanently abandoned the family. Carter enrolled in the gifted program of Lafayette Elementary School and in the drama club of Eleanor McMain Secondary School.&lt;ref name=&quot;Best MC&quot;/&gt;

Lil Wayne has four children. His first child, daughter Reginae, was born when he was 15,&lt;ref name=&quot;AP Respect&quot;/&gt; to his high school sweetheart [[Antonia &quot;Toya&quot; Carter]] (née Johnson). Wayne and Johnson married on Valentine's Day of 2004 and divorced in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2007/10/toya_carter_2/|title=Toya Carter Speaks Out (Part 2)-|last=Odum|first=Shanel|date=October 1, 2007|work=Vibe|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080822030345/http://www.vibe.com/news/news_headlines/2007/10/toya_carter_2/|archivedate=August 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet rumours started circulating in August 2008 that Wayne's daughter had died in a car crash, which however he quickly cleared up as false saying &quot;Please allow me to dispel any rumors or speculations and report that my daughter is alive, healthy and surrounded by family who care and love her dearly. The rumors are completely false and unfounded; neither Reginae nor any other member of my family has been involved in any car accident.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lil Wayne Clears Up Daughter's Death Reports|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/lil-wayne-clears-up-daughters-death-reports_1077211|work=Contact Music|date=August 13, 2008|accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His second child, Dwayne III, was then born on October 22, 2008 at Christ Hospital in [[Cincinnati]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1597681/20081022/lil_wayne.jhtml|title=Lil Wayne Welcomes A Baby Boy|last=Harris|first=Chris|date=October 22, 2008|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=February 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His third child, Cameron Carter, was born to actress [[Lauren London]] on September 9, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://celebrity-babies.com/2009/09/14/lauren-london-and-lil-wayne-welcome-a-son/ |title=Lauren London and Lil Wayne Welcome a Son |publisher=Celebrity-babies.com |accessdate=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had his fourth child, Neal, on November 30, 2009 with singer [[Nivea (singer)|Nivea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americansuperstarmag.com/news/lil-wayne-expecting-baby-with-nivea|title=Lil Wayne Expecting Baby with Nivea|last=Bunker|first=Chloe|date=October 15, 2009|work=American Superstar Magazine|accessdate=October 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a CBS interview with [[Katie Couric]], Wayne described why he goes by the name of &quot;Wayne&quot; instead of his given name, Dwayne. Carter explained, &quot;I dropped the D because I'm a junior and my father is living and he's not in my life and he's never been in my life. So I don't want to be Dwayne, I'd rather be Wayne&quot;. Couric asked Wayne if his father knew of this and Wayne replied with a smile, &quot;He knows now&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Couric&quot;/&gt;

He wrote his first rap song at age eight.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP Respect&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12992671/|title=Lil’ Wayne wants respect for Southern rap|date=May 31, 2006|publisher=MSNBC|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=February 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1991, he met [[Birdman (rapper)|Bryan Williams]], rapper and owner of [[Cash Money Records]]. Carter recorded freestyle raps on Williams's answering machine, leading him to mentor the young Carter and include him in Cash Money-distributed songs. He also recorded his first ever [[collaboration]] album ''[[True Story (BGz album)|True Story]]'' with rapper [[B.G. (rapper)|B.G.]]. At the time, Carter was 11, and B.G. was 14, and was billed as &quot;[[The B.G.'z]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;new yorker&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Frere-Jones|first=Sasha|title=High and Mighty|url=http://www.newyorker.com/arts/critics/musical/2007/08/13/070813crmu_music_frerejones?currentPage=all|work=The New Yorker|date=August 13, 2007|accessdate=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he was 12, he played the part of the [[Tin Woodman|Tin Man]] in his middle school drama club's production of ''[[The Wiz]]''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news|last=Tyrangiel|first=Josh|title=Lil Wayne: The Best Rapper Alive|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1820148,00.html|work=Time|date=July 3, 2008|accessdate=November 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 13, he accidentally shot himself with a 9&amp;nbsp;mm handgun, and off-duty police officer Robert Hoobler drove him to the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vargas|first=Ramon Antonio|title=Lil Wayne saved by alert off-duty cop|url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/04/how_a_big_cop_saved_a_young_li.html|accessdate=April 24, 2011|newspaper=New Orleans Times-Picayune|date=April 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; At McMain Magnet School, Carter was an honor student, but he dropped out at the age of 14 to focus on a musical career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vibe Nov 2007&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Checkoway|first=Laura|title=The Art of Storytelling|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=mSYEAAAAMBAJ|work=Vibe|volume=15|number=11|pages=116–123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Music career ==

===1997–99: Career beginnings and Hot Boys===
In 1997, Carter joined the [[Hot Boys]] along with rappers [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]], B.G., and [[Turk (rapper)|Turk]]. At age 15, Carter was the youngest member at that time. Hot Boys' debut album ''Get It How U Live!'' was released the same year, followed in 1999 by the group's major-label debut ''[[Guerrilla Warfare (album)|Guerrilla Warfare]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicguide&quot;/&gt; which reached No. 1 on the ''Billboard'' magazine Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and No. 5 on the ''Billboard'' 200.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hot Boys Album Charts&quot;/&gt; During their career, the Hot Boys had two charting singles, &quot;[[We on Fire]]&quot; from ''Get It How U Live!'' and &quot;I Need a Hot Girl&quot; from ''Guerrilla Warfare''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hot Boys&amp;nbsp;– Billboard Singles|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p278459|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=September 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter was also featured on Juvenile's single &quot;[[Back That Azz Up]]&quot;, which reached No. 18 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and No. 5 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p92107|pure_url=yes}} Juvenile – Billboard Singles]. allmusic&lt;/ref&gt; ''Let 'Em Burn'', a compilation album of unreleased tracks recorded during 1999 and 2000, came out in 2003, several years after the group disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Birchmeier|first=Jason|title=Let 'Em Burn – Overview |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r633952|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=September 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reached No. 3 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and No. 14 on the ''Billboard'' 200.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hot Boys Album Charts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hot Boys – Billboard Albums|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p278459|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=allmusic|accessdate=September 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter's debut solo album ''[[Tha Block Is Hot]]'' at age 17 featured significant contributions from the Hot Boys and was certified platinum, debuting at No. 3 on the Billboard album charts.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicguide&quot;/&gt; The album earned him a 1999 ''[[The Source (magazine)|Source]]'' magazine award nomination for &quot;Best New Artist&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;cash money&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Lil Wayne – Tha Carter II|url=http://www.lilwayne-online.com/bio.asp|publisher=[[Cash Money Records]]|year=2005|accessdate=March 29, 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080322174356/http://www.lilwayne-online.com/bio.asp |archivedate = March 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also became a Top Ten hit.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicguide&quot;/&gt; The lead single was &quot;[[Tha Block Is Hot]]&quot;. After the release of ''Tha Block is Hot'', Carter was featured on the single, &quot;[[Bling Bling]]&quot;, with B.G., Juvenile, and Big Tymers. His verse was featured on the radio edition, and on the album version, only his [[Hook (music)|hook]] was featured on the single.

===2000–05: ''Lights Out'', ''500 Degreez'', ''Tha Carter'' and ''Tha Carter II''===
His 2000 follow-up album ''[[Lights Out (Lil Wayne album)|Lights Out]]'' failed to attain the level of success achieved by his debut&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicguide&quot;/&gt; but was certified gold by [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]].&lt;ref name=&quot;riaa&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Gold and Platinum – Lil Wayne|url=http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=&amp;artist=Lil%20wayne&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2010&amp;sort=CertificationDate&amp;perPage=50|publisher=RIAA|accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics pointed to the lack of coherent narratives in his verses as evidence that he had yet to mature to the level of his fellow Hot Boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Juon|first=Steve|title=Lil Wayne – &quot;Lights Out&quot;|url=http://www.rapreviews.com/archive/2001_01_lightsout.html |work=RapReviews.com|date=January 6, 2001|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lead single was &quot;Get Off The Corner&quot; which was noticed for an improvement in lyrical content and style, it also received a music video. The second single which received less attention was &quot;Shine&quot; featuring The ''[[Hot Boys]]''. Near the release of ''Lights Out'', Lil Wayne was featured on the single, &quot;#1 Stunna&quot; with [[Big Tymers]] and [[Juvenile (rapper)|Juvenile]], which rose to 24th place on the [[Hot Rap Tracks]] charts.

Lil Wayne's third album ''[[500 Degreez]]'', released in 2002, followed the format of his previous two, with significant contributions from the [[Hot Boys]] and [[Mannie Fresh]]. While certified Gold like its predecessor,&lt;ref name=&quot;riaa&quot;/&gt; it too failed to match the success of his debut.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicguide&quot;/&gt; The title was a reference to the recently estranged Hot Boys member Juvenile's recording, ''[[400 Degreez]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bush|first=John|title=&quot;500 Degreez&quot; – Overview|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r597992|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|year=2002|accessdate=April 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lead single was &quot;Way Of Life&quot; which like the album failed to match the success of his previous singles. After the release of ''500 Degreez'', he was featured in the single &quot;[[Neva Get Enuf]]&quot; by [[3LW]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moss|first=Corey|title=Remaining 3LW Pair Too Busy To Hold Auditions For New Member|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457967/20021004/3lw.jhtml|work=MTV News|date=October 4, 2002|accessdate=April 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2004, Wayne's album ''[[Tha Carter]]'' was released, marking what critics considered advancement in his rapping style and lyrical themes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kellman|first=Andy|title=Tha Carter &gt; Overview|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r694680|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=allmusic|date=June 29, 2004|accessdate=September 13, 2008}}{{cite web|last=Hoard|first=Christian|title=Lil Wayne: Tha Carter|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/lilwayne/albums/album/6041342/review/6294718/tha_carter|work=Rolling Stone|date=August 5, 2004|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071113085401/http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/lilwayne/albums/album/6041342/review/6294718/tha_carter|archivedate=November 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the album's cover art featured the debut of Wayne's now-signature [[dreadlocks]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicguide&quot;/&gt; ''Tha Carter'' gained Wayne significant recognition, selling 878,000 copies in the United States, while the single &quot;Go DJ&quot; became a Top 5 Hit on the R&amp;B/Hip-Hop chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hope|first=Clover|title=Lil Wayne Nabs Kurupt, Lil' Mo For New CD|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1001433632|work=Billboard|date=November 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the release of ''Tha Carter'', Lil Wayne was featured in [[Destiny's Child|Destiny's Child's]] single &quot;[[Soldier (Destiny's Child song)|Soldier]]&quot; with [[T.I.]], which peaked at No. 3 on the [[U.S. Hot 100]] and the U.S. [[R&amp;B]] Charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Destiny's Child – Billboard Singles|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p278369|pure_url=yes}}|publisher=Allmusic|year=2006|accessdate=March 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Tha Carter II]]'', the follow-up to the original ''Tha Carter'' album, was released in December 2005, this time without production by longtime [[Cash Money Records]] producer [[Mannie Fresh]], who had since left the label. ''Tha Carter II'' sold more than 238,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at No. 2 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] albums chart, and went on to sell 2,000,000 copies world wide. The lead single, &quot;Fireman,&quot; became a hit in the US, peaking at 32 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart. Other singles included &quot;Grown Man&quot;, &quot;Hustler Muzik&quot;, and &quot;Shooter&quot; (featuring R&amp;B singer [[Robin Thicke]]). Lil Wayne also appeared on a remix of [[Bobby V|Bobby Valentino's]] &quot;[[Tell Me (Bobby Valentino song)|Tell Me]]&quot;, which rose to No. 13 on the U.S. [[R&amp;B]] Charts.
In 2005, Lil Wayne was named president of Cash Money, and in the same year he founded [[Young Money Entertainment]] as an imprint of Cash Money.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lil Big Man&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Reid|first=Shaheem|title=Lil Wayne: Lil Big Man|url=http://www.mtv.com/bands/l/lil_wayne/qa_feature_072406/|publisher=MTV News|accessdate=April 22, 2011|date=July 24, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of late 2007, Lil Wayne reported that he has stepped down from the management of both labels and has handed management of Young Money over to Cortez Bryant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weezy F Baby Uncut&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Checkoway|first=Laura|title=Weezy F.

===2006–08: ''Like Father, Like Son'', mixtapes and collaborations===
In 2006, Lil Wayne collaborated with rapper [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]] for the album ''[[Like Father, Like Son (Birdman and Lil Wayne album)|Like Father, Like Son]]'', whose first single &quot;[[Stuntin' Like My Daddy]]&quot;, reached No. 21 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]].

Instead of a follow-up solo album, Lil Wayne reached his audience through a plethora of mixtapes and guest appearances on a variety of pop and hip-hop singles.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicguide&quot;/&gt; Of his many mixtapes, ''[[Dedication 2]]'' and ''[[Da Drought 3]]'' received the most media exposure and critical review. ''Dedication 2'', released in 2006, paired Lil Wayne with DJ Drama and contained the acclaimed socially conscious track &quot;Georgia Bush,&quot; in which Lil Wayne critiqued former US president [[George W.

===Public references by Barack Obama===
Lil Wayne has been referenced in public speeches by President [[Barack Obama]] on at least two occasions, in mixed contexts.

Maybe you are the next Lil Wayne, but probably not, in which case you need to stay in school.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Neyland|first=Nick|title=Barack Obama references Lil Wayne|url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/barack-obama-references-lil-wayne/19824/|work=Prefix|date=July 9, 2008|accessdate=June 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After assuming the Presidency, Obama later echoed this theme of personal and familial responsibility and the difficulty of achieving Lil Wayne's lyrical skills or success—during an address to a meeting commemorating the 100th anniversary of the [[NAACP]], telling the audience:{{quote|They might think they've got a pretty jump shot or a pretty good flow, but our kids can’t all aspire to be [[LeBron James|LeBron]] or Lil Wayne.

Obama has also noted that the music on his iPod includes Lil Wayne:

==Controversy==

===Young Buck===
[[Young Buck]] released a song featuring [[Tony Yayo]] called &quot;Off Parole&quot; which insulted Lil Wayne. Young Buck said that Lil Wayne could not be angry, because Young Buck spoke the truth. Young Buck also said &quot;You think you got a problem with Juve and B.G.; you'll have a true problem with me&quot;, referring to the Cash Money-Juvenile/B.G feud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapbasement.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2176&amp;Itemid=35 Young Buck and Lil Wayne controversy].

SOHH. Accessed July 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the reasons 50 Cent stated he was dismissing Young Buck was what he called &quot;inconsistent behavior&quot; which included appearing on stage with Lil Wayne, then seemingly dissing him on records with G-Unit.&lt;ref name=&quot;phoneleak&quot;&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1589572/20080618/young_buck.jhtml Young Buck Responds To 50 Cent's Leaked Phone Call In New Dis Track -- Listen To It Here!]&lt;/ref&gt; After he was dismissed, Young Buck appeared in the music video &quot;[[My Life (Game song)|My Life]]&quot; by The Game, which featured Lil Wayne in the vocals.&lt;ref name=&quot;mylife&quot;&gt;[[DJ Skee]] (August 1, 2008) [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iCFtFySNqAA The Game ft.

As of 2009 Buck and Wayne have squashed their beef and also linked up to record a track &quot;Up's and Down's&quot; for Young Buck's ''[[Back On My Buck Shit]]'' mixtape.

===50 Cent===
After hearing word that Lil Wayne had written a diss song for him after [[50 Cent]] made some unkind remarks, 50 lashed out at Wayne first on August 17, 2007 with the song &quot;Part Time Lover&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hiphopdx.com/index/news/id.5593 HipHopDX.com – 50 Cent Disses Lil' Wayne]. ''HipHopDX.com''.

===Jay-Z===
In early 2011, when [[Jay-Z]] &amp; [[Kanye West]]'s single &quot;[[H•A•M]]&quot; was released, Jay-Z took shots at Lil Wayne's mentor [[Birdman (rapper)|Birdman]], saying &quot;Really, you got Baby money&quot; and &quot;[you] ain't got [[Beyoncé|my lady's]] money!&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Danielle Canada|url=http://hiphopwired.com/2011/01/12/jay-z-disses-birdman-on-%E2%80%9Ch-a-m-%E2%80%9D-with-kanye-west-audio/ |title=Jay-Z Disses Birdman On &quot;H.A.M.&quot; With Kanye West- Audio|publisher=Hiphopwired.com |date=2011-01-12 |accessdate=2011-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 24, 2011, a song called &quot;[[It's Good]]&quot; by Lil Wayne (featuring [[Drake (entertainer)|Drake]] and [[Jadakiss]]) was leaked online and included Lil Wayne responding &quot;Talkin’ ‘bout baby money?
