== Personal life ==

===Early years===
Glenn Edward Lee Beck was born in [[Everett, Washington]], to William and Mary Beck, who lived in [[Mountlake Terrace, Washington]], at the time of their son's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://heraldnet.com/article/20091002/NEWS01/710029859 date= October 2, 2009 |title=Turns out Glenn Beck actually was born in Everett | author=Julie Muhlstein |newspaper=Everett Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family later moved to [[Mount Vernon, Washington]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Skagit Valley Herald 2009-09-27&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.goskagit.com/home/article/beck_charms_while_protesters_vent/|title=Beck charms while protesters vent|last=Ganser|first=Tahlia|date=September 27, 2009|work=Skagit Valley Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they owned and operated City Bakery in the downtown area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goskagit.com/home/article/beck_charms_while_protesters_vent/ ''The Skagit Valley Herald'', Tahlia Ganser, 9/27/09]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is descended from [[German American|German]] immigrants who came to the United States in the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glennbeck.com/content/articles/article/198/19740 |title=Valkyrie January 5, 2009 |publisher=Glenn Beck |date=2009-01-05 |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beck was raised as a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] and attended Immaculate Conception Catholic School in Mount Vernon.

Glenn and his older sister moved with their mother to [[Sumner, Washington]], attending a [[Jesuit|Jesuit school]]&lt;ref name=&quot;LKamb092609&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewstribune.com/news/local/story/893746.html|title=Among Beck's roots in the state lies a South Sound mystery|first=Lewis|last=Kamb|work=The News Tribune|location=Tacoma|accessdate=2009-10-12|date=2009-09-26}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Puyallup, Washington|Puyallup]]. On May 15, 1979, while out on a small boat with a male companion, Beck's mother drowned just west of [[Tacoma, Washington]], in the [[Puget Sound]]. The man who had taken her out in the boat also drowned. A Tacoma police report stated that Mary Beck &quot;appeared to be a classic drowning victim&quot;, but a [[United States Coast Guard|Coast Guard]] investigator speculated that she could have intentionally jumped overboard.&lt;ref name=&quot;LKamb092609&quot;/&gt; Beck has described his mother's death as a [[suicide]] in interviews during television and radio broadcasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;LKamb092609&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;salon&quot;&gt;[http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/09/21/glenn_beck/ Glenn Beck biography] at [[Salon.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;

After their mother's death, Beck and his older sister moved to their father's home in [[Bellingham, Washington]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Mystery&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/09/21/glenn_beck/print.html|work=Salon Magazine|date=September 21, 2009|author=Alexander Zaitchik|title=The making of Glenn Beck: His roots, from the alleged suicide of his mom to Top 40 radio to the birth of the morning zoo }}&lt;/ref&gt; where Beck graduated from [[Sehome High School]] in June 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;ST2009-09-26&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2009936122_apusglennbeckday.html|title=Glenn Beck's homecoming riles up people in Washington|last=Valdes|first=Manuel|date=2009-09-26|work=Seattle Times|accessdate=2009-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beck also regularly vacationed with his maternal grandparents, Ed and Clara Janssen, in Iowa.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url = http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/05/glenn-beck-key-to-gop-election-hopes|title = Beck and the Beast|date = May 2012|first = Todd S.|last = Purdum|authorlink = Todd Purdum}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the aftermath of his mother's death and subsequent suicide of his stepbrother, Beck has said he used &quot;Dr. [[Jack Daniel's]]&quot; to [[cope]]. At 18, following his high school graduation, Beck relocated to [[Provo, Utah]], and worked at radio station [[KXRK|KAYK]]. Feeling he &quot;didn't fit in&quot;, Beck left [[Utah]] after six months,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynn Arave&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20061125/ai_n16876746|title=Glenn Beck not household name – yet|last=Arave|first=Lynn |date=November 26, 2006|work=Deseret Morning News|accessdate=November 18, 2009|location=Salt Lake City}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking a job at [[Washington, D.C.]]'s [[WPGC (defunct)|WPGC]] in February 1983.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mystery&quot; /&gt;

While working at WPGC, Beck met his first wife, Claire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon-22Sep09&quot;/&gt; In 1983, the couple married and had two daughters, Mary and Hannah. Mary developed [[cerebral palsy]] as a result of a series of strokes at birth in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon-22Sep09&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=Salon Magazine|date=September 22, 2009|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/09/22/glenn_beck_two/print.html|title=Glenn Beck becomes damaged goods; The radio phenom takes over the morning zoo, makes fun of miscarriages and flames out|author= Alexander Zaitchik}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple divorced in 1994 amid Beck's struggles with [[substance abuse]].

By 1994, Beck was suicidal, and imagined shooting himself to the music of [[Kurt Cobain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon-23Sep09&quot; /&gt; He credits [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] (AA) with helping him achieve [[sobriety]]. He said he stopped drinking alcohol and smoking [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] in November 1994, the same month he attended his first AA meeting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon-23Sep09&quot;&gt;{{cite news|work=Salon Magazine|date=September 23, 2009|url=http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/09/23/glenn_beck_three/print.html|title=Glenn Beck rises again: Getting clean, getting Mormon, getting talk radio – and going to Yale, with the help of Joe Lieberman|author= Alexander Zaitchik}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beck later said that he had gotten high every day for the previous 15 years, since the age of 16.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mystery&quot; /&gt;

In 1996, while working for a [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] area radio station, Beck took a [[theology]] class at [[Yale University]], with a written recommendation from Senator [[Joe Lieberman]], a Yale alumnus who was a fan of Beck's show at the time.&lt;ref name = beingglenn /&gt; Beck enrolled in an &quot;Early Christology&quot; course, but soon withdrew, marking the extent of his post-secondary education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon-23Sep09&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Men Style&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.glennbeck.com/about/about-glennbeck.shtml |archiveurl=http://www.premiereradio.com/vfile/2005/07/22.pdf |archivedate=2007-12-08|title=Is Glenn Beck The Most Annoying Man On Tv?

Beck then began a &quot;spiritual quest&quot; in which he &quot;sought out answers in churches and bookstores&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon-23Sep09&quot; /&gt; As he later recounted in his books and stage performances, Beck's first attempt at [[self-education]] involved six wide-ranging authors, comprising what Beck jokingly calls &quot;the library of a [[serial killer]]&quot;: [[Alan Dershowitz]], [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Adolf Hitler]], [[Billy Graham]], [[Carl Sagan]], and [[Friedrich Nietzsche]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon-23Sep09&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name = beingglenn /&gt; During this time, Beck's Mormon friend and former radio partner [[Pat Gray]] argued in favor of the &quot;comprehensive worldview&quot; offered by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], an offer that Beck rejected until a few years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon-23Sep09&quot; /&gt;

In 1999, Beck married his second wife, Tania.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon-23Sep09&quot;/&gt; After they went looking for a faith on a church tour together, they&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon-23Sep09&quot; /&gt; joined The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in October 1999, partly at the urging of his daughter Mary.&lt;ref name=&quot;LDS-Living&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |title=Glenn Beck: The Real Story |author=Jamie Lawson |magazine=LDS Living |year= 2007 |url=http://www.ldsliving.com/story/5768-glenn-beck}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/05/business/media/05radio.html|title=A Folksy Guy, in Recovery, about to land Millions |date=November 11, 2007 |work=The New York Times | first=Brian | last=Stelter | accessdate=2010-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beck was [[Baptism (Mormonism)|baptized]] by his old friend, and current-day co-worker [[Pat Gray]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon-23Sep09&quot; /&gt; Beck and his current wife have had two children together, Raphe (who is adopted) and Cheyenne.

The show was not political and included the usual off-color antics of the genre: juvenile jokes, pranks, and impersonations.&lt;ref name = beingglenn /&gt; The show slipped to third in the market and Beck left abruptly in 1987 amid a dispute with WRKA management. {{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Months later, Beck was hired by [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] [[Top-40]] station [[KYOT|KOY-FM]], then known as Y-95. Beck was partnered with [[Arizona]] native Tim Hattrick to co-host a local &quot;[[morning zoo]]&quot; program.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon-23Sep09&quot;/&gt; During his time at Y-95, Beck cultivated a rivalry with local pop radio station [[KZZP]] and that station's morning host [[Bruce Kelly]]. Through [[practical jokes]] and [[publicity stunts]], Beck drew criticism from the staff at Y-95 when the rivalry culminated in Beck telephoning Kelly's wife on-the-air, mocking her recent [[miscarriage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon-22Sep09&quot;/&gt; In 1989, Beck resigned from Y-95 to accept a job in Houston at [[KRBE]], known as Power 104. Beck was subsequently fired in 1990 due to poor ratings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon-22Sep09&quot;/&gt;

Beck then moved on to [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], and the city's leading [[Top-40]] station, [[WZFT#B-104|WBSB]], known as B104. There, he partnered with [[Pat Gray]], a morning [[Disk Jockey|DJ]]. During his tenure at B104, Beck was arrested and jailed for [[speeding]] in his [[DeLorean DMC-12|DeLorean]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon-23Sep09&quot; /&gt; According to a former associate, Beck was &quot;completely out of it&quot; when a station manager went to [[bail]] him out.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon-23Sep09&quot; /&gt; When Gray, then Beck were fired, the two men spent six months in Baltimore, planning their next move. In early 1992, Beck and Gray both moved to [[WKCI-FM]] (KC101), a [[Top-40]] radio station in [[Hamden, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon-23Sep09&quot;/&gt; In 1995, WKCI apologized after Beck and Gray mocked a Chinese-American caller on air who felt offended by a comedy segment by playing a [[gong]] sound effect and having executive producer Alf Gagineau mock a Chinese accent. That incident led to protests by activist groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mocking Asians&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Wong|first=Stacy|title=Station Apologizes For Mocking Asians|url=http://articles.courant.com/1995-10-20/news/9510200379_1_asian-americans-station-connecticut-asian-american|accessdate=January 18, 2011|newspaper=The Hartford Courant|date=October 20, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Gray left the show to move to [[Salt Lake City]], Beck continued with co-host Vinnie Penn. At the end of 1998, Beck was informed that his contract would not be renewed at the end of 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon-23Sep09&quot;/&gt;

In January 2006, [[CNN]]'s ''[[Headline News]]'' announced that Beck would host a nightly news-commentary show in their new prime-time block ''Headline Prime''.

In March 2003, Beck ran a series of rallies, which he called Glenn Beck's Rally for America, in support of troops deployed for the upcoming [[Iraq War]]. On July 4, 2007, Beck served as host of the 2007 [[Toyota]] Tundra &quot;[[Stadium of Fire]]&quot; in [[Provo, Utah]].

In an ''[[O'Reilly Factor]]'' interview in August 2010, when Beck was asked if he &quot;believe(s) that gay marriage is a threat to [this] country in any way&quot;, he stated, &quot;No I don't…I believe that [[Thomas Jefferson]] said: 'If it neither breaks my leg nor picks my pocket what difference is it to me?'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Tenety, &quot;[http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/undergod/2010/08/glenn_beck_gay_marriage_advocate.html Glenn Beck, Gay Marriage Advocate?]&quot;, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', August 12, 2010, Retrieved October 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

During his 2010 keynote speech to [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] (CPAC), Beck wrote the word &quot;[[progressivism]]&quot; on a chalkboard and declared, &quot;This is the disease.

Liberal historian [[Sean Wilentz]] has denounced what he describes as Beck's progressive-themed [[conspiracy theories]] and &quot;gross historical inaccuracies&quot;, countering that Beck is merely echoing the decades-old &quot;[[right-wing extremism]]&quot; of the [[John Birch Society]].&lt;ref name = &quot;NPR1013&quot;&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=130534982 Glenn Beck: Drawing On 1950s Extremism?] article and full audio story by [[NPR]]'s [[Fresh Air|Fresh Air from WHYY]], October 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wilentz, Beck's &quot;version of history&quot; places him in a long line of figures who have challenged mainstream political historians and presented an inaccurate opposing view as the truth, stating:

{{quote|Glenn Beck is trying to give viewers a version of American history that is supposedly hidden. Supposedly, all we historians – left, right and center – have been doing for the past 100 years is to keep true American history from you. And that true American history is what Glenn Beck is teaching. It's a version of history that is beyond skewed. But of course, that's what Beck expects us to say.

Conservative [[David Frum]], the former speechwriter for President [[George W.

Welch, Jr.]], founder of the [[John Birch Society]], is a key ideological foundation of Beck's worldview.&lt;ref name = &quot;NewYorker&quot;&gt;[[Sean Wilentz|Wilentz, Sean]] (October 18, 2010), [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2010/10/18/101018fa_fact_wilentz?printable=true &quot;Confounding Fathers: The Tea Party’s Cold War Roots&quot;], ''[[The New Yorker]]''&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wilentz: &quot;[Beck] has brought neo-Birchite ideas to an audience beyond any that Welch or Skousen might have dreamed of.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;NewYorker&quot; /&gt;

Other books that Beck regularly cites on his programs are [[Amity Shlaes]]'s ''[[The Forgotten Man: A New History of the Great Depression|The Forgotten Man]]'', [[Jonah Goldberg]]'s ''[[Liberal Fascism]]'', [[Larry Schweikart]] and [[Michael Allen (historian)|Michael Allen]]'s ''[[A Patriot's History of the United States]]'', and [[Burton W.

On June 4, 2010, Beck endorsed [[Elizabeth Dilling]]'s 1936 work ''The Red Network: A Who's Who and Handbook of Radicalism for Patriots'', remarking &quot;this is a book, ''The Red Network'', this came in from 1936.

&quot;Beck's true religion is not [[Patriotism]], [[Mormonism]], or [[Conservatism]]. His true religion is cross-platform self-[[marketing]] ... According to Beck's worldview, there's no inherent contradiction between his sophisticated instinct for [[self-promotion]], his [[propagandist]] rodeo clown act, his self-image as a [[media mogul]], and his professed belief system.

==Public disputes==

===Obama===
Several incidents involving Beck and President [[Barack Obama]] have resulted in notable public controversy. In response to Obama's remarks on the [[Arrest of Henry Louis Gates|Henry Louis Gates controversy]], Beck argued that Obama has repeatedly shown &quot;a deep-seated hatred for white people or the white culture&quot;, saying &quot;I'm not saying he doesn't like white people. I'm saying he has a problem. This guy is, I believe, a [[racism|racist]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ObamaCBS&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Bauder|coauthors=|authorlink=|title=Fox's Glenn Beck: President Obama is a racist|date=2009-07-28|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2009/07/29/politics/main5195604.shtml|agency=Associated Press|pages=|accessdate=2009-07-29|language=|work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; These remarks drew criticism, and resulted in a boycott promulgated by [[Color of Change]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ariens&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris|last=Ariens|coauthors=|authorlink=|title=Glenn Beck's 'Racist' Comment Sends Advertisers Elsewhere|date=2009-07-28|url=http://www.mediabistro.com/tvnewser/fnc/glenn_becks_racist_comment_sends_advertisers_elsewhere_123710.asp|work=TVNewser|pages=|accessdate=2009-08-12|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the boycott resulted in at least 57 advertisers requesting their ads be [[Glenn Beck (TV program)#Boycotts|removed from his programming]], to avoid associating their brands with content that could be considered offensive by potential customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/peopleNews/idUSTRE57C07920090813|title=Fox News' &quot;Glenn Beck&quot; loses advertisers|date=2009-07-12|accessdate=2009-07-13|last=Hein|first=Kenneth|publisher=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Corky|last=Siemaszko|coauthors=|authorlink=|title=Advertisers continue to abandon Glenn Beck after pundit had called President Obama a 'racist'|date=2009-09-03|work=Daily News|location=New York|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2009/09/03/2009-09-03_advertisers_.html|pages=|accessdate=2009-09-03|language=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2009/oct/04/waitrose-fox-news-barack-obama|title=Waitrose dumps Fox News in protest over remarks about Barack Obama|last=Jones|first=Sam|date=October 4, 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=2009-10-06|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later apologized for the remarks, telling [[Fox News Sunday]] anchor [[Chris Wallace (journalist)|Chris Wallace]] that he has a &quot;big fat mouth&quot; and miscast as racism what is actually, as he theorizes, Obama's belief in [[black liberation theology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hagey |first=Keach |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/onmedia/0810/Beck_I_have_a_big_fat_mouth.html |title=Beck: “I have a big fat mouth” |publisher=Politico.com |date=2010-08-29 |accessdate=2012-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Van Jones===
In July 2009, Beck began to focus what would become many episodes on his TV and radio shows on [[Van Jones]], Special Advisor for [[Green Jobs]] at Obama's White House [[Council on Environmental Quality]]. Beck called Jones' &quot;an avowed, self-avowed, radical revolutionary communist.&quot; In rating Beck's claim as &quot;Mostly False,&quot; PolitiFact said &quot;Beck would have been on solid ground if he said Jones used to be a communist. Jones has been up front about that.&lt;ref name=JonesPost&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/sep/08/glenn-beck/glenn-beck-says-van-jones-avowed-communist/ |title=Glenn Beck says Van Jones is an avowed communist |work=PolitiFact.com |accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;

Beck also criticized Jones for his involvement in [[Standing Together to Organize a Revolutionary Movement|STORM]], a Bay Area radical group with Marxist roots,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Washington Post 2009-09-06&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/44/2009/09/06/van_jones_resigns.html|title=White House Adviser Van Jones Resigns Amid Controversy Over Past Activism|last=Wilson|first=Scott|first2=Garance|last2=Franke-Ruta|date=2009-09-06|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=2012-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and his support for [[death row]] inmate [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]], who had been convicted of killing a police officer. Beck spotlighted video of Jones referring to [[U.S. Republican Party|Republicans]] as &quot;assholes&quot;, and a petition Jones signed suggesting that [[George W. Bush]] knowingly let the [[9/11 attacks]] happen. ''Time'' magazine credited Beck with leading conservatives' attack on Jones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time09&quot;/&gt;

In a move attributed by ''The New York Times'' as a response to the controversies by the White House, which had not seen Jones's position as senior enough to warrant a full vetting, and Jones decision that &quot;the agenda of this president was bigger than any one individual,&quot; Jones resigned his position in September 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;The New York Times 2009-09-06&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/07/us/politics/07vanjones.html?_r=1|title=White House Official Resigns After G.O.P. Criticism|last=Brodey|first=John|date=2009-09-06|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2009-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones characterized the attacks from his opponents as a &quot;vicious smear campaign&quot; and an effort to use &quot;lies and distortions to distract and divide&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Washington Post 2009-09-06&quot;/&gt;

===ACORN===
In 2009, Beck and other conservative commentators were critical of [[Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now]] (ACORN) for various reasons, including claims of voter registration fraud in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/09/16/politics/politicalhotsheet/entry5315657.shtml|title=ACORN Sting Lands Housing Group in Conservative Crosshairs|last=Montopoli|first=Brian|date=2009-09-16|work=Political Hotsheet|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=2009-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, he broadcast [[ACORN 2009 undercover videos controversy|a series of alleged undercover videos]] by conservative activists [[James O'Keefe]] and [[Hannah Giles]], which portrayed ACORN community organizers offering inappropriate tax and other advice to people who had said they wanted to import &quot;very young&quot; girls from El Salvador to work as child prostitutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,549241,00.html#ixzz1s4kt8vBM |title=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,549241,00.html#ixzz1s4kt8vBM |accessdate=2012-04-14 |date=2009-09-11 |work=FoNews.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/ny_crime/2010/03/01/2010-03-01_bklyn_acorn_cleared_over_giving_illegal_advice_on_how_to_hide_money_from_prostit.html|title=B'klyn ACORN cleared over giving illegal advice on how to hide money from prostitution|first=Scott|last=Shifrel|accessdate=2010-03-24|date=2010-03-01|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the videos' release, the [[U.S. Census Bureau]] severed ties with the group while the U.S. House and Senate voted to cut all of its federal funding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time09&quot;/&gt;

On December 7, 2009, the former [[Massachusetts Attorney General]], after an independent internal investigation of ACORN, found the videos that had been released appeared to have been edited, &quot;in some cases substantially&quot;. He found no evidence of criminal conduct by ACORN employees, but concluded that ACORN had poor management practices that contributed to unprofessional actions by a number of its low-level employees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proskauer.com/files/uploads/report2.pdf An Independent Governance Assessment of ACORN] December 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=James |first=Frank |url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2009/12/acorn_workers_cleared_of_illeg.html |title=ACORN Workers Cleared Of Illegality By Outside Probe |publisher=Npr.org |date=2009-12-07 |accessdate=2011-05-12| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110511205306/http://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2009/12/acorn_workers_cleared_of_illeg.html| archivedate= 11 May 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://correspondents.theatlantic.com/wendy_kaminer/2009/12/acorn_and_the_ethics_of_leadership.php ACORN and the Ethics of Leadership], ''Atlantic Monthly'', Dec. 8, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nonprofitquarterly.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1654:npq-on-acorn-investigation-results&amp;catid=58:npq-in-the-news&amp;Itemid=54 ACORN Investigation Results], ''The Nonprofit Quarterly''&lt;/ref&gt; On March 1, 2010, the [[District Attorney]]'s office for Brooklyn determined that the videos were &quot;heavily edited&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://nymag.com/daily/intel/2010/03/damaging_brooklyn_acorn_sting.html Damaging Brooklyn ACORN Sting Video Ruled 'Heavily Edited,' No Charges to Be Filed] ''New York Magazine''; March 2, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded that there was no criminal wrongdoing by the ACORN staff in the videos from the Brooklyn ACORN office.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT2010Newman&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Newman | first = Andrew | title = Advice to Fake Pimp Was No Crime, Prosecutor Says | work = [[The New York Times]] | date = 2010-03-01 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/02/nyregion/02acorn.html | accessdate = 2010-03-07| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100325060338/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/02/nyregion/02acorn.html| archivedate= 25 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Salon2010Madden&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Madde | first = Mike | title = Brooklyn prosecutors clear local ACORN office | work = [[Salon.com]] | date = 2010-03-01 | url = http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2010/03/01/acorn_cleared | accessdate = 2010-03-07| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100307082014/http://www.salon.com/news/politics/war_room/2010/03/01/acorn_cleared| archivedate= 7 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April, 1, 2010, an investigation by the [[California Attorney General]] found the videos from Los Angeles, San Diego and San Bernardino to be &quot;heavily edited,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CA AG Report&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ag.ca.gov/cms_attachments/press/pdfs/n1888_acorn_report.pdf

===Satire website===
In 2009, lawyers for Beck brought a case (''[[Beck v. Eiland-Hall]]'') against the owner of a [[satire|satirical]] website named ''GlennBeckRapedAndMurderedAYoungGirlIn1990.com'' with the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]] (WIPO). The claim that the domain name of the website is itself [[defamatory]] was described as a first in [[cyberlaw]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The First Post 2009-09-11&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Jack|last=Bremer|url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/53410,news,fox-news-star-glenn-beck-fights-rape-and-murder-website|title=Fox’s Glenn Beck fights ‘rape and murder’ website|work=[[The First Post]]|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|date=September 11, 2009|accessdate=2009-10-04}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beck's lawyers argued that the site infringed on his trademarked name and that the [[domain name]] should be turned over to Beck.&lt;ref&gt;Nate Anderson, [http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2009/09/can-a-mere-domain-name-be-defamation-glenn-beck-says-yes.ars &quot;Can a mere domain name be defamation?

===Jewish Funds for Justice===
In January 2011, in protest at what they saw as inappropriate references to the Holocaust and to Nazis by Beck (and by [[Roger Ailes]] of Fox News), four hundred rabbis signed an open letter in paid advertisement in ''The Wall Street Journal''. The ad was paid for by [[Jewish Funds for Justice]], which had previously called for Beck's firing. The JFFJ have claimed on their website that Beck seems &quot;to draw his material straight from the anti-Semitic forgery, the ''[[Protocols of the Elders of Zion]]''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishjustice.org/story/2010-11-16/rupert-murdochs-protocols Jewish Funds for Justice website]{{dead link|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter states that Beck and Fox had &quot;...diminish[ed] the memory and meaning of the Holocaust when you use it to discredit any individual or organization you disagree with. That is what Fox News has done in recent weeks.&quot; In response, a [[Fox News]] executive said to [[Reuters]] that the letter was from a &quot;[[George Soros]]-backed leftwing political organization&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jan/27/rabbis-murdoch-fox-glenn-beck-holocaust | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Ed | last=Pilkington | title=Rabbis warn Rupert Murdoch: Fox News and Glenn Beck 'using' Holocaust | date=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKN2620137220110127 | publisher=Reuters | first=Andrew | last=Stern | title=UPDATE 1-Rabbis protest Fox host's use of Holocaust imagery | date=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reform Judaism ===
On February 22, 2011, during a discussion on his radio show about the controversy surrounding his earlier comments about Soros, Beck said &quot;Reform Rabbis are generally political in nature. It's almost like radicalized Islam in a way where it's less about religion than it is about politics.&quot; He was quickly criticized by other conservatives, Jewish rabbis, and others. The [[Anti-Defamation League]] labeled Beck's remarks as &quot;bigoted ignorance&quot;. On February 24, Beck apologized on air, agreeing that his comments were &quot;ignorant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Glenn Beck apologizes for comparing Reform Judaism to radical Islam; says it was a bad analogy|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2011/02/24/2011-02-24_glenn_beck_apologizes_for_comparing_reform_judaism_to_radical_islam_says_it_was_.html|date=February 24, 2011|first=Nina |last=Mandell|work=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]|location=New York|separator=,|postscript=|accessdate=February 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glenn Beck Apologizes For Reform Judaism Comments|url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/glenn-beck-apologizes-for-reform-judaism-comments/|date=February 24, 2011|first=Jon|last=Bershad|work=[[Mediaite]]|separator=,|postscript=|accessdate=February 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011 Norway attacks ===

In the wake of the [[2011 Norway attacks]], Beck received condemnation for his comparison of murdered and surviving members of the Norwegian [[Workers' Youth League (Norway)|Workers' Youth League]] to the [[Hitler Youth]]. He said, &quot;There was a shooting at a political camp which sounds a little like, you know, the Hitler Youth or whatever, you know what I mean. Who does a camp for kids that's all about politics? Disturbing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2011/07/26/glenn-beck-site-of-norway-massacre-sounds-like-the-hitler-youth/ | work=Time | date=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement was ill-received in Norway, leading senior political commentator [[Frank Aarebrot]] to label Beck as a &quot;vulgar propagandist&quot; and a &quot;fascist&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Upset by Hitler comparison&amp;#124;http://www.dagbladet.no/2011/07/25/nyheter/utenriks/usa/innenriks/politikk/17453053/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Torbjørn Eriksen, former press secretary to Norway's prime minister [[Jens Stoltenberg]], to describe Beck's comment as &quot;a new low&quot;, adding that &quot;Glenn Beck's comments are ignorant, incorrect and extremely hurtful&quot;.&lt;ref name=telegraph25jul&gt;{{Cite news|title=Glenn Beck Compares Dead Teenagers to Hitler Youth|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/norway/8660986/Norway-shooting-Glenn-Beck-compares-dead-teenagers-to-Hitler-youth.html|date=July 25, 2011|first=Jon|last=Swaine|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|separator=,|postscript=|accessdate=July 25, 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators pointed out that groups affiliated with the Tea Party movement and the Beck-founded 9–12 Project also sponsor politically oriented camp programs for children.&lt;ref name=telegraph25jul/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dagbladet.no/2011/07/25/nyheter/utenriks/usa/innenriks/politikk/17453053/ |title=Opprørt over Hitler-sammenlikning – nyheter |publisher=Dagbladet.no |date=2011-07-25 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2011/jul/26/glenn-beck-norwegian-dead-hitler | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Ben | last=Quinn | title=Glenn Beck likens Norwegian dead to Hitler youth | date=July 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=JTA |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/glenn_beck/article/beck_likens_norway_victims_to_hitler_youth_20110725 |title=Beck likens Norway victims to Hitler Youth [AUDIO&amp;#93; &amp;#124; Norway |publisher=Jewish Journal |date= |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2011/07/glenn-beck-compares-norwegian-victims-to-hitler-youth/1 | work=USA Today | date=July 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beck condemned the attack in spite of his statements about its victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-07-25/politics/beck.norway_1_glenn-beck-summer-camp-norway?_s=PM:POLITICS | title=Beck: Norway slaughter camp smacks of 'Hitler Youth' | publisher=CNN | date=July 25, 2011 | accessdate=July 27, 2011 | author=Wire Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;
