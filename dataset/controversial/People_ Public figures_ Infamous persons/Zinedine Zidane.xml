'''Zinedine Yazid Zidane''' ({{IPA-fr|zinedin zidan}}, [[Kabyle language|Kabyle]]: ''Zinəddin Lyazid Zidan'', [[Arabic]] &quot;زين الدين زيدان&quot;; born 23 June 1972) is a retired [[Football in France|French footballer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;espn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Zinedine Zidane wins the crown again | publisher=fifa.com | url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/awards/gala/news/newsid=76275.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Zidane's lasting legacy |publisher=bbc.co.uk | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/france/5147908.stm | first=Jonathan | last=Stevenson | date=10 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zidane played as an [[Midfielder|attacking midfielder]], and was the leading figure of a [[Golden Generation#France|generation of French players]] that won the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000|2000 European Championship]]. 

An injury prevented Zidane from playing in France's first two matches in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], and he came back prematurely for the third game despite not being fully fit, but could not prevent France from being eliminated in the group stage. He played in the [[UEFA Euro 2004|2004 European Championship]] where France finished top of their group, but were eliminated in the quarter finals, by the eventual winner of the competition Greece. He briefly retired from international football but returned to the national team in 2005 and captained France to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final|2006 World Cup Final]] where he won the [[FIFA World Cup awards#Golden Ball|Golden Ball]] as the tournament's most outstanding player. 

At club level Zidane won [[La Liga]] and the [[UEFA Champions League]] with [[Real Madrid]], two [[Serie A]] league championships with [[Juventus]] and an [[Intercontinental Cup (football)|Intercontinental Cup]] and a [[UEFA Super Cup]] each with both aforementioned sides. Zidane was voted as [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] on three occasions (1998, 2000 and 2003), and also won the [[Ballon d'Or]] in 1998. Zidane retired from professional football after the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]].

{{TOC limit|3}}

==Early life==
Zidane is of [[Algeria]]n [[Kabyle people|Kabyle]] [[Berber people|Berber]] descent. His parents, Smaïl and Malika, emigrated to Paris from the village of [[Aguemoune]] in the Berber-speaking region of [[Kabylie]] in northern [[Algeria]] in 1953 before the start of the [[Algerian War]]. The family, which had settled in the city's tough northern districts of [[Barbès – Rochechouart (Paris Métro)|Barbès]] and [[Saint-Denis]], found little work in the region, and in the mid-1960s moved to the northern [[Marseille]] suburb of La Castellane. On 23 June 1972, Zidane was born there as the youngest of five siblings. His father Smaïl worked as a warehouseman at a department store, often on the night shift, while his mother was a housewife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2004/apr/04/sport.features &quot;ZZ is back on top&quot;], ''The Guardian'' 4 April 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The family live a reasonably comfortable life by the         standards of the neighbourhood, which was notorious throughout Marseille for its high crime and unemployment rates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football/news-and-comment/john-lichfield-why-france-still-loves-zidane-407511.html &quot;Why France still loves Zidane&quot;], ''The Independent'' (uk)&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in La Castellane that Zidane had his earliest introduction to football, joining in at the age of five in football games that the neighbourhood's children played on the Place Tartane, an 80-by-12-yard plaza that served as the main square of the housing complex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/in-the-footsteps-of-zidane-652076.html In the footsteps Of Zidane], ''The Independent'' (uk)&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011, Zidane named former [[Olympique Marseille]] players [[Blaž Slišković]], [[Enzo Francescoli]] and [[Jean-Pierre Papin]] as his [[wikt:idol|idols]] while growing up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sarajevo-x.com/sport/nogomet/clanak/110702058 |title=Zidane: Slišković mi je bio idol, uživao sam gledati ga - Klix.ba |publisher=Sarajevo-x.com |date= |accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scsport.ba/v2/tekst.php?ID=21674 |title=Zinedine Zidane: Kad porastem želim biti Baka Slišković! |publisher=Scsport.ba |date= |accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club career==

===Youth clubs===
At the age of ten, Zidane got his first player's license after joining the junior team of a local club from La Castellane by the name of US Saint-Henri. After spending a year and a half at US Saint-Henri, Zidane joined SO Septèmes Valons when the Septèmes coach Robert Centenero convinced the club's Director to get Zidane.

Zidane stayed with Septèmes until the age of fourteen, at which time he was selected to attend a three-day training camp at the [[National Football Centre|CREPS]] (Regional Centre for Sports and Physical Education) in [[Aix-en-Provence]], one of several such footballing institutes run by the [[French Football Federation]]. It was here that Zidane was spotted by [[AS Cannes]] scout Jean Varraud who recommended him to the training center director of the club.

===Cannes===
Zidane went to Cannes for a six-week stay, but ended up remaining at the club for four years to play at the professional level. Having left his family at the age of fourteen to join Cannes, he was invited by Cannes director Jean-Claude Elineau, to leave the dormitory he shared with 20 other trainees and to come and stay with him and his family. Zidane later said that it was in living with the Elineaus that he found equilibrium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zizou Top&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2000/jul/02/euro2000.sport2 Zizou Top], ''The Guardian'', 2 July 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Zidane made his professional debut with Cannes on 18 May 1989 at the age of seventeen in a [[Ligue 1]] match against [[FC Nantes|Nantes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/teams/france/5064798.stm], BBC Sport&lt;/ref&gt; He scored his first goal for the club on 8 February 1991 also against Nantes in a 2–1 win. After the match during a party for all the Cannes players, Zidane was gifted a car by Cannes chairman Alain Pedretti, who had promised him one the day he scored his first goal for the club.&lt;ref&gt;Virebayre, Jean. ''Zinedine Zidane: A diamond in the rough''. FIFA magazine Portrait, September 2006, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In his first full season with Cannes, the club secured its first ever European football berth by qualifying for the [[UEFA Europa League|UEFA Cup]] after finishing 4th in the league. This remains the club's highest finish in the top flight since getting relegated for the first time from the first division in the 1948–49 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wildstat.com/p/2601/club/FRA_AS_Cannes |title=Club Cannes (Cannes), France |publisher=Wildstat.com |date= |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bordeaux===
Zidane was transferred to [[FC Girondins de Bordeaux|Girondins de Bordeaux]] in the 1992–93 season, winning the [[1995 UEFA Intertoto Cup|1995 Intertoto Cup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=1995: Bordeaux lay down Intertoto gauntlet |url=http://en.archive.uefa.com/competitions/intertotocup/history/season=1995/intro.html |work=UEFA.com |publisher=Union of European Football Associations |date=1 August 1995 |accessdate=15 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and finishing runner-up in the [[1995–96 UEFA Cup]] in four years with the club. He played a set of midfield combinations with [[Bixente Lizarazu]] and [[Christophe Dugarry]], which would become the trademark of both Bordeaux and the 1998 French national team. In 1995, [[Blackburn Rovers F.C.|Blackburn Rovers]] manager [[Kenny Dalglish]] had expressed interest in signing both Zidane and Dugarry, to which team owner and chairman [[Jack Walker]] reportedly replied, ''&quot;Why do you want to sign Zidane when we have [[Tim Sherwood]]?&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;blackburn&quot;&gt;[http://www.blackburn.vitalfootball.co.uk/article.asp?a=47576 The Ones That Got Away...Zidane] – VitalFootball.co.uk, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Juventus===
In 1996, Zidane moved to [[UEFA Champions League]] winners [[Juventus F.C.|Juventus]] for a fee of £3.2&amp;nbsp;million{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} and won the [[1996–97 Serie A]] and the [[1996 Intercontinental Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Toyota Cup 1996 |url=http://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/clubs/matchreport/newsid=512164.html |work=fifa,com |publisher= Fédération Internationale de Football Association |date=26 November 1996 |accessdate=28 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost in the [[1997 UEFA Champions League Final]] 3–1 to [[Borussia Dortmund]] when he was unable to make an impression against the close marking of [[Paul Lambert]].&lt;ref name = &quot;wizard&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espnstar.com/rss-feed/detail/item617249/ |title=&quot;Paul Lambert - The Norwich wizard&quot; 4th May 2011 ESPN |publisher=Espnstar.com |date=15 November 2009 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Murray |first=Scott |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/blog/2011/nov/25/joy-of-six-football-exports |title=The Joy of Six: British and Irish footballers abroad|publisher=Guardian |date=25 November 2011 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Phil Gordon |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/sport/english-football/norwich-city-manager-paul-lambert-on-his-vision-for-the-future-1.917708 |title=Norwich City manager Paul Lambert on his vision for the future|newspaper=Sunday Herald|date=6 September 2009 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirrorfootball.co.uk/opinion/columnists/michael-calvin/Ian-Holloway-Nigel-Pearson-Paul-Lambert-Kenny-Jacket-Keith-Hill-and-Eddie-Howe-the-British-Football-League-managers-capable-of-being-the-next-Roy-Hodgson-The-Michael-Calvin-Column-article411383.html |title=Revealed: The six British Football League managers capable of being the next Roy Hodgson|publisher=Mirrorfootball.co.uk |date=1 May 2010  |accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Layton |first=Peter |url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/football/view/205190/Mission-impossible-to-keep-new-boys-up/ |title=MISSION IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP NEW BOYS UP|publisher=Dailystar.co.uk |date=9 August 2011 |accessdate=23 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following season, Zidane netted 7 goals in 32 matches in the league to help Juventus win the [[1997–98 Serie A]] and thus retain the Scudetto. In Europe, Juventus made their third consecutive [[UEFA Champions League Final]] appearance, but lost the game [[1998 UEFA Champions League Final|1–0]] to [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]], a club Zidane would later join. Juventus finished second in the [[2000–01 Serie A]], but were eliminated in the group stage of the Champions League, after Zidane was banned for head-butting [[Hamburger SV]] player [[Jochen Kientz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Five-match ban for Zidane |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/champions_league/994847.stm |work=BBC Sport |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |date=27 October 2000 |accessdate=15 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Zidane was named [[Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year]] for the second time.

===Real Madrid===
[[File:Zinedine zidane 2005 cropped.jpg|thumb|Playing for Real Madrid in 2004

]]
In 2001, Zidane joined [[Real Madrid C.F.|Real Madrid]] for a then [[World football transfer record|world record fee]] of 151 billion Italian lire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.juventus.com/news/0,,A_336083&amp;#124;L_IT,00.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010806031702/http://www.juventus.com/news/0,,A_336083&amp;#124;L_IT,00.html|title=Zidane al Real|date=9 July 2001|archivedate=6 August 2001|accessdate=15 September 2011|work=Juventus F.C.|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; (about €75&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juventus.com/wps/wcm/connect/7665be8a-c95d-406e-91db-4de08d142c0c/28_ott_2002_eng_.pdf?MOD=AJPERES&amp;CACHEID=7665be8a-c95d-406e-91db-4de08d142c0c|title=Reports and Financial Statements at 30&amp;nbsp;June 2002 |date=28 October 2002|accessdate=10 May 2012|work=Juventus F.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and signed a four-year contract. He scored a famous match-winning goal, a volley hit with his weaker foot, &lt;!--Leave this as is; POV will be removed--&gt;in Madrid's 2–1 win over [[Bayer Leverkusen]] in the [[2002 UEFA Champions League Final]] completing his personal quadruple. The next season, Zidane helped Real Madrid to win the [[2002–03 La Liga]] and was named the [[2003 FIFA World Player of the Year|FIFA World Player of the Year]] for the third time. In 2004, fans voted him as the best European footballer of the previous 50 years in [[UEFA]]'s fiftieth-anniversary [[UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll|Golden Jubilee Poll]].

While Zidane's [[2005–06 Real Madrid C.F. season|final season]] of club football ended without a trophy, he enjoyed success on a personal note by scoring his first [[hat-trick]] against [[Sevilla FC]] in a 4–2 win in January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/news/newsid=385453.html |title=Zidane revels in maiden hat-trick |publisher=Uefa.com |date=16 January 2006 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended the season for Real Madrid as their second highest goalscorer and assists provider behind team-mates [[Ronaldo]] and [[David Beckham|Beckham]] respectively, with 9 goals and 10 assists in 28 games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Real Madrid Squad Stats (Spanish Primera División) – 2005–06 |publisher=ESPN | url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/team/squad/_/id/86/season/2005/league/esp.1/real-madrid?cc=4716}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 May 2006, Zidane, who had announced his plans to retire after the 2006 World Cup,&lt;ref&gt;

The squad wore commemorative shirts with ''ZIDANE 2001–2006'' below the club logo. He left Real Madrid at the end of the season.

In 2012, Zidane featured for Madrid in an All Stars Match against Manchester United.

==International career==
[[Image:Maillot Zidane.jpg|thumb|140px|A Zidane football shirt, number 10 for France]]
Both France and Algeria consider Zidane a [[Multiple citizenship|citizen]], but he was ineligible to play for the [[Algeria national football team|Algerian national team]]. It was rumoured that coach [[Abdelhamid Kermali]] denied Zidane a position for the Algerian squad because he felt the young midfielder was not fast enough.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://specials.rediff.com/sports/2006/jul/10sld-zid1.htm |title=',The scarred French messiah', |publisher=Specials.rediff.com |date= |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Zidane dismissed the rumour in a 2005 interview, saying that he would have been ineligible to play for Algeria because he had already played for France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://img106.imageshack.us/my.php?image=sanstitre15bu.jpg Le Buteur magazine] 7 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

He earned his first [[Cap (sport)|cap]] with France as a substitute in a [[friendly match|friendly]] against the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]] on 17 August 1994, which ended in a 2–2 draw after Zidane scored twice to help France erase a 2–0 deficit. After [[Eric Cantona|Éric Cantona]] was handed a year-long suspension in January 1995 for assaulting a fan, Zidane took over the playmaker position. France were eliminated in the [[UEFA Euro 1996|Euro 96]] semi-finals in a [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] by the Czech Republic after the match ended 0–0 in extra time.

===1998 World Cup===
The [[1998 FIFA World Cup]] was the first World Cup that Zidane participated in. It was held in his home country France. The French team won all three games in the group stage but Zidane was [[Ejection (sports)#Association football|sent off]] in the second match against [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]] for a stamp on Fuad Anwar, becoming the first French player to receive a red card in a World Cup finals. Without their suspended playmaker France proceeded to win 1–0 in the last sixteen game against [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] and, on his return to the side, defeated [[Italy national football team|Italy]] 4–3 on penalties after a goalless draw in the quarter finals. France then defeated [[Croatia national football team|Croatia]] 2–1 in the semi final. Zidane played a major role in the team's accomplishment, though he had yet to score a goal at the World Cup.

Zidane and France went on to play against defending champions and favourites [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] at the [[Stade de France]] in the [[1998 FIFA World Cup Final]]. France dominated Brazil from the kick-off, with Zidane scoring two identical goals, both headers from corner kicks taken by [[Emmanuel Petit]] and [[Youri Djorkaeff]]. Courtesy of Zidane's brace, France went into the break 2–0 up at half-time with one hand already on the [[FIFA World Cup Trophy|World Cup trophy]]. Emmanuel Petit added a third goal deep in stoppage time to seal the 3–0 win and France's first ever World Cup. Zidane became an instant national hero and his image was projected onto the [[Arc de Triomphe]].

Two years later France won [[UEFA Euro 2000|Euro 2000]], becoming the first team to hold both the World Cup and the European Championship since [[Germany national football team|West Germany]] in 1974. Zidane finished with two goals, a memorable free kick against [[Spain national football team|Spain]] in the quarter final and the [[golden goal]] in the semi final against [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], and was named player of the tournament by UEFA.

===2002 World Cup===
As reigning world and European champions, France entered the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]] as favourites but a thigh injury prevented Zidane from playing in France's first two matches and without their talisman the French team failed to score in either match. He was rushed back prematurely for the third game despite not being fully fit, but could not prevent France from being ignominiously eliminated in the group stage without scoring a single goal; the worst performance by a defending champion in the history of the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://worldcup.espnsoccernet.com/story?id=216185 |title=Arrogant approach finishes favourites |first=John|last=Brewin|publisher=ESPNsoccernet|date=12 June 2002|accessdate=11 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zidane onto the stairs.jpg|thumb|150px|Zidane portraited on stairs prior to [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]]]]
At [[UEFA Euro 2004|Euro 2004]], France topped their group with wins over England and Switzerland, before being knocked out in the quarter finals by eventual champions [[Greece national football team|Greece]] in a surprise 1-0 loss. In the opening match against [[England national football team|England]], Zidane scored a free kick and penalty in stoppage time to turn defeat into a 2–1 victory for France. After France's elimination Zidane announced his retirement from international football.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Zidane quits French national team|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/SPORT/football/08/12/zidane.retirement/ |publisher=CNN |date=12 August 2004|accessdate=11 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006 World Cup===
With the mass retirement of veteran key players such as [[Bixente Lizarazu]], [[Marcel Desailly]], [[Claude Makélélé]] and [[Lilian Thuram]], France struggled to qualify for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]]. At the urging of coach [[Raymond Domenech]], Zidane came out of retirement and was immediately reinstated as team captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The trio helped France rise from fourth place to win their qualifying group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=France 3–0 Faroe Islands: Cisse double strike |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=178912 |author=|publisher=ESPNsoccernet |date=3 September 2005 |accessdate=11 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 27 May 2006, Zidane earned his hundredth cap for France in a 1–0 friendly win over [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], in what would also be his last match at the [[Stade de France]]. Zidane became France's fourth player to reach 100 caps, after Desailly, Thuram and [[Didier Deschamps]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Malouda leads France past Mexico|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Soccer/WorldCup/Groups/G/2006/05/27/1601315-ap.html |first=Jerome |last=Pugmire |agency=Associated Press |date=27 May 2006 |accessdate=11 July 2006 }}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Zinedine zidane wcf 2006-edit.jpg|thumb|150px|Zidane during the 2006 World Cup Final]]
France had a slow start to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] and, after being suspended for the final match of the group stage, Zidane returned to set up a goal for [[Patrick Vieira]] and score one himself in the second round match against [[Spain national football team|Spain]]. In the quarter final France held Brazil to just one shot on goal in the rematch of the 1998 final. Zidane assisted [[Thierry Henry]]'s deciding goal and he was named [[Man of the Match]] by FIFA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Man of the Match: Stage 2 |url=http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/mom/s2.html |publisher=[[FIFA]] |date=1 July 2006 |accessdate=2 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; France faced Portugal in the semi final and, as in [[Brussels]] six years earlier, Zidane's penalty kick decided the contest and sent France to another major final.

Before the [[2006 FIFA World Cup Final]] in Berlin, Zidane was awarded the [[FIFA World Cup awards|Golden Ball]] as the best player of the competition.&lt;ref name=&quot;golden-ball&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|title = Zidane wins Golden Ball award |agency=Reuters UK |date = 10 July 2006|url=http://today.reuters.co.uk/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldFootballNews&amp;storyID=2006-07-10T101142Z_01_L10691436_RTRIDST_0_SPORT-SOCCER-WORLD-ZIDANE-AWARD-UPDATE-1.XML&amp;pageNumber=0&amp;imageid=&amp;cap=&amp;sz=13&amp;WTModLoc=NewsArt-C1-ArticlePage2 |accessdate =13 July 2006 }}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having already announced he was to retire after the expiration of his Real Madrid contract at the end of the 2005–06 season, the world of football already knew Zidane's second World Cup final was to be the last match of his career. Seven minutes into the match Zidane put France ahead with a penalty kick and became only the fourth player in World Cup history to score in two different finals, along with [[Pelé]], [[Paul Breitner]], and [[Vavá]], in addition to being tied for first place with Vavá, Pelé and [[Geoff Hurst]] with three World Cup final goals apiece. He almost scored a second goal during the first period of extra time but his header was saved by Italy's goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. Zidane was then sent off in the 110th minute of the game after [[headbutt]]ing [[Marco Materazzi]] in the chest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2007/aug/18/newsstory.sport2 |title=And Materazzi's exact words to Zidane were... , Football , guardian.co.uk |work=Guardian |location=UK |date= 18 August 2007|accessdate=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; so he did not participate in the penalty shootout which Italy won 5–3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=373706&amp;cc=5901 |title=Materazzi admits to insulting Zidane |publisher=[[ESPN]] |accessdate=16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Zidane said that he &quot;would rather die&quot; than apologize to Materazzi for the headbutt in the final,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/world-cup/story/_/id/749212/ce/uk/?cc=5739&amp;ver=global|title=Zidane: I'd &quot;rather die&quot; than say sorry|date=1 March 2010|work=ESPN|accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also admitted that he “could never have lived with himself” had he been allowed to remain on the pitch and help France win the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://momento24.com/en/2009/12/22/zidane-is-glad-he-was-sent-off-in-the-2006-world-cup-final/comment-page-1/|title=Zidane is glad he was sent off in 2006 World Cup final. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his red card in the final, Zidane retired from professional football, and confirmed that he would not go back on his decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/world_cup_2006/5169342.stm |work=BBC News | title=I'm sorry but no regrets – Zidane | date=12 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced by FIFA to a three game suspension for his red card, but since he had retired from professional football, he agreed to complete three days of community service with children as part of FIFA’s humanitarian projects.

==Post-retirement==
Since his retirement, Zidane regularly plays for the Real Madrid Veterans team. He has also made several [[futsal]] appearances.

In an interview in June 2008, Zidane stated that he wanted to return to football, but that he had no immediate plans to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gordos |first=Phil |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/europe/7468229.stm |title=Zidane tips Ronaldo for Real move |publisher=BBC News |date=22 June 2008 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 June 2009, Zidane was announced as the Advisor to the President after [[Florentino Perez]] was named President of Real Madrid for the second time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realmadrid.com/cs/Satellite/en/1202773095983/noticia/ComunicadoOficial/ANNOUNCEMENT_OF_THE_BOARD_OF_DIRECTORS.htm |title=Real Madrid Board of Director Announcement |publisher=Realmadrid.com |date=1 June 2009 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He along with [[Jorge Valdano]], General Director, and [[Miguel Pardeza]], Sporting Director, were to be the key decision makers on the sporting side of the club.

After France's dismal campaign in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], Zidane said that he did not plan to move into coaching any time soon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/world-cup-2010/teams/france/7843258/World-Cup-2010-Zinedine-Zidane-doesnt-agree-with-France-strike.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=World Cup 2010: Zinedine Zidane doesn't agree with France 'strike' | date=21 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Qatar]]'s 2022 World Cup bid committee announced in September 2010 that Zidane had been appointed as an ambassador for Qatar's attempt to host the 2022 World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://football.uk.reuters.com/leagues/world/news/2010/09/17/LDE68G10A.php |title=Zidane named Qatar's World Cup bid ambassador |agency=Reuters |date= |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After FIFA announced on 2 December 2010 that Qatar had won the bid to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/newscentre/news/newsid=1344500.html |title=2022 FIFA World Cup awarded to Qatar |publisher=Fifa.com |date=2 December 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zidane stated that he was &quot;very pleased&quot; with the outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gulftoday.ae/portal/56d0645c-63c5-4358-bab8-f561f0d5932f.aspx |title=Zidane ‘very pleased’ with Qatar WC choice; Obama disagrees |publisher=Gulftoday.ae |date=4 December 2010 |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, Zidane was appointed as a special adviser to Real Madrid's first team in response to an appeal made by Real Madrid coach [[Jose Mourinho]] for the former Real midfielder to work more closely with the team. In his new role, Zidane is expected to participate in Champions League events and functions. He is also to travel with the first team on a regular basis and participate in pre-match gatherings, training sessions and meetings with the head coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE6AB4K120101112 |title=Zidane made special adviser to Real Madrid first team |agency=Reuters |date= 12 November 2010|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2011 it was announced that he would become Real Madrid's new sporting director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/14067827.stm|title=Zinedine Zidane to become Real Madrid sporting director|date=7 July 2011|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charity activities===
On 24 February 2007, before a crowd of 10,000 fans at a match in northern [[Thailand]] for the Keuydaroon children's AIDS charity, Zidane scored the first goal and set up the second for a [[Malaysia]]n teammate as the match ended 2–2. The event raised [[Baht|฿]]260,000 ($7,750). This money paid for the building of two schools and 16 three-bedroom houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zinedine-zidane-news.newslib.com/story/1409-3237631/ |title=Zidane big fan of Celtic star Nakamura |publisher=Zinedine-zidane-news.newslib.com |date= |accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Zidane in Poznan.jpg|thumb|left|Zidane during an appearance for the [[Danone Nations Cup]]]]

On 19 November 2008, Zidane took part in the fifth annual Match Against Poverty in [[Málaga]], Spain, which also ended in a 2–2 draw; he went scoreless but set up his team’s second goal. He and [[Ronaldo]], who collaborated in conceiving the yearly event to benefit the [[United Nations Development Programme]], regularly captain their respective teams consisting of active footballers, other professional athletes and celebrities. Zidane, a UN goodwill ambassador since 2001, stated before the game that ''&quot;everyone can do something to make the world a better place&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=French Soccer Champion Zinédine Zidane to Be Appointed |publisher=United Nations Information Service Vienna |date=7 March 2001 |url=http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2001/note126.html |accessdate=20 July 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June and July 2009, Zidane toured across Canada with stops in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Although billed as Zidane and &quot;Friends&quot;, the likes of which included [[Fabien Barthez]] and [[Samuel Eto'o]], the exhibition matches featured local players. Tournament organisers cited lack of sponsorship and support from the Canadian Soccer Association for the disorganized rosters. Some proceeds were given to [[Unicef]].

On 6 June 2010, Zidane took part in the bi-annual charity event [[Soccer Aid]]. He played for the Rest Of The World Team, managed by [[Liverpool]] and [[Celtic Football Club|Celtic]] hero [[Kenny Dalglish]] against [[England National Football Team|England]] alongside former Real Madrid teammate [[Luis Figo]], and Celtic legend [[Henrik Larsson]]. He played against former players such as [[Teddy Sheringham]], [[David Seaman]] and [[Alan Shearer]], as well as celebrities such as [[Robbie Williams]]. The Match took place at Old Trafford in Manchester and was won by The Rest of the World for the first time, by penalties after a 2–2 draw.

==Tributes and legacy==
In 2004, ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine named him the 42nd-highest paid athlete in the world, with earnings of US$15.8&amp;nbsp;million a year.&lt;ref&gt;

Filmmakers Philippe Parreno and Douglas Gordon filmed a documentary ''[[Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait]]'', which follows Zidane during an entire match, filmed with 17 cameras. The documentary was part of the 2009 [[Full Frame Documentary Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=&quot;indy weekly&quot;&gt;

Many experts have testified to Zidane's skills and impact as an all-time great, such as Brazil coach [[Carlos Alberto Parreira]] who has labelled Zidane &quot;a monster&quot; for his performance and playing skills. French footballer [[Michel Platini]] states Zidane is one of the most skillful players the game has ever known: &quot;Technically, I think he is the king of what's fundamental in the game – control and passing. I don't think anyone can match him when it comes to controlling or receiving the ball.&quot;

German coach [[Franz Beckenbauer]] stated: &quot;Zidane is one of the greatest players in history, a truly magnificent player.&quot; [[Pelé]], a World Cup winner three times with Brazil, hailed Zidane after seeing Brazil losing to France: &quot;Zidane was the magician in the game.&quot; Italy's manager [[Marcello Lippi]], who has also coached Zidane, opined &quot;I think Zidane is the greatest talent we've known in football these last 20 years, yet he never played the prima donna. I am honoured to have been his manager.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;legacy&quot;&gt;[[Jon Stevenson]].
