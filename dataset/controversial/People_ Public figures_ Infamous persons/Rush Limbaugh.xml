'''Rush Hudson Limbaugh III''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|l|ɪ|m|b|ɔː}}, {{respell|LIM|baw}}; born January 12, 1951) is an American [[radio host|radio talk show host]] and political commentator. Since he was 16 Limbaugh has worked a series of disc jockey jobs. His talk show began in 1984 at [[Sacramento]] radio station [[KFBK (AM)|KFBK]], featuring his ongoing format of political commentary and listener calls. In 1988 Limbaugh began broadcasting his show nationally from radio station [[WABC (AM)|WABC]] in New York City. He currently lives in [[Palm Beach, Florida]], from where he broadcasts the ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'', the [[List of most-listened-to radio programs|highest-rated]] [[talk radio|talk-radio program]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=late&gt;{{cite news |first= Brian|last= Wheeler|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=BBC News Magazine |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17263546 |quote=Currently hosts USA's highest-rated show, with approximately 15 million listeners. |work=[[BBC News|BBC News Magazine]] |date=March 5, 2012 |accessdate=March 18, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= The Top Talk Radio Audiences | year=2011 | publisher= [[Talkers Magazine]]|url=http://www.talkers.com/top-talk-radio-audiences/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[Talkers Magazine]]'' in 2012 lists Limbaugh as the most-listened-to talk show host with a weekly audience of 15 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkers.com/heavy-hundred/  The 100 Most Important Talk Show Hosts in America] ''Talkers Magazine'' 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1990s Limbaugh's books ''The Way Things Ought to Be'' (1992) and ''See, I Told You So'' (1993) made [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].  Limbaugh frequently criticizes, in his books and on his show, what he regards as [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] policies and politicians, as well as what he perceives as a pervasive [[Media bias in the United States#Liberal bias|liberal bias]] in major U.S. media. Limbaugh is among the highest paid people in U.S. media, signing a contract in 2008 for $400 million through 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.businessinsider.com/2008-07-02/tech/30068553_1_radio-host-premiere-radio-networks-new-contract |title=Rush Limbaugh Gets $400 Million To Rant Through 2016 |work=Business Insider |date=July 2, 2008 |author=Hilary Lewis |accessdate=June 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
===Family and background===
{{See also|Limbaugh family}}
Rush Hudson Limbaugh III was born in [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri]], the son of Mildred Carolyn &quot;Millie&quot; (née Armstrong) and Rush Hudson Limbaugh, Jr. His father was a lawyer and a U.S. fighter pilot who served in the [[China Burma India Theater of World War II]]. His mother was a native of [[Searcy, Arkansas]]. The name &quot;Rush&quot; was originally chosen for his grandfather to honor the maiden name of family member Edna Rush.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colford&quot;&gt;Paul D. Colford. ''The Rush Limbaugh story: talent on loan from God: an unauthorized biography.'' New York. St. Martin's Press, 1993. ISBN 0-312-09906-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

His family has many lawyers, including his grandfather, father and brother [[David Limbaugh|David]]. His uncle, [[Stephen N. Limbaugh, Sr.]] is a federal judge in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri]]. His cousin, [[Stephen N. Limbaugh, Jr.]], is currently a judge in the same court, appointed by [[George W. Bush]]. [[Rush Limbaugh, Sr.]], Limbaugh's grandfather was a Missouri prosecutor, judge, special commissioner, member of the [[Missouri House of Representatives]] from 1930 until 1932, and longtime president of the [[Missouri Historical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;''St. Louis Post-Dispatch''. ''The loudest limb on the family tree, radio's Rush Limbaugh is the 'big mouth'; branch of a solid old Cape Girardeau family.'' September 27, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; The Federal Courthouse in Cape Girardeau is named for Limbaugh's grandfather, [[Rush H. Limbaugh, Sr.]].

===Education and Vietnam draft===
Limbaugh began his career in radio as a teenager in 1967 in his hometown of Cape Girardeau, using the name Rusty Sharpe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colford&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Rush Limbaugh Gives Sean a Rare Interview | date=October 19, 2005 | publisher= [[Fox News Channel]]|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,172675,00.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; Limbaugh graduated from [[Central High School (Cape Girardeau, Missouri)|Cape Girardeau, Missouri Central High School]], in 1969. Because of his parents' desire to see him attend college, he enrolled in [[Southeast Missouri State University]] but left the school after two semesters and one summer. According to his mother, &quot;he flunked everything&quot;, and &quot;he just didn't seem interested in anything except radio.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Colford&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Rush is Always Right.&quot; USA Weekend, 24 – January 26, 1992, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Limbaugh was not drafted during the [[Vietnam War]] [[draft lottery (1969)|draft lottery]], as his birth date's high rank (152) was well above the 125 rank below which service members were drafted. He was classified as &quot;[[Class 1-A|1-Y]]&quot; (later reclassified &quot;[[4F (military conscription)|4-F]]&quot;) due to a [[pilonidal cyst]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Colford&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mikkelson, Barbara; Mikkelson, David P. &quot;[http://www.snopes.com/military/limbaugh.htm Draft Notice].&quot; ''[[Snopes]].'' December 16, 2002. Retrieved October 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional career==
===1970s===
After dropping out of college, Limbaugh moved to [[McKeesport, Pennsylvania]]. In 1972, he became a [[Top 40]] music disc jockey on [[WMNY|WIXZ]], a small [[AM radio]] station that reached much of the [[Pittsburgh]] area. He started with an afternoon show and later did mornings, broadcasting under the name Jeff Christie. Limbaugh moved to Pittsburgh station [[KQV]] in 1973 as the evening disc jockey, succeeding [[Jim Quinn]]. He was fired in late-1974, when the station was sold to [[Taft Broadcasting]]. Limbaugh was reportedly told by management that he would never make it as on air talent, and should consider going into sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colford&quot;/&gt; Unable to find another job in local radio, Limbaugh moved back home to Cape Girardeau. He became a lifelong fan of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] from his time in the region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_052209/content/01125104.guest.html&lt;/ref&gt;

For the rest of the decade Limbaugh took jobs at several radio stations, working in music radio, before settling in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]]. In 1979, he left radio and accepted a position as director of promotions with the [[Kansas City Royals]] baseball team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colford&quot;/&gt; There he developed a close friendship with then-Royals star third baseman and future [[List of members of the Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[George Brett (baseball)|George Brett]]; the two remain close friends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Toma | first = George | coauthors = Goforth, Alan &amp; Brett, George | title = Nitty gritty dirt man | publisher = SportsPublishingLLC.com | year = 2004 | page = 164 | url = http://books.google.com/?id=l1xauXzmbvkC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;lpg=PA164&amp;dq=rush+limbaugh+george+brett | isbn = 978-1-58261-646-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s===
In 1984, Limbaugh returned to radio as a talk show host at [[KFBK (AM)|KFBK]] in [[Sacramento, California]], where he replaced [[Morton Downey, Jr.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Colford&quot;/&gt; The repeal of the [[Fairness Doctrine]]—which had required that stations provide free air time for responses to any controversial opinions that were broadcast—by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] in 1987 meant stations could broadcast editorial commentary without having to present opposing views. Daniel Henninger wrote, in a ''[[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'' editorial, &quot;Ronald Reagan tore down this wall (the Fairness Doctrine) in 1987&amp;nbsp;... and Rush Limbaugh was the first man to proclaim himself liberated from the East Germany of liberal media domination.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Henninger, Daniel (April 29, 2005) [http://www.opinionjournal.com/columnists/dhenninger/?id=110006626 &quot;Rush to Victory&quot;]. ''The Wall Street Journal''.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 1988, after achieving success in Sacramento and drawing the attention of former [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]] President [[Edward F. McLaughlin]], Limbaugh moved to New York City and began his national radio show. He debuted just weeks after the [[1988 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]], and just weeks before the [[1988 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]]. Limbaugh's radio home in New York City was the talk-formatted [[WABC (AM)|WABC]], and this remains his [[Flagship (radio)|flagship station]] (although Limbaugh now hosts his program from West Palm Beach).&lt;ref name=&quot;Colford&quot;/&gt;

===1990s===
In December 1990, journalist [[Lewis Grossberger]] wrote in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that Limbaugh had &quot;more listeners than any other talk show host&quot; and described Limbaugh's style as &quot;bouncing between earnest lecturer and political vaudevillian&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Lewis | last=Grossberger | pages=SM58 | title= The Rush Hours |date=December 16, 1990 |work=The New York Times | page=SM58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limbaugh's rising popularity coincided with the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], and his support for the war effort and his relentless ridicule of peace activists. The program gained more popularity and was moved to stations with larger audiences, eventually being broadcast on over 650 radio stations nationwide.

In 1992, Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] was elected president of the United States. Limbaugh satirized the policies of Clinton and [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], as well as those of the Democratic Party. When the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] [[Republican Revolution|won control of Congress in the 1994 midterm elections]], the freshman Republican class awarded Limbaugh an honorary membership in their caucus. This event confirmed him as an influential figure on the national political scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Seelye | first = Katherine Q. | title = Republicans Get a Pep Talk From Rush Limbaugh | pages = A16 |work=The New York Times | date = December 12, 1994 | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DC1E39F931A25751C1A962958260 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000s===

Limbaugh had publicized personal difficulties in the 2000s. In late 2001, he acknowledged that he had gone almost completely deaf, although he continued his show. He was able to regain much of his hearing with the help of [[cochlear implants]].

In 2003, Limbaugh had a brief stint as a [[American football|pro football]] commentator with [[ESPN]]. He resigned a few weeks into the 2003 NFL season after making comments about the press coverage for [[quarterback]] [[Donovan McNabb]] that caused controversy and accusations of racism on the part of Limbaugh. His comment about McNabb was: &quot;I don't think he's been that good from the get-go. I think what we've had here is a little social concern in the NFL. I think the media has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well. They're interested in black coaches and black quarterbacks doing well. I think there's a little hope invested in McNabb and he got a lot of credit for the performance of his team that he really didn't deserve. The defense carried this team.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,493270,00.html &quot;Was Limbaugh Right to Resign from ESPN?&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a sportswriter construed the comment as racist against himself and other sportswriters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2003/writers/peter_king/09/30/mcnabb_limbaugh/ | title=Open mouth, insert foot, Limbaugh's comments on McNabb aren't racist, but they are boneheaded | publisher=SI.com | author=King, Peter | date=September 30, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another sports analyst wrote Limbaugh's viewpoint was shared by &quot;many football fans and analysts&quot; and &quot;it is ... absurd to say that the sports media haven't overrated Donovan McNabb because he's black.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palmer |first=Brian |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2089193/ |title=Rush was right about Donovan McNabb. – Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date=2011-12-05 |accessdate=2011-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2006, Limbaugh turned himself in and was arrested &quot;on a single charge of prescription fraud&quot;.&lt;ref name=CNN2003&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/10/10/rush.limbaugh/ Limbaugh admits addiction to pain medication]. Retrieved 2010-01-04.&lt;/ref&gt; His record was later expunged after 18 months of rehabilitation and paying court costs.

===''The Rush Limbaugh Show''===
{{Main|The Rush Limbaugh Show}}
Limbaugh's radio show airs for three hours each weekday beginning at noon [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Standard Time]] on both AM and FM radio. The program is also broadcast worldwide on the [[Armed Forces Radio Network]].

Radio broadcasting shifted from [[AM broadcasting|AM]] to [[FM broadcasting|FM]] in the late 1970s because of the opportunity to broadcast music in stereo with better fidelity. Limbaugh's show was first nationally syndicated in August 1988, in a later stage of AM's decline. Limbaugh's popularity paved the way for other conservative talk radio programming to become commonplace on the AM radio. In March 2006, [[WBAL (AM)|WBAL]] in [[Baltimore]] became the first major market radio station in the country to drop Limbaugh's nationally syndicated radio program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Hiaasen | first = Rob | title = WBAL Radio Cancels Rush Limbaugh: Station is First to Drop Show, Wants to Focus on Local News | publisher = The Baltimore Sun | date = March 14, 2006 | url = http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/427188/wbal_radio_cancels_rush_limbaugh_station_is_first_to_drop/index.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, ''[[Talkers]]'' magazine again named him No. 1 in its &quot;Heavy Hundred&quot; most important talk show hosts.

Limbaugh frequently mentions the EIB (Excellence In Broadcasting) network, but this is a mythic construction, as he told ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Grossberger, &quot;The Rush Hours&quot;, ''The New York Times'', December 16, 1990, section 6, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, his show was co-owned and first syndicated by [[Edward F. McLaughlin]], former president of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] who founded EFM Media in 1988, with Limbaugh's show as his first product. In 1997, McLaughlin sold EFM to [[Jacor Communications]], which was ultimately bought up by [[Clear Channel Communications]]. Today, Limbaugh owns a majority of the show, which is syndicated by the [[Premiere Radio Networks]].

According to a 2001 article in ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', Limbaugh had an eight-year contract, at the rate of $31.25 million a year.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Vital Statistics&quot;, U.S. News &amp; World Report, July 30, 2001, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Limbaugh earned $33 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/lists/2007/53/07celebrities_Rush-Limbaugh_YNXQ.html The Celebrity 100: #36 Rush Limbaugh.] [[Forbes]]. June 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On July 2, 2008, [[Matt Drudge]] reported that Limbaugh signed a contract extension through 2016 that is worth over $400 million, breaking records for any broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://drudgereport.com/flashrl.htm |title=LIMBAUGH SIGNS THROUGH 2016; $400 MILLION DEAL SHATTERS BROADCAST RECORDS |publisher=Drudgereport.com |date=July 2, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-09 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080731002506/http://www.drudgereport.com/flashrl.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; A November 2008 poll by [[Zogby International]] found that Rush Limbaugh was the most trusted news personality in the nation, garnering 12.5% of poll responses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imao.us/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/media_project_poll_info.pdf Zogby poll]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Television show===
Limbaugh had a [[television syndication|syndicated]] half-hour television show from 1992 through 1996, produced by [[Roger Ailes]]. The show discussed many of the topics on his radio show, and was taped in front of an audience. Rush Limbaugh says he loves doing his radio show&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_060909/content/01125106.guest.html |title=Rush Receives 'Freedom of Speech Award' from Talkers Magazine |publisher=Rushlimbaugh.com |date=2009-06-06 |accessdate=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not a TV show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_111309/content/01125106.guest.html |title=Rush and Roger Ailes Speak at Boy Scouts Awards Dinner |publisher=Rushlimbaugh.com |date=2009-11-11 |accessdate=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other media appearances===
Limbaugh's first television hosting experience came March 30, 1990, as a guest host on [[Pat Sajak]]'s [[CBS]] late-night talk show, ''[[The Pat Sajak Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNK4byQkn7w] Rush Limbaugh guest-hosts the Pat Sajak show in 1990&lt;/ref&gt; [[AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power|ACT UP]] activists in the audience&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Gehr|title=Mouth At Work|work=Newsday| publisher=|page=4|date=1990-10-08|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[heckled]] Limbaugh repeatedly; ultimately the entire studio audience was cleared. In 2001, Sajak said the incident was &quot;legendary around CBS&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=Sajak, Pat|title=CNN Larry King Live|medium=TV series|publisher=CNN|date=2001-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 17, 1993, Limbaugh appeared on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom |last=Maurstad|title=Stern, Limbaugh meet their match; Hosts Leno, Letterman hold their own in war|work=The Dallas Morning News|publisher=|page=1C|date=1993-12-20|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limbaugh also guest-starred (as himself) on a 1994 episode of ''[[Hearts Afire]]''. He appeared in the 1995 [[Billy Crystal]] film ''[[Forget Paris]]'', and in 1998 on an episode of ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]''.

In 2007, Limbaugh made cameo appearances on [[Fox News Channel]]'s short-lived ''[[The 1/2 Hour News Hour]]'' in a series of parodies portraying him as the future President of the United States. In the parodies, his vice president was fellow conservative pundit [[Ann Coulter]]. He also made a cameo in the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode &quot;[[Blue Harvest (Family Guy)|Blue Harvest]]&quot; that year. More recent ''Family Guy'' appearances have been: the 2010 episode &quot;[[Excellence in Broadcasting]]&quot;, and the 2011 episode &quot;[[It's a Trap!]]&quot;, a parody of ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', in which Limbaugh can be heard on the radio claiming that, among other things, the &quot;intergalactic liberal space media&quot; was lying about climate change on the planet [[Hoth]], and that [[Lando Calrissian]]'s administrative position on [[Cloud City]] was a result of [[affirmative action]].

His persona has often been utilized as a template for a stereotypical conservative talk show host on TV shows and in movies, including an episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (as a conservative talk radio host named [[Birch Barlow]]), as Gus Baker on an episode of ''[[Beavis and Butt-head]]'', as Lash Rambo (host of &quot;Perfection in Broadcasting&quot;) on an episode of ''[[The New WKRP in Cincinnati]]'', and as Fielding Chase in the ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'' spinoff film ''Butterfly in Shades of Grey''.

As a result of his television program, Limbaugh became known for wearing distinctive neckties. In response to viewer interest, Limbaugh launched a series of ties&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Penny|last=Parker|page=C–1|title=Ties loud, just like Limbaugh.|date=1996-03-20|work=Denver Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; designed primarily by his then-wife Marta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first=Thomas|last=Vinciguera|page=43|title=No Talk Show, But a Loud Tie|date=1996-08-04|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales of the ties reached over US$5 million in their initial sales year, but were later discontinued.

In January 2010, Chicago's [[The Second City|Second City]] announced a new production, ''Rush Limbaugh: The Musical'', a musical parody-pastiche following in the footsteps of 2009's successful run of ''[[Rod Blagojevich]] Superstar'', which has been written and developed by the same creative team.

On January 30, 2010, Limbaugh was a judge for the [[Miss America 2010|2010 Miss America pageant]] in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/01/29/entertainment/main6154147.shtml|title=Rush Limbaugh Named Miss America Judge: Conservative Radio Host Joins Vivica Fox, Shawn Johnson on 2010 Panel|publisher=[[CBS News]]|accessdate=January 30, 2010 | date=January 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2011, Limbaugh was the subject of the third season of [[Golf Channel]]'s ''[[The Haney Project]]'', in which instructor [[Hank Haney]] coached him in eight episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Hank Haney will dissect Rush Limbaugh's golf game |author=Steve DiMeglio |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/golf/2011-01-10-haney-project-rush-limbaugh_N.htm |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |date=January 11, 2011 |accessdate=April 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and recognition==
A month after [[Bill Clinton]]'s defeat of [[George H. W. Bush]] in 1992, [[Ronald Reagan]] sent Limbaugh a letter in which he thanked him &quot;for all you're doing to promote Republican and conservative principles&amp;nbsp;... [and] you have become the Number One voice for conservatism in our Country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, James (August 1, 2003).

In his May 20, 2010, ''New York Times'' op-ed column, Chafets pointed among others to [[U.S. Senate|Sen.]] [[Arlen Specter]]'s defeat, after being labeled by Limbaugh &quot;Republican in Name Only,&quot; and to [[Sarah Palin]], whose &quot;biggest current applause line—Republicans are not just the party of no, but the party of hell no—came courtesy of Mr. Limbaugh.&quot; More generally, Chafets wrote, Limbaugh has argued the party-of-no [[Ronald Reagan]] conservative course for the Republicans vigorously, notably since six weeks after the Obama inauguration, and has been fundamental to, and encouraging to, the more prominently noted [[Tea Party movement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT01&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/20/opinion/20chafets.html?hp &quot;The Limbaugh Victory&quot;] [[OpEd]] by Zev Chavets, ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 19, 2010 (May 20, 2010, on p.

In his first [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' best seller]], Limbaugh describes himself as conservative, and is critical of broadcasters in many media outlets for claiming to be objective. He has criticized political centrists, independents, and moderate conservatives, claiming they are responsible for Democrat [[Barack Obama]]'s victory over Republican [[John McCain]] in the [[2008 U.S. Presidential Election]] and inviting them to leave the Republican party. He calls for the adoption of core conservative philosophies in order to ensure the survival of the Republican party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Your Conservative Rock&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_110508/content/01125100.guest.html |title=Wednesday Quotes: Your Conservative Rock |publisher=RushLimbaugh.com |work= |date=November 5, 2008|accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Get Off the Ledge, Conservatives!

===African-Americans===
Limbaugh has been noted for making controversial race-related statements with regard to African-Americans.  He has drawn connections between African-American appearance and criminality on several occasions, once opining that all newspaper composite pictures of wanted criminals resembled [[Jesse Jackson]], and another time that &quot;the [[NFL]] all too often looks like a game between the [[Bloods]] and the [[Crips]] without any weapons.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;January 19, 2007 transcript&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/200910120009 |title=January 19, 2007 transcript |publisher=RushLimbaugh.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsday&quot;/&gt;  While employed as what he describes as an &quot;insult-radio&quot; DJ, he used a derogatory racial stereotype to characterize a black caller he could not understand, telling the caller to &quot;take that bone out of your nose and call me back.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsday&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Gehr|title=Mouth At Work|work=Newsday| publisher=|page=4|date=1990-10-08|quote=&quot;For all his bravado, however, Limbaugh is immensely sensitive to charges of insensitivity. When asked about the racist they-all-look-alike connotation of a statement like `Have you ever noticed how all newspaper composite pictures of wanted criminals resemble Jesse Jackson?` this professional talker from a family of lawyers pleads total innocence.`You may interpret it as that, but I, no, honest-to-God, that's not how I intended it at all. Gee, don't get me in this one. I am the least racist host you'll ever find.` Recalling a stint as an `insult-radio` DJ in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he admits feeling guilty about, for example, telling a black listener he could not understand to `take that bone out of your nose and call me back.`&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, Limbaugh used the similarity of recently resigned Rep. [[Eric Massa]]'s surname to the slavery-era African-American pronunciation of &quot;master&quot; to make a pun on the possibility that Gov. [[David Paterson]], New York's first African-American governor, would pick Massa's replacement: &quot;Let's assume you're right [caller]. So, David Paterson will become the massa who gets to appoint whoever gets to take Massa's place. So, for the first time in his life, Paterson's gonna be a massa. Interesting, interesting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;March 9, 2010 transcript&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediamatters.org/mmtv/201003090035 |title=Limbaugh: &quot;For the first time in his life, Paterson is gonna be a massa&quot; if he chooses Massa's replacement |publisher=The Rush Limbaugh Show |date= 201-03-09 |accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limbaugh has asserted that African-Americans, in contrast with other minority groups, are &quot;left behind&quot; socially because they have been systematically trained from a young age to hate America through a widespread movement headed by figures such as [[Jeremiah Wright]], [[Bill Ayers|William Ayers]], and Barack and Michelle Obama.&lt;ref name=&quot;October 14, 2008 transcript&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_101408/content/01125113.guest.html |title=October 14, 2008 transcript |publisher=RushLimbaugh.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capital punishment===
Limbaugh supports capital punishment, saying &quot;the only thing cruel about the death penalty is last-minute stays.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;ontheissues-rush&quot;/&gt;

===Drug abuse===
Limbaugh has been an outspoken critic of what he sees as leniency towards criminal drug use in America. On his television show in October 5, 1995, Limbaugh stated, &quot;too many whites are getting away with drug use&quot; and illegal drug trafficking. Limbaugh proposed that the racial disparity in drug enforcement could be fixed if authorities increased detection efforts, conviction rates, and jail time for whites involved in illegal drugs.&lt;ref name=FAIRDrugs&gt;{{cite web|title=FAIR|url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1159|publisher=FAIR|accessdate=March 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, a week after law enforcement sources told CNN that Limbaugh's name had come up during an investigation into an  OxyContin and hydrocodone black market drug ring, Limbaugh admitted on his radio show to being addicted to prescription pain medication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2003-10-10/entertainment/rush.limbaugh_1_wilma-cline-rush-limbaugh-inaccuracies-and-distortions?_s=PM:SHOWBIZ |title=Limbaugh admits addiction to pain medication – CNN |publisher=CNN |date=2003-10-10 |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[Palm Beach County]] State Attorney charged Limbaugh with doctor shopping to obtain [[OxyContin]]. The State Attorney subsequently reached an agreement with Limbaugh in which the charge was dropped after Limbaugh agreed to pay $30,000 to defray the investigation cost and to complete an 18-month therapy regimen with his physician.&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/menu/rushwire/settlement_agreement_ends_state_investigation_of_rush_limbaugh.guest.html | date= April 28, 2006 | title= Settlement Agreement Ends State Investigation of Rush Limbaugh | publisher= RushLimbaugh.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Limbaugh was arrested based on the findings of a three-year investigation that found &quot;he received about 2,000 painkillers, prescribed by four doctors in six months, at a pharmacy near his Palm Beach mansion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-201_162-1561324.html |title=Rush Limbaugh Arrested On Drug Charges |publisher=CBS News |date= |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental issues===
Limbaugh is critical of environmentalism and climate science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_112509/content/01125106.guest.html |title= So we have now the Four Corners of Deceit, and the two universes in which we live.

[http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_020107/content/stop_the_tape.guest.html Transcript]&lt;/ref&gt; Limbaugh has used the term &quot;environmentalist wacko&quot; when referring to left-leaning environmental advocates.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, {{cite web|url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/estack/idiot_bird_extinct.guest.html.html|title=Idiot Bird Extinct, Future of World at Risk (Transcript)|date=December 1, 2004|publisher=The Rush Limbaugh Show}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a rhetorical device, he has also used the term to refer to more mainstream climate scientists and other environmental scientists and advocates with whom he disagrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Rush_Limbaugh_Energy_+_Oil.htm|title=Rush Limbaugh on energy &amp; oil|date=January 24, 2001|author=Rush Limbaugh, Wednesday Morning Update}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limbaugh has written that &quot;there are more acres of forestland in America today than when Columbus discovered the continent in 1492,&quot; a claim that is disputed by the [[United States Forest Service]] and the [[American Forestry Association]], which state that the precolonial forests have been reduced by about 24% or nearly 300 million acres.&lt;ref name=SierraMag&gt;{{cite web|title=Hey Mr. Green: Tree Lies|url=http://sierraclub.typepad.com/mrgreen/2011/08/tree-lies-.html|publisher=Sierra Magazine|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mojo&gt;{{cite web|title=Big Fat Lies|url=http://motherjones.com/politics/1995/05/big-fat-lies|work=Excerpted from The Way Things Aren't: Rush Limbaugh's Reign of Error (N.Y.: The New Press, 1995|publisher=Mother Jones|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism===
Limbaugh is critical of feminism, saying that &quot;Feminism was established so as to allow unattractive women easier access to the mainstream of society.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,976829,00.html|title=An Interview with Rush Limbaugh|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] magazine|author=Margaret Carlson|date=October 26, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also popularized the term &quot;[[feminazi]]&quot;, referring to about two dozen feminists &quot;to whom the most important thing in life is ensuring that as many abortions as possible occur.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TheWayp296&quot;&gt;Rush H.

Limbaugh, ''The Way Things Ought to Be'', Pocket Books, 1992 [http://books.google.com/books?id=XDVMk6q_pm4C&amp;q=%22Tom+Hazlett%22+%22coined+the+term%22&amp;pgis=1%20 p.193]
:&quot;I prefer to call the most obnoxious feminists what they really are: feminazis. Tom Hazlett, a good friend who is an esteemed and highly regarded professor of economics at the University of California at Davis, coined the term to describe any female who is intolerant of any point of view that challenges militant feminism. I often use it to describe women who are obsessed with perpetuating a modern-day holocaust: abortion.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraq prisoner abuse===
On the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse]] scandal, Limbaugh said, &quot;This is no different than what happens at the [[Skull and Bones]] initiation&amp;nbsp;... And we're going to ruin people's lives over it and we're going to hamper our military effort, and then we are going to really hammer them because they had a good time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/05/23/magazine/23PRISONS.html?pagewanted=3&amp;ei=5007&amp;en=a2cb6ea6bd297c8f&amp;ex=1400644800&amp;partner=USERLAND | title=Regarding the Torture of Others | work=The New York Times | first=Susan | last=Sontag | date=May 23, 2004 | accessdate=March 31, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/05/06/opinion/meyer/main616021.shtml |title=Rush: MPs Just 'Blowing Off Steam', Limbaugh: Abuse Story 'Media-Generated': CBS' Meyer Says Beware |publisher=CBS News |date= May 6, 2004|accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of entertainment props==
Limbaugh utilizes [[Theatrical property|props]] to introduce his [[monologue]]s on various topics. On his radio show, news about the [[homeless]] has often been preceded with the [[Clarence &quot;Frogman&quot; Henry]] song &quot;Ain't Got No Home.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Grossberger-p58&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Lewis |last=Grossberger |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=The Rush Hours |url= |work=The New York Times| publisher= |pages= |page=58 | date=1990-12-16 | accessdate= | language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, [[Dionne Warwick]]'s song &quot;I Know I'll Never Love This Way Again&quot; preceded reports about people with AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Remnick |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Day of the Dittohead |url= |work=The Washington Post| publisher= |pages= |page=C1 | date=1990-12-16 | accessdate= | language= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These later became &quot;condom updates&quot; preceded by [[The 5th Dimension|Fifth Dimension]]'s song, [[Up, Up and Away (song)|''Up, Up and Away'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;Grossberger-p58&quot; /&gt; For two weeks in 1989, on his Sacramento radio show, Limbaugh performed &quot;caller abortions&quot; where he would end a call suddenly to the sounds of a vacuum cleaner and a scream. He would then deny that he had &quot;hung up&quot; on the caller, which he had promised not to do. Limbaugh claims that he used this gag to illustrate &quot;the tragedy of abortion&quot; as well as to highlight the question of whether abortion constitutes murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rush |last=Limbaugh|author=|title=The Way things Ought To Be|publisher=Simon and Schuster|pages=62–66 |page= |date=1990-12-16|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the Clinton administration, while filming his television program, Limbaugh referred to media coverage of [[Socks (cat)|Socks]], the Clintons' cat.

==Claims of inaccuracy==
Some groups and individuals have criticized Limbaugh's accuracy.  The July–August 1994 issue of ''Extra!'', a publication of the [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] group [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting]] (FAIR), alleges 50 different inaccuracies and distortions in Limbaugh's commentary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1895 The Way Things Aren't] ''Extra!'', July–August 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Way Things Aren't: Rush Limbaugh's Reign of Error : Over 100 Outrageously False and Foolish Statements from America's Most Powerful Radio and TV commentator'', Rendall, Steve; Naureckas, Jim; and Cohen, Jeff; W.W. Norton and Company, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Others have since joined FAIR in questioning Limbaugh's facts. [[Al Franken]], a former comedian and current Democratic Senator of Minnesota, wrote a satirical book (''[[Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations]]'') in which he accused Limbaugh of distorting facts to serve his own political biases.&lt;ref&gt;[[Al Franken|Franken, Al]], ''[[Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations]]'', Delacorte Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Limbaugh has been criticized for inaccuracies by the [[Environmental Defense Fund]]. A defense fund report authored by [[Princeton University]] endowed geoscience professor [[Michael Oppenheimer]] and professor of biology David Wilcove lists 14 significant scientific facts that, the authors allege, Limbaugh misrepresented in his book ''[[The Way Things Ought to Be]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.edf.org/documents/2432_WayThingsReallyAre.pdf|title=The way things really are|publisher=Environmental Defense Fund|year=1994|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors conclude that &quot;Rush Limbaugh&amp;nbsp;... allows his political bias to distort the truth about a whole range of important scientific issues.&quot;

On October 14, 2011, Limbaugh questioned the U.S. military initiative against one of the most wanted men in the world [[Joseph Kony]] and his [[Lord's Resistance Army]] (LRA), based on the assumption that they were Christians. &quot;They are fighting the Muslims in Sudan. And Obama has sent troops, United States troops to remove them from the battlefield, which means kill them.&quot; Upon learning about the accusations leveled against Kony, which included kidnapping whole schools of young children for use as child soldiers, Limbaugh stated that he would research the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/08/magazine/08UGANDA.html |title=Charlotte, Grace, Janet and Caroline Come Home |work=The New York Times |date=2005-05-08 |accessdate=2012-01-11 |first=Melanie |last=Thernstrom}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=targets&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/daily/2011/10/14/obama_invades_uganda_targets_christians |title=Obama Invades Uganda, Targets Christians |publisher=[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]] |date=2011-10-14 |accessdate=2011-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The show's written transcript on his website was not changed.&lt;ref name=targets /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/rush-limbaugh-attacked-president-obama-for-targeting-joseph-konys-christian-lra/ |title=Rush Limbaugh Attacked President Obama For ‘Targeting’ Joseph Kony’s ‘Christian’ LRA |publisher=Mediaite |date=2012-03-10 |accessdate=2012-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Limbaugh has been married four times and has no children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marriage.about.com/od/entertainmen1/p/rushlimbaugh.htm &quot;The Marriages of Rush Limbaugh&quot;], by By Sheri &amp; Bob Stritof, About.com.

They were married at the Centenary United Methodist Church in Limbaugh's hometown of [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri]] on September 24, 1977. McNeely filed for divorce in March 1980, citing &quot;incompatibility.&quot; They were formally divorced on July 10, 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colford&quot;/&gt;

In 1983, Limbaugh married Michelle Sixta, a college student and usherette at the [[Kansas City Royals]] Stadium Club. They were divorced in 1990, and she remarried the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colford&quot;/&gt;

===Prescription drug addiction===
On October 3, 2003, the ''[[National Enquirer]]'' reported that Limbaugh was being investigated for illegally obtaining the prescription drugs [[oxycodone]] and [[hydrocodone]]. Other news outlets quickly confirmed the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Candiotti|first=Susan|title=Limbaugh mostly mum on reports of drug probe|publisher=CNN|date=2003-10-03|url= http://www.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/News/10/03/rush.drugs/}}&lt;/ref&gt; He admitted to listeners on his radio show on October 10, 2003, that he was addicted to prescription painkillers and stated that he would enter inpatient treatment for 30 days, immediately after the broadcast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= George Bennett &amp; John Pacenti|url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/localnews/content/news/limbaugh/101103_limbaugh.html|title= Talk host Limbaugh to enter drug rehab|publisher=[[Palm Beach Post]]|page=1A|date=2003-10-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limbaugh stated his addiction to painkillers resulted from several years of severe back pain heightened by a botched surgery intended to correct those problems.

A subsequent investigation into whether Limbaugh had violated Florida's [[doctor shopping]] laws was launched by the [[Palm Beach County|Palm Beach]] [[State Attorney]], which raised privacy issues when investigators seized Limbaugh's private medical records looking for evidence of crimes. On November 9, 2005, following two years of investigations, Assistant State Attorney James L. Martz requested the court to set aside Limbaugh's doctor–patient confidentiality rights and allow the state to question his physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date= November 9, 2005 | title= Prosecutors Push to Speak with Limbaugh Doctors | publisher= The Palm Beach Post | pages=3B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limbaugh's attorney opposed the prosecutor's efforts to interview his doctors on the basis of patient privacy rights, and argued that the prosecutor had violated Limbaugh's [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights by illegally seizing his medical records. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] issued a statement in agreement and filed an [[amicus curiae]] brief in support of Limbaugh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date= January 13, 2004 | title= Improbable ally joins Limbaugh privacy fight | publisher= The St. Petersburg Times | pages=1B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aclufl.org/news_events/?action=viewRelease&amp;emailAlertID=41 |title=Palm Beach Appeals Court to Hear Argument in Limbaugh Medical Records Case |publisher=Aclufl.org |date=April 7, 2004 |location=West Palm Beach |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 12, 2005, Judge David F.

On April 28, 2006, a warrant was issued for his arrest on the charge of doctor shopping. According to Teri Barbera, spokeswoman for the sheriff, during his arrest, Limbaugh was [[arrest|booked]], photographed, and fingerprinted, but not handcuffed. He was then released after about an hour on $3,000 bail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/04/28/national/main1561324.shtml |title=Rush Limbaugh Arrested On Drug Charges, Conservative Radio Commentator Turns Himself In But Claims Innocence |publisher=CBS News |date= April 28, 2006|accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0604/28/ldt.01.html |title=Lou Dobbs Tonight|work=Lou Dobbs Tonight |format=Transcript |publisher=CNN |date=April 28, 2006 |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/LAW/04/28/limbaugh.booked/index.html |title=Rehab, $30,000 to keep Limbaugh out of court|publisher=CNN |date=April 29, 2006 |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his surrender, he filed a &quot;not guilty&quot; plea to the charge. Prosecutors agreed to drop the charge if Limbaugh paid $30,000 to defray the cost of the investigation and completed an 18-month therapy regimen with his physician.&lt;ref name=&quot;http&quot;/&gt;

Limbaugh asserted that the state's settlement agreement resulted from a lack of evidence supporting the charge of [[doctor shopping]]. Under the terms of the agreement, Limbaugh may not own a firearm for eighteen months and must continue to submit to [[drug test#Random drug testing|random drug testing]], which he acknowledges having undergone since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Brian|last=Skoloff| url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/limbaugh_painkillers;_ylt=AoXk6dXtazOH3nAUdJKIsQys0NUE;_ylu=X3oDMTA2Z2szazkxBHNlYwN0bQ--|date=2006-05-01 | agency= Associated Press | title= Limbaugh Facing Drug Tests Under Deal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his addiction became known, Limbaugh had condemned [[illegal drug use]] on his television program, stating that &quot;Drug use, some might say, is destroying this country... And so if people are violating the law by doing drugs, they ought to be accused and they ought to be convicted and they ought to be sent up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Murphy, Jarrett.

Roy Black, one of Limbaugh's attorneys, stated that &quot;Rush Limbaugh was singled out for prosecution because of who he is. We believe the state attorney's office is applying a double standard.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sptimes.com/2004/01/04/State/Limbaugh_may_face_a_r.shtml | date=2004-01-04 | agency= Associated Press | title= Limbaugh may face a rarely used charge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, Limbaugh was detained by drug enforcement agents at [[Palm Beach International Airport]]. Customs officials confiscated [[Viagra]] from Limbaugh's luggage as he was returning from the [[Dominican Republic]]. The prescription was not in Limbaugh's name.&lt;ref name=viagra/&gt;

After he was released with no charges filed, Limbaugh joked about the incident on his radio show, claiming that he got the Viagra at the [[William J. Clinton Presidential Center and Park|Clinton Library]] and was told they were blue [[M&amp;M's]]. He also stated that &quot;I had a great time in the Dominican Republic. Wish I could tell you about it.&quot;&lt;ref name=viagra&gt;{{cite news|title=Rush Limbaugh Detained With Viagra|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/06/27/national/main1753947.shtml|date=2006-06-27|accessdate=2008-09-30|publisher=[[CBS News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cigar aficionado===
In the early 1990s, when the [[cigar boom]] was gaining momentum, Limbaugh was seen frequently with a cigar in hand and by the end of the 1990s, cigars had become Limbaugh's staple in many public appearances. Often starting segments of his show with the phrase, &quot;Amid billowing clouds of fragrant and aromatic first-, second-, and sometimes third-hand premium cigar smoke&quot; as well as mentioning a story print-out in his &quot;formerly nicotine-stained fingers&quot;, cigars became a common topic of discussion. In the spring of 1994, Limbaugh appeared on the cover of the magazine ''[[Cigar Aficionado]]'' and shared the story of his conversion to cigars. He has since been a frequent participant in many events such as &quot;The Big Smoke&quot;, hosted throughout the year by the magazine. Limbaugh has participated in many charity cigar auctions hosted by the magazine, and is known to talk frequently with his listeners about his and their cigar interests, preferences and recommendations. &quot;I think cigars are just a tremendous addition to the enjoyment of life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mervyn| last=Rothstein|title=Rush's Judgment|url=http://www.cigaraficionado.com/Cigar/CA_Profiles/People_Profile/0,2540,18,00.html| publisher=[[Cigar Aficionado]]|accessdate=2006-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also frequently seen in his studio smoking a cigar during his show.

===Deafness===
Rush Limbaugh has described himself as being &quot;100%, totally deaf&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RushLimbaugh.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_101207/content/01125106.guest.html |title=Rush to Excellence Speech for WPHT-AM Philadelphia |publisher=RushLimbaugh.com |date=October 11, 2007 |work=Transcript |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Limbaugh announced that he had lost most of his ability to hear: &quot;I cannot hear television. I cannot hear music.

Limbaugh received a Clarion CII Bionic Ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1571/is_3_18/ai_82554117 |title=Limbaugh learning to listen again: Rush Limbaugh lost most of his hearing because of a rare disease, but the conservative icon says he has not lost his ability to communicate with his audience |publisher=Insight on the News |date=January 28, 2002 |first=Timothy W. |last=Maier |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When questioned whether Limbaugh's sudden hearing loss was caused by his addiction to opiates, his cochlear implant doctor, otolaryngologist  Jennifer Derebery, said that it was possible but that there is no way to know for sure without performing tests that would destroy Limbaugh's hearing completely. &quot;We don't know why some people, but apparently not most, who take large doses may lose their hearing&quot;.&lt;ref name=ABC_GMA&gt;{{cite web|title=Did Drugs Cause Limbaugh's Hearing Loss?|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=128270&amp;page=1|publisher=ABCNews|accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Limbaugh was forced to undergo &quot;tuning&quot; due to an &quot;eye twitch&quot;, an apparent side-effect of cochlear implants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4hearingloss.com/archives/2005/04/rush_to_get_bio.html |title=Rush to get bionic tune up |publisher=4 Hearing Loss |date=April 28, 2005 |work=Transcript |accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Armed Forces Radio===
On May 26, 2004, an article in the left-leaning publication [[Salon.com]] criticized the presence of the Rush Limbaugh Show on [[American Forces Network|American Forces Radio and Television Service]] ([[AFRTS]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2004/05/26/rush_limbaugh/index.html Rush's forced conscripts – Salon.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The article opposed{{why|date=June 2012}} the AFRTS carrying the first hour of Limbaugh's show. Melvin Russell, director of [[AFRTS]], defended Limbaugh's presence, by pointing to Limbaugh's high ratings in the US; in addition, AFRTS produced a [[ballot]] of radio and television shows asking troops worldwide, &quot;Who do you want that we don't at present carry?&quot; ''The Rush Limbaugh Show'' was not listed on the ballot, but won the vote as a write-in by the troops. A later poll by [[Lund Media Research]] found that a majority of soldiers preferred that talk show programs be replaced by [[hip hop]] and [[rap]] stations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.estripes.com/article.asp?section=104&amp;article=36735&amp;archive=true Future military radio menu could be more pop, less talk | Stars and Stripes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michael J. Fox===
In October 2006 Limbaugh said [[Michael J.

Limbaugh said that Fox in the ad had been &quot;shameless&quot; in &quot;moving all around and shaking&quot;, and Fox had not taken &quot;his medication or he's acting, one of the two&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/24/AR2006102400691.html | work=The Washington Post | first=David | last=Montgomery | title=Rush Limbaugh On the Offensive Against Ad With Michael J. Fox | date=October 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox said &quot;the irony of it is I was too medicated&quot;, adding that there was no way to predict how his symptoms would manifest. Limbaugh said he would apologize to Fox &quot;bigley and hugely...if I am wrong in characterizing his behavior on this commercial as an act&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/10/24/politics/main2121910.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Fox Responds To Limbaugh Accusation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 Fox said Limbaugh in 2006 had acted on &quot;bullying instincts&quot; when &quot;he said I faked it. I didn't fake it&quot;, and said Limbaugh's goal was to have him marginalized and shut down for his Stem Cell stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://piersmorgan.blogs.cnn.com/2012/03/15/clips-from-last-night-michael-j-fox-on-rush-limbaugh-meredith-vieira-and-richard-cohen-on-living-with-ms/?iref=allsearch | work=CNN | title=Clips From Last Night: Michael J.

===Phony soldiers===
{{Main|Phony soldiers controversy}}
[[Media Matters]]'  reported radio talk show host Rush Limbaugh in 2007 saying that [[Iraq war]] veterans opposed to the war as &quot;the phony soldiers.&quot; Limbaugh later said that he was speaking of [[Jesse MacBeth]], a  soldier who falsely claimed to have been decorated for valor but, in fact, had never seen combat. Limbaugh said Media Matters was trying to smear him with out of context and selectively edited comments. After Limbaugh published what he said was the entire transcript of phony soldiers discussion, Media Matters said that over a minute and 30 seconds of the transcript was omitted without &quot;notation or ellipsis to indicate that there is, in fact, a break in the transcript.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mmsmearrecast&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title =Limbaugh falsely recasts &quot;phony soldiers&quot; smear| publisher =Media Matters| date=September 28, 2007| url =http://mediamatters.org/research/200709280010| accessdate = 2010-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;clipedit&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title =Limbaugh selectively edited &quot;phony soldiers&quot; clip, claimed it was &quot;the entire transcript&quot;| publisher =Media Matters| date=September 28, 2007| url =http://mediamatters.org/research/200709280009|accessdate = 2010-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Limbaugh said during the minute and a half gap Media Matters had pointed out, he was waiting for relevant  ABC news copy on the topic, and the transcript and audio edits were “for space and relevance reasons, not to hide anything.”&lt;ref name=&quot;RLexplains&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title =Limbaugh Makes His Case| publisher =The National Review Online|date=October 3, 2007| url =http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/222373/limbaugh-makes-his-case/byron-york| accessdate = 2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comments on Obama's policies===
On January 16, 2009, Limbaugh commented on the [[Obama administration|Obama presidency]], &quot;I hope he fails.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;I Hope Obama Fails &quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Limbaugh: I Hope Obama Fails | work = The Rush Limbaugh Show, Transcript | date = January 16, 2009 | url = http://www.rushlimbaugh.com/home/daily/site_011609/content/01125113.guest.html | accessdate = March 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Limbaugh later said that he wants to see Obama's ''policies'' fail, not the man himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bacon | first = Perry, Jr. | title = GOP Seeks Balance With Conservative Icon Limbaugh | pages = A01 |work=The Washington Post | date = March 4, 2009 | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/03/AR2009030303946_pf.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking of Obama, Limbaugh said, &quot;He's my president, he's a human being, and his ideas and policies are what count for me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;I Hope Obama Fails &quot;/&gt;

===Sandra Fluke controversy===
{{main|Rush Limbaugh – Sandra Fluke controversy}}
The Rush Limbaugh–Sandra Fluke controversy ([[IPA]]:{{IPA|flʊk}}) began on February 29, 2012, when Rush Limbaugh's remarks about [[contraceptive mandate]]s included mention of [[Georgetown University Law Center]] student [[Sandra Fluke]] as a &quot;slut&quot; and &quot;prostitute&quot;. Limbaugh was commenting on Fluke's speech the previous week to House Democrats in support of mandating insurance coverage for [[Contraception|contraceptives]]. Despite disapproval from major political figures, Limbaugh made numerous similar statements over the next two days, leading to the loss of 45&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rush Limbaugh loses 45 advertisers |author=MJ Lee |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0312/73675.html |newspaper=Politico |date=March 14, 2012 |accessdate=September 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to &quot;more than 100&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Zielenziger|first=David|title=Limbaugh Boycott Draws Blood: Cumulus Media Cites ‘Drag’ In 2Q Revenue|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/374036/20120815/rush-limbaugh-boycott-romney-ryan-cumulus-premiere.htm|newspaper=International Business Times|date=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; local and national sponsors and Limbaugh's apology on his show for some of his comments.
