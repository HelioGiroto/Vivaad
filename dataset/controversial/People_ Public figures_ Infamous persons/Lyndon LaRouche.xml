'''Lyndon Hermyle LaRouche, Jr.''' (born September 8, 1922), also known as '''Lyn Marcus''', is an American political activist and founder of the [[LaRouche movement]]. He has written on economic, scientific, and political topics, as well as on history, philosophy, and psychoanalysis. Journalists and government officials in China, Italy and Russia have credited LaRouche with forecasting that unrestricted financial speculation would cause the [[late-2000s financial crisis]].&lt;ref&gt;Sources for the description:
*China: &quot;In July of 2007, LaRouche once again warned the world that unless US stopped monopolizing world finances, and united with China, Russia, and India to reorganize the world financial system, a new world wide credit crisis would be unavoidable. But then the bullish Wall Street ignored his warning. One year later, LaRouche's prediction was vindicated again.&quot; [2007年7月，拉鲁什再次向世界发出预警称，除非美、中、俄、印四国能够联合起来重塑世界金融体系，摆脱金融寡头控制，否则，一场席卷全球的严重经济危机将很快到来。当时正值华尔街一片“涨声”、牛气冲天之际，很多人对这一警告嗤之以鼻，但仅仅一年之后，拉鲁什的预言再次应验] Hui, Ju. [http://zqb.cyol.com/content/2009-07/24/content_2771606.htm &quot;The Current World Financial System is Unsalvageable&quot;], ''China Youth Daily'', July 24, 2009. &quot;Famous American economist and independent presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche successfully predicted the Brazilian, Russian and Asian financial crises...  LaRouche, using his predictive tone, tells this journalist that to solve America's economic problem, large surgeries are needed. He said, today's financial and currency system is already unsalvageable, thus it must be radically restructured, not just merely reformed.&quot; [美国著名经济学家、独立总统候选人林登·拉鲁什曾多次成功预言了巴西、俄罗斯和亚洲的金融危机。拉鲁什以预言家的口吻告诉记者，要解决美国经济出现的问题，必须动大手术。他说，当今世界的金融和货币体系已病入膏肓，必须彻底重组，而不能仅仅是加以改革] Tang Yong, ''People's Daily'', April 13, 2005. &quot;The famous Democrat dissenter Lyndon LaRouche also predicted that American led financial system is already collapsing, and if the government does not bail out in time, the results will be unthinkable. &quot; [民主党著名异议人士林登·拉鲁什也早就预言，以美国为代表的世界金融体系已经崩溃，如果政府不及时救市，后果将不堪设想] ''Xinhua,'' [http://gb.cri.cn/19224/2008/10/04/3365s2268021.htm America reported that the financial crisis could have been avoided] October 13, 2008.
*Italy:  &quot;Lyndon LaRouche, the political guru who during the nineties heralded the collapse of speculative finance and the need for a new Bretton Woods.&quot; [Lyndon LaRouche, il politico-guru che dagli anni Novanta annunciava il crac della finanza speculativa e la necessità di una nuova Bretton Woods. ]  {{harvnb|Caizzi|2008}}. &quot;Italian Euro-parliamentarian Mario Borghezio of the Northern League has been quoted as calling LaRouche, 'an heretical economist who had forecast the financial crisis much in advance, and who has long since developed a lucid and deep analysis of the distortions of the world economic system.'&quot;  Foxman, Abraham, ''Jews and Money: The Story of a Stereotype'', p. 125, Macmillan, Nov 9, 2010
*Russia: &quot;LaRouche was one of the first (if not the first) experts who spoke about the global financial crisis.&quot; [Ларуш был одним из первых (если не первым) экспертов, кто заговорил о мировом финансовом кризисе.] Benedictine, Kirill, and Diunov, Michael, [http://terra-america.ru/poslednii-rozenkreicer-part-2.aspx The Last Rosicrucian Pt. 2], ''Terra-America'',  April 23, 2012. &quot;He predicted our Russian default in 1998, and one year ago, speaking at a hearing in the State Duma – the collapse of world markets.&quot; [Он предсказал наш российский дефолт 1998 года, а год назад, выступая в Москве на слушаниях в Государственной Думе, — обвал мировых фондовых рынков.]  Shishova, Tatiana [http://archive.russia-today.ru/2002/no_17/17_world_2.htm   &quot;GLOBALIZATION – THE GREATEST SCAM OF THE XX CENTURY&quot;] ''Russia Today'', 2007.  &quot;Lyndon LaRouche has been gaining popularity thanks to two successful long-term forecasts. In the first one made in the late 50s, he predicted the end of the Bretton Woods system, which was liquidated in 1971. The second forecast predicted a new systemic crisis – the total collapse of the global economic system. Indeed, in the last decade, the world's financial markets began to experience the impact of continuous &quot;seismic shock&quot;, which indicated the beginning of the global systemic crisis of the world economy.&quot; [Линдон Ларуш получил широкую известность благодаря двум удачным долгосрочным прогнозам. В первом из них, сделанном в конце 50-х годов, он предсказал прекращение действия Бреттон-Вудской системы, которая и была ликвидирована в 1971 году. Второй прогноз предрекал новый системный кризис – общий крах глобальной экономической системы. И действительно, в последнее десятилетие мировые ва-лютно-финансовые рынки стали испытывать воздействие непрерывных «сейсмических толчков», что свидетельствовало о начале глобального системного кризиса мировой экономики.] Dyshlevsky, Sergei, [http://www.spekulant.ru/archive/2002_11_st01.html &quot;The Italian Breakthrough&quot;, ''Spekulant'', November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

LaRouche was a presidential candidate eight times between 1976 to 2004, running once for his own [[U.S. Labor Party]] and campaigning seven times for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] nomination. He was sentenced to 15 years' imprisonment in 1988 for conspiracy to commit mail fraud and tax code violations, and was released in 1994 on parole.  [[Ramsey Clark]], who was LaRouche's chief appellate attorney and a former [[U.S. Attorney General]], said that LaRouche was denied a fair trial. The Court of Appeals unanimously rejected the appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1990/01/23/us/appeals-court-upholds-convictions-of-larouche-and-four-others.html?src=pm &quot;Appeals Court Upholds Convictions of LaRouche and Four Others&quot;].

LaRouche was born in Rochester, New Hampshire, the oldest of three children of Jessie Lenore (née Weir) and Lyndon H. LaRouche, Sr.&lt;ref&gt;http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaxtf/view?docId=tbl/viletbl00152.xml;query=;brand=default&lt;/ref&gt; His father worked for the [[United Shoe Machinery Corporation]] in Rochester before the family moved to Lynn, Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Montgomery|1974}} and {{harvnb|King|1989|pp=17–18, 20, 25–26}}.

They forbade him from fighting with other children, even in self-defense, which he said led to &quot;years of hell&quot; from bullies at school. As a result, he spent much of his time alone, taking long walks through the woods and identifying in his mind with great philosophers. He wrote that, between the ages of twelve and fourteen, he read philosophy extensively, embracing the ideas of [[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]], and rejecting those of [[David Hume|Hume]], [[Francis Bacon|Bacon]], [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], and [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;For the parents' religions and other details, see {{harvnb|Witt|2004}}, p. 3, and {{harvnb|King|1989|p=4}}.

In the same year, the Lynn Quakers expelled his father from the group, for reportedly accusing other Quakers of misusing funds, while writing under the pen name Hezekiah Micajah Jones. LaRouche and his mother resigned in sympathy for his father.&lt;ref&gt;For his graduation, see {{harvnb|Tong|1994}}.

===University studies, the army, marriage===
LaRouche attended [[Northeastern University]] in Boston and left in 1942. He later wrote that his teachers &quot;lacked the competence to teach me on conditions I was willing to tolerate.&quot;&lt;ref name=Witt2004p3&gt;{{harvnb|Witt|2004}}, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; As a Quaker, he was a [[conscientious objector]] (CO) during [[World War II]], and joined a [[Civilian Public Service]] camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1989|p=6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944 he joined the [[United States Army]] as a non-combatant and served in India and Burma with medical units. He ultimately worked as an ordnance clerk at the end of the war. He described his decision to serve as one of the most important of his life. While in India he developed sympathy for the [[Indian Independence movement]]. LaRouche wrote that many GIs feared they would be asked to support British forces in actions against Indian independence forces, and that prospect was &quot;revolting to most of us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|LaRouche|1987}}. For the importance of his decision to serve, see pp. 37–38. For his attitude to the Indian independence movement, see pp. 18–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

He discussed [[Marxism]] in the CO camp, and while traveling home on the SS ''General Bradley'' in 1946, he met Don Merrill, a fellow soldier, also from Lynn, who converted him to [[Trotskyism]]. Back in the U.S., he resumed his education at Northeastern University. He returned to Lynn in 1948, and the next year joined the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP), adopting the name &quot;Lyn Marcus&quot; for his political work. He arrived in New York City in 1953, where he worked as a management consultant. In 1954 he married Janice Neuberger, a psychiatrist and member of the SWP. Their son, Daniel, was born in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;For how he adopted Marxism and Trotskyism, for his studies,and joining the SWP, see {{harvnb|LaRouche|1987}}, pp. 62–64.

==1960s==

===Teaching and the National Caucus of Labor Committees===
{{further|National Caucus of Labor Committees}}
{{Quote box4
 |quote  = Twenty to thirty students would ... sit on the floor surrounding LaRouche, who now sported a very shaggy beard ...

}}
By 1961 the LaRouches were living in Central Park West, Manhattan, and LaRouche's activities were mostly focused on his career and not on the SWP. He and his wife separated in 1963, and he moved into a Greenwich Village apartment with another SWP member, Carol Schnitzer, also known as Larrabee.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1989}}, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964 he began an association with an SWP faction called the [[Revolutionary Tendency (SWP)|Revolutionary Tendency]], a faction which was later expelled from the SWP, and came under the influence of British Trotskyist leader [[Gerry Healy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|LaRouche|1970}}.&lt;/ref&gt; For six months, LaRouche worked with American Healyite leader [[Tim Wohlforth]], who later wrote that LaRouche had a &quot;gargantuan ego,&quot; and &quot;a marvelous ability to place any world happening in a larger context, which seemed to give the event additional meaning, but his thinking was schematic, lacking factual detail and depth.&quot;&lt;ref name=Wohlforth&gt;{{harvnb|Wohlforth}}, undated.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967 LaRouche began teaching classes on Marx's [[dialectical materialism]] at New York City's Free School, and attracted a group of students from Columbia University and the City College of New York, recommending that they read ''[[Das Kapital]]'', as well as Hegel, Kant, and Leibniz. During the 1968 [[Columbia University protests of 1968|Columbia University protests]], he organized his supporters under the name the National Caucus of Labor Committees (NCLC). The aim of the NCLC was to win control of the [[Students for a Democratic Society]] branch—the university's main activist group—and build a political alliance between students, local residents, organized labor, and the Columbia faculty.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Steve. ''NCLC Frame Up,&quot; ''Great Speckled Bird'', February 22, 1971.
*Also see {{harvnb|LaRouche|1987}}, p. 116.
*The NCLC was at first called the SDS (Students for a Democratic Society) Labor Committee.
*For LaRouche's teaching, see {{harvnb|King|1989}}, pp. 13–14.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1973 the NCLC had over 600 members in 25 cities—including West Berlin and Stockholm—and produced what King called the most literate of the far-left papers, ''New Solidarity''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1989}}, pp. 17–18.
*Also see Rose, Gregory F. &quot;The Swarmy Life and Times of the NCLC&quot;, ''National Review'', March 30, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; The NCLC's internal activities became highly regimented over the next few years. Members gave up their jobs and devoted themselves to the group and its leader, believing it would soon take control of America's trade unions and overthrow the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mintz|1985}}.
*For members giving up their jobs, see [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F50E17FB385F107A93C2AB178AD85F408785F9 Montgomery, January 20, 1974], and [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46883-2004Oct20_3.html Witt, October 24, 2004, p. 3].&lt;/ref&gt;

==1970s==

===1971: &quot;Intelligence network&quot;===
{{further|LaRouche movement}}
[[Robert J. Alexander]] writes that LaRouche first established an NCLC &quot;intelligence network&quot; in 1971. Members all over the world would send information to NCLC headquarters, which would distribute the information via briefings and other publications.LaRouche organized the network as a series of news services and magazines, which commentators say was done to gain access to government officials under press cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1983}}, p. 189.&lt;/ref&gt; The publications included ''[[Executive Intelligence Review]]'', founded in 1974 and known for its conspiracy theories, alleging that Queen Elizabeth II is the head of an international drug-smuggling cartel, and that the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]] was part of a British attempt to take over the United States.&lt;ref name=Rausch&gt;{{harvnb|Rausch|2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other periodicals included ''New Solidarity'', ''Fusion Magazine'', ''21st Century Science and Technology'', and ''Campaigner Magazine''. His news services and publishers included American System Publications, Campaigner Publications, New Solidarity International Press Service, and The New Benjamin Franklin House Publishing Company. LaRouche acknowledged in 1980 that his followers impersonated reporters and others, saying it had to be done for his security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00611FF3E5410728DDDAF0994DA405B8084F1D3&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=LaRouche+Says+His+Supporters+Take+Covert+Roles+in+Campaign&amp;st=p &quot;LaRouche Says His Supporters Take Covert Roles in Campaign&quot;], ''The New York Times'', February 15, 1980: &quot;Lyndon H. LaRouche, the former head of the U.S. Labor Party who is now running as a Democrat, has said that his campaign workers impersonate reporters and others, contending that the covert operation is needed for his security.&quot;
*Other publications included ''International Journal of Fusion'', ''Investigative Leads'', ''War on Drugs'', ''The Young Scientist'', ''American Labor Beacon'', ''New Federalist'', ''Nouvelle Solidarité'', 'and 'Neue Solidarität''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, ''U.S. News and World Report'' sued New Solidarity International Press Service and Campaigner Publications for damages, alleging that members were impersonating its reporters in phone calls.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, Pat. &quot;Is Lyndon LaRouche using ''your'' name?&quot;, ''Columbia Journalism Review'', March–April 1985, pp. 42–46.
*Also see [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/larouche/larou1.htm Mintz, January 15, 1985].&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. sources told the ''Washington Post'' in 1985 that the LaRouche organization had assembled a worldwide network of government and military contacts, and that his researchers sometimes supplied information to government officials. [[Bobby Ray Inman]], the CIA's deputy director in 1981 and 1982, said LaRouche and his wife had visited him offering information about the West German Green Party, and a CIA spokesman said LaRouche met Deputy Director John McMahon in 1983 to discuss one of LaRouche's trips overseas. An aide to William Clark said when LaRouche's associates discussed technology or economics, they made good sense and seemed to be qualified. Norman Bailey, formerly with the National Security Council, said in 1984 that LaRouche's staff comprised &quot;one of the best private intelligence services in the world&quot;; he said, &quot;They do know a lot of people around the world. They do get to talk to prime ministers and presidents.&quot; Several government officials feared a security leak from the government's ties with the movement.&lt;ref&gt;For Bailey's comment in 1984, see [http://web.archive.org/web/20060119064440/http://www.heritage.org/Research/PoliticalPhilosophy/upload/91214_1.pdf Copulus, July 19, 1984].

According to critics, the supposed behind-the-scenes processes, were more often flights of fancy than inside information. Douglas Foster wrote in ''Mother Jones'' in 1982 that the briefings consisted of disinformation, &quot;hate-filled&quot; material about enemies, phony letters, intimidation, fake newspaper articles, and dirty tricks campaigns. Opponents were accused of being gay or Nazis, or were linked to murders, which the movement called &quot;psywar techniques.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;For Alexander, {{harvnb|Alexander|1991}}, p. 948.
*For the ''Mother Jones'' article, see [http://books.google.com/books?id=ouYDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 Foster, January 1982, p. 30].
*For psywar techniques, see {{harvnb|Johnson|1983}}, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

From the 1970s through to the 2000s (decade), LaRouche founded several groups and companies. In addition to the National Caucus of Labor Committees, there was the [[Citizens Electoral Council]] (Australia), the National Democratic Policy Committee, the [[Fusion Energy Foundation]], and the U.S. Labor Party. In 1984 he founded the [[Schiller Institute]] in Germany with his second wife, and three political parties there—the [[European Worker's Party|''Europäische Arbeiterpartei'']], ''Patrioten für Deutschland'', and ''[[Bürgerrechtsbewegung Solidarität]]''—and in 2000 the [[Worldwide LaRouche Youth Movement]]. His printing services included Computron Technologies, Computype, World Composition Services, and PMR Printing Company, Inc, or PMR Associates.&lt;ref name=Copulus&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060119064440/http://www.heritage.org/Research/PoliticalPhilosophy/upload/91214_1.pdf Copulus, July 19, 1984], pp. 2–3.
*Other groups included the International Caucus of Labor Committees, the Club of Life, the Committee for a Fair Election, the Humanist Academy, the International Workingman's Defense Fund, the Lafayette Academy for the Arts and Sciences, the LaRouche Campaign, the National Anti-Drug Coalition, the National Unemployed and Welfare Rights Organization, and the Revolutionary Youth Movement.

[[File:Fbidoc.jpg|thumb|left|150px|alt=image of letter|A 1973 internal FBI letter, noting the Communist Party's efforts to eliminate LaRouche, and suggesting submission of a &quot;blind memorandum&quot; to the Communist Party's newspaper.]]

LaRouche wrote in his 1987 autobiography that violent altercations had begun in 1969 between his NCLC members and several [[New Left]] groups when [[Mark Rudd]]'s faction began assaulting LaRouche's faction at Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|LaRouche|1987}}, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; Press accounts alleged that between April and September 1973, during what LaRouche called &quot;Operation Mop-Up,&quot; NCLC members began physically attacking members of leftist groups that LaRouche classified as &quot;left-protofascists&quot;; an editorial in LaRouche's ''New Solidarity'' said of the Communist Party that the movement &quot;must dispose of this stinking corpse.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;For the name &quot;Operation Mop-Up,&quot; see [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F50E17FB385F107A93C2AB178AD85F408785F9 Montgomery, January 20, 1974].

At least 60 assaults were reported. The operation ended when police arrested several of LaRouche's followers; there were no convictions, and LaRouche maintained they had acted in self-defense.

LaRouche's critics such as Dennis King and [[Antony Lerman]] allege that in 1973 and with little warning, LaRouche adopted more extreme ideas, a process accompanied by a campaign of violence against his opponents on the left, and the development of conspiracy theories and paranoia about his personal safety.&lt;ref name=Lerman212&gt;{{harvnb|Lerman|1988}}, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; According to these accounts, he began to believe he was under threat of assassination from the Soviet Union, the CIA, Libya, drug dealers, and bankers.&lt;ref name=MintzDec181987&gt;[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73863058.html?dids=73863058:73863058&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Dec+18%2C+1987&amp;author=John+Mintz&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=a.18&amp;desc=Defense+Calls+LaRouche%2C+Followers+%60Most+Annoying%27 Mintz, December 18, 1987].&lt;/ref&gt; He also established a &quot;Biological Holocaust Task Force,&quot; which, according to  LaRouche, analysed the public health consequences of [[International Monetary Fund]] austerity policies toward impoverished nations in Africa, and predicted that epidemics of cholera as well as possibly entirely new diseases would strike Africa in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toumey|1996|pp=87–92}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grauerholz, Dr. John, [http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1990/eirv17n33-19900817/eirv17n33-19900817_014-the_aids_epidemic_four_years_lat.pdf The AIDS Epidemic Four Years Later: LaRouche Was Right], ''EIR'' August 17, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace's American Independent Party tradition, is soliciting help from orthodox Republicans and even had an information table at a big GOP fund-raising dinner in the Biltmore here last month.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The USLP is described in LaRouche's résumé as &quot;an independent political association committed to the tradition of [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Alexander Hamilton]], [[Henry Charles Carey|Henry C. Carey]], and President [[Abraham Lincoln]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.larouchepub.com/resume.html |title=Lyndon LaRouche Biography |publisher=Larouchepub.com |accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaRouche describes it in another location as &quot;a new [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] association,&quot; adding that an important objective of the party was to fight against &quot;the attempted revival of the 'preventive nuclear war' organization, the revived [[Committee on the Present Danger]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date=July 9, 2004 |work=Executive Intelligence Review|title=Hans Koschnick Poses A Question Which the July Democrats Must Also Answer|first= Lyndon H. |last=LaRouche, Jr.|url=http://www.larouchepub.com/lar/2004/3127hans_koschnick.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A two-part article in ''The New York Times'' in 1979 by Howard Blum and Paul L. Montgomery alleged that LaRouche had turned it{{who|date=May 2012}}—at that point with 1,000 members in 37 offices in North America, and 26 in Europe and Latin America—into an extreme-right, anti-Semitic organization, despite the presence of Jewish members. LaRouche denied the newspaper's charges, and said he had filed a $100 million libel suit; his press secretary said the articles were intended to &quot;set up a credible climate for an assassination hit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/685425541.html?dids=685425541:685425541&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Feb+17%2C+1980&amp;author=Charles+Kenney+Globe+Staff&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=FRINGE+CANDIDATE+OR+A+THREAT%3F%3B+%3B+THE+LYNDON+LAROUCHE+CAMPAIGN&amp;pqatl=google Kenney, February 17, 1980].&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' alleged that members had taken courses in how to use knives and rifles; that a farm in upstate New York had been used for guerrilla training; and that several members had undergone a six-day anti-terrorist training course run by [[Mitchell WerBell III]], an arms dealer and former member of the [[Office of Strategic Services]], who said he had ties to the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. Journalists and publications the party regarded as unfriendly were harassed, and it published a list of potential assassins it saw as a threat. LaRouche expected members to devote themselves entirely to the party, and place their savings and possessions at its disposal, as well as take out loans on its behalf. Party officials would decide who each member should live with, and if someone left the movement, his remaining partner was expected to live separately from him. LaRouche would question spouses about their partner's sexual habits, the ''Times'' said, and in one case reportedly ordered a member to stop having sex with his wife because it was making him &quot;politically impotent.&quot;&lt;ref name=Blum1979&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F70816FA3F5C11728DDDAE0894D8415B898BF1D3&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=%22U.S.%20Labor%20Party:%20Cult%20Surrounded%20by%20Controversy&amp;st=cse Blum, October 7, 1979].

===1973: &quot;Ego-stripping&quot; and &quot;brainwashing&quot; allegations===&lt;!--this subhead is linked to--&gt;
LaRouche began writing in 1973 about the use of certain psychological techniques on recruits.  In an article called &quot;Beyond Psychoanalysis&quot;, he wrote that a worker's persona had to be stripped away to arrive at a state he called &quot;little me,&quot; from which it would be possible to &quot;rebuild their personalities around a new socialist identity,&quot; according to ''The Washington Post''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46883-2004Oct20_3.html Witt, October 24, 2004, p. 3].
*Marcus, L. (Lyndon LaRouche). [http://wlym.com/PDF-68-76/CAM74BP.pdf &quot;Beyond Psychoanalysis&quot;], ''The Campaigner'', Vol 6, Nos. 3–4; September/October 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' wrote that the first such session—which LaRouche called &quot;ego-stripping&quot;—involved a German member, Konstantin George, in the summer of 1973; LaRouche said that during the session he discovered that a plot to assassinate him had been implanted in George's mind.&lt;ref name=MontgomeryWitt/&gt;

He recorded sessions with a 26-year-old British member, Chris White, who had moved to England with LaRouche's former partner, Carol Schnitzer. In December 1973 LaRouche asked the couple to return to the U.S.; his followers sent tapes of the subsequent sessions with White to ''The New York Times'' as evidence of an assassination plot. According to the ''Times'', &quot;[t]here are sounds of weeping, and vomiting on the tapes, and Mr. White complains of being deprived of sleep, food and cigarettes. At one point someone says 'raise the voltage,' but (LaRouche) says this was associated with the bright lights used in the questioning rather than an electric shock.&quot; The ''Times'' wrote, &quot;Mr. White complains of a terrible pain in his arm,&quot; then LaRouche can be heard saying, 'That's not real. That's in the program'.&quot; LaRouche told the newspaper White had been &quot;reduced to an eight-cycle infinite loop with look-up table, with homosexual bestiality&quot;; he said White had not been harmed and that a physician—a LaRouche movement member—had been present throughout.&lt;ref name=MontgomeryWitt&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F50E17FB385F107A93C2AB178AD85F408785F9 Montgomery, January 20, 1974], p. 51, column 5.

Gregory Rose, a former chief of counter-intelligence for LaRouche who became an FBI informant in 1973, said that while the LaRouche movement had extensive links to the Liberty Lobby, there was also copious evidence of a connection to the [[Soviet Union]]. George and Wilcox say neither connection amounted to much – they assert that LaRouche was &quot;definitely not a Soviet agent&quot; and state that while the contact with the Liberty Lobby is often used to imply {{&quot;'}}links' and 'ties' between LaRouche and the extreme right&quot;, it was in fact transient and marked by mutual suspicion. The Liberty Lobby soon pronounced itself disillusioned with LaRouche, citing his movement's adherence to &quot;basic socialist positions&quot; and his softness on &quot;the major Zionist groups&quot; as fundamental points of difference. According to George and Wilcox, American neo-Nazi leaders expressed misgivings over the number of Jews and members of other minority groups in his organization, and did not consider LaRouche an ally.&lt;ref&gt;For Gregory Rose's position, see Johnson 1983, p. 204.
*{{harvnb|George|Wilcox|1992|pp=317–318, 322}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson, in ''Architects of Fear'', similarly states that LaRouche's overtures to far right groups were pragmatic rather than sincere; a 1975 party memo spoke of uniting with these groups only to overthrow the established order, adding that once that goal had been accomplished, &quot;eliminating our right-wing opposition will be comparatively easy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson 1983, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;

Howard Blum wrote in ''The New York Times'' that, from 1976 onwards, party members sent reports to the FBI and local police on members of left-wing organizations. In 1977, he wrote, commercial reports on U.S. anti-apartheid groups were prepared by LaRouche members for the South African government; student dissidents were reported to the Shah of Iran's [[Savak]] secret police; and the anti-nuclear movement was investigated on behalf of power companies. Johnson says the intelligence network was made up of &quot;obnoxious devotees commandeering [[WATS line]]s and tricking bureaucrats into giving them information&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1970s, members were exchanging almost daily information with [[Roy Frankhouser]], a government informant and infiltrator of both far right and far left groups who was involved with the [[Ku Klux Klan]] and the [[American Nazi Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|George|Wilcox|1992|pp=319–320}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70816FA3F5C11728DDDAE0894D8415B898BF1D3 Blum, October 7, 1979], {{harvnb|Shenon|1986}}, and {{harvnb|Sims|1996}}, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt;
The LaRouche organization believed Frankhouser to be a federal agent who had been assigned to infiltrate right-wing and left-wing groups, and that he had evidence that these groups were actually being manipulated or controlled by the FBI and other agencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larouchepub.com/eiw/public/1975/eirv02n32-19750723/eirv02n32-19750723_009-leaa_gestapo_operations_in_readi.pdf EIR, July 17, 1975]&lt;/ref&gt;

Blum wrote that, at around this time, LaRouche's Computron Technologies Corporation included Mobil Oil and Citibank among its clients; that his World Composition Services had one of the most advanced typesetting complexes in the city and had the Ford Foundation among its clients; and that his PMR Associates produced the party's publications and some high school newspapers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blum, October 7, 1979&quot;&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70816FA3F5C11728DDDAE0894D8415B898BF1D3 Blum, October 7, 1979].&lt;/ref&gt;

Around the same time, according to Blum, LaRouche was telling his membership several times a year that he was being targeted for assassination, including by the Queen of the United Kingdom, Zionist mobsters, the Council on Foreign Relations, the Justice Department, and the Mossad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blum, October 7, 1979&quot;/&gt; LaRouche sued the City of New York in 1974, saying that CIA and British spies had brainwashed his associates into killing him.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;LaRouche Filings: Plots, Spies; Judges Tomorrow to Sift Myriad Motions Filed by Corps of Lawyers&quot;, John Mintz, ''Washington Post'', May 17, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; He has repeatedly asserted that he is a target for assassination. According to the ''Patriot-News'' of Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, LaRouche said he had been &quot;threatened by Communists, Zionists, narcotics gangsters, the Rockefellers and international terrorists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Federal Probe Pins Top Aides of LaRouche&quot;, Philip Shenon, ''Patriot{{spaced ndash}}News'', October 7, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; LaRouche later said that,

In 1975, under the name ''Lyn Marcus'', LaRouche published ''[[Views of Lyndon LaRouche#Dialectical Economics: An Introduction to Marxist Political Economy|Dialectical Economics: An Introduction to Marxist Political Economy]]'', called his &quot;magnum opus&quot; by one observer and described by its only reviewer as &quot;the most peculiar and idiosyncratic&quot; introduction to economics he had ever seen. Mixing economics, history, anthropology, sociology and a surprisingly large helping of [[business administration]], the work argued that most prominent Marxists had misunderstood Marx, and that [[bourgeois]] economics arose when philosophy took a wrong, [[reductionism|reductionist]]  turn under [[British_Empiricism#British_empiricism|British empiricists]] like [[John Locke|Locke]] and [[David Hume|Hume]].&lt;ref name=HigherEd&gt;McLemee, Scott.

In 1976, LaRouche campaigned for the first time in a presidential election as a U.S. Labor Party candidate, polling 40,043 votes (0.05 percent). It was the first of eight presidential elections he took part in between 1976 and 2004, which enabled him to attract $5.9 million in federal [[matching funds]]; candidates seeking their party's presidential nomination qualify for matching funds if they raise $5,000 in each of at least 20 states.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46883-2004Oct20_3.html Witt, October 24, 2004, p. 3].

His campaign included a paid half-hour television address, which allowed him to air his views before a national audience, something that became a regular feature of his later campaigns. There were protests about this, and about the involvement of the NCLC in public life generally. Writing in ''The Washington Post'', [[Stephen Rosenfeld]] said LaRouche's ideas belonged to the radical right, neo-Nazi fringe, and that his main interests lay in disruption and disinformation; Rosenfeld called the NCLC one of the &quot;chief polluters&quot; of political democracy. Rosenfeld argued that the press should be &quot;chary&quot; of offering them print or air time: &quot;A duplicitous violence-prone group with fascistic proclivities should not be presented to the public, unless there is reason to present it in those terms.&quot; LaRouche wrote in 1999 that this comment had &quot;openly declared... a policy of malicious lying&quot; against him.&lt;ref&gt;For Rosenfeld in ''The Washington Post'', see [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/120029198.html?dids=120029198:120029198&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=Sep+24%2C+1976&amp;author=Stephen+S.+Rosenfeld&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post++%281974-Current+file%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A15&amp;desc=NCLC%3A+%27A+Domestic+Political+Menace%27 Rosenfeld, September 24, 1976].

===1977: Second marriage===
LaRouche married again in 1977. His new wife, [[Helga Zepp-LaRouche|Helga Zepp]], was a leading activist in the German branch of the movement. She went on to work closely with LaRouche for the rest of his career, standing for election in Germany in 1980 for his ''Europäische Arbeiterpartei'' (European Workers Party), and founding the [[Schiller Institute]] in Germany in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;For the election, see [http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14331971.html &quot;Dunkle Kräfte&quot;], ''Der Spiegel'', September 22, 1980; [http://wissen.spiegel.de/wissen/image/show.html?did=14331971&amp;aref=image036/2006/06/16/cq-sp198003901310133.pdf&amp;thumb=false pdf here]; [http://translate.googleusercontent.com/translate_c?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;sl=de&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-14331971.html&amp;prev=_t&amp;rurl=translate.google.com&amp;twu=1&amp;usg=ALkJrhgRk3XatovJKMCgsTRH0xTYM67j5g Google translation].

===National Democratic Policy Committee, &quot;October Surprise&quot; theory===
From the autumn of 1979, the LaRouche movement conducted most of its U.S. electoral activities as the National Democratic Policy Committee (NDPC), a political action committee.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Lynn.

In December 1980, LaRouche and his followers started what came to be known as the &quot;[[October surprise conspiracy theory|October Surprise]]&quot; allegation{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}, namely that in October 1980 Ronald Reagan's campaign staff conspired with the Iranian government during the [[Iran hostage crisis]] to delay the release of 52 American hostages held in Iran, with the aim of helping Reagan win the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]] against [[Jimmy Carter]]. The Iranians had agreed to this, according to the theory, in exchange for future weapons sales from the Reagan administration. The first publication of the story was in LaRouche's ''Executive Intelligence Review'' on December 2, 1980, followed by his ''New Solidarity'' on September 2, 1983, alleging that [[Henry Kissinger]], one of LaRouche's regular targets, had met Iran's Ayatollah Beheshti in Paris, according to Iranian sources in Paris. Although ultimately discredited, the story was widely discussed in conspiracy circles during the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;For the first publication in EIR, see [http://www.newsweek.com/1991/11/10/making-of-a-myth.html Barry, November 11, 1991].

===Meetings with world leaders, involvement in Latin America, ''Operation Juárez''===
In 1982, LaRouche had private meetings with Indian Prime Minister [[Indira Gandhi]], maintaining frequent contact until her assassination in October 1984. His movement engaged in intensive outreach work in Latin America, producing research papers and gaining access to top government officials, including Peruvian President [[Alan García]]. LaRouche met with Mexican president [[José López Portillo]]. George Johnson writes that LaRouche warned Portillo about attempts by international bankers to wreck the Mexican economy, meeting him under the auspices of LaRouche's National Democratic Policy Committee. LaRouche advised him to suspend payment of the debt, implement [[exchange controls]] and nationalize the banks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iluminados y malditos&quot;&gt;Rodriguez, Martin, [http://www.noticiasurbanas.com.ar/info_item.shtml?sh_itm=706a7882f928529d851429ee8ccfb3fa Iluminados y malditos], ''Noticias Urbanas'', December 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Both the American Embassy and the Democratic Party issued disclaimers; a Mexican official told ''The New York Times'' that LaRouche had arranged the meeting by representing himself as a Democratic Party official.&lt;ref&gt;For Johnson, LaRouche's warning to Portillo, the National Democratic Policy Committee, and the disclaimers, see Johnson, George.

King wrote that [[Fidel Castro]] developed &quot;his own version of Operation Juárez.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;For the meetings, see Mintz, John.

&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 LaRouche visited Argentina, at which time he met with Argentine's president [[Raúl Alfonsin]] as well as several Peronist members of congress.  LaRouche had supported Argentina during the 1982 [[Falklands War]], denouncing the Reagan administration for violating the [[Monroe Doctrine]] by its support of Great Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iluminados y malditos&quot;/&gt;

Mexican journalist Sergio Sarmiento wrote in the ''Wall Street Journal'' in 1989 that LaRouche's Labor Party in Mexico produced a pamphlet entitled &quot;a vote for the National Action Party (PAN) is a vote for Nazism.&quot; When leaders of the Mexico Oil Workers' Union were jailed, LaRouche said the union had been attacked by the Anglo-American Liberal Establishment. According to Jose I. Blandon, an adviser to former Panamanian President [[Manuel Noriega]], LaRouche had ties to Noriega, and according to Sarmiento, LaRouche members supported Peruvian President [[Alan García]].&lt;ref&gt;Sarmiento, Sergio. &quot;Lyndon LaRouche's Latin American Connection,&quot; ''The Wall Street Journal'', September 1, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

LaRouche also met Turkish Prime Minister [[Turgut Özal]] in 1987; according to the ''San Francisco Chronicle'', Özal reprimanded his aides who had mistaken LaRouche for the Democratic Presidential candidate.&lt;ref&gt;For Özal reprimanding his aides, see [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/24650201.html?dids=24650201:24650201&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+31,+1987&amp;author=United+Press+International&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=TURKISH+CHIEF+MEETS+LYNDON+LAROUCHE+BY+MISTAKE&amp;pqatl=google &quot;Turkish Chief Meets LaRouche By Mistake&quot;], ''Chicago Tribune'', July 31, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1983: Move from New York to Loudoun County===
''The Washington Post'' wrote that LaRouche and his wife moved in August 1983 from New York to a 13-room Georgian mansion on a 250-acre section of the [[Woodburn, Loudoun County, Virginia|Woodburn Estate]], near Leesburg, Loudoun County, Virginia. The property was owned at the time by a company registered in Switzerland. Companies associated with LaRouche continued to buy property in the area, including part of Leesburg's industrial park, purchased by LaRouche's Lafayette/Leesburg Ltd. Partnership to develop a printing plant and office complex.&lt;ref name=MintzJan131985/&gt;

Neighbors said they saw LaRouche guards in camouflage clothes carrying semi-automatic weapons, and the ''Post'' wrote that the house had  sandbag-buttressed guard posts nearby, along with metal spikes in the driveway and concrete barriers on the road. One of his aides said LaRouche was safer in Loudoun County: &quot;The terrorist organizations which have targeted Mr. LaRouche do not have bases of operations in Virginia.&quot; LaRouche said his new home meant a shorter commute to Washington. A former associate said the move also meant his members would be more isolated from friends and family than they had been in New York.&lt;ref name=MintzJan131985&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/cult/larouche/larou3.htm Mintz, January 13, 1985].&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''Post'' in 2004, local people who opposed him for any reason were accused in LaRouche publications of being commies, homosexual, drug pushers, and terrorists. He reportedly accused the Leesburg Garden Club of being a nest of Soviet sympathizers, and a local lawyer who opposed LaRouche on a zoning matter went into hiding after threatening phone calls and a death threat.&lt;ref name=Witt2004p3/&gt; In leaflets supporting his application of concealed weapons permits for his bodyguards in [[Leesburg, Virginia]], he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I have a major personal security problem...[Without the permits] the assassination teams of professional mercenaries now being trained in Canada and along the Mexico border may be expected to start arriving on the streets of Leesburg...If they come, there will be many people dead or mutilated within as short an interval as 60 seconds of fire.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Man who calls Queen a pusher worries town&quot;, Matthew Wald.

In 1984, media reports stated that LaRouche and his aides had met Reagan administration officials, including Norman Bailey, senior director of international economic affairs for the National Security Council (NSC), and Richard Morris, special assistant to [[William P.

[[File:Wheat Building-Leesburg VA.jpg|thumb|180px|alt=photograph|The Wheat Building in [[Leesburg, Virginia]], which housed the [[Fusion Energy Foundation]] in the 1980s.]]
The LaRouche campaign supported Reagan's [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI). Dennis King wrote that LaRouche had been speculating about space-based weaponry as early as 1975. He set up the Fusion Energy Foundation, which held conferences and tried to cultivate scientists, with some success. In 1979, FEF representatives attended a Moscow conference on [[Inertial confinement fusion|laser fusion]]. LaRouche began to promote the use of lasers and related technologies for both military and civilian purposes, calling for a &quot;revolution in [[machine tool]]s.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Last Rosicrucian,&quot;&gt;Benedictine, Kirll, and Diunov, Michael, [http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;u=http://www.terra-america.ru/poslednii-rozenkreicer-part1.aspx&amp;ei=a8OMT4DPEsSoiQKm5KS1CA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDsQ7gEwAw&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3Dsite:terra-america.ru%2B%25D0%259B%25D0%25B0%25D1%2580%25D1%2583%25D1%2588%26hl%3Den%26biw%3D1280%26bih%3D569%26prmd%3Dimvns &quot;The Last Rosicrucian,&quot;] Terra-America, April 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

According to King, LaRouche's associates had for some years been in contact with members of the Reagan administration about LaRouche's space-based weapons ideas.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|King|1989|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaRouche proposed the development of defensive beam technologies as a policy that was in the interest of both the US and the USSR, as the alternative to an arms race in offensive weapons, and as a generator of spin-off economic benefits. Between February 1982 and February 1983, with the approval of the National Security Council, LaRouche met with Soviet embassy representative Evgeny Shershnev to discuss the proposal. During this period, Soviet economists also began to study LaRouche's economic forecasting model. However, following Reagan's public announcement of the SDI in March 1983, Soviet representatives broke off all contact with LaRouche and his representatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Last Rosicrucian,&quot;/&gt;

Physicist [[Edward Teller]], a proponent of SDI and X-ray lasers, told reporters in 1984 that he had been courted by LaRouche, but had kept his distance. LaRouche began calling his plan the &quot;LaRouche-Teller proposal,&quot; though they had never met. Teller said LaRouche was &quot;a poorly informed man with fantastic conceptions.&quot;&lt;ref name=Siano1992&gt;{{harvnb|Siano|1992}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

LaRouche later attributed the [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|collapse of the Soviet Union]] to its refusal to follow his advice to accept Reagan's offer to share the technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20031011204719/larouchein2004.net/pages/questions/youth/030201penn004.htm LaRouche, February 1, 2003].
*LaRouche's promotion of space colonization included dealings with German scientists and engineers who had worked under the Nazi government during the Second World War, some of whom had emigrated to the U.S. and had ended up working for NASA. They included [[Arthur Rudolph]] and several other Peenemunde rocket experts, such as [[Krafft Arnold Ehricke]], [[Adolf Busemann]], [[Konrad Dannenberg]], and [[Hermann Oberth]]. When Rudolph was forced to renounce his U.S. citizenship after an investigation into his past, LaRouche supporters formed a defense fund for him. LaRouche also collaborated with Ehricke on ideas about the colonization of the moon and Mars; after Ehricke's death, LaRouche sponsored the &quot;Krafft Ehricke Memorial Conference,&quot; and in 1988 delivered a national TV broadcast titled &quot;The Woman on Mars.&quot; See {{harvnb|Siano|1992}}, {{harvnb|LaRouche Political Action Committee|1988}}, and {{harvnb|King|1989}}, pp. 80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Former Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] reported in his 2011 memoir that at a 2001 dinner in Russia with leading officials, he was told by General [[Yuri Baluyevsky]], then the second highest-ranking officer in the Russian military, that LaRouche was the brains behind SDI. Rumsfeld stated that he believed LaRouche had had no influence whatsoever on the program, and surmised that Baluyevsky must have obtained the information off the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Rumsfeld, Donald, ''Known and Unknown'', Sentinel, 2011, ISBN 978-1-59523-067-6, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the former head of the Russian bureau of Interpol, General Vladimir Ovchinsky, also described LaRouche as the man who proposed the SDI.&lt;ref&gt;[http://smol.kp.ru/daily/25839/2812048/ &quot;Will the Third World flare up in 2012?&quot;]‎ Komsomolskaya Pravda – Feb 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

===1984: NBC lawsuit===
In January 1984 NBC aired a news segment about LaRouche, and in March a &quot;First Camera&quot; report produced by Pat Lynch. In an article for the ''Columbia Journalism Review'' in 1985, Lynch wrote that the reports included the allegation that LaRouche was &quot;the leader of a violence-prone, anti-Semitic cult that smeared its opponents and sued its critics.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lynch1985&gt;{{harvnb|Lynch|1985}}, p. 42.
*For information about Pat Lynch, see [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pat-lynch &quot;Pat Lynch&quot;], ''The Huffington Post'', Retrieved February 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews, former members of the movement gave details about their fundraising practices, and alleged that LaRouche had spoken about assassinating U.S. President [[Jimmy Carter]]. The reports said an investigation by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) would lead to an indictment, and quoted [[Irwin Suall]], the Anti-Defamation League's (ADL) fact-finding director, who called LaRouche a &quot;small-time Hitler.&quot; After the broadcast, LaRouche members picketed NBC's office carrying signs saying &quot;Lynch Pat Lynch,&quot; and the NBC switchboard said it received a death threat against her. Another NBC researcher said someone placed fliers around her parents' neighborhood saying she was running a call-girl ring from her parents' home.&lt;ref&gt;Mintz, John.

===1985–1986: PANIC, LaRouche's AIDS initiative===
{{POV-section|date=September 2012}}
{{main|California Proposition 64 (1986)}}
LaRouche interpreted the AIDS pandemic as fulfillment of his 1973 prediction that an epidemic would strike humanity in the 1980s. LaRouche said it had been created by the &quot;Soviet war machine,&quot; or by the International Monetary Fund to kill &quot;excess eaters&quot; in Africa. According to Christopher Toumey, his subsequent campaign followed a familiar LaRouche pattern: challenging the scientific competence of government experts, and arguing that LaRouche had special scientific insights, and his own scientific associates were more competent than government scientists. LaRouche's view of AIDS agreed with orthodox medicine in that HIV caused AIDS, but differed from it in arguing that HIV spread like the cold virus or malaria, by way of casual contact and insect bites—which if true, would make HIV-positive people extremely dangerous. He advocated testing anyone working in schools, restaurants, or healthcare, and quarantining those who tested positive. Some of LaRouche's views on AIDS were developed by John Seale, a British [[venereologist|venereological physician]] who proposed that AIDS was created in a laboratory. Seale's highly speculative writings were published in three prestigious medical journals, lending these ideas some appearance of being hard science.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toumey|1996|pp=87–92}}.
*For &quot;Soviet war machine&quot; and &quot;excess eaters&quot; see Kirp, David L. [http://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/11/opinion/larouche-turns-to-aids-politics.html &quot;LaRouche Turns To AIDS Politics&quot;], ''The New York Times'', September 11, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

LaRouche and his associates devised a &quot;Biological Strategic Defense Initiative&quot; that would cost $100 billion per annum, which they said would have to be directed by LaRouche. Toumey writes that those opposing the program, such as the [[World Health Organization]] and [[Centers for Disease Control]], were accused of &quot;viciously lying to the world,&quot; and of following an agenda of genocide and euthanasia.&lt;ref name=Toumey87&gt;{{harvnb|Toumey|1996|pp=87–88}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 LaRouche proposed that AIDS be added to California's List of Communicable Diseases. Sponsored by his &quot;Prevent AIDS Now Initiative Committee&quot; (PANIC), Proposition 64—or the &quot;LaRouche initiative&quot;—qualified for the California ballot in 1986, with the required signature gatherers mostly paid for by LaRouche's Campaigner Publications. Seale, presented as an AIDS expert by PANIC, supported the LaRouche initiative but disagreed with several of LaRouche's views, including that HIV could be spread by insects, and described the group's political beliefs and conspiracy theories as &quot;rather odd&quot;. According to David Kirp, professor of public policy at the University of California at Berkeley, the proposal would have required that 300,000 people in the area with HIV or AIDS be reported to public health authorities; might have removed over 100,000 of them from their jobs in schools, restaurants and agriculture; and would have forced 47,000 children to stay away from school.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/11/opinion/larouche-turns-to-aids-politics.html Kirp, September 11, 1986] above.
*For Seale's partial support, see Petit, Charles. &quot;Doctor Supports Prop. 64—Sort Of&quot;, ''San Francisco Chronicle'', September 30, 1986, pg. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The proposal was opposed by leading scientists and local health officials as based on inaccurate scientific information and, as the public health schools put it, running &quot;counter to all public health principles.&quot; It was defeated, reintroduced two years later, and defeated again, with two million votes in favor the first time, and 1.7 million the second. AIDS became a leading plank in LaRouche's platform during his 1988 presidential campaign. He vowed to quarantine its &quot;aberrant&quot; victims who were &quot;guilty of bringing this pandemic upon us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Roderick|1986}}.

He refused to answer a question from an NBC reporter, saying &quot;How can I talk with a drug pusher like you?&quot; He called the leadership of the United States &quot;idiotic&quot; and &quot;berserk,&quot; and its foreign policy &quot;criminal or insane.&quot; He warned of the imminent collapse of the banking system and accused banks of laundering drug money.

In October 1986, hundreds of state and federal officers raided LaRouche offices in Virginia and Massachusetts. A federal grand jury indicted LaRouche and 12 associates on credit card fraud and obstruction of justice; the charges alleged that they had attempted to defraud people of millions of dollars, including several elderly people, by borrowing money they did not intend to repay.

In his 1988 autobiography, LaRouche says the raid on his operation was the work of [[Raisa Gorbachev]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Power of Reason: 1988'', an autobiography by Lyndon H. LaRouche, Jr., 1987, Executive Intelligence Review, Designed by World Composition Services, ISBN 0-943235-00-6, p. 309&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview the same year, he said that the Soviet Union opposed him because he invented the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]]. &quot;The Soviet government hated me for it. Gorbachev also hated my guts and called for my assassination and imprisonment and so forth.&quot; LaRouche asserted that he has survived these threats because of protection by unnamed U.S. government officials. &quot;Even when they don't like me, they consider me a national asset, and they don't like to have their national assets killed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Outsider making his 8th White House bid / LaRouche says he'd fix economy&quot;, Rachel Gravges, ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'', March 6, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

===1989: Musical interests and Verdi tuning initiative===
LaRouche and his wife have an interest in classical music up to the period of Brahms. A motto of LaRouche's European Workers' Party, is &quot;Think like Beethoven&quot;; movement offices typically include a piano and posters of German composers, and members are known for their choral singing at protest events and for using satirical lyrics tailored to their targets.&lt;ref&gt;For LaRouche's interests, see LaRouche, Lyndon. &quot;Correspondence: Classical Composition,&quot; ''The New Republic'', December 26, 1988.

In 1989 LaRouche advocated that classical orchestras should return to the &quot;Verdi pitch,&quot; a pitch that [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]] had enshrined in Italian legislation in 1884. The initiative attracted support from more than 300 opera stars, including [[Joan Sutherland]], [[Placido Domingo]] and [[Luciano Pavarotti]], who according to ''Opera Fanatic'' may or may not have been aware of LaRouche's politics. A spokesman for Domingo said Domingo had simply signed a questionnaire, had not been aware of its origins, and would not agree with LaRouche's politics. [[Renata Tebaldi]] and [[Piero Cappuccilli]], who were running for the European Parliament on LaRouche's &quot;Patriots for Italy&quot; platform, attended Schiller Institute conferences as featured speakers, and the discussions led to debates in the Italian parliament about reinstating Verdi's legislation. LaRouche gave an interview to [[National Public Radio]] on the initiative from prison. The initiative was opposed by the editor of ''Opera Fanatic'', [[Stefan Zucker]], who objected to the establishment of a &quot;pitch police,&quot; and argued that LaRouche was using the issue to gain credibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/timesdispatch/access/615637631.html?dids=615637631:615637631&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Sep+16%2C+1989&amp;author=Francis+Church&amp;pub=Richmond+Times+-+Dispatch&amp;desc=SHALL+LYNDON+LAROUCHE+CALL+THE+TUNING+PITCH%3F&amp;pqatl=google &quot;Shall Lyndon LaRouche call the tuning pitch?&quot;], ''Richmond Times Dispatch'', September 16, 1989.

*Orchestras' pitches have risen since the 18th century, because a higher pitch produces a more brilliant orchestral sound, while imposing an additional strain on singers' voices. [[Giuseppe Verdi]] succeeded in 1884 in having legislation passed in Italy that fixed the reference pitch for [[A (musical note)|A]] at 432 Hz, but in 1938, the international standard was raised to 440 Hz, with some major orchestras tuning as high as 450 Hz in recent times.

===Imprisonment, release on parole, attempts at exoneration, visits to Russia===
LaRouche began his jail sentence in 1989, serving it at the [[Federal Medical Center, Rochester|Federal Medical Center]] in Rochester, Minnesota. From there he ran for Congress in 1990, seeking to represent the [[Virginia's 10th congressional district|10th District of Virginia]], but he received less than one percent of the vote. He ran for President again in 1992 with [[James Bevel]] as his running mate, a civil rights activist who had represented the LaRouche movement in its pursuit of the [[Franklin child prostitution ring allegations]].

Bakker later wrote of his astonishment at LaRouche's detailed knowledge of the Bible. According to Bakker, LaRouche received a daily intelligence report by mail, and at times had information about news events days before they happened. Bakker also wrote that LaRouche believed their cell was bugged. In Bakker's view, &quot;to say LaRouche was a little paranoid would be like saying that the ''Titanic'' had a little leak.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Witt|2004}}, p. 2.

Beginning in 1994, LaRouche made numerous visits to Russia, participating in conferences of the Vernadsky State Geological Museum of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (RAS), the RAS Institute of the Far East, and other places. He addressed seminars at the RAS Institute of Economics, the RAS Institute of Oriental Studies. He spoke at hearings in the [[State Duma]] of the Russian Federation On measures to ensure the development of the Russian economy at the point of destabilization of the world financial system. Two of his books were translated into Russian.&lt;ref name=&quot;zavtra.ru&quot;&gt;[http://www.zavtra.ru/content/view/slovo-o-larushe/ A Word About LaRouche - On the 90th birthday of the famous American non-conformist], editorial in ''Zavtra'' (&quot;Tomorrow,&quot;) September 5, 2012 -translation into English available [http://larouchepac.com/node/23825 here], accessed Sept. 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Entitled &quot;Officials Call for LaRouche's Exoneration&quot;, its signatories included [[Arturo Frondizi]], former [[President of Argentina]]; figures from the 1960s [[American Civil Rights Movement]] such as [[Amelia Boynton Robinson]] (a leader of the Larouche-affiliated [[Schiller Institute]]), [[James Bevel]] (a Larouche movement participant) and [[Rosa Parks]]; former [[Minnesota]] [[United States Senate|Senator]] and Democratic Presidential Candidate [[Eugene McCarthy]]; [[Mervyn M.

Amelia Boynton Robinson was at that time a board member of the Institute. James Bevel and William Warfield had been active in various LaRouche organizations.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, LaRouche was invited to speak at a convention organized by the Nation of Islam's [[Louis Farrakhan]] and [[Benjamin Chavis|Ben Chavis]], then of the National African American Leadership Summit. As soon as he began speaking, he was booed off the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quinton|1996}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1996|1996 Democratic presidential primaries]], he received enough votes in Louisiana and Virginia to get one delegate from each state, but before the primaries began, the Democratic National Committee chair, [[Donald Fowler]], ruled that LaRouche was not a &quot;bona fide Democrat&quot; because of his &quot;expressed political beliefs ... which are explicitly racist and anti-Semitic,&quot; and because of his &quot;past activities including exploitation of and defrauding contributors and voters.&quot; Fowler instructed state parties to disregard votes for LaRouche.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bligh|2008}}.
*LaRouche sued in federal court, claiming a violation of the [[Voting Rights Act]]. After losing in the district court, the case was appealed to the First District Court of Appeals, which upheld the lower court's decision. See [http://cases.justia.com/us-court-of-appeals/F3/152/974/543769/LaRouche v. Fowler], August 28, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Efforts to clear LaRouche's name continued, including in Australia, where the Parliament acknowledged receipt of 1,606 petition signatures in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;db=CHAMBER;id=chamber%2Fhansardr%2F1998-06-29%2F0111;query=Id%3A%22chamber%2Fhansardr%2F1998-06-29%2F0000%22 Records of Australian Parliament], June 29, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 China's press agency, the [[Xinhua News Agency]], reported that LaRouche had criticized the [[Cox Report]], a congressional investigation that accused the Chinese of stealing U.S. nuclear weapons secrets, calling it a &quot;scientifically illiterate hoax.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-18124051.html &quot;U.S. Scholars Refute Cox Report&quot;], Xinhua News Agency, June 4, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 13, 1999, during a press conference to announce his plans to run for president, he predicted the collapse of the world's financial system, stating, &quot;There's nothing like it in this century.... it is systematic, and therefore, inevitable.&quot; He said the U.S. and other nations had built the &quot;biggest financial bubble in all history,&quot; which was close to bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;LaRouche Vows to Change U.S. Politics if Elected President,&quot; Xinhua News Agency'', October 25, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===2000–2003: Worldwide LaRouche Youth Movement, September 11 Attacks, Presidential run===

[[File:LaRouche supporters.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|LaRouche supporters in Chicago, 2007]]
LaRouche founded the Worldwide LaRouche Youth Movement (WLYM) in 2000, saying in 2004 that it had hundreds of members in the U.S. and a lesser number overseas. During the Democratic primaries in June 2000, he received 53,280 votes, or 22 percent of the total, in Arkansas.&lt;ref&gt;For the founding of WYLM and the membership figures, see {{harvnb|Witt|2004}}, p. 2, and {{harvnb|Silva|2006}}.
*For the Democratic primaries figures, see [http://www.economist.com/node/80934 &quot;Is Lyndon a Democrat?&quot;], ''The Economist'', June 22, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002 LaRouche's ''Executive Intelligence Review'' argued that the [[September 11 attacks|September 11, 2001 attacks]] had been an [[9/11 conspiracy theories|&quot;inside job&quot;]] and &quot;attempted coup d'etat,&quot; and that Iran was the first country to question it. The article received wide coverage in Iran, and was cited by senior Iranian government officials, including [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] and [[Hassan Rowhani]]. Mahmoud Alinejad writes that, in a subsequent telephone interview with the ''Voice of the Islamic Republic of Iran'', LaRouche said the attacks had been organized by rogue elements inside the U.S., aiming to use the incident to promote a war against Islam, and that Israel was a dictatorial regime prepared to commit Nazi-style crimes against the Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Alinejad|2004|pp=105–106}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

LaRouche again entered the primary elections for the Democratic Party's nomination in 2004, setting a record for the number of consecutive presidential campaigns; Democratic Party officials distanced themselves from him and did not allow him to participate in candidate forum debates. He did not run in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/05/02/politics/main552063.shtml Roberts, May 2, 2003].
*That he did not run in 2008, see [http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2007/0711.klein.html Klein, November 2007].&lt;/ref&gt;

As during the preceding decade, LaRouche and his followers denied that human civilization had harmed the environment through DDT, chluorofluorocarbons, or carbon dioxide. According to Chip Berlet, &quot;Pro-LaRouche publications have been at the forefront of denying the reality of global warming&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lyndon LaRouche: Man of Vision or Venom?: What's the Real Story?|first=Chip |last=Berlet|publisher=Political Research Associates|date=September 13, 2007|url= http://www.publiceye.org/larouche/truestory.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003–2012: Overseas press coverage, financial crisis===

Iqbal Qazwini wrote in the Arabic-language daily ''[[Asharq Al-Awsat]]'' in 2003 that LaRouche was one of the first to predict the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1988 and [[German unification]]. He said LaRouche had urged the West to pursue a policy of economic cooperation similar to the [[Marshall Plan]] for the advancement of the economy of the socialist countries. According to Qazwini, recent years have seen a proliferation of LaRouche's ideas in China and South Asia. Qazwini referred to him as the spiritual father of the revival of the new Silk Road or [[Eurasian Landbridge]], which aims to link the continents through a network of ground transportation.&lt;ref&gt;Qazwini, Iqbal.

In April 2005, Tang Yong of the ''[[People's Daily]]'' of China covered LaRouche's record of economic forecasting, and his warning that the present financial and currency system was already unsalvageable, thus it must be radically restructured, not just merely reformed.&lt;ref&gt;Tang Yong, ''People's Daily'', [http://world.people.com.cn/GB/41217/3317833.html U.S. Treasury and American experts: to force the appreciation of the renminbi is a mistake], April 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
Later that year, the paper published an eight-part interview with LaRouche, covering his economic forecasts, his battles with the American media, and his assessment of the [[neoconservatives]]. The interviewer wrote that LaRouche was &quot;quite famous in mainland China today,&quot; and seemed to be better known overseas than in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tang|2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, LaRouche began a national lobbying campaign to restore the [[Glass-Steagall Act]], saying that it would be possible to save the U.S. banking system by reorganizing it under bankruptcy protection.&lt;ref&gt;*Lindo, Bill, [http://www.amandala.com.bz/index.php?id=8402 Behind the scenes in the Obama administration], ''Amandala Online'', March 31, 2009

This called for the establishment of a federal agency that would &quot;place federal- and state-chartered banks under protection, freeze all existing home mortgages for a period of time, adjust mortgage values to fair prices, restructure existing mortgages at appropriate interest rates, and write off speculative debt obligations of mortgage-backed securities&quot;. The bill envisioned a foreclosure moratorium, allowing homeowners to make the equivalent of rental payments for an interim period, and an end to bank bail-outs, forcing banks to reorganize under bankruptcy laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saukvalley.com/articles/2007/11/02/news/state/293146607163817.txt &quot;Former candidate returns to Illinois&quot;], saukvalley.com, November 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spring 2007 he was an honorary foreign guest at a ceremony in honor of the 80th Birthday of Professor [[Stanislav Menshikov]] at the Russian Academy of Sciences.&lt;ref name=&quot;zavtra.ru&quot;/&gt;

After the onset of the [[late-2000s financial crisis]], coverage of LaRouche began to increase. Tatiana Shishova interviewed him for ''[[RT (TV network)|Russia Today]]'' in 2008, describing him as &quot;the greatest American economist, a prominent politician, one of the first to struggle with the financial oligarchy and its major institutions—the World Bank and IMF. He has no equal in the field of economic and financial forecasts.&quot; She said that he predicted the Russian default in 1998, and in 2007 the collapse of the world markets, speaking at a hearing in the Russian [[State Duma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shishov|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; LaRouche's forecast was also covered that year in the Chinese news agency [[Xinhua]].&lt;ref&gt;''Xinhua,'' [http://gb.cri.cn/19224/2008/10/04/3365s2268021.htm America reported that the financial crisis could have been avoided] October 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2008, Ivo Caizzi of ''[[Corriere della Sera]]'' referred to him as &quot;the guru politician who, since the nineties, has announced the crash of speculative finances and the need for a New [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods]].&quot; The article said Italian Economics Minister [[Giulio Tremonti]] was &quot;an attentive reader&quot; of LaRouche's anti-Free Market and anti-Marxist writings. Italian Senator [[Oskar Peterlini]], in a July 2009 speech before the Senate, called LaRouche an expert in the field who had predicted the crisis. Italian Euro-parliamentarian Mario Borghezio of the Northern League was quoted calling LaRouche, &quot;an heretical economist who had forecast the financial crisis much in advance, and who has long since developed a lucid and deep analysis of the distortions of the world economic system.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;For Caizzi, see {{harvnb|Caizzi|2008}}.

*For Borghezio, see Foxman, Abraham, ''Jews and Money: The Story of a Stereotype'', p. 125, Macmillan, Nov 9, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; LaRouche gave an interview in 2009 to Ju Hui of ''[[China Youth Daily]]'', who wrote that LaRouche had warned in July 2007 that unless the United States stopped monopolizing world finances, and united with China, Russia, and India to reorganize the world financial system, a new global credit crisis would be unavoidable.&lt;ref&gt;Hui, Ju.

Sergei Dyshlevsky in the Russian magazine ''Spekulant'' wrote in 2010 that LaRouche had been gaining popularity thanks to two successful long-term forecasts. In the first one made in the late 50s, he predicted the end of the [[Bretton Woods system]], which was liquidated in 1971. The second forecast predicted a new systemic crisis – the total collapse of the global economic system.&lt;ref&gt;Dyshlevsky, Sergei, [http://www.spekulant.ru/archive/2002_11_st01.html &quot;The Italian Breakthrough&quot;, ''Spekulant'', November 2010. ]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 an in-depth series of articles on LaRouche appeared in ''Terra America'', a project of journalists formerly associated with [[The Russia Journal]].

[[File:Obama Hitler political sign.jpg|thumb|180px|LaRouche poster of [[Barack Obama]] with a [[Toothbrush moustache|'Hitler mustache']]]]

During the discussion of U.S. health care reform in 2009, LaRouche advocated a [[single-payer health care]] bill, and took exception to what he described as [[Barack Obama]]'s proposal that &quot;independent boards of doctors and health care experts [should] make the life-and-death decisions of what care to provide, and what not, based on cost-effectiveness criteria.&quot; LaRouche said the proposed boards, later compared to &quot;[[death panels]]&quot; by [[Sarah Palin]], would amount to the same thing as the [[Nazis]]' [[Action T4]] euthanasia program, and urged Americans to &quot;quickly and suddenly change the behavior of this president ... for no lesser reason than that your sister might not end up in somebody's gas oven.&quot;  Images at tables of volunteers compared Obama to [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]], and at least one had a picture of Obama with a Hitler-style mustache. In Seattle, police were called twice in response to people threatening to attack the volunteers. During one widely reported public meeting, Congressman [[Barney Frank]] referred to the images as &quot;vile, contemptible nonsense.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Overley, Jeff. &quot;LaRouche activists press message; Demonstrators battle health care overhaul by likening ideas to Hitler's policies&quot;, ''Orange County Register'', August 23, 2009.

===FDR===
Supporters of LaRouche call him a political leader in the tradition of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], and LaRouche frequently refers to FDR as a model president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larouchepub.com/other/2004/3132lar_victory_plan.html Steinberg, August 14, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Heritage Foundation]], a conservative think tank, wrote that LaRouche leads &quot;what may well be one of the strangest political groups in American history.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060119064440/http://www.heritage.org/Research/PoliticalPhilosophy/upload/91214_1.pdf Copulus, July 1984], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Foundation, LaRouche believes that a super elite (the &quot;oligarchy&quot;) is in control of world events, a group that includes the Rockefellers, the London financial center, the British royal family, the Anti-Defamation League, the KGB, and the Heritage Foundation itself. Others include Nazis, Jesuits, Freemasons, Communists, Trilateralists, international bankers, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Socialist International—all supposedly controlled by the British—as well as Hitler, H.G. Wells, Voltaire, and the Beatles as representatives of the [[Counterculture of the 1960s|1960s counterculture]]. [[George Johnson (writer)|George Johnson]] in ''Architects of Fear'' (1983) compares the view to the [[New_World_Order_(conspiracy_theory)#Illuminati|Illuminati conspiracy theory]]; after he wrote about LaRouche in ''The New York Times'', LaRouche's followers denounced Johnson as part of a conspiracy of elitists that began in ancient Egypt.&lt;ref name=Johnson2&gt;{{harvnb|Copulus|1984}}, p. 2.

LaRouche sees history as a battle between [[Platonism|Platonists]], who believe in absolute truth, and [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelians]], who rely on [[empiricism|empirical]] data. Platonists in LaRouche's view include figures such as [[Beethoven]], [[Mozart]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. He believes that many of the world's ills result from the dominance of Aristotelianism as embraced by the [[Empiricism#British_empiricism|empirical philosophers]] (such as Hobbes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume), leading to a culture that favors the empirical over the [[metaphysics|metaphysical]], embraces [[moral relativism]], and seeks to keep the general population uninformed. Industry, technology, and classical music should be used to enlighten the world, LaRouche argues, whereas the Aristotelians use psychotherapy, drugs, rock music, jazz, environmentalism, and quantum theory to bring about a new dark age in which the world will be ruled by the oligarchs. Left and right are false distinctions for LaRouche; what matters is the Platonic versus Aristotelian outlook, a position that has led him to form relationships with groups as disparate as farmers, nuclear engineers, [[African American Muslims|Black Muslims]], Teamsters and pro-life advocates. The conspirators may not be in touch with one another: &quot;From their standpoint, [the conspirators] are proceeding by instinct,&quot; LaRouche has said. &quot;If you're asking how their policy is developed—if there is an inside group sitting down and making plans—no, it doesn't work that way ... History doesn't function quite that consciously.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toumey|1996|p=85ff.}}

It started a campaign against the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith (ADL), which included setting up a group called &quot;The Provisional Committee to Clean Up B'Nai Brith.&quot; Montgomery wrote that material sold by LaRouche organizers in airports and shopping centers included a book that said Jews dominated the drug trade with the help of Jewish bankers.

LaRouche maintained that he was anti-Zionist, not anti-Semitic.&lt;ref name=Montgomery1979/&gt; When the ADL accused him of anti-Semitism in 1979, he filed a $26-million libel suit; Justice Michael Dontzin of the New York Supreme Court ruled that it was [[fair comment]], and that the facts &quot;reasonably give rise&quot; to that description.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Copulus|1984}}, p. 4, footnote 5.

George Johnson argued that King's presentation failed to take into account that several members of LaRouche's inner circle were themselves Jewish. [[Daniel Pipes]] wrote in 1997 that LaRouche's references to the British really were to the British, though he agreed that an alleged British-Jewish alliance lay at the heart of LaRouche's conspiracism.&lt;ref&gt;For Lerman, see {{harvnb|Lerman|1988|p=213}}.

[[Manning Marable]] of Columbia University wrote in 1998 that LaRouche tried in the mid-1980s to build bridges to the black community. Marable argued that most of the community was not fooled, and quoted the [[A. Philip Randolph Institute]], an organization for African-American trade unionists, declaring that &quot;LaRouche appeals to fear, hatred and ignorance. He seeks to exploit and exacerbate the anxieties and frustrations of Americans by offering an array of scapegoats and enemies: Jews, Zionists, international bankers, blacks, labor unions-much the way Hitler did in Germany.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Manning 1998&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Manning|1998}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During LaRouche's slander suit against NBC in 1984, [[Roy Innis]], leader of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], took the stand for LaRouche as a character witness, stating under oath that LaRouche's views on racism were &quot;consistent with his own.&quot; Asked whether he had seen any indication of racism in LaRouche's associates, he replied that he had not.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|George|Wilcox|1992|pp=317, 322}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Innis received criticism from many blacks for having testified on LaRouche's behalf.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manning 1998&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bivins, Larry. &quot;Frist embraces King's legacy,&quot; ''USA Today'', January 21, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrei Fursov, a Russian historian and academician at the International Academy of Sciences in Innsbruck, Austria, was interviewed in 2012 by the Russian publication ''Terra America'' and asked to comment on the characterizations of LaRouche in Western media. He replied that intellectuals who have called LaRouche a fascist do not deserve to be called intellectuals, and that the charge has no basis in any real scientific analysis of politics.&lt;ref&gt;Benedictine, Kyrill, interview with Andrei Fursov, [http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fterra-america.ru%2Fintellektuali-nazivaushie-larusha-fashistom-ne-yavlyautsya-intellektualami.aspx Intellectuals who have called LaRouche a fascist do not deserve to be called intellectuals], Terra-America, April 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Movement==
{{main|LaRouche movement}}
Estimates of the size of LaRouche's movement have varied over the years; most say there is a core membership of 500–2000. The estimated 600 members in 1978 paid monthly dues of $24. Johnson wrote in 1983 that the Fusion Energy Foundation and National Democratic Policy Committee had attracted some 20,000 members, as well as 300,000 magazine subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;In 1974 Larouche said the NCLC had 1,000 members and his other organizations 1,000–2,000; see Valentine, Paul W.

*In 1987 John Mintz of the ''Washington Post'' wrote that there more than 500 members worldwide; see Mintz, September 20, 1987.
*In 2004 ''The Washington Post'' estimated that the LaRouche Youth Movement had hundreds of members in the U.S. and more abroad; see {{harvnb|Witt|2004}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1987 article by John Mintz in ''The Washington Post'' reported that members lived hand-to-mouth in crowded apartments, their basic needs—such as a mattress and pillowcase—paid for by the movement. They worked raising money or selling newspapers for LaRouche, doing research for him, or singing in a group choir, spending almost every waking hour together.&lt;ref name=MintzSep201987&gt;[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73846043.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Sep+20%2C+1987&amp;author=John+Mintz&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=c.01&amp;desc=Inside+the+Weird+World+of+Lyndon+LaRouche Mintz, September 20, 1987].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Christopher Toumey, LaRouche's [[charismatic authority]] within the movement is grounded on members' belief that he possesses a unique level of insight and expertise. He identifies an emotionally charged issue, conducts in-depth research into it, then proposes a simplistic solution, usually involving restructuring of the economy or national security apparatus. He and the membership portray anyone opposing him as immoral and part of the conspiracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Toumey|1996|p=86}}, and Mintz, September 20, 1987; see above.&lt;/ref&gt; The group is known for its caustic attacks on people it opposes and former members. In the past it has justified what it refers to as &quot;psywar techniques&quot; as necessary to shake people up; Johnson in 1983 quoted a LaRouche associate: &quot;We're not very nice, so we're hated. Why be nice? It's a cruel world. We're in a war and the human race is up for grabs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Johnson|1983|pp=191–192}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Tate, a former long-term LaRouche associate, told ''The Washington Post'' in 1987 that members see themselves as not subject to the ordinary laws of society: &quot;They feel that the continued existence of the human race is totally dependent on what they do in the organization, that nobody would be here without LaRouche. They feel justified in a peculiar way doing anything whatsoever.&quot;&lt;ref name=MintzSep201987/&gt;
