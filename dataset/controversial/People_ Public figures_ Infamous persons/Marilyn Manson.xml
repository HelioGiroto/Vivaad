'''Brian Hugh Warner''' (born January 5, 1969), better known by his [[stage name]] '''Marilyn Manson''', is an American rock musician and former [[Music journalism|music journalist]] known for his controversial stage persona and image as the lead singer of the [[eponymous]] band [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]. His stage name was formed from juxtaposing the names of two American [[cultural icon]]s, namely actress [[Marilyn Monroe]] and [[Manson murders|multiple murder]] convict [[Charles Manson]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2violent.com/closing_argument.html Charles Manson Trial], 2violent.com.&lt;/ref&gt; as a critical and, simultaneously, laudatory appraisal of [[United States|America]] and its peculiar [[American culture|culture]].&lt;ref name=&quot;longhard&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=The Long Hard Road out of Hell |last=Manson |first=Marilyn |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1998|isbn=0-06-098746-4|pages=85–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001504/bio|title=Biography for Marilyn Manson|accessdate=January 12, 2008|work=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seemingly outrageous visual and vocal styles he employs, his unique interpretations of familiar songs and the controversy surrounding his lyrics and imagery have led to his very pronounced public appeal.&lt;ref name=&quot;youtube&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkxomNoPN-Q|title=Fox News Marylin Manson Interview|accessdate=January 12, 2008|work=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[file:BrianWarner.gif|thumb|left|Manson as a kid.]] --&gt;

Marilyn Manson was born in [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]], [[Ohio]]. He is the only child of Barbra Warner (maiden name Wyer) and Hugh Warner.&lt;ref name=autob/&gt; Manson is of [[Germans|German]] and [[Poland|Polish]] descent on his father's side,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethnicelebs.com/marilyn-manson |title=Marilyn Manson &amp;#124; EthniCelebs - Celebrity Ethnicity &amp;#124;What Nationality Background Ancestry Race |publisher=EthniCelebs |date=1969-01-05 |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a [[Cousin#Explanation chart|fourth cousin twice removed]] of Conservative commentator [[Pat Buchanan]].&lt;ref name=autob&gt;According to his autobiography ''[[The Long Hard Road Out of Hell]]''; {{cite web|url=http://www.allaboutpopularissues.org/marilyn-manson.htm|title=Marilyn Manson|work=PopularIssues.org|accessdate=February 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/warnerbh.html |title=Ancestry of Marilyn Manson |publisher=Wargs.com |date= |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his autobiography ''[[The Long Hard Road Out of Hell]]'', he detailed his grandfather's sexual fetishes (including [[bestiality]] and [[sadomasochism]]) which led to the forming of [[Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids]].
 
As a child, he attended his mother's [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] church, though his father was [[Catholic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anthony DeCurtis |url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Entertainment/Music/2001/05/Manson-Interview.aspx?p=2 |title=Marilyn Manson: The Beliefnet Interview |publisher=Beliefnet.com |date= |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/1997/072497/cover.html |title=Marilyn Manson |publisher=Montrealmirror.com |date=July 24, 1997 |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warner attended [[Heritage Christian School (Canton, Ohio)|Heritage Christian School]] from first grade to tenth grade. He later transferred to philosophy in Glenoak High School Canton and graduated from there in 1987, and later became a student at an art college in Fort Lauderdale, FL, in 1990. He was working towards a degree in journalism and gaining experience in the field by writing articles for a music magazine, ''[[25th Parallel (magazine)|25th Parallel]]''. He would soon meet several of the musicians to whom his own band would later be compared, including [[My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult]], The Perfect, and [[Trent Reznor]] of [[Nine Inch Nails]].

==Career==
===Music===
{{Main|Marilyn Manson (band)}}

Manson formed together with guitarist [[Scott Putesky]], [[Marilyn Manson &amp; the Spooky Kids]] in Florida in 1989 (the name was shortened to Marilyn Manson in 1992). While with The Spooky Kids, he was involved with [[Jeordie White]] (also known as Twiggy Ramirez) and Stephen Gregory Bier Jr. (also known as [[Madonna Wayne Gacy]]) in two side-projects: [[Satan on Fire]], a faux-[[Christian rock|Christian]] [[heavy metal music|metal]] ensemble where he played bass guitar, and drums in Mrs. Scabtree, a collaborative band formed with White and then girlfriend [[Jessicka]] (vocalist with the band Jack Off Jill) as a way to combat contractual agreements that prohibited Marilyn Manson from playing in certain clubs. In the summer of 1993, the band drew the attention of [[Trent Reznor]]. Reznor produced their 1994 debut album, ''[[Portrait of an American Family]]'' and released it on his [[Nothing Records]] label. The band began to develop a [[cult following]], which grew larger with the release of ''[[Smells Like Children]]'' in 1995. That EP yielded the band's first big MTV hit with &quot;[[Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This) (song)|Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)]],&quot; a cover of the 1983 [[Eurythmics]] hit. ''[[Antichrist Superstar]]'' (co-produced by Trent Reznor) was an even greater success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.basetendencies.com/interview/GWDec96.html|title=Dangerous Creatures: Marilyn Manson have come for your Children|work=Guitar World.|date=December, 1996|accessdate=June 21, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070604180615/http://www.basetendencies.com/interview/GWDec96.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = June 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US alone, three of the band's albums have been awarded platinum certification, three more gold, and the band has had seven releases debut in the top ten, including two number-one albums. Manson first worked as a producer with the band [[Jack Off Jill]]. He helped name the band and produce most of the band's early recordings, and also played guitar on the song &quot;My Cat&quot; and had the band open most of his [[South Florida]] shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV1&quot;&gt;[http://www.marilynmansonimages.com/band-history5.html/ ]{{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manson later wrote the [[liner notes]] to the band's album ''[[Humid Teenage Mediocrity 1992-1995]]'', a collection of early Jack Off Jill recordings. Manson has appeared as a guest performer on [[DMX (rapper)|DMX]]'s album ''[[Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV2&quot;&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1428218/19981023/dmx.jhtml/ Manson Hooks Up With DMX October 23, 1998]&quot;. Retrieved June 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[Godhead (band)|Godhead]]'s ''[[2000 Years of Human Error]]'' album — the only album released on his [[vanity label]] Posthuman.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/godhead/artist.jhtml#bio/|title=Godhead Biography|work=MTV News.|date=May 5, 1999|accessdate=June 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/marilyn-manson/3082 |title=Manson Launches New Posthuman Label|work=[[NME]] |date=April 12, 2000|accessdate=March 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 it was revealed that Manson was to appear on the singer [[Skylar Grey]]'s album &quot;Invinsible&quot; on the track entitled &quot;Can't Haunt Me&quot;.

===Film and television===
[[File:Marilyn Manson Cannes.jpg|thumb|left|165px|Manson at the 2006 [[Festival de Cannes]].]]
[[File:Manson en concierto 6.jpg|thumb|200px|upright|right|Manson in December of 2007.]]
Manson made his film debut in 1997, as an actor in [[David Lynch]]'s ''[[Lost Highway (1997 film)|Lost Highway]]''. Since then he has appeared in a variety of minor roles and cameos, including ''[[Party Monster (2003 film)|Party Monster]]''; then-girlfriend [[Rose McGowan]]'s 1999 film ''[[Jawbreaker (film)|Jawbreaker]]''; [[Asia Argento]]'s 2004 film ''[[The Heart Is Deceitful Above All Things]]''; ''[[Rise: Blood Hunter|Rise]]''; and ''[[The Hire: Beat The Devil]]'', the sixth instalment in the [[BMW films|BMW Films]] series. He was interviewed in [[Michael Moore]]'s political documentary ''[[Bowling for Columbine]]'' discussing possible motivations for the [[Columbine High School massacre|Columbine massacre]] and allegations that his music was somehow a factor. He has appeared in animated form in ''[[Clone High]]'' and participated in several episodes of the MTVseries ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch]]'', becoming the show's unofficial champion and mascot; he often performed the voice for his [[claymation|claymated]] puppet, and contributed the song &quot;[[Astonishing Panorama of the Endtimes]]&quot; to the soundtrack album. In July 2005, Manson told ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' that he was shifting his focus from music to filmmaking – &quot;I just don't think the world is worth putting music into right now. I no longer want to make art that other people — particularly record companies — are turning into a product. I just want to make art.&quot;

Johnny Depp reportedly used Manson as his inspiration for his performance as Willy Wonka in the film ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]''. Manson himself expressed interest in playing the role of Willy Wonka in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifimoviepage.com/art_charlie.html |title=Charlie &amp; the Chocolate Factory – Preview |publisher=Sci-Fi Movie Page |date=July 19, 2005 |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=November 2010}}

He had been working on his directorial debut, ''[[Phantasmagoria: The Visions of Lewis Carroll]]'', since 2004, with Manson also set to portray the role of [[Lewis Carroll]], author of ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]''. Initially announced as a web-only release, it was later decided to give the estimated $4.2 million budget film a conventional cinema release, with a slated release date of mid-2007. The film was to have an original music soundtrack with previously unreleased songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.side-line.com/news_comments.php?id=15724_0_2_0_C/|title=Marilyn Manson announces details first low budget film|work=SIDE-LINE.com|date=July 5, 2006|accessdate=February 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the film had been postponed indefinitely until after the ''Eat Me, Drink Me'' tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=76734|title='Phantasmagoria' Film Still In Pipeline|work=BLABBERMOUTH.NET|date=July 13, 2007|accessdate=February 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, studio bosses shut down production on the project, reportedly due to viewers' responses to the violent content of clips released on the internet. The film was later officially put on &quot;indefinite production hold&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/story/coles-violent-film-put-on-indefinite-hold_1165177 |title=Lily Cole &amp;#124; Cole's Violent Film Put On Indefinite Hold |publisher=Contactmusic |date= |accessdate=2012-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, according to an interview with co-writer Anthony Silva about the hold, the film was still on and the talk of it being shut down was just a myth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marilynmansonfrance.free.fr/index.php/anthony-silva-exclusive-interview |title='&amp;#39;Phantasmagoria: The Visions of Anthony Silva'&amp;#39; Exclusive Interview |publisher=Marilynmansonfrance.free.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manson will portray metalband lead singer Lars in the upcoming slasher Splatter Sisters, for which he will also contribute an original soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/37957/more-details-adam-bhala-loughs-splatter-sisters|title=More Details on Adam Bhala Lough's Splatter Sisters|work=[[Dread Central]]|date=June 10, 2010|accessdate=June 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art===
Manson stated in a 2004 interview with ''[[i-D magazine]]'' to have begun his career as a [[watercolor]] painter in 1999 when he made five-minute concept pieces and sold them to drug dealers. On September 13–14, 2002, his first show, The Golden Age of Grotesque, was held at the Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions Centre. ''[[Art in America]]'''s Max Henry likened them to the works of a &quot;psychiatric patient given materials to use as [[art therapy|therapy]]&quot; and said his work would never be taken seriously in a fine-art context, writing that the value was &quot;in their celebrity, not the work&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/620624/20000122/story.jhtml|title=Shocker! Marilyn Manson Can Paint, Art Critics Say|author=Smith, Dakota|work=VH1 News|date=January 24, 2000|accessdate=February 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 14–15, 2004, Manson held a second exhibition on the first night in Paris and the second in Berlin. The show was named 'Trismegistus' which was also the title of the center piece of the exhibit – a large, three-headed Christ painted onto an antique wood panel from a portable embalmers table.

Manson named his self-proclaimed [[art movement]] '''Celebritarian Corporation'''. He has coined a [[slogan]] for the movement: “We will sell our shadow to those who stand within it.” In 2005 he said that the Celebritarian Corporation has been &quot;incubating for seven years&quot; which if correct would indicate that Celebritarian Corporation, in some form, started in 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV News&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1512539/20051028/marilyn_manson.jhtml?headlines=true|title=Marilyn Manson Likens His New Guitar God To A Naked Woman|accessdate=September 27, 2007|publisher=MTV News|date=October 28, 2005|author=Harris, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Celebritarian Corporation is also the namesake of an [[art gallery]] owned by Manson, called the '''Celebritarian Corporation Gallery of Fine Art''' in Los Angeles for which his third exhibition was the inaugural show. From April 2–17, 2007, his recent works were on show at the Space 39 Modern &amp; Contemporary in Florida. 40 pieces from this show traveled to Germany's Gallery Brigitte Schenk in [[Cologne]] to be publicly exhibited from June 28 – July 28, 2007. Manson was refused admittance to [[Kölner Dom]] (Cologne Cathedral), when he was in the city to attend the opening night. This was, according to Manson, due to his makeup.

Manson revealed a series of 20 paintings in 2010 entitled ''Genealogies of Pain'', an exhibition showcased at Vienna's Kunsthalle gallery&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/marilyn-mansons-art-scarier-than-music-20100630-zjyy.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Marilyn Manson's art 'scarier than music' | date=June 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which the artist collaborated on with [[David Lynch]].

===Video games===
Manson made an appearance in the video game ''[[Area 51 (first-person shooter)|Area 51]]'' as Edgar, a [[Grey alien|Grey Alien]]. His song &quot;Cruci-Fiction In Space&quot; is featured in a commercial for a video game, ''[[The Darkness (video game)|The Darkness]]''. His likeness is also featured on the ''[[Celebrity Deathmatch (video game)|Celebrity Deathmatch]]'' video game for which he recorded a song for the soundtrack (2003). The song &quot;Use your fist and not your mouth&quot; was the credits score of the game ''[[Cold Fear]]'' as well as ''[[Spawn: Armageddon]]''. The song &quot;Four Rusted Horses&quot; had an alternate version used in trailers for the video game [[F3ar|Fear 3.]] A remix of the song &quot;[[Tainted Love]]&quot; appears in the debut trailer for the game, [[Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit (2010 video game)|Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit]] and in the launch trailer of [[Twisted Metal]].

===Other===
Manson launched &quot;Mansinthe,&quot; his own brand of Swiss-made [[absinthe]], which has received mixed reviews from some critics who described the taste as being &quot;just plain&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;epicurious&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epicurious.com/articlesguides/blogs/editor/2008/02/absinthe-taste.html|title=Absinthe Taste Test Part 3: Mansinthe (Marilyn Manson Absinthe) |work=Side-Line.com|date=September 4, 2008|accessdate=February 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; however it came second to Versinthe in an Absinthe top five&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ali |first=Erial |url=http://www.esquire.com/features/drinking/absinthe-0808 |title=Esquire Mansinthe 2nd in top five |publisher=Esquire.com |date=August 5, 2008 |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An energy drink called &quot;Eat Me, Drink Me&quot; was also produced for a limited time, inspired by Marilyn Manson's album ''[[Eat Me, Drink Me]]''. The drink was manufactured by Boston America Co., and it is currently out of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mansonwiki.com/wiki/Eat_Me,_Drink_Me_(drink) |title=Eat Me, Drink Me (drink) - The Marilyn Manson Wiki |publisher=Mansonwiki.com |date=2010-10-01 |accessdate=2012-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marilyn Manson has spent many years being classed as a Goth singer due to misinformation from the media &amp; fans and has constantly stated in many interviews that he is not a part of the goth scene. He states &quot;I am a shock rocker and here to shock people, and I am in no way connected to the goth scene.&quot; The misinformation is due to his part of wild black clothing &amp; makeup which he states is to shock people &quot;Just like Bowie, Alice Cooper &amp; Kiss did, I am a modern day version of the glam/shock rock scene.&quot;{{fact|date=October 2012}}

==Relationships==
Manson was engaged to actress [[Rose McGowan]] from February 1999 to January 19, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson |first=Tina |url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/1438096/20010119/index.jhtml |title=And It Was So Close to Valentine's Day, Too |publisher=[[VH1]] |date=January 19, 2001 |accessdate=April 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She often appeared with him at celebrity events at the time in extremely provocative clothing, such as the chain-mail transparent dress and thong she wore to the 1998 [[MTV Video Music Awards]]. McGowan later ended their two year long engagement over &quot;lifestyle differences&quot;.

[[Image:Marilyn Manson in a Podium.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Manson's concerts are known for being extremely theatrical.]]
Manson and [[Dita Von Teese]] first met when he asked her to dance in one of his music videos. Though she was unable to, the two kept in contact. On his 32nd birthday, in 2001, she arrived with a bottle of absinthe, and they became a couple. Manson proposed on March 22, 2004 and gave her a 1930s, 7-carat, European round-cut diamond engagement ring. On November 28, 2005, Manson and von Teese were married in a private, [[non-denominational]] ceremony in their home.

American pornographic actress and model [[Stoya]] was the girlfriend of Manson from March until November 2009. A statement on her [[Twitter]] page, posted on December 4, 2009, read: &quot;We simply weren't right for each other. Just because we had fun doesn't mean we were meant to be long term.

Manson has recently been romantically linked to American photographer Lindsay Usich, who is credited as the photo source for the cover art of his most recent album, ''[[Born Villain]]''. Usich was referred to as Manson's girlfriend in the March 2012 issue of [[Revolver (magazine)|Revolver]] magazine. In the article a reference is made to a new painting by Manson featuring Usich as well.

==Lawsuits==
In September 1996, former bassist [[Gidget Gein]] negotiated a settlement with Manson where he would receive $17,500 in cash, 20 percent of any royalties paid for recordings and for any songs he had a hand in writing and his share of any other royalties or fees the group earned while he was a member. Furthermore, the settlement allowed him to market himself as a former member of Marilyn Manson. This settlement was not honored, however.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spookykids.net/articles/Daisy_Suit.htm ''Pushing Up Daisy Berkowitz'']. ''City Link''. Jane Musgrave. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Former guitarist and founding member [[Scott Putesky]] (aka [[Daisy Berkowitz]]) filed a $15 million lawsuit in a Fort Lauderdale court against the singer, the [[Marilyn Manson (band)|band]] and the band's attorney, [[David Codikow]] in January 1998 after his forcible departure from the group in the spring of 1996. Berkowitz claimed he was cheated by the band out of &quot;thousands of dollars in royalties, publishing rights, and performance fees.&quot; He also filed an attorney malpractice suit against Codikow, alleging that &quot;Codikow represented Warner's interests more than the band's and that he gave Warner disproportionate control over the band's name, recordings, merchandising, and touring proceeds.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1431766/daisy-berkowitz-takes-marilyn-manson-court.jhtml |title=Daisy Berkowitz Takes Marilyn Manson To Court |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=January 26, 1998 |accessdate=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bendersky |first=Ari |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/marilyn-manson-sued-by-former-member-19970924 |title=Marilyn Manson Sued By Former Member |publisher=''Rolling Stone'' |date=September 24, 1997 |accessdate=June 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By October of that year, the suit had been settled out of court for an undisclosed amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1431734/manson-settles-daisy-berkowitz-lawsuit-denies-label-pressured-him-do-so.jhtml |title=Manson Settles Daisy Berkowitz Lawsuit, Denies Label Pressured Him To Do So |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=October 14, 1998 |accessdate=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 30, 1998, a few days after the band accumulated &quot;[a] total [of] more than $25,000&quot; in backstage and hotel room damages during the [[Poughkeepsie, New York]] stop of their [[Mechanical Animals Tour]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1431728/marilyn-manson-wrecks-backstage-area-hotel-rooms-rock-roll-melee.jhtml |title=Marilyn Manson Wrecks Backstage Area, Hotel Rooms In Rock &amp; Roll Melee |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=November 25, 1998 |accessdate=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Spin (magazine)|SPIN]]'' editor Craig Marks filed a $24 million lawsuit against Manson and his bodyguards for allegedly assaulting his person and threatening to kill his family. According to Mark's interview with the ''[[New York Post]]'', the issue stemmed from Manson's displeasure with the magazine's decision to renege on a promised cover story of the [[Marilyn Manson (band)|band]] for their January 1998 cover. According to Marks, the last-minute change was made because [[Antichrist Superstar|Manson's record]] wasn't &quot;performing.&quot; The ''Post'' described the editor as &quot;bruised and battered.&quot; Manson for his part issued a statement saying, &quot;I had a conversation with Craig Marks expressing I was tired of ''Spin'''s immature business behavior and the series of deals they had broken with me. I told him that I didn't care what he prints or whether or not I'm on the cover. I simply no longer wanted to work with him or his magazine that obviously has a lack of respect for musicians and their fans.&quot; On February 19, 1999, Manson counter-sued Marks for libel, slander and defamation. The singer was seeking $40 million in reparation, claiming that Marks' statements were false and &quot;were made ... with actual malice, hatred and personal ill will.&quot; According to the counter-suit, Marks' allegations have &quot;greatly damaged and injured [Manson's] reputation and standing in the music profession, in the music and entertainment industries, in his community and in the general public, and has been subjected to great shame, humiliation and indignity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/news/articles/512301/19990220/index.jhtml |title=Manson Countersues Ex-Spin Editor For $40M |publisher=[[VH1]] |date=February 20, 1999 |accessdate=April 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for the Poughkeepsie incident, Manson apologized and offered to make financial restitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1431727/did-manson-spin-out-control.jhtml |title=Did Manson &quot;Spin&quot; Out Of Control? |publisher=[[MTV News]] |date=November 30, 1998 |accessdate=March 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AP#129&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=John Pecorelli |date= |year=1999 |month=April |title=MansonWorld |journal=[[Alternative Press]] |volume= |series= |issue=#129 |page= |pages=44–52 |chapter= |publisher= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
