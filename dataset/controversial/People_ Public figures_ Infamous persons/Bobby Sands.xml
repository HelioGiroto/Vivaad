'''Robert Gerard &quot;Bobby&quot; Sands''' ({{lang-ga|'''Roibeárd Gearóid Ó Seachnasaigh'''}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nuzhound.com/articles/Irelandclick/arts2006/mar6_cage_eleven__OHearn_book.php |title=Legacy of Cage Eleven |publisher=Nuzhound.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 9 March 1954{{spaced ndash}}5 May 1981) was an Irish [[Volunteer (Irish republican)|volunteer]] of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] and member of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British Parliament]] who died on [[hunger strike]] while imprisoned in [[Maze (HM Prison)|HM Prison Maze]].

He was the leader of the [[1981 Irish hunger strike|1981 hunger strike]] in which [[Irish republican]] prisoners protested against the removal of [[Special Category Status]]. During his strike he was elected as a member of the British Parliament as an [[Anti H-Block|Anti H-Block/Armagh Political Prisoner]] candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/northern_ireland/understanding/events/hunger_strike.stm |work=BBC News |accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/politics/election/rwby1981a.htm |title=CAIN: Politics: Elections: Westminster By-election (NI) Thursday 9 April 1981 |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date=1981-04-09 |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; His death resulted in a new surge of IRA recruitment and activity. International media coverage brought attention to the hunger strikers, and the republican movement in general, attracting both praise and criticism.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAIN BERESFORD&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/hstrike/beresford.htm |title=CAIN archive at the University of Ulster |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date=1981-05-05 |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years and family==
Sands was born into a [[Roman Catholic]] family&lt;ref&gt;Feehan, ''Bobby Sands MP and the Tragedy of Northern Ireland'', p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sands, ''Writings from Prison''&lt;/ref&gt; in Abbots Cross, but also lived in a house in Doonbeg Drive, [[Newtownabbey]], [[County Antrim]], [[Northern Ireland]], and lived there until 1960&lt;ref name=&quot;oh&quot;&gt;O'Hearn, ''Bobby Sands: Nothing but an Unfinished Song''&lt;/ref&gt; whereupon the family were forced to move to [[Rathcoole (Belfast)|Rathcoole]], Newtownabbey.&lt;ref name=&quot;oh&quot;/&gt; His first sister, Marcella, was born in April 1955 and second sister, [[Bernadette Sands McKevitt|Bernadette]], in November 1958. His parents, John and Rosaleen, had another son, John, in 1962. On leaving school, he became an apprentice coach-builder until he was forced out at gunpoint by loyalists.&lt;ref&gt;Feehan, ''Bobby Sands and the Tragedy of Northern Ireland'', p 13–14&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|reason=who was forced out? Bobby or John?|date=November 2011}}

In June 1972, at the age of 18, Bobby moved with his family to the [[Twinbrook, Belfast|Twinbrook]] housing estate in west [[Belfast]], and had to leave Rathcoole due to [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] intimidation.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hearn, ''Nothing but an unfinished song: Bobby Sands'', ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Geraldine Noade. His son, Gerard, was born 8 May 1973. Noade soon left to live in England with their son.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ten Men Dead:The Story of the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Ten Men Dead: The Story of the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike| author = David Beresford | publisher = Harper Collins Publishers | location = London| year = 1987 | isbn = 0-586-06533-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sands' sister [[Bernadette Sands McKevitt]] is also a prominent [[Irish Republican]]. Along with her husband [[Michael McKevitt]] she helped to form the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]] and is accused of involvement with the [[Real Irish Republican Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Toolis, &quot;{{Plain link|http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2003/aug/10/northernireland|2=McKevitt's inglorious career}}&quot;, ''[[The Observer]]'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Sands McKevitt is opposed to the [[Belfast Agreement]], stating that &quot;Bobby did not die for cross-border bodies with executive powers. He did not die for nationalists to be equal British citizens within the Northern Ireland state.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;English, ''Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA'', p 316–317&lt;/ref&gt;

==Provisional IRA activity==
In 1972, Sands joined the Provisional IRA.&lt;ref&gt;Geraghty, ''The Irish War, p. 68–70&lt;/ref&gt; He was arrested and charged in October 1972 with possession of four handguns found in the house where he was staying. Sands was convicted in April 1973 sentenced to five years' imprisonment and released in April 1976.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/events/hstrike/sands/sands81.htm#intro ''Cain Biography''] (Cain.ulst.ac.uk), s. 'intro'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Bobby Sands - An Irish Martyr? | first= Philip | last= Hanke | page=20 | publisher= GRIN Verlag | year= 2011 | isbn= 978-3-640-85967-2 | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=CyjxKg3zWwQC&amp;pg=PA20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his release from prison in 1976, he returned to his family home in West Belfast, and resumed his active role in the Provisional IRA's cause. He was charged with involvement in the October 1976 bombing of the Balmoral Furniture Company in [[Dunmurry]], although he was never convicted of this charge, the presiding judge stating that there was no evidence to support the assertion that Sands had taken part.&lt;ref&gt;Price, ''Keep On Running'' (WalesOnline.co.uk) p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; After the bombing, Sands and at least five others were alleged to have been involved in a gun battle with the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]], although due to lack of evidence, Sands was not convicted. Leaving behind two of their wounded friends, Seamus Martin and Gabriel Corbett, Sands, [[Joe McDonnell (hunger striker)|Joe McDonnell]], Seamus Finucane, and Sean Lavery tried to make their escape in a car, but were apprehended. Later, one of the revolvers used in the attack was found in the car in which Sands had been travelling.&lt;ref&gt;English, ''Armed Struggle: The History of the IRA'', p. 196–198&lt;/ref&gt; His trial in September 1977 saw him being convicted of possession of firearms (the revolver from which the prosecution alleged bullets had been fired at the RUC after the bombing) and Sands was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment within [[HM Prison Maze]], also known as [[Long Kesh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tkb.org/KeyLeader.jsp?memID=82 |title=Terrorism Knowledge Base Article on Bobby Sands |publisher=Tkb.org |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after his sentence, he was implicated in a ruckus and spent the first 22 days on boards in [[Crumlin Road (HM Prison)|Crumlin Road Prison]], 15 days naked, and a No. 1 starvation diet every 3 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Bobby Sands - An Irish Martyr? | first= Philip | last= Hanke | page=21 | publisher= GRIN Verlag | year= 2011 | isbn= 978-3-640-85967-2 | url= http://books.google.com/books?id=CyjxKg3zWwQC&amp;pg=PA21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long Kesh years==
In prison, Sands became a writer both of [[journalism]] and [[poetry]]—being published in the Irish republican newspaper ''[[An Phoblacht]]''. In late 1980 Sands was chosen as [[Officer Commanding]] of the Provisional IRA prisoners in Long Kesh, succeeding [[Brendan Hughes]] who was participating in the [[1981 Irish hunger strike#First hunger strike|first hunger strike]].

Republican prisoners organised a series of protests seeking to regain their previous [[Special Category Status]] and not be subject to ordinary prison regulations. This began with the &quot;[[blanket protest]]&quot; in 1976, in which the prisoners refused to wear prison uniform and wore blankets instead. In 1978, after a number of attacks on prisoners leaving their cells to &quot;[[slop out]]&quot; (i.e., empty their chamber pots), this escalated into the &quot;[[dirty protest]]&quot;, wherein prisoners refused to wash and smeared the walls of their cells with excrement.&lt;ref name=&quot;pt0&quot;&gt;Taylo, ''Provos, The IRA and Sinn Féin, p. 251–252&lt;/ref&gt;

==Published works==
While in prison Sands had several letters and articles published in the Republican paper ''An Phoblacht'' (en: ''Republican News'') under the pseudonym &quot;Marcella&quot;. Other writings attributed to him are: ''Skylark Sing Your Lonely Song'' &lt;ref&gt;1989, Mercier Press, ISBN 0-85342-726-7&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[One Day in My Life]]''.&lt;ref&gt;2001, Mercier Press, ISBN 1-85635-349-4&lt;/ref&gt; Sands also wrote the lyrics of &quot;Back Home in Derry&quot; and &quot;McIlhatton&quot;, which were both later recorded by [[Christy Moore]]; and he wrote &quot;Sad Song For Susan&quot; which was later recorded. The melody of &quot;Back Home in Derry&quot; was borrowed from [[Gordon Lightfoot]]'s famous 1976 song &quot;[[The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald]].&quot;

==Member of Parliament==
Shortly after the beginning of the strike, [[Frank Maguire]], the [[Independent Republican (Ireland)|Independent Republican]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] for [[Fermanagh and South Tyrone (UK Parliament constituency)|Fermanagh and South Tyrone]], died suddenly of a heart attack, precipitating the [[Fermanagh &amp; South Tyrone by-election, 1981 (April)|April 1981 by-election]]. 

The sudden vacancy in a seat with a nationalist majority of about five thousand was a valuable opportunity for Sands' supporters to unite the nationalist community behind their campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ten Men Dead:The Story of the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike&quot;/&gt; Pressure not to split the vote led other nationalist parties, notably the [[Social Democratic and Labour Party]], to withdraw, and Sands was nominated on the label &quot;[[Anti H-Block]] / Armagh Political Prisoner&quot;. After a highly polarised campaign, Sands narrowly won the seat on 9 April 1981, with 30,493 votes to 29,046 for the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] candidate [[Harry West]]—and also becoming the [[Baby of the House|youngest MP at the time]].&lt;ref&gt;BBC News,[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/april/10/newsid_2453000/2453183.stm ''1981: Hunger striker elected MP''] (April 1981)&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Sands' success, the British Government introduced the [[Representation of the People Act 1981]] which prevents prisoners serving jail terms of more than one year in either the UK or the Republic of Ireland from being nominated as candidates in British elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPA1981&quot;&gt;Julian Haviland, &quot;Bill to stop criminal candidates&quot;, ''The Times'', 13 June 1981, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gay, [http://66.102.9.104/search?q=cache:PRVM8FEsNY0J:www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/notes/snpc-03221.pdf+representation+of+the+people+act+1981&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3&amp;gl=uk Disqualification for membership of the House of Commons] (October 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; This law was introduced so as to prevent the other hunger strikers from being elected to the British parliament.&lt;ref&gt;Carol, [http://books.google.com/books?id=ihWjJR7m6SQC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=%22bobby+sands%22+representation+of+the+people+act+1981&amp;source=web&amp;ots=aZFYIkC08r&amp;sig=RrP6apPeZjMIUFot-2K1bJRQB_o#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bobby%20sands%22%20representation%20of%20the%20people%20act%201981&amp;f=false ''Constitutional and administrative law''], p. 112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hunger strike==
The [[1981 Irish hunger strike]] started with Sands refusing food on 1 March 1981. Sands decided that other prisoners should join the strike at staggered intervals in order to maximise publicity with prisoners steadily deteriorating successively over several months.

The hunger strike centred around five demands:
# the right not to wear a prison uniform;
# the right not to do prison work;
# the right of free association with other prisoners, and to organise educational and recreational pursuits;
# the right to one visit, one letter and one parcel per week;
# full restoration of remission lost through the protest.&lt;ref name=&quot;pt&quot;&gt;Taylor, ''Provos The IRA &amp; Sinn Féin'', p. 229–234&lt;/ref&gt;

The significance of the hunger strike was the prisoners' aim of being declared political prisoners (or prisoners of war) as opposed to criminals. The ''Washington Post'', reported that the primary aim of the hunger strike was to generate international publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Washington Post, 3 May 1981, 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:Bobbysandsgrave.JPG|left|thumb|Bobby Sands' grave in [[Milltown Cemetery]]]]
Sands died on 5 May 1981 in Maze prison hospital after 66 days of hunger-striking, aged 27.&lt;ref&gt;http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/proni/1981/proni_NIO-12-194A_1981-05-05.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The original [[pathologist]]'s report recorded Sands' and the other hunger strikers' causes of death as &quot;self-imposed starvation&quot;, later amended to simply &quot;starvation&quot; after protests from the dead strikers' families.&lt;ref name=Philosophy59OKeeffe&gt;O'Keeffe, &quot;[http://www.jstor.org/pss/3750951 Suicide and Self-Starvation Suicide and Self-starvation]&quot;, [[Philosophy (journal)|''Philosophy'']], Vol. 59, No. 229 (Jul., 1984), pp. 349–363&lt;/ref&gt; The [[coroner]] recorded verdicts of &quot;starvation, self-imposed&quot;.&lt;ref name=Philosophy59OKeeffe/&gt;

The announcement of Sands' death prompted several days of rioting in [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]] areas of [[Northern Ireland]]. A milk deliverer and his son, Eric and Desmond Guiney, died as a result of injuries sustained when their [[milk float]] crashed after being stoned by rioters in a predominantly nationalist area of north Belfast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = An Index of Deaths from Conflict in Ireland | author = Malcolm Sutton | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/sutton/chron/1981.html | publisher = CAIN | date = | accessdate = 2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A Chronology of the Conflict - 1981 | author = | url = http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/chron/ch81.htm | publisher = [[CAIN]] | accessdate = 2007-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 100,000 people lined the route of Sands' funeral and he was buried in the 'New Republican Plot' alongside 76 others. Their grave is maintained and cared for by the [[National Graves Association, Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/abstentionism/chron.htm |title=University of Ulster CAIN archive |publisher=Cain.ulst.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sands was a Member of the Westminster Parliament for 25 days, though he never took his seat or the oath.

In response to a question in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] on 5 May 1981, British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] said, &quot;Mr. Sands was a convicted criminal. He chose to take his own life. It was a choice that his organisation did not allow to many of its victims&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 1981 5 May Tu Margaret Thatcher House of Commons PQs | author = | url = http://www.margaretthatcher.org/speeches/displaydocument.asp?docid=104641 | publisher = Margaret Thatcher Foundation | date = | accessdate = 2007-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official announcement of Sands' death in the House of Commons omitted the customary expression of sense of loss and sympathy with the family of the member.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Hansard Historic Prototype | accessdate=2008-11-04 | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1981/may/05/death-of-a-member}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sands was survived by his parents, siblings, and his son, Gerard.

==== Reactions====
;Europe

[[File:Bobby sands mural in belfast320.jpg|right|thumb|Memorial mural along Falls Road, Belfast]]

In Europe, there were widespread protests after Sands' death. Five thousand [[Milan]]ese students burned the [[Union Flag]] and chanted 'Freedom for Ulster' during a march.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAIN BERESFORD&quot;/&gt; The British Consulate at [[Ghent]] was raided.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAIN BERESFORD&quot;/&gt; Thousands marched in [[Paris]] behind huge portraits of Sands, to chants of 'the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] will conquer'.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAIN BERESFORD&quot;/&gt; In the [[Assembleia da República|Portuguese Parliament]], the [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] stood for Sands.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAIN BERESFORD&quot;/&gt; In [[Oslo]], demonstrators threw a tomato at [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]], the [[Queen regnant|Queen]] of the United Kingdom, but missed. (The 28-year-old assailant claimed that he had not aimed for the queen, but rather for a smirking British soldier)&lt;ref name=&quot;CAIN BERESFORD&quot;/&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Punker siktet for majestetsfornærmelse | author = | url = | publisher = Aftenposten | date = 7 May 1981 | accessdate = | location=Oslo}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Soviet Union]], ''[[Pravda]]'' described it as 'another tragic page in the grim chronicle of oppression, discrimination, terror, and violence' in Ireland. Russian fans of Bobby Sands published a translation of the &quot;Back Home In Derry&quot; song (&quot;На Родину в Дерри&quot; in Russian).&lt;ref name=&quot;CAIN BERESFORD&quot;/&gt; Many [[France|French]] towns and cities have streets named after Sands, including in [[Nantes]], [[Saint-Étienne]], [[Le Mans]], [[Vierzon]], and [[Saint-Denis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = French intelligentsia ponders what should be done with killer | author = Colin Randall | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/1469419/Worldwide-French-intelligentsia-ponders-what-should-be-done-with-killer.html | publisher = The Daily Telegraph | date = 13 August 2004 | accessdate = 2007-05-25 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Republic of Ireland]], Sands' death led to riots and bus burning. IRA members allegedly unsuccessfully attempted to coerce proprietors of shops and other businesses into closing for a national day of mourning.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME-1&quot;/&gt; The West German newspaper ''[[Die Welt]]'' took a negative view of Sands.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAIN BERESFORD&quot;/&gt;

;Africa
News of the death of Bobby Sands influenced the way in which political prisoners and the [[African National Congress|ANC]] in South Africa responded to their own situation, and inspired a new way of resistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.co.uk&quot;&gt;http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=CyjxKg3zWwQC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=nelson+mandela+bobby+sands+funeral&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=l7g_cD7xXI&amp;sig=i7vK7ZscPTXxrNKkbvtqZPvl2lU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=uNl2UK3rEKiR0QWU44CADA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=nelson%20mandela%20bobby%20sands%20funeral&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anphoblacht.com/contents/15213&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nelson Mandela]] was said to have been &quot;directly influenced by Bobby Sands&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.co.uk&quot;/&gt; and instigated a successful Hunger Strike on [[Robben Island]].

;Americas
The US media expressed a range of opinions on Sands' death. The ''[[Boston Globe]]'' commented that &quot;[t]he slow suicide attempt of Bobby Sands has cast his land and his cause into another downward spiral of death and despair. There are no heroes in the saga of Bobby Sands.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Saga of Bobby Sands&quot;, Boston Globe, 3 May 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' wrote that&amp;nbsp;&quot;[[Mahatma Gandhi]] used the hunger strike to move his countrymen to abstain from fratricide. Bobby Sands' deliberate slow suicide is intended to precipitate civil war. The former deserved veneration and influence. The latter would be viewed, in a reasonable world, not as a charismatic martyr but as a fanatical suicide, whose regrettable death provides no sufficient occasion for killing others.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Bobby Sands and Mahatma Gandhi&quot;, Chicago Tribune, 28 April 1981&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote that &quot;Britain's prime minister Thatcher is right in refusing to yield political status to Bobby Sands, the Irish Republican Army hunger striker,&quot; but that by appearing &quot;unfeeling and unresponsive&quot; the British Government was giving Sands &quot;the crown of martyrdom.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Britain's Gift to Bobby Sands&quot;, New York Times, 29 April 1981&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' argued that political belief should not exempt activists from criminal law: &quot;Terrorism goes far beyond the expression of political belief. And dealing with it does not allow for compromise as many countries of Western Europe and United States have learned. The bombing of bars, hotels, restaurants, robbing of banks, abductions and killings of prominent figures are all criminal acts and must be dealt with by criminal law.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Death of Bobby Sands&quot;, San Francisco Chronicle, 6 May 1981&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some American critics and journalists suggested that American press coverage was a &quot;melodrama&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Sands' hunger strike and the fate of Ulster&quot; ''Boston Globe'', 1 May 1981, 9&lt;/ref&gt;  One journalist in particular criticised the large pro-IRA Irish-American contingent which &quot;swallow IRA propaganda as if it were [[taffy (candy)|taffy]],&quot; and concluded that IRA &quot;terrorist propaganda triumphs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;IRA brutalities, Terrorist propaganda triumphs&quot; by Edward Langley ''Chicago Tribune'', 9 May 1981, W1-8-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Archbishop John R. Roach, president of the US Catholic bishops, called Sands' death &quot;a useless sacrifice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=DhgVAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=LvsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5359,60041&amp;dq=basil-hume+bobby-sands&amp;hl=en |title=News.Google.com |publisher=News.Google.com |date=1981-05-16 |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Ledger'' of May 5, 1981 under the headline “''To some he was a hero, to others a terrorist''” claims that the hunger strike made Sands &quot;a hero among Irish Republicans or Nationalists seeking the reunion of Protestant-dominated and British-ruled Northern Ireland with the predominantly Catholic Irish Republic to the south.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;news.google.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xOISAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PfsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6963,1623218&amp;dq=basil-hume+bobby-sands&amp;hl=en |title='&amp;#39;The Ledger'&amp;#39;, Tuesday, May 5, 1981 |publisher=News.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Ledger'' cited Sands as telling his friends: “''If I die, God will understand'',&quot; and one of his last messages to them being, “''Tell everyone I’ll see them somewhere, sometime''.” &lt;ref name=&quot;news.google.com&quot;/&gt;

Some political, religious, union and fund-raising institutions chose to honour Sands. The [[International Longshoremen's Association]] in New York announced a 24-hour boycott of British ships.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME-1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/aia/exhibits/0501_hunger/support/prosands.htm |title=NYU |publisher=Nyu.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1,000 people gathered in [[New York City|New York's]] [[St. Patrick's Cathedral, New York|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] to hear [[Cardinal Terence Cooke]] offer a [[Mass of reconciliation]] for Northern Ireland. Irish bars in the city were closed for two hours in mourning.&lt;ref name=&quot;CAIN BERESFORD&quot;/&gt; In [[Hartford, Connecticut]] a memorial was dedicated to Bobby Sands and the other hunger strikers in 1997, the only one of its kind in the United States.

The [[New Jersey General Assembly]], the [[lower house]] of the [[New Jersey Legislature]], voted 34-29 for a resolution honouring his &quot;courage and commitment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CAIN BERESFORD&quot;/&gt;

In 2001, a memorial to Sands and the other hunger strikers was unveiled in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Adams unveils Cuba memorial to Bobby Sands | author = | url = http://archives.tcm.ie/breakingNews/2001/12/18/story33688.asp | publisher = breakingnews.ie | date = 18 December 2001 | accessdate = 2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In [[Palestine|Israel/Palestine]], Palestinian prisoners incarcerated in the Israeli desert prison of Nafha sent a letter, which was smuggled out and reached Belfast in July, 1981, which read;

;United Kingdom
At [[Old Firm]] football matches in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, some [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] fans have been known to sing songs mocking Bobby Sands to taunt fans of [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]]. Rangers fans are mainly [[Protestant]], and predominantly sympathetic to the Unionist and Loyalist community; Celtic fans are traditionally more likely to support the Nationalist and Republican community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Pitch Battles; What can an English public school-type tell us about | author = Tom Shields | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20030223/ai_n12580707 | publisher = [[The Sunday Herald]] | date = 23 February 2003 | accessdate = 2007-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Celtic fans regularly sing the republican song &quot;The Roll of Honour&quot; which commemorates the ten men who died in the 1981 hunger strike, amongst other songs in support of the IRA. Sands is honoured in the line &quot;They stood beside their leader - the gallant Bobby Sands.&quot; Rangers' taunts have since been adopted by the travelling support of other UK clubs, particularly those with strong British ties, as a form of anti-Irish sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;Lash, Scott &amp; Lury, Celia. ''Global Culture Industry: The Mediation of Things'', Polity, 2007, p49. ISBN 0-7456-2482-0&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1981 British Home Championship]] football tournament was cancelled following the refusal of teams from England and Wales to travel to Northern Ireland in the aftermath of his death due to security concerns.

Cardinal Basil Hume, the head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales, condemned Sands, describing the hunger strike as a form of violence. However he noted that this was his personal view. The Roman Catholic Church's official stance was that ministrations should be provided to the hunger strikers who, believing their sacrifice to be for a higher good, were acting in good conscience.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.google.com&quot;/&gt;

====Political impact====
Nine other IRA and [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) members who were involved in the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike died after Sands. On the day of Sands' funeral, Unionist leader [[Ian Paisley]] held a memorial service outside of Belfast city hall to commemorate the victims of the IRA.&lt;ref name=&quot;TIME-1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first= George |last= Russell |title= Shadow Of a Gunman |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,951677-3,00.html |publisher= [[''Time'' (magazine)|Time]] |date= 1981-05-18 |accessdate=2007-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Irish general elections held the same year, two anti H-block candidates won seats on an abstentionist basis.

The media coverage that surrounded the death of Sands resulted in a new surge of IRA activity and an immediate escalation in [[the Troubles]], with the group obtaining many more members and increasing its fund-raising capability. Both nationalists and unionists began to harden their attitudes and move towards political extremes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Flackes&amp;Elliott&quot;&gt;W.D. Flackes and Sydney Elliott, &quot;Northern Ireland: A Political Directory&quot; (Blackstaff Press, Belfast, 1999), at p. 550, notes that at the 1981 District Council elections on 20 May 1981, &quot;the results showed a decline in support for centre parties&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Sands' Westminster seat was taken by his election agent, [[Owen Carron]] standing as '[[Anti H-Block]] Proxy Political Prisoner' with an increased majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nicholas Whyte |url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/cfst.htm |title=Ark Election website |publisher=Ark.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christy Moore]]'s song, &quot;[[The People's Own MP]]&quot;, has been described as an example of a [[Irish rebel music|rebel song]] of the &quot;hero-martyr&quot; genre in which Sands' &quot;intellectual, artistic and moral qualities&quot; are [[eulogy|eulogised]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Boyle&quot;&gt;Boyle, Mark.
