'''Gloria Marie Steinem''' (born March 25, 1934) is an American [[Feminism|feminist]], [[Journalism|journalist]], and social and political [[Activism|activist]] who became nationally recognized as a leader of, and media [[spokeswoman]] for, the [[Second-wave feminism|women's liberation movement]] in the late 1960s and 1970s. A prominent writer and political figure, Steinem has founded many organizations and projects and has been the recipient of many awards and honors. She was a columnist for ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine and co-founded ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine. In 1969, she published an article, ''&quot;[http://jwa.org/feminism/_html/_pdf/JWA067a.pdf After Black Power, Women's Liberation]&quot;'' which, along with her early support of abortion rights, catapulted her to national fame as a feminist leader. In 2005, Steinem worked alongside [[Jane Fonda]] and [[Robin Morgan]] to co-found the [[Women's Media Center]], an organization that works to amplify the voices of women in the media through advocacy, media and leadership training, and the creation of original content.  Steinem currently serves on the board of the organization.  She continues to involve herself in politics and media affairs as a commentator, writer, lecturer, and organizer, campaigning for candidates and reforms and publishing books and articles.

==Early life==
Steinem was born in [[Toledo, Ohio]]. Her mother, Ruth (née Nuneviller), was a [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] of Scottish and German descent, and her father, Leo Steinem, was the son of [[Jews|Jewish]] immigrants from Germany and Poland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwa.org/feminism/_html/JWA067.htm Gloria Steinem], ''Jewish Women's Archive''. Retrieved 2010-06-01&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wargs.com/other/steinem.html |title=Ancestry of Gloria Steinem |publisher=Wargs.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Steinems lived and traveled about in the trailer from which Leo carried out his trade as a traveling antiques dealer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/steinem-gloria |title=Gloria Steinem |publisher=Jwa.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Steinem was three years old, her mother Ruth, then aged 34, had a &quot;nervous breakdown&quot; that left her an invalid, trapped in delusional fantasies that occasionally turned violent. She changed &quot;from an energetic, fun-loving, book-loving&quot; woman into &quot;someone who was afraid to be alone, who could not hang on to reality long enough to hold a job, and who could rarely concentrate enough to read a book.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinem|first=Gloria|title=Outrageous Acts and Everyday Rebellions|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth spent long periods in and out of sanatoriums for the mentally disabled. Steinem was only ten years old when her parents finally separated in 1944. Her father went to [[California]] to find work, while she and her mother continued to live together in Toledo.

While her parents divorced as a result of her mother's illness, it was not a result of chauvinism on the father's part, and Steinem claims to have &quot;understood and never blamed him for the breakup.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Marcello, Patricia. Gloria Steinem: A Biography. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004. p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the impact of these events had a formative effect on her personality: while her father, a traveling salesman, had never provided much financial stability to the family, his exit aggravated their situation. Steinem interpreted her mother's inability to hold on to a job as evidence of general hostility towards working women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcello, Patricia 2004&quot;&gt;Marcello, Patricia. Gloria Steinem: A Biography. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; She also interpreted the general apathy of doctors towards her mother as emerging from a similar anti-woman animus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcello, Patricia 2004&quot;/&gt; Years later, Steinem described her mother's experiences as having been pivotal to her understanding of social injustices. These perspectives convinced Steinem that women lacked [[social equality|social]] and [[egalitarianism|political equality]].&lt;ref name=&quot;OutrageousActs&quot;&gt;{{Cite book

Steinem attended [[Waite High School (Toledo, Ohio)|Waite High School]] in Toledo and Western High School in [[Washington, D.C.]], from which she graduated. She then attended [[Smith College]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BiographyCom&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In the late 1950s, Steinem spent two years in India as a Chester Bowles Asian Fellow.&lt;ref name=Bird&gt;{{cite book|last=Bird|first=Kai|title=The Chairman: John J.

==Journalism career==

''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine features editor [[Clay Felker]] gave [[freelance]] writer Steinem what she later called her first &quot;serious assignment,&quot; regarding [[contraception]]; he didn't like her first draft and had her re-write the article.&lt;ref name=&quot;la times&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first= Dennis|last= Mclellan|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Clay Felker, 82; editor of New York magazine led New Journalism charge  |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jul/02/local/me-felker2 |quote=|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' |date=July 2, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her resulting 1962 article&lt;ref name=&quot;la times&quot;/&gt; about the way in which women are forced to choose between a career and marriage preceded [[Betty Friedan]]'s book ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'' by one year.

In 1963, working on an article for [[Huntington Hartford]]'s ''Show'' magazine, Steinem was employed as a [[Playboy Bunny]] at the New York [[Playboy Club]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Steinem's experience as a Playboy Bunny was later made into the 1985 movie ''[[A Bunny's Tale]]''. For a brief period after the article was published, Steinem was unable to land other assignments, but that situation did not last long;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2009/06/15/midmorning1/ |title=Minnesota Public Radio interview |publisher=Minnesota.publicradio.org |date=2009-06-15 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; indeed, Steinem landed a job at Felker's newly founded ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine in 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;la times&quot;/&gt;

In the interim, in 1965 she wrote for NBC-TV's weekly satirical revue, ''[[That Was The Week That Was]] (TW3),'' contributing a regular segment entitled 'Surrealism in Everyday Life.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Patricia Cronin Marcello: Gloria Steinem: A Biography (Greenwood Publishing, 2004), p. xiv. Accessed via Google Books &lt;http://books.google.com/books?id=WcyRSrnAXaEC&amp;pg=PR14&gt;, March 18, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969 she covered an abortion speak-out for ''[[New York Magazine]]'', which was held in a church basement in the Village. &lt;ref name=&quot;nymag1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/features/2438/ |title=30th Anniversary Issue / Gloria Steinem: First Feminist |publisher=Nymag.com |date=1998-04-06 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nymag2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Pogrebin |first=Abigail |url=http://nymag.com/news/features/ms-magazine-2011-11/ |title=An Oral History of 'Ms.' Magazine |publisher=Nymag.com |date=2011-10-30 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinem had had an abortion herself in London at the age of 22. &lt;ref name=&quot;guardian1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Rachel Cooke |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2011/nov/13/gloria-steinem-interview-feminism-abortion |title=Gloria Steinem: 'I think we need to get much angrier' |publisher=Guardian |date=2011-11-13 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She felt what she called a &quot;big click&quot; at the speak-out, and later said she didn't &quot;begin my life as an active feminist&quot; until that day. &lt;ref name=&quot;nymag2&quot;/&gt; As she recalled, &quot;It [abortion] is supposed to make us a bad person. But I must say, I never felt that. I used to sit and try and figure out how old the child would be, trying to make myself feel guilty. But I never could! I think the person who said: 'Honey, if men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament' was right. Speaking for myself, I knew it was the first time I had taken responsibility for my own life. I wasn't going to let things happen to me. I was going to direct my life, and therefore it felt positive. But still, I didn't tell anyone. Because I knew that out there it wasn't [positive].&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;guardian1&quot;/&gt; &quot;In later years, if I’m remembered at all it will be for inventing a phrase like 'reproductive freedom' . . . as a phrase it includes the freedom to have children or not to. So it makes it possible for us to make a coalition.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, Lynn &amp; Moore, Gaylen, “Particular Passions: Talks With Women Who Shaped Our Times”. Clarkson Potter, 1981. pp. 166  &lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, she co-founded the feminist-themed [[Ms. magazine|''Ms.'' magazine]]. It began as a special edition of ''New York'', and Felker funded the first issue.&lt;ref name=&quot;la times&quot;/&gt; When the first regular issue hit the news stands in July 1972, its 300,000 &quot;one-shot&quot; test copies sold out nationwide in three days. She even labeled it Spring Issue 1972 for that sole reason. It generated an astonishing 26,000 subscription orders and over 20,000 reader letters within weeks. Steinem would continue to write for the magazine until it was sold in 1987. The magazine changed hands again in 2001, to the [[Feminist Majority Foundation]]; Steinem remains on the masthead as one of six founding editors and serves on the advisory board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msmagazine.com/about.asp |title=Ms. Magazine History |publisher=Msmagazine.com |date=2001-12-31 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political awakening and activism==
Steinem actively campaigned for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], in addition to other laws and social reforms that promoted equality between women and men, helping to strike down many long-standing sex discriminatory laws, such as those that gave men superior rights in marriage and denied women equal economic opportunities. She testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in favor of the Equal Rights Amendment in 1970. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bawwNGkEWAcC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;lpg=PA240&amp;dq=steinem+equal+rights+amendment+%22before+the+senate%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=_ONPZNDoXq&amp;sig=iat6-CHO70H91q7hUriWTPmrOmo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6MDHT-PzGuP26AGW783ODw&amp;ved=0CFUQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=steinem%20equal%20rights%20amendment%20%22before%20the%20senate%22&amp;f=false |title=Modern America: A Documentary History of the Nation Since 1945 - Gary Donaldson |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2007-03-30 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu/steinem-testimony-speech-text/ |title=Steinem, &quot;Testimony...,&quot; Speech Text |publisher=Voicesofdemocracy.umd.edu |date=1970-05-06 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also founded and co-founded many groups, including the [[Women's Action Alliance]], on which she served as chair of the board throughout the 1970s; the NWPC, the [[Coalition of Labor Union Women]]; the [[Ms. Foundation for Women]]; [[Choice USA]]; and [[Women's Media Center]]. From 1971 to 1975, she served on the Advisory Board of the [[Westbeth Playwrights Feminist Collective]]—one of the first NYC based feminist theater groups.

In 1968, she signed the “Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;“Writers and Editors War Tax Protest” January 30, 1968 ''New York Post''&lt;/ref&gt;

After conducting a series of celebrity interviews, Steinem eventually got a political assignment covering [[George McGovern]]'s presidential campaign. In 1969, she published an article, ''&quot;After Black Power, Women's Liberation&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Steinem brought other notable feminists to the fore and toured the country  with lawyer [[Florynce Kennedy|Florynce Rae &quot;Flo&quot; Kennedy]], child-welfare pioneer [[Dorothy Pitman Hughes]], and National Black Feminist Organization founder [[Margaret Sloan-Hunter]].&lt;ref name=outrageous&gt;{{cite book|last=Steinem|first=Gloria|title=Outrageous acts and everyday rebellions|year=1995|publisher=Holt|location=New York, NY|isbn=0805042024|pages=5-6|url=http://www.amazon.com/Outrageous-Acts-Everyday-Rebellions-Edition/dp/0805042024/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1350146169&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=gloria+steinem+outrageous+acts|edition=2. ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1970 Gloria Steinem established herself as a leader of the Women's Movement with her impassioned Senate testimony in favor of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] and her essay on a utopia of equality, ''&quot;What It Would Be Like If Women Win&quot;'', in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.  While Steinem would clash with both the older generation of women's rights leaders, most prominently [[Betty Friedan]], as well as the younger, more militant Women's Liberation activists, she would gain a large, diverse, and multi-partisan following and become, alongside Friedan, the Women's Rights Movement's most prominent and influential spokesperson and leader.  In 1970 she led the [[New York City]] march of the nation-wide [[Women's Strike for Equality]] alongside Friedan and then-Congressional candidate [[Bella Abzug]]. As the postergirl of the Feminist Movement, Steinem frequently appeared on news shows, television talk shows and specials, and on the covers of newspapers and magazines such as ''[[Newsweek]]'', ''Time'', ''[[McCall's]]'', ''[[People (magazine)|People]]'', ''[[New Woman]]'', ''Ms.'', and ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]''.

On July 10, 1971, Steinem, along with other feminist leaders (including [[Betty_Friedan|Betty Friedan]], [[Fannie Lou Hamer]], [[Myrlie Evers-Williams|Myrlie Evers]], and several U.S. Representatives, including [[Shirley Chisholm]] and Bella Abzug) founded the [[National Women's Political Caucus]] (NWPC). An influential co-convener of the Caucus, she delivered her memorable &quot;[[Address to the Women of America]]&quot;:
{{bquote|This is no simple reform. It really is a revolution. Sex and race because they are easy and visible differences have been the primary ways of organizing human beings into superior and inferior groups and into the cheap labor on which this system still depends. We are talking about a society in which there will be no roles other than those chosen or those earned. We are really talking about humanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The next year Steinem became the founding editor and publisher of ''[[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]]'' magazine, which speedily became a success, bringing feminist issues to the forefront of society and the media, quickly becoming the movement's most influential publication. In 1972, she also played a prominent role at the Democratic National Convention where she supported [[Shirley Chisholm]]'s candidacy.  That year Steinem and the NWPC had successfully organized bipartisan efforts to increase the representation of women at both major party conventions. In the early 1970s Steinem became the first woman to address the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]].

In May 1975, [[Redstockings]], a radical feminist group, raised the question of whether Steinem had continuing ties with the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.namebase.org/steinem.html |title=Gloria Steinem and the CIA |author= |date= |work=[[NameBase]] |publisher= |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/64k9908KK |archivedate=2012-01-16 |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.namebase.org/foia/festival.html |title=Gloria Steinem Spies on Students for the CIA |author= |date= |work=[[NameBase]] |publisher= |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/64k6o2GvT |archivedate=2012-01-16 |accessdate=2012-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though she admitted to having worked for a CIA-financed foundation in the late 1950s and early 1960s, Steinem denied any continuing involvement.&lt;ref&gt;Harrington, Stephanie (July 4, 1976). [http://www.nytimes.com/1976/07/04/books/friedan-changed.html/ &quot;It Changed My Life&quot;]. ''The New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Steinem was also a member of [[Democratic Socialists of America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1984 Steinem was arrested along with a number of members of Congress and civil rights activists for disorderly conduct outside the [[South Africa]]n embassy while protesting against the South African [[apartheid]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=97YfAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2393,5208721|title=Arrested at embassy|date=20 December 1984|work=Gadsden Times|page=A10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinem co-founded the [[Coalition of Labor Union Women]] in 1974, and participated in the [[National Conference of Women]] in [[Houston, Texas]], in 1977. She became ''Ms.'' magazine's consulting editor when it was revived in 1991, and she was inducted into the [[National Women's Hall of Fame]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://greatwomen.org/women.php?action=viewone&amp;id=150 ''Women's of the Hall''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinem played a variety of roles within the [[Women's Action Alliance]], whose initial mission was &quot;to stimulate and assist women at the local level to organize around specific action projects aimed at eliminating concrete manifestations of economic and social discrimination.&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;asteria.fivecolleges.edu&quot;&gt;http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/sophiasmith/mnsss76_bioghist.html&lt;/ref&gt; She chaired the board from 1971-1978.

Steinem was active in working for civil rights for African Americans, Hispanics, and other minorities, working alongside civil rights leaders like Coretta Scott King and [[César Chávez]], and took a public stance in opposition to the [[Vietnam War]] and in favor of gay rights.

&quot;I think the fact that I’ve become a symbol for the women’s movement is somewhat accidental. A woman member of Congress, for example, might be identified as a member of Congress; it doesn’t mean she’s any less of a feminist but she’s identified by her nearest male analog. Well, I don’t have a male analog so the press has to identify me with the movement. I suppose I could be referred to as a journalist, but because Ms. is part of a movement and not just a typical magazine, I’m more likely to be identified with the movement.

In later years, Steinem became an outspoken supporter of [[animal rights]], writing letters to the National Institutes of Health Office of Research on Women’s Health urging the office director to end the &quot;cruelty, fraud, and waste&quot; of NIH-funded experiments on animals purportedly conducted in the name of advancing women’s health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.femfatalities.com/feat-steinem.asp |title=Gloria Steinem to NIH: Stop 'Triple Injustice' of 'Cruelty, Fraud, and Waste'! |publisher=Femfatalities.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also became involved in international women's issues such as the campaign against female [[Female genital mutilation|genital mutilation]] in Eastern countries and [[human trafficking]].

Contrary to popular belief, Steinem did not coin the feminist slogan &quot;A woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle.&quot; The phrase is actually attributable to [[Irina Dunn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, she once dated publisher and real-estate developer [[Mortimer Zuckerman]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wrmea.org/component/content/article/253/4734-mortimer-zuckerman-two-voices-but-both-talking-about-himself.html |title=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs |publisher=Wrmea.org |date=2003-06-01 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
In the 1980s and 1990s, Steinem had to deal with a number of personal setbacks, including the diagnosis of [[breast cancer]] in 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1995/09/24/RV65259.DTL | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | title=Making Ms.Story / The biography of Gloria Steinem, a woman of controversy and contradictions | first=Patricia | last=Holt | date=September 22, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[trigeminal neuralgia]] in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;Mother Jones. [http://www.motherjones.com/news/qa/1995/11/gorney.html ''Gloria'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Steinem co-founded [[Choice USA]], a non-profit organization that mobilizes and provides ongoing support to a younger generation that lobbies for reproductive choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.choiceusa.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=77&amp;Itemid=2 |title=Choice USA |publisher=Choice USA |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her book ''Revolution from Within: A Book of Self-Esteem'' published that year was criticized for misrepresenting statistics regarding the incidence and lethality of [[anorexia nervosa]].

&lt;/ref&gt;

At the outset of the [[Gulf War]], Steinem, along with prominent feminists [[Robin Morgan]] and [[Kate Millett]], publicly opposed an incursion into the Middle East and asserted that ostensible goal of &quot;defending democracy&quot; was a pretense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

According to two [[Frontline (US TV series)|''Frontline'']] features (aired in 1995) and ''Ms.'' magazine, Steinem became an advocate for children she believed had been sexually abused by caretakers in day care centers (such as the [[McMartin preschool]] case).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In a 1998 press interview, Steinem weighed in on the Clinton impeachment hearings; when asked whether President [[Bill Clinton]] should be impeached for lying under oath, she was quoted as saying, &quot;Clinton should be censured for lying under oath about Lewinsky in the Paula Jones deposition, perhaps also for stupidity in answering at all.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.feminist.org/news/newsbyte/uswirestory.asp?id=852 |title=Steinem Wants Clinton Censured, Not Impeached |accessdate =2007-06-08 | publisher =Reuters: September 28, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same year, Steinem defended Clinton against allegations of sexual impropriety that had been made by White House volunteer [[Kathleen Willey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.reason.com/news/show/30734.html |title=Groping towards sanity | last = Young | first = Cathy | date = September 1998| publisher = Reason }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 3, 2000, at age 66, Steinem married [[David Bale]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BiographyCom&quot;/&gt; father of actor [[Christian Bale]]. The wedding was performed at the home of her friend [[Wilma Mankiller]], the first female [[Principal Chiefs of the Cherokee|Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feminist icon Gloria Steinem first-time bride at 66|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/09/05/steinem.marriage.ap/index.html|publisher=CNN.com|date=September 5, 2000|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070917071020/http://archives.cnn.com/2000/US/09/05/steinem.marriage.ap/index.html|archivedate=2007-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinem and Bale were married for only three years before he died of brain [[lymphoma]] on December 30, 2003, at age 62.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last = von Zeilbauer| first = Paul| title = David Bale, 62, Activist and Businessman| publisher = The New York Times| date = January 1, 2004| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/01/us/david-bale-62-activist-and-businessman.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steinem was named the [[American Humanist Association]]'s 2012 Humanist of the Year for her activism in feminism and [[LGBT]] rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/teen-atheist-who-brought-down-prayer-banner-feminist-gloria-steinem-to-be-honored-at-atheist-conference|title=Teen Atheist who Brought Down Prayer Banner &amp; Feminist Gloria Steinem to be Honored at Atheist Conference|publisher=The Blaze| date= May 30, 2012| accessdate= Jun 14, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Involvement in political campaigns==
Steinem has been an influential figure in politics since the 1960s. Her involvement in presidential campaigns stretches back to her support of [[Adlai Stevenson II|Adlai Stevenson]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref&gt;Lazo, Caroine. ''Gloria Steinem: Feminist Extraordinaire.'' New York: Lerner Publications, 1998. pp. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1968 election===
A proponent of civil rights and fierce [[Opposition to the Vietnam War|critic of the Vietnam War]], Steinem was initially drawn to Senator [[Eugene McCarthy]] because of his &quot;admirable record&quot; on those issues. But in meeting and hearing him speak, she found him &quot;cautious, uninspired, and dry.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OutrageousActs&quot;/&gt;{{rp|87}} Interviewing him for '' New York Magazine'', she called his answers a &quot;fiasco,&quot; noting that he gave &quot;not one spontaneous reply.&quot; As the campaign progressed, Steinem became baffled at &quot;personally vicious&quot; attacks that McCarthy leveled against his primary opponent [[Robert Kennedy]], even as &quot;his real opponent, [[Hubert Humphrey]], went free.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OutrageousActs&quot;/&gt;{{rp|88}}

On a late-night radio show, Steinem garnered attention for declaring, &quot;[[George McGovern]] is the real Eugene McCarthy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Miroff, Bruce. ''The Liberals' Moment: The McGovern Insurgency and the Identity Crisis of the Democratic Party''. University Press of Kansas, 2007. pp. 206&lt;/ref&gt; Steinem had met McGovern in 1963 on the way to an economic conference organized by [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] and had been impressed by his unpretentious manner and genuine consideration of her opinions. Five years later in 1968, Steinem was chosen to pitch the arguments to McGovern as to why he should enter the presidential race that year. He agreed, and Steinem &quot;consecutively or simultaneously served as pamphlet writer, advance &quot;man&quot;, fund raiser, lobbyist of delegates, errand runner, and press secretary.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OutrageousActs&quot;/&gt;{{rp|95}}

McGovern lost the nomination in the infamous [[1968 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Chicago]]. Steinem gave McGovern credit for standing on the platform with Humphrey in a show of unity after Humphrey had clinched the nomination, whereas McCarthy refused the same gesture. She later wrote of her astonishment at Humphrey's &quot;refusal even to suggest to [[Mayor of Chicago|Chicago Mayor]] [[Richard J. Daley]] that he control the [[1968 Democratic National Convention protest activity|rampaging police]] and the bloodshed in the streets.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OutrageousActs&quot;/&gt;{{rp|96}}

===1972 election===
By the 1972 election, the Women's Movement was rapidly expanding its political power.  Steinem, along with [[National Organization for Women]] founder [[Betty Friedan]], Congresswomen [[Shirley Chisholm]] and [[Bella Abzug]], and others, had founded the [[National Women's Political Caucus]] in July 1971.&lt;ref&gt;Miroff. pp. 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Steinem attempted to run as a national delegate in support of Chisholm's presidential campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman&quot;&gt;{{cite news
|title=Shirley Chisholm's 1972 Presidential Campaign

|date=February 2005
|url=http://www.uic.edu/orgs/cwluherstory/jofreeman/polhistory/chisholm.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, Steinem was reluctant to re-join the McGovern campaign. Though she had brought in McGovern's single largest campaign contributor in 1968, she &quot;''still'' had been treated like a frivolous pariah by much of McGovern's campaign staff.&quot; In April 1972, Steinem remarked that he &quot;still doesn't understand the Women's Movement.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OutrageousActs&quot;/&gt;{{rp|114}}

McGovern ultimately excised the abortion issue from the party's platform. (Recent publications show McGovern was deeply conflicted on the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Miroff. pp. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;) Actress and activist [[Shirley MacLaine]], though privately supporting abortion rights, urged the delegates to vote against the plank.  Steinem later wrote this description of the events:
{{cquote|The consensus of the meeting of women delegates held by the caucus had been to fight for the minority plank on reproductive freedom; indeed our vote had supported the plank nine to one.  So fight we did, with three women delegates speaking eloquently in its favor as a constitutional right.  One male Right-to-Life zealot spoke against, and Shirley MacLaine also was an opposition speaker, on the grounds that this ''was'' a fundamental right but didn't belong in the platform.
We made a good showing.  Clearly we would have won if McGovern's forces had left their delegates uninstructed and thus able to vote their consciences.&lt;ref name=&quot;OutrageousActs&quot;/&gt;{{rp|100-110}}}}

[[Germaine Greer]] flatly contradicted Steinem's account. Having recently gained public notoriety for her feminist manifesto ''[[The Female Eunuch]]'' and sparring with [[Norman Mailer]], Greer was commissioned to cover the convention for ''[[Harper's Magazine]].'' Greer criticized Steinem's &quot;controlled jubilation&quot; that 38% of the delegates were women, ignoring the fact that &quot;many delegations had merely stacked themselves with token females... The McGovern machine had already pulled the rug out from under them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greer_Harpers&quot;&gt;Harper's Magazine October 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

Greer leveled her most searing critique on Steinem for her capitulation on abortion rights.  Greer reported, &quot;Jacqui Ceballos called from the crowd to demand abortion rights on the Democratic platform, but Bella [Abzug] and Gloria stared glassily out into the room,&quot; thus killing the abortion rights platform.  Greer asks, &quot;Why had Bella and Gloria not helped Jacqui to nail him on abortion? What reticence, what loserism had afflicted them?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greer_Harpers&quot;/&gt; Steinem later recalled that the 1972 Convention was the only time Greer and Steinem ever met.&lt;ref&gt;Wow, April 16, 2009.

The cover of Harper's that month read, &quot;Womanlike, they did not want to get tough with their man, and so, womanlike, they got screwed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://harpers.org/archive/1972 |title=Harper's Magazine Archives |publisher=Harpers.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004 election===
In the run-up to the 2004 election, Steinem voiced fierce criticism of the Bush administration, asserting, &quot;There has never been an administration that has been more hostile to women’s equality, to reproductive freedom as a fundamental human right, and has acted on that hostility.&quot; She went on to claim, &quot;If he is elected in 2004, abortion will be criminalized in this country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buzzflash.com/interviews/04/02/int04008.html |title=Buzzflash Interview |publisher=Buzzflash.com |date=2004-02-05 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At a [[Planned Parenthood]] event in [[Boston]], Steinem declared Bush &quot;a danger to health and safety,&quot; citing his antagonism to the [[Clean Water Act]], reproductive freedom, sex education, and [[AIDS]] relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2004/7/26/feminist_pioneer_gloria_steinem_bush_is |title=Feminist Pioneer Gloria Steinem: &quot;Bush is a Danger to Our Health and Safety&quot; |publisher=Democracynow.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008 election===
[[File:Gloria Steinem 2008 cropped.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Steinem in November 2008]]
Steinem was an active participant in the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential campaign]]. She praised both the Democratic front-runners, commenting,
{{bquote|Both Senators Clinton and Obama are [[civil rights]] advocates, [[feminists]], [[environmentalists]], and critics of the [[war in Iraq]].... Both have resisted pandering to the right, something that sets them apart from any [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate, including [[John McCain]]. Both have Washington and foreign policy experience; [[George W. Bush]] did not when he first ran for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/02/07/opinion/07steinem.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin|title=Right Candidates, Wrong Question|last=Steinem|first=Gloria|date=February 7, 2007|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=2009-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nevertheless, Steinem endorsed Senator Clinton, citing her broader experience, saying that the nation was in such bad shape it might require two terms of Clinton and two of Obama to fix it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

She made headlines for a ''[[New York Times]]'' op-ed in which she cited [[gender]] and not [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] &quot;probably the most restricting force in American life&quot;. She elaborated, &quot;Black men were given the vote a half-century before women of any race were allowed to mark a ballot, and generally have ascended to positions of power, from the military to the boardroom, before any women.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Steinem, Gloria. New York Times: [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/08/opinion/08steinem.html?_r=1/ ''Women are Never the Front-runners'']&lt;/ref&gt; This was attacked, however, from critics saying that white women were given the vote unabridged in 1920, whereas many blacks, female or male, could not vote until the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], and some were lynched for trying, and that many white women advanced in the business and political worlds before black women and men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=40811 |publisher=Inter Press News |accessdate=March 16, 2011 |date=January 16, 2008 |first=Ali |last=Gharib |title=Democratic Race Sheds Issues for Identities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinem again drew attention for, according to the ''[[New York Observer]]'', seeming &quot;to denigrate the importance of John McCain’s time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam&quot;. Steinem's broader argument &quot;was that the media and the political world are too admiring of militarism in all its guises.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The New York Observer. [http://www.observer.com/2008/stumping-clinton-steinem-says-mccains-p-o-w-cred-overrated/ ''Stumping for Clinton, Steinem Says McCain's POW Cred Is Overrated'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Steinem was vocal in criticising the media treatment of the Clinton campaign as sexist. Following McCain's selection of [[Sarah Palin]] as his running mate, Steinem penned an op-ed in which she labeled Palin an &quot;unqualified woman&quot; who &quot;opposes everything most other women want and need.&quot; Steinem described her nomination speech as &quot;divisive and deceptive&quot;, called for a more inclusive Republican Party and concluded that Palin resembled &quot;[[Phyllis Schlafly]], only younger.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/opinion/la-oe-steinem4-2008sep04,0,1290251.story |title=&quot;Palin: wrong woman, wrong message&quot; |publisher=Latimes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feminist positions==
Steinem's social and political views overlap into multiple schools of feminism.  This problem is compounded by the evolution of her views over five decades of activism.  Although most frequently considered a [[liberal feminist]], Steinem has repeatedly characterized herself as a [[radical feminist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feminist.com/resources/artspeech/interviews/gloria.htm/ |title=Marianne Schnall Interview |publisher=Feminist.com |date=1995-04-03 |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More importantly, she has repudiated categorization within feminism as &quot;nonconstructive to specific problems&quot;: &quot;I've turned up in every category. So it makes it harder for me to take the divisions with great seriousness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Interviewed By Cynthia Gorney: [http://www.motherjones.com/news/qa/1995/11/gorney.html/ ''Mother Jones'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, on concrete issues, Steinem has staked firm positions.

===Abortion===
Steinem is a staunch advocate of ''reproductive freedom'', a term she herself coined and helped popularize. In 1969 she covered an abortion speak-out for ''[[New York Magazine]]'', which was held in a church basement in the Village. &lt;ref name=&quot;nymag1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nymag2&quot;/&gt; She had had an abortion herself in London at the age of 22. &lt;ref name=&quot;guardian1&quot;/&gt; She felt what she called a &quot;big click&quot; at the speak-out, and later said she didn't &quot;begin my life as an active feminist&quot; until that day. &lt;ref name=&quot;nymag2&quot;/&gt; As she recalled,
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It [abortion] is supposed to make us a bad person. But I must say, I never felt that. I used to sit and try and figure out how old the child would be, trying to make myself feel guilty. But I never could! I think the person who said: 'Honey, if men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament' was right. Speaking for myself, I knew it was the first time I had taken responsibility for my own life. I wasn't going to let things happen to me. I was going to direct my life, and therefore it felt positive. But still, I didn't tell anyone. Because I knew that out there it wasn't [positive].&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;guardian1&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She credited the ''[[Webster v. Reproductive Health Services]]'' hearings she covered&lt;ref&gt;

In 2005, Steinem appeared in the documentary film ''I Had an Abortion'' by Jennifer Baumgardner and Gillian Aldrich.  In the film, Steinem described the [[abortion]] she had as a young woman in London, where she lived briefly before studying in India.  In the documentary ''My Feminism'', Steinem characterized her abortion as a &quot;pivotal and constructive experience.&quot;

===Pornography===
Along with [[Susan Brownmiller]] and [[Catharine MacKinnon]], Steinem has been a vehement critic of [[pornography]], which she distinguishes from [[erotica]]: &quot;Erotica is as different from pornography as love is from rape, as dignity is from humiliation, as partnership is from slavery, as pleasure is from pain.&quot; Steinem's argument hinges on the distinction between reciprocity versus domination.  She writes, &quot;Blatant or subtle, pornography involves no equal power or mutuality.  In fact, much of the tension and drama comes from the clear idea that one person is dominating the other.&quot;  On the issue of same-sex pornography, Steinem asserts, &quot;Whatever the gender of the participants, all pornography including male-male gay pornography is an imitation of the male-female, conqueror-victim paradigm, and almost all of it actually portrays or implies enslaved women and master.&quot;  Steinem also cites &quot;[[snuff films]]&quot; as a serious threat to women.&lt;ref name=&quot;OutrageousActs&quot;/&gt;{{rp|219}}&lt;ref&gt;''Erotica and Pornography: A Clear and Present Difference''. Ms. Magazine. November 1978, pp. 53. &amp; ''Pornography--Not Sex but the Obscene Use of Power.''  Ms. Magazine. August 1977, 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genital mutilation===
Steinem wrote the definitive article on [[female genital mutilation]] that brought the practice into the American public's consciousness.&lt;ref name=&quot;OutrageousActs&quot;/&gt;{{rp|292}}&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The International Crime of Female Genital Mutilation.&quot; ''Ms. Magazine'', March 1979, pp. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;  The article reports on the &quot;75 million women suffering with the results of genital mutilation.&quot;  According to Steinem, &quot;The real reasons for genital mutilation can only be understood in the context of the [[patriarchy]]: men must control women's bodies as the means of production, and thus repress the independent power of women's sexuality.&quot; Steinem's article contains the basic arguments that would be developed by philosopher [[Martha Nussbaum]].&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Martha C. ''Sex &amp; Social Justice.'' New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. pp. 118-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

On male [[circumcision]], she commented, &quot;These patriarchal controls limit men’s sexuality too... That’s why men are asked symbolically to submit the sexual part of themselves and their sons to patriarchal authority, which seems to be the origin of male circumcision, a practice that, even as advocates admit, is medically unnecessary 90% of the time. Speaking for myself, I stand with many brothers in eliminating that practice too.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noharmm.org/FGCsay.htm |title=What have FGC opponents said publicly about male genital cutting? |publisher=Noharmm.org |date= |accessdate=2012-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Same-sex marriage===
Steinem has expressed support for [[same-sex marriage]], stating &quot;The idea that sexuality is only okay if it ends in reproduction oppresses women—whose health depends on separating sexuality from reproduction—as well as gay men and lesbians.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Transsexualism===
Steinem has questioned [[transsexualism]].  In 1977, she expressed disapproval that the heavily publicized sex-role change of tennis player [[Renée Richards]] had been characterized as &quot;a frightening instance of what feminism could lead to&quot; or as &quot;living proof that feminism isn't necessary.&quot;  Steinem wrote, &quot;At a minimum, it was a diversion from the widespread problems of sexual inequality.&quot;  She writes that, while she supports the right of individuals to identify as they choose, she claims that, in many cases, transsexuals &quot;surgically mutilate their own bodies&quot; in order to conform to a gender role that is inexorably tied to physical body parts.  She concludes that &quot;feminists are right to feel uncomfortable about the need for and uses of transsexualism.&quot;  The article concluded with what became one of Steinem's most famous quotes: &quot;If the shoe doesn't fit, must we change the foot?&quot; Although clearly meant in the context of transsexuality, the quote is frequently mistaken as a general statement about feminism.&lt;ref name=&quot;OutrageousActs&quot;/&gt;{{rp|206-210}}

===Feminist theory===
Steinem has repeatedly voiced her disapproval of the [[obscurantism]] and abstractions prevalent in [[feminist theory|feminist academic theorizing]]. She said, &quot;Nobody cares about feminist academic writing. That's careerism. These poor women in academia have to talk this silly language that nobody can understand in order to be accepted...But I recognize the fact that we have this ridiculous system of tenure, that the whole thrust of academia is one that values education, in my opinion, in inverse ratio to its usefulness—and what you write in inverse relationship to its understandability.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mother Jones. [http://www.motherjones.com/news/qa/1995/11/gorney.html/ &quot;Gloria Steinem&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Steinem later singled out deconstructionists like [[Judith Butler]] for criticism: &quot;I always wanted to put a sign up on the road to Yale saying, 'Beware: Deconstruction Ahead'. Academics are forced to write in language no one can understand so that they get tenure. They have to say 'discourse', not 'talk'. Knowledge that is not accessible is not helpful. It becomes aerialised.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
