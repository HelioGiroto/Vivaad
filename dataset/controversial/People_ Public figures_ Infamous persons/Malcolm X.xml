'''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|ˈ|m|æ|l|k|əm|_|ˈ|ɛ|k|s}}; May&amp;nbsp;19, 1925{{spaced ndash}}February&amp;nbsp;21, 1965), born '''Malcolm Little''' and also known as '''El-Hajj Malik El-Shabazz'''&lt;ref&gt;This name includes the [[honorific]] [[El-Hajj]], given on completion of the [[Hajj]] to [[Mecca]]. {{cite book |title=Islam: A Very Short Introduction |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Malise Ruthven |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-285389-9 |page=147 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-ar|الحاجّ مالك الشباز}}), was an [[African-American]] Muslim minister and human rights activist. To his admirers, he was a courageous advocate for the rights of blacks, a man who indicted white America in the harshest terms for its crimes against black Americans. Detractors accused him of preaching racism, [[black supremacy]], and violence. He has been called one of the greatest and most influential African Americans in history.

Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's father died—killed by [[white supremacists]], it was rumored—when he was young, and at least one of his uncles was [[lynched]]. When he was thirteen, his mother was placed in a mental hospital, and he was placed in a series of foster homes. In 1946, at age 20, he went to prison for breaking and entering.

In prison Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X became a member of the [[Nation of Islam]] and after his parole in 1952 he quickly rose to become one of its leaders. For a dozen years Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was the public face of the controversial group, but disillusionment with Nation of Islam head [[Elijah Muhammad]] led him to leave&lt;!--clarify--&gt; the Nation in March 1964. After a period of travel in Africa and the Middle East, he returned to the United States, where he founded [[Muslim Mosque, Inc.]] and the [[Organization of Afro-American Unity]]. In February 1965, less than a year after leaving the Nation of Islam, he was assassinated by three members of the group.

Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's expressed beliefs changed substantially over time. As a spokesman for the Nation of Islam he taught [[black supremacy]] and advocated [[Black separatism|separation of black and white Americans]]—in contrast to the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|civil rights movement]]'s emphasis on [[Racial integration|integration]]. After breaking with the Nation of Islam in 1964—saying of his association with it, &quot;I was a zombie then ... pointed in a certain direction and told to march&quot;—and becoming a [[Sunni Muslim]], he disavowed racism and expressed willingness to work with civil rights leaders, though still emphasizing black self-determination and self-defense.

==Early years==
Malcolm Little was born May&amp;nbsp;19, 1925, in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], Nebraska, the fourth of seven children of Grenada-born Louise Little (née Norton) and Georgia-born Earl Little. Earl was an outspoken [[Baptist]] [[Laity|lay]] speaker, admirer of [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-African]] activist [[Marcus Garvey]], and local leader of the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]] (UNIA)
who inculcated self-reliance and [[black pride]] in his children.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, p.&amp;nbsp;7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.&amp;nbsp;2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;
Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X later said that violence by whites killed three of his father's brothers, including one who was [[Lynching in the United States|lynched]].&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''Autobiography'', pp.&amp;nbsp;3–4. There have been many editions of ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X''. Page numbers cited in the notes refer to the One World trade paperback edition (1992).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1930 census Little.gif|thumb|left|1930 United States Census return listing Earl Little family (lines 59ff.)|alt=A ledger with names, ages, and other personal information]]
Because of [[Ku Klux Klan]] threats—Earl Little's UNIA activities were &quot;spreading trouble&quot;&lt;ref&gt;DeCaro, pp.&amp;nbsp;43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;—the family relocated in 1926 to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], and shortly thereafter to [[Lansing, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt;
In Lansing the family was frequently harassed by the [[Black Legion (political movement)|Black Legion]], a [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] group; when the family home burned in 1929, Earl Little accused the Black Legion.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, p.&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Little was six, his father was killed by a streetcar.
Though police said the dying man declared he had slipped,&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;12.&lt;/ref&gt;
at the funeral someone told one of the children their father had been pushed onto the tracks;
some blacks suspected the Black Legion.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', p.&amp;nbsp;29.&lt;/ref&gt;
After a dispute with creditors, a life insurance benefit
(nominally $1,000—about $15,000 in 2010 dollars)
was paid to Louise Little in payments of $18 per month;&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', p.&amp;nbsp;32. Inflation information in source.&lt;/ref&gt; the issuer of another, larger policy refused to pay, claiming suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, p.&amp;nbsp;10.&lt;/ref&gt;
To make ends meet Louise Little rented out part of her garden, and her sons hunted game.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', p.&amp;nbsp;32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 a man Louise Little had been dating—marriage had seemed a possibility—vanished from her life when she became pregnant with his child.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', p.&amp;nbsp;35.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In late 1938 she had a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]] and was committed to [[Kalamazoo Regional Psychiatric Hospital|Kalamazoo State Hospital]],
where she remained until Malcolm and his siblings secured her release 24 years later.
The children were separated and sent to various [[Foster care|foster homes]].&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', pp.&amp;nbsp;35–36, 265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.&amp;nbsp;33–34, 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm Little excelled in junior high school but dropped out after a white teacher told him that practicing law, his aspiration at the time, was &quot;no realistic goal for a &lt;!-- PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THIS EXACT QUOTE. WP:PROFANE: &quot;a vulgarity or obscenity should either appear in its full form or not at all; words should never be [[bowdlerized]] by replacing letters with dashes, asterisks, or other symbols&quot;)  --&gt; nigger&quot;.&lt;ref name=Perry42&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;42.&lt;/ref&gt; It made Malcolm feel that the white world offered no place for a career-oriented black man, regardless of his talent.&lt;ref name=Perry42/&gt;

After living in a series of [[Foster care|foster homes]], at age 15 Little went to live with a half-sister, Ella Little Collins,
in [[Roxbury, Boston|Roxbury]], a largely African-American neighborhood of Boston,
where he held a variety of jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, pp.&amp;nbsp;21–29, 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.&amp;nbsp;32–48, 58–61.&lt;/ref&gt;
After a short time in [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], Michigan, Little moved to [[Harlem]], New York, in 1943,
where he engaged in drug dealing, gambling, [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]], robbery, and [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimping]];&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.&amp;nbsp;62–81.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--BEFORE removing this information, please discuss it in the talkpage--&gt;according to recent biographies, he also occasionally had sex with other men, usually for money.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', pp.&amp;nbsp;65–66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.&amp;nbsp;77, 82–83.&lt;/ref&gt;
He was called &quot;Detroit Red&quot; because of the reddish hair he inherited from his Scottish maternal grandfather.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', pp.&amp;nbsp;37, 51–52.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;2.&lt;/ref&gt;
Little was declared &quot;mentally disqualified for military service&quot; after he told [[Conscription in the United States|draft board]] officials he was eager to 
&quot;steal us some guns, and kill us [some] [[Cracker (pejorative)|crackers]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''Autobiography'', p.&amp;nbsp;124.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Carson108&gt;Carson, p.&amp;nbsp;108.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1945, Little returned to Boston, where he embarked on a series of burglaries targeting wealthy white families.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, pp.&amp;nbsp;106–109.&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1946, he was arrested while picking up a stolen watch he had left for repairs at a jewelry shop,&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;99.&lt;/ref&gt;
and in February began serving an eight-to-ten year sentence at [[Charlestown State Prison]].&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', pp.&amp;nbsp;67–68.&lt;/ref&gt;
There he met John Bembry,&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, p.&amp;nbsp;121.&lt;/ref&gt;
a self-educated man he would later describe as &quot;the first man I had ever seen command total respect ... with words&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''Autobiography'', p.&amp;nbsp;178; ellipsis in original.&lt;/ref&gt;
under Bembry's influence, Little developed a voracious appetite for reading.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.&amp;nbsp;108–110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;118.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nation of Islam==
{{Nation of Islam}}
{{Further2|[[Nation of Islam]]}}

During Little's imprisonment several of his siblings wrote to him about the [[Nation of Islam]], a relatively new religious movement preaching black self-reliance and, ultimately, unification{{clarify|date=July 2012}} of the [[African diaspora]],&lt;!-- The diaspora is the scattering of Africans throughout the world; the NoI advocated the reunification of all Africans --&gt;
free from white American and European domination.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, pp.&amp;nbsp;127–128, 132–138.&lt;/ref&gt;
He showed scant interest at first, but after his brother Reginald wrote in 1948, &quot;Malcolm, don't eat any more pork and don't smoke any more cigarettes. I'll show you how to get out of prison,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, pp.&amp;nbsp;128–129.&lt;/ref&gt;
he quit smoking and began to refuse pork.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;113.&lt;/ref&gt;
After a visit in which Reginald described the group's teachings, including the belief that white people are devils, Little came to the conclusion that every relationship he'd had with whites had been tainted by dishonesty, injustice, greed, and hatred.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, pp.&amp;nbsp;134–135.&lt;/ref&gt;
Little, whose hostility to religion had earned him the prison nickname &quot;Satan&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.&amp;nbsp;104–106.&lt;/ref&gt; began to reconsider his dismissal of all religion and he became receptive to the message of the Nation of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, p.&amp;nbsp;136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1948, Little wrote to the leader of the Nation of Islam, [[Elijah Muhammad]], who
advised him to renounce his past, humbly bow in prayer to [[Allah]], and promise never to engage in destructive behavior again.
Though he later recalled his inner struggle to bend his knees in prayer,&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''Autobiography'', p.&amp;nbsp;196.&lt;/ref&gt; he soon became a member of the Nation of Islam,&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, pp.&amp;nbsp;138–139.&lt;/ref&gt;
and thereafter maintained a regular correspondence with Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;116.&lt;/ref&gt;
He later reflected on the time he spent in prison after his conversion: &quot;Between Mr. Muhammad's teachings, my correspondence, my visitors—usually Ella and Reginald—and my reading of books, months passed without my even thinking about being imprisoned.
In fact, up to then, I had never been so truly free in my life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''Autobiography'', p.&amp;nbsp;199.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 Little began signing his name &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', p.&amp;nbsp;96.&lt;/ref&gt; explaining in his autobiography, &quot;The Muslim's 'X' symbolized the true African family name that he never could know. For me, my 'X' replaced the white slavemaster name of 'Little' which some blue-eyed devil named Little had imposed upon my paternal forebears.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''Autobiography'', p.&amp;nbsp;229.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early ministry===
After being paroled in August 1952,&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', p.&amp;nbsp;98.&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X
visited Elijah Muhammad in Chicago,&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.&amp;nbsp;142, 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 1953 was named assistant minister of the Nation's Temple Number One in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, p.&amp;nbsp;168.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nation of Islam Temples were numbered according to the order in which they were established. Perry, pp.&amp;nbsp;141–142.&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year he established Boston's Temple Number&amp;nbsp;11;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;147.&lt;/ref&gt; in March 1954, he expanded Temple Number&amp;nbsp;12 in Philadelphia;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;152.&lt;/ref&gt; and two months later he was selected to lead [[Mosque No. 7|Temple Number Seven]] in Harlem,&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;153.&lt;/ref&gt; where he rapidly expanded membership.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.&amp;nbsp;161–164.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] had opened a file on Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X in 1950 after he wrote a letter to [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] expressing opposition to the [[Korean War]] and declaring himself a communist.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', p.&amp;nbsp;95.&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI began surveillance of him in 1953, and turning its attention from Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's possible Communist association to his rapid ascent in the Nation of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, p.&amp;nbsp;95.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1955, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X continued his successful recruitment efforts on behalf of the organization. He established temples in [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], Massachusetts (Number&amp;nbsp;13); [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], Connecticut (Number&amp;nbsp;14); and [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (Number&amp;nbsp;15). Hundreds of African Americans were joining the Nation of Islam every month.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', pp.&amp;nbsp;122–123.&lt;/ref&gt; Beside his skill as a speaker, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X had an impressive physical presence. He stood {{convert|6|ft|3|in|m}} tall and weighed about {{convert|180|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref name=Marable301&gt;Marable, &quot;Rediscovering Malcolm's Life&quot;, p.&amp;nbsp;301.&lt;/ref&gt; One writer described him as &quot;powerfully built&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, p.&amp;nbsp;189.&lt;/ref&gt; and another as &quot;mesmerizingly handsome ... and always spotlessly well-groomed&quot;.&lt;ref name=Marable301/&gt;

===Marriage and family===
In 1955, [[Betty Shabazz|Betty Sanders]] met Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X after one of his lectures, then again at a dinner party;
soon she was regularly attending his lectures.
In 1956 she joined the Nation of Islam, changing her name to Betty&amp;nbsp;X.&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, pp.&amp;nbsp;36–45, 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt;
One-on-one dates were contrary to the Nation's teachings, so the couple courted at social events with dozens or hundreds of others, and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X made a point of inviting Betty&amp;nbsp;X on the frequent group visits he led to New York's museums and libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, pp.&amp;nbsp;61–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although they had never discussed marriage, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X proposed on a telephone call from Detroit in January 1958, and they married two days later.&lt;ref&gt;Shabazz, Betty, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X as a Husband and Father&quot;, Clarke, pp.&amp;nbsp;132–134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, pp.&amp;nbsp;73–74.&lt;/ref&gt;
They had six daughters:
Attallah (b. 1958, named for [[Attila the Hun]]);&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, pp.&amp;nbsp;109–110.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In a 1992 interview, Attallah Shabazz said she was not named for Attila, rather her name was Arabic for &quot;the gift of God&quot;. {{cite web |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=3-QCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA30 |title=X Patriot |last=Miller |first=Russell |date=November 23, 1992 |work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] |accessdate=November 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Qubilah Shabazz|Qubilah]] (b. 1960, named for [[Kublai Khan]]);&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, p.&amp;nbsp;122.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Ilyasah Shabazz|Ilyasah]] (b. 1962, named for Elijah Muhammad);&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, p.&amp;nbsp;123.&lt;/ref&gt;
Gamilah Lumumba (b. 1964, named for [[Patrice Lumumba]]);&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, p.&amp;nbsp;197.&lt;/ref&gt;
and twins Malikah and Malaak (b. 1965 after their father's death, and named for him).&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, p.&amp;nbsp;286.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Increasing prominence===
Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X first came to general public attention after the police beating of Nation of Islam member Johnson Hinton.&lt;ref name=Marable127&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', p.&amp;nbsp;127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Perry164&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;164.&lt;/ref&gt; 
On April&amp;nbsp;26, 1957, two police officers were beating an African-American man with nightsticks when Hinton and two other passersby—all Nation of Islam members—attempted to intervene,&lt;ref name=Marable127/&gt; shouting &quot;You're not in Alabama or Georgia. This is New York!&quot;&lt;ref name=Perry164/&gt; 
One of the officers then turned on Hinton with a beating later determined to have caused brain contusions and subdural hemorrhaging. 
All four men were arrested.&lt;ref name=Marable127/&gt;

Alerted by a witness, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and a small group of Muslims went to the police station demanding to see Hinton.&lt;ref name=Marable127/&gt;
Police initially denied that any Muslims were being held, but as the crowd grew to about five hundred, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was allowed to speak with Hinton&lt;ref name=Perry165&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;165.&lt;/ref&gt;
after which, at Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's insistence, an ambulance took Hinton to Harlem Hospital.&lt;ref name=Marable128&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', p.&amp;nbsp;128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinton was treated and returned to the police station,&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry165&quot; /&gt; outside of which some four thousand people were now gathered.
Inside, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and an attorney made bail arrangements for two of the Muslims.
Hinton was not bailed, and police said Hinton could not go back to the hospital until his [[arraignment]] the following day.&lt;ref name=Marable128/&gt; 
Believing the situation at an impasse, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X stepped outside stationhouse; at a hand signal from him, Nation members in the crowd silently left, after which the rest of the crowd also dispersed.&lt;ref name=Marable128/&gt; One police officer told the ''[[New York Amsterdam News]]'': &quot;No one man should have that much power.&quot;&lt;ref name=Marable128/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a month Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was under surveillance by the New York City Police Department, which also made inquiries with authorities in cities in which he had lived and prisons in which he had served.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', p.&amp;nbsp;132.&lt;/ref&gt; In October, after a [[grand jury]] declined to indict the officers who beat Hinton, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X wrote an angry telegram to the police commissioner; soon undercover officers were assigned to infiltrate the Nation of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', pp.&amp;nbsp;134–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 1950s, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X began to use a new name, Malcolm Shabazz or Malik el-Shabazz, although he was still widely referred to as Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', pp.&amp;nbsp;135, 193.&lt;/ref&gt;
His comments on issues and events were reported in print, on radio, and on television with increasing frequency,&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry, pp. 174–179&quot;&gt;Perry, pp.&amp;nbsp;174–179.&lt;/ref&gt; 
and he was prominently featured in a 1959 New York City television broadcast about the Nation of Islam, ''[[The Hate That Hate Produced]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perry, pp. 174–179&quot;/&gt; 

In September 1960, [[Fidel Castro]] came to New York to attend the [[United Nations General Assembly]]. Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was part of a welcoming committee of Harlem community leaders that met with Castro,&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', p.&amp;nbsp;172.&lt;/ref&gt; who was impressed sufficiently with Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X to suggest a private meeting; at the end of two hours Castro invited Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X to visit Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, p.&amp;nbsp;18.&lt;/ref&gt; During the General Assembly session Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was invited to official functions of several African nations, meeting such African leaders as [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of Egypt, [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]] of Guinea, and [[Kenneth Kaunda]] of the [[Zambian African National Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, pp.&amp;nbsp;231–233.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Advocacy and teachings while with Nation===
From his adoption of the Nation of Islam in 1952 until he broke with it in 1964, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X promoted the [[#Beliefs of the Nation of Islam|Nation's teachings]], including that black people are the original people of the world,&lt;ref name=Lomax55&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p.&amp;nbsp;55.&lt;/ref&gt; that white people are &quot;devils&quot;,&lt;ref name=Perry115&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;115.&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Black supremacy|blacks are superior]] to whites, and that the demise of the white race is imminent.&lt;ref name=Lomax57&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p.&amp;nbsp;57.&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|civil rights movement]] fought against [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]], Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X advocated the complete [[Black separatism|separation]] of African Americans from whites, proposing establishment of a separate country for black people in America&lt;ref name=Lomax149-152&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', pp.&amp;nbsp;149–152.&lt;/ref&gt; as an interim measure until African Americans could return to Africa.&lt;ref name=Supremacy78&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''End of White World Supremacy'', p.&amp;nbsp;78.&lt;/ref&gt; He also rejected the civil rights movement's strategy of [[nonviolence]], advocating that black people use any necessary means of self-defense.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lomax 173-174&quot;&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', pp.&amp;nbsp;173–174.&lt;/ref&gt; His speeches had a powerful effect on his audiences, generally African Americans in [[Northern United States|Northern]] and [[Western United States|Western]] cities, many of whom—tired of being told to wait for freedom, justice, equality and respect&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, p.&amp;nbsp;182.&lt;/ref&gt;—felt that he articulated their complaints better than did the civil rights movement.&lt;ref name=Cone99-100&gt;Cone, pp.&amp;nbsp;99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=West&gt;{{cite book |last1=West |first1=Cornel |authorlink1=Cornel West |editor1-last=Sayres |editor1-first=Sohnya |editor2-last=Stephanson |editor2-first=Anders |editor3-last=Aronowitz |editor3-first=Stanley |editor3-link=Stanley Aronowitz |editor4-last=Jameson |editor4-first=Fredric |editor4-link=Fredric Jameson |title=The 60s Without Apology |year=1984 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=978-0-8166-1336-6 |page=51 |chapter=The Paradox of the Afro-American Rebellion }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X has been widely considered the second most influential leader of the Nation of Islam after Elijah Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Cone, p.&amp;nbsp;91.&lt;/ref&gt; He was largely credited with the group's dramatic increase in membership between the early 1950s and early 1960s (from 500 to 25,000 by one author's estimate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lomax |title=When the Word Is Given |pages=15–16 |quote=Estimates of the Black Muslim membership vary from a quarter of a million down to fifty thousand.

Many white people, and even some blacks, were alarmed by Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the things he said. He and the Nation of Islam were described as hatemongers, black supremacists, racists, violence-seekers, segregationists, and a threat to improved race relations. Civil rights organizations denounced Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Nation as irresponsible extremists whose views were not representative of African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', p.&amp;nbsp;162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, pp.&amp;nbsp;215–216.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,811191-1,00.html |title=The Black Supremacists |work=TIME |date=August&amp;nbsp;10, 1959 |accessdate=July&amp;nbsp;28, 2009 }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was accused of being antisemitic.&lt;ref&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p.&amp;nbsp;172.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was equally critical of the civil rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', pp.&amp;nbsp;79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; He described its leaders as &quot;stooges&quot; for the white establishment, and he once described [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] as a &quot;chump&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;203.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;King expressed mixed feelings toward Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X. &quot;He is very articulate... but I totally disagree with many of his political and philosophical views... I don't want to seem to sound self-righteous, ... or that I think I have the only truth, the only way. Maybe he does have some of the answer... I have often wished that he would talk less of violence, because violence is not going to solve our problem. And in his litany of articulating the despair of the Negro without offering any positive, creative alternative, I feel that Malcolm has done himself and our people a great disservice... [U]rging Negroes to arm themselves and prepare to engage in violence, as he has done, can reap nothing but grief.&quot; {{cite web |url=http://www.playboy.com/playground/interviews/playboy-interview-martin-luther-king |title=The Playboy Interview: Martin Luther King |accessdate=May&amp;nbsp;30, 2012 |last=Haley |first=Alex |authorlink=Alex Haley |year=1965 |month=January |work=[[Playboy]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticized the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]], which he called &quot;the farce on Washington&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Cone, p.&amp;nbsp;113.&lt;/ref&gt; He said he did not know why so many black people were excited about a demonstration &quot;run by whites in front of a statue of a president who has been dead for a hundred years and who didn't like us when he was alive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/malcolmx/timeline/timeline2.html |title=Timeline |accessdate=July&amp;nbsp;27, 2008 |date=May&amp;nbsp;19, 2005 |work=[[Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X: Make It Plain]], [[American Experience]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leaving the Nation==
On December&amp;nbsp;1, 1963, when he was asked for a comment about the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President Kennedy]], Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X said that it was a case of &quot;[[wikt:come home to roost|chickens coming home to roost]]&quot;. He added that &quot;chickens coming home to roost never did make me sad; they've always made me glad.&quot;&lt;ref name=Times63-12-02&gt;{{cite web |title=Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X Scores U.S. and Kennedy |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=FB0812FE35541A7B93C0A91789D95F478685F9 |work=The New York Times |page=21 |date=December&amp;nbsp;2, 1963 |accessdate=July&amp;nbsp;28, 2008 }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, &quot;in further criticism of Mr. Kennedy, the Muslim leader cited the murders of [[Patrice Lumumba]], Congo leader, of [[Medgar Evers]], civil rights leader, and of the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|Negro girls bombed]] earlier this year in a [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] church. These, he said, were instances of other 'chickens coming home to roost'.&quot;&lt;ref name=Times63-12-02/&gt; The remarks prompted a widespread public outcry. The Nation of Islam, which had issued a message of condolence to the Kennedy family and ordered its ministers not to comment on the assassination, publicly censured their former shining star.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, pp.&amp;nbsp;288–290.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X retained his post and rank as minister, he was prohibited from public speaking for 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;242.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March&amp;nbsp;8, 1964, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X publicly announced his break from the Nation of Islam. He said that he was still a Muslim, but he felt the Nation of Islam had &quot;gone as far as it can&quot; because of its rigid religious teachings.&lt;ref name=Times64-03-09&gt;{{cite web |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00D17FB395415738DDDA00894DB405B848AF1D3 |title=Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X Splits with Muhammad |accessdate=August&amp;nbsp;1, 2008 |last=Handler |first=M. S. |date=March&amp;nbsp;9, 1964 |work=The New York Times }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X said he was going to organize a [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] organization that would try to &quot;heighten the political consciousness&quot; of African Americans.&lt;ref name=Times64-03-09/&gt; He also expressed his desire to work with other civil rights leaders and said that Elijah Muhammad had prevented him from doing so in the past.&lt;ref name=Times64-03-09/&gt;

One reason for the separation was growing tension between Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and Elijah Muhammad because of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's dismay about rumors of Muhammad's extramarital affairs with young secretaries, actions that were against the teachings of the Nation. Although at first Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X had ignored the rumors, after speaking with Muhammad's son [[Warith Deen Mohammed|Wallace]] and the women making the accusations, he came to believe that they were true. Muhammad confirmed the rumors in 1963 but tried to justify his actions by reference to precedents set by Biblical prophets.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.&amp;nbsp;230–234&lt;/ref&gt; Another reason for the separation was growing resentment by people within the Nation. As Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X had become a favorite of the media, many in the Nation's Chicago headquarters felt that he was over-shadowing Muhammad. [[Louis Lomax]]'s 1963 book about the Nation of Islam, ''When the Word Is Given'', featured a picture of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X on its cover and included five of his speeches, but only one of Muhammad's, which greatly upset Muhammad. Muhammad was also envious that a publisher was interested in Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's autobiography.&lt;ref name=Perry214/&gt; After leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X founded [[Muslim Mosque, Inc.]], a religious organization,&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.&amp;nbsp;251–252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X Speaks'', pp.&amp;nbsp;18–22.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Organization of Afro-American Unity]], a secular group that advocated [[Pan-Africanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.&amp;nbsp;294–296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''By Any Means Necessary'', pp.&amp;nbsp;33–67.&lt;/ref&gt; On March&amp;nbsp;26, 1964, he met [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] in Washington, D.C., after a press conference held when both men attended the [[United States Senate|Senate]] to hear the debate on the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights bill]]. This was the only time the two men ever met and their meeting lasted only one minute—just long enough for photographers to take a picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cone |title= |page=2 |quote=There was no time for substantive discussions between the two. They were photographed greeting each other warmly, smiling and shaking hands. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Perry |title= |page=255 |quote=Camera shutters clicked. The next day, the ''Chicago Sun-Times'', the ''New York World Telegram and Sun'', and other dailies carried a picture of Malcolm and Martin shaking hands. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X made a speech titled &quot;[[The Ballot or the Bullet]]&quot; in which he advised African Americans to exercise their right to vote wisely.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.&amp;nbsp;257–259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X Speaks'', pp.&amp;nbsp;23–44.&lt;/ref&gt; Several Sunni Muslims encouraged Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X to learn about Islam. Soon he converted to [[Sunni Islam]], and decided to make his [[Hajj|pilgrimage to Mecca]] (Hajj).&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;261.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International travel==

===Mecca===
In April 1964, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X began his [[Hajj]]
(the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] required of every Muslim who is able)
by flying to [[Jeddah]], Saudi Arabia, but
he was delayed there when his US citizenship and inability to speak [[Arabic language|Arabic]]
caused his status as a Muslim to be questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.&amp;nbsp;262–263.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeCaro, p.&amp;nbsp;204.&lt;/ref&gt;
He contacted [[Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam]],
whose ''The Eternal Message of Muhammad'' he had received with his visa approval.
Azzam's son not only arranged for Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's release but also lent Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X his personal hotel suite.
The next morning Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X learned that [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Prince Faisal]] had designated him a state guest,&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.&amp;nbsp;263–265.&lt;/ref&gt;
and after completing the Hajj rituals several days later, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X had an audience with the prince.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;267.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X later said that seeing Muslims of &quot;all colors, from blue-eyed blonds to black-skinned Africans&quot;, interacting as equals led him to see Islam as a means by which racial problems could be overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''Autobiography'', pp.&amp;nbsp;388–393; quote from pp.&amp;nbsp;390–391.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Africa===
Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X had visited the [[United Arab Republic]], Sudan, Nigeria, and Ghana in 1959 to make arrangements for a tour by Elijah Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p.&amp;nbsp;62.&lt;/ref&gt; 
After Mecca he visited Africa a second time, returned to the United States in late May,&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, p.&amp;nbsp;303.&lt;/ref&gt; then flew to Africa again in July.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, p.&amp;nbsp;305.&lt;/ref&gt; 
During these visits he met officials, gave interviews, and spoke on television and radio in Egypt, Ethiopia, [[Tanganyika]], Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sudan, Senegal, Liberia, Algeria, and Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, pp.&amp;nbsp;304–305.&lt;/ref&gt;
In Cairo, he attended the second meeting of the [[Organization of African Unity]] as a representative of the Organization of Afro-American Unity.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', pp.&amp;nbsp;360–362.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Kwame Nkrumah]] of Ghana, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of Egypt, and [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] of Algeria invited Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X to serve in their governments.&lt;ref name=Natambu308&gt;Natambu, p.&amp;nbsp;308.&lt;/ref&gt;
Following a speech at the [[University of Ibadan]], the Nigerian Muslim Students Association bestowed on him the honorary [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] name ''Omowale'' (&quot;the son who has come home&quot;);&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;269.&lt;/ref&gt; 
he later called this his most treasured honor.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''Autobiography'', p.&amp;nbsp;403.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time he returned to the US in November, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X had met with every prominent African leader.&lt;ref name=Natambu308/&gt;

===France and United Kingdom===
On November&amp;nbsp;23, 1964, on his way home from Africa, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X stopped in Paris, where he spoke at the Salle de la Mutualité.&lt;ref&gt;Bethune, Lebert, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X in Europe&quot;, Clarke, pp.&amp;nbsp;226–231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''By Any Means Necessary'', pp.&amp;nbsp;113–126.&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, on November&amp;nbsp;30, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X flew to the United Kingdom, and on December 3 participated in a debate at the [[Oxford Union]]. The topic of the debate was &quot;Extremism in the Defense of Liberty is No Vice; Moderation in the Pursuit of Justice is No Virtue&quot;, and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X argued the affirmative. Interest in the debate was so high that it was televised nationally by the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;Bethune, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X in Europe&quot;, Clarke, pp.&amp;nbsp;231–233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brothermalcolm.net/2003/mx_oxford/index.html |title=Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X Oxford Debate |accessdate=July&amp;nbsp;30, 2008 |author=Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X |date=December&amp;nbsp;3, 1964 |publisher=Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X: A Research Site }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February&amp;nbsp;5, 1965, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X went to Europe again.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, p.&amp;nbsp;349.&lt;/ref&gt; On February&amp;nbsp;8, he spoke in London, before the first meeting of the Council of African Organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;351.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X tried to go to France, but he was refused entry.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, p.&amp;nbsp;312.&lt;/ref&gt; On February&amp;nbsp;12, he visited [[Smethwick]], near [[Birmingham]], which had become a byword for racial division after the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 general election]], when the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] won the parliamentary seat after rumors that their candidate's supporters had used the slogan &quot;If you want a nigger for your neighbour, vote [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irr.org.uk/news/black-british-history-remembering-malcolms-visit-to-smethwick/ |title=Black British History: Remembering Malcolm's Visit to Smethwick |accessdate=May&amp;nbsp;30, 2012 |last=Kundnani |first=Arun |date=February 10,&amp;nbsp;2005 |work=Independent Race and Refugee News Network |publisher=[[Institute of Race Relations]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Return to United States==
[[File:Malcolm-x.jpg|thumb|Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X in March 1964]]
After leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X spoke before a wide variety of audiences in the United States. He spoke at regular meetings of Muslim Mosque, Inc., and the Organization of Afro-American Unity. He was one of the most sought-after speakers on college campuses,&lt;ref&gt;Terrill, p.&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/ref&gt; and one of his top aides later wrote that he &quot;welcomed every opportunity to speak to college students.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Karim, p.&amp;nbsp;128.&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X also spoke before political groups such as the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Militant Labor Forum]].&lt;ref name=Perry277-278&gt;Perry, pp.&amp;nbsp;277–278.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tensions increased between Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and the Nation of Islam. As early as February 1964, a leader of Temple Number Seven ordered a member of the [[Fruit of Islam]] to wire explosives to Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's car.&lt;ref&gt;Karim, pp.&amp;nbsp;159–160.&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1964, ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' published a photograph of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X holding an [[M1 carbine|M1 Carbine]] and peering out a window. The photo was intended to illustrate his determination to defend himself and his family against the death threats he was receiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Massaquoi |first=Hans J. |title=Mystery of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X |work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]] |date=September 1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/921123/archive_018698.htm |title=The Legacy of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X |last1=Lord |first1=Lewis |last2=Thornton |first2=Jeannye |last3=Bodipo-Memba |first3=Alejandro |date=November&amp;nbsp;15, 1992 |work=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] |page=3 |accessdate=June&amp;nbsp;2, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nation of Islam and its leaders began making both public and private threats against Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X. On March&amp;nbsp;23, 1964, Elijah Muhammad told Boston minister Louis&amp;nbsp;X (later known as [[Louis Farrakhan]]) that &quot;hypocrites like Malcolm should have their heads cut off.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kondo, p.&amp;nbsp;170.&lt;/ref&gt; The April&amp;nbsp;10 edition of ''[[Muhammad Speaks]]'' featured a cartoon in which his severed head was shown bouncing.&lt;ref&gt;Friedly, p.&amp;nbsp;169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ccbh/mxp/images/sourcebook_img_111.jpg |title=On My Own |accessdate=August&amp;nbsp;1, 2008 |last=Majied |first=Eugene |date=April&amp;nbsp;10, 1964 |work=[[Muhammad Speaks]] |publisher=[[Nation of Islam]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July&amp;nbsp;9, John Ali, a top aide to Muhammad, answered a question about Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X by saying that &quot;anyone who opposes the Honorable Elijah Muhammad puts their life in jeopardy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Evanzz, p.&amp;nbsp;248.&lt;/ref&gt; The December&amp;nbsp;4 issue of ''Muhammad Speaks'' included an article by Louis&amp;nbsp;X that railed against Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, saying &quot;such a man as Malcolm is worthy of death.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Evanzz, p.&amp;nbsp;264.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some threats were made anonymously. During the month of June 1964, FBI surveillance recorded two such threats. On June&amp;nbsp;8, a man called Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's home and told Betty Shabazz to &quot;tell him he's as good as dead.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carson, p.&amp;nbsp;473.&lt;/ref&gt; On June&amp;nbsp;12, an FBI informant reported getting an anonymous telephone call from somebody who said &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X is going to be bumped off.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carson, p.&amp;nbsp;324.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1964, the Nation of Islam sued to reclaim Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's residence in [[Queens]], New York, which they claimed to own. The suit was successful, and Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was ordered to vacate.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.&amp;nbsp;290–292.&lt;/ref&gt; On February&amp;nbsp;14, 1965, the night before a scheduled hearing to postpone the eviction date, the house burned to the ground. Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and his family survived. No one was charged with any crime.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.&amp;nbsp;352–356.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funeral===
A public viewing was held at Harlem's Unity Funeral Home from February&amp;nbsp;23 through February 26, and it was estimated that between 14,000 and 30,000 mourners attended.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;374. Alex Haley, in his Epilogue to ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'', says 22,000 (p. 519).&lt;/ref&gt; The funeral was held on February&amp;nbsp;27 at the Faith Temple [[Church of God in Christ]] in Harlem. The church was filled to capacity with more than 1,000 people.&lt;ref name=Rickford252&gt;Rickford, p.&amp;nbsp;252.&lt;/ref&gt; Loudspeakers were set up outside the Temple so the overflowing crowd could listen&lt;ref&gt;DeCaro, p.&amp;nbsp;291&lt;/ref&gt; and a local television station broadcast the funeral live.&lt;ref name=Times65-02-28&gt;{{cite web |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60615FD38591B7A93CAAB1789D85F418685F9 |title=Harlem Is Quiet as Crowds Watch Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X Rites |accessdate=August&amp;nbsp;2, 2008 |last=Arnold |first=Martin |date=February&amp;nbsp;28, 1965 |work=The New York Times }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the civil rights leaders attending were [[John Lewis (politician)|John Lewis]], [[Bayard Rustin]], [[James Forman]], [[James L. Farmer, Jr.|James Farmer]], [[Jesse Gray]], and [[Andrew Young]].&lt;ref name=Rickford252/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeCaro, p.&amp;nbsp;290.&lt;/ref&gt; Actor and activist [[Ossie Davis]] delivered the [[eulogy]], describing Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X as &quot;our shining black prince&quot;.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are those who will consider it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing him out of the history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captain—and we will smile. Many will say turn away—away from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black man—and we will smile. They will say that he is of hate—a fanatic, a racist—who can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.malcolmx.com/about/eulogy.html |title=Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's Eulogy |accessdate=September&amp;nbsp;6, 2009 |publisher=The Official Website of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X |last=Davis |first=Ossie |authorlink=Ossie Davis |date=February&amp;nbsp;27, 1965 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was buried at [[Ferncliff Cemetery]] in [[Hartsdale, New York|Hartsdale]], New York.&lt;ref name=Times65-02-28/&gt; At the gravesite after the ceremony, friends took the shovels from the waiting gravediggers and completed the burial themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, p.&amp;nbsp;255&lt;/ref&gt; Actor and activist [[Ruby Dee]] (wife of Ossie Davis) and Juanita Poitier (wife of [[Sidney Poitier]]) established the Committee of Concerned Mothers to raise funds to buy a house and pay educational expenses for Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's family.&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, pp.&amp;nbsp;261–262.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactions to assassination===
Reactions to Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's assassination were varied. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]] sent a telegram to Betty Shabazz, expressing his sadness over &quot;the shocking and tragic assassination of your husband.&quot;

&lt;blockquote&gt;While we did not always see eye to eye on methods to solve the race problem, I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and felt that he had a great ability to put his finger on the existence and root of the problem. He was an eloquent spokesman for his point of view and no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems that we face as a race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mlk-kpp01.stanford.edu/index.php/encyclopedia/documentsentry/telegram_from_martin_luther_king_jr_to_betty_al_shabazz/ |title=Telegram from Martin Luther King, Jr. to Betty al-Shabazz |last=King, Jr. |first=Martin Luther |authorlink=Martin Luther King, Jr. |publisher=The Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute |date=February&amp;nbsp;26, 1965 |accessdate=March&amp;nbsp;21, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Elijah Muhammad]] told the annual [[Saviours' Day|Savior's Day]] convention on February&amp;nbsp;26, &quot;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X got just what he preached&quot;, while denying any involvement with the murder.&lt;ref&gt;Evanzz, p.&amp;nbsp;301.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;We didn't want to kill Malcolm and didn't try to kill him&quot;, Muhammad said. &quot;We know such ignorant, foolish teachings would bring him to his own end.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, p.&amp;nbsp;232.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X was &quot;an extraordinary and twisted man&quot; who &quot;turn[ed] many true gifts to evil purpose&quot; and that his life was &quot;strangely and pitifully wasted&quot;.&lt;ref name=Times65-02-22&gt;{{cite web |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20E13F63F5812738DDDAB0A94DA405B858AF1D3 |title=Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X |accessdate=August&amp;nbsp;2, 2008 |date=February&amp;nbsp;22, 1965 |work=The New York Times }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[New York Post]]'' wrote that &quot;even his sharpest critics recognized his brilliance—often wild, unpredictable and eccentric, but nevertheless possessing promise that must now remain unrealized.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, p.&amp;nbsp;247.&lt;/ref&gt;

The international press, particularly that of Africa, was sympathetic.&lt;ref name=Rickford248&gt;Rickford, p.&amp;nbsp;248.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Times of Nigeria]]'' wrote that Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X &quot;will have a place in the palace of martyrs.&quot;&lt;ref name=Evanzz305&gt;Evanzz, p.&amp;nbsp;305.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Ghanaian Times]]'' likened him to [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]] and [[Patrice Lumumba]] among &quot;a host of Africans and Americans who were martyred in freedom's cause&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20D15F73F5812738DDDAF0A94DA405B858AF1D3 |title=Malcolm Called a Martyr Abroad |accessdate=August&amp;nbsp;2, 2008 |last=Kenworthy |first=E. W. |date=February&amp;nbsp;26, 1965 |work=The New York Times }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Guangming Daily (China)|Guangming Daily]]'', published in Beijing, stated that &quot;Malcolm was murdered because he fought for freedom and equal rights&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Evanzz, p.&amp;nbsp;306.&lt;/ref&gt; while in Cuba, ''El Mundo'' described the assassination as &quot;another racist crime to eradicate by violence the struggle against discrimination&quot;.&lt;ref name=Rickford248/&gt;

===Allegations of conspiracy===
Within days of the assassination, questions were raised about who bore ultimate responsibility. On February&amp;nbsp;23, James Farmer, the leader of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], announced at a news conference that local drug dealers, and not the Nation of Islam, were to blame.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;371.&lt;/ref&gt; Others accused the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]], the FBI, or the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], citing the lack of police protection, the ease with which the assassins entered the Audubon Ballroom, and the failure of the police to preserve the crime scene.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, &quot;Rediscovering Malcolm's Life&quot;, pp.&amp;nbsp;305–306.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;372.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, the public learned about [[COINTELPRO]] and other secret FBI programs directed towards infiltrating and disrupting civil rights organizations during the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Kondo, pp.&amp;nbsp;7–39.&lt;/ref&gt; John Ali, national secretary of the Nation of Islam, was identified as an FBI undercover agent.&lt;ref name=Lomax198&gt;Lomax, ''To Kill a Black Man'', p.&amp;nbsp;198.&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X had confided in a reporter that Ali exacerbated tensions between him and Elijah Muhammad. He considered Ali his &quot;archenemy&quot; within the Nation of Islam leadership.&lt;ref name=Lomax198/&gt; On February&amp;nbsp;20, 1965, the night before the assassination, Ali met with Talmadge Hayer, one of the men convicted of killing Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X.&lt;ref&gt;Evanzz, p.&amp;nbsp;294.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977 and 1978, Talmadge Hayer submitted [[Hayer affidavits|two sworn affidavits]] re-asserting his claim that Butler and Johnson were not involved in the assassination. In his affidavits Hayer named four men, all members of the Nation of Islam's [[Newark, New Jersey|Newark]] Temple Number&amp;nbsp;25, as having participated with him in the crime. Hayer asserted that a man, later identified as Wilbur McKinley, was the one who shouted and threw a smoke bomb to create a diversion. Hayer said that another man, later identified as William Bradley, had a shotgun and was the first to fire on Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X after the diversion. Hayer asserted that he and a man later identified as Leon Davis, both armed with pistols, fired on Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X immediately after the shotgun blast. Hayer also said that a fifth man, later identified as Benjamin Thomas, was involved in the conspiracy.&lt;ref name=Bush&gt;{{cite book |last=Bush |first=Roderick |title=We Are Not What We Seem: Black Nationalism and Class Struggle in the American Century |year=1999 |publisher=New York University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-8147-1317-4 |page=179 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedly, pp.&amp;nbsp;112–129.&lt;/ref&gt; Hayer's statements failed to convince authorities to reopen their investigation of the murder.&lt;ref name=Gardell&gt;{{cite book |last=Gardell |first=Mattias |title=In the Name of Elijah Muhammad: Louis Farrakhan and the Nation of Islam |year=1996 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, N.

Some, including the Shabazz family, have accused Louis Farrakhan of being involved in the plot to assassinate Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X.&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, pp.&amp;nbsp;437, 492–495.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evanzz, pp.&amp;nbsp;298–299.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedly, p.&amp;nbsp;253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kondo, pp.&amp;nbsp;182–183, 193–194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marable, &quot;Rediscovering Malcolm's Life&quot;, p.&amp;nbsp;305.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1993 speech, Farrakhan seemed to acknowledge the possibility that the Nation of Islam was responsible for the assassination:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Was Malcolm your traitor or ours? And if we dealt with him like a nation deals with a traitor, what the ''hell'' business is it of yours? A nation has to be able to deal with traitors and cutthroats and turncoats.&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, p.&amp;nbsp;492.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/brotherministerthemartyrdomofmalcolmx_c0098f.htm |title='Brother Minister: The Martyrdom of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X' |accessdate=August&amp;nbsp;1, 2008 |last=Wartofsky |first=Alona |date=February&amp;nbsp;17, 1995 |work=The Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview that aired during May 2000, Farrakhan stated that some of the things he said may have led to the assassination of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X. &quot;I may have been complicit in words that I spoke&quot;, he said. &quot;I acknowledge that and regret that any word that I have said caused the loss of life of a human being.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2000/05/10/60minutes/main194051.shtml |title=Farrakhan Admission on Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X |accessdate=August&amp;nbsp;2, 2008 |date=May&amp;nbsp;14, 2000 |work=[[60 Minutes]] |publisher=[[CBS News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later Farrakhan denied that he &quot;ordered the assassination&quot; of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, although he again acknowledged that he &quot;created the atmosphere that ultimately led to Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's assassination.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finalcall.com/columns/mlf/2000/mlf-60minutes05-15-2000.html |title=Farrakhan Responds to Media Attacks |accessdate=August&amp;nbsp;2, 2008 |date=May&amp;nbsp;15, 2000 |work=[[The Final Call]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; No consensus on who was responsible has been reached.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, pp.&amp;nbsp;315–316.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophy==
Except for his autobiography, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X left no published writings. His philosophy is known almost entirely from the myriad speeches and interviews he gave from 1952 until his death in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kelley |first=Robin D. G. |authorlink=Robin D.G. Kelley |editor= |encyclopedia=[[Encyclopedia Africana|Africana: The Encyclopedia of the African and African American Experience]] |title=Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X |year=1999 |publisher=Basic Civitas Books |location=New York |page=1233 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those speeches, especially from the last year of his life, were recorded and have been published.&lt;ref&gt;Terrill, pp.&amp;nbsp;15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beliefs of the Nation of Islam===
{{Further2|[[Beliefs and theology of the Nation of Islam]]}}
Before he left the Nation of Islam in 1964, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X taught its beliefs in his speeches. His speeches were peppered with the phrase &quot;The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that...&quot;.&lt;ref name=Lomax80-81&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', pp.&amp;nbsp;80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; It is virtually impossible to discern whether Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X's beliefs diverged from the teachings of the Nation of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Terrill, p.&amp;nbsp;184.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lomax |title=When the Word Is Given |page=91 |quote='I'll be honest with you,' Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X said to me. 'Everybody is talking about differences between the Messenger and me. It is absolutely impossible for us to differ.' }}&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X once compared himself to a ventriloquist's dummy who could only say what Elijah Muhammad told him.&lt;ref name=Lomax80-81/&gt;

Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X taught that black people were the original people of the world,&lt;ref name=Lomax55/&gt; and that white people were a race of devils who were created by an evil scientist named [[Yakub (Nation of Islam)|Yakub]].&lt;ref name=Perry115/&gt; The Nation of Islam believed that [[Black supremacy|black people were superior]] to white people, and that the demise of the white race was imminent.&lt;ref name=Lomax57/&gt; When he was questioned concerning his statements that white people were devils, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X said that &quot;history proves the white man is a devil.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p.&amp;nbsp;67.&lt;/ref&gt; He enumerated some of the historical reasons that, he felt, supported his argument: &quot;Anybody who rapes, and plunders, and enslaves, and steals, and drops hell bombs on people... anybody who does these things is nothing but a devil.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p.&amp;nbsp;171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X said that Islam was the &quot;true religion of black mankind&quot; and that Christianity was &quot;the white man's religion&quot; that had been imposed upon African Americans by their slave-masters.&lt;ref&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', pp.&amp;nbsp;24, 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the Nation of Islam followed Islam as it was practiced around the world, but the Nation's teachings varied from those of other Muslims because they were adapted to the &quot;uniquely pitiful&quot; condition of black people in America.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''Speeches at Harvard'', p.&amp;nbsp;119.&lt;/ref&gt; He taught that [[Wallace Fard Muhammad]], the founder of the Nation, was [[Allah]] incarnate,&lt;ref&gt;DeCaro, pp.&amp;nbsp;166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; and that Elijah Muhammad was his Messenger, or [[prophet]].&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X told Lewis Lomax that &quot;The Messenger is the Prophet of Allah&quot; (Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p.&amp;nbsp;80). On another occasion, he said &quot;We never refer to the Honorable Elijah Muhammad as a prophet&quot; (Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''Last Speeches'', p.&amp;nbsp;46).&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|civil rights movement]] fought against [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]], Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X advocated the complete [[Black separatism|separation]] of African Americans from white people. The Nation of Islam proposed the establishment of a separate country for black people in the [[Southern United States|Southern]]&lt;ref name=Lomax149-152/&gt; or Southwestern United States&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, p.&amp;nbsp;95.&lt;/ref&gt; as an interim measure until African Americans could return to Africa.&lt;ref name=Supremacy78/&gt; Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X suggested the United States government owed [[Reparations for slavery|reparations]] to black people for the unpaid labor of their [[Slavery in the United States|enslaved ancestors]].&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, p.&amp;nbsp;96.&lt;/ref&gt; He also rejected the civil rights movement's strategy of [[nonviolence]] and instead advocated that black people should protect themselves by any necessary means.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lomax 173-174&quot;/&gt;

===Independent views===
[[File:Malcolm X NYWTS.jpg|right|thumb|Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X at a 1964 press conference]]
After leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X announced his willingness to work with leaders of the civil rights movement,&lt;ref name=Times64-03-09/&gt; though he felt that it should change its focus to human rights. So long as the movement remained a fight for ''civil rights'', its struggle would remain a domestic issue, but by framing the struggle as a fight for ''human rights'', it would become an international issue, and the movement could bring its complaint before the United Nations. Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X said the emerging nations of the world would add their support to the cause of African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X Speaks'', pp.&amp;nbsp;33–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X declared that he and the other members of the Organization of Afro-American Unity were determined to defend themselves from aggressors, and to secure freedom, justice and equality &quot;by whatever means necessary&quot;, arguing that if the government was unwilling or unable to protect black people, they should protect themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''By Any Means Necessary'', pp.&amp;nbsp;43, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X stressed the global perspective he gained from his international travels. He emphasized the &quot;direct connection&quot; between the domestic struggle of African Americans for equal rights with the liberation struggles of [[Third World]] nations.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X Speaks'', p.&amp;nbsp;90.&lt;/ref&gt; He said that African Americans were wrong when they thought of themselves as a minority; in a global context, black people were a majority, not a minority.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X Speaks'', p.&amp;nbsp;117.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his speeches at the Militant Labor Forum, which was sponsored by the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]], Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X criticized capitalism.&lt;ref name=Perry277-278/&gt; After one such speech, when he was asked what political and economic system he wanted, he said he didn't know, but that it was no coincidence the newly liberated countries in the Third World were turning toward socialism.&lt;ref name=Cone284&gt;Cone, p.&amp;nbsp;284.&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X still was concerned primarily with the freedom struggle of African Americans. When a reporter asked him what he thought about socialism, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X asked whether it was good for black people. When the reporter told him it seemed to be, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X told him, &quot;Then I'm for it.&quot;&lt;ref name=Cone284/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he no longer called for the separation of black people from white people, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X continued to advocate black nationalism, which he defined as self-determination for the African-American community.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X Speaks'', pp.&amp;nbsp;38–41.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last months of his life, however, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X began to reconsider his support of black nationalism after meeting northern African revolutionaries who, to all appearances, were white.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X Speaks'', pp.&amp;nbsp;212–213.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his Hajj, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X articulated a view of white people and racism that represented a deep change from the philosophy he had supported as a minister of the Nation of Islam. In a famous letter from Mecca, he wrote that his experiences with white people during his pilgrimage convinced him to &quot;rearrange&quot; his thinking about race and &quot;toss aside some of [his] previous conclusions&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X, ''Autobiography'', p.&amp;nbsp;391.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1965 conversation with [[Gordon Parks]], two days before his assassination, Malcolm said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;[L]istening to leaders like [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]], [[Ahmed Ben Bella|Ben Bella]], and [[Kwame Nkrumah|Nkrumah]] awakened me to the dangers of racism. I realized racism isn't just a black and white problem. It's brought bloodbaths to about every nation on earth at one time or another.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Brother, remember the time that white college girl came into the restaurant—the one who wanted to help the [Black] Muslims and the whites get together—and I told her there wasn't a ghost of a chance and she went away crying? Well, I've lived to regret that incident. In many parts of the African continent I saw white students helping black people. Something like this kills a lot of argument. I did many things as a [Black] Muslim that I'm sorry for now. I was a zombie then—like all [Black] Muslims—I was hypnotized, pointed in a certain direction and told to march. Well, I guess a man's entitled to make a fool of himself if he's ready to pay the cost. It cost me 12 years.&lt;/p&gt;

In the late 1960s, as black activists became more radical, Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X and his teachings were part of the foundation on which they built their movements. The [[Black Power]] movement,&lt;ref name=&quot;Marable301&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sales, p.&amp;nbsp;187&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Black Arts Movement]],&lt;ref name=Marable301/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodard |first=Komozi |title=A Nation Within a Nation: Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones) &amp; Black Power Politics |year=1999 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |location=Chapel Hill, N.C. |isbn=978-0-8078-4761-9 |page=62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the widespread adoption of the slogan &quot;[[Black is beautiful]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cone, p.&amp;nbsp;291.&lt;/ref&gt; can all trace their roots to Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X.

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a resurgence of interest in Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X among young people, fueled in part by use of him as an icon by [[Hip hop music|hip-hop]] groups such as [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]].&lt;ref&gt;Marable, &quot;Rediscovering Malcolm's Life&quot;, pp.&amp;nbsp;301–302.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sales, p.&amp;nbsp;5.&lt;/ref&gt; His image was on display in hundreds of thousands of homes, offices, and schools,&lt;ref&gt;Marable, &quot;Rediscovering Malcolm's Life&quot;, p.&amp;nbsp;302.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as on T-shirts and jackets.&lt;ref&gt;Sales, p.&amp;nbsp;3.&lt;/ref&gt;

This wave peaked in 1992 with the release of the film ''[[Malcolm X (film)|Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Sales, p.&amp;nbsp;4&lt;/ref&gt; an adaptation of the ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'' which Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X began in 1963 in collaboration with [[Alex Haley]].&lt;ref name=Perry214&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;214.&lt;/ref&gt; (Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X had told Haley, &quot;If I'm alive when this book comes out, it will be a miracle&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Haley, &quot;Epilogue&quot;, ''Autobiography'', p.&amp;nbsp;471.&lt;/ref&gt; indeed Haley completed and published it some months after the assassination.)&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.&amp;nbsp;375.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 ''Time'' named ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X'' one of the ten most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988496,00.html |title=Required Reading: Nonfiction Books |last=Gray |first=Paul |date=June&amp;nbsp;8, 1998 |work=TIME |accessdate=April&amp;nbsp;25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
