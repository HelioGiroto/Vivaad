'''Pop punk''' is a [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] [[music genre]] that combines elements of [[punk rock]] with [[pop music]], to varying degrees. [[Allmusic]] describes the genre as a strand of [[alternative rock]], which typically merges pop [[melodies]] with speedy punk [[tempo]]s, [[chord changes]] and loud [[guitar]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d2928|pure_url=yes}} Explore: Punk-Pop.] AllMusic.&lt;/ref&gt; [[About.com]] has described contemporary pop punk bands as having &quot;a radio friendly sheen to their music, but still maintaining much of the speed and attitude of classic punk rock&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamb |first=Bill |url=http://top40.about.com/od/popmusic101/p/punkpop.htm |title=Punk Pop |publisher=Top40.about.com |date=March 10, 2011 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Origins (1974-1989)===
{{Further2|[[Punk rock]]}}
[[Image:Guttermouth(by Scott Dudelson).jpg|thumb|150px|left|[[Guttermouth]] - live in concert]]
[[Protopunk]] and [[power pop]] bands of the late 1960s and early 1970s helped lay the groundwork for the pop punk sound, which emerged at the onset of [[punk rock]] around 1974 with the [[Ramones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.punk77.co.uk/groups/ramonesdiscographylps.htm |title=The Ramones - Classic US Punk - Discography - Albums |publisher=Punk77.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ramones' loud and fast melodic minimalism differentiated them from other bands in [[New York City]]'s budding [[art rock]] scene, but pop punk was not considered a separate subgenre until later. The music of the [[Buzzcocks]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punkmusic.about.com/od/artistprofiles/p/buzzcocksfinal.htm |title=The Buzzcocks, Pop Punk Pioneers |publisher=Punkmusic.about.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Generation X (band)|Generation X]], [[999 (band)|999]], [[The Jam]],&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p4585/biography|pure_url=yes}} allmusic ((( The Jam &gt; Biography )))&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Rezillos]], [[The Lurkers]], [[The Undertones]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theundertones.com/index.cfm?go=public.band The Undertones&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollingstone.com/news/story/7250430/undertones_get_new_kicks Undertones Get New Kicks : Rolling Stone]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Shapes (UK band)|The Shapes]] and [[Toy Dolls]] featured catchy melodies, as well as lyrics that sometimes dealt with relatively light themes such as teenage romance. The US band [[Bad Religion]], who started in 1979, were another band that helped lay the groundwork for contemporary pop punk.&lt;ref&gt;http://darwin.citysearch.com.au/music/viewContent/1119945819575/1137509637901&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/contemporary-musicians/bad-religion-biography |title=Bad Religion Biography: Contemporary Musicians |publisher=Enotes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Heller |first=Jason |url=http://www.westword.com/2002-04-11/music/bad-religion/ |title=Bad Religion - The Process of Belief (Epitaph) |publisher=Westword |date=April 11, 2002 |accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many [[mod revival]] bands of the late 1970s and early 1980s also displayed pop punk leanings.

By 1981, [[hardcore punk]] had emerged in the [[United States]], with louder, faster music than punk bands. Vocal harmony, melodic instrumentation and [[Time signature|4/4]] drumming were replaced with shouting, [[Consonance and dissonance|discordant]] instrumentation, and experimental rhythms. A few bands, such as [[Descendents (band)|Descendents]], [[Screeching Weasel]], and [[The Vandals]], began to combine hardcore with [[pop music]] to create a new, faster pop punk sound. Their positive yet sarcastic approach began to separate them from the more serious hardcore scene. In the 1980s, the term ''pop punk'' was used in publications such as ''[[Maximum RocknRoll]]'' for bands similar to [[Social Distortion]], [[Agent Orange (band)|Agent Orange]], and [[T.S.O.L.]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Maximum RocknRoll]], &quot;''BLOODSPORT - cassette (music review)''&quot;, Tim Yohannan, December 1984, Issue 20, Page 66.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pop punk in the United States underwent a resurgence in the early- to mid-1990s, although the genre was not commercially viable at that time. Many pop punk bands retained a [[do it yourself]] (DIY) approach to their music, and a number of [[independent record label]]s emerged during that period, often run by band members who wanted to release their own music and that of their friends. The independent labels [[SST Records|SST]]/[[Cruz Records]], [[Lookout! Records]], [[Fat Wreck Chords]] and [[Epitaph Records]] were about to achieve mainstream success.

===Popular acceptance (1994-1998)===

Punk purists disliked the fact that the band's confusion was turned inward rather than outward toward society.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1995&quot;/&gt;
}}
By 1994, pop-influenced punk music was quickly growing in popularity and gaining mainstream acceptance. Many of these bands grew from the California punk scene of the 1980s, and several of those such bands — [[Green Day]] and [[The Offspring]], who were followed by [[Blink-182]] — helped revive interest in punk rock in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;DeRogatis, Jim. ''Milk It!: Collected Musings on the Alternative Music Explosion of the 90's''. Cambridge: Da Capo, 2003. Pg. 357, ISBN 0-306-81271-1&lt;/ref&gt;

Green Day rose from the strident tradition of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] and the [[924 Gilman Street]] scene.&lt;ref name=nytimes2012&gt;{{cite journal| last =Caramanica| first =Jon| date =September 25, 2012| title =Pop-Punk Bands, Now Grown Up| journal =[[The New York Times]]| publisher =[[The New York Times Company]]| location =[[New York City]] | issn =0362-4331| url =http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/26/arts/music/green-day-and-no-doubt-have-new-albums.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=1&amp;| accessdate =October 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After underground success, the band signed to [[Reprise Records]] and recorded their major-label debut, ''[[Dookie]]'', which was released in 1994. The record produced several radio singles that would receive extensive MTV rotation - &quot;[[Basket Case (song)|Basket Case]]&quot;, &quot;[[When I Come Around]]&quot;, and &quot;[[Longview (song)|Longview]]&quot; - all of which peaked at number one on the [[Modern Rock Tracks]] chart and helped ''Dookie'' sell four million copies by the year's end.&lt;ref name=nytimes1995&gt;{{cite journal| last =Strauss| first =Neil| date =February 5, 1995| title =POP VIEW; Has Success Spoiled Green Day?| journal =The New York Times| publisher =The New York Times Company| location =New York City | issn =0362-4331| url =http://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/05/arts/pop-view-has-success-spoiled-green-day.html| accessdate =October 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Green Day were elevated to a national level, headlining [[Lollapalooza]] and [[Woodstock 1994]] and becoming nominated for four [[Grammy Award]]s. Consequently, punk hardliners criticized the band for &quot;selling out,&quot; finding Green Day's music too soft and pop-oriented.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1995&quot;/&gt;

The same year, [[The Offspring]] found similar success in the indie release ''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]'', which would go 6x Platinum in the US, and produced the hit singles &quot;[[Come Out and Play (song)|Come Out and Play]]&quot; and &quot;[[Self-Esteem]]&quot;. The Offspring, too, were criticized by punk purists who considered the band's mainstream success the opposite of the traditional punk aesthetic. In addition, Weezer's [[Weezer (1994 album)|blue album]] (1994), despite being considered a [[power pop]] album, contains overtones largely inspired by the emerging pop punk scene at the time. By 1995, [[ska punk]] achieved commercial success in the United States and several other countries. Some ska punk music — by bands such as [[Reel Big Fish]], [[Goldfinger (band)|Goldfinger]] and [[Less Than Jake]]  — shared many characteristics with pop punk. The [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] band [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], in particular, was influential in reviving interest in the punk rock genre with their self-titled third record in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Luciano, Phil | title=Sublime to perform with new singer |date=July 14, 2011 |url=http://www.pjstar.com/entertainment/x1850043729/Sublime-to-perform-with-new-singer | publisher=[[Journal Star (Peoria)|pjstar.com]] | accessdate=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another ska punk band, [[No Doubt]], hailed from [[Anaheim]] in southern California and their 1995 album ''[[Tragic Kingdom]]'' performed overwhelmingly well on the charts in 1996.

[[Green Day]] eventually took a more &quot;punk&quot; path with ''[[Insomniac (Green Day album)|Insomniac]]'' in 1996 and generally fell out of popularity by the end of the decade, while No Doubt's assimilation into pop music was more complete by the band's openness to incorporate other genres, from [[reggae]] to [[R&amp;B]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes2012&quot;/&gt; In the aftermath of the 1994 punk breakthrough, bands such as [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] and [[Face to Face (punk band)|Face to Face]] were the subject of major-label bidding wars and lucrative deals.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1995&quot;/&gt; Albums such as ''Dookie'' and ''Tragic Kingdom'' have been certified diamond for shipping over 10 million units in the United States alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes2012&quot;/&gt; The Offspring's ''Smash'' is the best-selling independent label album of all-time with over 12 million copies sold worldwide. In 1997, [[San Diego]]-based [[Blink-182]]'s single &quot;[[Dammit (Growing Up)|Dammit]]&quot; found gradual success at rock radio and signaled a change in the [[status quo]] that would come full circle in the following two years. The Offspring returned in 1998 with ''[[Americana (The Offspring album)|Americana]]'', which reached the top 10 worldwide and went multiplatinum with 9 million certified copies worldwide. The hit single &quot;[[Pretty Fly (For a White Guy)]]&quot; became an iconic song, and went 4x Platinum in Australia.

Pop punk generally peaked with the release of Blink-182's ''[[Enema of the State]]'' in 1999, which spawned popular singles &quot;[[What's My Age Again?]]&quot; and &quot;[[All the Small Things]]&quot;, the latter of which became the first U.S. punk-identified single to reach the ''Billboard'' Hot 100. The band's celebrity status was cemented by constant rotation on [[MTV]]. The record would sell 15 million copies worldwide, solidifying Blink-182 as the biggest pop punk act of the era. The band [[Lit (band)|Lit]] enjoyed success with &quot;[[My Own Worst Enemy (Lit song)|My Own Worst Enemy]]&quot;, which spent 11 weeks on the top of the modern rock charts and [[New Found Glory]] gained popular exposure in 2000 with the release of their [[New Found Glory (album)|self-titled second album]].

Glossy production generally set the &quot;new&quot; pop punk apart from crossover punk acts such as Green Day. Blink-182 found continued success in 2001 with ''[[Take Off Your Pants and Jacket]]'' (&quot;[[The Rock Show]]&quot;, &quot;[[First Date (song)|First Date]]&quot;) while [[Sum 41]]'s major-label debut ''[[All Killer No Filler]]'' went multiplatinum and spawned ''[[TRL]]'' hits &quot;[[Fat Lip]]&quot; and &quot;[[In Too Deep (Sum 41 song)|In Too Deep]]&quot;. [[Simple Plan]] rose to the forefront in 2002 with ''[[No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls]]'' and [[Good Charlotte]] found similar success in ''[[The Young and the Hopeless]]''. Bands such as [[MxPx]], [[American Hi-Fi]] and [[Bowling for Soup]] also achieved relatively high-charting hits on industry charts in the early 2000s. Solo artist [[Avril Lavigne]], who has been referred to as the &quot;[[Honorific_nicknames_in_popular_music#L|pop punk princess]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allmovie.com/movie/avril-lavigne-the-best-damn-tour-live-in-toronto-v455208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.washingtonpost.com%2Fwp-dyn%2Fcontent%2Farticle%2F2006%2F07%2F16%2FAR2006071600317.html&lt;/ref&gt; also found commercial success in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://music.yahoo.com/avril-lavigne/biography/ &quot; It marked a return to the bratty, spunky punk-pop of Let Go...&quot; Her first album released on 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.8notes.com/biographies/avril_lavigne.asp &quot;She was one of the most popular new pop punk artists of 2002, when she released her first album&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Her songs combined confessional self-empowerment and teenage-angst lyrics with a catchy, pop punk guitar-based sound.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.musicmight.com/artist/canada/ontario/belleville/avril+lavigne&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://music.ign.com/articles/781/781509p1.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.popmatters.com/pm/review/lavigneavril-under/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/10/style/a-night-out-with-avril-lavigne-punk-rocker-pop-queen-and-tomboy-all-in-one.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/the-best-damn-thing-20070417&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio hits would extend to 2003 with [[The Ataris]]' cover of &quot;[[The Boys of Summer (song)|The Boys of Summer]]&quot; and [[Yellowcard]]'s &quot;[[Ocean Avenue (song)|Ocean Avenue]]&quot;, both commonplace on top 40 playlists. Blink-182's &quot;[[Feeling This]]&quot; and &quot;[[I Miss You (Blink-182 song)|I Miss You]]&quot; charted highly. In 2004, Simple Plan's &quot;[[Welcome to My Life]]&quot; was a top ten hit on the pop charts, while New Found Glory's &quot;[[All Downhill from Here]]&quot; peaked similarly on the rock charts. Green Day, who generally adopted a more straightforward punk rock sound but disappeared from the charts at the turn of the millennium, returned in 2004 with the worldwide success of ''[[American Idiot]]'', a politically-charged rock opera that went multiplatinum and created singles that topped charts worldwide.

===2005-Present===
{{refimprove section| date=October 2012}}
{{original research section|date=June 2012}}

By 2005, [[emo pop]], a fusion genre heavily inspired by [[emo]] and pop punk, began to make waves in the mainstream and became interchangeable with pop punk.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} As the genre coalesced, the record label [[Fueled by Ramen]] became a center of the movement, releasing [[RIAA certification|platinum]] selling albums from bands like [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Panic! at the Disco]], [[Red Jumpsuit Apparatus]] and [[Paramore]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;&gt;[http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=77:2928]&lt;/ref&gt; Bands such as [[Cartel (band)|Cartel]] and [[Motion City Soundtrack]] generally achieved little chart success but were still highly popular on tour and online.

[[Fall Out Boy]] released their breakthrough record ''[[From Under the Cork Tree]]'' in 2005, spawning top ten singles &quot;[[Sugar, We're Goin Down]]&quot; and &quot;[[Dance, Dance]]&quot;. The band had previously been a staple of the [[Chicago hardcore|Chicago hardcore punk]] scene, where they mixed pop sensibilities with hardcore punk; nevertheless, Fall Out Boy were widely considered a pop punk and emo pop act.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hardcore&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/fall-out-boy-this-is-hardcore-475858.html|title=Last year, Fall Out Boy's bassist Pete Wentz attempted suicide; now the band are punk-pop gods|last=Cripps|first=Charlotte|work=[[The Independent]]|date=April 28, 2006|publisher=Independent Print Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Associated Press |title=Fall Out Boy takes pop route to rock success |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10468264/ |work=MSNBC.com |date=December 14, 2005 |accessdate=November 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Pete Wentz]] of [[Fall Out Boy]] signed [[Panic! at the Disco]] to his record label, [[Decaydance]] and the band scored &quot;[[I Write Sins, Not Tragedies]]&quot; as a hit single, which popularized the band and won them an [[2006 MTV Video Music Awards|MTV Video Music Award]] for Video of the Year. [[The All-American Rejects]] found success with ''[[Move Along (album)|Move Along]]'' (2005), which inspired three top-15 singles: &quot;[[Dirty Little Secret]]&quot;, &quot;[[Move Along (song)|Move Along]]&quot;, and &quot;[[It Ends Tonight]]&quot;. [[My Chemical Romance]] had similar chart success in 2006 with ''[[The Black Parade]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/22/arts/music/22mich.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; Avril Lavigne had similar success with the single &quot;[[Girlfriend (Avril Lavigne song)|Girlfriend]],&quot; which peaked at number one on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and became the top-selling song of 2007. The All-American Rejects returned with &quot;[[Gives You Hell]]&quot; in 2008, which went four-times multi-platinum and charted highly.

Several pop punk bands took different directions in the late 2000s, with Panic! at the Disco crafting the Beatles-inspired, baroque pop-styled record ''[[Pretty. Odd.]]'' (2008) and Fall Out Boy experimenting with glam rock and R&amp;B on ''[[Folie a Deux]]'' (2008), both of which created fan confusion and backlash.&lt;ref name=stump27&gt;{{cite journal| last =Perpetua| first =Matthew| date =February 29, 2012| title =Patrick Stump: I'm a 27-Year-Old Has-Been| journal =[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]| volume = | issue = | page = | publisher =[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]] [[Limited liability company|LLC]]| location =[[New York City]] | issn =0035-791X | url =http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/patrick-stump-im-a-27-year-old-has-been-20120229 | accessdate =September 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RollingStone25&gt;{{cite journal| last =Greene| first =Andy| date =March 18, 2011| title =The 25 Boldest Career Moves in Rock History| journal =[[Rolling Stone (magazine)|Rolling Stone]]| volume = | issue =1127 | page = | publisher =[[Jann Wenner|Wenner Media]] [[Limited liability company|LLC]]| location =[[New York City]] | issn =0035-791X | url =http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/the-25-boldest-career-moves-in-rock-history-20110318/panic-at-the-disco-drop-the-emo-and-the-exclamation-mark-19691231 | accessdate =September 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bands such as [[Relient K]] and [[All Time Low]] also reached prominence as the 2000s decade came to a close.

In the mid-to-late 2000s, bands such as [[A Day to Remember]], [[Four Year Strong]], and [[Set Your Goals (band)|Set Your Goals]] started fusing the catchiness of pop punk with the heaviness and style of [[hardcore punk|hardcore]], by incorporating breakdowns, two-step beats, and pinch harmonics. This new style, heavily influenced by bands like [[Blink 182]] and early [[Fall Out Boy]], included hardcore and [[metalcore]] influences. The style had some underground success when Set Your Goals released ''Mutiny'' in 2006, and when Four Year Strong released ''[[Rise or Die Trying]]'' in 2007, but mainstream success didn't come until A Day to Remember released ''Homesick'' on Victory Records in 2009. The album sold 22,000 copies in its first week. The album had five singles and received frequent airplay on MTV, Fuse, and other music television channels. 

Set Your Goals released ''This Will Be The Death of Us'' in July 2009 on [[Epitaph Records]]. Four Year Strong released ''[[Enemy of the World]]'' in March 2010 and sold over 12,000 copies in its first week. Also in 2010, [[The Wonder Years (band)|The Wonder Years]] left their &quot;pop mosh&quot; past and released an album more along the lines of the traditional pop punk style called ''[[The Upsides]]'', which sold 1,852 units in its first week. 

[[New Found Glory]] released ''[[Radiosurgery (album)|Radiosurgery]]'' in October 2011 before embarking on the [[Pop Punks Not Dead Tour]] with [[This Time Next Year (band)|This Time Next Year]], [[Man Overboard (band)|Man Overboard]], The Wonder Years and Set Your Goals.
