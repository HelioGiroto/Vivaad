'''Bullfighting''' ({{lang-es|corrida de toros}} {{IPA-es|koˈriða ðe ˈtoɾos|}} or {{lang|es|''toreo''}} {{IPA-es|toˈɾeo|}}; {{lang-pt|tourada}} {{IPA-pt|toˈɾaðɐ|}}), also known as '''tauromachia''' or '''tauromachy''' ({{lang-es|tauromaquia|pron|es_tauromaquia_001.ogg}} {{audio|es_tauromaquia_001.ogg|listen}}, {{lang-pt|tauromaquia}}; from {{lang-el|ταυρομαχία}} &quot;bull-fight&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dtauromaxi%2Fa ταυρομαχία], Henry George Irvine, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; is a traditional spectacle of [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], southern [[France]] and some [[Hispanic America]]n countries ([[Mexico]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Peru]])&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cas-international.org/es/home/sufrimiento-de-toros-y-caballos/corridas-de-toros/corridas-de-toros-en-latinoamerica/&lt;/ref&gt; and the Philippines, in which one or more [[bull]]s are baited, and then killed in a [[bullring]] for sport and entertainment. As such, it is often called a blood sport by its detractors, but followers of the spectacle regard it as a 'fine art' and not a sport, as there are no elements of competition in the proceedings. In Portugal, it is illegal to kill a bull in the arena, so it is removed, treated and released into its owners' (ganadero) fields.  

The tradition, as it is practiced today, involves professional ''[[torero (bullfighter)|toreros]]'' (also called matadors) who execute various formal moves which can be interpreted and innovated according to the bullfighter's style or school. Toreros seek to elicit inspiration and art from their work and an emotional connection with the crowd transmitted through the [[Spanish Fighting Bull|bull]]. Such maneuvers are performed at close range, which places the bullfighter at risk of being gored or trampled. After the bull has been hooked multiple times behind the shoulder by other matadors in the arena, the bullfight usually concludes with the killing of the bull by a single sword thrust, which is called the estocada. Unfortunately, this usually does not happen and the innocent bull continues to lose blood while other matadors in the arena continue to  stab and torture it. In Portugal, the finale consists of a tradition called the ''pega'', where men (''forcados'') try to grab and hold the bull by its horns when it runs at them. 

Supporters of bullfighting argue that it is a culturally important tradition and a fully developed art form on par with painting, dancing and music, while [[animal rights]] advocates hold that it is a [[blood sport]] resulting in the suffering of bulls and horses.

There are many historic [[Bullring|fighting venues]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]], France and Hispanic America. The largest venue of its kind is the [[Plaza México]] in central [[Mexico City]], which seats 48,000 people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/north_america/countries/mexico/central_mexico.shtml |title=www.worldstadiums.com |publisher=www.worldstadiums.com |date= |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the oldest is the [[Plaza de toros de la Real Maestranza de Caballería de Sevilla|La Maestranza]] in [[Seville]], Spain, which was first used for bullfighting in 1765.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.realmaestranza.com/PAGINASR/historiapt.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms of non-lethal bullfighting also appear outside the Iberian and Francophone world, including the Tamil Nadu practise of ''[[jallikattu]]''; and the Portuguese-influenced ''[[mchezo wa ngombe]]'' is also practiced on the [[Tanzania]]n islands of [[Pemba Island|Pemba]] and Zanzibar. Types of bullfighting which involve bulls fighting other bulls, rather than humans, are found in the Balkans, Turkey, the Persian Gulf, Japan, Peru and Korea. In many parts of the [[Western United States]], various [[rodeo]] events like [[calf roping]] and [[bull riding]] were influenced by the Spanish bullfighting. 

==History==
{{See also|Bull (mythology)}}
[[File:Knossos bull.jpg|thumb|[[Bull-leaping]]: [[Bull-Leaping Fresco|Fresco]] from [[Knossos]]]]
Bullfighting traces its roots to prehistoric [[bull worship]] and [[animal sacrifice|sacrifice]]. The killing of the sacred bull ([[tauroctony]]) is the essential central iconic act of [[Mithraic Mysteries|Mithras]], which was commemorated in the [[mithraeum]] wherever Roman soldiers were stationed. The oldest representation of what seems to be a man facing a bull is on the [[celtiberians|celtiberian]] [[tombstone]] from [[Clunia]] and the [[cave painting]] &quot;El toro de hachos&quot;, both found in Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Guillaume ROUSSEL |url=http://www.arbre-celtique.com/encyclopedie/pierre-tombale-de-clunia-4473.htm |title=Pierre tombale de Clunia – 4473 – L'encyclopédie – L'Arbre Celtique |publisher=Arbre-celtique.com |date= |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Toro de Lidia |url=http://www.cetnotorolidia.es/opencms_wf/opencms/toro_de_lidia/origen_e_historia/index.html |title=Toro de Lidia – Toro de lidia |publisher=Cetnotorolidia.es |date=15 November 2006 |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullfighting is often linked to [[Roman Empire|Rome]], where many human-versus-animal events were held. There are also theories that it was introduced into Hispania by the Emperor [[Claudius]], as a substitute for [[gladiator]]s, when he instituted a short-lived ban on gladiatorial combat. The latter theory was supported by [[Robert Graves]]. ([[Picador]]s are the remnants of the [[javelin]], but their role in the contest is now a relatively minor one limited to &quot;preparing&quot; the bull for the matador.) Bullfighting spread from Spain to its Central and South American colonies, and in the 19th century to France, where it developed into a distinctive form in its own right.

[[File:Fresque Mithraeum Marino.jpg|thumb|Mithras killing a bull]]
Religious festivities and royal weddings were celebrated by fights in the local plaza, where noblemen would ride competing for royal favor, and the populace enjoyed the excitement.
The Spanish introduced the practice of fighting on foot around 1726.  [[Francisco Romero (matador)|Francisco Romero]] is generally regarded as having been the first to do this.

This type of fighting drew more attention from the crowds. Thus the modern corrida, or fight, began to take form, as riding noblemen were substituted by commoners on foot. This new style prompted the construction of dedicated bullrings, initially square, like the ''[[Plaza de Armas]]'', and later round, to discourage the cornering of the action.
The modern style of Spanish bullfighting is credited to [[Juan Belmonte]], generally considered the greatest matador of all time. Belmonte introduced a daring and revolutionary style, in which he stayed within a few inches of the bull throughout the fight. Although extremely dangerous (Belmonte himself was gored on many occasions), his style is still seen by most matadors as the ideal to be emulated.
Today, bullfighting remains similar to the way it was in 1726, when Francisco Romero, from Ronda, Spain, used the estoque, a sword, to kill the bull, and the [[muleta]], a small cape used in the last stage of the fight.

==Styles==
Originally, there were at least five distinct regional styles of bullfighting practised in southwestern Europe: [[Andalusia]], [[Aragon]]&amp;ndash;[[Navarre]], [[Alentejo]], [[Camargue]], [[Aquitaine]]. Over time, these have evolved more or less into standardized national forms mentioned below. The &quot;classic&quot; style of bullfight, in which the bull is killed, is the form practiced in Spain and many Latin American countries.

{{Main|Spanish-style bullfighting}}

Spanish-style bullfighting is called ''corrida de toros'' (literally &quot;running of bulls&quot;) or ''la fiesta'' (&quot;the festival&quot;). In the traditional corrida, three ''[[matador]]es'', each fight two bulls, each of which is between four and six years old and weighs no less than 460&amp;nbsp;kg (1,014&amp;nbsp;lb) &lt;ref&gt;[http://legislacion.060.es/8532-ides-idweb.html Royal Decree 145/1996, of {{Nowrap|2 February}}, to modify and reword the Regulations of Taurine Spectacles]&lt;/ref&gt; Each matador has six assistants—two ''[[picador]]es'' (&quot;lancers on horseback&quot;) mounted on horseback, three ''[[banderillero]]s'' – who along with the matadors are collectively known as ''[[torero]]s'' (&quot;bullfighters&quot;) – and a ''mozo de espadas'' (&quot;sword page&quot;). Collectively they comprise a ''[[cuadrilla]]'' (&quot;entourage&quot;). The word &quot;matador&quot; is only used in English, whereas in Spanish the more general &quot;torero&quot; is used and only when needed to distinguish the full title &quot;matador de toros&quot; is used. 

[[File:Juan Bautista corrida goyesque Feria du Riz Arles 2010.ogg|thumb|right|Start of ''tercio de varas'': polished ''verónica'' and ''larga serpentina'' during a [[goyesca corrida]].]]
[[File:José Arévalo en 2009 à Beaucaire.ogg|thumb|left|Welcoming of a toro ''a porta gayola'' and series of ''verónica'' terminated by a semi-verónica.]]
The modern corrida is highly ritualized, with three distinct stages or ''tercios'' (&quot;thirds&quot;), the start of each being announced by a bugle sound. The participants first enter the arena in a parade, called the ''paseíllo'', to salute the presiding dignitary, accompanied by band music. Torero costumes are inspired by 17th century Andalusian clothing, and matadores are easily distinguished by the gold of their ''[[traje de luces]]'' (&quot;suit of lights&quot;) as opposed to the lesser banderilleros who are also called ''toreros de plata'' (&quot;bullfighters of silver&quot;).
Next, the bull enters the ring to be tested for ferocity by the ''matador'' and ''banderilleros'' with the magenta and gold ''capote'' (&quot;cape&quot;). This is the first stage, the ''[[tercio de varas]]'' (&quot;the lancing third&quot;), and the matador first confronts the bull with the capote, performing a series of passes and observing the behavior and quirks of the bull.

Next, a picador enters the arena on horseback armed with a vara (&quot;lance&quot;). To protect the horse from the bull's horns, the horse is surrounded by a protective, padded covering called &quot;peto&quot;.  Prior to 1930, the horse did not wear any protection, and the bull would usually disembowel the horse during this stage. Until this change was instituted, the number of horses killed during a fight was higher than the number of bulls killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/84444/bullfighting &quot;Bullfighting.&quot; Encyclopædia Britannica. 2009. Encyclopædia Britannica Online.] 14 Jan. 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

At this point, the picador stabs just behind the ''morrillo'', a mound of muscle on the fighting bull's neck, weakening the neck muscles and leading to the animal's first loss of blood. The manner in which the bull charges the horse provides important clues to the matador about which side the bull favors. If the picador is successful, the bull will hold its head and horns slightly lower during the following stages of the fight. This ultimately enables the matador to perform the killing thrust later in the performance. The encounter with the picador often fundamentally changes the behaviour of a bull; distracted and unengaging bulls will become more focused and stay on a single target instead of charging at everything that moves.

In the next stage, the ''tercio de banderillas'' (&quot;the third of banderillas&quot;), each of the three banderilleros attempts to plant two ''banderillas'', sharp barbed sticks into the bull's shoulders. These anger and agitate, but further weaken, the bull which has been tired by his attacks on the horse and the damage he has taken from the lance. Sometimes a matador will place his own banderillas. If so, he usually embellishes this part of his performance and employ more varied manoeuvres than the standard &quot;al cuarteo&quot; method usually used by banderilleros as part of a matador's cuadrilla. 

[[File:Matador.JPG|thumb|Plaza de Toros Las Ventas in Madrid]]
In the final stage, the ''tercio de muerte'' (&quot;the third of death&quot;), the matador re-enters the ring alone with a small red cape, or ''[[muleta]]'', and a sword. It is a common misconception that the color red is supposed to anger the bull, because bulls, in fact, are [[colorblind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itla.net/index.cfm?sec=Longhorn_Information&amp;con=handling |title=Longhorn_Information – handling |publisher=ITLA |date= |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://iacuc.tennessee.edu/pdf/Policies-AnimalCare/Cattle-BasicCare.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The cape is thought to be red to mask the bull's blood, although this is now also a matter of tradition. The matador uses his cape to attract the bull in a series of passes which serve the dual purpose of wearing the animal down for the kill and producing a beautiful display or ''faena''. He may also demonstrate his domination over the bull by caping it especially close to his body. The faena is the entire performance with the muleta and it is usually broken down into ''tandas'', &quot;series&quot;, of passes. The faena ends with a final series of passes in which the matador with a muleta attempts to maneuver the bull into a position to stab it between the shoulder blades and through the aorta or heart. The sword is called &quot;estoque&quot; and the act of thrusting the sword is called an ''estocada''. The estoque used by the matador during the faena is called estoque simulado. This estoque simulado is made out of wood or aluminum. In contrast to the estoque de verdad (real sword) which is made out of steel and is used for the estocada the estoque simulado is lighter and therefore much easier to handle. However, at the end of the tercio de muerte at the time when the matador has finished his faena the matador will change his estoque simulado for the estoque de verdad to perform the estocada.

If the matador has performed particularly well, the crowd may petition the president to award the matador an ear of the bull by waving white handkerchiefs. If his performance was exceptional, he will award two ears, and in certain more rural rings, a tail can still be awarded. Very rarely, if the public or the matador believe that the bull has fought extremely bravely, the event's president may be petitioned to grant the bull a pardon (''indulto'') and if it is granted, the bull's life is spared; and it is allowed to leave the ring alive and return to the ranch from where it came. Then the bull becomes a stud bull for the rest of its life.

====Recortes====
[[File:Goya Tauromachia4.jpg|thumb|240px|Goya: The Speed and Daring of Juanito Apiñani in the Ring of Madrid 1815–16&lt;br /&gt;Etching and aquatint]]
Recortes, a style of bullfighting practiced in [[Navarre]], [[La Rioja (Spain)|La Rioja]], North of Castile and [[Valencian Community|Valencia]], has been far less popular than the traditional corridas. There has been a recent resurgence of recortes in Spain where they are sometimes shown on TV.

This style was common in the early 19th century. Etchings by painter [[Francisco Goya|Francisco de Goya]] depict these events.

Recortes claims to differ from a corrida in the following ways:
* The bull is not physically injured. Drawing blood is rare and the bull returns to his pen at the end of the performance.
* The men are dressed in common street clothes and not in traditional bullfighting dress.
* Acrobatics are performed without the use of capes or other props. Performers attempt to evade the bull solely through the swiftness of their movements.
* Rituals are less strict so the men have freedom to perform stunts as they please.
* Men work in teams but with less role distinction than in a corrida.
* Teams compete for points awarded by a jury.

Since horses are not used, and performers are not professionals, recortes are less costly to produce.

====Comic bullfighting====
Comical spectacles based on bullfighting, called ''espectáculos cómico-taurinos'' or ''charlotadas'', are still popular in Spain and Mexico, with troupes like ''El empastre'' or ''El bombero torero''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ganaderoslidia.com/webroot/rd-145-96.htm Bullfighting Spectacles: State Norms (in Spanish)] Example: ''Los espectáculos cómico-taurinos no podrán celebrarse conjuntamente con otros festejos taurinos en los que se dé muerte a las reses.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Portuguese===
[[File:Portuguese bullfight.jpg|''Cavaleiro'' and bull|thumb]]
{{Main|Portuguese-style bullfighting}}

Most Portuguese bullfights are held in two phases: the spectacle of the ''cavaleiro'', and the ''pega''. In the ''cavaleiro'', a horseman on a [[Lusitano|Portuguese Lusitano]] horse (specially trained for the fights) fights the bull from horseback. The purpose of this fight is to stab three or four ''bandeiras'' (small [[spear|javelins]]) into the back of the bull.

In the second stage, called the ''pega'' (&quot;holding&quot;), the [[forcado]]s, a group of eight men, challenge the bull directly without any protection or weapon of defence. The front man provokes the bull into a charge to perform a ''pega de cara'' or ''pega de caras'' (face grab). The front man secures the animal's head and is quickly aided by his fellows who surround and secure the animal until he is subdued.&lt;ref&gt;Isaacson, Andy, (2007), [http://sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2007/08/12/TRU1RCGLG.DTL &quot;California's 'bloodless bullfights' keep Portuguese tradition alive&quot;], San Francisco Chronicle.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forcados are dressed in a traditional costume of [[damask]] or [[velvet]], with long knitted hats as worn by the ''campinos'' (bull headers) from [[Ribatejo]].

The bull is not killed in the ring and, at the end of the ''corrida'', leading oxen are let into the arena and two ''campinos'' on foot herd the bull among them back to its pen. The bull is usually killed, away from the audience's sight, by a professional butcher. It can happen that some bulls, after an exceptional performance, are healed, released to pasture until their end days and used for breeding.

In the Portuguese [[Azores]] islands, there is a form of bullfighting called ''[[tourada à corda]]'', in which a bull is led on a rope along a street, while players taunt and dodge the bull, who is not killed during or after the fight, but returned to pasture and used in later events.

===French===
[[File:Amfitheater.jpg|thumb|200px|The Roman amphitheatre at [[Arles]] being fitted for a corrida]]
[[File:Bullfight incident, Arles.jpg|thumb|300px|A bullfight in Arles in 1898.]]
Since the 19th century, Spanish-style ''corridas'' have been increasingly popular in [[Southern France]] where they enjoy legal protection in areas where there is an uninterrupted tradition of such bull fights, particularly during holidays such as [[Whitsun]] or [[Easter]]. Among France's most important venues for bullfighting are the ancient Roman arenas of [[Nîmes]] and [[Arles]], although there are bull rings across the South from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic coasts. The French version of bullfighting is unique in that the bulls have a choice not to fight.

[[File:Bull and Raseteur at 75th Cocarde dOr.jpg|thumb|left|A raseteur takes a rosette]]
A more indigenous genre of bullfighting is widely common in the [[Provence]] and [[Languedoc]] areas, and is known alternately as &quot;''course libre''&quot; or &quot;''course camarguaise''&quot;. This is a bloodless spectacle (for the bulls) in which the objective is to snatch a rosette from the head of a young bull. The participants, or ''raseteurs'', begin training in their early teens against young bulls from the [[Camargue]] region of Provence before graduating to regular contests held principally in Arles and Nîmes but also in other Provençal and Languedoc towns and villages. Before the ''course'', an ''encierro''—a &quot;running&quot; of the bulls in the streets—takes place, in which young men compete to outrun the charging bulls. The ''course'' itself takes place in a small (often portable) arena erected in a town square. For a period of about 15–20 minutes, the ''raseteurs'' compete to snatch rosettes (''cocarde'') tied between the bulls' horns. They do not take the rosette with their bare hands but with a claw-shaped metal instrument called a ''raset'' or ''crochet'' (''hook'') in their hands, hence their name. Afterwards, the bulls are herded back to their pen by ''gardians'' (Camarguais [[cowboy]]s) in a ''bandido'', amidst a great deal of ceremony. The stars of these spectacles are the bulls, who get top billing and stand to gain fame and statues in their honor, and lucrative product endorsement contracts.&lt;ref&gt;''Vaches Pour Cash: L'Economie de L'Encierro Provençale'', Dr. Yves O'Malley, Nanterre University 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another type of French 'bullfighting' is the &quot;[[Course Landaise|course landaise]]&quot;, in which cows are used instead of bulls. This is a competition between teams named ''cuadrillas'', which belong to certain breeding estates. A [[cuadrilla]] is made up of a ''teneur de corde'', an ''entraîneur'', a ''sauteur'', and six ''écarteurs''. The cows are brought to the arena in crates and then taken out in order. The teneur de corde controls the dangling rope attached to the cow's horns and the entraîneur positions the cow to face and attack the player. The écarteurs will try, at the last possible moment, to dodge around the cow and the sauteur will leap over it. Each team aims to complete a set of at least one hundred dodges and eight leaps. This is the main scheme of the &quot;classic&quot; form, the ''course landaise formelle''. However, different rules may be applied in some competitions. For example, competitions for Coupe Jeannot Lafittau are arranged with cows without ropes.

At one point, it resulted in so many fatalities that the French government tried to ban it, but had to back down in the face of local opposition. The bulls themselves are generally fairly small, much less imposing than the adult bulls employed in the ''corrida''. Nonetheless, the bulls remain dangerous due to their mobility and vertically formed horns. Participants and spectators share the risk; it is not unknown for angry bulls to smash their way through barriers and charge the surrounding crowd of spectators. The ''course landaise'' is not seen as a dangerous sport by many, but écarteur Jean-Pierre Rachou died in 2003 when a bull's horn tore his [[femoral artery]].

===Tamil Nadu (Indian)===
[[File:Madurai-alanganallur-jallikattu.jpg|thumb|left|A victorious youth taking control of the bull at Alanganallur Jallikattu]]
''[[Jallikattu]]'' is a traditional bull-taming sport played in [[Tamil Nadu]], India, as a part of [[Pongal]] celebration.  It is held in the villages of Tamil Nadu as a part of the village festivals held from January to July, with the most popular event held in [[Alanganallur]], near Madurai. Jallikattu bulls belong to a few specific breeds of cattle that descended from the naturally pugnacious [[Kangeyam bull|kangayam]] breed of cattle.  In jallikattu, the bull is not killed and the competitors are unarmed; the sport is also known as ''manju virattu'' (&quot;chasing the bull&quot;). 

There are three main varieties of jallikattu:
*Found mainly in the districts of [[Madurai district|Madurai]], [[Pudukkottai district|Pudukkottai]], [[Theni district|Theni]], [[Thanjavur district|Tanjore]], and [[Salem district|Salem]], ''Vadi manju virattu'' involves a bull released from an enclosure, and the player attempts to cling to its hump. The bull attempts to shake off the rider, who competes to keep his hold on the bull while it runs a predetermined distance. 
*''Vaeli virattu'' has a bull released into an open field, where it may either run, or stand its ground and be taunted by players who approach it and dodge its attacks.
*''Vadam manjuvirattu'' (''vadam'' meaning &quot;rope&quot; in Tamil) involves a bull tied to a {{convert|50|ft|m|adj=mid|-long rope}} and free to move within that radius. A team of seven or nine members must attempt to subdue the bull within 30 minutes.

[[File:Oman bullfighting (5).jpg|thumb|right|Bullfighting in Oman]]

Bullfighting is found in [[Oman]] and the [[United Arab Emirates]]. This form of bullfighting is not lethal: two [[Brahman_(cattle)|Brahman bull]]s are presented to each other and allowed to lock horns and fight, while their handlers hold ropes to separate them if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=J6QKSXYG5tYC&amp;pg=PA29&amp;lpg=PA29&amp;dq=bullfighting+oman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rzNHsCU86a&amp;sig=H-npuAAIYqRZhr_91VNEGyPdeFI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=94MFUJnZKsTL6wHbz5DFCA&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bullfighting%20oman&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

The origins of bullfighting in Oman are unknown, though locals believe it was brought to Oman by the [[Moors]] who had conquered Spain. Its existence in Oman and the UAE is also attributed to Portugal which colonized the Omani coastline for nearly two centuries,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mangalorean.com/browsearticles.php?arttype=Feature&amp;articleid=284&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=QcMz3zV0qAMC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=bullfighting+UAE&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WfK-XbsnSo&amp;sig=N5sNT6a9ERXEz0_9yC5wwG7BldY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GYMFUIKaIcfz6wGmt8XgCA&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bullfighting%20UAE&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; and also introduced bullfighting to Omani [[Zanzibar]].&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=k8C1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=bullfighting+oman&amp;dq=bullfighting+oman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Ukx87r4CBL&amp;sig=mvUjRqdya2DLgmEZUnDoBN6oLxs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZoEFUMjqCYjG6wGetfXqCA&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwBA Pg cxxxi&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{Main|Bullfighter (rodeo)}}
Freestyle bullfighting is a style of bullfighting developed in American [[rodeo]]. The style was developed by the [[rodeo clown]]s who protect [[bull riding|bull riders]] from being trampled or gored by an angry bull. Freestyle bullfighting is a 70-second competition in which the bullfighter (rodeo clown) avoids the bull by means of dodging, jumping and use of a barrel. Competitions are organized in the US as the World Bullfighting Championship (WBC) and the [[Dickies]] National Bullfighting Championship under auspices of the [[Professional Bull Riders]] (PBR).

A distinct type of bloodless bullfighting is practised in California's [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]]. In this historically Portuguese-settled area, a form of bullfight has developed in which the bull is taunted by a matador, but the lances are tipped with velcro and aimed at velcro patches secured to the bull's shoulder. Fights occur from May through October around traditional Portuguese holidays.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=mtAoDbEEYQkC&amp;pg=PA154&amp;lpg=PA154&amp;dq=bullfighting+banned+united+states&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Qxc1k8IsN-&amp;sig=nBcRryAMIYglmJDGwyBpmqV3egA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vLwFUP7YGYW16wGNobTkCA&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=bullfighting%20banned%20united%20states&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===Balkans and Turkey===
[[Grmeč]], a mountain in the extreme west of [[Bosnia]], is the best-known site of bullfights in the [[Balkans]]. They are called the ''Corrida of Grmeč'' (''Grmečka korida'') and have been organised on every first Sunday in August for over 200 years, attracting thousands of visitors. These are fights between bulls themselves and there is no death of a bull. Fights happen in an empty field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://atlasobscura.com/place/bullfights-of-grmec |title=Bullfights of Grmec |work=Atlas Obscura |accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Corrida of Grmeč was depicted by the sculptor [[Slobodan Pejić]]. The sculpture of two bulls in a fight, made in bronze in 2004, has been compared to a confrontation of the oppressor and the oppressed or of the Bosnian people and the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian Emperor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{sl icon}} Vanda Mušič (ed).

A similar type of bull-against-bull wrestling found in Turkey is known as ''[[:tr:Boğa_güreşi#T.C3.BCrkiye.27de_bo.C4.9Fa_g.C3.BCre.C5.9Fi|boğa güreşi]]'' {{tr icon}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=U9WwsQE6AJ4C&amp;pg=PA334&amp;lpg=PA334&amp;dq=bullfighting+oman&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8yzu7zSbJU&amp;sig=Al33OEN_PPzT2EI3mR00mdwcfww&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZoEFUMjqCYjG6wGetfXqCA&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=bullfighting%20oman&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tanzania===
Bullfighting was introduced by the Portuguese to [[Zanzibar]] and to [[Pemba Island]], in modern Tanzania, where it is known as ''[[mchezo wa ngombe]]''. Similar to the Portuguese Azorean ''tourada a corda'', the bull is restrained by a rope, generally neither bull nor player is harmed, and the bull is not killed at the end of the fight.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=vBqBLjGCOpMC&amp;pg=PA253&amp;lpg=PA253&amp;dq=bullfighting+zanzibar&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=z5q5B5J2mw&amp;sig=2y1ymXicWUGOC2KhlbAewmt1R7M&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=eIUFUMHTFsqE8AGjmfyFBw&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bullfighting%20zanzibar&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=EAD%2FGBR%2F0115%2FRCMS%20162%2FY304Q%2F6%2F2 on-line descriptions in English – most available references are in Swahili] [http://www.flickr.com/photos/alaind20sn/sets/72157603822632631 Photos of Pemba bullfight on Flickr]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Okinawa (Japan)===
In Okinawa a wide variety of animal-against-animal fights are popular, including a non-lethal form of bullfighting (known as ''[[tōgyū]]'' or ''ushi-aasee'' in [[Okinawan language]]&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=8guTfpBKm5kC&amp;pg=PA198&amp;lpg=PA198&amp;dq=bullfighting+okinawa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=tUXW6tAFu4&amp;sig=czUSpBLkDakatWOzZ6qLdT2iFV0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1YgFUPz9HqW46gH5s6XXCA&amp;ved=0CGkQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=bullfighting%20okinawa&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;) in which two bulls attempt, as in [[sumo wrestling]] to push one another out of a ring.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=T0wIW7d8G1sC&amp;pg=PA119&amp;lpg=PA119&amp;dq=bullfighting+okinawa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fswoIRic26&amp;sig=vFvIBikrA_kx1aL_9ICMZne3NKw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1YgFUPz9HqW46gH5s6XXCA&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=bullfighting%20okinawa&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The sport originally came to the [[Ryuku Islands]] from mainland Japan.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=OmAbAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=bullfighting+okinawa&amp;dq=bullfighting+okinawa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=DbTbjJIQA1&amp;sig=4FHW1B40trhe0J2Bw3wqNSJaJDU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1YgFUPz9HqW46gH5s6XXCA&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwAw&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish-style bullfighting is normally fatal for the bull, but it is also dangerous for the matador. Picadors and banderilleros are sometimes gored, but this is not common.

Some matadors, notably [[Juan Belmonte]], have been gored many times: according to [[Ernest Hemingway]], Belmonte's legs were marred by many ugly scars. A special type of [[surgeon]] has developed, in Spain and elsewhere, to treat ''cornadas'', or horn-wounds.

The bullring has a chapel where a matador can pray before the corrida, and where a [[priest]] can be found in case a [[sacrament]] is needed. The most relevant sacrament is now called &quot;[[Anointing of the Sick]]&quot;; it was formerly known as &quot;Extreme Unction&quot;, or the &quot;Last Rites&quot;.

The media often reports the more horrific of bullfighting injuries, such as the May 2010 piercing of matador [[Julio Aparicio Díaz]]'s chin by a bull's horn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalturk.com/en/bullfight-injury-as-matador-gored-through-chin-in-madrid-spain-56646415|title=Spanish bull fighter suffers horrific injury as bulls horn enters beneath the chin and comes out of mouth|date=24 May 2010|accessdate={{Nowrap|24 May}} 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural aspects==
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2010}}
Many supporters of bullfighting regard it as a deeply ingrained, integral part of their national [[culture]]s. The aesthetic of bullfighting is based on the interaction of the man and the bull. Rather than a competitive sport, the bullfight is more of a ritual, which is judged by ''aficionados'' (bullfighting fans) based on artistic impression and command. Ernest Hemingway said of it in his 1932 non-fiction book ''[[Death in the Afternoon]]'': &quot;Bullfighting is the only art in which the artist is in danger of death and in which the degree of brilliance in the performance is left to the fighter's honour.&quot; Bullfighting is seen as a symbol of [[Spanish culture]].

The bullfight is above all about the demonstration of style, technique and courage by its participants. While there is usually no doubt about the outcome, the bull is not viewed as a sacrificial victim—it is instead seen by the audience as a worthy adversary, deserving of respect in its own right.

Those who oppose bullfighting maintain that the practice is merely a cowardly, sadistic tradition of slowly torturing, humiliating and finally murdering a terrified, dying bull who vomits blood, bellows in agony, and desperately seeks his escape amid pomp and pageantry of unashamed people who applaud when he finally collapses and then is killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Laborde|first=Christian|title=Corrida, Basta!|year=2009|publisher=Editions Robert Laffont|location=Paris, France|pages=14–15, 17–19, 38, 40–42, 52–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of bullfights, called &quot;[[aficionados]]&quot;, claim they respect the bulls and that bullfighting is a grand tradition; a form of art important to their culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=See Id. at 17-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity, controversy and criticism==
===Animal rights===
Bullfighting is criticized by [[animal rights]] activists, referring to it as a cruel or barbaric [[blood sport]], in which the bull suffers severe stress and a slow, torturous death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =  League Against Cruel Sports | title = What is bullfighting? | url = http://www.league.org.uk/content.asp?CategoryID=1938}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =  PETA | title = Running of the Bulls Factsheet | url = http://www.runningofthenudes.com/bullfighting_facts.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =  Irish Council Against Blood Sports | title = ICABS calls on Vodafone to drop bullfighting from ad | url = http://www.banbloodsports.com/ln-0807c.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first =  CAS International | title = The suffering of bullfighting bulls | url = http://english.stieren.net/index.php?id=390}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of animal rights or [[animal welfare]] activist groups undertake anti-bullfighting actions in Spain and other countries. According to a poll conducted in Atlanta, U.S.A., in 2003, 46% of the Americans polled hated or strongly disliked bull fighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/3087763/ |title=Most hated sports: Going to the dogs |publisher=nbcsports.msnbc.com |date=28 September 2003 |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Spanish, opposition to bullfighting is referred to as ''antitaurina''.[[File:Stier geveld5.jpg|thumb|left|Bull dying in a bullfight]]

Bullfighting guide ''The Bulletpoint Bullfight'' warns that bullfighting is &quot;not for the squeamish&quot;, advising spectators to &quot;be prepared for blood.&quot; The guide details prolonged and profuse bleeding caused by horse-mounted lancers; the charging by the bull of a blindfolded, armored horse who is &quot;sometimes doped up, and unaware of the proximity of the bull&quot;; the placing of barbed darts by banderilleros; followed by the matador's fatal sword thrust. The guide stresses that these procedures are a normal part of bullfighting and that death is rarely instantaneous. The guide further warns those attending bullfights to &quot;Be prepared to witness various failed attempts at killing the animal before it lies down.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bulletpoint Bullfight'', p. 6, ISBN 978-1-4116-7400-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
[[File:Ernest Hemingway Ticket Stub for Bullfight - NARA - 192658.tif|thumb|150px|A ticket stub from 1926]]
It has also been noted by critics that bullfighting is financed with public money.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animanaturalis.org/post/20081017_No_permitas_que_tus_impuestos_financien_la_tortura_a_los_toros__iActua_ya_ No permitas que tus impuestos financien la tortura a los toros: ¡Actúa ya.] [[AnimaNaturalis]] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2007, the Spanish fighting bull breeding industry was allocated {{Nowrap|500 million}} euros in grants,&lt;ref&gt;[http://elprogreso.galiciae.com/nova/14130.html Parte de nuestros impuestos se dedican a financiar estas prácticas.

===Style===
Another current of criticism comes from aficionados themselves, who may despise modern developments such as the defiant style (&quot;antics&quot; for some) of [[El Cordobés]] or the lifestyle of Jesulín de Ubrique, a common subject of Spanish [[gossip magazine]]s.

===Politics===
Late-19th-century / early-20th-century ''Fin-de-siècle'' Spanish ''[[regeneracionismo|regeneracionista]]'' intellectuals protested against what they called the policy of ''pan y toros'' (&quot;bread and bulls&quot;), an analogue of Roman ''[[panem et circenses]]'' promoted by politicians to keep the populace content in its oppression. During the [[Spain under Franco|Franco]] dictatorship, bullfights were supported by the state as something genuinely Spanish, as the ''fiesta nacional'', so that bullfights became associated with the regime and, for this reason, many thought they would decline after the transition to democracy, but this did not happen. Later [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party|social-democratic]] governments, particularly the government of [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], have generally been more opposed to bullfighting, prohibiting children under 14 from attending and limiting or prohibiting the broadcast of bullfights on national TV.

Some in Spain despise bullfighting because of its association with the Spanish nation and the Franco regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/features/Bullfighting-ban-and-the-horns.6445725.jp| title=Bullfighting ban and the horns of a dilemma for Spain| date= 28 July 2010| accessdate= {{Nowrap|29 July}} 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its long history and popularity in Barcelona, in 2010 bullfighting was outlawed across the [[Catalonia]] region, following a campaign led by an animal rights civic platform called &quot;Prou!&quot; (&quot;Enough!&quot; in [[Catalan language|Catalan]]). Critics have argued that the ban was motivated by issues of [[Catalan independentism]].&lt;ref name=BBC28Jul2010/&gt; 

The [[Spanish Royal Family]] is divided on the issue, from Queen [[Queen Sophia of Spain|Sophia]] who does not hide her dislike for bullfights;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.phantis.com/index.php/Queen_Sofia_of_Spain |title=Queen Sofia of Spain – Phantis |publisher=Wiki.phantis.com |date=2 July 2006 |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain|Juan Carlos]] who occasionally presides over a bullfight from the royal box as part of his official duties;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casareal.es/noticias/news/20070522_Corrida_Toros_Prensa-ides-idweb.html |title=Casa de Su Majestad el Rey de España |publisher=Casareal.es |date=22 May 2007 |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=gerrit schimmelpeninck |url=http://www.portaltaurino.com/corazon/casa_real.htm |title=Casa Real |publisher=Portaltaurino.com |date= |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.las-ventas.com/cronicas2005/0608/portada.htm |title=Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas |publisher=Las-ventas.com |date= |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; to their daughter Princess [[Infanta Elena, Duchess of Lugo|Elena]] who is well known for her liking of bullfights and who often accompanies the king in the presiding box or attends privately in the general seating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asp.las-ventas.com/noticias/noticia_detalle.asp?codigo=1126&amp;codigo_seccion=7 |title=Plaza de Toros de Las Ventas |publisher=Asp.las-ventas.com |date= |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pro-bullfighting supporters include the Spanish Prime Minister [[Mariano Rajoy]] and his government, who say the tradition is an art-form deep rooted in Spanish history. Thus the 6-year ban on live bullfights broadcast on the state-run TV Chanel has been lifted and live Bullfights are shown at the traditional 6 p.m. time on [[Televisión Española|TVE]] as of September 2012.&lt;ref&gt;

===Religion===
====Judaism====

In Judaism, the [[Talmud]] (''Nezikin'': ''Avodah Zarah'') discusses the Rabbis' warning against visiting &quot;stadiums and circuses.&quot; Prominent eleventh-century scholar Rabbi [[Shlomo Yitzhaki]] (Rashi) interpreted &quot;stadiums&quot; as referring to &quot;a place where they taunt the bull.&quot; Eighteenth-century scholar Rabbi [[Yechezkel Landau]] (Noda' BiYehuda) was asked if one may hunt for sport. He answered that one may not, for it involves putting oneself in danger and is a demonstration of cruelty toward animals. Former Chief Rabbi of Israel Rav [[Ovadia Yosef]] was asked specifically if one may watch a bullfight. He answered that it is forbidden: one must not go to places where performing acts of cruelty against animals is made into a form of amusement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.halachayomit.co.il/DisplayRead.asp?readID=1615 &quot;Milhamoth Shewarim&quot; (Hebrew)], &quot;Halacha Yomit,&quot; 17 October 2010, accessed 26 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Islam====
{{See also|Islam and animals}}

Housni al-Khateeb Shehada, an Israeli college lecturer on Islamic art and culture, analyzed the responses of [[Sunni]] jurists at [[IslamOnline]] to inquiries relating to animal cruelty and concluded that there is a strict prohibition against tormenting animals for purposes of amusement, entertainment, or [[spectator sport]] – including bullfighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Shehada|first=Housni al-Khateeb|title=The attitude towards animals in Islam according to Islamic rulings on the internet|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3688401,00.html|accessdate=20 May 2011|newspaper=[[Ynetnews]]|date=25 March 2009|quote='''In the majority of replies, the jurists refer to the explicit prohibition on the torturing of animals for purposes of amusement, entertainment or sport''' intended for spectator pleasure (e.g., bullfighting in Spain).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 October 1987, during its 10th session, the [[Muslim World League|Islamic Council]] discussed the practices of bullfighting and animal pits (where two or more animals are agitated and forced to fight each other for the sole purpose of entertainment), and issued a [[fatwa]] that both are considered [[haraam]] due to their cruel nature.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.binbaz.org.sa/mat/134&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media prohibitions===
State-run Spanish [[Televisión Española|TVE]] had cancelled live coverage of bullfights in August 2007 until September 2012, claiming that the coverage was too violent for children who might be watching, and that live coverage violated a voluntary, industry-wide code attempting to limit &quot;sequences that are particularly crude or brutal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news1130.com/news/international/article.jsp?content=w082258A No more 'ole'?

However the station will continue to broadcast 'Tendido Cero', a bullfighting magazine programme.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_18648.shtml TVE explains the decision not to broadcast bullfighting is a financial one]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having the national Spanish TV stop broadcasting it, after 50 years of history, was considered a big step for its abolition.

===Declaration as Cultural Patrimony===

A growing list of Spanish, French and South American cities and regions have started to formally declare their celebrations of bullfighting part of their protected cultural patrimony. Most of these declarations have come into place as a counter-reaction in the aftermath of the 2010 ban in Catalonia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AIT/ |url=http://tauromaquia.org/proyecto-unesco/118-continuan-de-forma-incesante-declaraciones-de-patrimonio-cultural-inmaterial-a-favor-de-los-toros.html |title=CONTINÚAN DE FORMA INCESANTE DECLARACIONES DE PATRIMONIO CULTURAL INMATERIAL A FAVOR DE LOS TOROS |publisher=tauromaquia.org |date=25 November 2011 |accessdate=4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bans===
====Pre-20th century====
[[File:Bullring-lima.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Plaza de toros de Acho]] in [[Lima]], [[Peru]]—the oldest bullring in South America, dating back to 1766]]
In November 1567, [[Pope Pius V]] issued a [[papal bull]] titled ''De Salute Gregis'' and forbidding fighting of bulls and any other beasts as the voluntary risk to life endangered the soul of the combatants, but it was abolished eight years later by his successor, [[Pope Gregory&amp;nbsp;XIII]], at the request of King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip&amp;nbsp;II]].

Bullfighting was introduced in [[Uruguay]] in 1776 by Spain and abolished by Uruguayan law in February 1912. Bullfighting was also introduced in [[Argentina]] by Spain, but after Argentina's independence, the event drastically diminished in popularity and was abolished in 1899 under law 2786.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Veronica Cerrato |url=http://www.animanaturalis.org/p/883 |title=Desde 1899, Argentina sin Corridas de Toros // |publisher=Animanaturalis.org |date= |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bullfighting also saw a presence in [[Cuba]] during its colonial period, but was quickly abolished after its independence in 1901.  Bullfighting was also banned for a period in Mexico in 1890; consequently some Spanish bullfighters moved to the United States to transfer their skills to the American rodeos.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=xGo6u70tnJkC&amp;pg=PA44&amp;lpg=PA44&amp;dq=bullfighting+banned+united+states&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JIjumIOBKB&amp;sig=0Xm1sE06S6Z2scGZ5fqrjozJdWc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=vLwFUP7YGYW16wGNobTkCA&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=bullfighting%20banned%20united%20states&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 18th and 19th centuries, bullfighting in Spain was banned at several occasions (for instance by [[Philip V of Spain|Philip&amp;nbsp;V]]), but always reinstituted later by other governments.

Bullfighting had some popularity in the Philippines during Spanish rule, though foreign commentators derided the quality of local bulls and toreros.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=hHzvx94oiUgC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=bullfighting+philippines&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=jw_vCd5dGf&amp;sig=N2GIEYxO0q1Qc8bmtFr1vjf6mqU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SsgFUO_JJKu66AGJwsjtCA&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBTgU#v=onepage&amp;q=bullfighting%20philippines&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=Gcc6AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;dq=bullfighting+philippines&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rlmS8Y4i13&amp;sig=RnPZdevhTpZKWqBLwPaLBrF_6Pc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X8cFULj-JrHR6gHMyJD4CA&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=bullfighting%20&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Bullfighting was noted in the Philippines as early as 1619, when it was among the festivities in celebration of [[Pope Urban III]]'s authorisation of the [[Feast of the Immaculate Conception]].&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=Spac9d20uG8C&amp;pg=PA53&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;dq=bullfighting+ring+Manila&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AsBrxh0ErG&amp;sig=qOS3rSk6HCZvseXOLGeEHuYB3B4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=h8sFULLlKsXU6gGY4aDYCA&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=bullfighting%20ring%20Manila&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Spanish-American War, the Americans suppressed the custom in the Philippines under the tenure of Governor General [[Leonard Wood]], and it was replaced with a now-popular Filipino sport, [[basketball]].&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=EABQAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA89&amp;lpg=RA2-PA89&amp;dq=bullfighting+prohibited+philippines&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=zCx0tX2Wlo&amp;sig=BXaMDvC3KK6aMg53WccoZMzSXHw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=_cgFUJHpBOPJ6wHX27TXCA&amp;ved=0CFkQ6AEwBw#v=snippet&amp;q=bullfighting&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- I'M SEEING MENTION OF BULLFIGHTS IN THE PHILIPPINES AS LATE AS 1950; THERE'S PROBABLY A LARGER STORY HERE --&gt;

====20th century onwards====
Bullfighting is now banned in many countries; people taking part in such activity would be liable for terms of imprisonment for [[animal cruelty]]. &quot;Bloodless&quot; variations, though, are permitted and have attracted a following in [[California]], [[Texas]], and [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first =  LA Times | title = Bloodless bullfights animate California's San Joaquin Valley | url = http://travel.latimes.com/articles/la-trw-californiabullfighting29jul29 | work=The Los Angeles Times | date=26 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In southern France, however, the traditional form of the corrida still exists and it is protected by French law. However while it is not very popular in Texas, bullfighting is legal in this U.S. state ( the only one to allow it), and both bloodless and pure forms of bullfighting occur at rodeos in small Texas towns.&lt;ref&gt;http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6200136&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the [[Canary Islands]] became the first Spanish [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Autonomous Community]] to ban bullfighting,&lt;ref name=BBC28Jul2010/&gt; when they legislated to ban bullfights and other spectacles that involve cruelty to animals, with the exception of [[cockfighting]], which is traditional in some towns in the Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gobiernodecanarias.org/boc/1991/062/001.html |title=Canary Islands Government. Law 8/1991, dated April the 30th, for animal protection {{es icon}} |publisher=Gobiernodecanarias.org |date=13 May 1991 |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some supporters of bullfighting and even [[Lorenzo Olarte Cullen]],&lt;ref name=&quot;El Mundo Olarte&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/07/28/toros/1280350886.html |title=La prohibición de la tauromaquia: un capítulo del antiespañolismo catalán |publisher=[[El Mundo (Spanish newspaper)|El Mundo]] |date=29 July 2010 |accessdate=1 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canarian head of government at the time, have argued that the fighting bull is not a &quot;domestic animal&quot; and hence the law does not ban bullfighting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mundotoro Canarias&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mundotoro.com/noticia/los-toros-no-estan-prohibidos-en-canarias/79708 |title=Los toros no están prohibidos en Canarias |publisher=Mundotoro |date=30 July 2010 |accessdate=31 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The absence of spectacles since 1984 would be due to lack of demand.
In the rest of Spain, national laws against cruelty to animals have abolished most [[blood sports]], but specifically exempt bullfighting.

Several cities around the world (especially in [[Catalonia]]) have symbolically declared themselves to be [[Anti-Bullfighting City|Anti-Bullfighting Cities]], including Barcelona in 2006. This was symbolic, as the city did not have the power to stop it. However, on 1 January 2012, it became prohibited in Catalonia (including Barcelona, the capital of this region) after a ban passed in the Regional Government in July 2010 came into effect in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Govan, &quot;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1537459/Bullfightings-future-in-doubt.html Bullfighting's Future in Doubt],&quot; ''The Telegraph'' 20 Dec. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ecuador====

Ecuador staged bullfights to the death for over three centuries due to being a former Spanish colony.

On 17 December 2010, [[Ecuador]]'s president [[Rafael Correa]] announced that in an upcoming [[referendum]], the country would be asked whether to ban bullfighting;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.elcomercio.com/2010-12-17/Home/Noticia-Principal/corridas-toros-referendum-%281%29.aspx &quot;Las corridas de toros irán a referendum&quot; by ''[[El Comercio (Ecuador)|El Comercio]]'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegrafo.com.ec/actualidad/noticia/archive/actualidad/2010/12/17/Correa-anuncia-consulta-popular-sobre-corridas-de-toros.aspx &quot;Correa anuncia consulta popular sobre corridas de toros&quot; by ''El Telegrafo'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eluniverso.com/2010/12/17/1/1355/correa-anuncia-consulta-popular-sobre-seguridad-justicia-corridas-toros.html?p=1354&amp;m=27 &quot;Correa anuncia consulta popular sobre seguridad, justicia y corridas de toros&quot; by ''[[El Universo]]'']&lt;/ref&gt; in the referendum, held in May 2011, the Ecuadorians agreed on banning the final killing of the bull that happens in a corrida.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2011/0509/1224296491068.html | work=The Irish Times | first=Tom | last=Hennigan | title=Ecuador votes to end 500 years of bullfighting | date=9 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means the bull is no longer killed before the public, and is instead taken back inside the barn to be killed at the end of the event. The other parts of the corrida are still performed the same way as before in the cities that celebrate it.&lt;ref&gt;http://quaker-animals.co.uk/?p=2650&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the referendum is applied on a regional level, meaning that in regions where the population voted against the ban, which are the same regions where bullfighting is celebrated the most, killing the animal publicly in the bullfighting plaza is still performed. The main bullfighting celebration of the country, the Fiesta Brava in Quito was still allowed to take place in December 2011 after the referendum under these new rules.&lt;ref&gt;http://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.elcomercio.com%2Ffiesta-brava%2Ftoros-quito_0_597540438.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Costa Rica====

In Costa Rica the law prohibits the killing of bulls and other animals in public and private shows&lt;ref&gt;(Reglamento Actividades Taurinas, No. 19183-GS)&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Catalonia====
{{Main|Ban on bullfighting in Catalonia}}
{{Wikinews|Bull fighting banned in Catalonia}}
On 18 December 2009, the [[parliament of Catalonia]], one of Spain's seventeen [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Autonomous Communities]], approved by majority the preparation of a [[Ban on bullfighting in Catalonia|law to ban bullfighting in Catalonia]], as a response to a popular initiative against bullfighting that gathered more than 180,000 signatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avui.cat/cat/notices/2009/12/llum_verda_a_la_supressio_de_les_corrides_de_toros_a_catalunya_81775.php |title=Llum verda a la supressió de les corrides de toros a Catalunya |publisher=Avui.cat |date=18 December 2009 |accessdate=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On {{Nowrap|28 July}} 2010, with the two main parties allowing their members a [[free vote]], the ban was passed 68 to 55, with 9 abstentions. This meant Catalonia became the second [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Community]] of Spain  (first was [[Canary Islands]] in 1991), and the first on the [[Iberian Peninsula|mainland]], to ban bullfighting. The ban took effect on 1 January 2012, and affects only the one remaining functioning Catalonian bullring, the [[La Monumental|Plaza de toros Monumental de Barcelona]].&lt;ref name=BBC28Jul2010&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-10784611|title=Catalonia bans bullfighting in landmark Spain vote|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|date=28 July 2010|accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/29/world/europe/29spain.html?ref=world |title=Spanish Region Bans Bullfighting |publisher=nytimes.com|author= Raphael Minder |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It does not affect the ''[[correbous]]'', a traditional game of the [[Ebro]] area (south of Catalonia) where lighted flares are attached to a bull’s horns. The correbous are seen mainly in the municipalities in the south of [[Tarragona]], with the exceptions of a few other towns in other provinces of Catalonia. The name ''correbous'' is essentially [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Valencian]]; in other parts of Spain they have other names.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.typicallyspanish.com/news/publish/article_27265.shtml#ixzz10NKQxwpk&lt;/ref&gt;
