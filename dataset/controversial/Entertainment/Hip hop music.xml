== Origin of the term ==

Creation of the term ''[[hip hop]]'' is often credited to Keith Cowboy, [[rapper]] with [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]].&lt;ref name=&quot;furious5&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.furious5.net/cowboy.htm |title=Keith Cowboy – The Real Mc Coy |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2006-03-17 |accessdate=2010-01-12 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060317071002/http://www.furious5.net/cowboy.htm | archivedate = 2006-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Lovebug Starski]], Keith Cowboy, and [[DJ Hollywood]] used the term when the music was still known as ''[[disco|disco rap]]''. It is believed that Cowboy created the term while teasing a friend who had just joined the U.S. Army, by [[scat singing]] the words &quot;hip/hop/hip/hop&quot; in a way that mimicked the [[rhythmic]] cadence of soldiers marching.&lt;ref name=&quot;furious5&quot; /&gt; Cowboy later worked the &quot;hip hop&quot; cadence into a part of his stage performance, which was quickly used by other artists such as [[The Sugarhill Gang]] in &quot;[[Rapper's Delight]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;furious5&quot; /&gt;

[[Universal Zulu Nation]] founder [[Afrika Bambaataa]] is credited with first using the term to describe the [[subculture]] in which the music belonged; although it is also suggested that it was a derogatory term to describe the type of music.&lt;ref&gt;[http://72.14.209.104/search?q=cache:nmWYaxJvswsJ:www.zulunation.com/hip_hop_history_2.htm+%22keith+cowboy%22+%22hip+hop%22+military&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;ct=clnk&amp;cd=3 Zulunation.com] (cached)&lt;/ref&gt; The first use of the term in print was in ''[[The Village Voice]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Hagar, Steven. &quot;Afrika Bambaataa’s Hip-Hop,&quot; ''Village Voice''&lt;/ref&gt; by Steven Hager, later author of a 1984 history of hip hop.&lt;ref&gt;Hager, Steven. Hip Hop: The Illustrated History of [[Break Dancing]], Rap Music, and [[Graffiti]]. St Martins Press, 1984 (out of print).&lt;/ref&gt;

== 1970s ==

=== Origins ===
[[File:1520 Sedwick Ave., Bronx, New York1.JPG|thumb|left|1520 Sedgwick Avenue, the Bronx, a venue used by Kool Herc that is often considered the birthplace of hip hop]]
[[File:Kool Herc.jpg|thumb|[[DJ Kool Herc]], recognized as one of the earliest hip hop artists]]

Hip hop as music and culture formed during the 1970s when [[block parties]] became increasingly popular in [[New York City]], particularly among [[African American]] youth residing in the [[Bronx]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Eric Dyson|Dyson, Michael Eric]], 2007, ''Know What I Mean? : Reflections on Hip-Hop'', Basic Civitas Books, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Block parties incorporated DJs who played popular [[genre]]s of music, especially [[funk]] and [[soul music]]. Due to the positive reception, DJs began isolating the [[percussion|percussive]] breaks of popular songs. This technique was then common in Jamaican [[dub music]],&lt;ref name=&quot;dub music&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Stas Bekman: stas (at) stason.org|url=http://stason.org/TULARC/music-genres/reggae-dub/3-What-is-Dub-music-anyway-Reggae.html |title= What is &quot;Dub&quot; music anyway? (Reggae) |publisher=Stason.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was largely introduced into New York by immigrants from Jamaica and elsewhere in the Caribbean, including [[DJ Kool Herc]], who is generally considered the father of hip hop. Because the percussive breaks in funk, soul and [[disco]] records were generally short, Herc and other DJs began using two turntables to extend the breaks.

Turntablist techniques - such as scratching (attributed to [[Grand Wizzard Theodore]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|publisher=NPR |title=NPR: The Birth of Rap: A Look Back |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7550286 |author=David Dye |date=February 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AllMusic1&quot;&gt;{{Dead link|date=January 2011|bot=CactusBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;), beat mixing and/or matching, and beat juggling - eventually developed along with the breaks, creating a base that could be rapped over, in a manner similar to [[signifying]], as well as the art of [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]], another influence found in Jamaican dub music.&lt;ref name=&quot;dub music&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;more dub music&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Philen |first=Robert |url=http://robertphilen.blogspot.com/2007/11/mythic-music-stockhausen-davis-and.html |title=Robert Philen's Blog: Mythic Music: Stockhausen, Davis and Macero, Dub, Hip Hop, and Lévi-Strauss |publisher=Robertphilen.blogspot.com |date=2007-11-05 |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hip hop music in its infancy has be described as an outlet and a &quot;voice&quot; for the disenfranchised youth of low-economic areas,&lt;ref name=&quot;Metaphorical Conceptions&quot;&gt;Crossley, Scott. '’Metaphorical Conceptions in Hip-Hop Music”, African American Review, St Louis University Press, 2005. '''pp.501–502'''&lt;/ref&gt; as the culture reflected the social, economic and political realities of their lives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hip Hop in History&quot;&gt;Alridge D, Steward J. “Introduction: Hip Hop in History: Past, Present, and Future”, Journal of African American History 2005. '''pp.190'''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Introduction of rapping ===

[[Rapping]], also referred to as [[MCing]] or emceeing, is a vocal style in which the artist speaks lyrically, in rhyme and verse, generally to an instrumental or synthesized [[beat (music)|beat]]. Beats, almost always in 4/4 [[time signature]], can be created by [[sampling (music)|sampling]] and/or sequencing portions of other songs by a [[Hip hop production|producer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whosampled.com/ |title=A database of sampled music |publisher=WhoSampled |date= |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also incorporate synthesizers, drum machines, and live bands. Rappers may write, memorize, or [[Freestyle rap|improvise their lyrics]] and perform their works [[a cappella]] or to a beat.

Hip hop music predates the introduction of rapping into hip hop culture, and rap vocals are absent from many hip hop tracks, such as &quot;[[Hip Hop, Be Bop (Don’t Stop)]]&quot; by [[Man Parrish]]; &quot;[[Paid in Full (album)|Chinese Arithmetic]]&quot; by [[Eric B. &amp; Rakim]]; &quot;Al-Naafiysh (The Soul)&quot; and &quot;We're Rocking the Planet&quot; by [[Jerry Calliste, Jr.|Hashim]]; and &quot;Destination Earth&quot; by [[Newcleus]]. However, the majority of the genre has been accompanied by rap vocals.

The roots of rapping are found in [[African-American music]] and ultimately [[Music of Africa|African music]], particularly that of the [[griots]] of West African culture.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, K.E. (2005). ''[http://www.google.com/books?id=gjsjb0QGCJIC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=iw&amp;source=gbs_atb#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Gettin' our groove on: rhetoric, language, and literacy for the hip hop generation]'', Wayne State University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The African-American traditions of [[signifyin']], [[the dozens]], and [[jazz poetry]] all influence hip hop music, as well as the [[call and response]] patterns of African and African-American religious ceremonies. Soul singer [[James Brown]], and musical 'comedy' acts such as [[Rudy Ray Moore]] and [[Blowfly (artist)|Blowfly]] are often considered &quot;godfathers&quot; of hip hop music.

Within New York City, performances of [[spoken word|spoken-word]] poetry and music by artists such as [[The Last Poets]], [[Gil Scott-Heron]]&lt;ref&gt;Cepeda, R., George, N. 2004. ''And It Don't Stop: The Best American Hip-Hop Journalism of the Last 25 Years'', New York, Faber and Faber Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jalal Mansur Nuriddin]] had a significant impact on the post-civil rights era [[culture]] of the 1960s and 1970s, and thus the social environment in which hip hop music was created.

DJ Kool Herc and [[Coke La Rock]] provided an influence on the vocal style of rapping by delivering simple [[poetry]] verses over funk music breaks, after party-goers showed little interest in their previous attempts to integrate reggae-infused [[Deejay (Jamaican)|toasting]] into musical sets.&lt;ref name=&quot;dub music&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Hip Hop - Old School&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncimusic.com/tutorial/history/hiphop/oldschool.html |title=History of Hip Hop – Old School |publisher=nciMUSIC |date= |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; DJs and [[MC]]s would often add call and response chants, often consisting of a basic chorus, to allow the performer to gather his thoughts (e.g. &quot;one, two, three, y'all, to the beat&quot;).

Later, the MCs grew more varied in their vocal and rhythmic delivery, incorporating brief rhymes, often with a sexual or scatological theme, in an effort to differentiate themselves and to entertain the audience. These early raps incorporated the dozens, a product of African American culture. Kool Herc &amp; the Herculoids were the first hip hop group to gain recognition in New York,&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Hip Hop - Old School&quot;/&gt; but the number of MC teams increased over time.

[[File:Grandmaster IngenuityFest.jpg|thumb|[[Grandmaster Flash]]]]
Often these were collaborations between former [[gangs]], such as [[Afrikaa Bambaataa]]'s [[Universal Zulu Nation]]—now an international organization. [[Melle Mel]], a rapper with The [[Furious Five]] is often credited with being the first rap lyricist to call himself an &quot;MC&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allhiphop.com/features/?ID=1686 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071102182358/http://www.allhiphop.com/features/?ID=1686 |archivedate=2007-11-02 |title=Article about Mele Mel (Melle Mel) |publisher=AllHipHop.com}} {{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the early 1970s [[B-boying]] arose during block parties, as b-boys and b-girls got in front of the audience to dance in a distinctive and frenetic style. The style was documented for release to a world wide audience for the first time in documentaries and movies such as ''[[Style Wars]]'', ''[[Wild Style]]'', and ''[[Beat Street]]''. The term &quot;B-boy&quot; was coined by DJ Kool Herc to describe the people who would wait for the [[break (music)|break]] section of the song, getting in front of the audience to dance in a distinctive, frenetic style.&lt;ref&gt;Schloss, J.G. (2009). ''Foundation:
b-boys, b-girls, and hip-hop culture in New York'', Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there were many early MCs that recorded solo projects of note, such as [[DJ Hollywood]], [[Kurtis Blow]] and [[Spoonie Gee]], the frequency of solo artists did not increase until later with the rise of soloists with stage presence and drama, such as [[LL Cool J]]. Most early hip hop was dominated by groups where collaboration between the members was integral to the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;Toop&quot;&gt;* [[Toop, David|David Toop]] (1984/1991/2000). ''Rap Attack II: African Rap To Global Hip Hop'', p.94, ?, 96. New York. New York: Serpent's Tail. ISBN 1-85242-243-2.&lt;/ref&gt; An example would be the early hip hop group [[Funky Four Plus One]], who performed in such a manner on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;Bynoe, Y. (2006). ''Encyclopedia of rap and hip-hop culture'', Greenwood Press&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Influence of disco ===

Hip hop music was both influenced by [[disco music]] and a backlash against it. According to [[Kurtis Blow]], the early days of hip hop were characterized by divisions between fans and detractors of disco music. Hip hop had largely emerged as &quot;a direct response to the watered down, Europeanised, disco music that permeated the airwaves&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;nciMUSIC – History of Hip Hop [http://www.ncimusic.com/tutorial/history/hiphop/hiphop.html nciMUSIC.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The History Of Hip Hop pg 8 [http://www.daveyd.com/raphist8.html Daveyd.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and the earliest hip hop was mainly based on hard funk loops. However, by 1979, disco instrumental loops/tracks had become the basis of much hip hop music. This genre got the name of &quot;disco rap&quot;. Ironically, hip hop music was also a proponent in the eventual decline in disco popularity.

DJ Pete Jones, Eddie Cheeba, [[DJ Hollywood]], and [[Love Bug Starski]] were disco-influenced hip hop DJs. Their styles differed from other hip hop musicians who focused on rapid-fire rhymes and more complex rhythmic schemes. [[Afrika Bambaataa]], Paul Winley, [[Grandmaster Flash]], and [[Bobby Robinson (record producer)|Bobby Robinson]] were all members of this latter group.

In [[Washington, D.C.]] [[go-go]] emerged as a reaction against disco and eventually incorporated characteristics of hip hop during the early 1980s. The genre of [[electronic music]] behaved similarly, eventually evolving into what is known as [[house music]] in [[Chicago]] and [[techno music|techno]] in [[Detroit]].

=== Transition to recording ===

Prior to 1979, recorded hip hop music consisted mainly of [[Public address|PA system]] recordings of parties and early hip hop [[mixtapes]] by DJs.  Puerto Rican [[DJ Disco Wiz]] is credited as the first hip hop DJ to create a &quot;mixed plate,&quot; or mixed dub recording, when, in 1977, he combined sound bites, special effects and paused beats to technically produce a sound recording.&lt;ref name=&quot;hess&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |first=Mickey |last=Hess |title=Hip Hop in America: A Regional Guide |year=2009 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page= xxxiii |isbn=978-0-313-34323-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first hip hop record is widely regarded to be [[The Sugarhill Gang]]'s &quot;[[Rapper's Delight]]&quot;, from 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hip hop&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.syracuseuniversitypress.syr.edu/encyclopedia/entries/hip-hop.html |title=hip hop |work=The Encyclopedia of New York State |publisher=Syracuse University Press |date= |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, much controversy surrounds this assertion as some regard &quot;[[King Tim III (Personality Jock)]]&quot; by [[The Fatback Band]], which was released a few weeks before &quot;Rapper's Delight&quot;, as a rap record.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Heard, Thursday, 14 October 2004, 08:52 GMT 09:52 UK. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/3727320.stm &quot;Silver jubilee for first rap hit&quot;], ''BBC News''.&lt;/ref&gt; There are various other claimants for the title of first hip hop record.

By the early 1980s, all the major elements and techniques of the hip hop genre were in place. Though not yet mainstream, hip hop had permeated outside of New York City; it could be found in cities as diverse as [[Atlanta]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Baltimore]], [[Dallas]], [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], [[San Antonio, TX|San Antonio]], [[Miami]], [[Seattle]], [[St. Louis]], [[New Orleans]], [[Houston]], and [[Toronto]].  Indeed, &quot;[[Funk You Up]]&quot; (1979), the first hip hop record released by a female group, and the second single released by [[Sugar Hill Records (rap)|Sugar Hill Records]], was performed by [[The Sequence]], a group from [[Columbia, South Carolina]] which featured [[Angie Stone]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenberg1999&quot;&gt;Greenberg, Steve; Light, Alan [ed.] (1999). ''The VIBE History of Hip Hop''. Three Rivers Press. p. 28. ISBN 0-609-80503-7&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the genre's growing popularity, [[Philadelphia]] was, for many years, the only city whose contributions could be compared to New York City's. Hip hop music became popular in Philadelphia in the late 1970s. The first released record was titled &quot;Rhythm Talk&quot;, by [[Jocko Henderson]].

The ''[[New York Times]]'' had dubbed Philadelphia the &quot;Graffiti Capital of the World&quot; in 1971.

The 1980s marked the diversification of hip hop as the genre developed more complex styles.&lt;ref&gt;Benson, G. (2010).''Lonely Planet USA'', Lonely Planet&lt;/ref&gt; Early examples of the diversification process can be identified through such tracks as Grandmaster Flash's &quot;[[The Adventures of Grandmaster Flash on the Wheels of Steel]]&quot; (1981), a single consisting entirely of sampled tracks&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, M,.(2000). ''The musical work: reality or invention?'', Liverpool University Press&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Afrika Bambaataa]]'s &quot;[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]&quot; (1982), which signified the fusion of hip hop music with [[electro music|electro]]. In addition, [[Rammellzee]] &amp; [[K-Rob]]'s &quot;Beat Bop&quot; (1983) was a 'slow jam' which had a [[dub music|dub]] influence with its use of [[reverb]] and [[echo (phenomenon)|echo]] as texture and playful sound effects. The mid-1980s was marked by the influence of [[rock music]], with the release of such albums as ''[[King of Rock]]'' and ''[[Licensed to Ill]]''.

Heavy usage of the new generation of [[drum machines]] such as the [[Oberheim DMX]] and [[Roland 808]] models was a characteristic of many 1980s songs. To this day the 808 kickdrum is traditionally used by hip hop producers. Over time [[sampling (music)|sampling]] technology became more advanced; however earlier producers such as [[Marley Marl]] used drum machines to construct their beats from small excerpts of other beats in [[synchronisation]], in his case, triggering 3 [[Korg]] sampling-delay units through a 808. Later, [[sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]] such as the [[E-mu SP-1200]] allowed not only more memory but more flexibility for creative production. This allowed the filtration and layering different hits, and with a possibility of re-sequencing them into a single piece.
[[File:Afrika_Bambaataa_and_DJ_Yutaka_(2004).jpg|thumb|left|[[Afrika Bambaataa]] (on the left)]]

With the emergence of a new generation of samplers such as the AKAI S900 in the late 1980s, producers did not require the aid of tape loops. [[Public Enemy (group)|Public Enemy]]'s first album was created with the help of large tape loops. The process of looping break into a breakbeat now became more common with a sampler, now doing the job which so far had been done manually by the DJ. In 1989, DJ Mark James under the moniker &quot;45 King&quot;, released &quot;The 900 Number&quot;, a breakbeat track created by synchronizing samplers and vinyl.&lt;ref name=&quot;Toop&quot;/&gt;

The lyrical content of hip hop evolved as well. The early styles presented in the 1970s soon were replaced with metaphorical lyrics over more complex, multi-layered instrumentals. Artists such as [[Melle Mel]], [[Rakim]], [[Chuck D]], and [[KRS-One]] revolutionized hip hop by transforming it into a more mature art form. The influential single &quot;[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]&quot; (1982) by [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five]] is widely considered to be the pioneering force for [[conscious rap]].

During the early 1980s, electro music was fused with elements of the hip hop movement, largely led by artists such as [[Cybotron (band)|Cybotron]], [[Hashim]], [[Planet Patrol]] and [[Newcleus]]. The most notable proponent was [[Afrika Bambaataa]] who produced the single &quot;[[Planet Rock (song)|Planet Rock]]&quot;.

Some rappers eventually became mainstream pop performers. [[Kurtis Blow]]'s appearance in a [[Sprite (soda)|Sprite]] commercial&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorkgospel.com/articles/4/1/Kurtis-Blow-Ministries-and-Holy-Hip-Hop-Music-form-Strategic-Alliance/Page1.html]&lt;/ref&gt; marked the first hip hop musician to represent a major product. The 1981 songs &quot;[[Rapture (song)|Rapture]]&quot; by [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] and &quot;[[Christmas Wrapping]]&quot; by the new-wave band [[The Waitresses]] were one of the first pop songs to use some rapping in the delivery.

Prior to the 1980s, hip hop music was largely confined within the context of the United States. However, during the 1980s, it began its spread and became a part of the music scene in dozens of countries.

[[File:Beastie-boys.jpg|thumb|[[Beastie Boys]] in 1992.]]
In the early part of the decade, [[B-boying]] became the first aspect of hip hop culture to reach [[Japan]], [[Australia]] and [[South Africa]], where the crew [[Black Noise (group)|Black Noise]] established the practice before beginning to rap later in the decade. Musician and presenter [[Sidney Duteil|Sidney]] became France's first black TV presenter with his show ''[[H.I.P. H.O.P.]]''&lt;ref&gt;MCM retrospective on Sidney :&lt;br /&gt;''« on peut dire aujourd'hui que Sidney est le papa du ''hip-hop'' français. Concepteur de l'émission H.I.P. H.O.P. en 1984 (1ère émission rap au monde diffusée à l'époque le dimanche à 14h00 avant Starsky &amp; Hutch), ce Dj/rappeur/breakeur extravagant fait découvrir cette nouvelle tendance américaine aux Français, à peine remis de la vague disco, et crée des vocations (Joey Starr, Passi, Stomy Bugsy...) »''&lt;br /&gt;[http://www.mcm.net/musique/cdenecoute/23728/ H.I.P H.O.P – L'émission Mythique de Sidney]&lt;/ref&gt; which screened on TF1 during 1984, a first for the genre worldwide. [[Radio Nova (France)|Radio Nova]] helped launch other French stars including [[Dee Nasty]] whose 1984 album ''Paname City Rappin''' along with compilations Rapattitude 1 and 2 contributed to a general awareness of Hip Hop in France.

Hip hop has always kept a very close relationship with the Latino community in New York. [[DJ Disco Wiz]] and the [[Rock Steady Crew]] were among early innovators from [[Puerto Rico]]. combining English and Spanish in the lyrics. [[The Mean Machine (rap group)|The Mean Machine]] recorded their first song under the label &quot;Disco Dreams&quot; in 1981, while [[Kid Frost]] from Los Angeles began his career in 1982.

[[Cypress Hill]] was formed in 1988 in the suburb of South Gate outside Los Angeles when [[Senen Reyes]] (born in Havana) and his younger brother Ulpiano Sergio ([[Mellow Man Ace]]) moved from Cuba to South Gate with his family in 1971. They teamed up with DVX from Queens (New York), Lawrence Muggerud ([[DJ Muggs]]) and Louis Freese ([[B-Real]]), a Mexican/Cuban-American native of Los Angeles. After the departure of &quot;Ace&quot; to begin his solo career the group adopted the name of [[Cypress Hill]] named after a street running through a neighborhood nearby in South Los Angeles.

Japanese hip hop is said to have begun when Hiroshi Fujiwara returned to Japan and started playing hip hop records in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thememagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=62&amp;Itemid=115 |title=International Man of Mystery |publisher=Theme Magazine |date=2010-01-08 |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese hip hop generally tends to be most directly influenced by old school hip hop, taking from the era's catchy beats, dance culture, and overall fun and carefree nature and incorporating it into their music. As a result, hip hop stands as one of the most commercially viable mainstream music genres in Japan, and the line between it and pop music is frequently blurred.

===New school hip hop===
{{Main|New school hip hop}}
The new school of hip hop was the second wave of hip hop music, originating in 1983–84 with the early records of [[Run-D.M.C.]] and [[LL Cool J]]. As with the hip hop preceding it (which subsequently became known as [[old school hip hop]]), the new school came predominately from [[New York City]]. The new school was initially characterized in form by [[drum machine]]-led minimalism, with influences from [[rock music]]. It was notable for taunts and boasts about rapping, and socio-political commentary, both delivered in an aggressive, self-assertive style. In image as in song its artists projected a tough, cool, street [[b-boy]] attitude. These elements contrasted sharply with the funk and disco influenced outfits, novelty hits, live bands, synthesizers and party rhymes of artists prevalent prior to 1984, and rendered them old-school. New school artists made shorter songs that could more easily gain radio play, and more cohesive LPs than their old school counterparts. By 1986 their releases began to establish the hip hop album as a fixture of the mainstream. Hip hop music became commercially successful, as exemplified by the [[Beastie Boys]]' 1986 album ''[[Licensed to Ill]]'', which was the first rap album to hit #1 on the Billboard charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomas |first=Stephen |url=http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=A34rp283c054a |title=Licensed to Ill |publisher=allmusic |date= |accessdate=2010-01-12}} {{Dead link|date=January 2011|bot=CactusBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hip hop's &quot;golden age&quot; (or &quot;golden era&quot;) is a name given to a period in mainstream hip hop—usually cited as between the mid 1980s and the early 1990s—said to be characterized by its diversity, quality, innovation and influence.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Caramanica, [http://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/26/arts/music/26jon.html &quot;Hip-Hop's Raiders of the Lost Archives&quot;], ''New York Times'', June 26, 2005. &lt;br /&gt;Cheo H.

=== Gangsta rap and West Coast hip hop ===
{{Main|Gangsta rap|West Coast hip hop}}

Gangsta rap is a [[subgenre]] of hip hop that reflects the violent lifestyles of inner-city American black youths.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rap.about.com/od/genresstyles/p/GangstaRap.htm |title=Gangsta Rap – What Is Gangsta Rap |publisher=Rap.about.com |date=2009-10-31 |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gangsta'' is a [[non-rhotic]] pronunciation of the word ''[[gangster]]''. The genre was pioneered in the mid 1980s by rappers such as [[Schoolly D]] and [[Ice-T]], and was popularized in the later part of the 1980s by groups like [[N.W.A]]. Ice-T released &quot;[[6 in the Mornin']]&quot;, which is often regarded as the first gangsta rap song, in 1986. After the national attention that Ice-T and N.W.A created in the late 1980s and early 1990s, gangsta rap became the most commercially lucrative subgenre of hip hop.

N.W.A is the group most frequently associated with the founding of gangsta rap. Their lyrics were more violent, openly confrontational, and shocking than those of established rap acts, featuring incessant profanity and, controversially, use of the word &quot;nigger&quot;. These lyrics were placed over rough, rock guitar-driven beats, contributing to the music's hard-edged feel. The first blockbuster gangsta rap album was N.W.A's ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'', released in 1988. ''Straight Outta Compton'' would establish [[West Coast hip hop]] as a vital genre, and establish [[Los Angeles]] as a legitimate rival to hip hop's long-time capital, New York City. ''Straight Outta Compton'' sparked the first major controversy regarding hip hop lyrics when their song &quot;[[Fuck tha Police]]&quot; earned a letter from [[FBI]] Assistant Director, Milt Ahlerich, strongly expressing [[police|law enforcement]]'s resentment of the song.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Ryan |last=Ritchie |title=Eazy to be hard |url=http://www.presstelegram.com/entertainment/ci_5315527 |work=Press Telegram |publisher=Los Angeles Newspaper group |date=2007-02-28 |accessdate=2008-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rap, Rock, and Censorship: Popular Culture and the Technologies of Justice. |last=Deflem |first=Mathieu |url=http://deflem.blogspot.com/1993/08/rap-rock-and-censorship-1993.html |accessdate=2012-07-21 |year=1993 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the influence of Ice T and N.W.A, gangsta rap is often credited as being an originally West Coast phenomenon, despite the contributions of East Coast acts like [[Boogie Down Productions]] in shaping the genre.

The subject matter inherent in gangsta rap has caused a great deal of controversy. Criticism has come from both [[left wing]] and [[right wing]] commentators, and [[religion|religious leaders]]. Gangsta rappers often defend themselves by saying that they are describing the reality of inner-city life, and that they are only adopting a character, like an actor playing a role, which behaves in ways that they may not necessarily endorse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilpvideo.com/video.php?v=MzQ4MA |title=Cam'ron on The O'Reilly Factor |publisher=iLPvideo.com |date= |accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|It was 10 years ago that [[the Sugarhill Gang]]'s &quot;[[Rapper's Delight]]&quot; became the first rap single to enter the national Top 20. Who ever figured then that the music would even be around in 1990, much less produce attractions that would command as much pop attention as Public Enemy and [[N.W.A]]? &quot;Rapper's Delight&quot; was a novelty record that was considered by much of the pop community simply as a lightweight offshoot of disco—and that image stuck for years. Occasional records—including [[Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five|Grandmaster Flash]]'s &quot;[[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|The Message]]&quot; in 1982 and [[Run–D.M.C.|Run-DMC]]'s &quot;[[It's like That (Run–D.M.C. song)|It's Like That]]&quot; in 1984—won critical approval, but rap, mostly, was dismissed as a passing fancy—too repetitious, too one dimensional. Yet rap didn't go away, and an explosion of energy and imagination in the late '80s leaves rap today as arguably the most vital new street-oriented sound in pop since the birth of rock in the '50s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hilburn020490&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Hilburn|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Hilburn|date=February 4, 1990|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-04/entertainment/ca-470_1_public-enemy|title=Rap—The Power and the Controversy : Success has validated pop's most volatile form, but its future impact could be shaped by the continuing Public Enemy uproar|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|location=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2012-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Record labels based out of [[Atlanta]], [[St. Louis]], and [[New Orleans]] gained fame for their local scenes. The [[midwest rap]] scene was also notable, with the fast vocal styles from artists such as [[Bone Thugs-n-Harmony]], [[Tech N9ne]], and [[Twista]]. By the end of the decade, hip hop was an integral part of popular music, and many American pop songs had hip hop components.

=== World hip hop ===

In [[Haiti]], hip hop was developed in the early 1980s, and is mostly accredited to Master Dji and his songs &quot;Vakans&quot; and &quot;Politik Pa m&quot;.  What later became known as &quot;Rap Kreyòl&quot; grew in popularity in the late 1990s with King Posse and Original Rap Stuff.  Due to cheaper recording technology and flows of equipment to Haiti, more Rap Kreyòl groups are recording songs, even after the January 12th earthquake.

In the [[Dominican Republic]], a recording by Santi Y Sus Duendes and [[Lisa M]] became the first single of [[merenrap]], a fusion of hip hop and [[merengue music|merengue]].
[[File:De La Soul Demon Days Live crop.jpg|thumb|left|[[De La Soul]] at [[Demon Days Live]] in 2005]]
New York City experienced a heavy Jamaican hip hop influence during the 1990s. This influence was brought on by cultural shifts particularly because of the heightened immigration of Jamaicans to New York City and the American-born Jamaican youth who were coming of age during the 1990s.

In Europe, Africa, and Asia, hip hop began to move from the underground to mainstream audiences. In Europe, hip hop was the domain of both ethnic nationals and immigrants. [[British hip hop]], for example, became a genre of its own and spawned artists such as [[Wiley (rapper)|Wiley]], [[Dizzee Rascal]], [[The Streets]] and many more. [[Germany]] produced the well-known [[Die Fantastischen Vier]] as well as several [[Turkish people|Turkish]] performers like the controversial [[Cartel (rap group)|Cartel]], [[Kool Savas|Kool Savaş]], and [[Azad (rapper)|Azad]]. Similarly, [[France]] has produced a number of native-born stars, such as [[IAM (band)|IAM]] and [[Suprême NTM]], [[MC Solaar]], [[Rohff]], [[Rim'K]] or [[Booba]]. In the [[Netherlands]], important nineties rappers include The [[Osdorp Posse]], a crew from [[Amsterdam]], [[Extince]], from [[Oosterhout]], and [[Postmen]]. [[Italy]] found its own rappers, including [[Jovanotti]] and [[Articolo 31]], grow nationally renowned, while the Polish scene began in earnest early in the decade with the rise of [[PM Cool Lee]]. In [[Romania]], [[B.U.G. Mafia]] came out of [[Bucharest]]'s [[Pantelimon, Bucharest|Pantelimon]] neighborhood, and their brand of gangsta rap underlines the parallels between life in Romania's Communist-era apartment blocks and in the housing projects of America's ghettos. [[Israel]]'s hip hop grew greatly in popularity at the end of the decade, with several stars both [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] ([[Tamer Nafar]]) and [[Israeli people|Israeli]] ([[Subliminal (rapper)|Subliminal]]). In [[Portugal]] hip hop has his own kind of rapping, which is more political and underground scene, they are known for [[Valete]], [[Dealema]] and [[Halloween]]. [[Russian hip hop]] emerged during last years of [[Soviet Union]] and cemented later, with groups like [[Malchishnik]] and [[Bad Balance]] enjoying mainstream popularity in the 1990s, while [[Ligalize]] and [[Kasta]] were popular in the 2000s.

In Asia, mainstream stars rose to prominence in the [[Philippines]], led by [[Francis Magalona]], Rap Asia, MC Lara and Lady Diane. In Japan, where underground rappers had previously found a limited audience, and popular [[teen idol]]s brought a style called J-rap to the top of the charts in the middle of the 1990s.

Latinos had played an integral role in the early development of hip hop, and the style had spread to parts of Latin America, such as Cuba, early in its history. Later in the decade, with Latin rap groups like [[Cypress Hill]] on the American charts, Mexican rap rock groups, such as [[Control Machete]], rose to prominence in their native land. An annual Cuban hip hop concert held at [[Alamar]] in [[Havana]] helped popularize Cuban hip hop, beginning in 1995. Hip hop grew steadily more popular in Cuba, because of official governmental support for musicians.

[[Brazilian hip hop]] is heavily associated with racial and economic issues in the country, where a lot of [[Afro-Brazilian|black people]] live in a bad situation in the violent slums, known in [[Brazil]] as [[favela]]s. [[São Paulo]] is where [[hip hop]] began in the country, but it soon spread all over Brazil, and today, almost every big Brazilian city, such as [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]], [[Curitiba]], [[Porto Alegre]], [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Recife]] and [[Brasilia]], has a [[hip hop]] scene. Some notable artists include: [[Racionais MC's]], Thaide, and [[Marcelo D2]]

[[Bosnian and Herzegovinan hip hop]] is currently dominated by [[Edo Maajka]], the most popular rapper of the Balkans. In that region, especially Bosnia, hip hop is still used as a political and social message in song themes such as war, profiteering, corruption,etc... [[Frenkie]] another Bosnian rapper, who is associated and the closest worker with Edo Maajka, has collaborated beyond Bosnians boarders. Frenkie collaborated with German artists such as Flip Star, Cika Reks and others. Frenkie also collaborated on his latest album, [[Protuotrov]], with [[Masta Ace]], the song is Zivili (lived).

[[File:Snoop Dogg at City Stages.jpg|thumb|upright|Snoop Dogg]]

After [[N.W.A]] broke up, [[Dr. Dre]] (a former member) released ''[[The Chronic]]'' in 1992, which peaked at #1 on the R&amp;B/hip hop chart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r70573|pure_url=yes}} |title=((( The Chronic &gt; Charts &amp; Awards &gt; Billboard Albums ))) |publisher=allmusic |date=1992-12-15 |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; #3 on the pop chart and spawned a #2 pop single with &quot;[[Nuthin' but a 'G' Thang]].&quot; ''The Chronic'' took West Coast rap in a new direction,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first=Havelock |last=Nelson |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/album/111976/review/18944957/thechronic |title=The Chronic : Dr. Dre : Review |work=Rolling Stone |date=1993-03-18 |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; influenced strongly by [[P funk]] artists, melding smooth and easy funk beats with slowly drawled lyrics. This came to be known as [[G-funk]] and dominated mainstream hip hop for several years through a roster of artists on [[Death Row Records]], including [[Tupac Shakur]], whose double disc album ''[[All Eyez on Me]]'' was a big hit with hit songs &quot;[[Ambitionz az a Ridah]]&quot; and &quot;[[2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted]]&quot;, {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} and [[Snoop Dogg]], whose ''[[Doggystyle]]'' included the songs &quot;[[What's My Name? (Snoop Doggy Dogg song)|What's My Name?]]&quot; and &quot;[[Gin and Juice]]&quot;, both top ten hits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/bio/index.jsp?pid=33952 |title=Snoop Dogg Music News &amp; Info &amp;#124; |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Los Angeles-based label [[Death Row Records]] built an empire around [[Dr. Dre]], [[Snoop Dogg]], and the charismatic, complicated rapper-actor [[Tupac Shakur]]. It also entered into a rivalry with New York City’s [[Bad Boy Records]]. (See the article on the [[East Coast-West Coast hip hop rivalry]].)

Detached from this scene were other artists such as [[Freestyle Fellowship]], [[The Pharcyde]] as well as more underground artists such as the [[Solesides]] collective ([[DJ Shadow]] and [[Blackalicious]] amongst others) [[Jurassic 5]], [[Ugly Duckling (hip hop group)|Ugly Duckling]], [[People Under the Stairs]], [[Tha Alkaholiks]], and earlier [[Souls of Mischief]] represented a return to hip hop roots of sampling and well planned rhyme schemes.

==== East Coast hip hop ====
{{Main|East Coast hip hop}}

In the early 1990s East Coast hip hop was dominated by the [[Native Tongues]] posse which was loosely composed of [[De La Soul]] with producer [[Prince Paul]], [[A Tribe Called Quest]], the [[Jungle Brothers]], as well as their loose affiliates [[3rd Bass]], [[Main Source]], and the less successful [[Black Sheep (hip hop group)|Black Sheep]] &amp; [[KMD]]. Although originally a &quot;daisy age&quot; conception stressing the positive aspects of life, darker material (such as De La Soul's thought-provoking &quot;Millie Pulled a Pistol on Santa&quot;) soon crept in.

Artists such as [[Masta Ace]] (particularly for ''[[SlaughtaHouse]]'') &amp; [[Brand Nubian]], [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]], [[Organized Konfusion]], [[Ingnacio Bernal]], had a more overtly militant pose, both in sound and manner. [[Biz Markie]], the &quot;clown prince of hip hop&quot;, was causing himself and all other hip-hop producers a problem with his appropriation of the [[Gilbert O'Sullivan]] song &quot;Alone again, naturally&quot;.
[[File:Wu-Tang Clan - Virgin Festival.jpg|thumb|Wu-Tang Clan at the Virgin Festival in 2007.]]
In the early-1990s, the [[Wu-Tang Clan]] revitalized the New York hip hop scene by pioneering an East coast [[hardcore rap]] equivalent to what was being produced on the West Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.allmusic.com/explore/style/hardcore-rap-d2918 |title=Hardcore Rap : Significant Albums, Artists and Songs, Most Viewed |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Allmusic, the production on two [[Mobb Deep]] albums, ''[[The Infamous]]'' and ''[[Hell on Earth (Mobb Deep album)|Hell on Earth]]'' (1996), are &quot;indebted&quot; to RZA's early production with Wu-Tang Clan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Theinfamous&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Huey | first = Steve | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r212044|pure_url=yes}} | title = The Infamous at Allmusic | work = | publisher = | accessdate = January 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hellonearth&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Huey | first = Steve | url = {{Allmusic|class=album|id=r244016|pure_url=yes}} | title = Hell on Earth at Allmusic | work = | publisher = | accessdate = January 1, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The success of artists such as [[Nas]] and [[Notorious B.I.G.]] during 1994–95 cemented the status of the East Coast during a time of West Coast dominance.

The productions of [[RZA]], particularly for [[Wu-Tang Clan]], became influential with artists such as [[Mobb Deep]] due to the combination of somewhat detached instrumental loops, highly compressed and processed drums and [[gangsta rap|gangsta]] lyrical content. Wu-Tang solo albums such as [[Raekwon the Chef]]'s ''[[Only Built 4 Cuban Linx]]'', [[Ghostface Killah]]'s [[Ironman (album)|Ironman]], and [[GZA]]'s ''[[Liquid Swords]]'' are now viewed as classics along with Wu-Tang &quot;core&quot; material. The clan's base extended into further groups called Wu-affiliates.

Producers such as [[DJ Premier]] (primarily for [[Gangstarr]] but also for other affiliated artists such as [[Jeru the Damaja]]), [[Pete Rock]] (With [[CL Smooth]] and supplying beats for many others), [[Buckwild]], [[Large Professor]], [[Diamond D]] and [[The 45 King]] supplying beats for numerous MCs regardless of location.

Albums such as [[Nas]]'s ''[[Illmatic]]'', [[Jay-Z]]'s ''[[Reasonable Doubt]]'' and [[O.C. (rapper)|O.C.]]'s ''[[Word...Life]]'' are made up of beats from this pool of producers.

The rivalry between the East Coast and the West Coast rappers eventually turned personal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/notorious_murders/celebrity/shakur_BIG/2a.html |title=The Murders of gangsta rappers Tupac Shakur and Notorious B.I.G. - Crime Library on truTV.com |publisher=Trutv.com |date=1994-11-30 |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the decade the business acumen of the [[Bad Boy Records]] tested itself against [[Jay-Z]] and his [[Roc-A-Fella Records]] and, on the West Coast, [[Death Row Records]]. The mid to late 1990s saw a generation of rappers such as the members of [[D.I.T.C.]] such as the late [[Big L]] and [[Big Pun]].

On the East Coast, although the &quot;big business&quot; end of the market dominated matters commercially the late 1990s to early
2000s saw a number of relatively successful East Coast indie labels such as [[Rawkus Records]] (with whom [[Mos Def]] and Talib Kweli gained great success) and later [[Def Jux]]; the history of the two labels is intertwined, the latter having been started by [[EL-P]] of [[Company Flow]] in reaction to the former, and offered an outlet for more underground artists such as [[Mike Ladd]], [[Aesop Rock]], [[Mr Lif]], [[RJD2]], [[Cage (rapper)|Cage]] and [[Cannibal Ox]]. Other acts such as the Hispanic [[Arsonists (rap group)|Arsonists]] and [[slam poet]] turned MC [[Saul Williams]] met with differing degrees of success.

=== Diversification of styles ===
{{Further|List of hip hop genres}}

In the 1990s, hip hop began to diversify with other regional styles emerging on the national scene. [[Southern rap]] became popular in the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jackson Free Press&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.jacksonfreepress.com/index.php/site/comments/southern_hip_hop_090308/|title=Southern Hip-Hop|last=Burks|first=Maggie|date=2008-09-03|work=Jackson Free Press|accessdate=2008-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first Southern rappers to gain national attention were the [[Geto Boys]] out of Houston, Texas.&lt;ref name=&quot;Houston Press&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2005-05-05/music/mouth-of-the-dirty-south/|title=Mouth of the South|last=Lomax|first=John|date=2005-05-05|work=Houston Press|accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Southern rap's roots can be traced to the success of Geto Boy's ''[[Grip It! On That Other Level]]'' in 1989, the [[Rick Rubin]] produced ''[[The Geto Boys (album)|The Geto Boys]]'' in 1990, and ''[[We Can't Be Stopped]]'' in 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dirty South&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/music/2011/03/excerpt_dirty_s.php|title=Dirty South|last=Westhoff|first=Ben|date=2011-03-18|work=Village Voice|accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Houston area also produced other artists that pioneered the early southern rap sound such as [[UGK]] and the solo career of [[Scarface (rapper)|Scarface]].

Artists from [[Atlanta, Georgia]] were key in further expanding rap music and bringing southern hip hop into the mainstream.  Releases such as [[Arrested Development (hip hop group)|Arrested Development]]'s ''[[3 Years, 5 Months &amp; 2 Days in the Life Of...]]'' in 1992, [[Goodie Mob]]'s ''[[Soul Food (Goodie Mob album)|Soul Food]]'' in 1995 and [[OutKast]]'s ''[[ATLiens]]'' in 1996 were all critically acclaimed.  Later, [[Master P]] (''[[Ghetto D]]'') built up a roster of artists (the [[No Limit Records|No Limit]] posse) based out of [[New Orleans]]. Master P incorporated [[G funk]] and [[Miami bass]] influences; and distinctive regional sounds from [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]], [[Washington D.C.]], [[Detroit]] and others began to gain popularity.

In the 1990s, elements of hip hop continued to be assimilated into other genres of popular music. [[Neo soul]], for example, combined hip hop and [[soul music]]. In the 1980s and 1990s, [[rap rock]], [[rapcore]] and [[rap metal]], fusions of hip hop and [[rock music|rock]], [[hardcore punk]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Ambrose&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ambrose |first=Joe |title=The Violent World of Moshpit Culture |year=2001 |page=5 |chapter=Moshing – An Introduction |chapterurl= |publisher=Omnibus Press |isbn=0-7119-8744-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; became popular among mainstream audiences. [[Rage Against the Machine]] and [[Limp Bizkit]] were among the most well-known bands in these fields.

[[Digable Planets]]' 1993 release ''[[Reachin' (A New Refutation of Time and Space)]]'' was an influential [[jazz rap]] record sampling the likes of [[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]], [[Sonny Rollins]], [[Art Blakey]], [[Herbie Mann]], [[Herbie Hancock]], [[Grant Green]], and [[Rahsaan Roland Kirk]]. It spawned the hit single &quot;Rebirth of Slick (Cool Like Dat)&quot; which reached #16 on the Billboard Hot 100&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/digable-planets/22775#/artist/digable-planets/22775 |title=Digable Planets Music News &amp; Info |publisher=Billboard.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though white rappers like the [[Beastie Boys]], [[House of Pain]] and [[3rd Bass]] had had some popular success or critical acceptance from the hip hop community, [[Eminem]]'s success, beginning in 1999 with the platinum ''[[The Slim Shady LP]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r397821|pure_url=yes}} |title=The Slim Shady LP &gt; Charts &amp; Awards &gt; Billboard Albums |publisher=allmusic |date=1999-02-23 |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; surprised many.

== 2000s and 2010s ==
[[File:Eminem performing live at dj hero party.jpg|thumb|upright||Eminem performing live at the ''[[DJ Hero]]'' Party in Los Angeles.]]

The popularity of hip hop music continued through the 2000s. Dr. Dre remained an important figure, and in the year 2000 produced, ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'' by [[Eminem]].  Dre also produced [[50 Cent]]'s, 2003 album ''[[Get Rich or Die Tryin' (album)|Get Rich or Die Tryin']]'' which debuted at number one on the [[Billboard 200|U.S. Billboard 200]] charts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.billboard.com/#/album/50-cent/get-rich-or-die-tryin/567925&lt;/ref&gt;

Hip hop influences also found their way increasingly into mainstream pop during this period mainly the mid 2000s, as the Los Angeles style of the 1990s lost power. [[Nelly]]'s debut LP, ''[[Country Grammar]]'', sold over nine million copies. In the 2000s, [[crunk]] music, a derivative of Southern hip hop, gained considerable popularity via the likes of [[Lil Jon]] and the [[Ying Yang Twins]]. [[Jay-Z]] represented the cultural triumph of hip hop. As his career progressed, he went from performing artist to label president, head of a clothing line, club owner, and market consultant—along the way breaking Elvis Presley’s record for most number one albums on the Billboard magazine charts by a solo artist.

In addition to the mainstream success, the United States also saw the success of [[alternative hip hop]] in the form of performers such as [[The Roots]], [[Dilated Peoples]], [[Gnarls Barkley]] and [[Mos Def]], who achieved significant recognition. Gnarls Barkley's album ''[[St. Elsewhere (album)|St. Elsewhere]]'', which contained a fusion of funk, neo soul and hip hop, debuted at number 20 on the Billboard 200 charts. In addition, [[Aesop Rock]]'s 2007 album ''[[None Shall Pass]]'' was well received,&lt;ref&gt;{{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1078358|pure_url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reached #50 on the Billboard charts.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Cohen, [http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003635057 &quot;'High School Musical 2' Starts Third Week At No. 1&quot;], Billboard.com, September 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World and national music ===

The continuation of hip hop can also be seen in different national contexts. In [[Tanzania]], maintained popular acts of their own in the early 2000s, infusing local styles of [[Afrobeat]] and [[Arabesque (Turkish music)|arabesque]] melodies, dancehall and hip-hop beats, and Swahili lyrics. [[Scandinavia]]n, especially Danish and Swedish, performers became well known outside of their country, while hip hop continued its spread into new regions, including Russia, Japan, Philippines, Canada, China, Korea, India and especially Vietnam. Of particular importance is the influence on [[East Asia]]n nations, where hip hop music has become fused with local popular music to form different styles such as [[K-pop]], [[C-pop]] and [[J-pop]].

In Germany and France, [[gangsta rap]] has become popular among youths who like the violent and aggressive lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/09/arts/music/09rap.html|title= Germany's Rap Music Veers Toward the Violent|last=Tzortzis|first=Andreas |date= August 9, 2005|work=The New York Times|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some German rappers openly or comically flirt with Nazism, [[Bushido (rapper)|Bushido]] (born Anis Mohamed Youssef Ferchichi) raps &quot;Salutiert, steht stramm, Ich bin der Leader wie A&quot; (Salute, stand to attention, I am the leader like 'A') and [[Fler]] had a hit with the record ''Neue Deutsche Welle'' (New German Wave) complete with the title written in Third Reich style Gothic print and advertised with an [[Adolf Hitler]] quote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article306413.ece |title=Rap music and the far right: Germany goes gangsta, 17 August 2005 |newspaper = The Independent |location=London, United Kingdom |date=2005-08-17 |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; These references also spawned great controversy in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.spiegel.de/kultur/musik/0,1518,356560,00.html |title=Der Spiegel: Scandal Rap, 23 May 2005 |language=German | work=Der Spiegel | publisher=Spiegel.de |date=2005-05-23 |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.laut.de/vorlaut/news/2005/05/13/12218/index.htm |title=Fler: Stolz, Deutsch und rechtsradikal, 13 May 2005 |language=German |publisher=Laut.de |date=2005-05-13 |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile in France, artists like [[Kery James]]' Idéal J maintained a radical, anti-authoritarian attitude and released songs like ''[[Le Combat Continue|Hardcore]]'' which attacked the growth of the French far right.

In the [[Netherlands]], MC [[Brainpower]] went from being an underground battle rapper to mainstream recognition in the [[Benelux]], thus influencing numerous rap artists in the region. In [[Israel]], rapper [[Subliminal (rapper)|Subliminal]] reaches out to Israeli youth with political and religious-themed lyrics, usually with a [[Zionist]] message.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/search/newsAbstract/News/ |title=News |publisher=Rolling Stone |date= |accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the countries outside the US where hip-hop is most popular is the [[United Kingdom]]. In the 2000s a derirative genre from Hip-Hop (as well as [[UK Garage]] and [[Drum and Bass]]) known as [[Grime (music)|Grime]] became popular with artists such as [[Dizzee Rascal]] becoming successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itzcaribbean.com/grime_music.php |title=Grime Music ~ Grime UK |publisher=Itzcaribbean.com |date= |accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is immensely popular, many British politicians criticize the music for what they see as promoting theft and murder, similar to gangsta rap in America. These criticisms have been deemed racist by the mostly [[Black British]] grime industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/5055724.stm |title= Cameron Attacks Radio 1 Hip-Hop | work=BBC News | date=2006-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its controversial nature, grime has had a major effect on British fashion and pop music, with many young working class youth emulating the clothing worn by grime stars like [[Dizzee Rascal]] and [[Wiley (rapper)|Wiley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tuksmagazine.co.uk/ |title= Grime Fashion}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many subgenres of grime, including &quot;Rhythm and Grime,&quot; a mix of R&amp;B and grime, and [[grindie]], a mix of [[indie rock]] and grime popularized by indie rock band [[Hadouken!]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2006/may/05/popandrock |title= When Hood Meets Fringe | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Sophie | last=Heawood | date=2006-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hip hop has globalized into many cultures worldwide, as evident through the emergence of numerous regional scenes. It has emerged globally as a movement based upon the main tennets of hip hop culture. The music and the art continue to embrace, even celebrate, its transnational dimensions while staying true to the local cultures to which it is rooted. Hip-hop's inspiration differs depending on each culture. Still, the one thing virtually all hip hop artists worldwide have in common is that they acknowledge their debt to those [[African American]] people in New York who launched the global movement.&lt;ref&gt;https://moodle.brandeis.edu/file.php/3404/pdfs/kelley-foreword-vinyl-aint-final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; While hip-hop is sometimes taken for granted by Americans, it is not so elsewhere, especially in the developing world, where it has come to represent the empowerment of the disenfranchised and a slice of the American dream. American hip-hop music has reached the cultural corridors of the globe and has been absorbed and reinvented around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Nawotka |first=Edward |url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/reviews/2004-12-09-where-youre-at_x.htm |title=The globalization of hip-hop starts and ends with 'Where You're At' |newspaper = USA Today |date=2004-12-10 |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Crunk and snap music ===
{{Main|Crunk|Snap music}}

Crunk originated in [[Tennessee]] in the 1990s. The style was pioneered and commercialized by artists from [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

Looped, stripped-down [[drum machine]] rhythms are usually used. The [[Roland TR-808]] and [[Roland TR-909|909]] are among the most popular. The drum machines are usually accompanied by simple, repeated synthesizer melodies and heavy bass stabs. The tempo of the music is somewhat slower than hip-hop, around the speed of [[reggaeton]].

The focal point of crunk is more often the beats and music than the lyrics therein. Crunk rappers, however, often shout and scream their lyrics, creating an aggressive, almost heavy, style of hip-hop. While other subgenres of hip-hop address sociopolitical or personal concerns, crunk is almost exclusively party music, favoring call and response hip-hop slogans in lieu of more substantive approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://southernspaces.org/2008/dirty-decade-rap-music-and-us-south-1997-2007|first=Matt |last=Miller |title=Dirty Decade: Rap Music from the South: 1997–2007 |publisher=Southernspaces.org |date=2008-06-10 |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snap music is a subgenre of crunk that emerged from [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vibe Jun 2006, Oh Snap!&quot;&gt;Vibe Jun 2006, &quot;Oh Snap!&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The genre soon gained mainstream popularity and in mid-2005 artists from other southern states such as  [[Tennessee]] began to emerge with this style. Tracks commonly consist of an [[Roland TR-808|808]] [[bassdrum]], [[hi-hat]], [[bass (instrument)|bass]], [[snap (fingers)|snapping]], a main [[groove (music)|groove]] and a vocal track. Hit snap songs include &quot;[[Lean wit It, Rock wit It]]&quot; by &quot;[[Dem Franchize Boyz]]&quot;, &quot;[[Laffy Taffy (song)|Laffy Taffy]]&quot; by [[D4L]], &quot;[[It's Goin' Down (Yung Joc song)|It's Goin' Down]]&quot; by [[Yung Joc]] and &quot;[[Crank That (Soulja Boy)]]&quot; by [[Soulja Boy Tell 'Em]].

=== Glitch hop and wonky music ===
{{Main|Glitch hop|Wonky (music)}}
[[File:The Glitch Mob Live.jpg|right|thumb|The Glitch Mob]]

Glitch hop and Wonky music evolved following the rise of [[trip hop]], [[dubstep]] and [[Intelligent dance music|IDM]]. Both styles of music frequently reflect the experimental nature of IDM and the heavy bass featured in dubstep songs. While trip hop was described as being a distinct British upper-middle class take on hip-hop, glitch-hop and wonky music have featured much more stylistic diversity. Both genres are melting pots of influence, echoes of 1980s pop music, Indian [[raga]]s, eclectic [[jazz]] and [[West Coast rap]] can be heard in glitch hop productions. [[Los Angeles]], [[London]], [[Glasgow]] and a number of other cities have become hot spots for these scenes, and underground scenes have developed across the world in smaller communities. Both genres often pay homage to older and more well established [[electronic music]] artists such as [[Radiohead]], [[Aphex Twin]] and [[Boards of Canada]] as well as independent hip hop producers like [[J Dilla]] and [[Madlib]].

Glitch hop is a fusion genre of hip hop and glitch music that originated in the early to mid 2000s in the United States and Europe. Musically, it is based on irregular, chaotic [[breakbeat]]s, glitchy [[bassline]]s and other typical sound effects used in glitch music, like skips. Glitch hop artists include [[Prefuse 73]], [[Dabrye]] and [[Flying Lotus]].

Wonky is a subgenre of hip hop that originated around 2008, but most notably in the United States and United Kingdom, and among international artists of the [[Hyperdub]] music label, under the influence of glitch hop and dubstep. Wonky music is of the same glitchy type as glitch hop, but it was specifically noted for its melodies, rich with &quot;mid-range unstable synths&quot;. [[Scotland]] has become one of the most prominent places, where wonky music was shaped by artists like [[Hudson Mohawke]] and [[Rustie]].

Glitch hop and wonky are popular among a limited amount of people interested in alternative hip hop and [[electronic music]] (especially dubstep); neither glitch hop nor wonky have met any mainstream popularity, however, artists like [[Flying Lotus]], [[The Glitch Mob]] and [[Hudson Mohawke]] have seen success in other avenues. Flying Lotus's music has earned multiple positive reviews on the independent music review site [[Pitchfork.com]] as well as a prominent (yet uncredited) spot during [[Adult Swim]] commercial breaks. Hudson Mohawke is one of few glitch hop artists to play at major music festivals such as [[Sasquatch! Music Festival]].

=== Decline in sales ===

Starting in 2005, sales of hip hop music in the [[United States]] began to severely wane, leading ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine to question if mainstream hip-hop was &quot;dying.&quot; Billboard Magazine found that, since 2000, rap sales dropped 44%, and declined to 10% of all music sales, which, while still a commanding figure when compared to other genres, is a significant drop from the 13% of all music sales where rap music regularly placed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futuremusic.com/news/april2007/musictrends-hiphop.html |title=After 21% Decline In Sales, Rap Industry Takes A Hard Look At Itself|publisher=Futuremusic.com |date=2006-04-09 |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ta-Nehisi Coates Friday, Aug. 17, 2007 |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1653639,00.html |title=Hip-Hop's Down Beat |magazine=TIME magazine |date=2007-08-17 |accessdate=2010-01-12 | work=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Courtland Milloy of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', for the first time on five years, no rap albums were among the top 10 sellers in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Milloy, Courtland. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/18/AR2007091801807_2.html &quot;Gangsta Rap, Dying in the Street&quot;]. The Washington Post, September 19, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[NPR]] culture critic Elizabeth Blair noted that, &quot;some industry experts say young people are fed up with the violence, degrading imagery and lyrics.&quot; However, the 2005 report ''Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8–18 Year-Olds'' found that hip hop music is by far the most popular music genre for children and teenagers, with 65 percent of 8- to-18-year-olds listening to it on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;Rideout, Victoria, Donald F. Roberts and Ulla F. Foehr (2005). [http://www.kff.org/entmedia/upload/Executive-Summary-Generation-M-Media-in-the-Lives-of-8-18-Year-olds.pdf ''Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8–18 Year-Olds'']. Menlo Park, CA: Kaiser Family Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others say the music is just as popular as it ever was, but that fans have found other means to consume the music.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=7834732 |title=Is Hip-Hop Dying Or Has It Moved Underground? |publisher=National Public Radio – All Things Considered | first=Elizabeth |last=Blair |date=March 11, 2007 |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be argued that many young people now download music illegally, especially through P2P networks, instead of purchasing albums and singles from legitimate stores. For example, [[Flo Rida]] is known for his low album sales regardless of his singles being mainstream and having digital success. His second album ''[[R.O.O.T.S.]]'' sold only 200,000+ total units in the U.S., which could not line up to the sales of the album's lead single &quot;[[Right Round]]&quot;. This also happened to him in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/music_blog/2009/04/better-as-a-song-or-a-ring-tone.html |title=Better as a song or a ring tone|work=Los Angeles Times |first = Todd |last=Martens|accessdate=April 30, 2009 | date=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some put the blame on the lack of lyrical content that hip hop once had, another example is [[Soulja Boy Tell 'Em]]'s 2007 debut album ''[[souljaboytellem.com]]'' was met with negative reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.djbooth.net/index/albums/review/soulja-boy-tell-em-souljaboytellemcom-1002072/ |title=Soulja Boy Tell ‘Em – Souljaboytellem.com – Hip Hop Album Review |publisher=Djbooth.net |date= |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lack of sampling, a key element of hip hop, has also been noted for the decrease in quality of modern albums. For example, there are only four samples used in 2008's ''[[Paper Trail]]'' by [[T.I.]], while there are 35 samples in 1998's ''[[Moment of Truth (Gang Starr album)|Moment of Truth]]'' by [[Gang Starr]]. The decrease in sampling is in part due to it being too expensive for producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://matthewnewton.us/node/775 |title=Is Sampling Dead? &amp;#124; SPIN Magazine &amp;#124; by Matthew Newton &amp;#124; Matthew Newton |publisher=Matthew Newton |first=Matthew |last=Newton |date=2008-12-01 |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Byron Hurt]]'s documentary ''Hip Hop: Beyond Beats and Rhymes'', he claims that hip hop had changed from &quot;clever rhymes and dance beats&quot; to &quot;advocating personal, social and criminal corruption.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Crouch|first=Stanley|date=2008-12-08|title=For the future of hip-hop, all that glitters is not gold teeth|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/opinion/391157_crouchonline09.html|accessdate=2008-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fall in record sales throughout the music industry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article4160553.ece |title=Music sales fall to their lowest level in over twenty years |work=The Times |location=London, United Kingdom |date=June 18, 2008 |first = Dan |last=Sabbagh |accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; hip-hop has remained a popular genre, with hip-hop artists still regularly topping the [[Billboard 200]] Charts.

=== Innovation and revitalization ===
[[File:Kanyewestdec2008.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kanye West]] performing in 2008]]

It was in the later 2000s that [[alternative hip hop]] finally secured a place within the mainstream, due in part to the crossover success of artists such as [[OutKast]], [[Kanye West]], and [[Gnarls Barkley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Michel |first= Sia|title=Critics' Choice: New CD's | url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E7DF1031F93BA2575AC0A9609C8B63| work=[[The New York Times]] | publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] | date=2006-09-18 | accessdate=2008-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only did OutKast's ''[[Speakerboxxx/The Love Below]]'' receive high acclaim from music critics, manage to appeal to listeners of all ages, and span numerous musical genres – including rap, rock, R&amp;B, punk, jazz, indie, country, pop, electronica and gospel&amp;nbsp;– but it also spawned two number-one hit singles and has been [[RIAA certification|certified]] [[Music recording sales certification|diamond]] by selling 11 times [[Music recording sales certification|platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] for shipping more than 11 million units,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gold and Platinum&amp;nbsp;– Diamond Awards |publisher=Recording Industry Association of America |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070516220738/http://www.riaa.com/gp/bestsellers/diamond.asp |archivedate=2007-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming one of the best selling hip-hop albums of all time as well as winning a [[Grammy Award]] for [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] at the [[46th Annual Grammy Awards]] being only the second rap album to do so. Industry observers view the [[Graduation (album)#Commercial performance|sales race]] between Kanye West's ''[[Graduation (album)|Graduation]]'' and [[50 Cent]]'s ''[[Curtis (50 Cent album)|Curtis]]'' as a turning point for hip hop. West emerged the victor, selling nearly a million copies in the first week alone, proving that innovative rap music could be just as commercially viable as gangsta rap, if not more so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sexton, Paul|url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/news/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003641886|title=Kanye Defeats 50 Cent On U.K. Album Chart|work= Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|date=2007-09-17|accessdate=2012-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he designed it as a melancholic [[pop music|pop]] rather than rap, Kanye's following ''[[808s &amp; Heartbreak]]'' would have a significant effect on hip hop music. While his decision to sing about love, loneliness, and heartache for the entirety of the album was at first heavily criticized by music audiences and the album predicted to be a flop, its subsequent critical acclaim and commercial success encouraged other mainstream rappers to take greater creative risks with their music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reid |first=Shaheem |title= Common Praises Kanye's Singing; Lupe Fiasco Plays CEO: Mixtape Monday |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1596254/20081003/common.jhtml |work=MTV|publisher=MTV Networks|date=2008-10-03 |accessdate=2008-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Observer&gt;{{Cite news|title= Urban Review: Kanye West, ''808s and Heartbreak'' |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/nov/09/kanye-west-hip-hop-808s-heartbreak|work=[[The Observer]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media Ltd |date=2008-11-09|accessdate=2008-11-24 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the release of ''[[The Blueprint 3]]'', [[New York]] rap mogul [[Jay-Z]] revealed that next studio album would be an experimental effort, stating, &quot;... it's not gonna be a #1 album.

The alternative hip hop movement is not limited only to the United States, as rappers such as [[Somali people|Somali]]-[[Canada|Canadian]] poet [[K'naan]], [[Japan]]ese rapper [[Shing02]], and [[Sri Lankan British]] artist [[M.I.A.

Several artists such as [[Kid Cudi]] and [[Drake (rapper)|Drake]] have managed to attain chart-topping hit songs, &quot;[[Day 'n' Night]]&quot; and &quot;[[Best I Ever Had (Drake song)|Best I Ever Had]]&quot; respectively,by releasing their music on free online [[mixtape]]s without the help of a major record label. New artists such as [[Wale (rapper)|Wale]], [[J. Cole]], [[Lupe Fiasco]], [[The Cool Kids]], [[Jay Electronica]], and [[B.o.B]], some of whom mention being directly influenced by their nineties alt-rap predecessors, in addition to the southern rap sound, while their music has been noted by critics as expressing eclectic sounds, life experiences, and emotions rarely seen in mainstream hip hop.&lt;ref name=Soul&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoard |first=Christian |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=17 September 2009|title= Kid Cudi: Hip-Hop's Sensitive Soul|trans_title= |journal=Rolling Stone|volume= |issue= 1087|page=40 |id= |url= |accessdate=2009-09-09 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/14/arts/music/14cara.html?pagewanted=all | work=New York Times | title=The Mining of Hip-Hop’s Golden Age  | date=2008-09-12 | accessdate=2012-07-18 | first1=Jon | last1=Caramanica}}&lt;/ref&gt;
