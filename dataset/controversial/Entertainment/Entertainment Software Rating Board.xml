The '''Entertainment Software Rating Board''' ('''ESRB''') is a [[self-regulatory organization]] that assigns age and content ratings, enforces industry-adopted [[advertising]] guidelines, and ensures responsible online privacy principles for [[Video game|computer and video games]] in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://vgstrategies.about.com/od/faq/a/ESRBRatings.htm |title=ESRB Video Game Ratings and Video Game Content Descriptors |publisher=[[About.com]] |year=2005 |first=Jason |last=Rybka |accessdate=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ESRB was established in 1994 by the [[Entertainment Software Association]] (formerly Interactive Digital Software Association), in response to criticism of [[violence|violent]] content found in video games such as ''[[Night Trap]]'', ''[[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'', ''[[Lethal Enforcers]]'', ''[[Doom (video game)|''Doom'']]'', and other [[video game controversy|controversial video games]] portraying overly violent or intense [[sexual intercourse|sexual situations]]. The board assigns ratings to games based on their content, using judgment similar to the [[motion picture rating system]]s used in many countries. In addition, content descriptors explain specific types of content present in games. The ratings are intended to aid consumers in determining a game's content and suitability. A game's rating is generally displayed on its box, in its [[Data storage device|media]], in [[Advertising|advertisements]], and on the game's [[website]].&lt;ref name=&quot;whatesrb&quot;&gt;[http://www.esrb.org/ratings/faq.jsp#1 What is the ESRB?] from the ESRB FAQ&lt;/ref&gt; By July 2012 it had assigned more than 22,000 ratings to titles submitted by more than 350 [[video game publisher|publishers]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esrb.org/ratings/search.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the rating system is nominally voluntary, nearly all video games are submitted for rating. Many retail stores prohibit the sale of unrated video games, and major [[console manufacturer]]s will not license games for their systems unless they carry ESRB ratings.

==History==
Video games' progression into the [[History of video game consoles (fourth generation)|16-bit]] era brought dramatic increases in graphics and sound capabilities. Blood and gore, in particular, could be portrayed much more clearly than in [[History of video game consoles (third generation)|8-bit]] games. Whereas blood in an 8-bit game could look blocky and [[pixel]]ated, in a 16-bit game, it can be an easily identified fluid graphic. The release of games such as ''[[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'', ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Night Trap]]'', and ''[[Lethal Enforcers]]'' resulted in controversy due to violent and otherwise objectionable content. In the [[United States Senate]], [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Senators [[Joe Lieberman]] and [[Herb Kohl]], of [[Connecticut]] and [[Wisconsin]], respectively, led hearings on video game violence and the corruption of society in the early 1990s. Their hearings charged the entertainment software industry with the creation of a working rating system within a year, threatening federal creation of a system if they failed to do so.

Around this time, the [[Videogame Rating Council]] (VRC) was formed by [[Sega]], largely to rate its own games. In 1993, the Interactive Digital Software Association (IDSA) was formed, and [[the 3DO Company]] formed their own rating system, the [[3DO Rating System]], for games released on the [[3DO Interactive Multiplayer]]. In 1994, the [[Recreational Software Advisory Council]] (RSAC) was formed by the [[Software and Information Industry Association|Software Publishers Association]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://penta2.ufrgs.br/gereseg/censura/rsac/dianne1.htm An Alternative to Government Regulation and Censorship: Content Advisory Systems for the Internet] Published Papers&lt;/ref&gt; On July 29, 1994 the proposal from the IDSA for a rating system, the Entertainment Software Rating Board (ESRB) was presented to, and approved by, [[United States Congress|Congress]]&lt;ref name='Wired-kohler-chris-2009-07-29'&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Kohler |title=July 29, 1994: Videogame Makers Propose Ratings Board to Congress |date=29 July 2009 |publisher=''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' |url=http://www.wired.com/thisdayintech/2009/07/dayintech_0729/ |work=[[Cond√© Nast Publications]] |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1994, the ESRB was established, becoming the ''de facto'' rating system for American video games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrb.org/about/index.jsp About ESRB]&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, many companies who produced computer games, such as [[LucasArts]], [[Sierra Entertainment|Sierra On-Line]], and [[3D Realms]] continued to follow the RSAC system, but eventually, all companies agreed to follow the ESRB ratings.

The rating system initially consisted of five different ratings: Early Childhood, Kids to Adults, Teen, Mature, and Adults Only. Shortly thereafter, &quot;Informational&quot; and &quot;Edutainment&quot; descriptors were added. In 1996, the rating icons were altered, adding the &quot;Content Rated by ESRB&quot; text. On January 1, 1998, the Kids to Adults rating was renamed to Everyone. Later that year, the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board Interactive]] (ESRBi) was formed, which rated web sites and online games. In late 1999, in order to make the rating symbols more legible, the pixelated rating icons were replaced with black and white ones. Beginning in early 2001, several content descriptors were retired and replaced. Content descriptors with &quot;Animated&quot; or &quot;Realistic&quot; distinctions in them had those portions removed. The &quot;Skills&quot; descriptors used for the Early Childhood rating were removed as well. A short time later, the Gaming descriptor was changed to Gambling, which itself was split into Real and Simulated Gambling in the following years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://3xgamer.com/2010/01/esrb-playing/ | title=The ESRB: What are you playing? |date=6 January 2010 |accessdate=10 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid 2003, the ESRBi was closed down. On June 26, 2003, content descriptors were made larger and more legible, and newer, more thorough descriptors for violence (Cartoon, Fantasy, Intense) were added as well as a descriptor for Mature Humor. Also, the Mature and Adults Only icons had 17+ and 18+ added to their title band in order to clearly signify the age appropriateness. On March 2, 2005, after conferring with academicians and child development experts, the Everyone 10+ rating was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;A majority of the information in this section was obtained from the archived [http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.esrb.org ESRB website], available at [[Internet Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt; Raters were initially hired on a part-time basis, but as of April 2007, the ESRB employs raters full-time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6166197.html &quot;ESRB hiring full-time raters&quot;] - [[GameSpot]] News, 2007-2-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rating process==
To obtain a rating for a game, a publisher sends the ESRB a DVD containing footage of the most graphic and extreme content found in the game, including content related to the game's context, storyline, reward system and other elements that may affect its rating. The publisher also fills out a questionnaire describing the game's content and pays a fee (which is significantly lower for games with development costs under $1 million). 

For each game, the ESRB employs at least three trained raters who collectively watch the footage sent in by publishers and recommend a rating. ESRB personnel review the footage and all materials to ensure accuracy of the rating, and a certificate is sent to the publisher. A publisher may subsequently edit the game and resubmit the footage and questionnaire in order to achieve a lower rating, or appeal the rating to a committee made up of entertainment software industry representatives. If a publisher chooses to do so, the process begins anew.

When the game is ready for release, the publisher sends copies of the final version of the game to the ESRB. The ESRB reviews the game's packaging, and a random number of games they receive are [[Game testing|play tested]] for more thorough review. Penalties apply to publishers who misrepresent the content of their games, including the potential for fines up to $1 million and a product recall, if deemed necessary.

The identities of the ESRB raters are kept confidential, although they are all full-time ESRB employees who live in the [[New York City]] area. According to the ESRB website, &quot;All ESRB raters are adults who typically have experience with children, whether through prior work experience, education or as parents or caregivers.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;'http://www.esrb.org/ratings/faq.jsp#14&lt;/ref&gt; Raters are supposed to review games as if they were a customer receiving their first glance at the game.&lt;ref&gt;''Parent's Guide to Games'' series, by Craig Wessel&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, the ESRB introduced a streamlined, automated process for assigning ratings for console downloadable games as a way to address the rapidly growing volume of digitally-delivered games.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/arts/video-games/video-games-rating-board-questionnaire.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than having raters review each product, publishers of these games complete a series of multiple-choice questions that address content across relevant categories, including violence, sexual content, language, etc. The responses automatically determine the game's rating category and content descriptors. Games rated via this process may be tested post-release to ensure that content was properly disclosed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.esrb.org/ratings/ratings_process.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ratings==
The symbols ESRB uses are stylized alphabetical letters meant to indicate the game's suitability.

These may include [[adult video game]]s that show sex and graphic nudity, or more violence, blood and gore than the M rating can accommodate. {{As of|2012}}, there have been [[List of AO-rated products|twenty-one products]] that have received and kept the rating. The AO rating is the subject of ongoing controversy due to the extreme restrictions it places on game sales. Games from major publishers that receive an AO rating are often &quot;toned down&quot; in order to gain the lesser rating of M. Companies like [[Microsoft]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Game Rating Information - ESRB - Xbox.com | url = http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Marketplace/gameratings | publisher = [[Microsoft]] | accessdate = 2012-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sony]], and [[Nintendo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sony, Nintendo refuse to allow AO rated games on their consoles |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6172830.html |first=Brendan |last=Sinclair |date=20 June 2007 |accessdate=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; all have policies against allowing AO rated games to be licensed on their consoles. Additionally, most major retailers, even those who carry M-rated games, do not sell AO-rated titles in their stores or through their websites. Consequently, AO-rated games are restricted to the [[PC game|PC]] and [[Mac gaming|Mac]], and sold in limited fashion.

==Mobile App Ratings==
In November 2011, [[CTIA - The Wireless Association]] announced that the ESRB had been selected to develop and administer a rating system specifically designed for mobile apps. Founding storefronts for this initiative include AT&amp;T, Microsoft, Sprint, T-Mobile USA, U.S. Cellular and Verizon Wireless.&lt;ref&gt;[http://techcrunch.com/2011/11/29/ctia-and-esrb-debuts-app-rating-system-no-buy-in-from-google-or-apple/ CTIA and ESRB Debuts App Rating System - TechCrunch, Nov. 29, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The &quot;CTIA Mobile Application Rating System with ESRB&quot; assigns ratings via a brief questionnaire that assess the app's content,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/128390/ESRB_CTIA_Detail_Voluntary_Mobile_App_Rating_System.php ESRB, CTIA Detail Voluntary Mobile App Rating System - Gamasutra, Nov. 29, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the one devised by the ESRB for console downloadable games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/18/arts/video-games/video-games-rating-board-questionnaire.html Video Games Rating Board Questionnaire - New York Times, April 18, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The ESRB app ratings use the same age rating icons (with the exception of the &quot;Early Childhood&quot; category) and similar content descriptors as the ESRB's traditional game rating system. Apps are also assigned notices that advise of other elements parents might want to be aware of, including the sharing of the user's location or their personal information, or possible exposure to user-generated content. According to a guide posted on ESRB's website, these notices include &quot;Shares Info,&quot; &quot;Shares Location,&quot; and &quot;Users Interact.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrb.org/ratings/mobileapp_ratings_guide.jsp CTIA Mobile Application Rating System with ESRB - accessed at ESRB.org on August 30, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Participating storefronts &quot;may display any or all of the components of an app's rating prior to download and/or utilize this information as filtering criteria.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomsguide.com/us/ESRB-CTIA-The-Wireless-Association-Rating-System-Verizon,news-16041.html Verizon Now Using CTIA Mobile Application Rating System - Tom's Guide, August 15, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2012 the ESRB had assigned ratings to more than 100 mobile apps&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrb.org/ratings/search.jsp ESRB Rating Search accessed September 26, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and its ratings could be found in the Windows Phone Marketplace,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neogamr.net/news/windows-phone-marketplace-adds-esrb-ratings Windows Phone Marketplace Adds ESRB Ratings - Neogaf, Jan. 30, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; T-Mobile Mall, and Verizon Apps - which was the first to adopt ESRB ratings for all apps available in their storefront.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mobileburn.com/20305/news/verizon-applies-esrb-ratings-to-its-app-and-game-catalog Verizon Applies ESRB Ratings to its App and Game Catalog - Mobileburn, Aug. 14, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising &amp; Marketing Guidelines==
In addition to assigning ratings the ESRB also enforces guidelines that have been adopted by the video game industry in order to ensure responsible advertising and marketing practices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrb.org/ratings/principles_guidelines.jsp ESRB Principles &amp; Guidelines for Responsible Advertising Practices - ESRB.org]&lt;/ref&gt; These include ensuring that game packaging and advertisements properly display rating information and restricting where ads for games rated T or higher can appear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esrb.org/ratings/enforcement.jsp ESRB Enforcement System, ESRB.org]&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the ESRB to restrict video game advertising &quot;to consumers for whom the product is not rated as appropriate.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.esrb.org/ratings/principles_guidlines.jsp Entertainment Software Rating Board Principles and Guidelines for Responsible Advertising Practices]&lt;/ref&gt; The industry's enforcement of advertising and marketing guidelines led the Federal Trade Commission to recognize ESRB as having &quot;the strongest self-regulatory code&quot; of all entertainment sectors in its 2009 Report to Congress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edge-online.com/news/ftc-praises-us-game-regulation-code FTC Praises US Game Regulation Code - Edge Online - December 4, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Video game publishers agree to abide by these guidelines when they receive a rating from the ESRB, and this agreement empowers ESRB to impose fines and other sanctions in cases where a violation of these guidelines has occurred. While ESRB guidelines technically apply only to the companies that submit their products to be rated, online retailers such as [[Steam (content delivery)|Steam]], [[Xbox Live Marketplace]], [[PlayStation Network]], and the [[Wii Shop Channel]] ban minors from downloading game demos or [[Trailer (promotion)|trailers]] for games rated Mature or Rating Pending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://majornelson.com/archive/2007/12/26/demos-trailers-and-you.aspx#comments Demos, Trailers and you - Xbox Lives Major Nelson&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

===Overrating===
The ESRB has been noted for frequently overrating video games, giving a game a rating of as much as two grades higher or more than the rating given by the rating organization in its country of origin. For example, the games ''[[God Hand]]'', ''[[Metal Gear Solid: Digital Graphic Novel]]'', ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 3]]'', ''[[Shin Megami Tensei: Persona 4]]'' and ''[[Samurai Shodown: Sen]]'' were all rated B by the CERO, which would technically give them T(13+ or E10+) ratings in North America. However, they were all rated M (17+ - equivalent to CERO's D rating) by the ESRB, a difference of 1-2 grades.  However, the Japanese culture does tolerate violence in video games more than the Americans and Europeans.  A more prominent example is ''[[Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne]]'', which was rated A (all ages) by CERO but M (17+) by the ESRB, a difference of 3 grades. ''[[Ar tonelico Qoga: Knell of Ar Ciel]]'', ''[[Dead or Alive Xtreme 2]]'', ''[[Sexy Poker]]'', the aforementioned ''Nocturne'' and ''Persona 3'' (''Persona 4'' received 16+), and many European RPG's with blood in them were also rated M, even though they were rated 12+ by the PEGI.  However, this is most likely due to some nudity in these games, which europeans find to be less inappropriate than the Americans do.  Also, many games that received 7+ rating by PEGI received E10+ rating by the ESRB, despite the PEGI's 7+ rating actually being closer to the ESRB's E rating, which indicated games appropriate for 6 and up.  However, the ESRB is likely to get sued if a parent thinks that a game is rated too low.  In other countries, however, it is hard to sue a large corporation.  Also,  penalties may be high if one loses a lawsuit.  Nevertheless, video games often have objectionable content censored out for the European and Japanese audiences, while video games almost never have content censored out of them for the North American audience.  On the other hand, many video games have not been overrated (from the standpoint of American cultural beliefs).  Most kid's video games have been given the E rating. Some of these video games have been given a 7+ by PEGI, such as ''[[Wii Sports]]'', ''[[Super Mario World]]'' (Virtual Console release), and ''[[Sonic Adventure]]'' (PSN/XBLA release).  Also, most shooters, many of which contain blood, were rated T, while being given a 16+ by PEGI.  So at many times, PEGI has rated games higher than the ESRB.  Although CERO has been known to rate video games equal to or lower than other companies, CERO has also rated some video games higer than the ESRB.  For example, many street racing video games that have been given an E or E10+ by the ESRB have been rated B by CERO.  Also, ''[[Sonic Adventure 2]]'' was given an E by the ESRB (this game came out before the E10+ rating existed.  The Xbox live arcade/PS Network rerelease was rated E10+ due to bad language in some of the music), but was given a B by CERO. A better example is ''[[Infamous (video game)|Infamous]]'', which was given a T by the ESRB and a Z (equal to the ESRB's AO and PEGI's 18+) by CERO.

===Violence, Gore and the AO and M rating===
The ESRB has often been accused of not rating games harshly enough for violence and other related themes. Games such as ''[[Harvester (video game)|Harvester]]'', ''[[Manhunt (video game)|Manhunt]]'', ''[[Rise of the Triad]]'', ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 game)|Mortal Kombat]]'', [[Resident Evil]], [[GUN (video game)|GUN]], [[Red Dead Redemption]], and ''[[Soldier of Fortune (video game)|Soldier of Fortune]]'', which have shown gruesome violence, received an M rating. Many critics have claimed that these games deserve the AO rating&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2003/11/26/commentary/game_over/column_gaming/ Snuff games and ratings] - [[CNN]]/''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]''.com, November 26, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; and were given the M for commercial reasons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20061023055510/http://www.gameinformer.com/News/Story/200610/N06.1004.1635.57594.htm The Ratings Game: The Controversy Over The ESRB] - [[Game Informer]] magazine, August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The ESRB states that it rates games AO when warranted - even due to violence - and that it is the reality that consoles do not license AO-rated games, but they only sell Rated M games and that retailers generally choose the AO games not to sell them, that causes publishers of AO-rated games to revise and resubmit them in order to obtain the more marketable Mature rating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/168233/ESRB_president_Patricia_Vances_plan_for_a_world_ratings_solution.php?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+GamasutraNews+%28Gamasutra+News%29 ESRB President Patricia Vance's Plan for a World Ratings Solution] - Gamasutra, April 10, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rise of the Triad'' in particular, received the highest violence descriptor: &quot;Wanton and gratuitous violence&quot; from the [[Recreational Software Advisory Council]], which was mitigated by its M rating by the ESRB. The [[Canada|Canadian]] [[Provinces and territories of Canada|provinces]] of [[British Columbia]] and [[Ontario]], their respective provincial governments classified ''Soldier of Fortune'' and ''Manhunt'' as [[film]]s, and gave them [[Canadian motion picture rating system|&quot;Restricted&quot;]] ratings, limiting their sale to adults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2004/03/04/manhunt040304.html |work=CBC News |title=Ontario slaps 'R' rating on video game |date=5 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ESRB has only given out the AO rating for violence alone twice: first for ''[[Thrill Kill]]'' (which was canceled after the developer was bought by [[Electronic Arts]]), and then for ''[[Manhunt 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/news/6172743.html &quot;Manhunt 2 receives AO rating&quot;] - GameSpot News, 2007-06-19.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Punisher (2005 video game)|The Punisher]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080611092718/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000874859 &quot;Video game rating board don't get no respect&quot;] - Paul Hyman, ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'', April 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; was never officially given the AO rating, as it toned down its violent content (by placing the offending scenes in black and white) to receive an M rating. ''Manhunt 2'' was edited before release in order to qualify for an M, though an uncut PC version has since been released with an AO rating. Of particular concern to the ESRB was a scene depicting [[castration]], which was removed entirely from the M-rated console versions of the game. ''[[Thrill Kill]]'' received an AO rating with content descriptors for Animated Violence and Animated Blood and Gore, but was never released after the original publisher, [[Virgin Entertainment]], was purchased by [[Electronic Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-512347.html |title=EA kills 'Thrill Kill' game before release |publisher=[[ZDNet]] |date=15 October 1998 |accessdate=18 December 2006 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061116223732/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-512347.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=16 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GameSpy]] has suggested that ''[[Grand Theft Auto III]]'' (their 2001 Game of the Year) received such treatment from the ESRB, saying &quot;''[[Counter-Strike]]'' is merely [[Cowboys and Indians]] writ large. When you get right down to it, deathmatches are just elaborate games of Tag. GTA 3 is a Thug Simulator... [GTA 3 is] absolutely reprehensible. This is a game that rewards you for causing mayhem. This is a game that is about causing mayhem. It's a game that rewards you for killing innocent people by the dozen.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.gamespy.com/goty2001/special/24.shtml |title=GameSpy.com - Game of the Year Awards - 2001 |publisher=Archive.gamespy.com |date= |accessdate=2012-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty-three products have been given the AO rating without revision for a different rating. ''Peak Entertainment Casinos'' was rated AO for unsimulated [[online gambling]]. Two were given for violence, as aforementioned. The remaining 20 AO games were given rated thus for sexual content or nudity.

===Same-sex relationships===
While some video games and video game series released in Japan will feature same-sex themes or options that allow players to have same-sex relationships with NPCs, some developers will remove such content from the game entirely when submitting it for ESRB review in the U.S., typically out of concern of receiving a more mature rating. The [[Harvest Moon (series)|''Harvest Moon'' series]], for instance, has featured the option to have same-sex relationships only in the original Japanese releases. Another example can be found in [[The Sims]] series; while the Windows versions are notable for their inclusion of same-sex relationships and marriage, [[Game Boy Advance|GBA]] and [[Nintendo DS]] ports of ''The Sims'' games will not allow the player to have any romantic interactions with members of the same sex.

===Hidden content===
{{main|Hot Coffee minigame controversy|ESRB re-rating of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion}}
In 2005, members of the [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]] community discovered that the PC version of ''[[Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas]]'' could be modified to unlock an incomplete sex [[minigame]] known as &quot;Hot Coffee&quot;, which [[Rockstar North]] had decided to leave out of the final game. The discovery of the minigame caused [[California State Assembly]]man [[Leland Yee]] to rebuke both Rockstar and the ESRB, arguing that the ESRB was not doing its job properly. US Senators [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] and Joe Lieberman also expressed their disapproval. Rockstar initially claimed that the minigame was created by the mod community and was not a part of the original game. This was disproven when it was discovered that a third-party cheat device could be used to unlock the &quot;Hot Coffee&quot; scenes in console versions of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4702737.stm |title=Hidden sex scenes hit GTA rating |publisher=BBC News |date=21 July 2005 |accessdate=18 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an investigation the ESRB changed its rating from M to AO, setting a precedent that games can be re-rated due to the presence of pertinent content that exists on the game's disc, even if that content is programmed to not be playable without modification or unauthorized use of a third-party cheat device.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/articles/view/editorials/op-ed/797-Boobies-Did-Not-Break-the-Game-The-ESRB-Clears-the-Air-On-Oblivion '&quot;Boobies Did Not Break the Game&quot;: The ESRB Clears the Air On Oblivion'] from ''[[The Escapist (magazine)|The Escapist]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Although this made ''Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas'' the best selling game to receive an AO rating, Rockstar soon released a patch that disabled the modification on PC versions and re-released the game as ''Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, Second Edition''. The new release disabled all access to the &quot;Hot Coffee&quot; mini-game and was given the game's original M rating by the ESRB as a result.

In 2006, ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' had its rating changed from T to M due to &quot;more detailed depictions of blood and gore than were considered in the original rating, as well as a mod that, if accessed through a third-party modification to the PC version of the game, allows the user to play with topless versions of female characters.&quot; The game's publisher decided not to re-release the game to remove the hidden texture, stating that it believed the original rating was the most accurate assessment of what parents should expect from the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.esrb.org/about/news/downloads/oblivion_release_5.3.06.pdf |title=ESRB Changes Rating For The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion From Teen to Mature |publisher=ESRB |date=3 May 2006 |accessdate=18 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6148897.html |title=Oblivion rerated M for Mature |last=Sinclair |first=Brendan |publisher=[[GameSpot]] News |date=3 May 2006 |accessdate=18 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6148925.html |title=Bethesda responds to Oblivion rerating |publisher=[[GameSpot]] News |date=3 May 2006 |accessdate=18 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rockstar Games]]' ''[[Manhunt 2]]'' was postponed for three months in the United States and several other countries due to its initial AO rating from the ESRB. Numerous edits brought the rating down to M. Less than a week after the release, it was discovered that the PS2 and PSP versions of the game could be modified to erase the [[Patch (computing)|patches]] that censored the violent content. Rockstar Games has since claimed that even with these modifications, many of the scenes were toned down from the original version submitted to the ESRB for rating. As a result, the ESRB chose not to change the game's rating from M. Ultimately, an AO-rated PC version was released by Rockstar as a download exclusive. Similarly, ''The Punisher'' was hacked into to allow uncensored kills, and the PC version had patches to remove the filters and intensify the violence.

===News leaks===
The ESRB typically posts rating information for new titles on its website 30 days after the rating process is complete. This can cause a game's existence to become public information before its official announcement. As a result, the ESRB implemented a process by which publishers with concerns about this practice can request that information about the game not be posted to the ESRB's website until a specific date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.next-gen.biz/news/esrb-reins-premature-game-leaks |title=ESRB Reins In Premature Game Leaks |last=Graft |first=Kris |publisher=Next Generation News |date=19 June 2008 |accessdate=19 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
