'''''Bumfights''''' is a film series [[Film production|produced]] by Indecline Films. The videos feature teenagers, [[homeless]] men (most notably [[Rufus Hannah]] and Donnie Brennan) in the [[San Diego]], [[San Francisco]] and [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] metropolitan areas fighting and attempting amateur [[stunt]]s in exchange for money, [[alcohol]], and other incentives. The first video, ''Bumfights: A Cause for Concern'', was produced by [[Ryen McPherson|Ryan McPherson]], with friends Zachary Bubeck, Daniel J. Tanner, and Michael Slyman, as Indecline Films. Shortly after sales began to escalate, Indecline Films allegedly sold the rights to two investors,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.pollystaffle.com/questionsandanswers/ryenmcpherson2.shtml Ryen McPherson Q&amp;A Part 2 [Bumfights / Indecline / King of the Jews &amp;#93; - Polly Staffle - Movie &amp; DVD Reviews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; who went on to produce three sequels. 

The videos immediately gained criticism from mainstream organizations. The US-based [[National Coalition for the Homeless]] (NCH) has stated that the ''Bumfights'' videos disseminate hate against the homeless and dehumanize them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalhomeless.org National Coalition for the Homeless]&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2006, the four original filmmakers agreed not to produce any more &quot;Bumfights&quot; videos or distribute videos already made, and to pay three homeless men depicted in the videos, under a settlement announced as a lawsuit was to go to trial.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20060406-1743-bumfights.html SignOnSanDiego.com &gt; News &gt; Metro - Homeless men in 'Bumfights' get settlements over video&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
The videos have been banned in a number of countries including the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland|United Kingdom]], [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rcq.gouv.qc.ca/decisions.asp?id=180&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[New Zealand]]. The internet auction site [[eBay]] routinely cancels listings which contain copies of the video, citing their policy which prohibits the sale of materials which promote or glorify violence.&lt;ref&gt;http://pages.ebay.com/help/policies/offensive.html#what&lt;/ref&gt;  In the state of [[California]], both [[felony]] and [[misdemeanor]] charges were filed against the producers, as well as civil lawsuits; in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessethics.ca/blog/2006/09/exploitative-videos-bumfights-girls.html&lt;/ref&gt; the producers were sentenced to six months in prison for having failed to complete the [[community service]] to which they had previously been sentenced.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pollystaffle.com/questionsandanswers/ryenmcpherson2.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; The filmmakers maintain that the production of the video was a mutually beneficial arrangement and that the homeless people depicted freely chose to participate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2002/May-05-Sun-2002/news/18662641.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The films have likewise been blamed for inspiring a number of violent teenage attacks on the homeless, both in the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2006/09/30/State/Killer_cites__Bumfigh.shtml |title= Killer cites 'Bumfights' as influence |accessdate=2008-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}.  A group of suburban [[Nevada]] teenagers, who called themselves &quot;[[311 Boyz]]&quot;, also faced criminal charges, including attempted murder, after filming several violent exploits inspired by ''Bumfights''. The suspects attempted to make a profitable video by instigating fights around their neighborhoods, in some instances imposing on unwilling participants.

==Indecline: Vol. 1 - &quot;It's Worse Than You Think&quot;==
[[Ryen McPherson|Ryan McPherson]], who sold the rights to ''Bumfights'' after the first installment, moved on to produce a similar [[reality tv|reality]] video called ''Indecline: Vol. 1 - It's Worse Than You Think''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indecline.com/ Default PLESK Page&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Though controversial for its fight footage and acts of elaborate [[graffiti art]], legal troubles did not hinder the sales of this video, although the website went offline in June 2008. The Indecline web site went back online on November 2008.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; As of April 2012, the Indecline Films website is still down and has been down for over a year. Ryan has since moved on to his solo project, Stab The Princess.

Indecline also acted as a record label for a few underground acts, most notably the abstract hip-hop duo Ninth Cloud.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myspace.com/ninthcloud MySpace.com - (n1nth)cloud - Denver (soon to be mountains of utah), Colorado - Indie / Hip Hop / Electronica - www.myspace.com/ninthcloud&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
