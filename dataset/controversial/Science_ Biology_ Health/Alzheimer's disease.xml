'''Alzheimer's disease''' ('''AD'''), also known in medical literature as '''Alzheimer disease''', is the most common form of [[dementia]]. There is no cure for the disease, which [[degenerative disease|worsens as it progresses]], and eventually leads to [[Terminal illness|death]]. It was first described by German psychiatrist and neuropathologist [[Alois Alzheimer]] in 1906 and was named after him.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid9661992&quot;/&gt; Most often, AD is diagnosed in people over 65&amp;nbsp;years of age,&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal

Although Alzheimer's disease develops differently for every individual, there are many common symptoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;alzheimers.org&quot;&gt;

The cause and progression of Alzheimer's disease are not well understood. Research indicates that the disease is associated with [[Senile plaques|plaques]] and [[neurofibrillary tangles|tangles]] in the [[brain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15184601&quot;/&gt; Current treatments only help with the symptoms of the disease. There are no available treatments that stop or reverse the progression of the disease. {{as of
|2012}}, more than 1000 [[clinical trials]] have been or are being conducted to find ways to treat the disease, but it is unknown if any of the tested treatments will work.&lt;ref name=&quot;CT&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Because AD cannot be cured and is degenerative, the sufferer relies on others for assistance. The role of the main [[caregiver]] is often taken by the spouse or a close relative.&lt;ref name=&quot;metlife.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Characteristics==
The disease course is divided into four stages, with progressive patterns of [[cognitive]] and [[functional symptom|functional]] [[Disability|impairments]].

===Pre-dementia===
The first symptoms are often mistakenly attributed to [[ageing]] or [[Stress (biological)|stress]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17222085&quot;/&gt; Detailed [[neuropsychological test]]ing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties up to eight years before a person fulfils the clinical criteria for [[diagnosis]] of AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15324363&quot;&gt;{{vcite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most noticeable deficit is memory loss, which shows up as difficulty in remembering recently learned facts and inability to acquire new information.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15324363&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12603249&quot;&gt;{{vcite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subtle problems with the [[executive functions]] of [[attention|attentiveness]], [[planning]], flexibility, and [[abstraction|abstract thinking]], or impairments in [[semantic memory]] (memory of meanings, and concept relationships) can also be symptomatic of the early stages of AD.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15324363&quot;/&gt; [[Apathy]] can be observed at this stage, and remains the most persistent [[neuropsychiatry|neuropsychiatric]] symptom throughout the course of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preclinical stage of the disease has also been termed [[mild cognitive impairment]],&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12603249&quot;/&gt; but whether this term corresponds to a different diagnostic stage or identifies the first step of AD is a matter of dispute.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17279076&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early===
In people with AD the increasing impairment of learning and memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small portion of them, difficulties with language, executive functions, [[perception]] ([[agnosia]]), or execution of movements ([[apraxia]]) are more prominent than memory problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10653284&quot;&gt;

|pmid=10653284
|doi=10.1007/s004060050101
}}&lt;/ref&gt; AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. [[long-term memory|Older memories]] of the person's life ([[episodic memory]]), facts learned ([[semantic memory]]), and [[implicit memory]] (the memory of the body on how to do things, such as using a fork to eat) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1300219&quot;&gt;

[[primary progressive aphasia|Language problems]] are mainly characterised by a shrinking [[vocabulary]] and decreased word [[fluency]], which lead to a general impoverishment of oral and [[written language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10653284&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1856925&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Taler V, Phillips NA |title=Language performance in Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment: a comparative review |journal=J Clin Exp Neuropsychol |volume=30 |issue=5 |pages=501–56 |year=2008 |month=July |pmid=18569251 |doi=10.1080/13803390701550128 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this stage, the person with Alzheimer's is usually capable of communicating basic ideas adequately.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10653284&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1856925&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7967534&quot;&gt;{{vcite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While performing [[fine motor skill|fine motor tasks]] such as writing, drawing or dressing, certain movement coordination and planning difficulties ([[apraxia]]) may be present but they are commonly unnoticed.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10653284&quot;/&gt; As the disease progresses, people with AD can often continue to perform many tasks independently, but may need assistance or supervision with the most cognitively demanding activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10653284&quot;/&gt;

===Moderate===
Progressive deterioration eventually hinders independence, with subjects being unable to perform most common activities of daily living.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10653284&quot;/&gt; Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to [[Anomic aphasia|recall vocabulary]], which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions ([[paraphasia]]s). Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10653284&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7967534&quot;/&gt; Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and AD progresses, so the risk of falling increases.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10653284&quot;/&gt; During this phase, memory problems worsen, and the person may fail to recognise close relatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10653284&quot;/&gt; [[Long-term memory]], which was previously intact, becomes impaired.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10653284&quot;/&gt;

Behavioural and [[neuropsychiatric]] changes become more prevalent. Common manifestations are [[Wandering (dementia)|wandering]], [[irritability]] and [[labile affect]], leading to crying, outbursts of unpremeditated [[aggression]], or resistance to caregiving.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10653284&quot;/&gt; [[Sundowning (dementia)|Sundowning]] can also appear.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal

|pmid=7806732
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote=The cause of Alzheimer's disease is not yet known, but scientists are hoping to find the answers by studying the characteristic brain changes that occur in a patient with Alzheimer's disease. In rare cases when the disease emerges before the age of sixty-five, these brain changes are caused by a genetic abnormality. Scientists are also looking to genetics as well as environmental factors for possible clues to the cause and cure of Alzheimer's disease.

Several competing [[hypotheses]] exist trying to explain the cause of the disease. The oldest, on which most currently available drug therapies are based, is the ''[[cholinergic]] hypothesis'',&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10071091&quot;&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Francis PT, Palmer AM, Snape M, Wilcock GK|title=The cholinergic hypothesis of Alzheimer's disease: a review of progress|journal=J.

The cholinergic hypothesis has not maintained widespread support, largely because medications intended to treat acetylcholine deficiency have not been very effective.

In 2009, this theory was updated, suggesting that a close relative of the beta-amyloid protein, and not necessarily the beta-amyloid itself, may be a major culprit in the disease. The theory holds that an amyloid-related mechanism that prunes neuronal connections in the brain in the fast-growth phase of early life may be triggered by ageing-related processes in later life to cause the neuronal withering of Alzheimer's disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nikolaev&quot;&gt;{{vcite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; N-APP, a fragment of APP from the peptide's [[N-terminus]], is adjacent to beta-amyloid and is cleaved from APP by one of the same enzymes. N-APP triggers the self-destruct pathway by binding to a neuronal receptor called death receptor 6 (DR6, also known as [[TNFRSF21]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Nikolaev&quot;/&gt; DR6 is highly expressed in the human brain regions most affected by Alzheimer's, so it is possible that the N-APP/DR6 pathway might be hijacked in the [[ageing brain]] to cause damage. In this model, beta-amyloid plays a complementary role, by depressing synaptic function.

[[File:TANGLES HIGH.jpg|300px|thumb|In Alzheimer's disease, changes in tau protein lead to the disintegration of microtubules in brain cells.]]

AD is also considered a [[tauopathy]] due to abnormal aggregation of the [[tau protein]]. Every neuron has a [[cytoskeleton]], an internal support structure partly made up of structures called [[microtubules]]. These microtubules act like tracks, guiding nutrients and molecules from the body of the cell to the ends of the [[axon]] and back. A protein called ''tau'' stabilises the microtubules when [[phosphorylation|phosphorylated]], and is therefore called a [[microtubule-associated protein]]. In AD, tau undergoes chemical changes, becoming [[Hyperphosphorylation|hyperphosphorylated]]; it then begins to pair with other threads, creating neurofibrillary tangles and disintegrating the neuron's transport system.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17604998&quot;&gt;{{vcite journal

Emotion-oriented interventions include [[reminiscence therapy]], [[validation therapy]], supportive [[psychotherapy]], [[sensory integration]], also called [[snoezelen]], and [[simulated presence therapy]]. Supportive psychotherapy has received little or no formal scientific study, but some clinicians find it useful in helping mildly impaired people adjust to their illness.&lt;ref name=&quot;pracGuideAPA&quot;/&gt; Reminiscence therapy (RT) involves the discussion of past experiences individually or in group, many times with the aid of photographs, household items, music and sound recordings, or other familiar items from the past. Although there are few quality studies on the effectiveness of RT, it may be beneficial for [[cognition]] and [[Mood (psychology)|mood]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15846613&quot;&gt;{{vcite journal

The aim of cognition-oriented treatments, which include reality orientation and [[Rehabilitation (neuropsychology)|cognitive retraining]], is the reduction of [[cognitive deficit]]s. Reality orientation consists in the presentation of information about time, place or person in order to ease the understanding of the person about its surroundings and his or her place in them. On the other hand cognitive retraining tries to improve impaired capacities by exercitation of mental abilities. Both have shown some efficacy improving cognitive capacities,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17636652&quot;&gt;{{vcite journal

===Caregiving===
{{Further2|[[Caregiving and dementia]]}}

Since Alzheimer's has no cure and it gradually renders people incapable of tending for their own needs, caregiving essentially is the treatment and must be carefully managed over the course of the disease.

During the early and moderate stages, modifications to the living environment and lifestyle can increase [[patient safety]] and reduce caretaker burden.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11220813&quot;&gt;{{vcite journal

The early stages of Alzheimer's disease are difficult to diagnose. A definitive diagnosis is usually made once cognitive impairment compromises daily living activities, although the person may still be living independently. The symptoms will progress from mild cognitive problems, such as memory loss through increasing stages of cognitive and non-cognitive disturbances, eliminating any possibility of independent living, especially in the late stages of the disease.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10653284&quot;/&gt;

Two main measures are used in [[epidemiology|epidemiological]] studies: incidence and prevalence. [[Incidence (epidemiology)|Incidence]] is the number of new cases per unit of person–time at risk (usually number of new cases per thousand person–years); while [[prevalence]] is the total number of cases of the disease in the population at any given time.

Regarding incidence, [[cohort study|cohort]] [[longitudinal studies]] (studies where a disease-free population is followed over the years) provide rates between 10 and 15 per thousand person–years for all dementias and 5–8 for AD,&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17727890&quot;&gt;{{vcite journal

Prevalence of AD in populations is dependent upon different factors including incidence and survival. Since the incidence of AD increases with age, it is particularly important to include the mean age of the population of interest. In the United States, Alzheimer prevalence was estimated to be 1.6% in 2000 both overall and in the 65–74 age group, with the rate increasing to 19% in the 75–84 group and to 42% in the greater than 84 group.&lt;ref&gt;2000 U.S. estimates:

For most of the 20th century, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease was reserved for individuals between the ages of 45 and 65 who developed symptoms of dementia. The terminology changed after 1977 when a conference on AD concluded that the clinical and [[pathological]] manifestations of presenile and senile dementia were almost identical, although the authors also added that this did not rule out the possibility that they had different causes.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-89004-225-X&quot;&gt;{{cite book

An FDA panel voted unanimously to recommend approval of [[florbetapir]] (tradename: Amyvid), which is currently used in an investigational study. The agent can detect Alzheimer's brain plaques, but will require additional clinical research before it can be made available commercially.&lt;ref&gt;{{vcite journal|author=Clark CM, Schneider JA, Bedell BJ, Beach TG, Bilker WB, Mintun MA, Pontecorvo MJ, Hefti F, Carpenter AP, Flitter ML, Krautkramer MJ, Kung HF, Coleman RE, Doraiswamy PM, Fleisher AS, Sabbagh MN, Sadowsky CH, Reiman PE, Zehntner SP, Skovronsky DM|title=FDA recommends approval of new compound in Alzheimer's detection|journal=[[J Am Med Assoc]]|date=2011-01-19|volume=305|issue=3|pages=275–83|url=http://www.usatoday.com/yourlife/health/medical/alzheimers/2011-01-22-alzheimersfda21_ST_N.htm?csp=34news&amp;utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+usatoday-NewsTopStories+%28News+-+Top+Stories%29|doi=10.1001/jama.2010.2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
