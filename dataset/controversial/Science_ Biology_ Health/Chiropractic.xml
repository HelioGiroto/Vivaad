'''Chiropractic''' is a [[complementary and alternative medicine]]&lt;ref name=Chapman-Smith/&gt; health care profession concerned with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of disorders of the neuromusculoskeletal system and the effects of these disorders on general health.&lt;ref name=WHO-guidelines/&gt; The main [[chiropractic treatment technique]] involves [[manual therapy]], including [[Spinal manipulation|manipulation of the spine]], other joints, and [[soft tissue]]s; treatment also includes exercises and health and lifestyle counseling.&lt;ref name=content-of-practice/&gt; Traditional chiropractic assumes that a [[vertebral subluxation]] interferes with the body's [[innate intelligence]],&lt;ref name=History-PPC/&gt; a [[vitalistic]] notion ridiculed by the scientific and healthcare communities.&lt;ref name=Keating-subluxation/&gt; Other chiropractors want to separate themselves from the traditional vitalistic concept of innate intelligence.&lt;ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg/&gt; 

[[Daniel David Palmer|D.D. Palmer]] founded chiropractic in the 1890s, and his son [[Bartlett Joshua Palmer|B.J. Palmer]] helped to expand it in the early 20th century.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; It has two main groups: &quot;straights&quot;, now the minority, emphasize [[vitalism]], innate intelligence and [[spinal adjustment]]s, and consider vertebral subluxations to be the cause of all disease; &quot;mixers&quot;, the majority, are more open to mainstream views and conventional medical techniques, such as [[exercise]], [[massage]], and [[ice pack|ice therapy]].&lt;ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg/&gt; 

Chiropractic is well established in the U.S., Canada and Australia&lt;ref name=global-strategy/&gt; and is the &quot;third largest of the doctored health professions (behind only [[medicine]] and [[dentistry]])&quot;.&lt;ref name=Smith/&gt; It overlaps with other manual-therapy professions, including [[massage therapy]], [[osteopathy]], and [[physical therapy]].&lt;ref name=Norris/&gt; Chiropractors share similarities{{specify|date=October 2012}} with both [[primary care]] providers and medical specialists like [[dentists]] or [[podiatrist]]s.&lt;ref name=Meeker-Haldeman/&gt; Most who seek chiropractic care do so for [[low back pain]].&lt;ref name=Lawrence-Meeker/&gt;

For most of its existence, chiropractic has been sustained by [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] ideas such as subluxation and innate intelligence&lt;ref name=History-Primer2/&gt; that are not based on solid science.&lt;ref name=Ernst-eval/&gt; [[Chiropractic controversy and criticism|Criticisms of chiropractic]] include the significant disagreements among chiropractors over the effectiveness of [[vaccination]], despite the consensus of [[public health]] professionals regarding the benefits of [[vaccination]],&lt;ref name=Busse/&gt; which has led to negative impacts on both public vaccination and mainstream acceptance of chiropractic.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; The [[American Medical Association]] called chiropractic an &quot;unscientific cult&quot;&lt;ref name=Chiro-PH/&gt; and boycotted it until losing an [[Wilk v. American Medical Association|antitrust case in 1987]].&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt; Chiropractic has developed a strong political base and sustained demand for services; in recent decades, it has gained more legitimacy and greater acceptance among medical [[physician]]s and [[health plan]]s in the U.S.,&lt;ref name=Cooper/&gt; and the principles of [[evidence-based medicine]] have been used to review research studies and generate [[Medical guideline|practice guidelines]].&lt;ref name=Villanueva-Russell&gt;{{cite journal|journal= [[Soc Sci Med]]|year=2005|volume=60|issue=3|pages=545–61|title= Evidence-based medicine and its implications for the profession of chiropractic|author= Villanueva-Russell Y|doi=10.1016/j.socscimed.2004.05.017|pmid=15550303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiropractic's early philosophy was rooted in [[vitalism]], [[spirituality|spiritual inspiration]] and [[rationalism]]. A philosophy based on [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] from [[dogma|irrefutable doctrine]] helped distinguish chiropractic from medicine, provided it with legal and political defenses against claims of practicing medicine without a license, and allowed chiropractors to establish themselves as an autonomous profession. This &quot;straight&quot; philosophy, taught to generations of chiropractors, rejects the [[Inference|inferential reasoning]] of the [[scientific method]],&lt;ref name=Keating05/&gt; and relies on deductions from [[vitalistic]] first principles rather than on the [[materialism]] of science.&lt;ref name=Chiro-Beliefs/&gt; 

However, most practitioners currently accept the importance of scientific research into chiropractic,&lt;ref name=Keating05&gt;{{cite book|author= Keating JC Jr|chapter= Philosophy in chiropractic|pages=77–98|title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic|edition=3rd|editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B ''et al.'' (eds.)|publisher=[[McGraw-Hill]]|year=2005|isbn=0-07-137534-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most practitioners are &quot;mixers&quot; who attempt to combine the materialistic reductionism of science with the metaphysics of their predecessors and with the [[Holistic medicine|holistic paradigm of wellness]];&lt;ref name=Chiro-Beliefs/&gt; a 2008 commentary proposed that chiropractic actively divorce itself from the straight philosophy as part of a campaign to eliminate [[Testability|untestable]] dogma and engage in critical thinking and evidence-based research.&lt;ref name=Murphy-pod/&gt;

Although a wide diversity of ideas currently exists among chiropractors,&lt;ref name=Keating05/&gt; they share the belief that the [[Vertebral column|spine]] and health are related in a fundamental way, and that this relationship is mediated through the nervous system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Gay RE, Nelson CF|chapter= Chiropractic philosophy|chapterurl=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=altrehab.section.336|editor= Wainapel SF, Fast A (eds.)|title= Alternative Medicine and Rehabilitation: a Guide for Practitioners|year=2003|isbn=1-888799-66-8|location= New York|publisher= [[Demos Medical Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiropractors examine the [[biomechanics]], structure and function of the spine, along with its effects on the [[musculoskeletal]] and [[nervous system]]s and what they believe to be its role in health and disease.&lt;ref name=ACA-history&gt;{{cite web|title= History of chiropractic care|author= [[American Chiropractic Association]]|accessdate=2008-02-21|url=http://acatoday.org/level2_css.cfm?T1ID=13&amp;T2ID=62}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiropractic philosophy includes the following perspectives:&lt;ref name=Chiro-Beliefs&gt;{{cite book|chapterurl=http://chiroweb.com/archives/ahcpr/chapter2.htm|chapter= Chiropractic belief systems|author= Mootz RD, Phillips RB|year=1997|title= Chiropractic in the United States: Training, Practice, and Research|pages=9–16|editor= Cherkin DC, Mootz RD (eds.)|accessdate=2008-02-14|location= Rockville, MD|publisher= [[Agency for Health Care Policy and Research]]|oclc=39856366}} AHCPR Pub No. 98-N002.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Holism]]''' assumes that health is affected by everything in an individual's environment; some sources also include a spiritual or [[Existentialism|existential]] dimension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Br J Gen Pract|year=2005|volume=55|issue=511|pages=154–5|title= Towards a definition of holism|author= Freeman J|pmc=1463203|pmid=15720949}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, '''[[reductionism]]''' in chiropractic reduces causes and cures of health problems to a single factor, [[#Vertebral subluxation|vertebral subluxation]].&lt;ref name=Murphy-pod&gt;{{cite journal|author= Murphy DR, Schneider MJ, Seaman DR, Perle SM, Nelson CF|title= How can chiropractic become a respected mainstream profession?

*'''Conservatism''' considers the risks of clinical interventions when balancing them against their benefits. It emphasizes [[noninvasive]] treatment to minimize risk, and avoids [[surgery]] and [[medication]].&lt;ref name=ACA-history/&gt;
*'''[[Homeostasis]]''' emphasizes the body's inherent self-healing abilities. Chiropractic's early notion of [[innate intelligence]] can be thought of as a metaphor for homeostasis.&lt;ref name=Keating05/&gt;
* Straights tend to use an approach that focuses on the chiropractor's perspective and the treatment model, whereas mixers tend to focus on the patient and the patient's situation.&lt;ref name=Chiro-Beliefs/&gt;

''Straight'' chiropractors adhere to the philosophical principles set forth by D.D. and B.J. Palmer, and retain [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] definitions and [[vitalistic]] qualities. Straight chiropractors believe that vertebral subluxation leads to interference with an &quot;[[innate intelligence]]&quot; exerted via the human nervous system and is a primary underlying risk factor for many diseases. Straights view the medical diagnosis of patient complaints (which they consider to be the &quot;secondary effects&quot; of subluxations) to be unnecessary for chiropractic treatment. Thus, straight chiropractors are concerned primarily with the detection and correction of vertebral subluxation via adjustment and do not &quot;mix&quot; other types of therapies into their practice style.&lt;ref name=History-Primer/&gt; 

Their philosophy and explanations are metaphysical in nature and they prefer to use traditional chiropractic lexicon terminology (i.e. perform spinal analysis, detect subluxation, correct with adjustment, etc.). They prefer to remain separate and distinct from mainstream health care. Although considered the minority group, &quot;they have been able to transform their status as purists and heirs of the lineage into influence dramatically out of proportion to their numbers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kaptchuk-Eisenberg&quot;/&gt;

''Mixer'' chiropractors &quot;mix&quot; diagnostic and treatment approaches from osteopathic, medical, and chiropractic viewpoints. Unlike straight chiropractors, mixers believe subluxation is one of many causes of disease, and they incorporate mainstream medical diagnostics and employ many treatments including conventional techniques of [[physical therapy]] such as exercise, [[massage]], [[ice pack]]s, and [[moist heat]], along with [[nutritional supplements]], [[acupuncture]], [[homeopathy]], [[Herbalism|herbal remedies]], and [[biofeedback]]. Mixers tend to be open to mainstream medicine and are the majority group.&lt;ref name=Kaptchuk-Eisenberg&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Arch Intern Med]]|year=1998|volume=158|issue=20|pages=2215–24|title=Chiropractic: origins, controversies, and contributions|author=Kaptchuk TJ, Eisenberg DM|pmid=9818801|url=http://archinte.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/158/20/2215|doi=10.1001/archinte.158.20.2215 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although mixers are the majority group, many of them retain some belief in vertebral subluxation as shown in a 2003 survey of 1100 North American chiropractors, which found that 88% wanted to retain the term &quot;vertebral subluxation complex&quot;, and that when asked to estimate the percent of disorders of internal organs (such as the heart, the lungs, or the stomach) that subluxation significantly contributes to, the mean response was 62%.&lt;ref name=McDonald/&gt; Despite this finding, a 2008 survey of 6000 American chiropractors demonstrated that most chiropractors seem to believe that a subluxation-based clinical approach may be of limited utility for addressing visceral disorders, and greatly favored non-subluxation-based clinical approaches for such conditions.&lt;ref name=Smith&amp;Carber&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[J Chiropr Human]]|year=2008|volume=15|issue=|pages=19–26|title=Survey of US Chiropractor Attitudes and Behaviors about Subluxation|author=Smith M, Carber LA|pmid=|url=http://archive.journalchirohumanities.com/Vol%2015/JChiroprHumanit2008v15-19-26.pdf|doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Chiropractic &amp; Manual Therapies]]|year=2011|volume=19|issue=4|pages=|title=The prevalence of the term subluxation in North American English-Language Doctor of chiropractic programs|author=Mirtz TA, Perle SM |pmid=21682859|url=http://chiromt.com/content/19/1/14|doi=10.1186/2045-709X-19-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vertebral subluxation ===
{{Main|Vertebral subluxation}}
Palmer hypothesized that vertebral joint misalignments, which he termed ''vertebral subluxations'', interfered with the body's function and its inborn (innate) ability to heal itself.&lt;ref name=History-PPC&gt;{{cite book|author= [[Joseph C. Keating, Jr.|Keating JC Jr]]|chapter= A brief history of the chiropractic profession|pages=23–64|title= Principles and Practice of Chiropractic|edition=3rd|editor= Haldeman S, Dagenais S, Budgell B ''et al.'' (eds.)|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=2005|isbn=0-07-137534-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; D.D. Palmer repudiated his earlier theory that vertebral subluxations caused pinched nerves in the intervertebral spaces in favor of subluxations causing altered nerve vibration, either too tense or too slack, affecting the tone (health) of the end organ. D.D. Palmer, using a vitalistic approach, imbued the term ''subluxation'' with a metaphysical and [[philosophical]] meaning. He qualified this by noting that knowledge of innate intelligence was not essential to the competent practice of chiropractic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Forgotten_Theories1995.pdf|format=PDF|title= D.D. Palmer's forgotten theories of chiropractic|author= Keating JC Jr|publisher= [[Association for the History of Chiropractic]]|year=1995|accessdate=2008-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; This concept was later expanded upon by his son, B.J. Palmer and was instrumental in providing the legal basis of differentiating chiropractic medicine from conventional medicine. In 1910, D.D. Palmer theorized that the nervous system controlled health:

:&quot;Physiologists divide nerve-fibers, which form the nerves, into two classes, afferent and efferent. Impressions are made on the peripheral afferent fiber-endings; these create sensations that are transmitted to the center of the nervous system. Efferent nerve-fibers carry impulses out from the center to their endings. Most of these go to muscles and are therefore called motor impulses; some are secretory and enter glands; a portion are inhibitory, their function being to restrain secretion. Thus, nerves carry impulses outward and sensations inward. The activity of these nerves, or rather their fibers, may become excited or allayed by impingement, the result being a modification of functionality—too much or not enough action—which is disease.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Palmer DD|title= The Chiropractor's Adjuster: Text-book of the Science, Art and Philosophy of Chiropractic for Students and Practitioners|url=http://www.scribd.com/doc/45233534/s-Adjuster-1910|location=Portland, OR|publisher= Portland Printing House Co|year=1910|oclc=17205743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vertebral subluxation, a core concept of traditional chiropractic, remains unsubstantiated and largely untested, and a debate about whether to keep it in the chiropractic paradigm has been ongoing for decades.&lt;ref name=Keating-subluxation/&gt; In general, critics of traditional subluxation-based chiropractic (including chiropractors) are skeptical of its clinical value, [[dogmatic]] beliefs and metaphysical approach.

In 2005, the chiropractic subluxation was defined by the [[World Health Organization]] as &quot;a lesion or dysfunction in a joint or motion segment in which alignment, movement integrity and/or physiological function are altered, although contact between joint surfaces remains intact. It is essentially a functional entity, which may influence biomechanical and neural integrity.&quot; This differs from the medical definition of subluxation as a significant structural displacement, which can be seen with static imaging techniques such as [[Radio diagnostics|X-rays]].&lt;ref name=WHO-guidelines&gt;{{cite journal |author= World Health Organization|year=2005|title= WHO guidelines on basic training and safety in chiropractic|url=http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/traditional/Chiro-Guidelines.pdf|format=PDF|isbn= 92-4-159371-7|accessdate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 2008 book ''[[Trick or Treatment]]'' states &quot;X-rays can reveal neither the subluxations nor the innate intelligence associated with chiropractic philosophy, because they do not exist.&quot;&lt;ref name=Trick-or-Treatment/&gt; Attorney David Chapman-Smith, Secretary-General of the [[World Federation of Chiropractic]], has stated that &quot;Medical critics have asked how there can be a subluxation if it cannot be seen on x-ray.

== Treatment techniques ==
{{Main|Chiropractic treatment techniques|Spinal adjustment}}
[[Spinal manipulation]], which chiropractors call &quot;spinal adjustment&quot; or &quot;chiropractic adjustment&quot;, is the most common treatment used in chiropractic care.&lt;ref name=NBCE_techniques/&gt; Spinal manipulation is a passive manual maneuver during which a three-joint complex is taken past the normal range of movement, but not so far as to dislocate or damage the joint. Its defining factor is a dynamic thrust, which is a sudden force that causes an audible release and attempts to increase a joint's range of motion.&lt;ref name=ACA-SMP/&gt; 

High-velocity, low-amplitude spinal manipulation (HVLA-SM) thrusts have physiological effects that signal neural discharge from paraspinal muscle tissues, depending on duration and amplitude of the thrust are factors of the degree in paraspinal muscle spindles activation. Clinical skill in employing HVLA-SM thrusts depends on the ability of the practitioner to handle the duration and magnitude of the load.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Spine|year=2007|volume=7|issue=5|pages=583– 95|title= Response of lumbar paraspinal muscles spindles is greater to spinal manipulative loading compared with slower loading under length control|author= Pickar JG, Sung PS, Kang YM, Ge W|pmid=17905321|pmc=2075482|doi=10.1016/j.spinee.2006.10.006|url=http://www.thespinejournalonline.com/article/S1529-9430(06)00973-9/abstract }}&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, [[spinal manipulative therapy]] (SMT) describes techniques where the hands are used to manipulate, massage, mobilize, adjust, stimulate, apply traction to, or otherwise influence the spine and related tissues.&lt;ref name=ACA-SMP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acatoday.org/pdf/spinal_manipulation_policy.pdf|format=PDF|title= Spinal manipulation policy statement|author= Winkler K, Hegetschweiler-Goertz C, Jackson PS ''et al.''|accessdate=2008-05-24|year=2003|publisher= American Chiropractic Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several schools of chiropractic adjustive techniques, although most chiropractors mix techniques from several schools. The following adjustive procedures were received by more than 10% of patients of licensed U.S. chiropractors in a 2003 survey:&lt;ref name=NBCE_techniques/&gt; [[Diversified technique]] (full-spine manipulation, employing various techniques), extremity adjusting, [[Activator technique]] (which uses a spring-loaded tool to deliver precise adjustments to the spine), Thompson Technique (which relies on a drop table and detailed procedural protocols), [[Clarence Gonstead#Gonstead Technique|Gonstead]] (which emphasizes evaluating the spine along with specific adjustment that avoids rotational vectors), Cox/flexion-distraction (a gentle, low-force adjusting procedure which mixes chiropractic with osteopathic principles and utilizes specialized adjusting tables with movable parts), adjustive instrument, Sacro-Occipital Technique (which models the spine as a torsion bar), [[Neuromuscular therapy|Nimmo Receptor-Tonus Technique]], [[Applied Kinesiology]] (which emphasises &quot;muscle testing&quot; as a diagnostic tool), and cranial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Technique Systems in Chiropractic|author=Cooperstein R, Gleberzon BJ|publisher=Churchill Livingstone|year=2004|isbn=0-443-07413-5|ref=TSC }}&lt;/ref&gt; Medicine-assisted manipulation, such as [[manipulation under anesthesia]], involves sedation or local anesthetic and is done by a team that includes an [[anesthesiologist]]; a 2008 [[systematic review]] did not find enough evidence to make recommendations about its use for chronic low back pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dagenais S, Mayer J, Wooley JR, Haldeman S|title=Evidence-informed management of chronic low back pain with medicine-assisted manipulation|journal=Spine J|volume=8|issue=1|pages=142–9|year=2008|pmid=18164462|doi=10.1016/j.spinee.2007.09.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|Chiropractic history|Chiropractic controversy and criticism}}
[[Image:Daniel David Palmer.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=Half-length sitting portrait of man in his fifties with large gray beard and moustache, wearing coat and vest|[[Daniel David Palmer|D.D. Palmer]]]]
Chiropractic was founded in 1895 by [[Daniel David Palmer|Daniel David (D.D.) Palmer]] in [[Davenport, Iowa]]. Palmer, a [[Magnetic healing|magnetic healer]], hypothesized that manual manipulation of the spine could cure disease.&lt;ref name=Baer/&gt; The first chiropractic patient of D.D. Palmer was [[Harvey Lillard]], a worker in the building where Palmer's office was located.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=History-Primer/&gt; --&gt; He claimed that he had severely reduced hearing for 17 years, which started soon following a &quot;pop&quot; in his spine.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=History-Primer/&gt; --&gt; A few days following his adjustment, Lillard claimed his hearing was almost completely restored.&lt;ref name=History-Primer/&gt; 

Chiropractic competed with its predecessor [[osteopathy]], another medical system based on magnetic healing and [[bonesetting]]; both systems were founded by charismatic midwesterners in opposition to the conventional medicine of the day, and both postulated that manipulation improved health.&lt;ref name=Baer&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Med Anthropol Q|year=1987|volume=1|issue=2|pages=176–93|title=Divergence and convergence in two systems of manual medicine: osteopathy and chiropractic in the United States|author=Baer HA|doi=10.1525/maq.1987.1.2.02a00030 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although initially keeping chiropractic a family secret, in 1898 Palmer began teaching it to a few students at his new [[Palmer School of Chiropractic]]. One student, his son [[Bartlett Joshua Palmer|Bartlett Joshua (B.J.) Palmer]], became committed to promoting chiropractic, took over the Palmer School in 1906, and rapidly expanded its enrollment.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Technol Cult|author=Martin SC|year=1993|volume=34|issue=4|pages=808–34|title=Chiropractic and the social context of medical technology, 1895–1925|doi=10.2307/3106416|pmid=11623404|jstor=3106416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early chiropractors believed that all disease was caused by interruptions in the flow of [[innate intelligence]], a [[Vitalism|vital]] nervous energy or life force that represented God's presence in man; chiropractic leaders often invoked religious imagery and moral traditions. D.D. and B.J. both seriously considered declaring chiropractic a religion, which might have provided [[Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment|legal protection under the U.S. constitution]], but decided against it partly to avoid confusion with [[Christian Science]].&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chiro.org/Plus/History/Persons/PalmerDD/PalmerDD's_Religion-of-Chiro.pdf|format=PDF|author= Palmer DD|title= D.D. Palmer's Religion of Chiropractic: Letter to P.W. Johnson, D.C|date=1911-05-04|accessdate=2008-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early chiropractors also tapped into the [[Populism|Populist]] movement, emphasizing craft, hard work, competition, and advertisement, aligning themselves with the common man against intellectuals and [[Trust (19th century)|trusts]], among which they included the [[American Medical Association]] (AMA).&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;

Chiropractic has seen considerable [[Chiropractic controversy and criticism|controversy and criticism]].&lt;ref name=Homola&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Clin Orthop Relat Res|year=2006|volume=444|pages=236–42|title=Chiropractic: history and overview of theories and methods|author=Homola S|doi=10.1097/01.blo.0000200258.95865.87|pmid=16446588 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DeVocht/&gt; Although D.D. and B.J. were &quot;straight&quot; and disdained the use of instruments, some early chiropractors, whom B.J. scornfully called &quot;mixers&quot;, advocated the use of instruments. In 1910 B.J. changed course and endorsed [[X-rays]] as necessary for diagnosis; this resulted in a significant exodus from the Palmer School of the more conservative faculty and students.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; 

The mixer camp grew until by 1924 B.J. estimated that only 3,000 of the U.S.'s 25,000 chiropractors remained straight.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; --&gt; That year, B.J.'s invention and promotion of the neurocalometer, a temperature-sensing device, was highly controversial among B.J.'s fellow straights. By the 1930s chiropractic was the largest alternative healing profession in the U.S.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; 

The 2008 book ''[[Trick or Treatment]]'' states that in 1913 B.J. Palmer ran over his father, D.D. Palmer, at a homecoming parade for the Palmer School of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Trick or Treatment/&gt; --&gt; Weeks later D.D. Palmer died in Los Angeles.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Trick or Treatment&quot;/&gt; --&gt; The official cause of death was recorded as [[typhoid]].&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Trick or Treatment/&gt; --&gt; The book ''Trick or Treatment'' remarked &quot;it seems more likely that his death was a direct result of injuries caused by his son.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Trick-or-Treatment&quot; /&gt; 

Chiropractic historian [[Joseph C. Keating, Jr.]] has described the attempted patricide of D.D. Palmer as a &quot;myth&quot; and &quot;absurd on its face&quot; and cites an eyewitness who recalled that D.D. was not struck by B.J.'s car, but rather, had stumbled.&lt;ref name=dispell/&gt; He also says that &quot;Joy Loban, DC, executor of D.D.'s estate, voluntarily withdrew a civil suit claiming damages against B.J. Palmer, and that several grand juries repeatedly refused to bring criminal charges against the son.&quot;&lt;ref name=dispell&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chiroweb.com/mpacms/dc/article.php?id=42251|title=Dispelling Some Myths About Old Dad Chiro|last=Keating|first=Joseph|year=1993|publisher=[[Dynamic Chiropractic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiropractors faced heavy opposition from organized medicine. Thousands of chiropractors were prosecuted for [[Practicing medicine without license|practicing medicine without a license]], and D.D. and many other chiropractors were jailed. To defend against medical statutes B.J. argued that chiropractic was separate and distinct from medicine, asserting that chiropractors &quot;analyzed&quot; rather than &quot;diagnosed&quot;, and &quot;adjusted&quot; subluxations rather than &quot;treated&quot; disease. B.J. cofounded the Universal Chiropractors' Association (UCA) to provide legal services to arrested chiropractors. Although the UCA won their first test case in Wisconsin in 1907, prosecutions instigated by state medical boards became increasingly common and in many cases were successful. In response, chiropractors conducted political campaigns to secure separate licensing statutes, eventually succeeding in all fifty states, from Kansas in 1913 through Louisiana in 1974.&lt;ref name=History-Primer/&gt; 

The longstanding feud between chiropractors and [[medical doctor]]s continued for decades.

Research to test chiropractic theories began in 1935 with the B.J. Palmer Research Clinic at the Palmer College of Chiropractic in Davenport, Iowa. The clinic was organized into two divisions—a medical division and a chiropractic division. The medical division contained all the standard medical tests of the time and was used to establish a medical diagnosis of a patient's condition before the patient received treatment. The chiropractic division administered the treatment which included passive therapies, chiropractic adjustments and physical rehabilitation for the various conditions diagnosed. Research continued in the B.J. Palmer research clinic until B.J. Palmer's death in 1961 and the results and findings of these patient cases were the substance of B.J. Palmer's publishing over this 30 year time-period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Chiropractic: An Illustrated History|year=1995|publisher=Elsevier - Health Sciences Division|location=St Louis/US|isbn=978-0-8016-7735-9|pages=170–171|coauthors=Dennis Peterson; Glenda Wiese}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Attempts to further test chiropractic theories by modern standards of research began in the 1970s.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=History-Primer/&gt; --&gt; By the mid 1990s there was a growing scholarly interest in chiropractic, which helped efforts to improve service quality and establish clinical guidelines that recommended manual therapies for acute low back pain.&lt;ref name=History-Primer&gt;{{cite web|title= Chiropractic history: a primer|author= Keating JC Jr, Cleveland CS III, Menke M|url=http://www.brianesty.com/pdfs/Chiropractic%20History.pdf|format=PDF|year=2005|accessdate=2012-07-20|publisher= Association for the History of Chiropractic}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In recent decades chiropractic gained legitimacy and greater acceptance by medical physicians and [[health plan]]s, and enjoyed a strong political base and sustained demand for services. However, its future seemed uncertain: as the number of practitioners grew, [[evidence-based medicine]] insisted on treatments with demonstrated value, [[managed care]] restricted payment, and competition grew from [[massage therapist]]s and other health professions. The profession responded by marketing natural products and devices more aggressively, and by reaching deeper into [[alternative medicine]] and [[primary care]].&lt;ref name=Cooper&gt;{{cite journal|journal= [[Milbank Q]]|year=2003|volume=81|issue=1|pages=107–38|title= Chiropractic in the United States: trends and issues|author= Cooper RA, McKee HJ|doi=10.1111/1468-0009.00040|pmid=12669653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence basis==
The principles of [[evidence-based medicine]] have been used to review research studies and generate practice guidelines outlining professional standards that specify which chiropractic treatments are legitimate and perhaps reimbursable under [[managed care]].&lt;ref name=Villanueva-Russell/&gt; Evidence-based guidelines are supported by one end of an ideological continuum among chiropractors; the other end employs [[antiscientific]] reasoning and makes unsubstantiated claims.&lt;ref name=Keating-subluxation/&gt;&lt;ref name=History-Primer2&gt;{{cite web|title= Chiropractic history: a primer|author= [[Joseph C.

One example of this conundrum is the continuing controversy about the presumptive target of DCs' adjustive interventions: subluxation (Gatterman 1995; Leach 1994).}}{{dead link|date=June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nelson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Science, antiscience, materialism and vitalism:

===Safety===
Chiropractic care in general is safe when employed skillfully and appropriately.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=WHO-guidelines/&gt; --&gt; Manipulation is regarded as relatively safe, but as with all therapeutic interventions, complications can arise, and it has known adverse effects, risks and contraindications.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=WHO-guidelines/&gt; --&gt; Absolute [[contraindication]]s to spinal manipulative therapy are conditions that should not be manipulated; these contraindications include [[rheumatoid arthritis]] and conditions known to result in unstable joints.&lt;ref name=WHO-guidelines/&gt;

Relative contraindications are conditions where increased risk is acceptable in some situations and where low-force and soft-tissue techniques are treatments of choice; these contraindications include [[osteoporosis]].&lt;ref name=WHO-guidelines/&gt; Although most contraindications apply only to manipulation of the affected region, some neurological signs indicate referral to [[emergency medical services]]; these include sudden and severe [[headache]] or [[neck pain]] unlike that previously experienced.&lt;ref name=CCA-CFCREAB-CPG&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J Can Chiropr Assoc|year=2005|volume=49|issue=3|pages=158–209|title= Chiropractic clinical practice guideline: evidence-based treatment of adult neck pain not due to whiplash|author= Anderson-Peacock E, Blouin JS, Bryans R ''et al.''|url=http://jcca-online.org/ecms.ashx/PDF/2005/2005-3/Chiropracticclinicalpracticeguideline-evidence-basedtreatmentofadultneckpainnotduetowhiplash.pdf|format=PDF|pmid=17549134|pmc=1839918 }}&lt;br/&gt;• {{cite journal|journal=J Can Chiropr Assoc|year=2008|volume=52|issue=1|pages=7–8|title=A Clinical Practice Guideline Update from The CCA•CFCREAB-CPG|author= Anderson-Peacock E, Bryans B, Descarreaux M ''et al.''|url=http://jcca-online.org/ecms.ashx/PDF/2008/2008-1/ClinicalPracticeGuidelineUpdatefromTheCCACFCREABCPG.pdf|format=PDF|pmid=18327295|pmc=2258235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk-benefit===
A 2012 [[systematic review]] concluded that no accurate assessment of risk-benefit exists for cervical manipulation.&lt;ref name=Haynes&gt;{{cite journal|journal=International Journal of Clinical Practice|year=2012|volume=66|issue=10|pages=940–947|title= Assessing the risk of stroke from neck manipulation: a systematic review|author= Haynes MJ, Vincent K, Fischhoff C, Bremner AP, Lanlo O, Hankey GJ.|doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2012.03004.x|pmid=22994328|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1742-1241.2012.03004.x/full}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 systematic review stated that there is no good evidence to assume that neck manipulation is an effective treatment for any medical condition and suggested a [[precautionary principle]] in healthcare for chiropractic intervention even if a causality with [[vertebral artery dissection]] after neck manipulation were merely a remote possibility.&lt;ref name=Ernst-death&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Int J Clinical Practice|year=2010|volume=64|issue= 8|pages=1162–1165|title= Deaths after chiropractic: a review of published cases|author= E Ernst|pmid=20642715|doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2010.02352.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same review concluded that the risk of death from manipulations to the neck outweighs the benefits.&lt;ref name=Ernst-death/&gt; Chiropractors have criticized this conclusion.&lt;ref name=Ernst-response&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Int J Clin Pract|year=2011|volume=65|issue= 1|page=106|title= Response to critiques of deaths after chiropractic|author= E Ernst|pmid=21155949|doi=10.1111/j.1742-1241.2010.02568.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2009 review evaluating maintenance chiropractic care found that spinal manipulation is routinely associated with considerable harm and no compelling evidence exists to indicate that it adequately prevents symptoms or diseases, thus the risk-benefit is not evidently favorable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Prev Med|year=2009|volume=49|issue=2–3|pages=99–100|title= Chiropractic maintenance treatment, a useful preventative approach?|author= Ernst E|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2009.05.004|pmid=19465044}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2008 summary found that the best evidence suggests that chiropractic care is a useful therapy for subjects with neck or low-back pain for which the risks of serious adverse events should be considered negligible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1016/j.jmpt.2008.06.001|journal= J Manipulative Physiol Ther|year=2008|volume=31|issue= 6|pages=461–464|title= Adverse events following chiropractic care for subjects with neck or low-back pain: do the benefits outweigh the risks?|author= Rubinstein SM|pmid=18722202 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 systematic review found that with uncertain efficacy and definite risks, the risk-benefit balance of spinal manipulation can't be positive.&lt;ref name=Ernst-adverse/&gt; A 2006 systematic review of systematic reviews found the risk-benefit balance does not favor spinal manipulation over other treatments like [[physical therapy]].&lt;ref name=Ernst-Canter/&gt;

A 2012 systematic review suggested that the use of spine manipulation in clinical practice is a cost-effective treatment when used alone or in combination with other treatment approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= J Electromyogr Kinesiol|year=2012|volume=|issue=|pages=|title=Spinal manipulation epidemiology: Systematic review of cost effectiveness studies|author= Michaleff ZA, Lin CW, Maher CG, van Tulder MW|doi= 10.1016/j.jelekin.2012.02.011|pmid=22429823|pmc= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2011 systematic review found evidence supporting the cost-effectiveness of using spinal manipulation for the treatment of sub-acute or chronic low back pain; the results for acute low back pain were inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= European Spine Journal|year=2011|volume=20|issue=7|pages=1024–1038|title=Cost-effectiveness of guideline-endorsed treatments for low back pain: a systematic review|author= Lin CW, Haas M, Maher CG, Machado LA, van Tulder MW|doi=10.1007/s00586-010-1676-3|pmid=21229367|pmc= 3176706 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 qualitative review found that the research literature suggests that chiropractic obtains at least comparable outcomes to alternatives with potential cost savings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= J Manipulative Physiol Ther|year=2006|volume=29|issue=9|pages=707–25|title= Health services research related to chiropractic: review and recommendations for research prioritization by the chiropractic profession|author= Mootz RD, Hansen DT, Breen A, Killinger LZ, Nelson C|doi=10.1016/j.jmpt.2006.09.001|pmid=17142165}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2006 systematic [[cost-effectiveness]] review found that the reported cost-effectiveness of chiropractic manipulation in the [[United Kingdom]] compared favorably with other treatments for back pain, but that reports were based on data from clinical trials without sham controls and that the specific cost-effectiveness of the treatment (as opposed to [[non-specific effect]]s) remains uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= [[Evid Based Complement Alternat Med]]|year=2006|volume=3|issue=4|pages=425–32|title= Cost-Effectiveness of Complementary Therapies in the United Kingdom—A Systematic Review†|author= Canter PH, Coon JT, Ernst E|doi=10.1093/ecam/nel044|pmid=17173105|url=http://ecam.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/3/4/425|pmc= 1697737}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2005 systematic review of economic evaluations of conservative treatments for low back pain found that significant quality problems in available studies meant that definite conclusions could not be drawn about the most cost-effective intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= [[Best Pract Res Clin Rheumatol]]|year=2005|volume=19|issue=4|pages=671–84|title= What is the most cost-effective treatment for patients with low back pain? a systematic review|author= van der Roer N, Goossens MEJB, Evers SMAA, van Tulder MW|doi=10.1016/j.berh.2005.03.007|pmid=15949783}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cost-effectiveness of maintenance chiropractic care is unknown.&lt;ref name=Leboeuf-Yde-C/&gt;

==Public health==
{{further2|[[Vaccine controversy#Alternative medicine|Vaccine controversy and alternative medicine]]|[[Water fluoridation controversy]]}}
Some chiropractors oppose [[vaccination]] and [[water fluoridation]], which are common [[public health]] practices.&lt;ref name=Murphy-pod/&gt; Within the chiropractic community there are significant disagreements about vaccination,&lt;ref name=Busse/&gt;&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; one of the most cost-effective public health interventions available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Ehreth J|title= The global value of vaccination|journal=Vaccine|volume=21|issue=7–8|pages=596–600|year=2003|pmid=12531324|doi=10.1016/S0264-410X(02)00623-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most chiropractic writings on vaccination focus on its negative aspects,&lt;ref name=Busse/&gt; claiming that it is hazardous, ineffective, and unnecessary.&lt;!--&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; --&gt; Some chiropractors have embraced vaccination, but a significant portion of the profession rejects it, as original chiropractic philosophy traces diseases to causes in the spine and states that vaccines interfere with healing.&lt;ref name=Campbell/&gt; 

The extent to which anti-vaccination views sustain the current chiropractic profession is uncertain.&lt;ref name=Busse/&gt; The [[American Chiropractic Association]] and the International Chiropractors Association support individual exemptions to compulsory vaccination laws, and a 1995 survey of U.S. chiropractors found that about a third believed there was no scientific proof that immunization prevents disease.&lt;ref name=Campbell&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Pediatrics|year=2000|volume=105|issue=4|pages=e43|title= Chiropractors and vaccination: a historical perspective|author= Campbell JB, Busse JW, Injeyan HS|pmid=10742364|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/content/full/105/4/e43|doi= 10.1542/peds.105.4.e43}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Canadian Chiropractic Association]] supports vaccination;&lt;ref name=Busse&gt;{{cite journal|journal= J Manipulative Physiol Ther|year=2005|volume=28|issue=5|pages=367–73|title= Chiropractic antivaccination arguments|author= Busse JW, Morgan L, Campbell JB|doi=10.1016/j.jmpt.2005.04.011|pmid=15965414|url= http://jmptonline.org/article/S0161-4754(05)00111-9/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt; a survey in Alberta in 2002 found that 25% of chiropractors advised patients for, and 27% against, vaccinating themselves or their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Russell ML, Injeyan HS, Verhoef MJ, Eliasziw M|title= Beliefs and behaviours: understanding chiropractors and immunization|journal=Vaccine|volume=23|issue=3|pages=372–9|year=2004|pmid=15530683|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2004.05.027}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early opposition to water fluoridation included chiropractors, some of whom continue to oppose it as being incompatible with chiropractic philosophy and an infringement of personal freedom. Other chiropractors have actively promoted fluoridation, and several chiropractic organizations have endorsed scientific principles of public health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal= Am J Public Health|year=1989|volume=79|issue=10|pages=1405–8|title= Fluoridation referendum in La Crosse, Wisconsin: contributing factors to success|author= Jones RB, Mormann DN, Durtsche TB|pmid=2782512|pmc=1350185|url=http://www.ajph.org/cgi/reprint/79/10/1405.pdf|format=PDF|doi= 10.2105/AJPH.79.10.1405}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to traditional chiropractic opposition to water fluoridation and vaccination, chiropractors' attempts to establish a positive reputation for their public health role are also compromised by their reputation for recommending repetitive lifelong chiropractic treatment.&lt;ref name=Murphy-pod/&gt;

Chiropractors' tendency to assert the meaningfulness of various theories and methods as a counterpoint to allopathic charges of quackery has created a defensiveness which can make critical examination of chiropractic concepts difficult (Keating and Mootz 1989). One example of this conundrum is the continuing controversy about the presumptive target of DCs' adjustive interventions: subluxation (Gatterman 1995; Leach 1994).}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chiropractic has been controversial, though to a lesser extent than in past years.&lt;ref name=&quot;DeVocht-JW&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Clin Orthop Relat Res|year=2006|volume=444|pages=243–9|title=History and overview of theories and methods of chiropractic: a counterpoint|author=DeVocht JW|doi=10.1097/01.blo.0000203460.89887.8d|pmid=16523145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The American Medical Association has been long been particularly critical, as indicated by a 1966 targeting of chiropracters described as a &quot;national campaign against medical quackery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_hcfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=F5sEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6974,3060990&amp;dq=chiropractor+quack&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;
