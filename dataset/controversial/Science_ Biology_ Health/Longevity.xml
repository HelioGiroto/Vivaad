      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27854">[[Image:Comparison_gender_life_expectancy_CIA_factbook.svg|thumb|right|400px|Comparison of male and female life expectancy at birth for countries and territories as defined in the 2011 CIA Factbook, with selected bubbles labelled. The green dotted line corresponds to equal female and male life expectancy. The apparent 3D volumes of the bubbles are linearly proportional to their population.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2102.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2119.html]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The word &quot;'''longevity'''&quot; is sometimes used as a synonym for &quot;[[life expectancy]]&quot; in [[demography]] - especially when it concerns someone or something lasting longer than expected (an ancient tree, for example) - however, the two words have slightly different definitions. In a similar dichotomy to  &quot;[[precision]]&quot; and &quot;[[accuracy]]&quot;, &quot;longevity&quot; refers to the average number of years that a single person lives, whereas &quot;life expectancy&quot; refers to the number of years that the average population lives. This is illustrated by the fact that a drastic increase in life expectancy (due to a larger portion of the population beginning to live longer) may be accompanied by a small increase in the overall longevity of the population.

Reflections on longevity have usually gone beyond acknowledging the brevity of human life and have included thinking about methods to extend life. Longevity has been a topic not only for the scientific community but also for writers of [[Hyperborei|travel]], [[science fiction]], and [[utopia]]n novels.

There are many difficulties in authenticating the longest human [[maximum life span|life span]] ever by modern verification standards, owing to inaccurate or incomplete birth statistics. Fiction, legend, and folklore have proposed or claimed life spans in the past or future vastly longer than those verified by modern standards, and [[longevity narratives]] and unverified [[longevity claims]] frequently speak of their existence in the present.

A [[life annuity]] is a form of [[longevity insurance]].

==History==
A remarkable statement mentioned by [[Diogenes Laertius]] (c. 250 AD) is the earliest (or at least one of the earliest) references about ''plausible'' centenarian longevity given by a scientist, the astronomer [[Hipparchus]] of Nicea (c. 185 – c. 120 BC), who, according to the [[doxographer]], was ''assured'' that the philosopher [[Democritus of Abdera]] (c. 470/460 – c. 370/360 BC) lived 109 years. All other accounts given by the ancients about the age of Democritus appear, without giving any specific age, to agree that the philosopher lived over 100 years. This possibility is likely, given that many ancient Greek philosophers are thought to have lived over the age of 90 (e.g.,  [[Xenophanes of Colophon]], c. 570/565 – c. 475/470 BC, [[Pyrrho]] of Ellis, c. 360 – c. 270 BC,  [[Eratosthenes]] of Cirene, c. 285 – c. 190 BC, etc.). The case of Democritus is different from the case of, for example, [[Epimenides]] of Crete (7th, 6th centuries BC), who is said to have lived 154, 157 or 290 years, as has been said about countless elders even during the last centuries as well as in the present time. These cases are not verifiable by modern means.

==Present life expectancy==
{{Main|List of countries by life expectancy}}
Various factors contribute to an individual's longevity. Significant factors in life expectancy include [[gender]], [[genetics]], access to [[health care]], [[hygiene]], diet and [[nutrition]], [[exercise]], [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]], and [[crime rates]]. Below is a list of life expectancies in different types of countries:&lt;ref name=&quot;ciawfb2010&quot;&gt;The US [[Central Intelligence Agency]], 2010, [[CIA World Factbook]], retrieved 12 Jan. 2011, https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Developed country|Developed countries]]: 77–90 years (e.g. [[Canada]]: 81.29 years, 2010 est.)
*[[Developing country|Developing countries]]: 32–80 years (e.g. [[Mozambique]]: 41.37 years, 2010 est.)

Population [[Life tables|longevities]] are increasing as life expectancies around the world grow:&lt;ref name=&quot;ciawfb2010&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ciawfb2002&quot;&gt;The US [[Central Intelligence Agency]], 2002, [[CIA World Factbook]], retrieved 12 Jan. 2011, http://www.theodora.com/wfb/2002/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Long-lived individuals==
The [[Gerontology Research Group]] validates current longevity records by modern standards, and maintains a [[list of supercentenarians]]; many other unvalidated [[longevity claims]] exist. Record-holding individuals include:
*[[Geert Adriaans Boomgaard]] (1788–1899, 110 years, 135 days): first person to reach the age of 110 (on September 21, 1898) and whose age could be validated.
*[[Jeanne Calment]] (1875–1997, 122 years, 164 days): the oldest person in history whose age has been verified by modern documentation. This defines the modern human [[maximum life span|life span]], which is set by the oldest documented individual who ever lived.
*[[Sarah Knauss]] (1880–1999, 119 years, 97 days): the second oldest documented person in modern times and the oldest American.
*[[Christian Mortensen]] (1882–1998, 115 years, 252 days): the oldest man in history whose age has been verified by modern documentation.
*[[Besse Cooper]] (born 1896): celebrated her 116th birthday in August 2012, currently the oldest living person.

==Longevity and lifestyle==
Evidence-based studies indicate that longevity is based on two major factors, genetics and lifestyle choices.&lt;ref name=USC&gt;{{Cite news |first=Carl |last=Marziali |date=7 December 2010 |title=Reaching Toward the Fountain of Youth |url=http://uscnews.usc.edu/health/reaching_toward_the_fountain_of_youth.html |work=USC Trojan Family Magazine |accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twin studies have estimated that approximately 20-30% of an individual’s lifespan is related to genetics, the rest is due to individual behaviors and environmental factors which can be modified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hjelmborg |first=J. |last2=''et al.'' |year=2006 |title=Genetic influence on human lifespan and longevity |journal=[[Human Genetics (journal)|Human Genetics]] |volume=119 |issue=3 |pages=312–321 |doi=10.1007/s00439-006-0144-y |first2=Ivan |last3=Skytthe |first3=Axel |last4=Vaupel |first4=James W. |last5=McGue |first5=Matt |last6=Koskenvuo |first6=Markku |last7=Kaprio |first7=Jaakko |last8=Pedersen |first8=Nancy L. |last9=Christensen |first9=Kaare }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it found that lifestyle plays almost no factor in health and longevity after the age of 80, and that almost everything in advanced age is due to genetic factors.

In preindustrial times, deaths at young and middle age were common, and lifespans over 70 years were comparatively rare. This is not due to genetics, but because of environmental factors such as disease, accidents, and malnutrition, especially since the former were not generally treatable with pre-20th century medicine. Deaths from childbirth were common in women, and many children did not live past infancy. In addition, most people who did attain old age were likely to die quickly from the above-mentioned untreatable health problems. Despite this, we do find a large number of examples of pre-20th century individuals attaining lifespans of 75 years or greater, including [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[John Adams]], [[Cato the Elder]], [[Thomas Hobbes]], [[Eric of Pomerania]], [[Christopher Polhem]], and [[Michaelangelo]]. This was also true for poorer people like [[peasant]]s or [[laborer]]s. [[Genealogy|Genealogists]] will almost certainly find ancestors living to their 70s, 80s and even 90s several hundred years ago.

For example, an 1871 census in the UK (the first of its kind) found the average male life expectancy as being 44, but if infant mortality is subtracted, males who lived to adulthood averaged 75 years. The present male life expectancy in the UK is 77 years for males and 81 for females (the United States averages 74 for males and 80 for females).

Studies have shown that African-American males have the shortest lifespans of any group of people in the US, averaging only 69 years (Asian American females average the longest)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=John |last=Keaten |date=17 October 2012 |title=Health in America Today|url=http://www.measureofamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/AHDP-HEALTH-FACT-SHEET-11.08.10.pdf |work= Measure of America |accessdate=17 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This reflects overall poorer health and greater prevalence of heart disease, obesity, diabetes, and cancer among African-American men.

Women normally outlive men, and this was as true in pre-industrial times as today. Theories for this include smaller bodies (and thus less stress on the heart), a stronger immune system (since testosterone acts as an immunosuppressant), and less tendency to engage in physically dangerous activities. It is also theorized that women have an evolutionary reason to live longer so as to help care for grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

Study of the regions of the world known as [[Blue Zone|blue zones]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Buettner |first=D. |year=2008 |title=The Blue Zones |publisher=National Geographic Society |location=Washington, DC }}&lt;/ref&gt; where people commonly live active lives past 100 years of age, have speculated that longevity is related to a healthy social and family life, not smoking, eating a plant-based diet, frequent consumption of legumes and nuts, and engaging in regular physical activity. In another well-designed cohort study, the combination of a plant based diet, frequent consumption of nuts, regular physical activity, normal BMI, and not smoking accounted for differences up to 10 years in life expectancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Gary E. |last=Fraser |first2=David J. |last2=Shavlik |year=2001 |title=Ten Years of Life: Is It a Matter of Choice? |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=161 |issue=13 |pages=1645–1652 |doi= 10.1001/archinte.161.13.1645|pmid=11434797 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Alameda County Study]] hypothesized three additional lifestyle characteristics that promote longevity: limiting alcohol consumption, sleeping 7 to 8 hours per night, and not [[wikt:snack|snacking]] (eating between meals).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaplan |first=George A. |last2=Seeman |first2=Teresa E. |last3=Cohen |first3=Richard D. |last4=''et al.'' |year=1987 |title=Mortality Among the Elderly in the Alameda County Study: Behavioral and Demographic Risk Factors |journal=[[American Journal of Public Health]] |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=307–312 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.77.3.307 |first4=L P |last5=Guralnik |first5=J }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Longevity traditions==
{{Main|Longevity traditions|Longevity claims}}
[[Longevity traditions]] are traditions about long-lived people (generally [[supercentenarian]]s), and practices that have been believed to confer longevity.&lt;ref name=trad1&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=01GzLB2ta3oC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;dq=%22longevity+tradition%22|title=Secrets of Longevity|quote=Chuan xiong ... has long been a key herb in the longevity tradition of China, prized for its powers to boost the immune system, activate blood circulation, and relieve pain.|first=Maoshing|last=Ni|isbn=978-0-8118-4949-4|year=2006|publisher=Chronicle Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trad2&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ABTO93imwQwC&amp;pg=PA27&amp;dq=%22longevity+tradition%22|title=An End to Ageing: Remedies for Life|quote=Taoist devotion to immortality is important to us for two reasons.

The [[Fountain of Youth]] reputedly restores the youth of anyone who drinks of its waters. The [[New Testament]], following older Jewish tradition, attributes healing to the [[Pool of Bethesda]] when the waters are &quot;stirred&quot; by an angel.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||John|5:4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; After the death of [[Juan Ponce de León]], [[Gonzalo Fernández de Oviedo]] wrote in ''Historia General y Natural de las Indias'' (1535) that Ponce de León was looking for the waters of [[Bimini]] to cure his aging.&lt;ref&gt;Fernández de Oviedo, Gonzalo. ''Historia General y Natural de las Indias'', book 16, chapter XI.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditions that have been believed to confer greater human longevity also include [[alchemy]],&lt;ref name=kohn&gt;{{Cite book|title=Daoism and Chinese Culture|last=Kohn|first=Livia|year=2001|publisher=Three Pines Press|pages=4, 84|url=http://books.google.com/?id=2AURAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22longevity+tradition%22&amp;dq=%22longevity+tradition%22|isbn=978-1-931483-00-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as that attributed to [[Nicolas Flamel]].

More recent [[longevity claims]] are subcategorized by many editions of ''[[Guinness World Records]]'' into four groups: &quot;In late life, very old people often tend to advance their ages at the rate of about 17 years per decade .... Several celebrated super-centenarians (over 110 years) are believed to have been double lives (father and son, relations with the same names or successive bearers of a title) .... A number of instances have been commercially sponsored, while a fourth category of recent claims are those made for political ends ....&quot;&lt;ref name=g&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Guinness Book of World Records]]|year=1983|pages=16–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The estimate of 17 years per decade was corroborated by the 1901 and 1911 British censuses.&lt;ref name=&quot;g&quot;/&gt; Mazess and Forman also discovered in 1978 that inhabitants of [[Vilcabamba, Ecuador]], claimed excessive longevity by using their fathers' and grandfathers' baptismal entries.&lt;ref name=g/&gt;&lt;ref name=ng&gt;{{Cite news|author=Leaf, Alexander|date=January 1973|title=Search for the Oldest People|work=National Geographic|pages=93–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' magazine considered that, by the Soviet Union, longevity had been elevated to a state-supported &quot;Methuselah cult&quot;.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,908667-1,00.html|title=No Methuselahs|date=1974-08-12|accessdate=2009-05-13|work=[[Time Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert L. Ripley]] regularly reported supercentenarian claims in [[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]], usually citing his own reputation as a fact-checker to claim reliability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=[[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]] 15th Series|publisher=[[Pocket Books]]|location=New York City|date=September 1969|author=Ripley Enterprises, Inc.|pages=112, 84, 56|quote=The Old Man of the Sea / Yaupa / a native of Futuna, one of the New Hebrides Islands / regularly worked his own farm at the age of 130 / He died in 1899 of measles — a children's disease ...

==Future==
The [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] view on the future of longevity is that life expectancy in the [[United States]] will be in the mid-80s by 2050 (up from 77.85 in 2006) and will top out eventually in the low 90s, barring major scientific advances that can change the rate of human aging itself, as opposed to merely treating the effects of aging as is done today. The Census Bureau also predicted that the United States would have 5.3 million people aged over 100 in 2100. The [[United Nations]] has also made projections far out into the future, up to 2300, at which point it projects that life expectancies in most developed countries will be between 100 and 106 years and still rising, though more and more slowly than before. These projections also suggest that life expectancies in poor countries will still be less than those in rich countries in 2300, in some cases by as much as 20 years. The UN itself mentioned that gaps in life expectancy so far in the future may well not exist, especially since the exchange of technology between rich and poor countries and the [[industrialization]] and development of poor countries may cause their life expectancies to converge fully with those of rich countries long before that point, similarly to the way life expectancies between rich and poor countries have already been converging over the last 60 years as better medicine, technology, and living conditions became accessible to many people in poor countries. The UN has warned that these projections are uncertain, and cautions that any change or advancement in medical technology could invalidate such projections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/esa/population/publications/longrange2/WorldPop2300final.pdf World Population to 2300], [[United Nations]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent increases in the rates of [[lifestyle diseases]], such as [[obesity]], [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|diabetes]], [[hypertension]], and [[heart disease]], may drastically slow or reverse this trend toward increasing life expectancy in the developed world.

Scientist Olshansky examined how much mortality from various causes would have to drop in order to boost life expectancy and concluded that most of the past increases in life expectancy occurred because of improved survival rates for young people.  He states that it seems unlikely that life expectancy at birth will ever exceed 85 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Jennifer Couzin-Frankel |title= A Pitched Battle Over Life Span |journal=Science|pages= 549–50 |volume= 333 |date= 29 July 2011|doi= 10.1126/science.333.6042.549|pmid= 21798928|issue= 6042}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, since 1840, record life expectancy has risen [[linear]]ly for men and women, albeit more slowly for men. For women the increase has been almost three months per year. In light of steady increase, without any sign of limitation, the suggestion that life expectancy will top out must be treated with caution. Scientists Oeppen and Vaupel observe that experts who assert that &quot;life expectancy is approaching a ceiling ... have repeatedly been proven wrong.&quot; It is thought that life expectancy for women has increased more dramatically owing to the considerable advances in medicine related to childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Mice have been genetically engineered to live twice as long as ordinary mice.  Drugs such as deprenyl are a part of the prescribing pharmacopia of veterinarians specifically to increase mammal lifespan.  A large plurality of research chemicals have been described at the scientific literature that increase the lifespan of a number of species.

Some argue that [[molecular nanotechnology]] will greatly extend human life spans. If the rate of increase of life span can be raised with these technologies to a level of twelve months increase per year, this is defined as effective [[biological immortality]] and is the goal of radical life extension.

==Biological immortality==
{{Main|Biological immortality}}
Certain exotic organisms do not seem to be subject to aging and can live indefinitely. Examples include [[Tardigrades]] and [[Hydra (genus)|Hydras]]. That is not to say that these organisms cannot die, merely that they only die as a result of disease or injury rather than age-related deterioration (and that they are not subject to the [[Hayflick limit]]).
