A 1998 [[systematic review]] of studies assessing its prevalence in 13 countries concluded that about 31% of cancer patients use some form of complementary and alternative medicine.&lt;ref name=Ernst_Cassileth&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ernst E, Cassileth BR |title=The prevalence of complementary/alternative medicine in cancer: a systematic review |journal=Cancer |volume=83 |issue=4 |pages=777–82 |year=1998 |month=August |pmid=9708945 |doi= 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19980815)83:4&lt;777::AID-CNCR22&gt;3.0.CO;2-O|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative medicine varies from country to country. Jurisdictions where alternative medical practices are sufficiently widespread may license and regulate them. [[Edzard Ernst]] has said that in Austria and Germany complementary and alternative medicine is mainly in the hands of physicians,&lt;ref name=&quot;ernstinterview&quot;/&gt; while some estimates suggest that at least half of American alternative practitioners are physicians.&lt;ref name=Cassileth1996&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Barrie R.

Alternative medicine methods are diverse in their foundations and methodologies. Methods may incorporate or base themselves on  [[traditional medicine]], [[Home remedy|folk knowledge]], spiritual beliefs, or newly conceived approaches to healing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Acharya, Deepak and Shrivastava Anshu |year=2008 |title=Indigenous Herbal Medicines: Tribal Formulations and Traditional Herbal Practices |publisher=Aavishkar Publishers Distributor |location=[[Jaipur]] |isbn=978-81-7910-252-7 |page=440}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Although heterogeneous, the major CAM systems have many common characteristics, including a focus on individualizing treatments, treating the whole person, promoting self-care and self-healing, and recognizing the spiritual nature of each individual. In addition, many CAM systems have characteristics commonly found in mainstream healthcare, such as a focus on good nutrition and preventive practices. Unlike mainstream medicine, CAM often lacks or has only limited experimental and clinical study; however, scientific investigation of CAM is beginning to address this knowledge gap. Thus, boundaries between CAM and mainstream medicine, as well as among different CAM systems, are often blurred and are constantly changing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;whccamp.hhs.gov&quot;/&gt;

Many of the claims regarding the efficacy of alternative medicines are controversial. While one-third of alternative treatments have some published literature supporting their use, research on alternative medicine is frequently of low quality and methodologically flawed, which might cause these results to be exaggerated.&lt;ref name=IOM2005/&gt; Some researchers state that the evidence-based approach to defining CAM is problematic because some CAM is tested, and research suggests that many mainstream medical techniques lack solid evidence.{{vague|date=November 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kopelman, Lorretta M. |chapter=The role of science in assessing conventional, complementary, and alternative medicines |title=The Role of Complementary and Alternative Medicine: Accommodating Pluralism |series-title=Hastings Center Studies in Ethics Series |editor=Callahan D |publisher=Georgetown University Press |location=Washington, DC |year=2004 |pages=36–53 |isbn=978-1-58901-016-1 |oclc=47791087 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terms==
The term 'alternative medicine' is generally used to describe practices used independently or in place of conventional medicine. The term 'complementary medicine' is primarily used to describe practices employed in conjunction with or to complement conventional medical treatments. NCCAM cites the use of acupuncture in addition to usual care in order to help lessen pain as an example of complementary medicine.&lt;ref name=whatiscam&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/| title=What is Complementary and Alternative Medicine (CAM)? |accessdate=2006-07-11 |publisher=[[NCCAM|National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5C1oRX8Qq | archivedate = 2005-12-08| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The terms 'integrative' or 'integrated medicine' indicate combinations of conventional and alternative medical treatments that have some scientific proof of efficacy; such practices are viewed by advocates as the best examples of complementary medicine.&lt;ref name=whatiscam/&gt; Alternative medicine often relies on using word play to give the appearance of effectiveness and to suggest that a dichotomy exists. One example of this is the use of &quot;Western medicine&quot; and &quot;Eastern medicine&quot; to suggest that the difference is not between [[evidence based medicine]] and treatments which don't work, whether from east or west.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=SAMPSON|first=WALLACE|title=ANTISCIENCE TRENDS IN THE RISE OF THE “ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE’MOVEMENT|journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|date=1 June 1995|volume=775|issue=1|pages=188–197|doi=10.1111/j.1749-6632.1996.tb23138.x|page=189-191}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Whole medical systems'' see &quot;spiritual wholeness&quot; as the root of physiological and physical well-being.&lt;ref name=Oxford&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford Textbook of Spirituality in Healthcare.|year=2012|publisher=Oxford Univ press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-957139-0|pages=191–196|first=Margaret|last=Stuber|chapter=Complementary, alternative, and integrative medicine|coauthors=Brandon Horn|editor=Cobb, Puchalski, and Rumbold|page=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ayurveda]], [[Chinese medicine]], [[Homeopathy]] and [[Naturopathy]] are cited as examples&lt;ref name=NCCAM&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/ |title= What is CAM? |publisher=NCCAM |year=2007 |accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term appears to have entered into usage through the [[National Institute of Health]]'s [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] (NCCAM), which began to employ it as a substitute for ''alternative medical systems'' as a way of differentiating widely comprehensive systems of medicine, such as Ayurvedic medicine, from specialized alternative approaches.&lt;ref&gt;[www.fda.gov/downloads/regulatoryinformation/guidances/ucm145405.pdf [[FDA]] regulatory information guidelines]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ralph Snyderman]] and [[Andrew Weil]] state that &quot;integrative medicine is not synonymous with complementary and alternative medicine. It has a far larger meaning and mission in that it calls for restoration of the focus of medicine on health and healing and emphasizes the centrality of the patient-physician relationship.&quot;&lt;ref name=Snyderman&gt;{{cite journal |author=Snyderman R, Weil AT |title=Integrative medicine: bringing medicine back to its roots |journal=Archives of Internal Medicine |volume=162 |issue=4 |pages=395–7 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11863470 |doi=10.1001/archinte.162.4.395}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- WE CAN'T USE PROJECTIONS SEVERAL YEARS AFTER THE FACT; ALSO, THE ESTIMATE IS UNCITED In 2002, the growth estimate during the years 1995 to 2005 in the USA and other developed countries for the number of chiropractors, acupuncturists, naturopaths, and other nonphysician clinicians was double that of physicians.&lt;ref name=Cassileth&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cassileth, Barrie R. | title = The Role of Complementary &amp; Alternative Medicine: Accommodating Pluralism | journal = NEJM | volume = 347 | pages = 860–861 | year = 2002 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM200209123471123 | issue = 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

==History==
The use of plants as medicines predates written human history. A 60,000-year-old Neanderthal burial site, &quot;[[Shanidar Cave#Shanidar 4.2C the .22flower burial.22|Shanidar IV]]&quot;, in northern Iraq has yielded large amounts of pollen from 8 plant species, 7 of which are used now as herbal remedies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.190.4217.880 | bibcode = 1975Sci...190..880S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterization==
There is no clear and consistent definition for either alternative or complementary medicine.&lt;ref name=IOM2005&gt;{{cite book |author=Institute of Med |title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States |publisher=National Academy Press |location= |year=2005 |pages= |isbn=978-0-309-09270-8 |oclc= |url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=11182 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|17}}  In [[Western culture]] it is often defined as any healing practice &quot;that does not fall within the realm of conventional [[medicine]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=bratman7/&gt; or &quot;that which has not been shown consistently to be effective.&quot;&lt;ref name=MFL&gt;{{cite web |url=http://missourifolkloresociety.truman.edu/remedy.html |title=A few words about folk medicine |work=Missouri Folklore Society |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-characterization===
The US [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] (NCCAM) defines CAM as &quot;a group of diverse medical and healthcare systems, practices, and products, that are not currently part of conventional medicine.&quot;&lt;ref name=whatiscam/&gt;

The Danish Knowledge and Research Center for Alternative Medicine an independent institution under the Danish Ministry of the Interior and Health (Danish abbreviation: ViFAB) uses the term “alternative medicine” for:
* Treatments performed by therapists that are not authorized healthcare professionals
* Treatments performed by authorized healthcare professionals, but those based on methods otherwise used mainly outside the healthcare system. People without a healthcare authorisation must be able to perform the treatments.

The [[Cochrane Collaboration]] Complementary Medicine Field finds that what is considered complementary or alternative practices in one country may be considered conventional medical practices in another. Their definition is, therefore, general: &quot;complementary medicine includes all such practices and ideas that are outside the domain of conventional medicine in several countries and defined by its users as preventing or treating illness, or promoting health and well-being.&quot;&lt;ref name=Cochranedefinition&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/cochrane/clabout/articles/CE000052/frame.html |title=Cochrane Complementary Medicine Field |work=Cochrane COllaboration |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an example [[biofeedback]] is commonly used within the Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation community but is considered alternative within the medical community as a whole. While some herbal therapies are mainstream in Europe, but are alternative in the United States.&lt;ref name=CompAltMentalHealth&gt;{{cite book |author=Walter R., PhD.

But assertions, speculation, and testimonials do not substitute for evidence. Alternative treatments should be subjected to scientific testing no less rigorous than that required for conventional treatments.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Cassileth2&gt;Park RL, Goodenough U: Buying snake oil with tax dollars.

===Institutions===
The United States' [[National Science Foundation]] has defined alternative medicine as &quot;all treatments that have not been proven effective using scientific methods.&quot;&lt;ref name=NSF_altmed/&gt; In a consensus report released in 2005, entitled ''Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States'', the [[Institute of Medicine]] (IOM) defined complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) as the non-dominant approach to medicine in a given culture and historical period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iom.edu/Reports/2005/Complementary-and-Alternative-Medicine-in-the-United-States.aspx |title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine in the United States |publisher=United States [[Institute of Medicine]] |pages=16–20 |date=12 January 2005 |quote=Complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) is a broad domain of resources that encompasses health systems, modalities, and practices and their accompanying theories and beliefs, other than those intrinsic to the dominant health system of a particular society or culture in a given historical period. CAM includes such resources perceived by their users as associated with positive health outcomes. Boundaries within CAM and between the CAM domain and the domain of the dominant system are not always sharp or fixed. |accessdate=2011-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar definition has been adopted by the Cochrane Collaboration,&lt;ref name=Cochranedefinition /&gt; and official government bodies such as the UK Department of Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/en/Publichealth/Healthimprovement/Complementaryandalternativemedicine/index.htm |title=Complementary and alternative medicine : Department of Health – Public health |work=Department of Health |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of evidence-based medicine, such as the [[Cochrane Collaboration]], use the term alternative medicine but agree that all treatments, whether &quot;mainstream&quot; or &quot;alternative&quot;, ought to be held to the standards of the scientific method.&lt;ref name=&quot;UMM&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.compmed.umm.edu/cochrane.asp |title=Cochrane CAM Field: Integrative Medicine |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientists===
Numerous mainstream scientists and physicians have commented on and criticised alternative medicine.

There is a debate among medical researchers over whether any therapy may be properly classified as 'alternative medicine'.  Some claim that there is only medicine that has been adequately tested and that which has not.&lt;ref name=Angell/&gt; They feel that healthcare practices should be classified based solely on [[evidence-based medicine|scientific evidence]].  If a treatment has been rigorously tested and found safe and effective, traditional medicine will adopt it regardless of whether it was considered &quot;alternative&quot; to begin with.&lt;ref name=Angell/&gt; It is thus possible for a method to change categories (proven vs. unproven), based on increased knowledge of its effectiveness or lack thereof. Prominent supporters of this position include [[George D. Lundberg]], former editor of the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] (JAMA).&lt;ref name=Fontanarosa&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fontanarosa PB, Lundberg GD |title=Alternative medicine meets science |journal=JAMA |volume=280 |issue=18 |pages=1618–9 |year=1998 |month=November |pmid=9820267 |doi= 10.1001/jama.280.18.1618|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stephen Barrett]], founder and operator of [[Quackwatch]], argues that practices labeled &quot;alternative&quot; should be reclassified as either genuine, experimental, or questionable. Here he defines genuine as being methods that have sound evidence for safety and effectiveness, experimental as being unproven but with a plausible rationale for effectiveness, and questionable as groundless without a scientifically plausible rationale.  He has concerns that just because some &quot;alternatives&quot; have merit, there is the impression that the rest deserve equal consideration and respect even though most are worthless.&lt;ref name=Quackwatch&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Barrett|title=Be Wary of &quot;Alternative&quot; Health Methods|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/altwary.html|work=[[Stephen Barrett|Stephen Barrett, M.D.]]|publisher=[[Quackwatch]]|date=February 10, 2004 |accessdate = 2008-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He says that there is a policy at the NIH of never saying something doesn't work only that a different version or dose might give different results.&lt;ref name=&quot;$2.5 billion&quot;/&gt;

[[Edzard Ernst]], professor of complementary medicine, characterizes the evidence for many alternative techniques as weak, nonexistent, or negative, but states that evidence exists for others, in particular certain herbs and acupuncture.&lt;ref name=goodbadugly&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.healthwatch-uk.org/awardwinners/edzardernst.html |title=Complementary medicine: the good the bad and the ugly |work=Edzard Ernst |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ernst has concluded that 95% of the alternative treatments he and his team have studied, including acupuncture, herbal medicine, homeopathy, and reflexology, are, according to ''[[The Economist]]'', &quot;statistically indistinguishable from placebo treatments.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Economist]]'', &quot;[http://www.economist.com/node/18710090 Alternative Medicine:  Think yourself better]&quot;, 21 May 2011, pp. 83–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

They argued that the vast majority of studies were based on unconventional understandings of physiology and disease and have shown little or no effect. Further, they argue that the field's more-plausible interventions such as diet, relaxation, yoga and botanical remedies can be studied just as well in other parts of NIH, where they would need to compete with conventional research projects.&lt;ref name=Brown&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/16/AR2009031602139.html?hpid=sec-health |title=Scientists Speak Out Against Federal Funds for Research on Alternative Medicine|work=Washingtonpost |date=March 17, 2009 | first=David | last=Brown | accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An editorial in the ''[[The Economist|Economist]]'' characterized alternative medicine as  mostly &quot;quackery&quot; and described the vast majority as offering nothing more than the placebo effect.

==Classifications==
NCCAM has developed one of the most widely used classification systems for the branches of complementary and alternative medicine.&lt;ref name =IOM2005/&gt;&lt;ref name=whatiscam/&gt;  It classifies complementary and alternative therapies into five major groups, which have some overlap.&lt;ref name=whatiscam/&gt;

# Whole medical systems: cut across more than one of the other groups; examples include [[Traditional Chinese medicine]], [[Naturopathy]], [[Homeopathy]], and [[Ayurveda]]
# [[Mind-body medicine]]: takes a holistic approach to health that explores the interconnection between the mind, body, and spirit. It works under the premise that the mind can affect &quot;bodily functions and symptoms&quot;
# Biology-based practices: use substances found in nature such as herbs, foods, vitamins, and other natural substances
# Manipulative and body-based practices: feature manipulation or movement of body parts, such as is done in [[chiropractic]] and [[osteopathy|osteopathic]] manipulation
# [[Energy medicine]]: is a domain that deals with putative and verifiable energy fields:
#* [[Energy (spirituality)#Biofields|Biofield]] therapies are intended to influence energy fields that, it is purported, surround and penetrate the body. No empirical evidence has been found to support the existence of the putative energy fields on which these therapies are predicated.
#* [[Bioelectromagnetism|Bioelectromagnetic]]-based therapies use verifiable electromagnetic fields, such as pulsed fields, alternating-current, or direct-current fields in an unconventional manner.

Many people utilize mainstream medicine for [[medical diagnosis|diagnosis]] and basic information, while turning to alternatives for therapy or health-enhancing measures. Studies indicate that alternative approaches are often used [[#Use of CAM as a complement to conventional medicine|''in conjunction with'']] conventional medicine.&lt;ref name=pmid15188733/&gt; This is referred to by NCCAM as [[Glossary of alternative medicine terms#Integrative medicine|integrative (or integrated) medicine]] because it &quot;combines treatments from conventional medicine and CAM for which there is some high-quality evidence of safety and effectiveness.&quot;&lt;ref name=whatiscam/&gt; According to [[Andrew Weil|Andrew T.

A 1997 survey found that 13.7% of respondents in the United States had sought the services of both a medical doctor and an alternative medicine practitioner. The same survey found that 96% of respondents who sought the services of an alternative medicine practitioner also sought the services of a medical doctor in the past 12 months. Medical doctors are often unaware of their patient's use of alternative medical treatments as only 38.5% of the patients alternative therapies were discussed with their medical doctor.&lt;ref name=Eisenberg_trends&gt;{{cite journal |author=Eisenberg DM |title=Trends in alternative medicine use in the United States, 1990–1997: results of a follow-up national survey |journal=JAMA |volume=280 |issue=18 |pages=1569–75 |year=1998 |month=November |pmid=9820257 |doi=10.1001/jama.280.18.1569 |author-separator=, |author2=Davis RB |author3=Ettner SL |display-authors=3 |last4=Appel |first4=S |last5=Wilkey |first5=S |last6=Van Rompay |first6=M |last7=Kessler |first7=RC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of alternative medicine in developed countries appears to be increasing. A 1998 study showed that the use of alternative medicine had risen from 33.8% in 1990 to 42.1% in 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eisenberg_trends&quot;/&gt; In the United Kingdom, a 2000 report ordered by the [[House of Lords]] suggested that &quot;...limited data seem to support the idea that CAM use in the United Kingdom is high and is increasing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199900/ldselect/ldsctech/123/12301.htm House of Lords report on CAM] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5EsdOV0Sd|date =2006-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[developing country|developing nations]], access to essential medicines is severely restricted by lack of resources and [[poverty]].

Complementary therapies are often used in [[palliative care]] or by practitioners attempting to manage chronic pain in patients.  Complementary medicine is considered more acceptable in the interdisciplinary approach used in palliative care than in other areas of medicine.  &quot;From its early experiences of care for the dying, palliative care took for granted the necessity of placing patient values and lifestyle habits at the core of any design and delivery of quality care at the end of life. If the patient desired complementary therapies, and as long as such treatments provided additional support and did not endanger the patient, they were considered acceptable.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Allan Kellehear, Complementary medicine: is it more acceptable in palliative care practice?

* 62.1% had done so within the preceding twelve months.
* When [[prayer]] specifically for health reasons is excluded, these figures fall to 49.8% and 36.0%, respectively.
* 45.2% had in the last twelve months used prayer for health reasons, either through praying for their own health or through others praying for them.
* 54.9% used CAM in conjunction with conventional medicine.
* 14.8% &quot;sought care from a licensed or certified&quot; practitioner, suggesting that &quot;most individuals who use CAM prefer to treat themselves.&quot;
* The Dietary Supplement Industry is expected to be $250 Billion by 2016 worldwide
* Most people used CAM to treat and/or prevent musculoskeletal conditions or other conditions associated with chronic or recurring pain.
* &quot;Women were more likely than men to use CAM. The largest sex differential is seen in the use of [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Mind-body interventions|mind-body therapies]] including prayer specifically for health reasons&quot;.
* &quot;Except for the groups of therapies that included prayer specifically for health reasons, use of CAM increased as education levels increased&quot;.
* The most common CAM therapies used in the US in 2002 were prayer (45.2%), [[herbalism]] (18.9%), [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Breathing Meditation|breathing meditation]] (11.6%), [[meditation (alternative medicine)|meditation]] (7.6%), [[chiropractic medicine]] (7.5%), [[yoga (alternative medicine)|yoga]] (5.1%), [[body work (alternative medicine)|body work]] (5.0%), [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Diet-based therapy|diet-based therapy]] (3.5%), [[Terms and concepts in alternative medicine#Progressive Relaxation|progressive relaxation]] (3.0%), [[Orthomolecular medicine|mega-vitamin therapy]] (2.8%) and [[Visualization (cam)|Visualization]] (2.1%)

A 2008 survey of US hospitals by Health Forum, a subsidiary of the [[American Hospital Association]], found that more than 37 percent of responding hospitals indicated they offer one or more alternative medicine therapies, up from 26.5 percent in 2005. Additionally, hospitals in the southern Atlantic states were most likely to include CAM, followed by east north central states and those in the middle Atlantic.

In the United States, increasing numbers of medical colleges have started offering courses in alternative and complementary medicine. A 1998 study reported &quot;There is tremendous heterogeneity and diversity in content, format, and requirements among courses in complementary and alternative medicine at US medical schools&quot;.  Common topics included chiropractic, acupuncture, homeopathy, herbal therapies, and mind-body techniques. In three separate research surveys that surveyed 729 schools (125 medical schools offering a [[Doctor of Medicine]] degree (M.D.), 25 medical schools offering a [[Doctor of Osteopathic Medicine]] degree (D.O.), and 585 schools offering a nursing degree), 60% of the medical schools, 95% of osteopathic medical schools and 84.8% of the nursing schools teach some form of CAM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Wetzel MS, Eisenberg DM, Kaptchuk TJ |title=Courses involving complementary and alternative medicine at US medical schools |journal=JAMA |volume=280 |issue=9 |pages=784–7 |year=1998 |month=September |pmid=9729989 |doi=10.1001/jama.280.9.784}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Saxon DW, Tunnicliff G, Brokaw JJ, Raess BU |title=Status of complementary and alternative medicine in the osteopathic medical school curriculum |journal=The Journal of the American Osteopathic Association |volume=104 |issue=3 |pages=121–6 |year=2004 |month=March |pmid=15083987 |url=http://www.jaoa.org/cgi/content/full/104/3/121}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fenton MV, Morris DL |title=The integration of holistic nursing practices and complementary and alternative modalities into curricula of schools of nursing |journal=Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=62–7 |year=2003 |pmid=12868254}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[University of Arizona]] College of Medicine offers a program in Integrative Medicine under the leadership of [[Andrew Weil]] that trains physicians in various branches of alternative medicine that &quot;...neither rejects conventional medicine nor embraces alternative practices uncritically.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://integrativemedicine.arizona.edu/about/definition.html University of Arizona Center for Integrative Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt; Accredited Naturopathic colleges and universities are also increasing in number and popularity in Canada and the USA.

== Regulation ==

Because of the uncertain nature of various alternative therapies and the wide variety of claims different practitioners make, alternative medicine has been a source of vigorous debate, even over the definition of alternative medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yourfamilyshealth.com/alternative_medicine/first_do_no_harm/ Can Mainstream Medicine and Alternative Therapies Coexist?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liebertonline.com/doi/abs/10.1089/acm.2006.12.601 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. – The Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine – 12(7):601]&lt;/ref&gt; Dietary supplements, their ingredients, safety, and claims, are a continual source of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/HEALTH/alternative/9909/17/supplement.drug.journal/index.html | work=CNN | title=Nutritionist calls for tighter regulation of supplements | accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, political issues, mainstream medicine and alternative medicine all collide, such as in cases where synthetic drugs are legal but the herbal sources of the same active chemical are banned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/drugreporter/80582/ Former Surgeon General: Mainstream Medicine Has Endorsed Medical Marijuana | DrugReporter | AlterNet]&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, controversy over mainstream medicine causes questions about the nature of a treatment, such as water fluoridation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/84666.php Informed Public Debate Needed On Water Fluoridation]&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative medicine and mainstream medicine debates can also spill over into freedom of religion discussions, such as the right to decline lifesaving treatment for one's children because of religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbmh.ca/index.php/cbmh/article/view/604/601 Book Review by Janice Dickin – Rennie B. Schoepflin; Christian Science on Trial: Religious Healing in America.]&lt;/ref&gt; Government regulators continue to attempt to find a regulatory balance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebody.com/content/art32168.html Dietary Supplement Regulation: U.S. Food and Drug Administration Public Hearing]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jurisdiction]] differs concerning which branches of alternative medicine are legal, which are regulated, and which (if any) are provided by a government-controlled [[Publicly funded healthcare|health service]] or reimbursed by a [[health insurance|private health medical insurance company]].  The United Nations Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights – article 34 (''Specific legal obligations'') of the General Comment No. 14 (2000) on ''The right to the highest attainable standard of health'' – states that

{{quote|Furthermore, obligations to respect include a State's obligation to refrain from prohibiting or impeding traditional preventive care, healing practices and medicines, from marketing unsafe drugs and from applying coercive medical treatments, unless on an exceptional basis for the treatment of mental illness or the prevention and control of communicable diseases.|&lt;ref&gt;Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.

Specific implementations of this article are left to member states.

A number of alternative medicine advocates disagree with the restrictions of government agencies that approve medical treatments. In the '''United States''', for example, critics say that the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]]'s criteria for experimental evaluation methods impedes those seeking to bring useful and effective treatments and approaches to the public, and that their contributions and discoveries are unfairly dismissed, overlooked or suppressed. Alternative medicine providers recognize that [[health fraud]] occurs, and argue that it should be dealt with appropriately when it does, but that these restrictions should not extend to what they view as legitimate healthcare products.

In '''New Zealand''', alternative medicine products are classified as food products, so there are no regulations or safety standards in place.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ_Herald_10449883&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/legislation/news/article.cfm?c_id=247&amp;objectid=10449883 |title=''David Schnauer:'' Therapeutics bill must pass |date=6 July 2007 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of modern pharmaceuticals is strictly regulated to ensure that medicines contain a standardized quantity of active ingredients and are free from contamination. Alternative medicine products are not subject to the same governmental quality control standards, and consistency between doses can vary. This leads to uncertainty in the chemical content and biological activity of individual doses. This lack of oversight means that alternative health products are vulnerable to adulteration and contamination.&lt;ref name='Agin'&gt;{{cite book | last = Agin | first = Dan | title = Junk Science: how politicians, corporations, and other hucksters betray us | publisher = Thomas Dunne Books | date = 2006-10-03 | pages = Ch. 8 | isbn = 978-0-312-35241-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is magnified by international commerce, since different countries have different types and degrees of regulation. This can make it difficult for consumers to properly evaluate the risks and qualities of given products.

===Alternative therapists===

Denmark has a registration system for alternative therapy practitioners, RAB.&lt;ref name=RAB&gt;[http://www.vifab.dk/uk/alternative+medicine/registration+of+alternative+practitioners+-+rab Registration of Alternative Practitioners – RAB], [http://www.vifab.dk/uk Knowledge and Research Center for Alternative Medicines homepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

The [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine|NCCAM]] budget has been criticized&lt;ref name=&quot;HttpwwwwashingtonpostcomwpdyncontentarticleARhtml&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/16/AR2009031602139.html Scientists Speak Out Against Federal Funds for Research on Alternative Medicine – washingtonpost.com]&lt;/ref&gt; because, despite the duration and intensity of studies to measure the efficacy of alternative medicine, there had been no effective [[Complementary and Alternative Medicine|CAM]] treatments supported by scientific evidence as of 2002 according to the QuackWatch website.&lt;ref name=&quot;HttpwwwquackwatchorgQuackeryRelatedTopicsnccamhtml&quot;&gt;[http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/nccam.html Why the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine (NCCAM) Should Be Defunded]&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] budget has been on a sharp sustained rise to support complementary medicine.  In fact, the whole CAM field has been called by critics the SCAM.&lt;ref name=&quot;HttpwwwquackwatchorgQuackeryRelatedTopicsnccamhtml&quot; /&gt;

&quot;There really is no such thing as alternative medicine--only medicine that has been proved to work and medicine that has not.&quot; Arnold Relman, editor in chief emeritus of ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The New England Journal of Medicine, July 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;{{full}} Speaking of government funding studies of integrating alternative medicine techniques into the mainstream, [[Steven Novella]], a neurologist at Yale School of Medicine wrote that it &quot;is used to lend an appearance of legitimacy to treatments that are not legitimate.&quot; [[Marcia Angell]], former executive editor of ''The New England Journal of Medicine'' says, &quot;It's a new name for snake oil.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HttpwwwwashingtonpostcomwpdyncontentarticleARhtml&quot; /&gt;

Speaking of [[ethics]], in November 2011 [[Edzard Ernst]] stated that the &quot;level of misinformation about alternative medicine has now reached the point where it has become dangerous and unethical. So far, alternative medicine has remained an ethics-free zone. It is time to change this.&quot;&lt;ref name=ernst-ethics&gt;[[Edzard Ernst]].

== Alternative and evidence-based medicine ==

=== Efficacy {{anchor|Testing of efficacy}}===
Many alternative therapies have been tested with varying results. In 2003, a project funded by the CDC identified 208 condition-treatment pairs, of which 58% had been studied by at least one [[randomized controlled trial]] (RCT), and 23% had been assessed with a [[meta-analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Katz DL |title=The evidence base for complementary and alternative medicine: methods of Evidence Mapping with application to CAM |journal=Alternative Therapies in Health and Medicine |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=22–30 |year=2003 |pmid=12868249 |author-separator=, |author2=Williams AL |author3=Girard C |display-authors=3 |last4=Goodman |first4=J |last5=Comerford |first5=B |last6=Behrman |first6=A |last7=Bracken |first7=MB}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2005 book by a US [[Institute of Medicine]] panel, the number of RCTs focused on CAM has risen dramatically. The book cites Vickers (1998), who found that many of the CAM-related RCTs are in the Cochrane register, but 19% of these trials were not in MEDLINE, and 84% were in conventional medical journals.&lt;ref name=IOM2005/&gt;{{rp|133}}

As of 2005, the [[Cochrane Library]] had 145 CAM-related Cochrane systematic reviews and 340 non-Cochrane systematic reviews. An analysis of the conclusions of only the 145 Cochrane reviews was done by two readers. In 83% of the cases, the readers agreed. In the 17% in which they disagreed, a third reader agreed with one of the initial readers to set a rating. These studies found that, for CAM, 38.4% concluded positive effect or possibly positive (12.4%) effect, 4.8% concluded no effect, 0.69% concluded harmful effect, and 56.6% concluded insufficient evidence. An assessment of conventional treatments found that 41.3% concluded positive or possibly positive effect, 20% concluded no effect, 8.1% concluded net harmful effects, and 21.3% concluded insufficient evidence. However, the CAM review used the 2004 Cochrane database, while the conventional review used the 1998 Cochrane database.&lt;ref name=IOM2005/&gt;{{rp|135-136}}

Lists of the Cochrane Reviews on alternative medicine including summaries of the results sorted by type of therapy (updated monthly) are made available at ViFABs (Knowledge and Research Center for Alternative Medicines) home page, see the lists here: http://www.vifab.dk/uk/cochrane+and+alternative+medicine

Most alternative medical treatments are not [[patent]]able, which may lead to less research funding from the private sector. In addition, in most countries, alternative treatments (in contrast to pharmaceuticals) can be marketed without any proof of efficacy—also a disincentive for manufacturers to fund scientific research.&lt;ref name=Ernst2005&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ernst E |title=The efficacy of herbal medicine--an overview |journal=Fundamental &amp; Clinical Pharmacology |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=405–9 |year=2005 |month=August |pmid=16011726 |doi=10.1111/j.1472-8206.2005.00335.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have proposed adopting a [[prize]] system to reward medical research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Horrobin DF | year = 1986 | title = Glittering prizes for research support | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 324 | issue = 6094| page = 221 |bibcode=1986Natur.324..221H|doi=10.1038/324221a0}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, public funding for research exists. Increasing the funding for research on alternative medicine techniques is the purpose of the [[US National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]. NCCAM and its predecessor, the Office of Alternative Medicine, have spent more than $2.5 billion on such research since 1992; this research has largely not demonstrated the efficacy of alternative treatments.&lt;ref name=&quot;$2.5 billion&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name='nccam_$'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nccam.nih.gov/about/budget/appropriations.htm |title=NCCAM Funding: Appropriations History |accessdate=2008-04-02 |date=2008-01-09 |publisher=[[NCCAM]] | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5hSlSj9d5 | archivedate = 2009-06-11| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atwood2003&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Kimball C. | last=Atwood | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=The Ongoing Problem with the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine | date=2003-09 | publisher= | url =http://www.csicop.org/si/show/ongoing_problem_with_the_national_center | work =Skeptical Inquirer | pages = | accessdate = 2009-11-18 | language = | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20091116142044/http://www.csicop.org/si/show/ongoing_problem_with_the_national_center| archivedate= 16 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some skeptics of alternative practices say that a person may attribute symptomatic relief to an otherwise-ineffective therapy due to the [[placebo effect]], the natural recovery from or the cyclical nature of an illness (the [[regression fallacy]]), or the possibility that the person never originally had a true illness.&lt;ref&gt;James Alcock PhD, ''Alternative Medicine and the Psychology of Belief'', The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine, Fall/Winter 1999 Volume 3 ~ Number 2. [http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/altpsych.html available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same way as for conventional therapies, drugs, and interventions, it can be difficult to test the efficacy of alternative medicine in [[clinical trial]]s. In instances where an established, effective, treatment for a condition is already available, the [[Helsinki Declaration]] states that withholding such treatment is unethical in most circumstances. Use of standard-of-care treatment in addition to an alternative technique being tested may produce confounded or difficult-to-interpret results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|12356597}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cancer researcher Andrew J. Vickers has stated:

:Contrary to much popular and scientific writing, many alternative cancer treatments have been investigated in good-quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective. In this article, clinical trial data on a number of alternative cancer cures including Livingston-Wheeler, Di Bella Multitherapy, antineoplastons, vitamin C, hydrazine sulfate, [[Laetrile]], and psychotherapy are reviewed. The label &quot;unproven&quot; is inappropriate for such therapies; it is time to assert that many alternative cancer therapies have been &quot;disproven.&quot;|&lt;ref name=Vickers_disproven&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.3322/canjclin.54.2.110 | author = Andrew Vickers PhD | year = 2004 | title = Alternative Cancer Cures: &quot;Unproven&quot; or &quot;Disproven&quot;? | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.3322/canjclin.54.2.110/full | journal = [[CA Cancer J Clin]] | volume = 54 | issue = 2| pages = 110–118 | pmid=15061600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Safety ===
{{See also|List of herbs with known adverse effects}}

==== Interactions with conventional pharmaceuticals ====

Forms of alternative medicine that are biologically active can be dangerous even when used in conjunction with conventional medicine. Examples include immuno-augmentation therapy, shark cartilage, bioresonance therapy, oxygen and ozone therapies, insulin potentiation therapy. Some herbal remedies can cause dangerous interactions with chemotherapy drugs, radiation therapy, or anesthetics during surgery, among other problems.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cassileth BR, Deng G |title=Complementary and alternative therapies for cancer |journal=The Oncologist |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=80–9 |year=2004 |pmid=14755017 |doi=10.1634/theoncologist.9-1-80}}&lt;/ref&gt; An anecdotal example of these dangers was reported by Associate Professor Alastair MacLennan of Adelaide University, Australia regarding a patient who almost bled to death on the operating table after neglecting to mention that she had been taking &quot;natural&quot; potions to &quot;build up her strength&quot; before the operation, including a powerful anticoagulant that nearly caused her death.&lt;ref name='BenHills'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://benhills.com/articles/articles/MED06a.html |title=Fake healers. Why Australia's $1 billion-a-year alternative medicine industry is ineffective and out of control. |accessdate = 2008-03-06 |last=Hills |first=Ben |work=Medical Mayhem }}&lt;/ref&gt;

To ''ABC Online'', MacLennan also gives another possible mechanism:

:And lastly {{sic}} there's the cynicism and disappointment and depression that some patients get from going on from one alternative medicine to the next, and they find after three months the placebo effect wears off, and they're disappointed and they move on to the next one, and they're disappointed and disillusioned, and that can create depression and make the eventual treatment of the patient with anything effective difficult, because you may not get compliance, because they've seen the failure so often in the past.|&lt;ref name='ABC_Maclennan'&gt;{{cite news | first=Norman | last=Swan | coauthors= | title=Alternative Medicine – Part Three | date=2000-10-02 | publisher=ABC Radio National | url =http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/helthrpt/stories/s195441.htm | work =The Health Report | pages = | accessdate = 2008-03-06 | language = | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080306230537/http://www.abc.net.au/rn/talks/8.30/helthrpt/stories/s195441.htm| archivedate= 6 March 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Potential side-effects ====

Conventional treatments are subjected to testing for undesired [[Adverse effect (medicine)|side-effects]], whereas alternative treatments, in general, are not subjected to such testing at all. Any treatment – whether conventional or alternative – that has a biological or psychological effect on a patient may also have potential to possess dangerous biological or psychological side-effects. Attempts to refute this fact with regard to alternative treatments sometimes use the ''[[appeal to nature]]'' fallacy, i.e., &quot;that which is natural cannot be harmful&quot;.

An exception to the normal thinking regarding side-effects is [[Homeopathy]]. Since 1938, the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) has regulated homeopathic products in &quot;several significantly different ways from other drugs.&quot;&lt;ref name=Stehlin&gt;Isadora Stehlin. &quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071012070120/http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/096_home.html Homeopathy: Real Medicine or Empty Promises?]&quot; – FDA Consumer magazine (December 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; Homeopathic preparations, termed &quot;remedies,&quot; are extremely dilute, often far beyond the point where a single molecule of the original active (and possibly toxic) ingredient is likely to remain. They are, thus, considered safe on that count, but &quot;their products are exempt from good manufacturing practice requirements related to expiration dating and from finished product testing for identity and strength,&quot; and their alcohol concentration may be much higher than allowed in conventional drugs.&lt;ref name=Stehlin/&gt;

==== Treatment delay ====

Those having experienced or perceived success with one alternative therapy for a minor ailment may be convinced of its efficacy and persuaded to extrapolate that success to some other alternative therapy for a more serious, possibly life-threatening illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/extract/354/7/731 |title=NEJM – Drug-Related Hepatotoxicity |doi=10.1056/NEJMra052270 |publisher=Content.nejm.org |date=2006-05-18 |accessdate=2009-12-16|last1=Navarro|first1=Victor J.|last2=Senior|first2=John R.|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=354|issue=7|pages=731–9|pmid=16481640}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, critics argue that therapies that rely on the placebo effect to define success are very dangerous. According to mental health journalist Scott Lilienfeld in 2002, &quot;unvalidated or scientifically unsupported mental health practices can lead individuals to forgo effective treatments&quot; and refers to this as &quot;[[opportunity cost]]&quot;.

HIDING THIS SECTION FOR FURTHER CONSIDERATION
Secondary metabolites in thousands of plants are regularly tested by drug companies in search of new therapies. [[Atropa belladonna|Deadly nightshade]] contains atropine, a potent (and dangerous) substance useful in the treatment of a number of disorders, including as an antidote for nerve agents. Chemicals isolated from [[Foxglove]] are used in the treatment of epilepsy; [[Opiates]] derived from poppies are highly effective painkillers, and [[THC]], found in [[cannabis sativa]], is used to counter the effects of chemotherapy. Chemotherapy itself owes some of its constituent drugs to [[Chemotherapy#Plant alkaloids and terpenoids (L01C)|plant alkaloids]]. These name just a few of the most prominent classes of drugs derived from natural sources that have been adopted as treatments by alternative therapies.

In the US, many medical insurers and some hospitals integrate chiropractic and massage therapy as adjuncts to mainstream medical care.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==== Unconventional cancer &quot;cures&quot; ====

Perhaps because many forms of [[cancer]] are difficult or impossible to cure, there have always been many therapies offered outside of conventional cancer treatment centers and based on theories not found in [[biomedicine]]. These alternative cancer cures have often been described as &quot;unproven,&quot; suggesting that appropriate clinical trials have not been conducted and that the therapeutic value of the treatment is unknown. However, many alternative cancer treatments have been investigated in good-quality clinical trials, and they have been shown to be ineffective.

== Integrative medicine, complementary medicine, fringe medicine ==

[[Integrative medicine]] is the combination of the practices and methods of alternative/complementary medicine with conventional medicine.&lt;ref name=What_Is_CAM&gt;[http://nccam.nih.gov/health/whatiscam/ What Is Complementary and Alternative Medicine?] [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]]. .

It may also include practices not normally referred to as medicine, such as using [[prayer]], [[meditation]], [[socializing]], and [[recreation]] as therapies. Its academic proponents sometimes recommend misleading patients by using known placebo treatments in order to achieve a placebo effect.&lt;ref&gt;''&quot;real acupuncture treatments were no more effective than sham acupuncture treatments.

Criticism of integrative medicine includes about proposing to lie to patients about alternative medicines known to be no more than a placebo in order to achieve a [[placebo effect]], and “diverting research time, money, and other resources from more fruitful lines of investigation in order to pursue a theory that has no basis in biology”.&lt;ref name=&quot;Credulityabout&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Acupuncture Pseudoscience in the New England Journal of Medicine, Science Based Medicine, Steven Novella [http://www.sciencebasedmedicine.org/?p=6391 Science-Based Medicine » Acupuncture Pseudoscience in the New England Journal of Medicine]&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;[[Quackademic medicine]]&quot; is a pejorative term used for “[[integrative medicine]]”, when considered to be an infiltration of quackery into academic [[science-based medicine]], and was picked up by [[science-based medicine]] anti-ACM [[critics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Credulityabout&quot;/&gt;

===History===
Fueled by a nationwide survey published in 1993 by [[David Eisenberg]], which revealed that in 1990 approximately 60 million Americans had used one or more complementary or alternative therapies to address health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eisenberg DM |year=1993|title=Unconventional Medicine in the United States – Prevalence, Costs, and Patterns of Use|journal= N Engl J Med|volume= 328|pages=246–252|doi=10.1056/NEJM199301283280406 | pmid=8418405 | author-separator = , | display-authors = 1 | last2 = Kessler | first2 = Ronald C. | last3 = Foster | first3 = Cindy | last4 = Norlock | first4 = Frances E. | last5 = Calkins | first5 = David R. | last6 = Delbanco | first6 = Thomas L. | issue = 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in the November 11, 1998 issue of the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] reported that 42% of Americans had used complementary and alternative therapies, up from 34% in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Eisenberg DM |year=1998|title= Trends in alternative medicine use in the United States, 1990–1997: results of a follow-up national survey |journal=JAMA|volume= 280 |issue=18|pages=1569–75|pmid=9820257 |doi=10.1001/jama.280.18.1569 | author-separator = , | author2 = Davis RB | author3 = Ettner SL | display-authors = 3 | last4 = Appel | first4 = S | last5 = Wilkey | first5 = S | last6 = Van Rompay | first6 = M | last7 = Kessler | first7 = RC}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the growth in patient demand for complementary medicine, most of the early alternative/complementary medical centers failed.&lt;ref name=bestpractices&gt;Best Practices in Integrative Medicine: A Report from the Bravewell Clinical Network. Published 2007. The Bravewell Collaborative. Page 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeal==

A study published in 1998&lt;ref name=&quot;Astin&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Astin JA |title=Why patients use alternative medicine: results of a national study |journal=JAMA |volume=279 |issue=19 |pages=1548–53 |year=1998 |month=May |pmid=9605899 |doi=10.1001/jama.279.19.1548}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicates that a majority of alternative medicine use was in conjunction with standard medical treatments. Approximately 4.4 percent of those studied used alternative medicine as a replacement for conventional medicine.  The research found that those having used alternative medicine tended to have higher education or report poorer health status.  Dissatisfaction with conventional medicine was not a meaningful factor in the choice, but rather the majority of alternative medicine users appear to be doing so largely because &quot;they find these healthcare alternatives to be more congruent with their own values, beliefs, and philosophical orientations toward health and life.&quot; In particular, subjects reported a holistic orientation to health, a transformational experience that changed their worldview, identification with a number of groups committed to environmentalism, feminism, psychology, and/or spirituality and personal growth, or that they were suffering from a variety of common and minor ailments – notable ones being anxiety, back problems, and chronic pain.

Authors have speculated on the socio-cultural and psychological reasons for the appeal of alternative medicines among that minority using them ''in lieu'' of conventional medicine.  There are several socio-cultural reasons for the interest in these treatments centered on the low level of [[scientific literacy]] among the public at large and a concomitant increase in [[antiscience|antiscientific]] attitudes and [[new age]] [[mysticism]].&lt;ref name=Beyerstein /&gt; Related to this are vigorous [[advertising|marketing]]&lt;ref name=Weber&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weber DO |title=Complementary and alternative medicine. Considering the alternatives |journal=Physician Executive |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=6–14 |year=1998 |pmid=10351720}}&lt;/ref&gt; of extravagant claims by the alternative medical community combined with inadequate media scrutiny and attacks on critics.&lt;ref name=Beyerstein&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beyerstein BL|url=http://www.sram.org/0302/bias.html|title=Psychology and 'Alternative Medicine' Social and Judgmental Biases That Make Inert Treatments Seem to Work|journal=The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine|year=1999|volume=3|issue=2|accessdate=2008-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beyerstein2&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beyerstein BL |title=Alternative medicine and common errors of reasoning |journal=Academic Medicine |volume=76 |issue=3 |pages=230–7 |year=2001 |month=March |pmid=11242572 |doi=10.1097/00001888-200103000-00009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also an increase in [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] toward conventional medicine and pharmaceutical companies, mistrust of traditional authority figures, such as the physician, and a dislike of the current delivery methods of scientific biomedicine, all of which have led patients to seek out alternative medicine to treat a variety of ailments.&lt;ref name=Beyerstein2/&gt; Many patients lack access to contemporary medicine, due to a lack of private or public [[health insurance]], which leads them to seek out lower-cost alternative medicine.&lt;ref name=pmid15188733/&gt; Medical doctors are also aggressively marketing alternative medicine to profit from this market.&lt;ref name=Weber/&gt;

In addition to the social-cultural underpinnings of the popularity of alternative medicine, there are several psychological issues that are critical to its growth. One of the most critical is the [[placebo effect]], which is a well-established observation in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=van Deventer MO |title=Meta-placebo: do doctors have to lie about giving a fake treatment? |journal=Medical Hypotheses |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=335–9 |year=2008 |month=September |pmid=18485613 |doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2008.03.040}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Related to it are similar psychological effects such as the will to believe,&lt;ref name=Beyerstein /&gt; [[cognitive bias]]es that help maintain self-esteem and promote harmonious social functioning,&lt;ref name=Beyerstein /&gt; and the ''[[post hoc, ergo propter hoc]]'' fallacy.&lt;ref name=Beyerstein /&gt;

Patients can also be averse to the painful, unpleasant, and sometimes-dangerous [[adverse effect|side effects]] of biomedical treatments. Treatments for severe diseases such as [[cancer]] and [[HIV]] infection have well-known, significant side-effects. Even low-risk medications such as [[antibiotics]] can have potential to cause life-threatening [[anaphylactic]] reactions in a very few individuals. Also, many medications may cause minor but bothersome symptoms such as cough or upset stomach.  In all of these cases, patients may be seeking out alternative treatments to avoid the adverse effects of conventional treatments.&lt;ref name=Beyerstein/&gt;&lt;ref name=Beyerstein2/&gt;

Schofield et al., in a systematic review published in 2011, make ten recommendations which they think may increase the effectiveness of consultations in a conventional (here: oncology) setting, such as &quot;Ask questions about CAM use at critical points in the illness trajectory&quot;; &quot;Respond to the person's emotional state&quot;; and &quot;Provide balanced, evidence-based advice&quot;. They suggest that this approach may address &quot;... concerns surrounding CAM use [and] encourage informed decision-making about CAM and ultimately, improve outcomes for patients&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid| 19783116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAM's popularity may be related to other factors which [[Edzard Ernst]] mentions in an interview in ''[[The Independent]]'':

: Why is it so popular, then? Ernst blames the providers, customers and the doctors whose neglect, he says, has created the opening into which alternative therapists have stepped. &quot;People are told lies. There are 40 million websites and 39.9 million tell lies, sometimes outrageous lies. They mislead cancer patients, who are encouraged not only to pay their last penny but to be treated with something that shortens their lives. &quot;At the same time, people are gullible. It needs gullibility for the industry to succeed. It doesn't make me popular with the public, but it's the truth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Con?&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/features/complementary-therapies-the-big-con-813248.html |title=Complementary therapies: The big con? – The Independent |work= |accessdate= 2010-04-23| location=London | date=2008-04-22 |deadurl=yes| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100417080412/http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/features/complementary-therapies-the-big-con-813248.html| archivedate= 17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper published in October 2010 entitled ''The public's enthusiasm for complementary and alternative medicine amounts to a critique of mainstream medicine'', Ernst describes these views in greater detail and concludes:

: [CAM] is popular. An analysis of the reasons why this is so points towards the therapeutic relationship as a key factor. Providers of CAM tend to build better therapeutic relationships than mainstream healthcare professionals. In turn, this implies that much of the popularity of CAM is a poignant criticism of the failure of mainstream healthcare. We should consider it seriously with a view of improving our service to patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pmid|  20846193}}&lt;/ref&gt;
