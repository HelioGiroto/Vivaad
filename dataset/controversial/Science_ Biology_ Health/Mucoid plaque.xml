      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11613">'''Mucoid plaque''' or '''mucoid rope''' is a term used by some [[alternative medicine]] advocates to describe a combination of allegedly harmful [[mucus|mucus-like]] material and food residue that they say coats the [[gastrointestinal tract]] of most people. The term was coined by Richard Anderson, a [[naturopathic physician|naturopath]] and [[entrepreneur]], who sells a range of products that claim to cleanse the body of such plaques by causing them to be eliminated.&lt;ref name=GeorgiaStraight&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straight.com/article/colon-cleanses-thrive-despite-scant-proof |title=Colon cleanses thrive despite scant proof | publisher = [[The Georgia Straight]] | accessdate=2008-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many such &quot;[[colon cleansing]]&quot; products are promoted to the public on websites that have been described as making misleading medical claims.&lt;ref name=Hochster/&gt; The presence of laxatives, clay, and fibrous thickening agents in some of these &quot;cleansing agents&quot; have led to suggestions that the products themselves produce the excreted product regarded as the plaque.&lt;ref name=Hochster/&gt;&lt;ref name=Schwarcz/&gt;

==History==

Various forms of colon cleansing were popular in the 19th and early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sullivan-Fowler M |title=Doubtful theories, drastic therapies: autointoxication and faddism in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries |journal=J Hist Med Allied Sci |volume=50 |issue=3 |pages=364–90 |year=1995 |month=July |pmid=7665877 |url=http://jhmas.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/50/3/364 |doi=10.1093/jhmas/50.3.364}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1932, Bastedo wrote in the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] about his observation of mucus masses being removed by a colon irrigation procedure: &quot;When one sees the dirty gray, brown or blackish sheets, strings and rolled up wormlike masses of tough mucus with a rotten or dead-fish odor that are obtained by colon irrigations, one does not wonder that these patients feel ill and that they obtain relief and show improvement as the result of the irrigation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Bastedo WA | title = Colonic irrigations: their administration, therapeutic application and dangers | publisher = JAMA | year = 1932 | volume = 98 | pages = 736}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While colonic irrigation enjoyed a vogue in the early 20th century as a possible cure for numerous diseases, subsequent research showed that it was useless and potentially harmful.&lt;ref name=Ernst&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ernst E |title=Colonic irrigation and the theory of auto-intoxication: a triumph of ignorance over science |journal=Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology |volume=24 |issue=4 |pages=196–8 |year=1997 |month=June |pmid=9252839 |doi=10.1097/00004836-199706000-00002|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9252839?dopt=Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the scientific rationale for &quot;colon cleansing&quot; disproven, the idea fell into disrepute as a form of [[quackery]], with a recent medical review stating that &quot;there is no evidence to support this ill-conceived theory that has been long abandoned by the scientific community.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Müller-Lissner SA, Kamm MA, Scarpignato C, Wald A |title=Myths and misconceptions about chronic constipation |journal=Am. J. Gastroenterol. |volume=100 |issue=1 |pages=232–42 |year=2005 |month=January |pmid=15654804 |doi=10.1111/j.1572-0241.2005.40885.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in response to claims that colon cleansing removes &quot;toxins&quot; Bennett Roth, a gastroenterologist at the [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California]] stated &quot;There is absolutely no science to this whatsoever. There is no such thing as getting rid of quote-unquote 'toxins.' The colon was made to carry stool. This is total baloney.&quot;&lt;ref name=Foreman/&gt; The preoccupation with such bowel management products has been described as a &quot;quaint and amusing chapter in the history of weird medical beliefs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Denise | last = Grady | url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E2DA1E3AF930A15756C0A9669C8B63&amp;sec=health&amp;spon=&amp;partner=permalink&amp;exprod=permalink | title = Cult of the Colon: From Little Liver Pills to Big Obsessions | work = [[New York Times]] | date=  May 23, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, interest in colonic &quot;autointoxication&quot; as a cause of illness, and in colonic irrigation as a cure, enjoyed a revival in [[alternative medicine]] at the end of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=Ernst/&gt;

The term &quot;mucoid plaque&quot; was coined and popularized by [[naturopath]] Richard Anderson.&lt;ref name=Schwarcz&gt;Joe Schwarcz [http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/columnists/story.html?id=437cc94f-2b5f-4327-abf8-762f63e6067a &quot;I have a gut feeling something's wrong here.&quot;] ''The Gazette'' Saturday, April 05 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AndersonBooks&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Anderson | first = Richard |title = Cleanse &amp; Purify Thyself, Books One and Two | publisher = Christobe Publishing |year = 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Anderson acknowledges that a similar concept has been described previously by practitioners of alternative medicine. Victor Earl Irons and [[Bernard Jensen]] used the terms &quot;toxic mucous lining&quot; or &quot;toxic mucous layer&quot; in their books. Robert Gray referred to &quot;mucoid matter&quot; in his 1990 book on colon health.

==Statements by Anderson==
Anderson describes a mucoid plaque as a rubbery, ropey, generally green [[gel]]-like mucus film that covers the [[epithelial cell]]s of the [[Lumen (anatomy)|hollow organs]], particularly of the [[alimentary canal]].  Anderson also claims the plaque can impair digestion and the absorption of nutrients, hold [[pathogen]]s, and cause illnesses such as [[diarrhea]], [[bowel cancer]], [[allergies]] and skin conditions.  Based on these claims, he promotes efforts to remove the plaque, and sells a range of products to this end.&lt;ref name=&quot;AndersonBooks&quot;/&gt; 

Though Anderson states his beliefs are backed by scientific research, his claims are primarily supported by [[anecdotal evidence]] rather than [[empirical data]]&lt;ref name=&quot;colonsource/skeptics&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.colonsource.com/skeptics.html |title=Some Skeptical Perspectives on Colon Cleansing |accessdate=2008-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; and doctors have failed to note the existence of mucoid plaques.  Anderson claims this is due to medical textbooks failing to cover the concept and therefore doctors not knowing what to look for.&lt;ref name=GeorgiaStraight/&gt;

==Medical evaluation==
Practicing [[physician]]s have dismissed the concept of mucoid plaque as a [[hoax]] and a &quot;non-credible concept&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;bjmu&quot;/&gt; A pathologist at the [[University of Texas]] School of Medicine addressed Anderson's claims directly, saying that he has &quot;seen several thousand intestinal biopsies and have never seen any 'mucoid plaque.' This is a complete fabrication with no anatomic basis.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GeorgiaStraight&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uthman&quot;/&gt; Another pathologist, Edward Friedlander, has noted during his experience that he has never observed anything resembling a &quot;toxic bowel settlement&quot; and that some online photographs actually depict what he recognises as a [[Melena|blood clot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;friedlander&quot;/&gt; Commenting on claims that waste material can adhere to the colon, Douglas Pleskow, a gastroenterologist at [[Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center]], stated &quot;That is the urban legend. In reality, most people clear their GI tract within three days.&quot;&lt;ref name=Foreman&gt;{{cite news | first = Judy | last = Foreman | url = http://www.latimes.com/features/health/medicine/la-he-toxic30-2008jun30,0,4875078.column | title = Beware of colon cleansing claims | work = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = June 30, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In a review of websites promoting products that claim to remove 'mucoid rope' or plaque from consumers' intestines, Howard Hochster of [[New York University]] wrote that these websites are &quot;abundant, quasi-scientific, and unfortunately convincing to a biologically uneducated public.&quot; He noted that although such sites are entertaining, they are disturbing in that they promote a belief that has no basis in physiology.&lt;ref name=Hochster&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hochster H. |title=&quot;Colon Health&quot; Websites |journal=Current Colorectal Cancer Reports |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=105–106 |year=2007 |doi=10.1007/s11888-006-0027-6 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/ek65mh78p0k25595/fulltext.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hochster also noted that a preparation marketed to remove mucoid plaque contains laxatives and bulky fibrous ingredients. Thus, the ropy residue expelled from people who consume this product &quot;certainly is a result of the figs and senna in this preparation,&quot; rather than any sort of pathologic 'plaque'.&lt;ref name=Hochster/&gt; Other 'colon cleanser' products contain [[bentonite clay]] that, when ingested, would also result in production of bulky stools.&lt;ref name=Schwarcz/&gt;
