'''Veganism''' ([[WP:IPA for English|{{IPA|/ˈviːgənɪzəm/}}]]) is the practice of abstaining from the use of [[animal product]]s, particularly in diet, as well as an associated philosophy that rejects the commodity status of [[sentiocentrism|sentient]] animals. A follower of veganism is known as a '''vegan'''.

Distinctions are sometimes made between different types of vegans and veganism. A '''dietary vegan''' (or strict [[Vegetarianism|vegetarian]]) is one who abstains from including animal products (not only meat and fish, but also dairy products, eggs and often [[honey]], as well as other animal-derived substances) from his/her diet. The term '''ethical vegan''' or '''lifestyle vegan''' is often applied to someone who not only follows a vegan diet, but extends the vegan philosophy into other areas of their life. Another term used is [[environmental vegetarianism|environmental veganism]], which refers to the rejection of animal products on the premise that industrial farming of animals is environmentally damaging and [[sustainability|unsustainable]].&lt;ref name=ethicaldietary&gt;For the ethical/dietary distinction, see for example:
*[http://books.google.com/books?id=aQgAAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA50 &quot;Veganism&quot;], ''[[Vegetarian Times]]'', January 1989: &quot;Webster's dictionary provides a most dry and limiting definition of the word 'vegan': 'one that consumes no animal food or dairy products.' This description explains dietary veganism, but so-called ethical vegans—and they are the majority—carry the philosophy further.&quot;
*[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/05/health/main7216497.shtml &quot;Vegan Diets Become More Popular, More Mainstream&quot;], Associated Press/CBS News, January 5, 2011: &quot;Veganism is essentially hard-core vegetarianism ... vegans shun all animal products ... Ethical vegans have a moral aversion to harming animals for human consumption ... though the term often is used to describe people who follow the diet, not the larger philosophy.&quot;
*Gary Francione in [[Gary Francione|Francione, Gary L.]] and [[Robert Garner|Garner, Robert]]. ''The Animal Rights Debate: Abolition Or Regulation?'' Columbia University Press, 2010, [http://books.google.com/books?id=BwK-ZrHeapoC&amp;pg=PA62 p. 62]: &quot;Although veganism may represent a matter of diet or lifestyle for some, ethical veganism is a profound moral and political commitment to abolition on the individual level and extends not only to matters of food but also to the wearing or using of animal products. Ethical veganism is the personal rejection of the commodity status of nonhuman animals ...&quot;
*Margaret Puskar-Pasewicz. ''Cultural Encyclopedia of Vegetarianism''. ABC-Clio, 2010, [http://books.google.com/books?id=scpwmjE3TWYC&amp;pg=PA242 p. 242]: &quot;Vegans are divided into two sub-categories: lifestyle vegans and dietary vegans. Lifestyle vegans eschew all animal products in their diet and life ... Dietary vegans exclude animal products only from their diet.&quot;
*For &quot;environmental veganism,&quot; see Torres, Bob and Torres, Jenna. ''Vegan Freak: Being Vegan in a Non-Vegan World''. PM Press, 2009, pp. 100–102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''vegan'' was coined in England in 1944 by [[Donald Watson]], co-founder of the British [[Vegan Society]], to mean &quot;non-dairy vegetarian&quot;; the society also opposed the consumption of eggs. In 1951, the society extended the definition of ''veganism'' to mean &quot;the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals,&quot; and in 1960 [[H. Jay Dinshah]] started the [[American Vegan Society]], linking veganism to the [[Jainism|Jain]] concept of [[ahimsa]], the avoidance of violence against living things.&lt;ref name=Berry&gt;Berry, Rynn. &quot;Veganism,&quot; ''The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink''. Oxford University Press, 2007, [http://books.google.com/books?id=AoWlCmNDA3QC&amp;pg=PA604 pp. 604–605].
* For the origins of the term &quot;vegan,&quot; see [http://www.vegparadise.com/24carrot610.html &quot;Interview with Donald Watson&quot;], ''Vegetarians in Paradise'', August 11, 2004: &quot;I invited my early readers to suggest a more concise word to replace &quot;non-dairy vegetarian.&quot; Some bizarre suggestions were made like &quot;dairyban, vitan, benevore, sanivore, beaumangeur&quot;, et cetera. I settled for my own word, &quot;vegan&quot;, containing the first three and last two letters of &quot;vegetarian&quot;—&quot;the beginning and end of vegetarian.&quot; The word was accepted by the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' and no one has tried to improve it.&quot;
*Watson, Donald. [http://ukveggie.com/vegan_news/vegan_news_1.pdf ''Vegan News''], No. 1, November 1944: &quot;We should all consider carefully what our Group, and our magazine, and ourselves, shall be called. 'Non-dairy' has become established as a generally understood colloquialism, but like 'non-lacto' it is too negative. Moreover, it does not imply that we are opposed to the use of eggs as food.&quot;
* For the Vegan Society extending its definition of &quot;veganism&quot; in 1951, see Cross, Leslie. [http://www.ivu.org/history/world-forum/1951vegan.html &quot;Veganism Defined&quot;], ''The Vegetarian World Forum'', volume 5, issue 1, Spring 1951.&lt;/ref&gt;

Veganism is a small but growing movement. In many countries the number of vegan restaurants is increasing, and some of the top athletes in certain endurance sports—for instance, the [[Ironman triathlon]] and the [[ultramarathon]]—practise veganism, including [[raw veganism]].&lt;ref&gt;Berry, Rynn. &quot;Veganism,&quot; ''The Oxford Companion to American Food and Drink''. Oxford University Press, 2007, [http://books.google.com/books?id=AoWlCmNDA3QC&amp;pg=PA604 pp. 604–605]:
* &quot;Despite the seeming hardships a vegan diet imposes on its practitioners, veganism is a burgeoning movement, especially among younger Americans. In the endurance sports, such as the Ironman triathlon and the Utramarathon, the top competitors are vegans who consume much of their vegan food in its uncooked state. Even young weight lifters and body builders are gravitating to a vegan diet, giving the lie to the notion that eating animal flesh is essential for strength and stamina. [[Brendan Brazier]], a young athlete who regularly places in the top three in international triathlon events and who formulated Vega, a line of plant-based performance products, said of his fellow vegan athletes: &quot;We're beginning to build a strong presence in every sport.&quot;

Vegetarianism is defined by the [[International Vegetarian Union]] (IVU) as &quot;a diet of foods derived from plants, with or without eggs, dairy products, and/or honey&quot;; the British [[Vegetarian Society]] adds that vegetarians avoid the &quot;by-products of slaughter.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ivu.org/about.html &quot;About IVU&quot;], International Vegetarian Union, accessed September 6, 2012.
*[http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=698 &quot;What is a vegetarian?&quot;], Vegetarian Society, accessed September 6, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The word &quot;vegetarian&quot; seems to have come into use in the early 19th century to refer to those who avoided meat; those who also avoided fish, eggs and dairy products were known as strict or total vegetarians.&lt;ref&gt;For a 19th-century reference to this division, see [http://books.google.com/books?id=gwQFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA237#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false &quot;Under Examination&quot;], ''The Dietetic Reformer and Vegetarian Messenger'', Vol XI, 1884, p. 237: &quot;There are two kinds of Vegetarians—an extreme sect, who eat no animal food whatever; and a less extreme sect, who do not object to eggs, milk, or fish ... The Vegetarian Society ... belongs to the more moderate division.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Oxford English Dictionary'' attributes the earliest use of the word to the English actress [[Fanny Kemble]] (1809–1893) writing in Georgia in the United States in 1839.&lt;ref&gt;Kemble, Fanny. [http://books.google.com/books?id=WaFiAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA197 ''Journal of a Residence on a Georgian Plantation in 1838-1839''], Harper and Brothers, New York, 1839, pp. 197–198: &quot;The sight and smell of raw meat are especially odious to me, and I have often thought that if I had had to be my own cook, I should inevitably become a vegetarian, probably, indeed, return entirely to my green and salad days.&quot;

In 1834 [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], the American [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] and strict vegetarian (father of [[Louisa May Alcott]]), opened the [[Temple School, Boston (1830s)|Temple School]] in Boston to promote his ideas, and in 1838 [[James Pierrepont Greaves]] opened [[Alcott House]] in Surrey, England, a cooperative community and boarding school that followed a strict-vegetarian diet.&lt;ref&gt;Iacobbo, Karen and Iacobbo, Michael.

Members of Alcott House – along with the [[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism|ovo-lacto vegetarian]] [[Bible Christian Church (vegetarian)|Bible Christian Church]] and readers of the ''Truth-Tester'' temperance journal – were involved in 1847 in forming the British Vegetarian Society. The Society held its first meeting, chaired by Salford MP [[Joseph Brotherton]] (1783–1857), in September that year at Northwood Villa in Ramsgate.&lt;ref name=&quot;ivuvs&quot;&gt;Davis, John.

===Early 20th century===
[[File:MKGandhi.jpg|thumb|140px|[[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s call to vegetarians in 1931 to focus on morality was a precursor to the ideas of the [[Vegan Society]] in 1944.&lt;ref name=Phelps/&gt;]]
The first known vegan cookbook, ''No Animal Food'' by Rupert H. Wheldon, was published in England by C.W. Daniel in 1910.&lt;ref name=Leneman&gt;Leneman, Leah. [http://ethik.univie.ac.at/fileadmin/user_upload/inst_ethik_wiss_dialog/Leneman__L._1999._No_Animal_Food__The_Road_to_Veganism_in_Britain__1909-1944..pdf &quot;No Animal Food: The Road to Veganism in Britain, 1909–1944&quot;],''Society and Animals'', 7, 1–5, 1999.
*In the book, Wheldon argued that, &quot;it is obvious that, since we should live as to give the greatest possible happiness to all beings capable of appreciating it and as it is an indisputable fact that animals can suffer pain, ''and that men who slaughter animals needlessly suffer from atrophy of all finer feelings'', we should therefore cause no unnecessary suffering in the animal world.&quot; See Wheldon, Rupert. [http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/22829 ''No Animal Food''], Health Culture Co, New York-Passaic, New Jersey, 1910, pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; Leah Leneman writes that in 1912 the editor of ''TVMHR'', the journal of the Vegetarian Society's Manchester branch, started a debate among readers as to whether vegetarians ought to avoid eggs and dairy. He summarized the views of the 24 vegetarians who responded, writing: &quot;The defence of the use of eggs and milk by vegetarians, so far as it has been offered here, is not satisfactory. The only true way is to live on cereals, pulse, fruit, nuts and vegetables.&quot; The journal wrote in 1923 that the &quot;ideal position for vegetarians is abstinence from animal products,&quot; and that most of the society's members were in a transitional stage. In 1935 it wrote that the issue was becoming more pressing with every year.&lt;ref name=Leneman/&gt;

In 1931 [[Mahatma Gandhi]] (1869–1948) addressed a meeting in London of the Vegetarian Society—attended by Henry Salt—arguing that it ought to promote a meat-free diet as a moral issue, not as an issue of human health. [[Norm Phelps]] writes that this was a rebuke to members of the Society who had focused on the health benefits of vegetarianism. Gandhi argued that &quot;vegetarians had a habit of talking of nothing but food and nothing but disease. I feel that this is the worst way of going about the business. ... I discovered that for remaining staunch to vegetarianism a man requires a moral basis.&quot; He became friends with other leading vegetarian campaigners, including Salt and the English physician [[Anna Kingsford]] (1846–1888), author of ''The Perfect Way in Diet'' (1881).&lt;ref name=Phelps/&gt;  Although Gandhi continued to drink cow's milk—calling it the tragedy of his life that he could not give it up—Phelps argues that his speech was a call for the Society to align itself with Salt's views on animal rights, and a precursor to the ideas of Donald Watson in 1944.&lt;ref name=Phelps&gt;Phelps, Norm. ''The Longest Struggle: Animal Advocacy from Pythagoras to PETA''. Lantern Books, 2007, pp. 163–165.

===1944: Coining the term &quot;vegan&quot;===
{{further|History of veganism}}

[[File:VeganSociety.jpg|thumb|200px|Logo of the British [[Vegan Society]]]]
In July 1943 Leslie Cross, a member of the Leicester Vegetarian Society, expressed concern in its newsletter, ''The Vegetarian Messenger'', that vegetarians were still eating dairy products. A year later, in August 1944, two of the society's members, [[Donald Watson]] (1910–2005) and Elsie &quot;Sally&quot; Shrigley (died 1978), suggested forming a subgroup of non-dairy vegetarians. When the executive committee rejected the idea, they and five others met at the Attic Club in Holborn, London, on November 1 to discuss setting up a separate organization, which they decided to call the [[Vegan Society]].&lt;ref name=Stepaniak1&gt;Stepaniak, Joanne. ''The Vegan Sourcebook''. Lowell House, 2000, pp. 1–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other suggestions for a concise term to replace &quot;non-dairy vegetarian&quot; included dairyban, vitan, benevore, sanivore, and beaumangeur, but Watson decided on &quot;vegan&quot; – pronounced &quot;veegun&quot; ({{IPA|/ˈviːɡən/}}), with the stress on the first syllable – the first three and last two letters of vegetarian and, as Watson put it in 2004, &quot;the beginning and end of vegetarian.&quot;&lt;ref name=veganword&gt;For details of how &quot;vegan&quot; was chosen, see [http://www.vegparadise.com/24carrot610.html &quot;Interview with Donald Watson&quot;], ''Vegetarians in Paradise'', August 11, 2004, accessed May 5, 2011.

Lowell House, 2000, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951 the British Vegan Society broadened its definition of veganism to &quot;the doctrine that man should live without exploiting animals.&quot; Leslie Cross, the society's vice-president wrote that veganism is a principle, that it is &quot;not so much about welfare [of animals] as liberation.&quot; The society pledged to &quot;seek to end the use of animals by man for food, commodities, work, hunting, vivisection and all other uses involving exploitation of animal life by man.&quot; Members were expected to declare themselves in agreement and to live as closely to the ideal as they could.&lt;ref name=Cross1951&gt;Cross, Leslie. [http://www.ivu.org/history/world-forum/1951vegan.html &quot;Veganism Defined&quot;], ''The Vegetarian World Forum'', volume 5, issue 1, Spring 1951: &quot;In a vegan world the creatures would be reintegrated within the balance and sanity of nature ''as she is in herself''. A great and historic wrong, whose effect upon the course of evolution must have been stupendous, would be righted. The idea that his fellow creatures might be used by man for self-interested purposes would be so alien to human thought as to be almost unthinkable. In this light, veganism is not so much welfare as liberation, for the creatures and for the mind and heart of man; not so much an effort to snake the present relationship bearable, as an uncompromising recognition that because it is in the main one of master and slave, it has to be abolished before something better and finer can be built.&quot;
*The Vegan Society wrote in 1979 that the word &quot;veganism&quot; &quot;denotes a philosophy and way of living which seeks to exclude—as far as is possible and practical—all forms of exploitation of, and cruelty to, animals for food, clothing or any other purpose; and by extension, promotes the development and use of animal-free alternatives ...&quot; See [http://www.vegansociety.com/pdf/ArticlesofAssociation.pdf &quot;Memorandum of Association of the Vegan Society&quot;], Vegan Society, November 20, 1979, accessed February 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1957, [[H. Jay Dinshah]] (1933–2000), the son of a [[Parsi]] from Mumbai, visited a slaughterhouse and read some of Watson's literature. He decided to give up all animal products, and, on February 8, 1960, he founded the [[American Vegan Society]] (AVS) in Malaga, New Jersey, incorporating Nimmo's society, and explicitly linking veganism to the concept of ''ahimsa'', a Sanskrit word meaning &quot;non-harming.&quot; The AVS called it &quot;dynamic harmlessness,&quot; and to stress the connection with veganism named its magazine ''Ahimsa''.&lt;ref&gt;Stepaniak, Joanne.

==Overview==

===Avoidance of animal products===
{{further|Animal product|Rendering (food processing)}}
[[File:Homelard.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Lard from pigs]]
Ethical vegans entirely reject the commodification of animals. The Vegan Society in the UK will only certify a product as vegan if it is free of animal involvement as far as possible and practical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vegansociety.com/Lifestyle-And-Nutrition/Food/Criteria-for-Vegan-Food.aspx &quot;Criteria for Vegan food&quot;], Vegan Society, accessed November 28, 2009.
*Also see [http://www.americanvegan.org/vegan.htm &quot;What is Vegan?&quot;], American Vegan Society, accessed February 1, 2011: &quot;Vegans exclude flesh, fish, fowl, dairy products (animal milk, butter, cheese, yogurt, etc.), eggs, honey, animal gelatin, and all other foods of animal origin. Veganism also excludes animal products such as leather, wool, fur, and silk in clothing, upholstery, etc. Vegans usually make efforts to avoid the less-than-obvious animal oils, secretions, etc., in many products such as soaps, cosmetics, toiletries, household goods and other common commodities.&quot;
*[http://www.vegansociety.com/User-Hubpages/Businesses/Trademark/Trademark-Standards.aspx &quot;Trademark Standards&quot;], Vegan Society, accessed January 3, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

An animal product is any material derived from animals, including meat, poultry, seafood, [[egg (food)|eggs]], [[dairy product]]s, [[honey]], [[fur]], [[leather]], [[wool]], and [[silk]]. Other commonly used, but perhaps less well known, animal products are [[beeswax]], [[bone char]], [[bone china]], [[carmine]], [[casein]], [[cochineal]], [[gelatin]], [[isinglass]], [[lanolin]], [[lard]], [[rennet]], [[shellac]], [[tallow]], [[whey]], and [[yellow grease]]. Many of these may not be identified in the list of ingredients in the finished product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veganoutreach.org/starterpack/qa.html#isrefinedsugarvegan &quot;Vegan FAQs&quot;], Vegan Outreach, accessed March 11, 2007.
*[http://www.veganpeace.com/ingredients/ingredients.htm &quot;Animal ingredients and products&quot;], Vegan Peace, accessed February 3, 2011.
*Also see Meeker D.L. (ed). ''Essential Rendering: All About The Animal By-Products Industry'''. National Renderers Association, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The detailed reasons vegans may not use a specific animal product are varied. In the case of wool for example, [[Merino]] sheep have been bred to have unusually wrinkly skin, which can lead to heat exhaustion in summer and the practice of [[mulesing]] to counter [[Myiasis|flystrike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Beauty without the Beasts|author=Heather Chase |year=2001 |pages=75–76 |url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=RtFCpJQ7tLcC&amp;pg=PA75&amp;lpg=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethical vegans will not use animal products for clothing, toiletries, or any other reason, and will try to avoid ingredients that have been [[Animal testing|tested on animals]]. They will not buy fur coats, leather shoes, belts, bags, wallets, woollen jumpers, silk scarves, camera film, and certain vaccines, etc. Depending on their economic circumstances, they may donate such items to charity when they become vegan, or use them until they wear out. Clothing made without animal products is widely available in stores and online. Alternatives to wool include cotton, hemp, rayon, and polyester. Some vegan clothes, in particular shoes, are made of petroleum-based products, which has triggered criticism because of the environmental damage associated with production.&lt;ref&gt;Stepaniak, Joanne. [http://books.google.com/books?id=6Ia5eZIlgLUC&amp;pg=PA116 ''The Vegan Sourcebook'']. Lowell House, 2000, pp. 20, 115–118, 154; see p. 116 for the environmental damage associated with petroleum-based products.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Milk and eggs====
One of the main differences between a vegan and a [[Ovo-lacto vegetarianism|typical vegetarian diet]] is the avoidance of both eggs and dairy products such as milk, cheese, butter and yogurt. Ethical vegans do not consume dairy or eggs because they state that their production causes the animal suffering and/or a premature death.&lt;ref name=marcus&gt;{{cite book|title=Vegan: The New Ethics of Eating|author=Erik Marcus|year=2000|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=3hHjqs43t8oC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To produce milk from [[dairy cattle]] all female calves are separated from their mothers soon after birth and fed milk replacer in order to retain the cows milk for human consumption.&lt;ref name=milk&gt;{{cite web|title=Dairy Cows &amp; Welfare |author=Vegetarian Society|date=|url=http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=556}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vegans state that this breaks the natural mother and calf bond.&lt;ref name=milk /&gt; Unwanted male calves are either slaughtered at birth or sent for [[veal]] production.&lt;ref name=milk /&gt; To prolong [[lactation]], dairy cows are almost permanently kept pregnant through [[artificial insemination]].&lt;ref name=milk /&gt; After about five years, once the cows milk production has dropped, they are considered &quot;spent&quot; and sent to slaughter for hamburger meat and their hides. A dairy cow's natural life expectancy is about twenty years.&lt;ref name=marcus1&gt;{{cite book|title=Vegan: The New Ethics of Eating|author=Erik Marcus|year=2000|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ONYfgAGyvPQC&amp;pg=PA128&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|pages=128-129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[battery cage]] and [[free-range eggs|free-range egg]] production, unwanted male [[Chick culling|chicks are culled]] or discarded at birth during the process of securing a further generation of egg-laying hens.&lt;ref name=egg&gt;{{cite web|title=Egg Production &amp; Welfare |author=Vegetarian Society|date=|url=http://www.vegsoc.org/page.aspx?pid=587#}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Honey====
Vegans may view the consumption of honey as cruel and exploitative with modern [[beekeeping]] a form of enslavement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Great Vegan Honey Debate: Is honey the dairy of the insect world? |author=Daniel Engber|date=July 30, 2008|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/life/food/2008/07/the_great_vegan_honey_debate.html|newspaper=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the honey is harvested, it is common practice to substitute the bees natural food store (i.e. honey) with sugar or [[corn syrup]] in order to maintain the colony over winter. There is disagreement amongst groups about the extent to which all animal products, particularly products from insects such as honey, must be avoided. Neither the Vegan Society nor the American Vegan Society considers the use of honey, silk, or other insect products to be suitable for vegans, whilst Vegan Action and Vegan Outreach regard that as a matter of personal choice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vegansociety.com/uploadedFiles/User_Hubpages/Education/Education_Resources/Honey.pdf &quot;Honey: Ain't so sweet for the bees&quot;], Vegan Society, accessed February 3, 2011.

Any plant-based dish may be vegan. Common vegan dishes prepared without animal ingredients include [[ratatouille]], [[falafel]], [[hummus]], veggie [[burrito]]s, [[rice and beans]], veggie stir-fry, and [[pasta primavera]]. Ingredients such as [[tofu]], [[tempeh]], and [[seitan]] are widely used in vegan cuisine. [[Plant cream]] and [[plant milk]]—such as [[almond milk]], [[grain milk]], or [[soy milk]]—are used instead of cows' or goats' milk. Vegan recipes will use apple sauce, ground flax seeds, mashed potatoes, soft or silken tofu, or commercial starch-based egg-substitute products, instead of chickens' eggs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peta.org/living/vegetarian-living/egg-replacements.aspx &quot;Egg Replacements&quot;], People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, accessed August 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vegan food pyramid.svg|thumb|320px|alt=diagram|Vegan version of the nutritional [[Food guide pyramid|food pyramid]]]]
[[Meat analogue]]s, or &quot;mock meats,&quot; made of soy or [[gluten]]—including [[vegetarian sausage]], vegetarian mince, and [[veggie burger]]s—are widely available. Since, however, some meat-free vegetarian foods, including some vegetarian sausages, may include [[egg (food)|egg]]s or [[dairy products]], they would be part of an acceptable diet for vegetarians but not for vegans. [[Cheese analogue]]s made from soy, nuts, and tapioca are commonly used.  Vegan cheeses like Teese, Sheese, and [[Daiya]] can replace the taste and meltability of dairy cheese in various dishes.&lt;ref&gt;Barnouin, K. (2010).

The [[Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine]] recommends what they call the &quot;Four New Food Groups.&quot; They suggest that vegans and vegetarians eat at least three servings of vegetables a day, including dark-green, leafy vegetables such as broccoli, and dark-yellow and orange such as carrots; five servings of whole grains (bread, rice, pasta); three of fruit; and two of legumes (beans, peas, lentils).&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080716211315/http://www.vegsource.com/food_groups.htm &quot;Vegetarian starter kit&quot;], Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine, posted on ''vegsource.com'', accessed January 31, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Health arguments====
{{further|Vegan nutrition|Raw veganism}}
Winston Craig, chair of the department of nutrition at [[Andrews University]], writes that vegan diets tend to be higher in [[dietary fibre]], [[magnesium]], [[folic acid]], [[vitamin C]], [[vitamin E]], [[Human iron metabolism|iron]], and [[phytochemical]]s, and lower in [[calorie]]s, [[saturated fat]], [[cholesterol]], long-chain [[omega-3 fatty acids]], [[vitamin D]], [[calcium]], [[zinc]], and [[vitamin B12]].&lt;ref name=Craig/&gt;

According to the 2010 ''Dietary Guidelines for Americans,'' a report issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, a vegetarian diet is associated with lower levels of obesity and reduced risk of cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/publications/dietaryguidelines/2010/policydoc/execsumm.pdf &quot;Building healthy eating patterns&quot;], ''Dietary Guidelines for Americans'', United States Department of Agriculture, 2010, p. 45. The report said:&lt;p&gt;&quot;In prospective studies of adults, compared to non-vegetarian eating patterns, vegetarian-style eating patterns have been associated with improved health outcomes—lower levels of obesity, a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, and lower total mortality. Several clinical trials have documented that vegetarian eating patterns lower blood pressure.&lt;p&gt; On average, vegetarians consume a lower proportion of calories from fat (in particular, saturated fatty acids); fewer overall calories; and more fiber, potassium, and vitamin C than do non-vegetarians. In general, vegetarians have a lower body mass index. These characteristics and other lifestyle factors associated with a vegetarian diet may contribute to the positive health outcomes that have been identified among vegetarians.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada said in 2003 that properly planned vegan diets were nutritionally adequate for all stages of life, including pregnancy and lactation, and provided health benefits in the treatment and prevention of certain diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12826028 &quot;Position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada: vegetarian diets&quot;], ''Canadian Journal of Dietetic Practice and Research''.

The 12-year Oxford Vegetarian Study of 11,000 subjects recruited between 1980 and 1984 indicated that vegans had lower total- and LDL-cholesterol concentrations than did meat-eaters. Death rates were lower in non-meat eaters than in meat eaters; mortality from [[ischemic heart disease]] was positively associated with eating animal fat and with dietary cholesterol levels.&lt;ref name=Appleby&gt;Appleby P.N. et al. [http://www.ajcn.org/content/70/3/525S.full.pdf &quot;The Oxford Vegetarian Study: an overview&quot;], ''American Journal of Clinical Nutrition'', 1999, 70 (suppl):525S–531S.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada, diets that avoid meat tend to have lower levels of saturated fat, cholesterol, and animal protein, and higher levels of carbohydrates, fiber, magnesium, potassium, folate, and antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, and phytochemicals. People avoiding meat are reported to have lower [[body mass index]] than those following the average Canadian or American diet. From this follows lower death rates from ischemic heart disease, lower blood cholesterol levels, lower blood pressure, and lower rates of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and prostate and colon cancers.&lt;ref name=adajournal&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12826028 &quot;Position of the American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada: vegetarian diets&quot;], ''Canadian Journal of Dietetic Practice and Research''.

A 1999 meta-analysis of five studies comparing mortality rates in Western countries found that mortality from ischemic heart disease was 26 percent lower in vegans than in regular meat-eaters. This was compared to 20 percent lower in occasional meat eaters, 34 percent lower in [[pescetarian]]s (those who ate fish but no other meat), and 34 percent lower in ovo-lacto vegetarians (those who ate no meat, but did consume animal milk and eggs). The lower rate of protection for vegans compared to pescetarians or ovo-lacto vegetarians is believed to be linked to higher levels of [[homocysteine]], caused by insufficient vitamin B12; it is believed that vegans who consume sufficient B12 should show even lower risk of ischemic heart disease than lacto-ovo vegetarians. No significant difference in mortality was found from other causes.&lt;ref&gt;Key, T. ''et al''.

A large 15-year survey that investigated the association between diet and age-related cataract risk in the UK found that vegans had a 40 percent lower risk of developing cataract compared with the biggest meat eaters.&lt;ref&gt;Appleby P.N. ''et al''. [http://www.ajcn.org/content/93/5/1128.abstract &quot;Diet, vegetarianism, and cataract risk&quot;], American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, 2011 93(5):1128-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Dietetic Association indicated in 2003 that vegetarian diets may be more common among adolescents with eating disorders, but that the evidence suggests that the adoption of a vegetarian diet does not lead to eating disorders, rather that &quot;vegetarian diets may be selected to camouflage an existing eating disorder.&quot;&lt;ref name=adajournal/&gt; Other studies and statements by dietitians and counselors support this conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;Dedyna, Katherine.

However the eating pattern chosen by those with anorexia or bulimia nervosa is far more restrictive than a healthful vegan diet, eliminating nuts, seeds, nut butters, avocados, and limiting overall caloric intake.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vitamin B12====
{{further|Vitamin B12 deficiency}}
The Vegan Society and Vegan Outreach recommend that vegans eat foods fortified with B12, such as fortified soy milk or cereal, or take a supplement. B12 is a bacterial product that cannot be found reliably in plant foods, and is needed for the formation and maturation of red blood cells and the synthesis of DNA, and for normal nerve function; a deficiency can lead to a number of health problems, including [[megaloblastic anemia]].&lt;ref name=Mangels&gt;Mangels, Reed.

[http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/vitaminb12 &quot;Vitamin B12: Are you getting it?&quot;], Vegan Outreach, July 26, 2006, accessed February 4, 2011: &quot;B12 is generally found in all animal foods (except honey). Contrary to rumors, there are no reliable, unfortified plant sources of vitamin B12, including tempeh, seaweeds, and organic produce. The overwhelming consensus in the mainstream nutrition community, as well as among vegan health professionals, is that plant foods do not provide vitamin B12, and fortified foods or supplements are necessary for the optimal health of vegans, and even vegetarians in many cases. Luckily, vitamin B12 is made by bacterial fermentation such that it does not need to be obtained from animal products.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

====Protein====
Proteins are composed of [[amino acid]]s, and a common concern with protein acquired from vegetable sources is an adequate intake of the [[essential amino acid]]s, which cannot be synthesised by the human body. While dairy and egg products provide complete sources for [[ovo-lacto vegetarian]]s, the only vegetable sources with significant amounts of all eight types of essential amino acids are [[lupin beans]], [[soy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/legumes-and-legume-products/4375/2 | title = Soybeans, mature seeds, raw | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =August 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hempseed]], [[chia seed]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/nut-and-seed-products/3061/2 | title = Seeds, chia seeds, dried | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =August 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[amaranth grain|amaranth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/5676/2 | title = Amaranth, uncooked | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =August 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[buckwheat]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/5681/2 | title = Buckwheat | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =August 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[quinoa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nutritiondata.self.com/facts/cereal-grains-and-pasta/10352/2 | title = Quinoa, cooked | publisher = NutritionData.com | accessdate =August 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the essential amino acids can also be obtained by eating a variety of complementary plant sources that, in combination, provide all eight essential amino acids (e.g. [[brown rice]] and [[bean]]s, or [[hummus]] and whole wheat [[pita]], though [[protein combining]] in the same meal is not necessary). A 1994 study found a varied intake of such sources can be adequate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author=VR Young and PL Pellett| title=Plant proteins in relation to human protein and amino acid nutrition| journal=Am. J. Clinical Nutrition| year=1994| issue=5 Suppl| pages=1203S–1212S| pmid=8172124 | volume=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iodine====
{{further|Iodine deficiency}}
Iodine supplementation may be necessary for vegans in countries where salt is not typically [[Iodized salt|iodized]], where it is iodized at low levels, or where, as in Britain or Ireland, dairy products are relied upon for iodine delivery because of low levels in the soil.&lt;ref name=Appleby/&gt; Iodine can be obtained from most vegan multivitamins or from regular consumption of seaweeds, such as [[kelp]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/iodine &quot;Iodine&quot;], Vegan Outreach, December 26, 2006, accessed February 2, 2011: &quot;Iodine is needed for healthy thyroid function which regulates metabolism. Both too much and too little iodine can result in abnormal thyroid metabolism. ... Studies have shown that vegans in Europe (where salt is either not iodized or not iodized at high enough levels) who do not supplement (as well as those who oversupplement) have indications of abnormal thyroid function.&quot;

====Calcium====
[[File:Vegan patties with potatoes and salad.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Pumpkin seed]]-crusted [[lentil]] patties with roasted garlic mashed potatoes and salad.]]
Vegans are advised to eat three servings per day of a high-calcium food, such as fortified soy milk, almonds, and hazelnuts, and take a calcium supplement as necessary.&lt;ref name=adajournal/&gt; The [[European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition|EPIC-Oxford]] study suggested that vegans have an increased risk of bone fractures over meat eaters and vegetarians, likely because of lower dietary calcium intake, but that vegans consuming more than 525&amp;nbsp;mg/day have a risk of fractures similar to that of other groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=P Appleby |coauthors=A Roddam, N Allen and T Key |year=2007 |month=February |title=Comparative fracture risk in vegetarians and nonvegetarians in EPIC-Oxford |journal=European Journal of Clinical Nutrition | doi=10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602659 |url=http://www.nature.com/ejcn/journal/v61/n12/full/1602659a.html |format=fee required |accessdate=2007-02-25 | volume = 61 | pages = 1400–6 |issue=12 | pmid = 17299475 }}
*Also see [http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/bones &quot;Bones, Vitamin D, and Calcium&quot;], Vegan Outreach, January 9, 2007, accessed February 4, 2011: &quot;Based on research showing that vegans who consumed less than 525 mg per day of calcium had higher bone fracture rates than people who consumed more than 525 mg per day (14), vegans should make sure they get a minimum of 525 mg of calcium per day. It would be best to get 700 mg per day for adults, and at least 1,000 mg for people age 13 to 18 when bones are developing. This can most easily be satisfied for most vegans by eating high-calcium greens on a daily basis and drinking a nondairy milk that is fortified with calcium.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2009 study of bone density found the bone density of vegans was 94 percent that of omnivores, but deemed the difference clinically insignificant.&lt;ref&gt;Ho-Pham, L.T., et al.

====Vitamin D====
Vegan Outreach writes that light-skinned people can obtain adequate amounts of vitamin D by spending 10–15 minutes in sunlight each day; dark-skinned people 20 minutes; and the elderly 30 minutes. Otherwise, supplements of between 400 and 1,000 IU are recommended, because most vegan diets contain little or no vitamin D without supplements or fortified foods.&lt;ref&gt;Norris, Jack. [http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/bones &quot;Bones, Vitamin D, and Calcium&quot;], Vegan Outreach, accessed February 3, 2011: &quot;If you get exposed to the following amounts of midday sun (10 am to 2 pm), without sunscreen, on a day when sunburn is possible (i.e., not winter or cloudy), then you do not need any dietary vitamin D that day.&quot; On other days, take a supplement; see page for recommendations.

====Iron====
The iron status of meat-eaters and vegans appears to be similar, and body absorption processes may adjust to lower intakes over time by enhancing absorption efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Mangels, Reed; Messina, Virginia; and Messina, Mark. ''The Dietitian's Guide to Vegetarian Diets''. Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning, 2010, first published 2004, p. 138ff.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Molasses]] is a high-iron food source and many vegans take it in spoonfuls as an iron supplement.

====Omega-3 fatty acids====
To ensure adequate consumption of [[omega-3 fatty acid]]s, Vegan Outreach advises vegans to consume 0.5 g of [[alpha-linolenic acid]] daily by eating, for example, 1/4 teaspoon of [[flaxseed oil]], and to use oils containing low amounts of [[omega-6 fatty acid]]s, such as olive, canola, avocado, or peanut oil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.veganhealth.org/articles/omega3 &quot;Omega-3 Fatty Acid Recommendations for Vegetarians&quot;], Vegan Outreach, accessed February 4, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dietary, ethical, and environmental perspectives==

===Dietary veganism===
[[File:Save The World Awards 2009 show06 - Carl Lewis.jpg|right|thumb|160px|alt=photograph|The athlete [[Carl Lewis]] adopted a vegan diet in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, Jannequin and Lewis, Carl.

Dietary vegans eat an entirely plant-based diet—either for health reasons or out of concern for animal welfare—but may continue to use animal products for other purposes. [[Joanne Stepaniak]], author of ''Being Vegan'' (2000), argues that to place the qualifier &quot;dietary&quot; before &quot;vegan&quot; dilutes its meaning—like using the term &quot;secular Catholic&quot; for people who want to practise only some aspects of Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Stepaniak, Joanne. [http://books.google.com/books?id=EOYw_DNO3AsC&amp;pg=PA10 ''Being Vegan'']. McGraw-Hill Professional, 2000, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; She writes that people should not call themselves vegan simply because they have embraced the diet: &quot;Practising a vegan diet no more qualifies someone as vegan than eating kosher food qualifies someone as Jewish.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Stepaniak, Joanne and Messina, Virginia. [http://books.google.com/books?id=6Ia5eZIlgLUC&amp;pg=PA21 ''The Vegan Sourcebook'']. McGraw-Hill Professional, 2000, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Associated Press reported in January 2011 that the vegan diet is moving from marginal to mainstream in the United States, with vegan books such as ''[[Skinny Bitch]]'' (2005) becoming best sellers, and several celebrities exploring vegan diets. According to the AP, over half the 1,500 chefs polled in 2011 by the National Restaurant Association included vegan entrees, and chain restaurants are starting to mark vegan items on their menus.&lt;ref&gt;Moskowitz, Isa Chandra et al.

===Ethical veganism===

====Philosophy====
{{further|Animal rights philosophy|Ethics of eating meat}}
[[File:Carol J Adams with Snowball.jpg|thumb|190px|alt=photograph|Feminist writer [[Carol J. Adams]] calls animals the [[absent referent]].]]
Ethical vegans see veganism as a philosophy, lifestyle, and set of principles, not simply a diet. [[Bob Torres]], author of ''Vegan Freak'' (2005), writes that ethical veganism consists of &quot;living life consciously as an [[Speciesism|anti-speciesist]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=5A1dyppuhmUC&amp;pg=PA60 Torres 2010, p. 60].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carol J. Adams]], the vegan-feminist writer, has used the concept of the [[absent referent]] to describe what she calls a psycho-social detachment between the consumer and the consumed. She wrote in ''The Sexual Politics of Meat'' (1990), described by ''The New York Times'' as a bible of the vegan community:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Behind every meal of meat is an absence: the death of the animal whose place the meat takes. The 'absent referent' is that which separates the meat eater from the animal and the animal from the end product. The function of the absent referent is to keep our 'meat' separated from any idea that she or he was once an animal, to keep the 'moo' or 'cluck' or 'baa' away from the meat, to keep ''something'' from being seen as having been some''one''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Carol J. [http://books.google.com/books?id=AwrwRKNavtAC&amp;pg=PA14 ''The Sexual Politics of Meat'']. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000 (first pub. 1990), p. 14.

[[File:TomRegan2.jpg|thumb|left|120px|alt=photograph|Philosopher [[Tom Regan]] argues that animals are &quot;subjects-of-a-life.&quot;]]
The philosophical debate about the moral basis of veganism reflects a division of viewpoints within animal rights theory between a rights-based or [[Deontological ethics|deontological approach]] and a [[Animal rights#Utilitarian approach|utilitarian]]/[[consequentialist]] one. [[Tom Regan]], professor emeritus of philosophy at North Carolina State University, is a rights-theorist who argues that animals possess inherent value as &quot;subjects-of-a-life&quot;—because they have beliefs and desires, an emotional life, memory, and the ability to initiate action in pursuit of goals—and must therefore be viewed as ends in themselves, not as means to an end.&lt;ref&gt;Regan, Tom. [http://books.google.com/books?id=Y0tWjRmxFE4C&amp;pg=PA243 ''The Case for Animal Rights'']. University of California Press, 1983, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the right of subjects-of-a-life not to be harmed can be overridden only when outweighed by other valid moral principles, but that the reasons cited for eating animal products—pleasure, convenience, and the economic interests of farmers—are not weighty enough to override the animals' moral rights.&lt;ref&gt;Regan 1983, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Y0tWjRmxFE4C&amp;pg=PA333 pp. 333–334], [http://books.google.com/books?id=Y0tWjRmxFE4C&amp;pg=PA394 394].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gary L. Francione]], professor of law at Rutgers School of Law-Newark, is also a rights-theorist. He argues that &quot;all sentient beings should have at least one right—the right not to be treated as property,&quot; and that adopting veganism must be the unequivocal baseline for anyone who sees nonhuman animals as having intrinsic moral value. To fail to do so is like arguing for human rights while continuing to own human slaves, he writes. Francione sees no coherent difference between eating meat and eating dairy or eggs; animals used in the dairy and egg industries live longer, are treated worse, and end up in the same slaughterhouses. He is critical of consequentialist positions that admit of occasional exceptions to vegan principles.&lt;ref&gt;Francione, Gary and Garner, Robert. [http://books.google.com/books?id=BwK-ZrHeapoC&amp;pg=PA62 ''The Animal Rights Debate: Abolition or Regulation'']. Columbia University Press, 2010, p. 62ff.

[[Peter Singer]], professor of bioethics at Princeton University, approaches the issue from a utilitarian perspective. He argues that there is no moral or logical justification for refusing to count animal suffering as a consequence when making ethical decisions, and that [[sentience]] is &quot;the only defensible boundary of concern for the interests of others.&quot; He does not contend that killing animals is wrong in principle, but argues that from a consequentialist standpoint it should be rejected unless necessary for survival.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Peter. ''[[Practical Ethics]]''. Cambridge University Press, 1999, pp. 57–58, 62.&lt;/ref&gt; He therefore advocates both veganism and improved conditions for farm animals to reduce animal suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Clyne, Catherine.

====Debate about the &quot;Paris exemption&quot;====
[[File:Singer1.jpg|thumb|150px|left|alt=photograph|Philosopher [[Peter Singer]] writes that personal purity is not the issue.]]
Unlike Francione, Singer is not concerned about what he calls trivial infractions of vegan principles, arguing that personal purity is not the issue. He supports what is known as the &quot;Paris exemption&quot;: if you find yourself in a fine restaurant, allow yourself to eat what you want, and if you're in a strange place without access to vegan food, going vegetarian instead is acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Peter and Mason, Jim. ''The Way We Eat''. Rodale, 2006, pp. 282–283.
*The term &quot;Paris exemption&quot; was coined in 2004 by Daren Firestone, a Chicago law student, in Paulson, Amanda. [http://www.csmonitor.com/2004/1027/p15s02-lifo.html &quot;One woman's quest to enjoy her dinner without guilt&quot;], ''Christian Science Monitor'', October 27, 2004, p. 2
*For criticism of the Paris exemption—also known as the &quot;Paris exception&quot;—see, for example, Torres, Bob and Torres, Jenna. ''Vegan Freak: Being Vegan in a non-Vegan World''. PM Press 2010, p. 45ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer's support for the &quot;Paris exemption&quot; is part of a debate within the animal rights movement about the extent to which it ought to promote veganism without exception. The positions are reflected by the divide between the [[Animal protectionism|animal protectionist]] side (represented by Singer and [[PETA]]), according to which incremental change can achieve real reform, and the [[Abolitionism (animal rights)|abolitionist]] side (represented by Regan and Francione), according to which apparent welfare reform serves only to persuade the public that animal use is morally unproblematic. Singer said in 2006 that the movement should be more tolerant of people who choose to use animal products if they are careful about making sure the animals had a decent life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satyamag.com/oct06/singer.html &quot;Singer says&quot;], Satya, October 2006, accessed February 3, 2011; also available here [http://www.abolitionistapproach.com/animal-rights-debate/endnotes/24b.pdf].
*Also see [http://books.google.com/books?id=BwK-ZrHeapoC&amp;pg=PA71 Francione and Garner, 2010, pp. 71–72].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bruce Friedrich]] of PETA argued in the same year that a strict adherence to veganism can become an obsession. Veganism should not be dogma, he wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]e all know people whose reason for not going vegan is that they &quot;can't&quot; give up cheese or ice cream. ... Instead of encouraging them to stop eating all other animal products besides cheese or ice cream, we preach to them about the oppression of dairy cows. Then we go on about how we don’t eat sugar or a veggie burger because of the bun, even though a tiny bit of butter flavor in a bun contributes to significantly less suffering than any non-organic fruit or vegetable does or a plastic bottle or about 100 other things that most of us use. Our fanatical obsession with ingredients not only obscures the animals’ suffering—which was virtually non-existent for that tiny modicum of ingredient—but also nearly guarantees that those around us are not going to make any change at all. So, we’ve preserved our personal purity, but we’ve hurt animals—and that’s anti-vegan.&lt;ref&gt;Friedrich, Bruce. [http://web.archive.org/web/20080611232631/http://www.goveg.com/effectiveAdvocacy_personal.asp &quot;Personal Purity versus Effective Advocacy&quot;], Goveg.com, PETA, 2006, accessed February 3, 2011; also available here [http://www.abolitionistapproach.com/animal-rights-debate/endnotes/222.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Francione writes that this position is similar to arguing that, because human rights abuses can never be eliminated entirely, we should not safeguard human rights in situations we control. By failing to ask a server whether something contains animal products, in the interest of avoiding a fuss, he argues that we reinforce the idea that the moral rights of animals are a matter of convenience. He concludes from this that the PETA/Singer position fails even on its own consequentialist terms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=BwK-ZrHeapoC&amp;pg=PA72 Francione and Garner 2010, pp. 72–73].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental veganism===

====Resources and the environment====
{{further|Environmental vegetarianism}}
[[File:Gestcrate01.jpg|thumb|220px|alt=photograph|Female pigs in [[gestation crate]]s. Vegans see animal agriculture—in particular [[factory farming]]—as an infringement of the animals' rights and a threat to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, Mason, Jim and Singer, Peter. ''Animal Factories: What Agribusiness is Doing to the Family Farm, the Environment and Your Health''. Harmony Books, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
People who adopt veganism for environmental reasons often do so because it consumes fewer resources and causes less environmental damage. Organizations such as PETA point out that animal agriculture is linked to climate change, water pollution, land degradation, a decline in biodiversity, and that a commercially available animal-based diet uses more land, water, and energy than a strictly vegetarian one.&lt;ref&gt;For example, see [http://www.peta.org/MC/factsheet_display.asp?ID=103 &quot;Factory Farming: Mechanized Madness&quot;], People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, accessed February 1, 2011: &quot;Factory farms are harmful to the environment as well. Each day, factory farms produce billions of pounds of manure, which ends up in lakes, rivers, and drinking water. ... Of all the agricultural land in the U.S., 80 percent is used to raise animals for food and grow the grain to feed them—that’s almost half the total land mass of the lower 48 states. ... it takes more than 1,250 gallons of water to produce a pound of cow flesh, whereas it takes about 235 gallons of water to grow 1 pound of wheat.&quot;
*Also see Brown, L.R. [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12263473 &quot;World food resources and population: the narrowing margin&quot;], ''Population Bulletin'', vol 32, issue 3, 1981, pp. 1–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] released a report in November 2006 linking animal agriculture to environmental damage. The report, ''[[Livestock's Long Shadow]]'', concluded that the livestock sector (primarily cows, chickens, and pigs) was one of the two or three most significant contributors to the planet's most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. According to the report, it is responsible for at least 18 percent of the world's [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, as measured in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents. Livestock sources (including enteric fermentation and manure) account for about 3.1 percent of US anthropogenic GHG emissions expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents.&lt;ref&gt;EPA.  2011.  Inventory of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions and sinks:  1990-2009.  United States Environmental Protection Agency.  EPA 430-R-11-005.  459 pp.)&lt;/ref&gt;  This EPA estimate is based on methodologies agreed to by the Conference of Parties of the UNFCCC, with 100-year global warming potentials from the IPCC Second Assessment Report used in estimating GHG emissions as carbon dioxide equivalents. In June 2010, a report from [[United Nations Environment Programme]] declared that a global shift towards a vegan diet was needed to save the world from hunger, fuel shortages and climate change.&lt;ref&gt;Felicity Carus [http://www.guardian.co.uk/environment/2010/jun/02/un-report-meat-free-diet UN urges global move to meat and dairy-free diet], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2 June 2010

====Debate over animals killed in crop harvesting====
[[File:VeganRallyEvolve.jpg|thumb|alt=photograph|220px|Vegans at the Melbourne &quot;Walk against Warming,&quot; December 12, 2009, during the [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|Copenhagen Summit]] on climate change.]]
Steven Davis, a professor of [[animal science]] at Oregon State University, argued in 2001 that the least-harm principle does not require giving up all meat, because a plant-based diet would not kill fewer animals than one containing beef from grass-fed [[ruminants]]. Davis wrote that cultivating crops also kills animals, because when a tractor traverses a field, animals are accidentally destroyed. Based on a study finding that wood mouse populations dropped from 25 per hectare to five per hectare after harvest (attributed to migration and mortality), Davis estimated that 10 animals per hectare are killed from crop farming every year. If all {{convert|120000000|acre|km2}} of cropland in the continental United States were used for a vegan diet, then approximately 500 million animals would die each year. But, if half the cropland were converted to ruminant pastureland, he estimated that only 900,000 animals would die each year—assuming people switched from the eight billion poultry killed each year to beef, lamb, and dairy products.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, S.L. [http://www.letstalkfarmanimals.ca/2009/07/13/least-harm-principle-suggests-meat-dairy-diet/ &quot;The least harm principle suggests that humans should eat beef, lamb, dairy, not a vegan diet&quot;], ''Proceedings of the Third Congress of the European Society for Agricultural and Food Ethics'', 2001, pp. 449–450.
*Also see Corliss, Richard. [http://web.archive.org/web/20090303110312/http://www.time.com/time/covers/1101020715/story5.html &quot;Should you be a vegetarian?&quot;] ''Time'' magazine, July 2, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Davis's analysis was criticized in 2003 by Gaverick Matheny and Andy Lamey in the ''Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics''. Matheny argued that Davis had miscalculated the number of animal deaths based on land area rather than per consumer, and incorrectly equated &quot;the harm done to animals ... to the number of animals killed.&quot; Matheny argued that per-consumer, a vegan diet would kill fewer wild animals than a diet adhering to Davis's model, and that vegetarianism &quot;likely allows a greater number of animals with lives worth living to exist.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Matheny, Gaverick. [http://www.veganoutreach.org/enewsletter/matheny.html &quot;Least Harm: A Defense of Vegetarianism from Steven Davis's Omnivorous Proposal&quot;], ''Journal of Agricultural and Environmental Ethics'', vol 16, issue 5, 2003, pp. 505–511.&lt;/ref&gt; Lamey argued that Davis's calculation of harvesting-related deaths was flawed because based on two studies; one included deaths from [[predation]], which is &quot;morally unobjectionable&quot; for Regan, and the other examined production of a nonstandard crop, which Lamey argued has little relevance to deaths associated with typical crop production. Lamey also argued, like Matheny, that accidental deaths are ethically distinct from intentional ones, and that if Davis includes accidental animal deaths in the moral cost of veganism, he must also evaluate [claimed] increased human deaths associated with his proposed diet, which Lamey argued leaves &quot;Davis, rather than Regan, with the less plausible argument.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lamey, Andy. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1253172 &quot;Food Fight! Davis versus Regan on the Ethics of Eating Beef&quot;], ''Journal of Social Philosophy'', vol 38, issue 2, 2009, pp. 331–348.&lt;/ref&gt;
