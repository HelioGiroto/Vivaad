'''Aspartame''' ('''APM'''; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|æ|s|p|ər|t|eɪ|m}} or {{IPAc-en|ə|ˈ|s|p|ɑr|t|eɪ|m}}) is an artificial, non-[[saccharide]] [[sweeteners|sweetener]] used as a [[sugar substitute]] in some foods and beverages. In the European Union, it is codified as [[E number|E951]]. Aspartame is a [[methyl]] [[ester]] of the [[aspartic acid]]/[[phenylalanine]] [[dipeptide]].  It was first sold under the brand name [[NutraSweet]]; since 2009 it also has been sold under the brand name AminoSweet. It was first synthesized in 1965 and the patent expired in 1992.

The [[Aspartame controversy|safety of aspartame]] has been the subject of several political and medical controversies, [[congressional hearing]]s and Internet hoaxes&lt;ref name=Snopes1&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/medical/toxins/aspartame.asp Aspartame] on [[Snopes.com]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acsh.org/healthissues/newsID.265/healthissue_detail.asp ACSH Debunks Internet Health Hoax]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,990167,00.html A Web of Deceit]&lt;/ref&gt; since its initial approval for use in food products by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1974. A 2007 medical review on the subject concluded that &quot;the weight of existing scientific evidence indicates that aspartame is safe at current levels of consumption as a non-nutritive sweetener&quot;.&lt;ref name=CritReview&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Magnuson BA |title=Aspartame: a safety evaluation based on current use levels, regulations, and toxicological and epidemiological studies |journal=Critical Reviews in Toxicology |volume=37 |issue=8 |pages=629–727 |year=2007 |pmid=17828671 |doi=10.1080/10408440701516184|author-separator=,|author2=Burdock GA|author3=Doull J|display-authors=3|last4=Kroes|first4=R.

J.|last9=Walker|first9=R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because its breakdown products include [[phenylalanine]], aspartame must be avoided by people with the genetic condition [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU).
==Chemistry==
Aspartame is a [[methyl]] [[ester]] of the [[dipeptide]] of the natural [[amino acid]]s &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-[[aspartic acid]] and &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-[[phenylalanine]]. Under strongly [[acid]]ic or [[Base (chemistry)|alkaline]] conditions, aspartame may generate [[methanol]] by [[hydrolysis]]. Under more severe conditions, the [[peptide bond]]s are also [[hydrolyzed]], resulting in the free amino acids.&lt;ref&gt;

In the chemical synthesis, the two carboxyl groups of aspartic acid are joined into an anhydride, and the amino group is protected by a compound that will prevent further reactions of that group. Phenylalanine is methylated and combined with the ''N''-protected aspartic anhydride, then the blocking group is removed from aspartic acid by acid hydrolysis. The drawback of this technique is that a byproduct, the bitter tasting β-form, is produced when the wrong carboxyl group from aspartic acid links to phenylalanine. A process using an [[Thermolysin|enzyme from ''Bacillus thermoproteolyticus'']] to catalyze the condensation of the chemically altered amino acids will produce high yields without the β-form byproduct. A variant of this method, which has not been used commercially, uses unmodified aspartic acid, but produces low yields. Methods for directly producing aspartyl-phenylalanine by enzymatic means, followed by chemical methylation, have also been tried, but not scaled for industrial production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Yagasaki |first= Makoto |coauthors= Hashimoto, Shin-ichi |year= 2008 |month= November |title= Synthesis and application of dipeptides; current status and perspectives |journal= Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology  |volume= 81 |issue= 1 |pages= 13–22 |pmid= 18795289 |doi= 10.1007/s00253-008-1590-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspartame, an [[artificial sweetener]], is approximately 200 times sweeter than [[sucrose]], or table sugar. Due to this property, even though aspartame produces four kilocalories of energy per gram when metabolized, the quantity of aspartame needed to produce a sweet taste is so small that its caloric contribution is negligible.&lt;ref name=CritReview/&gt;  The taste of aspartame and other artificial sweeteners differs from that of table sugar in the times of onset and how long the sweetness lasts, though aspartame comes closest to sugar's taste profile among approved artificial sweeteners.&lt;ref name=odonnell /&gt;&lt;!-- Section 6.1.2 pp.87–88 --&gt; The sweetness of aspartame lasts longer than sucrose, so it is often blended with other artificial sweeteners such as [[acesulfame potassium]] to produce an overall taste more like sugar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodproductdesign.com/articles/2007/05/new-products-weigh-in.aspx |title=New Products Weigh In |publisher=foodproductdesign.com |accessdate=19 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aspartame can be synthesized from its constituent amino acids, &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-[[phenylalanine]] and &lt;small&gt;L&lt;/small&gt;-[[aspartate]].

Like many other [[peptide]]s, aspartame may [[hydrolyze]] (break down) into its constituent amino acids under conditions of elevated temperature or high [[pH]]. This makes aspartame undesirable as a baking sweetener, and prone to degradation in products hosting a high pH, as required for a long shelf life. The stability of aspartame under heating can be improved to some extent by encasing it in fats or in [[maltodextrin]]. The stability when dissolved in water depends markedly on [[pH]]. At room temperature, it is most stable at pH 4.3, where its [[half-life]] is nearly 300 days. At pH 7, however, its [[half-life]] is only a few days. Most soft-drinks have a pH between 3 and 5, where aspartame is reasonably stable. In products that may require a longer shelf life, such as [[syrups]] for [[soda fountain|fountain beverages]], aspartame is sometimes blended with a more stable sweetener, such as [[saccharin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.thecoca-colacompany.com/mail/goodanswer/us_fountain_beverages.pdf | publisher = [[The Coca-Cola Company]] | title = Fountain Beverages in the US |month=May | year=2007|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspartame's major decomposition products are its cyclic dipeptide ([[diketopiperazine]] form), the de-esterified dipeptide (aspartyl-phenylalanine), and its constituent components, [[phenylalanine]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Prodolliet-&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Prodolliet | first1 = J. | last2 = Bruelhart | first2 = M. | title = Determination of aspartame and its major decomposition products in foods | journal = J AOAC Int | volume = 76 | issue = 2 | pages = 275–82 | year =  1993| pmid = 8471853 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[aspartic acid]],&lt;ref name=stegink1987&gt;{{Cite journal|last= Stegink |first= Lewis D. |year= 1987 |month= July |title= The aspartame story: a model for the clinical testing of a food additive |journal= American Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume= 46 |issue= 1 |pages= 204–15 |pmid= 3300262 |url= http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/abstract/46/1/204}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[methanol]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lin-2000&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Lin | first1 = SY. | last2 = Cheng | first2 = YD. | title = Simultaneous formation and detection of the reaction product of solid-state aspartame sweetener by FT-IR/DSC microscopic system | journal = Food Addit Contam | volume = 17 | issue = 10 | pages = 821–7 | month = Oct | year = 2000 | doi =  10.1080/026520300420385| pmid = 11103265 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At 180 °C, aspartame undergoes decomposition to form a diketopiperazine (DKP) derivative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rastogi-2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Rastogi | first1 = S. | last2 = Zakrzewski | first2 = M. | last3 = Suryanarayanan | first3 = R. | title = Investigation of solid-state reactions using variable temperature X-ray powder diffractrometry.

In products such as [[powdered beverage]]s, the [[amine]] in aspartame can undergo a [[Maillard reaction]] with the [[aldehyde]] groups present in certain [[aroma compound]]s. The ensuing loss of both flavor and sweetness can be prevented by protecting the aldehyde as an [[acetal]].

[[Descriptive statistics|Descriptive analyses]] of solutions containing aspartame report a sweet aftertaste as well as bitter and off-flavour aftertastes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=F.

==Discovery and approval==
Aspartame was discovered in 1965 by James M. Schlatter, a chemist working for [[Searle (company)|G.D. Searle &amp; Company]]. Schlatter had [[Chemical synthesis|synthesized]] aspartame as an intermediate step in generating a tetrapeptide of the hormone, [[gastrin]], for use in assessing an anti-[[Peptic ulcer|ulcer]] drug candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mazur |first= Robert H. |editor1-last= Inglett  |editor1-first= George E. |title= Symposium: sweeteners |year= 1974 |publisher= AVI Publishing |location= Westport, CT |isbn= 0-87055-153-1 |lccn= 73-94092 |pages= 159–163 |chapter= Aspartic acid-based sweetners}}&lt;/ref&gt; He accidentally discovered its sweet taste when he licked his finger, which had become contaminated with aspartame, to lift up a piece of paper.&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-632-04452-7&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Lewis, Ricki |title=Discovery: windows on the life sciences |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=Oxford |year=2001 |page=4 |isbn=0-632-04452-7 |oclc= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Magnuson-2007&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Magnuson BA, Burdock GA, Doull J |title=Aspartame: a safety evaluation based on current use levels, regulations, and toxicological and epidemiological studies |journal=Crit.

In 1975, prompted by issues regarding [[Flagyl]] and [[Aldactone]], a U.S. FDA task force team reviewed 25 studies submitted by the manufacturer, including 11 on aspartame. The team reported “serious deficiencies in Searle’s operations and practices&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gao-87&quot; /&gt; The FDA sought to authenticate 15 of the submitted studies against the supporting data. In 1979, the [[Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition]] (CFSAN) concluded, since many problems with the aspartame studies were minor and did not affect the conclusions, the studies could be used to assess aspartame's safety.&lt;ref name=&quot;gao-87&quot; /&gt;

In 1980, the FDA convened a Public Board of Inquiry (PBOI) consisting of independent advisors charged with examining the purported relationship between aspartame and [[brain cancer]]. The PBOI concluded aspartame does not cause [[Human brain|brain]] damage, but it recommended against approving aspartame at that time, citing unanswered questions about cancer in laboratory rats.&lt;ref name=&quot;gao-87&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. GAO – HRD-87-46 Food and Drug Administration: Food Additive Approval Process '''Followed for Aspartame, June 18, 1987 |accessdate =5 September 2008 | url = http://www.gao.gov/docdblite/info.php?rptno=HRD-87-46 |pages = 94–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of Dr. Adrian Gross, Former FDA Investigator to the U.S. Senate Committee on Labor and Human Resources, 3 November 1987.

In 1996, the FDA removed all restrictions from aspartame, allowing it to be used in all foods.

Several European Union countries approved aspartame in the 1980s, with EU-wide approval in 1994. The European Commission [[Scientific Committee on Food]] reviewed subsequent safety studies and reaffirmed the approval in 2002. The [[European Food Safety Authority]] reported in 2006 that the previously established [[Acceptable Daily Intake]] was appropriate, after reviewing yet another set of studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.efsa.europa.eu/en/efsajournal/pub/356.htm EFSA ::.

==Metabolism and phenylketonuria==
Upon ingestion, aspartame breaks down into residual components, including [[aspartic acid]], [[phenylalanine]], [[methanol]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Roberts HJ |title=Aspartame disease: a possible cause for concomitant Graves' disease and pulmonary hypertension |journal=Texas Heart Institute Journal |volume=31 |issue=1 |pages=105; author reply 105–6 |year=2004 |pmid=15061638 |pmc=387446}}&lt;/ref&gt; in ratio of 4:5:1 by mass&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Humphries |first1= P |last2= Pretorius |first2= E |last3= Naudé |first3= H |year= 2008 |title= Direct and indirect cellular effects of aspartame on the brain |journal= Eur J Clin Nutrition |volume= 62 |pages= 451–462 |doi= 10.1038/sj.ejcn.1602866 |pmid= 17684524 |issue= 4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and further breakdown products including [[formaldehyde]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Trocho C |title=Formaldehyde derived from dietary aspartame binds to tissue components in vivo |journal=Life Sciences |volume=63 |issue=5 |pages=337–49 |year=1998 |pmid=9714421 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3205(98)00282-3 |author-separator=, |author2=Pardo R |author3=Rafecas I |display-authors=3 |last4=Virgili |first4=J |last5=Remesar |first5=X |last6=Fernández-López |first6=JA |last7=Alemany |first7=M}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[formic acid]], accumulation of the latter being suspected as the major cause of injury in methanol poisoning. Human studies show that formic acid is excreted faster than it is formed after ingestion of aspartate. In some fruit juices, higher concentrations of methanol can be found  than the amount produced from aspartame in beverages.&lt;ref name=stegink1987 /&gt;

High levels of the naturally-occurring [[essential amino acid]] [[phenylalanine]] are a health hazard to those born with [[phenylketonuria]] (PKU), a rare inherited disease that prevents phenylalanine from being properly metabolized. Since individuals with PKU must consider aspartame as an additional source of phenylalanine, foods containing aspartame sold in the United States must state &quot;Phenylketonurics: Contains Phenylalanine&quot; on their product labels.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=172.804 Code of Federal Regulations Title 21]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK, foods that contain aspartame are legally required by the country's [[Food Standards Agency]] to list the substance among the product's ingredients and carry the warning &quot;Contains a source of phenylalanine&quot; – this is usually at the foot of the list of ingredients. Manufacturers are also required to print '&quot;with sweetener(s)&quot; on the label close to the main product name' on foods that contain &quot;sweeteners such as aspartame&quot; or &quot;with sugar and sweetener(s)&quot; on &quot;foods that contain both sugar and sweetener&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/sweeteners/55174#h_5/  ''Aspartame – Labelling'', UK Food Standards Agency, 18 July 2006].

In Canada, foods that contain aspartame are legally required by the country to list the substance among the product's ingredients and include a measure of the amount of aspartame per serving. As well, labels must state that the product contains phenylalanine – this is usually in the order of ingredients, contained in brackets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nutrasweet.com/articles/sendfile.asp?Id=161&amp;filename=AF-TB-03-005.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pregnancy and lactation==
In a study done in 1979, the effect of aspartame ingestion on blood and milk amino acid levels in lactating women was tested.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1979&quot;&gt;Baker, G. L., L. J. Filer, JR., and L. D. Stegink. “Plasma, Erythrocyte and Human Milk Levels of Free Amino Acids in Lactating Women Administered Aspartame or Lactose.” The American Society for Nutrition 109 (1979): 2173–2181. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In this study, six women from the ages of 20 to 29 with established lactation were studied after oral administration of aspartame or lactose (50 mg/kg body weight) in a random order, with the intent to study the differences in breast milk between the two. The study resulted with the conclusion that aspartame administration at 50 mg/kg body weight has a small effect upon the milk aspartate levels and although a small increase in aspartate time-effect scores was noted over the four-hour postabsorptive period, no significant difference was noted over the entire 24-hour watching period.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1979&quot;/&gt;

==Economics==
Under the trade names [[Equal (sweetener)|Equal]], [[NutraSweet]], and [[Canderel]], aspartame is an ingredient in approximately 6,000 consumer foods and beverages sold worldwide, including (but not limited to) diet sodas and other soft drinks, instant breakfasts, breath mints, cereals, sugar-free chewing gum, cocoa mixes, frozen desserts, gelatin desserts, juices, laxatives, chewable vitamin supplements, milk drinks, pharmaceutical drugs and supplements, shake mixes, tabletop sweeteners, teas, [[instant coffee]]s, topping mixes, wine coolers and yogurt.  It is provided as a table [[condiment]] in some countries. Aspartame is less suitable for [[baking]] than other sweeteners, because it [[chemical decomposition|breaks down]] when heated and loses much of its sweetness. Aspartame is also one of the main sugar substitutes used by people with [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]].

===NutraSweet Company===
In 1985, [[Monsanto Company]] bought G.D. Searle, and the aspartame business became a separate Monsanto subsidiary, the [[NutraSweet|NutraSweet Company]]. In March 2000, Monsanto sold it to [[J.W. Childs]] Equity Partners II L.P.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EUY/is_22_6/ai_62920821&quot;&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EUY/is_22_6/ai_62920821 J.W. Childs Equity Partners II, L.P], ''Food &amp; Drink Weekly'', 5 June 2000&lt;/ref&gt; European use patents on aspartame expired starting in 1987,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Nutrasweet's Bitter Fight |last= Shapiro |first= Eben |url= http://www.nytimes.com/1989/11/19/business/nutrasweet-s-bitter-fight.html |date= 19 November 1989 |newspaper= New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the U.S. patent expired in 1992. Since then, the company has competed for market share with other manufacturers, including [[Ajinomoto]], [[Merisant]] and the Holland Sweetener Company.

===Ajinomoto===
Many aspects of industrial synthesis of aspartame were established by Ajinomoto.&lt;ref name=odonnell /&gt; In 2004, the market for aspartame, in which [[Ajinomoto]], the world's largest aspartame manufacturer, had a 40 percent share, was 14,000 metric tons a year, and consumption of the product was rising by 2 percent a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=a1rBnsdDJnM8&amp;refer=japan |title=Ajinomoto May Exceed Full-Year Forecasts on Amino Acid Products – Bloomberg |publisher=Bloomberg |accessdate=23 June 2010 |date=18 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ajinomoto acquired its aspartame business in 2000 from [[Monsanto]] for $67M.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icis.com/Articles/2000/06/05/114953/sweetener-sale.html |title=Sweetener sale-05/06/2000-ECN |publisher=icis.com |accessdate=9 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Ajinomoto sued British supermarket chain [[Asda]], part of [[Wal-Mart]], for a malicious falsehood action concerning its aspartame product when the substance was listed as excluded from the chain's product line, along with other &quot;nasties&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;asda&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisismoney.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=441128&amp;in_page_id=2 |title=Asda gears up for additives battle/ aspartame |work=Evening Standard |location=London |accessdate=23 June 2010|unused_data=This is Money }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2009, a British court found in favour of Asda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodanddrinkeurope.com/Products-Marketing/Asda-claims-victory-in-aspartame-nasty-case |title=Asda claims victory in aspartame ‘nasty’ case |publisher=foodanddrinkeurope.com |accessdate=23 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2010, an appeals court reversed the decision, allowing Ajinomoto to pursue a case against Asda to protect aspartame's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodbev.com/news/court-of-appeal-rules-in-ajinomotoasda-aspartame-case |title=FoodBev.com |publisher=foodbev.com |accessdate=23 June 2010|unused_data=Court of Appeal rules in Ajinomoto/Asda aspartame case }}&lt;/ref&gt; Asda said that it would continue to use the term &quot;no nasties&quot; on its own-label products,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodnavigator.com/Legislation/Radical-new-twist-in-Ajinomoto-vs-Asda-nasty-battle |title=Radical new twist in Ajinomoto vs Asda 'nasty' battle |publisher=foodnavigator.com |accessdate=23 June 2010 | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20100606185621/http://www.foodnavigator.com/Legislation/Radical-new-twist-in-Ajinomoto-vs-Asda-nasty-battle| archivedate= 6 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the suit was settled in 2011 with ASDA choosing to remove references to aspartame from its packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Asda settles 'nasty' aspartame legal battle with Ajinomoto |first= Ben |last= Bouckley |url= http://www.foodnavigator.com/Financial-Industry/Asda-settles-nasty-aspartame-legal-battle-with-Ajinomoto |agency= FoodNavigator.com |publisher= William Reed Business Media SAS |date=18 May 2011 |accessdate=18 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, [[Ajinomoto]] announced a new brand name for its aspartame sweetener – AminoSweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodnavigator.com/Financial-Industry/Ajinomoto-brands-aspartame-AminoSweet |title=Ajinomoto brands aspartame AminoSweet |publisher=Foodnavigator.com |accessdate=7 July 2010}}

===Holland Sweetener Company===
A joint venture of [[DSM (company)|DSM]] and [[Tosoh]], the Holland Sweetener Company manufactured aspartame using the enzymatic process developed by Toyo Soda (Tosoh) and sold as the brand Sanecta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lee |first= Thomas D. |title= Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology |edition= 5th |volume= 24 |year= 2007 |publisher= Wiley |isbn= 0-471-48496-2 |pages= 224–252 |chapter= Sweetners |doi=10.1002/0471238961.19230505120505.a01.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, they developed a combination [[aspartame-acesulfame salt]] under the brand name Twinsweet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Holland Sweetener rolls out Twinsweet |url= http://www.bakeryandsnacks.com/Processing-Packaging/Holland-Sweetener-rolls-out-Twinsweet |accessdate=29 July 2011 |newspaper= BakeryAndSnacks.com |publisher= William Reed Business Media |date= 19 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; They left the sweetener industry in late 2006, because &quot;global aspartame markets are facing structural oversupply, which has caused worldwide strong price erosion over the last five years&quot;, making the business &quot;persistently unprofitable&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.marketwire.com/mw/release_html_b1?release_id=115447&quot;&gt;[http://www.marketwire.com/mw/release html b1?release id=115447]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Competing products===
Because [[sucralose]], unlike aspartame, retains its sweetness after being heated, and has at least twice the shelf life of aspartame, it has become more popular as an ingredient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E6DC1030F931A15751C1A9629C8B63 |title=A Something Among the Sweet Nothings; Splenda Is Leaving Other Sugar Substitutes With That Empty Feeling – New York Times |publisher=query.nytimes.com |accessdate=18 June 2010 | first=Melanie | last=Warner | date=22 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, along with differences in marketing and changing consumer preferences, caused aspartame to lose market share to sucralose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| author = John Schmeltzer | url = http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-0412020391dec02,1,2234783.story?coll=chi-business-hed | title = Equal fights to get even as Splenda looks sweet] |work=Chicago Tribune |date=2 December 2004 | accessdate =4 July 2007 | format = subscription required| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070624232532/http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-0412020391dec02,1,2234783.story?coll=chi-business-hed| archivedate= 24 June 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Carney | first = By Beth | title = It's Not All Sweetness for Splenda | work = BusinessWeek: Daily Briefing | accessdate =5 September 2008 | date = 19 January 2005 | url = http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jan2005/nf20050119_5391_db014.htm | archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081007062929/http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/jan2005/nf20050119_5391_db014.htm| archivedate= 7 October 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, aspartame traded at about $30/kg and sucralose, which is roughly three times sweeter by weight, at around $300/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beveragedaily.com/Markets/Aspartame-defence-courts-reaction |title=Aspartame defence courts reaction |publisher=beveragedaily.com |accessdate=7 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety and approval controversies==
{{Main|Aspartame controversy}}

Aspartame has been found to be safe for human consumption by more than ninety countries worldwide,&lt;ref name=&quot;Health Canada&quot;&gt;[[Health Canada]]: {{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/securit/addit/sweeten-edulcor/aspartame-eng.php |title=Aspartame – Artificial Sweeteners }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FSANZ&gt;[[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]]: {{cite web|url=http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/newsroom/factsheets/factsheets2007/aspartameseptember203703.cfm |title=Food Standards Australia New Zealand: Aspartame (September 2007) }}&lt;/ref&gt; with FDA officials describing aspartame as &quot;one of the most thoroughly tested and studied food additives the agency has ever approved&quot; and its safety as &quot;clear cut&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://web.archive.org/web/20071214170430/www.fda.gov/fdac/features/1999/699_sugar.html | title = Sugar Substitutes: Americans Opt for Sweetness and Lite | work = [[FDA Consumer]] | date = November–December 1999 | accessdate =29 January 2009 | first = John | last = Henkel}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has been the subject of several controversies, hoaxes&lt;ref name=Snopes1 /&gt; and health scares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last= Flaherty |first= Megan |title= Harvesting Kidneys and other Urban Legends |url= http://www.nurseweek.com/features/99-4/myths.html |newspaper= NurseWeek |date=12 April 1999 |accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially aspartame was approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) in 1974, however, problems with Searle's safety testing program including testing of aspartame were discovered subsequently. The approval was rescinded the following year, but after outside reviews of the problematic tests and additional testing, final approval was granted in 1981. Because allegations of [[Conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] marred the FDA's approval of aspartame,&lt;ref name=GAO87/&gt;&lt;!--First sentence of this document: &quot;Since 1974, aspartame, a food additive marketed under the brand name NutraSweetB, has been the subject of controversy.&quot;--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost_historical/access/125899752.html?dids=125899752:125899752&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT|work=Washington Post|title=Controversy Surrounds Sweetener|first=Carole | last=Sugarman|date=3 July 1983|accessdate =25 November 2008|pages=D1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=FDA Consumer Magazine|author=Henkel J|title=Sugar substitutes.
