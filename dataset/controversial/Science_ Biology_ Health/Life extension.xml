      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="48508">'''Life extension science''', also known as '''anti-aging medicine''', '''experimental gerontology''', and '''biomedical gerontology''', is the study of slowing down or reversing the [[senescence|processes of aging]] to extend both the [[maximum lifespan|maximum]] and [[life expectancy|average lifespan]]. Some researchers in this area, and &quot;life extensionists&quot; or &quot;longevists&quot; (who wish to achieve longer lives for themselves), believe that future breakthroughs in tissue [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] with [[stem cell]]s, [[molecular]] repair, and [[organ (anatomy)|organ]] replacement (such as with artificial organs or [[xenotransplantation]]s) will eventually enable humans to have indefinite lifespans (agerasia&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|agerasia}}&lt;/ref&gt;) through complete rejuvenation to a healthy youthful condition.

The sale of [[wikt:putative|putative]] anti-aging products such as nutrition, physical fitness, skin care, hormone replacements, vitamins, supplements and herbs is a lucrative global industry, with the US market generating about $50&amp;nbsp;billion of revenue each year.&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt; Medical experts state that the use of such products has not been shown to affect the aging process, and many claims of anti-aging medicine advocates have been roundly criticized by medical experts, including the [[American Medical Association]].&lt;ref name=AMA/&gt;&lt;ref name=Holliday&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Holliday, R |title=The extreme arrogance of anti-aging medicine |journal=Biogerontology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=223–8 |date=April 2009 |pmid=18726707 |doi=10.1007/s10522-008-9170-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PositionStatement&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name= EMBOSENS/&gt;&lt;ref name=USC&gt;{{Cite news |first=Carl |last=Marziali |date=7 December 2010 |title=Reaching Toward the Fountain of Youth |url=http://uscnews.usc.edu/health/reaching_toward_the_fountain_of_youth.html |work=USC Trojan Family Magazine |accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has not been shown that the goal of indefinite human lifespans itself is necessarily unfeasible; some animals such as [[lobsters]] and certain [[jellyfish]] do not die of old age, and an award was offered to anyone who could prove life extensionist [[Aubrey de Grey]]'s hopes were 'unworthy of learned debate'; nobody won the prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/speakers/aubrey_de_grey.html |title=Aubrey de Grey &amp;#124; Profile on |publisher=Ted.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bioethicist]]s question the ethical ramifications of life extension.

==Average and maximum lifespans==
{{Main|Senescence}}
During the process of [[aging]], an organism accumulates damage to [[macromolecule]]s, its [[cell (biology)|cells]], its [[biological tissue|tissues]] and its [[organ (anatomy)|organs]]. This accumulated damage is the result of [[oxidation]] damage to the cell contents caused by [[free radicals]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}. The longest a human has ever been proven to live is 122 years, the case of [[Jeanne Calment]] who was born in 1875 and died in 1997, whereas the maximum lifespan of a [[mouse]], commonly used as a model in research on aging, is about four years. Genetic differences between humans and mice that may account for these different aging rates include efficiency of [[DNA repair]], types and quantities of [[antioxidant]] [[enzyme]]s, and different rates of [[radical (chemistry)|free radical]] production. The most important and challenging factor remains the [[telomere]] limitation of each individual species.

Average lifespan in a population is lowered by [[infant mortality|infant]] and [[child mortality]], which are frequently linked to infectious diseases or nutrition problems. Later in life, vulnerability to [[accident]]s and age-related [[chronic disease]] such as [[cancer]] or [[cardiovascular disease]] play an increasing role in mortality. Extension of expected lifespan can often be achieved by access to improved medical care, [[vaccinations]], good [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], [[exercise]] and avoidance of hazards such as [[tobacco smoking|smoking]].

[[Maximum lifespan]] is determined by the rate of [[aging]] for a species inherent in its [[gene]]s and by environmental factors. One widely recognized method of extending maximum lifespan in organisms such as [[nematode]]s is [[calorie restriction]]. Another technique used evolutionary pressure such as breeding from only older members.

Theoretically, extension of maximum lifespan could be achieved by reducing the rate of aging damage, by [[tissue engineering|periodic replacement of damaged tissues]], or by [[nanobiotechnology|molecular repair]] or [[rejuvenation (aging)|rejuvenation]] of deteriorated cells and tissues and the enhancement of [[telomerase]] enzyme activity. Future research will be geared towards telomere repair strategies.

===Diets and supplements===
Much life extension research focuses on nutrition—[[diet (nutrition)|diets]] or [[dietary supplement|supplements]]—as a means to extend lifespan, although few of these have been systematically tested for significant longevity effects. The many diets promoted by anti-aging advocates are often contradictory. A dietary pattern with some support from scientific research is [[caloric restriction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author= Schumacher, B; van der Pluijm, I; Moorhouse, MJ; et al. |title=Delayed and Accelerated Aging Share Common Longevity Assurance Mechanisms |journal=PLoS Genetics |volume=4 |issue=8 |pages=e1000161 |year=2008 |pmid=18704162 |pmc=2493043 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000161 |editor1-last= Kim |editor1-first= Stuart K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Chen, J; Velalar, CN; Ruan, R |title=Identifying the changes in gene profiles regulating the amelioration of age-related oxidative damages in kidney tissue of rats by the intervention of adult-onset calorie restriction |journal=Rejuvenation Research |volume=11 |issue=4 |pages=757–63 |date=August 2008 |pmid=18710334 |doi=10.1089/rej.2008.0718}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[free-radical theory]] of [[aging]] suggests that [[antioxidant]] supplements, such as [[Vitamin&amp;nbsp;C]], [[tocopherol|Vitamin&amp;nbsp;E]], [[coenzyme Q10|Q&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[lipoic acid]], [[carnosine]], and [[acetylcysteine|N-acetylcysteine]], might extend human life. However, combined evidence from several clinical trials suggest that [[beta-Carotene|β-Carotene]] supplements and high doses of Vitamin&amp;nbsp;E increase mortality rates.&lt;ref&gt;Mortality in Randomized Trials of Antioxidant Supplements for Primary and Secondary Prevention, a Systematic Review and Meta-analysis by Goran Bjelakovic, MD, DrMedSci; Dimitrinka Nikolova, MA; Lise Lotte Gluud, MD, DrMedSci; Rosa G.

[[Resveratrol]] is a [[Sir2|sirtuin]] stimulant that appears to extend lifespan in simple organisms such as [[nematode]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Resveratrol Longevity Science Makes Dramatic U-Turn, But Resveratrol Supplements Remain Unchanged |publisher=Resveratrol Partners |date=10 September 2008 |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS86486+10-Sep-2008+PRN20080910 |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and short-lived fish.&lt;ref name=pmid16461283&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Valenzano, DR; Terzibasi, E; Genade, T; Cattaneo, A; Domenici, L; Cellerino, A |title=Resveratrol prolongs lifespan and retards the onset of age-related markers in a short-lived vertebrate |journal=Current Biology |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=296–300 |date=February 2006 |pmid=16461283 |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2005.12.038}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some supplements, including the minerals [[selenium]]&lt;ref name=&quot;selenium7d&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Schroeder, HA; Mitchener, M |title=Selenium and tellurium in rats: effect on growth, survival and tumors |journal=The Journal of Nutrition |volume=101 |issue=11 |pages=1531–40 |date=1 November 1971 |pmid=5124041 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=5124041}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[zinc]]&lt;ref name= pmid9663556&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Mocchegiani, E; Santarelli, L; Tibaldi, A; et al. |title=Presence of links between zinc and melatonin during the circadian cycle in old mice: effects on thymic endocrine activity and on the survival |journal=Journal of Neuroimmunology |volume=86 |issue=2 |pages=111–22 |date=June 1998 |pmid=9663556 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0165-5728(97)00253-1 |doi= 10.1016/S0165-5728(97)00253-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid8582782&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Mocchegiani, E; Santarelli, L; Muzzioli, M; Fabris, N |title=Reversibility of the thymic involution and of age-related peripheral immune dysfunctions by zinc supplementation in old mice |journal=International Journal of Immunopharmacology |volume=17 |issue=9 |pages=703–18 |date=September 1995 |pmid=8582782 |url= http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/019205619500059B |doi=10.1016/0192-0561(95)00059-B}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been reported to extend the lifespan of rats and mice, though none have been proven to do so in humans, and significant toxic effects were observed.

Interestingly there is a tea called [[Jiaogulan]] that has been dubbed &quot;China's Immortality Herb&quot;. {{cn|date=September 2012}}

===Hormone treatments===
The anti-aging industry offers several [[hormone therapies]]. Some of these have been criticized for possible dangers to the patient and a lack of proven effect. For example, the [[American Medical Association]] has been critical of some anti-aging hormone therapies.&lt;ref name=AMA&gt;{{Cite news |first=Bruce |last=Japsen |date=15 June 2009 |title=AMA report questions science behind using hormones as anti-aging treatment |url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2009/jun/15/business/chi-anti-aging-15-jun15 |work=[[The Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if some recent clinical studies have shown that low-dose GH treatment for adults with GH deficiency changes the body composition by increasing [[muscle]] mass, decreasing fat mass, increasing [[bone]] density and muscle strength, improves [[cardiovascular]] parameters (i.e. decrease of [[LDL cholesterol]]), and affects the quality of life without significant side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Alexopoulou O, Abs R, Maiter D |title=Treatment of adult growth hormone deficiency: who, why and how?

An early study suggested that supplementation of mice with growth hormone increased average life expectancy.&lt;ref name=pmid2002700&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Khansari, DN; Gustad, T |title=Effects of long-term, low-dose growth hormone therapy on immune function and life expectancy of mice |journal=Mechanisms of Ageing and Development |volume=57 |issue=1 |pages=87–100 |date=January 1991 |pmid=2002700 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/0047-6374(91)90026-V |doi=10.1016/0047-6374(91)90026-V}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional animal experiments have suggested that growth hormone may generally act to shorten maximum lifespan; [[knockout mouse|knockout mice]] lacking the [[receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] for growth hormone live especially long.&lt;ref name=pmid16799137&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Bonkowski, MS; Pamenter, RW; Rocha, JS; Masternak, MM; Panici, JA; Bartke, A |title=Long-lived growth hormone receptor knockout mice show a delay in age-related changes of body composition and bone characteristics |journal=The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences |volume=61 |issue=6 |pages=562–7 |date=1 June 2006 |pmid=16799137 |url=http://biomed.gerontologyjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16799137}}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, mouse models lacking the insulin-like growth factor also live especially long and have low levels of growth hormone.&lt;ref name=pmid16799137/&gt;]
======Insulinlike growth factor (IGF-1) restriction======
People suffering from rare condition known as [[Laron syndrome]] have mutation in the gene that makes the receptor for growth hormone. Its theorised that that mutation may hold a key to life extention.
{{quote|Dr. Longo said that some level of IGF-1 was necessary to protect against heart disease, but that lowering the level might be beneficial. A drug that does this is already on the market for treatment of [[acromegaly]], a thickening of the bones caused by excessive growth hormone. “Our underlying hypothesis is that this drug would prolong life span,” Dr. Longo said. He said he was not taking the drug, called pegvisomant or Somavert, which is very hard to obtain. }}

===Scientific controversy regarding anti-aging nutritional supplementation and medicine===
Some critics dispute the portrayal of aging as a disease. For example, [[Leonard Hayflick]], who determined that [[fibroblast]]s are limited to around 50&amp;nbsp;cell divisions, reasons that aging is an unavoidable consequence of [[entropy]]. Hayflick and fellow [[biogerontologist]]s [[S. Jay Olshansky|Jay Olshansky]] and Bruce Carnes have strongly criticized the anti-aging industry in response to what they see as unscrupulous profiteering from the sale of unproven anti-aging [[dietary supplement|supplements]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PositionStatement&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Olshansky, SJ; Hayflick, L; Carnes, BA |title=Position statement on human aging |journal=The Journals of Gerontology Series A: Biological Sciences and Medical Sciences |volume=57 |issue=8 |pages=B292–7 |date=1 August 2002 |pmid=12145354 |url=http://biomed.gerontologyjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12145354 |doi=10.1093/gerona/57.8.B292}}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--This may be a good place to link into the broader social debate on life extension ethics. Hayflick is not the only one to object to the portrayal/treatment of aging as a disease. Many doctors, social scientists, feminists, etc. do too--&gt;

===Ethics and politics of anti-aging nutritional supplementation and medicine===
Politics relevant to the substances of life extension pertain mostly to communications and availability.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}&lt;!--Need some clarification here. The title implies the discussion is on the politics/ethics of all life extension practices, not just marketing of pharma/surgery--&gt;

In the [[United States]], product claims on food and drug labels are strictly regulated. The [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] ([[freedom of speech]]) protects third-party publishers' rights to distribute fact, opinion and speculation on life extension practices. Manufacturers and suppliers also provide informational publications, but because they market the substances, they are subject to monitoring and enforcement by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), which polices claims by marketers. What constitutes the difference between truthful and false claims is hotly debated and is a central controversy in this arena.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}&lt;!--This is just the opening paragraph, describing the political arena and stage of conflict. More to follow.--&gt;

===Consumer motivations for using anti-aging products===
Research by Sobh and Martin (2011) suggests that people buy anti-aging products to obtain a hoped-for self (e.g., keeping a youthful skin) or to avoid a feared-self (e.g., looking old). The research shows that when consumers pursue a hoped-for self, it is expectations of success that most strongly drive their motivation to use the product. The research also shows why doing badly when trying to avoid a feared self is more motivating than doing well. Interestingly, when product use is seen to fail it is more motivating than success when consumers seek to avoid a feared-self. &lt;ref&gt;Sobh, Rana and Brett A. S. Martin (2011), [http://www.basmartin.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/12/S-and-M.pdf &quot;Feedback Information and Consumer Motivation. The Moderating Role of Positive and Negative Reference Values in Self-Regulation&quot;], ''European Journal of Marketing'', 45 (6), 963-986.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed strategies of life extension==
===Nanotechnology===
Future advances in [[nanomedicine]] could give rise to life extension through the repair of many processes thought to be responsible for aging. [[K. Eric Drexler]], one of the founders of nanotechnology, postulated cell repair machines, including ones operating within cells and utilizing as yet hypothetical molecular computers, in his 1986 book Engines of Creation. [[Raymond Kurzweil]], a [[futurist]] and [[transhumanist]], stated in his book [[The Singularity Is Near]] that he believes that advanced medical [[nanorobotics]] could completely remedy the effects of aging by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ray |last=Kurzweil |authorlink=Raymond Kurzweil |year=2005 |title=[[The Singularity Is Near]] |publisher=[[Viking Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-670-03384-3 |oclc=57201348}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cloning and body part replacement===
Some life extensionists suggest that [[therapeutic cloning]] and [[stem cell]] research could one day provide a way to generate cells, body parts, or even entire bodies (generally referred to as [[reproductive cloning]]) that would be genetically identical to a prospective patient. Recently, the US Department of Defense initiated a program to research the possibility of growing human body parts on mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Donald |last=Melanson |date=April 22, 2008 |title=DoD establishes institute tasked with regrowing body parts |url=http://www.engadget.com/2008/04/22/dod-establishes-institute-tasked-with-regrowing-body-parts/ |publisher=[[Engadget]] |accessdate=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Complex biological structures, such as mammalian joints and limbs, have not yet been replicated. Dog and primate brain transplantation experiments were conducted in the mid-20th century but failed due to [[transplant rejection|rejection]] and the inability to restore nerve connections. As of 2006, the implantation of bio-engineered bladders grown from patients' own cells has proven to be a viable treatment for bladder disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Roxanne |last=Khamsi |date=April 4, 2006 |title=Bio-engineered bladders successful in patients |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn8939-bioengineered-bladders-successful-in-patients.html |publisher=[[New Scientist]] |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of body part replacement and cloning contend that the required biotechnologies are likely to appear earlier than other life-extension technologies.

The use of human [[stem cells]], particularly [[embryonic stem cells]], is controversial. Opponents' objections generally are based on interpretations of religious teachings or ethical considerations.  Proponents of stem cell research point out that cells are routinely formed and destroyed in a variety of contexts. Use of stem cells taken from the umbilical cord or parts of the adult body may not provoke controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Christine |last=White |date=19 August 2005 |title=Umbilical stem cell breakthrough |url=http://www.stemcellnews.com/articles/stem-cells-umbilical-breakthrough.htm |work=[[The Australian]] |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The controversies over cloning are similar, except general public opinion in most countries stands in opposition to [[reproductive cloning]]. Some proponents of therapeutic cloning predict the production of whole bodies, lacking consciousness, for eventual brain transplantation.

===Cryonics===
{{Main|Cryonics}}
For cryonicists (advocates of [[cryopreservation]]), storing the body at low temperatures after death may provide an &quot;ambulance&quot; into a future in which advanced medical technologies may allow resuscitation and repair. They speculate [[cryogenic]] temperatures will minimize changes in biological tissue for many years, giving the medical community ample time to cure all disease, rejuvenate the aged and repair any damage that is caused by the [[cryopreservation]] process.

Many cryonicists do not believe that [[legal death]] is &quot;real [[death]]&quot; because stoppage of [[heart rate|heartbeat]] and [[breath]]ing—the usual medical criteria for legal death—occur before biological death of [[cell (biology)|cells]] and [[biological tissue|tissues]] of the body. Even at room [[temperature]], cells may take hours to die and days to [[decompose]]. Although [[neurological]] damage occurs within 4–6 minutes of cardiac arrest, the irreversible [[neurodegenerative disease|neurodegenerative]] processes do not manifest for hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Garcia, JH; Liu, KF; Ho, KL |title=Neuronal necrosis after middle cerebral artery occlusion in Wistar rats progresses at different time intervals in the caudoputamen and the cortex |journal=Stroke |volume=26 |issue=4 |pages=636–42; discussion 643 |date=1 April 1995 |pmid=7709411 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7709411 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.26.4.636}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cryonicists state that rapid cooling and [[heart|cardio]]-[[lung|pulmonary]] support applied immediately after certification of death can preserve [[cell (biology)|cells]] and [[biological tissue|tissues]] for long-term preservation at [[cryogenic]] [[temperature]]s. People, particularly children, have survived up to an hour without heartbeat after submersion in ice water. In one case, full recovery was reported after 45 minutes underwater.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Perk, L; Borger van de Burg, F; Berendsen, HH; van't Wout, JW |title=Full recovery after 45 min accidental submersion |journal=Intensive Care Medicine |volume=28 |issue=4 |page=524 |date=April 2002 |pmid=11967613 |doi=10.1007/s00134-002-1245-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; To facilitate rapid preservation of cells and tissue, cryonics &quot;standby teams&quot; are available to wait by the bedside of patients who are to be cryopreserved to apply cooling and cardio-pulmonary support as soon as possible after declaration of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcor.org/BecomeMember/standby.html |title=Comprehensive Member Standby |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No [[mammal]] has been successfully cryopreserved and brought back to life, and resuscitation from [[cryonics]] is not possible with current science. Some scientists still support the idea based on their expectations of the [[technological singularity|capabilities of future science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imminst.org/cryonics_letter/ |title=Scientists' Open Letter on Cryonics |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alcor.org/AboutCryonics/index.html |title=Advances in Cryonics |accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS)===

Another proposed life extension technology would combine existing and predicted future biochemical and genetic techniques. One such theoretical strategy proposes a [[cancer research|cure for cancer]], [[stem cell treatments]], addition of new enzymes to the human body and moving [[mitochondrial]] DNA to the cellular nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Aubrey |last=de Grey |authorlink=Aubrey de Grey |coauthor=Michael Rae |title=[[Ending Aging|Ending Aging: The Rejuvenation Breakthroughs that Could Reverse Human Aging in Our Lifetime]] |publisher=[[St. Martin's Press]] |year=2007 |location=[[New York City]] |isbn= 978-0-312-36706-0 |oclc=132583222}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no scientific evidence that supports this strategy,&lt;ref name=EMBOSENS&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Warner, H; Anderson, J; Austad, S; et al. |title=Science fact and the SENS agenda |journal=EMBO Reports |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=1006–8 |date=November 2005 |pmid=16264422 |pmc=1371037 |doi= 10.1038/sj.embor.7400555}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been called [[pseudoscientific]] because its proposed techniques are speculative.&lt;ref name=Holliday/&gt;

===Genetic modification===
[[Gene therapy]], in which artificial genes are integrated with an organism to replace mutated or otherwise deficient genes, has been proposed as a future strategy to prevent aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Neuroendocrinology of Aging: The Potential of Gene Therapy as an Interventive Strategy |journal=Gerontology |date=2001-01-08 |first=Rodolfo G. |last=Goya |coauthors=Federico Bolognani, Claudia B.

===Fooling genes===

In ''[[The Selfish Gene]]'', [[Richard Dawkins]] describes an approach to life-extension that involves &quot;fooling genes&quot; into thinking the body is young.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[The Selfish Gene]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1976, 2006 |location=[[New York]] |isbn= 978-0-19-929115-1 | pages = 41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dawkins attributes inspiration for this idea to [[Peter Medawar]]. The basic idea is that our bodies are composed of genes that activate throughout our lifetimes, some when we are young, and others when we are older. Presumably, these genes are activated by environmental factors, and the changes caused by these genes activating can be lethal. It is a statistical certainty that we possess more lethal genes that activate in later life than in early life. Therefore, to extend life, we should be able to prevent these genes from switching on, and we should be able to do so by &quot;identifying changes in the internal chemical environment of a body that take place during aging... and by simulating the superficial chemical properties of a young body&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Richard |last=Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[The Selfish Gene]] |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |year=1976, 2006 |location=[[New York]] |isbn= 978-0-19-929115-1 | page = 42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of life extension and the life extension movement==
In 1970, the [[American Aging Association]] was formed under the impetus of [[Denham Harman]], originator of the [[free radical theory]] of [[aging]]. Harman wanted an organization of [[biogerontologist]]s that was devoted to research and to the sharing of information among scientists interested in extending human lifespan.

In 1976, futurists Joel Kurtzman and Philip Gordon wrote ''No More Dying. The Conquest Of Aging And The Extension Of Human Life'', (ISBN 0-440-36247-4) the first popular book on research to extend human lifespan. Subsequently, Kurtzman was invited to testify before the House Select Committee on Aging, chaired by [[Claude Pepper]] of Florida, to discuss the impact of life extension on the Social Security system.

[[Saul Kent]] published ''The Life Extension Revolution'' (ISBN 0-688-03580-9) in 1980 and created a [[nutraceutical]] firm called the [[Life Extension Foundation]], a non-profit organization that promotes dietary supplements. The Life Extension Foundation publishes a periodical called ''Life Extension Magazine''. The 1982 bestselling book ''[[Life Extension: A Practical Scientific Approach]]'' (ISBN 0-446-51229-X) by [[Durk Pearson]] and [[Sandy Shaw]] further popularized the phrase &quot;life extension&quot;.

In 1983, [[Roy Walford]], a life-extensionist and [[gerontologist]], published a popular book called ''Maximum Lifespan''. In 1988, Walford and his student Richard Weindruch summarized their research into the ability of [[calorie restriction]] to extend the lifespan of [[rodent]]s in ''The Retardation of Aging and Disease by Dietary Restriction'' (ISBN 0-398-05496-7). It had been known since the work of [[Clive McCay]] in the 1930s that calorie restriction can extend the maximum lifespan of rodents. But it was the work of Walford and Weindruch that gave detailed scientific grounding to that knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Walford's personal interest in life extension motivated his scientific work and he practiced calorie restriction himself. Walford died at the age of 80 from complications caused by [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]].

Money generated by the non-profit Life Extension Foundation allowed Saul Kent to finance the [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation]], the world's largest [[cryonics]] organization. The cryonics movement had been launched in 1962 by [[Robert Ettinger]]'s book, ''The Prospect of Immortality''. In the 1960s, Saul Kent had been a co-founder of the Cryonics Society of New York. Alcor gained national prominence when baseball star [[Ted Williams]] was [[cryopreservation|cryonically preserved]] by Alcor in 2002 and a family dispute arose as to whether Williams had really wanted to be cryopreserved.

Regulatory and legal struggles between the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and the Life Extension Foundation included seizure of merchandise and court action. In 1991, [[Saul Kent]] and Bill Faloon, the principals of the Foundation, were jailed. The LEF accused the FDA of perpetrating a &quot;Holocaust&quot; and &quot;seeking gestapo-like power&quot; through its regulation of drugs and marketing claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first= Ty |last=Clevenger |date=Summer 2000 |title=Internet pharmacies: cyberspace versus the regulatory state |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3048/is_2_15/ai_n28816595/ |journal=Journal of Law and Health |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, the [[American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine]] (A4M) was formed to create what it considered an anti-aging medical specialty distinct from [[geriatrics]], and to hold trade shows for physicians interested in anti-aging medicine. The [[American Board of Medical Specialties]] recognizes neither anti-aging medicine nor the A4M's professional standing.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTPoison&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |first=Alex |last= Kuczynski |date=12 April 1998 |title=Anti-Aging Potion Or Poison? |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/12/style/anti-aging-potion-or-poison.html |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethics and politics of life extension==

Though a lot of scientists state&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imminst.org/cureaging/ |title=Scientists' Open Letter on Aging |publisher=Imminst.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; that life extension and radical life extension are possible there are still no an international or national programs focused on radical life extension.  There are political forces staying for and against life extension. In 2012 in Russia, and then in USA, Israel and Netherlands the Longevity political parties  started. They aimed to provide political support to radical life extension research and technologies and ensure fastest possible and at the same time soft transition society to the next step - life without aging and with radical life extension and provide such the access to such technologies to the most of the currently living people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted by Reason |url=http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2012/07/a-single-issue-political-party-for-longevity-science.php |title=A Single-Issue Political Party for Longevity Science |publisher=Fightaging.org |date= |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=&quot;Russian Ministry of Justice's list of parties in the process of registration added. #195 Life extension party&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://translate.google.com/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.minjust.ru%2Fnode%2F2162 |title=Google Translate |publisher=Translate.google.com |date= |accessdate=2012-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leon Kass]] (chairman of the US [[President's Council on Bioethics]] from 2001 to 2005) has questioned whether potential exacerbation of [[overpopulation]] problems would make life extension unethical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Simon |last=Smith |date=3 December 2002 |title=Killing Immortality |url=http://www.betterhumans.com/Features/Columns/Forward_Thinking/column.aspx?articleID=2002-12-03-4 |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20040607195722/http://www.betterhumans.com/Features/Columns/Forward_Thinking/column.aspx?articleID=2002-12-03-4 |archivedate=7 June 2004 |publisher=Betterhumans |accessdate=17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states his opposition to life extension with the words:
{{Quote|&quot;simply to covet a prolonged life span for ourselves is both a sign and a cause of our failure to open ourselves to procreation and to any higher purpose ... [The] desire to prolong youthfulness is not only a childish desire to eat one's life and keep it; it is also an expression of a childish and [[narcissistic]] wish incompatible with devotion to posterity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Leon |last=Kass |authorlink= Leon Kass |year=1985 |title=Toward a more natural science: biology and human affairs |publisher=[[Free Press (publisher)|Free Press]] |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-02-918340-3 |oclc=11677465 |page= 316}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

John Harris, former editor-in-chief of the Journal of Medical Ethics, argues that as long as life is worth living, according to the person himself, we have a powerful moral imperative to save the life and thus to develop and offer life extension therapies to those who want them.&lt;ref&gt;Harris J. Enhancing Evolution: The ethical case for making better people. Princeton University Press, New Jersey, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Transhumanist]] [[philosopher]] [[Nick Bostrom]] has argued that any technological advances in life extension must be equitably distributed and not restricted to a privileged few.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |first=John |last=Sutherland |date=9 May 2006 |title=The ideas interview: Nick Bostrom |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2006/may/09/academicexperts.genetics |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 17 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an extended metaphor entitled &quot;The Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant&quot;, Bostrom envisions death as a monstrous dragon who demands human sacrifices. In the fable, after a lengthy debate between those who believe the dragon is a fact of life and those who believe the dragon can and should be destroyed, the dragon is finally killed. Bostrom argues that political inaction allowed many preventable human deaths to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Bostrom, N |title=The fable of the dragon tyrant |journal=Journal of Medical Ethics |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=273–7 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15863685 |pmc=1734155 |doi= 10.1136/jme.2004.009035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aging as a disease==

Most mainstream medical organizations and practitioners do not consider aging to be a disease. [[David Sinclair (biologist)|David Sinclair]] says: &quot;I&amp;nbsp;don't see aging as a disease, but as a collection of quite predictable diseases caused by the deterioration of the body&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Hayden EC | year = 2007 | title = A new angle on 'old' | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 450 | issue = | pages = 603–603 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main arguments used are that aging is both inevitable and universal while diseases are not.&lt;ref&gt;Hamerman D. &quot;Geriatric Bioscience: The link between aging&amp;disease.&quot; The Johns Hopkins University Press, Maryland, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; However not everyone agrees. Harry R. Moody, Director of Academic Affairs for [[AARP]], notes that what is normal and what is disease strongly depends on a historical context.&lt;ref&gt;Moody HR. &quot;Who's afraid of life extension?&quot; Generations. 2001/2; 25:33-37.&lt;/ref&gt; David Gems, Assistant Director of the Institute of Healthy Ageing, strongly argues that aging should be viewed as a disease.&lt;ref name=Gems1&gt;{{cite journal | author = Gems D | year = 2011 | title = Aging: To Treat, or Not to Treat? The possibility of treating aging is not just an idle fantasy | url = | journal = American Scientist | volume = 99 | issue = 4| pages = 278–80 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the universality of aging, David Gems notes that it is as misleading as arguing that [[Basenji]] are not dogs because they do not bark.&lt;ref name=Gems2&gt;Gems D. &quot;Tragedy and delight: the ethics of decelerated ageing.&quot; Phil Trans R Soc B. 2011; 366:108-112.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the universality of aging he calls it a 'special sort of disease'. Robert M. Perlman, coined the terms ‘aging syndrome’ and ‘disease complex’ in 1954 to describe aging.&lt;ref&gt;Perlman RM. &quot;The aging syndrome.&quot; J Am Geriatr Soc. 1954; 2:123-129.&lt;/ref&gt;

The discussion whether aging should be viewed as a disease or not has important implications. It would stimulate pharmaceutical companies to develop life extension therapies and in the United States of America, it would also increase the regulation of the anti-aging market by the FDA. Anti-aging now falls under the regulations for cosmetic medicine which are less tight than those for drugs.&lt;ref name=Gems2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mehlman MJ, Binstock RH, Juengst ET, Ponsaran RS, Whitehouse PJ. &quot;Anti-aging medicine: can consumers be better protected? Gerontologist. 2004; 44:304-310.&lt;/ref&gt;
