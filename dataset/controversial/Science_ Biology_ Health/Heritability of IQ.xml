The study of the '''heritability of IQ''' investigates the relative importance of genetics and environment for phenotypic variation in [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) in a population. &quot;[[Heritability]]&quot;, in this sense, &quot;refers to the genetic contribution to [[variance]] within a population and in a specific environment&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;rose&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rose SP |authorlink=Steven Rose |title=Commentary: heritability estimates--long past their sell-by date |journal=Int J Epidemiol |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=525–7 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16645027 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyl064}}&lt;/ref&gt; There has been significant controversy in the academic community about the heritability of IQ ever since research began in the 19th century.&lt;ref name=devlin/&gt;

[[IQ]] is a [[Quantitative trait locus|polygenic trait]] under normal circumstances according to recent research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Comings DE, Wu S, Rostamkhani M, ''et al.'' |title=Role of the cholinergic muscarinic 2 receptor (CHRM2) gene in cognition |journal=Mol.

Estimates in the academic research of the heritability of IQ have varied from below 0.5&lt;ref name=devlin/&gt; to a high of 0.9 (of a maximum of 1.0).&lt;ref name=stable/&gt; A 1996 statement by the [[American Psychological Association]] gave about .45 for children and about .75 during and after [[adolescence]].&lt;ref name=&quot;unknown&quot;/&gt; A 2004 [[meta-analysis]] of reports in ''Current Directions in Psychological Science'' gave an overall estimate of around .85 for 18-year-olds and older.&lt;ref name=TJ&gt;{{Cite journal

== Heritability and caveats ==
{{Main|Heritability}}

&quot;Heritability&quot; is defined as the proportion of [[variance]] in a trait which is attributable to genotype within a defined population in a specific environment.&lt;ref name=&quot;rose&quot;/&gt; Heritability takes a value ranging from 0 to 1; a heritability of 1 indicates that all variation in the trait in question is genetic in origin and a heritability of 0 indicates that ''none'' of the variation is genetic. The determination of many traits can be considered primarily [[genetics|genetic]] under similar environmental backgrounds. For example, a 2006 study found that adult height has a heritability estimated at 0.80 when looking only at the height variation within families where the environment should be very similar.&lt;ref name=identity&gt;{{cite journal |author=Visscher PM, Medland SE, Ferreira MA, ''et al.'' |title=Assumption-Free Estimation of Heritability from Genome-Wide Identity-by-Descent Sharing between Full Siblings |journal=PLoS Genet. |volume=2 |issue=3 |pages=e41 |year=2006 |month=March |pmid=16565746 |pmc=1413498 |doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0020041}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other traits have lower heritabilities, which indicate a relatively larger environmental influence. For example, a [[twin study]] on the heritability of depression in men calculated it as 0.29, while it was 0.42 for women in the same study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Kendler KS, Gatz M, Gardner CO, Pedersen NL |title=A Swedish national twin study of lifetime major depression |journal=Am J Psychiatry |volume=163 |issue=1 |pages=109–14 |year=2006 |month=January |pmid=16390897 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.1.109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Caveats ===
There are a number of points to consider when interpreting heritability:
* Heritability measures the proportion of ''variation'' in a trait that can be attributed to genes, and not the proportion of a trait caused by genes. Thus, if the environment relevant to a given trait changes in a way that affects all members of the population equally, the mean value of the trait will change without any change in its heritability (because the variation or differences among individuals in the population will stay the same). This has evidently happened for height: the heritability of stature is high, but average heights continue to increase.&lt;ref name=&quot;unknown&quot;/&gt; Thus, even in developed nations, a high heritability of a trait does not necessarily mean that average group differences are due to genes.&lt;ref name=&quot;unknown&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Brooks-Gunn |first1=J. |last2=Klebanov |first2=P. K. |last3=Duncan |first3=G. J. |title=Ethnic Differences in Children's Intelligence Test Scores: Role of Economic Deprivation, Home Environment, and Maternal Characteristics |journal=Child Development |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=396–408 |year=1996 |pmid=8625720 |doi=10.2307/1131822 |jstor=1131822}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have gone further, and used height as an example in order to argue that &quot;even highly heritable traits can be strongly manipulated by the environment, so heritability has little if anything to do with controllability.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JohnsonBouchard2009&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Johnson, Wendy; Turkheimer, Eric; Gottesman, Irving I.; Bouchard Jr., Thomas | year = 2009 | title = Beyond Heritability: Twin Studies in Behavioral Research | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 217–220 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-8721.2009.01639.x | pmc = 2899491 | pmid = 20625474}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, others argue that IQ is highly stable during life and has been largely resistant to interventions aimed to change it long-term and substantially.&lt;ref&gt;Sesardic, 2005.  Making sense of heritability&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gottfredson. L. S. (2007). Flynn, Ceci, and Turkheimer on race and intelligence: Opening moves. Cato Unbound, November 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RJ2010/&gt;
* A common error is to assume that a heritability figure is necessarily unchangeable. The value of heritability can change if the impact of environment (or of genes) in the population is substantially altered.&lt;ref name=&quot;unknown&quot;/&gt; If the environmental variation encountered by different individuals increases, then the heritability figure would decrease. On the other hand, if everyone had the same environment, then heritability would be 100%. The population in developing nations often has more diverse environments than in developed nations{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}. This would mean that heritability figures would be lower in developing nations. Another example is [[phenylketonuria]] which previously caused mental retardation for everyone who had this genetic disorder and thus had a heritability of 100%. Today, this can be prevented by following a modified diet, resulting in a lowered heritability.
* A high heritability of a trait does not mean that environmental effects such as learning are not involved. Vocabulary size, for example, is very substantially heritable (and highly correlated with general intelligence) although every word in an individual's vocabulary is learned. In a society in which plenty of words are available in everyone's environment, especially for individuals who are motivated to seek them out, the number of words that individuals actually learn depends to a considerable extent on their genetic predispositions and thus heritability is high.&lt;ref name=&quot;unknown&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1037/0003-066X.51.2.77}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Since heritability increases during childhood and adolescence, and even increases greatly between 16–20 years of age and adulthood, one should be cautious drawing conclusions regarding the role of genetics and environment from studies where the participants are not followed until they are adults. Furthermore, there may be differences regarding the effects on the ''[[g factor (psychometrics)|g-factor]]'' and on non-g factors, with ''g'' possibly being harder to affect and environmental interventions disproportionately affecting non-''g'' factors.&lt;ref name=RJ2010&gt;{{cite doi|10.2174/1874350101003010009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Estimates of the heritability of IQ ==
Various studies have found the heritability of IQ to be between 0.7 and 0.8 in adults and 0.45 in childhood in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;unknown&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Plomin |first1=R. |last2=Pedersen |first2=N. L. |last3=Lichtenstein |first3=P. |last4=McClearn |first4=G. E. |title=Variability and stability in cognitive abilities are largely genetic later in life |journal=Behavior Genetics |volume=24 |issue=3 |pages=207–15 |year=1994 |pmid=7945151 |doi=10.1007/BF01067188}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bouchard |first1=T. |last2=Lykken |first2=D. |last3=McGue |first3=M |last4=Segal |first4=N. |last5=Tellegen |first5=A |title=Sources of human psychological differences: the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart |journal=Science |volume=250 |issue=4978 |pages=223–8 |year=1990 |pmid=2218526 |doi=10.1126/science.2218526|bibcode = 1990Sci...250..223B }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may seem reasonable to expect that genetic influences on traits like IQ should become less important as one gains experiences with age. However, that the opposite occurs is well documented. Heritability measures in infancy are as low as 0.2, around 0.4 in middle childhood, and as high as 0.8 in adulthood.&lt;ref name=TJ&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bouchard |first1=Thomas J. |title=Genetic Influence on Human Psychological Traits. A Survey |journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=148–51 |year=2004 |doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00295.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;R. Plomin et al.Behavioral Genetics (4th edn ed.), Worth Publishers (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; One proposed explanation is that people with different genes tend to seek out different environments that reinforce the effects of those genes.&lt;ref name=&quot;unknown&quot;/&gt;

A 1994 review in ''Behavior Genetics'' based on identical/fraternal twin studies found that heritability is as high as 0.80 in general cognitive ability but it also varies based on the trait, with .60 for verbal tests, .50 for spatial and speed-of-processing tests, and only .40 for memory tests.&lt;ref name=stable&gt;{{cite doi|10.1007/BF01067188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed about three quarters as a figure held by the majority of studies,&lt;ref name=kirp/&gt; while a 2004 [[meta-analysis]] of reports in ''Current Directions in Psychological Science'' gave an overall estimate of around .85 for 18-year-olds and older.&lt;ref name=TJ/&gt;

===Shared family environment===
{{See also|Environment and intelligence}}
There are some family effects on the IQ of children, accounting for up to a quarter of the variance. However, adoption studies show that by adulthood adoptive siblings aren't more similar in IQ than strangers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bouchard TJ |title=Genetic and environmental influences on adult intelligence and special mental abilities |journal=Hum. Biol. |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=257–79 |year=1998 |month=April |pmid=9549239}}&lt;/ref&gt;  while adult full siblings show an IQ correlation of 0.6. Conventional twin studies reinforce this pattern: [[twin|monozygotic (identical) twins]] raised separately are highly similar in IQ (0.86), more so than [[Twin|dizygotic (fraternal) twins]] raised together (0.6) and much more than adoptive siblings (~0.0).&lt;ref&gt;Plomin ''et al.'' (2001, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, some studies of twins reared apart (e.g. Bouchard, 1990) find a significant shared environmental influence, of at least 10% going into late adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sources of human psychological differences: the Minnesota Study of Twins Reared Apart|author= TJ Bouchard, Jr, DT Lykken, M McGue, NL Segal and A Tellegen|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/250/4978/223.abstract|year=1990|pmid=2218526|doi=10.1126/science.2218526|volume=250|issue=4978|pages=223–8|journal=Science|bibcode = 1990Sci...250..223B }}&lt;/ref&gt; JR Harris suggests that this might be due to biasing assumptions in the methodology of the classical twin and adoption studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harris, JR|title=No Two Alike|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are aspects of environments that family members have in common (for example, characteristics of the home). This shared family environment accounts for 0.25-0.35 of the variation in IQ in childhood. By late adolescence it is quite low (zero in some studies). There is a similar effect for several other psychological traits. These studies have not looked the effects of extreme environments such as in abusive families.&lt;ref name=&quot;unknown&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bouchard Jr |first1=TJ |title=Genetic and environmental influences on adult intelligence and special mental abilities |journal=Human biology; an international record of research |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=257–79 |year=1998 |pmid=9549239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Plomin0103&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Plomin |first1=R |last2=Asbury |first2=K |last3=Dunn |first3=J |title=Why are children in the same family so different? Nonshared environment a decade later |journal=Canadian Journal of Psychiatry |volume=46 |issue=3 |pages=225–33 |year=2001 |pmid=11320676}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Harris|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[American Psychological Association]]'s report &quot;[[Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns]]&quot; (1995) states that there is no doubt that normal [[child development]] requires a certain minimum level of responsible care. Severely deprived, neglectful, or abusive environments must have negative effects on a great many aspects of development, including intellectual aspects. Beyond that minimum, however, the role of family experience is in serious dispute. There is no doubt that such variables as resources of the home and parents' use of language are correlated with children's IQ scores, but such correlations may be mediated by genetic as well as (or instead of) environmental factors. But how much of that variance in IQ results from differences between families, as contrasted with the varying experiences of different children in the same family? Recent twin and adoption studies suggest that while the effect of the shared family environment is substantial in early childhood, it becomes quite small by late adolescence. These findings suggest that differences in the life styles of families whatever their importance may be for many aspects of children's lives make little long-term difference for the skills measured by intelligence tests.

===Non-shared family environment and environment outside the family===
Although parents treat their children differently, such differential treatment explains only a small amount of non-shared environmental influence. One suggestion is that children react differently to the same environment due to different genes. More likely influences may be the impact of peers and other experiences outside the family.&lt;ref name=&quot;unknown&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Plomin0103&quot;/&gt;

===Heritability and socioeconomic status===
The APA report &quot;Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns&quot; (1995) also stated that: &lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;We should note, however, that [[Poverty|low-income]] and non-white families are poorly represented in existing adoption studies as well as in most twin samples. Thus it is not yet clear whether these studies apply to the population as a whole. It remains possible that, across the full range of income and ethnicity, between-family differences have more lasting consequences for psychometric intelligence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lrainc.com/swtaboo/taboos/apa_01.html |title=Intelligence: Knowns and Unknowns |accessdate=August 6, 2006 |date=August 7, 1995 |author=Neisser ''et al.'' |publisher=Board of Scientific Affairs of the American Psychological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A study (1999) by Capron and Duyme of [[France|French]] children adopted between the ages of four and six examined the influence of socioeconomic status (SES). The children's IQs initially averaged 77, putting them near retardation. Most were abused or neglected as infants, then shunted from one foster home or institution to the next. Nine years later after adoption, when they were on average 14 years old, they retook the IQ tests, and all of them did better. The amount they improved was directly related to the adopting family's socioeconomic status. &quot;Children adopted by farmers and laborers had average IQ scores of 85.5; those placed with [[Middle class|middle-class]] families had average scores of 92. The average IQ scores of youngsters placed in well-to-do homes climbed more than 20 points, to 98.&quot;&lt;ref name=kirp&gt;{{Cite news

Stoolmiller (1999) argued that the range of environments in previous adoption studies were restricted. Adopting families tend to be more similar on, for example, socio-economic status than the general population, which suggests a possible underestimation of the role of the shared family environment in previous studies. Corrections for range restriction to adoption studies indicated that socio-economic status could account for as much as 50% of the variance in IQ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stoolmiller99&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stoolmiller |first1=Mike |title=Implications of the restricted range of family environments for estimates of heritability and nonshared environment in behavior-genetic adoption studies |journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=125 |issue=4 |pages=392–409 |year=1999 |pmid=10414224 |doi=10.1037/0033-2909.125.4.392}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the effect of this was examined by Matt McGue and colleagues (2007), who wrote that &quot;restriction in range in parent disinhibitory psychopathology and family socio-economic status had no effect on adoptive-sibling correlations [in] IQ&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;McGue&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McGue |first1=Matt |last2=Keyes |first2=Margaret |last3=Sharma |first3=Anu |last4=Elkins |first4=Irene |last5=Legrand |first5=Lisa |last6=Johnson |first6=Wendy |last7=Iacono |first7=William G. |title=The Environments of Adopted and Non-adopted Youth: Evidence on Range Restriction From the Sibling Interaction and Behavior Study (SIBS) |journal=Behavior Genetics |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=l449–462 |year=2007 |doi=10.1007/s10519-007-9142-7 |pmid=17279339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkheimer and colleagues (2003) argued that the proportions of IQ variance attributable to genes and environment vary with socioeconomic status. They found that in a study on seven-year-old twins, in impoverished families, 60% of the variance in early childhood IQ was accounted for by the shared family environment, and the contribution of genes is close to zero; in affluent families, the result is almost exactly the reverse.&lt;ref name = &quot;Turkheimer2003&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1046/j.0956-7976.2003.psci_1475.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Nagoshi and Johnson (2005) failed to replicate Turkheimer and colleagues' findings. They concluded that the heritability of IQ did not vary as a function of parental socioeconomic status in the 949 families of Caucasian and 400 families of Japanese ancestry who took part in the Hawaii Family Study of Cognition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nagoshi |first1=Craig T. |last2=Johnson |first2=Ronald C. |title=SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS DOES NOT MODERATE THE FAMILIALITY OF COGNITIVE ABILITIES IN THE HAWAII FAMILY STUDY OF COGNITION |journal=Journal of Biosocial Science |volume=37 |issue=6 |pages=773–81 |year=2004 |pmid=16221325 |doi=10.1017/S0021932004007023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Asbury and colleagues (2005) studied the effect of environmental risk factors on verbal and non-verbal ability in a nationally representative sample of 4-year-old British twins. There was not any statistically significant interaction for non-verbal ability, but the heritability of verbal ability was found to be ''higher'' in low-SES and high-risk environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Asbury |first1=K |last2=Wachs |first2=T |last3=Plomin |first3=R |title=Environmental moderators of genetic influence on verbal and nonverbal abilities in early childhood |journal=Intelligence |volume=33 |issue=6 |pages=643–61 |year=2005 |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2005.03.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harden and colleagues (2007) investigated adolescents, most 17 years old, and found that, among higher income families, genetic influences accounted for approximately 55% of the variance in cognitive aptitude and shared environmental influences about 35%. Among lower income families, the proportions were in the reverse direction, 39% genetic and 45% shared environment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Harden | first1 = K. Paige | last2 = Turkheimer | first2 = Eric | last3 = Loehlin | first3 = John C. | title = Genotype by Environment Interaction in Adolescents' Cognitive Aptitude | doi = 10.1007/s10519-006-9113-4 | journal = Behavior Genetics | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 273–83 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16977503 | pmc=2903846 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rushton and Jensen (2010) criticized many of these studies for being done on children or adolescents. They argued that heritability increases during childhood and adolescence, and even increases greatly between 16–20 years of age and adulthood, so one should be cautious drawing conclusions regarding the role of genetics from studies where the participants are not adults. Furthermore, the studies typically did not examine if IQ gains due to adoption were on the [[general intelligence factor]] (''g''). When the studies by Capron and Duyme were re-examined, IQ gains from being adopted into high SES homes were on non-''g'' factors. By contrast, the adopted children's ''g'' mainly depended on their biological parents SES, which implied that ''g'' is more difficult to environmentally change.&lt;ref name=RJ2010/&gt;

A 2011 study by Tucker-Drob and colleagues reported that at age 2 years, genes accounted for approximately 50% of the variation in mental ability for children being raised in high socioeconomic status families, but genes accounted for negligible variation in mental ability for children being raised in low socioeconomic status families.  This gene-environment interaction was not apparent at age 10 months, suggesting that the effect emerges over the course of early development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker-Drob2011&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tucker-Drob |first1=EM |last2=Rhemtulla |first2=M |last3=Harden |first3=KP |last4=Turkheimer |first4=E |last5=Fask |first5=D |title=Emergence of a Gene x Socioeconomic Status Interaction on Infant Mental Ability Between 10 Months and 2 Years |journal=Psychological science : a journal of the American Psychological Society / APS |year=2010 |pmid=21169524 |doi=10.1177/0956797610392926 |volume=22 |issue=1 |pages=125–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2012 study based on a representative sample of twins from the [[United Kingdom]], with longitudinal data on IQ from age two to age fourteen, did not find evidence for lower heritability in low-SES families. However, the study indicated that the effects of shared family environment on IQ were generally greater in low-SES families than in high-SES families, resulting in greater variance in IQ in low-SES families. The authors noted that previous research had produced inconsistent results on whether or not SES moderates the heritability of IQ. They suggested three explanations for the inconsistency. First, some studies may have lacked statistical power to detect interactions. Second, the age range investigated has varied between studies. Third, the effect of SES may vary in different demographics and different countries.&lt;ref&gt;Hanscombe KB, Trzaskowski M, Haworth CMA, Davis OSP, Dale PS, et al.

===Maternal (fetal) environment===

A [[meta-analysis]] by Devlin and colleagues (1997) of 212 previous studies evaluated an alternative model for environmental influence and found that it fits the data better than the 'family-environments' model commonly used. The shared maternal ([[fetal]]) environment effects, often assumed to be negligible, account for 20% of covariance between twins and 5% between siblings, and the effects of genes are correspondingly reduced, with two measures of heritability being less than 50%. They argue that the shared maternal environment may explain the striking correlation between the IQs of twins, especially those of adult twins that were reared apart.&lt;ref name=devlin&gt;{{cite journal |author=Devlin B, Daniels M, Roeder K |title=The heritability of IQ |journal=Nature |volume=388 |issue=6641 |pages=468–71 |year=1997 |month=July |pmid=9242404 |doi=10.1038/41319}}&lt;/ref&gt; IQ heritability increases during early childhood, but whether it stabilizes thereafter remains unclear. &lt;ref name=devlin&gt;{{cite journal |author=Devlin B, Daniels M, Roeder K |title=The heritability of IQ |journal=Nature |volume=388 |issue=6641 |pages=468–71 |year=1997 |month=July |pmid=9242404 |doi=10.1038/41319}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results have two implications: a new model may be required regarding the influence of genes and environment on cognitive function; and interventions aimed at improving the prenatal environment could lead to a significant boost in the population's IQ. &lt;ref name=devlin&gt;{{cite journal |author=Devlin B, Daniels M, Roeder K |title=The heritability of IQ |journal=Nature |volume=388 |issue=6641 |pages=468–71 |year=1997 |month=July |pmid=9242404 |doi=10.1038/41319}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Bouchard and McGue reviewed the literature in 2003, arguing that Devlin's conclusions about the magnitude of heritability is not substantially different than previous reports and that their conclusions regarding prenatal effects stands in contradiction to many previous reports.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12486697&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bouchard TJ, McGue M |title=Genetic and environmental influences on human psychological differences |journal=J. Neurobiol. |volume=54 |issue=1 |pages=4–45 |year=2003 |month=January |pmid=12486697 |doi=10.1002/neu.10160}}&lt;/ref&gt; They write that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Chipuer et al. and Loehlin conclude that the postnatal rather than the prenatal environment is most important. The Devlin et al. (1997a) conclusion that the prenatal environment contributes to twin IQ similarity is especially remarkable given the existence of an extensive empirical literature on prenatal effects. Price (1950), in a comprehensive review published over 50 years ago, argued that almost all MZ twin prenatal effects produced differences rather than similarities. As of 1950 the literature on the topic was so large that the entire bibliography was not published. It was finally published in 1978 with an additional 260 references. At that time Price reiterated his earlier conclusion (Price, 1978). Research subsequent to the 1978 review largely reinforces Price’s hypothesis (Bryan, 1993; Macdonald et al., 1993; Hall and Lopez-Rangel, 1996; see also Martin et al., 1997, box 2; Machin, 1996).&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12486697&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Dickens and Flynn model===

Dickens and Flynn (2001) argued that the &quot;heritability&quot; figure includes both a direct effect of the [[genotype]] on IQ and also indirect effects where the genotype changes the environment, in turn affecting IQ. That is, those with a higher IQ tend to seek out stimulating environments that further increase IQ. The direct effect can initially have been very small but [[feedback]] loops can create large differences in IQ. In their model an environmental stimulus can have a very large effect on IQ, even in adults, but this effect also decays over time unless the stimulus continues (the model could be adapted to include possible factors, like nutrition in early childhood, that may cause permanent effects). The Flynn effect can be explained by a generally more stimulating environment for all people. The authors suggest that programs aiming to increase IQ would be most likely to produce long-term IQ gains if they taught children how to replicate outside the program the kinds of cognitively demanding experiences that produce IQ gains while they are in the program and motivate them to persist in that replication long after they have left the program.&lt;ref name=&quot;DickensFlynn2001&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dickens |first1=William T. |last2=Flynn |first2=James R. |title=Heritability estimates versus large environmental effects: The IQ paradox resolved |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=346–69 |year=2001 |pmid=11381833 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.346}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=William T. |last1=Dickens |first2=James R.|last2=Flynn |url=http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20020205.pdf |title=The IQ Paradox: Still Resolved |journal=Psychological Review |volume=109 |issue=4 |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heritability of giftedness==
{{main|Intellectual giftedness}}
High intelligence is a form of intellectual giftedness. The study of giftedness, whether it has multiple forms, their heritability and their relation to each other is also a subject of major study.

==Molecular genetic investigations==

A 2009 review article identified over 50 [[genetic polymorphism]]s that have been reported to be associated with cognitive ability in various studies, but noted that the discovery of small effect sizes and lack of replication have characterized this research so far.&lt;ref name=&quot;Payton&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Payton |first=Antony |year=2009 |title=The Impact of Genetic Research on our Understanding of Normal Cognitive Ageing: 1995 to 2009|journal=Neuropsychology Review|volume=19 |pages=451–47 |doi=10.1007/s11065-009-9116-z | issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study attempted to replicate 12 reported associations between specific genetic variants and general cognitive ability in three large datasets, but found that only one of the genotypes was significantly associated with general intelligence in one of the samples, a result expected by chance alone. The authors concluded that most reported genetic associations with general intelligence are probably [[false positive]]s brought about by inadequate sample sizes. Arguing that common genetic variants explain much of the variation in general intelligence, they suggested that the effects of individual variants are so small that very large samples are required to reliably detect them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chabris&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Chabris, C.F., Hebert, B.M., Benjamin, D.J., Beauchamp, J.P., Cesarini, D., van der Loos, M.J.H.M., Johannesson, M., Magnusson, P.K.E., Lichtenstein, P., Atwood, C.S., Freese, J., Hauser, T.S., Hauser, R.M., Christakis, N.A., and Laibson, D. |year=|title=Most Reported Genetic Associations with General Intelligence Are Probably False Positives|journal=Psychological Science|volume=(in press)|pages= | issue=|url=http://coglab.wjh.harvard.edu/~cfc/Chabris2012a-FalsePositivesGenesIQ.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A novel molecular genetic method for estimating heritability calculates the overall genetic similarity (as indexed by the cumulative effects of all genotyped [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s) between all pairs of individuals in a sample of unrelated individuals and then correlates this genetic similarity with phenotypic similarity across all the pairs. A study using this method estimated that the lower bounds for the narrow-sense heritability of crystallized and fluid intelligence are 40% and 51%, respectively. A replication study in an independent sample confirmed these results, reporting a heritability estimate of 47%. These findings are compatible with the view that a large number of genes, each with only a small effect, contribute to differences in intelligence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chabris&quot;/&gt;

== Correlations between IQ and degree of genetic relatedness ==
{{content|section|date=April 2012}}{{POV-section|date=April 2012}}
The relative influence of genetics and environment for a trait can be calculated by measuring how strongly traits [[covary]] in people of a given genetic (unrelated, siblings, fraternal twins, or identical twins) and environmental (reared in the same family or not) relationship. One method is to consider [[identical twin]]s reared apart, with any similarities which exists between such twin pairs attributed to genotype. In terms of [[correlation]] statistics, this means that theoretically the correlation of tests scores between [[monozygotic]] twins would be 1.00 if genetics alone accounted for variation in IQ scores; likewise, siblings and [[dizygotic]] twins share on average half of their [[allele]]s and the correlation of their scores would be 0.50 if IQ were affected by genes alone (or greater if, as is undoubtedly the case, there is a positive correlation between the IQs of spouses in the parental generation).&lt;!--This is because if there is such a correlation, then there will be a positive correlation between the alleles in the father of the siblings for any given locus, and similarly for the mother, and therefore the difference between the siblings in the contribution of a parent will be less than otherwise. (Though this could be criticized as &quot;original research&quot;, it is true, and therefore the sentence above is only true if qualified by the parenthesis I added. If the parenthesis is removed, the whole sentence should also be removed as not really true.)--&gt; Practically, however, the [[upper bound]] of these correlations are given by the [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of the test, which is 0.90 to 0.95 for typical IQ tests&lt;ref&gt;Jensen, Arthur (1998). The g Factor: The Science of Mental Ability. Westport, Connecticut: Praeger Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is [[biological inheritance]] of IQ, then the relatives of a person with a high IQ should exhibit a comparably high IQ with a much higher probability than the general population. In 1982, Bouchard and McGue reviewed such correlations reported in 111 original studies in the United States. The mean correlation of IQ scores between monozygotic twins was 0.86, between siblings, 0.47, between half-siblings, 0.31, and between cousins, 0.15.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7195071&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bouchard TJ, McGue M |title=Familial studies of intelligence: a review |journal=Science |volume=212 |issue=4498 |pages=1055–9 |year=1981 |pmid=7195071 |doi=10.1126/science.7195071|bibcode = 1981Sci...212.1055B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2006 edition of ''Assessing adolescent and adult intelligence'' by [[Alan S. Kaufman]] and Elizabeth O. Lichtenberger reports correlations of 0.86 for identical twins raised together compared to 0.76 for those raised apart and 0.47 for siblings.&lt;ref name=&quot;KaufmanLichtenberger2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Assessing Adolescent and Adult Intelligence |last1=Kaufman |first1=Alan S. |last2=Lichtenberger |first2=Elizabeth |authorlink1=Alan S.

When comparing pre-1963 to late 1970s data, researches DeFries and Plomin found that the IQ correlation between parent and child living together fell significantly, from 0.50 to 0.35. The opposite occurred for fraternal twins.&lt;ref&gt;Plomin, R., &amp; DeFries, J. C. (1980). Genetics and intelligence: Recent data. In S. Chess &amp; A.

== Between-group heritability ==
Although IQ differences between individuals are shown to have a large hereditary component, it does not follow that mean group-level disparities (between-group differences) in IQ can be assumed to have a genetic basis. An analogy, attributed to [[Richard Lewontin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewontin | first1 = R. C. | year = 1970 | title = Race and intelligence | url = | journal = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists | volume = 26 | issue = 3| pages = 2–8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; illustrates this point:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose two handfuls are taken from a sack containing a genetically diverse variety of corn, and each grown under carefully controlled and standardized conditions, except that one batch is lacking in certain nutrients that are supplied to the other. After several weeks, the plants are measured. There is variability of growth within each batch, due to the genetic variability of the corn. Given that the growing conditions are closely controlled, nearly all the variation in the height of the plants within a batch will be due to differences in their genes. Thus, within populations, heritabilities will be very high. Nevertheless, the difference between the two groups is due entirely to an environmental factor - differential nutrition. Lewontin didn't go so far as to have the one set of pots painted white and the other set black, but you get the idea. The point of the example, in any case, is that the causes of between-group differences may in principle be quite different from the causes of within-group variation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1207/s15327906mbr2702_11 | last1 = Loehlin | first1 = John C. | author-separator =, | author-name-separator= | year = 1992 | title = On Schönemann on Guttman on Jensen, via Lewontin | url = | journal = Multivariate Behavioral Research | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 261–263 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Arthur Jensen]] has written in agreement that this is technically correct, but he has also stated that a high heritability increases the probability that genetics play a role in average group differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Jensen | first1 = A.R. | year = 1970 | title = Race and the genetics of intelligence: A reply to Lewontin | url = | journal = Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists | volume = 26 | issue = 5| pages = 17–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
