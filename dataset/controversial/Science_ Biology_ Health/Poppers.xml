'''Poppers''' is a [[slang|slang term]] for various [[alkyl nitrites]] [[inhalant|inhaled]] for recreational purposes, particularly [[isopropyl nitrite]] (2-propyl nitrite) and [[isobutyl nitrite]] (2-methylpropyl nitrite), and now more rarely, [[butyl nitrite]] and [[amyl nitrite]] (isoamyl nitrite, isopentyl nitrite).&lt;ref name=&quot;TheSite&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Poppers: The effects, the risks, the law | work=[[TheSite.org]] | publisher=YouthNet UK | url=http://www.thesite.org/drinkanddrugs/drugsafety/drugsatoz/poppers | accessdate=2007-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amyl nitrite is used medically as an [[antidote]] to [[cyanide poisoning]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Medsafe&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Amyl Nitrite | work=Medsafe | publisher=New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority | date=2000-05-18 | url=http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/Profs/datasheet/a/Amylnitrateinh.htm | accessdate=2007-03-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061111105814/http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/Profs/datasheet/a/Amylnitrateinh.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the term &quot;poppers&quot; refers specifically to recreational use.

Although, according to at least one analysis, poppers have a lower risk of harm to society and the individual than do certain other recreational drugs,&lt;ref name=&quot;Nutt-2007&quot;/&gt; other cases have shown that serious adverse effects can occur. In a letter to the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'', an ophthalmologist described four cases in which recreational users of poppers experienced temporary changes in vision.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/19/health/research/19vision.html?ref=science ''The New York Times'': &quot;Vision: A Quick High for Sex May Damage Vision&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; There is some evidence to indicate that even occasional use of poppers may affect vision.&lt;ref name=&quot;vision&quot;&gt;

In 1844, the French chemist [[Antoine Jérôme Balard]] synthesized [[amyl nitrite]]. [[Sir Thomas Lauder Brunton]] (March 14, 1844&amp;ndash;September 16, 1916), a Scottish physician, famously pioneered the use of [[amyl nitrite]] to treat [[angina pectoris]]. Brunton's clinical use of amyl nitrite to treat angina was inspired by earlier work with the same reagent by [[Arthur Gamgee]] and [[Benjamin Ward Richardson]].  Brunton reasoned that the pain and discomfort of angina could be reduced by administering amyl nitrite to dilate the coronary arteries of patients, thus improving blood flow to the heart muscle. 

In addition, the light alkyl nitrites cause the formation of [[methemoglobin]] wherein, as an effective antidote to cyanide poisoning, the methemoglobin combines with the cyanide to form nontoxic cyanmethemoglobin.&lt;ref name=&quot;MEDSAFE&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=AMYL NITRITE | publisher=[[New Zealand Medicines and Medical Devices Safety Authority]] | url=http://www.medsafe.govt.nz/profs/datasheet/a/Amylnitrateinh.htm | accessdate = 2008-03-27}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; First responders typically carry a cyanide poison kit containing amyl nitrite, such as the popular Taylor Pharmaceutical Cyanide Antidote Kit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Taylor Pharmaceutial Cyanide Antidote Kit description&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=AMYL NITRITE | publisher=Emergency Medical Products, Inc | url=http://www.buyemp.com/product/1124401.html | accessdate = 2008-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' and the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that the popper fad began among homosexual men as a way to enhance sexual pleasure, but &quot;quickly spread to avant-garde heterosexuals&quot; as a result of aggressive marketing.  A series of interviews conducted in the late 1970s revealed a wide spectrum of users, including construction workers, a &quot;trendy East Side NYC couple&quot; at a &quot;chic NYC nightclub&quot;, a Los Angeles businesswoman &quot;in the middle of a particularly hectic public-relations job&quot; (who confided to the reporter that &quot;I could really use a popper now&quot;), and frenetic disco dancers amid &quot;flashing strobe lights and the pulsating beat of music in discos across the country.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rushing to a New High |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,916269,00.html |work=Time |date=1978-07-17 |accessdate=2007-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

User surveys are hard to come by, but a 1988 study found that 69% of [[Men who have sex with men|men who had sex with men]] in the Baltimore/Washington DC area reported they had used poppers, with 21% having done so in the prior year.  The survey also found that 11% of recreational drug users in the area reported using poppers, increasing to 22% among &quot;heavy abusers,&quot; with an average age of first use of 25.6 years old.  Both survey groups used poppers to &quot;get high,&quot; but the men who had sex with men were more likely to use them during sex. It was reported that this group reduced usage following the [[AIDS]] epidemic, while the drug-users had not.&lt;ref&gt;W.R. Lange, C.A. Haertzen and J.E. Hickey et al., Nitrite inhalants patterns of abuse in Baltimore and Washington, DC, Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse 14 (1988), pp. 29–39.&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1987 study commissioned by the US Senate and conducted by the Department of Health and Human Services found that less than 3% of the overall population had ever used poppers.&lt;ref name = &quot;Kennedy-1988&quot;&gt;Kennedy, Edward, U.S. Senate, Chair Committee on Labor and Human Resources. &quot;REPORT of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources.&quot;Comprehensive Alcohol Abuse, Drug Abuse, and Mental Health Amendments of 1988. Section 4015. 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Use by minors is historically minimal due, in part, to the ban on sales to minors by major manufacturers for public relations reasons and because some jurisdictions regulate sales to minors by statute.&lt;ref&gt;Nickerson, Mark, John Parker, Thomas Lowry, and Edward Swenson.Isobutyl Nitrite and Related Compounds; chapter on &quot;Sociology and Behavioral Effects&quot; . 1st ed. San Francisco: Pharmex, Ltd, 1979.  [http://www.virusmythpoppersmyth.org/isobutyl_nitrite_and_rela/files/IBNtextnpttypepad.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; A paper published in 2005 examined use of poppers self-reported by adolescents aged 12–17 in the (American) 2000 and 2001 National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse. In all, 1.5% of the respondents in this age group reported having used poppers. This figure rose to 1.8% in those over 14. Living in nonmetropolitan areas,  having used mental health services in the past year (for purposes unconnected with substance use treatment), the presence of delinquent behaviours, past year alcohol and drug abuse and dependence, and multi-drug use were all associated with reporting the use of poppers.&lt;ref&gt;Ringwalt CL, Schlenger WE. Wu L (2005) &quot;Use of nitrite inhalants (&quot;poppers&quot;) among American youth&quot;,''Journal of Adolescent Health'' 37 (1) Jul 2005, pp.52–60.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to these low rates, a survey in the North West of England found a rate of 20% self-reported use of poppers among 16-year-olds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Drugscope&quot;/&gt;

==Effects==
Inhaling nitrites relaxes [[smooth muscle]]s throughout the body, including the [[sphincter]] muscles of the [[anus]] and the [[vagina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Medsafe&quot;/&gt; It is unclear if there is a direct effect on the brain. Smooth muscle surrounds the body's blood vessels and when relaxed causes these vessels to dilate resulting in an immediate decrease in [[blood pressure]], producing a sensation of heat and excitement that usually lasts for a couple of minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drugs.com/ppa/amyl-nitrite.html|title=?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alkyl nitrites are often used as a [[club drug]] or to enhance a sexual experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merck&quot;/&gt; The [[Orthostatic hypotension|head rush]], [[euphoria]], and other sensations that result from the increased heart rate are often felt to increase [[sexual arousal]] and desire.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merck&quot;/&gt;

The ''[[Merck Manual of Diagnosis and Therapy]]'' reports that there is little evidence of significant hazard associated with inhalation of alkyl nitrites.&lt;ref name=&quot;Merck&quot;/&gt; A study and ranking of drugs for harmfulness devised by British-government advisers and based upon scientific evidence of harm to both individuals and society showed that poppers pose little potential harm to individuals or to society when compared to other recreational drugs including alcohol and tobacco.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nutt-2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Nutt | first1 = D. | last2 = King | first2 = LA. | last3 = Saulsbury | first3 = W. | last4 = Blakemore | first4 = C. | title = Development of a rational scale to assess the harm of drugs of potential misuse. | journal = Lancet | volume = 369 | issue = 9566 | pages = 1047–53 | month = Mar | year = 2007 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(07)60464-4 | pmid = 17382831 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1983 U. S. Consumer Product Safety Commission investigation Briefing Package stated that &quot;Available injury data did not indicate a significant risk of personal injury or illness from room odorizer abuse.&quot;{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

Common side-effects of popper use include [[headaches]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Wood, Ronald W. | title=The Acute Toxicity of Nitrite Inhalants | publisher=National Institute on Drug Abuse | year=1989 | url=http://hdl.handle.net/1802/1150 | format=PDF | accessdate=2007-03-15 | pages=28–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in some cases temporary erectile problems. Other risks include [[Burn (injury)|burns]] if spilled on skin.

More rarely, acute use of poppers has been associated with [[asphyxia]], [[arrhythmias]], [[cardiovascular]] depression, [[carbon monoxide poisoning]], hepatorenal toxicity, [[mucosal]], [[pulmonary]], skin irritation and facial [[dermatitis]]. Rarely, the use of poppers can cause [[methemoglobinemia]] and [[hemolysis]]{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}, especially in individuals predisposed towards such a condition or in overdose. An overdose via ingestion (rather than inhalation) may result in [[cyanosis]], unconsciousness, coma and even death. [[Methylene blue]] is a treatment for methemoglobinemia associated with popper use.&lt;ref name=&quot;Medsafe&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dixon-1981&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dixon | first1 = DS. | last2 = Reisch | first2 = RF. | last3 = Santinga | first3 = PH. | title = Fatal methemoglobinemia resulting from ingestion of isobutyl nitrite, a &quot;room odorizer&quot; widely used for recreational purposes. | journal = J Forensic Sci | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 587–93 | month = Jul | year = 1981 | pmid = 7252472 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pruijm-2002&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Pruijm | first1 = MT. | last2 = de Meijer | first2 = PH. | title = [Methemoglobinemia due to ingestion of isobutyl nitrite ('poppers')] | journal = Ned Tijdschr Geneeskd | volume = 146 | issue = 49 | pages = 2370–3 | month = Dec | year = 2002 | pmid = 12510403 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stalnikowicz | first1 = R. | last2 = Amitai | first2 = Y. | last3 = Bentur | first3 = Y. | title = Aphrodisiac drug-induced hemolysis. | journal = J Toxicol Clin Toxicol | volume = 42 | issue = 3 | pages = 313–6 | month =  | year = 2004 | pmid = 15362601 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Emergency Medicine: Principles and Practice.

It has been suggested that poppers have been related to [[AIDS]], [[HIV]] infection, and the [[AIDS-related cancer]] [[Kaposi's sarcoma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Drumright-2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Drumright | first1 = LN. | last2 = Patterson | first2 = TL. | last3 = Strathdee | first3 = SA. | title = Club drugs as causal risk factors for HIV acquisition among men who have sex with men: a review. | journal = Subst Use Misuse | volume = 41 | issue = 10–12 | pages = 1551–601 | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1080/10826080600847894 | pmid = 17002993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Initially poppers were considered as a hypothesis for the then-burgeoning AIDS epidemic, and the idea has persisted in large part due to the activities of [[AIDS denialism|AIDS denialists]] as a [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] rationalization for the presence of AIDS in homosexual males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.aidstruth.org/denialism/myths#m2 | title = Debunking denialist myths | accessdate = 2010-08-02 | publisher = AIDStruth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Animal studies have suggested an association between alkyl nitrites and [[Kaposi's sarcoma]], a type of skin cancer associated with HIV-positive individuals,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fung-2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fung | first1 = HL. | last2 = Tran | first2 = DC. | title = Effects of inhalant nitrites on VEGF expression: a feasible link to Kaposi's sarcoma? | journal = J Neuroimmune Pharmacol | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 317–22 | month = Sep | year = 2006 | doi = 10.1007/s11481-006-9024-4 | pmid = 18040808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dunkel | first1 = VC. | last2 = Rogers-Back | first2 = AM. | last3 = Lawlor | first3 = TE. | last4 = Harbell | first4 = JW. | last5 = Cameron | first5 = TP. | title = Mutagenicity of some alkyl nitrites used as recreational drugs. | journal = Environ Mol Mutagen | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–22 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2569972 | doi = 10.1002/em.2850140207 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though a study of the use of poppers by HIV positive men did not support biological link between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chao | first1 = C. | last2 = Jacobson | first2 = LP. | last3 = Jenkins | first3 = FJ. | last4 = Tashkin | first4 = D. | last5 = Martínez-Maza | first5 = O. | last6 = Roth | first6 = MD. | last7 = Ng | first7 = L. | last8 = Margolick | first8 = JB. | last9 = Chmiel | first9 = JS. | title = Recreational Drug Use and Risk of Kaposi's Sarcoma in HIV- and HHV-8-Coinfected Homosexual Men | journal = AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–56 | month = Feb | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1089/aid.2008.0196 | pmid = 19108691 | pmc = 2981355 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead it has been suggested the correlation was based on a bias among some popper users towards high-risk sexual behaviors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Romanelli-2004&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Romanelli | first1 = F | last2 = Smith | first2 = KM | last3 = Thornton | first3 = AC | last4 = Pomeroy | first4 = C | title = Poppers: epidemiology and clinical management of inhaled nitrite abuse | journal = Pharmacotherapy | volume = 24 | issue = 1 | pages = 69–78 | month = Jan | year = 2004 | pmid = 14740789 | doi = 10.1592/phco.24.1.69.34801 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Beral | first1 = V. | last2 = Bull | first2 = D. | last3 = Darby | first3 = S. | last4 = Weller | first4 = I. | last5 = Carne | first5 = C. | last6 = Beecham | first6 = M. | last7 = Jaffe | first7 = H. | title = Risk of Kaposi's sarcoma and sexual practices associated with faecal contact in homosexual or bisexual men with AIDS | journal = Lancet | volume = 339 | issue = 8794 | pages = 632–5 | month = Mar | year = 1992 | doi =  10.1016/0140-6736(92)90793-3| pmid = 1347337 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1986–1988 series of study reviews and technical workshops with leading authorities, mandated by the US Congress, it was concluded that nitrites are not a causal factor in AIDS infection or Kaposi's sarcoma.&lt;ref name = &quot;Kennedy-1988&quot;/&gt; A study that followed 715 gay men for eight and a half years published in the ''Lancet'' in 1993 rejected any causal relationship between AIDS and poppers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Schechter | first1 = MT. | last2 = Craib | first2 = KJ. | last3 = Gelmon | first3 = KA. | last4 = Montaner | first4 = JS. | last5 = Le | first5 = TN. | last6 = O'Shaughnessy | first6 = MV. | title = HIV-1 and the aetiology of AIDS | journal = Lancet | volume = 341 | issue = 8846 | pages = 658–9 | month = Mar | year = 1993 | pmid = 8095571 | doi = 10.1016/0140-6736(93)90421-C | last7 = Schechter | first7 = M.T. | last8 = Gelmon | first8 = K.A. | last9 = Montaner | first9 = J.S.G. }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the study did conclude an association between the use of poppers in the gay culture and contracting HIV, it also concluded an association between anal sex and contracting HIV.

==Chemistry==
{{Main|Alkyl nitrites}}

Poppers are a class of chemicals called alkyl nitrites. These are [[chemical compound]]s of structure R&amp;ndash;ONO. In more formal terms, they are [[alkyl]] [[ester]]s of [[nitrous acid]].

The first few members of the series are [[Volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] [[liquid]]s; [[methyl nitrite]] and [[ethyl nitrite]] are [[gas]]eous at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|room temperature and pressure]].

[[Organic compound|Organic]] nitrites are prepared from [[alcohol]]s and [[sodium nitrite]] in [[sulfuric acid]] [[solution]]. They decompose slowly on standing, the decomposition products being [[nitrogen oxide|oxides of nitrogen]], [[water]], the alcohol, and [[polymerization]] products of the [[aldehyde]].

===Content by region===
Amyl nitrite, manufactured by Burroughs Wellcome (now [[GlaxoSmithKline]]) and [[Eli Lilly and Company]], was originally sold in small glass [[ampoule]]s that were crushed to release their vapors, and received the name &quot;poppers&quot; as a result of the popping sound made by crushing the ampoule.&lt;ref name=&quot;homohealth&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.homohealth.org/mens_program/sexualhealth/poppers.htm | title=Poppers | accessdate=2007-03-18 | publisher=Lifelong AIDS Alliance | work=homohealth.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, reformulated poppers containing [[isopropyl nitrite]] in Europe (because isobutyl is prohibited&lt;ref&gt;http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ%3AL%3A2006%3A033%3A0028%3A0081%3Aen%3APDF&lt;/ref&gt;), [[isobutyl nitrite]] in the US and [[amyl nitrite]] in Canada.

===US===
In the  US, originally marketed as a prescription drug in 1937, amyl nitrite remained so until 1960, when the [[Food and Drug Administration]] removed the prescription requirement due to its safety record. This requirement was reinstated in 1969, after observation of an increase in recreational use.

Other alkyl nitrites were outlawed in the US by Congress through the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988.  The law includes an exception for commercial purposes. The term ''commercial purpose'' is defined to mean any use other than for the production of consumer products containing volatile alkyl nitrites meant for inhaling or otherwise introducing volatile alkyl nitrites into the human body for euphoric or physical effects.&lt;ref&gt;Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988 (Public Law 1QO-690,section 2404) (15 U.S.C. 2d57a(e)(2)).&lt;/ref&gt; The law came into effect in 1990. Visits to retail outlets selling these products reveal that some manufacturers have since reformulated their products to abide by the regulations, through the use of the legal [[cyclohexyl nitrite]] as the primary ingredient in their products, which are sold as video head cleaners, polish removers, or room odorants.

===France===
In France, the sale of products containing butyl nitrites, pentyl{{citation needed|date=July 2012}} nitrites, or isomers thereof, has been prohibited since 1990 on grounds of danger to consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?dateTexte=20090901&amp;cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000166136 |title=Decree 90–274 of 26 March 1990 |language={{fr icon}} |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date=2009-05-15 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the government extended this prohibition to all alkyl nitrites that were not authorized for sale as drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichTexte.do?dateTexte=20090901&amp;cidTexte=JORFTEXT000000341445 |title=Decree 2007-1636 of 20 November 2007 |language={{fr icon}} |publisher=Legifrance.gouv.fr |date= |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; After litigation by sex shop owners, this extension was quashed by the [[Council of State (France)|Council of State]] on the grounds that the government had failed to justify such a blanket prohibition: according to the court, the risks cited, concerning rare accidents often following abnormal usage, rather justified compulsory warnings on the packaging.&lt;ref&gt;[[Council of State (France)|Council of State]], [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichJuriAdmin.do?oldAction=rechJuriAdmin&amp;idTexte=CETATEXT000020868995 Ruling 312449, 15 May 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, poppers are widely available and frequently (legally&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidsmap.com/cms1045243.aspx |title=HIV &amp; AIDS Information :: Poppers |publisher=Aidsmap.com |date=2011-08-08 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;) sold in [[Gay bar|gay clubs/bars]], [[sex shops]], drug paraphernalia [[head shops]], over the Internet and on markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/switch/surgery/advice/drink_drugs/poppers/ |title=Advice - Poppers |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is illegal under [[Medicines Act 1968]] to sell them advertised for human consumption, and in order to bypass this, they are usually sold as odorizers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sold As&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Poppers|url=http://dancesafe.org/drug-information/poppers|publisher=DanceSafe.org|accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
