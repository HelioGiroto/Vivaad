{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Human evolution''' refers to the [[evolution|evolutionary process]] leading up to the appearance of [[modern humans]]. While it began with the [[last common ancestor]] of all life, the topic usually only covers the evolutionary history of [[primate]]s, in particular the genus ''[[Homo]]'', and the emergence of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'' as a distinct species of [[hominid]]s (or &quot;great apes&quot;). The study of human evolution involves many scientific disciplines, including [[Biological anthropology|physical anthropology]], [[primatology]], [[archaeology]], [[linguistics]], [[embryology]] and [[genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Heng HH|title=The genome-centric concept: resynthesis of evolutionary theory|journal=BioEssays|volume=31|issue=5|pages=512–25|year=2009|month=May|pmid=19334004|doi=10.1002/bies.200800182}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to genetic studies, primates diverged from other mammals about {{Mya|85}} in the [[Late Cretaceous|Late]] [[Cretaceous]] period, and the earliest fossils appear in the [[Paleocene]], around {{Mya|55}}.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Nova – Meet Your Ancestors&quot;. PBS. Retrieved 2008-10-24.&lt;/ref&gt; The family Hominidae diverged from the [[Hylobatidae]] (Gibbon) family 15-20 million years ago, and around {{Mya|14}}, the [[Ponginae]] ([[orangutan]]s), diverged from the Hominidae family.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawkins R 2004&quot;&gt;Dawkins R (2004) The Ancestor's Tale.
^ &quot;Query: Hominidae/Hylobatidae&quot;. Time Tree. 2009. Retrieved December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bipedal]]ism is the basic adaption of the Hominin line, and the earliest bipedal [[Hominin]] is considered to be either ''[[Sahelanthropus]]'' or ''[[Orrorin]]'', with ''[[Ardipithecus]]'', a full bipedal, coming somewhat later. The [[gorilla]] and [[chimpanzee]] diverged around the same time, about 4-6 million years ago, and either ''Sahelanthropus'' or ''Orrorin'' may be our last shared ancestor with them. The early bipedals eventually evolved into the [[Australopithecines]] and later the genus ''[[Homo]]''.  

The earliest documented members of the genus ''Homo'' are ''[[Homo habilis]]'' which evolved around {{Mya|2.3}}. ''Homo habilis'' is the first species for which we have positive evidence of use of stone tools. The brains of these early homininas were about the same size as that of a chimpanzee.  During the next million years a process of [[encephalization]] began, and with the arrival of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' in the fossil record, cranial capacity had doubled to 850cc.&lt;ref&gt;Java Man, Curtis, Swisher and Lewin, ISBN 0-349-11473-0&lt;/ref&gt; ''Homo erectus'' and ''Homo ergaster'' were the first of the hominina to leave Africa, and these species spread through Africa, Asia, and Europe between {{Mya|1.3|1.8}}. It is believed that these species were the first to use fire and complex tools. According to the [[recent African origin of modern humans|Recent African Ancestry theory]], modern humans evolved in Africa possibly from ''[[Homo heidelbergensis]]'' and migrated out of the continent some 50,000 to 100,000 years ago, replacing local populations of ''Homo erectus'' and ''Homo neanderthalensis''.&lt;ref name=&quot;encylopediahumanevolution&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Encyclopedia of Human Evolution|author=Stringer, C.B.|chapter=Evolution of Early Humans|editors=Steve Jones, Robert Martin &amp; David Pilbeam|year=1994|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-32370-3| page=242}} Also ISBN 978-0-521-46786-5 (paperback)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;evolutionthe1st4billionyears&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Evolution: The First Four Billion Years|author=McHenry, H.M|chapter=Human Evolution|editors=Michael Ruse &amp; Joseph Travis|year=2009|publisher=The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-674-03175-3|page=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/sci;308/5724/921g|title=Out of Africa Revisited - 308 (5724): 921g - Science|doi=10.1126/science.308.5724.921g|publisher=Sciencemag.org|date=2005-05-13|accessdate=2009-11-23|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uQpZWiUP|archivedate=2010-11-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nature|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6941/full/423692a.html|title=Access: Human evolution: Out of Ethiopia|publisher=Nature|date=2003-06-12|accessdate=2009-11-23|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uQpZdYY0|archivedate=2010-11-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.actionbioscience.org/evolution/johanson.html|title=Origins of Modern Humans: Multiregional or Out of Africa?|publisher=ActionBioscience|accessdate=2009-11-23|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uQpZnojk|archivedate=2010-11-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of study==
[[File:Fossil hominids.jpg|thumb|220px|[[Fossil]] [[Hominid]] Evolution Display at [[The Museum of Osteology]], Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, USA]]

===Before Darwin===
The word ''homo'', the name of the biological genus to which humans belong, is [[Latin]] for &quot;human&quot;. It was chosen originally by [[Carl Linnaeus|Carolus Linnaeus]] in his classification system. The word &quot;human&quot; is from the Latin ''humanus'', the adjectival form of ''homo''. The Latin &quot;homo&quot; derives from the Indo-European root *''dhghem'', or &quot;earth&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DictionaryCompany2006&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=American Heritage Dictionary|author2=Houghton Mifflin Company|title=More word histories and mysteries: from aardvark to zombie|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=UbXao0TjfKgC&amp;pg=PA99|accessdate=10 November 2011|date=October 2006|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-618-71681-4|pages=99–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linnaeus and other scientists of his time also considered the [[great ape]]s to be the closest relatives of humans due to [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] and [[Anatomy|anatomical]] similarities.

===Darwin===
The possibility of linking humans with earlier apes by descent only became clear after 1859 with the publication of [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''. This argued for the idea of the evolution of new species from earlier ones. Darwin's book did not address the question of human evolution, saying only that &quot;Light will be thrown on the origin of man and his history&quot;.

The first debates about the nature of human evolution arose between [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Thomas Huxley]] and [[Richard Owen]]. Huxley argued for human evolution from apes by illustrating many of the similarities and differences between humans and apes, and did so particularly in his 1863 book ''[[Evidence as to Man's Place in Nature]]''. However, many of Darwin's early supporters (such as [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] and [[Charles Lyell]]) did not agree that the origin of the mental capacities and the moral sensibilities of humans could be explained by [[natural selection]]. Darwin applied the theory of evolution and [[sexual selection]] to humans when he published ''[[The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|The Descent of Man]]'' in 1871.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darwin|first=Charles|title=The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex|year=1871. This edition published 1981, with Introduction by John Tyler Bonner &amp; Robert M. May|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton NJ|isbn=0-691-02369-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First fossils===
A major problem at that time was the lack of fossil intermediaries. Despite the 1891 discovery by [[Eugène Dubois]] of what is now called [[Homo erectus]] at [[Trinil]], Java, it was only in the 1920s when such [[fossil]]s were discovered in Africa, that [[intermediate species]] began to accumulate. In 1925 [[Raymond Dart]] described'' [[Australopithecus africanus]]''. The [[type specimen]] was the [[Taung Child]], an Australopithecine infant which was discovered in a cave. The child's remains were a remarkably well-preserved tiny skull and an [[Endocast|endocranial cast]] of the brain. Although the brain was small (410&amp;nbsp;cm³), its shape was rounded, unlike that of chimpanzees and gorillas, and more like a modern human brain. Also, the specimen showed short [[canine tooth|canine teeth]], and the position of the [[foramen magnum]] was evidence of [[bipedal]] locomotion. All of these traits convinced Dart that the Taung baby was a bipedal human ancestor, a transitional form between apes and humans.

===The East African Fossils===
[[File:Louis Leakey.jpg|thumb|210px|Louis Leakey examining skulls from [[Olduvai Gorge]]]]
During the 1960s and 1970s hundreds of fossils were found, particularly in East Africa in the regions of the [[Olduvai gorge]] and [[Lake Turkana]]. The driving force in the east African researches was the Leakey family, with [[Louis Leakey]] and his wife [[Mary Leakey]], and later their son [[Richard Leakey|Richard]] and daughter in-law [[Meave Leakey|Meave]] being among the most successful fossil hunters and palaeoanthropologists. From the fossil beds of Olduvai and Lake Turkana they amassed fossils of Australopithecines, early Homo, and even Homo erectus. These finds cemented Africa as the cradle of human kind. In the 1980s Ethiopia emerged as the new hot spot of palaeoanthropology as [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|&quot;Lucy&quot;]], the most complete fossil member of the species [[Australopithecus afarensis]], was found by Don Johanson in [[Hadar, Ethiopia|Hadar]] in the desertic [[Middle Awash]] region of northern Ethiopia. This area would be the location of many new hominin fossils particularly those uncovered by the teams of [[Tim D. White|Tim White]] in the 1990s, such as ''[[Ardipithecus ramidus]]''.

===The Genetic revolution===
The genetic revolution in studies of human evolution started when [[Vincent Sarich]] and [[Allan Wilson]] measured the strength of immunological cross-reactions of [[blood serum]] [[albumin]] between pairs of creatures, including humans and African apes ([[chimpanzee]]s and [[gorilla]]s).&lt;ref name=MolClock&gt;{{cite pmid| 4964406}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of the reaction could be expressed numerically as an [[Immunological Distance]], which was in turn proportional to the number of [[amino acid]] differences between homologous proteins in different species. By constructing a calibration curve of the ID of species' pairs with known divergence times in the [[fossil]] record, the data could be used as a [[molecular clock]] to estimate the times of divergence of pairs with poorer or unknown fossil records.  In their seminal paper in 1967 in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', Sarich and Wilson estimated the divergence time of humans and apes as four to five million years ago,&lt;ref name=MolClock/&gt; at a time when standard interpretations of the fossil record gave this divergence as at least 10 to as much as 30 million years. Subsequent fossil discoveries, notably [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|Lucy]], and reinterpretation of older fossil materials, notably [[Ramapithecus]], showed the younger estimates to be correct and validated the albumin method. Application of the [[molecular clock]] principle revolutionized the study of [[molecular evolution]].

===The scramble for the earliest Human===
In the 1990s several teams of paleoanthropologists were working throughout Africa looking for evidence of the earliest divergence of the Hominin lineage from the great apes. In 1994 Meave Leakey discovered ''[[Australopithecus anamensis]]'', but the find was overshadowed by the news of [[Tim D. White|Tim White]]'s discovery of ''[[Ardipithecus ramidus]]'', which pushed back the fossil record to {{mya|4.2}}. In 2000 [[Martin Pickford]] and [[Brigitte Senut]] discovered a 6 million years old bipedal hominin in the [[Tugen Hills]] of Kenya, which they named [[Orrorin tugenensis]]. And in 2001 a team lead by [[Michel Brunet (paleontologist)|Michel Brunet]] discovered the skull of ''[[Sahelanthropus tchadensis]]'' which was dated as {{mya|7.2}}, and which Brunet argued was a bipedal, and therefore a hominin.

{{See also|Early human migrations|Recent African origin of modern humans|Multiregional hypothesis}}

Anthropologists in the 1980s were divided regarding some details of reproductive barriers and migratory dispersals of the ''Homo'' genus. Subsequently, genetics has been used to investigate and resolve these issues.

The [[Recent African origin of modern humans|Out-of-Africa]] model proposed that modern ''H. sapiens'' [[speciation|speciated]] in Africa recently (approx. 200,000 years ago) and their subsequent migration through Eurasia resulted in complete replacement of other ''Homo'' species. This model has been developed by [[Chris Stringer]] and Peter Andrews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/07/070718-african-origin.html|title=Modern Humans Came Out of Africa, &quot;Definitive&quot; Study Says|publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com|date=2010-10-28|accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stringer CB, Andrews P|title=Genetic and fossil evidence for the origin of modern humans|journal=Science|volume=239|issue=4845|pages=1263–8|year=1988|month=March|pmid=3125610|doi=10.1126/science.3125610|bibcode = 1988Sci...239.1263S }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In contrast, the [[Multiregional Evolution|multiregional hypothesis]] proposed that ''Homo'' genus contained only a single interconnected population like it does today (not separate species), and that its evolution took place worldwide continuously over the last couple million years. This model was proposed in 1988 by [[Milford H. Wolpoff]].&lt;ref name=&quot;multiregional&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolpoff|first=MH|coauthors=[[John D.

Out of Africa has gained support from research using female mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and the male Y chromosome. After analysing genealogy trees constructed using 133 types of mtDNA, researchers concluded that all were descended from a female African progenitor, dubbed [[Mitochondrial Eve]]. Out of Africa is also supported by the fact that mitochondrial genetic diversity is highest among African populations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cann&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cann RL, Stoneking M, Wilson AC|title=Mitochondrial DNA and human evolution|journal=Nature|volume=325|issue=6099|pages=31–6|year=1987|pmid=3025745|doi=10.1038/325031a0|url=http://artsci.wustl.edu/~landc/html/cann/|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uQpdJwWR|archivedate=2010-11-22|deadurl=no|bibcode = 1987Natur.325...31C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These new results do not contradict the Out of Africa model, except in its strictest interpretation.

A multiple dispersal model involves the Southern Dispersal theory,&lt;ref name=&quot;lahr&quot;&gt;[http://www.human-evol.cam.ac.uk/Projects/sdispersal/sdispersal.htm Searching for traces of the Southern Dispersal], by Dr. Marta Mirazón Lahr, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; which has gained support in recent years from genetic, linguistic and archaeological evidence. In this theory, there was a coastal dispersal of modern humans from the [[Horn of Africa]] around 70,000 years ago. This group helped to populate Southeast Asia and Oceania, explaining the discovery of early human sites in these areas much earlier than those in the [[Levant]]. A second wave of humans dispersed across the [[Sinai peninsula]] into Asia, resulting in the bulk of human population for [[Eurasia]]. This second group possessed a more sophisticated tool technology and was less dependent on coastal food sources than the original group. Much of the evidence for the first group's expansion would have been destroyed by the rising sea levels at the end of each [[glacial maximum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lahr&quot;/&gt; The multiple dispersal model is contradicted by studies indicating that the populations of Eurasia and the populations of Southeast Asia and Oceania are all descended from the same mitochondrial DNA lineages, which support a single migration out of Africa that gave rise to all non-African populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Single, Rapid Coastal Settlement of Asia Revealed by Analysis of Complete Mitochondrial Genomes|year=2005|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/308/5724/1034|doi=10.1126/science.1109792|author=Macaulay, V.|journal=Science|volume=308|page=1034|pmid=15890885|last2=Hill|first2=C|last3=Achilli|first3=A|last4=Rengo|first4=C|last5=Clarke|first5=D|last6=Meehan|first6=W|last7=Blackburn|first7=J|last8=Semino|first8=O|last9=Scozzari|first9=R|issue=5724|pages=1034–6|bibcode = 2005Sci...308.1034M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anatomical changes==
[[File:Ape skeletons.png|500px|right|thumbnail|The [[Ape|hominoids]] are descendants of a [[common descent|common ancestor]].]]

Human evolution is characterized by a number of [[morphology (biology)|morphological]], [[human development (biology)|developmental]], [[human physiology|physiological]], and [[Human behavior|behavioral]] changes that have taken place since the split between the [[chimpanzee-human last common ancestor|last common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees]]. The most significant of these adaptations are 1. bipedalism, 2. increased brain size, 3. lengthened [[ontogeny]] (gestation and infancy), 4. decreased [[sexual dimorphism]]. The relationship between all these changes is the subject of ongoing debate.&lt;ref name=Boyd2003&gt;{{cite book |author=Boyd, Robert; Silk, Joan B. |year=2003 |title=How Humans Evolved |location=New York, New York |publisher=Norton |isbn=0-393-97854-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other significant morphological changes included the evolution of a [[Thumb#Grips|power and precision grip]], a change first occurring ''H. erectus''.&lt;ref name=Brues1965&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brues, Alice M.; Snow, Clyde C. |title=Physical Anthropology |journal=Biennial Review of Anthropology |year=1965 |volume=4 |pages=1–39 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=9WemAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bipedalism===

{{refimprove|date=July 2012}}
[[Bipedal]]ism is the basic adaption of the ''Hominin'' line and is considered the main cause behind a suite of [[Human skeletal changes due to bipedalism|skeletal changes]] shared by all bipedal hominins. The earliest bipedal [[Hominini|Hominin]] is considered to be either ''[[Sahelanthropus]]''&lt;ref name=Brunet2002&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brunet, M.; Guy, F.; Pilbeam, D.; Mackaye, H.; Likius, A.; Ahounta, D.; Beauvilain, A.; Blondel, C.; Bocherens, H.; Boisserie, J.; De Bonis, L.; Coppens, Y.; Dejax, J.; Denys, C.; Duringer, P.; Eisenmann, V.; Fanone, G.; Fronty, P.; Geraads, D.; Lehmann, T.; Lihoreau, F.; Louchart, A.; Mahamat, A.; Merceron, G.; Mouchelin, G.; Otero, O.; Pelaez Campomanes, P.; Ponce De Leon, M.; Rage, J.; Sapanet, M.; Schuster, M.; Sudre, J.; Tassy, P.; Valentin, X.; Vignaud, P.; Viriot, L.; Zazzo, A.; Zollikofer, C. |title=A new hominid from the Upper Miocene of Chad, Central Africa |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v418/n6894/full/nature00879.html |journal=Nature |volume=418 |issue=6894 |pages=145–151 |year=2002 |pmid=12110880 |doi=10.1038/nature00879}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Orrorin]]'', with [[Ardipithecus]], a full bipedal, coming somewhat later. The knuckle walkers, the [[gorilla]] and [[chimpanzee]], diverged around the same time, and either Sahelanthropus or Orrorin may be our last shared ancestor. The early bipedals eventually evolved into the ''[[Australopithecines]]'' and later the genus ''[[Homo]]''. There are several theories of the adaptation value of bipedalism. It is possible that bipedalism was favored because it freed up the hands for reaching and carrying food, saved energy during locomotion, enabled long distance running and hunting, or helped avoid hyperthermia by reducing the surface area exposed to direct sun. 

Anatomically the evolution of bipedalism has been accompanied by a [[Human skeletal changes due to bipedalism|large number of skeletal changes]], not just to the legs and pelvis, but also to the [[Human vertebral column|vertebral column]], feet and ankles, and skull. Perhaps the most significant changes are in the pelvic region, where the long downwards facing [[ilium (bone)|iliac blade]] was shortened and became wide as a requirement for keeping the center of gravity stable while walking. The shortening and narrowing of the pelvis evolved as a requirement for bipedality and had significant effects on the process of human birth which is much more difficult in modern humans than in other primates. The [[femur]] evolved into a slightly more angular position to move the center of gravity towards the geometric center of the body. The knee and ankle joints became increasingly robust to better support increased weight. Also in order to support the increased weight on each vertebra in the upright position the human vertebral column became S-shaped and the [[lumbar vertebrae]] became shorter and wider. In the feet the big toe moved into alignment with the other toes to help in forward locomotion. The arms and forearms shortened relative to the legs making it easier to run.  The foramen magnum migrated under the skull and more anterior.

===Encephalization===
The human species developed a much larger brain than that of other primates – typically 1,330 [[cubic centimetres|cc]] in modern humans, over twice the size of that of a chimpanzee or gorilla.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schoeneman&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Evolution of the Size and Functional Areas of the Human Brain|author= P. Thomas Schoenemann|journal=Annu. Rev. Anthropol|year= 2006|volume=35|pages=379–406}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pattern of [[encephalization]] started with ''Homo habilis'' which at approximately 600 cc had a brain slightly larger than chimpanzees, and continued with ''Homo erectus'' (800-1100 cc), and reached a maximum in Neanderthals with an average size of (1200-1900cc), larger even than ''Homo sapiens''. The pattern of human postnatal [[neural development|brain growth]] differs from that of other apes ([[heterochrony]]), and allows for extended periods of [[Observational learning|social learning]] and [[language acquisition]] in juvenile humans. However, the differences between the structure of [[human brain]]s and those of other apes may be even more significant than differences in size.&lt;ref name=Park2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Park, Min S.; Nguyen, Andrew D.; Aryan, Henry E.; U, Hoi Sang; Levy, Michael L.; Semendeferi, Katerina |title=Evolution of the human brain: changing brain size and the fossil record |journal=Neurosurgery |year=2007 |volume=60 |issue=3 |pages=555–562 |pmid=17327801 |doi= 10.1227/01.NEU.0000249284.54137.32}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bruner2007&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bruner, Emiliano |title=Cranial shape and size variation in human evolution: structural and functional perspectives |journal=Child's Nervous System |year=2007 |volume=23 |issue=12 |pages=1357–1365 |pmid=17680251 |url=http://www.emilianobruner.it/pdf/Bruner2007_CNS.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1007/s00381-007-0434-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Potts, Richard. 2012.

===Sexual dimorphism===
The reduced degree of sexual dimorphism is primarily visible in the a reduction of the male [[canine tooth]] relative to other ape species (except [[gibbon]]s), but also reduced brow ridges and general robustness of males. Another important physiological change related to sexuality in humans was the evolution of [[hidden estrus]]. Humans are the only ape in which the female is fertile year round, and in which no special signals of fertility are produced by the body (such as [[genital swelling]] during estrus). Nonetheless humans retain a degree of sexual dimorphism in the distribution of body hair and subcutaneous fat, and in the overall size, males being around 25% larger than females. These changes taken together have been interpreted as a result of an increased emphasis on [[pair bonding]] as a possible solution to the requirement for increased parental investment due to the prolonged infancy of offspring.

===Other changes===
A number of other changes have also characterized the evolution of humans, among them an increased importance on vision rather than smell; a smaller gut; loss of body hair; evolution of sweat glands; a change in the shape of the dental arcade from being u-shaped to being parabolic; development of a chin (only found in ''Homo sapiens''), development of [[Temporal styloid process|styloid process]]es; development of a [[Larynx#Descended_larynx|descended larynx]].

==Evidence==
The evidence on which scientific accounts of human evolution is based comes from many fields of [[natural science]]. The main sources of knowledge about the evolutionary process has traditionally been the [[fossil]] record, but since the development of [[genetics]] beginning in the 1970s DNA analyses has come to occupy a place of comparable importance. The studies of [[ontogeny]], [[phylogeny]] and especially [[evolutionary developmental biology]] of both vertebrates and invertebrates offer considerable insight into the evolution of all life, including how humans evolved.  The specific study of the origin and life of humans is [[anthropology]], particularly [[paleoanthropology]] which focuses on the study of human prehistory.&lt;ref&gt;Stanford, Craig, John S. Allen, and Susan C. Anton (Author) 2012. Biological Anthropology (2nd Edition). Prentice Hall. ISBN 0136011608 ch. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 41&lt;/ref&gt; By using the technique called the [[molecular clock]] which estimates the time required for the number of divergent mutations to accumulate between two lineages, the approximate date for the split between lineages can be calculated. The gibbons (''[[hylobatidae]]'') and [[orangutan]]s ( genus ''Pongo'') were the first groups to split from the [[lineage (evolution)|line]] leading to the humans, then [[gorilla]]s followed by the [[chimpanzee]]s and [[bonobo]]s. The splitting date between human and chimpanzee lineages is placed around 4-8 million years ago during the late [[Miocene]] epoch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawkins R 2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ruvolo, M. 1997.

By comparing the parts of the genome that are not under natural selection and which therefore accumulate mutations at a fairly steady rate, it is possible to reconstruct a genetic tree incorporating the entire human species since the last shared ancestor. Each time a certain mutation ([[Single nucleotide polymorphism]]) appears in an individual and is passed on to his or her descendants a [[haplogroup]] is formed including all of the descendants of the individual who will also carry that mutation. By comparing [[mtDNA|mitochondrial DNA]] which is inherited only from the mother, geneticists have concluded that the last female common ancestor whose genetic marker is found in all modern humans, the so-called [[mitochondrial Eve]], must have lived around 200,000 years ago.

====Genetics====
{{Main|Human evolutionary genetics|Human genetic variation}}
Human evolutionary genetics studies how one [[human genome]] differs from the other, the evolutionary past that gave rise to it, and its current effects. Differences between genomes have [[anthropological]], [[medical]] and [[forensic]] implications and applications. Genetic data can provide important insight into human evolution.

===Evidence from the fossil record===
[[File:Homo habilis-KNM ER 1813.jpg|thumb|Replica of fossil skull of ''[[Homo habilis]]''.  Fossil number KNM ER 1813, found at [[Koobi Fora]], Kenya. ]]
[[File:Homo ergaster.jpg|thumb|Replica of fossil skull of ''[[Homo ergaster]]'' (African ''Homo erectus''). Fossil number Khm-Heu 3733 discovered in 1975 in Kenya.]]
There is little fossil evidence for the divergence of the gorilla, chimpanzee and hominin lineages.&lt;ref&gt;Begun, David R. 2010. Miocene Hominids and the Origins of the African Apes and Humans. Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 39: 67 -84&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest fossils that have been proposed as members of the hominin lineage are ''[[Sahelanthropus tchadensis]]'' dating from {{mya|7}}, and ''[[Orrorin tugenensis]]'' dating from {{mya|5.7}} and ''[[Ardipithecus kadabba]]'' dating to {{mya|5.6}}. Each of these have been argued to be a [[bipedal]] ancestor of later hominins, but in each cases the claims have been contested. It is also possible that either of these species are ancestors of another branch of African apes, or that they represent a shared ancestor between hominins and other apes. The question of the relation between these early fossil species and the hominin lineage is still to be resolved. From these early species the [[Australopithecines]] arose around {{mya|4}} diverged into  [[Robust australopithecines|robust]] (also called [[Paranthropus]]) and [[gracile australopithecines|gracile]] branches, one of which (possibly ''[[Australopithecus garhi|A. garhi]]'') probably went on to become ancestors of the genus ''Homo''. The australopithecine species that are best represented in the fossil record is [[Australopithecus Afarensis]] with more than a hundred fossil individuals represented, found from Northern Ethiopia (such as the famous [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|&quot;Lucy&quot;]]), to Kenya, and South Africa. Fossils of robust australopithecines such as ''A. robustus'' (or alternatively ''Paranthropus robustus'') and ''A./P. boisei'' are particularly abundant in South Africa at sites such as [[Kromdraai]] and [[Swartkrans]], and around [[Lake Turkana]] in Kenya.

The earliest members of the genus ''Homo'' are ''[[Homo habilis]]'' which evolved around {{Mya|2.3}}. ''Homo habilis'' is the first species for which we have positive evidence of use of [[stone tools]]. They developed the [[oldowan]] lithic technology, named after the [[Olduvai gorge]] where the first specimens were found. Some scientists consider [[Homo rudolfensis]], a group larger bodied group of fossils with similar morphology to the original ''H. habilis'' fossils to be a separate species while others consider them to be part of ''H. habilis'' - simply representing species internal variation, or perhaps even [[sexual dimorphism]]. The brains of these early hominins were about the same size as that of a chimpanzee, and their main adaptation was bipedalism as an adaptation to terrestrial living.  

During the next million years a process of [[encephalization]] began, and with the arrival of ''[[Homo erectus]]'' in the fossil record, cranial capacity had doubled. ''Homo erectus'' were the first of the hominina to leave Africa, and these species spread through Africa, Asia, and Europe between {{Mya|1.3|1.8}}. One population of ''H. erectus'', also sometimes classified as a separate species [[Homo ergaster]], stayed in Africa and evolved into ''Homo sapiens''. It is believed that these species were the first to use fire and complex tools. The earliest transitional fossils between ''H. ergaster/erectus'' and '' [[Archaic Homo sapiens|Archaic H. sapiens]]'' are from Africa such as ''[[Homo rhodesiensis]]'', but seemingly transitional forms are also found at [[Dmanisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. These descendants of African ''H. erectus'' spread through Eurasia from ca. 500,000 years ago evolving into ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'', ''[[Homo heidelbergensis|H. heidelbergensis]]'' and ''[[Homo neanderthalensis|H. neanderthalensis]]''.  The earliest fossils of [[anatomically modern humans]] are from the [[Middle Paleolithic]], about 200,000 years ago such as the [[Omo remains]] of Ethiopia, later fossils from [[Skhul]] in Israel and Southern Europe begin around 90,000 years ago.

As modern humans spread out from Africa they encountered other hominins such as ''[[Neanderthal|Homo neanderthalensis]]'' and the so-called [[Denisovans]], who may have evolved from populations of ''Homo erectus'' that had left Africa already around {{mya|2}}. The nature of interaction between early humans and these sister species has been a long standing source of controversy, the question being whether humans replaced these earlier species or whether they were in fact similar enough to interbreed, in which case these earlier populations may have contributed genetic material to modern humans.&lt;ref name=Grine2009&gt;{{cite book |author=Wood, Bernard A. |editor-last=Grine, Frederick E.; Fleagle, John G.; Leakey, Richard E.

This migration [[Recent African origin of modern humans|out of Africa]] is estimated to have begun about 70,000 years BP and modern humans subsequently spread globally, replacing earlier hominins either through competition or hybridization.

In the early [[Miocene]], about 22 million years ago, the many kinds of arboreally adapted primitive catarrhines from East Africa suggest a long history of prior diversification. Fossils at 20 million years ago include fragments attributed to ''[[Victoriapithecus]]'', the earliest Old World Monkey. Among the genera thought to be in the ape lineage leading up to 13 million years ago are ''[[Proconsul (genus)|Proconsul]]'', ''[[Rangwapithecus]]'', ''[[Dendropithecus]]'', ''[[Limnopithecus]]'', ''[[Nacholapithecus]]'', ''[[Equatorius]]'', ''[[Nyanzapithecus]]'', ''[[Afropithecus]]'', ''[[Heliopithecus]]'', and ''[[Kenyapithecus]]'', all from East Africa. The presence of other generalized non-cercopithecids of middle Miocene age from sites far distant—''[[Otavipithecus]]'' from cave deposits in Namibia, and ''[[Pierolapithecus]]'' and ''[[Dryopithecus]]'' from France, Spain and Austria—is evidence of a wide diversity of forms across Africa and the Mediterranean basin during the relatively warm and equable climatic regimes of the early and middle Miocene. The youngest of the Miocene hominoids, ''[[Oreopithecus]]'', is from coal beds in Italy that have been dated to 9 million years ago.

Molecular evidence indicates that the lineage of [[gibbon]]s (family [[Hylobatidae]]) diverged from Great Apes some 18-12 million years ago, and that of [[orangutan]]s (subfamily Ponginae) diverged from the other Great Apes at about 12 million years; there are no fossils that clearly document the ancestry of gibbons, which may have originated in a so-far-unknown South East Asian hominoid population, but fossil proto-orangutans may be represented by ''[[Sivapithecus]]'' from India and ''[[Griphopithecus]]'' from Turkey, dated to around 10 million years ago.&lt;ref name=&quot;Srivastava2009&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Srivastava|title=Morphology Of The Primates And Human Evolution|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=kCerOsM8XMwC&amp;pg=PA87|accessdate=6 November 2011|year=2009|publisher=PHI Learning Pvt.

===Divergence of the human clade from other Great Apes===
[[File:Lucy-reconstruction.jpg|thumb|190px|A reconstruction of a female ''Australopithecus afarensis'']]
Species close to the last common ancestor of gorillas, chimpanzees and humans may be represented by ''[[Nakalipithecus]]'' fossils found in Kenya and ''[[Ouranopithecus]]'' found in Greece. Molecular evidence suggests that between 8 and 4 million years ago, first the [[gorilla]]s, and then the chimpanzees (genus ''Pan'') split off from the line leading to the humans; human DNA is approximately 98.4% identical to that of chimpanzees when comparing single nucleotide polymorphisms (see [[human evolutionary genetics]]). The fossil record of gorillas and chimpanzees is limited. Both poor preservation (rain forest soils tend to be acidic and dissolve bone) and [[sampling bias]] probably contribute to this problem. Other [[Homininae|hominins]] likely adapted to the drier environments outside the equatorial belt, along with antelopes, hyenas, dogs, pigs, elephants, and horses. The equatorial belt contracted after about 8 million years ago. There is very little fossil evidence for the split of the hominin lineage from the lineages of gorillas and chimpanzees. The earliest fossils that have been argued to belong to the human lineage are  ''[[Sahelanthropus tchadensis]]'' (7 Ma) and ''[[Orrorin tugenensis]]'' (6 Ma), followed by ''[[Ardipithecus]]'' (5.5–4.4 Ma), with species ''[[Ardipithecus kadabba|Ar. kadabba]]'' and ''[[Ardipithecus ramidus|Ar. ramidus]]'';

===Genus ''Australopithecus''===
The ''[[Australopithecus]]'' genus evolved in eastern Africa around 4 million years ago before spreading throughout the continent and eventually becoming extinct 2 million years ago. During this time period various forms of australopiths existed, including ''[[Australopithecus anamensis]]'', ''[[Australopithecus afarensis|A. afarensis]]'', ''[[Australopithecus sediba|A. sediba]]'', and ''[[Australopithecus africanus|A. africanus]]''. There is still some debate amongst academics whether certain African hominid species of this time, such as ''[[Australopithecus robustus|A. robustus]]'' and ''[[Australopithecus boisei|A. boisei]]'', constitute members of the same genus; if so, they would be considered to be ''robust australopiths'' whilst the others would be considered ''gracile australopiths''. However, if these species do indeed constitute their own genus, then they may be given their own name, the ''[[Paranthropus]]''.
*''[[Australopithecus]]'' (4–1.8 Ma), with species ''[[Australopithecus anamensis|Au. anamensis]]'', ''[[Australopithecus afarensis|Au. afarensis]]'', ''[[Australopithecus africanus|Au. africanus]]'', ''[[Australopithecus bahrelghazali|Au. bahrelghazali]]'', ''[[Australopithecus garhi|Au. garhi]]'', and ''[[Australopithecus sediba|Au. sediba]]'';
*''[[Kenyanthropus]]'' (3–2.7 Ma), with species ''[[Kenyanthropus platyops]]'';
*''[[Paranthropus]]'' (3–1.2 Ma), with species ''[[Paranthropus aethiopicus|P. aethiopicus]]'', ''[[Paranthropus boisei|P. boisei]]'', and ''[[Paranthropus robustus|P. robustus]]'';

===''H. habilis'' and ''H. gautengensis''===
''[[Homo habilis]]'' lived from about 2.4 to 1.4 [[Megaannum#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]. ''Homo habilis'' evolved in South and East Africa in the late [[Pliocene]] or early [[Pleistocene]], 2.5–2 Ma, when it diverged from the Australopithecines. ''Homo habilis'' had smaller molars and larger brains than the Australopithecines, and made tools from stone and perhaps animal bones. One of the first known hominids, it was nicknamed 'handy man' by discoverer [[Louis Leakey]] due to its association with [[stone tools]]. Some scientists have proposed moving this species out of ''Homo'' and into ''Australopithecus'' due to the morphology of its skeleton being more adapted to [[arboreal|living on trees]] rather than to [[bipedalism|moving on two legs]] like ''Homo sapiens''.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, B. &amp; Collard, M. (1999) The changing face of Genus Homo. Evol. Anth. 8(6) 195-207&lt;/ref&gt;

It was considered to be the first species of the genus ''Homo'' until May 2010, when a new species, ''[[Homo gautengensis]]'' was discovered in South Africa, that most likely arose earlier than ''Homo habilis''.&lt;ref name=&quot;toothy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/human/human-ancestor-tree-swinger.html|title=Toothy Tree-Swinger May Be Earliest Human|publisher=News.discovery.com|date=2010-05-21|accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''H. rudolfensis'' and ''H. georgicus''===
These are proposed species names for fossils from about 1.9–1.6 Ma, whose relation to ''Homo habilis'' is not yet clear.

Dubois' Description of Remains recently found in Java, named by him Pithecanthropus erectus: With Remarks on so-called Transitional Forms between Apes and Man|journal=Journal of anatomy and physiology|volume=29|issue=Pt 3|pages=424–45|year=1895|pmid=17232143|pmc=1328414}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Homo erectus]]'' (H erectus) lived from about 1.8 Ma to about 70,000 years ago (which would indicate that they were probably wiped out by the [[Toba catastrophe theory|Toba catastrophe]]; however, ''[[Homo erectus soloensis]]'' and ''[[Homo floresiensis]]'' survived it). Often the early phase, from 1.8 to 1.25 Ma, is considered to be a separate species, ''[[Homo ergaster]]'', or it is seen as a subspecies of ''Homo erectus'', ''[[Homo ergaster|Homo erectus ergaster]]''.

In the early Pleistocene, 1.5–1 Ma, in Africa some populations of ''Homo habilis'' are thought to have evolved larger brains and made more elaborate stone tools; these differences and others are sufficient for anthropologists to classify them as a new species, ''Homo erectus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Spoor F, Wood B, Zonneveld F|title=Implications of early hominid labyrinthine morphology for evolution of human bipedal locomotion|journal=Nature|volume=369|issue=6482|pages=645–8|year=1994|pmid=8208290|doi=10.1038/369645a0|bibcode = 1994Natur.369..645S }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was made possible by the evolution of locking knees and a different location of the [[foramen magnum]] (the hole in the skull where the spine enters). They may have used fire to cook their meat.

A famous example of ''Homo erectus'' is [[Peking Man]]; others were found in Asia (notably in Indonesia), Africa, and Europe. Many paleoanthropologists now use the term ''Homo ergaster'' for the non-Asian forms of this group, and reserve ''Homo erectus'' only for those fossils that are found in Asia and meet certain skeletal and dental requirements which differ slightly from ''H. ergaster''.

===''H. floresiensis''===

{{Main|Homo floresiensis}}
''H. floresiensis'', which lived from approximately 100,000 to 12,000 before present, has been nicknamed ''[[hobbit]]'' for its small size, possibly a result of [[insular dwarfism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Brown P, Sutikna T, Morwood MJ, ''et al.''|title=A new small-bodied hominin from the Late Pleistocene of Flores, Indonesia|journal=Nature|volume=431|issue=7012|pages=1055–61|year=2004|pmid=15514638|doi=10.1038/nature02999|bibcode = 2004Natur.431.1055B }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''H. floresiensis'' is intriguing both for its size and its age, being an example of a recent species of the genus ''Homo'' that exhibits derived traits not shared with modern humans. In other words, ''H. floresiensis'' shares a common ancestor with modern humans, but split from the modern human lineage and followed a distinct evolutionary path. The main find was a skeleton believed to be a woman of about 30 years of age. Found in 2003 it has been dated to approximately 18,000 years old. The living woman was estimated to be one meter in height, with a brain volume of just 380&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (considered small for a chimpanzee and less than a third of the ''H. sapiens'' average of 1400&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

However, there is an ongoing debate over whether ''H. floresiensis'' is indeed a separate species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Argue D, Donlon D, Groves C, Wright R|title=Homo floresiensis: microcephalic, pygmoid, Australopithecus, or Homo?|journal=J.

This, coupled with pathological dwarfism, could possibly create a hobbit-like human. The other major attack on ''H. floresiensis'' is that it was found with tools only associated with ''H. sapiens''.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;

The hypothesis of pathological dwarfism, however, fails to explain [[Homo floresiensis#Additional features|additional anatomical features]] that are unlike those of modern humans (diseased or not) but much like those of ancient members of our genus. Aside from cranial features, these features include the form of bones in the wrist, forearm, shoulder, knees, and feet. Additionally, this hypothesis fails to explain the find of multiple examples of individuals with these same characteristics, indicating they were common to a large population, and not limited to one individual.

===''H. sapiens''===

{{Main|Archaic Homo sapiens}}
''H. sapiens'' (the adjective ''[[wikt:sapiens|sapiens]]'' is Latin for &quot;wise&quot; or &quot;intelligent&quot;) have lived from about 250,000 years ago to the present. Between 400,000 years ago and the second interglacial period in the Middle [[Pleistocene]], around 250,000 years ago, the trend in [[Cranial capacity|skull expansion]] and the elaboration of stone tool technologies developed, providing evidence for a transition from ''H. erectus'' to ''H. sapiens''. The direct evidence suggests there was a migration of ''H. erectus'' out of Africa, then a further [[speciation]] of ''H. sapiens'' from ''H. erectus'' in Africa. A subsequent migration within and out of Africa eventually replaced the earlier dispersed ''H. erectus''. This migration and origin theory is usually referred to as the ''recent single origin'' or [[Recent African origin of modern humans|Out of Africa theory]]. Current evidence does not preclude some multiregional evolution or some admixture of the migrant ''H. sapiens'' with existing ''Homo'' populations. This is a hotly debated area of [[paleoanthropology]].

Current research has established that humans are genetically highly homogenous; that is, the DNA of individuals is more alike than usual for most species, which may have resulted from their relatively recent evolution or the possibility of a [[population bottleneck]] resulting from cataclysmic natural events such as the [[Toba catastrophe theory|Toba catastrophe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/horizon/1999/supervolcanoes_script.shtml Supervolcanoes], [[BBC2]], 3 February 2000&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ambrose1998&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Stanley H.

These adapted traits are a very small component of the ''Homo sapiens'' genome, but include various characteristics such as skin color and nose form, in addition to internal characteristics such as the ability to breathe more efficiently at high altitudes.

{{See also|Hunting hypothesis}}
The use of tools has been interpreted as a sign of intelligence, and it has been theorized that tool use may have stimulated certain aspects of human evolution, especially the continued expansion of the human brain. Paleontology has yet to explain the expansion of this organ over millions of years despite being extremely demanding in terms of energy consumption. The brain of a modern human consumes about 20 [[watt]]s (400 kilocalories per day), a fifth of body's total energy consumption.{{citation needed|date=December 2011|reason=It's not mentioned in the &quot;Solving the Brain's Energy Crisis&quot; citation}} Increased tool use would allow hunting for energy-rich meat products, and would enable processing more energy-rich plant products. Researchers have suggested that early hominids were thus under evolutionary pressure to increase their capacity to create and use tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gibbons, Ann|title=Solving the Brain's Energy Crisis|journal=Science|volume=280|issue=5368|pages=1345–47|year=1998|pmid=9634409|doi=10.1126/science.280.5368.1345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Precisely when early humans started to use tools is difficult to determine, because the more primitive these tools are (for example, sharp-edged stones) the more difficult it is to decide whether they are natural objects or human artifacts. There is some evidence that the australopithecines (4 Ma) may have used broken bones as tools, but this is debated.&lt;ref name=&quot;HowellBourlière2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author1=F. Howell|author2=François Bourlière|title=African Ecology and Human Evolution|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=-kOvkb-xbU8C&amp;pg=PA398|accessdate=6 November 2011|date=30 November 2007|publisher=Transaction Publishers|isbn=978-0-202-36136-9|page=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It should be noted that many species make and use tools, but it is the human genus that dominates the areas of making and using more complex tools. The oldest known tools are the &quot;Oldowan stone tools&quot; from Ethiopia, 2.5-2.6 million years old, which predates the earliest known &quot;Homo&quot; species. There is no known evidence that any &quot;Homo&quot; specimens appeared by 2.5 Ma. A Homo fossil was found near some Oldowan tools, and its age was noted at 2.3 million years old, suggesting that maybe the Homo species did indeed create and use these tools. It is a possibility but does not yet represent solid evidence. Bernard Wood noted that &quot;Paranthropus&quot; co-existed with the early Homo species in the area of the &quot;Oldowan Industrial Complex&quot; over roughly the same span of time. Although there is no direct evidence which identifies Paranthropus as the tool makers, their anatomy lends to indirect evidence of their capabilities in this area. Most paleoanthropologists agree that the early &quot;Homo&quot; species were indeed responsible for most of the Oldowan tools found. They argue that when most of the Oldowan tools were found in association with human fossils, Homo was always present, but Paranthropus was not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Freeman&quot;&gt;Freeman, Scott; Jon C. Herron. ''Evolutionary Analysis'' (4th ed.)., Pearson Education, Inc. (2007). ISBN 978-0-13-227584-2 pp. 786-788&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 Randall Susman used the anatomy of opposable thumbs as the basis for his argument that both the Homo and Paranthropus species were toolmakers. He compared bones and muscles of human and chimpanzee thumbs, finding that humans have 3 muscles which are lacking in chimpanzees. Humans also have thicker metacarpals with broader heads, allowing more precise grasping than the chimpanzee hand can perform. Susman posited that modern anatomy of the human thumb is an evolutionary response to the requirements associated with making and handling tools and that both species were indeed toolmakers.&lt;ref name=Freeman/&gt;

Anthropol.|volume=Suppl 39|pages=118–64|year=2004|pmid=15605391|doi=10.1002/ajpa.20157}}&lt;/ref&gt; This marks the beginning of the [[Paleolithic]], or Old Stone Age; its end is taken to be the end of the last Ice Age, around 10,000 years ago. The Paleolithic is subdivided into the [[Lower Paleolithic]] (Early Stone Age, ending around 350,000–300,000 years ago), the [[Middle Paleolithic]] (Middle Stone Age, until 50,000–30,000 years ago), and the [[Upper Paleolithic]].

The period from 700,000–300,000 years ago is also known as the [[Acheulean]], when ''H. ergaster'' (or ''erectus'') made large stone [[hand axe]]s out of [[flint]] and [[quartzite]], at first quite rough (Early Acheulian), later &quot;[[retouch (lithics)|retouched]]&quot; by additional, more subtle strikes at the sides of the [[lithic flake|flakes]]. After 350,000 BP ([[Before Present]]) the more refined so-called [[Levallois technique]] was developed, a series of consecutive strikes, by which scrapers, slicers (&quot;racloirs&quot;), needles, and flattened needles were made.&lt;ref name=Plummer/&gt; Finally, after about 50,000 BP, ever more refined and specialized flint tools were made by the Neanderthals and the immigrant [[Cro-Magnon]]s (knives, blades, skimmers). In this period they also started to make tools out of bone.

==Transition to behavioral modernity==
{{See also|Behavioral modernity}}
Until about 50,000–40,000 years ago the use of stone tools seems to have progressed stepwise. Each phase (''H. habilis'', ''H. ergaster'', ''H. neanderthalensis'') started at a higher level than the previous one, but after each phase started, further development was slow. Currently paleoanthropologists are debating whether these ''Homo'' species possessed some or many of the cultural and behavioral traits associated with modern humans such as language, complex symbolic thinking, technological creativity etc. It seems that they were culturally conservative maintaining simple technologies and foraging patterns over very long periods. Around 50,000 BP modern human culture started to evolve more rapidly. The transition to behavioral modernity has been characterized as a &quot;Great Leap Forward&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;GGS 39&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Diamond | first = Jared | authorlink = Jared Diamond | title = [[Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fate of Human Societies]] | publisher = [[W. W. Norton]] | year = 1999 | isbn = 978-0-393-31755-8 | page = 39 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or as the &quot;Upper Palaeolithic Revolution&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Ofer Bar-Yosef. The Upper Paleolithic Revolution. Annual Review of Anthropology. Vol. 31, (2002), pp. 363-393&lt;/ref&gt; because of the sudden appearance of distinctive signs of modern behavior in the archaeological record.  Some scholars consider the transition to have been more gradual, with some features already appearing among Archaic Homo sapiens already around 200,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;April Nowell. 2010. Defining Behavioral Modernity in the Context of Neandertal and Anatomically Modern Human Populations. Annual Review of Anthropology Vol. 39: 437-452. DOI: 10.1146/annurev.anthro.012809.105113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francesco d'Errico and Chris B. Stringer. 2011. Evolution, revolution or saltation scenario for the emergence of modern cultures? Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 12 April 2011 vol. 366 no. 1567 1060-1069. doi: 10.1098/rstb.2010.0340&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern humans started burying their dead, using animal hides to make clothing, hunting with more sophisticated techniques (such as using [[trapping pit]]s or driving animals off cliffs), and engaging in [[cave painting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ambrose SH|title=Paleolithic technology and human evolution|journal=Science|volume=291|issue=5509|pages=1748–53|year=2001|pmid=11249821|doi=10.1126/science.1059487|bibcode = 2001Sci...291.1748A }}&lt;/ref&gt; As human culture advanced, different populations of humans introduced novelty to existing technologies: artifacts such as fish hooks, buttons and bone needles show signs of variation among different populations of humans, something that had not been seen in human cultures prior to 50,000 BP. Typically, ''H. neanderthalensis'' populations do not vary in their technologies.

Among concrete examples of [[Modern human behavior]], anthropologists include specialization of tools, use of jewellery and images (such as cave drawings), organization of living space, rituals (for example, burials with grave gifts), specialized hunting techniques, exploration of less hospitable geographical areas, and [[barter]] trade networks. Debate continues as to whether a &quot;revolution&quot; led to modern humans (&quot;the big bang of human consciousness&quot;), or whether the evolution was more gradual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Mcbrearty S, Brooks AS|title=The revolution that wasn't: a new interpretation of the origin of modern human behavior|journal=J. Hum. Evol.|volume=39|issue=5|pages=453–563|year=2000|pmid=11102266 |doi=10.1006/jhev.2000.0435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recent and current human evolution==
Natural selection occurs in modern human populations. For example, the population which is at risk of the severe debilitating disease [[kuru (disease)|kuru]] has significant over-representation of an immune variant of the [[prion protein]] gene G127V versus non-immune alleles. The frequency of this [[Mutation|genetic variant]] is due to the survival of immune persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Medical Research Council (UK)|title=Brain Disease 'Resistance Gene' evolves in Papua New Guinea community; could offer insights Into CJD|newspaper=Science Daily (online)|location=Science News|date=November 21, 2009|url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091120091959.htm|accessdate=2009-11-22|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uQpeiOxE|archivedate=2010-11-22|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1056/NEJMoa0809716}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other reported evolutionary trends in other populations include a lengthening of the reproductive period, reduction in cholesterol levels, blood glucose and blood pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1073/pnas.0906199106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that human evolution has accelerated since, and as a result of, the development of agriculture and civilization some 10,000 years ago. It is claimed that this has resulted in substantial genetic differences between different current human populations.&lt;ref&gt;Cochran G &amp; Harpending H. 2009. ''The 10,000 Year Explosion''. Basic Books N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lactase persistence]] is an example of such recent evolution.
