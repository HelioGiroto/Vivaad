Scientific observation of earlier stages in the development of the universe, which can be seen at great distances, suggests that the universe has been governed by the same physical laws and constants throughout most of its extent and history. 

There are various [[multiverse]] hypotheses, in which physicists have suggested that the universe might be one among many universes that likewise exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronomy.pomona.edu/Projects/moderncosmo/Sean%27s%20mutliverse.html multiverse].

Observations have shown that the universe appears to be expanding at an [[Accelerating universe|accelerating rate]], and a number of models have arisen to predict [[ultimate fate of the universe|its ultimate fate]].

Throughout recorded history, several [[cosmology|cosmologies]] and [[cosmogony|cosmogonies]] have been proposed to account for observations of the universe. The earliest quantitative [[geocentric]] models were developed by the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek philosophers]]. Over the centuries, more precise observations and improved theories of gravity led to [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus's]] [[heliocentrism|heliocentric model]] and the [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] model of the [[Solar System]], respectively. Further improvements in astronomy led to the realization that the Solar System is embedded in a [[galaxy]] composed of billions of stars, the [[Milky Way]], and that other galaxies exist outside it, as far as astronomical instruments can reach. Careful studies of the distribution of these galaxies and their [[spectral line]]s have led to much of [[physical cosmology|modern cosmology]]. Discovery of the [[red shift]] and cosmic [[microwave background radiation]] revealed that the universe is expanding and apparently had a beginning.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===History of the universe===
According to the prevailing scientific model of the universe, known as the [[Big bang|Big Bang]], the universe expanded from an extremely hot, dense phase called the [[Planck epoch]], in which all the matter and energy of the [[observable universe]] was concentrated. Since the Planck epoch, the universe has been [[Cosmic expansion|expanding]] to its present form, possibly with a brief period (less than [[Scientific Notation|10&lt;sup&gt;−32&lt;/sup&gt;]] seconds) of [[cosmic inflation]]. Several independent experimental measurements support this theoretical [[Metric expansion of space|expansion]] and, more generally, the Big Bang theory. Recent observations indicate that this expansion is accelerating because of [[dark energy]], and that most of the matter in the universe may be in a form which cannot be detected by present instruments, called [[dark matter]].&lt;ref&gt;In contrast to [[dark energy]], which is expansive (&quot;negative pressure&quot;), the [[dark matter]] leads to &quot;clumping&quot; through gravitation.&lt;/ref&gt; The common use of the &quot;dark matter&quot; and &quot;dark energy&quot; [[placeholder name]]s for the unknown entities purported to account for about 95% of the [[Mass–energy equivalence|mass-energy density]] of the universe demonstrates the present observational and conceptual shortcomings and uncertainties concerning the nature and [[ultimate fate of the universe|ultimate fate]] of the universe.&lt;ref&gt;''Universe'', ed. [[Martin Rees, Baron Rees of Ludlow|Martin Rees]], pp. 54-55, [[Dorling Kindersley]] Publishing, New York 2005, ISBN 978-0-7566-1364-8&lt;/ref&gt;

Current interpretations of [[observable universe|astronomical observations]] indicate that the [[age of the universe]] is 13.75 ± 0.17 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] years,&lt;ref name=&quot;marshallaugerhilbertblandford&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Suyu|first1=S.

Since we cannot observe space beyond the limitations of light (or any electromagnetic radiation), it is uncertain whether the size of the universe is finite or infinite.

==Etymology, synonyms and definitions==
{{See also|Cosmos|Nature|World (philosophy)|Celestial spheres}}
The word ''universe'' derives from the [[Old French]] word ''Univers'', which in turn derives from the [[Latin]] word ''universum''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Compact Edition of the Oxford English Dictionary'', volume II, Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1971, p.3518.&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word was used by [[Cicero]] and later Latin authors in many of the same senses as the modern [[English language|English]] word is used.&lt;ref name=&quot;lewis_short&quot; /&gt; The Latin word derives from the poetic contraction ''Unvorsum''&amp;nbsp;— first used by [[Lucretius]] in Book IV (line 262) of his ''[[On the Nature of Things|De rerum natura]]'' (''On the Nature of Things'')&amp;nbsp;— which connects ''un, uni'' (the combining form of ''unus'', or &quot;one&quot;) with ''vorsum, versum'' (a noun made from the perfect passive participle of ''vertere'', meaning &quot;something rotated, rolled, changed&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;lewis_short&quot;&gt;Lewis, C. T. and Short, S ''A Latin Dictionary'', Oxford University Press, ISBN 0-19-864201-6, pp. 1933, 1977–1978.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Foucault pendulum animated.gif|thumb|left|Artistic rendition (highly exaggerated) of a [[Foucault pendulum]] showing that the Earth is not stationary, but rotates.]] 
An alternative interpretation of ''unvorsum'' is &quot;everything rotated as one&quot; or &quot;everything rotated by one&quot;. In this sense, it may be considered a translation of an earlier Greek word for the universe, {{lang|grc|περιφορά}}, (''periforá'', &quot;circumambulation&quot;), originally used to describe a course of a meal, the food being carried around the circle of dinner guests.&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott, p. 1392.&lt;/ref&gt; This Greek word refers to [[celestial spheres]], an early Greek model of the universe. Regarding Plato's [[Metaphor of the sun]], [[Aristotle]] suggests that the rotation of the sphere of [[fixed stars]] inspired by the [[primum movens|prime mover]], motivates, in turn, terrestrial change via the Sun. Careful [[astronomy|astronomical]] and physical measurements (such as the [[Foucault pendulum]]) are required to prove the Earth rotates on its axis.

A term for &quot;universe&quot; in ancient Greece was {{lang|grc|τὸ πᾶν}} (''tò pán'', [[The All]], [[Pan (mythology)]]). Related terms were matter, ({{lang|grc|τὸ ὅλον}}, ''tò ólon'', see also [[Hyle]], lit. wood) and place ({{lang|grc|τὸ κενόν}}, ''tò kenón'').&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott, pp. 1345–1346.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Yonge, Charles Duke|year = 1870|title = An English-Greek lexicon|publisher = American Book Company|location = New York|page = 567}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other synonyms for the universe among the ancient Greek philosophers included {{lang|grc|κόσμος}} ([[cosmos]]) and {{lang|grc|φύσις}} (meaning [[Nature]], from which we derive the word [[physics]]).&lt;ref&gt;Liddell and Scott, pp. 985, 1964.&lt;/ref&gt; The same synonyms are found in Latin authors (''totum'', ''mundus'', ''natura'')&lt;ref&gt;Lewis and Short, pp. 1881–1882, 1175, 1189–1190.&lt;/ref&gt; and survive in modern languages, e.g., the German words ''Das All'', ''Weltall'', and ''Natur'' for universe. The same synonyms are found in English, such as everything (as in the [[theory of everything]]), the cosmos (as in [[cosmology]]), the [[world (philosophy)|world]] (as in the [[many-worlds hypothesis]]), and [[Nature]] (as in [[natural law]]s or [[natural philosophy]]).&lt;ref&gt;OED, pp. 909, 569, 3821–3822, 1900.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadest definition: reality and probability===
{{See also|Essence–Energies_distinction#Distinction between created and uncreated}}

The broadest definition of the universe is found in ''[[De divisione naturae]]'' by the [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[philosopher]] and [[theology|theologian]] [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena]], who defined it as simply everything: everything that is created and everything that is not created.

===Definition as reality===
{{See also|Reality|Physics}}

More customarily, the universe is defined as everything that exists, (has existed, and will exist) {{Citation needed|(This is probably from Carl Sagan's statement in an early NOVA program) date=May 2010|date=July 2011}}. According to our current understanding, the universe consists of three principles: [[spacetime]], forms of [[energy]], including [[momentum]] and [[matter]], and the [[physical law]]s that relate them.

===Definition as connected space-time===
{{See also|Chaotic Inflation theory}}

It is possible to conceive of disconnected [[space-time]]s, each existing but unable to interact with one another. An easily visualized metaphor is a group of separate [[soap bubble]]s, in which observers living on one soap bubble cannot interact with those on other soap bubbles, even in principle. According to one common terminology, each &quot;soap bubble&quot; of space-time is denoted as a universe, whereas our particular [[space-time]] is denoted as ''the universe'', just as we call our moon ''the [[Moon]]''. The entire collection of these separate space-times is denoted as the [[multiverse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EllisKS03&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In principle, the other unconnected universes may have different [[dimension]]alities and [[topology|topologies]] of [[space-time]], different forms of [[matter]] and [[energy]], and different [[physical law]]s and [[physical constant]]s, although such possibilities are currently speculative.

===Definition as observable reality===
{{See also|Observable universe|Observational cosmology}}

According to a still-more-restrictive definition, the universe is everything within our connected [[space-time]] that could have a chance to interact with us and vice versa.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} According to the [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]], some regions of [[space]] may never interact with ours even in the lifetime of the universe, due to the finite [[speed of light]] and the ongoing [[expansion of space]]. For example, radio messages sent from Earth may never reach some regions of space, even if the universe would live forever; space may expand faster than light can traverse it. It is worth emphasizing that those distant regions of space are taken to exist and be part of reality as much as we are; yet we can never interact with them. The spatial region within which we can affect and be affected is denoted as the [[observable universe]]. Strictly speaking, the observable universe depends on the location of the observer. By traveling, an observer can come into contact with a greater region of space-time than an observer who remains still, so that the observable universe for the former is larger than for the latter. Nevertheless, even the most rapid traveler will not be able to interact with all of space. Typically, the observable universe is taken to mean the universe observable from our vantage point in the Milky Way Galaxy.

This expansion accounts for how Earth-bound scientists can observe the light from a galaxy 30 billion light years away, even if that light has traveled for only 13 billion years; the very space between them has expanded. This expansion is consistent with the observation that the light from distant galaxies has been [[redshift]]ed; the [[photon]]s emitted have been stretched to longer [[wavelength]]s and lower [[frequency]] during their journey.

There is no explanation for the particular values that [[physical constant]]s appear to have throughout our universe, such as [[Planck's constant]] ''h'' or the [[gravitational constant]] ''G''. Several [[conservation law]]s have been identified, such as the [[conservation of charge]], [[conservation of momentum|momentum]], [[conservation of angular momentum|angular momentum]] and [[conservation of energy|energy]]; in many cases, these conservation laws can be related to [[symmetry|symmetries]] or [[Bianchi identity|mathematical identities]].

===Fine tuning===
{{main|Fine-tuned Universe}}

It appears that many of the properties of the universe have special values in the sense that a universe where these properties only differ slightly would not be able to support intelligent life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Hawking|year=1988|title=A Brief History of Time|publisher=Bantam Books|isbn=0-553-05340-X|page=125|authorlink=Stephen Hawking}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|year=1999|title=Just Six Numbers|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|isbn=0-465-03672-4|author=Martin Rees|authorlink=Martin Rees}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all scientists agree that this [[fine-tuned universe|fine-tuning]] exists.&lt;ref name=&quot;adams&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adams|first=F.C.|year=2008|title=Stars in other universes: stellar structure with different fundamental constants|journal= Journal of Cosmology and Astroparticle Physics|issue=8|doi=10.1088/1475-7516/2008/08/010|arxiv=0807.3697|volume=2008|page=010|bibcode = 2008JCAP...08..010A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harnik|first=R.|coauthors=Kribs, G.D. and Perez, G.|year=2006|title=A universe without weak interactions|journal=Physical Review D|volume=74|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.74.035006|issue=3|arxiv=hep-ph/0604027|page=035006 |bibcode = 2006PhRvD..74c5006H}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it is not known under what conditions intelligent life could form and what form or shape that would take. A relevant observation in this discussion is that for an observer to exist to observe fine-tuning, the universe must be able to support intelligent life. As such the [[conditional probability]] of observing a universe that is fine-tuned to support intelligent life is 1. This observation is known as the [[anthropic principle]] and is particularly relevant if the creation of the universe was probabilistic or if multiple universes with a variety of properties exist (see [[#Multiverse theory|below]]).

==Historical models==
{{See also|Cosmology|Timeline of cosmology}}

Many models of the cosmos (cosmologies) and its origin (cosmogonies) have been proposed, based on the then-available data and conceptions of the universe. Historically, cosmologies and cosmogonies were based on narratives of gods acting in various ways. Theories of an impersonal universe governed by physical laws were first proposed by the Greeks and Indians. Over the centuries, improvements in astronomical observations and theories of motion and gravitation led to ever more accurate descriptions of the universe. The modern era of cosmology began with [[Albert Einstein|Albert Einstein's]] 1915 [[general relativity|general theory of relativity]], which made it possible to quantitatively predict the origin, evolution, and conclusion of the universe as a whole. Most modern, accepted theories of cosmology are based on general relativity and, more specifically, the predicted [[Big Bang]]; however, still more careful measurements are required to determine which theory is correct.

===Creation===
{{Main|Creation myth|Creator deity}}

Many cultures have [[List of creation myths|stories describing the origin of the world]], which may be roughly grouped into common types. In one type of story, the world is born from a [[world egg]]; such stories include the [[Finnish people|Finnish]] [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Kalevala]]'', the [[China|Chinese]] story of [[Pangu]] or the [[History of India|Indian]] [[Brahmanda Purana]]. In related stories, the creation idea is caused by a single entity emanating or producing something by him- or herself, as in the [[Tibetan Buddhism]] concept of [[Adi-Buddha]], the [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] story of [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] (Mother Earth), the [[Aztec mythology|Aztec]] goddess [[Coatlicue]] myth, the [[ancient Egyptian religion|ancient Egyptian]] [[Ennead|god]] [[Atum]] story, or the [[Genesis creation narrative]]. In another type of story, the world is created from the union of male and female deities, as in the [[Maori mythology|Maori story]] of [[Rangi and Papa]]. In other stories, the universe is created by crafting it from pre-existing materials, such as the corpse of a dead god&amp;nbsp;— as from [[Tiamat]] in the [[Babylon]]ian epic [[Enuma Elish]] or from the giant [[Ymir]] in [[Norse mythology]]&amp;nbsp;– or from chaotic materials, as in [[Izanagi]] and [[Izanami]] in [[Japanese mythology]]. In other stories, the universe emanates from fundamental principles, such as [[Brahman]] and [[Prakrti]], the [[Serer creation myth|creation myth]] of the [[Serer people|Serers]],&lt;ref&gt;([[Henry Gravrand]], &quot;La civilisation Sereer -Pangool&quot;) [in] [[Universität Frankfurt am Main]], Frobenius-Institut, Deutsche Gesellschaft für Kulturmorphologie, Frobenius Gesellschaft, &quot;Paideuma: Mitteilungen zur Kulturkunde, Volumes 43-44&quot;, F. Steiner (1997), pp 144-5, ISBN 3515028420&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[yin and yang]] of the [[Tao]].

===Philosophical models===
{{Further|Cosmology}}
{{See also|Pre-Socratic philosophy|Physics (Aristotle)|Hindu cosmology|Islamic cosmology|Time}}

From the 6th century BCE, the [[pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratic Greek philosophers]] developed the earliest known philosophical models of the universe. The earliest Greek philosophers noted that appearances can be deceiving, and sought to understand the underlying reality behind the appearances. In particular, they noted the ability of matter to change forms (e.g., ice to water to steam) and several philosophers proposed that all the apparently different materials of the world are different forms of a single primordial material, or [[arche]]. The first to do so was [[Thales]], who proposed this material is [[Water (classical element)|Water]]. Thales' student, [[Anaximander]], proposed that everything came from the limitless [[Apeiron (cosmology)|apeiron]]. [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] proposed [[Air (classical element)|Air]] on account of its perceived attractive and repulsive qualities that cause the arche to condense or dissociate into different forms. [[Anaxagoras]], proposed the principle of [[Nous]] (Mind). [[Heraclitus]] proposed [[fire (classical element)|fire]] (and spoke of [[logos]]). [[Empedocles]] proposed the elements: earth, water, air and fire. His four element theory became very popular. Like [[Pythagoras]], [[Plato]] believed that all things were composed of [[number]], with the Empedocles' elements taking the form of the [[Platonic solids]]. Democritus, and later philosophers—most notably [[Leucippus]]—proposed that the universe was composed of indivisible [[atom]]s moving through [[void (astronomy)|void]] ([[vacuum]]). [[Aristotle]] did not believe that was feasible because air, like water, offers [[Drag (physics)|resistance to motion]]. Air will immediately rush in to fill a void, and moreover, without resistance, it would do so indefinitely fast.

Although Heraclitus argued for eternal change, his quasi-contemporary [[Parmenides]] made the radical suggestion that all change is an illusion, that the true underlying reality is eternally unchanging and of a single nature. Parmenides denoted this reality as {{lang|grc|τὸ ἐν}} (The One). Parmenides' theory seemed implausible to many Greeks, but his student [[Zeno of Elea]] challenged them with several famous [[Zeno's paradoxes|paradoxes]]. Aristotle responded to these paradoxes by developing the notion of a potential countable infinity, as well as the infinitely divisible continuum. Unlike the eternal and unchanging cycles of time, he believed the world was bounded by the celestial spheres, and thus magnitude was only finitely multiplicative.

The [[Indian philosophy|Indian philosopher]] [[Kanada]], founder of the [[Vaisheshika]] school, developed a theory of [[atomism]] and proposed that [[light]] and [[heat]] were varieties of the same substance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Will Durant]], ''Our Oriental Heritage'':
{{quote|&quot;Two systems of Hindu thought propound physical theories suggestively similar to those of [[Ancient Greece|Greece]]. Kanada, founder of the Vaisheshika philosophy, held that the world was composed of atoms as many in kind as the various elements. The [[Jainism|Jains]] more nearly approximated to [[Democritus]] by teaching that all atoms were of the same kind, producing different effects by diverse modes of combinations. Kanada believed light and heat to be varieties of the same substance; [[Udayana]] taught that all heat comes from the sun; and [[Vācaspati Miśra|Vachaspati]], like Newton, interpreted light as composed of minute particles emitted by substances and striking the eye.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 5th century AD, the [[Buddhist atomism|Buddhist atomist]] philosopher [[Dignāga]] proposed [[atom]]s to be point-sized, durationless, and made of energy. They denied the existence of substantial matter and proposed that movement consisted of momentary flashes of a stream of energy.&lt;ref&gt;Stcherbatsky, F. Th. (1930, 1962), ''Buddhist Logic'', Volume 1, p. 19, Dover, New York:

{{quote|&quot;The Buddhists denied the existence of substantial matter altogether. Movement consists for them of moments, it is a staccato movement, momentary flashes of a stream of energy... &quot;Everything is evanescent“,... says the Buddhist, because there is no stuff... Both systems &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Samkhya|Sānkhya]], and later Indian Buddhism] share in common a tendency to push the analysis of Existence up to its minutest, last elements which are imagined as absolute qualities, or things possessing only one unique quality. They are called “qualities” (guna-dharma) in both systems in the sense of absolute qualities, a kind of atomic, or intra-atomic, energies of which the empirical things are composed. Both systems, therefore, agree in denying the objective reality of the categories of Substance and Quality,... and of the relation of Inference uniting them. There is in Sānkhya philosophy no separate existence of qualities. What we call quality is but a particular manifestation of a subtle entity. To every new unit of quality corresponds a subtle quantum of matter which is called guna “quality”, but represents a subtle substantive entity. The same applies to early Buddhism where all qualities are substantive... or, more precisely, dynamic entities, although they are also called dharmas ('qualities').&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory of [[temporal finitism]] was inspired by the doctrine of Creation shared by the three [[Abrahamic religions]]: [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]. The [[Christian philosophy|Christian philosopher]], [[John Philoponus]], presented the philosophical arguments against the ancient Greek notion of an infinite past and future. Philoponus' arguments against an infinite past were used by the [[Early Islamic philosophy|early Muslim philosopher]], [[Al-Kindi]] (Alkindus); the [[Jewish philosophy|Jewish philosopher]], [[Saadia Gaon]] (Saadia ben Joseph); and the [[Kalam|Muslim theologian]], [[Al-Ghazali]] (Algazel). Borrowing from Aristotle's ''Physics'' and ''Metaphysics'', they employed two logical arguments against an infinite past, the first being the &quot;argument from the impossibility of the existence of an actual infinite&quot;, which states:&lt;ref name=Craig&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Whitrow and Popper on the Impossibility of an Infinite Past|first=William Lane|last=Craig|journal=The British Journal for the Philosophy of Science|volume=30|issue=2|date=June 1979|pages=165–170 (165–6)|doi=10.1093/bjps/30.2.165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;An actual infinite cannot exist.&quot;
:&quot;An infinite temporal regress of events is an actual infinite.&quot;
:&quot;&lt;math&gt;\therefore&lt;/math&gt; An infinite temporal regress of events cannot exist.&quot;

The second argument, the &quot;argument from the impossibility of completing an actual infinite by successive addition&quot;, states:&lt;ref name=Craig/&gt;

:&quot;An actual infinite cannot be completed by successive addition.&quot;
:&quot;The temporal series of past events has been completed by successive addition.&quot;
:&quot;&lt;math&gt;\therefore&lt;/math&gt; The temporal series of past events cannot be an actual infinite.&quot;

Both arguments were adopted by Christian philosophers and theologians, and the second argument in particular became more famous after it was adopted by [[Immanuel Kant]] in his thesis of the first [[antinomy]] concerning [[time]].&lt;ref name=Craig/&gt;

===Astronomical models===
{{Main|History of astronomy}}
[[File:Aristarchus working.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aristarchus of Samos|Aristarchus]]'s 3rd century BCE calculations on the relative sizes of from left the Sun, Earth and Moon, from a 10th century AD Greek copy]]
Astronomical models of the universe were proposed soon after [[astronomy]] began with the [[Babylonian astronomy|Babylonian astronomers]], who viewed the universe as a [[Flat Earth|flat disk]] floating in the ocean, and this forms the premise for early Greek maps like those of [[Anaximander]] and [[Hecataeus of Miletus]].

Later [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] philosophers, observing the motions of the heavenly bodies, were concerned with developing models of the universe based more profoundly on empirical evidence. The first coherent model was proposed by [[Eudoxus of Cnidos]]. According to Aristotle's physical interpretation of the model, [[celestial spheres]] eternally [[uniform circular motion|rotate with uniform motion]] around a stationary Earth. Normal [[classical elements|matter]], is entirely contained within the terrestrial sphere. This model was also refined by [[Callippus]] and after concentric spheres were abandoned, it was brought into nearly perfect agreement with astronomical observations by [[Ptolemy]]. The success of such a model is largely due to the mathematical fact that any function (such as the position of a planet) can be decomposed into a set of circular functions (the [[Fourier modes]]). Other Greek scientists, such as the [[Pythagoreans|Pythagorean]] philosopher [[Philolaus]] postulated that at the center of the universe was a &quot;central fire&quot; around which the [[Earth]], [[Sun]], [[Moon]] and [[Planets]] revolved in uniform circular motion.&lt;ref&gt;Boyer, C. ''A History of Mathematics.'' Wiley, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomer]] [[Aristarchus of Samos]] was the first known individual to propose a [[Heliocentrism|heliocentric]] model of the universe. Though the original text has been lost, a reference in Archimedes' book The Sand Reckoner describes Aristarchus' heliocentric theory. [[Archimedes]] wrote: (translated into English)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
You King Gelon are aware the 'universe' is the name given by most astronomers to the sphere the center of which is the center of the Earth, while its radius is equal to the straight line between the center of the Sun and the center of the Earth. This is the common account as you have heard from astronomers. But Aristarchus has brought out a book consisting of certain hypotheses, wherein it appears, as a consequence of the assumptions made, that the universe is many times greater than the 'universe' just mentioned. His hypotheses are that the fixed stars and the Sun remain unmoved, that the Earth revolves about the Sun on the circumference of a circle, the Sun lying in the middle of the orbit, and that the sphere of fixed stars, situated about the same center as the Sun, is so great that the circle in which he supposes the Earth to revolve bears such a proportion to the distance of the fixed stars as the center of the sphere bears to its surface.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aristarchus thus believed the stars to be very far away, and saw this as the reason why there was no visible parallax, that is, an observed movement of the stars relative to each other as the Earth moved around the Sun. The stars are in fact much farther away than the distance that was generally assumed in ancient times, which is why stellar parallax is only detectable with telescopes. The geocentric model, consistent with planetary parallax, was assumed to be an explanation for the unobservability of the parallel phenomenon, stellar parallax. The rejection of the heliocentric view was apparently quite strong, as the following passage from Plutarch suggests (On the Apparent Face in the Orb of the Moon):

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[Cleanthes]] [a contemporary of Aristarchus and head of the Stoics] thought it was the duty of the Greeks to indict Aristarchus of Samos on the charge of impiety for putting in motion the Hearth of the universe [i.e. the earth], . . . supposing the heaven to remain at rest and the earth to revolve in an oblique circle, while it rotates, at the same time, about its own axis. [1]
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who supported Aristarchus' heliocentric model was [[Seleucus of Seleucia]], a [[Hellenistic astronomer]] who lived a century after Aristarchus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink=Otto E.

Seleucus' arguments for a heliocentric theory were probably related to the phenomenon of [[tide]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucio Russo]], ''Flussi e riflussi'', Feltrinelli, Milano, 2003, ISBN 88-07-10349-4.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Strabo]] (1.1.9), Seleucus was the first to state that the [[tide]]s are due to the attraction of the Moon, and that the height of the tides depends on the Moon's position relative to the Sun.&lt;ref&gt;Bartel, p. 527&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, he may have proved the heliocentric theory by determining the constants of a [[Geometry|geometric]] model for the heliocentric theory and by developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model, like what Nicolaus Copernicus later did in the 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;Bartel, pp. 527–9&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Middle Ages]], heliocentric models may have also been proposed by the [[Indian astronomy|Indian astronomer]], [[Aryabhata]],&lt;ref&gt;Bartel, pp. 529–34&lt;/ref&gt; and by the [[Islamic astronomy|Persian astronomers]], [[Ja'far ibn Muhammad Abu Ma'shar al-Balkhi|Albumasar]]&lt;ref&gt;Bartel, pp. 534–7&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Al-Sijzi]].&lt;ref name=Nasr&gt;{{Cite book |last=Nasr |first=Seyyed H. |authorlink=Hossein Nasr |date=1st edition in 1964, 2nd edition in 1993 |title=An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines |edition=2nd |publisher=1st edition by [[Harvard University Press]], 2nd edition by [[State University of New York Press]] |isbn=0-7914-1515-5 |pages=135–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aristotelian model was accepted in the [[Western world]] for roughly two millennia, until Copernicus revived Aristarchus' theory that the astronomical data could be explained more plausibly if the [[earth]] rotated on its axis and if the [[sun]] were placed at the center of the universe.

{{cquote|In the center rests the sun. For who would place this lamp of a very beautiful temple in another or better place than this wherefrom it can illuminate everything at the same time?|20px|20px|Nicolaus Copernicus| in Chapter 10, Book 1 of ''De Revolutionibus Orbium Coelestrum'' (1543)}}

As noted by Copernicus himself, the suggestion that the [[Earth's rotation|Earth rotates]] was very old, dating at least to [[Philolaus]] (c. 450 BC), [[Heraclides Ponticus]] (c. 350 BC) and [[Ecphantus the Pythagorean]]. Roughly a century before Copernicus, Christian scholar [[Nicholas of Cusa]] also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis in his book, ''On Learned Ignorance'' (1440).&lt;ref&gt;Misner, Thorne and Wheeler (1973), p. 754.&lt;/ref&gt; Aryabhata (476–550), [[Brahmagupta]] (598–668), [[Albumasar]] and [[Al-Sijzi]], also proposed that the Earth rotates on its axis.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} The first [[Empirical research|empirical evidence]] for the Earth's rotation on its axis, using the phenomenon of [[comet]]s, was given by [[Nasīr al-Dīn al-Tūsī|Tusi]] (1201–1274) and [[Ali Qushji]] (1403–1474).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Of the four [[fundamental interaction]]s, [[gravitation]] is dominant at cosmological length scales; that is, the other three forces play a negligible role in determining structures at the level of planetary systems, galaxies and larger-scale structures. Since all matter and energy gravitate, gravity's effects are cumulative; by contrast, the effects of positive and negative charges tend to cancel one another, making electromagnetism relatively insignificant on cosmological length scales. The remaining two interactions, the [[weak nuclear force|weak]] and [[strong nuclear force]]s, decline very rapidly with distance; their effects are confined mainly to sub-atomic length scales.

===General theory of relativity===
{{Main|Introduction to general relativity|General relativity|Einstein's field equations}}

Given gravitation's predominance in shaping cosmological structures, accurate predictions of the universe's past and future require an accurate theory of gravitation. The best theory available is [[Albert Einstein]]'s general theory of relativity, which has passed all experimental tests hitherto. However, since rigorous experiments have not been carried out on cosmological length scales, general relativity could conceivably be inaccurate. Nevertheless, its cosmological predictions appear to be consistent with observations, so there is no compelling reason to adopt another theory.

General relativity provides a set of ten nonlinear partial differential equations for the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|spacetime metric]] ([[Einstein field equations|Einstein's field equations]]) that must be solved from the distribution of [[mass-energy]] and [[momentum]] throughout the universe. Since these are unknown in exact detail, cosmological models have been based on the [[cosmological principle]], which states that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic. In effect, this principle asserts that the gravitational effects of the various galaxies making up the universe are equivalent to those of a fine [[Dust solution|dust]] distributed uniformly throughout the universe with the same average density. The assumption of a uniform dust makes it easy to solve Einstein's field equations and predict the past and future of the universe on cosmological time scales.

Einstein's field equations include a [[cosmological constant]] (''Λ''),&lt;ref name=&quot;einstein_1917&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rindler (1977), pp. 226–229.&lt;/ref&gt; that corresponds to an energy density of empty space.&lt;ref&gt;Landau and Lifshitz (1975), pp. 358–359.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on its sign, the cosmological constant can either slow (negative ''Λ'') or accelerate (positive ''Λ'') the [[metric expansion of space|expansion of the universe]]. Although many scientists, including Einstein, had speculated that ''Λ'' was zero,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Einstein|first = A|authorlink = Albert Einstein|year = 1931|title = Zum kosmologischen Problem der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie|journal = Sitzungsberichte der Preussischen Akademie der Wissenschaften, Physikalisch-mathematische Klasse|volume = 1931|pages = 235–237}}&lt;br /&gt;{{cite journal|author = [[Albert Einstein|Einstein A.]], [[Willem de Sitter|de Sitter W.]]|year = 1932|title = On the relation between the expansion and the mean density of the universe|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume = 18|pages = 213–214|doi = 10.1073/pnas.18.3.213|pmid = 16587663|issue = 3|pmc = 1076193|bibcode = 1932PNAS...18..213E}}&lt;/ref&gt; recent astronomical observations of [[type Ia supernova]]e have detected a large amount of &quot;[[dark energy]]&quot; that is accelerating the universe's expansion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hubblesite.org/newscenter/archive/releases/2004/12/text/ Hubble Telescope news release].

===Special relativity and space-time===
{{Main|Introduction to special relativity|Special relativity}}
[[File:Only distance is real.svg|thumb|300px|Only its length ''L'' is intrinsic to the rod (shown in black); coordinate differences between its endpoints (such as Δx, Δy or Δξ, Δη) depend on their frame of reference (depicted in blue and red, respectively).]]

The universe has at least three [[space|spatial]] and one temporal ([[time]]) dimension. It was long thought that the spatial and temporal dimensions were different in nature and independent of one another. However, according to the [[special relativity|special theory of relativity]], spatial and temporal separations are interconvertible (within limits) by changing one's motion.

To understand this interconversion, it is helpful to consider the analogous interconversion of spatial separations along the three spatial dimensions. Consider the two endpoints of a rod of length ''L''. The length can be determined from the differences in the three coordinates Δx, Δy and Δz of the two endpoints in a given reference frame

:&lt;math&gt;
L^{2} = \Delta x^{2} + \Delta y^{2} + \Delta z^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

using the [[Pythagorean theorem]]. In a rotated reference frame, the coordinate differences differ, but they give the same length

:&lt;math&gt;
L^{2} = \Delta \xi^{2} + \Delta \eta^{2} + \Delta \zeta^{2}.
&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the coordinates differences (Δx, Δy, Δz) and (Δξ, Δη, Δζ) are not intrinsic to the rod, but merely reflect the reference frame used to describe it; by contrast, the length ''L'' is an intrinsic property of the rod. The coordinate differences can be changed without affecting the rod, by rotating one's reference frame.

The analogy in [[spacetime]] is called the interval between two events; an event is defined as a point in spacetime, a specific position in space and a specific moment in time. The spacetime interval between two events is given by

:&lt;math&gt;
s^{2} = L_{1}^{2} - c^{2} \Delta t_{1}^{2} = L_{2}^{2} - c^{2} \Delta t_{2}^{2}
&lt;/math&gt;

where ''c'' is the speed of light. According to [[special relativity]], one can change a spatial and time separation (''L''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, Δ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) into another (''L''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Δ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by changing one's reference frame, as long as the change maintains the spacetime interval ''s''. Such a change in reference frame corresponds to changing one's motion; in a moving frame, lengths and times are different from their counterparts in a stationary reference frame. The precise manner in which the coordinate and time differences change with motion is described by the [[Lorentz transformation]].

===Solving Einstein's field equations===
{{See also|Big Bang|Ultimate fate of the universe}}
[[File:Closed Friedmann universe zero Lambda.ogg|thumb|right|Animation illustrating the [[metric expansion of the universe]]]]

The distances between the spinning galaxies increase with time, but the distances between the stars within each galaxy stay roughly the same, due to their gravitational interactions. This animation illustrates a closed Friedmann universe with zero [[cosmological constant]] Λ; such a universe oscillates between a [[Big Bang]] and a [[Big Crunch]].

In non-Cartesian (non-square) or curved coordinate systems, the Pythagorean theorem holds only on infinitesimal length scales and must be augmented with a more general [[metric tensor]] ''g''&lt;sub&gt;μν&lt;/sub&gt;, which can vary from place to place and which describes the local geometry in the particular coordinate system. However, assuming the [[cosmological principle]] that the universe is homogeneous and isotropic everywhere, every point in space is like every other point; hence, the metric tensor must be the same everywhere. That leads to a single form for the metric tensor, called the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]]

:&lt;math&gt;
ds^2 = -c^{2} dt^2 +
R(t)^2 \left( \frac{dr^2}{1-k r^2} + r^2 d\theta^2 + r^2 \sin^2 \theta \, d\phi^2 \right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where (''r'', θ, φ) correspond to a [[spherical coordinate system]]. This [[metric (mathematics)|metric]] has only two undetermined parameters: an overall length scale ''R'' that can vary with time, and a curvature index ''k'' that can be only 0, 1 or −1, corresponding to flat [[Euclidean geometry]], or spaces of positive or negative [[curvature]]. In cosmology, solving for the history of the universe is done by calculating ''R'' as a function of time, given ''k'' and the value of the [[cosmological constant]] ''Λ'', which is a (small) parameter in Einstein's field equations. The equation describing how ''R'' varies with time is known as the [[Friedmann equation]], after its inventor, [[Alexander Friedmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Friedmann A.|year = 1922|title = Über die Krümmung des Raumes|journal = Zeitschrift für Physik|volume = 10|issue = 1|pages = 377–386|doi = 10.1007/BF01332580|bibcode = 1922ZPhy...10..377F|authorlink = Alexander Friedmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The solutions for ''R(t)'' depend on ''k'' and ''Λ'', but some qualitative features of such solutions are general. First and most importantly, the length scale ''R'' of the universe can remain constant ''only'' if the universe is perfectly isotropic with positive curvature (''k''=1) and has one precise value of density everywhere, as first noted by [[Albert Einstein]]. However, this equilibrium is unstable and since the universe is known to be inhomogeneous on smaller scales, ''R'' must change, according to [[general relativity]]. When ''R'' changes, all the spatial distances in the universe change in tandem; there is an overall expansion or contraction of space itself. This accounts for the observation that galaxies appear to be flying apart; the space between them is stretching. The stretching of space also accounts for the apparent paradox that two galaxies can be 40 billion light years apart, although they started from the same point 13.7 billion years ago and never moved faster than the [[speed of light]].

Second, all solutions suggest that there was a [[gravitational singularity]] in the past, when ''R'' goes to zero and matter and energy became infinitely dense. It may seem that this conclusion is uncertain since it is based on the questionable assumptions of perfect homogeneity and isotropy (the cosmological principle) and that only the gravitational interaction is significant. However, the [[Penrose–Hawking singularity theorems]] show that a singularity should exist for very general conditions. Hence, according to Einstein's field equations, ''R'' grew rapidly from an unimaginably hot, dense state that existed immediately following this singularity (when ''R'' had a small, finite value); this is the essence of the [[Big Bang]] model of the universe. A common misconception is that the Big Bang model predicts that matter and energy exploded from a single point in space and time; that is false. Rather, space itself was created in the Big Bang and imbued with a fixed amount of energy and matter distributed uniformly throughout; as space expands (i.e., as ''R(t)'' increases), the density of that matter and energy decreases.

Third, the curvature index ''k'' determines the sign of the mean spatial curvature of [[spacetime]] averaged over length scales greater than a billion [[light year]]s. If ''k''=1, the curvature is positive and the universe has a finite volume. Such universes are often visualized as a [[3-sphere|three-dimensional sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; embedded in a four-dimensional space]]. Conversely, if ''k'' is zero or negative, the universe ''may'' have infinite volume, depending on its overall [[topology]]. It may seem counter-intuitive that an infinite and yet infinitely dense universe could be created in a single instant at the Big Bang when ''R''=0, but exactly that is predicted mathematically when ''k'' does not equal 1. For comparison, an infinite plane has zero curvature but infinite area, whereas an infinite cylinder is finite in one direction and a [[torus]] is finite in both. A toroidal universe could behave like a normal universe with [[periodic boundary conditions]], as seen in [[wraparound (video games)|&quot;wrap-around&quot; video games]] such as ''[[Asteroids (arcade game)|Asteroids]]''; a traveler crossing an outer &quot;boundary&quot; of space going ''outwards'' would reappear instantly at another point on the boundary moving ''inwards''.

[[File:CMB Timeline300 no WMAP.jpg|thumb|600px|center|Prevailing model of the origin and expansion of [[spacetime]] and all that it contains. In this diagram time increases from left to right, and one dimension of space is suppressed, so at any given time the universe is represented by a disk-shaped &quot;slice&quot; of the diagram. ]]

The [[ultimate fate of the universe]] is still unknown, because it depends critically on the curvature index ''k'' and the cosmological constant ''Λ''. If the universe is sufficiently dense, ''k'' equals +1, meaning that its average curvature throughout is positive and the universe will eventually recollapse in a [[Big Crunch]], possibly starting a new universe in a [[Big Bounce]]. Conversely, if the universe is insufficiently dense, ''k'' equals 0 or −1 and the universe will expand forever, cooling off and eventually becoming inhospitable for all life, as the stars die and all matter coalesces into black holes (the [[Future of an expanding universe|Big Freeze]] and the [[heat death of the universe]]). As noted above, recent data suggests that the expansion speed of the universe is not decreasing as originally expected, but increasing; if this continues indefinitely, the universe will eventually rip itself to shreds (the [[Big Rip]]). Experimentally, the universe has an overall density that is very close to the critical value between recollapse and eternal expansion; more careful astronomical observations are needed to resolve the question.

===Big Bang model===
{{Main|Big Bang|Timeline of the Big Bang|Nucleosynthesis|Lambda-CDM model}}

The prevailing Big Bang model accounts for many of the experimental observations described above, such as the correlation of distance and [[redshift]] of galaxies, the universal ratio of hydrogen:helium atoms, and the ubiquitous, isotropic microwave radiation background. As noted above, the redshift arises from the [[metric expansion of space]]; as the space itself expands, the wavelength of a [[photon]] traveling through space likewise increases, decreasing its energy. The longer a photon has been traveling, the more expansion it has undergone; hence, older photons from more distant galaxies are the most red-shifted. Determining the correlation between distance and redshift is an important problem in experimental [[physical cosmology]].

[[File:Primordial nucleosynthesis.svg|thumb|400px|Chief nuclear reactions responsible for the [[abundance of the chemical elements|relative abundances]] of light [[atomic nucleus|atomic nuclei]] observed throughout the universe.]]

Other experimental observations can be explained by combining the overall expansion of space with [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[atomic physics]]. As the universe expands, the energy density of the [[electromagnetic radiation]] decreases more quickly than does that of [[matter]], since the energy of a photon decreases with its wavelength. Thus, although the energy density of the universe is now dominated by matter, it was once dominated by radiation; poetically speaking, all was [[light]]. As the universe expanded, its energy density decreased and it became cooler; as it did so, the [[elementary particle]]s of matter could associate stably into ever larger combinations. Thus, in the early part of the matter-dominated era, stable [[proton]]s and [[neutron]]s formed, which then associated into [[atomic nuclei]]. At this stage, the matter in the universe was mainly a hot, dense [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] of negative [[electron]]s, neutral [[neutrino]]s and positive nuclei. [[Nuclear reaction]]s among the nuclei led to the present abundances of the lighter nuclei, particularly [[hydrogen]], [[deuterium]], and [[helium]]. Eventually, the electrons and nuclei combined to form stable atoms, which are transparent to most wavelengths of radiation; at this point, the radiation decoupled from the matter, forming the ubiquitous, isotropic background of microwave radiation observed today.

Other observations are not answered definitively by known physics. According to the prevailing theory, a slight imbalance of [[matter]] over [[antimatter]] was present in the universe's creation, or developed very shortly thereafter, possibly due to the [[CP violation]] that has been observed by [[particle physics|particle physicists]]. Although the matter and antimatter mostly annihilated one another, producing [[photon]]s, a small residue of matter survived, giving the present matter-dominated universe. Several lines of evidence also suggest that a rapid [[cosmic inflation]] of the universe occurred very early in its history (roughly 10&lt;sup&gt;−35&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after its creation). Recent observations also suggest that the [[cosmological constant]] (''Λ'') is not zero and that the net [[mass-energy]] content of the universe is dominated by a [[dark energy]] and [[dark matter]] that have not been characterized scientifically. They differ in their gravitational effects. Dark matter gravitates as ordinary matter does, and thus slows the expansion of the universe; by contrast, dark energy serves to accelerate the universe's expansion.

===Multiverse theory===

[[File:Multiverse - level II.svg|thumb|Depiction of a [[multiverse]] of seven [[bubble universe theory|&quot;bubble&quot; universes]], which are separate [[spacetime]] continua, each having different [[physical law]]s, [[physical constant]]s, and perhaps even different numbers of [[dimension]]s or [[topology|topologies]].]]

Some speculative theories have proposed that this universe is but one of a [[set (mathematics)|set]] of disconnected universes, collectively denoted as the [[multiverse]], challenging or enhancing more limited definitions of the universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;EllisKS03&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Munitz MK|year = 1959|title = One Universe or Many?|journal = Journal of the History of Ideas|volume = 12|pages = 231–255|doi = 10.2307/2707516|issue = 2|jstor = 2707516}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientific multiverse theories are distinct from concepts such as [[plane (esotericism)|alternate planes of consciousness]] and [[simulated reality]], although the idea of a larger universe is not new; for example, Bishop [[Étienne Tempier]] of Paris ruled in 1277 that God could create as many universes as he saw fit, a question that was being hotly debated by the French theologians.&lt;ref&gt;Misner, Thorne and Wheeler (1973), p.753.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Max Tegmark]] developed a four part [[multiverse#Tegmark's classification|classification scheme]] for the different types of multiverses that scientists have suggested in various problem domains. An example of such a theory is the [[bubble universe theory|chaotic inflation]] model of the early universe.&lt;ref name=&quot;chaotic_inflation&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author = Linde A.|year = 1986|title = Eternal chaotic inflation|journal = Mod.

Parallel worlds are generated in a manner similar to [[quantum superposition]] and [[decoherence]], with all states of the [[wave function]] being realized in separate worlds. Effectively, the multiverse evolves as a [[universal wavefunction]]. If the big bang that created our multiverse created an ensemble of multiverses, the wave function of the ensemble would be entangled in this sense.

The least controversial category of multiverse in Tegmark's scheme is [[multiverse#Level I: Beyond our cosmological horizon|Level I]], which describes distant space-time events &quot;in our own universe&quot;. If space is infinite, or sufficiently large and uniform, identical instances of the history of Earth's entire [[Hubble volume]] occur every so often, simply by chance. Tegmark calculated our nearest so-called [[doppelgänger]], is 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;115&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; meters away from us (a [[double exponential function]] larger than a [[googolplex]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;TegmarkPUstaple&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12701329|title=Parallel universes.

However, it does follow as a fairly straightforward consequence from otherwise unrelated scientific observations and theories. Tegmark suggests that statistical analysis exploiting the [[anthropic principle]] provides an opportunity to test multiverse theories in some cases. Generally, science would consider a multiverse theory that posits neither a common point of causation, nor the possibility of interaction between universes, to be an idle speculation.

==Shape of the universe==
{{Main|Shape of the universe}}

The shape or [[geometry]] of the universe includes both [[Shape of the universe#Local geometry (spatial curvature)|local geometry]] in the [[observable universe]] and [[Shape of the universe#Global geometry|global geometry]], which we may or may not be able to measure. Shape can refer to curvature and [[topology]]. More formally, the subject in practice investigates which [[3-manifold]] corresponds to the spatial section in [[comoving coordinates]] of the four-dimensional [[spacetime|space-time]] of the universe. Cosmologists normally work with a given [[space-like]] slice of spacetime called the [[Comoving distance|comoving coordinates]]. In terms of observation, the section of spacetime that can be observed is the backward [[light cone]] (points within the [[cosmic light horizon]], given time to reach a given observer). If the observable universe is smaller than the entire universe (in some models it is many orders of magnitude smaller), one cannot determine the global structure by observation: one is limited to a small patch.

Among the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric|Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker]] (FLRW) models, the presently most popular shape of the Universe found to fit observational data according to cosmologists is the infinite flat model,&lt;ref name=&quot;nasa_popular_uni_curv&quot;&gt;[http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov/universe/uni_shape.html Shape of the Universe], WMAP website at NASA.&lt;/ref&gt; while other FLRW models include the [[Homology sphere#Cosmology|Poincaré dodecahedral space]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Nat03&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last = Luminet|first = Jean-Pierre|authorlink = Jean-Pierre Luminet|coauthors = Jeff Weeks, Alain Riazuelo, Roland Lehoucq, Jean-Phillipe Uzan|title = Dodecahedral space topology as an explanation for weak wide-angle temperature correlations in the cosmic microwave background|journal = Nature|volume = 425|issue =6958|pages = 593–5 |date = 2003-10-09|arxiv = astro-ph/0310253|doi = 10.1038/nature01944|pmid = 14534579 |bibcode = 2003Natur.425..593L}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RBSG08&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last =Roukema|first =Boudewijn|coauthors = Zbigniew Buliński, Agnieszka Szaniewska, Nicolas E.

NASA released the first WMAP cosmic background radiation data in February 2003. In 2009 the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck observatory]] was launched to observe the microwave background at higher resolution than WMAP, possibly providing more information on the shape of the Universe. The data should be released in late 2012.
