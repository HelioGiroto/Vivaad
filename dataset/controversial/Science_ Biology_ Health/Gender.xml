Sexologist [[John Money]] introduced the terminological distinction between biological sex and [[gender role|gender as a role]] in 1955. Before his work, it was uncommon to use the word &quot;gender&quot; to refer to anything but [[grammatical gender|grammatical categories]].&lt;ref name=udry&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2061790 |first1=J.

Today, the distinction is strictly followed in some contexts, especially the [[social sciences]]&lt;ref name=&quot;socialsciencedictionary&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sociology.socialsciencedictionary.com/Sociology-Dictionary/GENDER | title=GENDER | publisher=Social Science Dictionary | accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pearsonhighered&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title=THE SOCIOLOGY OF GENDER | link=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0132448300.pdf | url=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/assets/hip/us/hip_us_pearsonhighered/samplechapter/0132448300.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and documents written by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO),&lt;ref name=&quot;www.who.int&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=What do we mean by &quot;sex&quot; and &quot;gender&quot;?| publisher=[[World Health Organization]]| accessdate= 2009-09-29|url=http://www.who.int/gender/whatisgender/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in many contexts, even in some areas of social sciences, the meaning of gender has expanded to include &quot;sex&quot; or even to replace the latter word.&lt;ref name=udry/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;haig&quot;/&gt; Although this gradual [[Semantic change|change in the meaning]] of gender can be traced to the 1980s, a small acceleration of the process in the scientific literature was observed when the [[Food and Drug Administration]] started to use &quot;gender&quot; instead of &quot;sex&quot; in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/58fr39406.htm Guideline for the Study and Evaluation of Gender Differences in the Clinical Evaluation of Drugs]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Gender&quot; is now commonly used even to refer to the [[physiology]] of non-human animals, without any implication of social gender roles.&lt;ref name=&quot;haig&quot;/&gt;

[[Gender studies]] has become a branch of the social sciences. 

In the English literature, the trichotomy between biological sex, psychological gender, and social sex role first appeared in a feminist paper on [[transsexualism]] in 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;haig&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yudkin, M. (1978). ''Transsexualism and women: A critical perspective''. Feminist Studies, 4(3), 97–106.&lt;/ref&gt; Some cultures have specific gender-related social roles that can be considered distinct from male and female, such as the [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]].

While the social sciences sometimes approach gender as a social construct, and gender studies particularly do, research in the [[natural science]]s investigates whether [[sex differences in humans|biological differences]] in males and females influence the development of gender in humans; both inform debate about how far biological differences influence the formation of gender identity.

==Etymology and usage==
The modern English word ''gender'' comes from the [[Middle English]] ''gendre'', a [[loanword]] from [[Norman conquest of England|Norman-conquest]]-era [[Old French]]. This, in turn, came from [[Latin]] ''[[:la:genus|genus]]''. Both words mean &quot;kind&quot;, &quot;type&quot;, or &quot;sort&quot;. They derive ultimately from a widely attested [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] (PIE) [[Root (linguistics)|root]] ''g&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;n-'',&lt;ref&gt;
[[Julius Pokorny]], [http://www.indo-european.nl/cgi-bin/response.cgi?root=leiden&amp;morpho=0&amp;basename=\data\ie\pokorny&amp;first=651 'gen'], in ''Indogermanisches etymologisches Wörterbuch'', (Bern: Francke, 1959, reprinted in 1989), pp. 373–75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE143.html 'gen&lt;sup&gt;ə&lt;/sup&gt;-'], in 'Appendix I: Indo-European Roots', to ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', Fourth Edition, (Boston: [[Houghton Mifflin|Houghton Mifflin Company]], 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
which is also the source of ''kin'', ''kind'', ''king'', and many other English words.&lt;ref&gt;
Your Dictionary.com, [http://www.yourdictionary.com/ahd/roots/zzg00600.html 'Gen'], reformatted from AHD.&lt;/ref&gt;
Most uses of derivatives of this root in Indo-European languages refer either directly to what pertains to birth (for example ''pre-gn-ant'') or, by extension, to natural, innate qualities and their consequent social distinctions
(for example ''gentry'', ''generation'', ''gentile'', ''genocide'' and ''eugenics'').
It appears in Modern [[French language|French]] in the word ''[[genre]]'' (type, kind, also ''[[:fr:genre sexuel|genre sexuel]]'') and is related to the [[Greek language|Greek]] root ''gen-'' (to produce), appearing in ''[[gene]]'', ''[[wikt:genesis|genesis]]'', and ''[[oxygen]]''.

The first edition of the [[Oxford English Dictionary]] (OED1, Volume 4, 1900) notes the original meaning of ''gender'' as &quot;kind&quot; had already become obsolete.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Gender''' (dʒe'ndəɹ), ''sb''. Also 4 gendre. [a. OF. ''gen(d)re'' (F. ''genre'') = Sp. ''género'', Pg. ''gênero'', It. ''genere'', ad. L. ''gener''- stem form of ''genus'' race, kind = Gr. γένος, Skr. ''jánas'':— OAryan *''genes''-, f. root γεν- to produce; cf. '''K&lt;small&gt;IN&lt;/small&gt;'''.]&lt;br /&gt;†'''1.''' Kind, sort, class; also, genus as opposed to species. ''The general gender'': the common sort (of people). ''Obs.''&lt;br /&gt;'''13..''' ''E.E.Allit. P.'' P. 434 Alle gendrez so ioyst wern ioyned wyth-inne.  ''c'' '''1384''' C&lt;small&gt;HAUSER&lt;/small&gt; ''H. Fame'''''*''' 1. 18 To knowe of hir signifiaunce The gendres.

The word was still widely attested, however, in the specific sense of [[grammatical gender]] (the assignment of nouns to categories such as ''masculine'', ''feminine'' and ''neuter''). According to [[Aristotle]], this concept was introduced by the Greek philosopher [[Protagoras]].
{{quote|{{lang|grc|τὰ γένη τῶν ὀνομάτων ἄρρενα καὶ θήλεα καὶ σκεύη}} The classes (''genē'') of the nouns are males, females and things. [[Rhetoric (Aristotle)|''The Technique of Rhetoric'']] III v&lt;ref&gt;{{quote|A fourth rule is to observe Protagoras' classification of nouns into male, female and inanimate.|[[Aristotle]]|[http://books.google.com/books?id=V_IMCohto0YC&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=%22A+fourth+rule+is+to+observe+Protagoras%27+classification+of+nouns+into+male,+female+and%22&amp;sig=Wg2rcesYtvK9vOmolAPnzKqjZaQ ''Rhetoric''], translated by William Rhys Roberts (1858–1929), (reprinted [[Dover Publications|Dover]], 2004), p.&amp;nbsp;297f. ISBN 978-0-486-43793-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1926, [[Henry Watson Fowler]] recommended that the word be restricted to this grammar-related meaning only:

{{quote|&quot;Gender...is a grammatical term only. To talk of persons...of the masculine or feminine g[ender], meaning of the male or female sex, is either a jocularity (permissible or not according to context) or a blunder.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
[[Fowler's Modern English Usage]], 1926: p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However examples of the use of ''gender'' to refer to [[masculinity]] and [[femininity]] as types are found throughout the history of [[Modern English]] (from about the 14th century).

*c. 1900: Our most lively impression is that the sun is there assumed to be of the feminine '''gender'''—[[Henry James]], ''Essays on Literature''.

As a verb, ''gender'' means &quot;breed&quot; in the [[King James Version of the Bible|King James Bible]]:
{{quote|Thou shalt not let thy cattle '''gender''' with a diverse kind|{{Bibleref|Leviticus|19:19}}|1616}}

The modern academic sense of the word, in the context of social roles of men and women, dates from the work of [[John Money]] (1955), and was popularized and developed by the [[feminist movement]] from the 1970s onwards (see {{p/s|Feminism theory and gender studies}} below). The theory was that human nature is essentially [[epicene]] and social distinctions based on sex are arbitrarily constructed. Matters pertaining to this theoretical process of social construction were labelled matters of ''gender''.

The popular use of ''gender'' simply as an alternative to ''[[sex]]'' (as a biological category) is also widespread, although attempts are still made to preserve the distinction. The [[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|American Heritage Dictionary]] (2000) uses the following two sentences to illustrate the difference, noting that the distinction &quot;is useful in principle, but it is by no means widely observed, and considerable variation in usage occurs at all levels.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;difference&quot;&gt;[http://www.bartleby.com/61/59/G0075900.html Usage note: ''Gender'',] ''The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language'', Fourth Edition, (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The effectiveness of the medication appears to depend on the '''sex''' ''(not gender)'' of the patient.&lt;br&gt;In peasant societies, '''gender''' ''(not sex)'' roles are likely to be more clearly defined.}}

In the last two decades of the 20th century, the use of ''gender'' in academia increased greatly, outnumbering uses of ''sex'' in the social sciences. While the spread of the word in science publications can be attributed to the influence of feminism, its use as a euphemism for sex is attributed to the failure to grasp the distinction made in feminist theory, and the distinction has sometimes become blurred with the theory itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;haig&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first1=David |last1=Haig |authorlink1=David Haig (biologist) |month=April |year=2004 |title=The Inexorable Rise of Gender and the Decline of Sex: Social Change in Academic Titles, 1945–2001 |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=87–96 |pmid=15146141 |doi=10.1023/B:ASEB.0000014323.56281.0d |url= http://www.oeb.harvard.edu/faculty/haig/publications_files/04inexorablerise.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; A recent Publication by the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]] on &quot;[[sexual orientation]] and [[gender identity]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hreoc.gov.au&quot;&gt;Australian Human Rights Commission (AHRC), [http://www.hreoc.gov.au/pdf/human_rights/lgbti/lgbticonsult/SOGIdiscussion_paper.pdf &quot;Protection from discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and sex and/or gender identity&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; uses &quot;sex and/or gender identity&quot; as a broad term to refer to diverse sex and/or gender identities and expressions, including being &quot;transgender, trans, transsexual and intersex. It also includes being androgynous, agender, a cross dresser, a drag king, a drag queen, genderfluid, genderqueer, intergender, neutrois, pansexual, pan-gendered, a third gender, and a third sex.

;Greek
[[Greek language|Greek]] distinguishes biological from sociological in adjectives.

In Greek, male biology and masculine grammatical inflection are denoted by ''arsenikos'' ({{lang|el|αρσενικός}}), in distinction to sociological masculinity, which is denoted by ''andrikos'' ({{lang|el|ανδρικός}}). Likewise, female biology and feminine grammatical inflection are denoted by ''thēlukos'' ([[:el:Θηλυκό|θηλυκός]]); and sociological femininity is denoted by ''gunaikeios'' ([[:el:Γυναίκα|γυναικείος]], compare English [[gynaecology]]). This distinction is at least as old as Aristotle (see above). It is a different distinction to English, where 'female' and 'male' refer to animals as well as humans, but not to grammatical categories; whereas, 'feminine' and 'masculine' refer to grammatical categories as well as humans, but not properly to animals, except as [[anthropomorphism]].

;German 
[[German language|German]] &lt;Geschlecht&gt; makes no distinction in nouns.

In English, both 'sex' and 'gender' can be used in contexts where they could not be substituted—'[[sexual intercourse]]', 'safe sex', 'sex worker', or on the other hand, 'grammatical gender'. Other languages, like German, use the same word, ''{{lang|de|Geschlecht}}'' or ''{{lang|nl|geslacht}}'', to refer not only to biological sex, but social differences as well, making a distinction between biological 'sex' and 'gender' identity difficult. In some contexts, German has adopted the English loanword ''Gender'' to achieve this distinction. Sometimes ''Geschlechtsidentität'' is used for 'gender' (although it literally means 'gender identity') and ''Geschlecht'' for 'sex'.&lt;ref&gt;
See translation of Judith Butler's ''Gender Trouble''&lt;/ref&gt;
More common is the use of modifiers: ''biologisches Geschlecht'' for 'biological sex', ''Geschlechtsidentität'' for 'gender identity' and ''Geschlechtsrolle'' for 'gender role', and so on.

;Swedish
Swedish makes clear distinction in nouns
*''genus''
*''kön''

In Swedish, 'gender' is translated with the linguistically cognate ''[[:sv:genus]]'', including sociological contexts, thus: ''Genusstudier'' (gender studies) and ''Genusvetenskap'' (gender science). 'Sex' in Swedish, however, only signifies sexual relations, and not the proposed English dichotomy, a concept for which ''{{lang|sv|kön}}'' (also from [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] ''g&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;n-'') is used. A common distinction is then made between ''kön'' (sex) and ''genus'' (gender), where the former refers only to biological sex. There are different opinions whether ''genus'' should involve biology, but within the ''genusvetenskap'', which is strongly influenced by [[feminism]], it usually does not.&lt;ref&gt;distinguishes&lt;/ref&gt; Sweden uses the words ''{{lang|sv|könsroller}}'' and ''{{lang|sv|könsidentitet}}'' (literally 'sex role' and 'sex-identity') for the English terms 'gender role' and 'gender identity'.

;French
French has no distinction in noun: &quot;''sexe''&quot;, but the distinction is supplied by the neologistic coinage &quot;''genre''&quot;.

In French, the word ''sexe'' is most widely used for both &quot;sex&quot; and &quot;gender&quot; in everyday contexts. However, the word ''genre'' is increasingly used to refer to gender in queer or academic contexts, such as the word ''transgenre'' ([[transgender]]) or the translation of [[Judith Butler]]'s book ''[[Gender Trouble]]'' as ''Trouble dans le genre''. The term ''identité sexuelle'' was proposed for &quot;gender&quot; or &quot;gender identity,&quot; although it can be confused with &quot;sexual identity&quot; (one's identity as it relates to one's sexual life).

==Gender identity==
{{main|Gender identity}}
[[Gender identity]] is the gender a person self-identifies as. One's biological sex is directly tied to specific social roles and expectations. The concept of being a woman is considered to have more challenges, owing not only to society's viewing women as a social category but also as a felt sense of self, a culturally conditioned or constructed subjective identity.&lt;ref&gt;Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity. Thinking Gender. New York &amp; London: Routledge, 1990&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;woman&quot; has chronically been used as a reference to and for the female body; this usage has been viewed as controversial by feminists, in the definition of &quot;woman&quot;. There are qualitative analyses that explore and present the representations of gender; feminists challenge the dominant ideologies concerning gender roles and sex. Social identity refers to the common identification with a [[collectivity]] or social category that creates a common culture among participants concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Snow, D.A. and Oliver, P.E. (1995). &quot;Social Movements and Collective Behavior: Social Psychological Dimensions and Considerations.&quot; In Karen Cook, Gary A.Fine, and James S.House (eds) Sociological Perspectives on Social Psychology, pp.571–600. Boston: Allyn and Bacon.&lt;/ref&gt; According to social identity theory,&lt;ref&gt;Taifel, H. &amp; Turner, J.C. (1986). The social identity of intergroup relations. In S. Worchel &amp; W.G. Austin (eds), The psychology of intergroup relations, pp.7–24. Chicago: Nelson-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; an important component of the self-concept is derived from memberships in social groups and categories; this is demonstrated by group processes and how inter-group relationships impact significantly on individuals' self perception and behaviors. The groups people belong to therefore provide members with the definition of who they are and how they should behave in the social sphere.&lt;ref&gt;Terry, D.J., Hogg, M.A. (1996). Group norms and the attitude-behavior relationship: A role for group identification. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin, 22, 776–793.&lt;/ref&gt;

Categorizing males and females into [[social role]]s creates binaries in which individuals feel they have to be at one end of a linear spectrum and must identify themselves as man or woman. Globally, communities interpret biological differences between men and women to create a set of social expectations that define the behaviors that are &quot;appropriate&quot; for men and women and determine women’s and men’s different access to rights, resources, power in society and even health behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;Galdas P. M. Johnson J.L. Percy M.E. and Ratner P.R. (2010) Help seeking for cardiac symptoms: Beyond the masculine-feminine binary Social Science &amp; Medicine 71;1 18–24&lt;/ref&gt; Although the specific nature and degree of these differences vary from one society to the next, they typically favor men, creating an imbalance in power and gender inequalities in all countries.&lt;ref&gt;Winnie Byanyima's sabbatical period at the African Gender Institute, University of Cape Town : narrative report.http://idl-bnc.idrc.ca/dspace/handle/123456789/27243,2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

Western philosopher [[Michel Foucault]], claimes that as sexual subjects, humans are the object of power, which is not an institution or structure, rather it is a signifier or name attributed to &quot;complex strategical situation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Tong, Rosemarie.Feminist thought : a more comprehensive introduction / Rosemarie Tong.Boulder, Colo. : Westview Press, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, &quot;power&quot; is what determines individual attributes, behaviors, etc. and people are a part of an ontologically and epistemologically constructed set of names and labels. Such as, being female characterizes one as a woman, and being a woman signifies one as weak, emotional, and irrational, and is incapable of actions attributed to a &quot;man&quot;. [[Judith Butler]] said that gender and sex are more like verbs than nouns. She reasoned that her actions are limited because she is female. &quot;I am not permitted to construct my gender and sex willy-nilly,&quot; she said.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}} &quot;[This] is so because gender is politically and therefore socially controlled.

===Social assignment and the idea of gender fluidity===
{{See also|Sex assignment}}
According to Kate Bornstein, gender can have ambiguity and fluidity.&lt;ref&gt;Gender Outlaw – On Men, Women and the rest of us, pg. 51–52&lt;/ref&gt; There are two contrasting ideas regarding the definition of gender, and the intersection of both of them is definable as below:

The [[World Health Organization]] defines gender as the result of socially constructed ideas about the behavior, actions, and roles a particular sex performs.&lt;ref name=www.who.int/&gt; The beliefs, values and attitude taken up and exhibited by them is as per the agreeable norms of the society and the personal opinions of the person is not taken into the primary consideration of assignment of gender and imposition of gender roles as per the assigned gender.&lt;ref name=www.who.int/&gt; Intersections and crossing of the prescribed boundaries have no place in the arena of the social construct of the term &quot;gender&quot;.

The assignment of gender involves taking into account the physiological and biological attributes assigned by nature followed by the imposition of the socially constructed conduct. The social label of being classified into one or the other sex is obligatory to the medical stamp on the birth certificate. The cultural traits typically coupled to a particular sex finalize the assignment of gender and the biological differences that play a role in classifying either sex is interchangeable with the definition of gender within the social context.

In this context, the socially constructed rules are at a cross road with the assignment of a particular gender to a person. Gender ambiguity deals with having the freedom to choose, manipulate and create a personal niche within any defined socially constructed code of conduct while gender fluidity is outlawing all the rules of cultural gender assignment. It does not accept the prevalence of two rigidly defined genders &quot;Female and Male&quot; and believes in freedom to choose any kind of gender with no rules, no defined boundaries and no fulfilling of expectations associated with any particular gender.

Both these definitions are facing opposite directionalities with their own defined set of rules and criteria on which the said systems are based.


===Social categories===
[[File:Mollcutpurse.jpg|thumb|[[Mary Frith]] (&quot;Moll Cutpurse&quot;) scandalised 17th century society by wearing male clothing, smoking in public, and otherwise defying gender roles.]]
Sexologist John Money [[Neologism|coined the term]] ''gender role'' in 1955. The term ''[[gender role]]'' means those things people say or do to disclose their status of boy or man, girl or woman, respectively. It includes, but is not restricted to, sexuality in the sense of eroticism.&lt;ref&gt;
John Money, &quot;Hermaphroditism, gender and precocity in hyperadrenocorticism: Psychologic findings', ''Bulletin of the Johns Hopkins Hospital'' '''96''' (1955): 253–264.&lt;/ref&gt;
Elements of such a role include clothing, speech patterns, movement, occupations, and other factors not limited to biological sex. Because social aspects of gender can normally be presumed to be the ones of interest in sociology and closely related disciplines, ''gender role'' is often abbreviated to ''gender'' in their literature.

Most societies have only two distinct, broad classes of gender roles, masculine and feminine, that correspond with the biological sexes of male and female. However, some societies explicitly incorporate people who adopt the gender role opposite to their biological sex, for example the [[Two-Spirit]] people of some indigenous American peoples. Other societies include well-developed roles that are explicitly considered more or less distinct from archetypal female and male roles in those societies. In the language of the [[sociology of gender]] they comprise a [[third gender]],&lt;ref&gt;

===Measurement of gender identity===
Early gender identity research hypothesized a single bipolar dimension of masculinity-femininity—that is masculinity and femininity were opposites on one continuum. As societal stereotypes changed, however, assumptions of the unidimensional model were challenged. This led to the development of a two-dimensional gender identity model, in which masculinity and femininity were conceptualized as two separate, orthogonal dimensions, coexisting in varying degrees within an individual. This conceptualization on femininity and masculinity remains the accepted standard today.&lt;ref&gt;Palan, K. (2001) Gender Identity in Consumer Research: A Literature Review and Research Agenda. ''Academy of Marketing Science Review''&lt;/ref&gt;

Two instruments incorporating the multidimensional of masculinity and femininity have dominated gender identity research: The Bem Sex Role Inventory (BSRI) and the Personal Attributes Questionnaire (PAQ). Both instruments categorize individuals as either being sex typed (males report themselves as identifying primarily with masculine traits, females report themselves as identifying primarily with feminine traits), cross sex-typed (males report themselves as identifying primarily with feminine traits, females report themselves as identifying primarily with masculine traits), androgynous (either males or females who report themselves as high on both masculine and feminine traits) or undifferentiated (either males or females who report themselves as low on both masculine and feminine traits).&lt;ref&gt;Palan, K. (2001) Gender Identity in Consumer Research: A Literature Review and Research Agenda. ''Academy of Marketing Science Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; Twenge (1997) noted that, although men are generally more masculine than women and women generally more feminine than men, the association between biological sex and masculinity/femininity is waning.&lt;ref&gt;Twenge, J. M. (1997). Changes in masculine and feminine traits over
time: A meta-analysis. Sex Roles, 36, 305–325.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feminism theory and gender studies===
Biologist and feminist academic [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]] rejects the discourse of biological versus social determinism and advocates a deeper analysis of how interactions between the biological being and the social environment influence individuals' capacities.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Fausto-Sterling, ''Myths of Gender: Biological Theories about Men and Women'' (New York: Basic Books, 1992), 8.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosopher and feminist [[Simone de Beauvoir]] applied [[existentialism]] to women's experience of life: &quot;One is not born a woman, one becomes one.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Simone de Beauvoir, ''The Second Sex'', 1949, as translated and reprinted 1989.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; In context, this is a philosophical statement.  However, it may be analyzed in terms of biology—a girl must pass [[puberty]] to become a woman—and sociology, as a great deal of mature relating in social contexts is learned rather than instinctive. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Within [[feminist theory]], terminology for gender issues developed over the 1970s. In the 1974 edition of ''Masculine/Feminine or Human'',
the author uses &quot;innate gender&quot; and &quot;learned sex roles&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;
Chafetz, JS. ''Masculine/Feminine or Human? An Overview of the Sociology of Sex Roles''. Itasca, Illinois: F. E. Peacock, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;
but in the 1978 edition, the use of ''sex'' and ''gender'' is reversed.&lt;ref&gt;
Chafetz, JS. ''Masculine/Feminine or Human? An Overview of the Sociology of Sex Roles''. Itasca, Illinois: F. E. Peacock, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1980, most feminist writings had agreed on using ''gender'' only for socioculturally adapted [[trait theory|traits]].

In [[gender studies]] the term ''gender'' refers to proposed social and cultural constructions of masculinities and femininities. In this context, ''gender'' explicitly excludes reference to biological differences, to focus on cultural differences.&lt;ref&gt;Stephanie Garrett, ''Gender'', (1992), p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; This emerged from a number of different areas: in sociology during the 1950s; from the theories of the psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan#Lacan and his discontents|Jacques Lacan]]; and in the work of French psychoanalysts like [[Julia Kristeva]], [[Luce Irigaray]], and American feminists such as [[Judith Butler]]. Those who followed Butler came to regard gender roles as a practice, sometimes referred to as &quot;[[performative]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Butler, ''Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity'', (1999), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles E. Hurst|Hurst]] states that some people think sex will, &quot;...automatically determine one’s gender demeanor and role (social) as well as one’s [[sexual orientation]] (sexual attractions and behavior).&quot;fername=&quot;Hurst141&quot;&gt;[Hurst, C. Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences. Sixth Edition. 2007. 131, 139–142]&lt;/ref&gt; Gender sociologists believe that people have [[cultural]] origins and habits for dealing with gender. For example, Michael Schwalbe believes that humans must be taught how to act appropriately in their designated gender to properly fill the role, and that the way people behave as masculine or feminine interacts with social expectations. Schwalbe comments that humans &quot;are the results of many people embracing and acting on similar ideas&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[Schwalbe, M.  The Sociologically Examined Life: Pieces of the Conversation Third Edition. 2005. 22–23]&lt;/ref&gt; People do this through everything from [[clothing]] and hairstyle to relationship and employment choices. Schwalbe believes that these distinctions are important, because society wants to identify and categorize people as soon as we see them. They need to place people into distinct categories to know how we should feel about them.

Hurst comments that in a society where we present our genders so distinctly, there can often be severe consequences for breaking these cultural norms. Many of these consequences are rooted in [[discrimination]] based on sexual orientation. Gays and lesbians are often discriminated against in our legal system due to societal prejudices.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Hurst describes how this discrimination works against people for breaking gender norms, no matter what their sexual orientation is. He says that &quot;courts often confuse sex, gender, and sexual orientation, and confuse them in a way that results in denying the rights not only of gays and lesbians, but also of those who do not present themselves or act in a manner traditionally expected of their sex&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hurst141&quot;&gt;[Hurst, C. Social Inequality: Forms, Causes, and Consequences. Sixth Edition. 2007. 131, 139–142]&lt;/ref&gt; This prejudice plays out in our legal system when a man or woman is judged differently because he or she does not present the &quot;correct&quot; gender.

== Gender roles ==
{{main|Gender role}}
Gender roles refer to the set of social and behavioral norms considered socially appropriate for individuals of a specific sex in the context of a specific culture, and differ widely between cultures and historical periods. There are differences of opinion as to whether observed differences in behavior and personality between genders are entirely due to cultural or social factors, and are therefore the product of socialization, or to what extent gender differences are due to biological and physiological differences.

{{Refimprove section|date=May 2010}}
The [[sexual dimorphism#Psychological and behavioral differentiation|biology of gender]] became the subject of an expanding number of studies over the course of the late 20th century. One of the earliest areas of interest was what is now called [[gender identity disorder]] (GID). Studies in this, and related areas, inform the following summary of the subject by [[John Money]], a pioneer and controversial sex and gender researcher. He stated:

{{quote|The term &quot;gender role&quot; appeared in print first in 1955. The term &quot;gender identity&quot; was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. The definitions of gender and gender identity vary on a doctrinal basis. In popularized and scientifically debased usage, sex is what you are biologically; gender is what you become socially; gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness; and gender role is the cultural stereotype of what is masculine and feminine. Causality with respect to gender identity disorder is subdivisible into genetic, prenatal hormonal, postnatal social, and postpubertal hormonal determinants, but there is, as yet, no comprehensive and detailed theory of causality. Gender coding in the brain is bipolar. In gender identity disorder, there is discordancy between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Money]], 'The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years', ''Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy'' '''20''' (1994): 163–77.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Money refers to attempts to distinguish a difference between biological sex and social gender as &quot;scientifically debased&quot;, because of our increased knowledge of a continuum of [[sexual dimorphism|dimorphic]] features (Money's word is &quot;dipolar&quot;) that link biological and behavioral differences. These extend from the exclusively biological &quot;genetic&quot; and &quot;prenatal hormonal&quot; differences between men and women, to &quot;postnatal&quot; features, some of which are social, but others have been shown to result from &quot;postpubertal hormonal&quot; effects.

Although causation from the biological—[[Genetics|genetic]] and [[Sex steroids|hormonal]]—to the behavioural has been broadly demonstrated and accepted, Money is careful to also note that understanding of the causal chains from biology to behaviour in sex and gender issues is very far from complete. For example, the existence of a &quot;[[Biology and sexual orientation|gay gene]]&quot; has not been proven, but such a gene remains an acknowledged possibility.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Abrams, [http://discovermagazine.com/2007/jun/born-gay/article_view?b_start:int=0&amp;-C= 'The Real Story on Gay Genes: Homing in on the science of homosexuality—and sexuality itself',] ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' '''June''' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

There are studies concerning women who have a diagnosis called [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]], which leads to the overproduction of masculinizing sex [[hormone]]s, [[androgen]]s. These women usually have normal female appearances (though nearly all girls with CAH have corrective surgery performed on their genitals) but despite of hormone-balancing medication that they are given since birth, they are statistically more likely to be interested in activities traditionally linked to males than females.  Psychology professor and CAH researcher Dr. Sheri Berenbaum attributes these differences to exposure to higher levels of male sex hormones in utero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Sexual reproduction===
{{cleanup|section|date=May 2010}}
{{Main|Sexual reproduction}}
{{quote|Sexual differentiation demands the fusion of gametes that are morphologically different.|[[C. D. Darlington|Cyril Dean Darlington]]|''Recent Advances in Cytology'', 1937.}}
[[File:Hoverflies mating midair.jpg|thumb|[[Hoverfly|Hoverflies]] mating]]

[[Sexual reproduction]] is a common method of producing a new individual within various [[species]]. In sexually reproducing species, individuals produce special kinds of [[Cell (biology)|cell]]s (called ''[[gamete]]s'') whose function is specifically to fuse with one ''unlike'' gamete and thereby to form a new individual. This fusion of two unlike gametes is called [[fertilization]]. By convention, where one type of gamete cell is physically larger than the other, it is associated with female sex. Thus an individual that produces exclusively large gametes ([[ovum|ova]] in humans) is called ''female'', and one that produces exclusively small gametes ([[Spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] in humans) is called ''male''.

An individual that produces both types of gametes is called ''hermaphrodite'' (a name applicable also to people with one testis and one ovary). In some species hermaphrodites can self-fertilize (see [[Self-pollination|Selfing]]), in others they can achieve fertilization with females, males or both. Some species, like the Japanese Ash, ''[[Fraxinus lanuginosa]]'', only have males and hermaphrodites, a rare reproductive system called ''[[androdioecy]]''. [[Gynodioecy]] is also found in several species. Human hermaphrodites are typically, but not always, infertile.

What is considered defining of sexual reproduction is the ''difference'' between the gametes and the ''binary'' nature of fertilization. Multiplicity of gamete ''types'' within a species would still be considered a form of sexual reproduction. However, of more than 1.5 million living species,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/info/tables/table1 'RedList'], ''International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources'' official website.&lt;/ref&gt;
recorded up to about the year 2000, &quot;no third sex cell—and so no third sex—has appeared in multicellular animals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

One hypothesis is that the species is a [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]], evolved from two closely related preceding species.

Fossil records indicate that sexual reproduction has been occurring for at least one billion years.&lt;ref&gt;
Leslie E. Orgel, [http://proxy.arts.uci.edu/~nideffer/Hawking/early_proto/orgel.html 'The Origin of Life on the Earth',] ''Scientific American'' October, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the reason for the initial evolution of sex, and the reason it has survived to the present are still matters of debate, there are many plausible theories. It appears that the ability to reproduce sexually has evolved independently in various species on many occasions. There are cases where it has also been lost, notably among the [[Fungi Imperfecti]].&lt;ref&gt;

===Gender taxonomy===
The following systematic list ([[gender taxonomy]]) illustrates the kinds of diversity that have been studied and reported in medical literature. It is placed in roughly chronological order of biological and social development in the human [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]. The earlier stages are more purely biological and the latter are more dominantly social. Causation is known to operate from chromosome to gonads, and from gonads to hormones. It is also significant from brain structure to gender identity (see Money quote above). Brain structure and processing (biological) that may explain erotic preference (social), however, is an area of ongoing research. Terminology in some areas changes quite rapidly to accommodate the constantly growing knowledge base.

=== Sexual dimorphism ===
{{See also|Sexual differentiation|Sexual dimorphism|Sex differences in humans}}
[[File:Peacock courting peahen.jpg|thumb|Sexual differentiation in [[peafowl]]]]
Although sexual reproduction is ''defined'' at the cellular level, key features of sexual reproduction operate ''within'' the structures of the gamete cells themselves. Notably, gametes carry very long molecules called [[DNA]] that the biological processes of reproduction can &quot;read&quot; like a book of instructions. In fact, there are typically many of these &quot;books&quot;, called ''chromosomes''. Human gametes usually have 23 chromosomes, 22 of which are common to both sexes. The final chromosomes in the two human gametes are called ''sex'' chromosomes because of their role in [[Sex-determination systems|sex determination]]. [[Ovum|Ova]] always have the same sex chromosome, labelled ''[[X chromosome|X]]''. About half of [[spermatozoa]] also have this same X chromosome, the rest have a [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]]. At fertilization the gametes fuse to form a cell, usually with 46 chromosomes, and either XX female or XY male, depending on whether the sperm carried an X or a Y chromosome. Some of the other possibilities are listed [[Gender#Gender taxonomy|above]].

In humans, the &quot;[[Default (computer science)|default]]&quot; processes of reproduction result in an individual with female characteristics. An intact Y-chromosome contains what is needed to &quot;reprogram&quot; the processes sufficiently to produce male characteristics, leading to [[sexual differentiation]]. Part of the Y-chromosome, the [[SRY|Sex-determining Region Y]] (SRY), causes what would normally become ovaries to become testes. These, in turn, produce male hormones called ''androgens''. However, several points in the processes have been identified where variations can result in people with atypical characteristics, including atypical sexual characteristics. Terminology for atypical sexual characteristics has not stabilized. ''[[Disorder of sexual development]]'' (DSD) is used by some in preference to ''[[Intersexuality|intersex]]'', which is used by others in preference to ''[[pseudohermaphroditism]]''.

[[Androgen insensitivity syndrome]] (AIS) is an example of a DSD that also illustrates that female development is the default for humans. Although having one X and one Y chromosome, some people are biologically insensitive to the androgens produced by their testes. As a result, they follow the normal human processes that results in a female. Women who are XY report identifying as a woman—feeling and thinking like a woman—and, where their biology is ''completely'' insensitive to [[masculinization|masculinizing]] factors, externally they look identical to other women. Unlike other women, however, they cannot produce ova, because they do not have ovaries.

The human [[XY sex-determination system|XY system]] is not the only sex determination system. Birds typically have a reverse, ZW system—males are ZZ and females ZW.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Whether male or female birds influence the sex of offspring is not known for all species. Several species of [[butterfly]] are known to have female parent sex determination.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The speciose insect order Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) and their closest relatives, Trichoptera (caddis flies), share a female-heterogametic sex chromosome system.&quot;

== Gender studies ==
{{main|Gender studies}}
[[Gender studies]] is a [[Field of study|field]] of [[interdisciplinary]] study and [[List of academic disciplines|academic field]] devoted to gender, [[gender identity]] and gendered [[Representation (politics)|representation]] as central categories of analysis. This field includes [[Women's studies]] (concerning [[women]], [[feminity]], their [[gender role]]s and politics, and [[feminism]]), [[Men's studies]] (concerning [[men]], [[masculinity]], their [[gender role]]s, and politics), and [[LGBT studies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;whitman&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.whitman.edu/content/genderstudies | title=Gender Studies | publisher=Whitman College | accessdate=02 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sometimes Gender studies is offered together with Study of [[Human sexuality|Sexuality]].
These disciplines study gender and sexuality in the fields of literature and language, [[history]], [[political science]], [[sociology]], [[anthropology]], [[cinema studies|cinema]] and [[media studies]], human development, law, and medicine.&lt;ref name=&quot;uchicago&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gendersexuality.uchicago.edu/about/ | title=About - Center for the Study of Gender and Sexuality (CSGS) | publisher=[[The University of Chicago]] | accessdate=02 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General studies==
===Genes===
[[File:Lightmatter chimp.jpg|thumb|[[Chimpanzee]]]]
{{main|XY sex-determination system}}
Chromosomes were likened to books (above), also like books they have been studied at more detailed levels. They contain &quot;sentences&quot; called ''genes''. In fact, many of these sentences are common to multiple species. Sometimes they are organized in the same order, other times they have been &quot;edited&quot;—deleted, copied, changed, moved, even relocated to another &quot;book&quot;, as species evolve. Genes are a particularly important part of understanding biological processes because they are directly associated with observable objects, outside chromosomes, called ''[[protein]]s'', whose influence on cell [[chemistry]] can be measured. In some cases genes can also be directly associated with differences clear to the naked eye, like eye-color itself. Some of these differences are sex specific, like hairy ears. The &quot;hairy ear&quot; gene might be found on the Y chromosome,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=425500 Online Mendelian Inheritance of Man], HAIRY EARS, Y-LINKED, although see [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/dispomim.cgi?id=139500 HAIRY EARS].&lt;/ref&gt; which explains why only men tend to have hairy ears. However, [[sex-limited genes]] on ''any'' chromosome can be expressed and &quot;say&quot;, for example, &quot;''if'' you are in a male body do X, otherwise do not.&quot; The same principle explains why [[chimpanzee]]s and humans are distinct, despite sharing nearly all their genes.

The study of genetics is particularly inter-disciplinary. It is relevant to almost every biological science. It is investigated in detail by molecular level sciences, and itself contributes details to high level abstractions like evolutionary theory.

===Brains===
[[File:Brain chrischan.jpg|thumb|[[Human brain]]]]
&quot;It is well established that men have a larger cerebrum than women by about 8–10% (Filipek et al., 1994; Nopoulos et al.,
2000; Passe et al., 1997a,b; Rabinowicz et al., 1999; Witelson et al., 1995).&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Haier&quot;&gt;Richard J Haier, Rex E Jung and others, [http://uit.no/getfile.php?PageId=1935&amp;FileId=467 'The Neuroanatomy of General Intelligence: Sex Matters',] ''[[NeuroImage]]'' '''25''' (2005): 320–327. Page 324 for cerebrum difference of 8–10%.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

However, what is functionally relevant are differences in composition and &quot;wiring&quot;. [[Richard J. Haier]] and colleagues at the universities of [[University of New Mexico|New Mexico]] and [[University of California, Irvine|California (Irvine)]] found, using [[brain mapping]], that men have more [[grey matter]] related to general [[intelligence]] than women, and women have about more [[white matter]] related to intelligence than men - the ratio between grey and white matter is 4% higher for men than women.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J Haier, Rex E Jung and others, [http://uit.no/getfile.php?PageId=1935&amp;FileId=467 'The Neuroanatomy of General Intelligence: Sex Matters',] ''[[NeuroImage]]'' '''25''' (2005): 320–327.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gray matter is used for information processing, while white matter consists of the connections between processing centers. Other differences are measurable but less pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;
Carol A. Tamminga, [http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/156/3/352 'Brain Development, XI: Sexual Dimorphism'], ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]'' '''156''' (1999): 352.&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of these differences are produced by hormonal activity, ultimately derived from the Y chromosome and sexual differentiation. However, differences that arise directly from gene activity have also been observed.
{{quote|A sexual dimorphism in levels of [[Gene expression|expression]] in brain [[Biological tissue|tissue]] was observed by [[Quantitative research|quantitative]] [[Real-time computing|real-time]] [[Polymerase chain reaction|PCR]], with females presenting an up to 2-fold excess in the abundance of PCDH11X [[Gene transcription|transcripts]]. We relate these findings to sexually dimorphic [[Trait (biology)|traits]] in the human brain.

It has also been demonstrated that brain processing responds to the external environment. Learning, both of ideas and behaviors, appears to be coded in brain processes. It also appears that in several simplified cases this coding operates differently, but in some ways equivalently, in the brains of men and women.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Even when men and women do the same chores equally well, they may use different brain circuits to get the same result.&quot; Linda Marsha, [http://discovermagazine.com/2007/brain/she-thinks 'He Thinks, She Thinks',] ''[[Discover (magazine)|Discover]]'' '''July''' (2007).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, both men and women learn and use language; however, [[Biochemistry|bio-chemically]], they appear to process it differently. Differences in female and male use of language are likely reflections ''both'' of biological preferences and aptitudes, ''and'' of learned patterns.

Two of the main fields that study brain structure, biological (and other) causes and behavioral (and other) results are brain [[neurology]] and biological psychology. [[Cognitive science]] is another important discipline in the field of brain research.

===Society and behaviors===
{{See also|Sex and psychology}}
Many of the more complicated human behaviors are influenced by both innate factors and by environmental ones, which include everything from genes, gene expression, and body chemistry, through diet and social pressures. A large area of research in [[behavioralism|behavioral psychology]] collates evidence in an effort to discover [[correlation]]s between behavior and various possible antecedents such as genetics, gene regulation, access to food and vitamins, culture, gender, hormones, physical and social development, and physical and social environments.

A core research area within sociology is the way human behavior operates on ''itself'', in other words, how the behavior of one group or individual influences the behavior of other groups or individuals. Starting in the late 20th century, the feminist movement has contributed extensive study of gender and theories about it, notably within sociology but not restricted to it.

[[File:The Defence of Saragossa.jpg|thumb|300px| Spain's desperate situation when invaded by [[Napoleon]] enabled [[Agustina de Aragón]] to break into a closely guarded male preserve and become the only female professional [[officer (military)|officer]] in the [[Spanish Army]] of her time (and long afterwards).]]
Social theorists have sought to determine the specific nature of gender in relation to biological sex and sexuality,{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} with the result being that culturally established gender and sex have become interchangeable identifications that signify the allocation of a specific 'biological' sex within a categorical gender.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The second wave feminist view that gender is socially constructed and hegemonic in all societies, remains current in some literary theoretical circles, Kira Hall and Mary Bucholtz publishing new perspectives as recently as 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Contemporary socialisation theory proposes the notion that when a child is first born it has a biological sex but no social gender.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} As the child grows, &quot;...society provides a string of prescriptions, templates, or models of behaviors appropriate to the one sex or the other,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Connell, R 1987, Gender &amp; Power, Polity Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt; which socialises the child into belonging to a culturally specific gender.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} There is huge incentive for a child to concede to their socialisation{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} with gender shaping the individual’s opportunities for education, work, family, sexuality, reproduction, authority,{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} and to make an impact on the production of culture and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, J &amp; Farrell, S (eds.) 1991, The Social Construction of Gender, Sage, Newbury Park.&lt;/ref&gt; Adults who do not perform these ascribed roles are perceived from this perspective as deviant and improperly socialised.&lt;ref&gt;Wearing, B 1996, Gender: The Pain and Pleasure of Difference, Longman, Melbourne.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some believe society is constructed in a way that splits gender into a dichotomy via social organisations that constantly invent and reproduce cultural images of gender. Joan Ackner (''The Gendered Society Reader'') believes gendering occurs in at least five different interacting social processes:&lt;ref&gt;
Acker, J 2000, ‘Hierarchies, Jobs, Bodies: A Theory of Gendered Organizations’, in M Kimmel with A Aronson (eds), The Gendered Society Reader, Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

*The construction of divisions along the lines of gender, such as those produced by labor, power, family, the state, even allowed behaviors and locations in physical space
*The construction of symbols and images such as language, ideology, dress and the media, that explain, express and    reinforce, or sometimes oppose, those divisions
*Interactions between men and women, women and women and men and men that involve any form of dominance and submission.  Conversational theorists, for example, have studied   the way that interruptions, turn taking and the setting of topics re-create gender inequality in the flow of ordinary talk
*The way that the preceding three processes help to produce gendered components of individual identity, i.e., the way  they create and maintain an image of a gendered self
*Gender is implicated in the fundamental, ongoing processes of creating and conceptualising social structures.

Looking at gender through a Foucauldian lens, gender is transfigured into a vehicle for the social division of power.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Gender difference is merely a construct of society used to enforce the distinctions made between what is assumed to be female and male,{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} and allow for the domination of masculinity over femininity through the attribution of specific gender-related characteristics.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} &quot;The idea that men and women are more different from one another than either is from anything else, must come from something other than nature… far from being an expression of natural differences, exclusive gender identity is the suppression of natural similarities.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Glover &amp; Kaplan, 2000, p. xxi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender conventions play a large role in attributing masculine and feminine characteristics to a fundamental biological sex.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} Socio-cultural codes and conventions, the rules by which society functions, and which are both a creation of society as well as a constituting element of it, determine the allocation of these specific traits to the sexes. These traits provide the foundations for the creation of hegemonic gender difference. It follows then, that gender can be assumed as the acquisition and internalisation of social norms. Individuals are therefore socialised through their receipt of society’s expectations of ‘acceptable’ gender attributes that are flaunted within institutions such as the family, the state and the media. Such a notion of ‘gender’ then becomes naturalised into a person’s sense of self or identity, effectively imposing a gendered social category upon a sexed body.&lt;ref&gt;Glover, D &amp; Kaplan, C 2000, Genders, Routledge, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

The conception that people are gendered rather than sexed also coincides with Judith Butler’s theories of gender performativity. Butler argues that gender is not an expression of what one is, but rather something that one does.&lt;ref&gt;Lloyd, M 1999, ‘Performativity, Parody, Politics’ in CULT 19016 Contemporary Modes of Culture Resource Materials, Central Queensland University, Rockhampton.&lt;/ref&gt; It follows then, that if gender is acted out in a repetitive manner it is in fact re-creating and effectively embedding itself within the social consciousness. Contemporary sociological reference to male and female gender roles typically uses ''masculinities'' and ''femininities'' in the plural rather than singular, suggesting diversity both within cultures as well as across them.

From the evidence, it can only be concluded that gender is socially constructed{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} and each individual is unique in their gender characteristics, regardless of which biological sex they are, as every child is socialised to behave a certain way and have the ‘proper’ gender attributes. If individuals in society do not conform to this pressure, they are destined to be treated as abnormal; therefore it is personally greatly beneficial for them to cooperate in the determined ‘correct’ ordering of the world.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} In fact, the very construct of society is a product of and produces gender norms. There is bias in applying the word ‘gender’ to anyone in a finite way; rather each person is endowed with certain gender characteristics.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}} The world cannot be egalitarian while there are ‘assigned’ genders and individuals are not given the right to express any gender characteristic they desire. {{POV-statement|date=October 2011}}

The difference between the sociological and popular definitions of gender involve a different dichotomy and focus. For example, the sociological approach to &quot;gender&quot; (social roles: female versus male) focuses on the difference in (economic/ power) position between a male CEO (disregarding the fact that he is [[heterosexual]] or [[Homosexuality|homosexual]]) to female workers in his employ (disregarding whether they are straight or gay). However the popular sexual self-conception approach (self-conception: gay versus straight) focuses on the different self-conceptions and social conceptions of those who are gay/straight, in comparison with those who are straight (disregarding what might be vastly differing economic and power positions between female and male groups in each category). There is then, in relation to definition of and approaches to &quot;gender&quot;, a tension between historic feminist sociology and contemporary homosexual sociology.&lt;ref&gt;See for example http://www.jstor.org/pss/201865&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
A person's sex as male or female has legal significance—sex is indicated on government documents, and laws provide differently for men and women. Many pension systems have different retirement ages for men or women. Marriage is usually only available to opposite-sex couples.

The question then arises as to what legally determines whether someone is female or male. In most cases this can appear obvious, but the matter is complicated for [[intersexual]] or [[transgender]] people. Different jurisdictions have adopted different answers to this question. Almost all countries permit changes of legal gender status in cases of intersexualism, when the gender assignment made at birth is determined upon further investigation to be biologically inaccurate—technically, however, this is not a change of status ''[[wikt:per se|per se]]''. Rather, it is recognition of a status deemed to exist but unknown from birth. Increasingly, jurisdictions also provide a procedure for changes of legal gender for transgendered people.

[[Sex assignment|Gender assignment]], when there are indications that genital sex might not be decisive in a particular case, is normally not defined by a single definition, but by a combination of conditions, including chromosomes and gonads. Thus, for example, in many jurisdictions a person with XY chromosomes but female [[gonads]] could be recognized as female at birth.

The ability to [[Legal aspects of transsexualism|change legal gender]] for transgender people in particular has given rise to the phenomena in some jurisdictions of the same person having different genders for the purposes of different areas of the law. For example, in Australia prior to the Re Kevin decisions, transsexual people could be recognized as having the genders they identified with under many areas of the law, including social security law, but not for the law of marriage. Thus, for a period, it was possible for the same person to have two different genders under Australian law.

It is also possible in federal systems for the same person to have one gender under state law and a different gender under federal law.

The first person of &quot;neutral&quot; gender (that is, neither man or woman in legal terms) is [[Norrie May-Welby]], from Australia, whose status was set on March, 2010.

===Gender and development===
Gender, and particularly the role of women is widely recognized as vitally important to [[international development]] issues.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}} This often means a focus on gender-equality, ensuring [[participation (decision making)|participation]], but includes an understanding of the different roles and expectation of the genders within the community.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] have highlighted that policy dialogue on the [[Millennium Development Goals]] needs to recognise that the gender dynamics of power, poverty, vulnerability and care link all the goals.&lt;ref name=ODI&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2386&amp;title=gender-mdgs-gender-lens-vital-pro-poor-results|title= Gender and the MDGS|date=September 2008|publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender explicit issues are only explicit in MDG 3 and 5, however gender impacts all the goals:&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt;
# Discriminatory laws can limit women's access to education and ownership
# Women make up the majority of those working in agriculture or in insecure employment
# Women's dual responsibilities as carers and income earners leaves them suffering from time poverty and thus unable to access health and education services
# Role as carers particularly impacts MDG4 on child mortality
# Gender-based discrimination particularly affects MDG8 (Partnerships for Development).

As well as directly addressing inequality, attention to gender issues is regarded as important to the success of development programs, for all participants.&lt;ref name=ODI/&gt; For example, in [[microfinance]] it is common to target women, as besides the fact that women tend to be over-represented in the poorest segments of the population, they are also regarded as more reliable at repaying the loans.&lt;ref name=&quot;wmionline&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wmionline.org/aboutus/whatmicro/whatmicro.html | title=What is Microfinance? | publisher=Women's microfinance initiative | accessdate=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender Equality is also strongly linked to [[education]]. The [[Dakar Framework for Action]] (2000) set out ambitious goals: to eliminate gender disparities in primary and secondary education by 2005, and to achieve gender equality in education by 2015. The focus was on ensuring girls’ full and equal access to and achievement in good quality basic education. The gender objective of the Dakar Framework for Action is somewhat different from the MDG Goal 3 (Target 1): “Eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education, preferably by 2005, and in all levels of education no later than 2015”. MDG Goal 3 does not comprise a reference to learner achievement and good quality basic education, but goes beyond the school level. Studies demonstrate the positive impact of girls’ education on child and maternal health, fertility rates, poverty reduction and economic growth. Educated mothers are more likely to send their children to school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Achieving Gender Equality&quot;&gt;[http://www.iiep.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/Info_Services_Newsletter/pdf/eng/2010/2010_1En.pdf IIEP Newsletter], Achieving Gender Equality in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the arena of natural resource management, women in [[developing countries]] frequently have principal responsibilities for uncompensated functions that directly impact their and their families’ lives, including agricultural chores and obtaining clean water and cooking fuels.  For these tasks, calls for women to “participate” in development are not enough, since they can serve as a pretext to foist undesirable duties on women.&lt;ref&gt;Auer, M.R. (1999) Women, the environment, and development assistance. ''International Politics'', 36: 373–396.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, empowerment, and not merely participation, must be core aims in gender and development policies and programs.

Some organizations working in developing countries and in the development field have incorporated advocacy and empowerment for women into their work. The United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] adopted in November 2009 a 10-year strategic framework that includes the strategic objective of gender equity in access to resources, goods, services and decision-making in rural areas, and mainstreams gender equity in all FAO's programmes for agriculture and rural development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/gender/gender-home/gender-programme/gender-equity/en/|title= Gender equity|date=November 2009|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association for Progressive Communications]] (APC) has developed a [[Gender Evaluation Methodology]] for planning and evaluating development projects to ensure they benefit all sectors of society including women.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genderevaluation.net Gender Evaluation Methodology (GEM)&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gender-related Development Index]] (GDI), developed by the United Nations (UN), aims to show the inequalities between men and women in the following areas: long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living.

For example, in [[microfinance]] it is common to target women, as besides the fact that women tend to be over-represented in the poorest segments of the population, they are also regarded as more reliable at repaying the loans. &lt;ref&gt;'MILLIONS FOR MILLIONS', Connie Bruck, THE NEW YORKER MAGAZINE, Issue of 30 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Muhammad Yunus]] says that he developed the policy of lending mainly to women not only because they were more responsible about re-paying the loans, but because families benefited more when the women controlled the money. At Compartamos they lent to women at the start not only because they knew women were more reliable borrowers, but also because in many villages most of the men had emigrated to the United States, and the women were the heads of household.  In the past five years as they expanded to urban areas, they have been lending to men as well. Also, it is claimed that women are more likely to use the money for the benefit of their families.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;THE NOBEL LECTURE GIVEN BY THE NOBEL PEACE PRIZE LAUREATE 2006, MUHAMMAD YUNUS (OSLO, DECEMBER 10, 2006).&lt;br /&gt;

(2) &quot;Men often spend the money on themselves, women spend it on the family.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender and poverty===
{{main|Feminization of poverty}}
Gender inequality has a great impact especially on women and poverty. In poverty stricken countries it is more likely that men have more opportunities to have an income, have more political and social rights than women. Women experience more poverty than men do due to [[gender discrimination]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

Gender and Development (GAD) is a holistic approach to give aid to countries where gender inequality has a great effect of not improving the social and economic development. It is to empower women and decrease the level of inequality between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Chant. S. 2008. The ‘feminisation of poverty’ and the ‘feminisation’ of anti-poverty programmes: Room for revision? Journal of development studies 44(2):165–197.&lt;/ref&gt;

In many countries, the financial sector largely neglects women even though they play an important role in the economy, as Nena Stoiljkovic pointed out in ''D+C Development and Cooperation'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dandc.eu/articles/220419/index.en.shtml D+C Development and Cooperation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
{{Further2|[[Gender and religion]]}}
This topic includes internal and external religious issues such as [[Gender of God|gender of God and deities]] creation myths about human gender, roles and rights (for instance, leadership roles especially [[ordination of women]], [[sex segregation]], gender equality, marriage, abortion, [[Homosexuality and religion|homosexuality]])

According to Kati Niemelä of the Church Research Institute, women are universally more [[religious]] than men.  They believe that the difference in religiousity between genders is due to biological differences, for instance usually people seeking security in life are more religious, and as men are considered to be greater risk takers than women, they are less religious. Although [[religious fanaticism]] is more often seen in men than women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/08/women_more_religious_than_men_1939513.html Women More Religious than Men]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|100px|[[Yin and yang|''yin'' and ''yang'']]]]
In [[Taoism]], [[yin and yang]] are considered feminine and masculine, respectively. The Taijitu and concept of the Zhou period reach into family and gender relations. Yin is female and yang is male. They fit together as two parts of a whole.
The male principle was equated with the sun: active, bright, and shining; the female principle corresponds to the moon: passive, shaded, and reflective. Male toughness was balanced by female gentleness, male action and initiative by female endurance and need for completion, and male leadership by female supportiveness.

In [[Judaism]], [[God]] is traditionally described in the masculine, but in the mystical tradition of the [[Kabbalah]], the [[Shekhinah]] represents the feminine aspect of God's essence. However, Judaism [[Jewish principles of faith|traditionally holds]] that God is completely non-corporeal, and thus neither male nor female. Conceptions of the gender of God notwithstanding, traditional Judaism places a strong emphasis on individuals following traditional gender roles, though many modern [[Jewish religious movements|denominations of Judaism]] strive for greater egalitarianism.

In [[Christianity]], God is described in masculine terms and the Church has historically been described in feminine terms.  On the other hand, Christian [[theology]] in many churches distinguishes between the masculine images used of God (Father, King, God the Son) and the reality they signify, which transcends gender, embodies all the virtues of both genders perfectly, and is the creator of both human sexes. In the [[New Testament]], the [[Holy Spirit]] is treated with the [[Gender-neutral pronoun|neuter pronoun]]. Hebrew speaking Christians like the [[Ebionites]] used the female gender for the Holy Spirit.

In [[Hinduism]]

{{quote|One of the several forms of the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] God [[Shiva]], is Ardhanarishwar (literally half-female God). Here Shiva manifests himself so that the left half is Female and the right half is Male. The left represents Shakti (energy, power) in the form of Goddess [[Parvati]] (otherwise his consort) and the right half Shiva. Whereas Parvati is the cause of arousal of Kama (desires), Shiva is the killer. Shiva is pervaded by the power of Parvati and Parvati is pervaded by the power of Shiva.

While the stone images may seem to represent a half-male and half-female God, the true symbolic representation is of a being the whole of which is Shiva and the whole of which is Shakti at the same time. It is a 3-D representation of only shakti from one angle and only Shiva from the other. Shiva and Shakti are hence the same being representing a collective of Jnana (knowledge) and Kriya (activity).

Adi Shankaracharya, the founder of non-dualistic philosophy (Advaita–&quot;not two&quot;) in Hindu thought says in his &quot;Saundaryalahari&quot;—''Shivah Shaktayaa yukto yadi bhavati shaktah prabhavitum na che devum devona khalu kushalah spanditam api'' &quot; i.e., It is only when Shiva is united with Shakti that He acquires the capability of becoming the Lord of the Universe. In the absence of Shakti, He is not even able to stir. In fact, the term &quot;Shiva&quot; originated from &quot;Shva,&quot; which implies a dead body. It is only through his inherent shakti that Shiva realizes his true nature.

This mythology projects the inherent view in ancient Hinduism, that each human carries within himself both female and male components, which are forces rather than sexes, and it is the harmony between the creative and the annihilative, the strong and the soft, the proactive and the passive, that makes a true person. Such thought, leave alone entail gender equality, in fact obliterates any material distinction between the male and female altogether. This may explain why in ancient India we find evidence of homosexuality, bisexuality, androgyny, multiple sex partners and open representation of sexual pleasures in artworks like the Khajuraho temples, being accepted within prevalent social frameworks.|&lt;ref name=&quot;vohra&quot;&gt;&quot;The Male-Female Hologram,&quot; Ashok Vohra, [[Times of India]], March 8, 2005, Page 9&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Language==
Natural languages often{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} make gender distinctions. These may be of various kinds, more or less loosely associated by analogy with various actual or perceived differences between men and women.
* Most languages include terms that are used asymmetrically in reference to men and women. Concern that current language may be biased in favor of men has led some authors in recent times to argue for the use of a more [[Gender-neutral language in English|Gender-neutral vocabulary]] in English and other languages.
* Several languages attest the use of different vocabulary by men and women, to differing degrees. See, for instance, [[Gender differences in spoken Japanese]]. The oldest documented language, [[Sumerian language|Sumerian]], records a distinctive sub-language only used by female speakers. Conversely, many [[Indigenous Australian languages]] have distinctive registers with limited lexis used by men in the presence of their mothers-in-law (see [[Avoidance speech]]).
* Several languages such as [[Persian language|Persian]] are gender-neutral. In Persian the same word is used in reference to men and women. Verbs, adjectives and nouns are not gendered. (See [[Gender-neutrality in genderless languages]])
* [[Grammatical gender]] is a property of some languages in which every [[noun]] is assigned a gender, often with no direct relation to its meaning. For example, the word for &quot;girl&quot; is ''[[:es:muchacha|muchacha]]'' (grammatically feminine) in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], ''[[:de:Mädchen|Mädchen]]'' (grammatically neuter) in [[German language|German]], and ''[[:ga:cailín|cailín]]'' (grammatically masculine) in [[Irish language|Irish]].
* The term &quot;[[grammatical gender]]&quot; is often applied to more complex [[noun class]] systems. This is especially true when a noun class system includes masculine and feminine as well as some other non-gender features like animate, edible, manufactured, and so forth. An example of the latter is found in the [[Dyirbal language]]. A system traditionally called &quot;gender&quot; appears in the [[Ojibwe language]], which distinguishes between animate and inanimate, but since this does not exhibit a masculine/feminine distinction it might be better described by &quot;noun class.&quot; Likewise, Sumerian distinguishes between personal (human and divine) and impersonal (all other) noun classes, but these classes have traditionally been known as ''genders''.
