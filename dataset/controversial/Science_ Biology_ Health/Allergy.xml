An '''allergy''' is a [[hypersensitivity|hypersensitivity disorder]] of the [[immune system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|one/000002984|allergy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Allergic reactions occur when a person's immune system reacts to normally harmless substances in the [[Natural environment|environment]].  A substance that causes a reaction is called an [[allergen]].  These reactions are [[Acquired disorder|acquired]], predictable, and rapid.  Allergy is one of four forms of [[hypersensitivity]] and is formally called ''[[Type I hypersensitivity|type I]]'' (or ''immediate'') hypersensitivity.  Allergic reactions are distinctive because of excessive activation of certain [[white blood cell]]s called [[mast cell]]s and [[basophil granulocyte|basophils]] by a type of [[antibody]] called [[Immunoglobulin E]] (IgE).  This reaction results in an [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] response which can range from uncomfortable to dangerous.

Mild allergies like [[hay fever]] are very common in the human [[population]] and cause [[symptom]]s such as [[allergic conjunctivitis|red eyes]], itchiness, and [[rhinorrhea|runny nose]], [[eczema]], [[urticaria|hives]], or an [[asthma]] attack. Allergies can play a major role in conditions such as [[asthma]]. In some people, severe allergies to environmental or dietary allergens or to [[medication]] may result in life-threatening reactions called [[anaphylaxis]].  [[food allergy|Food allergies]], and reactions to the [[venom]] of stinging [[insect]]s such as [[wasp]]s and [[bee]]s are often associated with these severe reactions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Overview of 'allergy and allergic diseases: with a view to the future'&quot;/&gt;

A variety of tests exist to diagnose allergic conditions.  These include placing possible allergens on the skin and looking for a reaction such as swelling.  Blood tests can also be done to look for an allergen-specific IgE.

Treatments for allergies include avoiding known allergens, use of medications such as [[anti-histamine]]s that specifically prevent allergic reactions, [[steroid]]s that modify the immune system in general, and medications such as [[decongestants]] that reduce the symptoms.  Many of these medications are taken by mouth, though [[epinephrine]], which is used to treat anaphylactic reactions, is injected.  [[Allergen immunotherapy|Immunotherapy]] uses injected allergens to [[Desensitization (medicine)|desensitize]] the body's response.

Many allergens such as dust or pollen are [[wiktionary:airborne|airborne]] particles. In these cases, symptoms arise in areas in contact with air, such as eyes, nose, and lungs. For instance, [[allergic rhinitis]], also known as hay fever, causes irritation of the nose, sneezing, itching, and redness of the eyes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Conn's Current Therapy 2005&quot;/&gt; Inhaled allergens can also lead to [[asthmatic]] symptoms, caused by narrowing of the airways ([[bronchoconstriction]]) and increased production of [[mucus]] in the [[lung]]s, shortness of breath ([[dyspnea]]), coughing and wheezing.&lt;ref name=&quot;holgate98&quot;/&gt;

Aside from these ambient allergens, allergic reactions can result from [[food]]s, [[Insect sting allergy|insect stings]], and reactions to [[medication]]s like [[aspirin]] and [[antibiotic]]s such as [[penicillin]]. Symptoms of food allergy include [[abdominal pain]], [[bloating]], vomiting, [[diarrhea]], [[itch]]y skin, and [[Angioedema|swelling of the skin during hives]]. Food allergies rarely cause [[respiratory tract|respiratory]] (asthmatic) reactions, or [[rhinitis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rusznak98&quot;/&gt; Insect stings, antibiotics, and certain medicines produce a systemic allergic response that is also called [[anaphylaxis]]; multiple organ systems can be affected, including the [[digestive system]], the [[respiratory system]], and the [[circulatory system]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Insect sting anaphylaxis&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Penicillin allergy skin testing: what do we do now?&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tang03&quot;/&gt; Depending on the rate of severity, it can cause [[cutaneous]] reactions, bronchoconstriction, [[edema]], [[hypotension]], [[coma]], and even [[death]]. This type of reaction can be triggered suddenly, or the onset can be delayed. The severity of this type of allergic response often requires injections of [[epinephrine]], sometimes through a device known as the [[EpiPen]] or [[Twinject]] auto-injector. The nature of [[anaphylaxis]] is such that the reaction can seem to be subsiding, but may recur throughout a prolonged period of time.&lt;ref name=tang03/&gt;

Substances that come into contact with the skin, such as [[latex]], are also common causes of allergic reactions, known as [[contact dermatitis]] or eczema.&lt;ref name=&quot;Natural rubber latex allergy: a problem of interdisciplinary concern in medicine&quot;/&gt; Skin allergies frequently cause rashes, or swelling and inflammation within the skin, in what is known as a &quot;[[wheal response|wheal]] and flare&quot; reaction characteristic of hives and angioedema.&lt;ref name=&quot;Urticaria and angioedema: a practical approach&quot;/&gt;

==Cause==
Risk factors for allergy can be placed in two general categories, namely [[Host (biology)|host]] and [[Natural environment|environmental]] factors.&lt;ref name=&quot;The genetic and environmental basis of atopic diseases&quot;/&gt; Host factors include [[heredity]], [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], and age, with heredity being by far the most significant. However, there have been recent increases in the incidence of allergic disorders that cannot be explained by genetic factors alone. Four major environmental candidates are alterations in exposure to [[infectious disease]]s during early childhood, environmental [[pollution]], allergen levels, and [[Diet (nutrition)|dietary]] changes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Janeway&quot;/&gt;

===Foods===
One of the most common [[food allergy|food allergies]] is a sensitivity to [[peanut]]s. Peanut allergies may be extremely severe, but can sometimes be outgrown by children school-age.&lt;ref&gt;Sicherer 62&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nut (fruit)|Tree nuts]], including pecans, pistachios, pine nuts, and walnuts, are another common allergen. Sufferers may be sensitive to one, or many, tree nuts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sicherer 63&quot;/&gt; Also [[seeds]], including [[sesame seeds]] and [[poppy seeds]], contain oils where protein is present, which may elicit an allergic reaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sicherer 63&quot;/&gt;

Egg allergies affect one to two percent of children but are outgrown by about two-thirds of children by the age of 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Järvinen KM, Beyer K, Vila L, Bardina L, Mishoe M, Sampson HA.|title=Specificity of IgE antibodies to sequential epitopes of hen's egg ovomucoid as a marker for persistence of egg allergy |journal=J. Allergy |volume=62 |issue=7 |pages=758–65 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17573723 |doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.2007.01332.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The sensitivity is usually to proteins in the white rather than the yolk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sicherer 63&quot;/&gt;

Milk, from cows, goats, or sheep, is another common allergy-causing food, and many sufferers are also unable to tolerate dairy products such as cheese. [[Lactose intolerance]], a common reaction to milk, is not in fact a form of allergy. A small portion of children with a milk allergy, roughly ten percent, will have a reaction to [[beef]]. Beef contains a small amount of protein that is present in cow's milk.&lt;ref&gt;Sicherer 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Other foods containing allergenic proteins include soy, wheat, maize, fish, shellfish, fruits, vegetables, spices, synthetic and natural colors, chicken, and chemical additives.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Non-food proteins===
[[Latex]] can trigger an IgE-mediated cutaneous, respiratory, and systemic reaction. The prevalence of latex allergy in the general population is believed to be less than one percent. In a hospital study, one in 800 surgical patients (0.125 percent) report latex sensitivity, although the sensitivity among healthcare workers is higher, between seven and ten percent. Researchers attribute this higher level to the exposure of healthcare workers to areas with significant airborne latex allergens, such as operating rooms, intensive-care units, and dental suites. These latex-rich environments may sensitize healthcare workers who regularly inhale allergenic proteins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sussman&quot;/&gt;

The most prevalent response to latex is an allergic contact dermatitis, a delayed hypersensitive reaction appearing as dry, crusted lesions. This reaction usually lasts 48 to 96 hours. Sweating or rubbing the area under the glove aggravates the lesions, possibly leading to ulcerations.&lt;ref name=Sussman/&gt; Anaphylactic reactions occur most often in sensitive patients, who have been exposed to the surgeon's latex gloves during abdominal surgery, but other [[mucous membrane|mucosal]] exposures, such as dental procedures, can also produce systemic reactions.&lt;ref name=Sussman/&gt;

Latex and banana sensitivity may cross-react; furthermore, patients with latex allergy may also have sensitivities to avocado, kiwifruit, and chestnut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fernández de Corres L, Moneo I, Muñoz D, ''et al.'' |title=Sensitization from chestnuts and bananas in patients with urticaria and anaphylaxis from contact with latex |journal=Ann Allergy |volume=70 |issue=1 |pages=35–9 |year=1993 |month=January |pmid=7678724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These patients often have [[perioral]] itching and local [[urticaria]]. Only occasionally have these food-induced allergies induced systemic responses. Researchers suspect that the cross-reactivity of latex with banana, avocado, kiwifruit, and chestnut occurs because latex proteins are structurally [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] with some plant proteins.&lt;ref name=Sussman/&gt;

===Toxins interacting with proteins===
Another non-food protein reaction, [[urushiol-induced contact dermatitis]], originates after contact with [[poison ivy]], [[Toxicodendron pubescens|eastern poison oak]], [[Toxicodendron diversilobum|western poison oak]], or [[poison sumac]]. [[Urushiol]], which is not itself a protein, acts as a [[hapten]] and chemically reacts with, binds to, and changes the shape of [[integral membrane protein]]s on exposed skin cells. The immune system does not recognize the affected cells as normal parts of the body, causing a [[T-cell]]&lt;nowiki&gt;-&lt;/nowiki&gt;mediated [[immune response]].&lt;ref&gt;C. Michael Hogan. [http://globaltwitcher.auderis.se/artspec_information.asp?thingid=82914 ''Western poison-oak: Toxicodendron diversilobum'']. GlobalTwitcher, ed. Nicklas Stromberg. 2008. Retrieved 30 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Of these poisonous plants, sumac is the most virulent.&lt;ref&gt;Keeler, Harriet L. (1900). ''Our Native Trees and How to Identify Them.'' New York: Charles Scriber's Sons. pp. 94–96; Frankel, Edward, Ph.D. ''Poison Ivy, Poison Oak, Poison Sumac and Their Relatives; Pistachios, Mangoes and Cashews.'' The Boxwood Press. Pacific Grove, Calif. 1991. ISBN 978-0-940168-18-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting dermatological response to the reaction between urushiol and membrane proteins includes redness, swelling, [[papule]]s, [[Vesicle (dermatology)|vesicles]], [[blister]]s, and streaking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dermatlas&quot; &gt;{{DermAtlas|-1892628434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Estimates vary on the percentage of the population that will have an immune system response. Approximately 25 percent of the population will have a strong allergic response to urushiol. In general, approximately 80 percent to 90 percent of adults will develop a rash if they are exposed to {{convert|.0050|mg|sp=us}} of purified urushiol, but some people are so sensitive that it takes only a molecular trace on the skin to initiate an allergic reaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Armstrong W.P., Epstein W.L. |title= |journal=Herbalgram |volume=34 |issue= |pages=36–42 |year=1995 |publisher=American Botanical Council |url=}} cited in http://waynesword.palomar.edu/ww0802.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic basis===
Allergic diseases are strongly [[Family|familial]]: [[Twin#Monozygotic twins|identical twins]] are likely to have the same allergic diseases about 70% of the time; the same allergy occurs about 40% of the time in [[Twin#Dizygotic twins|non-identical twins]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Allergy&quot;/&gt; Allergic parents are more likely to have allergic children,&lt;ref name=&quot;DeSwert&quot;/&gt; and their allergies are likely to be more severe than those from non-allergic parents. Some allergies, however, are not consistent along [[Genealogy|genealogies]]; parents who are allergic to [[peanut]]s may have children who are allergic to [[ragweed]]. It seems that the likelihood of developing allergies is [[Heredity|inherited]] and related to an irregularity in the immune system, but the specific [[allergen]] is not.&lt;ref name=DeSwert/&gt;

The risk of allergic [[Sensitization (immunology)|sensitization]] and the development of allergies varies with age, with young children most at risk.&lt;ref name=&quot;Croner&quot;/&gt; Several studies have shown that IgE levels are highest in childhood and fall rapidly between the ages of 10 and 30 years.&lt;ref name=Croner/&gt; The peak prevalence of hay fever is highest in children and young adults and the incidence of asthma is highest in children under 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Jarvis D, Burney P |chapter=Epidemiology of atopy and atopic disease |editor=Kay AB |title=Allergy and allergic diseases |publisher=Blackwell Science |location=London |year=1997 |pages=1208–24 |volume=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, boys have a higher risk of developing allergies than girls,&lt;ref name=DeSwert/&gt; although for some diseases, namely asthma in young adults, females are more likely to be affected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Asthma from birth to age 23: incidence and relation to prior and concurrent atopic disease&quot;/&gt; Sex differences tend to decrease in adulthood.&lt;ref name=DeSwert/&gt; [[Ethnic group|Ethnicity]] may play a role in some allergies; however, racial factors have been difficult to separate from environmental influences and changes due to [[human migration|migration]].&lt;ref name=DeSwert/&gt; It has been suggested that different [[Locus (genetics)|genetic loci]] are responsible for asthma, to be specific, in people of [[Caucasian race|European]], [[Hispanic]], [[Asian people|Asian]], and [[African]] origins.&lt;ref name=&quot;African Americans with asthma: genetic insights&quot;/&gt;

===Hygiene hypothesis===
{{Main|Hygiene hypothesis}}
Allergic diseases are caused by inappropriate immunological responses to harmless [[antigens]] driven by a [[t helper cell|TH2]]-mediated immune response. Many [[bacteria]] and [[virus]]es elicit a [[T helper cell|TH1]]-mediated immune response, which down-regulates TH2 responses. The first proposed mechanism of action of the hygiene hypothesis was that insufficient stimulation of the TH1 arm of the immune system leads to an overactive TH2 arm, which in turn leads to allergic disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0167-5699(00)01582-6 |author=Folkerts G, Walzl G, Openshaw PJ |title=Do common childhood infections 'teach' the immune system not to be allergic? |journal=Immunol. Today |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=118–20 |year=2000 |month=March |pmid=10777250 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0167569900015826}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, individuals living in too sterile an environment are not exposed to enough pathogens to keep the immune system busy. Since our bodies evolved to deal with a certain level of such pathogens, when they are not exposed to this level, the immune system will attack harmless antigens and thus normally benign microbial objects — like pollen — will trigger an immune response.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edwardwillett.com/2000/05/the-hygiene-hypothesis/ The Hygiene Hypothesis » Edward Willett]&lt;/ref&gt;

The hygiene hypothesis was developed to explain the observation that [[hay fever]] and [[eczema]], both allergic diseases, were less common in children from larger families, which were, it is presumed, exposed to more infectious agents through their siblings, than in children from families with only one child. The hygiene hypothesis has been extensively investigated by [[immunology|immunologists]] and [[epidemiology|epidemiologists]] and has become an important theoretical framework for the study of allergic disorders. It is used to explain the increase in allergic diseases that have been seen since [[industrialization]], and the higher incidence of allergic diseases in more developed countries. The hygiene hypothesis has now expanded to include exposure to symbiotic bacteria and parasites as important modulators of immune system development, along with infectious agents.

Epidemiological data support the hygiene hypothesis. Studies have shown that various immunological and autoimmune diseases are much less common in the developing world than the industrialized world and that immigrants to the industrialized world from the developing world increasingly develop immunological disorders in relation to the length of time since arrival in the industrialized world.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12910582&quot;/&gt; Longitudinal studies in the third world demonstrate an increase in immunological disorders as a country grows more affluent and, it is presumed, cleaner.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17326711&quot;/&gt; The use of antibiotics in the first year of life has been linked to asthma and other allergic diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Does antibiotic exposure during infancy lead to development of asthma?: a systematic review and metaanalysis&quot;/&gt; The use of antibacterial cleaning products has also been associated with higher incidence of [[asthma]], as has birth by Caesarean section rather than vaginal birth.&lt;ref name=&quot;A meta-analysis of the association between Caesarean section and childhood asthma&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The use of household cleaning sprays and adult asthma: an international longitudinal study&quot;/&gt;

===Other environmental factors===
International differences have been associated with the number of individuals within a population that suffer from allergy. Allergic diseases are more common in [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] countries than in countries that are more traditional or [[Agriculture|agricultural]], and there is a higher rate of allergic disease in [[Urban area|urban]] populations versus [[rural]] populations, although these differences are becoming less defined.&lt;ref name = cooper04&gt;{{cite journal |author=Cooper PJ |title=Intestinal worms and human allergy |journal=Parasite Immunol. |volume=26 |issue=11–12 |pages=455–67 |year=2004 |pmid=15771681 |doi=10.1111/j.0141-9838.2004.00728.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exposure to allergens, especially in early life, is an important [[risk factor]] for allergy. Alterations in exposure to [[microorganism]]s is another plausible explanation, at present, for the increase in [[Atopy|atopic allergy]].&lt;ref name= Janeway/&gt; Endotoxin exposure reduces release of inflammatory [[cytokine]]s such as [[tumor necrosis factor alpha|TNF-α]], [[interferon-gamma|IFNγ]], [[interleukin-10]], and [[interleukin-12]] from white blood cells ([[leukocytes]]) that circulate in the [[blood]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12239255&quot;/&gt; Certain microbe-sensing [[protein]]s, known as [[Toll-like receptor]]s, found on the surface of cells in the body are also thought to be involved in these processes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Epidemiological and immunological evidence for the hygiene hypothesis&quot;/&gt;

Gutworms and similar parasites are present in untreated drinking water in developing countries, and were present in the water of developed countries until the routine [[chlorination]] and purification of drinking water supplies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parasitic food-borne and water-borne zoonoses&quot;/&gt; Recent research has shown that some common [[parasite]]s, such as [[Parasitic worm|intestinal worm]]s (e.g., [[hookworm]]s), secrete chemicals into the gut wall (and, hence, the bloodstream) that [[immunosuppressant|suppress]] the immune system and prevent the body from attacking the parasite.&lt;ref name=&quot;Worms and allergy&quot;/&gt; This gives rise to a new slant on the hygiene hypothesis theory — that [[co-evolution]] of man and parasites has led to an immune system that functions correctly only in the presence of the parasites. Without them, the immune system becomes unbalanced and oversensitive.&lt;ref name=Yazdanbakhsh02&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yazdanbakhsh M, Kremsner PG, van Ree R |title=Allergy, parasites, and the hygiene hypothesis |journal=Science |volume=296 |issue=5567 |pages=490–4 |year=2002 |pmid=11964470 |doi=10.1126/science.296.5567.490}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, research suggests that allergies may coincide with the delayed establishment of [[gut flora]] in [[infant]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17382394&quot;/&gt; However, the research to support this theory is conflicting, with some studies performed in [[China]] and [[Ethiopia]] showing an increase in allergy in people infected with intestinal worms.&lt;ref name = cooper04/&gt; Clinical trials have been initiated to test the effectiveness of certain worms in treating some allergies.&lt;ref name = falcone05&gt;{{cite journal |author=Falcone FH, Pritchard DI |title=Parasite role reversal: worms on trial |journal=Trends Parasitol. |volume=21 |issue=4 |pages=157–60 |year=2005 |pmid=15780835 |doi=10.1016/j.pt.2005.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that the term 'parasite' could turn out to be inappropriate, and in fact a hitherto unsuspected [[symbiosis]] is at work.&lt;ref name = falcone05/&gt; For more information on this topic, see [[Helminthic therapy]].

==Pathophysiology==
[[File:The Allergy Pathway.jpg|thumb|This is a summary diagram that explains how allergy develops.]] 
[[File:Tissues Affected In Allergic Inflammation.jpg|thumb|Tissues affected in allergic inflammation.]]  
===Acute response===
[[File:Allergy degranulation processes 01.svg|thumb|Degranulation process in allergy. Second exposure to allergen.'''1''' - antigen; '''2''' - IgE antibody; '''3''' - FcεRI receptor; '''4''' - preformed mediators (histamine, proteases, chemokines, heparine); '''5''' - [[granule (cell biology)|granule]]s; '''6''' - [[mast cell]]; '''7''' - newly formed mediators (prostaglandins, leukotrienes, thromboxanes, PAF)]]
In the early stages of allergy, a type I hypersensitivity reaction against an allergen encountered for the first time and presented by a professional [[Antigen-presenting cell|Antigen-Presenting Cell]] causes a response in a type of immune cell called a [[T helper cell|T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 lymphocyte]], which belongs to a subset of [[T cell]]s that produce a [[cytokine]] called [[interleukin-4]] (IL-4). These T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cells interact with other [[lymphocytes]] called [[B cell]]s, whose role is production of antibodies. Coupled with signals provided by IL-4, this interaction stimulates the B cell to begin production of a large amount of a particular type of antibody known as IgE. Secreted IgE circulates in the blood and binds to an IgE-specific receptor (a kind of [[Fc receptor]] called [[FcεRI]]) on the surface of other kinds of immune cells called [[mast cell]]s and [[basophil]]s, which are both involved in the acute inflammatory response. The IgE-coated cells, at this stage are sensitized to the allergen.&lt;ref name=Janeway/&gt;

If later exposure to the same allergen occurs, the allergen can bind to the IgE molecules held on the surface of the mast cells or basophils. Cross-linking of the IgE and Fc receptors occurs when more than one IgE-receptor complex interacts with the same allergenic molecule, and activates the sensitized cell. Activated mast cells and basophils undergo a process called [[degranulation]], during which they release [[histamine]] and other inflammatory chemical mediators ([[cytokine]]s, [[interleukin]]s, [[leukotriene]]s, and [[prostaglandin]]s) from their [[granule (cell biology)|granule]]s into the surrounding tissue causing several systemic effects, such as [[vasodilation]], [[mucus|mucous]] secretion, [[nerve]] stimulation, and [[smooth muscle]] contraction. This results in [[rhinorrhea]], itchiness, dyspnea, and [[anaphylaxis]]. Depending on the individual, allergen, and mode of introduction, the symptoms can be system-wide (classical anaphylaxis), or localized to particular body systems; asthma is localized to the respiratory system and eczema is localized to the [[dermis]].&lt;ref name=Janeway/&gt;

===Late-phase response===
After the chemical mediators of the acute response subside, late phase responses can often occur. This is due to the migration of other [[leukocyte]]s such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[lymphocyte]]s, [[eosinophil]]s and [[macrophage]]s to the initial site. The reaction is usually seen 2–24 hours after the original reaction.&lt;ref name=&quot;Effector and potential immunoregulatory roles of mast cells in IgE-associated acquired immune responses&quot;/&gt; Cytokines from mast cells may also play a role in the persistence of long-term effects. Late phase responses seen in [[asthma]] are slightly different from those seen in other allergic responses, although they are still caused by release of mediators from eosinophils, and are still dependent on activity of T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;Th2 cytokines in the asthma late-phase response&quot;/&gt;

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Allergy testing machine.jpg|left|thumb|An allergy testing machine being operated in the diagnostic immunology lab at [[Lackland Air Force Base]]]]
Before a diagnosis of allergic disease can be confirmed, the other possible causes of the presenting symptoms should be carefully considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|med|3390|Allergic and Environmental Asthma}} -
Includes discussion of differentials&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasomotor rhinitis]], for example, is one of many [[Illness|maladies]] that shares symptoms with allergic rhinitis, underscoring the need for professional differential diagnosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16190503&quot;/&gt; Once a diagnosis of [[asthma]], rhinitis, [[anaphylaxis]], or other allergic disease has been made, there are several methods for discovering the causative agent of that allergy.

Effective management of allergic diseases relies on the ability to make an accurate diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Portnoy, JM, et al. Evidence-based Allergy Diagnostic Tests, Current Allergy and Asthma Reports 2006, 6:455-461&lt;/ref&gt; Allergy testing can help confirm/rule out allergies and consequently reduce adverse reactions and limit unnecessary avoidance and medications.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;NICE Diagnosis and assessment of food allergy in children and young people in primary care and community settings, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Boyce J et al. Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Food Allergy in the United States: Report of NIAID-Sponsored Expert Panel. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2010; 126: S1–S58&lt;/ref&gt; Correct diagnosis, counseling and avoidance advice based on valid allergy test results will help reduce the incidence of symptoms, medications and improve quality of life.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; For assessing the presence of allergen-specific IgE antibodies, you can use two different methods—a skin prick test or an allergy blood test. Both methods are recommended by the NIH guidelines and have similar diagnostic value in terms of sensitivity and specificity.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cox, L. Overview of Serological-Specific IgE Antibody Testing in Children. Pediatric Allergy and Immunology. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A healthcare provider can use the test results to identify the specific allergic triggers that may be contributing to the symptoms. Using this information, along with a physical examination and case history, the doctor can diagnose the cause of the symptoms and tailor treatments that will help the patient feel better. A negative result can help the doctor rule out allergies in order to consider other possible.

NIH Guidelines state that: ''“sIgE tests are useful for identifying foods potentially provoking IgE-mediated food-induced allergic reactions, and specified ‘‘cutoff’’ levels, defined as 95% predictive values, may be more predictive than skin prick tests of clinical reactivity in certain populations.”''
It further states, ''“sIgE tests are very useful for detecting the presence of sIgE antibodies, which indicates the presence of allergic sensitization. Fluorescence-labeled antibody assays have comparable sensitivity to that of skin prick tests, and the absolute levels of sIgE antibodies may directly correlate with the likelihood of clinical reactivity when compared with oral food challenges for the identification of foods provoking IgE mediated FA.”''&lt;ref name=&quot;United States 2010&quot;&gt;NIH Guidelines for the Diagnosis and Management of Food Allergy in the United States. Report of the NIAID- Sponsored Expert Panel, 2010, NIH Publication no. 11-7700.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to NICE Guidelines, skin prick tests and blood tests are equally cost-effective and health economic evidence show that both the IgE antibody test and the skin prick test were cost effective compared with no test.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; Also, earlier and more accurate diagnoses save cost due to reduced GP consultations, referrals to secondary care, misdiagnosis and emergency admissions.&lt;ref&gt;Food Allergy in children and young people. Costing report. Implementing NICE guidance, 2011. http://guidance.nice.org.uk/CG116/CostingReport/pdf/English&lt;/ref&gt;

Allergy undergoes dynamic changes over time. Regular allergy testing of relevant allergens provides information on if and how patient management can be changed, in order to improve health and quality of life. Annual testing is often the practice for determining whether allergy to milk, egg, soy, and wheat have been outgrown and the testing interval is extended to 2 to 3 years for allergy to peanut, tree nuts, fish, and crustacean shellfish.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; Results of follow-up testing can guide decision-making regarding whether and when it is safe to introduce or re-introduce allergenic food into the diet.&lt;ref name=&quot;United States 2010&quot;/&gt;

===Skin testing===
[[File:Allergy skin testing.JPG|thumb|right|Skin testing on arm]][[File:Skintest2.jpg|thumb|right|Skin testing on back]][[Skin allergy test|Skin testing]] is also known as &quot;puncture testing&quot; and &quot;prick testing&quot; due to the series of tiny puncture or pricks made into the patient's skin. Small amounts of suspected allergens and/or their extracts (pollen, grass, mite proteins, peanut extract, etc.) are introduced to sites on the skin marked with pen or dye (the ink/dye should be carefully selected, lest it cause an allergic response itself). A small plastic or metal device is used to puncture or prick the skin. Sometimes, the allergens are injected &quot;intradermally&quot; into the patient's skin, with a needle and syringe. Common areas for testing include the inside forearm and the back. If the patient is allergic to the substance, then a visible inflammatory reaction will usually occur within 30&amp;nbsp;minutes. This response will range from slight reddening of the skin to a full-blown [[Urticaria|hive]] (called &quot;wheal and flare&quot;) in more sensitive patients similar to a [[mosquito bite]]. Interpretation of the results of the skin prick test is normally done by allergists on a scale of severity, with +/- meaning borderline reactivity, and 4+ being a large reaction. Increasingly, allergists are measuring and recording the diameter of the wheal and flare reaction. Interpretation by well-trained allergists is often guided by relevant literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16164451&quot;/&gt; Some patients may believe they have determined their own allergic sensitivity from observation, but a skin test has been shown to be much better than patient observation to detect allergy.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid11101180&quot;/&gt;

If a serious life threatening anaphylactic reaction has brought a patient in for evaluation, some allergists will prefer an initial blood test prior to performing the skin prick test. Skin tests may not be an option if the patient has widespread skin disease or has taken [[antihistamines]] sometime the last several days.

===Blood testing===
An allergy blood test is quick and simple and can be ordered by a licensed health care provider e.g. an allergy specialist, GP or PED. Unlike skin-prick testing, a blood test can be performed irrespective of age, skin condition, medication, symptom, disease activity and pregnancy. Adults and children of any age can take an allergy blood test. For babies and very young children, a single needle stick for allergy blood testing is often more gentle than several skin tests.

An allergy blood test is available through most laboratories, and a sample of the patient’s blood is sent to a laboratory for analysis and the results are sent back a few days later.  Multiple allergens can be detected with a single blood sample.

Allergy blood tests are very safe, since you are not exposed to any allergens during the testing procedure.

'''How does the test work?'''

The test measures the concentration of specific IgE antibodies in the blood. Quantitative IgE test results increases the possibility of ranking how different substances may affect your symptoms.  A general rule of thumb is that the higher the IgE antibody value, the greater the likelihood of symptoms. Allergens found at low levels that today do not result in symptoms can nevertheless help predict future symptom development. The quantitative allergy blood result can help determine what a patient is allergic to, help predict and follow the disease development, estimate the risk of a severe reaction and explain cross-reactivity.&lt;ref&gt;Yunginger J et alQuantitative IgE antibody assays in allergic disease. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2000; 105: 1077–84.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sampson H et al. Utility of food-specific IgE concentrations in predictin symptomatic food allergy. J Allergy Clin Immunol 2001; 107: 891–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

A low total IgE level is not adequate to rule out sensitization to commonly inhaled allergens.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12911420&quot;/&gt; [[statistics|Statistical methods]], such as [[ROC curve]]s, predictive value calculations, and likelihood ratios have been used to examine the relationship of various testing methods to each other. These methods have shown that patients with a high total IgE have a high probability of allergic sensitization, but further investigation with allergy tests for specific IgE antibodies for a carefully chosen of allergens is often warranted.

'''History'''

Radiometric assays include the [[radioallergosorbent test]] (RAST) test method, which uses IgE-binding (anti-IgE) antibodies labeled with [[radioactive isotope]]s for quantifying the levels of IgE antibody in the blood.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid7630219&quot;/&gt; Other newer methods use colorimetric or fluorescence-labeled technology in the place of radioactive isotopes.

The market-leading RAST methodology was invented and marketed in 1974 by Pharmacia Diagnostics AB, Uppsala, Sweden, and the acronym RAST is actually a brand name. In 1989, Pharmacia Diagnostics AB replaced it with a superior test named the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE blood test, which uses the newer fluorescence-labeled technology. American College of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (ACAAI) and the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI) issued the Joint Task Force Report “Pearls and pitfalls of allergy diagnostic testing” in 2008, and is firm in its statement that the term RAST is now obsolete:

“The term RAST became a colloquialism for all varieties of (in vitro allergy) tests.  This is unfortunate because it is well recognized that there are well-performing tests and some that do not perform so well, yet they are all called RASTs, making it difficult to distinguish which is which. For these reasons, it is now recommended that use of RAST as a generic descriptor of these tests be abandoned.”&lt;ref&gt;Cox, et al. Pearls and pitfalls of allergy diagnostic testing. Annals of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology. 2008. 101(6): 580-592&lt;/ref&gt; The new version, the ImmunoCAP Specific IgE blood test, is the only specific IgE assay to receive FDA approval to quantitatively report to its detection limit of 0.1kU/l.

===Other===
'''Challenge testing:''' Challenge testing is when small amounts of a suspected allergen are introduced to the body orally, through inhalation, or other routes. Except for testing food and medication allergies, challenges are rarely performed. When this type of testing is chosen, it must be closely supervised by an allergist.

'''Elimination/Challenge tests:''' This testing method is utilized most often with foods or medicines. A patient with a particular suspected allergen is instructed to modify his/her diet to totally avoid that allergen for determined period of time. If the patient experiences significant improvement, he/she may then be “challenged” by reintroducing the allergen to see if symptoms can be reproduced.

'''Patch testing:''' Patch testing is used to help ascertain the cause of skin contact allergy, or [[contact dermatitis]].  Adhesive patches, usually treated with a number of different commonly allergic chemicals or skin sensitizers, are applied to the back. The skin is then examined for possible local reactions at least twice, usually at 48 hours after application of the patch, and again two or three days later.

Some &quot;screening&quot; test methods are intended to provide qualitative test results, giving a &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; answer in patients with suspected allergic sensitization. One such method has a sensitivity of about 70.8% and a positive predictive value of 72.6% according to a large study.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16047713&quot;/&gt;

'''Unreliable tests:''' There are other types of allergy testing methods that the [[American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology]] considers to be unacceptable.

These unreliable allergy testing methods are:

Applied kinesiology (allergy testing through muscle relaxation), Cytotoxicity testing, Urine autoinjection, Skin titration (Rinkel method), and Provocative and neutralization (subcutaneous) testing or sublingual provocation&lt;ref name=&quot;Allergy Diagnosis&quot;/&gt;

==Management==
In recent times, there have been enormous improvements in the medical practices used to treat allergic conditions. With respect to [[anaphylaxis]] and hypersensitivity reactions to foods, drugs, and insects and in allergic skin diseases, advances have included the identification of food proteins to which IgE binding is associated with severe reactions and development of low-allergen foods, improvements in skin prick test predictions; evaluation of the [[atopy]] patch test; in wasp sting outcomes predictions and a rapidly disintegrating epinephrine tablet, and anti-IL-5 for eosinophilic diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Advances in allergic skin disease, anaphylaxis, and hypersensitivity reactions to foods, drugs, and insects&quot;/&gt;

Traditional treatment and management of allergies consisted simply of avoiding the allergen in question or otherwise reducing exposure. For instance, people with cat allergies were encouraged to avoid them. However, while avoidance of allergens may reduce symptoms and avoid life-threatening anaphylaxis, it is difficult to achieve for those with pollen or similar air-borne allergies. Nonetheless, strict avoidance of allergens is still considered a useful treatment method, and is often used in managing food allergies.

New technology approaches to decreasing IgE overproduction, and regulating histimine release in allergic individuals have demonstrated statisitically significant reduction on Total Nasel Symptom Scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1271/bbb.64.2053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1024/0300-9831.71.1.60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medication===
Several [[Receptor antagonist|antagonistic]] drugs are used to block the action of allergic mediators, or to prevent activation of cells and degranulation processes. These include [[antihistamine]]s, [[glucocorticoid]]s, [[epinephrine]] (adrenaline), [[theophylline]] and [[cromolyn sodium]]. Anti-[[leukotriene]]s, such as [[Montelukast]] (Singulair) or [[Zafirlukast]] (Accolate), are FDA approved for treatment of allergic diseases.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} Anti-[[cholinergic]]s, [[decongestant]]s, mast cell stabilizers, and other compounds thought to impair eosinophil [[chemotaxis]], are also commonly used. These drugs help to alleviate the symptoms of allergy, and are imperative in the recovery of acute [[anaphylaxis]], but play little role in chronic treatment of allergic disorders.

===Immunotherapy===
{{main|Allergen immunotherapy}}
[[File:Anti-Allergy Immunotherapy.jpg|thumb|Anti-allergy immunotherapy]]
Desensitization or [[hyposensitization]] is a treatment in which the person is gradually [[vaccination|vaccinated]] with progressively larger doses of the allergen in question. This can either reduce the severity or eliminate hypersensitivity altogether. It relies on the progressive skewing of [[IgG]] antibody production, to block excessive IgE production seen in atopys. In a sense, the person builds up immunity to increasing amounts of the allergen in question. Studies have demonstrated the long-term efficacy and the preventive effect of immunotherapy in reducing the development of new allergy.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10963288&quot;/&gt; Meta-analyses have also confirmed efficacy of the treatment in allergic rhinitis in children&lt;ref name=&quot;Penagos06&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Penagos|first=M|coauthors=Compalati, E, Tarantini, F, Baena-Cagnani, R, Huerta, J, Passalacqua, G, Canonica, GW|title=Efficacy of sublingual immunotherapy in the treatment of allergic rhinitis in pediatric patients 3 to 18 years of age: a meta-analysis of randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trials.|journal=Annals of Allergy, Asthma &amp; Immunology|year=2006|month=August|volume=97|issue=2|pages=141–8|pmid=16937742|doi=10.1016/S1081-1206(10)60004-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in asthma.&lt;ref name=Abramson95&gt;{{cite journal|last=Abramson|first=MJ|coauthors=Puy, RM, Weiner, JM|title=Is allergen immunotherapy effective in asthma? A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.|journal=American Journal of Respiratory and Critical care Medicine|year=1995|month=April|volume=151|issue=4|pages=969–74|pmid=7697274}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review by the Mayo Clinic in Rochester confirmed the safety and efficacy of allergen immunotherapy for allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis, allergic forms of asthma, and stinging insect based on numerous well-designed scientific studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17803880&quot;/&gt; In addition, national and international guidelines confirm the clinical efficacy of injection immunotherapy in rhinitis and asthma, as well as the safety, provided that recommendations are followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17418661&quot;/&gt;

A second form of immunotherapy involves the intravenous injection of [[monoclonal antibody|monoclonal]] anti-IgE antibodies. These bind to free and B-cell associated IgE; signalling their destruction. They do not bind to IgE already bound to the Fc receptor on [[basophil]]s and mast cells, as this would stimulate the allergic inflammatory response. The first agent of this class is [[Omalizumab]]. While this form of immunotherapy is very effective in treating several types of atopy, it should ''not'' be used in treating the majority of people with food allergies.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

A third type, [[Sublingual immunotherapy]], is an orally-administered therapy that takes advantage of [[immune tolerance|oral immune tolerance]] to non-pathogenic antigens such as foods and resident bacteria. This therapy currently accounts for 40 percent of allergy treatment in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}} In the United States, sublingual immunotherapy is gaining support among traditional allergists and is endorsed by doctors treating allergy.&lt;ref name=Canonica09&gt;{{cite journal|author=Canonica GW, Bousquet J, Casale T, Lockey R, Baena-Cagnani C ''et al''|title=Sublingual Immunotherapy: World Allergy Organization Position Paper 2009|journal=Allergy|year=2009|month=December|volume=64|issue=Suppl. 91|pages=1–59|doi=10.1111/j.1398-9995.2009.02309.x|pmid=20041860|url=http://www.worldallergy.org/publications/slit-wao-pp_final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Allergy shot treatment is the closest thing to a ‘cure’ for allergic symptoms. This therapy requires a long-term commitment.

===Other===
An experimental treatment, [[enzyme potentiated desensitization]] (EPD), has been tried for decades but is not generally accepted as effective.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15042943&quot;/&gt; EPD uses dilutions of allergen and an enzyme, [[beta-glucuronidase]], to which T-regulatory lymphocytes are supposed to respond by favouring desensitization, or down-regulation, rather than sensitization. EPD has also been tried for the treatment of [[autoimmune diseases]] but is not approved by the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] or of proven effectiveness.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid15042943&quot; /&gt;

Systematic literature searches conducted by the Mayo Clinic through 2006, involving hundreds of articles studying multiple conditions, including asthma and upper respiratory tract infection, showed no effectiveness of homeopathic treatments and no difference compared with placebo. The authors concluded that, based on rigorous clinical trials of all types of homeopathy for childhood and adolescence ailments, there is no convincing evidence that supports the use of homeopathic treatments.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17285788&quot;/&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Many diseases related to inflammation such as [[type 1 diabetes]], [[rheumatoid arthritis]], and allergic diseases — hay fever and asthma — have increased in the [[Western world]] over the past 2-3 decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;Platts&quot;/&gt; Rapid increases in allergic asthma and other atopic disorders in industrialized nations, it is estimated, began in the 1960s and 1970s, with further increases occurring during the 1980s and 1990s,&lt;ref name=&quot; Bloomfield&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bloomfield SF, Stanwell-Smith R, Crevel RW, Pickup J |title=Too clean, or not too clean: the hygiene hypothesis and home hygiene |journal=Clin.

Although genetic factors fundamentally govern susceptibility to atopic disease, increases in atopy have occurred within too short a time frame to be explained by a genetic change in the population, thus pointing to environmental or lifestyle changes.&lt;ref name=&quot; Bloomfield&quot;/&gt; Several hypotheses have been identified to explain this increased prevalence; increased exposure to perennial allergens due to housing changes and increasing time spent indoors, and changes in cleanliness or hygiene that have resulted in the decreased activation of a common immune control mechanism, coupled with dietary changes, obesity and decline in physical exercise.&lt;ref name=Platts/&gt; The [[hygiene hypothesis]] maintains&lt;ref name=&quot;Hay fever, hygiene, and household size&quot;/&gt; that high living standards and hygienic conditions exposes children to fewer infections. It is thought that reduced bacterial and viral infections early in life direct the maturing immune system away from T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1 type responses, leading to unrestrained T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 responses that allow for an increase in allergy.&lt;ref name=Yazdanbakhsh02/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Renz&quot;/&gt;

Changes in rates and types of infection alone however, have been unable to explain the observed increase in allergic disease, and recent evidence has focused attention on the importance of the gastrointestinal microbial environment. Evidence has shown that exposure to food and [[fecal-oral route|fecal-oral]] pathogens, such as [[hepatitis A]], ''[[Toxoplasma gondii]]'', and ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]'' (which also tend to be more prevalent in developing countries), can reduce the overall risk of atopy by more than 60%,&lt;ref name=&quot;Exposure to foodborne and orofecal microbes versus airborne viruses in relation to atopy and allergic asthma: epidemiological study&quot;/&gt; and an increased prevalence of parasitic infections has been associated with a decreased prevalence of asthma.&lt;ref name=&quot;Parasites and asthma--predictive or protective?&quot;/&gt; It is speculated that these infections exert their effect by critically altering T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;1/T&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;2 regulation.&lt;ref name=&quot; Sheikh&quot; /&gt; Important elements of newer hygiene hypotheses also include exposure to [[endotoxin]]s, exposure to [[pet]]s and growing up on a farm.&lt;ref name=&quot; Sheikh&quot;/&gt;

==History==
The concept of &quot;allergy&quot; was originally introduced in 1906 by the [[Vienna, Austria|Viennese]] [[pediatrician]] [[Clemens von Pirquet]], after he noted that some of his patients were hypersensitive to normally innocuous entities such as [[dust]], [[pollen]], or certain foods.&lt;ref&gt;{{WhoNamedIt|Doctor|2382|Clemens Peter Pirquet von Cesenatico}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pirquet called this phenomenon &quot;allergy&quot; from the [[Ancient Greek language|Ancient Greek]] words [[wikt:ἄλλος|ἄλλος]] ''allos'' meaning &quot;other&quot; and [[wikt:ἔργον|ἔργον]] ''ergon'' meaning &quot;work&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allergie&quot;/&gt; All forms of hypersensitivity used to be classified as allergies, and all were thought to be caused by an improper activation of the immune system. Later, it became clear that several different [[disease]] mechanisms were implicated, with the common link to a disordered activation of the immune system. In 1963, a new classification scheme was designed by [[Philip George Houthem Gell|Philip Gell]] and [[Robin Coombs]] that described four types of [[hypersensitivities|hypersensitivity reactions]], known as Type I to Type IV hypersensitivity.&lt;ref name=&quot;GellCoombs&quot;/&gt; With this new classification, the word &quot;allergy&quot; was restricted to type I hypersensitivities (also called immediate hypersensitivity), which are characterized as rapidly developing reactions.

A major breakthrough in understanding the mechanisms of allergy was the discovery of the antibody class labeled [[immunoglobulin E]] (IgE) - [[Kimishige Ishizaka]] and co-workers were the first to isolate and describe IgE in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Physico-chemical properties of human reaginic antibody. IV. Presence of a unique immunoglobulin as a carrier of reaginic activity&quot;/&gt;

==Medical specialty==
An allergist is a physician specially trained to manage and treat [[allergies]], [[asthma]] and the other allergic diseases.
In the [[United States]] physicians holding certification by the American Board of Allergy and Immunology (ABAI) have successfully completed an accredited educational program and an evaluation process, including a secure, proctored examination to demonstrate the knowledge, skills, and experience to the provision of patient care in allergy and immunology.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABAI: American Board of Allergy and Immunology&quot;/&gt; Becoming an allergist/immunologist requires completion of at least nine years of training. After completing medical school and graduating with a medical degree, a physician will then undergo three years of training in [[internal medicine]] (to become an internist) or pediatrics (to become a pediatrician). Once physicians have finished training in one of these specialties, they must pass the exam of either the [[American Board of Pediatrics]] (ABP), the [[American Osteopathic Board of Pediatrics]] (AOBP), the [[American Board of Internal Medicine]] (ABIM) or the [[American Osteopathic Board of Internal Medicine]] (AOBIM). Internists or pediatricians wishing to focus on the sub-specialty of allergy-immunology then complete at least an additional two years of study, called a fellowship, in an allergy/immunology training program. Allergist/immunologists listed as ABAI-certified have successfully passed the certifying examination of the American Board of Allergy and Immunology (ABAI), following their fellowship.&lt;ref name=&quot;AAAAI - What is an Allergist?&quot;/&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], allergy is a subspecialty of [[general medicine]] or [[pediatrics]]. After obtaining postgraduate exams ([[Membership of the Royal College of Physicians|MRCP]] or [[Membership of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health|MRCPCH]] respectively), a doctor works for several years as a [[specialist registrar]] before qualifying for the [[General Medical Council]] specialist register. Allergy services may also be delivered by [[immunologist]]s. A 2003 [[Royal College of Physicians]] report presented a case for improvement of what were felt to be inadequate allergy services in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Royal College of Physicians (2003).
