'''Heredity''' is the passing of traits to offspring (from its parent or ancestors). This is the process by which an offspring [[cell (biology)|cell]] or [[organism]] acquires or becomes predisposed to the characteristics of its parent cell or organism. Through heredity, variations exhibited by individuals can accumulate and cause some [[species]] to [[evolution|evolve]]. The study of heredity in [[biology]] is called [[genetics]], which includes the field of [[epigenetics]].

==Overview==
[[File:ADN static.png|thumb|left|200px|[[DNA]] structure. [[nucleobase|Bases]] are in the centre, surrounded by phosphate–sugar chains in a [[double helix]].]]
In humans, [[eye color]] is an example of an inherited characteristic: an individual might inherit the &quot;brown-eye trait&quot; from one of the parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sturm RA, Frudakis TN |title=Eye colour: portals into pigmentation genes and ancestry |journal=Trends Genet. |volume=20 |issue=8 |pages=327–32 |year=2004 |pmid=15262401 |doi=10.1016/j.tig.2004.06.010 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inherited traits are controlled by [[gene]]s and the complete set of genes within an organism's [[genome]] is called its [[genotype]].&lt;ref name=Pearson_2006&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pearson H |title=Genetics: what is a gene? |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7092 |pages=398–401 |year=2006 |pmid=16724031 |doi=10.1038/441398a |ref=harv|bibcode = 2006Natur.441..398P }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete set of observable traits of the structure and behavior of an organism is called its [[phenotype]]. These traits arise from the interaction of its genotype with the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Visscher PM, Hill WG, Wray NR |title=Heritability in the genomics era—concepts and misconceptions |journal=Nat. Rev. Genet. |volume=9 |issue=4 |pages=255–66 |year=2008 |pmid=18319743 |doi=10.1038/nrg2322 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many aspects of an organism's phenotype are not inherited. For example, [[sun tanning|suntanned]] skin comes from the interaction between a person's genotype and sunlight; thus, suntans are not passed on to people's children. However, some people tan more easily than others, due to differences in their genotype: a striking example is people with the inherited trait of [[albinism]], who do not tan at all and are very sensitive to [[sunburn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Oetting WS, Brilliant MH, King RA |title=The clinical spectrum of albinism in humans |journal=Molecular medicine today |volume=2 |issue=8 |pages=330–5 |year=1996 |pmid=8796918 |doi=10.1016/1357-4310(96)81798-9 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heritable traits are known to be passed from one generation to the next via [[DNA]], a [[molecule]] that encodes genetic information.&lt;ref name=Pearson_2006/&gt; DNA is a long [[polymer]] which incorporates four types of bases which are interchangeable. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specifies the genetic information: this is comparable to a sequence of letters spelling out a passage of text. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the DNA sequence. A portions of a DNA molecule that specifies a single functional unit is called a [[gene]]; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within [[cell (biology)|cells]], the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called [[chromosome]]s. The specific location of a DNA sequence within a chromosome is known as a [[locus (genetics)|locus]]. If the DNA sequence at a particular locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called [[allele]]s. DNA sequences can change through [[mutation]]s, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism.&lt;ref name=Futuyma&gt;{{cite book |last=Futuyma |first=Douglas J. |authorlink=Douglas J. Futuyma |year=2005 |title=Evolution |publisher=Sinauer Associates, Inc |location=Sunderland, Massachusetts |isbn=0-87893-187-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by [[quantitative trait locus|multiple interacting genes]] within and among organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Phillips PC |title=Epistasis—the essential role of gene interactions in the structure and evolution of genetic systems |journal=Nat.

Recent findings have confirmed important examples of heritable changes that cannot be explained by direct agency of the DNA molecule. These phenomena are classed as [[epigenetic]] inheritance systems that are causally or independently evolving over genes. Research into modes and mechanisms of epigenetic inheritance is still in its scientific infancy, however, this area of research has attracted much recent activity as it broadens the scope of heritability and evolutionary biology in general.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jablonk09&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jablonka|first1=E.|last2=Raz|first2=G.|title=Transgenerational epigenetic inheritance: Prevalence, mechanisms, and implications for the study of heredity and evolution.|journal=The Quarterly Review of Biology|volume=84|issue=2|pages=131–176|year=2009|url=http://compgen.unc.edu/wiki/images/d/df/JablonkaQtrRevBio2009.pdf|pmid=19606595|doi=10.1086/598822}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[DNA methylation]] marking [[chromatin]], self-sustaining [[Metabolism#Evolution | metabolic loops]], gene silencing by [[RNA interference]], and the three dimensional [[Protein structure|conformation]] of proteins (such as [[prions]]) are areas where epigenetic inheritance systems have been discovered at the organismic level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bossdorf10&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bossdorf|first1=O.|last2=Arcuri|first2=D.|last3=Richards|first3=C.

For example, ecological inheritance through the process of [[niche construction]] is defined by the regular and repeated activities of organisms in their environment. This generates a legacy of effect that modifies and feeds back into the selection regime of subsequent generations. Descendants inherit genes plus environmental characteristics generated by the ecological actions of ancestors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Laland06&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Perspective: Seven reasons (not) to neglect niche construction|last1 =Laland|first1 =K.

==Relation to theory of evolution==
{{Main|Charles Darwin}}
{{See also|Evolution}}
When [[Charles Darwin]] proposed his theory of [[evolution]] in 1859, one of its major problems was the lack of an underlying mechanism for heredity.  Darwin believed in a mix of blending inheritance and the inheritance of acquired [[Trait (biology)|trait]]s ([[pangenesis]]). Blending inheritance would lead to uniformity across populations in only a few generations and thus would remove variation from a population on which natural selection could act.  This led to Darwin adopting some Lamarckian ideas in later editions of ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' and his later biological works. Darwin's primary approach to heredity was to outline how it appeared to work (noticing that traits that were not expressed explicitly in the parent at the time of reproduction could be inherited, that certain traits could be [[sex]]-linked, etc.) rather than suggesting mechanisms.

Darwin's initial model of heredity was adopted by, and then heavily modified by, his cousin [[Francis Galton]], who laid the framework for the [[biometric]] school of heredity. Galton rejected the aspects of Darwin's pangenesis model, which relied on acquired traits.

The inheritance of acquired traits was shown to have little basis in the 1880s when [[August Weismann]] cut the [[tail]]s off many generations of [[mouse|mice]] and found that their offspring continued to develop tails.

== History ==
The [[ancient history|ancients]] had a variety of ideas about heredity: [[Theophrastus]] proposed that male flowers caused female flowers to ripen; [[Hippocrates]] speculated that &quot;seeds&quot; were produced by various body parts and transmitted to offspring at the time of conception; and [[Aristotle]] thought that male and female semen mixed at conception. [[Aeschylus]], in [[458 BC]], proposed the male as the parent, with the female as a &quot;nurse for the young life sown within her.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Eumenides'' 658-661&lt;/ref&gt;

Various hereditary mechanisms were envisaged without being properly tested or quantified.  These included [[blending inheritance]] and the [[inheritance of acquired traits]].  Nevertheless, people were able to develop domestic breeds of animals as well as crops through [[artificial selection]].  The inheritance of acquired traits also formed a part of early [[Lamarckian]] ideas on evolution.

During the 18th century, Dutch microscopist [[Antonie van Leeuwenhoek]] (1632–1723) discovered &quot;animalcules&quot; in the sperm of humans and other animals. Some scientists speculated they saw a &quot;little man&quot; ([[homunculus]]) inside each [[spermatozoon|sperm]]. These scientists formed a school of thought known as the &quot;spermists.&quot; They contended the only contributions of the female to the next generation were the womb in which the homunculus grew, and prenatal influences of the womb. An opposing school of thought, the ovists, believed that the future human was in the egg, and that sperm merely stimulated the growth of the egg. Ovists thought women carried eggs containing boy and girl children, and that the gender of the offspring was determined well before conception.

However, his work was not widely known and was rediscovered in 1901. It was initially assumed the Mendelian inheritance only accounted for large (qualitative) differences, such as those seen by Mendel in his pea plants&amp;mdash;and the idea of additive effect of (quantitative) genes was not realised until [[Ronald Fisher|R.A. Fisher]]'s (1918) paper, &quot;[[The Correlation Between Relatives on the Supposition of Mendelian Inheritance]]&quot;  Mendel's overall contribution gave scientists a useful overview that traits were inheritable.  As of today, his pea plant demonstration became the foundation of the study of Mendelian Traits.  These traits can be traced on a single locus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlson p. 206&quot;&gt;Carlson, Neil and et al. &quot;Psychology the Science of Bahaviour&quot;, p. 206. Pearson Canada, United States of America. ISBN 978-0-205-64524-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern development of genetics and heredity===
{{Main|History of genetics|Modern evolutionary synthesis}}
In the 1930s, work by Fisher and others resulted in a combination of Mendelian and biometric schools into the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]]. The modern synthesis bridged the gap between experimental geneticists and naturalists; and between both and palaeontologists, stating that:&lt;ref&gt;Mayr &amp; Provine 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mayr E. 1982. ''The growth of biological thought: diversity, evolution &amp; inheritance''. Harvard, Cambs. p567 et seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

#All evolutionary phenomena can be explained in a way consistent with known genetic mechanisms and the observational evidence of naturalists.
#Evolution is gradual: small genetic changes, recombination ordered by natural selection. Discontinuities amongst species (or other taxa) are explained as originating gradually through geographical separation and extinction (not saltation).
#[[Natural selection|Selection]] is overwhelmingly the main mechanism of change; even slight advantages are important when continued. The object of selection is the [[phenotype]] in its surrounding environment. The role of [[genetic drift]] is equivocal; though strongly supported initially by [[Dobzhansky]], it was downgraded later as results from ecological genetics were obtained.
#The primacy of population thinking: the genetic diversity carried in natural populations is a key factor in evolution. The strength of natural selection in the wild was greater than expected; the effect of ecological factors such as niche occupation and the significance of barriers to gene flow are all important.
#In palaeontology, the ability to explain historical observations by extrapolation from micro to macro-evolution is proposed. Historical contingency means explanations at different levels may exist. Gradualism does not mean constant rate of change.

The idea that [[speciation]] occurs after populations are reproductively isolated has been much debated. In plants, polyploidy must be included in any view of speciation. Formulations such as 'evolution consists primarily of changes in the [[allele frequency|frequencies of alleles]] between one generation and another' were proposed rather later. The traditional view is that developmental biology ('[[evo-devo]]') played little part in the synthesis, but an account of [[Gavin de Beer]]'s work by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] suggests he may be an exception.&lt;ref&gt;Gould S.J. ''Ontogeny and phylogeny''. Harvard 1977. p221-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all aspects of the synthesis have been challenged at times, with varying degrees of success. There is no doubt, however, that the synthesis was a great landmark in evolutionary biology. It cleared up many confusions, and was directly responsible for stimulating a great deal of research in the post-[[World War II]] era.

[[Trofim Lysenko]] however caused a backlash of what is now called [[Lysenkoism]] in the [[Soviet Union]] when he emphasised [[Lamarckian]] ideas on the [[inheritance of acquired traits]]. This movement affected agricultural research and led to food shortages in the 1960s and seriously affected the USSR.

:*[[Huntington’s disease]]
:*[[Phenylketonuria]] (PKU)
:*[[Hemophilia]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Carlson p. 206&quot;/&gt;

==Types of heredity==

===Dominant and recessive alleles===
An [[allele]] is said to be dominant if it is always expressed in the appearance of an organism (phenotype) provided that at least one copy of it is present. For example, in peas the allele for green pods, ''G'', is dominant to that for yellow pods, ''g''. Thus pea plants with the pair of alleles '''''either''''' ''GG'' (homozygote) '''''or''''' ''Gg'' (heterozygote) will have green pods. The allele for yellow pods is recessive. The effects of this allele are only seen when it is present in both chromosomes, ''gg'' (homozygote).

The description of a mode of biological inheritance consists of three main categories:

:'''1. Number of involved [[Locus (genetics)|loci]]'''
:*[[Monogenetic]] (also called &quot;simple&quot;) – one [[Locus (genetics)|locus]]
:*[[Oligogenetic]] – few loci
:*[[Polygenetic]] – many loci

:'''2. Involved [[chromosome]]s'''
:*[[Autosomal]] – loci are not situated on a [[sex chromosome]]
:*[[Gonosomal]] – loci are situated on a [[sex chromosome]]
:**X-chromosomal – loci are situated on the [[X chromosome|X-chromosome]] (the more common case)
:**Y-chromosomal – loci are situated on the [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]]
:*[[Mitochondrial]] – loci are situated on the [[mitochondrial DNA]]

:'''3. Correlation [[genotype]]–[[phenotype]]'''
:*[[Dominance_relationship#Dominant_allele|Dominant]]
:*Intermediate (also called &quot;[[Codominance|codominant]]&quot;)
:*[[Recessive]]

These three categories are part of every exact description of a mode of inheritance in the above order. In addition, more specifications may be added as follows:

:'''4. Coincidental and environmental interactions'''

:*[[Penetrance]]
:**Complete
:**Incomplete (percentual number)
:*[[Expressivity]]
:**Invariable
:**Variable
:*[[Heritability]] (in polygenetic and sometimes also in oligogenetic modes of inheritance)
:*Maternal or paternal [[imprinting (genetics)|imprinting]] phenomena (also see [[epigenetics]])

:'''5. Sex-linked interactions'''

:*Sex-linked inheritance ([[gonosomal]] loci)
:*[[Sex-limited]] phenotype expression (e.g., [[cryptorchism]])
:*Inheritance through the maternal line (in case of [[mitochondrial DNA]] loci)
:*Inheritance through the paternal line (in case of [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosomal]] loci)

:'''6. Locus–locus interactions'''
:*[[Epistasis]] with other loci (e.g., [[overdominance]])
:*[[Gene coupling]] with other loci (also see [[Chromosomal crossover|crossing over]])
:*Homozygotous [[lethal factor]]s
:*[[Semi-lethal factor]]s

Determination and description of a mode of inheritance is achieved primarily through statistical analysis of pedigree data. In case the involved loci are known, methods of [[molecular genetics]] can also be employed.
