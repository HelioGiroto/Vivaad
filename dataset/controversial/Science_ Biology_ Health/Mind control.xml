'''Mind control''' (also known as '''brainwashing''', '''coercive persuasion''', '''mind abuse''', '''menticide''', '''thought control''', or '''thought reform''') refers to a process in which a group or individual &quot;systematically uses unethically [[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]] methods to persuade others to conform to the wishes of the manipulator(s), often to the detriment of the person being manipulated&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csj.org/studyindex/studycult/cultqa.htm |title=Cults: Questions and Answers |first=Michael |last=Langone |authorlink=Michael Langone |work=www.csj.org |publisher=[[International Cultic Studies Association]] |accessdate=2009-12-27 |quote=Mind control (also referred to as 'brainwashing,' 'coercive persuasion,' 'thought reform,' and the 'systematic manipulation of psychological and social influence') refers to a process in which a group or individual systematically uses unethically manipulative methods to persuade others to conform to the wishes of the manipulator(s), often to the detriment of the person being manipulated.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term has been applied to any tactic, [[psychological]] or otherwise, which can be seen as subverting an individual's sense of control over their own [[thinking]], behavior, emotions or decision making.  In [[Propaganda: The Formation of Men's Attitudes]], [[Jacques Ellul]] maintains that the &quot;principal aims of these psychological methods is to destroy a man's habitual patterns, space, hours, milieu, and so on.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ellul, Jacques (1973). ''Propaganda: The Formation of Men’s Attitudes'', p. 113.Trans. Konrad Kellen &amp; Jean Lerner. Vintage Books, New York. ISBN 978-0-394-71874-3.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Theories of brainwashing and of mind control were originally developed to explain how [[totalitarian]] regimes appeared to succeed in systematically indoctrinating [[prisoners of war]] through [[propaganda]] and [[torture]] techniques.  These theories were later expanded and modified to explain a wider range of phenomena, especially conversions to [[new religious movements]] (NRMs). 

==Korean War and the origin of brainwashing==
{{see also|Thought reform in the People's Republic of China}}

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' records its earliest known English-language usage of ''brainwashing'' in an article by Edward Hunter in ''Miami News'' published on 7 October 1950. During the [[Korean War]], Hunter, who worked at the time both as a journalist and as a U.S. intelligence agent, wrote a series of books and articles on the theme of Chinese brainwashing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Marks |first=John |authorlink=John D. Marks |title=The Search for the Manchurian Candidate: The CIA and Mind Control |url= http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/LSD/marks.htm |accessdate=2008-12-30 |year=1979 |publisher=Times Books |location=New York |isbn=0-8129-0773-6 |chapter=8. Brainwashing |chapterurl=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/lsd/marks8.htm |quote=In September 1950, the ''[[The Miami News|Miami News]]'' published an article by Edward Hunter titled '&quot;Brain-Washing&quot; Tactics Force Chinese into Ranks of Communist Party.' It was the first printed use in any language of the term &quot;brainwashing,&quot; which quickly became a stock phrase in Cold War headlines. Hunter, a CIA propaganda operator who worked under cover as a journalist, turned out a steady stream of books and articles on the subject.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese term {{lang|zh|洗腦}} (''xǐ năo'', literally &quot;wash [[Human brain|brain]]&quot;)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=worddict&amp;wdrst=0&amp;wdqb=%E6%B4%97%E8%85%A6 Chinese English Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt; was originally used to describe methodologies of coercive persuasion used under the Maoist regime in China, which aimed to transform individuals with a reactionary imperialist [[mindset]] into &quot;right-thinking&quot; members of the new Chinese social system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |last= Taylor |first= Kathleen |authorlink= Kathleen Taylor (biologist) |title= Brainwashing: The Science of Thought Control |url= http://books.google.com/?id=D3tYeMLc4hQC |accessdate= 2010-07-02 |year= 2006 |publisher= Oxford University Press |location= Oxford |isbn= 978-0-19-920478-6 |page= 5|pages= 336}}&lt;/ref&gt; To that end the regime developed techniques that would break down the [[psyche (psychology)|psychic]] integrity of the individual with regard to information processing, information retained in the mind and individual values. Chosen techniques included dehumanizing of individuals by keeping them in filth, [[sleep deprivation]], partial [[sensory deprivation]], psychological harassment, inculcation of [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]] and [[peer pressure|group social pressure]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The term [[pun]]ned on the [[Taoist]] custom of &quot;cleansing/washing the heart/mind&quot;&lt;ref&gt;'''Note:''' [[wikt:心|心]] can mean &quot;heart&quot;, &quot;mind&quot; or &quot;centre&quot; depending on context. For example, {{lang|zh|[[:zh:心脏病|心脏病]]}} means [[Cardiovascular disease]], but {{lang|zh|[[:zh:心理医生|心理医生]]}} means [[psychologist]], and {{lang|zh|[[:zh:市中心|市中心]]}} means [[Central business district]].&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang|zh|洗心}}, ''xǐ xīn'') prior to conducting certain ceremonies or entering certain holy places.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} 

Hunter and those who picked up the Chinese term used it to explain why, unlike in earlier wars, a relatively high percentage of [[United States|American]] [[GI (military)|GI]]s defected to the enemy side after becoming prisoners-of-war. It was believed that the Chinese in North Korea used such techniques to disrupt the ability of captured troops to effectively [[community organizing|organize]] and resist their imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Browning |title=Was Kidnapped Utah Teen Brainwashed? |work=[[Palm Beach Post]] |location=Palm Beach |issn=1528-5758 |date=2003-03-14 |quote=During the Korean War, captured American soldiers were subjected to prolonged interrogations and harangues by their captors, who often worked in relays and used the &quot;good-cop, bad-cop&quot; approach, alternating a brutal interrogator with a gentle one.

The most prominent case in the U.S. was that of [[Frank Schwable]], who confessed to having participated in germ warfare while in captivity.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F40C16FC3C5A107B93C1AB1789D85F478585F9 &quot;Red Germ Charges Cite 2 U.S. Marines,&quot; February 23, 1954], accessed February 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, two studies of the [[repatriation]] of American prisoners of war by [[Robert Jay Lifton]]&lt;ref name='Home_by_Ship'&gt;{{cite journal |title=Home by Ship: Reaction Patterns of American Prisoners of War Repatriated from North Korea |journal=American Journal of Psychiatry |date=1954-04 |first=Robert J. |last=Lifton |volume=110 |issue=10 |pages=732–739|url=http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/110/10/732 |accessdate=2008-03-30 |pmid=13138750 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.110.10.732}} Cited in ''[[Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Edgar Schein]]&lt;ref name='Schein'&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Chinese Indoctrination Program for Prisoners of War: A Study of Attempted Brainwashing |journal=Psychiatry |date=1956-05 |first=Edgar |last=Schein |volume=19 |issue=2 |pages=149–172 |pmid=13323141}} Cited in ''[[Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism]]''&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that brainwashing (called &quot;thought reform&quot; by Lifton and &quot;coercive persuasion&quot; by Schein) had a transient effect. Both researchers found that the Chinese mainly used coercive persuasion to disrupt the ability of the prisoners to organize and maintain morale and hence to escape. By placing the prisoners under conditions of physical and [[social deprivation]] and disruption, and then by offering them more comfortable situations such as better sleeping quarters, better food, warmer clothes or blankets, the Chinese did succeed in getting some of the prisoners to make [[anti-Americanism|anti-American]] statements. Nevertheless, the majority of prisoners did not actually adopt [[Communist]] beliefs, instead behaving as though they did in order to avoid the plausible threat of extreme physical abuse. Both researchers also concluded that such coercive persuasion succeeded only on a minority of POWs, and that the end-result of such coercion remained very unstable, as most of the individuals reverted to their previous condition soon after they left the coercive environment. In 1961 they both published books expanding on these findings. Schein published ''Coercive Persuasion''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Schein, Edgar H. |title=Coercive Persuasion: A Socio-Psychological Analysis of the &quot;Brainwashing&quot; of American Civilian Prisoners by the Chinese Communists |publisher=W.W. Norton |location=New York |year=1971 |isbn=0-393-00613-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lifton published ''Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lifton |first=RJ |authorlink=Robert Jay Lifton |title=''Thought Reform and the Psychology of Totalism; a Study of &quot;Brainwashing&quot; in China'' |origyear=1961 |year=1989 |publisher=[[University of North Carolina Press]] |location=Chapel Hill |isbn=0-8078-4253-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent writers including [[Mikhail Heller]] have suggested that Lifton's model of brainwashing may throw light on the use of mass propaganda in other communist states such as the former [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Heller |first=Mikhail |others=Translated by David Floyd |title=''Cogs in the Soviet Wheel: The Formation of Soviet Man'' |year=1988 |publisher=Collins Harvill |location=London |isbn=0-00-272516-9 |quote=Dr [Robert J.] Lifton draws attention to a fact of exceptional importance: the effect of 'brainwashing' and its methods is felt even by those whom he calls the 'apparent resisters', those who seem not to succumb to the intoxication. This study showed that they do assimilate what has been hammered into their brain but the effect comes only a certain time after their liberation, like the explosion of a delayed-action bomb. It is not hard to imagine the effect which 'education' and 're-education' has upon the Soviet citizen, who is exposed from the day he is born to 'brainwashing', bombarded every day, round the clock, by all the means of propaganda and persuasion.}} Heller's footnote explains the phrase &quot;the means of propaganda and persuasion&quot; as &quot;[t]he official name for the means of communication in the USSR. The accepted abbreviation is SMIP [literally from the Russian phrase meaning 'means of mass information and propaganda'].&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In a summary published in 1963, [[Edgar Schein]] gave a background history of the precursor origins of the brainwashing phenomenon:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Thought reform contains elements which are evident in Chinese culture (emphasis on interpersonal sensitivity, learning by rote and self-cultivation); in methods of extracting confessions well known in the [[Papal Inquisition]] (13th century) and elaborated through the centuries, especially by the [[Russian secret police]]; in methods of organizing corrective [[prison]]s, [[mental hospital]]s and other institutions for producing value change; in methods used by [[religious sect]]s, [[fraternal order]]s, [[political elite]]s or [[primitive society|primitive societies]] for converting or initiating new members. Thought reform techniques are consistent with psychological principles but were not explicitly derived from such principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schein |first=Edgar Henry |author-link=Edgar Schein |publication-date=1963 |contribution=Brainwashing |title=[[Encyclopædia Britannica]] |edition=14th (revised) |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. |volume=4 |page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mind-control theories from the Korean War era came under criticism in subsequent years. According to forensic psychologist [[Dick Anthony]], the [[CIA]] invented the concept of &quot;brainwashing&quot; as a propaganda strategy to undercut communist claims that American POWs in Korean communist camps had voluntarily expressed sympathy for communism. Anthony stated that definitive research demonstrated that [[fear]] and [[duress]], not brainwashing, caused western POWs to collaborate. He argued that the books of Edward Hunter (whom he identified as a secret CIA &quot;psychological warfare specialist&quot; passing as a journalist) pushed the CIA brainwashing theory onto the general public. He further asserted that for twenty years, starting in the early 1950s, the CIA and the [[United States Department of Defense|Defense Department]] conducted secret research (notably including [[Project MKULTRA]]) in an attempt to develop practical brainwashing techniques, and that their attempt failed.&lt;ref name=Anthony&gt;{{cite journal |author=Anthony, Dick |year=1999 |title=Pseudoscience and Minority Religions: An Evaluation of the Brainwashing Theories of Jean-Marie |journal=Social Justice Research |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=421–456 |doi=10.1023/A:1022081411463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. military and government laid charges of  &quot;brainwashing&quot; in an effort to  undermine  detailed confessions made by U.S. military personnel to war crimes, including biological warfare, against the Koreans.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Endicott and Edward Hagerman, ''The United States and Biological Warfare: Secrets From the Early Cold War'' (Indiana University Press, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frank Schwable]], Chief of Staff of the [[1st Marine Aircraft Wing|First Marine Air Wing]] was shot down in North Korea. After Chinese radio broadcasts claimed to quote him admitting to participating in germ warfare, United Nations commander Gen. [[Mark W. Clark]] denounced said: &quot;Whether these statements ever passed the lips of these unfortunate men is doubtful. If they did, however, too familiar are the mind-annihilating methods of these Communists in extorting whatever words they want .... The men themselves are not to blame, and they have my deepest sympathy for having been used in this abominable way.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10C10FC3D5B107A93C6AB1789D85F478585F9 &quot;Clark Denounces Germ War Charges,&quot; February 24, 1953], accessed February 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In August{{date?}}, Secretary of Defense [[Charles Erwin Wilson|Charles E. Wilson]] set up a task force to study the response of U.S. prisoners of war to brainwashing.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F40E16F83A5A107B93C1AB1783D85F408585F9 &quot;Officers to Study 'Brainwash' Issue,&quot; August 23, 1954], accessed February 16, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==Army report debunks brainwashing of American prisoners of war==
In 1956 the U.S Department of the Army published a report entitled ''Communist Interrogation, Indoctrination, and Exploitation of Prisoners of War'' which called brainwashing a &quot;popular misconception.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = U.S Department of the Army  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors = | title = Communist Interrogation, Indoctrination, and Exploitation of Prisoners of War.  |publisher =U.S Gov't Printing Office  | series =  | volume =  | edition =Pamphlet No. 30-101  | date =15 May 1956  | location =  | pages = 17 &amp; 51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report states &quot;exhaustive research of several government agencies failed to reveal even one conclusively documented case of 'brainwashing' of an American prisoner of war in Korea.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CommunistInterogation51&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Communist Interrogation, Indoctrination, and Exploitation of Prisoners of War|1956|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While US POW's captured by North Korea were brutalized with starvation, beatings, forced death marches, exposure to extremes of temperature, binding in stress positions, and withholding of medical care, the abuse had no relation to indoctrination or collecting intelligence information &quot;in which they [North Korea] were not particularly interested.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Communist Interrogation, Indoctrination, and Exploitation of Prisoners of War|1956|p=15}}North Koreans considered US POWs illegal invaders and asserted they were not protected by the Geneva Conventions.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast American POW's in the custody of the Chinese Communists did face a concerted interrogation and indoctrination program--but the Chinese did not employ deliberate physical abuse.  &quot;Extensive research has disclosed that systematic, physical torture was not employed in connection with interrogation or indoctrination,&quot; the report states.&lt;ref name=&quot;CommunistInterogation51&quot;/&gt; 

The Chinese elicited information using tricks such as harmless-seeming written questionnaires, followed by interviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Communist Interrogation, Indoctrination, and Exploitation of Prisoners of War|1956|p=20-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;most insidious&quot; and effective Chinese technique according to the US Army Report was a convivial display of false friendship:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;[w]hen an American soldier was captured by the Chinese, he was given a vigorous handshake and a pat on the back. The enemy 'introduced' himself as a friend of the 'workers' of America . . . in many instances the Chinese did not search the American captives, but frequently offered them American cigarettes. This display of friendship caught most Americans totally off-guard and they never recovered from the initial impression made by the Chinese. . .  .  [A]fter the initial contact with the enemy, some Americans seemed to believe that the enemy was sincere and harmless.  They relaxed and permitted themselves to be lulled into a well-disguised trap [of cooperating with] the cunning enemy.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Communist Interrogation, Indoctrination, and Exploitation of Prisoners of War|1956|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It was this surprising, disarmingly friendly treatment, that &quot;was successful to some degree,&quot; the report concludes, in undermining hatred of the communists among American soldiers, in persuading some to sign anti-American confessions, and even leading a few to reject repatriation and remain in Communist China.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Communist Interrogation, Indoctrination, and Exploitation of Prisoners of War|1956|p=50-51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cults and the shift of focus==
After the Korean War, applications of mind control theories in the United States shifted in focus from [[politics]] to [[religion]]. From the 1960s an increasing number of American youths started to come into contact with new religious movements (NRM), and some who converted suddenly adopted beliefs and behaviors that differed greatly from those of their families and friends; in some cases they neglected or even broke contact with their loved ones. In the 1970s the [[anti-cult movement]] applied mind control theories to explain these sudden and seemingly dramatic [[religious conversion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=J.

===Theories of mind control and religious conversion===
Over the years various theories of [[religious conversion|conversion]] and member retention have been proposed{{By whom|date=February 2010}} that link mind control to NRMs, and particularly those religious movements referred to as &quot;[[cult]]s&quot; by their critics. These theories resemble the original political brainwashing theories with some minor changes. [[Philip Zimbardo]] discusses mind control as &quot;the process by which individual or collective freedom of choice and action is compromised by agents or agencies that modify or distort perception, motivation, affect, cognition and/or behavioral outcomes&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zimbardo |first=Philip G. |authorlink=Philip Zimbardo |year=2002 |month= November |title=Mind Control: Psychological Reality or Mindless Rhetoric? |journal=Monitor on Psychology |url=http://www.icsahome.com/infoserv_articles/zimbardo_philip_mindcontrol.htm |accessdate=2008-12-30 |quote=Mind control is the process by which individual or collective freedom of choice and action is compromised by agents or agencies that modify or distort perception, motivation, affect, cognition and/or behavioral outcomes. It is neither magical nor mystical, but a process that involves a set of basic social psychological principles. Conformity, compliance, persuasion, dissonance, reactance, guilt and fear arousal, modeling and identification are some of the staple social influence ingredients well studied in psychological experiments and field studies. In some combinations, they create a powerful crucible of extreme mental and behavioral [[psychological manipulation|manipulation]] when synthesized with several other real-world factors, such as charismatic, authoritarian leaders, dominant ideologies, social isolation, physical debilitation, induced phobias, and extreme threats or promised rewards that are typically deceptively orchestrated, over an extended time period in settings where they are applied intensively. A body of social science evidence shows that when systematically practiced by state-sanctioned police, military or destructive cults, mind control can induce false confessions, create converts who willingly torture or kill 'invented enemies,' and engage indoctrinated members to work tirelessly, give up their money—and even their lives—for 'the cause.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he suggests that any human being is susceptible to such manipulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zimbardo |first=P |authorlink=Philip Zimbardo |url= http://www.csj.org/studyindex/studycult/study_zimbar.htm |page=14 |title=What messages are behind today's cults? |journal=Monitor on Psychology |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1999 book, Robert Lifton also applied his original ideas about thought reform to [[Aum Shinrikyo]], concluding that in this context thought reform was possible without violence or physical coercion. [[Margaret Singer]], who also spent time studying the political brainwashing of Korean prisoners of war, agreed with this conclusion: in her book ''[[Cults in Our Midst]]'' she describes six conditions which would create an atmosphere in which thought reform is possible.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refocus.org/singerne.html ''Cults in Our Midst: The Continuing Fight Against Their Hidden Menace''], Margaret Thaler Singer, Jossey-Bass, publisher, April 2003, ISBN 0-7879-6741-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Approaching the subject from the perspective of [[neuroscience]] and [[social psychology]], [[Kathleen Taylor (biologist)|Kathleen Taylor]] suggests that manipulation of the [[prefrontal cortex]] activates &quot;brainwashing&quot;, rendering a person more susceptible to black-and-white thinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Kathleen Eleanor |authorlink=Kathleen Taylor (biologist) |title=[[Brainwashing: The Science of Thought Control]] |url=http://books.google.com/?id=BIuju20yhDkC&amp;dq |accessdate=2009-07-30 |month= December |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-280496-9 |page=215 |quote=Your susceptibility to brainwashing (and other forms of influence) has much to do with the state of your brain. This will depend in part on your genes: research suggests that prefrontal function is substantially affected by genetics. Low educational achievement, [[dogmatism]], stress, and other factors which affect prefrontal function encourage simplistic, black-and-white thinking. If you have neglected your neurons, failed to stimulate your synapses, obstinately resisted new experiences, or hammered your [[prefrontal cortex]] with drugs (including alcohol), lack of sleep, rollercoaster emotions, or chronic stress, you may well be susceptible to the totalist charms of the next charismatic you meet. This is why so many young people baffle their more phlegmatic elders by joining cults, developing obsessions with [[fashion]]s and celebrities, and forming intense attachments to often unsuitable role models. |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in ''Influence, Science and Practice'', social psychologist [[Robert Cialdini]] argues that mind control is possible through the covert exploitation of the unconscious rules that underlie and facilitate healthy human social interactions. He states that common social rules can be used to prey upon the unwary. Using categories, he offers specific examples of both mild and extreme mind control (both one on one and in groups), notes the conditions under which each social rule is most easily exploited for false ends, and offers suggestions on how to resist such methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cialdini, Robert B. |title=Influence: the psychology of persuasion |publisher=Collins |location=London |year=2007 |pages= epilogue |isbn=0-06-124189-X |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deprogramming and the anti-cult movement===
Both academic and non-academic critics of [[destructive cult]]s have adopted and adapted the theories of Singer, Lifton and other researchers from the inception of the anti-cult movement{{When|date=February 2010}} onwards. Such critics often argue that certain religious groups use mind control techniques to unethically recruit and maintain members. Many of these critics advocated or engaged in [[deprogramming]] as a method to liberate group members from apparent brainwashing. However, the practice of [[deprogramming]] fell out of favor in the West and was largely superseded by [[exit counseling]]. Exit counselor [[Steven Hassan]] promotes what he calls the &quot;BITE&quot; model in his book ''[[Releasing the Bonds|Releasing the Bonds: Empowering People to Think for Themselves]]'' (2000).&lt;ref name=&quot;RTBCh2&quot; &gt;''[[Releasing the Bonds]]: Empowering People to Think for Themselves'', Steven Hassan, Ch. 2, Aitan Publishing Company, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The BITE model describes various controls over human behavior, information, thought and emotion.&lt;ref name=&quot;RTBCh2&quot;/&gt; Hassan claims that cults recruit and retain members by using, among other things, systematic deception, [[behavior modification]], the withholding of information, and emotionally intense persuasion techniques (such as the induction of [[phobia]]s). He refers to all of these techniques collectively as &quot;mind control&quot;.

Critics of mind control theories caution against the broader implications of these conversion models. In the 1998 Enquete Commission report on &quot;So-called Sects and Psychogroups&quot; in Germany, a review was made of the BITE model. The report concluded that &quot;control of these areas of action is an inevitable component of social interactions in a group or community. The social control that is always associated with intense commitment to a group must therefore be clearly distinguished from the exertion of intentional, methodical influence for the express purpose of manipulation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agpf.de/Bundestag-Enquete-english.pdf Final Report of the Enquete Commission on &quot;So-called Sects and Psychogroups&quot; New Religious and Ideological Communities and Psychogroups in the Federal Republic of Germany]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed virtually all of these models share the notion that converts are in fact innocent &quot;victims&quot; of mind-control techniques.&lt;ref name=BarkerAReview/&gt; Hassan suggests that even the cult members manipulating the new converts may themselves be sincerely misled people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Hassan, Steven |title=Combatting cult mind control |publisher=Park Street Press |location=Rochester, Vt |year=1988 |isbn= 0-89281-243-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By considering NRM members innocent &quot;victims&quot; of psychological coercion these theories open the door for [[psychotherapy|psychological treatments]].

The anti-cult movement is not without its critics.  Although most scholars seem to accept that brainwashing exists, a minority of sociologists who commonly refer to themselves as 'sociologists of religion' assert that the anti-cult movement uses brainwashing to its own financial gain.  Perhaps notable among the sociologists of religion is [[Eileen Barker]], who criticizes theories of conversion precisely because they function to justify costly interventions such as deprogramming or exit counseling.&lt;ref name=BarkerJoke&gt;{{cite journal |author=Barker, Eileen |year=1995 |title=The Scientific Study of Religion? You Must Be Joking! |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=287–310 |doi=10.2307/1386880 |publisher=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Vol. 34, No. 3 |jstor=1386880}}&lt;/ref&gt; For similar reasons, Barker and other scholars have criticized [[mental health]] professionals like [[Margaret Singer]] for accepting lucrative expert witness jobs in court cases involving NRMs.&lt;ref name=BarkerJoke/&gt; Singer was perhaps the most publicly notable scholarly proponent of &quot;cult&quot; brainwashing theories, and she became the focal point of the relative demise of those same theories within her discipline.&lt;ref name=BromleyEncy/&gt;  

The anti-cult movement and scholars are quick to point out that Barker and other sociologists of religion are frequently paid by cults to provide legal services on their behalf.&lt;ref name= 'Zablocki1997'&gt;{{cite journal |title=THE BLACKLISTING OF A CONCEPT: THE STRANGE HISTORY OF THE BRAINWASHING CONJECTURE IN THE SOCIOLOGY OF RELIGION |journal=Nova religio |date=1997-10 |first=Benjamin. |last=Zablocki |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=96-121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholarly debate===
[[James Richardson (sociologist)|James Richardson]] observes that if the NRMs had access to powerful brainwashing techniques, one would expect that NRMs would have high growth rates, yet in fact most have not had notable success in recruitment.  Most adherents participate for only a short time, and the success in retaining members is limited.&lt;ref name= 'Richardson1985'&gt;{{cite journal |title=The active vs. passive convert: paradigm conflict in conversion/recruitment research |journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion |date=1985-06 |first=James T. |last=Richardson |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages=163–179 |doi=10.2307/1386340 |publisher=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion, Vol. 24, No. 2 |jstor=1386340}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this and other reasons, sociologists of religion including [[David Bromley]] and [[Anson Shupe]] consider the idea that &quot;cults&quot; are brainwashing American youth to be &quot;implausible.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;brain_wash&quot;&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/brain_wa.htm Brainwashing by Religious Cults&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to Bromley, [[Thomas Robbins (sociologist)|Thomas Robbins]], [[Dick Anthony]], [[Eileen Barker]], [[Newton Maloney]], [[Massimo Introvigne]], [[John Hall (sociologist)|John Hall]], [[Lorne Dawson]], [[Anson Shupe]], [[Gordon Melton]], [[Marc Galanter]], [[Saul Levine]] (amongst other scholars researching NRMs) have argued and established to the satisfaction of courts, of relevant professional associations and of scientific communities that there exists no scientific theory, generally accepted and based upon methodologically sound research, that supports the brainwashing theories as advanced by the anti-cult movement.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, James T. 2009. &quot;Religion and The Law&quot; in The Oxford Handbook of the Sociology of Religion. Peter Clarke. (ed) Oxford Handbooks Online. p. 426 &lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars disagree with this consensus amongst sociologists of religion. [[Benjamin Zablocki]] asserts that it's obvious that brainwashing occurs, at least to any objective observer; the &quot;real sociological issue&quot;, he states, is whether &quot;brainwashing occurs frequently enough to be considered an important social problem&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zablocki1997&quot;/&gt;  Zablocki disagrees with scholars like Richardson, stating that Richardson's observation is flawed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zablocki2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Zablocki|first=Benjamin|title=Misunderstanding Cults: Searching for Objectivity in a Controversial Field|year=2001|publisher=U of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-8188-6|pages=176}}&lt;/ref&gt;   According to Zablocki, Richardson misunderstands brainwashing, conceiving of it as a recruiting process, instead of a retaining process.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zablocki2001&quot;/&gt;  So although Richardson's data are correct, Zablocki states, properly understood, brainwashing does not imply that NRMs will have a notable success in recruitment; so the criticism is inapt.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zablocki2001&quot;/&gt;  Additionally, Zablocki attempts to debunk the other criticisms Richardson, et al., apply to brainwashing: if Zablocki is correct, there's a plethora of evidence in favor of the claim that some NRMs brainwash some of their members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zablocki2001&quot;/&gt;  Perhaps most notably, Zablocki says, the sheer number of former cult leaders and ex-members who attest to brainwashing in interviews (performed in accordance with guidelines of the National Institute of Mental Health and National Science Foundation) is too large to be a result of anything other than a genuine phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zablocki|first=Benjamin|title=Misunderstanding Cults: Searching for Objectivity in a Controversial Field|year=2001|publisher=U of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-8188-6|pages=194-201}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zablocki also reveals that of two most prestigious journals dedicated to the sociology of religion, the number of articles &quot;supporting the brainwashing perspective&quot; have been zero, while over one hundred such articles have been published in other journals &quot;marginal to the field&quot;.&lt;ref name= 'Zablocki1998'&gt;{{cite journal |title=TReply to Bromley |journal=Nova religio |date=1998-04 |first=Benjamin. |last=Zablocki |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=267-271}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From this fact, Zablocki concludes that the concept 'brainwashing' has been &quot;blacklisted&quot; unfairly from the field of sociology of religion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zablocki1998&quot;/&gt; Moreover, Zablocki claims that some prominent scholars who do not share his viewpoint have received &quot;lavish funding&quot; from NRMs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zablocki1997&quot;/&gt; [[Stephen A. Kent]] has also published several articles about brainwashing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nospank.net/kent.htm Brainwashing and Re-Indoctrination Programs in the Children of God/The Family&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Dr. Stephen A.

Invitation to the Sociology of Religion. Psychology Press, Jul 24, 2003 p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal issues, the APA and DIMPAC===
Since their inception, mind control theories have also been used in various legal proceedings against &quot;cult&quot; groups. In 1980, ex-Scientologist [[Lawrence Wollersheim]] successfully sued the [[Church of Scientology]] in a California court which decided in 1986 that church practices had been conducted in a psychologically coercive environment and so were not protected by religious freedom guarantees.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Others who have tried claiming a &quot;brainwashing defense&quot; for crimes committed while purportedly under mind control, including [[Patty Hearst]], [[Steven Fishman]] and [[Lee Boyd Malvo]], have not been successful.

In 1983, the [[American Psychological Association]] (APA) asked Margaret Singer to chair a [[taskforce]] called the [[APA Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Techniques of Persuasion and Control]] (DIMPAC) to investigate whether brainwashing or &quot;coercive persuasion&quot; did indeed play a role in recruitment by such movements. Before the taskforce had submitted its final report, the APA submitted on February 10, 1987 an ''[[amicus curiæ]]'' brief in an ongoing court case related to brainwashing.  Although the amicus curiæ brief written by the APA denies the credibility of the brainwashing theory, the APA submitted the brief under &quot;intense pressure by a consortium of pro-religion scholars (a.k.a. NRM scholars)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zablocki|first=Benjamin|title=Misunderstanding Cults: Searching for Objectivity in a Controversial Field|year=2001|publisher=U. of Torono Press|isbn=0-8020-8188-6|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The brief repudiated Singer's theories on &quot;coercive persuasion&quot; and suggested that brainwashing theories were without [[empirical]] proof.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/testi/molko_brief.htm CESNUR - APA Brief in the Molko Case. ''[t&amp;#93;he methodology of Drs. Singer and Benson has been repudiated by the scientific community [... the hypotheses advanced by Singer comprised&amp;#93; little more than uninformed speculation, based on skewed data [...&amp;#93; [t&amp;#93;he coercive persuasion theory ... is not a meaningful scientific concept. [...&amp;#93; The theories of Drs. Singer and Benson are not new to the scientific community. After searching scrutiny, the scientific community has repudiated the assumptions, methodologies, and conclusions of Drs. Singer and Benson. The validity of the claim that, absent physical force or threats, &quot;systematic manipulation of the social influences&quot; can coercively deprive individuals of free will lacks any empirical foundation and has never been confirmed by other research. The specific methods by which Drs. Singer and Benson have arrived at their conclusions have also been rejected by all serious scholars in the field.'']&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward the APA filed a motion to withdraw its signature from the brief, since Singer's final report had not been completed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rickross.com/reference/apologist/apologist25.html Motion of the American Psychological Association to Withdraw as Amicus Curiae&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, on May 11, 1987, the APA's Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) rejected the DIMPAC report because the report &quot;lacks the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur&quot;, and concluded that &quot;after much consideration, BSERP does not believe that we have sufficient information available to guide us in taking a position on this issue.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cesnur.org/testi/APA.htm |title=Memorandum |accessdate=2008-11-18 |author=American Psychological Association Board of Social and Ethical Responsibility for Psychology (BSERP) |date=1987-05-11 |work=CESNUR: APA Memo of 1987 with Enclosures |publisher=CESNUR Center for Studies on New Religion |quote=BSERP thanks the Task Force on Deceptive and Indirect Methods of Persuasion and Control for its service but is unable to accept the report of the Task Force. In general, the report lacks the scientific rigor and evenhanded critical approach necessary for APA imprimatur.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This leaves the APA's position on brainwashing as equivalent to: more research is needed until a definitive scientific verdict can be given.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zablocki|first=Benjamin|title=isunderstanding Cults: Searching for Objectivity in a Controversial Field|year=2001|publisher=U of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-8188-6|pages=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Two critical letters from external reviewers [[Benjamin Beit-Hallahmi]] and Jeffery D. Fisher accompanied the rejection memo. The letters criticized &quot;brainwashing&quot; as an unrecognized theoretical concept and Singer's reasoning as so flawed that it was &quot;almost ridiculous.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/testi/APA.htm APA memo and two enclosures]&lt;/ref&gt; After her findings were rejected, Singer sued the APA in 1992 for &quot;defamation, frauds, aiding and abetting and conspiracy&quot; and lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesnur.org/testi/singer.htm Case No. 730012-8] Margaret Singer v. American Psychological Association&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Zablocki]] and Alberto Amitrani interpreted the APA's response as meaning that there was no unanimous decision on the issue either way, suggesting also that Singer retained the respect of the psychological community after the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Amitrani |first=Alberto |coauthors=Di Marzio R |url=http://www.csj.org/infoserv_articles/amitrani_alberto_apaandmindcontrol.htm |title=Blind, or just don't want to see? Mind Control in New Religious Movements and the American Psychological Association |year=2001 |journal=Cultic Studies Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet her career as an expert witness ended at this time. She was meant to appear with [[Richard Ofshe]] in the 1990 U.S. v. Fishman Case, in which [[Steven Fishman]] claimed to have been under mind control by the Church of Scientology in order to defend himself against charges of embezzlement, but the courts disallowed her testimony. In the eyes of the court, &quot;neither the APA nor the [[American Sociology Association|ASA]] has endorsed the views of Dr. Singer and Dr. Ofshe on thought reform&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Brainwashed! Scholars of Cults Accuse Each Other of Bad Faith'', ''Lingua Franca'', December 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

After that time U.S. courts consistently rejected testimonies about mind control and manipulation, stating that such theories were not part of accepted mainline [[science]] according to the [[Frye Standard]] (Anthony &amp; Robbins 1992: 5-29) of 1923.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Other areas==
Mind control is a general term for a number of controversial theories proposing that an individual's thinking, behavior, emotions or decisions can, to a greater or lesser extent, be manipulated at will by outside sources. According to sociologist [[James T. Richardson]], some of the concepts of brainwashing have spread to other fields and are applied &quot;with some success&quot; in contexts unrelated to the earlier cult controversies, such as custody battles and [[child sexual abuse]] cases, &quot;where one parent is accused of brainwashing the child to reject the other parent, and in child sex abuse cases where one parent is accused of brainwashing the child to make sex abuse accusations against the other parent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Richardson, James T. ''Regulating Religion: Case Studies from Around the Globe'', Kluwer Academic/Plenum Publishers 2004, p. 16, ISBN 978-0-306-47887-1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Oldenburg&gt;Oldenburg, Don (2003-11-21).

[[Stephen A. Kent]] analyzes and summarizes the use of the brainwashing [[meme]] by non-sociologists in the period 2000-2007, finding the term useful not only in the context of &quot;New Religions/Cults&quot;, but equally under the headings of &quot;[[Boot camp (correctional)|Teen Behavior Modification Program]]s; [[terrorist group|Terrorist Group]]s; Dysfunctional [[corporate culture|Corporate Culture]]; Interpersonal [[Violence]]; and Alleged Chinese Governmental Human Rights Violations Against [[Falun Gong]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kent |first= Stephen A. |authorlink=Stephen A.

This article identifies those contexts by summarizing its appearance in court cases, discussions about cults and former cult members, terrorists, and alleged victims of state repression between the years 2000 and mid-2007. In creating this summary, we discover that a physiologist has examined the biochemical aspects of persons going through brainwashing processes, and that (to varying degrees) some judges and others related to the judiciary have realized that people who have been through these processes have impaired judgment and often need special counseling. Most dramatically, a new brainwashing program may be operating in Communist China, a country whose political activities toward its own citizens in the late 1940s and 1950s spawned so much of the initial brainwashing research.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
