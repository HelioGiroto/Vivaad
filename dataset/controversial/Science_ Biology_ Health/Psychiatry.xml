[[File:American Lady Against The Sky.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The word ''[[wiktionary:psyche|psyche]]'' comes from the [[ancient Greek]] for [[soul]] or [[butterfly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insects.org/ced4/etymology.html Etymology of Butterfly]&lt;/ref&gt; The fluttering insect appears in the [[coat of arms]] of Britain's [[Royal College of Psychiatrists]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=James|first=F.E.|year=1991|title=Psyche|journal=Psychiatric Bulletin|volume=15|pages=429–431|url=http://pb.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/15/7/429.pdf|accessdate=2008-08-04|doi=10.1192/pb.15.7.429|isbn=0-88163-257-0|publisher=Analytic Press|location=Hillsdale, NJ|issue=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

'''Psychiatry''' is the [[Medicine|medical]] [[Specialty (medicine)|specialty]] devoted to the [[Biomedical research|study]] and [[Treatment of mental disorders|treatment]] of [[mental disorders]]. These mental disorders include various [[Affect (psychology)|affective]], [[behaviour]]al, [[Cognition|cognitive]] and [[Perception|perceptual]] [[Abnormality (behavior)|abnormalities]]. The term was first coined by the German [[physician]] [[Johann Christian Reil]] in 1808, and literally means the 'medical treatment of the soul' (''[[Wikt:psych|psych-]]'': soul; from [[Ancient Greek]] ''psykhē'': soul; ''[[Wikt:-iatry|-iatry]]'': medical treatment; from Gk. ''iātrikos'': medical, ''iāsthai'': to heal). A medical doctor specializing in psychiatry is a [[psychiatrist]].

&lt;!--The following paragraph, while clearly &quot;in the ballpark&quot; topically, seems nonetheless to &quot;come out of left field&quot; contextually; the diathesis-stress concept obviously is integral to psychiatry, but in its current incarnation it makes for a rather &quot;ambitious&quot; transition between a basic definition of psychiatry (1st paragraph) and a first glance at psychiatry in action (3rd paragraph): &quot;Mental disorders are currently conceptualized as disorders of brain circuits likely caused by developmental processes shaped by a complex interplay of genetics and experience.&lt;ref name=Insel&gt;{{cite journal | author = Insel T.R., Wang P.S. | year = 2010 | title = Rethinking mental illness | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 303 | issue = 19| pages = 1970–1971 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2010.555 | pmid = 20483974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the genetics of mental illness may really be the genetics of brain development, with different outcomes possible, depending on the biological and environmental context.&lt;ref name=&quot;Insel&quot;/&gt;&quot;
--&gt;
Psychiatric assessment typically starts with a [[mental status examination]] and the compilation of a [[Medical history|case history]]. [[Psychological testing|Psychological tests]] and physical examinations may be conducted, including on occasion the use of [[neuroimaging]] or other [[Neurophysiology|neurophysiological]] techniques. Mental disorders are diagnosed in accordance with criteria listed in diagnostic manuals such as the widely used ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' (DSM), published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]], and the ''[[International Classification of Diseases]]'' (ICD), edited and used by the [[World Health Organization]]. The fifth edition of the DSM ([[DSM-5]]) is scheduled to be published in 2013, and its development is expected to be of significant interest to many medical fields.&lt;ref name=Kupfer&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kupfer D.J., Regier D.A. | year = 2010 | title = Why all of medicine should care about DSM-5 | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 303 | issue = 19| pages = 1974–1975 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2010.646 | pmid = 20483976 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatric treatment applies a variety of modalities, including [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]] [[Pharmaceutical drug|medication]], [[psychotherapy]] and a wide range of other techniques such as [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]]. Treatment may be delivered on an [[inpatient]] or [[outpatient]] basis, depending on the severity of functional impairment or on other aspects of the disorder in question. Research and treatment within psychiatry as a whole are conducted on an interdisciplinary basis, sourcing an array of sub-specialties and theoretical approaches.

==History==
===Ancient===
Although one may trace its germination to the late eighteenth century, the beginning of psychiatry as a medical specialty is dated to the middle of the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=Shorter1&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in the 5th century BCE, mental disorders, especially those with [[psychosis|psychotic]] traits, were considered [[supernatural]] in origin.&lt;ref name=Elkes13&gt;Elkes, A. &amp; Thorpe, J.G. (1967). ''A Summary of Psychiatry''. London: Faber &amp; Faber, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; This view existed throughout [[ancient Greece]] and [[ancient Rome|Rome]].&lt;ref name=Elkes13/&gt; Early manuals  about mental disorders were created by the Greeks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shorter1&quot; /&gt; In the 4th century BCE, [[Hippocrates]] theorized that physiological abnormalities may be the root of mental disorders.&lt;ref name=Elkes13/&gt;&lt;ref name=Elkes13/&gt; Religious leaders often turned to versions of [[exorcism]] to treat mental disorders  often utilizing cruel and barbaric methods.&lt;ref name=Elkes13/&gt;

===Middle Ages===
{{Main|Islamic psychology}}

[[psychiatric hospital|Specialist hospitals]] were built in [[Baghdad]] in 705 AD, followed by [[Fes]] in the early 8th century, and [[Cairo]] in 800 AD.{{fact|date=May 2012}} 

Physicians who wrote on mental disorders and their treatment in the Medieval Islamic period included  [[Muhammad ibn Zakarīya Rāzi]] (Rhazes), the [[Arab]] physician Najab ud-din Muhammad{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}, and Abu Ali al-Hussain ibn Abdallah ibn Sina, known in the West as [[Avicenna]].&lt;ref&gt;Mohamed Reza Namazi (2001), &quot;Avicenna, 980-1037&quot;, ''American Journal of Psychiatry'' '''158''' (11), p. 1796; Mohammadali M. Shoja, R. Shane Tubbs (2007), [http://ajp.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/reprint/164/2/228 &quot;The Disorder of Love in the Canon of Avicenna (A.D. 980–1037)&quot;], ''American Journal of Psychiatry'' '''164''' (2), pp 228-229;S Safavi-Abbasi, LBC Brasiliense, RK Workman (2007), &quot;The fate of medical knowledge and the neurosciences during the time of Genghis Khan and the Mongolian Empire&quot;, ''Neurosurgical Focus'' '''23''' (1), E13, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Specialist hospitals were built in [[Middle Ages|medieval Europe]] from the 13th century to treat mental disorders but were utilized only as custodial institutions and did not provide any type of treatment.&lt;ref name=Shorter4&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in the 13th century, [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]] in [[London]] is one of the oldest lunatic asylums.&lt;ref name=Shorter4/&gt; By 1547 the City of London acquired the hospital and continued its function until 1948.&lt;ref name=Shorter5&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; It is now part of the National Health Service and is an [[NHS Foundation Trust]].
[[File:Philippe Pinel.jpg|thumb|Many consider [[Philippe Pinel]] to be the father of modern psychiatry.]]

===Early modern period===
In 1656, [[Louis XIV of France]] created a public system of hospitals for those suffering from mental disorders, but as in England, no real treatment was applied.&lt;ref name= Shorter5/&gt; In 1713 the Bethel Hospital Norwich was opened, the first purpose-built asylum in England, founded by Mary Chapman [http://www.heritagecity.org/research-centre/social-innovation/the-bethel-hospital.htm/] . In 1758 English physician [[William Battie]] wrote his ''[[Treatise on Madness]]'' which called for treatments to be utilized in asylums.&lt;ref name=Shorter9&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty years later, then ruling monarch in England [[George III of the United Kingdom|George III]] was known to be suffering from a mental disorder.&lt;ref name= Elkes13/&gt; Following the King's [[remission (medicine)|remission]] in 1789, mental illness came to be seen as something which could be treated and cured.&lt;ref name=Elkes13/&gt; The French doctor [[Philippe Pinel]] introduced [[moral treatment|humane treatment]] approaches to those suffering from mental disorders.&lt;ref name=Elkes13/&gt; As a result of his work, the Governor of the Bicêtre [[psychiatric hospital]] in Paris released psychiatric patients from their chains in 1793, beginning what has been called the ''bright epoch of psychiatry''.&lt;ref name=&quot;bukelic&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Bukelic |first=Jovan|title=Neuropsihijatrija za III razred medicinske skole|editor=Mirjana Jovanovic|publisher=Zavod za udzbenike i nastavna sredstva|location=Belgrade |date=1995|edition=7th|pages=7|chapter=2|isbn=86-17-03418-1|accessdate=27 July 2011|language=Serbian}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the York Retreat, a Quaker-run asylum in England which opened in 1796, a form of [[moral treatment]] evolved independently from Pinel under the lay stewardship of the tea and coffee merchant [[William Tuke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cherry&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Cherry|first=Charles L.|title=A Quiet Haven: Quakers, Moral Treatment, and Asylum Reform|location=London &amp; Toronto|publisher=Associated University Presses|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|84-85|}} &lt;ref name=&quot;Digby&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Digby|first=Anne|title=Madness, Morality and Medicine: A Study of the York Retreat|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|30}} &lt;ref name=&quot;Glover&quot;&gt;{{citation|last=Glover|first=Mary R.|title=The Retreat, York: An Early Experiment in the Treatment of Mental Illness|location=York|publisher=Ebor Press|date=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}} Tuke's Retreat became a model throughout the world for humane and moral treatment of patients suffering from mental disorders.&lt;ref name=Borthwick&gt;{{cite journal | author = Borthwick A., Holman C., Kennard D., McFetridge M., Messruther K., Wilkes J. | year = 2001 | title = The relevance of moral treatment to contemporary mental health care | url = | journal = Journal of Mental Health | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 427–439 | doi=10.1080/09638230124277}}&lt;/ref&gt; The York Retreat inspired similar institutions in the United States, most notably the [[Brattleboro Retreat]] and the Hartford Retreat (now the [[Institute of Living]]).

===19th century===
At the turn of the century, England and France combined had only a few hundred individuals in asylums.&lt;ref name=Shorter34&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1890s and early 1900s, this number had risen to the hundreds of thousands.&lt;ref name=Shorter34/&gt; The United States housed 150,000 patients in mental hospitals by 1904.&lt;ref name=Shorter34/&gt; [[German language|German speaking]] countries housed more than 400 public and private sector asylums.&lt;ref name=Shorter34/&gt; These asylums were critical to the evolution of psychiatry as they provided places of practice throughout the world.&lt;ref name=Shorter34/&gt;

On continental Europe, universities often played a part in the administration of the asylums&lt;ref name=Shorter35&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 35&lt;/ref&gt; and, because of the relationship between the universities and asylums, scores of psychiatrists were being educated in Germany.&lt;ref name=Shorter35/&gt;. However, because of Germany's individual states and the lack of national regulation of asylums, the country had no organized centralization of asylums or psychiatry.&lt;ref name=Shorter34/&gt; The United Kingdom, unlike Germany, possessed a national body for asylum superintendents - the ''Medico-Psychological Association'' - established in 1866 under the Presidency of [[William A.F. Browne]].&lt;ref name=Shorter41&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States in 1834 [[Anna Marsh]], a physician's widow, deeded the funds to build her country's first financially stable private asylum. The [[Brattleboro Retreat]] marked the beginning of America's private psychiatric hospitals challenging state institutions for patients, funding, and influence. Although based on [[England]]'s [[York Retreat]], it would be followed by specialty institutions of every treatment philosophy.

In 1838, France enacted a law to regulate both the admissions into asylums and asylum services across the country. This was the year in which [[William A.F. Browne]] achieved his appointment as Superintendent of the [[The Crichton#Crichton Royal Hospital|Crichton Royal]] at [[Dumfries]] in southern Scotland.
[[File:Emil Kraepelin2.gif|thumb|right|[[Emil Kraepelin]] studied and promoted ideas of disease classification for mental disorders.]]

However, the new idea that mental illness could be ameliorated during the mid-nineteenth century were disappointed.&lt;ref name=Shorter46&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrists were pressured by an ever increasing patient population.&lt;ref name=Shorter46/&gt; The average number of patients in asylums in the United States jumped 927%.&lt;ref name= Shorter46/&gt; Numbers were similar in England and Germany.&lt;ref name=Shorter46/&gt; Overcrowding was rampant in France where asylums would commonly take in double their maximum capacity.&lt;ref name=Shorter47&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Increases in asylum populations may have been a result of the transfer of care from families and [[poorhouse]]s, but the specific reasons as to why the increase occurred is still debated today.&lt;ref name=Shorter48&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shorter49&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; No matter the cause, the pressure on asylums from the increase was taking its toll on the asylums and psychiatry as a specialty. Asylums were once again turning into custodial institutions&lt;ref name=Rothman&gt;Rothman, D.J. (1990). ''The Discovery of the Asylum: Social Order and Disorder in the New Republic''. Boston: Little Brown, p. 239. ISBN 978-0-316-75745-4&lt;/ref&gt; and the reputation of psychiatry in the medical world had hit an extreme low.&lt;ref name=Shorter65&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
====Disease classification and rebirth of biological psychiatry====
The 20th century introduced a new psychiatry into the world. Different perspectives of looking at mental disorders began to be introduced. The career of [[Emil Kraepelin]] reflects the convergence of different disciplines in psychiatry.&lt;ref name=Shorter101&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; Kraepelin initially was very attracted to psychology and ignored the ideas of anatomical psychiatry.&lt;ref name=Shorter101/&gt; Following his appointment to a professorship of psychiatry and his work in a university psychiatric clinic, Kraepelin's interest in pure psychology began to fade and he introduced a plan for a more comprehensive psychiatry.&lt;ref name=Shorter102&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shorter103&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; Kraepelin began to study and promote the ideas of disease classification for mental disorders, an idea introduced by [[Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum]].&lt;ref name= Shorter103/&gt; The initial ideas behind biological psychiatry, stating that the different mental disorders were all biological in nature, evolved into a new concept of &quot;nerves&quot; and psychiatry became a rough approximation of neurology and neuropsychiatry.&lt;ref name=Shorter114&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 114&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kraepelin was criticized for considering [[schizophrenia]] as a [[biological]] [[illness]] in the absence of any detectable histologic or anatomic abnormalities.&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Bruce|title=Theory and practice of psychiatry|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-514937-8|page=221|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=H8ZrAAAAMAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|221}} While Kraepelin tried to find organic causes of mental illness, he adopted many theses of [[Positivism|positivist]] [[medicine]], but he favoured the precision of [[Nosology|nosological]] classification over the indefiniteness of [[Etiology|etiological]] causation as his basic mode of psychiatric explanation.&lt;ref name=Thiher&gt;{{cite book|last=Thiher|first=Allen|title=Revels in Madness: Insanity in Medicine and Literature|year=2005|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-08999-4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=G_Ww-9iiKe0C&amp;pg=PT137&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following [[Sigmund Freud]]'s death, ideas stemming from [[psychoanalytic theory]] also began to take root.&lt;ref name=Shorter145&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; The psychoanalytic theory became popular among psychiatrists because it allowed the patients to be treated in private practices instead of warehoused in asylums.&lt;ref name=Shorter145/&gt; By the 1970s the psychoanalytic school of thought had become marginalized within the field.&lt;ref name=Shorter145/&gt;
[[File:Acetylcholine.svg|right|thumb|[[Otto Loewi]]'s work led to the identification of the first neurotransmitter, [[acetylcholine]].]]

Biological psychiatry reemerged during this time. [[Psychopharmacology]] became an integral part of psychiatry starting with [[Otto Loewi]]'s discovery of the neuromodulatory properties of [[acetylcholine]]; thus identifying it as the first-known neurotransmitter.&lt;ref name=Shorter246/&gt; [[Neuroimaging]] was first utilized as a tool for psychiatry in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=Shorter270&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of [[chlorpromazine]]'s effectiveness in treating [[schizophrenia]] in 1952 revolutionized treatment of the disease,&lt;ref name=&quot;Turner2007&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Turner T. |title= Unlocking psychosis |journal=Brit J Med |year=2007 |volume=334 |issue=suppl |pages=s7 |doi=10.1136/bmj.39034.609074.94 |pmid=17204765}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[lithium carbonate]]'s ability to stabilize mood highs and lows in [[bipolar disorder]] in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Cade JFJ | year = | title = Lithium salts in the treatment of psychotic excitement | url = | journal = Med J Aust | volume = 1949 | issue = 36| pages = 349–352 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychotherapy was still utilized, but as a treatment for psychosocial issues.&lt;ref name=Shorter239&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 239&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1920s and 1930s, most asylum and academic psychiatrists in Europe believed that manic depressive disorder and schizophrenia were inherited, but in the decades after World War II, the conflation of genetics with [[Nazi racism|Nazi racist ideology]] thoroughly discredited genetics.&lt;ref name=Eisenberg&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisenberg|first1=Leon|authorlink=Leon Eisenberg|last2=Guttmacher|first2=Laurence|title=Were we all asleep at the switch?

(1997), p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular biology opened the door for specific genes contributing to mental disorders to be identified.&lt;ref name= Shorter246/&gt;

====Transinstitutionalization and the aftermath====
In 1963, [[President of the United States|US president]] [[John F. Kennedy]] introduced legislation delegating the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] to administer Community Mental Health Centers for those being discharged from state psychiatric hospitals.&lt;ref name=Shorter280&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 280&lt;/ref&gt; Later, though, the Community Mental Health Center's focus was diverted to provide psychotherapy sessions for those suffering from acute but mild mental disorders.&lt;ref name=Shorter280/&gt; Ultimately there were no arrangements made for actively and severely mentally ill patients who were being discharged from hospitals.&lt;ref name=Shorter280/&gt; Some of those suffering from mental disorders drifted into homelessness or ended up in prisons and jails.&lt;ref name=Shorter280/&gt;&lt;ref name=Slovenko&gt;{{cite journal | author = Slovenko R | year = 2003 | title = The transinstitutionalization of the mentally ill | url = | journal = Ohio University Law Review | volume = 29 | issue = | page = 641 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies found that 33% of the homeless population and 14% of inmates in prisons and jails were already diagnosed with a mental illness.&lt;ref name=Shorter280 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Torrey&gt;Torrey, E.F. (1988). ''Nowhere to Go: The Tragic Odyssey of the Homeless Mentally Ill''. New York: Harper and Row, pp.25-29, 126-128. ISBN 978-0-06-015993-1&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, psychologist [[David Rosenhan]] published the [[Rosenhan experiment]], a study with results that led to questions about the validity of psychiatric diagnoses.&lt;ref name=Rosenhan&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rosenhan D | year = 1973 | title = On being sane in insane places | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/179/4070/250 | journal = Science | volume = 179 | issue = 4070| pages = 250–258 | doi = 10.1126/science.179.4070.250 | pmid = 4683124 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics such as [[Robert Spitzer (psychiatrist)|Robert Spitzer]] placed doubt on the validity and credibility of the study, but did concede that the consistency of psychiatric diagnoses needed improvement.&lt;ref name=Spitzer2005&gt;{{cite journal | author = Spitzer R.L., Lilienfeld S.O., Miller M.B. | year = 2005 | title = Rosenhan revisited: The scientific credibility of Lauren Slater's pseudopatient diagnosis study | url = | journal = Journal of Nervous and Mental Disease | volume = 193 | issue = 11| pages = 734–739 | pmid = 16260927 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatry, like most medical specialties has a continuing, significant need for research into its diseases, classifications and treatments.&lt;ref name=Lyness16&gt;Lyness, J.M. (1997). ''Psychiatric Pearls''. Philadelphia: F.A. Davis Company. ISBN 978-0-8036-0280-9{{Full|date=January 2010}}&lt;!--page no. needed--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatry adopts biology's fundamental belief that disease and health are different elements of an individual's adaptation to an environment.&lt;ref name=Guze130&gt;Guze, S. B. (1992), p. 130&lt;/ref&gt; But psychiatry also recognizes that the environment of the human species is complex and includes physical, cultural, and interpersonal elements.&lt;ref name=Guze130/&gt; In addition to external factors, the [[human brain]] must contain and organize an individual's hopes, fears, desires, fantasies and feelings.&lt;ref name=Guze130/&gt; Psychiatry's difficult task is to bridge the understanding of these factors so that they can be studied both clinically and physiologically.&lt;ref name=Guze130/&gt;

==Theory and focus==
&lt;blockquote class=&quot;toccolours&quot; style=&quot;text-align:left; width:30%; float:right; padding:10px 15px; display:table;&quot;&gt;&quot;Psychiatry, more than any other branch of medicine, forces its practitioners to wrestle with the nature of evidence, the validity of introspection, problems in communication, and other long-standing philosophical issues&quot; &lt;small&gt;([[Psychiatry#cite note-Guze4-5|Guze, 1992, p.4]]).&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The term psychiatry (Greek &quot;ψυχιατρική&quot;, ''psychiatrikē''), coined by [[Johann Christian Reil]] in 1808, comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] &quot;ψυχή&quot; (''psychē'': &quot;soul or mind&quot;) and &quot;ιατρός&quot; (''iatros'': &quot;healer&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manchester.edu/kant/Bio/FullBio/ReilJC.html Johann Christian Reil, ''Dictionary of Eighteenth Century German Philosophers'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/abstract/193/1/1 ''British Journal of Psychiatry'', ''Psychiatry’s 200th birthday'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.find-health-articles.com/rec_pub_18091285-the-seminal-contributions-johann-christian-reil-anatomy-physiology.htm ''Seminal contributions of Johann Christian Reil'']&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to a field of medicine focused specifically on the mind, aiming to [[biomedical research|study]], [[prevention (medical)|prevent]], and [[treatment of mental disorders|treat]] [[mental disorder]]s in [[human]]s.&lt;ref name=Guze4&gt;Guze, S.B. (1992), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Storrow1&gt;Storrow, H.A. (1969). ''Outline of Clinical Psychiatry''. New York:Appleton-Century-Crofts, p 1. ISBN 978-0-390-85075-1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lyness3&gt;Lyness, J.M. (1997), p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as an intermediary between the world from a social context and the world from the perspective of those who are mentally ill.&lt;ref name=Gask7&gt;Gask, L. (2004), p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who specialize in psychiatry are different than most other [[mental health professional]]s and [[physician]]s in that they must be familiar with both the [[social sciences|social]] and [[biology|biological sciences]].&lt;ref name=Storrow1/&gt; The discipline is interested in the operations of different organs and body systems as classified by the patient's subjective experiences and the objective physiology of the patient.&lt;ref name=Guze131&gt;Guze, S. B. (1992), p 131&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatry exists to treat mental disorders which are conventionally divided into three very general categories: [[mental illness]], severe learning disability, and [[personality disorder]].&lt;ref name=Gask113&gt;Gask, L. (2004), p. 113&lt;/ref&gt; While the focus of psychiatry has changed little throughout time, the diagnostic and treatment processes have evolved dramatically and continue to do so. Since the late 20th century, the field of psychiatry has continued to become more biological and less conceptually isolated from the field of medicine.&lt;ref name=Gask128&gt;Gask, L. (2004), p. 128&lt;/ref&gt;

While the medical specialty of psychiatry utilizes research in the field of [[neuroscience]], [[psychology]], [[medicine]], [[biology]], [[biochemistry]], and [[pharmacology]],&lt;ref name=Pietrini&gt;{{cite journal | author = Pietrini P | year = 2003 | title = Toward a Biochemistry of Mind? | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 160 | issue = 11| pages = 1907–1908 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.160.11.1907 | pmid = 14594732 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it has generally been considered a middle ground between [[neurology]] and psychology.&lt;ref name=Shorter326&gt;Shorter, E.

===Ethics===
Like other purveyors of [[professional ethics]], the [[World Psychiatric Association]] issues an [[ethical code]] to govern the conduct of psychiatrists. The psychiatric code of ethics, first set forth through the Declaration of [[Hawaii]] in 1977, has been expanded through a 1983 Vienna update and, in 1996, the broader Madrid Declaration. The code was further revised in Hamburg, 1999. The World Psychiatric Association code covers such matters as patient assessment, up-to-date knowledge, the human dignity of incapacitated patients, [[confidentiality]], research ethics, sex selection, [[euthanasia]],&lt;ref name=Lopez&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.pnpbp.2006.12.007 |title=Progress in Neuro-Psychopharmacology and Biological Psychiatry: Psychiatry and political–institutional abuse from the historical perspective: The ethical lessons of the Nuremberg Trial on their 60th anniversary |date= 2006-12-07 |author=López-Muñoza, Francisco |others=Cecilio Alamoa, Michael Dudleyb, Gabriel Rubioc, Pilar García-Garcíaa, Juan D.

===Subspecialties===
Various subspecialties and/or theoretical approaches exist which are related to the field of psychiatry. They include the following:
*[[Addiction psychiatry]]; focuses on evaluation and treatment of individuals with alcohol, drug, or other substance-related disorders, and of individuals with dual diagnosis of substance-related and other psychiatric disorders.
*[[Biological psychiatry]]; an approach to psychiatry that aims to understand mental disorders in terms of the biological function of the nervous system.
*[[Child and adolescent psychiatry]]; the branch of psychiatry that specialises in work with children, teenagers, and their families.
*[[Community psychiatry]]; an approach that reflects an inclusive [[public health]] perspective and is practiced in [[community mental health services]].&lt;ref&gt;American Association of Community Psychiatrists [http://www.comm.psych.pitt.edu/mission.html About AACP] Retrieved on Aug-05-2008&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Cross-cultural psychiatry]]; a branch of psychiatry concerned with the cultural and ethnic context of mental disorder and psychiatric services.
*[[Emergency psychiatry]]; the clinical application of psychiatry in emergency settings.
*[[Forensic psychiatry]]; the interface between law and psychiatry.
*[[Geriatric psychiatry]]; a branch of psychiatry dealing with the study, prevention, and treatment of mental disorders in humans with old age.
&lt;!--&quot;Global mental health&quot; sounds like the exact opposite of &quot;psychiatric subspecialty&quot;. The content is sourced and seems perfectly suitable for inclusion in this article, but why here in this list?: *[[Global Mental Health]]; the area of study, research and practice that places a priority on improving mental health and achieving equity in mental health for all people worldwide.&lt;ref name=Patel&gt;{{cite journal | author = Patel V., Prince M. | year = 2010 | title = Global mental health - a new global health field comes of age | url = | journal = JAMA | volume = 303 | issue = 19| pages = 1976–1977 | doi = 10.1001/jama.2010.616 | pmid = 20483977 }}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;
*[[Liaison psychiatry]]; the branch of psychiatry that specializes in the interface between other medical specialties and psychiatry.
*[[Military psychiatry]]; covers special aspects of psychiatry and mental disorders within the military context.
*[[Neuropsychiatry]]; branch of medicine dealing with mental disorders attributable to diseases of the nervous system.
*[[Social psychiatry]]; a branch of psychiatry that focuses on the interpersonal and cultural context of mental disorder and mental wellbeing.

In the United States, psychiatry is one of the specialties which qualify for further education and board-certification in [[pain medicine]], [[palliative medicine]], and [[sleep medicine]].

===Approaches===
Psychiatric illnesses can be conceptualised in a number of different ways. The [[biomedical model|biomedical]] approach examines signs and symptoms and compares them with diagnostic criteria. Mental illness can be assessed, conversely, through a narrative which tries to incorporate symptoms into a meaningful life history and to frame them as responses to external conditions. Both approaches are important in the field of psychiatry,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Verhulst J, Tucker G |title=Medical and narrative approaches in psychiatry |journal=Psychiatr Serv |volume=46 |issue=5 |pages=513–514 |year=1995 |month=May |pmid=7627683 |url=http://ps.psychiatryonline.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7627683}}&lt;/ref&gt; but have not sufficiently reconciled to settle [[biopsychiatry controversy|controversy]] over either the selection of a psychiatric [[paradigm]] or the specification of [[psychopathology]]. The notion of a &quot;[[biopsychosocial model]]&quot; is often used to underline the multifactorial nature of clinical impairment.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLaren N 1998 86–92; discussion 93–6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McLaren_madness&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Humanizing Madness| last = McLaren |first = Niall |year = 2007 |isbn = 1-932690-39-5 |pages = |publisher = Loving Healing Press |location = Ann Arbor, MI}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McLaren_psychiatry&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|title = Humanizing Psychiatry |last = McLaren |first = Niall |year = 2009 |isbn = 1-61599-011-9|pages = |publisher = Loving Healing Press |location = Ann Arbor, MI}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, a [[Niall McLaren#Humanizing Psychiatry|&quot;biocognitive model&quot;]] acknowledges the physiological basis for the mind's existence, but identifies [[cognition]] as an [[Antireductionism|irreducible]] and independent realm in which disorder may occur.&lt;ref name=&quot;McLaren N 1998 86–92; discussion 93–6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;McLaren_madness&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McLaren_psychiatry&quot;/&gt; The biocognitive approach includes a [[Mentalism (philosophy)|mentalist]] [[etiology]] and provides a [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] revision of the biopsychosocial view, reflecting the efforts of psychiatrist [[Niall McLaren]] to bring the discipline into scientific maturity in accordance with the paradigmatic standards of [[Philosophy of science|philosopher]] [[Thomas Kuhn]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McLaren N 1998 86–92; discussion 93–6&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=McLaren N |title=A critical review of the biopsychosocial model |journal=The Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=86–92; discussion 93–6|year=1998|month=February|pmid=9565189|doi=10.1046/j.1440-1614.1998.00343.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;McLaren_madness&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;McLaren_psychiatry&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Ventral midbrain.png|thumb|[[Functional magnetic resonance imaging|fMRI]] images such as these may assist in a diagnosis by ruling out other conditions.]]
[[Psychiatric assessment|Psychiatric diagnoses]] take place in a wide variety of settings and are performed by many different [[health care provider|health professional]]s. Therefore, the diagnostic procedure may vary greatly based upon these factors. Typically, though, a psychiatric diagnosis utilizes a [[differential diagnosis]] procedure where a [[mental status examination]] and physical examination is conducted, [[pathological]], [[psychopathological]] or [[psychosocial]] histories obtained, and sometimes [[neuroimaging|neuroimages]] or other [[neurophysiological]] measurements are taken, or [[personality test]]s or [[cognitive test]]s administered.&lt;ref name=Meyendorf&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meyendorf R | year = 1980 | title = Diagnosis and differential diagnosis in psychiatry and the question of situation referred prognostic diagnosis | url = | journal = Schweizer Archiv Neurol Neurochir Psychiatry für Neurologie, Neurochirurgie et de psychiatrie | volume = 126 | issue = | pages = 121–134 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Leigh15&gt;Leigh, H.

=====Diagnostic manuals=====
{{See also|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders}}
Three main diagnostic manuals used to classify mental health conditions are in use today. The [[ICD-10]] is produced and published by the [[World Health Organisation]], includes a section on psychiatric conditions, and is used worldwide.&lt;ref name=ICD10&gt;World Health Organisation. (1992). ''The ICD-10 Classification of Mental and Behavioural Disorders: Clinical Descriptions and Diagnostic Guidelines''. Geneva: World Health Organisation. ISBN 978-92-4-154422-1&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], produced and published by the [[American Psychiatric Association]], is primarily focused on mental health conditions and is the main classification tool in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=DSM &gt;American Psychiatric Association. (2000). ''Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders'' (4th Edition). Washington D.C.: American Psychiatric Publishing, Inc. ISBN 978-0-89042-025-6&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently in its fourth revised edition and is also used worldwide.&lt;ref name=DSM/&gt; The [[Chinese Society of Psychiatry]] has also produced a diagnostic manual, the [[Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders]].&lt;ref name=Chen&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chen Y.F. | year = 2002 | title = Chinese classification of mental disorders (CCMD-3)  towards integration in international classification | url = | journal = Psychopathology | volume = 35 | issue = 2–3| pages = 171–175 | doi = 10.1159/000065140 | pmid = 12145505 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stated intention of diagnostic manuals is typically to develop replicable and clinically useful categories and criteria, to facilitate consensus and agreed upon standards, whilst being atheoretical as regards etiology.&lt;ref name=DSM/&gt;&lt;ref name=Essen&gt;{{cite journal | author = Essen-Moller E | year = 1971 | title = On classification of mental disorders | url = | journal = [[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] | volume = 37 | issue = | pages = 119–126 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the categories are nevertheless based on particular psychiatric theories and data; they are broad and often specified by numerous possible combinations of symptoms, and many of the categories overlap in symptomology or typically occur together.&lt;ref name=Mezzich&gt;{{cite journal | author = Mezzich J.E. | year = 1979 | title = Patterns and issues in multiaxial psychiatric diagnosis | url = | journal = Psychological Medicine | volume = 9 | issue = 1| pages = 125–137 | doi = 10.1017/S0033291700021632 | pmid = 370861 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While originally intended only as a guide for experienced clinicians trained in its use, the nomenclature is now widely used by clinicians, administrators and insurance companies in many countries.&lt;ref name=Guze2&gt;{{cite journal | author = Guze S.B. | year = 1970 | title = The need for toughmindedness in psychiatric thinking | url = | journal = Southern Medical Journal | volume = 63 | issue = 6| pages = 662–671 | doi = 10.1097/00007611-197006000-00012 | pmid = 5446229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSM has attracted praise for standardizing psychiatric diagnostic categories and criteria. It has also attracted controversy and criticism. Some critics argue that the DSM represents an [[unscientific]] system that enshrines the opinions of a few powerful psychiatrists. There are ongoing issues concerning the [[Validity (statistics)|validity]] and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]] of the diagnostic categories; the reliance on superficial [[symptoms]]; the use of artificial dividing lines between categories and from '[[normality]]'; possible [[cultural]] bias; [[medicalization]] of human distress and financial [[conflicts of interest]], including with the practice of psychiatrists and with the [[pharmaceutical industry]]; political controversies about the inclusion or exclusion of diagnoses from the manual, in general or in regard to specific issues; and the experience of those who are most directly affected by the manual by being diagnosed, including the [[consumer/survivor movement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;concept&amp;evolution&quot;&gt;Dalal PK, Sivakumar T.

=====General considerations=====
Individuals with mental health conditions are commonly referred to as ''[[patient]]s'' but may also be called ''[[customer|client]]s'', ''[[consumer]]s'', or ''service recipients''. They may come under the care of a psychiatric physician or other psychiatric practitioners by various paths, the two most common being self-[[Wikt:referral|referral]] or referral by a primary-care physician. Alternatively, a person may be referred by hospital medical staff, by [[court order]], [[involuntary commitment]], or, in the UK and Australia, by [[sectioning]] under a [[mental health law]].
[[File:NIMH Clinical Center.JPG|right|thumb|A psychiatric patient room in the United States.]]

Persons who undergo a [[psychiatric assessment]] are evaluated by a [[psychiatrist]] for their mental and physical condition. This usually involves interviewing the person and often obtaining information from other sources such as other health and social care professionals, relatives, associates, law enforcement personnel, emergency medical personnel, and [[psychiatric rating scales]]. A [[mental status examination]] is carried out, and a [[physical examination]] is usually performed to establish or exclude other illnesses that may be contributing to the alleged psychiatric problems.  A physical examination may also serve to identify any signs of [[self-harm]]; this examination is often performed by someone other than the psychiatrist, especially if [[blood test]]s and [[medical imaging]] are performed.

Like most medications, psychiatric medications can cause [[adverse effect (medicine)|adverse effects]] in patients, and some require ongoing [[therapeutic drug monitoring]], for instance [[full blood count]]s or, for patients taking [[lithium salt]]s, [[blood plasma|serum]] levels of [[lithium]], renal function, and thyroid function. [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) is sometimes administered for serious and disabling conditions, such as those unresponsive to medication. The efficacy&lt;ref&gt;Moncrieff et al. (2003).

The close relationship between those prescribing psychiatric medication and pharmaceutical companies is a source of concern for some, particularly anti-psychiatry advocates.&lt;ref&gt;Loren R. Mosher, Richard Gosden and Sharon Beder, 'Drug companies and Schizophrenia: Unbridled Capitalism meets Madness', in [http://www.herinst.org/sbeder/corppower/drugcompanies.html Models of Madness: Psychological, Social and Biological Approaches to Schizophrenia] edited by John Read, Loren Mosher and Richard Bentall, Brunner-Routledge, New York, 2004, pp. 115-130.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, such advocates are prone to questioning the influence which pharmaceutical companies are exerting on mental health policies.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gosden and Sharon Beder, [http://www.herinst.org/sbeder/corppower/pharm-agenda.html 'Pharmaceutical Industry Agenda Setting in Mental Health Policies'], Ethical Human Sciences and Services 3(3) Fall/Winter 2001, pp. 147-159&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Ginsberg.

For many years, controversy has surrounded the forced drugging and the &quot;lack of insight&quot; label of patients with severe psychiatric symptoms who resist treatment. Involuntary treatment is extremely rare outside the psychiatric system, allowable only in such cases as unconsciousness or the inability to communicate. People with psychiatric disabilities, on the other hand, may be forced to accept treatment even when vigorously protested against by the patient.  Frequently those who resist treatment and are forced into it are labeled as having a &quot;lack insight&quot; into the seriousness of their problems and the treatment that their symptoms require.  Thus, anti-psychiatry advocates conclude that &quot;lack of insight&quot; is often synonymous with being disagreeable toward the treating professional, and that people who disagree are labeled as noncompliant or uncooperative with necessary treatment.&lt;ref&gt;Rae E. Unzicker, Kate P. Wolters, Debra Robinson et al. [http://www.ncd.gov/newsroom/publications/2000/privileges.htm From Privileges to Rights: People Labeled with Psychiatric Disabilities Speak for Themselves]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}. [[National Council on Disability]] 20 January 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====Inpatient treatment=====
[[Treatment of mental illness|Psychiatric treatments]] have changed over the past several decades. In the past, psychiatric patients were often [[psychiatric hospital|hospitalized]] for six months or more, with some cases involving hospitalization for many years. Today, people receiving psychiatric treatment are more likely to be seen as [[general out-patient clinic|outpatients]]. If hospitalization is required, the average hospital stay is around one to two weeks, with only a small number receiving long-term hospitalization.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Psychiatric inpatients are people admitted to a hospital or clinic to receive psychiatric care. Some are admitted involuntarily, perhaps committed to a secure hospital, or in some jurisdictions to a facility within the prison system. In many countries including the USA and Canada, the criteria for involuntary admission vary with local jurisdiction. They may be as broad as having a mental health condition, or as narrow as being an immediate danger to themselves and/or others. Bed availability is often the real determinant of admission decisions to hard pressed public facilities. European Human Rights legislation restricts detention to medically certified cases of mental disorder, and adds a right to timely judicial review of detention.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

[[File:Syringe2.jpg|thumb|[[Injection (medicine)|Injections]] are one of many ways to administer psychiatric medication.]]
Patients may be admitted voluntarily if the treating doctor considers that safety isn't compromised by this less restrictive option. Inpatient psychiatric wards may be secure (for those thought to have a particular risk of violence or self-harm) or unlocked/open. Some wards are mixed-sex whilst same-sex wards are increasingly favored to protect women inpatients. Once in the care of a hospital, people are [[psychiatric assessment|assessed]], monitored, and often given medication and care from a multidisciplinary team, which may include physicians, pharmacists, psychiatric nurse practitioners, [[psychiatric and mental health nursing|psychiatric nurses]], clinical psychologists, psychotherapists, psychiatric social workers, occupational therapists and social workers. If a person receiving treatment in a psychiatric hospital is assessed as at particular risk of harming themselves or others, they may be put on constant or intermittent one-to-one supervision, and may be physically restrained or medicated. People on inpatient wards may be allowed leave for periods of time, either accompanied or on their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Treatment Protocol Project |title=Acute inpatient psychiatric care: A source book |publisher=World Health Organisation |location=Darlinghurst, Australia |year=2003 |isbn=0-9578073-1-7 |oclc=223935527 |author=Treatment Protocol Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many developed countries there has been a massive reduction in psychiatric beds since the mid 20th century, with the growth of community care. Standards of inpatient care remain a challenge in some public and private facilities, due to levels of funding, and facilities in developing countries are typically grossly inadequate for the same reason.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

=====Outpatient treatment=====
People may receive psychiatric care on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Outpatient treatment involves periodic visits to a clinician for consultation in his or her office, usually for an appointment lasting thirty to sixty minutes. These consultations normally involve the psychiatric practitioner interviewing the person to update their assessment of the person's condition, and to provide [[psychotherapy]] or review medication. The frequency with which a psychiatric practitioner sees people in treatment varies widely, from days to months, depending on the type, severity and stability of each person's condition, and depending on what the clinician and client decide would be best. Increasingly, psychiatrists are limiting their practices to psychopharmacology (prescribing medications) with little or no time devoted to psychotherapy or &quot;talk&quot; therapies, or behavior modification. Psychiatrists who serve the lower end of the market, which is dependent on insurance reimbursements, do not receive insurance payments for lengthy psychotherapy sessions which is competitive with that offered for the brief consultations needed for prescribing and monitoring medication. Psychotherapy in such situations is performed by a lower paid psychologist or social worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Talk Doesn’t Pay, So Psychiatry Turns to Drug Therapy |first=Gardiner |last=Harris |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/06/health/policy/06doctors.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=March 5, 2011 |accessdate=March 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of psychiatrists is changing in community psychiatry, with many assuming more leadership roles, coordinating and supervising teams of allied health professionals and junior doctors in delivery of health services.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

==Ethical and legal issues==
===Anti-psychiatry and deinstitutionalization===
{{Main|Anti-psychiatry}}
The introduction of [[psychiatric medication]]s and the use of [[medical laboratory|laboratory]] tests altered the [[doctor-patient relationship]] between psychiatrists and their patients.&lt;ref name=Shorter273&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 273&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatry's shift to the [[hard science]]s had been interpreted as a lack of concern for patients.&lt;ref name=Shorter273 /&gt; [[Anti-psychiatry]] had become more prevalent in the late twentieth century due to this and publications in the media which conceptualized mental disorders as myths.&lt;ref name= Shorter274&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; Others in the movement argued that psychiatry was a form of social control and demanded that institutionalized psychiatric care, stemming from Pinel's thereapeutic asylum, be abolished.&lt;ref name=Shorter277&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 277&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Electroconvulsive therapy]] (ECT) was one treatment that the anti-psychiatry movement wanted eliminated.&lt;ref name=Shorter282&gt;Shorter, E. (1997), p. 282&lt;/ref&gt; They alleged that ECT damaged the brain and was used as a tool for discipline.&lt;ref name=Shorter282/&gt;  While some believe there is no evidence that ECT damages the brain,&lt;ref name=Weiner&gt;{{cite journal | author = Weiner R.D. | year = 1984 | title = Does ECT cause brain damage? | url = | journal = Behavioral and Brain Sciences | volume = 7 | issue = | page = 153 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Meldrum&gt;{{cite journal | author = Meldrum B.S. | year = 1986 | title = Neuropathological consequences of chemically and electrically induced seizures | url = | journal = Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences | volume = 462 | issue = | page = 18693 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dwork&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dwork A.J., Arango V., Underwood M., Ilievski B., Rosoklija G., Sackeim H.A., Lisanby S.H. | year = 2004 | title = Absence of histological lesions in primate models of ECT and magnetic seizure therapy | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 161 | issue = 3| pages = 576–578 | doi = 10.1176/appi.ajp.161.3.576 | pmid = 14992989 }}&lt;/ref&gt; there are some citations that ECT does cause damage.&lt;ref name=Breggin&gt;Peter R.

(1997), p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; The pressure from the anti-psychiatry movements and the ideology of community treatment from the medical arena helped sustain deinstitutionalization.&lt;ref name=Shorter280/&gt; Thirty-three years after deinstitutionalization started in the United States, only 19% of the patients in state hospitals remained.&lt;ref name=Shorter280/&gt; [[Mental health professional]]s envisioned a process wherein patients would be discharged into communities where they could participate in a normal life while living in a therapeutic atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Shorter280/&gt; Psychiatrists were criticized, however, for failing to develop community-based support and treatment. Community-based facilities were not available because of the political infighting between in-patient and community-based social services, and an unwillingness by social services to dispense funding to provide adequately for patients to be discharged into community-based facilities.

===Medicalization of deviance===
{{See also|Medicalization}}

The concept of medicalization is created by [[sociologist]]s and used for explaining how medical knowledge is applied to a series of behaviors, over which medicine exerts control, although those behaviors are not self-evidently medical or biological.&lt;ref name=White&gt;{{cite book|last=White|first=Kevin|title=An introduction to the sociology of health and illness|year=2002|publisher=SAGE|isbn=0-7619-6400-2|pages=42|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=5bHxQBNWGHMC&amp;pg=PA42}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kittrie, a number of phenomena considered &quot;deviant&quot;, such as [[alcoholism]], [[drug addiction]] and [[mental illness]], were originally considered as moral, then legal, and now medical problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manning&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Manning |first=Nick |title=The therapeutic community movement: charisma and routinization |url=http://books.google.ru/books?id=lc4OAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA1,M1 |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1989 |page=1 |isbn=0-415-02913-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Kittrie&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Kittrie |first=Nicholas |title=The right to be different: deviance and enforced therapy |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=sIVqAAAAMAAJ |publisher=Johns Hopkins Press |location= |year=1971 |pages= |isbn=0-8018-1319-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these perceptions, peculiar deviants were subjected to moral, then legal, and now medical modes of social control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manning&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1}} Similarly, Conrad and Schneider concluded their review of the medicalization of deviance by supposing that three major paradigms may be identified that have reigned over deviance designations in different historical periods: deviance as sin; deviance as crime; and deviance as sickness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Manning&quot;/&gt;{{rp|1}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Conrad&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Conrad |first1=Peter |last2=Schneider |first2=Joseph |title=Deviance and medicalization: from badness to sickness |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=hYpZjDD67dkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA36,M1 |publisher=Temple University Press |location= |year=1992 |page=36 |isbn=0-87722-999-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|36}} According to [[Franco Basaglia]] and his followers, whose approach pointed out the role of psychiatric institutions in the control and medicalization of deviant behaviors and social problems, psychiatry is used as the provider of scientific support for social control to the existing establishment, and the ensuing standards of deviance and normality brought about repressive views of discrete social groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sapouna&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sapouna |first1=Lydia |last2=Herrmann |first2=Peter |title=Knowledge in Mental Health: Reclaiming the Social |url=http://books.google.com/?id=y1-X6iP-m9UC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA70,M1 |publisher=Nova Publishers |location=Hauppauge |year=2006 |page=70 |isbn=1-59454-812-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|70}} As scholars have long argued, governmental and medical institutions code menaces to authority as mental diseases during political disturbances.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metzl&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Metzl|first=Jonathan|title=The Protest Psychosis: How Schizophrenia Became a Black Disease|year=2010|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=0-8070-8592-8|page=14|url=http://books.google.ru/books?id=t1Bg9QEiCAMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA14,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|14}}
