DU penetrator from the A-10 30mm round]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Depleted uranium''' ('''DU'''; also referred to in the past as '''Q-metal''', '''depletalloy''' or '''D-38''') is [[uranium]] with a lower content of the [[fissile]] [[isotope]] [[uranium-235|U-235]] than natural uranium. (Natural uranium is about 99.27% [[uranium-238|U-238]], 0.72% [[uranium-235|U-235]]&amp;mdash;the fissile isotope, and 0.0055% [[uranium-234|U-234]]).  Uses of DU take advantage of its very high [[density]] of 19.1&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (68.4% denser than [[lead]]). Civilian uses include [[counterweight]]s in aircraft, radiation shielding in medical [[radiation therapy]] and industrial [[radiography]] equipment and containers used to transport radioactive materials. Military uses include defensive [[Vehicle armour|armor plating]] and [[Armor-piercing shot and shell|armor-piercing]] [[projectiles]].

Most depleted uranium arises as a byproduct of the production of [[enriched uranium]] for use in [[nuclear reactor]]s and in the manufacture of [[nuclear weapon]]s. Enrichment processes generate uranium with a higher-than-natural concentration of lower-mass uranium isotopes (in particular U-235, which is the uranium isotope supporting the [[Nuclear fission|fission]] [[chain reaction]]) with the bulk of the feed ending up as depleted uranium, in some cases with mass fractions of U-235 and U-234 less than a third of those in natural uranium.&lt;ref&gt;and, therefore, about a 0.5% increase in U-238 content&lt;/ref&gt; U-238 has a much longer halflife than the lighter isotopes, and DU therefore emits less [[alpha radiation]] than the same mass of natural uranium: the US Defense Department states DU used in US munitions has 60% the radioactivity of natural uranium.&lt;ref name=&quot;USOSD&quot;&gt;[http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/du_ii/du_ii_tabc.htm &quot;Properties and Characteristics of DU&quot;] U.S. Office of the Secretary of Defense&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the U-235 content of nuclear reactor fuel is reduced by fission, uranium recovered by [[nuclear reprocessing]] from spent nuclear reactor fuel made from natural uranium will have a lower-than-natural U-235 concentration. Such ‘reactor-depleted’ material will have different isotopic ratios from enrichment byproduct DU, and can be distinguished from it by the presence of [[uranium-236|U-236]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2001/unep81.doc.htm|title=UN Press Release UNEP/81: Uranium 236 found in depleted uranium penetrators|publisher=UN|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trace [[transuranic]]s (another indicator of the use of reprocessed material) have been reported to be present in some US tank armour.&lt;ref name=&quot;USOSD&quot;/&gt;

The use of DU in [[munitions]] is controversial because of questions about potential long-term health effects.&lt;ref name=MillerMcClain /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Pattison|first1 = John E.|last2 = Hugtenburg|first2 = Richard P.|last3 = Green|first3 = Stuart|year = 2010|title = Enhancement of Natural Background Gamma-radiation Dose around Uranium Micro-particles in the Human Body|journal = Journal of the Royal Society Interface|volume = 7|issue = 45| pages = 603–611|doi = 10.1098/rsif.2009.0300}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normal functioning of the [[kidney]], [[Human brain|brain]], [[liver]], [[Human heart|heart]], and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure, because uranium is a [[toxic metal]].&lt;ref name=Craft04 /&gt; It is weakly [[radioactive]] and remains so because of its long [[half-life|radioactive half-life]] (4.468 billion years for [[uranium-238]], 700 million years for [[uranium-235]]). The [[biological half-life]] (the average time it takes for the human body to eliminate half the amount in the body) for uranium is about 15 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Retrieved January 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The actual level of [[acute (medicine)|acute]] and [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] [[toxicity]] of DU is also a point of medical controversy. Several studies using [[tissue culture|cultured cells]] and laboratory [[rodents]] suggest the possibility of [[leukemia|leukemogenic]], [[gene]]tic, [[reproduction|reproductive]], and [[neurological]] effects from chronic exposure.&lt;ref name=MillerMcClain&gt;{{cite journal

A 2005 [[epidemiology]] review concluded: &quot;In aggregate the human epidemiological evidence is consistent with increased risk of birth defects in offspring of persons exposed to DU.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hindin&quot; /&gt; However, the [[World Health Organization]], the directing and coordinating authority for health within the United Nations which is responsible for setting health research norms and standards, providing technical support to countries and monitoring and assessing health trends, states that no risk of [[reproductive]], [[developmental]], or [[carcinogenic]] effects have been reported in humans due to DU exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
Enriched uranium was first manufactured in the early 1940s when the [[United States]] began its [[nuclear weapons]] program.  Later in the decade, [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[France]], and the [[Soviet Union]] began their [[nuclear weapon]]s and [[nuclear power]] programs. It was at this time that depleted uranium was first stored as an unusable waste product ([[uranium hexafluoride]]). There was some hope that the enrichment process would be improved and [[Nuclear fission|fission]]able [[isotope]]s of U-235 could, at some future date, be extracted from the depleted uranium. This re-enrichment recovery of the residual uranium-235 contained in the depleted uranium is no longer a matter of the future: it has been practiced for several years.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it is possible to design civilian power-generating [[Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor|reactors using unenriched fuel]], but only about 10% of reactors ever built utilize that technology. Both nuclear weapons production and [[Nuclear marine propulsion|naval reactors]] require fuel containing concentrated U-235.

In the 1970s, [[the Pentagon]] reported that the [[Red Army|Soviet military]] had developed [[armor plating]] for [[Warsaw Pact]] tanks that [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization|NATO]] ammunition could not penetrate. The Pentagon began searching for material to make denser armor-piercing projectiles. After testing various metals, [[ammunition#Ordnance ammunition|ordnance]] researchers settled on depleted uranium.

The US and NATO militaries used DU penetrator rounds in the [[1991 Gulf War]], the [[Bosnia war]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These training rounds had been forgotten because they were used in a highly classified program and had been fired before DU had become an item of interest, more than 20 years before the Gulf War.

===Production and availability===
[[Natural uranium]] metal contains about 0.71% [[Uranium-235|U-235]], 99.28% [[Uranium-238|U-238]], and about 0.0054% [[Uranium-234|U-234]]. In order to produce [[enriched uranium]], the process of [[isotope separation]] removes a substantial portion of the U-235 for use in nuclear power, weapons, or other uses. The remainder, ''depleted uranium'', contains only 0.2% to 0.4% U-235. Because natural uranium begins with such a low percentage of U-235, enrichment produces large quantities of depleted uranium. For example, producing 1&amp;nbsp;kg of 5% enriched uranium requires 11.8&amp;nbsp;kg of natural uranium, and leaves about 10.8&amp;nbsp;kg of depleted uranium with only 0.3% U-235 remaining.

The [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] (NRC) defines ''depleted uranium'' as uranium with a percentage of the &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U isotope that is less than 0.711% by weight (see [http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part040/part040-0004.html 10 CFR 40.4]). The military specifications designate that the DU used by the [[U.S. Department of Defense]] (DoD) contain less than 0.3% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U (AEPI, 1995). In actuality, DoD uses only DU that contains approximately 0.2% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U (AEPI, 1995).

Depleted Uranium is also produced by recycling 'spent' nuclear fuel &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs257/en/ Depleted uranium] WHO Fact sheet N°257, Revised January 2003&lt;/ref&gt;, in which case it contains traces of Pu and Np

Laforge, Centre for Research on Globalisation (CRG), 2002&lt;/ref&gt; although the quantities are so small that they are considered to be not of serious radiological significance (even) by [[ECRR]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euradcom.org/publications/ecrruraniumrept.pdf The Health Effects of Exposure to Uranium and Uranium Weapons Fallout] Chris Busby, Documents of the ECRR 2010 No 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uranium hexafluoride===
[[File:DUF6 cylinder leak.gif|250px|thumb|right|Hexafluoride tank leaking]]
About 95% of the depleted uranium produced is stored as [[uranium hexafluoride]], a crystalline solid, (D)UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, in steel cylinders in open air storage yards close to enrichment plants. Each cylinder holds up to 12.7 tonnes (or 14 short tons) of UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. In the U.S. 560,000 tonnes of depleted UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; had accumulated by 1993. In 2008, 686,500 tonnes in 57,122 storage cylinders were located near [[Portsmouth, Ohio]] and [[Paducah, Kentucky]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq16.cfm How much depleted uranium hexafluoride is stored in the United States], anl.gov&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/documents/index.cfm Depleted UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; Management Program Documents]&lt;/ref&gt;

The storage of DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; presents environmental, health, and safety risks because of its chemical instability. When UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is exposed to water vapor in the air, it reacts with the moisture to produce UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ([[uranyl fluoride]]), a solid, and HF ([[hydrofluoric acid|hydrogen fluoride]]), a gas, both of which are highly soluble and toxic. The uranyl fluoride solid acts to plug the leak, limiting further escape of depleted UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. Release of the hydrogen fluoride gas to the atmosphere is also slowed by the plug formation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq21.cfm What happens if a cylinder of uranium hexafluoride leaks?]&lt;/ref&gt; Storage cylinders are regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks, and are repainted and repaired as necessary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/pdf/DUF6MgmtOverviewFS.PDF], Overview of Depleted Uranium Hexafluoride Management Program&lt;/ref&gt;

A tenfold jump in uranium prices has transformed approximately one-third of the U.S. depleted uranium inventory into an asset worth $7.6 billion, assuming DOE re-enriches the tails. This estimate is based on February 2008 market price for uranium and enrichment services, and DOE's access to sufficient uranium enrichment capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cibolabeacon.com/articles/2008/04/03/news/news7.txt Agency review nuclear waste], Cibola County Beacon – News, April 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been several accidents involving uranium hexafluoride in the United States, including one in which 31 workers were exposed to a cloud of UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; and its reaction products.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} Though some of the more highly exposed workers showed evidence of short-term [[kidney]] damage (e.g., [[proteinuria|protein in the urine]]), none of these workers had lasting kidney toxicity from the uranium exposure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/health/faq30.cfm FAQ 30-Have there been accidents involving uranium hexafluoride?]&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. government has been converting DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to solid uranium oxides for use or disposal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq22.cfm FAQ 22-What is going to happen to the uranium hexafluoride stored in the United States?]&lt;/ref&gt; Such disposal of the entire DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; inventory could cost anywhere from $15 million to $450 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/mgmt/faq27.cfm FAQ 27-Are there any currently-operating disposal facilities that can accept all of the depleted uranium oxide that would be generated from conversion of DOE's depleted UF6 inventory?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military applications==
[[File:M900.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The 105mm M900 APFSDS-T (Depleted Uranium Armor Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot – Tracer)]]

Depleted uranium is very dense; at 19050&amp;nbsp;kg/m³, it is 1.67 times as dense as [[lead]], only slightly less dense than [[tungsten]] and [[gold]], and 84% as dense as [[osmium]] or [[iridium]], which are the densest known substances under standard (i.e., Earth-surface) pressures. Thus a given mass of it has a smaller diameter than an equivalent lead projectile, with less [[external ballistics|aerodynamic drag]] and deeper [[terminal ballistics|penetration]] due to a higher pressure at point of impact. DU projectile ordnance is often [[incendiary device|incendiary]] because of its [[pyrophoric]] property.&lt;ref name=doehbk&gt;US Dept. of Energy Handbook, [http://hss.energy.gov/NuclearSafety/techstds/standard/hdbk1081/hbk1081.html &quot;Primer on Spontaneous Heating and Pyrophoricity&quot;], Chapter [http://hss.energy.gov/NuclearSafety/techstds/standard/hdbk1081/hbk1081e.html#ZZ30 &quot;Uranium&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armor plate===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Depleted Uranium Armour]] --&gt;
Because of its high density, depleted uranium can also be used in tank armor, sandwiched between sheets of steel armor plate. For instance, some late-production [[M1 Abrams|M1A1HA and M1A2 Abrams]] tanks built after 1998 have DU reinforcement as part of the armor plating in the front of the hull and the front of the turret, and there is a program to upgrade the rest (see [[Chobham armour#Heavy metal modules|Chobham armor]]).

===Nuclear weapons===
Depleted uranium is used as a [[Neutron reflector#Nuclear weapons|tamper]] in [[Nuclear weapon#Fission weapons|fission bomb]]s.

===Ammunition===
Most military use of depleted uranium has been as [[30 mm caliber]] ordnance, primarily the 30&amp;nbsp;mm PGU-14/B armour-piercing [[Incendiary device|incendiary]] round from the [[GAU-8 Avenger]] cannon of the [[A-10 Thunderbolt II]] used by the [[United States Air Force]]. 25&amp;nbsp;mm DU rounds have been used in the [[M242]] gun mounted on the U.S. Army's [[M2 Bradley|Bradley Fighting Vehicle]] and Marine Corp's [[LAV-25]].

The [[United States Marine Corps]] uses DU in the 25&amp;nbsp;mm PGU-20 round fired by the [[GAU-12 Equalizer]] cannon of the [[AV-8 Harrier II|AV-8B Harrier]], and also in the 20&amp;nbsp;mm [[M197]] gun mounted on [[AH-1 Cobra]] helicopter gunships. The [[United States Navy]]'s [[Phalanx CIWS]]'s [[M61 Vulcan]] [[Gatling gun]] used 20&amp;nbsp;mm armor-piercing penetrator rounds with discarding [[plastic]] [[sabot]]s which were made using depleted uranium, later changed to [[tungsten]].

Another use of depleted uranium is in [[kinetic energy penetrator]]s [[anti-armor]] rounds, such as the 120&amp;nbsp;mm sabot rounds fired from the M1A1 and M1A2 Abrams.&lt;ref&gt;Fahey, D. (2003) [http://www.antenna.nl/wise/uranium/pdf/dumyths.pdf &quot;Science or Science Fiction? Facts, Myths and Propaganda In the Debate Over Depleted Uranium Weapons&quot;], Table 1 on p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Kinetic energy penetrator rounds consist of a long, relatively thin penetrator surrounded by discarding [[sabot]]. Staballoys are metal alloys of depleted uranium with a very small proportion of other metals, usually [[titanium]] or [[molybdenum]]. One formulation has a composition of 99.25% by mass of depleted uranium and 0.75% by mass of [[titanium]]. Staballoys are approximately 1.67 times as dense as lead and are designed for use in [[kinetic energy penetrator]] [[armor-piercing]] ammunition. The [[United States Army|US Army]] uses DU in an alloy with around 3.5% titanium.

''et al.''|date=June 2005|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=113|issue=6|doi=10.1289/ehp.7791}}&lt;/ref&gt; at least some of the most promising tungsten alloys that have been considered as replacement for depleted uranium in penetrator ammunitions, such as tungsten-[[cobalt]] or tungsten-[[nickel]]-cobalt alloys, also possess extreme [[carcinogen]]ic properties, which by far exceed those (confirmed or suspected) of depleted uranium itself: 100% of [[rat]]s implanted with a pellet of such alloys developed lethal [[rhabdomyosarcoma]] within a few weeks.

Depleted uranium is favored for the penetrator because it is self-sharpening and [[pyrophoric]].&lt;ref name=doehbk/&gt; On impact with a hard target, such as an armored vehicle, the nose of the rod fractures in such a way that it remains sharp. The impact and subsequent release of heat energy causes it to disintegrate to dust and burn when it reaches air because of its [[pyrophoric]] properties.&lt;ref name=doehbk/&gt; When a DU penetrator reaches the interior of an armored vehicle, it catches fire, often igniting ammunition and fuel, killing the crew, and possibly causing the vehicle to explode. DU is used by the U.S. Army in 120&amp;nbsp;mm or 105&amp;nbsp;mm cannons employed on the [[M1 Abrams]] [[tank]]. The Russian military has used DU ammunition in [[tank]] main gun ammunition since the late 1970s, mostly for the 115&amp;nbsp;mm guns in the [[T-62]] tank and the 125&amp;nbsp;mm guns in the [[T-64]], [[T-72]], [[T-80]], and [[T-90]] tanks.

The DU content in various ammunition is 180 g in 20&amp;nbsp;mm projectiles, 200 g in 25&amp;nbsp;mm ones, 280 g in 30&amp;nbsp;mm, 3.5&amp;nbsp;kg in 105&amp;nbsp;mm, and 4.5&amp;nbsp;kg in 120&amp;nbsp;mm penetrators. DU was used during the mid-1990s in the U.S. to make [[Hand grenade|grenades]], [[cluster bomb]]s, and [[land mine|mines]], but those applications have been discontinued, according to [[Alliant Techsystems]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The [[US Navy]] used DU in its 20&amp;nbsp;mm [[Phalanx CIWS]] guns, but switched in the late 1990s to armor-piercing tungsten.

It is thought that between 17 and 20 countries have weapons incorporating depleted uranium in their arsenals. They include the U.S., the [[United Kingdom|UK]], [[France]], [[Russia]], [[People's Republic of China|China]], [[India]], [[Turkey]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Israel]], [[Bahrain]], [[Egypt]], [[Kuwait]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]], [[Iraq]] and [[Republic of China|Taiwan]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} DU ammunition is manufactured in 18 countries. Only the US and the UK have acknowledged using DU weapons.&lt;ref&gt;''The International Legality of the Use of Depleted Uranium Weapons: A Precautionary Approach'', Avril McDonald, Jann K.

In a three week period of conflict in Iraq during 2003 it was estimated over 1000 tons of depleted uranium munitions were used.&lt;ref name=&quot;gaurdian2003&quot;&gt;Paul Brown, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2003/apr/25/internationaleducationnews.armstrade Gulf troops face tests for cancer] ''guardian.co.uk'' 25 April 2003.

Iran also has performed wide research on DU penetrators since 2001.

===Legal status in weapons===
In 1996 the [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) gave an advisory opinion on the &quot;''[[legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons]]''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cornnet.nl/~akmalten/unan5a.html ADVISORY OPINION 1996 July 8; General List No.95 (req: UNGA)]. Cornnet.nl. Retrieved on 2011-01-16.&lt;/ref&gt; This made it clear, in paragraphs 54, 55 and 56, that [[international law]] on poisonous weapons—the Second Hague Declaration of 29 July 1899, Hague Convention IV of 18 October 1907 and the Geneva Protocol of 17 June 1925—did not cover nuclear weapons, because their prime or exclusive use was not to poison or asphyxiate. This ICJ opinion was about nuclear weapons, but the sentence &quot;The terms have been understood, in the practice of States, in their ordinary sense as covering weapons whose prime, or even exclusive, effect is to poison or asphyxiate,&quot; also removes depleted uranium weaponry from coverage by the same treaties as their primary use is not to poison or asphyxiate, but to destroy [[materiel]] and kill soldiers through [[kinetic energy]].

Yeung Sik Yuen to prepare, without financial implications, in the context of human rights and humanitarian norms, the working paper originally assigned to Ms. Forero Ucros.''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; by Y.K.J. Yeung Sik Yuen in accordance with [[Sub-Commission on the Promotion and Protection of Human Rights]] resolution 2001/36. He argues that the use of DU in weapons, along with the other weapons listed by the Sub‑Commission, may breach one or more of the following treaties: [[the Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[Charter of the United Nations]], the [[Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide|Genocide Convention]], the [[United Nations Convention Against Torture]], the [[Geneva Conventions]] including [[Protocol I]], the [[Convention on Conventional Weapons]] of 1980, and the [[Chemical Weapons Convention]]. Yeung Sik Yuen writes in Paragraph 133 under the title &quot;''Legal compliance of weapons containing DU as a new weapon''&quot;:

{{quotation|Annex II to the [[Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material]] 1980 (which became operative on 8 February 1997) classifies DU as a category II nuclear material. Storage and transport rules are set down for that category which indicates that DU is considered sufficiently &quot;hot&quot; and dangerous to warrant these protections. But since weapons containing DU are relatively new weapons no treaty exists yet to regulate, limit or prohibit its use. The legality or illegality of DU weapons must therefore be tested by recourse to the general rules governing the use of weapons under humanitarian and human rights law which have already been analysed in Part I of this paper, and more particularly at paragraph 35 which states that parties to [[Protocol I]] to the Geneva Conventions of 1949 have an obligation to ascertain that new weapons do not violate the laws and customs of war or any other international law. As mentioned, the [[International Court of Justice]] considers this rule binding customary humanitarian law.}}

[[Louise Arbour]], chief prosecutor for the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] led a committee of staff lawyers to investigate possible treaty prohibitions against the use of DU in weapons. Their findings were that:&lt;ref&gt;Joe Sills ''et al'' ''[http://www.aepi.army.mil/internet/env-crime-icc-printer.pdf Environmental Crimes in Military Actions and the International Criminal Court (ICC)-United Nations Perspectives]'' (PDF) ([http://64.233.183.104/search?q=cache:JT7rhRB-PgYJ:www.aepi.army.mil/internet/env-crime-icc-printer.pdf HTML]) of American Council for the UN University, April 2002.

In 2007 France, Britain, the [[Netherlands]], and the [[Czech Republic]] voted against a [[United Nations General Assembly]] resolution to hold a debate in 2009 about the effects of the use of armaments and ammunitions containing depleted uranium.

In September 2008, and in response to the 2007 General Assembly resolution, the [[UN Secretary General]] published the views of 15 states alongside those of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) and [[World Health Organization]] (WHO). The IAEA and WHO evidence differed little from previous statements on the issue.&lt;ref name=ICBUW&gt;Staff.

In December 2008, 141 states supported a resolution requesting that three UN agencies: [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP), WHO and IAEA update their research on the impact of uranium munitions by late 2010 – to coincide with the General Assembly's 65th Session, four voted against, 34 abstained and 13 were absent&lt;ref name=ga10792&gt;[http://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2008/ga10792.doc.htm UN Department of Public Information: Effects of the use of Armaments and Ammunitions Containing Depleted Uranium (A/C.1/63/L.26)] See draft XIV and also Annex XIII&lt;/ref&gt; As before Britain and France voted against the resolution. All other European Union nations voted in favour or abstained: the Netherlands, which voted against a resolution in 2007, voted in favour, as did Finland and [[Norway]], both of which had abstained in 2007, while the Czech Republic, which voted against the resolution in 2007, abstained.

In September 2009, the [[Latin American Parliament]] passed a resolution calling for a regional moratorium on the use, production and procurement of uranium weapons. It also called on the Parlatino's members to work towards an international uranium weapons treaty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bandepleteduranium.org/en/docs/110.pdf Resolución Latinoamericana de la Comision de Derechos Humanos, Justicia y Politicas Carcelarias: Prohibición de las armas de uranio]&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010 the UN General Assembly passed a resolution calling on users of depleted uranium to hand over quantitative and geographical data on their use, to the relevant authorities of affected states when requested to do so. The resolution passed by 148 votes to four, with 30 abstentions. Five states that have abstained on previous resolutions in 2007 and 2008 voted in favour – Belgium, Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina, Greece, Luxembourg and Slovenia, and no former supporters changed position.

==Civilian applications==
Depleted uranium has a very high density and is primarily used as shielding material for other radioactive material, and as [[Sailing ballast|ballast]]. Examples include sailboat [[keel]]s, as [[counterweight]]s and as shielding in industrial [[radiography]] cameras.

===Shielding in industrial radiography cameras===
[[Industrial radiography]] cameras include a very high activity [[gamma radiation]] source (typically [[iridium|Ir-192]] with an activity above 10 TBq). Depleted uranium is often used in the cameras as a shield to protect individuals from the gamma source. Typically the uranium shield is supported and enclosed in [[polyurethane]] foam for thermal, mechanical and oxidation protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Coloring in consumer products===
Consumer product uses have included incorporation into [[dental porcelain]], used for [[false teeth]] to simulate the fluorescence of natural teeth, and uranium-bearing reagents used in chemistry laboratories (e.g. [[uranyl acetate]], used in [[analytical chemistry]] and as a [[staining|stain]] in [[electron microscopy]]). Uranium (both depleted uranium and natural uranium) was widely used as a coloring matter for [[Fiestaware|porcelain]] and [[Uranium glass|glass]] in the 19th and early-to-mid-20th century. The practice was largely discontinued in the late 20th century. In 1999 concentrations of 10% depleted uranium were being used in &quot;jaune no.17&quot; a yellow [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] powder that was being produced in [[France]] by Cristallerie de Saint-Paul, a manufacturer of enamel [[pigment]]s. The depleted uranium used in the powder was sold by [[Cogéma]]'s Pierrelatte facility. In February 2000, Cogema discontinued the sale of depleted uranium to producers of enamel and glass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Trim weights in aircraft===
Aircraft that contain depleted uranium trim weights (such as the [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747–100]]) may contain between 400 to 1,500&amp;nbsp;kg of DU. This application is controversial because the DU may enter the environment if the aircraft were to crash. The metal can also [[oxidation|oxidize]] to a fine powder in a fire. Its use has been phased out in many newer aircraft. [[Boeing]] and [[McDonnell-Douglas]] discontinued using DU counterweights in the 1980s. Depleted uranium was released during the crash of [[El Al Flight 1862]], in which 152&amp;nbsp;kg was lost, but an extensive study concluded that there was no evidence to link depleted uranium from the plane to any health problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uijt de Haag P.A. and Smetsers R.C. and Witlox H.W. and Krus H.W. and Eisenga A.H. 2000&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author= Uijt de Haag P.A. and Smetsers R.C. and Witlox H.W. and Krus H.W. and Eisenga A.H.|title=Evaluating the risk from depleted uranium after the Boeing 747-258F crash in Amsterdam, 1992.|journal=J Hazard Mater.|year=2000|pmid= 10863013|volume= 76|issue= 1|pages= 39–58|doi= 10.1016/S0304-3894(00)00183-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Counterweights manufactured with [[cadmium]] [[plating]] are considered non-hazardous while the plating is intact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===U.S. NRC general license===
U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission regulations at [http://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/cfr/part040/part040-0025.html 10 CFR 40.25] establish a general license for the use of depleted uranium contained in industrial products or devices for mass-volume applications. This general license allows anyone to possess or use depleted uranium for authorized purposes. Generally, a registration form is required, along with a commitment to not abandon the material. Agreement states may have similar, or more stringent, regulations.

===Sailboat keel===
[[Pen Duick|Pen Duick VI]], a boat designed by André Mauric and used for racing, was equipped with a keel in depleted uranium. It was later replaced by a standard lead keel.

===Sampling Calorimeters for detectors in high-energy particle physics===
Depleted uranium has been used in a number of [[calorimeter (particle_physics)#Homogeneous versus sampling|sampling calorimeters]] (such as in the D0&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=An Experiment at D0 to Study anti-Proton - Proton Collisions at 2-TeV: Design Report.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ZEUS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-zeus.desy.de/bluebook/ch05/chapter2_4.html|title=The ZEUS detector: Status Report 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; detectors) in due to its high density and natural radioactivity.

==Health considerations==
Normal functioning of the [[kidney]], [[Human brain|brain]], [[liver]], [[Human heart|heart]], and numerous other systems can be affected by uranium exposure, because in addition to being weakly radioactive, uranium is a [[toxic metal]].&lt;ref name=Craft04&gt;{{cite journal

As early as 1997, British Army doctors warned the British MoD (Ministry of Defence) that exposure to depleted uranium increased the risk of developing lung, lymph and brain cancer, and recommended a series of safety precautions.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk/2001/jan/11/armstrade.world?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Richard | last=Norton-Taylor | title=MoD knew shells were cancer risk | date=2001-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a report issued summarizing the advice of the doctors, 'Inhalation of insoluble [[uranium dioxide]] dust will lead to accumulation in the lungs with very slow clearance - if any . . . Although chemical toxicity is low, there may be localised radiation damage of the lung leading to cancer.&quot; The report warns that 'All personnel... should be aware that uranium dust inhalation carries a long-term risk...

Metallic uranium is prone to slow [[corrosion]] and small pieces are [[pyrophoric]] at room temperature in air.&lt;ref name=doehbk /&gt; When depleted uranium munitions penetrate armor or burn, they create depleted [[uranium oxide]]s in the form of dust that can be inhaled or contaminate wounds. Additionally, fragments of munitions or armor can become embedded in the body.

===Chemical toxicity===
The chemical toxicity of depleted uranium is about a million times greater ''in vitro'' than its radiological hazard.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|pmid = 12121782 |last1 = Miller|first1 = AC|last2 = Stewart|first2 = M|last3 = Brooks|first3 = K|last4 = Shi|first4 = L|last5 = Page|first5 = N|title = Depleted uranium-catalyzed oxidative DNA damage: absence of significant alpha particle decay.|journal = Journal of Inorganic Biochemistry| volume=91|issue=1|year=2002|month=July|pages=246–52|doi = 10.1016/S0162-0134(02)00391-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health effects of DU are determined by factors such as the extent of exposure and whether it was internal or external. Three main pathways exist by which internalization of uranium may occur: [[inhalation]], [[ingestion]], and embedded fragments or [[Fragmentation (weaponry)|shrapnel]] contamination. Properties such as phase (e.g. particulate or gaseous), oxidation state (e.g. metallic or ceramic), and the solubility of uranium and its compounds influence their [[Absorption (skin)|absorption]], [[Distribution (pharmacology)|distribution]], translocation, [[Clearance (medicine)|elimination]] and the resulting toxicity.

Uranium is pyrophoric when finely divided.&lt;ref name=doehbk /&gt; It will corrode under the influence of air and water producing insoluble uranium(IV) and soluble uranium (VI) salts. Soluble uranium salts are toxic. Uranium slowly accumulates in several organs, such as the [[liver]], [[spleen]], and kidneys. The [[World Health Organization]] has established a daily &quot;tolerated intake&quot; of soluble uranium salts for the general public of 0.5&amp;nbsp;µg/kg body weight, or 35&amp;nbsp;µg for a 70&amp;nbsp;kg adult.

Approximately 90 [[microgram]]s of natural uranium, on average, exist in the human body as a result of normal intake of water, food and air. Most is in the [[skeleton]]. The [[biochemistry]] of depleted uranium is, for all practical purposes, the same as natural uranium.

===Radiological hazards===

The primary radiation danger from depleted uranium is due to [[alpha particle]]s, which do not travel far through air, and do not penetrate clothing.  Thus, the primary concern is internal exposure, due to inhalation, ingestion or shrapnel contamination.  Available evidence suggests that this risk is small relative to the chemical hazard.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

According to the [[World Health Organization]], a [[Ionizing radiation|radiation]] [[Dose (biochemistry)|dose]] from it would be about 60% of that from purified natural uranium with the same mass; the [[radiological]] dangers are lower due to its longer half-life and the removal of the more radioactive isotopes. However, in a matter of a month or so, depleted uranium generates amounts of [[thorium-234]] and [[protactinium-234]] which emit [[beta particles]] at almost the same rate as that of the alpha particles from the uranium-238.

:&quot;Dr. Kang found that male Gulf War veterans reported having infants with likely birth defects at twice the rate of non-veterans. Furthermore, female Gulf War veterans were almost three times more likely to report children with birth defects than their non-Gulf counterparts.

The U.S. Army has commissioned ongoing research into potential risks of depleted uranium and other projectile weapon materials like tungsten, which the U.S. Navy has used in place of DU since 1993. Studies by the U.S. Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute conclude that moderate exposures to either depleted uranium or uranium present a significant [[toxicology|toxicological]] threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.afrri.usuhs.mil/www/outreach/pdf/mcclain_NATO_2005.pdf | title=Status of Health Concerns about Military Use of Depleted Uranium and Surrogate Metals in Armor-Penetrating Munitions|author=D.E.

One particular subgroup of veterans which may be at higher risk comprises those who have internally retained fragments of DU from shrapnel wounds. A laboratory study on rats produced by the Armed Forces Radiobiology Research Institute showed that, after a study period of 6 months, rats treated with depleted uranium coming from implanted pellets, comparable to the average levels in the urine of [[Desert Storm]] veterans with retained DU fragments, had developed a significant tendency to lose weight with respect to the control group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.afrri.usuhs.mil/www/outreach/pdf/pellmar.pdf | title=Toxicological Evaluation of Depleted Uranium in Rats: Six Month Evaluation Point|author=T.C.Pellmar, J.B.

Substantial amounts of uranium were accumulating in their [[Human brain|brain]]s and [[central nervous system]]s, and showed a significant reduction of [[neurone|neuronal]] activity in the [[hippocampus]] in response to external stimuli. The conclusions of the study show that brain damage from chronic uranium intoxication is possible at lower doses than previously thought. Results from computer-based neurocognitive tests performed in 1997 showed an association between uranium in the urine and &quot;problematic performance on automated tests assessing performance efficiency and accuracy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bordujenko|first= A.|date=September 2002|url= http://www.defence.gov.au/health/infocentre/journals/ADFHJ_sep02/ADFHealth_3_2_50-57.pdf | title=Military medical aspects of depleted uranium munitions|journal=ADF Health|publisher=Australian Defence Forces|volume = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 Professor Brian Spratt FRS, chairman of the [[Royal Society]]'s working group on depleted uranium, said: &quot;The question of who carries out the initial monitoring and clean-up is a political rather than scientific question,&quot; and &quot;[[Multinational force in Iraq|the coalition]] needs to acknowledge that depleted uranium is a potential hazard and make in-roads into tackling it by being open about where and how much depleted uranium has been deployed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;gaurdian2003&quot; /&gt;

===Iraqi population===
Since 2001, medical personnel at the [[Basra]] hospital in southern Iraq have reported a sharp increase in the incidence of child leukemia and genetic malformation among babies born in the decade following the Gulf War. Iraqi doctors attributed these malformations to possible long-term effects of DU, an opinion which was echoed by several newspapers.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bostonglobe&quot;&gt;Elizabeth Neuffer [http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0126-03.htm Iraqis Trace Surge in Cancer to US Bombings] ''Boston Globe'' January 26, 2003, Page: A11 Section: National/Foreign&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Larry Johnson [http://www.seattlepi.com/national/95178_du12.shtml Iraqi cancers, birth defects blamed on U.S. depleted uranium] ''Seattle Post-Intelligencer'' November 12, 2002.

A medical survey, &quot;[[Cancer]], [[Infant Mortality]] and Birth [[Human sex ratio|Sex Ratio]] in [[Fallujah]], Iraq 2005–2009&quot; published in July 2010, states that the &quot;Increase in cancer and [[birth defects]]…are alarmingly high&quot; and that infant mortality 2009/2010 has reached 13.6%.

In 2001, doctors at the Serb-run hospital in [[Kosovska Mitrovica]] say the number of patients suffering from malignant diseases has increased by 200% since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1119197.stm |title=BBC News &amp;#124; EUROPE &amp;#124; Uranium tests for Serbs |publisher=News.bbc.co.uk |date= 15 January 2001&lt;!--, 20:24 GMT --&gt;|accessdate=2008-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, the [[World Health Organization]] reported that data from [[Kosovo]] was inconclusive and called for further studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/entity/ionizing_radiation/pub_meet/en/Report_WHO_depleted_uranium_Eng.pdf Report of the WHO's Depleted Uranium Mission to Kosovo (pdf 123kb)] January 22–31, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 2003 study by the [[United Nations Environment Programme]] (UNEP) in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] stated that low levels of contaminate were found in drinking water and air particulate at DU penetrator impact points. The levels were stated as not a cause for alarm. Yet, [[Pekka Haavisto]], chairman of the UNEP DU projects stated, &quot;The findings of this study stress again the importance of appropriate clean-up and civil protection measures in a post-conflict situation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=298&amp;ArticleID=3926&amp;l=en Low-level DU contamination found in Bosnia and Herzegovina, UNEP calls for precaution] ''United Nations Environment Programme'', 25 March 2003. Retrieved January 25, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contamination as a result of the Afghan War===
The Canadian Uranium Medical Research Centre obtained urine samples from bombed civilian areas in [[Jalalabad]] that showed concentrations of 80-400&amp;nbsp;ng/L of undepleted uranium, far higher than the typical concentration in the British population of ~5&amp;nbsp;ng/L.&lt;ref&gt;A. Durakovic, 2005, &quot;The Quantitative Analysis of Uranium Isotopes in the Urine of the Civilian Population of Eastern
Afghanistan after Operation Enduring Freedom&quot;, Military Medicine, vol. 170, no. 4, pp. 277–284.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies indicating negligible effects===
Studies in 2005 and earlier have concluded that DU ammunition has no measurable detrimental health effects.

A 1999 [[literature review]] conducted by the [[Rand Corporation]] stated: &quot;No evidence is documented in the literature of cancer or any other negative health effect related to the radiation received from exposure to depleted or natural uranium, whether inhaled or ingested, even at very high doses,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/library/randrep/du/cover.html|title=&quot;A Review of the Scientific Literature as it Pertains to Gulf War Illnesses,&quot; Rand Report, 1999.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a RAND report authored by the U.S. Defense department undersecretary charged with evaluating DU hazards considered the debate to be more political than scientific.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard D. Rostker]] [http://www.rand.org/pubs/papers/P8066/ Depleted Uranium, A Case Study of Good and Evil]. RAND Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 [[oncology]] study concluded that &quot;the present scientific consensus is that DU exposure to humans, in locations where DU ammunition was deployed, is very unlikely to give rise to [[cancer induction]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former [[NATO Secretary General]] [[George Robertson, Baron Robertson of Port Ellen|Lord Robertson]] stated in 2001 that &quot;the existing medical consensus is clear. The hazard from depleted uranium is both very limited, and limited to very specific circumstances&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nato.int/docu/speech/2001/s010110a.htm NATO Press Conference on Depleted Uranium]&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 study from the [[Australia]]n defense ministry concluded that &quot;there has been no established increase in mortality or morbidity in workers exposed to uranium in uranium processing industries... studies of Gulf War veterans show that, in those who have retained fragments of depleted uranium following combat related injury, it has been possible to detect elevated urinary uranium levels, but no kidney toxicity or other adverse health effects related to depleted uranium after a decade of follow-up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defence.gov.au/DPE/DHS/infocentre/publications/journals/NoIDs/adfhealth_sept02/ADFHealth_3_2_50-57.pdf Military medical aspects of depleted uranium munitions]&lt;/ref&gt; Pier Roberto Danesi, then-director of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) Seibersdorf +Laboratory, stated in 2002 that &quot;There is a consensus now that DU does not represent a health threat&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[IAEA]] reported in 2003 that, &quot;based on credible scientific evidence, there is no proven link between DU exposure and increases in human cancers or other significant health or environmental impacts,&quot; although &quot;Like other heavy metals, DU is potentially poisonous. In sufficient amounts, if DU is ingested or inhaled it can be harmful because of its chemical toxicity. High concentration could cause kidney damage.&quot; The IAEA concluded that while depleted uranium is a potential [[carcinogen]], there is no evidence that it has been carcinogenic in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A 2005 study by [[Sandia National Laboratory|Sandia National Laboratories’]] Al Marshall used mathematical models to analyze potential health effects associated with accidental exposure to depleted uranium during the 1991 Gulf War. Marshall’s study concluded that the reports of cancer risks from DU exposure are not supported by his analysis nor by veteran medical statistics. Marshall also examined possible genetic effects due to radiation from depleted uranium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandia.gov/news-center/news-releases/2005/def-nonprolif-sec/snl-dusand.pdf An Analysis of Uranium Dispersal and Health Effects Using a Gulf War Case Study], Albert C. Marshall, Sandia National Laboratories&lt;/ref&gt; Chemical effects, including potential reproductive issues, associated with depleted uranium exposure were discussed in some detail in a subsequent journal paper.

===Atmospheric contamination as a result of military actions===
Elevated radiation levels consistent with very low level atmospheric depleted uranium contamination have been found in air samples taken by the UK Atomic Weapons Establishment at several monitoring sites in Britain. These elevated readings appear to coincide with [[Operation Anaconda]] in Afghanistan, and the [[Shock and Awe]] bombing campaign at the start of the Second Gulf War.&lt;ref name=&quot;unidir.org&quot;&gt;http://www.unidir.org/pdf/articles/pdf-art2759.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C. Busby and S. Morgan, 2006, Did the Use of Uranium Weapons in Gulf War 2 Result in Contamination of Europe? Evidence from the Measurements of the Atomic Weapons Establishment, Aldermaston,
Aberystwyth, Green Audit.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other contamination cases===
On October 4, 1992, an [[El Al]] [[Boeing 747|Boeing 747-F]] cargo aircraft [[El Al Flight 1862|Flight 1862]], crashed into an apartment building in [[Amsterdam]]. Local residents and rescue workers complained of various unexplained health issues which were being attributed to the release of hazardous materials during the crash and subsequent fires. Authorities conducted an epidemiological study in 2000 of those believed to be affected by the accident. The study concluded that there was no evidence to link depleted uranium (used as counterbalance weights on the elevators of the plane) to any of the reported health complaints.&lt;ref name=&quot;Uijt de Haag P.A. and Smetsers R.C. and Witlox H.W. and Krus H.W. and Eisenga A.H. 2000&quot;/&gt;

===Safety and environmental issues===
About 95% of the depleted uranium produced till now is stored as [[uranium hexafluoride]], (D)UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, in steel cylinders in open air yards close to enrichment plants. Each cylinder contains up to 12.7 tonnes (or 14 US tons) of UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. In the U.S. alone, 560,000 tonnes of depleted UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; had accumulated by 1993. In 2005, 686,500 tonnes in 57,122 storage cylinders were located near Portsmouth, Ohio, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Paducah, Kentucky. [http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq16.cfm], [http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/documents/index.cfm]  The long-term storage of DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; presents environmental, health, and safety risks because of its chemical instability. When UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is exposed to moist air, it reacts with the water in the air and produces UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (uranyl fluoride) and HF (hydrogen fluoride), both of which are highly soluble and toxic. Storage cylinders must be regularly inspected for signs of corrosion and leaks. The estimated lifetime of the steel cylinders is measured in decades. [http://www.ieer.org/sdafiles/vol_5/5-2/deararj.html]

There have been several accidents involving uranium hexafluoride in the United States. [http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/health/faq30.cfm] The vulnerability of DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; storage cylinders to terrorist attack is apparently not the subject of public reports. However, the U.S. government has been converting DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; to solid uranium oxides for disposal. [http://web.ead.anl.gov/uranium/faq/storage/faq22.cfm] Disposing of the whole DUF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; inventory could cost anywhere from 15 to 450 million dollars.
