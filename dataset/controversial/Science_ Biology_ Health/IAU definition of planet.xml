{{DISPLAYTITLE:IAU definition of ''planet''}}

The '''definition of ''planet''''' set in 2006 by the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) states that, in the [[Solar System]], a [[planet]] is a [[celestial body]] which:
# is in [[orbit]] around the [[Sun]],
# has sufficient mass to assume [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] (a nearly round shape), and
# has &quot;[[Clearing the neighbourhood|cleared the neighbourhood]]&quot; around its orbit.

A non-[[satellite]] body fulfilling only the first two of these criteria is classified as a &quot;[[dwarf planet]]&quot;. According to the IAU, &quot;planets and dwarf planets are two distinct classes of objects&quot;. A non-satellite body fulfilling only the first criterion is termed a &quot;[[small Solar System body]]&quot; (SSSB).  Initial drafts planned to include dwarf planets as a subcategory of planets, but because this could potentially have led to the addition of several dozens of planets into the [[Solar System]], this draft was eventually dropped. The definition was a controversial one and has drawn both support and criticism from different [[astronomers]], but has remained in use.

According to the definition, there are currently [[Planet#Solar System|eight planets]] and [[Dwarf planet#Current members|five dwarf planets]] known in the Solar System.  The definition distinguishes planets from smaller bodies and is not useful outside the Solar System, where smaller bodies cannot be found yet. [[Extrasolar planet]]s, or exoplanets, are covered separately under a complementary 2003 draft guideline for the definition of planets, which distinguishes them from dwarf stars, which are larger.

== Reasons for the debate ==

[[File:Outersolarsystem objectpositions labels comp.png|thumb|400 px|Plot of the positions of all known [[Kuiper belt object]]s (green), set against the outer planets (blue)]]

Before the discoveries of the early 21st century, astronomers had no real need for a formal definition for planets. With the discovery of [[Pluto]] in 1930, astronomers considered the [[Solar System]] to have nine [[planet]]s, along with thousands of smaller bodies such as asteroids and comets. Pluto was thought to be larger than [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]].

In 1978, the discovery of Pluto's moon [[Charon (moon)|Charon]] radically changed this picture. By measuring Charon's orbital period, astronomers could accurately calculate Pluto's mass for the first time, which they found to be much smaller than expected.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/0512491 Orbits and photometry of Pluto's satellites: Charon, S/2005 P1 and S/2005 P2] Eliot F. Young, Leslie A. Young, and S. Alan Stern at Southwest Research Institute, Boulder, Colorado&lt;/ref&gt; Pluto's mass was roughly one twenty-fifth of Mercury's, making it by far the smallest planet, smaller even than the [[Earth]]'s [[Moon]], although it was still over ten times as massive as the largest [[asteroid]], [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]].

In the 1990s, astronomers began finding other objects at least as far away as Pluto, now known as [[Kuiper Belt object]]s, or KBOs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plutopetition.com/unplanet.php Much Ado about Pluto] plutopetition.com&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these shared some of Pluto's key orbital characteristics and are now called [[plutinos]]. Pluto came to be seen as the largest member of a new class of objects, and some astronomers stopped referring to Pluto as a planet.&lt;ref name=plutoplanet&gt;{{cite journal| title=Planetesimals to Brown Dwarfs: What is a Planet?| author = Gibor Basri, Michael E. Brown |publisher = California Institute of Technology| accessdate=2008-08-04| url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/papers/ps/basribrown.pdf|format=PDF| bibcode=2006AREPS..34..193B| last2=Brown| volume=34| year=2006| pages=193| journal=Annual Review of Earth and Planetary Sciences| doi=10.1146/annurev.earth.34.031405.125058|arxiv = astro-ph/0608417 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pluto's eccentric and inclined orbit, while very unusual for a planet in the Solar System, fits in well with the other KBOs. New York City's newly renovated [[Hayden Planetarium]] did not include Pluto in its exhibit of the planets when it reopened as the [[Rose Center for Earth and Space]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/050215_pluto_anniv.html Pluto at 75: Still Crazy After All These Years] Space.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 2000, with the discovery of at least three bodies ([[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]], [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]], and [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]]) all comparable to Pluto in terms of size and [[orbit]], it became clear that either they all had to be called planets or Pluto would have to be reclassified. Astronomers also knew that more objects as large as Pluto would be discovered, and the number of planets would start growing quickly. They were also concerned about the [[classification of planets]] in other [[planetary system]]s. In 2006, the matter came to a head with the measurement of the size of {{mp|2003 UB|313}}. Eris (as it is now known) turned out to be slightly larger than Pluto, and so was thought to be equally deserving of the status of 'planet'.&lt;ref name=plutoplanet/&gt;

=== Historical parallel ===
The refining understanding of Pluto echoed a debate in the 19th century that began with the discovery of [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]] on January 1, 1801.&lt;ref name=plutoplanet/&gt; Astronomers immediately declared the tiny object to be the &quot;missing planet&quot; between Mars and Jupiter. Within four years, however, the discovery of two more objects with comparable sizes and orbits had cast doubt on this new thinking. By 1851, the number of &quot;planets&quot; had grown to 23, and it was clear that hundreds more would eventually be discovered. Astronomers began cataloging them separately and began calling them &quot;[[asteroid]]s&quot; instead of &quot;planets&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Soter, Steven
| title=What Is a Planet? | journal=Scientific American| year=2007| volume=296| issue=1| pages=34–41| url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?chanID=sa006&amp;colID=1&amp;articleID=93385350-E7F2-99DF-3FD6272BB4959038 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0107-34 | pmid=17186831}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The history of the definition ==

Because a new planet is discovered infrequently, the IAU did not have any machinery for their definition and naming.  After the discovery of [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]], it set up a 19-member committee in 2005, with the British astronomer [[Iwan Williams]] in the chair, to consider the definition of a planet.  It proposed three definitions that could be adopted:
;Cultural: a planet is a planet if enough people say it is;
;Structural: a planet is large enough to form a sphere;
;Dynamical: the object is large enough to cause all other objects to eventually leave its orbit.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Eales, ''Prospect'', p.p.31-34 (May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
Another committee, chaired by a historian of astronomy, [[Owen Gingerich]], a historian and astronomer emeritus at [[Harvard University]] who led the committee which generated the original definition, and consisting of five planetary scientists and the science writer [[Dava Sobel]], was set up to make a firm proposal.&lt;ref&gt;Eales, ''op. cit.''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Draft proposal ==
[[File:ThePlanetDefinition.svg|thumb|500px|Illustration of the draft proposal]]
[[File:Three proposed planets.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The original proposal would have immediately added three planets, shown here in a size comparison to Earth. Leftmost is Eris, then Charon, Ceres, and Earth]]

The IAU published the ''original'' definition proposal on August 16, 2006.&lt;ref name=original&gt;{{cite press release| url=http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/release/iau0601/|title=The IAU draft definition of &quot;planet&quot; and &quot;plutons&quot;| publisher=International Astronomical Union |date=2006-08-16|accessdate=2008-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its form followed loosely the second of three options proposed by the original committee. It stated that:&lt;ref name=original/&gt;
{{quote|A planet is a celestial body that (a) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] (nearly round) shape, and (b) is in orbit around a star, and is neither a star nor a satellite of a planet.}}

This definition would have led to three celestial bodies being recognized as planets:
* [[Ceres (dwarf planet)|Ceres]], which had been considered a planet at the time of its discovery, but was subsequently treated as an asteroid
* [[Charon (moon)|Charon]], a moon of Pluto; the Pluto-Charon system would have been considered a [[double planet]]
* [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]], a body in the [[scattered disk]] of the outer Solar System

A further twelve bodies, pending refinements of knowledge regarding their physical properties, were possible candidates to join the list under this definition. Some objects in this second list were more likely eventually to be adopted as 'planets' than others. Despite what had been claimed in the media,&lt;ref name=&quot;boston.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Nine no longer: Panel declares 12 planets|author=Gareth Cook| work=Boston Globe|url=http://www.boston.com/news/science/articles/2006/08/16/nine_no_longer_panel_declares_12_planets/ | accessdate=2006-08-16 | date=2006-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; the proposal did not necessarily leave the Solar System with only twelve planets. [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]], the discoverer of [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]] and Eris, has said that at least 53 known bodies in the Solar System probably fit the definition, and that a complete survey would probably reveal more than 200.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | title=How Many Planets Are There? |author=Mike Brown| work=CalTech|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/whatsaplanet/howmanplanets.html| accessdate=2006-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition would have considered a pair of objects to be a [[double planet]] system if each component independently satisfied the planetary criteria and the common [[center of gravity]] of the system (known as the ''[[Barycentric coordinates (astronomy)|barycenter]]'') was located outside of both bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Space Aug 16&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | title=Nine Planets Become 12 with Controversial New Definition |author=Robert Roy Britt| work=Space.com|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060816_planet_definition.html| accessdate=2006-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pluto]] and Charon would have been the only known double planet in the Solar System. Other planetary satellites (like Earth and its [[moon]]) might be in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]], but would still not have been defined as a component of a double planet, since the barycenter of the system lies within the more massive celestial body (the Earth).  

[[File:0planet-candidates.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The twelve &quot;candidate planets&quot; that were possibilities for inclusion under the originally proposed definition. Note that all but the last three are trans-Neptunian objects. The smallest three (Vesta, Pallas, Hygeia) are in the asteroid belt.]]

The term &quot;minor planet&quot; would have been abandoned, replaced by the categories &quot;[[small Solar System body]]&quot; (SSSB) and a new classification of &quot;pluton&quot;. The former would have described those objects underneath the &quot;spherical&quot; threshold. The latter would have been applied to those planets with highly inclined orbits, large eccentricities and an orbital period of more than 200 earth years (that is, those orbiting beyond Neptune). Pluto would have been the prototype for this class. The term &quot;[[dwarf planet]]&quot; would have been available to describe all planets smaller than the eight &quot;classical planets&quot; in orbit around the Sun, though would not have been an official IAU classification.&lt;ref name=&quot;iau0601_resolution&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | title=Draft Resolution 5 for GA-XXVI: Definition of a Planet| work=International Astronomical Union|url=http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0601/iau0601_resolution.html

Such a redefinition of the term &quot;planet&quot; could also have led to changes in classification for the [[trans-Neptunian object]]s {{dp|Haumea}}, {{dp|Makemake}}, [[90377 Sedna|Sedna]], [[90482 Orcus|Orcus]], [[50000 Quaoar|Quaoar]], [[20000 Varuna|Varuna]], {{mpl-|55636|2002 TX|300}}, [[28978 Ixion|Ixion]], {{mpl-|55565|2002 AW|197}}, and the asteroids [[4 Vesta|Vesta]], [[2 Pallas|Pallas]], and [[10 Hygiea|Hygiea]].

On 18 August the Division of Planetary Sciences of the [[American Astronomical Society]], the world's largest international professional society of planetary scientists, endorsed the draft proposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | url=http://www.spacedaily.com/reports/Planetary_Scientists_Support_Proposed_Redefinition_Of_A_Planet_999.html | title=Planetary Scientists Support Proposed Redefinition Of A Planet
|work=SpaceDaily | accessdate=2006-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the IAU, the roundness condition generally results in the need for a mass of at least 5{{e|20}} kg, or diameter of at least 800&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=&quot;iau0601_resolution&quot;/&gt;{{better source|Source given is draft resolution, which was NOT adopted by the IAU|date=August 2012}} However, [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]] claims that these numbers are only right for rocky bodies like asteroids, and that icy bodies like [[Kuiper Belt]] objects reach hydrostatic equilibrium at much smaller sizes, probably somewhere between 200 and 400&amp;nbsp;km in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/whatsaplanet/howmanplanets.html | title=New Planets | author=Mike Brown | accessdate=2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It all depends on the rigidity of the material that makes up the body, which is in turn strongly influenced by its internal temperature.

=== Advantages ===
The proposed definition found support among many astronomers as it used the presence of a physical qualitative factor (the object being round) as its defining feature. Most other potential definitions depended on a limiting quantity (e.g., a minimum size or maximum [[orbital inclination]]) tailored for the Solar System. According to members of the IAU committee this definition did not use man-made limits but instead deferred to &quot;nature&quot; in deciding whether or not an object was a planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060816_planet_definition.html | title=Nine Planets Become 12 with Controversial New Definition | author=Robert Roy Britt
| work=Space.com | accessdate=2006-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also had the advantage of measuring an observable quality. Suggested criteria involving the nature of formation would have been more likely to see accepted planets later declassified as scientific understanding improved.

Additionally, the definition kept Pluto as a planet. Pluto's planetary status was and is fondly thought of by many, and the general public could have been alienated from professional astronomers; there was considerable uproar when the media last suggested, in 1999, that Pluto might be demoted, which was a misunderstanding of a proposal to catalog all [[trans-Neptunian object]]s uniformly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0776605.html | title=The Flap over Pluto | author = Pearson education | work=infoplease.com | accessdate=2006-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of proposal ===
[[File:Pluto Protest and Counter Protest.jpg|thumb|300 px|Protesters campaigning against the &quot;demotion&quot; of Pluto]]

The proposed redefinition was criticised as ambiguous: Astronomer [[Phil Plait]] and [[National Center for Science Education|NCSE]] writer [[Nick Matzke]] both wrote about why they thought the redefinition was not, in general, a good one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2006/08/15/congratulations-its-a-planet/ | title=Congratulations! It's a planet! | author=Phil Plait | work=Bad Astronomy | accessdate=2006-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | url=http://www.pandasthumb.org/archives/2006/08/wherein_i_argue.html | title=Wherein I argue emotionally about the definition of &quot;planet&quot;| author=[[Nick Matzke]] | work=[[The Panda's Thumb (blog)|The Panda's Thumb]] | accessdate=2006-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It defined a planet as orbiting a star, which would have meant that any planet ejected from its star system or formed outside of one (a [[rogue planet]]) could not have been called a planet, even if it fit all other definitions. A similar situation already applied to the term 'moon', such bodies ceasing to be moons on being ejected from planetary orbit; this usage had widespread acceptance. Similarly, the redefinition did not differentiate between planets and [[brown dwarf]] stars. Any attempt to clarify this differentiation was to be left until a later date.

There had also been criticism of the definition of [[double planet]]: at present the Moon is defined as a satellite of the Earth, but over time the Earth-Moon [[barycenter]] will drift outwards (see [[tidal acceleration]]) and could eventually become situated outside of both bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Space 18 March 2003&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year=2006 | title=Moon Mechanics: What Really Makes Our World Go 'Round  |author=Robert Roy Britt| work=Space.com|url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/moon_mechanics_0303018.html| accessdate=2010-08-24| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100822072302/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/moon_mechanics_0303018.html &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;| archivedate=2010-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; This development would then upgrade the Moon to planetary status at that time, according to the redefinition. The time taken for this to occur, however, would be billions of years, long after many astronomers expect the Sun to expand into a [[red giant]] and destroy both Earth and Moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| year=2006 | author=Robert Roy Britt| title= Earth's moon could become a planet| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2006/TECH/space/08/18/moon.planet/ | work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an 18 August 2006 [[Science Friday]] interview, Mike Brown expressed doubt that a scientific definition was even necessary. He stated, &quot;The analogy that I always like to use is the word &quot;[[continent]]&quot;. You know, the word &quot;continent&quot; has no scientific definition ... they're just cultural definitions, and I think the geologists are wise to leave that one alone and not try to redefine things so that the word &quot;continent&quot; has a big, strict definition.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=[[Ira Flatow]] and [[Michael E. Brown|Mike Brown]] |title=Pluto's Planet Status / String Theory |date=2006-08-18 |work=[[Science Friday]] |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |url=http://www.sciencefriday.com/pages/2006/Aug/hour2_081806.html |accessdate=2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 August, [[Owen Gingerich]] said that correspondence he had received had been evenly divided for and against the proposal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britt 2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web| first=Robert Roy| last= Britt| url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060818_planet_newprop.html| title=Pluto May Get Demoted After All| publisher=Space.com| date=2006-08-18| accessdate=2006-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative proposal ==
According to [[Alan Boss]] of the [[Carnegie Institution of Washington]], a subgroup of the IAU met on August 18, 2006 and held a [[straw poll]] on the draft proposal: only 18 were in favour of it, with over 50 against. The 50 in opposition preferred an alternative proposal drawn up by [[Uruguay]]an astronomer [[Julio Ángel Fernández]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Britt 2006&quot;/&gt;

{{cquote|(1) A planet is a celestial body that (a) is by far the largest object in its local population[1], (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] (nearly round) shape [2], (c) does not produce energy by any [[nuclear fusion]] mechanism [3].

(2) According to point (1) the eight classical planets discovered before 1900, which move in nearly circular orbits close to the ecliptic plane are the only planets of the Solar System. All the other objects in orbit around the Sun are smaller than Mercury. We recognize that there are objects that fulfill the criteria (b) and (c) but not criterion (a). Those objects are defined as &quot;dwarf&quot; planets. Ceres as well as Pluto and several other large Trans-Neptunian objects belong to this category. In contrast to the planets, these objects typically have highly inclined orbits and/or large eccentricities.

(3) All the other natural objects orbiting the Sun that do not fulfill any of the previous criteria shall be referred to collectively as &quot;[[Small Solar System Bodies]]&quot;.[4]&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot; name=&quot;IAU&quot;&gt;The use of [[title case]] for &quot;Small Solar System Bodies&quot; and &quot;Trans-Neptunian Objects&quot; by the IAU in this statement is not formally correct, since these terms are not [[proper nouns]], and appears to be related to the existence of [[acronym]]s for these terms.&lt;/ref&gt;

; Definitions and clarifications:

# The local population is the collection of objects that cross or closely approach the orbit of the body in consideration.
# This generally applies to objects with sizes above several hundred kilometers, depending on the material strength.
# This criterion allows the distinction between gas giant planets and brown dwarfs or stars.
# This class currently includes most of the Solar System asteroids, [[Near-Earth object]]s (NEOs), Mars-, Jupiter- and Neptune-Trojan asteroids, most [[Centaur (planetoid)|Centaurs]], most [[Trans-Neptunian Objects]] (TNOs), and [[comet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=2006 | title= Details Emerge on Plan to Demote Pluto | accessdate= 2006-08-18 | url= http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/060819_new_proposal.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Under the alternative proposal the current Solar System would have remained unchanged, but Pluto would have been demoted to a [[dwarf planet]].

== Revised draft proposal ==
On 22 August the draft proposal was rewritten with two changes from the previous draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuffner-sternwarte.at/im_brennp/archiv2006/Planeten_Definition_Resolution_5_6_7.html |title = The IAU Committee Presents Today in Prague the new Proposals for the Definition of Planet | author=Günther Wuchterl |date=2006-08-22  |accessdate= 2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kuffner-sternwarte.at/im_brennp/archiv2006/Planeten_Definition_Resolution_c.html|title=The IAU's Definition of Planet develops further - Draft c |date=2006-08-23|author=Günther Wuchterl |accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first was a generalisation of the name of the new class of planets (previously the draft resolution had explicitly opted for the term 'pluton'), with a decision on the name to be used postponed.  Many geologists had been critical of the choice of name for Pluto-like planets,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=2006 | title=Star-gazers puzzled by Pluto | accessdate= 2006-08-18 | work= Independent Online | url= http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=31&amp;art_id=qw1155925441701B222 }}&lt;/ref&gt; being concerned about the term [[pluton]] which has been used for years within the geological community to represent a form of magmatic [[intrusion]]; such formations are fairly common balls of rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=2006 | title= Geologists Force Astronomers To Rethink Pluto Plan | accessdate= 2006-08-18 | url= http://www.playfuls.com/news_001938_Geologists_Force_Astronomers_To_Rethink_Pluto_Plan.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| year=2006 | title= Planet, pluton or rock? | accessdate= 2006-08-20 | url= http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_4210195 | author = Elise Kleeman | work= Pasadena Star News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confusion was thought undesirable due to the status of planetology as a field closely allied to geology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nature.com/news/2006/060821/full/060821-4.html | title= Plutons, planets and dwarves : Geologists and astronomers wrangle over words. | work= news@nature.com | author= Geoff Brumfiel | date= 2006-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further concerns surrounded use of the word ''pluton'' as in major languages such as [[French language|French]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]], Pluto is itself called ''Pluton'', potentially adding to confusion.

The second change was a redrawing of the planetary definition in the case of a double planet system.  There had been a concern that, in extreme cases where a double body had its secondary component in a highly eccentric orbit, there could have been a drift of the barycenter in and out of the primary body, leading to a shift in the classification of the secondary body between [[satellite]] and planet depending on where the system was in its orbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| accessdate = 2008-08-04| title=Congratulations! It's a planet! |author = Phil Plait| date = 2006-08-15 | format = blog | url=http://blogs.discovermagazine.com/badastronomy/2006/08/15/congratulations-its-a-planet/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the definition was reformulated so as to consider a double planet system in existence if its barycenter lay outside both bodies for a majority of the system's orbital period.

Later on August 22, two open meetings were held which ended in an abrupt about-face on the basic planetary definition. The position of astronomer [[Julio Ángel Fernández]] gained the upper hand among the members attending and was described as unlikely to lose its hold by August 24. This position would result in only eight major planets, with Pluto ranking as a &quot;dwarf planet&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/22/science/space/22cnd-pluto.html |title=Pluto Seems Poised to Lose Its Planet Status|date=2006-08-22|publisher=New York Times|first=Dennis|last=Overbye}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion at the first meeting was heated and lively, with IAU members in vocal disagreement with one another over such issues as the relative merits of [[statics|static]] and [[Dynamics (mechanics)|dynamic]] physics; the main sticking point was whether or not to include a body's orbital characteristics among the definition criteria.  In an indicative vote members heavily defeated the proposals on Pluto-like objects and double planet systems, and were evenly divided on the question of hydrostatic equilibrium.  The debate was said to be &quot;still open&quot;, with private meetings being held ahead of a vote scheduled for the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://science.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1193282.php/Astronomers_divided_over_planet_definition|title=Astronomers divided over 'planet' definition|date=2006-08-22|publisher=Deutsche Presse-Agentur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the second meeting of the day, following 'secret' negotiations, a compromise began to emerge after the Executive Committee moved explicitly to exclude consideration of [[extra-solar planets]] and to bring into the definition a criterion concerning the dominance of a body in its neighbourhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://skytonight.com/news/home/3707031.html|title=The Day We Lost Pluto|date=2006-08-22|publisher=Sky &amp; Telescope|first=Richard|last=Tresch Fienberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final draft proposal ==

The final, third draft definition proposed on 24 August was:

{{cquote|The IAU...resolves that planets and other bodies in the Solar System be defined into three distinct categories in the following way:
(1) A planet [1] is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit.

(2) A &quot;dwarf planet&quot; is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape [2], (c) has not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit, and (d) is not a satellite.

(3) All other objects [3] orbiting the Sun shall be referred to collectively as &quot;Small Solar System Bodies&quot;.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot; name=&quot;IAU&quot;/&gt;

[1] The eight planets are: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.

[2] An IAU process will be established to assign borderline objects into either dwarf planet and other categories.

[3] These currently include most of the Solar System asteroids, most Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), comets, and other small bodies.}}

[[File:The Planets Definition 2.svg|thumb|500px|right|Illustration of the final proposal]]

&lt;!-- What exactly it meant to say that a body had &quot;[[[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki/cleared%20the%20neighbourhood cleared the neighbourhood]]] around its orbit&quot; or that it had a &quot;nearly round&quot; shape was explicitly not defined. These descriptions were used partly to allow for some &quot;[[[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki/common%20sense common sense]]]&quot; judgement, but primarily to provide language that could readily be used in communicating the definitions to lay audiences.{{[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/wiki/Template:Fact Fact|date=August 2008]}} --&gt;

=== Plenary session debate ===

Voting on the definition took place at the Assembly plenary session during the afternoon.  Following a reversion to the previous rules on 15 August, as a planetary definition is a primarily scientific matter every individual member of the Union attending the Assembly was eligible to vote. The number having registered their attendance at the Assembly at the time of the vote stood at 2411,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astronomy2006.com/ IAU General Assembly Welcome page] 24 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; but out of the over a thousand who attended the session only 424 members chose to vote or indicate their abstention on Resolution 6A (below).&lt;ref name=&quot;plutovote&quot;/&gt;

The IAU Executive Committee presented four Resolutions to the Assembly, each concerning a different aspect of the debate over the definition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://astro.cas.cz/nuncius/nsiii_09.pdf IAU General Assembly Newspaper, 24 August 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Minor amendments were made on the floor for the purposes of clarification.

* ''Resolution 5A'' constituted the definition itself as stated above.  There was much discussion among members about the appropriateness of using the expression &quot;cleared the neighbourhood&quot; instead of the earlier reference to &quot;dominant body&quot;, and about the implications of the definition for [[satellites]].  The Resolution was ultimately approved by a near-unanimous vote.

* ''Resolution 5B'' sought to amend the above definition by the insertion of the word ''classical'' before the word ''planet'' in paragraph (1) and footnote [1].  This represented a choice between having a set of three distinct categories of body (planet, &quot;dwarf planet&quot; and SSSB) and the opening of an umbrella of 'planets' over the first two such categories.  The Resolution proposed the latter option; it was defeated convincingly, with only 91 members voting in its favour.

* ''Resolution 6A'' proposed a statement concerning Pluto: &quot;Pluto is a dwarf planet by the above definition and is recognized as the prototype of a new category of trans-Neptunian objects.&quot;  After a little quibbling over the grammar involved and questions of exactly what constituted a &quot;trans-Neptunian object&quot;, the Resolution was approved by a vote of 237–157, with 30 people indicating their abstention.  A new category of dwarf planet was thus established.  It would be named &quot;[[plutoid]]&quot; and more narrowly defined by the IAU Executive Committee on 11 June 2008.

* ''Resolution 6B'' sought to insert an additional sentence at the end of the statement in 6A: &quot;This category is to be called 'plutonian objects'.&quot;  There was no debate on the question, and in the vote the proposed name was defeated by 186–183; a proposal to conduct a re-vote was rejected.  An IAU process will be put in motion to determine the name for the new category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iau.org/iau0603.414.0.html |title=IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU Resolution votes|work=IAU|year=2006|accessdate=2007-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a literal reading of the Resolution, &quot;dwarf planets&quot; are by implication of paragraph (1) excluded from the status of 'planet'.  Use of the word ''planet'' in their title may, however, cause some ambiguity.

== Final definition ==
The final definition, as passed on 24 August 2006 under the Resolution 5A of the 26th General Assembly is:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iau.org/static/resolutions/Resolution_GA26-5-6.pdf|title=IAU 2006 General Assembly: Resolutions 5 and 6|date=2006-08-24|publisher=IAU|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release| title = IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU Resolution votes| url=http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/release/iau0603/ | publisher= IAU (News Release - IAU0603)|date=August 24, 2006, Prague|accessdate=2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|[[File:ThePlanetDefinition3.png|thumb|500px|right|Illustration of the outcome of the vote]]
The IAU...resolves that planets and other bodies, except satellites, in the [[Solar System]] be defined into three distinct categories in the following way:''

(1) A [[planet]] [1] is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] (nearly round) shape, and (c) has [[cleared the neighbourhood]] around its orbit.

(2) A &quot;[[dwarf planet]]&quot; is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape [2], (c) has not cleared the neighbourhood around its orbit, and (d) is not a [[Natural satellite|satellite]].

(3) All other objects [3], except satellites, orbiting the Sun shall be referred to collectively as &quot;[[Small solar system body|Small Solar System Bodies]]&quot;.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot; name=&quot;IAU&quot;/&gt;

Footnotes:

''[1] The [[Planet#Solar System|eight planets]] are: [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]], and [[Neptune]].''&lt;br /&gt;
''[2] An IAU process will be established to assign borderline objects into either dwarf planet and other categories.''&lt;br /&gt;
''[3] These currently include most of the Solar System asteroids, most Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs), comets, and other small bodies.''}}

The IAU further resolves:

{{cquote|[[Pluto]] is a &quot;dwarf planet&quot; by the above definition and is recognized as the prototype of a new category of [[Trans-Neptunian Objects]][1].

Footnote:

''[1] An IAU process will be established to select a name for this category.''}}

The IAU also resolved that &quot;''planets'' and ''dwarf planets'' are two distinct classes of objects&quot;, meaning that dwarf planets, despite their name, would not be considered planets.&lt;ref name=IAU0603&gt;{{cite press release

== Criticism ==

=== Substance ===
There continues to be criticism regarding the wording of the final draft of the definition.  Notably, the lead scientist on [[New Horizons|NASA's robotic mission to Pluto]], [[Alan Stern]], contends that, like Pluto, Earth, [[Mars]], [[Jupiter]] and [[Neptune]] have not fully cleared their orbital zones either. Earth orbits with 10,000 [[near-Earth object|near-Earth asteroids]]. Jupiter, meanwhile, is accompanied by 100,000 Trojan asteroids on its orbital path. &quot;If Neptune had cleared its zone, Pluto wouldn't be there&quot;, he added.&lt;ref name=&quot;plutovote&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5283956.stm| title=Pluto vote 'hijacked' in revolt|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-08-01|author=Paul Rincon|date=2006-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mike Brown counters this opinion by saying that, far from not having cleared their orbits, the major planets completely control the orbits of the other bodies within their orbital zone. Jupiter may coexist with a large number of small bodies in its orbit (the [[Trojan asteroid]]s), but these bodies only exist in Jupiter's orbit because they are in the sway of the planet's huge gravity. Similarly, Pluto may cross the orbit of Neptune, but Neptune long ago locked Pluto and its attendant Kuiper belt objects, called [[plutino]]s, into a 3:2 resonance, i.e., they orbit the Sun twice for every three Neptune orbits. The orbits of these objects are entirely dictated by Neptune's gravity, and thus, Neptune is gravitationally dominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Eight Planets|author=Michael E. Brown|work=Caltech|url=http://www.gps.caltech.edu/~mbrown/eightplanets/|year=2006| accessdate=2007-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition may be difficult to apply outside the Solar System.  Techniques for identifying extrasolar objects generally cannot determine if an object has &quot;cleared its orbit&quot;, except indirectly via Stern and Levison's Λ parameter, and provide limited information about when the objects were formed.  The wording of the new definition is [[heliocentric]] in its use of the word ''[[Sun]]'' instead of ''[[star]] or [[Binary star|stars]]'', and is thus not applicable to the numerous [[Extra-solar planets|objects]] that have been identified in orbit around other stars. However, a separate &quot;working&quot; definition for extrasolar planets was established by the IAU in 2001 and includes the criterion &quot;the minimum mass/size required for an extrasolar object to be considered a planet should be the same as that used in the Solar System.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.dtm.ciw.edu/boss/definition.html| work=Working Group on Extrasolar Planets (IAU)|title =Position statement on the Definition of a &quot;Planet&quot;| accessdate=2008-08-04 | date =2003-02-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Process ===
The final vote has come under much criticism because of the relatively small percentage of the 9000-strong membership who participated. Besides the fact that most members do not attend the General Assemblies, this lack was also due to the timing of the vote: the final vote was taken on the last day of the 10-day event, after many participants had left or were preparing to leave. Of over 2,700 astronomers attending the conference, only 424 votes were cast, which is less than 5% of the entire community of astronomers.&lt;ref name=&quot;plutovote&quot;/&gt; There is also the issue of the many astronomers who were unable or who chose not to make the trip to [[Prague]] and, thus, cast no vote. Astronomer Marla Geha has clarified that not all members of the Union were needed to vote on the classification issue: only those whose work is directly related to planetary studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;marlageha&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.thenation.com/doc/20060925/pluto| title=A Passion For Pluto| accessdate=2006-09-13| publisher=thenation.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
It is expected that the decision will have cultural and societal implications. It will affect the &quot;industry of astronomical artifacts and toys.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/24/science/space/25pluto.html?_r=1&amp;ei=5070&amp;en=386a070cf318003c&amp;ex=1156651200&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;oref=slogin&amp;adxnnlx=1156726801-q8exJblHyCMw948iShQaRw| title=Pluto is demoted to ‘dwarf planet’| author=Dennis Overbye| work=NYTimes| date=2006-08-24| accessdate=2006-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educational books need to be revised. The decision was important enough to prompt the editors of the 2007 edition of the ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]'' to hold off printing until a final result had been reached.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;/&gt; The new designation also has repercussions in the [[astrology|astrological]] world and finds mixed receptions, with differences of opinion as to whether to make any changes to astrological practice as a result of the redefinition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Astro&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.planetwaves.net/contents/wsj.html| author=Jane Spencer| date=2006-08-25| accessdate=2006-08-27| work=Wall Street Journal| title= Pluto's demotion divides astrologers, troubles Scorpios}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Popular culture ===
The impact of the revised definition, particularly the change in the status of Pluto, has been reflected in popular culture.  A number of musical contributions have commemorated the change:
* &quot;Planet X&quot; (1996), song by [[Christine Lavin]]. A good-natured protest against suggestions that Pluto is not a planet.
* &quot;Pluto&quot; (1998), song by [[2 Skinnee J's]]. An impassioned defense of Pluto's status as a planet.
* ''Thing a Week'', August 25, 2006 podcast by [[Jonathan Coulton]]. Featured a song &quot;I'm Your Moon&quot;, from Charon's point of view, about Pluto being reclassified as a dwarf planet.
* &quot;Bring Back Pluto&quot; (2007), song by [[Aesop Rock]] on the album ''[[None Shall Pass]]''. Hip-hop song supporting Pluto's status as the 9th planet in the Solar System.
* &quot;Pluto&quot; (2009), song by [[Robbie Fulks]], part of his release &quot;50-vc. Doberman.&quot;  About Pluto's reclassification, remembered as a 9th planet from the times of the singer's youth, and re-presents Pluto as an unforgotten monarch of the [[Kuiper Belt]].

===Plutoed===
The verb ''to pluto'' ([[preterite]] and [[participle|past participle]]: ''plutoed'') was [[neologism|coined]] in the aftermath of the 2006 IAU decision. In January 2007, the [[American Dialect Society]] chose ''plutoed'' as its 2006 [[Word of the Year]], defining ''to pluto'' as &quot;to demote or devalue someone or something, as happened to the former planet Pluto when the General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union decided Pluto no longer met its definition of a planet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.americandialect.org/Word-of-the-Year_2006.pdf|title= &quot;Plutoed&quot; Voted 2006 Word of the Year| date=January 5, 2007| publisher=American Dialect Society| accessdate=2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/US/01/07/word.of.the.year/index.html|title=Pluto's revenge: 'Word of the Year' award|accessdate=2007-01-20|publisher=CNN|date=January 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Society president Cleveland Evans stated the reason for the organization's selection of ''plutoed'': &quot;Our members believe the great emotional reaction of the public to the demotion of Pluto shows the importance of Pluto as a name. We may no longer believe in the [[Pluto (mythology)|Roman god Pluto]], but we still have a sense of connection with the former planet.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16529756|title='Plutoed' chosen as '06 Word of the Year|accessdate=2007-01-10|agency=Associated Press|year=Jan. 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== New dwarf planet subclass ==
On June 11, 2008, the IAU announced that the sub-category of dwarf planets with trans-Neptunian orbits would be known as &quot;[[plutoid]]s&quot;. In an accompanying press release, the IAU said that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|date=2008-06-11|location=Paris|title=Plutoid chosen as name for Solar System objects like Pluto|publisher=International Astronomical Union (News Release - IAU0804)|url=http://www.iau.org/public_press/news/release/iau0804|accessdate=2008-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|Plutoids are celestial bodies in orbit around the [[Sun]] at a distance greater than that of [[Neptune]] that have sufficient mass for their self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that they assume a [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] (near-spherical) shape, and that have not [[clearing the neighbourhood|cleared the neighbourhood]] around their orbit.}}

This sub-category includes [[Pluto]], [[Haumea (dwarf planet)|Haumea]], [[Makemake (dwarf planet)|Makemake]] and [[Eris (dwarf planet)|Eris]].
