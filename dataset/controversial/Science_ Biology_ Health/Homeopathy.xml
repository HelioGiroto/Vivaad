'''Homeopathy''' {{IPAc-en|audio=En-uk-homeopathy.ogg|ˌ|h|oʊ|m|i|ˈ|ɒ|p|ə|θ|i}} (also spelled '''homoeopathy''' or '''homœopathy'''; from the Greek ''hómoios-'' {{lang|el|ὅμοιος}}- &quot;like-&quot; + ''páthos'' {{lang|el|πάθος}} &quot;suffering&quot;) is a system of [[alternative medicine]] originated in 1796 by [[Samuel Hahnemann]], based on the doctrine of ''[[similia similibus curentur]]'' (&quot;like cures like&quot;), according to which a substance that causes the symptoms of a disease in healthy people will cure that disease in sick people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hahnemann&quot;/&gt; Scientific research has found homeopathic remedies ineffective and their postulated mechanisms of action implausible.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12492603&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last1=Ernst |first1=E. |title=A systematic review of systematic reviews of homeopathy |journal=British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology |volume=54 |issue=6 |pages=577–82 |year=2002 |pmid=12492603 |pmc=1874503 |doi=10.1046/j.1365-2125.2002.01699.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inquiry_cfm&gt;UK Parliamentary Committee Science and Technology Committee - [http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/science-and-technology-committee/inquiries/homeopathy-/ &quot;Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;shang&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nih overview&quot;&gt;http://nccam.nih.gov/health/homeopathy &quot;Homeopathy: An Introduction&quot; a  NCAAM webpage&lt;/ref&gt; Within the [[medicine|medical community]] homeopathy is generally considered [[quackery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17719708&quot;/&gt;

The low concentrations of homeopathic remedies, often lacking even a single [[molecule]] of the diluted substance,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst2005&quot;/&gt; lead to an objection that has dogged homeopathy since the 19th century: how, then, can the substance have any effect? Modern advocates of homeopathy have suggested that &quot;[[water memory|water has a memory]]&quot;—that during mixing and succussion, the substance leaves an enduring effect on the water, perhaps a &quot;vibration&quot;, and this produces an effect on the patient. However, nothing like water memory has ever been found in chemistry or physics.&lt;ref name=NatureWhenToBelieve&gt;{{Citation |title=When to believe the unbelievable |journal=Nature |volume=333 |issue=6176 |page=787 |year=1988 |pmid=3386722 |doi=10.1038/333787a0|bibcode = 1988Natur.333Q.787. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;delusion&quot;/&gt; [[Pharmacological]] research has found, contrary to homeopathy, that stronger effects of an active ingredient come from [[dose-response relationship|higher doses]], not lower doses.

Homeopathy is a [[vitalism|vitalist]] philosophy that interprets diseases and sickness as caused by disturbances in an immaterial [[vital force]] or [[spiritual energy|life force]]. 
Disturbances are believed to manifest themselves first in mental symptoms, and eventually progress to physical disease if untreated. Homeopathy rejects [[germ theory]], viewing the presence of pathogens as a symptom, rather than cause, of disease.

Homeopathy maintains that the vital force has the ability to react and adapt to internal and external causes, which homeopaths refer to as the &quot;law of susceptibility&quot; (as with the &quot;law of similars&quot; this is a [[term of art]] and not a [[natural law]], and it lacks significant scientific acceptance). 

The law of susceptibility implies that a negative state of mind can attract hypothetical disease entities called &quot;miasms&quot; to invade the body and produce symptoms of diseases.&lt;ref&gt;

}}{{Page needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hahnemann proposed homeopathy in reaction to the state of [[History of medicine|traditional Western medicine]] at that time, which often was brutal and more harmful than helpful. 
Hahnemann coined the expression &quot;[[allopathic medicine]]&quot;, which was used to pejoratively refer to traditional Western medicine.&lt;ref name=Whorton2004&gt;{{Citation|title = Nature Cures: The History of Alternative Medicine in America|author=Whorton JC|publisher=[[Oxford University Press US]]|year=2004|isbn=0-19-517162-4|pages = 18, 52|url=http://books.google.com/?id=RU0DndWVSPoC&amp;pg=PA18|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law of similars===
Hahnemann observed from his experiments with [[cinchona]] bark, used as a treatment for [[malaria]], that the effects he experienced from ingesting the bark were similar to the symptoms of malaria.
He therefore decided cure proceeds through similarity, and treatments must be able to produce symptoms in healthy individuals similar to those of the disease being treated.&lt;ref name=&quot;homhist1&quot;/&gt; Through further experiments with other substances, Hahnemann conceived of the &quot;law of similars&quot;, otherwise known as &quot;let like be cured by like&quot; ({{lang-la|[[similia similibus curentur]]}})&lt;ref&gt;With ''curentur'', the phrase is in the [[subjunctive]], and is the form given by Hahnemann and officially used in homeopathy. 
The similar phrase {{lang-la|similia similibus curantur}} is in the indicative, translated as &quot;like cures like&quot;, and was used by [[Paracelsus]] in the 16th century.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1911 Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; as a fundamental healing principle. 
He believed that by using drugs to induce symptoms, the artificial symptoms would stimulate the vital force, causing it to neutralise and expel the original disease and that this artificial disturbance would naturally subside when the dosing ceased.&lt;ref name=&quot;homhist1&quot;/&gt; It is based on the belief that a substance that in large doses will produce symptoms of a specific disease will, in extremely small doses, cure it.

Hahnemann's law of similars is an ''[[ipse dixit]]'' [[axiom]],&lt;ref name=Renouard&gt;{{citation |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Qy4AAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA580 |title=History of Medicine, From Its Origins to the Nineteenth Century |author=Renouard PV, Comegys CG, Jewell W, Friedberg SA |location=Cincinnati |publisher=Moore, Wilstach, Keys &amp; Co. |year=1856 |oclc=14846134 |page=580}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other words an unproven assertion made by Hahnemann, and not a true [[natural law|law of nature]].&lt;ref name=Kirk&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=BygxAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA1031&amp;lpg=PA1031&amp;dq=%22law+of+similars%22+axiom+%22not+a+law%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=8tRZ1Vveex&amp;sig=AZXZoUCNpFR6vgrtiPU0HYl6D24&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=1ci3S62MDpSuswOO65XpDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22law%20of%20similars%22%20axiom%20%22not%20a%20law%22&amp;f=false The Dental Cosmos: A Monthly Record of Dental Science], Editor Edward C. Kirk, D.D.S., Vol. XXXVI, p. 1031-1032&lt;/ref&gt;

===Miasms and disease===
In 1828, Hahnemann introduced the concept of &quot;miasms&quot;; underlying causes for many known diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hahnemann_Chronic&quot;&gt;
{{citation

A miasm is often defined by homeopaths as an imputed &quot;peculiar morbid derangement of [the] vital force&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Organon_5th_29&quot;&gt;

}}{{Page needed|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Hahnemann associated each miasm with specific diseases, with each miasm seen as the root cause of several diseases. 
According to Hahnemann, initial exposure to miasms causes local symptoms, such as skin or venereal diseases, but if these symptoms are suppressed by medication, the cause goes deeper and begins to manifest itself as diseases of the internal organs.&lt;ref name=&quot;miasms&quot;/&gt; 
Homeopathy maintains that treating diseases by directly opposing their symptoms, as is sometimes done in conventional medicine, is ineffective because all &quot;disease can generally be traced to some latent, deep-seated, underlying chronic, or inherited tendency&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

Hahnemann originally presented only three miasms, of which the most important was ''psora'' (Greek for &quot;itch&quot;), described as being related to any itching diseases of the skin, supposed to be derived from suppressed [[scabies]], and claimed to be the foundation of many further disease conditions. 
Hahnemann believed psora to be the cause of such diseases as [[epilepsy]], [[cancer]], [[jaundice]], [[deafness]], and [[cataracts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hahnemann_Chronic&quot;/&gt; 
Since Hahnemann's time, other miasms have been proposed, some replacing one or more of psora's proposed functions, including [[tuberculosis]] and [[cancer]] miasms.&lt;ref name=miasms&gt;

Hahnemann's miasm theory remains disputed and controversial within homeopathy even in modern times. In 1978, [[Anthony Campbell (physician)|Anthony Campbell]], then a consultant physician at the Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, criticised statements by [[George Vithoulkas]] claiming that [[syphilis]], when treated with antibiotics, would develop into secondary and tertiary syphilis with involvement of the central nervous system. 
This conflicts with scientific studies, which indicated [[penicillin]] treatment produces a complete cure of syphilis in more than 90% of cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birnbaum&quot;&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Campbell described this as &quot;a thoroughly irresponsible statement that could mislead an unfortunate layman into refusing orthodox treatment&quot;.

The theory of miasms has been criticized as an explanation developed by Hahnemann to preserve the system of homeopathy in the face of treatment failures, and for being inadequate to cover the many hundreds of sorts of diseases, as well as for failing to explain disease predispositions, as well as [[genetics]], environmental factors, and the unique disease history of each patient.&lt;ref name=Shelton&gt;{{citation |author=Shelton, Jay W. |year=2004 |title=Homeopathy: How it Really Works |location=Amherst, New York |publisher=[[Prometheus Books]] |isbn=978-1-59102-109-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|148-9}}

==Remedies==

[[File:Rhustox.jpg|thumb|Homeopathic remedy ''Rhus toxicodendron'', derived from [[Toxicodendron radicans|poison ivy]].]]

Homeopathic practitioners rely on two types of reference when prescribing remedies: ''[[materia medica]]'' and repertories. A homeopathic ''materia medica'' is a collection of &quot;drug pictures&quot;, organised alphabetically by “remedy,” that describes the symptom patterns associated with individual remedies. A homeopathic repertory is an index of disease symptoms that lists remedies associated with specific symptoms.&lt;ref name=elixris&gt;&lt;!-- replace this by something less commercial! --&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeopathy uses many animal, plant, mineral, and synthetic substances in its remedies. 
Examples include ''[[arsenicum album]]'' (arsenic oxide), ''natrum muriaticum'' ([[sodium chloride]] or table salt), ''[[Lachesis muta]]'' (the venom of the [[Lachesis (genus)|bushmaster snake]]), ''[[opium]]'', and ''thyroidinum'' ([[thyroid hormone]]). 
Homeopaths also use treatments called &quot;nosodes&quot; (from the Greek ''nosos'', disease) made from diseased or pathological products such as fecal, urinary, and respiratory discharges, blood, and tissue.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16322800&quot;/&gt; Homeopathic remedies prepared from healthy specimens are called &quot;sarcodes&quot;.

Some modern homeopaths have considered more esoteric bases for remedies, known as &quot;imponderables&quot; because they do not originate from a substance, but from [[electromagnetic energy]] presumed to have been &quot;captured&quot; by alcohol or [[lactose]].&lt;!--See next two sources, and the rest of the journal issue they came from for more information--&gt; Examples include [[X-ray]]s&lt;ref&gt;

Today, about 3,000 different remedies are commonly used in homeopathy.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}
Some homeopaths also use techniques that are regarded by other practitioners as controversial. 
These include &quot;paper remedies&quot;, where the substance and dilution are written on pieces of paper and either pinned to the patients' clothing, put in their pockets, or placed under glasses of water that are then given to the patients, as well as the use of [[radionics]] to prepare remedies. 
Such practices have been strongly criticised by classical homeopaths as unfounded, speculative, and verging upon magic and superstition.&lt;ref&gt;

===Preparation===
[[File:Mortar2.jpg|thumb|[[Mortar and pestle]] used for grinding insoluble solids, including quartz and oyster shells, into homeopathic remedies]]

In producing remedies for diseases, homeopaths use a process called &quot;dynamisation&quot; or &quot;potentisation&quot;, whereby a substance is diluted with alcohol or [[distilled water]] and then vigorously shaken by 10 hard strikes against an elastic body in a process homeopaths call &quot;succussion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hahnemann advocated using substances that produce symptoms like those of the disease being treated, but found that undiluted doses intensified the symptoms and exacerbated the condition, sometimes causing dangerous toxic reactions. He therefore specified that the substances be diluted, due to his belief that succussion activated the &quot;vital energy&quot; of the diluted substance&lt;ref&gt;

===Dilutions===
{{Main|Homeopathic dilutions}}

Three [[logarithm]]ic potency scales are in regular use in homeopathy. Hahnemann created the &quot;centesimal&quot; or &quot;C scale&quot;, diluting a substance by a factor of 100 at each stage. The centesimal scale was favored by Hahnemann for most of his life. 
A 2C dilution requires a substance to be diluted to one part in 100, and then some of that diluted solution diluted by a further factor of 100. 
This works out to one part of the original substance in 10,000 parts of the solution.&lt;ref&gt;
In standard chemistry, this produces a substance with a concentration of 0.01%, measured by the [[Concentration#Volume-volume percentage|volume-volume percentage]] method.&lt;/ref&gt; A 6C dilution repeats this process six times, ending up with the original substance diluted by a factor of 100&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;=10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; (one part in one trillion or 1/1,000,000,000,000). Higher dilutions follow the same pattern. 
In homeopathy, a solution that is more dilute is described as having a higher potency, and more dilute substances are considered by homeopaths to be stronger and deeper-acting remedies.&lt;ref&gt;

Hahnemann advocated 30C dilutions for most purposes (that is, dilution by a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Organon_6th_128&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hahnemann's time, it was reasonable to assume the remedies could be diluted indefinitely, as the concept of the atom or molecule as the [[Avogadro constant|smallest possible unit of a chemical substance]] was just beginning to be recognized. 
The greatest dilution reasonably likely to contain even one molecule of the original substance is 12C.

[[File:Arnica montana homéopathie zoom.jpg|thumb|This bottle contains [[arnica montana]] (wolf's bane) D6, i.e. the nominal dilution is one [[parts per million|part in a million]] (10&lt;sup&gt;'''-6'''&lt;/sup&gt;).]]
Some homeopaths developed a decimal scale (D or X), diluting the substance to ten times its original volume each stage. 
The D or X scale dilution is therefore half that of the same value of the C scale; for example, &quot;12X&quot; is the same level of dilution as &quot;6C&quot;. 
Hahnemann never used this scale, but it was very popular throughout the 19th century and still is in Europe. 
This potency scale appears to have been introduced in the 1830s by an American homeopath, [[Constantine Hering]].&lt;ref name=Dudgeon&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A given dilution on the Q scale is roughly 2.35 times its designation on the C scale. 
For example, a remedy described as &quot;20Q&quot; has about the same concentration as a &quot;47C&quot; remedy.&lt;ref&gt;
If a dilution is designated as q on the Q scale, and c on the C scale, c/q=log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(50,000)/2=2.349485.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Dilution debate====
Not all homeopaths advocate extremely high dilutions. 
Many of the early homeopaths were originally doctors and generally used lower dilutions such as &quot;3X&quot; or &quot;6X&quot;, rarely going beyond &quot;12X&quot;. 
The split between lower and higher dilutions followed ideological lines.  
Those favoring low dilutions stressed [[pathology]] and a strong link to conventional medicine, while those favoring high dilutions  emphasised vital force, miasms and a [[spirituality|spiritual]] interpretation of disease.&lt;ref&gt;

===Provings===
Hahnemann experimented on himself and others for several years before using remedies on patients. 
His experiments did not initially consist of giving remedies to the sick, because he thought that the most similar remedy, by virtue of its ability to induce symptoms similar to the disease itself, would make it impossible to determine which symptoms came from the remedy and which from the disease itself. 
Therefore, sick people were excluded from these experiments. 
The method used for determining which remedies were suitable for specific diseases was called &quot;proving&quot;, after the original German word ''Prüfung'', meaning &quot;test&quot;. 
A homeopathic proving is the method by which the profile of a homeopathic remedy is determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Dantas |first1=F |last2=Fisher |first2=P |last3=Walach |first3=H |last4=Wieland |first4=F |last5=Rastogi |first5=D |last6=Teixeira |first6=H |last7=Koster |first7=D |last8=Jansen |first8=J |last9=Eizayaga |first9=J |title=A systematic review of the quality of homeopathic pathogenetic trials published from 1945 to 1995 |journal=Homeopathy |volume=96 |issue=1 |pages=4–16 |year=2007 |pmid=17227742 |doi=10.1016/j.homp.2006.11.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At first Hahnemann used undiluted doses for provings, but he later advocated provings with remedies at a 30C dilution,&lt;ref name = &quot;Organon_6th_128&quot;/&gt; and most modern provings are carried out using ultradilute remedies in which it is highly unlikely that any of the original molecules remain.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the proving process, Hahnemann administered remedies to healthy volunteers, and the resulting symptoms were compiled by observers into a &quot;drug picture&quot;. 
The volunteers were observed for months at a time and made to keep extensive journals detailing all of their symptoms at specific times throughout the day. 
They were forbidden from consuming coffee, tea, spices, or wine for the duration of the experiment; playing chess was also prohibited because Hahnemann considered it to be &quot;too exciting&quot;, though they were allowed to drink beer and encouraged to exercise in moderation. 
After the experiments were over, Hahnemann made the volunteers take an oath swearing that what they reported in their journals was the truth, at which time he would interrogate them extensively concerning their symptoms.

Provings have been described as important in the development of the [[clinical trial]], due to their early use of simple control groups, systematic and quantitative procedures, and some of the first application of [[statistics]] in medicine.&lt;ref&gt;

For [[James Tyler Kent]]'s 1905 ''Lectures on Homoeopathic Materia Medica'', 217 remedies underwent provings and newer substances are continually added to contemporary versions.

Though the proving process has superficial similarities with clinical trials, it is fundamentally different in that the process is subjective, not blinded, and modern provings are unlikely to use pharmacologically active levels of the substance under proving.&lt;ref name=Creighton&gt;[http://altmed.creighton.edu/Homeopathy/science/validity.htm Are the principles of Homeopathy scientifically valid?], Creighton University School of Medicine&lt;/ref&gt; As early as 1842, Holmes noted the provings were impossibly vague, and the purported effect was not repeatable among different subjects.&lt;ref name=Holmes /&gt;

=== Physical, mental, and emotional state examination; Repertories ===
[[File:Rep1.JPG|thumb|Homeopathic repertory by James Tyler Kent]]

Homeopaths generally begin with detailed examinations of their patients' histories, including questions regarding their physical, mental and emotional states, their life circumstances and any physical or emotional illnesses. &lt;!--Examination of psychological state may include an inquiry into the content of dreams.&lt;ref name=&quot;books.google.com&quot;&gt;“Modern Homeopathy And Medical Science”''''', Journal of the American Medical Association, vol 22, March 17, '''1894''', p 367-377, [http://books.google.com/books?id=e_0SAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA377&amp;lpg=PA377&amp;dq=%22law+of+similars%22+definition+ama&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bITPMPPwr9&amp;sig=56_xALWwOFWYa4P4BQKj0mjw-eo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=z7k6TeO1CpC-sQPK2I26Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=similars&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt; outdated source, statement can be reintroduced when a better source is found --&gt;The homeopath then attempts to translate this information into a complex formula of mental and physical symptoms, including likes, dislikes, innate predispositions and even body type.&lt;ref name=Stehlin&gt;

From these symptoms, the homeopath chooses how to treat the patient. A compilation of reports of many homeopathic provings, supplemented with clinical data, is known as a &quot;homeopathic ''materia medica''&quot;. 
But because a practitioner first needs to explore the remedies for a particular symptom rather than looking up the symptoms for a particular remedy, the &quot;homeopathic repertory&quot;, which is an index of symptoms, lists after each symptom those remedies that are associated with it. 
Repertories are often very extensive and may include data extracted from multiple sources of ''materia medica''. 
There is often lively debate among compilers of repertories and practitioners over the veracity of a particular inclusion.

The first symptomatic index of the homeopathic ''materia medica'' was arranged by Hahnemann. Soon after, one of his students, [[Clemens Maria Franz von Bönninghausen|Clemens von Bönninghausen]], created the ''Therapeutic Pocket Book'', another homeopathic repertory.&lt;ref&gt;

The first such homeopathic repertory was Georg Jahr's ''Symptomenkodex'', published in German (1835), which was then first translated to English (1838) by Constantine Hering as the ''Repertory to the more Characteristic Symptoms of Materia Medica''. 
This version was less focused on disease categories and would be the forerunner to Kent's later works.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16322800&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last1=Bellavite |first1=Paolo |last2=Conforti |first2=Anita |last3=Piasere |first3=Valeria |last4=Ortolani |first4=Riccardo

It consisted of three large volumes. Such repertories increased in size and detail as time progressed.

Some diversity in approaches to treatments exists among homeopaths. &quot;Classical homeopathy&quot; generally involves detailed examinations of a patient's history and infrequent doses of a single remedy as the patient is monitored for improvements in symptoms, while &quot;clinical homeopathy&quot; involves combinations of remedies to address the various symptoms of an illness.&lt;ref name=pmid12614092/&gt;

===Homeopathic pills===
[[File:DoseOscillococcinum.jpg|thumb|Homeopathic pills, homeopathic remedy ''[[oscillococcinum]]'']]
Homeopathic pills are made from an inert substance (often sugars, typically lactose), upon which a drop of liquid homeopathic preparation is placed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst2005&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |pmid=17710203 |year=2007 |last1=Sagar |first1=SM |title=Homeopathy: Does a teaspoon of honey help the medicine go down? |volume=14 |issue=4 |pages=126–7 |pmc=1948865 |journal=Current oncology (Toronto, Ont.) |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===&quot;Active&quot; ingredients===

The list of ingredients seen on remedies may confuse consumers into believing the product actually contains those ingredients. According to normal homeopathic practice, remedies are prepared starting with [[active ingredient]]s that are often serially diluted to the point where the finished product no longer contains any biologically &quot;active ingredients&quot; as that term is normally defined.

===Isopathy===
Isopathy is a therapy derived from homeopathy invented by Johann Joseph Wilhelm Lux in the 1830s. Isopathy differs from homeopathy in general in that the remedies, known as &quot;nosodes&quot;, are made up either from things that cause the [[disease]] or from products of the disease, such as [[pus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16322800&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

===Flower remedies===
Flower remedies can be produced by placing flowers in water and exposing them to sunlight. The most famous of these are the [[Bach flower remedies]], which were developed by the physician and homeopath [[Edward Bach]]. Although the proponents of these remedies share homeopathy's vitalist world-view and the remedies are claimed to act through the same hypothetical &quot;vital force&quot; as homeopathy, the method of preparation is different. Bach flower remedies are prepared in &quot;gentler&quot; ways such as placing flowers in bowls of sunlit water, and the remedies are not succussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Vanhaselen |first1=R |title=The relationship between homeopathy and the Dr Bach system of flower remedies: A critical appraisal |journal=British Homoeopathic journal |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=121–7 |year=1999 |pmid=10449052 |doi=10.1054/homp.1999.0308}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no convincing scientific or clinical evidence for flower remedies being effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Ernst |first1=E |title=&quot;Flower remedies&quot;: a systematic review of the clinical evidence |journal=Wiener klinische Wochenschrift |volume=114 |issue=23–24 |pages=963–6 |year=2002 |pmid=12635462}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Veterinary use===
The idea of using homeopathy as a treatment for other animals, termed &quot;veterinary homeopathy&quot;, dates back to the inception of homeopathy; Hahnemann himself wrote and spoke of the use of homeopathy in animals other than humans.&lt;ref name=Saxton2007&gt;{{Citation |last1=Saxton |first1=J |title=The diversity of veterinary homeopathy |journal=Homeopathy |volume=96 |issue=1 |page=3 |year=2007 |pmid=17227741 |doi=10.1016/j.homp.2006.11.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FDA has not approved homeopathic products as veterinary medicine in the U.S. In the UK, [[veterinary surgeon]]s who use homeopathy belong to the [[Faculty of Homeopathy]] and/or to the British Association of Homeopathic Veterinary Surgeons. Animals may be treated only by qualified veterinary surgeons in the UK and some other countries. Internationally, the body that supports and represents homeopathic veterinarians is the International Association for Veterinary Homeopathy. The use of homeopathy in veterinary medicine is controversial; the little existing research on the subject is not of a high enough scientific standard to provide reliable data on efficacy.&lt;ref name=Hektoen&gt;{{Citation |last1=Hektoen |first1=L |title=Review of the current involvement of homeopathy in veterinary practice and research |journal=[[Veterinary Record]] |volume=157 |issue=8 |pages=224–9 |year=2005 |pmid=16113167}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies have also found that giving animals placebos can play active roles in influencing pet owners to believe in the effectiveness of the treatment when none exists.&lt;ref name=Hektoen/&gt;

===Electrohomeopathy===

[[Electrohomeopathy]] was a 19th century practice combining homeopathy with electric treatment.

The medicinal claims of homeopathy are unsupported by the collective weight of modern scientific research. There is an overall absence of sound statistical evidence of therapeutic efficacy, which is consistent with the lack of any [[biological plausibility|biologically plausible]] pharmacological [[Active ingredient|agent]] or mechanism.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12492603&quot;/&gt; Abstract concepts within theoretical physics have been invoked to suggest explanations of how or why remedies might work, including [[quantum entanglement]],&lt;ref name=nhsdirect&gt;{{cite web|title=Homeopathy - Issues|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Homeopathy/Pages/Issues.aspx|work=Homeopathy|publisher=[[National Health Service|NHS]]|accessdate=23 September 2010|date=2009-06-23|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100722010140/http://www.nhs.uk/Conditions/Homeopathy/Pages/Issues.aspx &lt;!--Added by H3llBot--&gt;|archivedate=22 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[theory of relativity]] and [[chaos theory]]. However, the explanations are offered by nonspecialists within the field, and often include speculations that are incorrect in their application of the concepts and not supported by actual experiments.&lt;ref name=Shelton/&gt;{{rp|255-6}}  Several of the key concepts of homeopathy conflict with fundamental concepts of physics and chemistry.&lt;ref name=&quot;nih overview&quot; /&gt;

===Plausibility===
The extreme dilutions used in homeopathic preparations usually leave none of the original substance in the final product. The modern mechanism proposed by homeopaths, [[water memory]], is considered implausible in that short-range order in water only persists for about 1 [[picosecond]].&lt;ref name=Teixeira&gt;{{Citation |last1=Teixeira |first1=J |title=Can water possibly have a memory?

The proposed rationale for these extreme dilutions – that the water contains the &quot;[[water memory|memory]]&quot; or &quot;vibration&quot; from the diluted ingredient – is counter to the laws of [[chemistry]] and [[physics]], such as the [[law of mass action]].&lt;ref name=Teixeira/&gt; Analysis shows proposed mechanisms for homeopathy are precluded from having any effect by the laws of physics and physical chemistry.&lt;ref name=GrimesFACT&gt;{{Citation  |author=[[David Robert Grimes|Grimes D R]] |title=Proposed mechanisms for homeopathy are physically impossible |journal=FACT |volume=17 |issue=3 |page=149 |year=2012 |doi=10.1111/j.2042-7166.2012.01162.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;High dilutions
The extremely high dilutions in homeopathy preclude a biologically plausible mechanism of action. Homeopathic remedies are usually diluted to the point where there are no molecules from the original solution left in a dose of the final remedy.&lt;ref name=Milgrom&gt;{{Citation |last1=Milgrom |first1=L |title=Conspicuous by its absence: the Memory of Water, macro-entanglement, and the possibility of homeopathy |journal=Homeopathy |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=209–19 |year=2007 |pmid=17678819 |doi=10.1016/j.homp.2007.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homeopaths contend that the methodical dilution of a substance, beginning with a 10% or lower solution and working downwards, with shaking after each dilution, produces a therapeutically active remedy, in contrast to therapeutically inert water.
Since even the longest-lived [[Noncovalent bonding|noncovalent]] structures in liquid water at room temperature are stable for only a few [[picosecond]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Teixeira |first1=José |last2=Luzar |first2=Alenka |last3=Longeville |first3=Stéphane |title=Dynamics of hydrogen bonds: how to probe their role in the unusual properties of liquid water |journal=Journal of Physics: Condensed Matter |volume=18 |pages=S2353–62 |year=2006 |doi=10.1088/0953-8984/18/36/S09 |issue=36 |bibcode = 2006JPCM...18S2353T }}&lt;/ref&gt; critics have concluded that any effect that might have been present from the original substance can no longer exist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weissmann&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last1=Weissmann |first1=G |title=Homeopathy: Holmes, Hogwarts, and the Prince of Wales |journal=The FASEB Journal |volume=20 |issue=11 |pages=1755–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16940145 |doi=10.1096/fj.06-0901ufm }}&lt;/ref&gt; No evidence of stable clusters of water molecules was found when homeopathic remedies were studied using [[nuclear magnetic resonance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1=Anick |first1=David J |title=High sensitivity 1H-NMR spectroscopy of homeopathic remedies made in water |journal=BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine |volume=4 |page=15 |year=2004 |pmid=15518588 |pmc=534805 |doi=10.1186/1472-6882-4-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, since water will have been in contact with millions of different substances throughout its history, critics point out that water is therefore an extreme dilution of almost any conceivable substance. By drinking water one would, according to this interpretation, receive treatment for every imaginable condition.&lt;ref&gt;

===Efficacy===
[[File:Hepar.jpg|thumb|Old bottle of ''Hepar sulph'' made from [[calcium sulfide]]]]

The effectiveness of homeopathy has been in dispute since its inception. One of the earliest double blind studies concerning homeopathy was sponsored by the British government during World War II in which volunteers tested the efficacy of homeopathic remedies against diluted mustard gas burns.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mustard&quot;&gt;{{Citation|publisher=British Homoeopathic Society|journal=Br Homeopath J|year=1943|title=Report on mustard gas experiments|page=12 |volume=33|issue=1 |url=http://www.jameslindlibrary.org/trial_records/20th_Century/1940s/brit_homeo_soc/brit_homeo_soc_kp.html

No individual preparation has been unambiguously demonstrated to be different from placebo.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12492603&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nccamnih&quot;&gt;{{Citation|url =http://nccam.nih.gov/health/homeopathy/|title =Questions and answers about homeopathy|publisher = [[National Institute of Health]]|accessdate  =2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Methodology|methodological]] quality of the [[primary research]] was generally low, with such problems as weaknesses in [[study design]] and reporting, small [[sample size]], and [[selection bias]]. Since better quality trials have become available, the evidence for efficacy of homeopathy preparations has diminished; the highest-quality trials indicate that the remedies themselves exert no intrinsic effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linde1999&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Caulfield2005&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Shelton/&gt;{{rp|206}} A review conducted in 2010 of all the pertinent studies of &quot;best evidence&quot; produced by the [[Cochrane Collaboration]] concluded that &quot;the most reliable evidence&amp;nbsp;– that produced by Cochrane reviews&amp;nbsp;– fails to demonstrate that homeopathic medicines have effects beyond placebo.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ernst2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|20402610}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

;Publication bias and other methodological issues
{{Further|Statistical hypothesis testing|P-value|Publication bias}}
The fact that individual randomized controlled trials have given positive results is not in contrast with an overall lack of statistical evidence of efficacy. A small proportion of randomized controlled trials inevitably provide false-positive outcomes due to the play of chance: a [[statistical significance|&quot;statistically significant&quot;]] positive outcome is commonly adjudicated when the probability of it being due to chance rather than a real effect is no more than 5%—a level at which about 1 in 20 tests can be expected to show a positive result in the absence of any therapeutic effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sterne2001&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last1=Sterne |first1=J.

Both [[meta-analysis|meta-analyses]], which statistically combine the results of several randomized controlled trials, and other [[systematic review]]s of the literature are essential tools to summarize evidence of therapeutic efficacy.&lt;ref name=&quot;PRISMA&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|19621070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early systematic reviews and meta-analyses of trials evaluating the efficacy of homeopathic remedies in comparison with placebo more often tended to generate positive results, but appeared unconvincing overall.&lt;ref name=&quot;LindeBMC-ComplementAlternMed2001&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid|11527508}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, reports of three large meta-analyses warned readers that firm conclusions could not be reached, largely due to methodological flaws in the primary studies and the difficulty in controlling for publication bias.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1825800&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last1=Kleijnen |first1=J |last2=Knipschild |first2=P |last3=Ter Riet |first3=G |title=Clinical trials of homoeopathy |journal=BMJ |volume=302 |issue=6772 |pages=316–23 |year=1991 |pmid=1825800 |pmc=1668980 |doi=10.1136/bmj.302.6772.316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid9310601/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10853874&quot;/&gt; The positive finding of one of the most prominent of the early meta-analyses, published in ''[[The Lancet]]'' in 1997 by Linde et al.,&lt;ref name=pmid9310601/&gt; was later reframed by the same research team, who wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The evidence of bias [in the primary studies] weakens the findings of our original meta-analysis. Since we completed our literature search in 1995, a considerable number of new homeopathy trials have been published. The fact that a number of the new high-quality trials ... have negative results, and a recent update of our review for the most &quot;original&quot; subtype of homeopathy (classical or individualized homeopathy), seem to confirm the finding that more rigorous trials have less-promising results.

In 2002, a systematic review of the available systematic reviews confirmed that higher-quality trials tended to have less positive results, and found no convincing evidence that any homeopathic remedy exerts clinical effects different from placebo.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12492603&quot; /&gt;

In 2005, ''[[The Lancet]]'' medical journal published a meta-analysis of 110 placebo-controlled homeopathy trials and 110 matched medical trials based upon the [[Swiss Federal Council|Swiss government]]'s [[Program for Evaluating Complementary Medicine]], or PEK. The study concluded that its findings were compatible with the notion that the clinical effects of homeopathy are nothing more than placebo effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;shang&quot; /&gt;

A 2006 meta-analysis of six trials evaluating homeopathic treatments to reduce [[Oncology|cancer therapy]] side-effects following [[radiotherapy]] and [[chemotherapy]] found that there was &quot;insufficient evidence to support clinical efficacy of homeopathic therapy in cancer care&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid16376071&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last1=Milazzo |first1=S |last2=Russell |first2=N |last3=Ernst |first3=E |title=Efficacy of homeopathic therapy in cancer treatment |journal=European Journal of Cancer |volume=42 |issue=3 |pages=282–9 |year=2006 |pmid=16376071 |doi=10.1016/j.ejca.2005.09.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 systematic review of homeopathy for children and adolescents found that the evidence for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder and childhood diarrhea was mixed.

These 19 studies showed a pooled odds ratio of 1.17 to 2.23 in favor of individualized homeopathy over the placebo, but no difference was seen when the analysis was restricted to the methodologically best trials. The authors concluded &quot;that the results of the available randomized trials suggest that individualized homeopathy has an effect over placebo. The evidence, however, is not convincing because of methodological shortcomings and inconsistencies.&quot; Jay Shelton, author of a book on homeopathy, has stated that the claim assumes without evidence that classical, individualized homeopathy works better than nonclassical variations.&lt;ref name=Shelton/&gt;{{rp|209}}

===Explanations of perceived effects===
Science offers a variety of explanations for how homeopathy may appear to cure diseases or alleviate symptoms even though the remedies themselves are inert:&lt;ref name=Shelton/&gt;{{rp|155-167}}
* The [[placebo effect]] — the intensive consultation process and expectations for the homeopathic preparations may cause the effect
* Therapeutic effect of the consultation — the care, concern and reassurance a patient experiences when opening up to a compassionate caregiver can have a positive effect on the patient's well-being.
* Unassisted [[natural healing]] — time and the body's ability to heal without assistance can eliminate many diseases of their own accord
* Unrecognized treatments — an unrelated food, exercise, environmental agent or treatment for a different ailment, may have occurred
* [[Regression toward the mean]] — since many diseases or conditions are cyclical, symptoms vary over time and patients tend to seek care when discomfort is greatest, they may feel better anyway but because the timing of the visit to the homeopath they attribute improvement to the remedy taken
* Non-homeopathic treatment — patients may also receive standard medical care simultaneous with homeopathic treatment, and the former is responsible for improvement
* Cessation of unpleasant treatment — often homeopaths recommend patients stop getting medical treatment such as surgery or drugs, which can cause unpleasant side-effects; improvements are attributed to homeopathy when the actual cause is the cessation of the treatment causing side-effects in the first place, but the underlying disease remains untreated and still dangerous to the patient
* Lifestyle changes — homeopaths often recommend diet and exercise, as well as limitations in alcohol or coffee consumption and [[Stress (biology)|stress]] reduction, all of which can increase health and decrease symptoms {{citation needed|date=May 2012}}

In 1987, French immunologist [[Jacques Benveniste]] submitted a paper to the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' while working at [[INSERM]]. The paper purported to have discovered that [[basophils]], a type of [[white blood cell]], released [[histamine]] when exposed to a homeopathic dilution of anti-immunoglobulin E antibody. The journal editors, sceptical of the results, requested that the study be replicated in a separate laboratory. Upon replication in four separate laboratories the study was published. Still sceptical of the findings, ''Nature'' assembled an independent investigative team to determine the accuracy of the research, consisting of ''Nature'' editor and physicist Sir [[John Maddox]], American scientific fraud investigator and chemist Walter Stewart, and sceptic [[James Randi]]. After investigating the findings and methodology of the experiment, the team found that the experiments were &quot;statistically ill-controlled&quot;, &quot;interpretation has been clouded by the exclusion of measurements in conflict with the claim&quot;, and concluded, &quot;We believe that experimental data have been uncritically assessed and their imperfections inadequately reported.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;delusion&quot;&gt;

This is no crime but science as usual and only the future knows.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; James Randi stated that he doubted that there had been any conscious fraud, but that the researchers had allowed &quot;wishful thinking&quot; to influence their interpretation of the data.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsullivan&quot; /&gt;

===Ethics and safety===
As homeopathic remedies usually contain only water and/or alcohol, they are thought to be generally safe. Only in rare cases are the original ingredients present at detectable levels. This may be due to improper preparation or intentional low dilution. Instances of [[arsenic poisoning]] have occurred after use of arsenic-containing homeopathic preparations.&lt;ref name=pmid14705842 /&gt; Zicam Cold remedy Nasal Gel, which contains 2X (1:100) [[Zinc gluconate#Safety concerns|zinc gluconate]], reportedly caused a small percentage of users to lose their sense of smell;&lt;ref&gt;

Referring specifically to homeopathy, the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|British House of Commons]] Science and Technology Committee has stated:
{{quote|
In the Committee’s view, homeopathy is a placebo treatment and the Government should have a policy on prescribing placebos. The Government is reluctant to address the appropriateness and ethics of prescribing placebos to patients, which usually relies on some degree of patient deception. Prescribing of placebos is not consistent with informed patient choice - which the Government claims is very important - as it means patients do not have all the information needed to make choice meaningful.

Beyond ethical issues and the integrity of the [[doctor-patient relationship]], prescribing pure placebos is bad medicine. Their effect is unreliable and unpredictable and cannot form the sole basis of any treatment on the NHS.&lt;ref name=inquiry_cfm/&gt;}}

The [[National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine]] of the United States' [[National Institutes of Health]] states:

{{quote|
Homeopathy is a controversial area of [[Complementary and Alternative Medicine|CAM]] because a number of its key concepts are not consistent with established laws of science (particularly chemistry and physics). Critics think it is implausible that a remedy containing a miniscule&lt;!--- This &quot;miniscule&quot; spelling is in the quote, and is a common and legitimate variant. See http://nccam.nih.gov/health/homeopathy/#contoversies --&gt; amount of an active ingredient (sometimes not a single molecule of the original compound) can have any biological effect—beneficial or otherwise.

In 1978, [[Anthony Campbell (physician)|Anthony Campbell]], then a consultant physician at The Royal London Homeopathic Hospital, criticised statements made by [[George Vithoulkas]] to promote his homeopathic treatments. Vithoulkas stated that [[syphilis]], when treated with antibiotics, would develop into secondary and tertiary syphilis with involvement of the [[central nervous system]]. Campbell described this as a thoroughly irresponsible statement that could mislead an unfortunate layperson into refusing conventional medical treatment. This claim echoes the idea that treating a disease with external medication used to treat the symptoms would only drive it deeper into the body and conflicts with scientific studies, which indicate that penicillin treatment produces a complete cure of syphilis in more than 90% of cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Birnbaum&quot;/&gt;

A 2006 review by W. Steven Pray of the College of Pharmacy at [[Southwestern Oklahoma State University]] recommends that pharmacy colleges include a required course in unproven medications and therapies, that ethical dilemmas inherent in recommending products lacking proven safety and efficacy data be discussed, and that students should be taught where unproven systems such as homeopathy depart from evidence-based medicine.&lt;ref&gt;

Homeopathy is fairly common in some countries while being uncommon in others; is highly regulated in some countries and mostly unregulated in others. It is practised worldwide and professional qualifications and licences are needed in most countries.&lt;ref name=WHO /&gt; Regulations vary in Europe depending on the country. In some countries, there are no specific legal regulations concerning the use of homeopathy, while in others, licences or degrees in conventional medicine from accredited universities are required. In Germany, to become a homeopathic physician, one must attend a three-year training program, while France, Austria and Denmark mandate licences to diagnose any illness or dispense of any product whose purpose is to treat any illness.&lt;ref name=WHO/&gt; Some homeopathic treatment is covered by the public health service of several European countries, including France, the United Kingdom, Denmark, and [[Luxembourg]]. In other countries, such as Belgium, homeopathy is not covered. In Austria, the public health service requires scientific proof of effectiveness in order to reimburse medical treatments and homeopathy is listed as not reimbursable&lt;ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom]], MPs inquired into homeopathy to assess the Government's policy on the issue, including funding of homeopathy under the [[National Health Service]] and government policy for licensing homeopathic products. The decision by the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] Science and Technology Committee follows a written explanation from the Government in which it told the select committee that the licensing regime was not formulated on the basis of scientific evidence. &quot;The three elements of the licensing regime (for homeopathic products) probably lie outside the scope of the ... select committee inquiry, because government consideration of scientific evidence was not the basis for their establishment,&quot; the Committee said. The inquiry sought written evidence and submissions from concerned parties.&lt;ref name=THE29thOct2009&gt;{{Citation|publisher=Times Higher Education|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?sectioncode=26&amp;storycode=408852&amp;c=1|title=News in brief: Homeopathic assessment|date=29 October 2009}}, timeshighereducation.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=091020_cfm&gt;[http://www.parliament.uk/parliamentary_committees/science_technology/s_t_pn05_091020.cfm Evidence check: Homeopathy], House of Commons Science and Technology Committee, 20 October 2009, parliament.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010 the House of Commons Science and Technology Committee concluded that:
{{quote|
... the NHS should cease funding homeopathy. It also concludes that the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency ([[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency|MHRA]]) should not allow homeopathic product labels to make medical claims without evidence of efficacy. As they are not medicines, homeopathic products should no longer be licensed by the MHRA.

The Committee concurred with the Government that the evidence base shows that homeopathy is not efficacious (that is, it does not work beyond the placebo effect) and that explanations for why homeopathy would work are scientifically implausible.

The Committee concluded – given that the existing scientific literature showed no good evidence of efficacy – that further clinical trials of homeopathy could not be justified.

In the Committee’s view, homeopathy is a placebo treatment and the Government should have a policy on prescribing placebos. The Government is reluctant to address the appropriateness and ethics of prescribing placebos to patients, which usually relies on some degree of patient deception. Prescribing of placebos is not consistent with informed patient choice – which the Government claims is very important – as it means patients do not have all the information needed to make choice meaningful.

Beyond ethical issues and the integrity of the doctor-patient relationship, prescribing pure placebos is bad medicine. Their effect is unreliable and unpredictable and cannot form the sole basis of any treatment on the NHS.&lt;ref name=inquiry_cfm/&gt;}}

The Committee also stated:
{{Quote|We conclude that placebos should not be routinely prescribed on the NHS. The funding of homeopathic hospitals – hospitals that specialise in the administration of placebos – should not continue, and NHS doctors should not refer patients to homeopaths.&lt;ref name=cmsctech_45&gt;[http://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/45/45.pdf Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy, Fourth Report of Session 2009–10], House of Commons Science and Technology Committee, 20 October 2009, parliament.uk&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In July 2010 the newly appointed UK [[Secretary of State for Health]] deferred to local NHS on funding homeopathy. A nineteen page document details the Government´s response, and it states that &quot;our continued position on the use of homeopathy within the NHS is that the local NHS and clinicians, rather than Whitehall, are best placed to make decisions on what treatment is appropriate for their patients - including complementary or alternative treatments such as homeopathy - and provide accordingly for those treatments.&quot;  The response also stated that &quot;the overriding reason for NHS provision is that homeopathy is available to provide patient choice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Secretary of State for Health [http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/@ps/documents/digitalasset/dh_117811.pdf Government Response to the Science and Technology Committee report 'Evidence Check 2: Homeopathy’], July 2010 ISBN 978-0-10-179142-7&lt;/ref&gt; by February 2011 only one third of PCTs still funded homeopathy.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-Feb-19-2011&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-12492742 | title=Third of NHS trusts fund homeopathy | work=[[BBC News]] | date=19 Feb, 2011 | accessdate=September 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CBC News]] reporter [[Erica Johnson]] for ''Marketplace'' conducted an investigation on the homeopathy industry in Canada, her findings were that it is &quot;based on flawed science and some loopy thinking&quot;. [[Center for Inquiry]] (CFI) Vancouver skeptics participated in a mass overdose outside an emergency room in Vancouver, B.C., taking entire bottles of &quot;medications&quot; that should have made them sleepy, nauseous or dead, after 45 minutes of observation no ill effects were felt. Johnson asked homeopaths and company representatives about cures for cancer and vaccine claims, all reported positive results.  None could offer any science backing up their statements, only that &quot;it works&quot;. Johnson was unable to find any evidence that homeopathy contains any active ingredient. [[University of Toronto]]'s chemistry department found that the active ingredient is so small &quot;it is equivalent to 5 billion times less than the amount of aspirin... in a single pellet&quot;.  Belladonna and ipeca &quot;would be indistinguishable from each other in a blind test.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Erica|title=CBC Marketplace - Homeopathy: Cure or Con?

===Historical context===
An early assertion that like cures like was made by Hippocrates about 400 BC, when he prescribed mandrake root, which produced mania, to treat mania, by prescribing a dose smaller than what would produce mania.&lt;ref&gt;'''''“Modern Homeopathy And Medical Science”''''' in the Journal of the American Medical Association, March 17, '''1894''', [http://books.google.com/books?id=e_0SAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA377&amp;lpg=PA377&amp;dq=%22law+of+similars%22+definition+ama&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bITPMPPwr9&amp;sig=56_xALWwOFWYa4P4BQKj0mjw-eo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=z7k6TeO1CpC-sQPK2I26Aw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CBMQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=similars&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century the pioneer of pharmacology [[Paracelsus]] declared that small doses of “what makes a man ill also cures him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was Hahnemann who gave it a name and laid out its principles in the late 18th century. At that time, mainstream medicine employed such measures as [[bloodletting]] and purging, used [[laxative]]s and [[enema]]s, and administered complex mixtures, such as [[Venice treacle]], which was made from 64 substances including opium, myrrh, and viper's flesh.&lt;ref&gt;

===Hahnemann's concept===
{{See also|Samuel Hahnemann}}
Hahnemann conceived of homeopathy while translating a medical treatise by Scottish physician and chemist [[William Cullen]] into German.&lt;ref name=&quot;homhist1&quot;/&gt; Being skeptical of Cullen's theory concerning [[cinchona]]'s action in intermittent fever, Hahnemann ingested some of the bark specifically to see if it cured fever &quot;by virtue of its effect of strengthening the stomach&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
{{citation

 |accessdate  =2009-03-25
}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon ingesting the bark, he noticed few stomach symptoms, but did experience [[fever]], [[shivering]] and [[arthralgia|joint pain]], symptoms similar to some of the early symptoms of intermittent fever, the disease that the bark was ordinarily used to treat. From this, Hahnemann came to believe that all effective drugs produce symptoms in healthy individuals similar to those of the diseases that they treat. This later became known as the &quot;law of similars&quot;, the most important concept of homeopathy.&lt;ref name=homhist1&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term &quot;homeopathy&quot; was coined by Hahnemann and first appeared in print in 1807, although he began outlining his theories of &quot;medical similars&quot; or the &quot;doctrine of specifics&quot; in a series of articles and monographs in 1796.&lt;ref&gt;

Hahnemann began to test what effects substances produced in humans, a procedure that would later become known as &quot;homeopathic proving&quot;.&lt;ref name=homproving&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
These time-consuming tests required subjects to clearly record all of their symptoms as well as the ancillary conditions under which they appeared. Hahnemann saw these data as a way of identifying substances suitable for the treatment of particular diseases.&lt;ref name=&quot;homproving&quot;/&gt; The first collection of provings was published in 1805 and a second collection of 65 remedies appeared in his book, ''Materia Medica Pura'', in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;

Hahnemann believed that large doses of drugs that caused similar symptoms would only aggravate illness, so he advocated extreme dilutions of the substances; he devised a technique for making dilutions that he believed would preserve a substance's therapeutic properties while removing its harmful effects,&lt;ref name=&quot;Dynamization and Dilution&quot; /&gt; proposing that this process aroused and enhanced &quot;the spirit-like medicinal powers of the crude substances&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Organon_5th_269&quot;&gt;

He gathered and published a complete overview of his new medical system in his 1810 book, ''[[The Organon of the Healing Art]]'', whose 6th edition, published in 1921, is still used by homeopaths today.&lt;ref name=&quot;homhist1&quot;/&gt;

===19th century: rise to popularity and early criticism===
Homeopathy achieved its greatest popularity in the 19th century. Dr. [[John Franklin Gray]] (1804&amp;ndash;1882) was the first practitioner of homeopathy in the United States, beginning in 1828 in [[New York City]].  The first homeopathic schools opened in 1830, and throughout the 19th century dozens of homeopathic institutions appeared in Europe and the United States.&lt;ref name=Julian&gt;

From its inception, however, homeopathy was criticized by mainstream science. [[John Forbes (physician)|Sir John Forbes]], physician to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], said in 1843 that the extremely small doses of homeopathy were regularly derided as useless, &quot;an outrage to human reason&quot;.&lt;ref name=John_Forbes&gt;
