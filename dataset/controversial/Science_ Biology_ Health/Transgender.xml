'''Transgender''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|t|r|æ|n|z|ˈ|dʒ|ɛ|n|d|ər}}) is a general term applied to a variety of individuals, behaviors, and groups involving tendencies to vary from culturally conventional [[gender role]]s.

Transgender is the state of one's [[gender identity]] (self-identification as woman, man, neither or both) not matching one's assigned sex (identification by others as male, female or [[intersex]] based on physical/[[SRY|genetic sex]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;glaad.org&quot;&gt;Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.

The precise definition for transgender remains in flux, but includes:
* &quot;Of, relating to, or designating a person whose identity does not conform unambiguously to conventional notions of male or female [[gender]] roles, but combines or moves between these.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;oeddraft2004&quot;&gt;Author unknown, (2004) &quot;...Transgender, adj.

A transgender individual may have characteristics that are normally associated with a particular gender, identify elsewhere on the traditional gender continuum, or exist outside of it as other, [[Androgyny#Alternatives|agender]], [[genderqueer]], or [[third gender]]. Transgender people may also identify as [[bigender]], or along several places on either the traditional transgender continuum, or the more encompassing continuums which have been developed in response to the significantly more detailed studies done in recent years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Layton&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://pep-web.org/document.php?id=paq.067.0341a Layton, Lynne.

==Evolution of the term transgender==

Writing for health professionals in the second edition of his reference work ''Sexual Hygiene and Pathology'' in 1965, psychiatrist John F. Oliven of [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons|Columbia University]] used the lexical compound trans+gender in the ''Transexualism'' section of “Primary Transvestism,” noting &quot;'transgenderism' is what is meant, because sexuality is not a major factor in primary transvestism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=A.|first=R.|title=Book Reviews and Notices: Sexual Hygiene and Pathology |journal=American Journal of the Medical Sciences |year=1965 |month=August |volume=250 |issue=2 |pages=235 |url=http://journals.lww.com/amjmedsci/Citation/1965/08000/Sexual_Hygiene_and_Pathology.54.aspx|accessdate=4 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williams|first=Cristan|title=1965: Transgenderism = Transsexualism|url=http://research.cristanwilliams.com/2012/06/02/1965-transgenderism-transsexualism/|work=Sexual Hygiene and Pathology|accessdate=4 June 2012|author=John F.

===Transgender vs. transsexual===
''Transsexual'', unlike ''transgender'', originated in medical and psychological communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;glaad.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;benjaminscale&quot;&gt;Benjamin, H. (1966). ''The transsexual phenomenon.'' New York: Julian Press, page 23.&lt;/ref&gt; It was defined by [[Harry Benjamin]] in his seminal book ''The Transsexual Phenomenon''.&lt;ref name=&quot;benjaminscale&quot;/&gt; He defined transsexuality on the &quot;[[Benjamin Scale]]&quot;, with levels of intensity; &quot;Transsexual (nonsurgical)&quot;, &quot;True Transsexual (moderate intensity)&quot;, and &quot;True Transsexual (high intensity)&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;benjaminscale&quot;/&gt; Many transsexuals believe that to be a true transsexual, a person needs to have a desire for surgery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ts-Si_Gaughan&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Gaughan | first = Sharon | author link = | coauthors = | title = What About Non-op Transsexuals?

In addition to the larger categories of transgender and transsexual, there is a wide range of gender expressions and identities which are contrary to the mainstream male-female binary. These include [[cross dresser]]s, [[drag queen]]s, [[drag king]]s, [[transvestite]]s, [[genderqueer]], etc.

Some people take issue with ''transsexual'' because [[Virginia Prince|Virginia Charles Prince]], who started ''[[Transvestia]]'', and built up the [[cross-dress]]ing organization [[Tri-Ess]], used ''transgender'' to distinguish cross-dressers from gay, bisexual and trans''sexual'' people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/prince_vc.html Prince, Virginia Charles (1913-2009) ]&lt;/ref&gt; In &quot;Men Who Choose to Be Women,&quot; Prince wrote &quot;I, at least, know the difference between sex and gender and have simply elected to change the latter and not the former.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;princevone&quot;&gt;Prince, V. (1969), Men Who Choose to be Women, Sexology, February, pp. 441–444. Use of the term &quot;transgenderal&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; There is ample academic literature on the difference between sex and gender, but in [[Descriptive linguistics|pragmatic]] English this distinction is often ignored, so that &quot;gender&quot; is used to describe the categorical male/female difference and &quot;sex&quot; is used to describe the physical act of [[sexual intercourse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Liberman|first=Mark|title=Single-X Education|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004621.html|publisher=Language Log|accessdate=28 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There is political tension between the identities that fall under the &quot;transgender umbrella.&quot;&lt;ref name=MHB&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyd|first=Hellen|title=The Umbrella|url=http://www.myhusbandbetty.com/2008/07/27/the-umbrella/|publisher=enGender|accessdate=28 June 2012|quote=the only part of the gender binary we *necessarily* challenge is the notion that people are always assigned to the right side of the binary at birth, and don’t need sympathy or help if the assignment goes wrong.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, transsexual men and women who can pay for medical treatments (or who have institutional coverage for their treatment) are likely to be concerned with medical privacy and establishing a durable legal status as their gender later in life. Extending insurance coverage for medical care is a coherent issue in the [[intersectionality|intersection]] of transsexuality and [[economic class]]. Most of these issues can appeal even to conservatives, if framed in terms of an unusual sort of &quot;maintenance&quot; of traditional notions of gender for rare people who feel the need for medical treatments. Some trans people might paraphrase this by saying, &quot;I don't challenge the [[gender binary]]. I just started out on the wrong side of it.&quot;&lt;ref name=MHB/&gt;

==Transgender identities==

[[File:Albert-Cashier.jpg|thumb|left|[[Albert Cashier]], a [[trans man]] who served as a soldier in the US civil war.]]

While people self-identify as transgender, the transgender identity umbrella includes sometimes-overlapping categories. These include [[transsexual]]; [[transvestism|transvestite or cross-dresser]]; [[genderqueer]]; [[Androgyny|androgyne]]; and [[bigender]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ryan&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |title=[[Lesbian and Gay Youth: Care and Counseling]] |first=Caitlin C |last=Ryan |first2=Donna |last2=Futterman |year=1998 |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=0-231-11191-6 |pages=49 |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter. Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually not included are [[transvestic fetish]]ists (because it is considered to be a [[paraphilia]] rather than gender identification), and [[drag kings]] and [[drag queens]], who are performers who cross-dress for the purpose of entertaining. In an interview, celebrity drag queen [[RuPaul]] talked about society's ambivalence to the differences in the people who embody these terms. &quot;A friend of mine recently did the ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show|Oprah]]'' show about transgender youth,&quot; said RuPaul. &quot;It was obvious that we, as a culture, have a hard time trying to understand the difference between a drag queen, transsexual, and a transgender, yet we find it very easy to know the difference between the [[American League|American baseball league]] and the [[National League|National baseball league]], when they are both so similar.&quot;&lt;ref name=DS&gt;[[n:RuPaul speaks about society and the state of drag as performance art|Interview with RuPaul]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', October 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; These terms are explained below.

The current definitions of transgender include all transsexual people, although this has been criticized. (See below.) [[Intersex]] people have genitalia or other physical [[sex|sexual characteristics]] that do not conform to strict definitions of male and/or female, but intersex people are not necessarily transgender, since they do not all disagree with their assigned sex at birth. Transgender and intersex issues often overlap, however, because they both challenge the notion of rigid definitions of sex and gender.

The term ''[[trans man]]'' refers to female-to-male (FtM or F2M) transgender people, and ''[[trans woman]]'' refers to male-to-female (MtF or M2F) transgender people. In the past, it was assumed that there were more trans women than trans men, but a Swedish study estimated a ratio of 1.4:1 in favour of trans women for those requesting sex reassignment surgery and a ratio of 1:1 for those who proceeded.&lt;ref name=&quot;sept2207&quot;&gt;Landén, M., Wålinder, J., Lundstrom, B. (1996) &quot;...Results: During the 20-year period of the study, 233 requests for sex reassignment were processed, and the incidence data were calculated on the basis of this group. This means that the average annual frequency was 11.6 cases. The number of inhabitants in Sweden over 15 years of age increased during the study period from 6.5&amp;nbsp;million to 7.1&amp;nbsp;million, i.e. there was a mean population of 6.8&amp;nbsp;million (12), which gives an annual incidence of request for sex reassignment of 0.17 per {{formatnum:100000}} inhabitants. The sex ratio (male:female) is 1.4 :1. To resolve the question of whether transsexualism increases or decreases, we divided the group into two 10-year periods. As can be seen from Table 1, not only do our results agree with the Swedish incidence data published in the 1970s, but also they remain remarkably stable over time. Separating from all applications the group with primary transsexualism yielded 188 cases, i.e. 9.4 cases annually. As is shown in Table 2, this corresponds to an incidence of primary transsexualism of 0.14 per {{formatnum:100000}} inhabitants over 15 years of age. It should also be noted that primary transsexualism is equally common in women and men...&quot; in [http://www.blackwell-synergy.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1600-0447.1996.tb10645.x Incidence and sex ratio of transsexualism in Sweden] from [http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/journal.asp?ref=0001-690x Acta Psychiatrica Scandanavica], Volume 93, pages 261-263. Retrieved on 2007-09-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[cisgender]]'' has been coined as an antonym referring to non-transgender people; i.e. those who identify with their gender assigned at birth.&lt;ref&gt;Crethar, H. C. &amp; Vargas, L. A. (2007). ''Multicultural intricacies in professional counseling.'' In J. Gregoire &amp; C. Jungers (Eds.), The counselor’s companion: What every beginning counselor needs to know. Mahwah, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum. ISBN 0-8058-5684-6. p.61.&lt;/ref&gt;

When referring to a transgender person, it is respectful to always use that person's preferred name and pronoun regardless of their legal gender status (as not all transgender people can afford surgery or other body modifications). The word &quot;transgender&quot; should be used as an adjective rather than a noun — for example, &quot;Max is transgender&quot; or &quot;Max is a transgender man&quot; rather than &quot;Max is a transgender.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;GLAAD’s Transgender Resource Page&quot;&gt;Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation.

Transsexual people may undergo [[gender transition]], the process of aligning one's gender expression or presentation with their internal [[gender identity]]. People who have transitioned may or may not necessarily identify as transgender or transsexual any longer, but simply as a man or a woman.

References to &quot;pre-operative&quot;, &quot;post-operative&quot; and &quot;non-operative&quot; transsexual people indicate whether they have had, or are planning to have sex reassignment surgery, although some trans people reject these terms as objectifying trans people based on their surgical status and not their mental gender identity.

{{Main|Genderqueer|l1=Genderqueer}}
[[Genderqueer]] is a recent attempt to signify gender experiences that do not fit into binary concepts, and refers to a combination of gender identities and sexual orientations. One example could be a person whose gender presentation is sometimes perceived as male, sometimes female, but whose gender identity is female, gender expression is butch, and sexual orientation is lesbian. It suggests nonconformity or mixing of gender stereotypes, conjoining both gender and sexuality,&lt;ref&gt;Wilchins, Riki Anne (2002) ‘It’s Your Gender, Stupid’, pp.23-32 in Joan Nestle, Clare Howell and Riki Wilchins (eds.)

===Androgyne===
{{Main|Androgyny|l1=Androgyny}}
An [[Androgyny|androgyne]] is a person who does not fit cleanly into the typical [[gender roles]] of their society. It does not imply any specific form of sexual orientation. Androgynes may identify as beyond gender, between genders, moving across genders, entirely genderless, or any or all of these, exhbiting a variety of male, female, and other characteristics. Androgyne identities include [[pangender]], [[androgyne|ambigender]], [[androgyne|non-gendered]], [[androgyne|agender]], [[androgyne|gender fluid]] or [[intergender]]. Androgyny can be either physical or [[psychological]], and it does not depend on birth sex. Occasionally, people who do not define themselves as androgynes adapt their physical appearance to look [[androgynous]]. This outward androgyny has been used in fashion, and the milder forms of it (women wearing men's pants or men wearing two earrings, for example) are not seen as transgender behavior.

The term ''androgyne'' is also sometimes used as a medical synonym for an [[intersex]] individual.&lt;ref&gt;androgyne. (n.d.). Merriam-Webster's Medical Dictionary. Retrieved 2008-04-07, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/androgyne&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bigender===
{{Main|Bigender|l1=Bigender}}
A [[bigender]] (sometimes rendered as bi-gender or bi+gender) individual is one who moves between [[masculine]] and [[feminine]] [[gender roles]]. Such individuals move between two distinct personalities fluidly depending on context. While an [[androgyne|androgynous]] person retains the same gender-typed behaviour across situations, the bigendered person consciously or unconsciously changes their gender-role behaviour from primarily masculine to primarily feminine, or vice versa.

===Drag kings and queens===
{{See also|Drag king|Drag queen|Faux queen}}
[[Drag (clothing)|Drag]] is a term applied to clothing and make-up worn on special occasions for [[performing arts|performing]] or entertaining. This is in contrast to those who are transgender or who [[cross-dress]] for other reasons. Drag performance also includes overall presentation and behavior in addition to clothing and makeup. Drag can be theatrical, comedic, or grotesque. Drag queens have been considered caricatures of women by [[second-wave feminism]]. Drag artists have a long tradition in [[LGBT culture]]. Generally the terms ''[[drag queen]]'' covers men doing female drag, ''[[drag king]]'' covers women doing male drag, and ''[[faux queen]]'' covers women doing female drag. Nevertheless, there are drag artists of all genders and sexualities who perform for various reasons. Some drag performers, transvestites, and people in the gay community, have embraced the pornographically-derived term ''tranny'' to describe drag queens or people who engage in transvestism or cross-dressing, however this term is widely considered offensive if applied to transsexual people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bilerico.com/2008/09/is_tranny_offensive.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the distinction between sexual orientation and gender, throughout history the [[LGBT|gay, lesbian, and bisexual]] subculture was often the only place where gender-variant people were socially accepted in the [[gender role]] they felt they belonged to; especially during the time when legal or medical [[transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]] was almost impossible. This acceptance has had a complex history. Like the wider world, the gay community in Western societies did not generally distinguish between sex and [[gender identity]] until the 1970s, and often perceived gender variant people more as homosexuals who behaved in a gender-variant way than as gender-variant people in their own right. Today, members of the transgender community often continue to struggle to remain part of the same movement as lesbian, gay and bisexual citizens, and to be included in rights protections.

==Pride symbols==
 {{Main|LGBT symbols}}
[[File:Transgender Pride flag.svg|thumb|The transgender pride flag|250px]]

A common symbol for the transgender community is the [[transgender pride flag]], which was designed by Monica Helms, and was first shown at a pride parade in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], United States in 2000.

The flag consists of five horizontal stripes, two light [[blue]], two [[pink]], with a [[white]] stripe in the [[Center of symmetry|center]].

Monica describes the meaning of the flag as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The light blue is the traditional color for baby boys, pink is for [[girl]]s, and the white in the middle is for those who are transitioning, those who feel they have a neutral gender or no gender, and those who are [[Intersexuality|intersexed]]. The pattern is such that no matter which way you fly it, it will always be correct. This symbolizes us trying to find correctness in our own lives.

Other transgender symbols include the [[butterfly]] (symbolizing transformation or metamorphosis), and a pink/light blue [[yin and yang]] symbol.

{{Seealso|Transfeminism}}

{{Expand section|date=July 2009}}

Some feminists and feminist groups are supportive of transgender people. Others are not.

Though [[second-wave feminism]] argued for the [[sex and gender distinction]], some feminists believed there was a conflict between transgender identity and the feminist cause. These feminists believed, for example, that male-to-female transition abandoned or devalued female identity, and that trangender people embraced traditional gender roles and stereotypes. Many transgender feminists, however, viewed themselves as contributing positively to feminism by questioning and subverting gender norms. [[Third wave feminism|Third wave]] and contemporary feminism have tended to be more accepting of transgender people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last = Hines  | first = Sally     | title = TransForming gender: transgender practices of identity, intimacy and care  | publisher = The Policy Press, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist writer [[Janice Raymond]] asserts that sex determines gender, and that there is no practical difference between the two. In her view, genitalia or &quot;birth sex&quot; or chromosomes deeply and permanently determine one's essential identity as a woman or man; trying to violate this divide is impossible, unnatural, and unhealthy. She argues that while transpeople may claim to feel like a certain gender, only a biological female can genuinely feel what it is to occupy a woman's body, including having experiences such as childbirth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Raymond&quot;&gt;[[Janice Raymond|Raymond, Janice G.]] (1980) ''The Transsexual Empire'' Women's Press, London, ISBN 0-7043-3857-2 (Pbk)&lt;/ref&gt;

Therapy is recommended by most mental health professionals for those who suffer from internal conflicts regarding their gender identity or those who feel discomfort in their assigned gender role, especially if they desire to [[transitioning (transgender)|transition]]. People who experience discord between their gender and the expectations of others or whose gender identity conflicts with their body may benefit by talking through their feelings in depth with someone who will listen attentively. However, research on gender identity is relatively new to psychology and scientific understanding of it and related issues is still in its infancy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&amp;Rounsley&quot;&gt;Brown, M.L. &amp; Rounsley, C.A.

Transgender people may be eligible for diagnosis of gender identity disorder (GID) &quot;only if [being transgender] causes distress or disability.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;apatransgenderanswersdisorder&quot;&gt;[http://www.apa.org/topics/sexuality/transgender.aspx Answers to Your Questions About Transgender Individuals and Gender Identity] report from the website of the American Psychological Association - &quot;Is being transgender a mental disorder?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This distress is referred to as ''[[gender dysphoria]]'' and may manifest as depression or inability to work and form healthy relationships with others. This diagnosis is often misinterpreted as implying that simply being transgender means a person suffers from GID, which is not the case. This has caused much confusion to transgender people and those who seek to either criticize or affirm them. Transgender people who are comfortable with their gender, whose gender does not directly cause inner frustration or impair their functioning, do not suffer from GID. Moreover, GID is not necessarily permanent, and is often resolved through therapy and/or transitioning. GID does not refer to people who feel oppressed by the negative attitudes and behaviors or others including legal entities in the same way that racist institutions do not create a &quot;race disorder.&quot; Neither does GID imply an opinion of immorality; the psychological establishment holds the position that people with any kind of mental or emotional problem should not receive stigma. The solution for GID is whatever will alleviate suffering and restore functionality; this often, but not always, consists of undergoing a [[Transitioning (transgender)|gender transition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&amp;Rounsley&quot;/&gt;

The terms &quot;transsexualism&quot;, &quot;dual-role transvestism&quot;, &quot;gender identity disorder in adolescents or adults&quot; and &quot;gender identity disorder not otherwise specified&quot; are listed as such in the [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|International Statistical Classification of Diseases (ICD)]] or the American [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)]] under codes F64.0, F64.1, 302.85 and 302.6 respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM-IV&quot;&gt;[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], Fourth Edition (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010, France became the first country in the world to remove transgender identity from the list of mental diseases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trans.ilga.org/trans/welcome_to_the_ilga_trans_secretariat/news/france_transsexualism_will_no_longer_be_classified_as_a_mental_illness_in_france France: Transsexualism will no longer be classified as a mental illness in France]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/societe/article/2010/02/12/le-transsexualisme-n-est-plus-une-maladie-mentale-en-france_1305090_3224.html Le transsexualisme n'est plus une maladie mentale en France]&lt;/ref&gt;

The issues around psychological classifications and associated stigma (whether based in paraphilia or not) of cross dressers, transsexual men and women (and for that matter lesbian and gay children who may be difficult to tell apart from trans children early in life) have recently become more complex since it was announced that [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health|CAMH]] colleagues [[Kenneth Zucker]] and [[Ray Blanchard]] would serve on the [[DSM-V]]'s Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders Work Group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psych.org/MainMenu/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2008NewsReleases/dsmwg.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; CAMH aims to 'cure' transgender people of their 'disorder', especially in children. Within the trans community, this has mostly produced shock and outrage with attempts to organize other responses.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gidreform.org/dsm5.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

One of the reasons there is so much controversy about Kenneth Zucker and Ray Blanchard's work group is that many people believe that gender identity disorders/homosexuality are incurable as they are genetic and/or occur as a result of events occurring before birth (therefore already &quot;solidified&quot; by the time of birth). If this is the case, then trying to 'cure' said condition(s) could lead (and in some individuals already has led&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lauras-playground.com/transgender_suicide_report.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.q-notes.com/403/alternative-realities-part-one/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intersexualite.org/Zucker-complaint.html&lt;/ref&gt;) to increased confusion, more intense dysphoria later in life, and perhaps even suicide (likely due to the fact that the younger the transgender individual, the greater the effect of hormones). While some cases of individuals partaking in these sessions seem to show success, the long term repercussions (if any) of some of these individuals being 'cured' have not yet been observed, due to an indefinite amount of time before negative reactions could possibly occur.

Transgender issues are both new in the scientific field and affect relatively few people, so many mental healthcare providers know little about transgender issues. People seeking help from these professionals often end up educating the professional rather than receiving help.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brown&amp;Rounsley&quot;/&gt; Among those therapists who profess to know about transgender issues, many believe that transitioning from one sex to another{{spaced ndash}}the standard transsexual model{{spaced ndash}}is the best or only solution.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} This usually works well for those who are transsexual, but is not the solution for other transgender people, particularly [[genderqueer]] people who do not identify as exclusively [[male]] or [[female]].

==Transgender people and religion==
{{POV-section|date=November 2010}}
{{Main|Religious views on transgender people}}
The world's religions display great diversity and their interpretations of and reactions to transgender people demonstrate equal diversity. Even within one specific religion, Christianity, different groups have very different interpretations of gender identity and socio-cultural gender roles as well as very different attitudes toward and reactions to transgender people (see the main article on this topic). More generally the scriptures of [[Abrahamic religions]] include both texts&lt;ref&gt;{{Bible|Deuteronomy|22:5}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes interpreted as condemning transgender persons as well as texts&lt;ref&gt;{{Bible|Deuteronomy|32:18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bible|Isaiah|66:12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bible|Matthew|23:37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Bible|James|1:18}}&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes interpreted as challenging conservative views of gender and of the possibilities open to transgender people, as well as offering them encouragement, support and hope.

==Transsexual people and science==
{{Main|Causes of transsexualism}}

===Brain-based studies===
Several studies have concentrated on whether sexually dimorphic brain structures in transsexuals are more similar to their preferred sex or to their birth sex. Researchers caution that there are known brain differences between homosexual and heterosexual persons and that the brain changes in response to hormone-treatment, which many transsexuals use. In order to know what in the brain is related to what feature of the person, studies of more uniform groups give clearer results than do studies of more mixed groups.

====Androphilic MtF transsexuals====
Studies have consistently shown that specifically [[androphilic]] male-to-female transsexuals (sometimes called ''homosexual MtF transsexuals'' in studies) show a shift towards the female direction in brain anatomy. In 2009, a German team of radiologists led by Gizewski compared 12 androphilic transsexuals with 12 biological males and 12 biological females. Using [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI), they found that when shown erotica, the biological men responded in several brain regions that the biological women did not, and that the sample of androphilic transsexuals was shifted towards the female direction in brain responses.&lt;ref&gt;Gizewski, E. R., Krause, E., Schlamann, M., Happich, F., Ladd, M. E., Forsting, M., &amp; Senf, W. (2009). Specific cerebral activation due to visual erotic stimuli in male-to-female transsexuals compared with male and female controls: An fMRI study. ''Journal of Sexual Medicine, 6,'' 440–448.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Rametti and colleagues used [[diffusion tensor imaging]] (DTI) to compare 18 androphilic male-to-female transsexuals with 19 gynephilic males and 19 typical (heterosexual) females. The androphilic transsexuals differed from both control groups in multiple brain areas, including the superior longitudinal fasciculus, the right anterior cingulum, the right forceps minor, and the right corticospinal tract. The study authors concluded that androphilic transsexuals are halfway between the patterns exhibited by male and female controls.&lt;ref&gt;Rametti, G., Carrillo, B., Gómez-Gil, E., Junque, C., Zubiarre-Elorza, L., Segovia, S., Gomez, Á. &amp; Guillamon, A., (2010). The microstructure of white matter in male to female transsexuals before cross-sex hormonal treatment: A DTI study. ''Journal of Psychiatric Research.'' {{doi|10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.11.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gynephilic MtF transsexuals====
Conversely, [[gynephilic]] male-to-female transsexuals also show differences in the brain from non-transsexual males, but in a unique pattern different from being shifted in a female direction. Researchers of the [[Karolinska Institute]] of [[Stockholm]] used MRI to compare 24 gynephilic male-to-female transsexuals with 24 non-transsexual male and 24 non-transsexual female controls. None of the study participants were on hormone treatment. The researchers found sex-typical differentiation between the MtF transsexuals and non-transsexual males, and the non-transsexual females; but the gynephilic transsexuals &quot;displayed also singular features and differed from both control groups by having reduced [[thalamus]] and [[putamen]] volumes and elevated GM volumes in the [[Insular cortex|right insular]] and [[Inferior frontal gyrus|inferior frontal cortex]] and an area covering the right [[angular gyrus]].&quot; 

These researchers concluded that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Contrary to the primary hypothesis, no sex-atypical features with signs of 'feminization' were detected in the transsexual group....The present study does not support the dogma that [male-to-female transsexuals] have atypical sex dimorphism in the brain but confirms the previously reported sex differences. The observed differences between MtF-TR and controls raise the question as to whether gender dysphoria may be associated with changes in multiple structures and involve a network (rather than a single nodal area).&lt;ref&gt;Savic, I., &amp; Arver, S. (2011). Sex dimorphism of the brain in male-to-female transsexuals. ''Cerebral Cortex.'' {{doi|10.1093/cercor/bhr032}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In Sweden, non-androphilic transsexual women were tested when they were smelling odorous steroids. The results showed that the transsexual women demonstrated &quot;a pattern of activation away from the biological sex, occupying an intermediate position with predominantly female-like features.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;H. Berglund, P. Lindström, C. Dhejne-Helmy &amp; I. Savic (2008). Male-to-Female Transsexuals Show Sex-Atypical Hypothalamus Activation When Smelling Odorous Steroids.  ''Cerebral Cortex.'' {{doi|10.1093/cercor/bhm216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne Lawrence, a sexologist, physician, and self-identified autogynephilic transsexual, has hypothesized that the desire by persons with [[autogynephilia]], including some cross dressers and some transsexuals, to alter their body can be compared with [[apotemnophilia]] (alternately [[body integrity identity disorder]] if framed as an identity issue rather than a fetish).&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, A. A. (2006). Clinical and theoretical parallels between desire for limb amputation and gender identity disorder. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior, 25,'' 263–278.&lt;/ref&gt; Explanations of the desire to transition based on [[libido]], such as this, have been criticized by some transsexuals who argue that they are unscientific&lt;ref name=&quot;sept2203&quot;&gt;McCloskey, D.

====Mixed samples of MtF transsexuals====
Several teams of researchers have examined the brains or brain functioning of MtF transsexuals, but without breaking down the samples into androphilic (or ''homosexual'') and gynephilic (or ''[[autogynephilic]]'' or ''heterosexual'') types. Such studies have yielded contradictory results, with some studies reporting differences between the (mixed groups of) MtF transsexuals and the non-transsexual controls but with other studies finding no differences.

One brain structure that was examined in MtF transsexuals because of having known sex difference is the [[corpus callosum]], which is larger and of a different shape in men than in women. In 1991, a [[University of Texas]] team reported comparing the corpus callosa of 10 MtF transsexuals, 10 FtM transsexuals, 20 control males, and 20 control females. No significant differences were found.&lt;ref&gt;Emory, L. E., Williams, D. H., Cole, C. M., Amparo, E. G., &amp; Meyer, W. J. (1991). Anatomic variation of the corpus callosum in persons with gender dysphoria. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior, 20,'' 409-417.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a pair of reports, a Dutch team led by Swaab, examined the volume&lt;ref name=Zhou&gt;Zhou, J. N., Hofman, M. A., Gooren, L. J. G., &amp; Swaab, D. F.  (1995).

They found the BSTc to be female-shifted (smaller) among the transsexuals than among the male control subjects.   A subsequent study by Swaab found that the BSTc becomes sexually dimorphic only in adulthood, suggesting that differentiation of the BSTc does not cause transsexualism.&lt;ref&gt;Chung.

''Journal of Neuroscience, 22,'' 1027–1033.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather, the difference in the BSTc might instead be the result of a &quot;failure to develop a male-like gender identity&quot; (p.&amp;nbsp;1032). The BSTc has also been reported to be smaller in other sexually atypical populations unrelated to transsexualism.&lt;ref&gt;Schiltz, K., Witzel, J., Northoff, G., Zierhut, K., Gubka, U., Fellman, H., Kaufmann, J., Tempelmann, C., Wiebking, C., &amp; Bogerts, B. (2007). Brain pathology in pedophilic offenders: Evidence of volume reduction in the right amygdala and related diencephalic structures. ''Archives of General Psychiatry, 64,'' 737–746.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another team of Dutch researchers examined the effects of cross-gender hormone treatment on the brain in 8 male-to-female transsexuals and in 6 female-to-male transsexuals, finding that the hormones changed the sizes of the hypothalamus in a gender consistent manner. Treatment with male hormones shifted the hypothalamus towards the male direction in the same way as in male controls, and treatment with female hormones shifted the hypothalamus towards the female direction in the same way as female controls.&lt;ref&gt;Hulshoff Pol, H. E., Cohen-Kettenis, P. T., Van Haren, N. E., Peper, J. S., Brans, R. G., Cahn, W., et al. (2006). Changing your sex changes your brain: Influences of testosterone and estrogen on adult human brain structure. ''European Journal of Endocrinology, 155''(Suppl. 1), S107-S114.&lt;/ref&gt;  

A 2003 study by Haraldsen and colleagues compared the performance of 52 persons with Gender Identity Disorder (33 from Norway and 19 from the U.S.) with that of 29 control subjects on a series of tests that tap into the functioning of different parts of the brain and on which men and women perform differently. The people in the GID sample &quot;were either homosexually attracted by males or females (n=38), by both (n=3) or by neither (n=9).&quot;  No effects of transsexual status were detected.&lt;ref&gt;Haraldsen, I. R., Opjordsmoen, S., Egeland, T., &amp; Finset, A. (2003). Sex-sensitive performance in untreated patients with early onset gender identity disorder. ''Psychoneuroendocrinology, 28,'' 906–915.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johns Hopkins researchers in 2005 reported on another test of brain functioning using test performance. The study subjects included 27 MtF transsexuals and 16 control men, and the authors reported that no female-typical patterns in cerebral lateralization or cognitive performance were found within the transsexual sample.&lt;ref&gt;Wisniewski, A. B., Prendeville, M. T., &amp; Dobs, A. S. (2005). Handedness, functional cerebral hemispheric lateralization, and cognition in male-to-female transsexuals receiving cross-sex hormone treatment. ''Archives of Sexual Behavior, 34,'' 167–172.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, [[UCLA]] researchers used MRIs to examine a mixed sample of 24 non-hormone-treated male-to-female transsexuals (6 were androphilic, and 18 were gynephilic), comparing them with 30 non-transsexual males and 30 non-transsexual females. The results &quot;revealed that regional gray matter variation in MTF transsexuals is more similar to the pattern found in men than in women,&quot; except for the &quot;right putamen.&quot;. They concluded that &quot;These findings provide new evidence that transsexualism is associated with distinct cerebral pattern, which supports the assumption that brain anatomy plays a role in gender identity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Luders, E., Sanchez, F. J., Toga, A. W., Narr, K. L., Hamilton, L. S., &amp; Vilain, E. (2009). Regional gray matter variation in male-to-female transsexualism. ''Neuroimage, 46,'' 904-907.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gynephilic FtM transsexuals====
Brain-based research has repeatedly shown that female-to-male transsexuals have several male-like characteristics in neuroanatomy. In 2010, a team of neuroscientists compared 18 female-to-male transsexuals with 24 male and 19 female gynephilic controls, using an MRI technique called [[diffusion tensor imaging]] or DTI.&lt;ref&gt;Rametti, G., Carrillo, B., Gómez-Gil, E., Junque, C., Zubiarre-Elorza, L., Segovia, S., Gomez, Á, &amp; Guillamon, A. (2011).

A diffusion tensor imaging study.] ''Journal of Psychiatric Research, 45,'' 199-204. {{doi|10.1016/j.jpsychires.2010.05.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DTI is a specialized technique for visualizing [[white matter]] of the brain, and white matter structure is one of the differences in neuroanatomy between men and women. The study found that the white matter pattern in female-to-male transsexuals was shifted in the direction of biological males, even before the female-to-male transsexuals started taking male hormones (which can also modify brain structure).

Another team of neuroscientists, led by Nawata in Japan, used a technique called [[single-photon emission computed tomography]] (SPECT) compare the regional [[cerebral blood flow]] (rCBF) of 11 female-to-male transsexuals (attracted to women) with that of 9 biological females (attracted to men). Although the study did not include a sample of biological males so that a conclusion of &quot;male shift&quot; could be made, the study did reveal that the female-to-male transsexuals showed significant decrease in blood flow in the left anterior cingulate cortex and a significant increase in the right [[Insular cortex|insula]], two brain regions known to respond during sexual arousal.&lt;ref&gt;Nawata, H., Ogomori, K., Tanaka, M., Nishimura, R., Urashima, H., Yano, R., Takano, K., &amp; Kuwabara, Y. (2010). Regional cerebral blook flow changes in female to male gender identity disorder. ''Psychiatry and Clinical Neurosciences, 64,'' 157–161.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Genetic studies===
In 2008, a study was performed to attempt to find a link between genes and transsexuality. The researchers compared 112 male-to-female transsexuals (both androphilic and gynephilic), mostly already undergoing hormone treatment, with 258 cis-gendered male controls. The male-to-female transsexuals were more likely than non-transsexual males to have a longer version of a receptor gene for the sex hormone androgen or testosterone. The research suggests reduced androgen and androgen signaling contributes to the female gender identity of male to female transsexuals. The authors say that it is possible that a decrease in testosterone levels in the brain during development might result in incomplete masculinization of the brain in male to female transsexuals, resulting in a more feminized brain and a female gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2008/10/27/2401941.htm ABC News Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hare L, Bernard P, Sánchez FJ, Baird PN, Vilain E, Kennedy T, Harley VR (2009) [http://ts-si.org/files/doi101016jbiopsych200808033.pdf Androgen receptor repeat length polymorphism associated with male-to-female transsexualism.] Biol Psychiatry. 65(1):93-96&lt;/ref&gt;

===Terms and typology===
{{Main|Androphilia and gynephilia}}

The use of ''homosexual transsexual'' and related terms have been applied to transgender people since the middle of the 20th century, though concerns about the terms have been voiced since then. [[Harry Benjamin]] said in 1966:
&lt;blockquote&gt;....it seems evident that the question &quot;Is the transsexual homosexual?&quot; must be answered &quot;yes&quot; and &quot; no.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; if his anatomy is considered; &quot;no&quot; if his psyche is given preference.

What would be the situation after corrective surgery has been performed and the sex anatomy now resembles that of a woman? Is the &quot;new woman&quot; still a homosexual man? &quot;Yes,&quot; if pedantry and technicalities prevail. &quot;No&quot; if reason and common sense are applied and if the respective patient is treated as an individual and not as a rubber stamp.&lt;ref name=&quot;benjamin1966&quot;&gt;Benjamin H (1966). ''[http://web.archive.org/web/20090308045151/http://www.symposion.com/ijt/benjamin/ The Transsexual Phenomenon.]'' The Julian Press ASIN: B0007HXA76 (via [[Internet Archive]])&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many sources, including some supporters of the typology, criticize this choice of wording as confusing and degrading. Biologist [[Bruce Bagemihl]] writes &quot;..the point of reference for &quot;heterosexual&quot; or &quot;homosexual&quot; orientation in this nomenclature is solely the individual's genetic sex prior to reassignment (see for example, Blanchard et al. 1987[24], Coleman and Bockting, 1988[25], Blanchard, 1989[26]). These labels thereby ignore the individual’s personal sense of gender identity taking precedence over biological sex, rather than the other way around.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bagemihl&quot;&gt;Bagemihl B.

Use of ''androphilia'' and ''gynephilia'' was proposed and popularized by psychologist [[Ron Langevin]] in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;langevin1983&quot;&gt;Langevin R (1982). Sexual Strands: Understanding and Treating Sexual Anomalies in Men. Routledge, ISBN 978-0-89859-205-4&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist [[Stephen T. Wegener]] writes,  &quot;Langevin makes several concrete suggestions regarding the language used to describe sexual anomalies. For example, he proposes the terms ''gynephilic'' and ''androphilic'' to indicate the type of partner preferred regardless of an individual's [[gender identity]] or dress. Those who are writing and researching in this area would do well to adopt his clear and concise vocabulary.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wegener&quot;&gt;Wegener ST (1984). Male sexual anomalies: the data (review of ''Sexual Strands'') ''APA Review of Books'': Volume 29, Issues 7-12, p. 783. Edwin Garrigues Boring, [[American Psychological Association]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychiatrist [[Anil Aggrawal]] explains why the terms are useful in a glossary: &lt;blockquote&gt;Androphilia – The romantic and/or sexual attraction to adult males. The term, along with gynephilia, is needed to overcome immense difficulties in characterizing the sexual orientation of transmen and transwomen. For instance, it is difficult to decide whether a transman erotically attracted to males is a heterosexual female or a homosexual male; or a transwoman erotically attracted to females is a heterosexual male or a lesbian female. Any attempt to classify them may not only cause confusion but arouse offense among the affected subjects. In such cases, while defining sexual attraction, it is best to focus on the object of their attraction rather than on the sex or gender of the subject.&lt;ref&gt;Aggrawal, Anil (2008). ''Forensic and medico-legal aspects of sexual crimes and unusual sexual practices.'' CRC Press, ISBN 978-1-4200-4308-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Sexologist [[Milton Diamond]], who prefers the correctly-formed term ''gynecophilia'', writes, &quot;The terms heterosexual, homosexual, and bisexual are better used as adjectives, not nouns, and are better applied to behaviors, not people. Diamond has encouraged using the terms androphilic, gynecophilic, and ambiphilic to describe the sexual-erotic partners on prefers (andro = male, gyneco – female, ambi = both, philic = to love). Such terms obviate the need to specify the subject and focus instead on the desired partner. This usage is particularly advantageous when discussing the partners of transsexual or intersexed individuals. These newer terms also do not carry the social weight of the former ones.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;diamond2010&quot;&gt;Diamond M (2010). Sexual orientation and gender identity. In Weiner IB, Craighead EW eds. The Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology, Volume 4. p. 1578. John Wiley and Sons, ISBN 978-0-470-17023-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Rachel Ann Heath writes, &quot;The terms homosexual and heterosexual are awkward, especially when the former is used with, or instead of, gay and lesbian. Alternatively, I use gynephilic and androphilic to refer to sexual preference for women and men, respectively. Gynephilic and androphilic derive from the Greek meaning love of a woman and love of a man respectively. So a gynephilic man is a man who likes women, that is, a heterosexual man, whereas an androphilic man is a man who likes men, that is, a gay man. For completeness, a lesbian is a gynephilic woman, a woman who likes other women. Gynephilic transsexed woman refers to a woman of transsexual background whose sexual preference is for women. Unless homosexual and heterosexual are more readily understood terms in a given context, this more precise terminology will be used throughout the book. Since homosexual, gay, and lesbian are often associated with bigotry and exclusion in many societies, the emphasis on sexual affiliation is both appropriate and socially just.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;heath2006&quot;&gt;Heath RA (2006).

Retrieved on 2007-09-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas previous descriptions of transgenderism included very many combinations of sexual orientation, gender identity, and the desire to cross-dress, Blanchard interprets his evidence as suggesting that there were only two basic phenomena. One phenomenon was androphilia (male homosexuality), which ranged from typical gay men to, when extreme, androphilic or ''homosexual transsexualism.'' The other phenomenon was [[autogynephilia]], which ranged from typical cross-dressers to, when extreme, ''autogynephilic transsexualism'' (or ''non-homosexual transsexualism''). Androphilic male-to-female transsexuals are characterized by sexual attraction to males and by overt and obvious femininity since childhood, whereas autogynephilic transsexuals are characterized by sexual attraction to females (or sometimes to females ''and'' males, or by asexuality) and whose presentations are internal and typically unremarkable until they choose to disclose them, typically later in life. There are community activists who dislike the theory.&lt;ref&gt;

Also the DSM V workgroup has been quoted as saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In contemporary clinical practice, sexual orientation per se plays only a minor role in treatment protocols or decisions. Also, changes as to the preferred gender of sex partner occur during or after treatment (DeCuypere, Janes, &amp; Rubens, 2005; Lawrence, 2005; Schroder &amp; Carroll, 1999). It can be difficult to assess sexual orientation in individuals with a GI diagnosis, as they preoperatively might give incorrect information in order to be approved for hormonal and surgical treatment (Lawrence, 1999). Because sexual orientation subtyping is of interest to researchers in the field, it is recommended that reference to it be addressed in the text, but not as a specifier. It should also be assessed as a dimensional construct.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DSM V Workgroup&quot;&gt;from DSM5.org rationale bullet 18. [http://www.dsm5.org/ProposedRevision/Pages/proposedrevision.aspx?rid=482# bullet 18 under rationale]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Blanchard is a member of the DSM V Sexual and Gender Identity Disorders Work Group chaired by Kenneth J. Zucker. Though it has supporters, the transsexual community has for the most part vehemently rejected Blanchard's typology theory.

''Salzikrum'' is a compound word meaning ''male daughter.''
