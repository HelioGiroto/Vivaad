Believers in [[eugenics]], the Nazis attempted to create a Nordic Aryan master race, or ''[[super race]]''.]]
'''Master race''' (''Herrenvolk'' ([[German language|German]]: ''die Herrenrasse, {{Audio|De-herrenvolk.ogg|das Herrenvolk}})'') was a concept in [[Nazi ideology]] in which the [[Nordic race]], a branch of what in late-19th and early-20th century taxonomy was called the [[Aryan race]], represented an ideal and &quot;'''pure''' [[Race (classification of human beings)|'''race''']]&quot;. In Nazi ideology this &quot;Nordic&quot; race was the purest example of the original racial stock of those who were then called the [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Aryans]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Pomeroy Widney|Widney, Joseph P]]. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=s9UKAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage Race Life of the Aryan Peoples]'' New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls. 1907 In Two Volumes: Volume One—''The Old World''  Volume Two—''The New World'' ISBN B000859S6O See Chapter II—&quot;Original Homeland of the Aryan Peoples&quot; Pages 9-25—the term “Proto-Aryan” was used to describe the people later called [[Proto-Indo-Europeans]]&lt;/ref&gt; whom the Nazis believed to have [[Prehistory|prehistorically]] dwelt on the [[North German Plain]] and to have ultimately originated from the lost continent of [[Atlantis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[Alfred Rosenberg|Rosenberg, Alfred]] ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century|Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts]]'', 1930 (&quot;The Myth of the 20th Century&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Nazis]] declared that the Nordics, (nowadays referred to as the [[Germanic peoples]]), were the true Aryans because they were less racially mixed with &quot;non-native&quot; Indo-European peoples than other people of what were then called the [[Indo-European|Aryan]] peoples (now generally called the [[Indo-European]] peoples), such as the [[Slavic peoples]], the [[Romance peoples]] and the [[Indo-Iranian peoples]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hitler1925&quot;&gt;[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler, Adolf]] ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' 1925&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on this claim that the &quot;Nordic&quot; peoples were superior to all other races, the Nazis believed they were entitled to [[world domination]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hitler1925&quot;/&gt; This concept is known as [[Nordicism]].

The [[Nazism|Nazis]] maintained that for example the Northern [[Russians]] had Nordic traits such as [[human hair color|light hair]] and light [[eye color]] and were racially fit to be a part of the master race. The Nazis also considered some percentages of young [[Slavs]] like some [[Poles]], some [[Czechs]] and some [[Belarusians]] to be sufficient subjects for [[Germanisation]]. However, it was believed that for instance the Polish people were too patriotic and would ultimately resist Germanisation, what resulted in the [[Generalplan Ost]], according to which most of the Slavs from [[East-Central Europe]] were destined to be expelled from the European continent by the [[Third Reich]]. Nevertheless, the Nazi Germans eventually decided to [[Nazi crimes against ethnic Poles|exterminate]] ([[Hunger Plan|largely by starvation]]) the Poles and most of the [[Slavs|Slavic people]] (those of non-Nordic features and refractory to being Germanified) who, along with the Jews and Gypsies, were defined as [[untermensch]]en, dangerous for the [[Germanic peoples]] representing the master race.&lt;ref name = THE&gt;

==Historical background==
The [[Übermensch]] ([[German language|German]]) ([[English language|English]] ''Overman'' or ''Superman'') is a [[concept]] in the [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|philosophy of]] [[Germans|German]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]—he posited the ''Übermensch'' as a goal for humanity to set for itself in his 1883 book ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' ({{lang-de|Also Sprach Zarathustra}}). However, Nietzsche never developed the concept on racial grounds; the philosopher was no racist (nor an anti-semite). Instead, the Übermensch &quot;seems to be the ideal aim of spiritual development more than a biological goal.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Robert C.|coauthors=Higgins, Kathleen C.|title=What Nietzsche Really Said|publisher=Schocken Books, a division fo Random House, Inc.|year=2000|page=47|isbn=0-8052-4157-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nazism distorted the real meaning behind the concept to fit its 'master race' view.

[[Mendelian genetics]] was rediscovered{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} in 1900, providing the basis of the genetic inheritance maps used by Nazi eugenicists to identify persons of the [[Jewish Race|Jewish race]]. In relation to models of inheritance, race is treated by Nazi eugenicists not as a single gene inherited in a mendelian fashion, and is not based upon mendelian inheritance.

By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was posited that the [[Indo-European]]s (then generally also referred to as [[Aryan]]s) made up the highest branch of humanity because their civilization was the most technologically advanced. This reasoning simultaneously intertwined with [[Nordicism]] which proclaimed the &quot;[[Nordic race]]&quot; as the &quot;purest&quot; form of said [[Aryan race]]. As such, this &quot;Nordic race&quot; came to be regarded by the [[Right-wing politics|right wing]] in [[Europe]], [[Northern America]], [[Southern South America]] and [[Australasia]] to be a &quot;master race&quot; because of its supposed innate leadership qualities and advancements in civilization.  Today, this view is regarded as [[scientific racism]] because it contradicts [[racial equality]] by positing that one [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] is superior to other races.

===Eugenics===
[[Eugenics]] came to play a prominent role in this racial thought as a way to improve and maintain the &quot;purity&quot; of the Aryan master race. Eugenics was a concept adhered to by many thinkers in the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s, such as [[Margaret Sanger]],&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Sanger, quoted in {{cite book|last=Katz|first=Esther|coauthors =Engelman, Peter|title=The Selected Papers of Margaret Sanger|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Champaign, IL|year=2002|page=319|isbn=978-0-252-02737-6|quote=Our...campaign for Birth Control is not merely of eugenic value, but is practically identical in ideal with the final aims of Eugenics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Franks|first=Angela|title=Margaret Sanger's eugenic legacy|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, NC|year=2005|page=30|isbn=978-0-7864-2011-7|quote=...her commitment to eugenics was constant...until her death}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie Stopes]], [[H.

Human “[[dog and pony show]]” type events (organized by advocates of eugenics), where men and women appeared on stage in swimsuits in eugenic competitions (only Nordic Aryans were allowed to enter) to be evaluated for their physical and mental qualities as [[marriage]] partners were common throughout Europe and North America in the 1920s. The Nazis took this concept to the limit by [[Lebensborn|establishing a program]] to systematically genetically enhance the Nordic Aryans themselves through a program of [[Nazi eugenics]], based on the eugenics laws of the [[United States]] state of [[California]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2003/11/09/ING9C2QSKB1.DTL ''San Francisco Chronicle'' Sunday, November 9, 2003—&quot;Eugenics and the Nazis – the California connection&quot; by Edwin Black:]&lt;/ref&gt; to create a ''[[super race]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;hitler1925&quot;/&gt;

===White racist hierarchy===
The modern concept of the ''master race'' in general derives from 19th-century [[racial theory]], which posited a [[hierarchy]] of races based on [[Human skin color|darkness of skin color]].  This 19th-century concept was largely initially developed by Count [[Arthur de Gobineau|Joseph Arthur De Gobineau]].  Gobineau's basic concept, as further refined and developed in [[Nazism]], places the [[Color terminology for race|black]] [[Australoid race|Aboriginal Australians]] and &quot;[[Negroid race|African savages]]&quot; at the bottom of the hierarchy, while the [[Color terminology for race|white]] Northern and Western European Aryans (consisting of Germans, Swedish, Icelanders, Norwegians, Danish, British, French, Irish and Dutch) were at the top; white [[Olive skin|olive-skinned]] Southern Europeans (consisting of the Spanish, Italians, Greeks and Portuguese, i.e. those of what is called the [[Mediterranean race]], which was regarded as another subrace of the Caucasian race) in the upper middle ranks; [[Slavs]] (Even though the Slavs are white and of [[Indo-European]] ancestry, the Nazis placed them lower on the scale because they were regarded as primarily of the [[Alpine race]] rather than the Nordic race, and thus fit only to be [[peasant]]s. Also, the Nazis wanted to conquer them and take their land so [[Nazi Germany]] could obtain [[Lebensraum]]—[[Nazi propaganda]] referred to the Slavs as the ''[[Untermensch]]en'' [&quot;subhumans&quot;].) and those of the olive-skinned [[Semitic race]] (another subrace of the Caucasian race) in the middle ranks (it was because the [[Jews]], being Semites, were clever that [[Anti-Semitism|they were so dangerous]]—they had their own plan for [[Jewish world domination]], a [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] that had to be opposed by all thoughtful Aryans, declared the Nazis&lt;ref name=&quot;hitler1925&quot;/&gt;); and those of the [[Color terminology for race|yellow]] [[Mongoloid race]]&lt;ref&gt;However, in 1936, Adolf Hitler declared that the [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Japanese people|Japanese]] were ''[[honorary Aryan]]s''.&lt;/ref&gt; (including its offshoots the [[Color terminology for race|brown]] [[Malayan race]] and the [[Color terminology for race|red]] [[American Indian race]]), the [[Dravidian race]], the [[Hamitic race]] (regarded as another subrace of the Caucasian race), and [[Multiracial|mixed-race]] people such as [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasians]], the [[Bronze race|bronze]] [[Mestizos]], [[Mulatto]]s, [[Afro-Asian]]s, and [[Zambo]]s in the lower middle ranks.  

Even after the defeat of Nazism in 1945, this racist hierarchy continued to be believed in by most conservative [[white people]], both educated and uneducated, in the [[Western world]] until the mid-1960s.  In the [[United States]] after World War II, the racist hierarchy continued to be encoded into law by statutes against [[miscegenation]], [[Aryan paragraph#In the United States|Aryan clause]]s in real estate deeds, [[Immigration Act of 1924|restrictions on non-Nordic immigration]], and [[racial segregation]] in [[Southern United States|The South]]. By the mid-1960s, because of the [[civil rights movement]], [[racial equality]] had became the norm and the aforementioned laws had been repealed.  Racial equality has been the norm ever since.  The one holdout was the [[Union of South Africa]], where [[apartheid]] did not end until 1992.

=='Master race' in the United States==
In the [[United States of America|United States]], the concept of 'master race' arose within the context of master-slave race relations in the slavery-based society of historical America – particularly in the [[Southern United States|South]] in the mid-19th century. It was based upon both the experience of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the [[Scientific_racist#USA:_slavery_justified|pseudo-scientific justifications for racial slavery]], but also on the relations between whites in the South and North, particularly during the [[American Civil War]].

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] credits [[William J. Grayson]] with having first used the phrase master race, in his poem ''The Hireling and the Slave'' (1855):
{{cquote|For these great ends hath Heaven’s supreme command
Brought the black savage from his native land,

Trains for each purpose his barbarian mind,

By slavery tamed, enlightened, and refined;

Instructs him, from a master-race, to draw

Wise modes of polity and forms of law,

Imbues his soul with faith, his heart with love,

Shapes all his life by dictates from above }}
where the phrase denotes the relation between the white masters and negro slaves.
By 1860 Virginian author [[George Fitzhugh]] was using the &quot;challenging phrase “master race”, which soon came to mean considerably more than the ordinary master-slave relationship&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Wish, Harvey ''George Fitzhugh: propagandist of the Old South'' Louisian State University Press (1943) p270&lt;/ref&gt; Fitzhugh, along with a number of southern writers, used the term to differentiate Southerners from Northerners, based on the [[dichotomy]] that Southerners were supposedly descendents of [[Normans]] / [[Cavaliers]] whereas Northerners were descendents of [[Anglo-Saxons]] / [[Puritans]].&lt;ref&gt;see Watson jr, Ritchie Devon ''Normans and Saxons: Southern Race Mythology and the Intellectual History of the American Civil War'' Louisiana State University Press (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861, the Southern press bragged that Northern soldiers would &quot;encounter a master race&quot; and knowledge of this fact would cause Northern soldiers' &quot;knees to tremble&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Grant and Lee: victorious American and vanquished Virginian Praeger (2008) p15&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Richmond Whig'' in 1862 proclaimed that &quot;the master race of this continent is found in the southern states&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Conkling, Henry ''An Inside View of the Rebellion: An American Citizen's Textbook'' (1864) p7&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1863 the ''Richmond Examiner'' stated that &quot;there are slave races born to serve, master races born to govern&quot;&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Senate documents, otherwise publ. as Public documents and Executive documents: 14th Congress, 1st session-48th congress, 2nd session and special session  (1869) p670&lt;/ref&gt;

In the works of John H. Van Evrie, a Northern supporter of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], the term was interchangeable with [[white supremacy]], notably in ''White Supremacy and Negro Subordination, Or, Negroes a Subordinate Race and (so-called) slavery its normal condition'' (1861). In ''Subgeneation: the theory of the normal relations of the races; an answer to miscegenation'' (1864) Van Evrie created the words “subgen”  to describe what he considered to be the &quot;inferior races&quot; and “subgeneation” to describe the ‘normal’ relation of such inferior races to whites, something which he considered to be the &quot;very [[Cornerstone Speech|corner-stone]] of  democracy&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;''Subgeneation'' p42&lt;/ref&gt; but these words never entered the dictionary.

Following the defeat of the Confederacy the term master race immediately fell into disuse.

==Nordicism==
[[Image:NordischNordic.JPG|thumb|200px|''Meyers Blitz-Lexikon'' ([[Weimar Republic|Leipzig, 1932]]) shows a famous [[Germany|German]] war hero ([[Karl von Müller]]) as an example of the Nordic type.]]
{{Main|Nordic race}}
The origins of the Nazi version of the theory of the master race were in 19th-century racial theories of Count [[Arthur de Gobineau|Joseph Arthur De Gobineau]], who argued that cultures degenerated when distinct races mixed. It was believed at this time that [[Southern Europe]]an and [[Eastern Europe]]an peoples were racially mixed with non-European [[Moors]] from across the [[Mediterranean Sea]], while [[Northern Europe]]ans and [[Western Europe]]ans remained pure. Proponents of Nordic theory further argued that Nordic peoples had developed innate toughness and determination due to the harsh, challenging climate in which they evolved. The racial ideal of these theorists was the tall, [[blond]] and [[Eye color|light eyed]] Nordic individual.

The philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] was one of the earliest proponents of a theory presenting a hierarchical racial model of history, attributing civilisational primacy to the &quot;white races&quot; who gained their sensitivity and intelligence by refinement in the rigorous [[north]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;The highest civilisation and culture, apart from the ancient Indians and [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptians]], are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmins, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is because necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume II, Section 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the [[abolitionist]] movement in the United States. He describes the treatment of &quot;[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches&quot; as &quot;belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', &quot;On Ethics,&quot; Sec. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Frank]], Hitler's personal lawyer, stated that Hitler carried a copy of Schopenhauer's book ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' with him wherever he went throughout [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nobeliefs.com/hitler-myths.htm Myths About Adolf Hitler:]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, such theorists usually accepted that considerable variety of hair and eye colour existed even within the racial categories they recognised. Contrary to the popular urban legend myth, the [[Nazi]]s did not discriminate against ''&quot;Aryans&quot;'' who did not have blonde hair or light-eyes, or had only one of these features. [[Adolf Hitler]] and other Nazi officials had dark hair and were still considered to be [[Aryan race|Aryan]].&lt;!-- please do not add information about the (disputed) colour of Hitler's eyes. It is irrelevant to the issue, and has led to repeated pointless changes and reversions --&gt;

The postulated [[Supremacism|superiority]] of these people was said to make them born leaders, or a &quot;master race.&quot; Other authors included [[Guido von List]], and his associate [[Lanz von Liebenfels]], and the [[United Kingdom|British]] racial theorist [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], all of whom felt that the white race and [[Germanic peoples]] were superior to others, and that given the [[Racial purity|purification]] of the white race and German people from the races who were &quot;polluting&quot; it, a new [[Millenarianism|millennarian]] age of Aryan god-men would arrive.

Nazi policy stressed the superiority of the [[Nordic race]], a sub-race of the [[White_people#19th_and_20th_century:_the_.22Caucasian_race.22|white Caucasian race]] European population defined by [[anthropometric]] models of racial difference. The Nordic race was said to comprise only the [[Germanic people]]s ([[Germans]], [[Norwegians]], [[Danes]], [[Swedes]], [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Finland-Swedes]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.feldgrau.com/articles.php?ID=19 | Finns were not originally considered to be of Nordic race. Therefore the goal of the [[SS]] recruitment office was to recruit Swedish-speaking Finns (preferably National Socialists), whom they regarded as Nordic.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Estonian Swedes|Estonia-Swedes]], [[Faroese people|Faroese]], [[Icelanders]], [[British people|British/Irish and [[Dutch people|Dutch]] people).

==Aryanism and Nazism==
{{Main|Aryan|Aryan race}}
{{see also|Aryanisation|The Myth of the Twentieth Century}}
The term [[Aryan]] derives from the [[Sanskrit]] word ({{unicode|ā́rya}}), which derived from ''arya'', the original [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] [[endonym|autonym]]. Also, [[Name of Iran|the word ''Iran'']] is the [[Farsi language|Persian]] word for land/place of the ''Aryan''&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1996&quot;&gt;Wiesehofer, Joseph ''Ancient Persia'' New York:1996 I.B. Tauris&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Iranian peoples]]).

Following the ideas of Gobineau and others, the Nazi theorist [[Alfred Rosenberg]] determined that these people, who, he claimed, were originally from [[Atlantis]], were a dynamic [[warrior people]] who dwelt in [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]] in northern climates on the [[North German Plain]], from which they migrated riding their [[chariots]] southeast, eventually reaching [[Ukraine]], [[Iran]], and then [[India]]. They were supposed to be the ancestors of the ancient [[Germanic tribes]], who shared their warrior values. Rosenberg claimed that [[Christianity]] was an alien [[Semitic]] [[master-slave morality|slave-morality]] inappropriate to the warrior Aryan master race and thus supported a melange of aspects of [[Hindu]] [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] teachings (both of these religions having been organised by Aryans), along with pre-Christian European [[Odinism|Odinistic paganism]], which he also considered to be distinctively Aryan in character.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In [[Nazi Germany]], a so-called [[Anti-miscegenation laws#Nazi Germany|mixed marriage]] of an &quot;Aryan&quot; with an &quot;[[Untermensch]]&quot; was forbidden in order to maintain the purity of the [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] master race, [[eugenics]] was practiced. In order to eliminate &quot;defective&quot; citizens, the [[T-4 Euthanasia Program]] was administered by [[Karl Brandt (Nazi physician)|Karl Brandt]] to rid the country of the [[Mental retardation|mentally retarded]] or those born with [[genetic deficiencies]], as well as those deemed to be racially inferior. Additionally, a programme of [[compulsory sterilisation]] was undertaken which resulted in the forced operations of hundreds of thousands of individuals. Many of these [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|policies]] are generally seen as being related to what eventually became known as [[the Holocaust]].
&lt;ref name=&quot;THE &quot;/&gt;

The Nazis also took measures to increase the number of Nordics in Germany. The [[Lebensborn]] program was only open to German women who fit the Nordic profile. During the Nazi-Soviet [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupation of Poland]], the Nazis took young Nordic Polish children back to these Lebensborn houses so they could be raised as Germans.

==Mediterranean race==
{{Main|Mediterranean race}}
The fact that the [[Mediterranean race]] is responsible for the most important of ancient western civilisations was a problem for the promoters of Nordic superiority. According to [[Giuseppe Sergi]], the Mediterranean race was the &quot;greatest race of the world&quot; and was singularly responsible for the most accomplished civilisations of ancient times, including those of  [[Ancient Persia|Persia]],     [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Carthage]],  and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. The Mediterranean race was also a major influence to the outside world in the modern era, the most significant being [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] when they became [[Spanish empire|global empires]], influencing most of the [[Americas]]. Spain is also responsible for being one of the first nations in discovering and colonising the [[Americas]] by its [[conquistadors]].

[[C. G. Seligman]] also stated that &quot;it must, I think, be recognised that the Mediterranean race has actually more achievements to its credit than any other race, since it is responsible for by far the greater part of Mediterranean civilisation, certainly before 1000 BC (and probably much later), and so shaped not only the Aegean cultures, but those of Western as well as the greater part of Eastern Mediterranean lands, while the culture of their near relatives, the Hamitic pre-dynastic [[Egyptians]], formed the basis of that of Egypt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'', Vol. 54. (January  – June , 1924), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazis explained this away by claiming that the elite warriors of the [[aristocracy]] of [[Ancient Greece]], of [[Ancient Rome]], and of the [[Spanish Empire]] were Nordic Aryans who had migrated south. However, they did admit that those of the Mediterranean race in general and notably such [[genius]]es of the Mediterranean race as [[Michaelangelo]] and [[Leonardo da Vinci]] tended to be more [[Creativity|creative]] than Nordics.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

==Master race in fiction==

Aryan master race ideology was common throughout the educated and literate strata of the [[Western world]] until after [[World War II]]. Such theories were commonplace in early-20th century. [[fantasy literature]]

In the original 1920s and 1930s, ''[[Buck Rogers]]'' stories and [[Comic strip|newspaper cartoons]], Buck Rogers, in his adventures in the 25th century that take place on [[Earth]], fights for ''[[European Americans|Aryan-Americans]]'' from the liberated zone around [[Niagara, New York]], against the ''Red Mongol Empire,'' a Chinese empire of the future which rules most of [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Collected Works of Buck Rogers in the 25th Century'' 1969 Chelsea House—Introduction by [[Ray Bradbury]]—Reprints of the original [[Buck Rogers]] comic strips&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, both educational and storybooks for children in Germany taught their readers about the master race. In the Sun Koh science fiction series where Koh says things like &quot;My forefathers were Aryan&quot;. In a story about [[Atlantis]], Koh says, &quot;If our Atlantis once again rises out of the sea, then we will get from there the blond, steel-hard [[Man (word)|men]] with the pure blood and will create with them the master race, which will finally rule the earth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;voss&quot;&gt;Julia Voss, [http://www.faz.net/s/Rub71E8665493FD4CB29D4E0759DF21C32C/Doc~E63B66F19501A41828F6A22377304DC05~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html &quot;Jim Knopf rettet die Evolutionstheorie&quot;] ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'' (December 16, 2008).

In ''[[Doctor Who]],'' the Doctor's frequent enemies, the [[Daleks]], consider themselves a master race who must purge the universe of all others; Terry Nation explicitly modeled them on the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;http://nzdwfc.tetrap.com/archive/tsv51/terrynation.html | Terry Nation – Writing For The Screen, By Paul Scoones&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2009 special ''[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]'', when [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] transforms the entire human race into copies of himself, he claims that there is no human race, but only &quot;the Master race&quot;.

In the [[Harry Potter]] series, while the parallels were not originally intentional, there is much similarity between Voldemort's Pureblood ideology and the Master Race ideology of the Nazis, with wizards being &quot;pure&quot; and anyone with Muggle (non-wizard) blood being considered &quot;half-blood&quot; or &quot;mudblood&quot;, a word treated the way a racial slur would be treated in the real world ([[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazis]] call non-white people ''mud people'').
