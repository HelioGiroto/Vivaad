[[File:Woher kommen wir Wer sind wir Wohin gehen wir.jpg|thumb|375px|''[[Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?]]''&lt;br /&gt;One of Post-Impressionist [[Paul Gauguin]]'s most famous paintings.]]
The '''meaning of life''' is a philosophical question concerning the [[intrinsic value (ethics)|significance]] of [[life]] or [[existence]] in general. It can also be expressed in different forms, such as &quot;Why are we here?&quot;, &quot;What is life all about?&quot;, and &quot;What is the purpose of existence?&quot; It has been the subject of much [[philosophical]], [[scientific]], and [[theological]] speculation throughout history. There have been a large number of proposed answers to these questions from many different [[cultural]] and [[ideological]] backgrounds.

The meaning of life in the philosophical and religious conceptions of [[existence]], [[social ties]], [[consciousness]], and [[happiness]], and borders on many other issues, such as [[linguistic meaning|symbolic meaning]], [[ontology]], [[value (philosophy)|value]], purpose, [[ethics]], [[good and evil]], [[free will]], the [[Existence of God|existence of a or multiple Gods]], [[conceptions of God]], the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], and the [[afterlife]]. Scientific contributions focus primarily on describing related [[empiricism|empirical]] [[fact]]s about the [[universe]], exploring the context and parameters concerning the 'how' of life. Science also studies and can provide recommendations for the [[positive psychology|pursuit of well-being]] and a related [[science of morality|conception of morality]]. An alternative, [[humanistic]] approach poses the question &quot;What is the meaning of ''my'' life?&quot; The value of the question pertaining to the purpose of life may coincide with the achievement of [[Mysticism|ultimate reality]], or a feeling of [[oneness (mysticism)|oneness]], or even a feeling of [[sacred]]ness.

These questions have resulted in a wide range of competing answers and arguments, from [[scientific]] theories, to [[philosophical]], [[theological]], and [[spirituality|spiritual]] explanations.

==Western philosophical perspectives==
The philosophical perspectives on the meaning of life are those ideologies which explain life in terms of ideals or abstractions defined by humans.

===Ancient Greek philosophy===
[[File:Sanzio 01 Plato Aristotle.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Plato and Aristotle in ''[[The School of Athens]]'' fresco, by [[Raphael]]. Plato is pointing heavenwards to the sky, and Aristotle is gesturing to the world.]]

====Platonism====
{{Main|Platonism}}
[[Plato]] was one of the earliest, most influential philosophers — mostly for [[philosophical idealism|idealism]] - a belief in the existence of [[universals (metaphysics)|universals]]. In the [[Theory of Forms]], universals do not physically exist, like objects, but as  heavenly forms. In ''[[Plato's Republic|The Republic]]'', the [[Socrates]] character's [[dialogue]] describes the [[Form of the Good]]. 

In Platonism, the meaning of life is in attaining the highest form of knowledge, which is the [[Platonic idealism|Idea]] ([[Platonic realism|Form]]) of the Good, from which all good and just things derive utility and value. Human beings are duty-bound to pursue the good.

====Aristotelianism====
{{Main|Aristotelian ethics}}
[[Aristotle]], an apprentice of [[Plato]], was another early and influential philosopher, who argued that ethical knowledge is not ''certain'' knowledge (such as [[metaphysics]] and [[epistemology]]), but is ''general'' knowledge. Because it is not a [[theoretical]] discipline, a person had to study and practice in order to become &quot;good&quot;; thus if the person were to become [[virtuous]], he could not simply study what virtue ''is'', he had to ''be'' virtuous, via virtuous activities. To do this, Aristotle established what is virtuous:
{{quote|Every skill and every inquiry, and similarly, every action and choice of action, is thought to have some good as its object. This is why the good has rightly been defined as the object of all endeavor [...]&lt;br&gt;Everything is done with a goal, and that goal is &quot;good&quot;.|[[Nicomachean Ethics]] 1.1}}

Yet, if action A is done towards achieving goal B, then goal B also would have a goal, goal C, and goal C also would have a goal, and so would continue this pattern, until something stopped its [[infinite regression]]. Aristotle's solution is the ''[[Summum bonum|Highest Good]]'', which is desirable for its own sake, it is its own goal. The Highest Good is not desirable for the sake of achieving some other good, and all other &quot;goods&quot; desirable for its sake. This involves achieving ''[[eudaemonia]]'', usually translated as &quot;happiness&quot;, &quot;well-being&quot;, &quot;flourishing&quot;, and &quot;excellence&quot;.
{{quote|What is the highest good in all matters of action? To the name, there is almost complete agreement; for uneducated and educated alike call it happiness, and make happiness identical with the good life and successful living. They disagree, however, about the meaning of happiness.|[[Nicomachean Ethics]] 1.4}}

====Cynicism====
In the [[Hellenistic period]], the [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynic]] philosophers said that the purpose of life is living a life of [[Virtue]] that agrees with [[Nature]]. Happiness depends upon being self-sufficient and master of one's mental attitude; suffering is consequence of false judgments of value, which cause negative [[emotions]] and a concomitant vicious character.

The Cynical life rejects conventional desires for [[wealth]], [[power (sociology)|power]], [[health]], and [[celebrity|fame]], by being free of the possessions acquired in pursuing the conventional.&lt;ref&gt;Kidd, I., &quot;''Cynicism'',&quot; in ''The Concise Encyclopedia of Western Philosophy.'' (ed. [[J.O. Urmson]] and [[Jonathan Rée]]), Routledge. (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, A.A., &quot;''The Socratic Tradition: Diogenes, Crates, and Hellenistic Ethics,''&quot; in ''The Cynics: The Cynic Movement in Antiquity and Its Legacy.'' (ed. Branham and Goulet-Cazé), University of California Press, (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; As reasoning creatures, people could achieve happiness via rigorous training, by living in a way natural to [[human]] beings. The [[world]] equally belongs to everyone, so [[suffering]] is caused by false judgments of what is valuable and what is worthless per the [[tradition|customs]] and [[convention (norm)|conventions]] of [[society]].

====Cyrenaicism====
[[Cyrenaicism]], founded by [[Aristippus of Cyrene]], was an early Socratic school that emphasized only one side of Socrates's teachings—that happiness is one of the ends of moral action and that pleasure is the supreme good; thus a [[hedonistic]] world view, wherein bodily gratification is more intense than mental pleasure. Cyrenaics prefer immediate gratification to the long-term gain of delayed gratification; denial is unpleasant unhappiness.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Cyrenaics.&quot; Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy. The University of Tennessee At Martin. 4 Nov. 2007 &lt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Cyrenaics and the Origin of Hedonism.&quot; Hedonism.org. BLTC. 4 Nov. 2007 &lt;http://www.hedonism.org&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Epicureanism====
{{Main|Epicureanism}}
[[File:Epicurus Louvre.jpg|left|thumb|150px|Bust of [[Epicurus]] leaning against his disciple [[Metrodorus of Lampsacus (the younger)|Metrodorus]] in the [[Louvre|Louvre Museum]].]]
To [[Epicurus]], the greatest good is in seeking modest pleasures, to attain tranquility and freedom from fear ([[ataraxia]]) via knowledge, friendship, and virtuous, temperate living; bodily pain ([[aponia]]) is absent through one's knowledge of the workings of the world and of the limits of one's desires. Combined, freedom from pain and freedom from fear are happiness in its highest form. Epicurus' lauded enjoyment of simple pleasures is quasi-ascetic &quot;abstention&quot; from sex and the appetites:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;When we say ... that pleasure is the end and aim, we do not mean the pleasures of the prodigal or the pleasures of sensuality, as we are understood to do, by some, through ignorance, prejudice or wilful misrepresentation. By pleasure we mean the absence of pain in the body and of trouble in the soul. It is not by an unbroken succession of drinking bouts and of revelry, not by sexual lust, nor the enjoyment of fish, and other delicacies of a luxurious table, which produce a pleasant life; it is sober reasoning, searching out the grounds of every choice and avoidance, and banishing those beliefs through which the greatest tumults take possession of the soul.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Epicurus]], &quot;Letter to Menoeceus&quot;, contained in Diogenes Laertius, ''Lives of Eminent Philosophers'', Book X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Epicurean meaning of life rejects immortality and mysticism; there is a soul, but it is as mortal as the body. There is no [[afterlife]], yet, one need not fear death, because &quot;Death is nothing to us; for that which is dissolved, is without sensation, and that which lacks sensation is nothing to us.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Russel&quot;&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (1946). ''[[History of Western Philosophy (Russell)|A History of Western Philosophy]]'', New York: Simon and Schuster; London: George Allen and Unwin&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stoicism====
[[Stoicism]] teaches that living according to reason and virtue is to be in harmony with the universe's divine order, entailed by one's recognition of the universal ''[[logos]]'' (reason), an essential value of all people. The meaning of life is &quot;freedom from [[suffering]]&quot; through ''apatheia'' (Gr: απαθεια), that is, being [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] and having &quot;clear judgement&quot;, ''not'' indifference.

Stoicism's prime directives are [[virtue]], [[reason]], and [[natural law]], abided to develop personal self-control and mental fortitude as means of overcoming destructive [[emotion]]s. The Stoic does not seek to extinguish emotions, only to avoid emotional troubles, by developing clear judgement and inner calm through diligently practiced logic, reflection, and concentration.

The Stoic ethical foundation is that &quot;good lies in the state of the soul&quot;, itself, exemplified in [[wisdom]] and self-control, thus improving one's spiritual well-being: &quot;''Virtue'' consists in a ''will'' which is in agreement with Nature.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Russel&quot;/&gt; The principle applies to one's personal relations thus: &quot;to be free from anger, envy, and jealousy&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Russel&quot;/&gt;

===Enlightenment philosophy===
{{Further|Enlightenment philosophy}}
The [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and the [[colonialism|colonial era]] both changed the nature of European philosophy and exported it worldwide. Devotion and subservience to God were largely replaced by notions of inalienable natural rights and the potentialities of reason, and universal ideals of love and compassion gave way to civic notions of freedom, equality, and citizenship. The meaning of life changed as well, focusing less on humankind's relationship to God and more on the relationship between individuals and their society. This era is filled with theories that equate meaningful existence with the social order.

====Classical liberalism====
[[Classical liberalism]] is a set of ideas that arose in the 17th and 18th centuries, out of conflicts between a growing, wealthy, propertied class and the established aristocratic and religious orders that dominated Europe. Liberalism cast humans as beings with inalienable natural [[individual rights|rights]] (including the right to retain the wealth generated by one's own work), and sought out means to balance rights across society. Broadly speaking, it considers [[individualism|individual]] [[liberty]] to be the most important goal,&lt;ref&gt;A: &quot;'Liberalism' is defined as a social ethic that advocates liberty, and equality in general.&quot; – [[C. A. J. (Tony) Coady]] ''Distributive Justice'', A Companion to Contemporary Political Philosophy, editors Goodin, Robert E. and Pettit, Philip. Blackwell Publishing, 1995, p.440. B: &quot;Liberty is not a means to a higher political end. It is itself the highest political end.&quot; – [[John Dalberg-Acton, 1st Baron Acton|Lord Acton]]&lt;/ref&gt; because only through ensured liberty are the other inherent rights protected.

There are many forms and derivations of liberalism, but their central conceptions of the meaning of life trace back to three main ideas. Early thinkers such as [[John Locke]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] and [[Adam Smith]] saw humankind beginning in the [[state of nature]], then finding meaning for existence through labor and property, and using [[social contracts]] to create an environment that supports those efforts.

====Kantianism====
[[File:Immanuel Kant (portrait).jpg|right|125px|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]] is regarded as one of the most influential thinkers of the late [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].]]
[[Kantianism]] is a philosophy based on the [[ethical]], [[epistemological]], and [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] works of [[Immanuel Kant]]. Kant is known for his [[deontological]] theory where there is a single moral obligation, the &quot;[[Categorical Imperative]]&quot;, derived from the concept of [[duty]]. Kantians believe all actions are performed in accordance with some underlying [[maxim (philosophy)|maxim]] or principle, and for actions to be ethical, they must adhere to the categorical imperative.

Simply put, the test is that one must universalize the maxim (imagine that all people acted in this way) and then see if it would still be possible to perform the maxim in the world without contradiction. In ''Groundwork'', Kant gives the example of a person who seeks to borrow money without intending to pay it back. This is a contradiction because if it were a universal action, no person would lend money anymore as he knows that he will never be paid back. The maxim of this action, says Kant, results in a contradiction in conceivability (and thus contradicts perfect duty).

Kant also denied that the consequences of an act in any way contribute to the moral worth of that act, his reasoning being that the physical world is outside one's full control and thus one cannot be held accountable for the events that occur in it.

===19th century philosophy===
{{Further|19th century philosophy}}

====Utilitarianism====
[[File:Jeremy Bentham by Henry William Pickersgill detail.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Jeremy Bentham]]
The origins of [[utilitarianism]] can be traced back as far as [[Epicurus]], but, as a school of thought, it is credited to [[Jeremy Bentham]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Frederick (2003). ''Classical Utilitarianism from Hume to Mill''. Routledge, p. 28. ISBN 0-415-22094-7 &quot;It was Hume and Bentham who then reasserted most strongly the Epicurean doctrine concerning utility as the basis of justice.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; who found that &quot;nature has placed mankind under the governance of two sovereign masters, pain and pleasure&quot;, then, from that moral insight, deriving the ''Rule of Utility'': &quot;that the good is whatever brings the greatest happiness to the greatest number of people&quot;. He defined the meaning of life as the &quot;[[greatest happiness principle]]&quot;.

[[Jeremy Bentham]]'s foremost proponent was [[James Mill]], a significant philosopher in his day, and father of [[John Stuart Mill]]. The younger Mill was educated per Bentham's principles, including transcribing and summarizing much of his father's work.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mill&quot;&gt;Mill, John Stuart. ''On Liberty'', ed. Himmelfarb. Penguin Classics, 1974, Ed.'s introduction, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nihilism====
[[Nihilism]] suggests that life is without objective meaning.

[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] characterized nihilism as emptying the world, and especially human existence, of meaning, purpose, comprehensible truth, and essential value; succinctly, nihilism is the process of &quot;the devaluing of the highest values&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bindé&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jérôme Bindé |title=The Future Of Values: 21st-Century Talks |publisher=Berghahn Books |year=2004 |isbn=1-57181-442-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seeing the nihilist as a natural result of the idea that [[God is dead]], and insisting it was something to overcome, his questioning of the nihilist's life-negating values returned meaning to the Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reginster&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Bernard Reginster |title=The Affirmation of Life: Nietzsche on Overcoming Nihilism |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-674-02199-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:MARTIN John Great Day of His Wrath.jpg|thumb|left|''[[The End of the World (painting)|The End of the World]]'', by John Martin.]]
To [[Martin Heidegger]], nihilism is the movement whereby &quot;[[being]]&quot; is forgotten, and is transformed into value, in other words, the reduction of being to exchange value.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bindé&quot;/&gt; Heidegger, in accordance with Nietzsche, saw in the so-called &quot;[[God is dead|death of God]]&quot; a potential source for nihilism:
''&lt;blockquote&gt;If God, as the supra-sensory ground and goal, of all reality, is dead; if the supra-sensory world of the Ideas has suffered the loss of its obligatory, and above it, its vitalizing and up-building power, then nothing more remains to which Man can cling, and by which he can orient himself.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, &quot;The Word of Nietzsche,&quot; 61.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;''

The French philosopher [[Albert Camus]] asserts that the absurdity of the [[human condition]] is that people search for external values and meaning in a world which has none, and is indifferent to them. Camus writes of value-nihilists such as [[The Stranger (novel)|Meursault]],&lt;ref&gt;Camus (1946) ''L'Etranger''&lt;/ref&gt; but also of values in a nihilistic world, that people can instead strive to be &quot;heroic nihilists&quot;, living with dignity in the face of absurdity, living with &quot;secular saintliness&quot;, fraternal solidarity, and rebelling against and transcending the world's indifference.&lt;ref&gt;Camus (1955) ''The Myth of Sisyphus''&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century philosophy===
{{Further|20th century philosophy}}
The current era has seen radical changes in conceptions of human nature. The knowledge uncovered by modern science has effectively rewritten the relationship of humankind to the natural world, advances in medicine and technology have freed us from some of the limitations and ailments of previous eras,&lt;ref&gt;For example, see [[hygiene]], [[antibiotic]] and [[vaccination]].&lt;/ref&gt; and philosophy—particularly following the [[linguistic turn]]—altered how the relationships people have with themselves and each other is conceived.  Questions about the meaning of life have seen equally radical changes, from attempts to reevaluate human existence in biological and scientific terms (as in [[#Pragmatism|pragmatism]] and [[#Logical positivism|logical positivism]]), to efforts to meta-theorize about meaning-making as an activity ([[#Existentialism|existentialism]], [[#Secular humanism|secular humanism]]).

====Pragmatism====
[[Pragmatism]], originated in the late-19th-century U.S., to concern itself (mostly) with [[truth]], positing that &quot;only in struggling with the environment&quot; do data, and derived theories, have meaning, and that ''consequences'', like utility and practicality, are also components of truth. Moreover, pragmatism posits that ''anything'' useful and practical is not always true, arguing that what most contributes to the most human good in the long course is true. In practice, theoretical claims must be ''practically verifiable'', i.e. one should be able to predict and test claims, and, that, ultimately, the needs of mankind should guide human intellectual inquiry.

Pragmatic philosophers suggest that the practical, useful understanding of life is more important than searching for an impractical abstract truth about life. [[William James]] argued that truth could be made, but not sought.&lt;ref name=&quot;James&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=William James |authorlink=William James |title=The Meaning of Truth |publisher=Prometheus Books |year=1909 |isbn=1-57392-138-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Corti&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Walter Robert Corti |title=The Philosophy of William James |publisher=Meiner Verlag |year=1976 |isbn=3-7873-0352-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; To a pragmatist, the meaning of life is discoverable only via experience.

====Existentialism====
{{Main|Meaning (existential)}}
[[File:The Scream.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Edvard Munch]]'s ''[[The Scream]]'', a representation of [[existential angst]].]]
According to existentialism, each man and each woman creates the essence (meaning) of his and her life; life is not determined by a supernatural god or an earthly authority, one is free. As such, one's ethical prime directives are ''action'', ''freedom'', and ''decision'', thus, existentialism opposes [[rationalism]] and [[positivism (philosophy)|positivism]]. In seeking meaning to life, the existentialist looks to where people find meaning in life, in course of which using only reason as a source of meaning is insufficient; this gives rise to the emotions of [[anxiety]] and [[angst|dread]], felt in considering one's [[free will]], and the concomitant awareness of death. According to [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], [[existence precedes essence]]; the ([[essence]]) of one's life arises ''only'' after one comes to [[existence]].

[[Søren Kierkegaard]] spoke about a &quot;[[q:Søren Kierkegaard#Misattributed|leap]]&quot;, arguing that [[absurdism|life is full of absurdity]], and one must make his and her own values in an indifferent world. One can live meaningfully (free of despair and anxiety) in an unconditional commitment to something finite, and devotes that meaningful life to the commitment, despite the vulnerability inherent to doing so.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hall&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Amy Laura Hall |title=Kierkegaard and the Treachery of Love |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002 |isbn=0-521-89311-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arthur Schopenhauer]] answered: &quot;What is the meaning of life?&quot; by stating that one's life reflects one's will, and that the will (life) is an aimless, irrational, and painful drive. Salvation, deliverance, and escape from suffering are in aesthetic contemplation, sympathy for others, and [[asceticism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jacquette&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dale Jacquette |title=Schopenhauer, Philosophy, and the Arts |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-521-47388-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Murray&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Durno Murray |title=Nietzsche's Affirmative Morality |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1999 |isbn=3-11-016601-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], life is worth living only if there are goals inspiring one to live. Accordingly, he saw nihilism (&quot;all that happens is meaningless&quot;) as without goals. He stated that asceticism denies one's living in the world; stated that values are not objective facts, that are rationally necessary, universally binding commitments: our evaluations are interpretations, and not reflections of the world, as it is, in itself, and, therefore, [[perspectivism|all ideations take place from a particular perspective]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Reginster&quot;/&gt;

In absurdist philosophy, the Absurd arises out of the fundamental disharmony between the individual's search for meaning and the apparent meaninglessness of the universe. As beings looking for meaning in a meaningless world, humans have three ways of resolving the dilemma. Kierkegaard and Camus describe the solutions in their works, ''[[The Sickness Unto Death]]'' (1849) and ''[[The Myth of Sisyphus]]'' (1942):
* [[Suicide]] (or, &quot;escaping existence&quot;): a solution in which a person simply ends one's own life. Both Kierkegaard and Camus dismiss the viability of this option.
* [[Religious]] belief in a [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] realm or being: a solution in which one believes in the existence of a reality that is beyond the Absurd, and, as such, has meaning. Kierkegaard stated that a belief in anything beyond the Absurd requires a non-rational but perhaps necessary religious acceptance in such an intangible and empirically unprovable thing (now commonly referred to as a &quot;[[leap of faith]]&quot;). However, Camus regarded this solution as &quot;philosophical suicide&quot;.
* Acceptance of the Absurd: a solution in which one accepts and even embraces the Absurd and continues to live in spite of it. Camus endorsed this solution, while Kierkegaard regarded this solution as &quot;demoniac madness&quot;: &quot;''He rages most of all at the thought that eternity might get it into its head to take his misery from him!''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |authorlink=Søren Kierkegaard |title=The Sickness Unto Death |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1941 |isbn=1-4486-7502-2}}, Part I, Ch. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Secular humanism====
{{Further|Secular Humanism}}
[[File:HumanismSymbol.PNG|120px|left|thumb|The &quot;[[Happy Human]]&quot; symbol representing [[Secular Humanism]].]]
Per [[secular humanism]], the [[human race]] came to be by reproducing in a progression of [[Evolution|unguided evolution]] as an integral part of [[nature]], which is self-existing.&lt;ref name=humanifesto1&gt;{{cite web |title=[[Humanist Manifesto I]] |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto1.html |work=American Humanist Association |year=1933 |accessdate=2007-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=humanifesto2&gt;{{cite web |title=[[Humanist Manifesto II]] |work=American Humanist Association |year=1973 |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/about/manifesto2.html |accessdate=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge does not come from supernatural sources, but from human observation, experimentation, and rational analysis (the [[scientific method]]): the nature of the [[universe]] is what people discern it to be.&lt;ref name=humanifesto1/&gt; Likewise, &quot;[[intrinsic value (ethics)|values]] and realities&quot; are determined &quot;by means of intelligent inquiry&quot;&lt;ref name=humanifesto1/&gt; and &quot;are derived from human need and interest as tested by experience&quot;, that is, by [[critical thinking|critical intelligence]].&lt;ref name=humanifesto3&gt;{{cite web |title=[[Humanist Manifesto III]] |work=American Humanist Association |year=2003 |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/3/HumandItsAspirations.php |accessdate=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CDSH&gt;{{cite web |title=[[A Secular Humanist Declaration]] |work=Council for Democratic and Secular Humanism (now the Council for Secular Humanism) |year=1980 |url=http://www.secularhumanism.org/index.php?section=main&amp;page=declaration |accessdate=2007-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;As far as we know, the total personality is [a function] of the biological organism transacting in a social and cultural context.&quot;&lt;ref name=humanifesto2/&gt;

People determine human purpose, without supernatural influence; it is the human personality (general sense) that is the purpose of a human being's life; humanism seeks to develop and fulfill:&lt;ref name= humanifesto1/&gt; &quot;Humanism affirms our ability, and responsibility, to lead ethical lives of personal fulfillment that aspire to the greater good of humanity&quot;.&lt;ref name=humanifesto3/&gt; Humanism aims to promote [[enlightened self-interest]] and the [[common good]] for all people. It is based on the premises that the [[happiness]] of the individual person is inextricably linked to the well-being of humanity, as a whole, in part, because humans are social animals, who find meaning in [[interpersonal relationship|personal relations]], and because cultural progress benefits everybody living in the [[culture]].&lt;ref name= humanifesto2/&gt;&lt;ref name=humanifesto3/&gt;

The philosophical sub-genres [[posthumanism]] and [[transhumanism]] (sometimes used synonymously) are extensions of humanistic values. One should seek the advancement of [[human race|humanity]] and of [[biocentrism (ethics)|all life]] to the greatest degree feasible, to reconcile [[Renaissance humanism]] with the 21st century's [[technoscientific]] culture, thus, every living creature has the right to determine its personal and social &quot;meaning of life&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Nick Bostrom |title=Transhumanist Values |work=[[Oxford University]] |year=2005 |url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/values.html |accessdate=2007-07-28 |authorlink=Nick Bostrom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a humanistic-psychotherapeutic point of view, the question of the meaning of life could also be reinterpreted as &quot;What is the meaning of ''my'' life?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Yalom, ''Existential Psychotherapy'', 1980&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of becoming focused on cosmic or religious questions about overarching purpose, this approach suggests that the question is intensely personal. There are many therapeutic responses to this question, for example [[Viktor Frankl]] argues for &quot;Dereflection&quot;, which largely translates as ceasing to endlessly reflect on the self, instead of engaging in life. On the whole, the therapeutic response is that the question of meaning of life evaporates if one is fully engaged in life. The question then morphs into more specific worries such as &quot;What delusions am I under?&quot;, &quot;What is blocking my ability to enjoy things?&quot;, &quot;Why do I neglect loved-ones?&quot;. ''See also: [[Existential Therapy]] and [[Irvin Yalom]]''

====Logical positivism====
[[Logical positivists]] ask: &quot;What is the meaning of life?&quot;, &quot;What is the meaning in asking?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Taylor |authorlink=Richard Taylor (philosopher) |title=Good and Evil |chapter= Chapter 5: The Meaning of Life |publisher=Macmillan Publishing Company |date=January 1970 |isbn=0-02-616690-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wohlgennant, Rudolph. (1981). &quot;Has the Question about the Meaning of Life any Meaning?&quot; (Chapter 4). In E.

The things (people, events) in the life of a person can have meaning (importance) as parts of a whole, but a discrete meaning of (the) life, itself, aside from those things, cannot be discerned. A person's life has meaning (for himself, others) as the life events resulting from his achievements, legacy, family, etc., but, to say that life, itself, has meaning, is a misuse of language, since any note of significance, or of consequence, is relevant only ''in'' life (to the living), so rendering the statement erroneous. [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote that although he found that his distaste for torture was not like his distaste for broccoli, he found no satisfactory, empirical method of proving this:&lt;ref name=&quot;Russel&quot;/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;When we try to be definite, as to what we mean when we say that this or that is &quot;the Good,&quot; we find ourselves involved in very great difficulties. Bentham's creed, that pleasure is the Good, roused furious opposition, and was said to be a pig's philosophy. Neither he nor his opponents could advance any argument. In a scientific question, evidence can be adduced on both sides, and, in the end, one side is seen to have the better case — or, if this does not happen, the question is left undecided. But in a question, as to whether this, or that, is the ultimate Good, there is no evidence, either way; each disputant can only appeal to his own emotions, and employ such rhetorical devices as shall rouse similar emotions in others ... Questions as to &quot;values&quot; — that is to say, as to what is good or bad on its own account, independently of its effects — lie outside the domain of science, as the defenders of religion emphatically assert. I think that, in this, they are right, but, I draw the further conclusion, which they do not draw, that questions as to &quot;values&quot; lie wholly outside the domain of knowledge. That is to say, when we assert that this, or that, has &quot;value&quot;, we are giving expression to our own emotions, not to a fact, which would still be true if our personal feelings were different.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell]] (1961). [http://www.solstice.us/russell/science-ethics.html ''Science and Ethics'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Postmodernism====
{{Further|Postmodernism}}
Postmodernist thought—broadly speaking—sees human nature as constructed by language, or by structures and institutions of human society. Unlike other forms of philosophy, postmodernism rarely seeks out ''[[a priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' or innate meanings in human existence, but instead focuses on analyzing or critiquing ''given'' meanings in order to rationalize or reconstruct them. Anything resembling a &quot;meaning of life&quot;, in postmodernist terms, can only be understood within a social and linguistic framework, and must be pursued as an escape from the power structures that are already embedded in all forms of speech and interaction. As a rule, postmodernists see [[awareness]] of the constraints of language as necessary to escaping those constraints, but different theorists take different views on the nature of this process: from radical reconstruction of meaning by individuals (as in [[deconstructionism]]) to theories in which individuals are primarily extensions of language and society, without real autonomy (as in [[poststructuralism]]). In general, postmodernism seeks meaning by looking at the underlying structures that create or impose meaning, rather than the [[epiphenomenal]] appearances of the world.

====Naturalistic pantheism====
According to [[naturalistic pantheism]], the meaning of life is to care for and look after nature and the environment.

==East Asian philosophy==
{{Further|Chinese philosophy|Japanese philosophy}}

===Mohism===
{{further|Mohism}}
The Mohist philosophers believed that the purpose of life was universal, impartial [[love]]. Mohism promoted a philosophy of impartial caring - a person should care equally for all other individuals, regardless of their actual relationship to him or her.&lt;ref name=philosophers&gt;''One hundred Philosophers. A guide to the world's greatest thinkers'' Peter J. King, Polish edition: Elipsa 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The expression of this indiscriminate caring is what makes man a righteous being in Mohist thought. This advocacy of impartiality was a target of attack by the other Chinese philosophical schools, most notably the [[Confucian]]s who believed that while love should be unconditional, it should not be indiscriminate. For example, children should hold a greater love for their parents than for random strangers.

===Confucianism===
{{further|Confucianism}}
[[Confucianism]] recognizes human nature in accordance with the need for discipline and education. Because mankind is driven by both positive and negative influences, Confucianists see a goal in achieving virtue through strong relationships and reasoning as well as minimizing the negative. This emphasis on normal living is seen in the Confucianist scholar [[Tu Wei-Ming]]'s quote, &quot;we can realize the ultimate meaning of life in ordinary human existence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tu, Wei-Ming. ''Confucian Thought: Selfhood as Creative Transformation.'' Albany: State University of New York Press, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legalism===
{{further|Legalism (Chinese philosophy)}}
The Legalists believed that finding the purpose of life was a meaningless effort. To the Legalists, only practical knowledge was valuable, especially as it related to the function and performance of the state.

==Religious perspectives==
The religious perspectives on the meaning of life are those ideologies which explain life in terms of an implicit purpose not defined by humans.
&lt;!--Note: the following two commented sections were commented out when I re-classified the sections. It is preserved here in case someone can make use of it later--&gt;
&lt;!--The rise of [[universal religion]]s marks a shift from concerns about personal potential and relationships to the natural world, to a focus on more profound forms of devotion and all-inclusive salvation.  In the Christian, Muslim, and Sikh faiths, this manifested as subjection to God: salvation was not a personal achievement, but rather a token of God's grace to be earned by the devout. Eastern traditions like Buddhism and Hinduism, likewise, moved from their primary focus on individual liberation to more abstract ideals of liberation for all. In all, this era magnified and generalized ideals of love, compassion, and relief of human suffering that had little or no place in earlier philosophy.--&gt;
&lt;!--Prior to the expansion of the major [[universal religion]]s—from the 1st or 2nd centuries BCE to the 6th century CE, depending on the faith—the meaning of life was investigated in terms of human potential and the relationship of individuals to the natural world. Devotion to a god or gods was an important aspect of some traditions, but was generally viewed in terms of personal development (as in the [[#Hindu views|Hindu]] relationship between ''atman'' and ''brahman'', or as a social relationship, as in the [[#jewish view|Jewish covenant]]). Other traditions relied heavily on reason, discipline, or the development of other human faculties, either as meaningful in their own right, or as tools to reach other decisions.--&gt;

====Christianity====
[[File:Cristo Redentor - Rio.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Christ the Redeemer (statue)|Christ the Redeemer]]'' statue on [[Corcovado (Brazil)|Corcovado]] mountain in [[Rio de Janeiro]] is symbolic of Christianity,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hindustantimes.com/News-Feed/europe/The-new-Seven-Wonders-of-the-World/235431/Article1-235487.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; illustrating the concept of seeking [[redemption (theology)|redemption]] through [[Jesus Christ]].]]
To start off, Christianity has its roots in Judaism, and shares much of the latter faith's [[ontology]], its central beliefs derive from the teachings of [[Jesus Christ]], as presented in the [[New Testament]]. Life's purpose in Christianity is to seek divine salvation through the grace of God and intercession of Christ. (cf. [[Gospel of John|John]] 11:26) The New Testament speaks of God wanting to have a relationship with humans both in this life and the life to come, which can happen only if one's [[Atonement in Christianity|sins are forgiven]] (John 3:16–21; 2 Peter 3:9).

In the Christian view, humankind was made in the [[Image of God]] and perfect, but the [[Fall of Man]] caused the progeny of the first Parents to inherit [[Original Sin]]. The sacrifice of Christ's passion, death and resurrection provide the means for transcending that impure state (Romans 6:23). The means for doing so varies between different groups of Christians, but all rely on belief in Jesus, his work on the cross and his resurrection as the fundamental starting point for a relationship with God. Faith in God is found in Ephesians 2:8–9 – &quot;&lt;sup&gt;[8]&lt;/sup&gt;For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; &lt;sup&gt;[9]&lt;/sup&gt;not as a result of works, that no one should boast.&quot; (New American Standard Bible; 1973). A recent alternative Chrisitian theological discourse interprets Jesus as revealing that the purpose of life is to elevate our compassionate response to human suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drake-Brockman|first=Tom|title=Christian Humanism: the compassionate theology of a Jew called Jesus|year=2012|url=http://christianhumanism.webs.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless the conventional Christian position is that people are justified by belief in the propitiatory sacrifice of Jesus' death on the cross. The Gospel maintains that through this belief, the barrier that sin has created between man and God is destroyed, and allows God to change people and instill in them a new heart after his own will, and the ability to do it. This is what the terms &quot;reborn&quot; or &quot;saved&quot; almost always refer to.

In the ''[[Westminster Shorter Catechism]]'', the first question is: &quot;What is the chief end of Man?&quot;, that is, &quot;What is Man's main purpose?&quot;. The answer is: &quot;Man's chief end is to glorify God, and enjoy him forever&quot;. God requires one to obey the revealed moral law saying: &quot;love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind; and your neighbour as yourself&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Westminster Shorter Catechism |url=http://www.creeds.net/reformed/Westminster/shorter_catechism.html |accessdate=2008-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Baltimore Catechism]]'' answers the question &quot;Why did God make you?&quot; by saying &quot;God made me to know Him, to love Him, and to serve Him in this world, and to be happy with Him forever in heaven.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Baltimore Catechism |url= http://www.sacred-texts.com/chr/balt/balt1.htm |accessdate=2008-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Apostle Paul also answers this question in his speech on the [[Areopagus]] in [[Athens]]: &quot;And He has made from one blood every nation of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and has determined their preappointed times and the boundaries of their dwellings, so that they should seek the Lord, in the hope that they might grope for Him and find Him, though He is not far from each one of us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bible]], [[Acts]] 17:26–27, [[NKJV]]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] (Mormons) teaches that the purpose of life on Earth is to gain knowledge and experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gospel Principles&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Gospel Principles |url= https://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles?lang=eng}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mormons believe that God the Father first created humans as spirits, each with the potential to progress toward perfection. Earth life is considered a crucial stage in this development — wherein a physical body, coupled with the freedom to choose, makes for an ideal environment to learn and grow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gospel Principles&quot;/&gt; The Fall of Adam was considered a necessary step because only through the opposition found in mortality can mankind learn the difference between good and evil (Genesis 3:22, 2 Nephi 2:11&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Boof of Mormon |url= http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm?lang=eng}}&lt;/ref&gt;). God provides instruction to mortals on how to choose good over evil by revealing it through chosen prophets. This instruction includes the concept of repentance as a lifelong growth process through which mankind continuously learns to make better choices by forsaking sin and learning from mistakes. Throughout this process, baptized members can regularly invoke the cleansing power of Christ's atonement through the weekly ordinance of the sacrament (Luke 22:17-20). It is by this cleansing power of the atonement that mortals are made worthy to return to the presence of the Father, where they can continue to build upon the wisdom gained during mortality (Doctrine and Covenants 130:18-19&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Doctrine and Covenants |url= http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament?lang=eng}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and ultimately fulfill their end purpose, which is to attain a fullness of joy by inheriting God's glory (Romans 8:16-17, Galatians 4:7)—in other words, his intelligence (Doctrine and Covenants 93:36; 50:24).

====Islam====
In [[Islam]], man's ultimate life objective is to worship the creator [[Allah]](God) by abiding by the Divine guidelines revealed in the [[Qur'an]] and the Tradition of the [[Muhammad|Prophet]]. Earthly life is merely a test, determining one's afterlife, either in ''[[Jannat]]'' (Paradise) or in ''[[Jahannam]]'' (Hell).

For Allah's satisfaction, via the Qur'an, all Muslims must believe in God, his revelations, his [[Angels in Islam|angels]], his [[Prophets in Islam|messengers]], and in the &quot;[[Qiyamah|Day of Judgment]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite quran|2|4|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|2|285|style=ref}}, {{cite quran|4|136|style=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Qur'an describes the purpose of creation as follows: &quot;Blessed be he in whose hand is the kingdom, he is powerful over all things, who created death and life that he might examine which of you is best in deeds, and he is the almighty, the forgiving&quot; (Qur'an 67:1–2) and &quot;And I (Allâh) created not the jinn and mankind except that they should be obedient (to Allah).&quot; (Qur'an 51:56). Obedience testifies to the [[Tawhid|oneness of God]] in his lordship, his names, and his attributes. Terrenal life is a test; how one ''acts'' (behaves) determines whether one's soul goes to Jannat (Heaven) or to Jahannam (Hell).&lt;ref&gt;In most english translations of Qur'an 51:56  translates the last word to &quot;worship&quot;, but any Arabic (and Urdu) speaking person can confirm that &quot;ABADON&quot; means to follow the Will of Allah (NOT worship). This is relevant because the Will of Allah is not just to worship HIM; to be just and good with humanity is equally important.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The [[Five Pillars of Islam]] are duties incumbent to every Muslim; they are: [[Shahadah]] (profession of faith); [[Salah]] (ritual prayer); [[Zakah]] (charity); [[Sawm]] (fasting during [[Ramadan]]), and [[Hajj]] (pilgrimage to [[Mecca]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Pillars of Islam |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica Online |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/295625/Pillars-of-Islam |accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They derive from the [[Hadith]] works, notably of [[Sahih Al-Bukhari]] and [[Sahih Muslim]].

Beliefs differ among the [[Kalam]]. The [[Sunni]] concept of pre-destination is [[Qadr (doctrine)|divine decree]];&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Muslim|1|1}}&lt;/ref&gt; likewise, the [[Shi'a]] concept of pre-destination is [[Adalah|divine justice]]; in the [[esoteric]] view of the [[Sufi]]s, the universe exists only for God's pleasure; Creation is a grand game, wherein Allah is the greatest prize.

====Judaism====
In the Judaic world view, the meaning of life is to elevate the physical world ('Olam HaZeh) and prepare it for the spiritual world to come ('Olam HaBa). The most important way to elevate life is through the observance of &quot;mitzvot&quot; (divine commandments in the Torah). In Judaism God is not affected or benefited through worship, but a person benefits when drawing close to God through prayer and service, by bringing out their own intrinsic holiness and divine nature. Among other crucial values in the Torah is pursuit of justice, compassion, peace, kindness, hard work, prosperity, humility, and education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohn-Sherbok&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Dan Cohn-Sherbok |title=Judaism: History, Belief, and Practice |publisher=Routledge |year=2003 |isbn=0-415-23661-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Heschel&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Abraham Joshua Heschel |title=Heavenly Torah: As Refracted Through the Generations |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |year=2005 |isbn=0-8264-0802-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Jewish eschatology#Olam Haba - the afterlife and the world to come|Olam Haba]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuchat&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Wilfred Shuchat |title=The Garden of Eden &amp; the Struggle to Be Human: According to the Midrash Rabbah |publisher=Devora Publishing |year=2006 |isbn=1-932687-31-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; is about elevating oneself spiritually, with an everlasting connection to God.

Braham |title=Contemporary Views on the Holocaust |publisher=Springer |year=1983 |isbn=0-89838-141-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Al shlosha devarim,&quot; a well-known [[Mishnah]] from [[Pirkei Avot]], relates a saying of one of the first scholars of the Oral Law, [[Simeon the Just|Simeon the Righteous]], &quot;the world stands on three things: on Torah, on worship, and on acts of loving kindness.&quot; This further explains the Jewish mentality towards the meaning of life. The Torah element relates to Olam Haba, as the siddur (prayer book) states, &quot;blessed is our God who created us for his honor and separated us from the wayward and gave us the Torah of truth and planted within us everlasting life.&quot; The Talmud furthermore states that this world is but an anteroom for preparing for Olam Haba. Since, in the Judaic view, one lives for the sake and in the dimension of Olam Haba, the difficulties, contradictions, sufferings, and confusions of this world are not an argument against God's perfect justice and loving kindness, but an argument for the grander purpose and dimension of Olam Haba, such that the Talmud states, &quot;everything that God does, he does for the good.&quot;  

[[Judaism]]'s most important feature is the worship of a single, incomprehensible, [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]], one, indivisible, [[God in Judaism|Being of absolute existence]], who [[Genesis creation myth|created the universe]] and governs it. Closeness with the one God of Israel, and adherence to the laws revealed in the Torah for the benefit of the world, is the central concept of Judaism. Per traditional Judaism, God established a [[Covenant (Israel)|covenant]] with the [[Jewish people]], at [[Mount Sinai]], revealing his laws and [[613 mitzvot|commandments]] in the [[Torah]]. In [[Rabbinic Judaism]], the Torah comprises the written [[Pentateuch]] (Torah) and the oral law tradition (later transcribed as sacred writing).

Kabbalistically, the meaning of life is to connect with the One God. [[Kabbalah]] posits that only God exists, but &quot;Klipot&quot; (shells) separate us from the holiness of God. Therefore, the meaning of life is to remove those shells and connect to God.

====Zoroastrianism====
[[Zoroastrianism]] is the religion and philosophy named after its prophet [[Zoroaster]], which is believed to have influenced the beliefs of Judaism and its descendant religions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Zoroastrianism#Relation to other religions and cultures|Zoroastrianism – Relation to other religions and cultures]]&lt;/ref&gt; Zoroastrians believe in a universe created by a transcendental God, [[Ahura Mazda]], to whom all worship is ultimately directed. Ahura Mazda's creation is ''[[asha]]'', truth and order, and it is in conflict with its [[antithesis]], ''druj'', falsehood and disorder. (See also [[Zoroastrian eschatology]]).

Since humanity possesses [[free will]], people must be responsible for their moral choices. By using free will, people must take an active role in the universal conflict, with good thoughts, good words and good deeds to ensure happiness and to keep chaos at bay.

[[Hinduism]] is a religious category including many beliefs and traditions. Since Hinduism was the way of expressing meaningful living for a long time, before there was a need for naming it as a separate religion, Hindu doctrines are supplementary and complementary in nature, generally non-exclusive, suggestive and tolerant in content.&lt;ref name=weightman&gt;{{Cite book |author=Simon Weightman |year=1998 |title=The new Penguin handbook of living religions |editor=Hinnells, John (Ed.) |publisher=[[Penguin books]] |chapter=Hinduism |isbn=0-14-051480-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most believe that the [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]] (spirit, soul)—the person's true ''self''—is eternal.&lt;ref name=&quot;monierwilliams&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Monier Monier-Williams |authorlink=Monier Monier-Williams |year=1974 |title=Brahmanism and Hinduism: Or, Religious Thought and Life in India, as Based on the Veda and Other Sacred Books of the Hindus |publisher=Adamant Media Corporation |url=http://books.google.com/?id=U5IBXA4UpT0C&amp;dq=isbn=1-4212-6531-1 |accessdate= 2007-07-08 |series=Elibron Classics |isbn=1-4212-6531-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In part, this stems from Hindu beliefs that spiritual development occurs across many lifetimes, and goals should match the state of development of the individual. There are four possible aims to human life, known as the ''[[purusharthas]]'' (ordered from least to greatest): ''[[Kāma]]'' (wish, desire, love and sensual pleasure), ''[[Artha]]'' (wealth, prosperity, glory), ''[[Dharma]]'' (righteousness, duty, morality, [[virtue]], [[ethics]]), encompassing notions such as ''[[ahimsa]]'' (non-violence) and [[satya]] (truth) and ''[[Moksha]]'' (liberation, i.e. liberation from [[Saṃsāra]], the cycle of [[reincarnation]]).&lt;ref&gt;For dharma, artha, and kama as &quot;brahmanic householder values&quot; see: Flood (1996), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the ''Dharma Śāstras'' as discussing the &quot;four main goals of life&quot; (dharma, artha, {{IAST|kāma}}, and moksha) see: Hopkins, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For definition of the term पुरुष-अर्थ ({{IAST|puruṣa-artha}}) as &quot;any of the four principal objects of human life, i.e. {{lang|sa|धर्म}}, {{lang|sa|अर्थ}}, {{lang|sa|काम}}, and {{lang|sa|मोक्ष}}&quot; see: Apte, p. 626, middle column, compound #1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In all schools of Hinduism, the meaning of life is tied up in the concepts of [[karma]] (causal action), [[sansara]] (the cycle of birth and rebirth), and [[moksha]] (liberation). Existence is conceived as the progression of the ātman (similar to the western concept of a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]) across numerous lifetimes, and its ultimate progression towards liberation from karma. Particular goals for life are generally subsumed under broader [[yoga]]s (practices) or [[dharma]] (correct living) which are intended to create more favorable reincarnations, though they are generally positive acts in this life as well. Traditional schools of Hinduism often worship [[Deva (Hinduism)|Devas]] which are manifestations of [[Ishvara]] (a personal or chosen God); these Devas are taken as ideal forms to be identified with, as a form of spiritual improvement.

In short, the goal is to realize the fundamental truth about oneself.  This thought is conveyed in the [[Mahāvākyas]] (&quot;[[Tat Tvam Asi]]&quot;,  &quot;Aham Brahmāsmi&quot;, &quot;Prajñānam Brahma&quot; and &quot;Ayam Ātmā Brahma&quot;).

=====Advaita and Dvaita Hinduism=====
{{Further|Advaita Vedanta|Dvaita}}
Later schools reinterpreted the [[vedas]] to focus on [[Brahman]], &quot;The One Without a Second&quot;,&lt;ref name=bhaskaranandaessential&gt;{{Cite book |last=Bhaskarananda |first=Swami |year=1994 |title=The Essentials of Hinduism: a comprehensive overview of the world's oldest religion |place=Seattle, WA |publisher=Viveka Press |isbn=1-884852-02-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a central God-like figure.

In [[monist]] Advaita Vedanta, ātman is ultimately indistinguishable from Brahman, and the goal of life is to know or realize that one's [[Ātman (Hinduism)|ātman]] (soul) is identical to [[Brahman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Vivekananda |first=Swami |authorlink=Swami Vivekananda |year=1987 |title=Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda |place=Calcutta |publisher=Advaita Ashrama |isbn=81-85301-75-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the [[Upanishads]], whoever becomes fully aware of the ātman, as one's core of self, realizes identity with Brahman, and, thereby, achieves [[Moksha]] (liberation, freedom).&lt;ref name=&quot;monierwilliams&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;werner&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Werner |first=Karel |year=1994 |title=A Popular Dictionary of Hinduism |place=Richmond, Surrey |editor=Hinnells, John (Ed.) |publisher=Curzon Press |chapter=Hinduism |isbn= 0-7007-0279-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also the Vedic statement &quot;ayam ātmā brahma&quot; (This [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]] is [[Brahman]])&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dualist]] Dvaita Vedanta and other [[bhakti]] schools have a [[Dualism#Consciousness/Matter dualism|dualist]] interpretation. [[Brahman]] is seen as a supreme being with a personality and manifest qualities. The ātman depends upon Brahman for its existence; the meaning of life is achieving Moksha through love of God and upon His grace.&lt;ref name=&quot;werner&quot;/&gt;

=====Vaishnavism=====
[[Vaishnavism]] is a branch of Hinduism in which the principal belief is the identification of [[Vishnu]] or [[Narayana]] as the one supreme God. This belief contrasts with the [[Krishnaism|Krishna-centered]] traditions, such as [[Vallabha]], [[Nimbaraka]] and [[Gaudiya]], in which [[Krishna]] is considered to be the One and only Supreme God and the [[Svayam Bhagavan|source of all avataras]].&lt;ref name = &quot;RG&quot;&gt;{{cite book

| isbn = 0-415-40548-3
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vaishnava theology includes the central beliefs of Hinduism such as [[monotheism]], [[reincarnation]], [[samsara]], [[karma]], and the various [[Yoga]] systems, but with a particular emphasis on devotion ([[bhakti]]) to Vishnu through the process of [[Bhakti yoga]], often including singing Vishnu's name's ([[bhajan]]), meditating upon his form ([[dharana]]) and performing [[deity]] worship ([[puja (Hinduism)|puja]]). The practices of deity worship are primarily based on texts such as [[Pañcaratra]] and various [[Samhita (disambiguation)|Samhita]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vnn.org/editorials/ET9901/ET05-2795.html Tantric Literature And Gaudiya Vaishnavism]&lt;/ref&gt;

One popular school of thought, [[Gaudiya Vaishnavism]], teaches the concept of [[Achintya Bheda Abheda]]. In this, Krishna is worshipped as the single true God, and all living entities are eternal parts and the Supreme Personality of the Godhead Krishna. Thus the constitutional position of a living entity is to serve the Lord with love and devotion. The purpose of human life especially is to think beyond the animalistic way of eating, sleeping, mating and defending and engage the higher intelligence to revive the lost relationship with Krishna.

====Jainism====
[[File:Jain hand.svg|thumb|125px|The Jainist Vow of [[Ahimsa in Jainism|Ahimsa]]. The [[dharmacakra]] (wheel) is the resolve to halt the cycle of reincarnation via truth and non-violence.]]
{{Further|Jainism|Jain philosophy}}
[[Jainism]] is a religion originating in [[Iron Age India|ancient India]], its ethical system promotes self-discipline above all else. Through following the [[asceticism|ascetic]] teachings of [[Tirthankara|Jina]], a [[human]] achieves [[Moksa (Jainism)|enlightenment (perfect knowledge)]]. Jainism divides the universe into living and non-living beings. Only when the non-living become attached to the living does suffering result. Therefore, happiness is the result of self-conquest and freedom from external objects. The meaning of life may then be said to be to use the physical body to achieve self-realization and bliss.&lt;ref&gt;Shah, Natubhai. ''Jainism: The World of Conquerors.'' Sussex Academic Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jains believe that every human is responsible for his or her actions and all living beings have an eternal [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], ''[[jiva]]''. Jains believe all souls are equal because they all possess the potential of being liberated and attaining [[Moksa (Jainism)|Moksha]]. The [[Karma in Jainism|Jain view of karma]] is that every action, every word, every thought produces, besides its visible, an invisible, transcendental effect on the soul.

Jainism includes strict adherence to [[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]] (or ''ahinsā''), a form of [[nonviolence]] that goes far beyond [[vegetarianism]]. Jains refuse food obtained with unnecessary cruelty. Many practice a lifestyle similar to [[veganism]] due to the violence of modern dairy farms, and others exclude [[root vegetable]]s from their diets in order to preserve the lives of the plants from which they eat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retoday.org.uk/pdfs/dre/viren.pdf |title=Viren, Jain |accessdate=2007-06-14 |publisher=[http://www.retoday.org.uk/ RE Today] |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Buddhism====

===== Early Buddhism =====

Buddhists believe that life is inherent with [[Dukkha|suffering]] or frustration. This does not imply that there is no pleasure in life, but rather that pleasure alone does not lend itself to lasting happiness. True suffering is caused by attachment to objects material or non-material, which in turn causes one to be born again and again in [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|the cycle of existence]]. The Buddhist [[sūtras]] and [[tantras]] do not speak about &quot;the meaning of life&quot; or &quot;the purpose of life&quot;, but about the potential of human life to end suffering through detaching oneself from cravings and conceptual attachments. Suffering can be overcome through human activity, simply by removing the cause of suffering. Attaining and perfecting dispassion is a process of many levels that ultimately results in the state of [[Nirvana]]. Nirvana means freedom from both [[Dukkha|suffering]] and [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Four Noble Truths |url=http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |publisher=Thebigview.com |accessdate=2009-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Dharma Wheel.svg|thumb|100px|left|The eight-spoked [[Dharmachakra]]]]
[[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] is generally considered to be close to the early Buddhist practice. It promotes the concept of [[Vibhajjavada]] ([[Pāli|Pali]]), literally &quot;Teaching of Analysis&quot;, which says that insight must come from the aspirant's experience, critical investigation, and reasoning instead of by blind faith. However, the Theravadin tradition also emphasizes heeding the advice of the wise, considering such advice and evaluation of one's own experiences to be the two tests by which practices should be judged. The Theravadin goal is liberation (or freedom) from suffering, according to the [[Four Noble Truths]]. This is attained in the achievement of Nirvana, or Unbinding which also ends the [[reincarnation|repeated cycle]] of birth, old age, sickness and death.

=====Mahayana Buddhism=====
{{Further|Mahayana}}
Mahayana Buddhist schools de-emphasize the traditional view (still practiced in [[Theravada]]) of the release from individual Suffering ([[Dukkha]]) and attainment of Awakening (Nirvana). In Mahayana, the Buddha is seen as an eternal, immutable, inconceivable, [[omnipresent]] being. The fundamental principles of Mahayana doctrine are based on the possibility of universal liberation from suffering for all beings, and the existence of the transcendent [[Buddha-nature]], which is the eternal Buddha essence present, but hidden and unrecognised, in all living beings.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Philosophical schools of Mahayana Buddhism, such as [[zen|Chan/Zen]] and the [[vajrayana]] Tibetan and Shingon schools, explicitly teach that [[bodhisattva]]s should refrain from full liberation, allowing themselves to be reincarnated into the world until all beings achieve enlightenment. Devotional schools such as [[Pure Land]] Buddhism seek the aid of celestial buddhas—individuals who have spent lifetimes{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} accumulating positive karma, and use that accumulation to aid all.

====Sikhism====
[[File:Khanda1.svg|thumb|100px|left|The [[Khanda (religious symbol)|Khanda]], an important symbol of [[Sikhism]].]]
The monotheistic [[Sikhism|Sikh]] religion was founded by [[Guru Nanak Dev]], the term &quot;sikh&quot; means student, which denotes that followers will lead their lives forever learning. This system of religious [[philosophy]] and expression has been traditionally known as the [[Gurmat]] (literally &quot;the counsel of the gurus&quot;) or the Sikh Dharma. The followers of Sikhism are ordained to follow the teachings of the ten [[Sikh Gurus]], or enlightened leaders, as well as the holy scripture entitled the ''[[Gurū Granth Sāhib]]'', which includes selected works of many philosophers from diverse socio-economic and religious backgrounds.

The Sikh Gurus say that salvation can be obtained by following various spiritual paths, so Sikhs do not have a monopoly on salvation: &quot;The Lord dwells in every heart, and every heart has its own way to reach Him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Singh&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Daljeet Singh |title=Guru Tegh Bahadur |publisher=Language Dept., Punjab |year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs believe that all people are equally important before [[Waheguru|God]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mayled&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jon Mayled |title=Modern World Religions: Sikhism |publisher=Harcourt Heinemann |year=2002 |isbn=0-435-33626-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sikhs balance their moral and spiritual values with the quest for knowledge, and they aim to promote a life of peace and equality but also of positive action.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sikhcoalition.org The Sikh Coalition]&lt;/ref&gt;

A key distinctive feature of Sikhism is a non-[[Anthropomorphism#In religion and mythology|anthropomorphic]] concept of God, to the extent that one can interpret God as the [[Universe]] itself ([[pantheism]]). Sikhism thus sees life as an opportunity to understand this God as well as to discover the divinity which lies in each individual.   While a full understanding of God is beyond human beings,&lt;ref name=&quot;p252&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |last=Parrinder |first=Geoffrey |authorlink=Geoffrey Parrinder |year=1971 |title=World Religions: From Ancient History to the Present |publisher=Hamlyn Publishing Group Limited |location=United States |isbn=0-87196-129-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guru Nanak Dev|Nanak]] described God as not wholly unknowable, and stressed that God must be seen from &quot;the inward eye&quot;, or the &quot;heart&quot;, of a human being: devotees must [[meditate]] to progress towards enlightenment and the ultimate destination of a Sikh is to lose the ego completely in the love of the lord and finally merge into the almighty creator. Nanak emphasized the revelation through meditation, as its rigorous application permits the existence of communication between God and human beings.&lt;ref name=&quot;p252&quot;/&gt;

===East Asian religions===

====Taoism====
[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|100px|''[[Taijitu]]'' symbolizes the [[unity of opposites]] between yin and yang.]]
[[Taoist]] [[cosmogony]] emphasizes the need for all sentient beings and all man to return to the ''primordial'' or to rejoin with the ''Oneness'' of the Universe by way of self-cultivation and self-realization. All adherents should understand and be in tune with the ultimate truth.

Taoists believe all things were originally from [[Taiji (philosophy)|Taiji]] and [[Tao]], and the meaning in life for the adherents is to realize the temporal nature of the existence. &quot;Only introspection can then help us to find our innermost reasons for living ... the simple answer is here within ourselves.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ming-Dao&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Ming-Dao Deng |title=Scholar Warrior: An Introduction to the Tao in Everyday Life |publisher=HarperCollins |year=1990 |isbn=0-06-250232-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Shinto====
[[File:Shinto torii vermillion.svg|thumb|100px|Shinto [[torii]], a traditional Japanese gate]]
[[Shinto]] is the native religion of Japan. Shinto means &quot;the path of the [[kami]]&quot;, but more specifically, it can be taken to mean &quot;the divine crossroad where the kami chooses his way&quot;. The &quot;divine&quot; crossroad signifies that all the universe is divine spirit. This foundation of [[free will]], choosing one's way, means that life is a creative process.

Shinto wants life to live, not to die. Shinto sees death as pollution and regards life as the realm where the divine spirit seeks to purify itself by rightful self-development. Shinto wants individual human life to be prolonged forever on earth as a victory of the divine spirit in preserving its objective personality in its highest forms. The presence of evil in the world, as conceived by Shinto, does not stultify the divine nature by imposing on divinity responsibility for being able to relieve human suffering while refusing to do so. The sufferings of life are the sufferings of the divine spirit in search of progress in the objective world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mason&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=J. W. T. Mason |title=The Meaning of Shinto |publisher=Trafford Publishing |year=2002 |isbn=1-4122-4551-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====New religions====
There are many [[new religious movements]] in East Asia, and some with millions of followers: [[Chondogyo]], [[Tenrikyo]], [[Cao Đài]], and [[Seicho-No-Ie]]. New religions typically have unique explanations for the meaning of life. For example, in Tenrikyo, one is expected to live a [[Joyous Life]] by participating in practices that create happiness for oneself and others.

==Scientific inquiry and perspectives==
&lt;!--Please do not include single-scientific-theory specific entries in this section. Thank you.--&gt;
[[File:DNA Overview.png|thumb|left|150px|[[DNA]], the substance containing the genetic instructions for the development and functioning of all known [[life|living organisms]].]]
Members of the [[scientific community]] and [[philosophy of science]] communities believe that science may be able to provide some context, and set some parameters for conversations on topics related to meaning in life. This includes offering insights from the [[Positive psychology|science of happiness]] or studies of [[Terror management theory|death anxiety]]. This also means providing context for, and understanding of [[life]] itself through explorations of the [[Big Bang]], [[Abiogenesis|the origin of life]], and [[evolution]].

===Psychological significance and value in life===
Science may or may not be able to tell us what is of [[essential value]] in life (and various materialist philosophies such as dialectical materialism challenge the very idea of an absolute value or meaning of life), but some studies definitely bear on aspects of the question: researchers in [[positive psychology]] (and, earlier and less rigorously, in [[humanistic psychology]]) study factors that lead to life satisfaction,&lt;ref&gt;E. Diener, J.J. Sapyta, E. Suh (1998). &quot;Subjective Well-Being Is Essential to Well-Being.&quot; ''Psychological Inquiry'', Lawrence Erlbaum&lt;/ref&gt; full [[flow (psychology)|engagement]] in activities,&lt;ref&gt;Csíkszentmihályi, Mihály (1990).

One value system suggested by [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychologists]], broadly called [[Terror Management Theory]], states that human meaning is derived from a fundamental fear of death, and values are selected when they allow us to escape the mental reminder of death.

[[Neuroscience]] describes [[reward system|reward]], [[pleasure]], and [[motivation]] in terms of neurotransmitter activity, especially in the [[limbic system]] and the [[ventral tegmental area]] in particular. If one believes that the meaning of life is to maximize pleasure and to ease general life, then this allows normative predictions about how to act to achieve this. Likewise, some ethical naturalists advocate a [[science of morality]] - the empirical pursuit of flourishing for all conscious creatures.

[[Sociology]] examines value at a social level using theoretical constructs such as [[Value theory#Sociology|value theory]], norms, [[anomie]], etc.

===Origin and nature of biological life===
The exact mechanisms of [[abiogenesis]] are unknown: notable hypotheses include the [[RNA world hypothesis]] (RNA-based replicators) and the [[iron-sulfur world theory]] (metabolism without genetics). The process by which different lifeforms have developed throughout history via [[gene]]tic [[mutation]] and [[natural selection]] is explained by [[evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Darwin]] (1859). ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 20th century, based upon insight gleaned from the [[gene-centered view of evolution]], biologists [[George C. Williams]], [[Richard Dawkins]], [[David Haig (biologist)|David Haig]], among others, concluded that if there is a primary function to life, it is the replication of DNA and the survival of one's genes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawkins selfish gene&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[The Selfish Gene]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1976 |isbn=0-19-857519-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawkins river&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Richard Dawkins |authorlink=Richard Dawkins |title=[[River out of Eden]] |publisher=Basic Books |location=New York |year=1995 |isbn=0-465-06990-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though scientists have intensively studied [[organism|life on Earth]], defining [[life]] in unequivocal terms is still a challenge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astrobio.net/news/article226 Astrobiology Magazine: Defining Life]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbi.dk/~emmeche/cePubl/97e.defLife.v3f.html Defining Life, Explaining Emergence&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Physically, one may say that life &quot;feeds on [[negentropy|negative entropy]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Schrödinger |first=Erwin |title=What is Life? |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1944 |isbn=0-521-42708-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Margulis |first=Lynn |coauthor=Sagan, Dorion |title=What is Life? |publisher=University of California Press |year=1995 |isbn=0-520-22021-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; which refers to the process by which living entities decrease their internal [[entropy]] at the expense of some form of [[energy]] taken in from the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Lovelock |first=James |title=Gaia – a New Look at Life on Earth |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-19-286218-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Avery |first=John |title=Information Theory and Evolution |publisher=World Scientific |year=2003 |isbn=981-238-399-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biologists generally agree that lifeforms are [[self-organization|self-organizing]] systems [[homeostasis|regulating the internal environment as to maintain this organized state]], [[metabolism]] serves to provide energy, and [[reproduction]] causes life to continue over a span of multiple generations. Typically, organisms are responsive to stimuli and genetic information changes from generation to generation, resulting in adaptation through evolution; this optimizes the chances of survival for the individual organism and its descendants respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.una.edu/pdavis/BI%20101/Overview%20Fall%202004.htm |title=How to Define Life |accessdate=2008-10-17 |last=Davison |first=Paul G. |publisher=The University of North 
Alabama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-cellular replicating agents, notably [[virus]]es, are generally not considered to be organisms because they are incapable of independent reproduction or metabolism. This classification is problematic, though, since some [[parasite]]s and [[endosymbiont]]s are also incapable of independent life. [[Astrobiology]] studies the possibility of different forms of life on other worlds, including replicating structures made from materials other than DNA.

Though the [[Big Bang]] theory was met with much skepticism when first introduced, it has become well-supported by several independent observations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Helge Kragh |title=Cosmology and Controversy |publisher=Princeton University Press |year=1996 |isbn=0-691-00546-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, current physics can only describe the early universe from 10&lt;sup&gt;−43&lt;/sup&gt; seconds after the Big Bang (where zero time corresponds to infinite temperature); a theory of [[quantum gravity]] would be required to understand events before that time. Nevertheless, many physicists have speculated about what would have preceded this limit, and how the universe came into being.&lt;ref name=&quot;Prantzos &amp; Lyle&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Nikos Prantzos; Stephen Lyle |title= Our Cosmic Future: Humanity's Fate in the Universe |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2000 |isbn=0-521-77098-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one interpretation is that the Big Bang occurred coincidentally, and when considering the [[anthropic principle]], it is sometimes interpreted as implying the existence of a [[multiverse]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Edwards&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Rem B. Edwards |title=What Caused the Big Bang? |publisher=Rodopi |year=2001 |isbn=90-420-1407-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultimate fate of the universe, and implicitly humanity, is hypothesized as one in which biological life will eventually become unsustainable, such as through a [[Big Freeze]], [[Big Rip]], or [[Big Crunch]].

===Scientific questions about the mind===
The nature and origin of [[consciousness]] and the [[mind]] itself are also widely debated in science. The [[explanatory gap]] is generally equated with the [[hard problem of consciousness]], and the question of [[free will]] is also considered to be of fundamental importance. These subjects are mostly addressed in the fields of [[cognitive science]], [[neuroscience]] (e.g. the [[neuroscience of free will]]) and  [[philosophy of mind]], though some [[evolutionary biologist]]s and [[theoretical physicist]]s have also made several allusions to the subject.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitehouse&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Harvey Whitehouse |title=The Debated Mind: Evolutionary Psychology Versus Ethnography |publisher=Berg Publishers |year=2001 |isbn=1-85973-427-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Jeffrey Alan Gray |authorlink= Jeffrey Alan Gray |title=Consciousness: Creeping Up on the Hard Problem |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=0-19-852090-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ascent of the Blessed.jpg|175px|thumb|[[Hieronymus Bosch]]'s ''[[Ascent of the Blessed]]'' depicts a tunnel of light and spiritual figures, often described in reports of [[near-death experience]]s.]]
[[Reductionistic]] and [[eliminative materialism|eliminative materialistic]] approaches, for example the [[Multiple Drafts Model]], hold that consciousness can be wholly explained by neuroscience through the workings of the [[Human brain|brain]] and its [[neuron]]s, thus adhering to [[biological naturalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Gray&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Churchland&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Paul M.

On the other hand, some scientists, like [[Andrei Linde]], have considered that consciousness, like spacetime, might have its own intrinsic degrees of freedom, and that one's perceptions may be as real as (or even more real than) material objects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrow, Davies, Harper&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author1=John D.

Based on the premises of non-materialistic explanations of the mind, some have suggested the existence of a [[cosmic consciousness]], asserting that consciousness is actually the &quot;ground of all being&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Walker&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bruce&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ho&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mae-Wan Ho |authorlink=Mae-Wan Ho |title=The Rainbow and the Worm: The Physics of Organisms |publisher=World Scientific |year=1998 |pages= 218–231 |isbn=981-02-3427-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this view cite accounts of [[paranormal]] phenomena, primarily [[extrasensory perception]]s and [[psychic]] powers, as evidence for an [[incorporeal]] [[higher consciousness]].

The mystery of life and its meaning is an often recurring subject in [[popular culture]], featured in [[mass media|entertainment media]] and [[the arts|various forms]] of [[art]].

In [[Douglas Adams]]' popular comedy book, movie, television, and radio series ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', the [[Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything]] is given the numeric solution &quot;[[42 (number)|42]]&quot;, after seven and a half million years of calculation by a giant [[supercomputer]] called [[Minor characters from The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy#Deep Thought|Deep Thought]]. When this answer is met with confusion and anger from its constructors, Deep Thought explains that &quot;I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you've never actually known what the question is.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Baggini&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yeffeth&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Glenn Yeffeth |title=The Anthology at the End of the Universe: Leading Science Fiction Authors on Douglas Adams' The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy |publisher= BenBella Books, Inc |year=2005 |isbn=1-932100-56-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Badke&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=William B.

In the continuation of the book, the question is proposed to be the song of Bob Dylan &quot;How many roads must a man walk down, before you can call him a man.&quot; In the sequel, ''The Restaurant at the End of the Universe'', it states that the question is 6x9. While 6 x 9 = 54 in base 10, it does equal 42 in base 13, which author Adams claimed was completely serendipitous.  

[[File:HamletSkullHCSealous.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Hamlet with [[Yorick]]'s skull]]
In ''[[Monty Python's The Meaning of Life]]'', there are several allusions to the meaning of life. At the end of the film, a character played by [[Michael Palin]] is handed an envelope containing &quot;the meaning of life&quot;, which he opens and reads out to the audience: &quot;Well, it's nothing very special. Uh, try to be nice to people, avoid eating fat, read a good book every now and then, get some walking in, and try to live together in peace and harmony with people of all creeds and nations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;useless website&quot;&gt;[http://www.intriguing.com/mp/_scripts/meanlife.asp Monty Python's Completely Useless Web Site: Monty Python's The Meaning Of Life: Complete Script]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Burnham&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Terry Burnham |title=Mean Markets and Lizard Brains: How to Profit from the New Science of Irrationality |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |year=2005 |isbn=0-471-71695-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fernandez&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Yolanda Fernandez |title=In Their Shoes: Examining the Issue of Empathy and Its Place in the Treatment of Offenders |publisher=Wood 'N' Barnes Publishing |year=2002 |isbn=1-885473-48-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other Python sketches and songs are also existential in nature, questioning the importance we place on life (&quot;[[Always Look on the Bright Side of Life]]&quot;) and other meaning-of-life related questioning. John Cleese also had his sit-com character [[Basil Fawlty]] contemplating the futility of his own existence in [[Fawlty Towers]].

In ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode &quot;[[Homer the Heretic]]&quot;, a representation of God agrees to tell Homer what the meaning of life is, but the show's credits begin to roll just as he starts to say what it is.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pinsky&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author=Mark I.
